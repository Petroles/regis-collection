Abstract 

The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is one of the largest igneous provinces of the 

Phanerozoic and is believed to be coeval with the biological crisis of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary 

(~200Ma). These lavas have been extensively studied in the United States and Morocco, however little 

attention has been given to the CAMP lavas from the south of Portugal for which geochemical data 

have been recently published. Paleomagnetic methods can play a key role in the paleogeographic 

reconstruction of CAMP lavas at a global scale, and also be useful for geochronological purposes. 

Here I present a detailed rock- and paleo-magnetic study of the Portuguese CAMP lavas from the 

Algarve basin’s outcrops. It is showed that, despite severe superficial alteration, rocks preserved their 

primary magnetic mineralogy represented by an assemblage of fine titanomagnetite as the dominant 

carriers of the NRM. After cleaning by alternating field, a characteristic remanent magnetization 

(ChRM) is isolated at Dec=353.4º, Inc=52.8º (a95=1.5º, N=257) and Dec=0º, Inc=50.4º (a95=8.3º, 

N=8) for sample and site-based mean respectively. The results yielded a statistically well-defined pole 

at: Plat=83.3º and Plong=236.1º (A95=1.8º) and Plat=84.4º and Plong=177.9º (A95=9.8º) for sample 

and site-based paleomagnetic pole, respectively. Position of the corresponding paleomagnetic pole is 

significantly different from the referenced Messejana dyke’s pole. This discrepancy is due to the 

presence of two VGP’s. One of the VGP’s group (component A) falls within the Messejana VGP’s 

distributions whereas the other has no equivalent with other younger pole. We show the enigmatic 

direction of component B is not product of remagnetization, lightning or difference in age. We suggest 

significant tectonic movements in the Algarve’s basin as a potential cause. On a magnetostratigraphic 

point of view, all lavas carry a normal (positive) magnetization confirming the previous results that 

demonstrated the absence of the well-known E23r reverse anomaly in Morocco. VGP’s directions per 

flow vary slightly within the lava pile suggesting rapid eruptions.

Resumo expandido 

A Província Magmática do Atlântico Central (CAMP) é considerada uma das maiores províncias 

ígneas do Fanerozóico e é contemporânea da crise biológica que marca a transição Triássico-Jurássico 

(Tr-J) (~200 Ma). Vestígios desta província são encontrados em quatro continentes com uma área que 

excede os 100 milhões de km2, o que leva muitos cientistas a acreditar que a crise biológica que marca 

este período é provocada pela erupção desta província magmática. Neste sentido, as lavas da CAMP 

têm sido extensivamente estudadas, especialmente nos Estados Unidos e em Marrocos, não só para 

perceber o seu sincronismo com a crise biológica, mas também para estudos de paleoreconstituição 

usando métodos paleomagneticos.  

Em Portugal as evidências da CAMP são representadas por um dique de cerca de 540 Km de extensão, 

o dique da Messejana, e por afloramentos de lavas continentais distribuídos ao longo das bacias do 

Algarve e de Santiago do Cacém. A importância do estudo destas lavas recai sobretudo na necessidade 

de calcular novos polos paleomagneticos para reconstituir a paleogeografia da placa Ibérica à 200 Ma, 

que ainda hoje é um assunto discutido. O problema principal destas reconstituições paleogeográficas 

reside na escassez de dados paleomagneticos de qualidade. De facto, o único polo paleomagnetico 

para a Ibéria à 200 Ma é o polo da Messejana que servirá de referência para o presente estudo. 

A descoberta da anomalia E23r imediatamente abaixo do limite Triássico-Jurássico na bacia de 

Newark, Estados Unidos, e posteriormente sugerido nas lavas da CAMP em Marrocos, tem sido 

também um assunto bastante debatido uma vez que a presença desta anomalia nas lavas da CAMP é 

usada como marcador temporal. Em Newark, esta anomalia encontra-se abaixo do limite Tr-J e das 

lavas da CAMP. Em Marrocos, foi sugerida a presença desta anomalia E23r no meio da sequência 

basáltica levando à conclusão que a CAMP em Marrocos é mais antiga que em Newark e anterior ao 

limite Tr-J. Porém, os resultados que foram adquiridos no meu projecto de licenciatura demonstraram 

que a inversão geomagnética encontrada nas lavas em Marrocos era na realidade um artefacto 

resultante de uma remagnetização química. A eventual presença de anomalias inversas nos basaltos 

precisa de ser verificada em Portugal. 

O propósito principal deste trabalho é i) obter um novo polo paleomagnetico para a placa Ibérica aos 

200 Ma e ii) verificar a presença da anomalia E23r em Portugal. Devido à forte alteração química que 

afecta a maioria dos afloramentos da região do Algarve, um estudo preliminar da mineralogia 

magnética torna-se indispensável. 

A amostragem de campo consistiu em três excursões de cinco dias cada, financiadas pelo projecto 

FCT (IMPACTO; ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010). Mais de 300 amostras foram recolhidas desde 

a extremidade oeste da bacia do Algarve até à fronteira com Espanha. Foram privilegiados sítios de 

amostragem onde dados geoquímicos foram recentemente publicados. 

A parte experimental do trabalho foi dividida em duas partes: 1. Magnetismo de rocha e 2. 

Paleomagnetismo. O magnetismo de rocha permite a identificação do tipo, natureza e tamanho de 

grãos dos minerais portadores da magnetização natural remanescente da rocha. Para isto, os principais 

métodos usados foram: Magnetização remanescente isotérmica (IRM) que informa sobre a 

coercividade dos minerais ferromagnéticos presentes na amostra; Curvas termomagnéticas que 

identificam os minerais magnéticos presentes a partir da determinação da temperatura de Curie (Néel); 

Day-Plot e FORC’s usados na identificação do tamanho de grão e coercividade dos principais 

portadores magnéticos. 

A secção do Paleomagnetismo, baseou se essencialmente na desmagnetização usando campo alternado 

para calcular as direcções das componentes magnéticas presentes nas rochas. As componentes 

magnéticas são calculadas com base no método de análise das componentes principais (ACP) usando a 

estatística de Fisher que controla a qualidade das componentes calculadas. Posteriormente, o polo 

paleomagnetico calculado é qualitativamente avaliado usando o factor Q dos critérios de Van Der 

Voo. 

Os resultados mostram que apesar da forte oxidação que afecta a maioria das amostras da bacia do 

Algarve a magnetização remanescente é estável e é essencialmente portada por titanomagnetites. Estes 

resultados são inferidos pela análise de curvas termomagnéticas que a baixas temperaturas mostram a 

característica transição de Verwey (~-160ºC) da magnetite e a altas temperaturas apresentam 



  

 

temperaturas de Curie típicas da titanomagnetite (entre 200ºC e 560ºC). A análise das IRM usando o 

tratamento de Kruiver revela que para a maioria das amostras existe para além da magnetite, um 

mineral mais coercivo que não é identificado nas curvas termomagnéticas. Este mineral mais coercivo 

existe em pequena proporção nas amostras e pensa-se ser hematite, mineral comum nos basaltos. Nas 

curvas termomagnéticas, um outro mineral é identificado aos ~250ºC-350ºC. Este mineral é 

interpretado como sendo maghemite, a fase oxidada da magnetite. A associação titanomagnetite, 

maghemite e hematite corresponde à mineralogia clássica de basaltos continentais com algum grau de 

oxidação.  

As amostras submetidas à desmagnetização em campo alternado (AF) mostram padrões de 

desmagnetização bastante estáveis, todas elas com polarização normal (positiva) e em geral com 

distribuições bem agrupadas por sítio nos estereogramas. Duas componentes foram isoladas: i) uma 

componente magnética eliminada com campos inferiores a 20 mT e interpretada como sendo uma 

componente viscosa, adquirida em campo fraco posteriormente à formação da rocha; ii) Uma 

componente magnética estável em campos elevados (&gt; 40 mT) com uma direcção N-NE e inclinação 

positiva.  

Das 280 amostras analisadas, 257 foram usadas para calcular a componente média das amostras, o que 

representa uma percentagem de sucesso ~92%. Os “outliers” foram eliminados usando o método de 

Vandamme 1994. A componente magnética média calculada para todas as amostras, corrigidas pelo 

acamamento (contacto com sedimentos abaixo das camadas de lavas ou as paredes das escoadas) é: 

Dec=353.4º, Inc=52.8º (a95=1.5º, N=257). Também é possível fazer se uma média da componente 

média por sítio paleomagnético. E nesse caso, para oito sítios tem-se: Dec=0º, Inc=50.4º (a95=8.3º, 

N=8). A componente magnética média é posteriormente usada para calcular o polo paleomagnetico e a 

sua confiabilidade é avaliada estatisticamente pelos parâmetros de Fisher nomeadamente: k, o 

parâmetro de dispersão das amostras em relação a uma dada população; a95, o intervalo de 95% de 

confiança na direcção magnética média; R, a direcção do vector resultante. Este parâmetro é 

relativamente importante devido à sua independência em relação ao número de amostragem, N. A 

componente média para todas as amostras e a componente média por sítio paleomagnético é: 

Plat=83.3º,Plong=236.1º, (A95=1.8º, K=25.9) e Plat=84.4º,Plong=177.9º, (A95=9.8º, K=32.9), 

respectivamente. Quando comparamos os polos obtidos com a curva de deriva polar da Ibéria, 

construída a partir de uma compilação de vários autores, não existe similaridade com o polo da 

Messejana ou com polos de idades mais recentes. Porém, se apenas considerarmos os polos 

geomagnéticos virtuais (VGP) de cada sítio de amostragem, observamos a presença de dois grupos de 

direcções distintas: um grupo (designado por componente A) com uma direcção média muito próxima 

do polo da Messejana e um outro grupo (designado por componente B) com uma direcção média 

muito distinta do polo da Messejana e sem qualquer similaridade com polos de idade mais recente da 

APWP da Ibéria. Tendo em conta que a direcção da componente B é partilhada por 4 VGP’s que estão 

todos localizados na parte central da bacia do Algarve, sugerimos que essa direcção da componente B 

pode ser o resultado de movimentos tectónicos posteriores.  

Esses resultados fornecem uma base sólida para estudos paleomagneticos futuros nas lavas da CAMP 

em Portugal. Uma perspectiva futura é estudar novos sítios paleomagneticos de outra bacia, 

nomeadamente a bacia de Santiago do Cacém, para verificar a origem da componente B e para obter 

um novo polo paleomagnético com critérios estatísticos satisfatórios.

Paleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       1 

1. Introduction 

The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is one of the largest Phanerozoic continental Large 

Igneous Province (LIP), associated with the disruption of Pangea and the opening of the central 

Atlantic Ocean (Marzoli et al., 1999). Similar to the Siberian and Deccan Traps, the CAMP 

magmatism is apparently coeval with one of the five most severe mass extinction in the Phanerozoic, 

the Triassic Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary ca. 200 Ma ago (McHone, 2002; Pálfy, 2003). Marzoli et al. 

(2004) suggested that the CAMP volcanism in Morocco preceded the Tr-J boundary, and thus can be 

responsible for the associated biotic crisis. Such hypothesis is based on the presence of short 

geomagnetic reversals recorded in the Moroccan CAMP lava (Knight et al. 2004) correlated by the 

authors to the E23r anomaly of the Newark basin, USA (Kent and Olsen, 1999). However, the primary 

origin of these magnetic reversals has been recently challenged by the results brought during my 

bachelor scientific project and published in Font et al. (2011). In this work the authors demonstrated 

that the negative polarities are actually the product of remagnetization and hydrothermal processes. 

The debate remains open. 

Paleomagnetic techniques may be conducted on CAMP’s outcrops not only to study its possible 

relation to the Tr-J biological crisis, but more importantly, to infer the position and kinematic 

evolution of the continental plates contemporaneous with the eruption of these major magmatic 

province (Osete et al., 2011; Martínez et al., 2012; Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006; Osete and Palencia-

Ortas, 2006).   Even though the evolution of major plates, since Pangea break-up, is well known and 

constrained (Besse and Courtillot, 2002; Torsvik et al., 2008) paleoreconstruction of micro plates such 

Iberia is still problematic (Osete et al., 2011; Palencia-Ortas, 2006, Vissers and Meijer 2012; Neres et 

al., 2012). Neres et al. (2012) made a rigorous selection of paleomagnetic poles for the Iberian plate 

from Cretaceous to Late Jurassic ages and concluded that the Iberian Apparent Polar Wander Path 

(APWP) is coincident with the Global APWP of Torsvik et al. (2008) for ages younger than 120 Ma, 

but fails toward older ages. The lack of reliable paleomagnetic poles and precise radiometric ages, as 

well as uncertainties about Euler poles deduced from marine magnetic anomalies may be the source of 

this misfit for the interval of interest (~200Ma). For example, the only reliable paleomagnetic pole for 

the Iberian plate at 200 Ma is the Messejana pole (Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006). Thus, new reliable 

paleomagnetic poles are needed. 

The aim of this work is to conduct a new rock magnetic and paleomagnetic  study on  CAMP lava’s 

from the Algarve basin in order to: i) verify if the magnetic mineralogy of these rock is suitable for 

paleomagnetic investigation, ii) to test for the presence of E23r anomaly and iii)provide a new 

paleomagnetic pole for Iberia at 200 Ma. To reach these objectives, approximately 300 samples were 

collected from nine sites distributed along an E-W transect from Sagres (western Portugal) to 

Ayamonte (Spain). Field trips consist in three excursions of five days, which has been funded by FCT 

(IMPACTO: ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010). Magnetic measurements were conducted at the 

Paleomagnetic laboratory of IDL (Lisbon). Results provided a stable remanent magnetization, 

probably contemporaneous with the cooling of the CAMP lavas. However, the newly founded pole is 

significantly different from the referenced Messejana pole due to the presence of two different and 

well-constrained VGP’s distribution. One of the distributions, “A component”, is close to the reference 

pole, but the other, “B component”, is significantly different from the Messejana pole or any pole from 

the Iberian APWP. This misfit is interpreted as the result of significant pos-eruption tectonic 

movements. Finally, the results bring new insights to discuss the age and duration of CAMP 

volcanism in Portugal as well as its correlations with CAMP sections cropping out in Morocco and 

USA.

2. Geological settings and previous works 

2.1 CAMP (Global distribution) 

The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is one of the largest flood basalt provinces known 

in the Phanerozoic, with an average volume greater than 2 1 
 
km

 
 and a peak activity at ~200 Ma, 

thus identified as the trigger of the mass extinction that brands the Tr-J boundary (Marzoli et al., 1999; 

Verati et al., 2007). It is associated with the breakup of the supercontinent, Pangea. CAMP volcanism 

is mainly represented by sills, lava flows and tholeiitic dykes characterized by low TiO2 

concentrations, and relatively low SiO2. CAMP lava flows can be found across four continents: 

Northeastern South America and Eastern North America, Northwestern Africa and Southwestern 

Europe (Fig. 1a). Geochemical data from these different continents suggests that CAMP lavas are 

mostly similar in composition (Marzoli et al., 1999; Marzoli et al., 2004).

across four continents. The gray line delimits the probable extent of CAMP lavas at the time of its 
extrusion. (B) Simplified geological map of Iberia. (C)  Map of southern Portugal. The dark lines 

indicate the main representations of CAMP, which includes the Messejana dyke and the Algarve and 
Santiago do Cacém’s basins. The balloons at the Algarve’s basin represent the sampling locations.  

One of the best preserved and complete CAMP lava sequence (with outcrops thickness reaching 300 

m) are found in Morocco, northwestern Africa and at the Newark basin, eastern North America. In 

Morocco, four primary units from CAMP volcanism were perfectly distinguished: The lower unit, 

intermediate unit, upper unit and recurrent unit (Knight et al., 2004; Marzoli et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). 

In Newark basin, a thick and complete section was recovered and represents nowadays the best 

geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) covering the late Triassic- earlier Jurassic period (Kent and 

Olsen 1999).  The Tr-J boundary is assumed to be at ~202 Ma at the superchrone E24n, but the oldest 

CAMP lavas are identified ~40 kyr above this boundary, obviously refuting the role of CAMP on the

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma.

mass extinction (Kent and Olsen 1999) (Fig. 2). These authors also identified a very short reversal 

polarity (E23r) just below the Tr-J boundary, allegedly found on CAMP lavas in Morocco and 

correlated to the reversal E23r (Knight et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). This discovery would put an end on the 

recurrent discussion about whether or not CAMP was the trigger of the mass extinction. However, on 

my degree project and further published article, (Font et al., 2011) we were able to prove that the 

reversal found by Knight et al. (2004) was due to chemical remagnetization.

found by Knight et al., 2004 and its comparison with the Newark basin. On the left, is presented the 

magnetostratigraphy of Argana basin and its comparison with the Newark basin. The reverse “V” 
represents the CAMP lavas. The white boxes represent clay. 

 

Recent studies conducted at the Argana basin reveals that the oldest CAMP lavas found at the Newark 

basin are correlated to the second pulse of CAMP volcanism (intermediate unit) found at Morocco, 

which means that the first volcanic pulse (lower unit) have not reached US and puts the oldest CAMP 

lavas of Morocco at ~20kyr above the Tr-J boundary instead (Deneen et al., 2010) (Fig. 2). The 

authors support the hypothesis of Phanerozoic mass extinction due to the emplacement of this LIP.  

 

2.2 CAMP (Portuguese basins: studied area) 

The preserved CAMP lava flows in Portugal are found at the Algarve basin, at the Santiago do Cacém 

basin (Fig. 1c) and in the Spanish Central System, where is located the Messejana dyke (Verati et al., 

2007; Palencia- Ortas et al., 2006). 

The Algarve and Santiago do Cacém basins comprises a basal sequence of continental sediments, 

namely siltstones and limestones of Hettangian age (Youbi et al., 2003) on which CAMP volcanic 

products were emplaced among thin layers of limestones and dolomites, suggesting synchronism 

between the volcanism and sedimentation (Martins et al., 2007).  At the top of the sequence, the

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       4 

volcanic products are covered by a thick Early Jurassic limestone layer. These volcanic products are 

mostly represented by subaerial lava flows, pyroclastic deposits and peperites (Martins et al., 2007) 

(Fig. 3).   

In terms of geochemical composition, the Portuguese lava flows are classified as low Ti- tholeiitic 

basalts enriched in large ion lithophile elements, which suggests partial melting of heterogeneous 

mantle sources (Martins et al., 2007). Comparison with the Moroccan sequence suggests that Algarve 

basin outcrops are relatively homogeneous and similar to the Moroccan intermediate and upper unit 

(Marzoli et al., 2004; Rapaille et al., 2002) (Fig. 3). Recent 40Ar/39Ar data on the Portuguese volcanic 

units yields an age close to the Tr-J boundary with a mean value of 198.1 ±0.4 Ma. This age is 

correlated to the recurrent unit of the Moroccan basins and suggests a synchronous rifting and 

volcanism on both Southwestern Europe and Northeastern Africa (Marzoli et al., 2004; Verati et al., 

2007).  

The SW-NE oriented dyke of the Messejana (Fig. 1b) is also coeval with the age of the CAMP’s 

outcrops (202.8 2.0 Ma).It comprises dolerite intrusions that obliquely cut the Hercynian basement 
for more than 530 km from South Portugal (Alentejo) to Central Spain (Avila). Palencia Ortas et al. 

(2006), conducted a paleomagnetic study on 40 sites within the dyke which yielded a reliable 

paleomagnetic pole for the Iberian microplate at: Plat=70.4º, Plong=237.6ºE (K=47.9, A95=3.5º). 

However, no paleomagnetic investigation has been conducted in the Portuguese CAMP lavas yet.

3. Sampling 

Samples were collected at nine sites within the E-W elongated Algarve basin using a portable 

gasoline-powered drill and oriented using a magnetic and solar compass. Eight to nine cylinders were 

collected at nine localities (e.g. “sites”, Fig. 1c).  The samples collected in the field were subsequently 

cut in the laboratory into standard specimens (2.2 cm in length   2.5 cm in diameter) yielding 280 
samples for future paleomagnetic measurements (Fig. 4).

separation between two different lava layers, useful to estimate bedding corrections (at the bottom). 

4. Methods 

4.1 Petrography 

Petrographic analyses were carried out in fresh specimens in order to discriminate the mineral content 

and textural features. Thin sections of a selected paleomagnetic sites (AA, AL, SB, FP; Fig.1c) were 

performed at the geology department’s laboratory to later on be observed on an optical microscope 

under the supervision of Dr. Línia Martins.  

4.2 Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM)  

Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) is one of the most used rock magnetic technique to 

identify the magnetic minerals present in a sample based on their coercivity. Common mineral such as 

magnetite or pyrrotite (ferromagnetic) have low coercivity values, whereas antiferromagnetic minerals 

such as hematite and goethite have much higher coercivity values. Furthermore, the amplitude of the 

magnetization saturation (SIRM) informs about the concentration of these magnetic minerals for a 

fixed volume.    

Robertson &amp;amp; France (1994) and Kruiver et al (2001) showed that IRM acquisition curve theoretically 

follow a log normal distribution and are cumulative in intensity. The authors suggested that IRM 

curves can be approximated by a cumulative log-Gaussian (CLG) function, described by 3 parameters: 

B1/2, SIRM and DP. DP is the dispersion parameter which reflects the distribution of the apparent 



Paleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       6 

coercivities of a mineral phase and which can be interpreted in terms of homogeneity/heterogeneity of 

grain size and/or composition of a set of sample. Since IRM curve is the sum of each individual 

CLG’s functions, this method allow the discrimination of each magnetic phase in the case of mixture. 

For example, basalts are frequently constituted by magnetite and hematite, which can be easily 

identify using the CLG function. 

Representative samples were previously demagnetized by an alternated magnetic field (AF) at 100 mT 

and further submitted to a progressive uniaxial and constant magnetic field up to 1 T at constant 

temperature, using a pulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific IM-10-30). For the CLG treatment we used the 

Kruiver et al (2001) software which allows fitting (by tentative and error) of B1/2, SIRM and DP values 

on a linear (LAP), gradient (GAP) and probability (SAP) scale. If more than one mineral phase is 

present, it is expected the theoretical curves to be fitted by more than one component. 

 

4.3 Thermomagnetic Analysis 

Thermomagnetic curves were performed in order to identify the ferromagnetic minerals based on their 

Curie temperature. Curie (Néel) temperature is unique for a particular mineral and therefore is 

commonly used to identify its composition. For example, magnetite has Curie temperature of 580ºC 

and can also be identified at low temperature measurements by its Verwey transition in the case of 

very fine grained magnetite (a hump in magnetic susceptibility at ~-120ºC due to atoms 

rearrangements). Magnetite with higher content of titanium (Ti-rich titanomagnetite) has lower Curie 

temperatures on the order of ~200ºC whereas for a Ti-poor titanomagnetite Curie temperatures are 

~560ºC. Hematite, on the other hand, has Néel temperatures (the equivalent of Curie temperature for 

antiferromagnetic minerals) much higher than magnetite (~680ºC) and its titanium content also 

influences its Néel temperature.  

Magnetic susceptibility is measured at high and low temperature. The low temperature (LT) 

measurements are performed on a CS-L cryostat apparatus which uses liquid nitrogen to cool down 

the equipment. Magnetic susceptibility is measured while the apparatus is warming up from -192ºC 

(e.g., temperature of the liquid nitrogen) up to the room temperature. The high temperature (HT) 

measurements are performed on a CS4 furnace in an Argon controlled atmosphere from the room 

temperature until 700ºC. Subsequently, magnetic susceptibility is measured while the equipment is 

cooling down from 700ºC to room temperature. Both measurements were performed using a MFK1 

Kappabridge at the Laboratory of Paleomagnetism of the IDL. Data were treated by the Cureval 8.0 

(AGICO) software. Later on, an approach to calculate the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic minerals 

presented on the rock is performed using the inverse susceptibility method proposed by Petrovský and 

Kapricka (2006). 

 

4.4 Hysteresis data 

The ferromagnetic minerals have a unique capacity to record the direction of an applied magnetic 

field. Unlike paramagnetic or diamagnetic minerals, when the applied field is removed, the 

ferromagnetic minerals will not return to zero and the offset from the origin is called magnetization of 

remanence, Mrs which is a record of the applied magnetic field. The path of the magnetization, J with 

respect to the applied field, H is perfectly explained by the so called Hysteresis loop. 

Hysteresis parameters have been extensively used to unravel the grain size of the magnetic carriers. 

The Day plot was first proposed by Day et al. (1977) and is widely used in paleomagnetism to 

discriminate the domain state (single domain, SD; pseudo-single domain, PSD; multidomain, MD) of 

the magnetic carriers. It is based on the ratio of hysteresis parameters (Mrs/Ms ? Hcr/Hc) where Mrs is 

the maximum saturation remanence; Ms is the maximum saturation magnetization; Hcr is the remanent 

coercive force (e.g. the field needed to reduce Mrs to zero) and  c is the bulk coercivity. The 

theoretical bounds of the Day plot are defined by: Mrs/Ms&gt;0.5 and Hcr/Hc&lt;5 for the SD region; 0.5&gt; 

Mrs/Ms&gt;0.05 and 1.5&amp;lt;Hcr/Hc&lt;5 for the PSD region and Mrs/Ms&lt;0.02 and Hcr/Hc&gt;5 for the MD region.

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       7 

The importance of this method relies on the necessity to know whether or not the paleomagnetic 

samples contain SD magnetite since the latter are the best recorder of the ancient Earth’s magnetic 

field. This is because SD and even PSD (pseudo-single-domain) particles have higher coercive force, 

 c than MD grains (Butler 1996).  

More recently, Dunlop et al., 2002 developed a theoretical day plot curve for magnetite for each 

domain state and admixtures of magnetic grains (MD+SD; SD+SP). The main problems related to 

these theoretical curves rely on the fact that the hysteresis parameters are not exclusively a function of 

the domain state. Mineral composition, mixture of different minerals or minerals with different 

domain state, thermal activation and magnetostatic interaction may lead to erroneous interpretations of 

Day diagrams. 

Roberts et al. (2000) developed a new method to discriminate the domain states, claiming that the use 

of Day plot diagrams can often leads to misinterpretations of the data. In this article, Roberts et al. 

(2000) present a new tool (FORC diagrams) not only to identify the magnetic domains (SD, SP, PSD 

and MD grains) but also to reveal whether or not magnetic interaction is present. FORC’s diagrams 

are obtained after submitting a sample to a saturating magnetic field ( b) and then, decrease the field 

to a reversal magnetic field (Ha). First Order Reversal Curves (FORC) is defined as the resultant 

magnetization curve between Ha and Hb. This measurement was repeated for different reversal fields 

yielding a set of FORC (for each reversal field) that fills the inside of a hysteresis loop. The FORC 

diagram, mostly used, is a contour plot of a FORC distribution displayed on a Hu [Hu=(Ha+Hb)/2] 

versus Hc [Hc=(Hb-Ha)/2] plot, where Hc represents the coercive force of the magnetic grains on the 

specimen and Hu is the local interaction field. 

For the present study, hysteresis measurements and FORC diagram were performed at nine 

characteristic samples from each paleomagnetic site. The measurements were performed using a 

Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) with a maximum applied field of 1T at the University of 

Marie Curie, Paris. Dunlop’s theoretical curves are used for comparison of hysteresis parameter. 

 

4.5 AF cleaning 

The specimens were subjected to a progressive alternating magnetic field (AF demagnetization) using 

a LDA-3A demagnetizer from 0 (Natural Remanent Magnetization, NRM) up to 100 mT. This process 

is used to eliminate low-field secondary magnetizations that the rock might have acquired subsequent 

to its formation and to identify the direction of the original remanent magnetization recorded in the 

rock during its formation. At each AF demagnetization step, the remanence is measured using a JR6 

magnetometer. Principal Component Analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) and Fisher statistic (Fisher, 1953) 

are then used to calculate the direction of the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM). These 

calculations are made by using the REMASOFT software (AGICO). 

A total of 280 specimens were submitted to AF cleaning for which 257 specimens gave reliable 

directions that were used to calculate the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM). Erroneous 

data “Outliers” were eliminated using the Vandamme (1994) cutoff angle method which is based on a 

recursive method that optimizes the probability of finding the true mean direction.  

The paleomagnetic pole is calculated either using mean ChRM direction computed for all samples or 

for all sites. Reliability of the final paleomagnetic pole is evaluated using the Q criteria of Van der 

Voo (1990). Comparison of the paleomagnetic pole with other referenced pole is made by using the 

McFadden and Lowes (1981) test.

5. Results 

This section will be subdivided into two main groups: magnetic mineralogy and paleomagnetic results. 

The first approach is to show if the primary magnetic mineralogy has been preserved since rock 

formation or if it has been altered by chemical processes. Paleomagnetic results will provide new 

geochronological data (through the magnetic polarity recorded by the rocks; e.g. magnetostratigraphy) 

and a new paleomagnetic pole and its eventual use for paleogeographic reconstructions will be 

discussed by comparison with the key pole of the Messejana dyke and CAMP lavas from Morocco. 

5.1 Magnetic mineralogy 

Rock magnetic studies are essential to identify the dominant magnetic carriers presented in 

paleomagnetic specimens. It is of extreme importance to infer whether or not there is preservation of 

the primary magnetization otherwise, the paleomagnetic studies would be useless to reconstruct the 

global paleogeography of the Earth plates.   

In this subsection, powerful tools are used to constrain the nature, grain-size, origin and type of 

ferromagnetic minerals characteristic of the CAMP basalts from Portugal, namely: petrography, IRM 

(Isothermal Remanent Magnetization), Thermomagnetic analysis and Day plot and FORC’s (First 

Order Reversal Curves). 

5.1.1 Petrography 

Algarve lava flows are porphyritic rocks with a characteristic aphanitic texture, mainly due to its fast 

cooling which prevent the growth of the minerals. The samples are characterized by the presence of 

few phenocrystals developed in a matrix of finer grains. The samples showed a simple mineralogy 

mainly dominated by plagioclase, clinoperoxenes, feldspaths and opaque minerals (Fig. 5). 

The opaque crystals correspond to ferromagnetic minerals. Their preserved subeuedric morphology 

suggests primary origin.

5.1.2 IRM acquisition curves 

A total of 34 samples (2 to 12 per paleomagnetic site) were analyzed. All studied samples display a 

similar behavior during the gradual acquisition of uniaxial isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). 

Saturation (SIRM) in most samples is reached below 100mT suggesting a low coercive phase as the 

dominant magnetic carrier (magnetite?) despite the presence of a higher coercive phase (hematite?) at 

few samples which do not attain saturation (Fig. 6).

SIRM values vary between 130 A/m (SB1.C3) to 500 A/m (AL1.B2) and reflect significant 

differences in concentrations of ferromagnetic minerals (Fig. 6A; Table 1). Once representing IRM 

data on a logarithmic scale for the induced field (H in mT; Fig. 6B) significant differences in B1/2 

values (field needed to reach half of the saturation) are observed ranging from 16.2 mT (HT2.E2) to 

53.7 mT (AA1.E4; Table 1). 

After treatment by the cumulative log-Gaussian function (CLG) using the Kruiver’s software (Kruiver 

et al., 2001), it is shown that almost all samples display a unimodal distribution, despite the presence 

of bimodal distribution at some samples (Fig. 6C; Fig. 6D). The unimodal distribution (e.g. JG1.B2; 

Fig 6C) is characterized by a single Gaussian curve for which SIRM values lie between 240 A/m 

(QO.F2) and 500 A /m (AL1.B2; Table 1) and the mean coercivity fields with ranges of 16.2 mT 

(HT2.E2) to 52.5 mT (QO.F2). Through the values of SIRM and bulk coercivity of this distribution, it 

is possible to infer that the mineral presented in those samples is of low coercive phase, possibly 

magnetite (Dunlop and Özdemir, 1997; Lowrie, 1997). 

 

Table 1: SIRM, B1/2 and DP estimates for characteristic samples using the Kruiver software 

 
 

Bimodal distributions are also found at some samples. (e.g. SB1.C3; Fig. 6D) Non-saturated curve is 

easily observable on GAP and SAP diagrams. As IRM acquisition curve are linearly added, if more 

than one magnetic phase is present, mixtures are immediately denoted by the presence of more than 

one Gaussian curve (GAP diagram) and deflections of the distribution (SAP diagram). Two magnetic 

phases are present: a low coercivity phase, with SIRM values on the hundreds order and coercivity 

values similar to those found at the unimodal distribution. This low coercive phase, presented in all 

samples, is thought to be magnetite and contributes with more than 80 % to the total remanence while 

the higher magnetic phase reaches  ~20% maximum of the IRM signal (Fig. 6E). The higher coercive 

phase is characterized by much lower SIRM values ranging from 16 A/m (RL2.G3) to 36 A/m 

(AA1.E4; Table 1) and coercivities significantly higher than the low coercive phase, ranging between 

251.2 mT (RL1.E3; AA1.E4) to 275.4 mT (RL2.G3). The strong similarity of B1/2 and DP values for 

both component 1 and component 2 in all specimens suggests the presence of homogeneous 

populations of the soft (lower coercivity) and hard (high coercivity) magnetic fractions in terms of 

composition and grain size (Fig. 6E). The CLG parameters of the Portuguese CAMP lavas are strongly 

similar to those found in the CAMP lavas from Morocco (Font et al., 2011) confirming primary 

(magmatic) origin for these minerals.

5.1.3 Thermomagnetic Analysis  

Considering that several minerals such as magnetite and pyrrhotite, goethite and hematite have similar 

maximum coercivities, (Lowrie, 1997) interpretation of IRM acquisition curves alone, cannot be used 

to identify the composition of the magnetic carriers. In order to do that thermomagnetic analyses of 

representative samples (1 per paleomagnetic site). Just like IRM measurements, among all the 

measured thermomagnetic curves, merely two different behaviors are found and illustrated (Fig. 7). 

 

Figure 7: Low and High temperature thermomagnetic curves (on the left) and the respective inverse 
susceptibility method (on the right).

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       12 

Curie temperatures are calculated using the inversion method of Petrovský and Kapricka (2006). 

According to Curie temperatures, two distinct groups of samples can be recognized. Group A, (e.g. 

SB3-A; QO-H; RL2-F; Fig. 7) characterized by a single ferromagnetic phase with Curie Temperatures 

ranging from 564.9º to 577.6ºC (Fig. 7), compatible with Ti-poor titanomagnetite (Dunlop and 

Özdemir 1997). The positive alteration index characteristic of this group suggests formation of new 

mineral during the heating process, most likely magnetite (Hrouda et al., 2002; Hrouda 2003). Group 

B, (e.g. AY1-B; AL1-C; AA1-C; Fig. 7) characterized by the presence of at least two magnetic phases 

where Ti-poor titanomagnetite is the dominant with Curie temperatures ranging from 554ºC to 583ºC. 

A hump at ~240ºC to 320ºC is observed during the heating process (AA1-C; AY1-B; AL1-C; Fig.7) 

but is no longer observed on the cooling curve (Fig. 7).  This behavior is interpreted as the result of 

titanomaghemite instability during heating (Dunlop and Özdemir 1997) resulting on the inversion to a 

multiphase mixture of magnetite, ilmenite, pseudobrokite and other minerals (Dunlop and Özdemir 

1997, Özdemir, 1987). The positive alteration index in some samples, suggest the inversion of 

titanomaghemite into newly formed magnetite (AA1-C; Fig. 7) while others (AY1-B; AL1-C; Fig. 7) 

are characterized by negative alteration index which suggests the disintegration of the original mineral 

phase into lower susceptibility residual phase (Hrouda et al., 2002).  

Verwey transition is present in all samples (Fig. 7) and branded by the typical hump at ~ -150ºC, 

characteristic of structural changes on magnetite (Dunlop and Özdemir 1997, Özdemir et al, 1993). 

The magnitude of the Verwey transition for the samples on the group A is markedly higher than for 

the samples on the group B. As the samples from the group B suffered from low-oxidation processes, 

(i.e. maghemetization) the Verwey transition is suppressed which leads to this clear difference on the 

magnitude of the transition in both groups (Özdemir et al., 1993).  

 

5.1.1 Hysteresis data 

Coercivity and remanence ratios (Mrs/Mr and Hcr/Hc) were plotted on the theoretical curve of Dunlop 

et al. (2002) (Fig. 8). All data fall on the left region of the SD and MD mixture of the modified day 

plot (Dunlop, 2002) with values ranging between 1.86 and 3.42 for the coercivity ratios and between 

0.07 and 0.25 for the remanence ratios (Fig. 8).

mixing curves (Dunlop, 2002)

scale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. 

Susana Fernandes       13 

 It is interesting to note that all SB samples have the lowest remanence ratios and the highest 

coercivity ratios while all FP samples closely follows the SD+MD mixing curves toward higher 

remanence ratios. According to the literature, this could mean that FP samples have magnetites with 

lower grain size than SB samples. On the other hand, AL samples apparently have a larger range of 

grain sizes. This SD+MD mixture is typical of basalts which cools fast enough so that the grain size of 

the opaque minerals is typically of few µm but also may carry larger grains due to growth when the 

lava flows are thick enough. 

 

5.1.1 FORC’s 

Three characteristic FORC diagrams are shown which are representative of the typical behaviors 

found on the 6 analyzed samples (Fig. 9). 

 

Figure 9: FORC diagrams for characteristic samples.

Susana Fernandes       14 

AL1-H sample (Fig. 9) displays a narrow distribution, slightly above the origin of the magnetic 

interacting field (Hu), suggesting the existence of interaction between the magnetic particles. The 

mean coercivity field (Hc) value has a peak distribution at ~17 mT, which is slightly below of what is 

expected for a pure SD magnetite (Dunlop and Özdemir, 1997, Muxworthy et al., 2002). The 

displacement of Hc to lower values and the presence of vertical contours in the lower-left part of 

FORC’s distribution, (practically parallel to Hu axis) suggest magnetic interactions between SP and 

SD particles. Conversely, FP1-D (Fig. 9) displays a typical non-interacting SD particle with close 

contours at Hu=0 and a peak distribution of coercivity field at ~20mT. However, the presence of a 

second peak at the origin (Hi=0 and Hc=0) with a shape similar to AL1-H leads to the conclusion that 

SP particles are also present in this sample. 

SB1-H sample (Fig. 9) is very similar with AL1-H sample (Fig. 9). The largest displacement toward 

lower coercivity field values (~7 mT) and a slight shift above Hu=0 suggests that SP and SD particles 

are present on the sample, both with similar intensities.  

All FORC’s distributions suggest a SD+SP mixture for the analyzed samples. Conversely, day plots 

strongly follow the SD+MD trend, but on these samples, there are no evidences of MD-like behavior. 

In order to verify if SP particles are present, such has been suggested by FORC analysis, we have 

conducted Kfd analysis. The Kfd is a proxy to evaluate the contribution of superparamagnetic particles 

within the bulk mineralogy (Dearing et al., 1999). For low frequency measurements (klf), the SP 

grains close to the boundary of SD grains, contributes to the bulk susceptibility whilst at high 

frequency measurements (khf) does not. Our results show no SP contribution, consistent with Day plot 

results (Table A1). 

 

5.2 Paleomagnetic Results 

A total of 280 samples were demagnetized at the IDL laboratory using AF treatment. Most samples 

yielded stable demagnetization patterns at high fields. More than 90% of the remanence is 

demagnetized between 40 mT (JG samples) and 100 mT, (SB samples) suggesting a low to medium 

coercive phase as the dominant magnetic carrier (Fig. 10). 

Zijderveld diagrams (orthogonal diagrams) show the presence of two magnetic components: a high 

field remanence projected to the origin of the diagrams, and a lower coercivity component, interpreted 

as a secondary viscous (VRM) magnetization which is successfully removed with fields lower than 20 

mT (Fig. 10). 

Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) intensity lies between 0.4 A/m to 13.5 A/m, typical of 

basalts (Dunlop and Özdemir, 1997), despite the wide range of intensity which may be due to 

superficial chemical alteration and to error associated to the volume of samples (some samples being 

fractured).  

From the 280 samples, 257 were used to calculate the characteristic magnetic component (ChRM). 

Outliers were excluded based on the Vandamme (1994) cut-off by using the rotepole software 

(Ultreicht). All magnetic directions are positive (normal) with mean inclinations of 40º to 45º (Fig. 

11). Mean ChRM (characteristic remanent magnetization) were calculated based on samples (sample-

based mean direction) and on average direction per paleomagnetic site (site-based mean direction) 

(Table 3). Tilt corrections were applied to the data in order to correct for eventual post-tectonic 

movements. Tilt corrected sample-based mean direction yields: Dec=353.4º and Inc=52.8º (N=257, 

a95=1.5º, k=35.8) (Fig. 11B, left). Tilt corrected site-based mean direction yields: Dec=0º and 

Inc=50.4º (N=8, a95=8.3º, k=45.6) (Fig. 11B, right). After tilt correction (Fig. 11B) the dispersion 

parameter k is significantly higher (i.e. lower dispersion; k=45.6) than the non-corrected data (k=23.2; 

Fig. 11A) suggesting a pre-tectonic origin for the magnetization. 

The paleomagnetic pole for the Portuguese CAMP basalts is calculated based on sample-and site-

based mean directions, yielding: Plat=83.3º, Plong=236.1º (A95=1.8º; K=25.9) and Plat=84.4º, 

Plong=177.9º (A95=9.8º; K=32.9), respectively. For the calculation of the site-based pole, a Virtual

Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) is calculated for each paleomagnetic site, yielding a total of nine VGP’s. 

Since the VGP’s of the Ayamonte outcrops give unreliable directions (probably due to complex 

tectonics and deformation), only eight of these nine VGP’s were selected (Table 3; Fig. 11C, right).

projection (on the left) and orthogonal projections and remanence intensity versus the demagnetizing 

field (on the right) 

The fact that the site-based mean pole present high values of A95 is probably due to the existence of 

two distinct groups of direction (A and B components; c.f. Fig. 11), which are discussed later. 

In order to check for the quality of a paleomagnetic pole, Van Der Voo (1990) proposed a useful set of 

seven reliability criteria, constituting the so-called Q-criteria (Table 2). Our new paleomagnetic pole 

passes 4 of the 7 criteria of Van Der Voo (1990), namely: 

1. An accurate radiometric age for CAMP lavas provided by Verati et al. (2007); 

2. Sufficient number of samples and adequate statistic parameters; 

3. Adequate demagnetization (Fig. 10); 

4. There is no overlap with poles from younger ages (Fig. 13); 

Three criteria’s are not fulfilled because: i) field tests are not conductible due to bad field exposure, ii) 

The structural and tectonic relations between Algarve basin and the Iberian plate are complexes and

poorly constrained by geological evidences and iii) CAMP volcanism occurred at ~200 Ma which is 

coincident with a large interval of normal magnetic polarities (Kent and Olsen, 1999; Fig. 2) and 

therefore, the presence of reversals is unlikely. However, we propose to substitute the reversal Q-

criteria by our detailed magnetic mineralogy study, giving Q=5. A paleomagnetic pole with Q&gt;3 is 

considered reliable.

6. Discussion 

The results presented here give us new clues to i) investigate if the magnetic mineralogy of the 

Portuguese CAMP lava is preserved and suitable to provide a new paleomagnetic pole for Iberia at 

200 Ma, ii) to test if this newly found pole is reliable for paleogeographic reconstructions, and iii) to 

provide magnetostratigraphic data for global-scale correlations with other CAMP section worldwide. 

6.1 Magnetic mineralogy of the Portuguese CAMP lavas 

Rock magnetic studies are essentials to understand the type and domain of the ferromagnetic mineral 

within the rock, but mostly, they are crucial to check if the samples are suitable for paleomagnetic 

studies. Despite the severe alteration of the entire Algarve’s basin region already reported by previous 

geochemical studies (Martins et al., 2007; Verati et al., 2007) primary NRM directions seems to have 

been preserved. 

Rock magnetic experiments conducted on the Portuguese CAMP lavas indicate the presence of a low 

to medium coercivity mineral, despite the accessory contribution of a higher coercivity in some 

samples (Fig. 6). The low to medium coercive phase corresponds to fine Ti-poor titanomagnetite as 

shown by typical Curie temperatures of 560º-580ºC (Fig.7). Thermomagnetic analysis clearly shows a 

Verwey transition at around -150ºC characteristic of magnetite. Presence of maghemite is also 

identified based on its inversion temperature observed at ~250-350ºC in some samples (Fig. 7). 

However, hematite is not depicted in our thermomagnetic curves indicating that it may be present only 

in very low content (Fig. 7). 

Hysteresis parameters plotted on the modified Day plot (Dunlop, 2002) follow the trend of SD-MD 

magnetite (Fig. 8). FORC’s data rather suggests a SD+SP assemblage (Fig. 9). Kfd measurements 

conducted on characteristic samples yielded no SP contribution and led to the conclusion that SP 

contribution is minor in our samples.  

In conclusion, the magnetic mineralogy of the Portuguese CAMP is mainly controlled by fine Ti-poor 

titanomagnetite and accessorily maghemite and hematite depending on the oxidation state of the 

samples. Such mineralogy is typical of extrusive basalts of continental rifting (Dunlop and Özdemir, 

1997) and we thus conclude that these rocks are good candidate for paleomagnetic studies.  

6.2 Paleomagnetic reconstructions of Iberia at 200 Ma 

Paleomagnetism is the unique geophysics tool that allows plate tectonic reconstruction for times older 

that ~180 Ma (i.e. the age of the oldest oceanic crust). It is based on the principle that inclination of the 

magnetization depends on the latitude of the plate (i.e. the so-called dipole law of the Geocentric 

Dipole Axial) and that the drift of a plate can be reconstructed by the drift of the corresponding 

paleomagnetic poles. Therefore, by comparing the paleomagnetic pole drift, called Apparent Polar 

Wander Path (APWP), of two distinct plates and at different times allow us to constrain the kinematic 

of plate tectonics. The best example is the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the separation of Europe 

with North America (Fig. 12). 

The problematic concerning the Iberian plate is that it’s APWP its poorly constrained, notably for our 

interval of interest (Neres et al., 2012; Osete et al., 2011). Indeed, the unique high-quality 

paleomagnetic pole for Iberia at 200 Ma is the Messejana pole (Palencia-Ortas et al 2006; Osete et al., 

2011) (Fig. 13).  

When comparing our paleomagnetic poles with the APWP of Iberia computed from a compilation of 

Neres et al. (2012) and Osete et al. (2011), there is an overlap of the site-based mean pole with poles 

of younger age but the sample-based mean pole does not show any resemblance (Fig. 13).  Anyhow, it 

is obvious that neither sample-based nor site-based paleomagnetic pole from this study show an 

overlap with the reference pole from the Messejana dyke (Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006). The partial 

resemblance with the poles from younger ages (70 Ma, 80 Ma, 180 Ma; Fig 12) is probably due to 

large a95 values of the site-based mean pole.

(open circles). The solid square represents the Euler pole to reconstruct the APWP path of each plate; 
b) Middle Jurassic paleogeographic reconstruction of North America and Europe (c.f. Butler 1996). 

By comparing our individual CAMP lava VGP’s with individual VGP’s from the Messejana dyke 

(Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006), we have found that this high dispersion is caused by the presence of two 

different VGP’s distributions (Fig. 14). On one hand, there are four VGP’s from this study (SB, QO, 

 T and JG) that fall within the Messejana VGP’s distribution, whereas the remaining 4 VGP’s (AL, 

AA, RL and FP; Fig. 14) are far from the mean direction of the first group and significantly distinct 

from Messejana VGP’s distribution. Note that the difference between the two groups of directions 

resides essentially in changes in declination values and that VGP’s from the B component directions 

are all geographically located at the central part of Algarve’s basin (Fig. 1).  

There are several hypotheses to explain the discrepancy between the directions of A and B 

components: Cretaceous remagnetization, different ages, lightning or tectonics. The Cretaceous 

remagnetization is excluded since there is no overlap between component B directions and the 

Cretaceous poles at 70 and 80 Ma (Fig. 13). The hypothesis of a different age for the component B is 

also unlikely because previous geochemical studies on Portuguese lava flows show a good agreement 

between the Moroccan basalts and the studied rocks, including local from component B (Marzoli et 

al., 2004). In addition, recent 
40

Ar/
39

Ar dating suggests that the lava flows from the Algarve basins are 

concordant with the 
40

Ar/
39

Ar ages of CAMP basalts from Moroccan basins (Verati et al., 2007). There 

is no significant difference between the age of the Alte lava outcrops (site AL here) and those from 

Santiago do Cacém and Tavira sites (Verati et al., 2007).  

Lighting is a physical mechanism that can remagnetize superficial rocks. In such a case, the intensity 

of the NRM is thought to be more than one order higher than the original NRM intensity. In our case 

there is no significant increase in NRM intensities when comparing component A and component B 

data suggesting that lighting is not the favored hypothesis to explain the discrepancy between 

component A and B.  

We rather suggest that significant tectonic movements on the central part of Algarve basin linked to 

complex movements on the São Marcos-Quarteira fault (SMQF) can produce significant deformations 

on the eastern part of the fault, accommodating various minor thrusts and folds (Terrinha, 1998). 

SMQF was reactivated during Mesozoic lithospheric extension and has been acting ever since.

6.3 Magnetostratigraphy of the Portuguese CAMP outcrops and its relationship 

with the Tr-J boundary 

The link between the severe mass-extinction that took place at the Triassic- Jurassic boundary (~200 

Ma) and the CAMP eruption is still very controversial. The problematic resides in the difficulty to date 

and correlate with accuracy the age of continental flood basalts from the CAMP lavas in continents 

and the age of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in marine sections (Knight et al., 2004; Marzoli et al., 

1999).  In the Newark basin (USA), previous studies placed the Tr-J boundary before the eruptions of 

the first CAMP lavas (Kent and Olsen 1999) suggesting that CAMP cannot be responsible for the Tr-J 

crisis. According to the authors, the onset of CAMP volcanism is proposed to occur ~40 yr after the 

Tr-J boundary. On the other hand, based on geochemical data and 
40

Ar/
39

Ar dating of individual flows 

from Morocco and Newark, Marzoli et al. (2004) showed that the lowest unit basalts found in the 

Newark basin is correlated to the intermediate unit in the Moroccan basin. This means that the 

discrepancy between the Tr-J boundary and the first lavas found in both basin is due to the inexistence 

of the lower unit CAMP on the Newark basin. 

Magnetostratigraphy has also been used to investigate the age and correlation of CAMP lavas from 

different continents. Magnetostratigraphic data of CAMP lavas from Newark basin and Moroccan 

basin encompasses a large interval of positive (normal) magnetic polarity, called the E24n chron. In 

Newark, Kent and Olsen (1999) identified a short interval of negative polarity located below the first 

CAMP lava and below the peak in spores interpreted by the authors to be the Tr-J boundary (Fig. 15). 

In Morocco, Knight et al. (2004) found a negative interval in the Intermediate unit of the Moroccan 

CAMP lavas, that the authors correlated to the E23r of Newark. Based on the presence of this reversal, 

Knight et al., (2004) suggested that the CAMP lavas in Morocco preceded the Tr-J boundary. 

However, these reversals were challenged by Font et al., (2011) who proved that they were result of 

chemical remagnetization. More recently Deenen et al. (2010) identified a negative shift in the C-

isotope values just before the basalts deposition suggesting that the first Moroccan CAMP lavas 

coincide with the Tr-J mass extinction (Fig. 15).

Here, we calculated a mean VGP for each individual flow (Fig. 16; Table A2). Seven sites with the 

corresponding VGP latitude variations are displayed (Fig. 16). All samples collected in the Algarve 

basin display a positive (normal) remanent magnetization, confirming previous magnetostratigraphic 

studies conducted on CAMP’s lavas worldwide (Kent et al., 1999; Deenen et al., 2 11; Font et al., 

2011). Considering that recent radio-isotopic ages have been conducted on Algarve’s outcrops and 

yielded a mean age of 198.1±0.4 Ma, (Verati et al., 2007) the positive interval found in all 

paleomagnetic sites is here correlated to the E24n Superchron (Fig. 15). No reverse anomaly has been 

found contrarily to Knight et al. (2004).  

Comparing the paleomagnetic (Dec and Inc) directions of successive lava flows also provide 

information about eruptions times (Chenet et al., 2009). In this study, we found no significant 

variations of paleomagnetic direction per site except for HT site that has two distinct volcanic pulses 

separated by a thin interval of dolomite (Fig. 16; Table A2). The remaining sites don’t display 

significant variations on paleomagnetic directions which led us to the conclusion that a single volcanic 

pulse is present. 

 

7. Conclusion 

The main findings of this study may be summarized as follows: 

1. Magnetic mineralogy indicates that the main magnetic carriers are primary Ti-poor 
titanomagnetite with accessorily presence of maghemite and hematite in some samples. Such 

mineralogy is typical of continental basalt and indicates that these rocks are good candidates 

for paleomagnetic study. 

2. AF cleaning provided stable demagnetization patters at high field which yielded normal 
polarities ChRM (Tilt corrected) located at: Dec=0º; Inc=52.8º; a95=9.8º, N=8. The 

corresponding pole is located at: Plat=84.4º, Plong=177.9º (K= 32.9; A95=9.8º) 

3. The lack of consistency of this pole with those obtained by Palencia-Ortas et al., (2006) is 
probably due to the existence of two different VGP’s distributions (component A and 

component B) that shifts the pole direction away from the Messejana pole. Component A 

shares the same distribution as the Messejana VGP’s, whereas component B does not share 

the same distribution. 

4. The origin of the discrepancy between component A and component B is attributed to tectonic 
movements on the central region of the Algarve basin. 

5. All Portuguese CAMP lavas encompass a normal magnetic polarity interval and no negative 
interval has been depicted. It confirms previous results by Font et al. (2011) that the E23r 

anomaly of the Newark basin is not recorded in the Moroccan and Portuguese CAMP lava 

flows. The normal polarity is correlated to the E24n chron. 

6. Short variations in VGP latitudes and longitude along individual lava flows suggests a 
relatively rapid cooling time. Except for the outcrops located near Sagres (HT) where two 

distinct pulses are separated by a thin (~1-2 m) interval of dolomite, most of the studied 

sections represent a single volcanic pulse.
