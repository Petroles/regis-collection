ABSTRACT:Analysis of recent geological and geochronolo-
gical data from the basement of the South American platform 
indicates that the Brasiliano orogenic collage took place in four 
distinct pulses: a) Early Cryogenian (ca. 800 – 740Ma); b) Late 
Cryogenian-Early Ediacaran (ca. 660 – 610 Ma); c) Early-Middle 
Ediacaran (c. 590 – 560 Ma); and d) Late Cambrian (520 – 500 
Ma). The first three pulses are well represented in most Neopro-
terozoic structural provinces in West Gondwana. The youngest 
orogenic phase/pulse, however, is only seen in Argentina (Pampe-
an Orogeny) and Brazil, in eastern Rio de Janeiro State (Búzios 
Orogeny). The period between ca. 750 and 500 Ma is compara-
ble to that reported for the amalgamation of various continental 
fragments in East (Arabian-Nubian, Mozambique, Kuunga) and 
North Gondwana (Cadomian). However, important differences 
in the nature and ages of events are recognized, which can be 
expected in view of the magnitude of Gondwana agglutination 
and the diversity of paleogeographic and tectonic scenarios. West 
Gondwana shows an interesting peculiarity: lithologically and 
tectonically diversified Tonian terranes underlie Brasiliano oro-
genic buildups. They were strongly reworked during most of the 
orogenic pulses. The Tonian terranes (1000 – 900 Ma) and their 
relation with Rodinia or with the processes of Gondwana fusion 
remains an open question. Indications of their presence in East 
Gondwana are still poorly documented.

collage; orogenic pulses; Tonian terranes.

RESUMO: Consoante os mais recentes dados geológicos e geocronológicos 
do embasamento da Plataforma Sul-Americana, a colagem orogênica Brasi-
liana se deu em quatro pulsos distintos: a) eocriogeniana (ca. 800 – 70Ma); 
b) tardicriogeniana-eoediacarana (ca. 660 – 610 Ma); c) eo-médio ediacarana 
(ca. 590 – 560 Ma) e d) tardicambriana (520 – 500 Ma). Os três primeiros 
pulsos da colagem apresentam boa representatividade na maioria das provín-
cias estruturais do Neoproterozóico, em todo Gondwana Ocidental. O último 
e mais jovem pulso orogênico constitui casos específicos locais registrados na 
Argentina (Orogenia Pampeana) e no Brasil, no leste do Rio de Janeiro (Oro-
genia Búzios). No cômputo geral, o intervalo de tempo (ca. 750 – 500 Ma) 
é comparável com o que é conhecido sobre o conjunto mais oriental (Árabe
-Nubiano, Moçambique, Kuunga) e norte de Gondwana  (Cadomiano), nos 
vários segmentos derivados deste supercontinente. No detalhe são encontra-
das diferenças importantes de eventos e idades entre os vários segmentos de 
Gondwana, o que é esperável diante da magnitude territorial da aglutinação 
do supercontinente e da natural diversidade dos cenários paleogeográficos e 
tectônicos. Em Gondwana Ocidental observa-se peculiaridade interessante: 
sotoposta aos edifícios orogênicos do Brasiliano e retrabalhada fortemente nos 
quatro pulsos principais, é encontrada série muito diversificada de terrenos 
do Toniano, em termos de rochas e proveniência tectônica. Estes terrenos 
(1000 – 900 Ma) e sua relação tanto com os processos da fusão de Rodinia 
como com os de aglutinação de Gondwana constituem um problema em 
aberto. Há algumas outras indicações, ainda muito pouco documentadas, da 
presença de tais terrenos em Gondwana Oriental.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last five decades the word “Brasiliano” has been 
loosely used to refer to many aspects of the Neoproterozoic 
geology of Brazil (e.g. cycle, orogeny, tectonic evolution, 
metamorphism, mobile belts, cratons, etc.).

When the first formal definitions were proposed (Cordani 
et al. 1968, Cordani et al. 1973, Almeida et al. 1973; Almeida 
e Hasui 1984), the term appeared as “Brasiliano cycle” (“Ciclo 
Brasiliano”), comprising the period from 700 to 450 Ma. 
These authors separated it from the pre-Neoproterozoic 
cycles, also defined in the early 70s  (e.g. the “Uruaçuano”, 
“Espinhaço”, and “Transamazonian” cycles). These seminal 
concepts were heavily based on Rb-Sr and K-Ar geochro-
nology, the only methods available at that time. The poor 
dating was made worse by the non-uniform availability of 
the data over the South American territory. These defini-
tions were also strongly biased by poor geological and geo-
tectonic knowledge, associated to the need to establish the 
timing of geological/geotectonic processes in South America 
(see a synthesis of original definitions in Brito Neves et al. 
1990, and in Tab. 1).

With the progress of systematic geological mapping, 
strongly supported by recent aerogeophysical surveys, and 
introduction of new isotopic and geochronological meth-
ods, especially Sm-Nd and U-Pb (Pb-Pb evaporation, TIMS, 
LA-ICPMS, SHRIMP), those concepts adopted during 
the last decades of the past century need to be reviewed 
and updated. As new data is being rapidly produced, new 
reviews may be necessary in the near future

The misuse of one of the older designations, the 
“Transamazonian” cycle (ca. 2,100 – 1,800 Ma), is per-
sistent in Brazilian literature. With the improvement of 
geological knowledge in the last decades, it has been recog-
nized that all systems of the Paleoproterozoic era are well 
represented in the continent (Brito Neves, 2011). Therefore, 
choosing a single unifying rack (the “Transamazonian”) to 
include all the different systems is both undesirable and 
inconsistent, although understandable in the past. Even 
for Amazonia, in northern South America, the accumu-
lated geological knowledge — according to Santos 2003; 
Tassinari and Macambira 2004; Rosa Costa et al. 2006; 
Cordani and Teixeira 2007, among many others — is suf-
ficient to place the initial concept of “Transamazonian” in a 
untenable position, since isotopic determinations originally 
labeled as “Transamazonian” (ca. 2,000 Ma) are restricted to 
a small area in the northeastern part of the Amazonian cra-
ton. Likewise, using the same designation in other basement 
blocks (e.g. São Francisco Craton, Rio de La Plata Craton, 
São Luis Craton, basement of Neoproterozoic provinces, 
etc.), is inadequate, given that these blocks, or plates, were 

— probably — distant from each other, and unlikely to 
have shared a single cycle of plate interaction.

The “Uruaçuano cycle” (ca. 1,300-1,100 Ma) proposal 
was consolidated in the same publication of Almeida et al. 
(1973), although it was present in several earlier studies, in 
other structural provinces of South America. This was an 
interpretive mistake of geological and isotopic data (mostly 
Rb-Sr and K-Ar), which gradually disappeared from the sci-
entific archive of the continent, due to the growth in the 
geological knowledge of the region.

At that time, it was a common practice to take a few 
groups of age and “validate” them as a tectonic “cycle”. 
This was done without the necessary commitment to paleo-
geographic and paleotectonic scenarios. Concepts such as 
“cycle”, “phase”, “orogeny”, and “tectonic event” were used 
loosely, without commiting to a ruling principle. Additionally, 
there was the widespread unduly idea of a continent (South 
America) always acting as a large monolithic continental 
mass, which is not adequate.

As far as the Brasiliano “cycle” and the Neoproterozoic 
structural provinces are concerned, new information is con-
tinuously being produced. A few subdivisions have been 
proposed (e.g. Campos Neto 2000; Schobbenhaus &amp;amp; Brito 
Neves 2003; Silva et al. 2005), with very good scientific 
support, providing valuable aid to the approach proposed 
in the present paper.

 Scientific progress is instrumental to challenge inad-
equate concepts and subdivisions. In addition to that, 
advances in geological knowledge have gradually demon-
strated the existence of other major tectonic events associ-
ated to the concept of interaction of several paleocontinents 
(e.g. those from the Siderian, Tonian, Cambrian, among 
others), barely hypothesized or imagined during the last 
quarter of the past century.

The interesting question posed by Collins et al. (2011), 
in the XIV Gondwana Symposium, about the final assem-
bly of Gondwana (“Where and when did Gondwana 
finally amalgamate?”) seems to have a good answer based 
on the most remarkable record in South America. A review 
of the different main phases (pulses) of convergent plate 
interactions during the Neoproterozoic and the final fusion 
of West Gondwana in late Cambrian times are the main 
objectives of this work.

PREVIOUS STUDIES

Since the late 1960s several authors (e.g. Cordani et al. 
1968) have attempted to summarize and organize the avail-
able geological and geochronological information, trying 
to subdivide the pre-Ordovician in the South American

platform. In the 1970s, several classic papers were pub-
lished (Almeida 1971, 1978; Almeida et al. 1973; Cordani 
1973), in which the Neoproterozoic orogenic activity was 
encompassed in the so-called “Brasiliano” (between 700 
and 450 Ma, Almeida et al. 1973). This is a sequence of 
relevant contributions, each successively taking advantage 
of the progress of the knowledge (Tab. 1).

Contributions by Schobbenhaus and Campos (1984) and 
Almeida and Hasui (1984), although sticking to the rules 
of international committees, and taking hold of the conti-
nent as a whole, brought about advances to the proposals 
of the previous decade. As mentioned above, Brito Neves 
et al. (1990) presented a synthesis of these classifications 
and systematizations (Tab. 1).

Subsequent works — by Pimentel et al. 1997; Campos 
Neto 2000, among others —, brought to light new data 
from mapping and geochronological data using new isoto-
pic methods, and made it clear that previous schemes could 
not prevail. From then on, the number of relevant contri-
butions grew and led to rapid progress.

The new data represented the starting point for new 
schemes of geological time subdivision in the continent 
(Schobbenhaus &amp;amp; Brito Neves 2003; Delgado et al. 2003). 
In both cases, Neoproterozoic tectonic events were consid-
ered with particular care, including the previous proposals 
to subdivide the “Brasiliano” sensu lato. Silva et al. (2005), 
considering the development of the Mantiqueira Province, 
attempted to improve and update the scheme proposed by 
Delgado et al. (2003). These contributions provide excel-
lent synthesis of geochronological data available for the 
Proterozoic of the continent. In addition, they provided the 
first attempts to organize the “Brasiliano” geological record 
in space and time.

Defining orogenic processes, taking into account geolog-
ical time subdivision and main stages supported by tectonic 
events, is a complex and demanding exercise, and it needs 
to be carried out permanently. Timely revisions are neces-
sary to keep track of knowledge advancement.

PLATE INTERACTIONS, OROGENY, 
OROGENIC COLLAGE, FUSION 

(ASSEMBLY)

There is no consensus in the international literature con-
cerning the definition of the concepts above. They are simply 
overlooked, or in some cases, treated frivolously. However, 
in our view and experience, attempts to understand the geo-
tectonic development of continents, following the initial 
assumptions of Mitchell and Reading (1969), Dewey and 
Bird (1970) and Dewey and Burke (1973), as suggested by 
Helwig (1974), and again by Sengör (1990), is very useful 
in the systematization of tectonic processes. According to 
Helwig (1974) and Sengör (1990), orogenesis is defined as a 
plate interaction (development of a Wilson cycle), orogenic 
collage is a concatenated sequence of orogenies, and fusion 
is the sum of these processes, leading to the formation of a 
large continental mass or a supercontinent.

As mentioned above, several geoscientists, including 
authors of textbooks, do not follow any robust systematics, 
and the consolidation of these concepts is usually missing — 
see Moores and Twiss 1995; der Pluijm and Marshak 2004; 
Kearey et al. 2009, among other more recent textbooks —, 
which leaves room for many inferences and counterintuitive

“concepts”. For instance, in the case of the several orogenies 
of the Appalachian Mountains involving distinct terranes, 
arcs and plates, no discrimination is proposed, and the term 
orogeny persists until the end of a long and complex evo-
lution. Orogenic collage should have been used, since the 
assembly of Pangaea was the final result of the processes. 
Indeed this oversimplification (“orogenesis”) has been com-
mon practice, especially when some linearity of orogenic 
processes persists.

In cases where co-linearity and/or contiguity of succes-
sive orogenic processes are absent, and where interacting 
participants (basement inliers, terranes, “structural highs”, 
shear belts, etc.) are abundant, the simplistic treatment 
has not been possible or is usually confusing. This is the 
case of the branching systems of orogens or “mosaic-like 
folded regions” present not only in Proterozoic terrains (e.g. 
Neoproterozoic structural provinces in Brazil, Baikalian 
provinces of Asia, etc.), but also in Phanerozoic terrains (e.g. 
European Hercynian, Ural-Mongolia, Alps). In every case 
there is then the necessity to investigate each of the belts, 
their paleogeographic framework, as well as their lithostruc-
tural and isotopic records, and perform comparison exercises 
in order to achieve meaningful syntheses.

Even recognizing the disregard of formal nomenclature 
and definitions in the Geotectonic literature, for which the 
necessity of formalization equals that of the stratigraphic 
nomenclature code, we decided to follow the “Helwig 
(1974)–Sengör (1990)” proposal, aiming to understand the 
problems presently posed for South America. We hope to 
establish a basis for the better appreciation of the problem 
and for its future solution.

PRE-TONIAN IN SOUTH AMERICA

Archean
Eoarchean rocks have not been found in South America 

up to now, although there are some indirect records from 
Sm-Nd model ages and from rare U-Pb ages of detrital 
zircon grains.

Exposures of Paleoarchean high- and low-grade rocks are 
recognized within the main cratonic nuclei (São Francisco, 
Amazonian), in basement inliers within and between mobile 
belts, and eventually in detrital zircon grains from Proterozoic 
metasedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks (&gt; 3.4 Ga) were 
identified in the central and northern domains of the São 
Francisco craton (Nutman &amp;amp; Cordani 1993), and in the 
São José do Campestre block (Dantas et al. 2004, 2010, 
2013), in the Borborema province. Up to this date, there is 
no sufficient data to try to establish workable tectonic sub-
divisions for this era in South America.

Mesoarchean records are far more abundant in cratons, 
basement of Proterozoic mobile belts, as well as in detrital 
material of Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks. However, 
in spite of the available data, it seems still early to suggest 
subdivisions. Occasionally, some denominations of orogenic 
nature are used — e.g. “Guriense cycle (Schobbenhaus &amp;amp; 
Campos, 1984) — to distinguish between different tectonic/
metamorphic peaks. Although the increasing volume of 
geological and geochronological data is recognized, formal 
classifications should wait until additional data are avail-
able. In addition to that, many Mesoarchean terranes were 
variably reworked during Proterozoic orogenies, requiring 
caution when making new propositions.

In general, among the Archean eras, Neoarchean records 
are the most frequent in the basement of the cratons and the 
Proterozoic mobile belts. The wealth of data has lead research-
ers to propose some local designations, such as the “Jequié 
cycle” (Cordani 1973), “Jequié-Aroense” (Schobbenhaus &amp;amp; 
Campos, 1984), and “Rio das Velhas” (Noce et al. 1998). 
Such designations express the necessity of knowledge sys-
tematization, and are understandable, acceptable, and should 
be stimulated. However, caution should be exercised when 
such designations are extended from a specific geological 
domain to the whole continent.

With the necessary caution, possible Neoarchean con-
tinental nuclei in Brazil should be confronted with what is 
known about Neoarchean rocks worldwide. Indeed, several 
neoarchean continental reconstruction scenarios have been 
suggested in the literature (e.g. Bleeker 2003): 

 ? a single continent (Kenoran); 
 ? two or three large continental masses (Sclavia, Superia, 

Vaalbara); or 
 ? many different masses, plates and nuclei, which appears to 

be the less probable solution, according to Bleeker (2003). 

In our point of view, this xcenario considered as the “less 
probable solution” (Bleeker, 2003), involving many different 
neoarchean masses, appears to be the most realistic model 
(taking into consideration the data of the South American 
Platform).   

PALEOPROTEROZOIC

There are good lithological and structural records of 
all Paleoproterozoic periods recognized in South America, 
both from orogenic and anorogenic processes, also includ-
ing basin-forming tectonics (Brito Neves 2011).

 Siderian rock units (2,500 – 2,300 Ma) were recently 
identified in the cratonic basement of the Amazonian and 
Luis Alves cratons, and in basement inliers of Proterozoic

belts, including volcano-sedimentary formations (Brito 
Neves 2011). 

The Rhyacian (2,300 – 2,050 Ma), mainly in its middle 
part (ca. 2,150 – 2,200 Ma), is the Paleoproterozoic time 
interval with the largest number of tectonic, magmatic and 
sedimentary events recorded in the diverse components of 
the basement in South America, particularly in its central 
and eastern sectors.

The Orosirian (2,050 – 1,800 Ma) runs second place 
in terms of record wealth, comprising independent orog-
enies, all well constrained in their time intervals, but also 
representing the final stages of orogenies that started in the 
Rhyacian. Aside from the orogenic processes, important 
granite plutonism and abundant volcanic and sedimentary 
sequences have been identified. In eastern Amazonia, these 
processes were extensive, representing a large igneous prov-
ince (LIP), covering an area that exceeds 1 million km2, in 
five different countries (Brito Neves 2011; Klein et al. 2013).

During the Statherian (1,800 – 1,600 Ma), there is a 
single orogen in the central sector of the Amazonian cra-
ton, known as the Rio Negro-Juruena belt, exposed to the 
west of an Orosirian belt. Nd-Sr isotopic evidence points 
to juvenile accretion processes in the origin of this orogen 
(Tassinari &amp;amp; Macambira 2004; Cordani &amp;amp; Teixeira 2007). 
This orogen is believed to continue into North America 
(Transcontinental-Labrador) and northern Europe (Gothian-
Kongsbergian), according to continental reconstructions put 
forward by several authors (Brito Neves 2005). However, the 
most outstanding feature of the Statherian in South America 
is taphrogenesis, with many examples in all sectors of the 
continent. This is represented by plutonism, volcanism, and 
sedimentation, including precursors of large intracratonic 
sedimentary basins (“steer’s head basins” or koilogens). In 
part, these extensive covers continued to form well into the 
Mesoproterozic, for example the Espinhaço Supergroup in 
the São Francisco craton. Some of the basins were formed 
in large rift zones, deformed later on during the Late 
Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic orogenic processes 
(e.g Espinhaço, Orós-Jaguaribe, Araí).

MESOPROTEROZOIC

There are two large geological domains in South America, 
the Amazonian (or pre-Brasiliano, or north-west domain) 
and the “Brasiliano” (or central-east domain) ones, accord-
ing to Brito Neves and Fuck (2013, 2014). Their distinc-
tion is easily recognized when analyzing Mesoproterozoic 
and younger rock assemblages (Table 2).

In the Amazonian domain, the Mesoproterozoic 
(1,600 – 1,000 Ma) is represented in several NNW-ESE 

mobile belts that developed between 1,590 and 1,000 Ma 
(Tab. 2), organized from northeast to southwest in a chelo-
genic pattern (Tassinari &amp;amp; Macambira 2004; Bettencourt 
et al. 2010, among others). The continuity of these belts into 
North America is a frequent matter of debate (Brito Neves 
2005; Bettencourt et al. 2010; Brito Neves &amp;amp; Fuck 2014, 
among others), especially among researchers investigating 
the history of supercontinents.

Mesoproterozoic magmatic and sedimentary processes 
have been recorded within the Brasiliano domain. However, 
so far, no true mobile belt has been recognized, except, per-
haps, for the Ceres-Rialma belt, exposed along the high course 
of the Tocantins River, in central Brazil (Moraes et al. 2004, 
2006). Most units generated during the Mesoproterozoic 
were strongly affected by Neoproterozoic orogenic events. 
Some restricted cratonic covers escaped this, for instance the 
central part of the Chapada Diamantina Group, in the São 
Francisco craton (Süssenberger et al. 2014). Several examples 
of Mesoproterozoic rift deposits were involved in younger 
Brasiliano mobile belts, many hundreds of million years 
later (e.g. part of Espinhaço, Orós-Jaguaribe, Araí, etc.).

Available geological and geochronological information 
indicate that the Mesoproterozoic time scale for the suc-
cessive orogenic events in Amazonia is distinct from that 
recorded in the extra-Amazonian portion of the continent 
(Tab. 2). It is not an overstatement to say that the end of the 
Mesoproterozoic marks the end of the history of Precambrian 
orogenies in Amazonia, since Neoproterozoic events are 
scarce (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Fuck 2013). On the other hand, 
Neoproterozoic systems are of utmost importance outside 
Amazonia, in the so-called Brasiliano domain.

NEOPROTEROZOIC

Tonian Terranes/Orogenies
The progress of the geological knowledge arising from 

1:100.000 and larger scale mapping of almost the whole area 
of the Brasiliano domain and also from abundant isotopic 
studies, led to the establishment of a much more complete 
scenario of crustal evolution than that described by the pio-
neering authors mentioned above.

Tonian terranes, in the sense of Howell (1995), have been 
identified in all Neoproterozoic structural provinces of South 
America. They usually represent fractions of Early-Middle 
Tonian accretionary — some juvenile in nature — and col-
lisional orogens, including volcanic-sedimentary associations 
metamorphosed under low- to high-grade conditions. Rock 
assemblages, typical of active continental margins, magmatic 
island arcs and remnants of ocean floor have been recog-
nized in these units (e.g. Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992; Pimentel

2010; Siga Jr. et al. 2009, 2011; Van Schmus et al. 2011). 
It is not always possible to reconstruct the paleogeogra-
phy of these terranes, as they were disrupted during sub-
sequent Neoproterozoic orogenies. In all cases, it has been 
hard to discriminate them from younger Neoproterozoic 

lithostructural and tectonic units, and they have frequently 
been interpreted as basement inliers. In general, time lapses 
of hundreds of million years have been recognized between 
these Tonian terrains and the younger Neoproterozoic pro-
cesses. The plate configurations and duration of these peri-
ods still need to be accurately established.

Borborema province (NE South America)
Tonian terranes, apparently the largest in the conti-

nent, occupy wide areas within the Borborema Province 
(Fig. 1). They extend along ca. 1,000 km from the north of 
João Pessoa to SW Piauí, forming a belt up to ca. 100 km 
wide (the so-called Alto Pajeú terrane + Riacho Gravatá 
“subterrane”) and in some other minor occurrences in the 
Transversal (central) and southern domains of the prov-
ince. Volcanic-sedimentary associations, including fel-
sic, mafic and restricted ultramafic rock associations, as 
well as orogenic and collisional granites, are dominant. 
In some cases, arc magmatism displays juvenile geochem-
ical and isotopic signatures (Accioly et al. 2010; Santos 
et al. 2010; Van Schmus et al. 2011). These rocks formed 
largely between 1,050 and 930 Ma. Tonian rocks are also 
exposed in the north (Belém do São Francisco, Cabrobó) 
and south (Marrancó, Poço Redondo) of the Pernambuco-
Alagoas massif, in the northern portion of the Sergipano 
belt, between the  post-Cryogenian supracrustals and the 
Paleoproterozoic basement of the massif (Oliveira et al. 
2010). A wealth of data is available for the Borborema 
Tonian rock assemblages (Santos 2010; Van Schmus et al. 

2011; Caxito et al. 2014a, 2014b). According to De Wit 
et al. (2005, 2008), it is likely that these Tonian units of the 
Borborema Province have also been recognized in the Pan 
African domains, from Cameroon to the south of Sudan.

Tocantins province
The Goiás Magmatic arc is one of the most important 

tectonic features of the Brasília Belt, in central Brazil. It is 
exposed for approximately 1,000 km in the NNE-SSW 
direction along the western part of the belt. It comprises 
two sectors, separated by the Archean terranes of the Goiás 
massif (see Pimentel et al. 2004 and Figs. 2 and 3).

The southern sector is known as the Arenópolis arc, and 
the northern sector, as the Mara Rosa arc (Pimentel et al. 
2000; Laux et al. 2004, 2005). In both sectors, early evolu-
tion of the arc took place in Tonian intra-oceanic island arcs, 
between ca. 930 and 810 Ma, with the crystallization of very 
primitive tholeiitic to calc-alkaline volcanics and associated 
tonalites/granodiorites (Fig. 3). The rocks display positive 
?Nd(T) values and Nd TDM model ages mostly between 0.8 
and 1.1 Ga (Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992; Pimentel et al. 1997, 
2000). Geochemical and isotopic data suggest that some of

the original tonalite/andesite magmas were similar to mod-
ern adakites (Pimentel et al., 1997). 

A younger cycle of magmatic activity took place between 
ca. 670 and 600 Ma (Laux et al. 2005; Fuck et al. 2006; 
Oliveira et al. 2006). This second cycle also comprises vol-
canic-sedimentary sequences, calc-alkaline tonalite-granodi-
orite intrusions, as well as bi-modal intrusions comprised 
of gabbro/diorite/granite. Sm-Nd data produced TDM val-
ues varying in a much wider range, from ca. 0.9 to 2.2 Ga, 
suggesting a higher contribution/contamination with older 
continental crust and indicating that this second event took 
place in a continental arc. Metamorphism under greenschist 
to amphibolite facies took place at ca. 630-620 Ma. This was 
followed by the emplacement of a large volume of post-tec-
tonic bimodal intrusions formed by gabbros and granites 
dated between ca. 600 and 540 Ma.

Although these two main phases of arc magmatism are 
recognized on the basis of geochronological and, locally, geo-
physical data, their spatial distribution is still not clear for 
most of this geotectonic unit. In a large part, both sectors 

of the Goiás Magmatic Arc have been strongly affected by 
dextral strike-slip shear zones of the Transbrasiliano-Kandi 
lineament (Schobbenhaus et al. 1975; Cordani et al. 2013b). 
This is a striking geologic feature that corresponds to a wide 
(approximately 200-100 km wide) tectonic corridor of con-
tinental dimensions, cutting through most of South America 
and extending into Africa. The strike-slip faults have dis-
rupted the arc rock units, causing important displacements 
in the NNE-SSW direction, obliterating the original spatial, 
structural, and stratigraphic relationships between the two 
different phases of arc magmatism. In addition, younger and 
older tonalite and granodiorite intrusions, preserved or not 
from strong deformation, are virtually identical petrograph-
ically, hampering their distinction in the field. Therefore, 
one has to rely on tools such as geochronology and airborne 
geophysics to distinguish between them. This was partially 
achieved in the Mara Rosa arc, where an appropriate amount 
of Sm-Nd isotopic data allied with U-Pb zircon ages seem to 
indicate that the Tonian rocks (930-800 Ma) dominate the 
eastern part of the arc (here informally called the Amaralina

domain), whereas the western and southern parts of it (the 
Santa Terezinha de Goiás domain, see Figure 3) comprises 
mainly 670-600 Ma old rocks. One metavolcanic rock inter-
layered in fine-grained metasedimentary rocks of the Santa 
Terezinha de Goiás Sequence yielded the U-Pb zircon age 
of ca. 670 Ma, whereas associated metatonalites have intru-
sion ages of ca. 630 – 600 Ma. 

In the Arenópolis arc (the southern part of the Goiás 
magmatic arc, Figs. 2 and 3) strike slip faults separate regions 
where the Tonian juvenile rocks dominate from regions 
dominated by the Ediacaran phase. However, the available 
geological and geochronological data do not allow their rep-
resentation in geological maps at an appropriate scale. Small 
ultramafic bodies consisting of serpentinite, metaperidotite, 
and amphibolite are not rare and have been interpreted as 

remnants of oceanic basins, separating different island arc 
terranes. Similar rocks have also been recognized in the Mara 
Rosa arc. They may represent former suture zones between 
colliding magmatic arc systems, which have been obliter-
ated by later deformational events (Pimentel et al. 2000).

superposed trends of the Neoproterozoic orogenic associa-
tion (Rio Negro arc and surroundings).

Geochemical data of the Italva rocks indicate extensional 
magmatism in a back arc-type environment, filled up with 
detritus derived from a neighboring basement (Peixoto and 
Heilbron 2010). Geochronological data of amphibolites, 
intercalated with marbles, indicate the crystallization age of 
848 ± 11 Ma for the original mafic magmatism (Heilbron 
and Machado 2003). This is ca. 50 Ma older than the old-
est age recorded so far in the Rio Negro arc, and more than 
200 Ma older than the main magmatic activity within the 
magmatic arc. Metamorphism of the Italva rocks took place 
at higher P-T conditions than that seen in the younger rocks, 
and their contacts are tectonic in nature.

b) Itaiacoca Group
The Itaiacoca Group occurs in the westernmost area of 

the Mantiqueira Province, in Paraná and São Paulo. It is 
a ca. 180 km long and &gt; 15 km wide metavolcanic-sedi-
mentary sequence, exposed between the ca. 620 Ma old 
Cunhaporanga and Três Córregos magmatic arcs (Fig. 5). 
The metamorphic belt is covered in the north and south 
by Phanerozoic deposits of the Paraná Basin. It is com-
posed of a QPC-type (quartzite-pelite-carbonate) metased-
imentary association. Stromatolitic dolomite marble, 
frequently rich in talc, and phyllite make up the lower 
part of the sequence, followed by quartzite and metavol-
canic rocks, with phyllite at the top (Siga Jr. et al. 2009, 
2011). The U-Pb zircon age of the Itaiacoca metavolca-
nics is set at 934 ± 36 Ma, and detrital zircon ages vary 
from late Stenian to Early Tonian (Siga Jr. et al. 2009, 
2011). The sequence is thought to represent continen-
tal passive margin deposits related to the Paranapanema 
microplate (Mantovani &amp;amp; Brito Neves 2009). Cryogenian 
orogenic processes later truncated it, and it is covered 
locally by metaconglomerate, metarkose, metagraywake 
and metavolcanics of the Cryogenian Abapã Formation, 
dated at 628±18 Ma. 

INTERCONTINENTAL INTEGRATION

As previously mentioned, a recent contribution, by 
Brito Neves and Fuck (2014) showed that the basement of 
the South American Platform is divided into two distinct 
major geological and geotectonic domains, the Amazonian 
or pre-Brasiliano domain and the Brasiliano domain, which 
are separated by the transcontinental Transbrasiliano linea-
ment (Tab. 2). These domains are separated from each other 
by the Transcontinental Kandi-Transbrasiliano lineament. 
The distinction between the two domains is underlined 

by the striking differences in stratigraphic organization in 
both domains, especially when the tectonic events in the 
Brasiliano domain are considered. From the Mesoproterozoic 
onwards the two domains display very distinct geological 
features and tectonic evolution. In Table 3, the different 
tectonic events comprising the Brasiliano collage are listed 
and detailed.

Tonian Terranes
The presence of Tonian terranes within the Brasiliano 

collage is well documented. However, based on the available 
data, it has been difficult to recognize them as representa-
tive of an independent (post-Stenian, pre-Brasiliano) phase 
of crustal evolution. Although there is evidence of struc-
tural discontinuity between the Tonian and the Brasiliano 
rock assemblages in some areas, the precise meaning of this 
break is hard to understand due to the strong overprint of 
Brasiliano orogenic events. 

As far as geological knowledge and lithostructural con-
text of each province go, there is no evidence to link the 
Tonian occurrences in Brazil to those of the classic Meso-
Neoproterozoic Grenvillian orogenies of the northern and 
southern hemispheres. Also, there are fundamental differ-
ences in age and composition, and it has been truly diffi-
cult to provide paleographic reconstruction, even following 
several different models.

In relation to Africa, based on previous reconstitutions 
and age data, the Meso-Neoproterozoic Namaqua–Natal 
belt is possibly the most interesting orogen (candidate) to 
be correlated to South American Tonian terrains. Some 
similarities have been pointed out during the analysis 
of the literature. However, many difficulties are also evi-
dent as, for instance, the lack of paleomagnetic support. 
Meso-Neoproterozoic geological units in Nigeria, Chad 
and southern Sudan, comparable with those in Brazil, 
have been reported (de Wit et al. 2005, 2008), but they 
have been strongly reworked by the Pan-African orogeny. 
If this supposed correlation will be confirmed, the Tonian 
terranes in West Gondwana may extend along strike for 
several thousands of kilometers. Actually, the presence 
of Tonian terranes in Rodinia, Western (and Eastern) 
Gondwana has been neglected, and this is persisting as a 
challenging open question.

Tonian processes and orogenies were absent and have 
not been considered in the Rodinia concept; this supercon-
tinent was formed at ca. 900 Ma ago (Li et al. 2008). It is 
still an open question whether the Tonian processes precede 
(or follow) Rodinia amalgamation, and this has important 
implications for the configuration of this supercontinent. 
It appears that, in general, awareness of this problem is absent 
in the international scientific community.

The Brasiliano collage in South America: a review 



Post-Tonian: The Brasiliano Orogenies

Early Criogenyan, ca. 840 – 750 Ma. (“Pulse” 1 
of the Brasiliano collage)

The first events of convergent plate interaction of the 
Brasiliano collage are believed to have taken place in the Early 
Cryogenian (?750 Ma), as recorded in most of the structural 
provinces, except for the Pampean Orogen. Investigation of 

the initial events may be hampered by the superposition 
of younger magmatic or tectonic events, or by the lack of 
outcrops, access problems or even by the lack of geochro-
nological data.

Furthermore, the initial convergent processes are coeval 
with taphrogenic events (elsewhere) linked to the breakup 
of Rodinia, which appear to have more evidence due to a 
wealth of geological and isotopic data (850 – 740 Ma, Silva

et al. 2005; Brito Neves and Fuck 2013). In other words, 
these extensional processes are dominant and more easily 
observed. In consequence, there are some obvious problems 
in recognizing the earliest orogenic events of the Brasiliano 
collage, which will be here discussed.

São Gabriel Arc
The best-documented examples of Early Cryogenian 

accretionary processes are from the São Gabriel arc, in west-
ern Rio Grande do Sul. The arc is partially hidden below 
Eopaleozoic deposits (Maricá Group, Camaquã basin) and 
by the Paraná cratonic basin, underlying an area of ca. 
5,000 km2, limited by the NW-SE Ibaré and NNE-SSW 
Irapuá faults.

The São Gabriel arc comprises calc-alkaline granite-gneiss 
(Cambaí Group, 890 – 730 Ma), metavolcanic-sedimentary 
sequence (Vacacaí Group, 760 – 730 Ma), ophiolite rem-
nants (Cerro Mantiqueira, 740 Ma), and late 720 – 685 Ma 
old intrusions (Laux et al. 2010; Lena et al. 2014).

Recently, Philipp et al. (2014) reported some older 
ages in the southern part of the São Gabriel terrane. 
Tonalite orthogneis from the Imbicuí rock unit was dated 
at 875 ± 5 Ma. Intrusive diorite was dated at 745 ± 1.2 Ga. 
According to the authors, this may represent an older arc, 
possibly related with the Tonian terrains discussed above.

Cerro Bori orthogneisses
Early Cryogenian rocks are exposed in Cerro Bori, 

Uruguay, east of the southernmost tip of the Pelotas-Aiguá 
batholith. Tonalite and granodiorite gneisses, mafic and fel-
sic granulites and amphibolite are the dominant rock types 
(Lenz et al. 2011). Petrological, geochemical and isotopic 
data confirm magmatic arc affiliation. 

U-Pb SHRIMP data of mafic granulites indicate 
ages between 770 and 796 Ma. Gneisses samples were 
dated between 770 and 802 Ma. Regional metamorphism 
was dated at ca. 676 Ma, implying in a complete accretion-
ary and collisional history before the emplacement of the 
Pelotas–Aiguá batholith, preceding, therefore, all other accre-
tionary processes related with the climax of the Brasiliano 
orogeny. Lenz et al. (2011) suggested an early Brasiliano 
event (or Brasiliano I), following the earlier proposal by 
Silva et al. (2005). Despite the small size of this area (ca. 
300 km2), this is an important occurrence that should be 
remarked. Relations with the almost coeval São Gabriel arc 
exposed to the west side of the Pelotas-Aiguá batholith still 
have to be investigated.

The “Embu terrane”
The “Embu terrane” is exposed in the central Mantiqueira 

Province, to the northwest and north of the Curitiba terrane 

up to the northern part of the province (Figs. 4 and 5), strik-
ing NE-SW for more than 250 km and up to 40 km wide 
(Heilbron et al. 2004; Campos Neto et al. 2007; Alves et al. 
2013; Trouw et al. 2013). The Embu terrane is recognized 
as a continental fragment docked at the Ribeira belt during 
the Ediacaran, when the Paranapanema and São Francisco 
plates collided. It comprises Paleoproterozoic gneiss (shown 
as a basement inlier in Figs. 4 and 5), medium- to high-
grade supracrustal rocks, as well as Cryogenian gneiss, and 
granite intrusions dated at 600-590 Ma.

Early Cryogenian tonalite and granodiorite gneisses 
with magmatic arc affinities exposed to the south of São 
Paulo were dated at 811 ± 13 Ma (Cordani et al. 2002) 
while muscovite leucogranites from the western “Embu ter-
rane” were dated at 760 – 740 Ma (Passarelli et al. 2004). 
Xenotime and monazite from the Mogi das Cruzes granite 
yielded ages of ca. 790 Ma (Vlach 2001), similar to the age 
of regional metamorphism. 

Orogenic and anorogenic granite magmatism took place 
between 650 and 500 Ma, with the main peak between 590 
and 540 Ma (Alves et al. 2013). The available data suggest 
that the “Embu” is a Brasiliano terrane, although early 
Cryogenian, as well as Meso- and Paleoproterozoic events 
have also been identified (Alves et al. 2013). However, con-
nections with coeval events in neighboring terranes and belts 
have yet to be investigated. There are some unpublished data 
pointing out the occurrence of some pre-Proterozoic rock 
units (at its northernmost part).

The Ceres-Rialma Metamorphic Belt
A high-grade metamorphic belt is exposed along the 

headwaters of the Tocantins River in central Brazil, east of 
the Mara Rosa arc and Goiás massif. It extends for more 
than 350 km, striking NNE-SSW, and was formed in the 
Early Cryogenian (Moraes &amp;amp; Fuck 1994; Moraes et al. 2004, 
2006, among others). 

The western part of the belt comprises sedimentary and vol-
canic rocks of the Juscelândia, Indaianópolis and Palmeirópolis 
sequences and the Serra da Malacacheta and Serra dos Borges 
gabbro-anorthosite complexes, formed in a rift environment 
that evolved to ocean floor at ca. 1,270 Ma. These rocks 
overlie tectonically the eastern part of the belt that is made 
of the Barro Alto, Niquelândia and Cana Brava mafic-ultra-
mafic layered complexes (Moraes et al. 2004; Ferreira Filho 
et al. 2010, among others). It has been suggested that the 
layered complexes are originally related to the taphrogenesis 
processes that led to the Rodinia breakup (Brito Neves &amp;amp; 
Fuck 2013), at about 800 Ma (Pimentel et al. 2004; Della 
Giustina et al. 2011).

Although the original igneous stratigraphy and miner-
alogy of the complexes were disturbed by late Eocryogenian

The Brasiliano collage in South America: a review 



tectonic-metamorphic processes (750 – 770 Ma, Ferreira 
Filho 1994; Moraes et al. 2006), it has been possible to 
retrieve petrological and geochemical data. These suggest 
that they may have been a single large body, representing an 
Eocryogenian LIP (Moraes et al. 2004), an inference which 
appears to be supported by geophysical data (Soares 2005; 
Soares et al. 2010). The two parts of the belts are singularly 
different in origin and age, but were juxtaposed tectonically, 
deformed and metamorphosed together under high-grade 
conditions of high-T amphibolite and granulite facies. They 
form an unusual high-grade belt between the Goiás mas-
sif and the Paleoproterozoic Natividade-Cavalcante block, 
basement to the external zone of the Brasília belt. Another 
notable feature of the high-grade belt is that its metamorphic 
gradient is opposite to that of the Brasília belt: it increases 
from west to east.

Despite the numerous investigations carried out on 
the belt, several questions are still pending. The age of 
closure and inversion of the western Ectasian rift is still 
debatable, although Moraes et al. (2006) present prelim-
inary data suggesting metamorphism between ca. 0.75 – 
0.76 Ga, as indicated by U-Pb analysis of metamorphic 
zircon and Sm-Nd garnet-whole rock isochrons on rocks 
of the Juscelândia sequence. The causes of orogeny and 
high-grade metamorphism are still poorly understood. 
Subsequent Neocryogenian tectonics and magmatism are 
rather complex, and hamper the understanding of previ-
ous events. It seems likely that the orogenic process may 
have been caused by compressive far-field stresses resulting 
from the inversion of the large rift that led to the intru-
sion of the layered mafic-ultramafic complexes. So far, no 
obvious connection could be established with the other 
Cryogenian terrains discussed above.

Neocryogenian-Early Ediacaran (650/600 – 
600/590 Ma)— “Pulse” 2 of the Brasiliano collage

The Neocryogenian-Early Ediacaran time interval is 
marked globally by post-Rodinia and pre-Gondwana events, 
and by diachronic accretionary and collisional processes 
in all of the Neoproterozoic structural provinces in South 
America. Large orogenic chains with important crustal 
accretion events were then developed. They also include 
important recycling of Mesoproterozoic to Paleoarchean 
crustal material. Narrow and wide oceans (Campos Neto 
2000; Schobbenhaus &amp;amp; Brito Neves 2003; Basei et al. 2008) 
were consumed in a varied and complex scenario of plate 
interaction and continent formation. Collisional processes 
were followed soon after (late Cryogenian-early Ediacaran)
by the intrusion of typically collisional syenite and granite 
bodies emplaced in thickened crust. In other cases — e.g., 

SE of Brasilia belt, north of Mantiqueira province —, the 
collision was entirely confined within the early Ediacaran.

Tocantins Province
In the Tocantins Province (Figs. 2 and 3), the Brasiliano 

part of the Goiás magmatic arc (Pimentel et al. 2000, 2004; 
Fuck et al. 2006; Oliveira et al. 2006; Dantas et al. 2006) 
and of the Socorro-Guaxupé nappe, further south (Campos 
Neto &amp;amp; Caby 2000), are relatively well studied, with refer-
ence to interacting plates, closed ocean realms, as well as to 
their accretion history (650 – 630 Ma) and subsequent col-
lision (ca. 625 Ma). Metamorphic processes and post-colli-
sional events are relatively well constrained.

The Araguaia (Rokelide) orogenic system further north 
within the Tocantins Province displays good geological and 
geochronological records of ocean closure (770 – 550 Ma), as 
attested by the Quatipuru, Serra do Tapa and Tucuruí ophio-
lites (Paixão et al. 2008). So far, there is no clear evidence of 
related arc magmatism. However, based on positive gravity 
Bouguer anomalies observed in the basement, it has been 
suggested that the Goiás magmatic arc might branch out 
northwards below the Parnaíba basin (Castro et al. 2014).

Borborema Province
An important accretionary event has been recorded in the 

western Borborema Province (Fig. 1). The Santa Quitéria-
Tamboril system is ca. 380-km-long, striking north-south, 
and up to 110-km-wide (Fetter et al. 2003; Santos et al. 2008, 
2009; Araújo et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2013; Vasconcellos 
et al. 2013). Several aspects of arc formation and evolution 
are still unknown, due to the lack of data and to the super-
imposed extrusion tectonics. Recent magnetotelluric data 
display evidence of double convergent subduction below 
the Santa Quitéria arc (Padilha et al. 2014), corroborated by 
remnants of eclogite/retroeclogite and high-pressure gran-
ulite on both sides of the arc (Santos et al. 2009; Amaral 
et al. 2011, 2012).

In the “Zona Transversal” of the Borborema Province, 
and in several other areas, there are references of granites 
formed in magmatic arcs (e.g. “Conceição”, “Brejinho”, 
“Riacho do Icó”, “Timbaúba”, “Caboclo-Nova Olinda”, 
“Curral de Cima”, etc. (Brito Neves et al. 2003; Ferreira 
et al. 2004; Sial et al. 2008), the majority of which were 
dated between 650 and 620 Ma.

 These granites of the “Zona Transversal” domain (cen-
tral-western part) are mostly piercing rock assemblages of 
the Piancó-Alto Brígida (SPAB), Riacho Gravatá (RG) and 
Alto Pajeú terranes (AP) (See Fig. 1). This group of granites 
deserves further investigation, and, informally, they have 
been grouped as part of the “Alto Sertão Magmatic Arc”.

Benjamim Bley de Brito Neves et al.



 Accretionary orogenic evolution has also been proposed 
for the northern part of the Sergipano belt, on the south-
ern border of the Pernambuco-Alagoas massif (Oliveira 
et al. 2010), where ages are well constrained between 630 
and 617 Ma.

In the African Dahomeyan-Trans-Saharan counterpart 
of the Borborema Province, Caby (2011) reports that the 
main calk-alkaline plutonic phase of active continental mar-
gin took place at 640 – 630 Ma, followed by regional meta-
morphism at 620 – 600 Ma.

Mantiqueira Province
Accretionary processes have also been recognized in the 

Mantiqueira Province, from eastern Minas Gerais to east-
ern Uruguay (Figs. 4 and 5), forming different branches for 
more than 1,500 km along the eastern margin of the con-
tinent, between 18ºS and 34ºS (Cordani et al. 2000; Bizzi 
et al. 2003; Mantesso Neto et al. 2004; Silva et al. 2005, 
among others). The accretionary systems are not continu-
ous along the strike of the province, but are supported by 
a wealth of geological, geochemical and geochronological 
data. These include:

 ? Rio Doce, in Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Rio 
de Janeiro (Heilbron et al. 2004; Pedrosa Soares et al. 
2006, 2014), possibly extending to the coastal Serra 
Mar in São Paulo (Campos Neto 2000): 630 – 590 Ma 
&amp;lt;580 – 570 Ma (main accretionary phases). 

 ? Serra da Bolívia, from southern Espírito Santo to the south 
of Rio de Janeiro (Heilbron et al. 2013): 620 – 595 Ma.

 ? Rio Negro, in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (Tupinambá 
et  al. 2007, 2010; Heilbron et  al. 2004): 792 Ma, 
650 – 630 Ma.

 ? Cunhaporanga, Três Córregos and Agudos Grandes, in 
São Paulo and Paraná (Prazeres Filho et al. 2003; Siga 
Jr. et al. 2011): 630 – 610 Ma.

 ? Pien, in Paraná (Basei et al. 2008): 615 Ma.
 ? Florianópolis, Pelotas-Aiguá, in Santa Catarina, Rio 

Grande do Sul and Uruguay, respectively (Silva et al. 
2005; Basei et al. 2008): 635 – 590 Ma.

The scheme of plate interactions is not fully understood. 
In the northern part of the Mantiqueira Province, the western 
“São Francisco plate” represents the lower plate. The upper 
plate to the east was possibly the “Congo plate”, but this 
is still an open question (also, there are some objections). 
Other authors envisage collision in a broader scenario, such 
as the “nutcracker model” proposed by Alkmim et al. (2006).

In the central part of the province, several lithospheric 
fragments have been mentioned as interacting plates/micro-
plates/microcontinents; these include the Paranapanema, 
Curitiba, and Luis Alves blocks (Figs. 4 and 5). However, 

the proposed models need additional tectonic and geophys-
ical support in order to be validated (Basei et al. 2008). 
The model developed for the southern part of the province 
suggests that the “Rio de La Plata” represents the lower plate 
(to the west) and the Kalahari (to the east), would be the 
upper plate (Basei et al. 2008). Many of the difficulties in 
identifying the plates involved are related to the post-col-
lisional shear systems resulting from Neoediacaran-early 
Ordovician escape tectonic processes, which hamper paleo-
geographic reconstructions. Additionally, evolution of the 
South Atlantic continental margin and the Cenozoic uplift 
and other brittle tectonic events also mask some of the (for-
mer) Brasiliano features.

Some local and precursor events of the 
Neocryogenian-early Ediacaran processes and/or 
inheritance — Preceding “pulse” 2

In some cases, initial accretionary events have been dis-
criminated from the dominant Neocryogenian ones, due to 
reliable isotopic data, although the lack of appropriate field 
data may hamper their interpretation.

In the Santa Quitéria magmatic arc, W Ceará (Borborema 
Province), the large majority of age determinations are in the 
640-610 Ma interval. However, in the eastern part of the 
arc, granodiorite, metatexite and diatexite have crystalliza-
tion ages between 876 and 831 Ma (Araujo et al. 2012), this 
means ca. 200 Ma older than the main phase of arc building.

In the Rio Negro arc, Rio de Janeiro (Mantiqueira 
Province), the main rock assemblages were formed mainly 
between 630 and 590 Ma. A granodiorite gneiss sample was 
recently dated at 792 ± 12 Ma and a granite sample at ca. 
845 Ma, interpreted as the product of initial arc magma-
tism (Heilbron et al. 2004). Although additional isotopic 
data are needed, the new ages are duly noted.

Early – Middle Ediacaran (590 – 560 Ma) — 
“Pulse” 3 of the Brasiliano collage

Several tectonic events took place during the 590 – 560 Ma 
time interval, including accretionary orogenic processes.

As mentioned previously, rocks representing “pulse” 3, 
aside from those of the so-called “Rio Doce arc” in Minas 
Gerais and Espírito Santo, according to Campos Neto and 
Figueiredo (1995) and Campos Neto (2000), are exposed 
in the coastal zone of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, along 
the Serra do Mar (“Serra do Mar terrane”, Campos Neto 
2000). According to this peculiar concept of the “Rio 
Doce arc” (590 – 570 Ma), its rock forming events overlap 
those of the preceding orogenic pulse represented by the 
Rio Negro arc, exposed eastwards. According to Campos 
Neto and Figueiredo (1995) and Campos Neto (2000), 
these events have (some type of ) connection with those of

the Rio Doce orogeny in the Araçuaí belt, further north 
in the Mantiqueira Province. So, a precise separation of 
the orogenic “pulses” (arc magmatism) 2 and 3 along the 
coastal zone of the Mantiqueira Province is still uncertain 
(Heilbron et al. 2013).

In the Borborema Province, granite magmatism, includ-
ing high-K, peralkaline, ultrapotassic, and rarely shoshonitic 
magmatism, took place mainly in the time interval between 
590 and 570 Ma (Ferreira et al. 2004; Sial et al. 2008). These 
magmatic events followed the emplacement of epidote-bear-
ing tonalite and granodiorite (of the “pulse 2”), these prob-
ably related with arc magmatism (“Alto Sertão Magmatic 
Arc”), between ca. 650 and 620 Ma.

In addition to the successive accretionary events, there 
are several indications of intraplate orogenic processes with-
out any evidence of previous subduction. Collisional/met-
amorphic events (ca. 590 – 560 Ma) have been recorded in 
some particular cases of the Brasiliano structural provinces 
(e.g. part of the northern Mantiqueira Province, to the north 
of the Patos lineament in the Borborema province, etc.). 

The identification of truly orogenic events occurring 
during the Early-Middle Ediacaran has been difficult, due 
to concurrent post-orogenic tectonic and magmatic events, 
as well as anorogenic magmatism, which overlap in time and 
space with the orogenic rocks.

According to Tupinambá et  al. (2007, 2010), the 
accretionary phase of the Rio Negro arc ended around 
600 Ma ago, and the collisional phase started soon after, 
including several syn-collisional magmatic events until 
560 Ma. These authors admitted also that another mag-
matic arc may have been accreted at the beginning of the 
collisional phase, reiterating previous observations by 
Campos Neto (2000).

 Post-collision processes have been recorded in many 
places, such as granite and syenite magmatism (e.g. Itu and 
Graciosa suites, Teixeira-Terra Nova tectonic zone, late 
granites of the Rio Doce and Rio Negro arcs, Araguaia and 
Brasilia belts granites, granite magmatism piercing through 
basement inliers in the Borborema Province, etc.). Given the 
widespread occurrence of processes and their record, this is 
clearly a time interval composed of a diversified plethora of 
tectonic and magmatic activities. The distinction between 
the events of this time interval, late and post-collisional pro-
cesses, from the previous ones, arc magmatism and meta-
morphism, still needs to be completed with new and better 
geological field data and isotopic information. It is also use-
ful to bear in mind that escape- (extrusional) tectonic pro-
cesses and foreland tectonics affecting the South American 
Platform as a whole (in fact a large part of West Gondwana) 
started soon after 580 Ma. These processes obliterated some 
of the original geological relationships.

Cambrian Orogenies (530 – 490 Ma) — “Pulse” 
4 of the Brasiliano collage 

From the late Ediacaran to the early Ordovician, the 
most remarkable tectonic events in South America are 
related to post-collisional processes, marking the transition 
from unstable to stable tectonic conditions. They mainly 
include escape tectonics and associated sedimentary pro-
cesses, foreland tectonics, extension-related intrusions and 
isostatic adjustments.

While such processes were underway, two local minor 
orogenic developments were in process in the eastern and 
southwestern parts (Búzios and Pampean orogenies, respec-
tively) of the continental area that soon after became Western 
Gondwana.

Búzios orogeny
The Cambrian Búzios orogeny, the youngest event of 

the Ribeira belt in the Mantiqueira Province, is recognized 
in the coastal zone of Rio de Janeiro (Região dos Lagos, 
Schmitt et al. 2008; Schmitt &amp;amp; Armstrong 2014).

The tectonic evolution started with the history of a small 
(residual?) ocean basin from 610 Ma onwards, where volca-
nic-sedimentary sequences accumulated. These rocks were 
deformed and metamorphosed under high-grade conditions, 
and transported to the northwest at ca. 520 Ma. The hypoth-
esis is a process of subduction of the “Angola plate” (to the 
east) under the “Terreno Oriental” (to the west). This is esti-
mated to have taken place between 590 and 530 Ma, which 
was followed by collision at ca. 530 – 520 Ma. Late igneous 
and tectonic activity took place between 520 and 490 Ma 
(Schmitt et al. 2008). The authors compare this complete 
Wilson cycle with the products of Pan-African orogeny in the 
Kaoko belt in Angola and Namibia. Schmitt and Armstrong 
(2014) admit that the orogeny extended until ca. 490 Ma 
in a stepwise process that progressed to a poorly understood 
Ordovician orogenic collapse, until middle Ordovician times.

Pampean orogeny
The Pampean orogenic belt, east of Cordoba, Argentina 

(Fig. 6), developed in response to the subduction of the 
lower “Pampia microplate” to the west, made of high-grade 
“Grenvillian” rocks, under the Rio de La Plata upper plate in 
the east (Rapela et al. 1998; Escayola et al. 2007; Schwartz 
et al. 2008). The orogen comprises two parallel belts, the east-
ern one comprising mostly calc-alkaline magmatic rocks, and 
the western made of metasedimentary rocks and peralumi-
nous granites. Calc-alkaline magmatism was active between 
555 and 525 Ma, whereas peraluminous intrusions associ-
ated with regional metamorphism took place in the Early 
Cambrian (525 – 515Ma). Ophiolite remnants were dated 
by the Sm-Nd method at 647 ± 70 Ma (Escayola et al. 2007).

Schwartz et al. (2008) proposed a possible connection with 
the “Terra Australis orogen”, along the closing paleo-Pacific 
Ocean. In a regional perspective, there is the possibility of a 
northward connection with the Paraguay belt (south-western 
border of the Amazonian plate), although there is no evidence 
for subduction of ocean lithosphere in the latter. Additional 
geological and geophysical data are necessary to test this model.

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 
ABOUT GONDWANA AMALGAMATION

Processes leading to amalgamation of supercontinental 
masses are complex, long lasting, and accomplished according 

to amalgamation fronts of distinct paleogeography. Eventually, 
amalgamation processes in one province or front concur in 
time with taphrogenesis or breakup processes taking place 
in other areas. These are fundamentally diachronic processes 
from one amalgamation front to another and from one prov-
ince to another. Therefore, understanding supercontinent 
formation requires a large amount of geological, tectonic, 
paleomagnetic and isotopic data. Additionally, it should be 
remembered that supercontinents are not the final product 
of configuration, therefore improvement of tectonic mod-
els are necessary.

Several distinct models for the assembly and evolution 
of Gondwana have been proposed, but the problem is far 
from resolved. Many questions still remain, demanding

The Brasiliano collage in South America: a review 



different levels of geological and geophysical investigations 
in different continents.

 According to the recent proposal by Collins et  al. 
(2011), processes took place along three different fronts 
of present day southern continents. Should this be the 
case, two of these fronts are represented in the South 
America basement, in addition to Mediterranean-Middle 
East-Arabia, East Africa-Madagascar-India-Sri Lanka-
Antarctica, with ramifications to Zambezi and Damara, 
and Rokelides-Araguaia-Paraguay-Pampean. 

There are other models/versions of Gondwana forma-
tion, e.g. Stern (1994), Meert (2003) (Kuunga and East 
Africa orogenies); Zulauf et al. (2004) (Cadomian orogeny), 
Meet and Lieberman (2008), Linnemann et al. (2008, 2014) 
(North Africa, Cadomian orogeny), etc. See discussions in 
the next item of this paper. Consensus seems to be hard to 
achieve, and it will certainly take time to better understand 
amalgamation of Gondwana.

Independent of academic dissent, and aware of the need 
for new data, it can be stated that the Brasiliano collage in 
South America (and in part of westernmost Africa) com-
prises four distinct phases (main “pulses”), from the early 
Cryogenian (Neoproterozoic) to the early Ordovician (in 
some special cases, up to the upper Ordovician, ca. 440 Ma). 
The latest processes of collage fronts that ended up in Western 
Gondwana amalgamation are recorded in South America, 
and some similar and coeval events have been recorded in 
westernmost Africa (e.g. Schmitt et al. 2008; Schmitt &amp;amp; 
Armstrong 2014).

From Bahia to Uruguay, the Mantiqueira Province dis-
plays the most complete record of the main tectonic-mag-
matic events referred to above, including the Tonian ter-
ranes and the four Neoproterozoic pulses. None of the 
other provinces present such a complete record. However, 
as mentioned previously, there are some unsolved ques-
tions related to the adequate and precise discrimination of 
the pulses discussed above (pre-740 Ma; 650 – 630 Ma; 
590 – 560 Ma; 530 – 490 Ma). Also, it will be necessary 
to refine time interval limits, as well as to search for addi-
tional magmatic and metamorphic records. It should be 
noted that in the Araçuaí belt, northern portion of the 
Mantiqueira Province, late-collisional granites were intruded 
from 590 to 530 Ma. Similar intrusions were reported from 
the Borborema Province and other areas. However, robust 
isotopic data are lacking.

Where and when did Gondwana finally 
amalgamate?

In general, the orogenic processes that led to Gondwana 
amalgamation (Collins et al. 2011) are somewhat similar and 
coeval ( ~ 750Ma ± ?x – 500 Ma ± ?x), in its western as well 

as in its eastern portion. Early phases, nevertheless, display 
some important time differences. On the other hand, late- 
to post-orogenic events tend to overlap in the late Ediacaran, 
or in the middle Cambrian, occasionally extending into the 
Ordovician. This most important set of geotectonic processes 
coincides with one of the most dynamic periods of Earth 
evolution, involving all its geospheres and their compo-
nents. The overall time lapse comprised in this long, com-
plex and polyphase assembly process (ca. 280 – 250 Ma) 
is comparable to that of the assembly of Pangea, between 
500 and 230 Ma ago (270 Ma), for which scientific foun-
dation (Stratigraphy, Paleontology, Paleomagnetism) is 
much more reliable.

Similarities notwithstanding, detailed analysis of each 
portion of the continent shows that the orogenic collage 
pulses are quite distinct in time and importance. It should 
be noted that the polyphase development of Gondwana 
(Tab. 4) bears many similarities with the formation of 
Pangaea, where several phases (e.g. Caledonian, Alleghenian, 
etc.), are constantly highlighted. However it is well known 
that they are not exclusive.

Northern part of Gondwana
In northern Gondwana, three main orogenic phases have 

been distinguished (Linnemann et al. 2008, 2014; Pereira 
et al. 2012, among others), the last, related to the evolution 
of the Rheic ocean, and the initial development of Pangaea:

 ? Mid-Ediacaran, &gt; 590 – 570 Ma, magmatic arc stage 
(Avalonian) and formation of backarc basins;

 ? Late-Ediacaran, 570/560 – 545/543 Ma, oblique collision 
between the Cadomian arc and the hinterland, closing 
the Cadomian backarc basin and other related basins;

 ? Cambrian-early Ordovician, 540 ? 500/485 Ma. There 
is no abrupt break between the Cadomian orogeny and 
Cambro-Ordovician rifts, which led to the Rheic ocean 
opening. After collision, slab break-off is thought to 
have taken place from 540 Ma onwards, overlapping 
rifting and new ocean opening. U-Pb age data between 
522 and 499 Ma of the sedimentary deposits (Serra 
Negra succession, Pereira et al. 2012) indicate that they 
are part of a new post-discontinuity cycle above the Early 
Cambrian unconformity of 542 Ma.

Eastern Gondwana
Several distinct, although not necessarily opposite, 

digressions apply to eastern Gondwana evolution, from 
the Arabian–Nubian shield, to India, western Australia 
and Antarctica.

a) Collins and Pisarevsky (2005) provided an excellent 
synthesis based on rich paleogeographic documentation 
and paleomagnetic data of the whole evolutionary process,

starting at 750 Ma. The authors display the continental masses 
involved, as well as the intervening oceans (Mozambique, 
“Adola”, Adamastor, “Braziliano”, “Pacific”). Three orogenic 
phases of the collage are recognized:

 ? The first orogenic phase (c. 630 Ma) is recorded between 
east Africa (“Azania”) and the “Congo/Tanzania/
Bangweulu” (“CTB”) masses, and between these and the 
continental masses of the “Saharan metacraton”, includ-
ing closure of several minor ocean basins between them;

 ? Early Ediacaran (ca. 570 Ma), when “CTB” collided 
with the São Franciscano block. There is no record of 
this collision in South America, or of its continuity into 
the collision with “Azânia”;

 ? Early Cambrian (540 – 530 Ma), encompassing a 
series of collision processes east and west of India with 
“Austrália–Mawson”, and “Azânia”, and of “CTB” with 
Kalahari (including northern Mantiqueira Province?) and 
Rio de La Plata (Don Feliciano belt?). Associated with 
these processes, high-grade metamorphism took place 
in several of the resulting mobile belts.

b) Based on geochronological and other databases, 
Meert (2003) and Meert and Lieberman (2008) present 
different concepts and syntheses, displaying several notice-
able and well-documented phases for the 750 – 530 Ma 
time interval:

East African orogeny:
 ? ca. 750 Ma (between 780 and 720 Ma): important 

accretion phase, arc magmatism from northern Africa 
(Arabia-Nubian shield) to Antarctica.

 ? ca. 640 Ma (between 700 and 610 Ma): important 
phase of collisions, high-grade metamorphism, and in 
some cases initiation of escape tectonics (Arabia-Nubian 
shield, Somalia, Eritrea).

 ? ca. 550/540 Ma (between 590-520 Ma) — Kuunga 
orogeny —: collision, high-grade metamorphism and 
post-orogenic magmatism in several belts. Structures 
related to the Kuunga orogeny strike orthogonally to 
those of the East African orogen, between the south-
west coast of Africa (Damara), southern India and west-
ern Australia.

Meert (2003) has suggested that the 500 Ma old Ross-
Delamerian belt (Australia-Antarctica-South Africa) should 
be ascribed to a later event that took place after final sutur-
ing of Gondwana, adding to the controversy about the belt. 
This suggestion is a matter of dispute.

West Gondwana
As discussed above, and previously highlighted by Brito 

Neves and Fuck (2013), four main orogenic pulses are recorded

The Brasiliano collage in South America: a review 



in the Gondwana portion of South America. Further con-
siderations on the final orogenic processes (Pampean and 
Búzios) are presented below.

Buzios Orogeny
In the central-northern portion of the Mantiqueira 

Province, another Cambrian orogen is recognized, as dis-
cussed above. The orogenic belt appears to correspond to 
the closing of a small oceanic basin or back-arc, which 
remained between the “Terreno Oriental”, the upper plate 
of the Ribeira orogenic belt, and a colliding continental frac-
tion (Cabo Frio terrane), in the east, interpreted by some 
authors as a slice from the Congo craton/plate. 

The collisional process probably closed a remnant 
fraction of the Adamastor Ocean, and led to intense 
low-angle deformation and high-T amphibolite to granu-
lite facies metamorphism. Geological and geochronolog-
ical studies (Schmitt et al. 2008; Schmitt &amp;amp; Armstrong 
2014) identified Cambrian ages of 530 – 510 Ma for the 
orogeny, which was followed by collapse and extrusion 
between 510 and 480 Ma. Geological and geochrono-
logical equivalents were found in western Africa, within 
the Kaoko belt (Schmitt et al. 2008). Recently, Schmitt 
and Armstrong (2014) presented new data, reiterating the 
Middle to Late Cambrian age of 515 – 510 Ma, possibly 
extending up to 490 Ma, for the Búzios orogeny. Still 
not well-understood collapse processes occurred until the 
Mid Ordovician (c. 440 Ma). 

Pampean
Escayola et al. (2007) reported the Sm-Nd isochron age 

647 ± 77 Ma for ophiolite remnants and interpreted it as 
the best age estimate for the development of oceanic lith-
osphere in the belt. Early Cambrian ages of 530 – 514 Ma 
were recorded for the calk-alkaline arc magmatism and sub-
sequent metamorphism (collision).

Schwartz et al. (2008) concluded that subduction started at 
555 Ma, in the Ediacaran, establishing ages of 555 – 525 Ma for 
the arc magmatism, partially overlapping with the data of Escayola 
et al. (2007). They pointed out 525 Ma as the age of collision 
and metamorphism, revealing the record of Early Cambrian 
amalgamation of Gondwana in southwest South America.

Recent data (Rapela et al. 2014) added new informa-
tion to the age of the Pampean orogeny. Metasedimentary 
rocks affected by the orogeny include a 525 Ma old detri-
tal zircon peak among Neo- and Mesoproterozoic and older 
zircon grains. Therefore, ages younger than 525 Ma should 
be expected for the orogeny, allowing the possibility of ages 
from the Middle to Late Cambrian (&amp;lt;530 Ma).

It is also possible that these orogenic processes reached 
farther north, encompassing the southern branch of the 
Paraguay belt (MacGee et al. 2012). This proposition has 
been challenged by Cordani et al. (2013a).

Although remote, there is the possibility of a connection 
between the Pampean and the Ross-Delamerian orogens 
(positioned to the south of Gondwana, south of Antartica 
and Australia). Lack of data hampers discussion at this time.
