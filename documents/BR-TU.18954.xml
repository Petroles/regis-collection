Having graduated from the Belarusian State University as a Specialist in International 

Tourism Management and studied at the University of Algarve in the Master of Science in 

Sustainable Management of Rural Areas, I have managed to combine the knowledge I got 

with my personal interests in sustainability issues. In Belarus I concentrated on ecological 

tourism in our protected areas gradually turning from the ‘tourism manager’ view on it to 

‘nature conservationist’ one. The Master programme helped me to get a broader view on 

sustainable management concept. 

This thesis is a result of the author’s continuous work and dedication which, however, could 

not be possible without support and contribution of many people. 

First, I would like to thank my family and friends for their understanding, support and advice

RESUMO  

 

O presente estudo incide na análise comparativa das zonas húmidas de água doce em dois 

países - Belarus (país de origem do autor) e Portugal (país onde o autor frequentou o curso de 

Mestrado), nomeadamente para determinar as semelhanças e diferenças nas abordagens de 

conservação de zonas húmidas e práticas seguidas nos referidos países e identificar os 

aspectos positivos e experiências que pudessem ser utilizadas no futuro. Foram seleccionadas 

7 áreas de estudo – 3 turfeiras em Belarus e 4 zonas em Portugal (3 pauis e 1 turfeira).  

A pesquisa centrou-se nos aspectos da conservação da natureza, uso atual de recursos de 

zonas húmidas e as perspectivas futuras de uso e conservação. Também foram realizados 

inquéritos, com o objectivo de avaliar o comportamento dos turistas quando visitam esta 

tipologia de espaço. Neste enquadramento, em ambos os países, o autor participou em dois 

projetos de conservação de zonas húmidas.  

O trabalho tem a seguinte estrutura: 1 Introdução do estudo, onde são indicados os objetivos, 

a estrutura e a metodologia; 2 Estado da arte relativamente à visão das zonas húmidas de água 

doce de Belarus e de Portugal e as respectivas experiências de conservação; 3 Casos de 

estudo, onde são apresentadas as sete áreas de estudo e os dois projetos de conservação de 

zonas húmidas; 4 Resultados – análise comparativa do desempenho das áreas de estudo e da 

pesquisa sociológica; e por fim, 5. Conclusões. 

A pesquisa realizada permitiu um profundo conhecimento e compreensão da evolução das 

características das áreas de estudo, seu desempenho atual em conservação da natureza, 

ecoturismo e educação ambiental. Os principais resultados obtidos mostram que as áreas de 

estudo de Belarus e de Portugal são áreas de alto valor de conservação. No entanto, as 

abordagens e objectivos de conservação são bastante diferentes nos dois países: as zonas 

húmidas belarusas estão muito melhor conservadas e ativamente envolvidas em práticas de 

conservação regulares que provam ser altamente eficientes; os objectivos prioritários para as 

áreas são a sua restauração através da pesquisa científica, conservação e uso sustentável que 

significa a proteção, o desenvolvimento do ecoturismo, práticas de educação ambiental e 

envolvimento da população local. As zonas portuguesas estão bastante alteradas e sujeitas a 

ações de conservação pontuais; os objectivos prioritários para estas áreas são a conservação 

através de medidas para a recuperação de espécies e habitats, sem o objectivo prioritário de 

restauração de ecossistemas, verificando-se algumas limitações do seu uso por status de 

proteção e regulação de práticas ilegais, controle de visitas e desenvolvimento da educação 



5 

ambiental e ecoturismo. O conceito de abordagem em Portugal revela-se pouco sustentável, 

pois não recorre a atividades de conservação regulares e as zonas húmidas funcionam ou de 

proteção formal e prevenção de sua futura utilização ou concentram-se na educação 

ambiental. 

Os resultados da pesquisa sociológica também provam a maior eficiência do desempenho das 

áreas belarusas mostrando o maior nível de conhecimento sobre as áreas de estudo e as suas 

atividades.

ABSTRACT  

 

The present thesis is devoted to comparative study of freshwater wetland areas in 2 countries 

– Belarus (the country of the author’s origin) and Portugal (the country of Master studies). 7 

research sites were chosen – 3 mires in Belarus and 4 marshes in Portugal. The research was 

done in the field of their nature conservation performance, current use of wetland resources 

and future perspectives of use and conservation. Besides, the examples of the 2 successful 

wetland conservation projects in both countries, in which the author participated, were 

provided. Moreover, the sociological survey on assessing awareness of potential tourists 

about the research sites was conducted and its results presented. As a result, the comparative 

analysis was conducted to determine similarities and differences in wetland conservation 

approaches and practices in Belarus and Portugal and to identify the positive aspects and 

experience that could be used by each side in the future. 

The work has the following structure: 1. Introduction of the study, its objectives, structure, 

methodology; 2. Issue background – overview of Belarusian and Portuguese freshwater 

wetlands and their conservation experience; 3. Research data – presentation of the 7 research 

sites and 2 wetland conservation projects; 4. Results – comparative analysis of the research 

sites’ performance and analysis of the results of the sociological survey; 5. Conclusions 

The thesis research has produced a deep knowledge and understanding of the past and present 

features of the research sites, their current performance in nature conservation, ecotourism 

and environmental education. 

The main results obtained show that both Belarusian and Portuguese research sites are high 

conservation value areas. However, the conservation approaches and objectives are 

completely different in the countries: Belarusian wetland areas are much better conserved and 

actively involved in regular conservation practices which prove to be highly efficient; the 

priority objective set for the sites is their restoration through scientific research, conservation 

and sustainable use by protection, development of ecotourism, environmental education 

practices and involvement of local population. Portuguese sites are transformed to high extent 

and are subjected to unregular and inefficient conservation actions; the priority objective set 

for the sites is conservation of the sites through measures for recuperation of species and 

habitats without the objective of restoration of ecosystems, limitation of their use by 

protection status and regulation of illegal practices, visit control, and developing 

environmental education and ecotourism practices. In practice, the Portuguese concept proves 



7 

to be unsustainable: it does not imply regular conservation activities which causes further 

degradation of the landscapes and the sites either function for formal protection and 

prevention of their further use or concentrate on environmental education.  

The results of the survey also prove the higher efficiency of Belarusian sites’s performance 

showing higher level of awareness about the research sites and their activities.

1. Introduction 

 

1.1. Scope and framework of the study  

 

Nowadays wetland conservation is a topical issue since climate change leaves us fewer and 

fewer opportunities to survive and prosper on our planet. Conservation activities do not keep 

up with degradation processes, rising CO2 emissions, melting glaciers and dying coral reefs. 

Saving wetlands in this situation has become a potential solution since they carry out a crucial 

function – support of rich biodiversity, hydrological regulation, accumulation of CO2 in case 

of peatlands and other greenhouse gases which allow us to speed down global warming 

processes. Moreover, for Belarus it is highly useful since we plan to start selling carbon 

credits on account of existing and restored peatlands (Restoring Peatlands, 2011). 

On the other hand, a great wetland potential is simultaneously constrained by the degradation 

processes and its “adverse to natural” effects: biodiversity loss, fires, water pollution (IPCC, 

2014); degraded peatlands tend to produce greenhouse gas emissions due to decrease of 

groundwater level, peat fires and therefore contribute to climate change (Restoring Peatlands, 

2010a).  

What is more, climate change itself threatens wetlands since rising temperatures together with 

water run-off due to past drainage cause summer draughts and further loss of wetland 

functions. For instance, as Earth Peoples Blog, 2012 states, “warmer summer weather 

threatens to thaw the large peatland areas of Canada and Russia, causing them to decompose. 

There is also a risk that fossilised methane, stored under these areas, could be released”.  

It goes without saying that besides their air clearing capability, wetlands serve as habitats for 

unique species of flora and fauna. 

Thus, wetland conservation on a global scale is a planet-saving tool and it is important to 

develop and support cooperation between countries and conservation organizations so that 

they could share their experience, develop joint projects since wetlands do not see any 

country borders, they belong to nature. 

This thesis is meant to serve as an example of such cooperation, combination of knowledge 

and experience of two countries (Belarus and Portugal) so that efficient practices of each 

country could be studied on the examples of particular wetland sites and, perhaps, applied in 

the future in the other areas.

1.2. Objectives, structure and methodology of the research  

 

The objective of the thesis is set to carry out a comparative analysis of conservation concepts 

and practices of Belarus and Portugal by exploring the particular protected wetland areas in 

both countries (in the scheme below), analyzing their present status, activities and 

conservation and development projects ongoing there and provide examples of 2 projects (one 

for each country) by participating in it personally and collecting the information needed. 

The present master thesis has been divided into three parts: overview of wetlands in each 

country, analysis of the research sites and comparative analysis with conclusions. 

As for the first part of the work, to conduct analysis of the research sites, it was decided to 

make an overview of Belarusian and Portuguese wetlands so that the research sites and their 

characteristics could be seen within the general concept of wetland conservation in each 

country. This overview has been based on the following points:  

? historical context, area size and value; 

? scientific research and conservation activities in recent years. 

The second part of the work is devoted to analysis of the research sites (Table 1.1) including 

characterization of the 2 nature conservation projects – Aquatic Warbler Conservation project 

in Belarus and LIFE Trachemys in Portugal in which I participated and which are 

representative for the work since they reflect current issue in freshwater wetland conservation 

field in the two countries. The Belarusian project was carried out on 2 of the research sites. 

The Portuguese one was not carried out on the research sites but since it is one of the few 

current projects on wetland conservation in Portugal and the author participated in it, the 

project was included for analysis in the thesis.

In addition, water quality analysis was conducted for the 3 Portuguese sites and 1 Belarusian. 

Peat analysis results were obtained for 1 Portuguese and 3 Belarusian sites. 

Wetland condition analysis was carried out for all the sites using the data of the National 

System of Information on Hydrological Resources and the results of the previous researches 

on water quality parameters in the study areas. 

What is more, besides the analysis of the sites, the sociological survey was carried out to 

assess awareness of Belarusian and Portuguese people about wetlands in general and the 

research sites in particular and attractiveness of these sites for ecotourism. The results were 

further analyzed and included in the research data. 

Finally, comparative analysis is conducted in the third part of the work and conclusions of the 

research made having proved the efficiency of the work done and brought about interesting 

results that can be applied further in wetland conservation management both in Belarus and 

Portugal.

The basis of the work was choosing several protected areas in Belarus and Portugal. A deep 

information research was conducted so that the author could distinguish potential territories 

for research in the two countries since comparative analysis is efficient as long as it can 

provide useful results. This is only possible when the objects of research from the two sides 

have common or similar characteristics, problems and reasons for these problems. In this case 

the ways to tackle those problems (projects, development plans) by one side can be of great 

help for the other.  

Thus, the criteria for choosing wetlands for my research were based on my knowledge of 

particular Belarusian protected wetland sites and their features – they are all freshwater 

marshes of 2 types – fen mires and peat bogs, all of them with the consequences of drainage 

and (or) intensive agricultural use in the 20
th

 century. Such consequences are violation of 

hydrological regime, water and soil contamination, destruction of habitats of plants and 

animals. Most of the sites are protected and involved in active conservation actions on 

restoration of hydrological regime by vegetation management, renaturalisation of habitats 

through rewetting of drained territories, ecotourism and environmental education. So, 

knowing that Portugal possesses similar territories it was extremely interesting for me to 

conduct research so that I could find examples of efficient conservation work and use this 

experience in Belarus, and share our conservation practices. So, obviously, since I was 

searching for successful models of development and Belarusian sites showed active 

conservation and development status it was necessary for me to explore “active” wetlands in 

Portugal with the following characteristics:  

? protected sites since they could provide conservation examples, unprotected ones, on the 

opposite, do not allow for getting enough information; 

? those which hold scientific research, ecotourism activities, conservation projects, active 

and accessible research teams so that I could communicate with them and see the possibilities 

of efficient wetland use and conservation.  

Having analysed general information on Portuguese wetlands I pointed out several criteria for 

choosing these or those territories: 

? wetland type: I needed marshes with characteristics similar to Belarusian ones, freshwater, 

at least one with peat deposit since all the Belarusian research sites are peaty; 

? conservation status and history (problems that caused the need for protection, in Belarus it 

is drainage and its effects); 

? present activities in the area; 



17 

? present challenges and conservation projects; 

? future plans; 

? the number of chosen territories was also meaningful. It must have been enough to get real 

results, not too many. 

So, there were 3 already chosen Belarusian sites – 2 fen mires and 1 peat bog. 

As for Portugal, it turned out peaty areas are mostly found in the Azores (which was not the 

thesis case, since these are islands) and in the mountainous regions of continental Portugal 

(some peat marshes are natural, the other ones with the consequences of intensive agriculture 

and little conservation work). Thus, the latter ones were not suitable for comparison with 

Belarusian peatlands, situated on flatlands, big in size and suffered from drainage, now being 

restored and actively studied. Only one Portuguese peatland was chosen for the thesis, to give 

an example of undisturbed peatland landscape in the country, provide information on its 

historical formation and human use and check its current state. 

The other 3 chosen Portuguese wetlands sites are mainly freshwater marshes, with similar to 

Belarus drainage consequences and current development scheme (so it seemed after the 

primary analysis). Of course, it was impossible to know for sure those sites would be suitable 

enough from the point of view of current conservation actions and their efficiency, this could 

only be known after visiting them. Fortunately, from the Belarusian side it was known our 

sites have shown positive results of their conservation activities. It would have been good if 

the Portuguese ones also had had. 

So, I have finally chosen 3 sites from each side, and 1 additional in Portugal since it was a 

peat bog, the only one among the Portuguese research sites but not representative enough for 

description of nature conservation activities.  

Analysis of the research sites implied visiting them, contacting research teams there and 

collecting all the necessary information, as well as developing criteria for comparative 

analysis. 

Analysis of each site was carried out using the following analysis scheme: location, history 

and present main features, protection regime, area size and zoning, natural values, current 

state: threats, management: past and present, what needs to be done and what is planned. 

Analysis of the 2 conservation projects was based on the information obtained from the 

project managers (Malashevich, 2013-2014 and CIBIO, 2013) and personal experience from 

participation in them. 

Water quality and peat analysis of the Belarusian sites was based on the research data 

obtained from Bahadziazh (2010), Thiele et al. (2012), Tanavickaja (2013).

Water quality analysis of the Portuguese sites was based on the data from the Sistema 

Nacional de Informação de Recurcos Hídricos (2013) and the research studies of Brito and 

Mieiro (2000), Silva (2007). 

The peat ph analysis at the peatbog of Lagoa de D. João was conducted with deionized water, 

a ph meter Hanna Combo (Figure A87, Appendix), KCL solutions. Samples were obtained at 

the 4 points of the bog (3 samples at each location). 40 cm
3
 peat samples were mixed with 

100 cm
3
 1M KCL solutions. The ph meter was placed inside for 20-30 seconds. Analysis 

process and equipment are shown on Figure A88, Appendix. 

Moreover, the von Post Decomposition Index has been assessed for the research site (Figure 

A89, Appendix) which implies assessement of distinctness of the structure of plant remains 

and colour, determined by squeezing wet peat in the hand. 

Wetland condition analysis was carried out with the use of the method of Clarkson et al., 

(2003). Wetland Record Sheet was filled for each site and wetland condition index 

determined. 

The survey was created with the SurveyMonkey service and was spread through emails, 

Facebook, V kontakte (Belarus) and word of mouth. 

Each survey consisted of 10 questions (https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/999GRKN, 

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SLHYBV7), allowing to determine the type of persons’s 

activity (work, hobby – connected/not connected with nature conservation, tourism, 

environmental education), evaluate their awareness about the wetlands (marshes, fens and 

bogs) and wetland protected sites of the country in general and knowledge about the particular 

wetland research sites of the thesis. 

Comparative approach was further applied for the analysis of Belarusian and Portuguese 

research sites. The criteria were established taking into account the ones that were used for 

characterization of each protected area. Thus, they are as follows: protection status, historical 

aspect of wetlands’ formation, uniqueness, current threats, management, nature conservation 

activities, ecotourism, water quality, public awareness, overall performance. It is also 

important to note that the 4th research site in Portugal (the peatbog in Lagoa do Dom João) 

will not be included into the analysis since it has been an example of Portuguese peaty marsh 

but completely natural and with no nature conservation management.

2. Issue background 

 

2.1 Overview of Belarusian wetlands 

 

2.1.1 Historical context, area size and value 

 

Belarus has always been the land of wetlands. The world indicator for wetland areas 

percentage is 6 % (AAAS, 2014), for the marshes (mires, peatlands) – 3.4 % (Chichko, 2010) 

whereas in Belarus it is 7 % and 6.4 % respectively (Astapovich, 2011). It holds 17
th

 place in 

the world by the peatland area (Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012).  

Furthermore, Belarus has 16 Ramsar sites with a surface area of 614 708 ha (Ramsar, 2013a), 

all of them being specially protected nature areas of a various state status: one national park 

and zakaznik (reserves). Besides, not only Ramsar sites but other wetlands are Important Bird 

Areas, Belarus has 49 such areas (Birdlife, 2014c). Among wetland types the dominant ones 

for Belarus are fen mires and peat bogs, the other ones being lakes. 

In the 1960s wetlands covered 15% of the country whereas mires were spread on 14,2% 

(Chichko, 2010), almost half of that area suffered from massive drainage in the 1960-1990s. 

As a result the area of mires decreased to 6.4 % (Astapovich, 2011), the remaining area 

having been drained for the purpose of agriculture, forestry, and peat extraction.  

All in all, Belarusian mires can be divided into 3 groups by their current state: natural ones 

with disrupted hydrology; drained and being used ones; abandoned drained peatlands being 

restored in the recent years. The natural ones with disrupted hydrology are in a natural state 

but are influenced by the surrounding drained areas, thus, have experienced disturbance of 

hydrological regime, water pollution, overgrowth with reeds. The main conservation 

measures are habitat and vegetation management. The drained peatlands which continue to be 

used for peat extraction, agriculture are out of the conservation measures. The abandoned 

drained peatlands are current restoration project sites that have recently been rewetted. 

It should be noted that drained peatland sites have caused large CO2 releases due to peat 

decomposition whereas these areas are naturally meant to accumulate CO2 and thus reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions. These degraded wetland areas are the reason for Belarus being the 

8
th

 in the CO2 emissions list (IMCG, 2014). 

 

 



20 

Biodiversity value 

According to BrantaTours, 2014, Belarusian wetlands are responsible for rich biodiversity 

being habitat for key rare and endangered plant species such as rare species of orchids, 

lichens, mosses, typical mire plant communities; rare bird species such as Greater Spotted 

Eagle, Aquatic Warbler, Common Crane, Corncrake, Short-eared Owl. 

Bogs are a place to see Terek, Marsh and Green Sandpipers, Whimbrel, Curlew, 

Golden and Ringed Plovers, Black-tailed Godwit, Greenshank, Redshank, Snipe, Great Snipe, 

Redshank, Spotted Redshank, Great Grey Shrike, Meadow Pipit, Citrine and Yellow 

Wagtails, whilst the edges surrounding the pine bogs are typical breeding place for Osprey, 

Golden and Short-toed Eagles, Hobby and Merlin. 

Open meadows and mires are hunting grounds for various birds-of-prey breeding in 

neighbouring floodplains and forests, such as White-tailed, Short-toed, Greater and Lesser 

Spotted Eagles, Honey Buzzard, Goshawk, Great Grey and Short-eared Owls. 

Old floodplain forests feature Hazel Grouse, Capercaillie, Woodcock, Middle Spotted 

Woodpecker, Black Stork, Eagle Owl, Roller, Redwing and Azure Tit. 

Besides birds, mammals are also encountered in the wetland areas and in the neighboring 

forests: Gray Wolf, Brown Bear, Wild Boar, Eurasian Lynx, Racoon Dog, Eurasian Elk, 

European Roe Deer, European Beaver, European Bison, European Mink. 

Thus, the wetlands of Belarus are an interesting tourist attraction that is well-known within 

the bird watching community and is promoted in the country and for foreign visitors. 

 

2.1.2 Scientific research and conservation activities in recent years 

 

In the 1990-2000s foreign scientists stimulated arising interest in wetland conservation in 

Belarus, having developed several projects, the most important one was connected with the 

discovery of the globally threatened bird species of Aquatic Warbler on one of the Belarusian 

fen mires and further research on this bird dependency on suitable wetland conditions 

(Kozulin and Flade, 1999). 

For the recent 25 years there has been done a lot in the area of wetland conservation. Here are 

one of the most significant actions implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus, UNDP Belarus, 

various Ministries, local executive committees, local forestry entreprises, local population, 

volunteers with both national and foreign financial support (UNDP, GEF, European Union 

funds, USAID, Michael Otto foundation for environmental protection (Germany), Michael

peatlands rewetted and rehabilitated, their long-term protection secured, reduction of CO2 

emissions by at least 300,000 tons annually, populations of threatened biodiversity species 

stabilized, risk of fires diminished significantly (UNDP, 2010b); 

? Restoring Peatlands and Applying Concepts for Sustainable Management in Belarus 

(2008-2012) – implemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus and the Michael Succow Foundation in 

cooperation with RSPB and the Government of Belarus. The project is financed by German 

government through KfW bank. 10 designated sites – a large scale peatland investigation and 

rewetting programme: rewetting of ca 15 000 ha of degraded peatlands and calculation of 

greenhouse gas emission reductions to facilitate certification and sale of carbon credits on the 

voluntary market (Restoring peatlands, 2010b); 

? Creation of conditions for the development of eco-tourism at the Republican 

Biological Reserve “Sporaúski” (Biaroza district) with the minimal environmental 

impact (2008-2009) – implemented by the local village council, funded by GEF-SGP: 

construction of ecological trails for tourists and schoolchildren, organization of environmental 

activities for raising public awareness, organization of open championship on hay mowing 

(GEF-SGP, 2008a); 

? Eight wetlands 2011-now – web-project created to raise public awareness about the 

government decision on reduction of the area of 8 wetland reserves for using that land for peat 

extraction: as a result of public signing of the petitions and active media coverage of the 



23 

problem, one of the reserves has managed to be left without any changes in its area, the 

situation of the other ones has not been decided on yet (Eight Wetlands, 2011). This campaign 

has been doing a lot in raising public awareness about Belarusian wetlands and their present 

problems, widening the audience of indifferent people further than ecological community; 

? Aquatic Warbler (AW) conservation in Belarus project (2002 – up to now) has been 

implemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus with support of RSPB. Belarus hosts 40% of this 

globally threatened species, mostly on 3 key breeding sites of Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje; 

the bird serves as an indicator of wetland conservation state. What is done: habitat 

management, monitoring of Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution, Aquatic Warbler 

counts in Sporava, Zvaniec and Dzikoje sites, study of migrations (Ministry, 2006; 

Malashevich, 2012). The AW counts project is fully described in chapter 3.1.4; 

? Sustainable scheme for peatland conservation and management developed: 

transformation of the current approach to peatland use (balancing real income from peat 

extraction by hypothetical arguments of biodiversity conservation)to the new one (balancing 

real income from peat extraction by real income from peatland restoration and conservation) 

(Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012): 

Key elements of this scheme (Figure A3, Annex) are practical (how to reach maximum effect 

for climate and biodiversity during rewetting), scientific (how to estimate the amount of 

emission reductions and the effect on biodiversity), economical (how to ensure flow of funds 

for future managing rewetted peatlands and continuation of the work on restoration of 

degraded peatlands; how to balance real money from peat extraction by real money from 

peatland restoration and conservation) and political (how to ensure the recognition of the 

significance of mires/peatlands and their importance for climate balance). 

Economical effect is planned to be reached through selling carbon emission reductions on the 

international carbon market (Fenchuk and Kazulin, 2012); 

? Secondary bogging of exhausted peat field “Choreúskaje” and “Astro?úskaje” with 

the purpose CO2 emission reduction, prevention of peat fires and biodiversity protection 

(2009-2012) – implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus, Mijory and Pružany village councils, 

Pružany forestry entreprise, Je?nia reserve administration, with the support of the Ministry of 

Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, funded by GEF-SGP: waterlogging of the 

depleted part of peat bog, restoration of hydrological regime and peat ecosystem on the 2 

lowland bogs in the aim of prevention of peat fires, reduction of CO2 emission, preservation 

of biodiversity (GEF-SGP and APB, 2009a); 



24 

? Sustainable Management of Wetland Protected Areas of International Importance in 

Stolin district (2012-2013) – implemented by the local village council, funded by GEF-SGP: 

creating condtions for development of ecotourism, environmental education in Mid-Prypia? 

reserve, upgrade of buildings of the reserve with energy-efficient technologies (SGP-GEF, 

2012); 

? Clima East “Conservation and sustainable management of peatlands in Belarus to 

minimize carbon emissions and help ecosystems to adapt to climate change” (2014-2020) 

– implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection with the 

support of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, national reserves Zvaniec and 

Sporava, local authorities of the Drahi?yn and Biaroza districts and APB-BirdLife Belarus, 

funded by UNDP-GEF: aimed at restoration of Sporava and Zvaniec fen mires by mechanized 

mowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette production (ClimaEast, 2014); 

? Berries of Stolin district (2014-2015) - implemented by the local company, funded by 

GEF-SGP: the goal is to create conditions for reducing the degradation of peatlands in the 

western part of the Stolin district, through their involvement in agricultural use and setting up 

blueberry plantations; diversify agricultural production in private households of Stolin district 

by blueberry production development, including involvement of degraded peatlands (GEF-

SGP, 2014); 

Thus, wetland, and mostly, peatland conservation in Belarus implies combination of 2 aspects 

– conservation and education&amp;amp;ecotourism. The conservation aspect involves conservation and 

scientific research, ensurance of formal protection of the areas, development of their 

management plans and creation of the administrations of the wetland reserves (the last 

measure was first implemented within the project, proved to be successful, was approved by 

legislation and now is practicedon the state level) (Malashevich, 2013-2014). 

There are lots of bureaucratic barriers faced by the Belarusian environmental NGOs such as 

obligatory registration of the projects (only on condition of Letter of Support from the 

Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection), obligatory use of all the money 

during the project (no possibility of savings, only target use of funds) (Malashevich, 2013-

2014), financial control of the organizations by the state, financial problems (only foreign 

funding which is often difficult to get), state management focused on getting only financial 

benefits, neglecting environmental aspect, lack of ecological awareness in the society caused 

by a short history of ecological movement in Belarus. 

However, the wetland conservation community in Belarus is rather strong and not 

concentrated on science only, they also devote their work to people and raising their interest 



25 

in nature conservation. For example, there are voluntary camps annually organized by 

APB-Birdlife Belarus within the Aquatic Warbler conservation project, dam 

construction on Je?nia peatbog; birds festival in Turaú, seasonal bird observations, 

public petitions on the Internet, infocampaigns through creation of commercials, videos, 

organization of educational activities in public places.  

Moreover, local communities play a significant role in saving traditional environments in 

their villages. The success of the past and present activities is in complex use of conservation 

instruments (State-NGO dialog, foreign funding, scientific community, public campaigns, 

local population involvement, enthusiasm and concern about saving nature and its elements).

2.2 Overview of Portuguese freshwater wetlands 

 

2.2.1 Historical context, area size and value 

 

Portuguese continental wetlands (both freshwater and saltwater) are located mostly along the 

coast of the country representing various wetland types, both natural and human-made: rivers, 

lakes, ponds, creeks, estuarine lagoons with extensive dune systems, mudflats and reedbeds, 

artificial salinas, alluvial plains; swamps, bogs, saltpans and saltmarshes, freshwater marshes 

with series of drainage canals surrounded by agricultural lands and forest, rice fields and 

fishfarms, peat bogs.  

Agricultural development has led to drainage of marshes and meadows, afforestation of 

marginal lands during the 20
th

 century which have caused disturbance of hydrological regime 

of the areas, soil erosion, increased water run-off, irregular river discharge, and 

transformation of the landscpaes due to overgrowth with invasive plant species. This has 

posed a threat to a lot of aquatic bird species which have always used the wetland areas as 

migrating stopovers, breeding and nesting sites. 

Work on making inventory of the Portuguese wetlands started in 1975 but had not brought 

any real result until 1999 when the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests started a 

project on conservation of wetlands having developed Action Strategy for the project focused 

on the need for National Inventory of Wetlands (ZHP, 2014). 

Wetland conservation was set as a priority in the National Strategy for Conservation of Nature 

and Biodiversity in 2001 (ZHP, 2014). 

There is no accurate information on the whole wetland cover in Portugal. As for now, there is 

information that there are 1302 wetland areas (ZHP, 2014) identified in Portugal, continental 

and island parts (the Azores and Madeira). Moreover, according to MedWet/WIS database 

there are 527 wetland sites covering 5.07 % of the overall number of Mediterranean wetlands 

(MedWet and Kapanidis, 2014).  

The terms for the types of wetlands in Portuguese are various – estuário (estuary), sapal 

(saltmarsh), charco (swamp, bog, mire), paul (more or less close to marsh), lagoa (pond), lago 

(lake), ribeira (river), pantano (swamp), turfa (peatbog), which can be natural, artificial, 

permanent or temporary. The 3 research sites of the thesis (Paul de Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo, 

Paul da Tornada) are of the “paul” type which is closest to marsh in Belarus. The research 

peat site (Lagoa de D.João) is closest to peat bog in Belarus. 



27 

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands came into force for Portugal in 1981. Portugal presently 

has 31 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance, with a surface area 

of 132,487 hectares which is 1.44% of the whole country area (Ramsar, 2013b). See Table 

2.1. 

Analysis of the Ramsar list of Portugal allows us to classify the Ramsar sites according to 

their types. 

Continental freshwater wetlands are 12 of 31 Ramsar sites, belonging to the “permanent 

freshwater marshes/pools, seasonal/intermittent streams/rivers, non-forested and forested 

peatlands” types (Ramsar classification).  

The Azores possess 10 freshwater Ramsar wetlands – forested and non-forested peatlands, 

permanent/seasonal freshwater lakes/marshes/pools (Table 2.1). 

Thus, Portugal on the whole has 22 internationally protected fully or partially freshwater 

wetlands covering almost 16% of the Ramsar areas of Portugal (Figure A4, Appendix). 

Calculations were made using the data on Ramsar sites of Portugal.

area, percentage) (Ramsar, 2013)

? other 3 110 0.001  

 

Thus, Ramsar continental freshwater wetlands of Portugal cover 0.09 % of the country area or 

6.3 % of the Portuguese Ramsar area (Table 2.2).

Moreover, these areas are all protected at the national or municipal level, having different 

state protection statuses: 5 natural parks, 8 natural reserves, 1 local natural reserve, part of 1 



28 

national ecological reserve, 1 protected landscape, 1 natural regional monument, Rede Natura 

2000 sites, UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, Sites of Community Importance, Special 

Protection Areas (ICNF, 2014c) (Table A1, Annex). Besides, Portugal has designated 33 

freshwater wetland areas as Important Bird Areas (Birdlife, 2014d). 

 

Value 

The Portuguese continental freshwater wetlands are important wintering and resting grounds 

for migratory aquatic bird species using the Eastern Atlantic flyway to Africa (Ramsar, 

2013b). Moreover, many threatened species populations are supported thanks to the wetland 

areas as their breeding and nesting points: bird species (ducks, herons, flamingos, waders), 

mammal species (European otter, Wildcat), indigenous fish species (Iberian barbel), reptiles, 

amphibians. 

What is more, the wetlands serve for regulation of the groundwater level, flood prevention, 

and human activities such as fishing, aquaculture, shellfish trade, traditional salt production. 

Peatbogs situated in the Portuguese mountaineous areas, have an important function of CO2 

storage. 

 

2.2.2 Scientific research and conservation activities in recent years 

 

Conservation of wetlands in Portugal is an important aspect of its conservation policy. Having 

ratified the Ramsar convention in 1981, the country has done a lot in designation of 31 

wetland sites for conservation, development of Site Management Plans and promotion of 

aquatic bird protection and sustainable use of wetland resources. Conservation of freshwater 

wetlands is part of the wetland conservation policy, 22 Ramsar sites out of 31 being fully or 

partially freshwater ones.  

However, freshwater wetlands, as it seen above in the text, cover a small percentage of the 

protected wetland areas; second, some of them have been seriously transformed by man and 

have lost their natural functions; third, the Portuguese conservation approach in some wetland 

protected areas (the thesis research sites are an example) does not imply recuperation of 

habitats with their primary functions but means their designation with conservation status and 

minimizing human impact on the area, work with local population, regulation of hunting, 

fishing which often turns out to be permission for further landscape transformation with rare 

conservation actions. On the other hand, there are freshwater wetland areas where 



29 

conservation and educational projects are actively developed and implemented and positive 

results obtained in both biodiversity conservation and rasing public awareness. 

Conservation projects developed and implemented in Portugal are usually those in 

cooperation with the EU countries and with the EU funds support. Here are several projects 

brought to life in the recent 20 years in the freshwater wetlands of Portugal: 

? multiple researches on various conservation aspects undertaken by groups of scientists 

from the universities, environmental organizations (for example, researches for Ramsar Site 

Management Plans, studies on expansive vegetation growth, evaluation of environmental 

quality in the wetland reserves made by the specialists of the Institute for Conservation of 

Nature and Forests, the University of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Algarve); 

? MedWet1 (1992-1996) – project of the Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative, aimed at 

developing conservation methods and tools that would be specific to the Mediterranean, 

initially involving 5 EU countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) while also 

involving the countries of North Africa and the Middle East. The project was led initially by a 

Steering Committee chaired by the EC and then the Ramsar Bureau (MedWet, 2010a). 

There were 5 sites participating in the project (one for each country). In Portugal it was Sado 

Estuary. The objectives set were as follows: to develop methods and tools specific to 

Mediterranean wetlands in five areas: inventory and monitoring, wetlands management, 

training, public awareness, research results and dissemination. As a result, the developed tools 

were applied to the research sites: 5 manuals for Inventory of Mediterranean Wetlands, 

methodological guide for monitoring, training modules for management and monitoring 

wetland vegetation; 

? SUDOE: Inventory, assessment and monitoring for wetland management (2003-2004) 

– MedWet project implemented in 16 wetland sites of Portugal (7) and Spain (9) (among 

them Paul de Arzila Natural Reserve, one of the thesis research sites). The objectives were as 

follows: to provide the SUDOE region (Southwestern Europe) with a tool for the elaboration 

of management and monitoring plans for wetlands, to improve the MedWet inventory 

methodology for wetlands, to promote public awareness and participation, contribute to the 

institutional development of each partner through exchange of information and 

communication of results (MedWet, 2010b).  

The results achieved: new datasheets added to the MedWet inventory methodology; 

cartographic conventions and data management with a GIS; seminars, training courses, 

contribution to management plans of the sites, habitat description system applied to the sites; 



30 

? Charcos com Vida – initiated by CIBIO in 2014: an educational campaign aimed at 

creation of inventory on charcos (wetland type) and raising public interest and awareness, 

focusing on the primary and secondary schoolchildren. The project suggests “adoption” of the 

charcos (taking responsibility for characterization, observation, investigation, maintenance of 

the area, organization of educational activities, spreading information about the intiative) or 

construction of the new charcos according to the techniques provided. This could be done by 

schools or other interested entities. Moreover, the project provides pedagogical materials on 

various aspects of the issue; 

LIFE programme has been a successful initiative for Portugal, having funded multiple 

conservation projects. Since its launch in 1992, there have been 73 projects in the field of 

nature conservation in Portugal (EU, 2014). Below are the LIFE projects implemented and 

planned for implementation in the freshwater wetlands of Portugal: 

? LIFE Re-establishment of the Baixo Mondego marshes (1st phase, 1993-1995) – 

coordinated by the National Service of Parks, Reserves and Nature Conservation: 

preservation the three wetlands of the Baixo Mondego marshes (Paul de Arzila, Paul da 

Madriz and Paul do Taipal) (EU, 1993): purchase of lands by state, innovative techniques in 

agriculture, creation of infrastructure for visits. 

? LIFE Porphyrio - Porphyrio project - Reintroduction of the Purple Gallinule in the 

Lower Mondego River Valley (1998-2001) – implemented by the Institute of the Sea with 

the support of the Institute for Conservation of Nature and Forests in Paul de Arzila and Paul 

de Madriz reserves: restoring a viable population of purple gallinules in the lower Mondego 

by re-introducing birds from Spain (EU, 1998). This project was innovative in Portugal, for it 

was the first time that a soundly structured and monitored bird reintroduction plan was 

implemented. 

? LIFE Palustris - Palustris, Management of the Special Area of Conservation of the 

Marsh of Arzila (2001-2006) – implemented by the Institute for Conservation of Nature and 

Forests and Paul de Arzila Nature Reserve (EU, 2001).  

? LIFE Trachemys (2011-2013) – EU funded project for Spain and Portugal on eradication 

of alien species of freshwater turtles thorugh their captures: the results are described in 

chapter 3.2.5 (EU, 2011). 

? LIFE Ecotone Management of riparian habitats towards the conservation of 

endangered invertebrates (2012-2016) – implemented by QUERCUS (EU, 2012). 



31 

This project is targeting the conservation of alder alluvial forests in two Portuguese rivers 

(Rio Paiva, Torgal stream in Costa Sudoeste), in order to increase the populations of three 

species of dragonfly. The project also sets out to improve the conservation status of two 

species of freshwater pearl mussels (EU, 2012a). 

? LIFE Charcos Conservation of Temporary Ponds in the Southwest Coast of Portugal 

(2013-2017) – implemented by the League of Nature Conservation. Mediterranean temporary 

ponds (CTMs) are seasonal wetland habitats, subjected to extreme and unstable ecological 

conditions (EU, 2013). Due to their uniqueness and scientific value, they are listed as a 

priority habitat for conservation in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. The project’s 

overall aim is to enhance the conservation status in southwest Portugal of Mediterranean 

temporary ponds (CTMs) (EU, 2013). 

Expected results: The project’s main expected result is to halt the loss of temporary ponds in 

the Costa do Sudoeste Natura 2000 site, reversing the declining trend observed in the past few 

years. Conservation and demonstration actions are planned for at least 16 temporary ponds, 

and in some of the ponds more than one type of conservation action will be applied 

simultaneously. 

It can be seen from the information above that there have been various initiatives in the field 

of freshwater wetland conservation in Portugal. Some of them are implemented in the 

protected areas, the other ones concern the unprotected territories in need for conservation 

actions. The projects are funded from the EU funds (LIFE, joint country initiatives) and 

brought to life by Portuguese NGOs (Quercus, League for the Protection of Nature, etc) and 

governmental environmental entities (ICNF, administrations of the protected areas). However, 

it should be noted that funding for the project is difficult to obtain in Portugal, and the process 

of project implementation is often delayed or disturbed by bureaucratic barriers. The 

conservation initiatives are implemented more efficiently within the particular projects in the 

unprotected wetland areas and are sporadic under the management policy of the protected 

ones. The wetland conservation community in Portugal is devoted to their goals but lacks 

motivation and reliable sources for that: its members have faced so many obstacles on their 

way (both at the European, national and local level) that the low efficiency of their current 

work can be seen as a consequence of the previous processes.

3. Research data 

 

3.1 Research sites: Belarus 

 

3.1.1 Sporava mire 

 

3.1.1.1 Location 

 

Sporava mire is a fen mire (Europe’s largest complex of natural floodplain fen mires) situated 

in Southwest Belarus, Brest region, in the area of 4 districts – Biaroza, Drahi?yn, Ivanava and 

Ivacevi?y, in the floodplain of the middle course of the Jasie?da River, left affluent of the 

Prypia? River, Black Sea basin (NAS, 2009a) (Figure 3.1). 

 

Figure 3.1 Location of Sporava mire (Google Earth; Malashevich, 2014a) 

 



33 

3.1.1.2 History and present main features 

 

The area of the reserve is represented by the landscapes of ancient alluvial lowlands with wide 

and poorly drained floodplain and floodplain terraces complicated by lake and peat-filled 

depressions. First, there is a tectonic fracture in the area between such tectonic structures as 

Palie?sie depression in the east and Brest depression in the west which served as a pre-

condition for wetland formation. Second, there is a lake-mire depression in the area of Lake 

Sporaúskaje formed in the postglacial period (NAS, 2009a). Thus, there are at least two 

factors which determined the conditions of excess wetting of the area. 

The Jasie?da floodplain, which is 0.5–2 km wide, is a typical fen mire. Lowland mires 

absolutely dominate the landscape occupying peaty or peaty-gleyed moderately acid soils 

(NAS, 2009a). A typical feature of Sporava mire is the layer of sapropel under peat which is a 

clear evidence of past existence of shallow lakes on this territory. 

There has been developed the following scenario of Sporava mire formation:  

? 13 thousand years ago the alluvial lowland was occupied by the rather stagnant shallow 

lake with the ongoing process of sapropel deposition. The process was rather slow due to cold 

weather conditions and poor mineral nutrition; 

? 6.5 thousand years ago there was a blowout of the water from the lake which caused 

further formation of the Jasie?da River. The ancient lake gradually became shallow and started 

to turn into the mire, whereas its former area turned into the Jaselda floodplain. Peat 

deposition has occurred since that in the floodplain (NAS, 2009a). 

The mires within the reserve comprise a solid continuous tract (75% of the area) stretched 

along the Jasie?da River for about 35 km (NAS, 2009a).  The centre of the reserve is occupied 

by Lake Sporaúskaje which provides conditions for close proximity of ground water table to 

the soil surface.  

Most of the site is covered by open fens and shrubs. There are numerous small hills and low 

mineral islands scattered across the mire. In the past, these mineral islands were covered by 

oak and pine woods. Eventually the forests were cut, and the islands were used as agricultural 

fields and pastures. Today most agricultural fields are abandoned and the natural vegetation is 

regenerating. Nowadays the hills are covered with oak, birch, black alder and ash. 

Most of the site area appears to be in condition very close to the natural one, however, it is 

influenced by the surrounding areas which were drained for agricultural purposes and 

intensively used in the 1970-80s (NAS, 2009a). Around 20 years ago all the drainage system 

was turned off, however, the consequences of its construction continue to influence the mire. 



34 

As APB, 2009b states, before drainage the hydrological regime of the Jasie?da River was 

typical of flatland rivers: every spring high floods would occur, followed by prolonged 

summer dry periods, regularly interrupted by rainfall. Sialiec fishfarm and a reservoir were 

constructed in the river floodplain (NAS, 2009a). They have seriously influenced the 

hydrological regime of the river. In the past, in spring the filling of the fishfarm’s ponds was 

carried on, so spring floods were almost absent, but summer inundations have become 

common since in the summer the fishfarm let out the water intensively and high rains added 

to the flooding, thus, this caused increase in ground nesting birds’ mortality. Disruptions in 

the hydrological regime have resulted in intense overgrowth of the river channel and the lake, 

severe annual inundation of the floodplain and catastrophic droughts and fires during the year. 

In 1991 the Sporava mire got a state protection status of a biological reserve and became 1
st
 

Ramsar site in Belarus in 1999 (NAS, 2009a). 

 

3.1.1.3 Protection regimes 

 

Sporava mire has the following national and international protection statuses: 

? National – Sporaúski state biological reserve (zakaznik) established in 1991,  

renamed and expanded Sporaúski republican biological reserve established in 1999 

(NAS, 2009a). Logo of the reserve is on Figure 3.2, showing the Aquatic Warbler 

as a key species; 

 

Figure 3.2 Logo of the reserve (Wikimapia, 2014) 

 

? International – Ramsar site established in 1999 (first in Belarus), Important Bird Area 

(IBA) established in 1998 (Ramsar, 2013a). 

 

3.1.1.4 Area size and zoning 

 

Sporaúski reserve has an area of 19 384 ha (NAS, 2009a). It represents a weakly disturbed 

part of flat Jasie?da floodplain with ducts, oxbows and fen mires (Figure 3.3). It can be 



35 

divided into the following landscape parts: Jasie?da floodplain, drainage canal system, Lake 

Sporaúskaje, open fen mires themselves. 

More correct and logical zoning is division into two zones (NAS, 2009a):  

? Narrow and heavily waterlogged Jasie?da floodplain 25 km long, with the overgrown 

riverbed – sedges along the watercourse, further regularly flooded area of the floodplain, and 

typical fen mires 500-2000 m on each side of the river; 

? Area of Lake Sporauskaje – greatly expanded Jasie?da floodplain with open mires of 

various type and mineral islands (Figure 3.3). 

 

 

 

Figure 3.3 Location and boundaries of the Sporaúski reserve (Malashevich et al., 2008) 

 

Overall area of weakly disturbed and natural ecosystem is 95 % of the reserve. 

? 59.6 % of the area is covered with mires (open (40.8 %) and overgrown (18.8 %) ones); 

? 24.7 % - lands covered with forest (21 %) and bushes (3.7 %); 



36 

? 4.9 % - mineral islands between mires; 

? 8.9 % - underwater lands; 

? 1.9 % - recultivated peat extraction (NAS, 2009a). 

The open mire area has decreased by 21 % since 1955 and it is predicted that the area of open 

mires will decrease by 18 % by 2025 (NAS, 2009a). Full table on past and predicted 

transformation of landscape types is Table A2, Appendix. 

Land plots and water bodies of the reserve belong to the state and are used by 27 agricultural 

entreprises and forestry enterprises (with the main part of the area used by the enterprises of 

Biaroza and Drahi?yn districts (Figure A6, Appendix; NAS, 2009a).  

 

3.1.1.5 Natural Values of Sporava mire 

 

The main natural value of the site is represented by the fact that Sporava mire is one of the 

largest European habitats of the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola (Figure 3.4), a 

globally threatened bird species, hosting 5 % of its global population (Malashevich, 2013-

2014).  

 

Figure 3.4 Aquatic Warbler in Sporava mire (Tourist Kobrin, 2014) 

 

Moreover, the site is unique for Europe in respect to its area and natural state of the 

landscapes – unique complex of mesotrophic and eutrophic fen mires characterized by high 

peat deposit, important function of CO2 regulation. 

It is one of the largest lowland mires in Palie?sie region. It plays water regulatory role for the 

Jasie?da purifying the effluents from the drained area and preventing flooding of the nearby 

villages and agricultural lands by water storage (NAS, 2009a). 



37 

Flora is determined by the fen mire landscape: dominant species are sedges (Acute Sedge 

Carex acuta, Tufted Sedge Carex elata), along the Jasie?da watercourse there are reeds 

(Common Reed Phragmites australis) (NAS, 2009a);  

Birches are dominant tree species, willows (Salix sp.) are also encountered in most places, 

both being indicators of mire overgrowth; 

Rare species of orchids, e.g. Cypripedium calceolus, or a lady’s-slipper orchid (Figure A8, 

Appendix), are encountered here (NAS, 2009a). 

Fauna of the site is determined by the dominance of open fen mires: 

? 123 bird species, among them, besides Aquatic Warbler, rare species of Corncrake  Crex 

Crex, Great Snipe Gallinago media, Bittern Botaurus stellaris, Black Stork Ciconia nigra, 

Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, Short-Eared Owl Asio flammeus, Savi’s Warlber 

Locustella luscinoides, Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, Short-toed Snake-eagle Circaetus 

gallicus, Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus, Lesser Spotted  Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater 

Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa; 

? 20 mammal species, among them European Badger Meles Meles, Eurasian Elk Alces Alces, 

Euraisan Roe Deer Capreolus Capreolus, Wild Boar Sus scrofa, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, 

European Hare Lepus europaeus, Short-tailed Weasel Mustella erminea, Eurasian Polecat 

Mustella putorius, European Otter Lutra lutra, Eurasian Beaver Castor fiber, Raccoon dog 

Nyctereutes procyonoides. Muskrat Ondatra zibethica; 

? 34 fish species; 

? 6 reptile species, rare European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis, Sand Lizard Lacerta agilis 

and Grass Snake Natrix Natrix are common; 

? 6 amphibian species, Moor Frog Rana arvalis and Common Frog Rana temporaria are 

most common (NAS, 2009a). 

It is important to note that Sporava is a habitat for 48 species from the Red Data Book (NAS, 

2009a). 

 

*Cultural value of Sporava mire 

Sporava mire represents a traditional natural landscape with evidence of past life and 

activities of local people: earlier the typical feature of this region was “chutary” – the houses 

located far from each other on the mineral islands. Now the remains of these houses are traces 

of orchards and areas where houses were standing. 

  



38 

3.1.1.6 Current state: threats 

 

As it was mentioned above, Sporava mire has suffered from drainage and intensive 

agricultural use of the surrounding area having caused nutrient pollution. The mire itself was 

not drained and represents an untouched landscape with the consequences of the actions on 

nearby territories which are as follows, according to UN, 2002; NAS, 2009a: 

Overall change in hydrological regime of the river: 

? canalization of the upper course of the Jasie?da River from the source to the upper limits of 

the reserve (30% of the Jasie?da catchment area has been drained); 

? construction of the water reservoir and Sialiec fishfarm upstream of the reserve in 1977-

1986 led to almost total absence of spring floods due to filling of fishfarm reservoirs, high 

summer inundations due to water discharge from the fishfarm, as a consequence – flooding of 

bird nesting sites, disappearance of rare plant species; 

Table A3, Appendix shows a drastic increase of the Jasie?da runoff before and after drainage 

of the 1970-80s. 

Water pollution 

? industrial waste and domestic sewage from Biaroza;  

? agricultural affluents from cattle-breeding farms and drainage activities; 

? chemical pollution from the Sialiec fishfarm; 

? as a result – overgrowth of the riverbed and Lake Sporaúskaje; 

Vegetation change on dry elevated hills due to ploughing and overgrazing in the past; 

Overgrowth of open mires with bushes and trees (reeds, willows, birches) which results in 

unsuitability of these localities for Aquatic Warbler. Evidence of the indicated threats is on 

Figure 3.5. 



39 

 

 

Figure 3.5 Views of the mire (Malashevich, 2014b) 

 

Vegetation burning – it needs careful planning since it can have adverse effects: when it is 

carried out in dry springs and upper peat layer is burnt, together with insects and plant seeds, 

vegetation will only regenerate in 2-3 years. On the other hand, when the areas are burnt in 

the winter, when there is an ice layer, only upper grassy vegetation layer burns, thus, 

contributing to vegetation control in the mire. 

Illegal fishing and hunting (Kuklov and Dym, 2006). 

 



40 

3.1.1.7 Management: past and present 

 

Management of the reserve is under responsibility of Sporaúski republican biological reserve, 

state nature conservation enterprise created in 2005 (NAS, 2009a) as a unique result of 

efficient cooperation between district executive committees of Biaroza, Drahi?yn, Ivacevi?y, 

Ivanava, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection and APB-Birdlife 

Belarus non-governmental organization. 6 people now work in the administration of the 

reserve (Malashevich, 2013-2014). 

The activities carried out in the reserve are habitat management and nature conservation, 

hunting, fishing, ecotourism and environmental education. 

The first Management Plan was developed for 2002-2006 and efficiently implemented. The 

current Management Plan is for 2009-2013. 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

Scientific and public attention to Sporava mire was raised in 1995-1997 when Aquatic 

Warbler was discovered in the area by the Belarusian-German research team during their 

search for its nest places, with financial support of RSPB, Michael Otto Foundation 

(Germany) and UNDP Belarus (Kazulin and Flade, 1999). Breeding biology studies were 

carried out from 1998. Ringing of the Aquatic Warbler has been conducted along with this 

work. Since 1995 numerous studies on population development, habitat structure, breeding 

success, diet of the species have been conducted. It was concluded that Sporava mire was one 

of the 3 key breeding habitats for Aquatic Warbler in Belarus hosting 5% of its world 

population which at the same time was suffering a severe decline (by 90% within the last 30 

years) (Kazulin and Flade, 1999) due to mire destruction by drainage and abandonment. 

During further research links and interactions between drainage measures and other 

alterations of the water regime, agricultural use, trophic level of the mires and vegetation 

succession were much better understood.  

Since 1995 a number of projects have been implemented on on preparation of inventory on 

remaining sedge fen mires and AW populations in Belarus so that a fen monitoring system as 

well as a conservation strategy for the Prypia? floodplain could be developed. Further 

conservation projects have contributed to development and implementation of the reserve 

management plans: 



41 

? Management planning for conservation of fen mire biodiversity in Belarus (1999-

2002) was financed by Michael Otto Foundation for Environmental Protection (Germany) and 

UNDP Belarus and implemented by APB-BirdLife Belarus in cooperation with the Ministry 

of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection – development of Sporava 

Management Plan (UNDP, 2002); 

In the Management Plan all the threats were analysed and key necessary measures for the 

reserve set and prioritezed. 

The main points of the plan 2002-2006 were as follows: 

1. main objective is to establish and sustain the conditions for regeneration and support of the 

open mires, their vegetation and habitats of rare fauna species; 

2. regeneration of hydrological regime of the mire (water regulation system on old drainage 

channels, control of water pollution levels); 

3. development of actions for prevention of further open mire overgrowth (mechanized 

mowing);  

4. organization of infrastructure and all the necessities for ecotourism development; 

5. organization of monitoring system of water level and its quality, reserve ecosystems, 

density and breeding success of Aquatic Warbler; 

6. raising awareness of local population on the activities conducted in the reserve, involving 

local people in their planning and realization, information distribution through printing 

materials, media; 

The 2002-2006 Management Plan was implemented within the Implementation of urgent 

recommendations of the management plans for key biodiversity areas in Belarus project 

(UN, 2006b). It is decscribed in the Habitat management section below. 

? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie 

through increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011) – 

implementation of the 2006-2009 Management Plan for Sporava reserve: construction of 

ecotourism facilities, rehabilitation of populations of rare and endangered species, 

organization of hay-mowing and bush cutting, reconstruction of ameliorative systems 

(Malashevich et al., 2008-2009; UNDP, 2006a; 2010a-2011a). 

 

Conservation activities within the developed management plans have been implemented in 

the field of complex study of mire ecosystems. This is a wide term uniting the following 

aspects: 

? Habitat management (hydrological and vegetation management); 



42 

? Monitoring of AW numbers and distribution, breeding success and causes of nest 

mortality; 

? Study of feeding and nutritive base evaluations; 

? Study of migrations. 

Each of these aspects will be analysed below by characterization of the projects carried out. 

Habitat management 

? Hydrological management 

Implementation of urgent recommendations of the management plans for key 

biodiversity areas in Belarus (2002-2006) (UNDP, 2006b). 

According to Malashevich et al. (2008-2009); UN (2002); UNDP (2006b), the following aims 

were set and measures taken: 

Aim 1. Optimisation of hydrological regime of the fen mire – construction of 1 sluice at 

Sporava mire, water operation regulations developed for Sialiec fishfarm; 

Water operation regulations on water intake and discharge levels were approved in 2009. The 

main regimes of water use were established as follows: 

? closure of reservoir sluices and accumulation of incoming water from the Jasie?da in the 

reservoir only during high floods and high precipitation years to prevent floodplain flooding; 

? limited letting of water from the reservoir into the floodplain in the years of low floods in 

April-May; 

? in dry years and absence of spring floods there will be lack of water for the fishfarm and 

the reserve, so, plan construction of water regulation site on the river aimed at water level 

control and letting water into the river and the reserve through filtration of reservoir water; 

Aim 2. Development of hydrological and species monitoring system to evaluate the 

effectiveness of taken measures – monitoring and ringing of the AW, the decline of the 

species was observed to have stopped even an increase in population as registered; 

Aim 3. The establishment of management units for reserves – setting up Sporaúski reserve 

management office. 

? Vegetation management: mowing 

20-30 years ago the mire was mown regularly by local people which has nearly stopped 

today. Mowing is highly important since it allows clearing the areas for new vegetation which 

serves as a habitat for a lot of species. However, it is impossible to restore the hand mowing 

tradition now, so, mechanized mowing has been implemented as an alternative within the 

following projects. 



43 

? Conserving unique biological diversity of lowland mires through their sustainable 

use (2006-2009) implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus – vegetation management at 

Sporava – mowing and bush removal with tractors (Figure A10c; GEF-SGP, 2006b); 

The results showed that mowing is technically possible and can be economically justified. 

According to Malashevich et al. (2008-2009), altogether 397 hectares of Sporava mire were 

mown and 30 hectares were cleared from bushes in 2006-2009. Monitoring works 

implemented showed positive effect of habitat management, leading to up to 3 times increase 

in the density of vocalizing males of the Aquatic Warbler. 

? Restoring Peatlands and Applying Concepts for Sustainable Management in 

Belarus – Climate Change Mitigation with Economic and Biodiversity Benefits (2008-

2012) – conducted by APB-BirdLife Belarus, RSPB, the Michael Succow Foundation in 

cooperation with the Government of Belarus and UNDP Belarus (Restoring peatlands, 

2010b). 

As Malashevich (2011) states, innovative and highly efficient caterpillar mowing device 

(ratrac) was specially adopted for working under mire conditions (Figure A9a, Appendix). 

The staff was hired and trained from the local population. Mowing has been conducted 

regularly since 2011, during suitable weather conditions, except for a nesting season. Since 

2011 ca. 400 ha were mown (Malashevich, 2013-2014). 

As Malashevichv (2013) states, due to mowing the habitat suitability improved, since a thick 

layer of dry vegetation was removed and the area was partially cleaned from bushes (Figure 

A9b, Appendix). Partial removal of bushes was caused by a technical problem with the 

mowing device. There was no increase in AW numbers registered in 2012 for all 3 mown 

localities. This goes in line with the recent study on habitat productivity performed in Biebrza 

National Park, Poland. Following the study, AW population increase was registered starting 

only with the second year after mowing. 

Rare plant species rehabilitation 

According to UNDP (2011b; 2006a), his measure was carried out within the project on 

Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie 

through increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011).  

Lady Bell flower, or Adenophora lilfolia rehabilitation was performed by the staff of the 

Central Botanic Garden of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Belarus.  The 

seedlings were grown with the use of cellular engineering techniques and by genotype are 

identical to the plants of the species inhabiting the territory of Belarus. For Belarus this is an 

innovative experience on reintroduction of rare plant species with the objective to establish a 



44 

new sustainable population in natural habitats. Schoolers from the nearby Zdzitava village 

participated in planting of the around 1000 sprouts. 

At present Adenophora lilifolia can be found in the Belarusian Palie?sie mainly in semi-open 

areas with sparse broad-leaved forest or in bushes with sparse growth of oak in floodplains of 

large rivers. The total number of Adenophora lilifolia is not more than 300 plants.  

? Monitoring of AW numbers and distribution 

Aquatic Warbler monitoring in Belarus project (2002 – up to now) – habitat management, 

monitoring of Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution, Aquatic Warbler counts in Sporava, 

Zvaniec and Dzikoje sites, study of migrations (Ministry, 2006; Malashevich, 2012). 

Research of Aquatic Warbler breeding habitats in Belarus started in 1995. Since then 

monitoring of breeding mechanisms, distribution and optimal water level for breeding was 

conducted. The project will be described in detail in Chapter 3.1.4 of the dissertation. 

? Sporava Caretakers’ Network 

The project “Creation of caretakers’ network on the key Belarusian wetlands” was initiated by 

APB-Birdlife Belarus with the help of its members and financial support of foreign partners 

(APB, 2010a). The network of the caretakers is a voluntary community of local people 

responsible for monitoring of Important Bird Areas, their state and reporting to the nature 

conservation entities (APB, regional branches of the Ministry of Natural Resources and 

Environmental Protection) about threats, change in numbers of key bird species, their 

habitats, environmental education of local population (APB, 2014).  

Sporava’s caretakers have produced a lot of efficient results: participation in Aquatic Warbler 

counts, reporting about the threats for the mire. 

 

Development aspect (education, tourism) 

 

Tourism and environmental education are seen as priorities for future reserve development. 

The following facilities and events already exist (Tourisitc Brest, 2014a; Biaroza, 2014): 

? visitor centre next to the mire itself with accommodation facilities (9 places) including 

facilities for the disabled, maps of the reserve routes, printed materials for visitors (maps, 

booklets) (Figure A11, Appendix); 

? accommodation facilities at the nearby agricultural farmsteads; 

? equipped pedestrian trail with 2 observation points next to the visitor centre, a campsite 

next to the Jasie?da River, ferry crossing (Figure A12, Appendix); 



45 

? 4 more ecological trails (water, pedestrian, bike and mixed ones) developed and planned to 

be equipped (Figures A7, A13, Appendix);  

? organization of various excursions; 

? rental of boats, bikes, tourist equipment (tents, sleeping bags).  

These actions were brought to life within the following projects: 

? Creation of conditions for the development of eco-tourism at the Republican 

Biological Reserve “Sporaúski” (Biaroza district) with the minimal environmental 

impact (2008-2009) – construction of ecological trails for tourists and schoolchildren, 

organization of environmental activities for raising public awareness, organization of open 

championship on hay mowing (GEF-SGP, 2008a); 

? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie 

through increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices (2006-2011) – 

construction of ecotourism facilities, documentary shooting (UNDP, 2010a-2011a). 

However, the timetable of the centre requires prebooking of the visit and does not guarantee 

the centre will be opened when the visitors come which decreases attractiveness of Sporaúski. 

Furthermore, there is a lack of direction posts for visitors. Moreover, there is not a web-site of 

the reserve although there is much information on the Internet (in particular, on the web-sites 

of Brest region executive committee, Biaroza local executive committee, Brest region 

touristm web-site, free of charge deal.by) since the reserve is known because of the AW 

conservation and promoted in the mass media reports. Belarusian and foreign scientists, 

birdwatchers, students visit Sporava for their research, participation in the volunteer camps on 

AW counts. There are school excursions and various educational activities for local schools 

organized in the reserve. Still, the information on Sporava for foreign tourists is almost absent 

on the Internet. Those foreigners who come to the reserve are either from nature conservation 

field or birdwatchers who got information from their friends in this field. However, the author 

encountered 3 links to the British sites on organization of bird tours where Sporava mire was 

included as a visit site (Naturalist and Limosa, 2014). The number of visitors (both national 

and foreign) of Sporava mire is growing judging by the 2011-2013 results shown in Table 3.1: 

Table 3.1 Number of visitors of Sporaúski reserve (2011-2013) (Malashevich, 2013-2014) 

Number of 

visitors/excursions 

2011 2012 2013 

Belarusian 1104 1798 2138 

Foreign 121 196 189 

Total 1225 1994 2327 



46 

It is important to note that a visit to the reserve can be combined with cultural tourism 

activities: destinations nearby – museums of traditional arts in the villages fortress remains, 

remains of the monastery. 

Unfortunately, among all the services offered, the reserve can also organize foreign hunting 

tours which is seen as an unacceptable service type for the reserve. Moreover, the 

consequences of these hunting tours often show that these activities are done without any 

environmental analysis. 

 

Raising awareness about the unique fen mire habitats through environmental education 

and tourism 

? to raise public awareness about the necessity for conservation of Sporava mire and 

prevention of open mire overgrowth, in 2007 there was organized a national hand mowing 

championship called “Sporaúskija sienakosy” (Sporaúskija haymakings) which is now held 

annually attracting lots of participants and visitors (Figure A14, Appendix). The winner 

participates in the European hand mowing championship in Poland (Biebrzha National Park) 

(Brovach, 2013); 

? there is an annual festival in the Sporava village called Sporaúskiaja žarty, meaning 

Sporava jokes, a festival of traditional local humour (Figure A15, Appendix; Viachorka, 

2013). 

Local people are enthusiastic and represent a good basis for sustainable development of their 

villages and the reserve. 

 

3.1.1.8 What needs to be done and what is planned 

 

Sporaúski reserve has shown a good progress in the recent years both in conservation and 

development field. The initiatives planned for the future are as follows: 

? already launched Clima East  project “Conservation and sustainable management of 

peatlands in Belarus to minimize carbon emissions and help ecosystems to adapt to 

climate change” (2014-2020) – aimed at restoration of Sporava fen mire by mechanized 

mowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette production (BELTA, 2013: 

ClimaEast, 2014;) 

? pedestrian trail next to the visitor centre is being equipped for the disabled, the number of 

visitors is planned to be increased by this measure; 



47 

? 4 ecological trails to be equipped for visitors, direction posts to be set, map of the routes 

will be provided for visitors; 

? there is a plan to be further developed an existing cycling route around 3 lakes so that the 

bikes could be rented and returned at any specially equipped point of the route; 

? the accommodation part of the visitor centre is being reconstructed for 5 rooms/8 visitors; 

? photoelectrical station is to be constructed in 2014 so that the reserve could provide itself 

with energy and get revenues from its sale for nature conservation activities (implemented 

within the project of SGP/GEF and local environmental fund) (Viachorka,2014); 

? creation of a training centre on bioresources and alternative energy within the above 

mentioned project (Viachorka, 2014); 

? continuation of mechanized mowing. 

What is good, cooperation between the reserve administration, local executive committees, 

APB-Birdlife Belarus, UNDP Belarus, foreign partners has been established thoroughly and is 

to be continued with success. 

 

3.1.1.9 Water quality and peat analysis 

 

Data and detailed reults of the water quality and peat analysis are in Chapter 3.1.1 of 

Appendix. 

Elevated values of the nutrients in the Jasie?da River near Sporava mire, high levels of sewage 

discharge into the river. Peat ph values are in the normal range for fen mires (5.6). Peat is 

weakly decomposed (von Post decomposition index is h4). 

 

3.1.1.10 Wetland condition analysis 

 

The table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.1.1 of Appendix. The overall result obtained 

for Sporava mire is 19.33 out of 25 which is a rather high value and evidence of close-to-

natural state of the mire with the consequences of drainage of the surrounding areas.

3.1.2 Je?nia bog 

 

3.1.2.1 Location 

 

One of the largest peat bogs in a state close-to-natural in Belarus and Europe, with multiple 

lakes (around 100). 

Je?nia is situated in Northwest Belarus, in Viciebsk region, the districts of Mijory and 

Šarkaúš?yna (Figure 3.6). The nearest point is the city of Mijory. The bog belongs to the 

basin of the Western D?vina River, Baltic Sea basin (Kozulin et al., 2012). 

 

  

Figure 3.6 Location of Je?nia bog (Google Earth; Malashevich, 2014a) 

 



49 

3.1.2.2 History and present main features 

 

As Kozulin et al., 2012 states, Je?nia peatbog was formed in the lowest part of Polack lowland 

(a result of postglacier lake existence here) with the basis of clay, rainwater gathering in the 

narrow hollows and forming shallow lakes which then caused start of moss layer formation 

and deposit of moss peat. Wetland formation process began to cover larger and larger areas of 

dry lands of coniferous forest. Frequent forest fires contributed to the process. Moreover, poor 

mineral nutrition determined mainly rainwater feeding of the area, thus, the bog formation. 

The process has taken 8200-9000 years (Kozulin et al., 2012), thus, it started a long time ago. 

The Western D?vina River provides substantial part of the bog drainage through the system of 

its affluents. Lakes of the bog are connected with the basin by the drainage canals system and 

the small rivers. 

The water level regime of raised bogs depends on: the precipitation regime, evaporation of 

water, water runoff from the bog, mire type, composition, and relief. Raised bog landscapes 

are characterized by: the spring maximum level coinciding with the maximum snowmelt; the 

summer minimum level resulting from increased evaporation from the bog surface; the fall 

increase of the level as a result of higher precipitation and lower evaporation; and the winter 

gradual decline of the level over the period between fall and spring owing to water runoff 

from the mire and lack of water inflow due to precipitation. 

Most of the bog is overgrown with low pines, but there are also significant open spaces with 

multiple small lakes and open water bodies.  The core of the bog is a peat deposit covering 90 

% of the reserve (Table A4, Appendix). Peat layer depth is 3.8 m on average, maximum of 8.3 

m (Kozulin et al., 2012). 

There are multiple mineral islands in the area of the bog covered with fir-trees and small-

leaved forest. The Je?nia bog has traditionally been used by local people to gather cranberries 

Oxycoccus palustris (Figure A18, Appendix). 

In 1957–1959, before the establishment of the reserve, a network of drainage canals and 

ditches was constructed in the eastern part of the bog (Kozulin et al., 2012). It was 

constructed to facilitate peat extraction. Despite the fact that no peat extraction was 

subsequently carried out here, the drainage network was causing a significant negative 

influence on the site. By now the canals and ditches have overgrown with vegetation, but they 

continue to impact the mire in a negative way. 

The drainage implied straightening of the Je?nia rivers and construction of the channels which 

caused serious disturbance of the hydrological regime of the raised bog: canal system started 



50 

in the centre of the bog and went further through the lakes to the peripheral zones where the 

water was further processed into the drainage system. As a result, water table fell up to 1m 

below the ground, dry peats started to mineralize and produce CO2 emissions. Hydrological 

characteristics of peat have changed: water did not accumulate in peat, it just flowed away. 

Moreover, the site became prone to fires, occurring regularly, with the most destructive ones 

in 1998 and 2002, with almost 70 % of the bog suffered (Figure A17, Appendix).  

The consequences are clearly visible: vegetation transformation – Pine Pinus sylvestris 

disappearance in exchange for spread of European White Birch Betula pubescens, Silver birch 

Betula pendula and Aspen Populus tremula, Common heather Calluna vulgaris domination 

among shrubs, cranberries endangered (Figure A16, Appendix). What is more, decrease of the 

groundwater level has been observed but, thanks to the dam construction projects since 2002, 

it has regenerated to a great extent. The groundwater level typical of the bog and set as the 

aim to be reached is next to the surface level with small seasonal differences (Thiele, 2013). 

According to Tanavickaja, 2012b, the most disturbed areas are the ones in the centre and in 

the south of the bog, in the areas of drainage canals and lakes. Natural peat bogs cover mostly 

northern part of the bog and do not need any conservation measures (Figure A20, Appendix). 

The reserve was established here in 1968 with the status of the republican hydrological 

reserve and transformed into the landscape one in 2007 (Kozulin et al., 2012).  

 

3.1.2.3 Protection regimes 

 

Je?nia bog has the following national and international protection statuses: 

? National – Republican landscape reserve, established in 1968 as a hydrological reserve, 

transformed in 2007 (Kozulin et al., 2012);  

The logo of the reserve (Figure 3.7) has the Arctic Loon on it, only 2 pairs of this rare bird are 

encountered in the bog. 

 

Figure 3.7 Logo of the reserve (Je?nia reserve, 2014) 

? International – Ramsar site established in 2002, Important Bird Area established in 1998, 

Important botanical site established in 2005 (Kozulin et al., 2012). 



51 

3.1.2.4 Area size and zoning 

 

According to Kozulin et al. (2012), Je?nia reserve has an area of 25301 ha (Figure 3.8).  

 

Figure 3.8 Map of the bog (Viciebskbiker, 2014) 

 

The bogs cover 66 % of the reserve area, 24 % - forested lands, 6 % - low forests and shrubs. 

It is important to note that 50% of the reserve is covered with bogs which suffered from fires 

(Kozulin et al., 2012). See Table A5, Appendix on transformation of landscape types of the 

bog. 

The land plots and water bodies of the reserve belong to the state: the user of land plots and 

water bodies is Dzisna forestry entreprise (Mijory, Dzisna, Hiermanavi?y forestry sections), 

the tenants are Šarkaúš?yna and Mijory district divisions of the Belarusian Society of Hunters 

and Fishermen, Absterna Ltd (Figures A19, Appendix; Kozulin et al., 2012). 

 

3.1.2.5 Natural Values of Je?nia peatbog 

 

First of all, Je?nia is one of the largest near-natural raised bogs in Europe (views of the 

bog are on Figure A25, Appendix).  



52 

Second, the bog is an important stop-over site for semi-aquatic bird species, such as Cranes 

(around 4000) and Geese (9000-12000 annually) (Figure A21-A22, Appendix), globally 

threatened species of Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus breeds here (40-50 pairs 

in Europe), only 2 pairs of Arctic Loon Gavia arctica (Figure A23, Appendix) (Kozulin et al., 

2012).  

The bog is an IBA due to 150-200 pairs of Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix, 60 pairs of Common 

Crane Grus grus, and 50 pairs of Short-Eared Owl Asio flammeus (Kozulin et al., 2012). 

What is more, Je?nia is known for its unique paludal plant communities of a south taiga type 

(upland oak communities, ash, linden formations, old aspen and alder formations, open bogs, 

cranberries and cowberries communities) and rare and endangered flora species (Dwarf Birch 

Betula nana, Small-fruited Cranberry Oxicoccus microcarpus, Blushing Bog-moss Sphagnum 

molle, Cloudberry Rubus chamaemorus, Swamp Willow Salix myrtilloides etc.) (Kozulin et 

al., 2012). 

Flora is dominated by 11 species of Sphagnum and Common Sundew Drosera rotundifolia 

(Figure A24, Appendix), and now well spread “thanks” to the drainage species of Birch 

Betula sp, Willow Salix sp, Sheathed Cottonsedge Eriophorum vaginatum, Common Heather 

Calluna vulgaris (Kozulin et al., 2012).  

Common Cranberry Oxycoccus palustris has seriously suffered as a result of forest fires but 

now is regenerating. 

Fauna: 

? 31 mammal species, Wild Boar Sus scrofa, Eurasian Elk Alces alces, European Red Fox 

Vulpes vulpes, European Otter Lutra lutra, European Beaver Castor fiber, European Badger 

Meles meles, European Hare Lepus europaeus, Short-tailed Weasel Mustella erminea, 

Raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, Snow Hare Lepus timidus; 

? 150 bird species, nesting site for Arctic Loon Gavia arctica, Willow Grouse Lagopus 

lagopus (Figure A26, Appendix), European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Jack Snipe 

Lymnocryptes minimus, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus, Common Greenshank Tringa 

nebularia, Black Stork Ciconia nigra, White-Tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla, Short-toed 

Snake-eagle Circaetus gallicus, Black Kite Milvus Migrans, Osprey Pandion haliaetus, 

Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina; 

? 5 reptile species, large population of Common European Viper Vipera berus (Figure A27, 

Appendix); 

? 7 amphibian species (Kozulin et al., 2012). 

 



53 

3.1.2.6 Current state: threats 

 

There can be indicated the following disturbing factors which currently act as threats to the 

bog; 

? unregulated harvesting of wild berries and mushrooms as a disturbance factor; 

? intensive hunting and fishing: hunting for waterfowl species is prohibited during spring 

nesting and breeding season, but during the rest of the year the birds are disturbed; 

Recently there has been made a series of photos compiled in one Facebook post on fishing 

attractiveness in the reserve. It could be more efficient to promote the site from the point of 

view of unique biodiversity; 

? unsustainable forest management – cutting of indigenous communities of pines, fir-trees, 

their replacement by birches and willows; 

? use of cross-country vehicles which destroy vegetation and upper layer delicate peat soils; 

? local pollution with household waste from the nearby villages. 

Views of the bog are shown on Figure 3.9. 

 



54

3.1.2.7 Management: past and present 

 

Management of the reserve is a responisiblity of the Je?nia nature conservation state enterprise 

created in 2006 with a team of 3 people, Šarkaúš?yna and Mijory district executive 

committees who work in cooperation with various nature conservation entities (Kozulin et al., 

2012; Malashevich, 2013-2014). 

The first Management Plan was developed in 2008 for a 5-year period by the National 

Academy of Sciences of Belarus (Kozulin, 2008). The current Management Plan is for 2012-

2016 (Kozulin et al., 2012). 

Main priorities of the plan are as follows (Kozulin et al., 2012): 

? restoration of hydrological regime of the bog; 

? organization of forest management aimed at biodiversity conservation; 

? preparation of recommendations on optimizing amateur fishing in the reserve to minimize 

the impact of the disturbance factor on nesting birds; 

? organization of ecological tourism and environmental education: developing tours of the 

reserve and surrounding areas taking into account biodiversity inventory data; developing and 

building special causeways for mechanical vehicles (cross-country vehicles) for tourist and 

other (scientific, fire fighting, and monitoring) purposes; creating the infrastructure for 

ecotourism development; 

? organize an awareness-raising campaign to inform the population about the nature 

conservation value of the reserve, its conservation and use regimes; 



55 

? preparation of proposals on organizing sustainable use of the major bog resource, i.e. 

cranberries, and its processing in the district; 

? putting in place a system of monitoring water levels and quality on the territory of the 

reserve, its flora and plant communities, biotopes, bird population, and entomofauna to assess 

the status of bog ecosystems and efficiency of the Management Plan implementation. 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

Scientific research on the Je?nia bog has been conducted for the last 20 years by various 

institutions. Since 1999 there have been a number of conservation projects on dam 

construction implemented in the reserve.  

? Restoration of hydrological regime of the Je?nia peatbog (1992-2002, 2008-2012) 

(GEF-SGP, 2008c) - construction of 48 dams (Levy, 2010) on the drainage canals which 

allowed to raise groundwater level, stimulate conditions for restoration of native flora/fauna, 

prevent the bog from fires, and even stop decrease of Black Grouse populations. The project 

was implemented with the help of foreign and Belarusian volunteers, local community 

members during “Let’s save Je?nia together” volunteer camps organized for this objective, 

and by Mijory construction service. Simple design and local materials (burnt tree trunks, peat) 

have been used for construction which made the process easy and low-cost (Figures A28-

A30, Appendix; Shajkin and Levy, 2010). First, in 1999-2002, 17 dams were constructed in 

the peripheral part of the bog which still could not decrease the water level in the centre of the 

bog. In 2007-2009 the dams were built in the central part to block the canals there (Levy, 

2010). 

What is more, several sensors for measurement of groundwater level, water quality 

characteristics (mineralization, temperature, acidity, dissolved oxygen) have been located in 

the bog and provide a lot of useful information for monitoring its regime (Tanavickaja, 

2012a). 

The constructed dams have been checked for their efficiency in spring 2012 (Tanavickaja, 

2012a). The process of bog restoration is very slow and needs time. There are already positive 

results of the dam construction judging by the survey of all the dams functioning conducted in 

May 2012: 

? canals have started covering with Sphagnum moss; 

? water has started accumulating and its level has raised 30-50 cm up; 

? 40 dams carry out their function to greater or lesser extent; 



56 

? 8 dams have been damaged or formed new watercourses (Tanavickaja, 2012a). 

As a result of a more than 10-year experience of dam construction on the Je?nia bog and the 

latest analysis of dams there were made the following conclusions on the construction 

techniques that could be used in the future (Tanavickaja, 2012a): 

? dams should be constructed so that their level could be 30 cm higher than maximum 

level of spring floods; 

? managed wrapping should be planned so that washout of additional watercourse is 

prevented; 

? planning of soil dams built with excavators so that runoff is completely blocked; 

? monitoring of the restoration processes is needed, the main expected effects are 

Sphagnum moss growth along the canals, peat adaptation to natural conditions again 

and restoration of its CO2 accumulation function. 

? Support to the development of a comprehensive framework for international 

environmental cooperation in the Republic of Belarus (2011-2014): 

? the management plan of 2008 was reviewed and updated in 2012, mainly in the 

section concerning the hydrological regime restoration; 

? habitat analysis was conducted and new habitats of rare species found;  

? in May 2012 the reserve was supplied with cross-country vehicles, water monitoring 

set for inspecting of the bog and monitoring of its hydrological regime, fauna and flora 

(Figure A31, Appendix; UNDP, 2013). 

? Je?nia Caretakers’ network 

Je?nia Caretakers’ network was planned to be for monitoring the changes brought about by the 

dam construction, evaluating state of the dams, watching the activities carried out in the 

reserve with the aim of reporting in case of illegal hunting, fishing, or other negative human 

actions. Seminars and workshops were developed for the caretakers so that they could be 

well-informed about the current environmental legislation, strategies and plans for nature 

conservation field in Belarus. 

According to UNDP, 2014, the caretakers of the Je?nia mire participate in the restoration of 

hydrological regime of the mire, monitor the state of dams and if necessary perform their 

routine repairs. Not less than a half of volunteers, engaged in construction of dams, are local 

citizens. In addition to that, 6 caretakers from Mijory and Šarka?š?yna districts have become 

public inspectors, which has institutionalized their connection with territorial bodies 

(Inspections) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. 



57 

The initiatives supported by the caretakers on the Je?nia bog are annual counts of Common 

Crane, dam construction (APB, 2014), installation of information boards in the reserve 

(Figure A32, Appendix; APB, 2010a), assigning public inspectors for nature conservation 

from the caretakers’ network (APB, 2010b), cooperation with the reserve administration in 

reporting about threats and illegal actions. 

? Counts of Black Grouse and Willow Grouse in 2012 (Lundyshev, 2012) 

Counts (166-469 Black Grouse and 85 Willow Grouse) and analysis of these 2 species 

distribution in the Je?nia bog have shown that they both face a number of problems caused 

both by the change in the hydrological regime of the bog and by unregulated human activities 

(fishing): the species of Raccoon dog and Red Fox have decreased their population, 

disturbance of the birds in the period of cranberries harvest and fishing activities with dogs, 

winters without snow and Willow Grouse deaths due to this factor. 

 

Development aspect 

 

From the point of view of ecotourism potential Je?nia bog has a limited access for tourists 

(bad roads, few villages and cities nearby, forests difficult to access, areas suffered from fires) 

and a low level of maximum acceptable concentration of visitors since bog landscape 

conservation requires regulation of disturbance level. Thus, ecotourism activities in the 

reserve can not be aimed at mass tourism. Fortunately, ecotourism itself is a concept which 

requires limited number of tourist visits. The reserve has gone through successful 

improvements in ecotourism development, thanks to the EU/UNDP project and the festival 

“Cranes and cranberries of Mijory land” (UNDP, 2013) organized in 2012. All these factors 

increased the visitors interest in the reserve. Accommodation services in the Mijory city and 

agricultural farmsteads have seen a rise in their profits. 

The number of visitors of the reserve in 2008-2014 is shown in Table 3.2. 

Table 3.2 Number of visitors of the Je?nia reserve in 2008-2013 (Borok, 2012-2014)

Foreign 22 14 15 2 10 62 17 

Total 100 74 68 67 86 351 219 



58 

The numbers show the ongoing rise of the reserve popularity among both Belarusian and 

foreign tourists. Two big tourist groups from Germany and Finland visited the reserve in 

2013.  

According to Dobrovolskij and Markevich, 2013, within the project on Support to the 

development of a comprehensive framework for international environmental 

cooperation in the Republic of Belarus (2011-2013) there have been completed the 

following tasks in the area of ecotourism development: 

? ecological visit-centre in the reserve opened in September 2013, its specific feature is its 

distant location from the bog itself which requires proper planning of its functions for visitors: 

interactive information boards are set in the centre, in Belarusian, English and Russian 

(Figures A34-A35, Appendix); 

? tourist equipment has been provided: tents, sleeping bags, boats, bikes, skis, snowshoes, 

binoculars, compasses, it all can be rented at a very low price; 

? ecological trail Azieraúki started to be constructed and equipped for tourists: 1.5 km, a 

pedestrian trail with a wooden flooring, 2 hours’ walk, mostly through the bog (Figure A36, 

Appendix);  

So far, 500 m of the trail has been constructed (Natural Pearls, 2013a); 

? information boards provided, observation point and observation platforms constructed 

(Figures A37-A38, Appendix); 

? promotional videos have been shot in English, Belarusian and Russian (Chapter 3.1.2, 

Appendix); 

? there has been efficient promotion of the reserve on its Facebook page: descriptive photos 

are placed there regularly (Je?nia, 2014); 

? as Matvejeva, 2013 states, starting from September 2012, there has been annualy organized 

an ecological festival called “Cranes and cranberries of Mijory land” which concentrates on 

culinary part of various dishes based on cranberries, traditionally collected in the area (drinks, 

pastry, sausages). Observations of migrating Cranes are also carried out during the festival. 

The festival became a good promotional event for the reserve (Figure A39, Appendix); 

? ecological festivals, seminars held regularly and devoted to various events, e.g. World 

Wetlands Day 2014 festival fo school pupils, Felting souvenirs seminar (Natural Pearls, 

2013b; Je?nia reserve, 2014); 



59 

? starting from 2013 one agricultural farmstead near the reserve offers photo shooting of the 

Common Crane Grus Grus from specially equipped hiding places (Figure A40, Appendix; 

Kozlovskij, 2013); 

? there was developed a business-plan of the new company on collecting and processing of 

wild berries and mushrooms (mainly cranberries, blueberries, and mushrooms), the company 

called Mijorskija jahady (Mijory berries) was registered in October 2012: aimed at sustainable 

use of local resources by involving local people and getting economic profit from abundant 

local resources. 

Among the tourist facilities of the reserve the following ones can be noted: 

? in May 2013 there was tested a new service of “Through the bog on snowshoes”: 

snowshoes are an equipment for the bog visit, there is a possibility of excursions prebooking 

and participation in planned visits (Figure A41, Appendix; Natural Pearls, 2013c); 

? guide services, prebooked, cost 1 euro per person per hour for Belarusian tourists, and 2.5 

euros for foreigners. Excursions can be pedestrian (along the trail), on the snowshoes, skis 

(Natural Pearls, 2014); 

? 5 enthomological routes developed in the reserve (Natural Pearls, 2014); 

? there are recommendations of RSPB specialists on organization of school excursions and 

visitor groups division (Chapter 3.1.2, Appendix; Cooper, 2012); 

? accommodation is not provided by the reserve but there are good options of 

accommodation in the city of Mijory (2 hotels), Dzisna (1 hotel), however, they are located 

far from the destination, catering is not provided on a regular basis, the restaurants and cafes 

may be closed at the time of arrival;  

? there is a web-page of the reserve on the web-site of Viciebsk region reserves, both in 

Russian and in English, but the English version is incomplete; 

? there is a possibility for foreign tourists to find the reserve on the Internet (English version 

of the news, Facebook page). 

Environmental education is also a priority for the Je?nia reserve: organization of key events 

for adults and schoolers – International Migratory Bird Day, the above mentioned festival 

Cranes and Cranberries of Mijory land, World Wetlands Day (Natural Pearls, 2013b); 

Thus, there are many positive trends about the reserve activities, whereas, there are negative 

aspects – possibility of all the activities being at stake after the end of the funding project, 

insufficient promotion of the site among national ad international tourists, lack of 

infrastructure.

3.1.2.8 What needs to be done and what is planned 

 

What needs to be done 

 

The following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and 

ecotourism/education performance of the Je?nia reserve: 

? promotion of the reserve both for Belarusian and foreign tourists. Although information 

about the site is spread through the word of mouth in the birdwatching and nature 

conservation community, the reserve can be promoted among the general ecotourism travelers 

on the Internet; 

? promotion through the commercial in English and a short movie since now they are not 

easily to find on the Internet; 

? plan of ecotourism development and plan of work with visitors needs to be developed; 

? a series of information boards have been developed, each devoted to a certain aspect: 

Cranberry – bog berry, Dragonflies of the bog, Birds of the bog, Do you know trees, 

Sphagnum and its characteristics. Judging by the design already planned, they seem to be very 

modern from the point of view of environmental education. There are also planned interactive 

games with both children and adults: Why we need bogs, Willow grouse and goshawk 

(Lundyshev, 2012); 

? there is a possibility and potential in combining Je?nia ecotourism resources and routes 

with other protected areas (Braslavy Lakes, Bielaviežskaja Puš?a) so that complex tours could 

be possible. What is more, ecological tourism can be combined with cultural heritage of the 

area. 

 

What is planned 

 

The future plans are listed below in Table 3.3, according to the current Management Plan 

2012-2016 and other sources (Kozulin et al., 2012; Je?nia reserve, 2014).

3.1.2.9 Water quality and peat analysis 

 

Tha data and detailed results of thewater quality and peat analysis are located in Chapter 

3.1.2, Appendix. 

Hydrochemical parameters are in the normal range typical of Belarusian bogs (low 

mineralization, low conductivity, strongly acidic). Water ph values are their highest limit. 

Groundwater levels have increased to normal levels on the edges of the bog and are gradually 

increasing in the centre. 

Peat ph values are in the normal range for bogs (2.99). Von Post Decomposition Index is H1 

(undecomposed peat) for the undisturbed parts of the bog, H4-H5 for the disturtbed ones 

which is still a normal result. 

 

3.1.2.10 Wetland condition analysis 

 

The Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for the Je?nia bog 

is 19.67 out of 25 which is a rather high value showing the high percentage of natural bog 

areas and efficient work on restoration of the hydrological regime.

3.1.3 Zvaniec mire 

 

3.1.3.1 Location 

 

Zvaniec mire is the largest European mesotrophic fen mire, diversified by small mineral 

islands scattered over the area and covered by forests and shrubs. Located in southwestern 

Belarus, Brest region, Drahi?yn and Kobryn districts, 17 km south-east of Drahi?yn, to the 

south of the Dniapro-Buh canal, Black Sea basin (Figure 3.10). The site borders the Dniapro-

Buh Canal (DBC) in the North, Bielaaziorsk Canal in the East, bypass canals of the 

Arechaúski and Krasny Partyzan agricultural entreprises’ drainage systems in the South, 

Arechaúski Canal in the West (NAS, 2009b).

3.1.3.2 History and present main features 

 

As NAS, 2009b states, Zvaniec mire, lake-alluvial plain, part of Palie?sie lowland, started to 

form 4.5 thousand years ago as a result of melting of the Dniepr glacier and erosion processes 

caused by icy water flows. The resulting depression was getting filled with water. Further 

warming up of the climate made sedimentation with silty and sandy matter a regular process. 

Glacier retreat caused water outflow, the former lake was gradually getting filled with rich 

matter brought by rivers from the plain, its size was shrinking and it continued its existence 

only as a waterlogged plain. Thanks to closeness and abundance of groundwater layer, 

waterlogging and peat accumulation started in the deepest depressions, the area covering with 

hypnum moss, reeds and sedge peat. Peat layer at present is 0.5-1 m. 

Thus there existed so called Halaúš?yckaje mire, a vast waterlogged complex. Zvaniec was 

the eastern part of that complex. During 1960-80 drainage campaigns most fens were drained 

for agricultural purposes, forestry and peat extraction. Only six large fens were left in natural 

state in Europe. Zvaniec is the largest of them.  

According to NAS, 2009b, Zvaniec mire is located in the interfluve of the Dniapro-Buh Canal 

(DBC), constructed in 1775-1783 and its tributaries, Bielaaziorsk and Arechaúski Canals, 

constructed in the beginning of the 20
th

 century for navigation purposes. In the 18
th

 century 

the DBC was used only during spring floods, only later in 1837-1867 the regulation dams 

were constructed. All the canals seriously changed the regime of the mire. 

The main recharge source of the mire is ground water. Atmospheric recharge is significant 

only in autumn and spring. 

The surface flow is directed both to the east and to the west. The northern part of the mire is 

partly drained by DBC. The hydrological regime of the area is also influenced by 

amelioration polder systems (7) and drainage canals, and fishfarm Navasiolki. Central and 

southern parts are least disturbed (NAS, 2009b). 

Almost annually the summer and fall no-flood period is interrupted by rainfall floods. The 

height and duration of summer floods are significantly lower than the same parameters of the 

spring floods. However, in some years (1984, 1993) the summer rain flood water levels 

surpassed those of the spring melt floods (NAS, 2009b). 

In especially dry years the groundwater table can drop up to 0.5 m below surface (NAS, 

2009b). As it was noted above the hydrological regime of the mire is influenced by 

amelioration polder systems, drainage canals and ditches. Their exploitation defines the 

groundwater table on the mire. Incorrect operation of the polders and drainage canals often 



64 

results in unexpected inundations, draughts, and catastrophic fires on the site causing 

significant damages to the biological diversity. 

Open sedge fen parts of the mire are natural habitats for many species under minimal 

anthropogenic pressure. They can serve as reference mires in planning for management of 

fens, as well as for rehabilitation of wetlands. 

 

3.1.3.3 Protection regimes 

 

Zvaniec mire has the following national and international protection statuses: 

? National – Republican Landscape Reserve established in 1996 (NAS, 2009b); 

Logo of the reserve shows the Aquatic Warbler  as a key species for the site (Figure 3.11). 

 

Figure 3.11 Logo of the reserve (Malashevich, 2014a) 

? International – Ramsar site established in 2002, Important Botanical Site (1998), 

Important Bird Area (2005) (NAS, 2009b). 

 

3.2.3.4 Area size and zoning 

 

Accordin to NAS, 2009b, the total area of Zvaniec reserve is 16 227 ha. Open fens dominate 

the area covering 77.4 % of the reserve. The area of forests and shrubs, which are mainly 

found on the mineral islands, is 18.1 %. Agricultural lands – 2.1 % - parts of the islands used 

for ploughing (159 ha), mowing (47 ha), and pastures (147 ha). 0.2 % of the reserve is 

covered with water (see Table A6, Appendix). It is important to note that open fen areas has 

decreased by 11% since 1955 (Malashevich et al., 2008). 

Depending on the landscape features, geographic location, level and type of anthropogenic 

load the area can be divided into several parts: the western part, the central and the southern 

part together, the northern and the eastern parts (Figure 3.12). 

 



65 

 

Figure 3.12 Map of the Zvaniec mire (Malashevich et al., 2008) 

 

The western part is characterized by abundance of mineral islands with sedge fen mires 

overgrown with shrubs. The islands are characterized by high degree of transformation due to 

past arable farming activities.  

The central and southern parts of the mire are dominated by open fen mires with shrubs 

covering about 10-30% (NAS, 2009b). Mineral islands are scattered all over the mire 

complex, but their area is small (0.2 to 1 ha) (NAS, 2009b). Mineral islands in this part of the 

mire are the least transformed as they were used by people only as hay-making fields. These 

small mineral islands are used by a number of rare bird species for nesting. 

Mineral islands dominate in the eastern part of the site. Natural forest vegetation here forms 

narrow strips along the slopes of the islands. Most of the island area was used for arable 

farming by local population, mainly to grow potatoes. Fen mires located between the islands 

are severely overgrown with shrubs. Here the largest Zvaniec island is located, alsmot fully 

covered with forests. 

The northern part of the site is greatly impacted by the presence of the DBC. The share of 

open fens here is the lowest. Willow shrub proportion is the highest here, the area being 



66 

strongly waterlogged.  Most of the islands in this part were previously used for ploughing and 

hay-making. 

Open water surfaces are represented by one lake and a network of canals and ditches. The site 

is owned by the state. As it can be seen on Figure A42, Appendix, most part of the site’s lands 

is not used (83%). The land is leased to Radastoúski agricultural entreprise and Drahi?yn 

forestry (12% of the site) (NAS, 2009b).  

 

3.2.3.5 Natural Values of Zvaniec mire 

 

Zvaniec mire is characterized by the following features that confirm its uniqueness and 

biodiversity richness: 

? a particularly good representative example of sedge-hypnum fen mires typical of the 

Palie?sie biogeographic district; 

? hosts 2 globally threatened species of birds – at least 2 pairs of Greater Spotted Eagle 

Aquila clanga, and the largest population of the Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola 

(3000-5500 singing males, 30 % of the European population) (NAS, 2009b; Malashevich, 

2013); 

? the site is a "hotspot" for conservation of biological diversity of Eastern Europe 

biogeographic region. It supports particular elements of biological diversity (species, habitat 

types) of fen mires. The Zvaniec mire contains a significant proportion of species adapted to 

special environmental condition (mesotrophic open fen mire) (NAS, 2009b): 

29 plant species were discovered to be rare and disappearing within the region  of Palie?sie; 

10 vegetation communities formerly widespread across Palie?sie fen mires, now rare for 

Belarus and Europe, are found here. 

Bird species composition of Zvanec is not very rich but includes some typical fen mire 

species (125): Greater Bittern Botaurus stellaris, Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus, Lesser 

Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga, Common Kestrel 

Falco tinnunculus, Hobby Falco subbuteo, Little Crake Porzana parva, Crane Grus grus, 

Curlew Numenius arquata, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, Savi's Warbler Locustella 

luscinioides, Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, Penduline Tit Remiz pendulinus, 

Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor; 

? 29 mammal species, including 2 Red Data Book Species – European Badger Meles Meles, 

Eurasian Lynx Felis linx; 



67 

? 9 amphibian species, dominating Moor Frog Rana arvalis; 

? 5 reptile species, rare species of the European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis (NAS, 2009b). 

*Social and cultural value of the Zvaniec mire 

Despite their negative influence on the mire, the Dniapro-Buh Canal (DBC) and the 

Belaaziorsk Canal represent certain historic value. 

According to NAS, 2009b, the DBC was constructed in 1775-1783, the Bielaaziorsk Canal in 

1905-1910. Ancient embanking facilities from oak, and parts of old sluices have remained on 

some parts of the canals. These are examples of hydrotechnical facilities dated late 19 – early 

20th century. 

What is more, some of the existing economic activities are also a part of the traditional 

culture. Up to the late 1950s there were many so-called one-house villages on mineral islands 

in the western and southern part of the now protected area. At present there are practically no 

such villages on the site, but arable farming on mineral islands for domestic purposes is 

sometimes practiced by the inheritors of the former land-owners. Horticulture is another 

traditional type of economic activities. Bee-houses were mounted on large ancient oaks, the 

latter representing significant historic, esthetic, and scientific value. 

What is more, historic and ethnographic sites are also found close to the site. Jamnik village, 

especially its southern part has retained almost all historic features typical for the Palie?sie 

region: reed-roofs, traditional hedges, shadoofs, nests of white storks on old trees and house 

roofs (NAS, 2009b). 

 

3.1.3.6 Current state: threats 

 

There can be indicated the following disturbing factors which currently act as threats to the 

mire: 

? Exploitation of the adjacent amelioration systems. The amelioration systems are all 

drainage polder-type systems, i.e. they are separated from the external catchment by 

embankments. Excess water is pumped out of the polders by pump stations and is supplied to 

the ditches which form the southern boundary of the Zvaniec mire. When in operation, the 

pump stations of these systems lead to the excessive waterlogging of the mire and high 

amount of nutrients from agricultural fields (UN, 2002); 

Amelioration systems: some of them in need of repairs, some do not function, the other ones 

still influence the water regime of Zvaniec causing either inundations in the south (during 



68 

summer floods and water inflow from the canals) or droughts (too rapid water outflow after 

spring floods); 

? As a consequence of the first factor, speeding up of the vegetation succession - mire 

tracts with a lowered groundwater table have higher cover of reeds which results in changes 

in the species composition of plants and animals. The tracts with a lowered groundwater table 

(especially close to the boundaries of the mire) are characterized by spread of shrubs and 

forests. 

Evidence of the above indicated threats and general views of the mire can be seen on Figure 

3.13. 

 

 



69 

 

 

Figure 3.13 Views of the mire (Malashevich, 2014b) 

? Disruption of hydrological regime of the mire – elevation or decline of the 

groundwater level. The main reason for that – lack of coordination of the rules and 

procedures for exploitation of the Dniepr-Buh canal with the need for conservation of the 

Zvaniec mire. Fortunately, now all the canals of water outflow into the Dniepr-Buh canal are 

closed, thus, do not influence the area any more; 

? Abandonment of traditional land use. Recent decades have seen a rapid decline in the 

amount of haymaking on the mire. Some 20 years ago, about 70% of the mire was mown by 

the local population. Today less than 10% of the mire is cut: most hay-making is now 

performed on more accessible fields which emerged as a result of drainage. Hence, many mire 

tracts get overgrown with shrubs and reeds (NAS, 2009b); 

? Forest logging. The islands were formerly occupied by nemoral oak forests, which created 
a positive environment for a number of rare plants and served as breeding sites for many birds 



70 

of prey. Nowadays, the islands have retained only scattered fragments of those forests. Forest 

logging continues to negatively impact the mire because most of the mire’s forests are under 

jurisdiction of agricultural enterprises, which use forests without limitations, that would be 

impossible if the forests, for example, were under the jurisdiction of forestries; 

? Biological pollution. This is present on all mineral islands of the mire and in many of the 

forests in the north of the site. This is in most cases related to the dissemination of weeds and 

forest-steppe species imported from numerous agricultural fields and pastures located of the 

mineral islands representing a threat to local flora; 

? Use of poisonous seeds. The use of poisonous seeds on fields adjoining the site has 

frequently resulted in mass killing of black grouses, partridges and cranes, the latter species 

being a nationally protected one; 

? Climate change. Changes in the amount of winter precipitation in the last years have 

resulted in years with either no spring floods or – the opposite – with a very high spring 

floods. Summer rainfall floods have also become more frequent. Absence of flood or 

prolonged inundation of the floodplain during the vegetation season results in serious changes 

in the “operational mechanics” of the mire ecosystem, exemplified by temporary 

replacements of vegetation associations, changes in species composition, distribution and 

density of birds, flooding of nests and as a result mass killing of nestlings; 

? Operation of the Navasiolki fish-farm. The Navasiolki fish-farm is located in the 

northern part of the mire. It is supplied from the DBC, but the recharge is also partly carried 

out with water pumped out of the mire (UN, 2002). 

 

3.1.3.7 Management: past and present 

 

Management of the reserve is carried out by the state nature conservation entreprise  Zvaniec 

Republican Biological Reserve with a team of 5 people, and Drahi?yn and Kobryn district 

executive committes (NAS, 2009b) in cooperation with APB-Birdlife Belarus. 

Lands of Drahi?yn forestry are use as follows: arable farming is conducted on 94 ha, 36 ha are 

used for hay-making, 149 ha for cattle pasturing (NAS, 2009b).  

Mineral islands are partially used by the local population for ploughing and subsequent 

growing of arable crops, mainly potatoes. The western part of the mire is used most 

intensively. This part has not yet been included in the protected area. The eastern part of the 

mire adjoining the Bielaaziorsk Canal is also used quite intensively. 



71 

The area of the mire is also used as a large reservoir to store water pumped out of the 

ameliorated (poldered) areas in rainy periods and supply water for drained tracts during dry 

periods. Large canals are used by local population for non-commercial fishing. 

Horticulture has always been popular among local population and the traditions of this 

household craft are still alive here. However, the actively used areas cover only 12% of the 

reserve (NAS, 2009b). 

In 2001 a management plan for the Zvaniec reserve was elaborated in the framework of an 

international project on Management Planning for Key Fen Mire Biodiversity in Belarus. It 

was further implemented (NAS, 2009b). The present Management Plan is for 2009-2013. Its 

main priorities were set as follows (NAS, 2009b): 

? hydrological regime management and vegetation management – mowing, vegetation use 

for briquette production, managed vegetation burning; 

? review and update of borders and regimes of use of the reserve with the area extension to 

16227 ha and increase in the number of land users; 

? ecotourism organization and sustainable development – repairs and opening of an 

information centre, ecological trail and observation point construction, website development, 

business plan on promotion of Zvaniec within the domestic and inbound tourism market; 

? establishment of a hunting unit in order to manage the hunting activities and reduce the 

number of poaching cases; 

? environmental education, cooperation with local people. 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

Kozulin and Flade (1999) state that scientific surveys of the site started in the 1950s. In 1995–

1997 a study of the distribution and ecology of the Aquatic Warbler in Belarus was carried 

out, assisted by the Michel Otto Foundation (Germany) and the Royal Society for the 

Protection of Birds (UK). The study discovered that the Zvaniec mire supported the world’s 

largest populations of this bird. Thus, the research outcome clearly indicated a need for a 

Management Plan for this area. 

According to Ramsar (2002) in 1997, a permanent monitoring plot was established in the 

southern part of Zvaniec, enabling annual studies of the dynamics of the mire flora and fauna. 

In 2001–2002 a number of projects on study and description of Zvaniec as a potential Ramsar 

site were implemented, e.g. Number and Distribution of Snipe and Great Snipe; Social 



72 

and Cultural Value of the Site; Study of Possibilities for Recreation and Tourism at the 

Site. 

? Management planning for conservation of fen mire biodiversity in Belarus (1999-

2002) - development of Management Plan for Zvaniec fen mire (UNDP, 2002b); 

? Implementation of urgent recommendations of the management plans for key 

biodiversity areas in Belarus (2002-2006) – setting of management administration of the 

reserve, hydrological regime stabilized (7 sluices constructed), monitoring of Aquatic Warbler 

population, ringing of Aquatic Warbler (UNDP, 2006b); 

As a result of the 2003-2008 plan realization, the following conservation measures were taken 

(NAS, 2009b): 

? borders of the reserve changed and newly established; 

? all the canals of water outflow into the Dniapro-Buh canal are closed, thus, do not 

influence the area any more; 

? water regulation systems (sluices, dams) were constructed in 2004 in order to limit 

water outflow through the canals and amelioration systems or its inflow during 

summer floods. These systems proved their efficiency having caused increase in water 

level in the reserve and prevention from summer floods in the central part of the mire; 

? regulation dam was constructed in the area of Navasiolki fishfarm to decrease its 

influence on the reserve; 

? monitoring of groundwater levels has been conducted regularly. 

? Conserving unique biological diversity of lowland mires through their sustainable use 

(2006-2009) implemented by APB-Birdlife Belarus – vegetation management at the key 

Aquatic Warbler breeding site – mowing and bush removal with tractors (GEF-SGP, 2006b); 

? Catalyzing sustainability of the wetland protected area system in Belarusian Palie?sie 

through increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices 2006-2011– 

implementation of the Management Plan of the Zvaniec reserve, establishement of a cross-

border Ramsar site “Upper Prypia?” which includes Zvaniec and Prastyr (Belarus) and Upper 

Prypia? and Prypia?-Stochid (Ukraine), engineering project on optimisation of hydrological 

regime (UNDP, 2006a; 2010a; 2011a); 

? Aquatic Warbler monitoring in Belarus project (2002 – up to now) – annual Aquatic 

Warbler counts, monitoring of AW numbers and distribution, ringing (Malashevich, 2012), 

the project is described in Chapter 3.1.4; 



73 

? Zvaniec Caretakers’ Network. According to UNDP, 2014, at the Zvaniec mire the 

caretakers monitor hydrological regime: take measurements of the ground water level and 

monitor the overflow situation. One of the caretakers took active participation in the 

development of the project application for rewetting of drained peatland withdrawn from 

agriculture in the vicinity of the mire. By the caretakers’ efforts the census of cranes is 

organized and performed at the Zvaniec mire annually. 

 

Development aspect 

 

Zvaniec reserve possesses the following ecotourism and environmental education facilities: 

? the information centre was opened in 2010 in the village of Haravica, Drahi?yn district, 7 

places for accommodation of visitors, rental of bikes, tents etc (Figure A45, Appendix; 

Touristic Brest, 2014b). However, visit to the centre and the reserve requires prebooking, 

otherwise, the visitors would face a closed office although it is officially open during all the 

week except for the weekend. There are no routes developed for tourists, although the funding 

was provided for that; 

? there is no web-site of the reserve, there is some information, not much of a tourist type, on 

the web-sites of Brest tourism, Drahi?yn district; 

? the tourist routes along Bielaaziorsk and DB canals were developed for pedestrians and 

bike tours but not equipped so far (Figure A43, Appendix); 

? ecological education activities have been organized with the local pupils, school 

excursions; 

? excursions for foreign groups are organized (1-2 per year); 

? meetings with locals are held sporadically. 

Table 3.4 demostrates low numbers of visitors in 2011-2013 which is an evidence of lack of 

promotion and infrastructure for visits.

3.1.3.8 What needs to be done and what is planned 

What needs to be done  



74 

The following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and 

ecotourism/education performance of the reserve: 

? hydrological and vegetation management: further implementation of the regulation 

measures; 

? promotion of the reserve through mass media, Internet, social networks, events, provision 

of information for foreign visitors on the Internet; 

? installation of infoboards, direction signs, equipment of the tourist trails; 

? organization of environmental education activities; 

? collaboration with Sporava reserve on organizing joint excursions. 

 

What is planned 

 

Among the plans of the reserve is the already launched Clima East project on Conservation 

and sustainable management of peatlands in Belarus to minimize carbon emissions and 

help ecosystems to adapt to climate change (2014-2020) – aimed at restoration of Zvaniec 

fen mire by mechanized mowing and collecting and use of biomass for fuel briquette 

production: purchase of 2 tractors and other equipment for mowing of 40% of the mire area. 

Processing of biomass for briquette production (Sadovksaja, 2013). 

 

3.1.3.9 Peat analysis 

 

Data and results of peat analysis are located in Chapter 3.1.3, Appendix. The ph values 

obtained are in the normal range for fen mires (5.73) and show that the peat in Zvaniec mire is 

weakly acidic which does not serve as any evidence of drainage consequences and 

disturbance of hydrological regime of the mire. This means that the ecosystem has had the 

resources to protect itself and prevent severe degradation. 

Von Post Decomposition Index is H4 (weakly decomposed peat) which is a normal value. 

 

3.1.3.10 Wetland condition analysis 
 

The Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for Zvaniec mire 

is 19.58 out of 25 which is a rather high value meaning that although the mire has suffered 

from drainage the big part of has remained weakly disturbed and the conservation activities 

carried out are highly efficient. 



75 

3.1.4 Aquaric Warbler conservation project 

 

3.1.4.1 Overview of Aquatic Warbler conservation concept 

 

The Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola is the rarest and the only globally threatened 

passerine bird found in mainland Europe. According to AWCT (2014); Birdlife (2014b), the 

species is classified as Vulnerable at the global level and is listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN 

Red List of Threatened Species. At the European level it is classified as Endangered. It is also 

included into Annex I of the EU Wild Birds Directive, in Appendix II of the Bern Convention 

and in Appendix I of the Bonn Convention. 

Once widespread and numerous in fen mires and wet meadows throughout Europe, the 

Aquatic Warbler has disappeared from most of its former range. As AWCT (2014) states, 

nowadays, its world population is confined to fewer than 40 regular sites in only six European 

countries, with four sites supporting over 80 % of the global population (Poland, Belarus, 

Ukraine, Lithuania). 

 

History of decline 

 

According to Birdlife (2014a), since 1970, the Aquatic Warbler species has declined 

significantly as a result of the destruction of 80-90% of its habitat in the river systems of the 

upper Prypia?, Jasie?da (Belarus) and Biebrza/Narew (Poland). These systems hold 

approximately 75% of the European population. It formerly bred in France, Belgium, 

Netherlands, former West Germany, former Czechoslovakia, former Yugoslavia, Austria and 

Italy. As Flade (2013) states, whereas the Central European population seems still to be more 

or less stable (probably increasing in East Poland, declining in Belarus, unknown in Ukraine), 

the peripheral populations are threatened by extinction or have already disappeared. Whilst 

the current status of the West Siberian population is unknown (latest breeding season records 

from the year 2000), the Hungarian population has completely vanished (700 males in 2001, 

no breeding occurrence after 2011). The Baltic population is steeply declining (from 290–330 

in 2004 to less than 100 males in 2013). The Pomeranian population is threatened by 

extinction: decline from c. 200 males in 1999 to c.100 males in 2006 to less than 20 in 2013. 

 

 

 



76 

Population, breeding sites, migration routes 

 

According to Flade (2013), the global population size of the Aquatic Warbler (AW) is 

estimated at between 9 500 and 13 700 singing males during the period 2009–2013 and 

confined to fewer than 40 sites in 5 countries.  

Aquatic Warbler distribution of male population among the countries is the following: Poland 

2,670-3,850; Belarus 2900-5500 (Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013); Ukraine 4,000-4,900 

(Poluda, 2013); Lithuania cerca 100 (Flade, 2013), Germany, fewer than 25 (Birdlife, 

2014a). 

Thus, the Aquatic Warbler regularly breeds in Belarus, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, with 

major populations in Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland (AWCT, 2014).  

It breeds in large open lowland marsh habitats with low grassy vegetation (mostly sedge fen 

mires) with water mostly less than 10 cm deep. It winters in similar habitats (the grassy 

saline marshes of the Senegal and Niger deltas) and, on migration, favours coastal habitats 

with low stands of sedge and reed near open water (Portugal, France) (Birdlife, 2014a). 

On migration, it has been recorded in 15 European countries, mainly in the west and 

southwest of the continent. It winters in the Sahelian belt of sub-Saharan West Africa, mainly 

along the lower Senegal River, where it was discovered in January 2007, within and to the 

north of Djoudj National Park, and in 2011 found in smaller wetlands in south-west 

Mauritania and at the inner Niger Delta in Mali. Two-thirds of the known population have 

been discovered since 1995 (Birdlife, 2014a). 

 

Threats 

 

According to Birdlife (2014a), the most important threats for the species are: 

? loss of breeding habitat owing to drainage for agriculture and peat extraction, damming of 

floodplains, unfavourable water management and the canalisation of rivers. Habitat 

degradation is widespread where traditional fen management has ceased allowing succession 

to unsuitable overgrown reedbed, shrub or woodland, decrease of the groundwater level; 

? uncontrolled fires in spring and summer pose a direct threat to birds and nests, since they 

can burn out the upper peat layer of fens;  

? in the wintering grounds, agricultural cultivation and irrigation (creation of rice and sugar 

cane plantations), drought, wetland drainage, intensive grazing, succession to scrub, 

desertification and salinisation of irrigated soils are all existing threats. 



77 

Conservation policy 

 

As Birdlife, 2014a states, Aquatic Warlber is legally protected in all countries of its breeding 

range. All key breeding sites in Belarus, Germany and Poland are located within protected 

areas. Habitat is actively managed in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and Germany. All 

breeding range states except for Russia have monitoring programmes.  

First, there exists the Birdlife International Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team which is 

responsible for research, development and implementation of conservation actions and 

cooperation between the countries of the breeding range. 

According to CMS, 2014, the Aquatic Warbler Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was 

concluded in Belarus, under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and 

became effective in 2003. The MOU applies to 22 countries where the Aquatic Warbler 

breeds, rests on migration or winters. It calls for cooperation among national authorities to 

promote the conservation of the species and requires the strict protection of the species and 

the maintenance and restoration of its habitat. 

Moreover, in 2010 there was adopted a new International Species Action Plan for the Aquatic 

Warbler, prepared by CMS’s partner BirdLife International on behalf of the European Union. 

The main objective of the Action Plan is to maintain the Aquatic Warbler throughout its range 

and, in the medium to long term, promote the expansion of the breeding population to other 

suitable areas. Priority conservation actions to be taken by the Signatories can be summarized 

as follows: legislative measures to ensure the species’ and habitat protection, conservation of 

all existing sites, increase of the area of suitable habitat at existing sites and restoration of 

additional sites, monitoring and research, and the establishment of a public awareness strategy 

(CMS, 2014). 

The following researches have been carried out in Europe and Africa recently: 

? the first wintering site discovered in 2007 in the Djoudj National Park in Northwest 

Senegal. Later on three more sites were discovered, they are located in southern Mauritania 

and in the Niger River delta in Mali (CMS, 2014): ringing of the species and data analysis; 

? habitat restoration has been conducted on the breeding grounds; 

? AW counts are held regularly in Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania.

3.1.4.2 Belarus 

 

Kozulin and Flade, 1999 state that studies on Aquatic Warbler distribution in Belarus started 

in the 1990s by the joint international team hade by the German wetland scientist Martin 

Flade who came up with the idea to study Belarusian fen mires after he found one of his 

Dad’s photos during World War II which was shot in Belarus and showed the mire landscape. 

The scientist decided there could be large numbers of Aquatic Warbler in Belarus if the mires 

were in a good condition. It needed studying since in Germany the birds were in decline due 

to habitat destruction. 

Since then, lots of studies have been carried out, several projects developed and brought to 

life by the conservation team of APB-Birdlife Belarus, German scientists with the financial 

support of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (UK), the Secretariat for the Bonn 

Convention (CMS) and the A.G. Leventis Foundation (Germany). 

 

Key breeding sites 

 

The main Belarusian AW breeding sites are all located within the protected areas and are 

Sporava fen mire, Dzikoje mire, and Zvaniec mire. 

All the other regularly occupied breeding sites are under the protection regime (Figure 3.14). 

 

Figure 3.14 Location of the AW breeding sites in Belarus, 2013 (Malashevich, 2013) 



79 

According to Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013, before the massive drainage of mires in the 

1960s, Aquatic Warbler was nearly continuously distributed in the central part of its breeding 

range, in the Paliessian lowland. There were cerca 99 big fen mires (each of 1 000 ha and 

more) covering a total area of more than 900 000 ha. The mires were either adjacent to each 

other, or were located in a distance of 20-40 km. For that period the number of Aquatic 

Warblers is estimated at about 450 000 singing males. 

 

Conservation policy 

 

According to Malashevich and Fenchuk (2008), the AW conservation policy includes the 

following aspects:  

? maintaining existing habitats; 

? restoring abandoned habitats; 

? regular monitoring of AW numbers and distribution – Aquatic Warbler counts, ringing of 

the birds, search for new sites. 

 

Monitoring of AW numbers and distribution: AW counts 

 

AW counts will be analysed on the basis of 2013 counts’ results at 3 key breeding sites, and 

results from the 2010-2013 results at some sites presented by Malashevich, 2013. 

In general, the counts have been held regularly since 1995. Usually the key breeding sites 

(Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje mires) were taken as the research sites. 

The AW counts are carried out according to the international AW monitoring scheme 

developed within the framework LIFE-Nature project (Poland and Germany). They are 

organized as volunteer camps for all the people interested.  

The counts start one hour before sunset and last for maximum 2 hours – the period of the 

highest singing activity of males. This period is enough to cover a monitoring route up to 2 

km. Counts are usually not conducted in rainy or windy weather. 

Counts are simultaneously conducted by 2-5 people on each monitoring route. Teams move in 

rows with GPS and map the birds in their lists. Each bird has to be registered by at least 2 

counters before it is mapped. This allows for receiving reliable data from volunteers with 

different level of knowledge and experience; moreover, volunteers are previously provided 

with basic information on GPS use and bird counting and mapping by the camp coordinator.  



80 

Depending on the site size and availability of volunteers the following methods are used for 

the counts: 

? counts on the sample plots; 

? full counts. 

Aquatic Warbler counts 2013 were carried out at 3 most important AW breeding sites: 

Zvaniec (end of May, beginning of July), Sporava (end of June) and Dzikoje mires. Double 

counts were carried out at 18 sample plots in Zvaniec (central part), plus survey and full 

counts at all suitable habitats in western and eastern parts (the most detailed counts ever 

carried out at this mire).  

Full counts were executed at c. 40% of the known localities in Sporava. Full counts at a major 

part of suitable habitat were performed in Dzikoje mire. Full counts were also carried out at 

some small sites. The detailed results are presented in Table A46, Appendix. 

 

Main conclusions of the AW counts 2010-2013 are as follows: 

According to Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013, at present there are only 3 key Aquatic Warbler 

breeding sites (Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje) left in Palie?sie region, holding c. 2 750 - 

5 200 singing males (years 2010-2013). The rest of the national population breeds at 5 

permanent sites with low numbers (Dzivin, Prostyr, Š?ara, Serva? and Svisla?) resulting in 

100 - 200 males and at 7 suboptimal sites holding 50-100 males in total.  

So, altogether 15 breeding sites were hosting 2 900-5 500 singing males in the years 2010-

2013. Most of Belarusian breeding sites located at considerable distance (50-260 km) from 

each other. Such remoteness creates barriers for exchanges of birds between the sites. 

At the key sites Zvaniec, Sporava and Dzikoje the species rapidly declines due to overgrowth 

of open fens with reeds and bushes. Comparison population estimates in late 1990-s and 

recent monitoring data from the years 2010-2013, Aquatic Warbler numbers decreased for 

Zvaniec from 3000-8000 until 2100-4400, for Sporava from 700-2100 until 500-600, for 

Dzikoje from c. 1500 until 150-200 (Kozulin and Malashevich, 2013). These figures reflect 

population decline due to habitat loss. However it should be emphasized that these numbers 

also reflect a more detailed level of survey implemented in recent years.  

As Malashevich, 2013 states, some sites (Dzikoje, Sierva?, A?many and Žadzien) are 

transforming from fens into bogs.  

Aquatic Warbler numbers might be stabilized and even increased if there was a network of 

key sites located not far from each other. It might be achieved through both securing optimal 

habitat conditions at existing sites (Zvaniec, Sporava, Dzikoje, Sierva?) and restoring new big 



81 

fen mires (Vyhanaš?anskaje, Hry?yna-Starobinskaje and Dakuda?skaje) (Malashevich, 2013). 

It will secure fast population increase at the key sites until their maximum ecological 

capacity, and considerable increase of both distance and numbers of fledglings disseminating 

to new areas within breeding range (including suboptimal sites) during their post nuptial 

dispersion. The network of key and suboptimal biotopes will allow exchanging individuals 

between the sites. This will stabilize population numbers even under conditions of negative 

processes at some sites. 

Aquatic Warbler counts is an interesting scientific event and volunteer camp, allowing to 

expand the number of people aware of the nature conservation problems at Belarusian mire 

sites, get those people involved and give them an extremely useful experience of bringing 

their own contribution to mires’ conservation, getting to know new interesting people and 

widening their knowledge of Belarusian nature. 

 

Habitat management 

 

Although the AW numbers are declining, the work that has been done in the recent 15 years 

in the field of AW and its habitat conservation is very efficient and goes far beyond the AW 

counts but also involves the conservation measures taken at the key breeding sites: 

? development of the sites’ inventories, ensurance of protection regimes; 

? regular mechanized mowing at Sporava mire since 2011 has proved its efficiency, allowing 

to decrease overgrowth with reeds, birches and willows at Sporava mire, provide habitat 

restoration for the inhabitants of the mire. 400 ha were mown overall (Malashevich, 2013-

2014);  

? hydrological model developed for Zvaniec mire (Malashevich, 2013-2014); 

? mowing scheme is developed for Zvaniec also and is to be implemented within the Clima 

East project (ClimaEast, 2014).

3.2.  Research sites: Portugal 

 

3.2.1 Paul de Arzila 

 

3.2.1.1 Location 

 

Paul de Arzila is a freshwater marsh located in the region of Centre (NUT II sub-division - 

EU geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes 

(Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Baixo Mondego (Lower Mondego, NUT III sub-division 

(Eurostat, 2014)), on the left bank of the Mondego river (on the River Cernache affluent), part 

of the Coimbra district, three municipality councils (Coimbra, Condeixa-a-Nova and 

Montemor-o-Velho) and three parishes (Arzila, Pereira and Anobra) (Leitão, 2013b). The 

paul is most closely located to the village of Arzila (Figure 3.15). 

  

Figure 3.15 Location of Paul de Arzila (Google Earth) 

 

3.2.1.2 History and present main features 

 

The paul was formed in the valley of the River Cernache, the left affluent of the River 

Mondego, having represented one of the freshwater marshes in the valley of the Low 

Mondego River which once was a giant wetland (Leitão, 2013b). Judging by the words of the 

people working in the area, in the old times, before humans started their intervention, the 

wetland was covered with True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris (Bunho in Portuguese) and Rushes 

Juncus sp which local people regularly cut for weaving and making mats and various 

handicraft objects (Leitão, 2013a). Besides, for many centuries agriculture was the main 

source of income for Arzila village and nearby locations; fishing and hunting were practiced 



83 

here. However, regularization and drainage were maintained at biological equilibrium, until in 

the 1950s agricultural practices were intensified by the fact that 2 ditches were opened in the 

valley – Vala dos Moinhos in the east, Vala da Costa in the west which were supposed to 

drain the water from the nearby hills, later the third ditch (Vala do Meio) was opened in 

between the two previous ones to drain the rest of the water and use the land for rice and corn 

cultivation (ICNF, 2003-2004). Localization of the ditches is shown on Figure A49, 

Appendix. 

These are considered to be the most destructive measures ever taken in the area which 

seriously changed the hydrological regime of the Paul. The so-called regularization of water 

regime functions as follows: waterflow path gets rectilinear, completely unnatural, 

groundwater levels diminish, the distance flown by water in the river diminishes as well, its 

flow speed rises, thus, the river channel deepens which causes and speeds up soil erosion. 

Furthermore, summer dissecation and diminution of fish flow in the paul are also the 

consequences. What is more, the paul is a terminal part of the hydrographic basin of the River 

Cernache and is close to the meeting point with the river (Leitão, 2013b), so, it gets most 

pollutants flow, influencing not only the surrounding area but the whole river basin. As a 

result, the area of the paul has become overgrown with Common Reed Phragmites australis 

and Willows Salix sp. 

Moreover, the growth of the surrounding urban areas rose interest of the villagers in Coimbra 

vacancies and abandonment of agriculture as a principal activity, decrease in agricultural 

areas. What is more, nearby polluting industries (malfunction of wastewater treatment plants, 

factory on transformation of animal products, agroindustries (ICNF, 2003-2004; Flumm, 

2006; Leitão, 2013a)) played its part in deterioration of the water quality in the paul.  

 

3.2.1.3 Protection regimes 

 

Paul de Arzila has the following national, European and international protection statuses: 

? National – Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural) designated in 1988 (Leitão, 2013b); 

The logo of the reserve shows Purple Heron as a key species (Figure 3.16). 

  



84 

 

Figure 3.16 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014d) 

? European – Special Protection Area (ZPE – Zona de Protecção Especial, 1988), Site of 

Community Importance (Sítio de Importância Comunitária, 1997), Rede Natura 2000, 

Biogenetic Reserve of the Council of Europe (1990) (Leitão, 2013b);  

? International – Biotope CORINE (1987), Important Bird Area (IBA), Ramsar site 

designated in 1996 (ICNF, 2003-2004; Wetlands International, 2014). 

Paul de Arzila is an important part of a network of 3 wetlands in the Mondego valley, 

including 2 other IBAs – Paul do Taipal and Paul de Madriz. 

 

3.2.1.4 Area size and zoning 

 

The nature reserve was established in 1988. According to Leitão, 2013b, the territory of the 

reserve has an area of 585 ha (the area of the paul itself is about 150 ha) which is distinctly 

divided into two parts: 

? the central part representing an alluvial plain with an extensive reedbed, areas of 

permanent submersion, and agricultural area, main vegetation is marshy one with Common 

Reed Phragmites australis, True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris, Common Cattail Typha latifolia, 

Rushes Juncus sp., and also tree species of Grey Willow Salix atrocinerea, Black Alder Alnus 

glutinosa, examples of Narrow-leafed Ash Fraxinus angustifolia, Elm Ulmus sp., Black 

Poplar Populus nigra (Figure A47-A48, Appendix);  

? the second part is an area bordered by the hills of the river valley and covered mainly with 

forest and agricultural territories next to urban areas, main vegetation are tree species of 

Maritime Pine Pinus pinaster, Blue Gum Eucalyptus globulus, Portuguese Oak Quercus 

faginea, English Oak Quercus robur. 

The official zoning of Paul de Arzila (ICNF, 2004) defines 3 protection zones – Total 

Protection Area, Partial Protection Area, and Complementary Protection Area. What is more, 

two more protection levels are established: Partial Protection Zone has Area of Specific 

Intervention for Conservation of Natural Values, and Complementary Protection Zone has 



85 

Area of Specific Intervention for Public Use. Finally, there is an area not subjected to 

protection which corresponds with Urban Area (Figure 3.17).  

 

Figure 3.17 Paul de Arzila zoning (ICNF, 2004) 

 

Total Protection Area – 114,12 ha (Leitão, 2013b) – includes alluvial and riparian 

formations, oak woods, reedbeds and bulrush beds, ditches, lakes and ponds. 

Partial Protection Area – 85,50 ha (Leitão, 2013b) – includes flatland agricultural lands of 

the type ‘rice fields’.  

Area of Specific Intervention for Conservation of Natural Values was defined within this zone 

as an area of high interest of conservation of its biodiversity. There was defined a problem 

within this zone which is about agricultural production systems of intensive type (rice and 

corn cultivation based on irrigation). These practices have to be in compliance with the 

objectives of the natural reserve. 

Complementary Protection Area – 384,16 ha (Leitão, 2013b) – includes forests and bushes, 

agricultural lands on the hills. The problems of this zone are said to arise from using 

traditional policultural systems in agriculture and existence of fast-growing tree species 

potentially threatening the other ones. 



86 

There is an Area of Specific Intervention for Public Use defined in this zone was created to 

permit the implementation of reconstruction of N341/347 road on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot 

(Leitão, 2013b). 

Urban Area – 23,10 ha (Leitão, 2013b) – a territory without any strong need of conservation 

natural values (as it was defined in the zoning document (ICNF, 2004)) which corresponds 

with the parts of villages next to the paul – Monte da Cima, Arzila, Lameira de Cima, 

Lameira de Baixo, Caneira, Casal de S.João, Casal das Amoreiras, Casal das Figueiras. 

By the landscape type and activities carried out there are distinguished 3 areas – areas with 

agricultural activities, forests and semi natural areas, wetlands (Leitão, 2013b). This can be 

seen on Figure A50-A51, Table A7-A9 in Appendix. 

Agricultural areas are divided into two parts – the part on the hills occupied with olive trees, 

vineyards, orchards, arable rainfed lands, and the part of the valley occupied with irrigated 

arable lands. 

Wetlands (ca. 150 ha, 21 % of the reserve area (Leitão, 2013b)) also are represented in 3 

forms– freshwater marshes (permanent or lakes), seasonally inundated agricultural lands 

and canals. 

Freshwater marshes (permanent or lakes) are occupied with Common Reed, True Bulrush, 

Grey Willow. This zone has the biggest area out of all the 3 ones. 

Seasonally inundated agricultural lands are represented by rice fields. 

The area of canals is very important for certain fish, amphibian species, European Otter Lutra 

lutra. 

 

3.2.1.5 Natural Values of Paul de Arzila 

 

Paul de Arzila possesses the following fauna species and carries out the following functions 

(Leitão, 2013b;): 

? 126 bird species, including vulnerable species of Purple Heron Ardea purpurea, Goshawk 

Accipiter gentilis, Savi’s Warbler Lacustella luscinioides, White Stork Cigonia Cigonia, 

Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus (2 pairs);  

? nesting site for Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, its number increased from 2 pairs in 

2003 to 6-13 pairs thanks to the LIFE project in 2005, Black-crowned Night Heron 

Nycticorax nycticorax, Cetti’s Warbler Cettia Cetti, Savi’s Warbler Lacustella luscinioides, 

Common Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, a stable population of 5-6 pairs of 

reintroduced Purple Gallinule Porhpyrio porphyrio; 



87 

? wintering ground for Common Teal Anas crecca, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Cattle 

Egret Bubulcus ibis, Little Egret Egretta Garzetta; 

? migratory stop-point for Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Eurasian Reed 

Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, 

Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, Bluethroat 

Luscinia svecica; 

? 21 mammal species, including Iberian Shrew Sorex granarius, Western Mediterranean 

Mouse Mus spretus, Otter Lutra Lutra, Wildcat Felix silvestris; 

? &gt;200 species of invertebrates; 

? 15 fish species, including an American one introduced to control mosquitoes (prevention 

of malaria) which is now common in the paul; Iberian endemics Iberian Barbel Barbus 

bocagei, Iberian Nase Chondrostoma polylepis, Lusitanian endemic species of Ruivaco 

Rutilus macrolepidotus; 

? 11 reptilian species; 

? 8 amphibian species, but 2 frog species in decline due to predation from non-native 

Louisiana Crayfish, or Red Crawfish, which appeared in the surrounding area in the 1960s 

(Figure A53a, Appendix). One of the frogs, Discoglossus galgamoi, is now thought to be 

extinct in the paul and only survives in ponds on higher ground, the other one, Rana perezi, is 

also in decline; endemics Iberian Triton Triturus boscai, Schreiber’s Green Lizard Lacerta 

schreiberi; 

What is interesting, during the visit to the area, the great number of these crayfishes was the 

first thing to be noticed, to be more precise, the remains of them on the ground. Later, dozens 

of alive ones were seen in the gutter, which was quite surprising.  

It was said that after the 2001 big floods the number of Crayfish drastically increased but in 

recent years a decrease was observed (it is believed, crayfishes have become otter’s prey), so 

the otter population has increased. In 2013, the floods reached the almost 2001 level, so, the 

Crayfish population has seriously increased again. 

However, it would not be true to say that during the visit the author has observed rich 

biodiversity and pointed a lot of animal species. It could be because of the season (end of 

October), or due to the conditions in the paul are not suitable for hosting the above mentioned 

species anymore. 

  



88 

3.2.1.6 Current state: threats 

 

As it has already been mentioned above, Paul de Arzila represents a lot of negative 

consequences of improper, inappropriately planned human use. The main problems which are 

obvious now are the following (ICNF, 2003-2004): 

? reedbed overgrowth causing almost full displacement of naturally growing bulrush, typical 

of the area (Figure 3.18);  

? willow overgrowth, also having taken the territory of True Bulrush (Figure 3.18); 

? Phragmites australis and Salix sp. cover about 75 % of the total wetland area; current 

estimates are Phragmites australis cover &gt;90 % of the wetland area, open water&amp;lt;5 %, wet 

reedbed&amp;lt;10 %; 

? Watermifoil Myriophyllum spp invasion which caused eutrophication, water stagnation, 

decrease of oxygen and retention of organic compost;  

? non-native species of Crayfish having caused nearly extinction of 2 species of frogs; 

? absence of priority species chosen for conservation management; 

? absence of promotion of the paul as an ecotourism destination, few activities of the 

environmental centre; 

? ageing population of the surrounding villages, major employment of Arzila and Pereira 

population in the tertiary sector (mainly in Coimbra and 2 hospitals in the area, railway 

services), Anobra inhabitants also employed in the secondary sector (nearby industries of 

Condeixa-a-Nova) – there is a tendency of increase in the area of forests and uncultivated 

lands and decrease in agricultural lands. 

 



89 

 

 

Figure 3.18 Views of Paul de Arzila (Malashevich, 2014b) 

 

Moreover, there are problems coming from the outside of the paul: 

? domestic pollution – there are only 3 wastewater treatment plants working in the area – 

ones of Arzila, Anobra and Vila Pouca villages, the other villages/towns neglecting the 

pollution of the River Cernache affluents; 

There are at least 5 ETAR with direct influence on the paul (Leitão, 2013c). 

? industrial pollution – 3 sources – ceramic production (already closed (Leitão, 2013c)), 

factory on transformation of animal products, the one on extraction and washing of 

aggregates, and two agroindustries (mills). Only the first two have the wastewater treatment 

plants in operation, although not functioning properly sometimes; 



90 

? diffuse pollution – intensification of agriculture in the form of use of fertilizers and other 

chemicals in corn and rice production – as a consequence we get degradation of living 

conditions for animals as well as contamination of alimentation for people. 

As for now: agricultural practices tend to disappear, only small properties are left, they do not 

use any chemicals, only natural fertilizers and herbicides to a small extent. So, degradation of 

animal habitats is more a past consequence. 

? two hunting zones next to the area of the Paul de Arzila and a training camp for hunting 

inside the reserve, still existing but it is said they are not used (Leitão, 2013c); 

? reconstruction of the road N341/347 on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot. Part of Taveiro-Arzila 

has been constructed, part Arzila-Granja de Ulmeiro is left (Leitão, 2013b); 

In the process of Management Plan development, there were diagnosed the existing negative 

factors for the reserve. Some of them have been listed above and are showed on Figure A52, 

Appendix. 

? there is a need to adjust the Municipal Management Plans (MMPs) to the concept of the 

Paul in its Management Plan since there are misleading paragraphs in MMPs of the three 

municipalities which may cause management contradictions in the future, e.g. the 

characterization of the wetland regime as restriction of public use of soils. 

It is important to understand the hierarchy of the Management Plan of Paul de Arzila and 

Municipal Plans that are also related to the area. In Portugal the Wetland Management Plan is 

called Special Management Plan on territorial management of national scope, whereas 

Municipal ones are regarded as Municipal Management Plans on territorial management of 

municipal scope. Thus, Special Management Plans are superior to Municipal ones (ICNF, 

2004). 

? the need to adjust the Paul Management Plan to the Regional Plan of the Centro Litoral 

since the latter appears superior to the former (ICNF, 2004). 

 

3.2.1.7 Management: past and present 

 

The major part of the paul is in private property of various owners, 65 ha is a state property 

which was bought from the private owners in 2003-2005 (Leitão, 2013b; EU, 2007). 

The objective to develop the first Management Plan was established in 2001. The information 

was collected and prepared in the form of diagnostic and synthesis reports in 2003 (ICNF, 

2003-2004), they have been used by the author for this work since these materials are 



91 

available on the site of ICNF. The first Paul Management Plan was approved in 2004. At the 

moment there is no new Management plan of the wetland, there is a draft version but not 

finally approved. It has been taking already a long time to do that (Leitão, 2013a). No 

information could be given to me from the draft version or on the question of priority 

objectives set in the new plan. Only the questions on the changes of any points of the previous 

plan in the last 20 years were answered. There planned to be organized a meeting of the 

Parties involved – local community representatives, local municipality, ministry of 

environmental affairs, centre itself etc  to decide on function division in the management of 

the area (Leitão, 2013a). 

Past management of the Paul de Arzila is characterized by setting the management objectives 

for the Paul zones and 3 LIFE projects which will be described below. 

The objectives set for the Total Protection Area were the following (ICNF; 2004): 

? the zone being the untouched area for preservation of natural processes and habitats, 

unique flora and fauna features, but implying intervention into habitats in the form of control 

of reedbed expansion, promotion of bulrush growth and expansion, opening of the lakes (open 

pools that were created by the LIFE 2001-2006 project), ecological recuperation of the 

ditches, monitoring of alluvial plains, control of natural succession and selection and 

elimination of alien to oak species; 

What is really done: the area has been untouched except for the LIFE projects in 2001-2006 

described below. 

The objectives for the Partial Protection Area were set as follows: 

? area for conservation of natural values of rice cultivation fields and agricultural lands; 

? the rice field biotope was given the status of Area of Specific Intervention for Conservation 

of Natural Values since it has rich fauna and simultaneously suffers from intensive 

agricultural system; 

? area plan had to be elaborated in order to establish the maximum possible levels of 

fertilizers’ use, control the groundwater level in the process of cultivation, control of 

overflow, drainage systems, introduction of a culture to be grown on the fields in the 

midperiod of Autumn-Winter; 

? agricultural lands were said to be in need of reconsidering agricultural practices by 

respecting the Code of Good Agricultural Practices;. 

What is really done: traditional agriculture continues but without fertilizers’ use and 

substantially decreased in its area. 



92 

The Complementary Protection Area has been designed to preserve forest biotope together 

with agricultural lands on the hills next to the paul and serve as a buffer zone for Total 

Protection Area. The Area of Specific Intervention for Public Use was created to permit the 

implementation of reconstruction of N341/347 road on the Alfarelos/Taveiro plot. 

? the biotope of forests – measures for prevention of overgrowth of fast-growing exotic tree 

species and their planting, as well as encouraging local forest owners to plant native tree 

species in the area; 

? the biotope of agricultural lands – promoting respect for the Code of Good Agricultural 

Practices and development and application of the Zone Plan to the environmentally aggressive 

practices. 

What is really done: the area was created as a buffer zone for conservation of Total 

Protection Area, forest management measures are implemented here. 

Overall, Portuguese officially protected areas and their environmental centers are said to have 

the objectives of working with local communities, prevention of illegal hunting etc. In reality 

they do very few things out of those objectives due to various reasons – lack of funding 

sources and difficulty to get it, bureucaracy and neglection of nature conservation issues by 

the authorities. Current management can be described from 2 sides – conservation and 

development aspects. 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

The following conservation measures and projects have been brought to life in Paul de Arzila: 

? the administration of the nature reserve managed to acquire 20 ha of the privately owned 

land in the 1990s; 

? LIFE Re-establishment of the Baixo Mondego marshes (1st phase) (1993-1995) (EU, 

1993). The objectives and results are in Table 3.5. 

 

Table 3.5 Objectives and results of the project (EU, 1993) 

Objectives Results 

key areas would be safeguarded from degradation 

by land purchase and subsequent management 

acquisition of 12 ha of land to help safeguard the 

freshwater marshes from degradation 

disturbance of the sites would be brought under 

control through surveillance by rangers 

rotational organic farming of rice and corn was 

started and the controlled use of herbicides and 

pesticides investigated under the biotope 

management 



93 

? development of sustainable alternatives to 
intensive land use, such as organic farming and 

eco tourism, would also be promoted – including 
the construction of nature trails and information 

centres; 

? inform the general public on the district’s 
ecology and natural heritage. 

? nature trails were developed and guided visits / 
nature walks with wardens organized; 

? an information centre was built. 

 

? LIFE Porphyrio-Porhyrio project (1998-2001) – Reintroduction of the Purple Gallinule 

in the Lower Mondego River Valley project – birds were brought from the research centre in 

Valencia, Spain; there was conducted reproduction in the wild in Coimbra and then the birds 

were released in the pauls (Arzila, Madriz, Taipal) (EU, 1998). The objectives and results are 

in Table 3.6. 

 

Table 3.6 Objectives and results of LIFE Porhyrio-Porphyrio (EU, 1998)

? LIFE Palustris – Palustris (2001-2006) – Management of the Special Area of 

Conservation of the Marsh of Arzila: 34 ha acquired for state property, open water pools 

created, reduction of the reedbed by 40%, all the canals recovered, construction of a ringing 

station, construction of a macrophyte wastewater treatment plant, monitoring of species (EU, 

2001; 2007). The objectives and results are in Table 3.7. 

 

  



94 

Table 3.7 Objectives and results of the LIFE Palustris-Palustris (EU, 2001; 2007) 

Objectives Results 

draw up and partially implement a Paul de Arzila 

management plan to increase habitat diversity and 

the breeding population of target species;  

habitat diversity of the marsh increased with 

consequent benefits to the vulnerable species; 

increase all target habitats by at least 30% and see 

greater numbers of key species (particular targets 

included seeing a 20% increase in the population 

of ruivaco and around 3 more nesting couples of 

each of the Western marsh harrier and the purple 

heron); 

the reproductive population of the Purple Heron 

Ardea purpurea doubled; 
 

purchase 68 ha of marsh ecosystem; 33.3 ha of targeted marshland purchased from 175 

land owners to be managed exclusively for 

conservation purposes. This extended the total area 

of protected marshland in Arzila to 65 ha; 

reduction of the reedbank, creation of open water 

areas and removal of excessive sediments from the 

marshes;  

40% of the reedbed cleared, 2 ha of open water 

areas created. Key vegetation types spread, 

sediment removed from 22 ha of marshland; 

? set up facilities to treat wastewater by 
plants, monitor water quality and hydrology, and 

carry out surveillance of target species 

populations;  

? achieve a 60% decrease in organic pollution 
and a 40% decrease in chemical pollution; 

? a total of 15 km of ditches restored in four 
different areas of the reserve - Vala do Meio, Vala 

da Costa, Ponte do Passo and Vala dos Moinhos - 

allowing a better control of the water levels inside 

the project implementation areas; 

? a tertiary treatment process introduced into 
a facility for treatment of wastewater by plants; 

increase local awareness of the importance of this 

wetland and build an observation tower. 

a 7-meter high observation tower and an elevated 

60-meter pathway through the reedbed 

constructed. 

 

? the area of bulrush has been gradually declining due to reedbed Phragmites australis 

overgrowth, thus, only a small part remains, and only 1 local person does the cutting 

nowadays; 

? little has been done in the area of reedbed management. At the current stage of its growth, 

Phragmites australis needs regular cutting; 

However, it is important to note that in Portugal the problem of reedbed overgrowth on wetlands is not 

taken as seriously as it is in Belarus, for example, since there it really threatens the huge areas of 

natural mires. In Portugal Phragmites is not a common plant species, it serves for nesting of several 

important bird species, such as Reed Bunting, Purple Heron, Marsh Harrier, Great Reed Warbler, so, 

reedbed in this case plays a significant role in habitat support.  

Moreover, rice fields are perceived and they really are feeding areas for birds, so, they are also seen as 

a “necessary for conservation” landscape. 

? the problem of White Willow Salix alba overgrowth has never been addressed which has 

been causing the transformation of the northern part of the paul into the forest (Flumm, 2006); 

? water quality assessment was conducted under the ICNF supervision (Brito and Mieiro, 

2006).  



95 

In 2006, a sewage treatment plant started its work at the northern edge of the paul to tackle 

sewage coming from the surrounding villages. It has primary, secondary and tertiary 

treatment phases and discharges away from the wetland (EU, 2007). 

Development aspect 

 

Paul de Arzila has the following ecotourism and environmental education facilities: 

? there is an Interpretation Centre of the Paul de Arzila which has 4 employees (constructed 

within LIFE 1993-1995 project). Currently, little is being done by the centre due to lack of 

investment and initiative. What exists in the reserve is the results of  the 1990s work and LIFE 

projects: 

1. exposition of bulrush use in artisanate inside the centre (Figure A53b, Appendix); 

2. bulletins, brochures and booklets from the 1990s, in Portuguese only. What is more, there 

is no objective to make the new ones at the moment. Absence of materials in English is not 

seen as a problem. Since, it is said, “we do not aim at mass tourism here, more at conservation 

activities” unfortunately, conservation activities are also not noticed at the moment; 

3. information board near the centre with a zone division of the paul and explanation of the 

pedestrian route which is not easily-understandable (Figure A54, Appendix); 

4. pedestrian trail – path, bridge, observation points, one of them open, two other ones closed 

(constructed within 2001-2006 LIFE Palustris-Palustris (EU, 2007)). See Figure A53de, 

Appendix; 

? there is little promotion of the area: on the site of the ICNF, municipalities, 

VisitPortugal.com (Turismo de Portugal, 2014), some birdwatching sites, but mainly in 

Portuguese. Portuguese people are not interested in birdwatching that much, birdwatchers are 

mainly from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavian region, so it would be useful to 

focus on this group of potential visitors; 

? there is no local community involvement in the process of planning and development. 

What is said is that young part of local community of Arzila village mostly does not know 

about the existence of the wetland, only if they get to know that on the school visits. What is 

more, local people have never regarded this area as the one in need for conservation, they just 

used it for their own purposes, which means a rather low level of environmental awareness 

from the point of view of the modern green society.  

On the other hand, it is difficult to blame the people since locals are closer to nature more 

than anyone else, they did what they did in the past for their own good but the problem is that 

now the area is not used either for active agriculture or for artisanate due its degradation. It is 



96 

important to note that locals are even opposed to the management of the reserve since the 

establishment of the reserve set regulations of land use that deprived the people of their 

agricultural lands without any discussion with them and did not offer any alternative (Reis, 

2008). What remains is the area itself with all its biodiversity and negative consequences of 

human use having a great potential for conservation projects (which need funding), promotion 

and use for environmental education and ecological tourism purposes, moreover, bringing 

income to local community and conserving the area for future generations. 

The employees of the interpretation centre say they have had 2 alternatives – either stand for 

complete recuperation of the wetland which they did not support since human use was a 

natural element in the process, so the area got its new features due to that, both negative and 

positive ones (Leitão, 2013a). Thus, they have chosen the second alternative, to allow the 

wetland to develop naturally but try to slow down the degradation processes, so to say, take 

away negative factors and see what remains. It is a rather understandable and logical position 

but on condition of completing the mission of erasing negative factors – reed and willow 

overgrowth, non-native species of fish and crayfish, local community passiveness and 

deprivation of lands, lack of investment, lack of initiative on the side of the centre team.

What is planned 

 

Plans for the future development of the reserve are listed below: 

? there planned to be organized a meeting of the Parties involved in management of the paul 

– representatives of the local community, the municipalities, the Ministry of Environment 

Spatial Planning and Energy, the interpretation centre itself to decide on function division in 

the management of the area; 

? the new Management Plan is to be approved soon, it contains the future plans of the 

reserve administration. As for now, information about them was not given to me; 

? construction of the other part of the road N341/347 Arzila-Granja de Ulmeiro (Leitão, 

2013a; 2013c). 

 

3.2.1.9 Water quality analysis 

 

Water quality analysis data are located in Chapter 3.2.1, Appendix.  

The main conclusion from the research data is as follows: the results of 1999 and 2011 have 

shown water deterioration inside the paul. Although ph, O2 saturation, conductivity levels 

have not reflected drastic increases or decreases, the values of the nutrient parameters for the 

paul have equaled or even got higher than the level of those at the points close to the pollution 

sources. This has been caused by the effect of the wetland since water pollutants do not 

accumulate in the river, their values just reflect their real amount. For the wetland it is the 

other process: nutrients accumulate with time and only after a certain time period they can be 

really diagnosed and confirmed to be present. This time seems to be actually now, negative 

consequences of human activities are now seen in the paul not only in the form of extensive 

vegetation growth or poor biodiversity, but also in the values of water quality parameters. 

  



98 

3.2.1.10 Wetland condition analysis 

 

The table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.2, Appendix. The overall result obtained for 

Paul de Arzila is 15.51 out of 25 which is a medium, closer to low result showing lack of 

conservation actions for the areas and its gradual degradation. 

  



99 

3.2.2 Paul da Tornada 

 

3.2.2.1 Location 

 

Paul da Tornada is a freshwater permanently flooded marsh located in the region of Centre 

(NUT II sub-division (Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Oeste (West, NUT III sub-division 

(Eurostat, 2014)), part of the district of Leiria, the municipality council of Caldas da Rainha, 

the parish of Tornada village (ICNF, 2014a). The paul is situated right in the centre of 

Tornada village (Figure 3.19).  

  

Figure 3.19 Location of Paul da Tornada (Google Earth)  

 

3.2.2.2 History and present main features 

 

The oldest historical references to the Tornada Marsh are associated with the creation of the 

city of Caldas da Rainha and the foundation of its Thermal Hospital, by the Queen Leonor de 

Lencastre in the end of the 15
th

 century. The paul already existed at that time but with the 

name of Cornaga which then was changed in the 17
th

 century (Lemos, 2013b). 

The Tornada marsh is part of a set of lowlands created as a result of a range of sea arms that 

entered into the bay of São Martinho do Porto and covered the area of the paul and 

surrounding zones. A few centuries ago a true inland sea existed in the region, surrounded by 

substantial human settlements (Lemos, 2013b). The area was formed in a small alluvial plain 

included in a typhonic valley with extensive reedbeds and a lot of aquatic openings (Figure 

A68, Appendix). Geologically, due to its sea formation the valley is surrounded by the 



100 

structures of mudslides and beach sands, argillaceous sandstones, lignites and dolomites, sand 

dunes and limestones (Figure A67, Appendix). Hydrographically, Paul da Tornada receives 

the waterflow from the superficial sub-basin of Vala Real which then is connected with the 

Tornada River basin (Figure A69, Appendix). 

With sea retreat, the area gradually got its present hydrographic regime: the central zone 

stayed flooded most of the year, encircled by land covered with water only during the winter.  

Approximately in the 13
th

 century the margins of the area started to be used for agriculture, 

later cultivated for the needs of the Thermal Hospital. The ditches are supposed to have been 

opened in the 16
th

 century (Lemos, 2013b). Various owners have followed one another.  

The next references about the paul are only in the 1960s when the margins of the paul started 

to be used for vineyards and rice cultivation. Moreover, there existed species of bamboo 

collected for making mats.  

In the next decades the paul has gone through degradation due to the nearby industries, 

unregulated livestock farms, sewage from Caldas da Rainha. There is evidence that in the dry 

periods of the 1980s the pollutant discharges could be seen and a lot of animals were dead 

(Lemos, 2013b). Later the area had been abandoned until non-governmentla organizations 

Association PATO (A Associação de Defesa do Paul de Tornada) and GEOTA took 

preservation and recuperation measures in 1988 (PATO, 2014). Since 1992 the site has been 

rented by GEOTA. In 2001 the area became a Ramsar site (Wetlands International, 2014). In 

2009 Paul da Tornada received the status of Local Natural Reserve (ICNF, 2014). 

So the marsh now represents a central permanently inundated part of 25 ha divided in the 

middle by the drainage ditch of Vala de Meio and limited in the east and the west by two 

drainage canals (Vala de Guarda Mato, Vala de Palhagueira), coming from small streams at 

the south end of the marsh (Lemos, 2013b). In this flat zone the canals run until the northeast 

end of the wetland where they join. The system of ditches goes further to the north where the 

waterflow converges into the Tornada River and further flows into the bay of São Martinho 

do Porto. The permanent inundation of the Paul is explained by the fact that the groundwater 

level is very high due to the existence of the aquifier. The surrounding area gets inundated in 

the rainy season although the area of the paul has the fewest amount of precipitation in the 

region (Lemos, 2013b).  

 

3.2.2.3 Protection regimes 

 

Paul da Tornada has the following national, European and international protection statuses: 



101 

? National – Local Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural Local, established in 2009), part of 

Reserva Ecológica Natural, Reserva Agrícola Nacional (2008), National Network of Protected 

Areas (Rede Nacional das Áreas Protegidas, 2009), “natural areas” by Caldas da Rainha 

municipality (2002) (Lemos, 2013b); 

Logo of the reserve (Figure 3.20) shows European Otter Lutra lutra as a key species. 

 

Figure 3.20 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014a) 

? International – Ramsar Site established in 2001 (Wetlands International, 2014). 

 

3.2.2.4 Area size and zoning 

 

Tornada Marsh has an area of 50 ha, out of which 25 ha are permanently inundated and form 

a central zone: part of it is open water area with deeper zones representing small lakes.  

Localization of the paul is shown on Figure 3.21. 

 

Figure 3.21 Localization of Paul da Tornada on the physical map (Lemos, 2013b) 



102 

Dominant vegetation is Water Smartweed Polygonum amphibium L., Rigid Hornwort 

Ceratophyllum demersum L.; True Bulrush Scirpus lacustris on the margins of the central 

zone (Lemos, 2013b). 

? semi-inundated area is mostly covered with Common Reed Phragmites australis. There are 

also other plant species forming “carpets” on the water surface, and trees like Grey Willow 

Salix atrocinerea and Black Poplar Populus nigra around the paul (Lemos, 2013b); 

? areas to the west and south of the paul, inundated only in the winter used for agriculture to 

a small extent due to the hardly suitable conditions: April/May – planting of tomatoes, 

potatoes, corn, wheat, oat, pumpkin, cabbage, alface; between the inundated areas and the 

southern point of connection of 3 ditches – zone of corn and hybrid sargo growing in the 

summer; 

? the surrounding forested areas are mostly covered with Maritime Pine Pinus pinaster and 

some Tasmanian Blue Gum Eucalyptus globulus (Lemos, 2013b). 

The zoning described above is reflected on the map of landscape units from the Management 

Plan (Figure A70, Appendix). Reed beds dominate the paul area. 

 

3.2.2.5 Natural values of Paul da Tornada 

 

According to Lemos (2013b), the paul possesses rare fauna species as well as carries out 

multiple functions for them: 

? 145 bird species; 

? 1 critically endangered species – Whiskered Tern Chlidonias Hybrida, 3 endangered 

species – Black-Crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax, Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus 

paludicola, Purple Heron Ardea puprurea; 

? major importance for migrating birds as wintering areas: Northern Shoveler Anas clypeata, 

Eurasian Teal Anas crecca, Gadwall Anas strepera, Grey Heron Ardea cinere, Common 

Pochard Aythya ferina, Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago, Spotted Crake Porzana porzana, 

Goldcrest Regulus regulus; 

? important for some migratory species that stay a few days resting and feeding before 

finishing their journey: Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Eurasian Wigeon Anas 

Penelope, Garganey Anas querquedula, Bluethroat Luscinia svecica; 

? breeding site for some species that are threatened in most parts of their own 

biogeographical area: Eurasian Reed Warbler Acrocepalus scirpaceus, Great Reed Warbler 



103 

Acrocephaalus arundinaceus, Purple Swamp-Hen Porphyrio Porphyrio, Purple Heron Ardea 

purpurea, Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides, Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus, 

Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus, Savi’s Warbler Locustella luscinioides; 

or to species that breed in this region and feed on the wetland or on the surroundings: 

Common Swift Apus apus, Alpine Swift Apus melba, Rock Dove Columba livia, Common 

Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus, Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus; 

? important for some fishes such as Conger-eels Anguilla anguilla, a migratory species 

threatened by water pollution and illegal fishing; 

? 18 species of mammals, habitat for some threatened mammals such as iberian endemics 

Iberian Shrew Sorex granarius, Western Meditteranean Mouse Mus spretus; Greater White-

Toothed Shrew Crocidura russula, Least Weasel Mustela nivalis, European Badger Meles 

meles, European Otter Lutra lutra; 

? 12 species of reptiles such as European Pond Turle Emys orbicularis, Mediterranean Turtle 

Mauremys leprosa, iberian endemic of Schreiber’s Green Lizard Lacerta Schreiberi; 

? 8 species of amphibians, 2 iberian endemics Bosca’s Newt Triturus boscai, Portuguese 

Painted Frog Discoglossus galganoi; 

 

3.2.2.6 Current state: threats 

 

During the Preparation of the Management Plan SWOT analysis (Table 3.9) was conducted 

and the matrix developed with strong and weak points of the paul performance and 

opportunities and threats for its development (Lemos, 2013b). 

 

Table 3.9 SWOT-analysis of Paul da Tornada (Lemos, 2013b) 

Strengths Weaknesses 

? biodiversity; 
? species with high status of conservation; 
? environmental NGO working in the area; 
? localization; 
? existence of the Interpretation Centre; 
? activities on environmental education; 
? birds monitoring; 
? knowledge about the area; 
? being Local Natural Reserve; 
? being Ramsar Site; 
? existence of technical support; 
? proper management of the site 

? little promotion; 
? hardly an attractive environment; 
? infesting exotic species; 
? unattractive or absent trails; 
? lack of infrastructure for visits; 
? lack of parking; 
? absence of information boards, signs; 
? domestic and industrial pollution; 
? urban pressure; 
? localization; 
? weak demand; 
? lack of retaining strips to prevent fires on the 

margins of the ditches; 

? lack of investment; 
? energetically unsustainable building of the centre; 



104 

? lack of marking of the reserve boundaries; 
? lack of room for exhibitions, café, restaurant 

Opportunities Threats 

? possibility to function in the network with the 
other wetland sites; 

? organization of better access to the area; 
? integration into the programmes of study visits; 
? can be a recreation area; 
? possibility to get community funds; 
? rise in ecotourism; 
? change of consumption habits; 
? increase in activities of birdwatching; 
? promotion of higher environmental awareness 

and social responisibility of the entreprises; 

? rise in the number of qualified specialists (more 
employment); 

? social networks on the Internet (promotion); 
? thematic promotion of visits; 
? promotion of internships; 
? creation of restaurant, tourism facilities; 
? organization of camps; 
? deeper cooperation with universities; 
? use of renewable energies; 
? local development; 
? rural tourism development 

? lack of guarantees of long-term funding; 
? illegal hunting; 
? illegal capture of birds; 
? possibility to exceed loading capacity of the site; 
? landscape planning and urban pressure; 
? maintenance of pollution cases in the paul basin; 
? increase in the number of industries in the paul 

basin; 

? increase in vandalism cases 

 

Analysis of the SWOT matrix shows that the strengths of the reserve performance result from 

its biodiversity, localization and successful conservation initiatives carried out within the past 

projects. 

The weaknesses reduce the integral use of the site potential, they mainly result from the 

inadequate measures on provision of sustainable and regulated visits in the past. 

The opprotunities listed guarantee that the reserve can turn into the area of conservation, 

recreation, study and collective learning. 

Below the views of the paul are shown indicating current state of the site (Figure 3.22).

3.2.2.7 Management: past and present 

 

The complete wetland area is a private property. Currently it is rented by GEOTA (an 

environmental national NGO), together with PATO (self-funding) and receiving some 

financial support from the ICNF and the Municipal Council (Câmara Municipal de Caldas da 

Rainha) (Lemos, 2013b). 

The first Management Plan (Plano de Gestão) of the reserve was developed in 2010 (Lemos, 

2013b). That one has been revised and given to the author for analysis. It must be noted that 

management concept of Paul da Tornada is completely different from the other research sites 

in Portugal, the approach is modern and practically oriented. The main features and priorities 

of the Plan are set as follows (Lemos, 2013b): 

? the Management Plan has been the result of cooperation between central administration 

(ICNF), local administration (municipality of Caldas da Rainha) and NGOs of PATO and 

GEOTA; 

? there has been applied the concept of proactive territorial management with the mission to 

conserve, valorize and promote the natural heritage of Paul da Tornada through its research 

and interpretation, sustainable use, and connection with the community as an area for 

education and recreation; 

? priorities:  

1. maintain, enhance and promote natural values of the site;  



107 

2. boost the site development as a platform for education on sustainable development, in 

cooperation with civil society, regional and local entities; 

3. develop an innovative model of the site operational management; 

The actions in the plan were developed within the 3 priority goals for various time periods 

within 2010-2016. Among these actions the key ones are as follows (Table 3.10):

The information showed above is an evidence of a rather efficient work of the reserve in the 

recent 5 years. A lot of planned measures were implemented although there are a lot of them 

to still plan and bring to life. 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

Conservation work in Paul da Tornada has been led in the following directions: 

? there are some scientific projects in collaboration with the Universities (Faculdade de 

Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa; Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade 

Nova de Lisboa; Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Coimbra) and ICNF (Lemos, 

2013a); 

? under the Management Plan the following measures were planned (Table 3.11), they were 

mostly implemented in 2010-2012 or are being implemented regularly in the reserve. 

Table 3.11 Conservation actions of the Plan (Lemos, 2013b) 

Identify exotic infesting species 

Facilitate elimination of sewage discharge 

Sign collaboration protocols with investigation centres 

Maintain the station for monitoring paludal and aquatic bird species 

Develop a programme on reed management and implement actions on its cutting 

Maintain the roads necessary for fire prevention 

Remove infesting exotic species of plants 

Plant trees and bushes of riparian galleries (ash,willows, common cattail, true bulrush) 

Conduct a research on pollution sources of the paul basin and monitor water quality 

Inventory and monitoring of ducks, otter, bats, turtles, dragonflies and butterflies, fish and amphibians 

Develop a database on flora, fauna, habitats and conservation measures in the reserve 

Purchase lab equipment  

Plan creation of the system of the paul basin for mitigation of urban pressure 

However, the measures on reed cutting taken in 2010-2012 are of a very small scope and have 

not contributed to the overgrowth prevention. Cutting must be carried out urgently for the 

bigger areas. 

All the other actions are also implemented to a small extent. This can not stop landscape 

degradation if time management is not replanned. 

 

Development aspect

The following measures were planned and partially fulfilled within the Managemetnt Plan 

(Table 3.12). 

Table 3.12 Development actions of the Plan (Lemos, 2013b) 

Create a web-site of the reserve 

Plan the system of trails for visits with information boards, signs

Organization of guided visits, cooperation with tourism entreprises 

Employ a professional intern, attract student interns for projects 

Participate in public events 

Construct the trails and set inforboards, signs 

Develop a booklet for visitors 

Improve access to the centre 

As a result, the reserve now has the following conditions for ecotourism and environmental 

education activities: 

? CEEPTA, ecological and educational centre of the paul opened in 2000 (Figure A71, 

Appendix; PATO, 2014), which is responsible for organization of various activities and 

ecotourism facilities such as: pedestrian trails in the paul,  educational workshops on 

recycling, construction of nests and feeding platforms, aromatic and medical plants, 

organization of exhibitions, meetings, commemoration of environmental events; 

? there is an information kit for teachers, booklets for visitors in Portuguese (the new one is 

being prepared with an English version inclusively (Lemos, 2013c)); 

? there is an unequipped pedestrian trail (Figure A72, Appendix); 

? visitors are mostly school children, there are sometimes foreign tourists but very rarely 

(Figure 7A2, Appendix) (Lemos, 2013a), promotion is very low; 

There is no stats on the number of visitors in the recent years but the approximate number 

annually is 3000-5000 people (Lemos, 2013c), most part of them being schoolchildren on the 

organized visits. 

? rudimentary laboratory has been created to allow scientific research for nature 

conservation on the site, there are sleeping places on the 2
nd

 floor of the centre, together with 

binoculars and spotting scope for visitors (Lemos, 2013b); 

? guided visits are offered to public if booked previously to visit (Lemos, 2013a). 

 

3.2.2.8 What needs to be done and what is planned 

What needs to be done 

 

The following measures need to be taken to improve the nature conservation and 

ecotourism/education performance of the reserve: 



110 

? search for long-term investment; 

? habitat management – reedcutting, removal of bushes, for both conservation and 

attractiveness purposes; 

? more active promotion of the site among potential tourists; 

? basic tourist facilities, e.g. possibility of use of the 2nd floor of the centre for 

accommodation of tourists, not only researchers, information boards, trails, observation 

points; 

? involvement of local community members in the activities carried out by the reserve. 

 

What is planned 

Paul da Tornada has the following plans for the future: 

? there planned to be constructed 2 observation towers and a short wooden trail with an 

information board about birds of the paul. A small area of reeds and trees has been cut and 

cleaned for this future construction, edges of he marsh are to be cleaned for better visibility; 

? updated booklet in Portuguese and English is to be published; 

? revised actions of Management Plant to be implemented further (Lemos, 2013a). 

 

3.2.2.9 Water quality analysis 

 

The data for evaluation of water quality at Paul da Tornada are located in Chapter 3.2.2, 

Appendix. The results of the analysis clearly indicate ongoing pollution in the paul by the 

high levels of nitrates, phopsphates and ammonia. The measures already taken by the 

administration of the reserve do not seem to influence the problem since there has not been 

registered any decrease in the nutrients’ level. However, the regular assessment of the water 

quality in the future could determine the efficiency of the conservation actions since the 

improvement of conditions in the paul needs time to be reflected in the water quality 

parameters. 

 

3.2.2.10 Wetland condition analysis 

 

The table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.2, Appendix. The overall result obtained for 

Paul da Tornada is 17 out of 25 which is a medium value showing that the paul is polluted 

with nutrients, suffers from drainage in the past being severely overgrown and is involved in 

few conservation actions.

3.2.3 Paul do Boquilobo 

 

3.2.3.1 Location 

 

Paul do Boquilobo is a freshwater marsh located in the region of Alentejo (NUT II sub-

division (Eurostat, 2014)), the sub-region of Lezíria do Tejo (NUT III sub-division (Eurostat, 

2014)), on the right bank of the Tagus river (in the hydrographic basin of the River Almonda), 

part of the district of Santarem, the two municipality councils (Golegã and Torres Novas) and 

the parish of Azinhaga village (Pereira, 2013b). Location is shown on Figure 3.23. 

 

Figure 3.23 Location of Paul do Boquilobo (Google Earth) 

 

3.2.3.2 History and present main features 

 

Paul do Boquilobo was formed in the transition zone between alluvial plain (corresponding 

mostly with Total Protection Zone) and fluvial terraces (the other Areas, zoning is described 

further in the text) (Pereira, 2013b).  

The alluvial plain was once an area of the River Almonda itself and surrounding seasonally 

inundated lands, now it is an area of the River Almonda, riparian galleries with willows and 

ashes, drainage ditches. So, the area has been in agricultural use (rice cultivation with Poplar 

surrounding the fields) for a long time, supported by the drainage procedures of the 20
th

 

century (Pereira, 2013b). As a result, the hydrographic basin of the river was drastically 

changed by the network of multiple ditches. 



112 

With the establishment of the reserve in 1980 part of the area has gone through the 

regeneration process, the other one has continued to be used in agricultural practices. The 

research data (Pereira, 2013b) show consequent abandonment of lands by 1999.  

The hydrographic system of the paul as an agricultural area has functioned in the following 

way: floods from the Tagus River naturally inundate the site starting from October-November 

and part of it subsequently dries out when the water table is mechanically lowered in spring to 

create larger areas for cultivation. The site may also act as a flooding buffer zone contributing 

to increased protection of adjoining farmland areas against erosion caused by winter floods. 

For many years this wetland has been a valuable sink for alluvial particles carried in by the 

Tagus River creating rich cultivated areas, which have contributed to the economic wealth of 

the area (see Figure A80, Appendix). 

Fluvial terraces in the western part of the reserve were traditionally covered with cork oaks, 

rice fields and olive trees, later fig trees, irrigated crops cultivation appeared. By the 1980s 

there had started transition to planting sunflower, tomatoes, melon, irrigated corn, beet, 

vineyards, land use for pastures, cork oaks with irrigated corn having become the dominant 

culture. 

In the last 50 years, the area of the reserve was the property of 3 farm estates - Quinta do Paul 

do Boquilobo, Quinta de Mato Miranda and Quinta da Broa, the first one once belonged to the 

Knights Templar and the Order of Christ (Pereira, 2013b). 

Before reserve creation the paul was an area belonging to Quinta do Paul do Boquilobo as a 

hunting area. Now it is still belongs to the same family. What is left are 3 families of farmers 

and their houses (earlier there were 13 families), a church, and a farming area of olive trees, 

cork oaks where there are still 5 tractor drivers and 1 guard (Pereira, 2013b).  

In the area of Quinta de Mato Miranda there was a vineyard, olive trees grown in the 1920s, 

then added cork oaks, wheat (did not grow well), then corn and sunflower in the 60s, and 

experiments on animal farming (cows and pigs) (Pereira, 2013b).  

Now the use of land is much less intensive. Land use regimes can be seen on Figure A83, 

Appendix. However, the drainage and intensive agriculture in the past have led to overgrowth 

of ditches with reeds, bulrushes, sedges and willows. 

 

3.2.3.3 Protection regimes 

 

Paul do Boquilobo has the following national, European and international protection statuses: 

? National – Nature Reserve (Reserva Natural, established in 1980 (ICNF, 2008)); 



113 

Logo of the reserve (Figure 3.24) shows Purple Heron as a key species. 

 

Figure 3.24 Logo of the reserve (ICNF, 2014e) 

? European – Special Protection Area, Rede Natura 2000 (ICNF, 2014b); 

? International – Biosphere Reserve (the only Portuguese protected area in the World 

Network of Biosphere Reserves of UNESCO) (ICNF, 2014a), Ramsar site established in 1996 

(Wetlands International, 2014), Important Bird Area (ICNF, 2014b). 

 

3.2.3.4 Area size and zoning 

 

The reserve has an area of 817 ha (ICNF, 2014b) which, as it has already been mentioned, is a 

transition zone between alluvial plain and fluvial terraces.  

By the reclassification of 2008 the reserve got its new division system into Total Protection 

Area, Partial Protection Area, Complementary Protection Area and Area of Specific 

Intervention. The state has bought almost the whole area of Total Protection Zone which 

allows for protection of the central core of the paul from the direct human disturbance. 

According to ICNF, 2008 and ICNF, 2014b, the paul is divided into the following zones 

(Figure 3.25): 



114 

 

 

Figure 3.25 Zoning of the paul (Pereira, 2013b) 



115 

Total Protection Area 189 ha – permanently inundated areas, with limited access only for 

conservation obectives; 

Partial Protection Area 167 ha – temporarily inundated or not inundated areas, used for 

pastures, fishing and conservation activities; 

Complementary Protection Area 436 ha – agricultural lands, with requirements for 

sustainable use of natural resources for well-being of the former 2 areas; 

Area of Specific Intervention 25 ha – estates, buildings associated with history of the paul, 

above mentioned quintas. 

The main part of the reserve area is covered with the wetland area, further by percentage of 

cover go agricultural lands, water areas, and forest lands. The  distribution of lands among 

various landscapes and activities is shown on  Figure A82-A83, Appendix.  

 

3.2.3.5 Natural values of Paul do Boquilobo 

 

According to ICNF (2014b) and Pereira (2013b), the site possesses the following unique 

features and fauna species: 

? important wetland site with excellent conditions for wintering, nesting and support of 

migratory routes of many aquatic bird species especially such as Herons (Bulbucus ibis, 

Egretta garzetta, Nycticorax nycticorax, Ardea purpurea, Ardea cinerea, Ixobrychus minutus 

e Ardeola ralloides) and Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia. During nesting season they 

form the biggest concentrations in the country; 

? during winter season the paul is a gathering site for ducks, Purple Swamphens, Coots, 

representing 47 % of national winter population of Northern Pintail Anas acuta, 35 % of 

Common Pochard Aythya ferina, 12 % of Shoveler Anas clypeata; 

? threatened species like Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, Water Pipit Anthus 

spinoletta and Bluethroat Luscinia svecica can be seen here; 

? important role in regulation of hydrological system and improvement of water quality, 

absorbing excess water during rainy season and feeding groundwater during dry periods. 

Overall there were identified the following numbers of various species in the paul: 

? 16 fish species, including 2 lusitanian endemic species Boga portuguesa Chondrostoma 

lusitanicum and Rutilus macrolepidotus; 

? 11 reptile species;

http://www.icnf.pt/portal/naturaclas/patrinatur/lvv/resource/doc/peix/chondr-lusit


116 

? 13 amphibian species, including 4 iberian endemics Iberian Newt Triturus boscai, Iberian 

Frog Rana iberica, Iberian midwife toad Alytes cisternasii, Iberian Painted Frog Discoglossus 

galganoi; 

? 27 mammal species, among them European Otter, European Polecat; 

? 226 bird species. 

 

3.2.3.6 Current state: threats 

 

According to Pereira (2013b): 

? the problems in the area are caused by the drainage canals constructed up the River 

Almonda stream to the north of the reserve and in the paul itself which disturbed the natural 

hydrographic system of the area and waterflow from the Rivers Tagus and Almonda, in 

particular. The paul gets water renovation from them only during high floods which are not 

regular, the water it gets regularly is of poor quality and from secondary sources; 

? fishing and hunting practices allowed in the big part of the reserve – 2 hunting  and 2 

fishing zones within the forest and water area inside and outside the paul; 

? there is an exotic invasive species of Louisiana Crayfish that has already been mentioned 

in the Paul de Arzila characteristic. There have not been any researches on that in Paul do 

Boquilobo; 

? there is an American plant species of Water Hyacinth introduced in the 1970s that has 

invaded the area (which is an indicator of its water pollution and excess of nutrients) and 

threatens the whole ecosystem forming vast patches on the water that decrease oxygen 

accessibility and harm potential biodiversity; 

? urban and industrial pollution from the villages of Riachos, Entroncamento and Golegã 

(pig farms) with pollutants reaching the western part of the reserve (nesting sites of lots of 

bird species), agricultural pollution (nutrients and plastic). 

It is important to note that all the pollution sources, except for agriculture, are located outside 

the reserve. The problem here is malfunctioning of sanitation system in the Almonda basin; 

? lack of activities at the interpretation centre of the paul, lack of promotion of the reserve as 

an ecotourism destination. 

The views of the paul at present are shown below (Figure 3.26).

3.2.3.7 Management: past and present 

 

The reserve is managed by its administration, with the help of the municipalities. A big part of 

the lands have been bought from the various landowners by the state (177 ha, 150 ha of which 

is Total Protection Area (ICNF, 2014b). 

The main agricultural users for now are 3 above mentioned estates, the agriculturers of 

Golegã and Azinhaga to the east of the paul, the ones of Riachos and Golegã to the north. To 

the west of the reserve are pastures (goats, sheep) of people from Brogueira and Alcorochel. 

Fishers are mostly people from Azinhaga village (Pereira, 2013b). 

The Paul Management Plan was approved in 2008. 

The development strategy of the paul aims first of all, at (ICNF, 2008): 

? conservation of natural values (herons colony, palearctic birds’ wintering sites) of the 

central part of the paul with permanently inundated lands; 

? maintenance of the sesoanlly inundated lands and areas of extensive use between the 

central part and peripheral part of intensive agricultural use; 

? reestablishment of water connections with the Tagus and Almonda Rivers and clearing of 

the ditches to widen the inundated areas and stop the ongoing reduction of the wetland; 

? recuperation of riparian galleries; 

? sustainable management of resources for adequate agricultural, fishing, forestry practices 

and land use for pastures;  

? proper management of area use by public visitors, its recreational use for educational 

purposes,  its use as a laboratory for research.  

To achieve this, the reserve has been in collaboration with the organisations working in  

agriculture, farming, research and education, and also in a permanent dialogue with the 

authorities (Pereira, 2013a). 

 

Conservation aspect 

 

There were planned the following measures in the reserve by the 2008 Management Plan 

(ICNF, 2008; Pereira, 2013b): 

Total Protection Area: 



120 

? establishment of Additional Water Treatment Station for supplemental purification after 

ETAR, and construction of dam system in the Almonda basin for providing water supply in 

periods of high floods; 

? reconstruction of an old ditch which connects Total Protection Area with Valado da 

Estrema in Várzea do Canto dos Trancos; 

? construction of a new ditch to create a protection zone between agricultural lands and Total 

Protection Area; 

Partial Protection Area: 

? creation of a pedestrian trail which exists in the unequipped form, the other route for 

observation of habitats, and organization of camping places; 

? construction of the gate for management of ETAR effluents and their redirection into the 

River Almonda in case of accident of malfunction – this measure is hard to understand, 

obvious is the fact that it is taken for protection of agricultural fields and not for improvement 

of water quality; 

? regeneration of connection between the Tagus and the paul through the system of alvercas 

of Golegã, using existing ditches, which will allow water renovation both in the paul and 

alvercas not depending on flood season; 

What is being done: 

? control of water level in the paul is continued to be done through the existing system of 

ditches using the following rules: upon the start of rainy season the gates are kept open for 

water renovation until the water level is 1.5 m or a bit higher, the gates are kept closed as long 

as the water level is 1.5 m; 

? permanent monitoring of fauna (especially avifauna) in the form of regular bird counts by 

the paul employees (Pereira, 2013a); 

? there exist agreements with various educational institutions of secondary and polytechnic 

level on monitoring environmental conditions in the paul, water and soil quality in particular; 

? as a result of 2 previous points – rich photo database on the evolution of the area (Pereira, 

2013a); 

? there have been the bird conservation projects, e.g. the one on placing nests at particular 

points to enhance nesting of certain bird species (Pereira, 2013a); 

? there is currently a project on conservation of a rare plant species Narcissus fernandesii, 

aimed at its establishment on the new lands acquired by state (Pereira, 2013a); 



121 

? there has been a permanent collaboration dialogue with Torres Novas municipality within 

which there is a current project with community funds on improvement of sanitation 

conditions in the municipality which would resolve the pollution problem in the reserve also 

(Pereira, 2013a); 

? the efforts to tackle the negative consequences of drainage ditches construction have been 

faced with lack of human and financial resources. 

 

Development aspect 

 

The paul possesses the following facilities for ecotourism and environmental education: 

? the paul is open to visitors (tourists, scientists, students) supporting the main objective of 

nature conservation (Pereira, 2013a). There is a partially equipped pedestrian trail that can be 

done independently by visitors (Figure A84, Appendix), with information boards, observation 

tower (Figure A85, Appendix) which is hard to find due to overgrowth with bushes. Requests 

for guided visits are also accepted (Pereira, 2013a); 

? there is an Interpretation Centre with an exhibition on the paul. However, the timetable of 

the paul centre is rather irregular; 

? there are no updated booklets (only the old ones in Portuguese), little promotion (sites of 

ICNF, municipalities, birdwatching sites, with information mainly in Portuguese) and no web-

site; 

? there are 2 enterprises licensed to organize pedestrian walks in the reserve (Pereira, 2013a). 

 

3.2.3.8 What needs to be done 

 

There is no information on future plans of the reserve. So, the necessary measures are listed 

below: 

? renovation of the proper connection with the Rivers Tagus and Almonda; 

? elimination of pollution sources, cooperation with the entities involved in the problem; 

? research and plan for elimination of invasive plant and animal species; 

? more active promotion of the site, development of the strategy on working with visitors, 

creation of a web-site; 

? clearing of certain areas accessible for visitors from the bushes and trees; 

? installation of infoboards, plan on organization of accommodation, other tourism facilities; 



122 

? development of a new booklet in English and Portuguese; 

? revision of the Management Plan and proper management of its implementation, 

distribution of responsibilities among the administration members; 

? regular control of the actions implemented within the Management Plan. 

 

3.2.3.9 Water quality analysis 

 

The research data and results are located in Chapter 3.2.3, Appendix. The results of the 

analysis give a clear evidence of the ongoing penetration of the pollutants into the paul. 

Though the nutrients’ values are not in the critical range for the paul itself, their values 

outside the site show high pollution levels. Moreover, the data for the analysis point inside the 

site were available only till 2005 which increase the possibility of the current values being 

much higher. The exact information could be obtained in case of conducting present analysis 

at the 2 points and comparing the results. 

 

3.2.3.10 Wetland condition analysis 

 

The Table of evaluation is located in Chapter 3.2.3, Appendix. The overall result obtained for 

Paul do Boquilobo is 16.66 out of 25 which is a medium value showing that the paul suffers 

from the ongoing pollution, drainage and intensive agricultural use consequences and lack of 

conservation actions. 

 

  



123 

3.2.4 Peatbog in Lagoa de D. João 

 

The peat bog in Lagoa do Dom João is part of the mountainous range of Serra de Montemuro 

in the north of Portugal, however, no management regulations are applied to it, no nature 

conservation and tourism activities carried out, few factors threatening its well-being (fires, 

cattle). The site is completely natural and almost untouched. The reason for its including into 

the research list was stated in Introduction. The characteristic of this peat bog does not 

provide information on efficient wetland management since its location and use have 

guaranteed its conservation. However, it is important as the only peat marsh among the 

Portuguese research sites and peat ph analysis can serve as a confirmation of its high 

conservation status. 

 

3.2.4.1 Location 

 

The peat bog is situated in the north of Portugal, the mountainous region of Serra de 

Montemuro, the region of Norte (NUT II sub-division) (Eurostat, 2014), the sub-region of 

Tâmega (NUT III sub-division), the district of Viseu, the council of Resende, the parishes of 

Panchorra and Feirão (Profico Ambiente, 2006). Location is shown on Figure 3.27. 

 

Figure 3.27 Location of the bog (Google Earth) 

 

3.2.4.2 History and present main features 

 

Serra de Montemuro, where the peat bog is situated, is bounded by the River Douro on the 

north and by the River Paiva in the south and southwest (Espírito de Aventura, 2013). It is a 



124 

very important site for conservation of species such as wolf and water-mole. 

The dominated flora is English oak Quercus robur and Maritime pine Pinus pinaster 

(Turismo de Portugal, 2014b). Serra de Montemuro is known for its granitic valleys with 

stones scattered around the mountain areas. 

The peat bog in Lagoa do D. João is a typical one for the Portuguese mountains. Such 

peatbogs form on the mountain platforms with lowland parts which were part of marine areas 

in the past (Terra Nossa, 2006): the geological conditions were created, rainwater was 

gradually collected in the shallow lakes where Sphagnum moss grows easily, organic matter 

accumulates and decomposes turning into peat. 

Mountain peat bogs are formations of high importance because they are used as pastures by 

locals. However, it is necessary to note that most areas are used rather sustainably due to a 

small number of cattle and a low level of their disturbance since they are far from any mass 

tourist route. However, some of the peatbogs reflect the consequences of intensive agriculture 

and fires (Serra da Freita) (RTP, 2005). 

The peat bog in Lagoa de D. João was formed in the same way as it was described above. It 

represents a lake of 3 ha and an adjacent 10 ha area of peat bog at 1110 m elevation with 

characteristic bog vegetation (Sphagnum spp., Juncus aquarossus, Carex spp., Drosera 

rotundifolia), water level of 0.15 m approximately.  

Next to the site there is the Eolic park of D. João and Feirão which posed a threat to the 

peatbog in 2005 when its planning was discussed with the authorities and there was an 

intention to construct a trail for better access to the wind turbines which would cross the 

peatbog. Fortunately, this was prevented and the site was left untouched (Profico Ambiente, 

2006). 

Granitic stones are represented here scattered around the mountain slopes on one side and 

gathered into fences for cattle on the other. The site has been used for pastures and forestry, 

now these activities are continued. Moreover, there have been fires in the recent 40-50 years 

from which he peatbog suffered (Monteiro-Henriques, 2014). Anyway, like it was said above, 

the site looks natural and weakly disturbed, it is too far from the main tourist routes, 

sometimes there can be visitors but few of them, so, nature conservation and tourism at the 

site are not developed. Moreover, there is no need in nature conservation activities since the 

bog has always developed naturally.  

The views of the bog are shown on Figure 3.28 below. 



125 

 

 

 



126 

 

 

 



127 

 

Figure 3.28 Views of the bog (Malashevich, 2014b) 

It must be noted that the other areas of Serra de Montemuro are said to suffer the 

consequences of human activities: deforestation, overgrowth with bushes and shrubs due to 

active use of the lands for pastures. The research peat bog is least suffered of the area in this 

case.  

What concerns tourism, it must be said, there are some tourist routes passing next to the peat 

bog but not directly through it (Turismo de Portugal, 2014b).  

 

3.2.4.3 Protection regimes 

 

The peatbog has the following national and European protection statuses: 

? National – being part of Serra de Montemuro, it belongs to Reserva Agrícola Nacional, 

Reserva Ecológia Nacional, Biotope CORINE Montemuro/Bigorne (Turismo Centro de 

Portugal, 2014); 

? European – part of the 1st phase of the National List of Rede Natura 2000 (Turismo 

Centro de Portugal, 2014). 

 

3.2.4.4 Peat ph analysis 

 

Ph analysis of peat at Lagoa do Dom João was carried out on 30 October, 2013. Samples were 

taken at 4 locations (3 samples per each location) since the peat layer depth was not exactly 

known. 



128 

The samples from the first 3 locations turned out to be more “earth” than “peat”, so only the 

4
th

 location´s results are supposed to show the real peat ph values. Average values were then 

obtained (Table 3.13). 

Table 3.13 Results of peat ph analysis 

Location Ph Sample 4 

1 4.07 

2 4.05 

3 4.05 

4 4.057 

 

The peat ph results at the 4
th

 location demonstrate the strongly acidic character of peat (low 

values of ph) which is typical of a natural peat bog.  

The value of the von Post Decomposition Index is 3 which means “very slightly decomposed 

peat which, when squeezed, releases muddy brown water, but from which no peat passes 

between the fingers. Plant remains still identifiable, and no amorphous material present” (von 

Post Decomposition Index Figure A89, Appendix). 

So, the analysis turns out to confirm the almost unchanged character of the site and its natural 

development. However, fires and further area use for pastures pose threats to future well-

being of the bog. 

There is no point and perspective for tourism development here. Those interested in 

discovering Portuguese peat bogs will find information about them. However, this part could 

be much better organized since there is not much database information about the Portuguese 

“turfeiras” on the Internet. 

 

3.2.4.5 Wetland condition analysis 
 

The Table of evaluation is located in Appendix. The overall result obtained for the site is 

24.17 out of 25 which shows natural state of the bog and few disturbing factors with no need 

for active conservation actions.

3.2.5 LIFE+TRACHEMYS (Portugal) 

 

3.2.5.1 When, where and why 

 

The LIFE+Trachemys project on Demonstration strategy and techniques for the eradication of 

invasive freshwater turtles was implemented in Portugal (Algarve) and Spain (Valencia) in 

2011-2013 under the LIFE+Biodiversity initiative (CIBIO, 2013a). 

LIFE+ programme is a financial instrument for nature protection and conservation in the 

European Union which co-finances environmental initiatives in Member countries. The 

LIFE+Trachemys is included in the LIFE+Biodiversity section which is set to develop 

innovative techniques for the EU aim of “stopping biodiversity loss” (Generalitat Valenciana, 

2013). 

The main aim of the project, accoding to CIBIO, 2013a, was to address the issue of 

introduction of invasive exotic species, in particular, the negative environmental impacts on 

wetland environments and native freshwater turtle species of the European Pond Turtle Emys 

orbicularis and the Mediterranean turtle Mauremys leprosa from alien exotic turtle species, 

particularly the Red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans in the Mediterranean region, 

Spain and Portugal in particular (characterization of native and exotic species is in Chapter 

3.2.5, Appendix). These impacts have been as follows (CIBIO, 2013b): 

? Loss of aquatic biodiversity due to aggressive behavior of exotic turtle species (exotic 

turtle species are predators); 

? Fast breeding mechanism and aggressive behavior towards native turtle species; 

? Distribution of diseases in the aquatic habitats. 

 

The pet turtle trade began in 1970 when the first Trachemys scripta were caught to reproduce 

in captivity. At the same time the Ninja Turtles movie was shown on TV (1987-1996) which 

brought pet turtle sales to its maximum. The trade has led to a large number of specimens 

being maintained in captivity. It is estimated 26 million individuals were sold around the 

world in 1989-1994.  The pets were often released unthinkingly or even escaped by 

themselves into the wild. This could be caused by the lack of good conditions for keeping 

them (big size to which they can grow, aggressiveness, noise) or simply by annoyance from 

keeping animals for a long time since they can live for 40-50 years. Due to these releases, 

now Trachemys scripta can be encountered in rivers, lakes, parks and public gardens of 

Portugal as well as other European countries. Nowadays, Trachemys scripta is considered to 



130 

be a non-indigenous species with ecological risk in Portugal and one of the 100 most 

dangerous invasive exotic species in the world by the International Union for Conservation of 

Nature. In Portugal import of Trachemys scripta was forbiddem by Law in 1996, in 1999 

commercialization of the species was forbidden. However, the Law lacks measures of control 

and application of regulations which explains the fact that turtle trade and release are still a 

common practice in Portugal (CIBIO, 2013b). 

 

3.2.5.2 Project sites and institutions involved 

 

According to CIBIO (2013a), the project included 13 areas of action in Valencia and 4 areas 

in Portugal. The Portuguese sites were in Algarve – 4 lakes of Ria Formosa. Below the 

Portuguese project sites are shown (Figure 3.29). 

 

Figure 3.29 Project sites in Portugal: A – CIBIO and Biological park of Gaia, reception centre 

for the exotic turtles, B – RIAS, reception centre for the exotic turtles, 1, 2, 3, 4 – areas of 

action defined by the LIFE+ Trachemys project (CIBIO, 2013a) 

 

The institutions involved (CIBIO, 2013a): 

? The University of Porto and CIBIO-IETA, Centre of Investigation of Biodiversity 

and Genetic Resources belonging to the university, Institute of Agricultural and Food 

Sciences and Technologies, an NGO financing university research; 

? ALDEIA-RIAS – ALDEIA is an NGO working for sustainable development and nature 

conservation, with two centres of reception and recuperation of wild animals – CERVAS in 

Serra de Estrela Natural Park and RIAS in Ria Formosa Natural Park. The latter was one of 

the LIFE Trachemys reception centres; 



131 

?  Biological park of Gaia (Parque Biológico de GAIA) – a permanent centre of 

environmental education with the centres for recuperation of injured wild animals or those 

suffered from illegal captures; 

?  Generalitat Valenciana* - Department of Infrastructure, Territory and Environment of 

the Valencia Community Government, Ministry of Equipment, Planning and Environment – 

public institutions responsible for nature conservation issues, management of protected areas 

of Valencia; 

*various self-governmnet institutions under which the Spanish autonomous community of 

Valencia is politically organized; 

?  VAERSA – public entreprise of the Generalitat Valenciana carrying out studies on 

various environmental aspects, including the study on the autochthonous freshwater turtle 

species.  

 

3.2.5.3 What was planned to do: To develop a strategy in order to preserve aquatic 

endangered species of endemic fish and autochthonous freshwater turtles in Valencia and 

Algarve by eradicating wild populations of exotic invasive freshwater turtles, and then test 

efficiency of new methods of control and eradication of invasive species, reinforcement and 

conservation of native turtles (EU, 2011). 

The expected results for the project were set as follows, according to EU (2011): 

? development of standardized protocol methods and techniques for the eradication of exotic 

invasive freshwater turtle populations in wetlands; 

? implementation of the protocol in pilot areas (natural wetlands in Spain and Portugal); 

? demonstration of the viability and feasibility of new techniques for detecting nesting areas 

of exotic invasive freshwater turtle populations in wetlands; 

? collection of individual exotic turtles (mainly T. scripta) from 17 wetlands of Valencia and 

Portugal; 

? eradication of eggs of exotic turtles (mainly T. scripta) from 11 wetlands of Valencia and 

Portugal; 

? eradication of wild populations of exotic invasive freshwater turtles from 17 natural 

wetlands in Spain and Portugal; 

? production of a handbook about the eradication of exotic invasive freshwater turtle 

populations in wetlands;  



132 

? reinforcement of 10 populations of indigenous endangered freshwater turtles in Valencia 

and Portugal;  

? holding of an international seminar about the control of invasive exotic fauna in wetlands.  

 

3.2.5.4 Materials and methodology 

 

Trapping techniques and localization of traps 

 

During captures both passive (nasas with or without baits and fluctuating traps) and active 

(hand capture, collection with a shrimp catcher (camaroeiro in Portuguese)) techniques were 

used (CIBIO, 2013b). See Figures A93-A95, Appendix. 

As CIBIO (2013b) states, nasas were located next to the margins of the lakes with difficult 

access and low visibility to prevent robberies. 

Fluctuating traps were located in the deepest zones of the lakes where the biggest number of 

individuals was observed during rest and thermoregulation or where there were few places for 

that (Figure A96, Appendix). 

During the active working periods the nasas were checked every 2-3 days, the fluctuating 

traps – every week whereas in the winter it was done every 15 days. Hand capture and 

collection with a shrimp catcher were used in every possible case. All the project sites were 

regularly checked for nests of exotic species. If found, they were registered, opened, eggs and 

neonates removed from them. 

 

3.2.5.5 Management of captured individuals 

 

All the captured animals were identified and given a number. Natives were separated from 

exotic ones. Various measurements were made: length, width, weight, sex, maturity and other 

physical characteristics. Afterwards natives were released back into the wild in the places they 

were captured. Exotics, in case of Portugal, were transported to the reception centre of RIAS 

in Olhão and further transported to the Zoological Park KrazyWorld in Algoz (Parque 

Zoológico de Algoz) (CIBIO, 2013b). 

 

3.2.5.6 What was done 

 



133 

The results of the project including the captures will be represented for the Portuguese project 

sites. According to CIBIO (2013 a; b): 

? various capture methods were developed: different kinds of traps applied on the project 

sites, training of dogs for nest search carried out; 

? captures were performed not only on the project sites but also in public gardens thanks to 

the information spread. 

Field work was carried out by the team of 2 people regularly joined by volunteers who helped 

at the different stages. Besides, there was fruitful cooperation with the members of the above 

mentioned institutions and the ones responsible for management of the areas of action. 

? evaluation and monitoring of native freshwater turtle population; 

? epidemiological and molecular analysis of native species so that the situation at the 

national level could be understood and better conservation measures developed; 

? diverse environmental education activities carried out mainly in the areas next to the 

project sites in order to raise public awareness and prevent more releases of exotic turtle 

species into the wild; 

? International symposium on freshwater turtle conservation held in Vila Nova de Gaia, 

Portugal in May 2013. 

 

3.2.5.7 Results of captures: overall 

 

All in all, 299 individuals of exotic species and 6594 individuals of native species were 

captured during 3 years of the project. Nasas turned out to be the most efficient technique in 

native species capture whereas in exotic species capture hand capture was also very 

resultative (CIBIO, 2013 a; b). 

The results of the captures for each trapping technique are shown in Table ….

Results of captures: Exotic species 

 

According to CIBIO (2013b), 299 individuals of exotic species were captured on the project 

sites and in the public gardens: 94 % of them are Trachmeys scripta, 6 % - all the other exotic 

species (Figures A97-A98, Appendix).  

The most efficient methods of capture of exotics were the passive ones (60% of the captures, 

nasas – 41%, fluctuating traps – 19%). Hand capture – 25% of out-of-water individuals and 

collection with a shrimp catcher – 15% which was mostly used in the public gardens. It is 

important to note that hand capture has been extremely efficient to a big extent thanks to 

spread of information about the project and involvement of people from various organizations 

since there were a lot of cases when people brought the captured exotics to the field team. 

10 nests with 127 eggs were found in the area of Lagoa de São Lourenço. 

It should be noted that the numbers of captures of exotic species during 3 years, high in the 1
st
 

year and equally lower in the next ones, could be an evidence of ongoing eradication. What is 

more, the adults captured in 2012 and 2013 were mostly non-reproductive, the number of 

juveniles and neonates was also gradually decreasing. 

Furthermore, the captures and analysis helped to correct the area of Trachemys distribution 

which was adopted at the beginning of the project. It was revealed that a rather big part of its 

population is encountered in the surrounding areas of the project sites. 

The biggest number of captures of exotics was observed at Lagoa de São Lourenço (63,9%) 

which is an evidence of the fact that the lake was a point of introduction of exotic turtles and 

establishment of their population here. From here they spread to the adjacent areas which are 

proved by the high numbers of captures at Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul. 

As a result of the project, it is said the exotic turtle species have been eradicated from the 

lakes of the project and adjacent areas. Moreover, their numbers have substantially decreased 

in Lagoa de São Lourenço and Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul although the species are still 

observed there (Figures A99-A100, Appendix). These 2 sites are the most difficult at the task 

of complete eradication of the exotics since they are daily visited by people and can not be 

efficiently controlled. 

21 neonates and pregnant females found at the 2 lakes are a clear evidence of the fact that 

invasion of Trachemys scripta has been stopped. Further measures of control of nesting 

should be taken in the marginal zones of the lakes. 



135 

Results of captures: Native species 

 

? European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis 

 

As CIBIO (2013a) states, 342 individuals of Emys orbicularis were caught at the 4 project 

sites, 49 of which were pregnant females that were further transported to the installations of 

reproduction in captivity in RIAS and Biological Park of Gaia. 

Number of captures: The biggest numbers of captures are at Lagoa de São Lourenço and 

Lagoa da Quinta do Lago Sul where presence of exotic turtle species is more evident (Table 

A12, Appendix). Moreover, they are of a big size, with permanent character of water regime, 

constant abundance of alimentation and refuge which raises their capacity of being a suitable 

habitat for bigger numbers of turtle species. 

Proportion of sexes: Sex rate represents disequilibrium, with 1:0.80 male-female rate 

although the species is polygamy, so it would be more preferable and logical to have more 

female individuals. 

Age groups: Determination of age is a difficult task, thus, approximation by the dorsal 

longitude and weight is made. It is considered neonates are&amp;lt;40mm and&amp;lt;20gr, juveniles 

&gt;40mm&amp;lt;100mm, adults &gt;100mm. 

Adults are dominant in the structure of captures (76.8%), juveniles – 16.7%, neonates – 6.5%. 

It is important to note that the used type of traps (floating traps) complicates capture of 

neonates, so mostly all of them were caught by hand on the margins of the lakes. Their 

presence indicates that the species reproduces successfully. 

The results of captures per each lake are presented in Chapter 3.2.5, Appendix. 

 

? Mediterranean turtle Mauremys leprosa 

 

It was known that this species’ populations are extremely high in coastal Algarve lakes 

(CIBIO, 2013a). 

The results show high population density of Mauremys leprosa in the 4 action areas which 

confirms the above mentioned information. The biggest concentration is noticed in Lagoa das 

Dunas Douradas. Together with Lagoa do Garrão these locations show the smallest numbers 

of the exotic turtle species (Table A13, Appendix). So, there may be some connection 



136 

between the elevated number of Mauremys leprosa and the reduced number of Trachemys 

scripta. 

Moreover, numbers of males and females are in quite equilibrium, as well as numbers of 

adults and juveniles (CIBIO, 2013a). 

All in all, the results demonstrate that the species represents stable and healthy populations 

which guarantees their well-being at a short term. It can be concluded that effects of invasive 

exotic turtle species on the Mediterranean turtle are hardly seen or can not be felt yet. 

 

Discussion 

During the project it was seen, as expected, that the populations of Emys orbicularis are in a 

rather preoccupying situation, showing low density, ageing and fragmented character of 

distribution. 

In case of Mauremys leprosa, although the situation is much better and stable, there is still 

preoccupation about the influence of the exotic species on its populations. More informative 

conclusions could be obtained with long-term monitoring of the situation. 

It is important to understand that the data obtained are the first detailed description of real 

situation of native turtles´ populations in Portugal. Moreover, Algarve is one of the most 

favorable areas for both species. So, these data serve as a useful instrument and evidence of 

necessity for the conservation actions that could be taken in the future. 

All in all, the project has been not only a scientific initiative but a public environmental 

campaign. Besides efficient eradication actions in the Algarve freshwater lakes and analysis 

of the native turtles´ situation, the population has been educated on the issue of consequences 

of releases of the exotic species and opportunities of cooperation with the project centres 

(through communication with the research team, information borads set next to the project 

sites, tv news on the project). The project has been important for future research and 

conservation actions planned in the areas involved.

3.3 Sociological survey “Awareness about the wetland protected sites and their 

attractiveness for potential tourists” 
 

Goals of the survey 

 

The survey was carried out in Belarus and Portugal with the aim to evaluate the level of 

people’s awareness about wetland protected sites and their attractiveness for the participants 

as potential tourists. The data taken for evaluation were as follows: 

? general knowledge about the wetland protected sites; 

? awareness about wetlands (their various types: marshes, fens and bogs) as ecosystems and 

understanding of their functions, value;  

? knowledge about wetland protected sites, their role for nature and people, negative and 

positive aspects of their natur 

? e conservation and tourism activities; 

? knowledge about the thesis research sites (Sporava fen mire, Je?nia bog, Zvaniec fen mire, 

Paul de Arzila, Paul da Tornada, Paul do Boquilobo) and their activities; opinions on their 

nature conservation and tourism performance. 

The results of the survey are described in Chapter 4.1.  

 

  



138 

4 Results 

 

4.1 Sociological survey: Analysis of the results 

 

Participants of the survey – 51 Belarusians, 40 Portuguese; this number turned out to be 

sufficient for obtaining efficient results. 

1. By the type of activity among both countries’ participants prevail those not connected with 

nature conservation, tourism or environmental education (Figure 4.1). This was a desirable 

result since it provides a high possibility of getting the indicators of real awareness level 

about the research issues; 

 

Figure 4.1 Distribution of participants by the type of activity: a – Belarus, b – Portugal 

2. The question of the Belarusian survey “which protected areas would you advise for a visit 

to see Belarusian nature and which ones have you visited by yourself” has showed the 

knowledge about 23 protected areas.  

The most frequently mentioned areas are Bielavežskaja puš?a (the most ancient Belarusian 

and European forests), Biarezinski biosphere reserve, the research sites of Je?nia and 

Sporaúski. 

The similar question but focusing on the wetlands in the Portuguese survey “which wetlands 

do you know in Portugal” has produced 33 mentioned wetland protected areas.  

The most frequently mentioned are Ria Formosa, Tagus Estuary, Ria de Aveiro.  

The research sites Paul de Arzila, Paul da Tornada, Paul do Boquilobo are very rarely 

mentioned. 

Due to difference in the focus of the questions, it is difficult to compare the results 

quantitavely. However, the mention frequency of the research sites can be easily assessed 

(Figures A105-A106, Appendix). 



139 

Responses to a series of questions on territorial distribution of the country’s wetlands and 

their role and functions for nature and people have brought about the following results: for 

both Belarus and Portugal identical values of 58% aware and 42% not aware of the facts 

stated (Figure 4.2). 

 

Figure 4.2 Awareness of both Belarusian and Portuguese respondents about the territorial 

distribution of wetlands, their role and functions for nature and people 

 

All in all, the awareness level in this case can be generalized to being 50/50 in both countries 

which is a good result. 

 

3. The level of awareness about the thesis research sites and activities (nature conservation, 

tourism, educational) organized on them has been reflected in the following results:

To sum up the data from the above located figures, it must be said awareness about the 

research sites and activities organized is very high (average of 68%), Sporava and Je?nia being 

more known for the respondents than Zvaniec. 

Moreover, it is worth noting that among those not informed about Sporaúskija senakosy (hand 

mowing championship) in Sporava, Cranes and cranberries of Mijory land on Je?nia 80% and 

64% respectively would like to visit the events, thus, can be regarded as potential visitors of 

the research sites.

The average Portuguese awareness level about the research sites and conservation activities 

together is 32% which is a very low indicator. 

To compare, the Belarusian level of awareness about the research sites only is very high (82 

%, Sporava and Je?nia are the most known) which is almost equal to the Portuguese level of 

unawareness (77 %, Portuguese research sites are equally little known). Moreover, Belarusian 

responses have shown a high knowledge of the activities organized in the reserves. 

4. Final part of the results – responses to the questions on positive and negative aspects of the 

research sites´ activities (conservation, tourism, education), reasons and suggestions for 

improvement of their performance. In addition to the 3 Portuguese reserves, the same 

question was asked about the most frequently mentioned wetland site of Ria Formosa with 

expectation of more active responses. The results are shown in Table 4.1.

Additionally, there was a question of the Portuguese survey about all the continental Ramsar 

wetlands, whether know/visited or not, what respondents know about them and what would 

like to improve (Table 4.2). This can not be compared with any results of the Belarusian 

survey, so the information is given separately.

It is important to note that  the question for the Portuguese respondents about their opinion on 

the reasons for lack of conservation and educational projects in the wetland protected areas, 

lack of infrastructure, little information in English (both on the Internet and in the reserves) 

has shown the following responses: 

? lack of investment and difficulties of getting it; 

? bureaucracy in the country; 

? neglect of nature conservation and environmental education issues by the governmental 

authorities; 

? lack of environmental education projects for general population, schools, universities; 

? lack of involvement of students into nature conservation within their studies; 

? low level of people’s interest, motivation; 

? mentality.

? limitation of the use of resources, allowing for 
maintenance of natural features of the protected area. 

Historical 
aspect: 

wetlands’ 
formation 

and use 

All the 3 sites were formed as a result of 

postglacier shallow lakes existence and 

their filling with organic matter which 

then was gradually turning into peat.  

Later, in the 1950-80s the sites and (or) 

surrounding areas went through drainage 

(for agriculture, forestry and peat 

exctraction) and its further consequences. 

All the 3 sites were formed in the alluvial plains 

either representing remains of the past giant wetlands 

in the Mondego and Almonda floodplains (Paul de 

Arzila, Boquilobo) or former part of the sea covering 

the area (Paul da Tornada). 

In the 19-20
th

 century all the 3 marshes went through 

drainage for agricultural puproses and its further 

consequences. 

Uniqueness ? The biggest remaining in Europe 
complexes of mesotrophic and 

euthrophic fen mires (Sporava, Zvaniec) 

and raised peat bogs (Jenia) in a state 

close-to-natural; 

? Sporava, Zvaniec – key breeding sites 
of the globally threatened bird species of 

Aquatic Warbler (35% of the world 

population); 

? Je?nia – migrating stop-over for 
thousands of Cranes and Geese annually; 

? Important nesting sites for rare bird species such as 
Purple Heron, Iberian endemic species of 

amphibians; 

? Important wintering grounds, migrating stop-overs 
for a lot of bird species; 

? Important function of hydrological regulation for 
the surrounding areas and wetland landscape itself 



145 

? All 3 sites – rare bird species, plant 
communities; 

? Important function of CO2 regulation 
Current 
threats 

? Disturbance of the hydrological regime 
by the drainage canals and fishfarms; 

? Decrease of the groundwater level and 
overgrowth with trees and bushes 

(birches, willows, reeds); 

? Water pollution (agricultural, 
domestic, industrial); 

? Fires 

? Disturbance of the hydrological regime, disruption 
of water flow and its renovation; 

? Overgrowth with trees and bushes (willows and 
reeds) and displacement of natural vegetation; 

? Negative influence of invasive animal, plant 
species; 

? Domestic, industrial pollution; 
? Often unregulated fishing, hunting practices; 
? Absence of priority species for management; 
? Lack of conservation measures; 
? Lack of promotion of the sites for tourism 

Management ? Management units of the sites created 
for administration of the reserves; 

? Management Plans developed in the 
reserves since 2000s and regularly 

revised; 

? Administrations of the reserves 
responsible for management plan 

implementation; 

? Complex management concept: 
scientific research, vegetation and 

hydrological management (with an aim 

of restoration), ecotourism and 

environmental education as priorities for 

conservation actions; 

? Cooperation with local authorities, 
government, NGOs, volunteers, locals 

 

? Management Plans developed for each reserve: 
some of them regularly revised (Paul da Tornada), 

the other ones in the process of revision (Paul de 

Arzila); 

? Administrations of the reserves responsible for 
management plan implementation; 

? Paul da Tornada is managed by an environmental 
NGO and represents a positive example of NGO 

cooperation with local and regional authorities; 

? Conservation of natural values of the reserves but 
without an aim of habitat and hydrological regime 

restoration; 

? Tourism is not seen as a priority action (Paul de 
Azrila, Paul do Boquilobo); 

? Complex management concept: conservation of 
natural values, proper planning, conditions for 

ecotourism and environmental education (Paul da 

Tornada) 

? Cooperation with local authorities, NGOs, most 
efficient at Paul da Tornada; 

? Neglect of conservation issues by the government, 
lack of investment 

Nature 

conservation 

activities 

? Active conservation measures 
implemented since 1995: 

? Restoration of hydrological regime on 
Je?nia, Sporava and Zvaniec; 
? Habitat restoration / vegetation 
management in Sporava mire; 

? Biodiversity monitoring at all the sites; 
? Caretakers’ network functioning at the 
3 sites; 

? Use of best practices and international 
expert support in the projects, 

participation of volunteers (educational 

part); 

? Evidence of projects’ efficiency 
judging by the results: stop of fires on 

Je?nia, stop of draughts on Zvaniec, 
development of fishfarm regulations that 

take into acoount requirements of the 

Sporava reserve, restoration of the 

groundwater level, restoration of habitats 

and slowing down overgrowth with 

bushes and trees 

? Few conservation measures taken: 
Paul de Arzila 

? Bush removal, creation of open pools, 
reintroduction of Purple Gallinule in the 1990s; 

Paul do Boquilobo 

? Bird conservation projects in the past, current rare 
plant conservation project; water level control, soil 

analysis within cooperation with various educational 

institutions; 

? Permanent monitoring of fauna; 
? Current pollution problem resolvation within 
cooperation with Torres Novas municipality; 

Paul da Tornada 

? Reed cutting since 2011, monitoring of species, 
management of invasive species; 

? Scientific researches within cooperation with 
universities, enhancing internships for research; 

? Poor evidence of efficiency of conservation 
measures: the threats remain the same 



146 

Ecotourism ? Tourism facilities provided: infocentre 
(all 3), accommodation (Sporava and 

Zvaniec), trails and observation towers 

(Sporava – well-equipped, Je?nia – 
observation tower, trail under 

construction, Zvaniec - none), 

infoboards, booklets; 

? Educational part - excursions for 
schools; 

? Involvement of local population 
(caretakers); 

? Annual festivals (Je?nia, Sporava), 
volunteer camps (all 3); 

? Not active but increasing promotion of 
the sites for ecotourism mainly through 

birdwatching community, conservation 

projects; 

? Lack of information for foreigners on 
the Internet, no booklets in English; 

? Lack of signs within the reserve 

? Tourism facilities provided to a small extent: 
infocentres (all 3), trails (Paul de Arzila, Paul do 

Boquilobo – observation tower and trail equipped, 
Paul da Tornada – none, in the process of planning), 
information boards; 

? Excursions for schools; 
? Lack of awareness and involvement of local 
population; 

? Poor promotion of the sites, without any plan to 
increase it (Paul de Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo); 

? Active position in ecotourism promotion at Paul da 
Tornada (not many efficient results for now but good 

performance in planning); 

? Little information for foreigners, no booklets in 
English; 

? Lack of informative infoboards 

Water and 
peat quality 

? Water quality analysis (Je?nia, 
Sporava) has shown positive results for 

Je?nia and pollution evidence at Sporava 
(not exactly inside the mire, but around 

it); 

? Peat analysis has revealed normal ph 
values for the mires and bog which is the 

indicator of good conservation state of 

the landscapes. 

? Water quality analysis (all 3) has shown rather high 
pollution levels in the reserves resulting from the 

industrial, domestic pollution sources and lack of 

conservation measures; 

? There is a clear evidence of the ongoing penetration 
of pollutants into the marshes causing vegetation 

change due to overgrowth and landscape 

degradation. 

Public 

awareness 

average Belarusian level of awareness 

about the research sites is very high (82 

%, Sporava and Je?nia are the most 
known) 

average Portuguese awareness level about the 

research sites and conservation activities together is 

32% which is a very low indicator 

Overall 
performance 

All the 3 reserves show a positive nature 

conservation and tourism development 

performance:  

? researches have been done for 
determination of the most serious threats 

and their causes; 

? a complex approach to management 
has been applied (administrations of the 

reserves are the first result of productive 

cooperation between state and non-state 

entities, there were set aims of 

restoration of habitats and hydrological 

regime); 

? active conservation measures 
implemented regularly and efficient 

results reached; 

? conditions for ecotourism provided 
and improved regularly; 

? local population is involved; 
? promotion of the sites is carried out, 
public, educational, conservation events 

are held in the reserves regularly; 

? cooperation with NGOs, universities, 
local authorities and government has 

been established. 

Thus, there is a tendency of stable 

The 2 reserves (Paul de Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo) 

show a poor nature conservation and tourism 

development performance:  

? researches have been done for determination of 
necessary actions which were stated in the 

Management Plans; 

? an approach of conservation of natural values but 
without aim of restoration was taken as a basis; 

? due to lack of investment and neglect by the 
government few conservation measures have been 

implemented in the recent 20 years; 

? low sustainability of the projects implemented 
earlier, continuation of landscape degradation; 

? some conditions for ecotourism provided but not 
improved with the time; 

? local population is not involved; 
? promotion of the sites is almost absent, tourism is 
not seen as a priority; 

? cooperation with NGOs, universities, local 
authorities, but low. 

Paul da Tornada has shown a positive performance in 

various aspects such  as development of modern 

management concept and proper planning of actions: 

? conservation measures taken, monitoring of habitats 
planned but not conducted; 

? tourism facilities improved with time; 



147 

progressive development of the reserves 

as both centres of landscape conservation 

and ecotourism destinations. 

Moreover, efficient contacts have been 

built with various organisations. 

However, the reserves rely financially on 

foreign funds which makes them 

dependent on this type of funding and 

does not allow to plan for a long-term. 

? priorities of both conservation and 
ecotourism/education set; 

? regular control of the work done and actions revised 
but slow process of plan implementation; 

? lack of long-term investment; 
? low visible efficiency of the measures implemented 
by now. 

Thus, there is a tendency of stagnant development of 

the 2 reserves as both centres of landscape 

conservation and ecotourism destinations (Paul de 

Arzila, Paul do Boquilobo). 

However, there is a positive tendency of progressive 

but slow and difficult to foresee development of Paul 

da Tornada reserve. 

All the reserves face lack of governmental interest 

and financial support resulting in lack of people’s 
motivation for active work. 

 

The information obtained for each criteria can also be represented from the point of view of 

similarities/differences between the research sites of 2 countries. This allows to obtain a 

clearer view on the results of the research. The information is shown in Table 4.4.

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
 

A multilateral research on the issue was carried out in the process of writing the thesis. 

Methodology was developed to conduct the analysis of each research site. The objectives set 

at the beginning of the work were met. Both theoretical and practical aspects of the wetland 

sites performance were studied. All the sites were visited personally and contacts with the 

administration members were established to get the information on current development of 

the reserves from the direct source.  

The characterization of the research sites was complex and balanced and served as a reliable 

basis for the consequent comparative analysis. It allowed to evaluate their nature conservation 

performance rather efficiently. However, the author understands that the information analysed 

and the results obtained  can only partially reflect the realities of the site since it is hard to 

make a really thruthful evaluation of the 7 wetland sites from the point of view of the student 

researcher and after a seven-month work. Moreover, biological aspects of the wetland 

development were especially difficult to describe since the author does not have a degree in 

this field, that is why studies, instructions and opinions of various experts were often used for 

the work, detailed questions were posed to the administration members of the reserves. The 

work was planned not as a biological research but as a multilateral analysis of various aspects 

of nature conservation performance of the research sites.  

What is more, positive experience of the Portuguese sites was meant to be obtained for the 

Belarusian practices in wetland conservation. This aim has been partially implemented since 

Belarusian examples turned out to be more successful than the Portuguese ones by their long-

term efficiency. However, the information obtained during the research served for the 

understanding of both countries’ realities in the field of wetland conservation and analysis of 

various approaches that can be applied to the research sites. 

To sum up, general level of awareness about the wetland protected areas among Belarusian 

and Portuguese participants of the survey can be assessed as 50/50 which is a rather positive 

indicator. 

However, awareness about the wetland research sites of the thesis, their value and 

projects/activities organised is rather high in Belarus and very low in Portugal. This can be 

explained by the fact that mire (fens and bogs) conservation in Belarus has been a priority for 

the recent 20 years, is very active and efficient at the level on nature conservation, education 

and tourism, whereas in Portugal the level of investment and focus on such areas is much 

lower. 



150 

The survey has shown drawbacks of the reserves’ performance in both countries: lack of 

infrastructure, lack of investment (Portugal), inefficient information distribution and 

promotion, landscape degradation and lack of conservation projects (Portugal), passiveness of 

the reserves’ administration and neglect by local and state authorities. 

*The survey can be assessed as efficient judging by its results but in the process of the 

analysis it was observed that a more precise form of the questions and their goals is needed to 

receive better results. This could be corrected in the further work and possibly the conduct of 

the second more detailed survey on the issue. 

The comparative analysis conducted as a result of the work on each wetland site brought 

about the following conclusions: 

? the history of wetlands’ formation has been different but further history of their use, 

disturbance by man and the consequences is rather similar; 

? protection statuses of “zakaznik” and “reserva” are similar by the objectives of their 

creation and development but the Belarusian one poses fewer limitations, thus providing 

space for active nature conservation activities. The Portuguese regulations for the reserve 

focus on complete limitation of the use of resources and human intervention of any type 

through zoning which is not present in Belarus; 

? by the factor of uniqueness, the Belarusian sites show more outstanding features whereas 

the Portuguese ones turn out to be less attractive by their natural values due to their 

progressive degradation, loss of unique flora and fauna, and passive conservation and tourism 

development (difficult access to observation points); 

? by the threats, the reserves have shown similar biological factors of disturbance which 

result from the past human alteration but their influence and scope are different, much less in 

Belarus due to active conservation measures taken, whereas in Portugal these factors have 

progressed further to the negative side; 

? by management Belarusian sites are characterized by a complex management concept 

based on sustainability principles (management units created in the reserves, nature 

conservation, involvement of local people, cooperation with local and governmental 

authorities, NGO). Although in Portugal all the sites are also under control of their 

administrtions, 1 site (Paul da Tornada) has shown the complex approach to management 

focused on environmental education and 2 other sites are characterized by the lack of high 

quality management, especially in the field of nature conservation activities; 



151 

? by nature conservation and ecotourism activities, the Belarusian sites have shown 

activeness and efficient results in the recent 20 years (restoration of habitats, hydrological 

regime, raising public awareness and attractiveness for potential tourists) whereas in Portugal 

the 2 sites do not show efficient results of conservation or restoration due to lack of 

conservation measures and neglect of ecotourism potential, and 1 site with environmental 

NGO administration has shown positive planning of both conservation and 

ecotourism/education actions and their slow but progressive implementation; 

? however, there were observed similar problems in ecotourism development such as lack of 

promotion, information borads and signs in the reserves of both countries; 

? by the level of public awareness about the wetlands in general and the research sites in 

particular, Belarus has shown a much higher result than Portugal which can be explained by 

the active conservation and ecotourism development practices and their promotion in Belarus 

in the recent 20 years, and lack of public informing and involvement in the reserves’ 

initiatives nd plans; 

? approaches to freshwater wetland conservation in Belarus and Portugal have turned out to 

be different by their priority aims: restoration of habitats and hydrological regime, ecotourism 

promotion in Belarus and conservation of natural values without obligatory restoration of 

habitats and hydrological regime, just prevention from further degradation in Portugal; 

? the Belarusian wetlands have shown a much better performance both in nature 

conservation and separately in ecotourism development if to judge from the point of the 

Belarusian approach to wetland conservation. Even judging from the Portuguese one, the 

Portuguese sites have not succeded in prevention of landscape degradation but 2 of them have 

shown stangnancy and passiveness in their development, 1 site has done proper analysis and 

planning of actions which are slowly implemented by the environmental NGO.  

The focus of the problem in Portugal is usually put on lack of investment which is difficult to 

get but, from the author’s point of view, motivation and interest of the authorities, both local 

and governmental, and employees of the protected areas play a significant role. What is more, 

local initiatives of sites’ administrations that do not require a lot of funds are also a solution. 

Belarusian research sites also face lack of governmental interest and dependency on foreign 

financial support but motivation and enthusiasm of the people involved, and properly planned 

management schemes are key factors of ongoing progress which allow to get over the 

bureaucratic and financial barriers. 



152 

However, the author clearly understands that the difference in the performance of the wetland 

sites in 2 countries has been caused not only by the above mentioned factors but by the 

general economic conditions and governmental policies of the countries as well as by the 

historical preconditions of the current approaches to wetland conservation. 

Thus, the present thesis has allowed the author to get valuable experience in the research of 

wetland sites of Belarus and Portugal, expand the view on wetland conservation methods, 

participate in the ongoing conservation projects and present the results of the comparative 

analysis in the work.

Water quality analysis 

 

Water is said to be seriously polluted in the Jasie?da River and, thus, in the area of 
Sporava mire due to industrial and domestic sewage from Biaroza and previous 

pollution from Sialiec fishfarm which is now regulated.  

There has been no information on water quality indicators exactly for the Sporava mire. 

However, there is information on the water quality analysis of the Prypia? and its 
affluents made in 2010. 

So, there were observed elevated values of phosphorus-phosphates (P-PO5) and 

nitrogen-ammonia (N-NH4) in the area of the Jasie?da River near Sporava mire. 
Moreover, N-NH4 have increased by 14.5% and 31% respectively since 2006. The 

values obtained in 2008 were 1.2-2.9 MAC for NH4, 1.1-3.6 for N-NO2, MAC – 
maximum acceptable concentration. This is an evidence of permanent pollution in the 

past and present which has severe consequences for the Sporava mire as a landscape and 

habitat. 

What is more, the Jasie?da River gets 10 thousand m3 of sewage every day which 90% 
of the regional indicator. Wastewater treatment plant in the area of the mire does not yet 

function properly although construction and repair works have been conducted for a 

long period of time. 

 

Peat analysis 

 
Analysis of peat was made through analysis of peat ph values from 2010 research data 

and assessment of von Post Decomposition Index. 

Peat ph in Sporava mire, since it is a fen mire, must be weakly acidic, neutral or weakly 

alkaline: it gets minerals (N, K, P) from the groundwater and is nutrient-rich, its ph is 

usually 5.5-8. 

The 2010 research data results show the 3 following ph values for peat: 5.51, 5.72, 5.56 

with an average of 5.60. 

The values obtained are in the normal range for fen mires showing that peat is weakly 

acidic which means it does not reflect any eutrophication processes caused by drainage 

and discharge of pollutants into the Jasie?da River. This can further mean that either 
peat will show more “alkaline” values in the future due to ongoing accumulation or the 
pollution levels are very low. 

 

Von Post Decomposition Index is H4 – weakly decomposed: plant structure still 
distinct, yields strongly turbid water, no peat substance passes between fingers, residue 

rather mushy.

Water quality analysis 

 

In June 2013 there were conducted field measurements of chemical characteristics of 

water by taking water samples near 10 previously installed sensors. The research was 

conducted after the period of high precipitation, thus, for the accuracy of the results, it 

makes sense to repeat the measurements in the midperiod of average precipitation.  

The following parameters were measured during the research: 

? Conductivity; 
? Ph; 
? Groundwater level, 
? Mineralization; 
? Oxidability; 

These are the obtained research results for 11 research points: 

 

Water quality indicators 

 

 
  

The values obtained allow us to make the following conclusions: 

? Hydrochemical parameters are in the normal range typical of Belarusian bogs 
(low mineralization, low conductivity, strongly acidic); 

? The highest values of mineralization are for points 1, 2, 3 which correspond with 
the disturbed parts of the Du?ski canal, and for point 6 in the south of the 
reserve; 

? Ph values are at their highest limit for bogs; 
? Oxidability is the highest at the bog edges which is explained by the fact that 

there is a higher water flow in those areas. 

The analysis of groundwater level at various locations proves that there are areas that 

show a rather high level of disturbance (-10, -15 cm on average) which is a clear 

evidence of negative consequences of the past human activities. However, dam 

construction contributed to rise of the groundwater level and restoration of the 

hydrological regime of the bog. 

 

Peat analysis 

 

Analysis of peat was made through analysis of peat ph values from 2010 research data 

and assessment of von Post Decomposition Index. 

Peat ph in Je?nia bog, since it is a raised bog, must be strongly acidic: absence of 
alkaline components from the organic material, precipitation prevails over evaporation,

anthropogenic factors (deposition of acidic pollutants from the atmosphere), peat is 

nutrient-poor, its ph is usually 3-4. 

The 2010 research data results show the 3 following ph values for peat: 3.0, 2.9, 3.07 

with an average of 2.99. 

The values obtained are in the normal range for bogs which means peat is very acidic 

and does not reflect any evidence of its deterioration due to disturbance of hydrological 

regime. 

 

Von Post Decomposition Index is has been measured for 3 locations: 

? Lake Bielaje – H5 – moderately decomposed: plant structure still clear but 
becoming indistinct, yields much turbid brown water, some peat escapes 

between fingers, residue very mushy; 

? 300 m from the drainage canal – H4 – weakly decomposed: plant structure 
distinct, yields strongly tubid water, no peat passes between fingers, residue 

rather mushy; 

? Lake Kurhanistaje (between the tussocks) – H1 – undecomposed: plant structure 
unaltered, yields only clear colourless water.

Peat analysis 

Analysis of peat was made through analysis of peat ph values from 2009 research data 

and assessment of von Post Decomposition Index. 

Peat ph in Zvaniec mire, since it is a fen mire, must be weakly acidic, neutral or weakly 

alkaline: it gets minerals (N, K, P) from the groundwater and is nutrient-rich, its ph is 

usually 5.5-8. 

The 2009 research data results show the 3 following ph values for peat: 5.80, 5.70, 5.70 

with an average of 5.73. 

The values obtained are in the normal range for fen mires and show that the peat in 

Zvaniec mire is weakly acidic which does not serve as any evidence of drainage 

consequences and disturbance of hydrological regime of the mire. This means that the 

ecosystem has had the resources to protect itself and prevent severe degradation. 

 

Von Post Decomposition Index is H4 – weakly decomposed: plant structure distinct, 
yields strongly turbid water, no peat substance passes between fingers, residue rather 

mushy.

Water quality analysis 

 
Water quality analysis has been carried out with the help of two information sources: 

the research of 1999 and the 2011 the data of the National System of Information on 

Hydrological Resources. Therefore, it consists of two parts: the one with the 1999 

results and the other with the 2011 data. 

 

Part 1 
The 1999 research was on control of vegetation expansion in the marshes of the Lower 

Mondego, and in particular, on improvement of habitat management for aquatic birds in 

Paul de Arzila. 

 

There were chosen 8 sampling points in the area of the paul. They are shown on the map 

below (Figure A55). 



62 

 

 
Figure A55. Sampling points in the Paul de Arzila 

 

1 – Ribeira da Malga – the point of release of two effluents from the industries of the 
region – one on meat production and the other on ceramics production (which is now 
terminated). Thus, potentially the most polluted point; 

2 – Ribeira de Cernache – located next to the village of Sobreiro which is subjected to 
agricultural and domestic pollution; 

3 – Ponte de Melhora – the point where two principal water lines of the River Cernache 
meet, subjected to agricultural, industrial and domestic pollution; 

4 – Vala dos Moinhos (Casal das Figueiras) – entrance to the reserve, just on the border 
of the paul, agricultual and domestic pollution; 

5 – Vala do Meio – Casal das Figueiras – next to Vala dos Moinhos, one of the three 
ditches in the paul, agriculture is the main pollutant; 



63 

 

6 – Vala da Costa (Casal das Figueiras) – subjected to agricultural pollution, its waters 
directly enter the paul; 

7 – Dique (dam) – located at the exit from the paul being an important point to compare 
the water quality entering and leaving the area; 

8 – Vala dos Moinhos – exit, is not located within the reserve. 
 

Thus, points 1, 2, 3 are located in the long distance from the paul, 4, 5, 6 are at the 

entrance to the paul, and 7,8 are at the exit. 

 

The samples were taken monthly during the year of 1999. The following parameters 

were assessed at each point: ph, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, nitrates, 

phosphates, ammonia. 

 

  



64 

 

Results 
 

Ph – ph values vary during the year identically for all the points except for point 1 
(Ribeira da Malga) and point 7 (Dique) which have the lowest values due the certain 

level of industrial pollution (point 1) and circulation difficulties (point 7) due to 

opening/closing of the gates. However, the values are not critically bad, they are in 

normal range of 7-8 (Figure A56). 

 
Figure A56. Ph values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila 



65 

 

Dissolved O2 – seasonal variations at all the points (the higher the temperature the less 
oxygen it contains and vice versa), the highest values registered in the raining season 

when the water flow is at its maximum. 5 mg/l is considered to be a minimum normal 

level. Points 1, 7, and 8 have the lowest values which can mean there are pollutants 

accumulated in the water and causing poor O2 saturation (Figure A57). 

 
Figure A57. Dissolved oxygen values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de 

Arzila 



66 

 

Conductivity – highest in the summer when the temperatures are high and the water 
flow is low. Normal level range is 200-1000 us/cm. Point 1 again has the highest values 

due to the certain pollution level (Figure A58). 

 
Figure A58. Conductivity values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila 



67 

 

Quantity of nutrients (ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates) – Figures A59-A62.  
Nitrates normal range is less than 5 mg/l – all the points show positive values, except 
for single higher than 5 mg/l values at points 2 and 3 in June; 

Phosphates normal range is less than 0.54 mg/l – very high values (with maximum 
value of 3 mg/l) during all the year at point 1; 

Ammonia normal range is less than 0.10 mg/l – higher than normal at points 1, 3, 5, 7, 
point 1 having maximum value of  2 mg/l. 

Point 1 values reflect high level of accumulated pollutants whereas at other points the 

values are mostly in a normal range, with seasonal variations.

Figure A62. Ammonia values at the sampling points in the area of Paul de Arzila 

 

It is therefore obvious that except for point 1, water indicators for the other points in the 

paul particularly do not have the evidence of serious deterioration because of the nearby 

pollutants. Moreover, as for 1999, the values at distance points and at the entrance to the 

paul are far worse than at the exit from the paul (Figures A63-A64).  



71 

 

 
Figure A63. Phosphates levels at the entrance and exit from the Paul de Arzila 

 

 
Figure A64. Nitrogen compounds levels at the entrance and exit from the Paul de Arzila 

 

Anyway, probably evidence of accumulation is only a question of time since there is 

another non-quantative evidence of pollution such as emergent vegetation of reedbed, 

willow which means pollutants have been accumulating and causing extremely active 

vegetation growth and accumulation of organic material and its decomposition, which 

further means water eutrophication and wetland habitat transformation into a forest 

land. What is more, the above described values are the results of the 1999 research, 

further analysis of the 2011 data will be very helful since it will provide an opportunity 

of comparison and making a more sensible conclusion on the aspect of water quality 

degradation in Paul de Arzila. 

 

Part 2 
The National Information System on Hydrological Resources provides information on 

two sampling points – point 3 (Ponte de Melhora) from the previous research and one 
point next to the village of Lameira de Baixo and Vala dos Moinhos, called Arzila, in 

the middle part of the paul. Thus, we have one point next to the pollution sources and 



72 

 

the other directly in the paul. We will compare all the parameters of these 2 points with 

one another and with the values of the same points in 1999*. 

 

*Ponte Melhora is the same point in 1999 and 2011 data. Arzila point of 2011 is to the 

north of Vala dos Moinhos of 1999 but they are both inside the paul, not in a long 

distance and disturbed by the same factors, thus they can be taken for comparison. 

 

Results 
Table A10. Water quality indicators 

1999  2011 

 

 
 

 
The ph values have remained in the same normal value range during 1999-2011. 

 
 

 

 

 
The ph range has remained in the similar range.  

 

The ph values have stayed almost the same at both points. This does not give enough information for assessment of pollution 

levels. 



73 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The levels of dissolved oxygen at Arzila have stayed in the same range of poor saturation, have not changed seriously.

Dissolved oxygen levels at Ponte Melhora have stayed in the same range of moderate saturation, although in 1999 there were 

more higher than 100 values. 

 

The oxygen levels have not changed much at both points, only Arzila point is far less saturated than Ponte de Melhora which 

can be the evidence of ongoing pollution which has been penetrating into the paul itself. 

 

 

 
Conductivity levels at Arzila have not changed much during 1999-2011. There were elevations in 2003-2004, 2006, 2008-2010 

but this paramter does not seem to reflect any siginificant change. 

 

 

 



75 

 

Conductivity values at Ponte Melhora have not changed much if compare 1999 and 2011 values there was observed a 

significant increase in 2002-2004 and 2006-2009 which reflects an elevation in pollution levels. 

 

There are no big changes between conductivity levels in 1999 and 2011 but there were periods of serious elevations of its values 

which can mean increase in pollution levels. 

 

 

 
There has been an increase in nitrates levels at Arzila from a range of 0.3-3.9 to the one 6-15 which is a drastic change and 

evidence of serious pollution of the area. Unfortunately, there are no results on the levels development in the years of 2000 -

2010 but today’s results show habitat deterioration inside the paul without any measures having been taken. 

 

 
 

 
The level of nitrates at Ponte Melhora has increased from the range of 2.5-7 to 5-15 which is a drastic change and possible 

consequence of uncontrolled pollution. 

 

The nitrates levels at the 2 points were in different ranges in 1999 but evened dramatically by 2012. This can be the evidence of 

ongoing pollution which has now reached the paul itself and still no measures have been taken to put it under control. 



76 

 

 
 

 

 
Figure 111. 

Phosphate levels at Arzila have experienced an increase in their values in 1999-2011 from a range of 0.01-0.14 to 0.10-0.40. 

Unfortunately, there are no results for the years of 2000-2010 but it is important to note that there has been a drastic increase in 

phosphates in 2012, values reaching its possible maximum which can be an evidence of high amount of nutrients in the water 

and its quality being very poor not only outside the paul but already inside the paul. 

 

 
 

 
There has been an increase in phosphates levels at Ponte Melhora, from the range of 0.05-0.4 to the one of 0.10-0.50. Moreover, 

there have been elevations till critical levels of 0.9 in 2012. All this proves high speed of pollution penetration inside the paul. 

 

In 1999 the phosphates levels at the 2 points were in different ranges, Ponte Melhora having much higher values which was 

normal sicne it is closer to pollution sources. In 2011 these ranges became the same with an increase for Arzila point. Moreover, 

a drastic elevation in 2012 was observed at both points, with a time difference of 6-7 months, Ponte Melhora being obviously 

the first to have it. All this can be the consequence of an ongoing pollution which has not been put under control. 



77 

 

 
 

 
Increase in ammonia level at Arzila has been observed in 1999-2011, with drastic elevations in 2001-2003, 2005-2008 and 

values in a normal range in 2011. However, this is a clear evidence of active continuous pollution penetration into the paul.  

 

 

 
Increase in ammonia levels at Ponte Melhora has been observed, with drastic elevations in 2001-2003 ans 2010-2012 which is a 

proof of high pollution levels. 

 
There can be easily observed almost identical increases in ammonia levels during 1999-2011 at the 2 points, with a time 
difference of 1-2 months between them, Ponte Melhora being the first to experience elevations and Arzila being the second. 

Thus, the pollution processes are obvious and deepening, penetrating into the paul. Now not only expansive vegetation growth 

is an indicator of pollution but the parameters themselves.There is also a clear evidence of absence of any activities on 

conservation of the paul and efforts to decrease the pollution levels.

Overall water quality – there is a EU classification of water quality into 5 types: high, 
good, moderate, poor, and bad (accordingly blue, green, yellow, orange and red 

colours). The final judgment on the water quality type is made on the basis of 

assessment of several physiochemical parameters.  

Arzila 

 
Figure A65. Overall water quality at Arzila 
 

Ponte de Melhora 

 
Figure A66. Overall water quality at Ponte Melhora 
 

Judging by these tables, water quality at Arzila inside the paul has been worse than that 

at Ponte Melhora where water is supposed to be more polluted due to the nearby 

industries. This could mean that comparing with 1999 research pollutants have 

penetrated further down the river flow, right into the paul, and now are visible in 

parameters’ values.

To conduct water quality analysis for Paul da Tornada data from SNIRH were taken. 

There were no more information accessible or given to me at the reserve.

The conductivity values had been in normal range until 1999 when they started to get 

higher than maximum acceptable 1000. This could mean the rise in pollutants level in 

the marsh. 

 

Phosphates

P2O5 level has always been in green-to-red range of values, having reached its 

maximums in 1989-1993, 2005-2008. This can be the evidence of pollutants 

accumulated in the paul. 

 

Ammonia 

 
Figure A77. Ammonia levels 

Ammonia levels have been increasing with time, its values being in the green-to-red 

range since 1990 and reaching its maximum in 2007. This, similar to P2O5, can indicate 

accumulation of pollutants in the water. 

 

Nitrates

Nitrates values have always been in the green range, showing not maximum high but 

moderately high levels. This, similar to phosphates and ammonia, seems to prove the 

facvt of the ongoing pollution of the paul.

Water quality analysis 

 

Analysis I 

 
During the preparation process of the 2008 Management Plan there was conducted 

water quality analysis at 5 points of the reserve which showed that at the 2 points of the 

Total Protection Zone (Braço Cortiço and Claros) water quality is the best, next by the 

quality level go the River Almonda to the north and south of the paul, and Vala da 

Perreira.  

The River Almonda sampling point revealed elevated levels of nitrites and nitrates with 

low levels of oxidizability.  

Vala de Perreira has serious pollution levels. It connects the paul with the upstream 

villages and has high levels of ammonia, phosphates, low levels of dissolved oxygen 

and evidence of fecal contamination.  

 

However, it was stated that none of the sites, including the first 2 ones, satisfied the 

requirements of water quality for life support of animal species. High levels of nutrients 

are evidence of eutrophication processes ongoing in the paul. 

 

Analysis II 

 
In 2006-2007 there was a research study on sampling microinverterbrates and assessing 

water quality in the paul.  

Microinvertebrates are an indicator group for evaluation of water quality: they were 

sampled and Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) indicator was determined. 

It turned out to be 58 in the range of 36-60 which corresponds with Contaminated 

Waters in the evaluation table. 

 

Water samples were taken every 15 days from November 2006 till June 2007 at two 

points – Braço do Cortiço and Ponte do Rio Almonda (Ponta Nova), the first of them is 
right in the centre of Total Protection Area, next to the observatory, the second one is 

next to the Interpretation Centre in the northern part of the reserve, at the entrance to 

Quinta do Paul. The difference between them is in location and waterflow speed, at 

Braço do Cortiço the current is weak, the river widens there, whereas at Ponte the water 

current is fast. The sampling sites are shown on the map below (Figure ). 



97 

 

 
Figure A86. Sampling points at Paul do Boquilobo: BC - Braço do Cortiço, PN – Ponta 
Nova 
 

The samples were used to determine phosphate, nitrate and chlorophyll levels. 

The 2006-2007 results will be compared with the information obtained from SNIRH. 

For Braço Cortiço information only on 1999-2005 is available, whereas for Ponta Nova 

there are 1988-2012 results.

0.42 mg/l. This means that 2006-2007 were one the peaks of P 

values but still its levels are high. 

P levels at Braço de Cortiço have turned out to decrease with time to the normal range values (from 0.55 mg/l in 1999-2004 to 0.23 mg/l 

in 2006-2007) whereas the Ponta Nova values have been permanently out of the normal range, 2 times higher (0.42 mg/l with peaks of 

1.03 mg/l in 2006-2007). This can result from the fact that that Ponta Nova is outside the paul and pollution from the nearby industries 

and agricultural practices is more visible here, whereas inside the paul, at Braço de Cortiço, waterflow is weak and nutrients are 

accumulating over time and either will be more visible in the future years or they are consumed by phitoplancton which is t here in great 

amounts. 

Chlorophyll 

 
 

47.4, 132.4. 3709.5 ug/l 35.9, 70.4, 178.6 ug/l 

Chlorophyll values at Braço Cortiço are each higher than the ones at Ponta Nova which can be explained by the fact that the first point is 

part of a more closed system with weak waterflow and bigger amount of phytoplancton. Green colour of water at both points is an 

evidence of eutrophication due to pollution and invasion of water hyacinth. 

Phosphates 

 
Phosphates levels are much higher at Ponta Nova (at Braço Cortiço they are in the normal range, at Ponta Nova reaching critical values) 

which confirms the hypothesis about the ongoing pollution and its accumulation in the paul still not visible in PO5 values inside it but 

already seen at the site outside the paul. It is important to note that the values at the 1
st
 point are from 1999-2005 whereas Ponta Nova has 

the latest values, so, there is a possibility of PO5 levels at Braço Cortiço already being much higher.  



99 

 

Nitrates 

  
Nitrates levels have the same trend as phosphates, except for the values not being in the critical range, confirming the sensibility of the 

above mentioned idea. 

Ammonia 

  

 
Ammonia levels at Ponta Nova are much higher than those at Braço Cortiço, although both points show values out of the normal range, 

which, if to take into account the accumulative feature of wetlands, can mean that current values inside the paul (Braço Cortiço) can be 

much higher. 

Conductivity 

  
Average conductivity levels at 2 points are in the normal range, only in some periods at Braço Cortiço being higher than normal but that 

can not be exact proof of pollution. 

Dissolved O2 

  
Oxygen saturation is very low at both points with values lying within green-orange range which can be the evidence of eutrophication of 

the area which in its turn proves that the paul suffers from ongoing pollution, drainage consequences and bad water renovation system. 



100 

 

Ph 

  
Ph levels are in the normal range. 

Overall water quality 

  
General tables are good to verify the above mentioned conclusions. Both points show poor water quality absolutely confirming the 

information about ongoing natural (consequences of artificial) processes in the paul. The water quality at Braço Cortiço by this table 

results is even worse than the one at Ponta Nova.

Chapter 3.2.4 
 

The peat bogs in Portuguese mountains (Serra de Estrela, Peneda-Geres) are often 

degraded due to active unsustainable use for pastures, excessive spread of nutrients that 

is why they are subjected to conservation measures such as construction of barriers for 

cattle, restoration of natural hydrology through construction of dams. These 

conservation measures have been implemented by Quercus NGO through creation of a 

biological micro-reserve (one of the 3 at the moment) in the mountaneous peat area of 

Serra da Freita by prohibition of all non-scientific activities, control of fertilizers use, 

vehicles, pastures.

Key features of the native and exotic turtle species 
 

1. Exotic species 
 

Pond Slider Trachemys scripta – the most popular pet turtle in the world. It is native in 
the east of the United States and adjacent areas in the northeast of Mexico. This species 

has been released into the wild everywhere in the world. It is well-known in Europe due 

to its invasion into freshwater ecosystems, although in other regions of the world its 

distribution is not known. 

It has 3 subspecies: the most common is Red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans, 

then goes Yellow-eared slider Trachemys scripta scripta and Cumberland slider 

Trachemys scripta troosti.  

 
Figure A91. Subspecies of Trachemys scripta 
 

The species is omnivorous with a rich diet (from insects and other invertebrates to 

amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds) and represents a great capacity of 

dispersion through the freshwater channels, travelling long distances on land and getting 

over various barriers. Thus, it is a good survivor. Moreover, it is characterized by high 

competitiveness for alimentation, thermoregulation places and nesting sites. This feature 

arises from the early sexual maturity age, high fertility, bigger size and aggressiveness if 

compared to the native species. What is more, Trachemys scripta is capable of 

spreading diseases and parasites which can affect the native turtles, aquatic animals and 

even humans. 

 

Other exotic species 
Unfortunately, trade of other exotic turtle species is permitted in Portugal. These ones 

can be encountered in pet shops: 

 
Figure A92. From left to right: River cooter Pseudemys concinna, Florida Redbelly 

Turtle Pseudemys nelsonii, False map turtle Graptemys pseudogeographica 
 



107 

 

Besides the fact that the species are legally sold to public, they possess the same 

competitive-aggressive characteristics as Trachemys scripta. Thus, if released into the 

wild, they are able to cause the same negative impacts on the environment. 

 

2. Native species 
 
European Pond Turtle Emys orbicularis – the smallest freshwater turtle in Europe. 
Endangered species in Portugal, rarely encountered on the Iberian Peninsula, its 

populations are small and isolated. More easily found in the basins and lakes of the 

southern Portugal. 

Its number has significantly decreased in the last 100 years due to habitat alteration and 

destruction (paludal landscapes), intentional catches and introduction of exotic species. 

Moreover, the species is rather fragile, sexual maturity of females is late which causes 

low fertility rates together with high infant mortality rates, and further brings low 

population growth and reduced recuperation ability of the species especially in case of 

negative impacts such as exotic species introduction. 

Mediterranean Turtle Mauremys leprosa – the biggest freshwater turtle in Europe. 
Quite common in Portugal (Least concern status of protection), its biggest populations 

are found on the Iberian Peninsula. Well spread to the south of the River Tagus in 

Portugal. Encountered populations are usually of a high density although there has been 

noticed reduction of the distribution area due to extinction of the certain populations. 

Factors of disturbance are the same as for Emys orbicularis. Illegal captures for trade or 

using for alimentation have become the most serious threat to this species. Exotic 

species are also a threat although Mauremys leprosa is much stronger and more flexible 

in terms of survival than Emys orbicularis.

Analysis of the results per each lake 
Lagoa do Garrão 
6 traps (´nasas´ in Portuguese) were placed in 2011, evenly distributed in the lake to get 

the real density of the species; 

In 2012 traps were removed due to complete drought of the lake during the whole 

period of captures; 



112 

 

In 2013 the water level stabilized and 3 new traps were placed in the lake. The 

distribution of traps is shown in the figure below. 

 
Figure A101. A – localization of traps in Lagoa do Garrão during 2011; B – localization 
of traps in Lagoa do Garrão during 2013 
 

The number of recaptures (46) compared to the number of captures (22 individuals) is a 

high indicator which shows that there is a high probability the number of captured Emys 

orbicularis is close to their real quantity. 

Capture of only one juvenile is a worrying result since deficit of juveniles can have 

serious consequences for renewal of the population. However, capture of 2 pregnant 

females is a positive fact which can mean that the low number of captured juveniles can 

result from abundant vegetation in the lake being a good refuge for the species and from 

the type of traps used. 

 

Lagoa das Dunas Douradas 
6 nasas and 6 fluctuating traps were placed in the lake in 2011; 

In 2012 due to a drastic fall of the water level 3 nasas and all the fluctuating traps were 

removed, with only 3 nasas left; 

In 2013 due to the still low water level 3 nasas remained in the lake, no more traps were 

place there. The distribution of the traps is shown in the figure below. 

 
Figure A102. A – localization of traps in Lagoa das Dunas Douradas during 2011; B – 
localization of traps in Lagoa das Dunas Douradas during 2012 and 2013 

 



113 

 

The number of recaptures (104) again has a very high value in comparison to the 

number of captures (39 individuals) which means this number of the individuals of 

Emys orbicularis is rather close to reality. 

Similar to Lagoa do Garrão, there is a low number of juveniles captured but 2 pregnant 

females which, taking into account closeness of Lagoa do Garrão, can indicate that the 

colonization of new individuals will not occur in this area in the future. 

 

Lagoa de São Lourenço 
Every year (2011, 2012, 2013) 5 nasas and 9 fluctuating traps were placed in the lake. 

Due to the big size of the lake, it was divided into 3 zones – north, south and centre. The 
traps were distributed evenly in each zone to ensure the equilibrium of trapping. 

 
Figure A103. Localization of traps in Lagoa de São Lourenço during 2011, 2012, 2013 

 

The number of recaptures (477) is again much higher than the number of captures (180 

individuals) which indicates this number can be close to reality. 21 juveniles and 38 

neonates, although being a low number, is a positive result which shows nesting of 

Emys orbicularis occurs safely in the lake. 

 

Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul 
In 2011 5 nasas were placed in the lake, evenly distributed around its perimeter; 

Due to maintenance works in the northern part of lake in 2012, only 3 nasas were placed 

in the south of the lake; 

In 2013 4 nasas were placed in the south of the lake like it was in 2011, while it was not 

possible to locate 1 nasa in the north. 

 
Figure A104. A – localization of traps in Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul during 2011; B – 
localization of traps in Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul during 2012; C – localization of traps 
in Lagoa Quinta do Lago Sul in 2013 

 



114 

 

The number of recaptures in this case (507) was extremely high in comparison to the 

number of captures (101) which guarantees a little margin of error for the real number 

of individuals in the lake. 

The number of captured juveniles (46) is the highest among the 4 project sites although 

it is all the same low in comparison to the number of adults. The results show that the 

population of Emys orbicularis in the lake is theoretically healthy, with mature adult 

individuals capable of reproduction and renewal of population.
