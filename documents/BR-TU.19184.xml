resumo 
 

 

O choco comum, Sepia officinalis, é um cefalópode necto-bentónico que pode viver 
em ecossistemas de águas costeiras, com elevada influência de pressões 
antropogénicas e assim, estar vulnerável à exposição por vários contaminantes. O 
choco é uma espécie de grande importância para a economia local de Aveiro, 
considerando os dados globais de capturas desta espécie para a Ria de Aveiro. No 
entanto, os estudos acerca desta espécie na Ria de Aveiro são escassos, desta 
forma o presente estudo pretende preencher esta lacuna de informação sobre o 
choco na Ria de Aveiro. O choco entra para a Ria na primavera e no verão para 
reprodução, e volta para águas mais profundas no inverno. Em termos de 
abundância, as zonas, este e central da ria, a mais próxima da embocadura com o 
mar, apresentaram os valores de abundância mais elevados, sendo as regiões mais 
a norte e a sul dos principais canais, as de abundância mais baixa. Este fato pode 
estar relacionado com fatores abióticos, como a profundidade, a salinidade e a 
temperatura. No ponto mais a sul da Ria de Aveiro (Areão) nunca foram capturados 
chocos, tendo este local apresentado os valores mais baixos de salinidade e 
profundidade. 
O choco apresenta um crescimento alométrico, sendo as fêmeas mais pesadas que 
os machos, para comprimentos do manto superiores a 82.4 mm. Os machos 
atingem a maturação sexual primeiro que as fêmeas. Na Ria de Aveiro apenas uma 
geração de progenitores foi encontrada. O choco apresenta-se como predador 
oportunista, consumindo uma grande diversidade de presas de diferentes grupos 
taxonómicos. A dieta mostrou-se semelhante nos diferentes locais de amostragem 
observando-se diferenças significativas para as estações do ano. 
S. officinalis foi capturada em 10 locais da Ria de Aveiro com contaminação de 
diferentes origens antropogénicas. Assim, os níveis de metais analisados 
apresentaram-se semelhantes em todos os locais de amostragem, com a exceção 
de uma área restricta, o largo do Laranjo, que apresentou valores mais elevados. O 
choco possui a capacidade de acumular metais no seu organismo. Os níveis de Fe, 
Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg encontrados no manto e na glândula digestiva refletem uma 
acumulação diferencial de metais nos tecidos. Esta acumulação está relacionada 
com o tipo e função do tecido analisado e com o tipo de metal analisado (essencial 
e não essencial). As concentrações dos metais na glândula digestiva são mais 
elevadas que no manto, com exceção do mercúrio. Este fato pode dever-se à 
grande afinidade do manto para a incorporação de Metilmercúrio (MeHg), a mais 
abundante forma de mercúrio. A acumulação de metais pode variar ao longo da 
vida, dependendo do metal. As concentrações de Zn, Cd and Hg aumentam ao 
longo da vida, o Pb diminui e os metais essenciais como o Fe e Cu permanecem 
constantes. Os dados recolhidos sugerem que o choco (Sepia officinalis) possa ser 
usado como bioindicador de contaminação ambiental para alguns metais.

abstract 

 

The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is a necto-benthic cephalopod that can live 
in coastal ecosystems, with high influence of anthropogenic pressures and thus be 
vulnerable to exposure to various types of contaminants. The cuttlefish is a species 
of great importance to the local economy of Aveiro, considering the global data of 
catches of this species in the Ria de Aveiro. However, studies on this species in Ria 
de Aveiro are scarce, so the present study aims to fill this information gap about the 
cuttlefish in the Ria de Aveiro. The cuttlefish enters Ria de Aveiro in the spring and 
summer to reproduce, returning to deeper waters in the winter. In terms of 
abundance, the eastern and center regions of the lagoon, closer to the sea, showed 
the highest values of abundance, while the northern and southern regions of the 
main channel had the lowest abundance. This fact may be related to abiotic factors, 
as well as depth, salinity and temperature. In the most southern point of the Ria de 
Aveiro (Areão) no cuttlefish was caught. This site had the lowest values of salinity 
and depth. 
The cuttlefish has an allometric the females being heavier than males to mantle 
lengths greater than 82.4 mm. Males reach sexual maturity first than females. In Ria 
de Aveiro in a generation of parents was found. The cuttlefish, presents itself as 
opportunistic predators, consuming a wide variety of prey from different taxa. The 
diet was similar in different sampling locations observing significant differences for 
the seasons. 
S. officinalis was captured at 10 sites in the Ria de Aveiro with different 
anthropogenic sources of contamination. Thus, levels of metals analyzed were 
similar at all sampling sites, with the exception of a restricted area, Laranjo, which 
showed higher values. The cuttlefish has the ability to accumulate metals in your 
body. The levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg found in the digestive gland and 
mantle reflect a differential accumulation of metals in the tissues. This accumulation 
is related to the type and function of tissue analyzed and the type of metal analysis 
(essential and non-essential). The metal concentrations in the digestive gland are 
higher than in the mantle, with the exception of mercury. This may be due to the high 
affinity of the mantle for the incorporation of methylmercury (MeHg), the most 
abundant form of mercury. The accumulation of metals can vary over a lifetime, 
depending on the metal. The concentrations of Zn, Cd and Hg increases throughout 
life, while Pb decreases and essential metals such as Fe and Cu remain constant. 
The data collected suggest that the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) can be used as a 
bioindicator of environmental contamination for some metals.

I. General Introduction 

I.1. Coastal Environment – An overview 

Coastal environments are dynamic ecosystems where land, water and atmosphere 

interact in a delicate natural balance that is constantly affected by natural and human 

influence (Lopes et al., 2011). Consequently these ecosystems are easily susceptible to 

detrimental environmental impact from pollution or by other human activities (Pombo, 

2005). Natural pressures include storms, wind, tides, waves, sea level change and runoff 

(Lopes et al., 2011), while anthropogenic pressures include random urbanization and 

industrialization, unregulated wastewater discharges (domestic and industrial waste) and 

reduction of resources (overfishing and unplanned coastal agriculture) (Rabouille et al., 

2007). Coastal lagoons belong to these important ecosystems and are among the most 

productive ecosystems of the biosphere, where several organisms use the lagoon for 

nesting, feeding, nursery or sheltering (McLuscky and Elliott, 2004; Sousa et al., 2010). 

These productive areas are attractive and accessible to people and therefore densely 

populated, making the anthropogenic pressures an important factor in their evolution 

(Lopes et al., 2011). Aproximately 44 % of the world's population (more people than 

inhabited the entire globe in 1950) live within 150 km of the coast. In 2001 over half the 

world's population lived within 200 km of a coastline. Moreover, increasing volumes of 

waste, particularly sewage, are discharged into coastal waters with little or no treatment, 

what can cause eutrophication and endanger public health (UN Atlas of the Oceans, 

2010). Concerns of adverse long-term contaminant effects on aquatic ecosystems 

emerged in the last decades (Van der Oost et al., 2003). The protection, improvement 

and sustainable use of Europe´s water resources are the main goals of current European 

Water Policy (Kowalshi, 2009). In order to achieve this aim, legislation is defined by 

the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The great objective is to 

achieve good quality water status for all European aquatic ecosystems until 2015. 

However, the complexity and dynamics of these coastal environments and the constant 

change of these ecosystems due to natural causes may overlap the effects of the 

anthropogenic pressures, hampering the monitoring and the management of these 

important aquatic ecosystems.

I.2. Tools for monitoring aquatic systems 

Metal pollution has been an environmental issue in many developed and developing 

countries for decades, and there is a substantial need to understand the bioaccumulation 

and toxicity of metals in aquatic organisms (Wang and Rainbow, 2008). Over the last 

two or three decades, researchers proposed the use of living organisms in parallel with 

physical-chemical analyses to determine geographical and/or temporal variations in the 

bioavailable concentrations of trace metals, in order to evaluate the health state of the 

aquatic systems (Amiard et al., 1998; Rainbow and Phillips, 1993). Considering this, 

biomonitoring was defined as the systematic use of biological responses to evaluate 

changes in the environment (Cairns and Van der Schalie, 1980). This approach is based 

on the knowledge that chemicals which have entered the organisms leave markers 

reflecting that exposure. The marker may be the chemical itself, a breakdown product or 

a biological change in the organism as a result of the action of the chemical (Kowalshi, 

2009).  

 

I.2.1. Bioindicator, biomonitors or sentinel species 

Bioindicators, biomonitors or sentinel species can be defined as species which 

accumulate contaminants in their tissues (Beeby, 2001). Their use to identify regions 

with high concentrations of trace metals and synthetic organic concentrations in aquatic 

ecosystems is particularly well established, especially in temperate regions. 

Bioindicators can provide a time-integrated measure of bioavailability, responding, by 

definition, to the fraction present in the environment which is of direct ecotoxicological 

relevance (Phillips and Rainbow, 1993). Individual bioindicators respond differently to 

different sources of bioavailable metal, for example, in solution, in sediment or in food. 

To gain a complete representation of total trace metal bioavailability in a marine system 

it is necessary, therefore, to use a set of bioindicators species, reflecting metal 

bioavailability in all available sources (Phillips, 1990; Rainbow, 1990, 1993; Phillips 

and Rainbow 1993; Rainbow and Phillips, 1993; Galloway et al., 2004). Such 

comparative use of different biomonitors should allow identification of the particular 

source of the contaminant metal (Phillips and Rainbow, 1988, 1993). For example, a 

macrophytic algae responds essentially to dissolved metal sources, a suspension feeder 

like a mussel responds to metal sources in dissolved and suspended phases, and a 

deposit feeder responds to metal available in the sediment. 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 23 

Trace metals bioindicators need to conform to certain required characteristics, not 

least being metal accumulators (Butler et al., 1971; Bryan et al., 1980; Phillips, 1990; 

Phillips and Rainbow, 1993). Ideal bioindicators should be sedentary, easy to identify, 

abundant, long lived, available for sampling throughout the year, large enough to 

provide sufficient tissue for (individual) analysis, resistant to handling stress caused by 

laboratory studies of metal kinetics and/or field transplantations, tolerant of exposure to 

environmental variations in physical-chemical parameters such as salinity, and net 

accumulators of the metal in question with a simple correlation between metal 

concentration in tissues (body) and average ambient bioavailable metal concentration 

over a recent time period (Rainbow, 1995). However, not all bioindicators organisms 

follow all these criteria. Bivalves, particularly mussels, are one of the most relevant 

sentinel species (NOAA, 2004), as they are used in international environmental 

monitoring programs of marine contaminants as part of “Mussel Watch Programme” of 

the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Goldeberg et al. 1983). Fishes 

are good contamination indicators but despite having a considerable commercial value, 

they have great mobility. Along with fish, plankton is also used as bioindicator but 

strongly depend of the currents and local conditions and their sampling is often difficult. 

Molluscs, and especially mussels, are the most used organisms to monitor trace metals 

in coastal environments due to their abundance, physiology and distribution (Pimenta, 

2010). 

Bioindicators species in biomonitoring programs can have different uses (Beeby, 

2001):  

a) As accumulators, when used to increase analytical sensitivity for a contaminant; 

to compare the scale of contamination between sites, and to summarize a complex 

pollution signal;  

b) As integrators, when used to provide a running mean over time and space;  

c) As a measure of exposure, when used to quantify bioavailability of a pollutant 

from a particular source. 

 

I.2.2. Biomarkers 

A biological marker or biomarker is defined as quantifiable behavioural, physiological, 

histological, biochemical or genetic property that is used to measure response to an 

environmental change (Nordberg et al., 2009). The use of biomarkers measured at the 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 24 

molecular or cellular level have been proposed as sensitive ‘early warning’ tools for 

biological effect measurement in environmental quality assessment (McCarthy and 

Shugart, 1990). Newly the use of biomarker approach has been incorporated into several 

pollution monitoring programmes in Europe and the USA (e.g. the NOAA’s National 

Status and Trends Program). The United Nations Environment Programme has funded a 

biomonitoring programme in the Mediterranean Sea including a variety of biomarkers 

(UNEP, 1997). Recently, biomarkers have also been included in the Joint Monitoring 

Programme of the OSPAR convention where Portugal and Spain are members 

(Cajaraville et al., 2000). 

Considering the definitions of the World Health Organisation (1993), biomarkers can be 

classified as:  

a) biomarkers of exposure: an exogenous substance or its metabolite or the 

product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target 

molecule or cell that is measured in a compartment within an organism; 

b) biomarkers of effect: a measurable biochemical, physiological, behavioral or 

other alteration within an organism that, depending upon the magnitude, can 

be recognized as associated with an established or possible health 

impairment or disease; 

c) Biomarkers of susceptibility: an indicator of an inherent or acquired ability 

of an organism to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific 

xenobiotic substance. 

One of the most important features of molecular/cellular biomarkers is that they 

have the potential to anticipate changes at higher levels of biological organisation, i.e. 

population, community or ecosystem. Thus these ‘early warning’ biomarkers can be 

used in a predictive way, allowing the initiation of bioremediation strategies before 

irreversible environmental damage of ecological consequences occurs. Biomarkers are 

then defined as short-term indicators of long-term biological effects (Cajaraville et al., 

2000). 

 

I.3. Metals in coastal environments 

An increasing variety of industrial and agricultural chemicals are introduced in 

coastal ecosystems. Metals are of great environmental concern, since they tend to 

concentrate in marine organisms, are virtually non-degradable, and thus produce long

| P a g e 25 

lasting effects upon the environment even after their major sources have been removed 

(Kowalshi, 2009).  

Trace metals are defined as elements that occur in trace amounts within the 

environment or within organisms (typically&amp;lt;0.01% of the organism (Wittman, 1979)). 

The Class A of macronutrients (Na
+
, K

+
, Ca

2+
 and Mg

2+
) are excluded from these group, 

but the class B of ions are included, readily binding with sulphur, Cu

 and 

Pb (IV), and ions with an intermediate sulphur binding ability, Mn

 and As (III) (Nieboer and Richardson, 1980; 

Rainbow, 1997b) Metals are classified as essential, when their biological roles are well-

known, such occurs with Fe, Cu, Zn, I, Mn, Se or F and non-essential, when their 

physiological functions have not been clearly demonstrated, such as occurs with Ni, V; 

Ag, Hg, Pb and Cd (Lall, 1995; Bustamante, 1998). Essential metals always function in 

combination with organic molecules, usually proteins (Blackmore, 1998). For example, 

Cu, Zn and Fe are important components of the catalytic sites of enzymes, respiratory 

proteins and certain structural elements of the organisms (Depledge and Rainbow, 

1990). Other metals like Pb, Hg and Cd may relocate or substitute essential metals and 

interfere with the good functioning of the enzymes and associated cofactors (Van der 

Oost et al., 2003). As mentioned previously some trace metals are essential in low 

concentrations for the metabolism of organisms, but in excess all trace metals are toxic. 

In the environment, metals occur in a variety of forms or species affecting their toxicity 

(McLusky et al., 1986; Rainbow, 1997a). Besides, the toxicity of metal mixtures often 

cannot be predicted based on the toxicity of individual metals (Chapman et al., 2003). 

In addition, some of these elements appear in high concentrations in certain organs of 

the aquatic organisms, and the question is if it results from biological processes or 

influenced by the increasing availability in contaminant environments. 

There are three fates for trace metals in aquatic ecosystems: a) precipitation, which 

occurs when the concentration of the metal is higher than its solubility and where 

changes in solubility will occur with, for example, pH or when freshwater meets 

seawater in an estuary; b) adsorption, onto both inorganic and organic matter; and c) 

absorption by marine organisms (Bryan, 1979). The inputs of metals into marine 

ecosystems have several causes like effluent discharges, fluvial currents and by the 

atmosphere. Once in the water, metals adsorbed on the suspended particles and then 

accumulate in the sediment (Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Ramalhosa et al., 2006), which can 

serve as sink or source of metals to the overlying water column (Fichet et al., 1999; 

Baeyers et al., 2003). Marine and estuarine sediments bind and accumulate a wide 

variety of trace metals to often high concentrations, and can be redistributed by 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 26 

disturbances (including bioturbation by animals), and anthropogenic activities such as 

dredging (Chapman et al., 2003). Several marine organisms live a substantial part of 

their life in or on the sediment, which enhances the possibility to incorporate those 

metals. The sediment-water transferences of metals are controlled by two types of flux. 

The advective flux, when the transference of metals between the sediment and the water 

column is conducted by an external factor, such as tidal currents or bioturbation. And, 

the diffuse flux where the natural diffusion of metals occurs between the two phases, 

with a direction and rang depending on the depleted/enriched section (Point et al., 

2007). The mineralization of organic matter plays an important role in the sediment-

water interactions (Kowalshi, 2009). Iron and Mn oxides in the sediment are important 

scavengers for metals. However, during this process, ions Mn
2+

 and Fe
2+

 and associated 

trace metals (Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd) can be released into the pore-water and diffuse upward 

due to concentration gradients. According to Miao et al., 2006 this process is largely 

affected by Eh and pH. 

 

I.4. Sequestration of metals in aquatic organisms 

Sequestration of metals in organisms occurs throughout the various tissues involved 

in pathways for metal uptake, storage, elimination and detoxification (Figure I.1). 

 

Figure I.1 - Sequestration of metals (uptake, storage, elimination and detoxification (Adapted 

from Pimenta, 2010). 

 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 27 

I.4.1. Uptake of metals 

The uptake of metals in aquatic organisms can occur through different 

mechanisms: from water, suspended particles and sediments, or by food. The 

accumulation of trace elements directly by water is a crucial point to consider in the 

evaluation of the adverse effects on ecosystems (Van der Oost et al., 2003). Indeed, 

there are many works that use the accumulation of trace elements in organisms as mean 

to evaluate the environmental health condition (Fernandes et al., 2007; Bustamante et 

al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009). The internal transport of metal is made via circulatory 

system (Roesijadi and Robinson, 1994). The pathways of trace metal transport across 

the biological membrane have been well hypothesized, such as the passive diffusion of 

neutral metal species across the membrane, facilitated diffusion of metals via membrane 

transporter proteins, access through major ion channels (e.g., Ca channels) perhaps in 

association with active ion pumps, and endocytosis (Simkiss and Taylor, 1995; Hudson, 

1998). Pumps and channels are in the membranes, and have hydrophobic segments that 

bind metals. The carriers are liposoluble molecules which bind to metals in one side of 

membranes, make the passage and transport the metal to the solution on the opposite 

side of the membrane (Hudson, 1998). Dissolved metals are mainly taken up by 

exposed body surfaces such as the gills, whereas particulate metals are mostly ingested 

and then taken up after solubilisation in the gut. Uptake of essential metals (e.g. Cu, Fe 

and Zn), often involves specific pathways like, calcium channels and specific membrane 

carriers for Fe and Cu. For common divalent metals such as Cd and Zn, there are two 

different types of binding sites at the gill surface, a high-affinity, low-capacity site, and 

a low-affinity, high-capacity site. At a relatively low ambient metal concentration, 

metals are bound to the high-affinity, low-capacity site, and uptake exhibits a saturation 

pattern with increasing ambient metal concentrations. At a high ambient metal 

concentration, following the saturation of the high-affinity sites, metals are bound to the 

low-affinity, high-capacity site, and uptake increases linearly with increasing ambient 

metal concentration (Wang and Rainbow, 2008). For non-essential elements such as Hg, 

specific uptake mechanisms are unknown and so, it’s believed that they should follow 

the existing pathways for essential metals (Hudson, 1998, Sunda and Huntsman, 1998). 

Uptake of non-essential metals is almost totally determined by the degree of exposure. 

In contrast, accumulation of some essential metals may be less influenced by external 

concentrations, suggesting various degrees of homeostasis (Langston et al. 1998). In 

addition, numerous environmental and biological factors including dissolved metal 

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651305000151#bib84


Chapter I 

| P a g e 28 

interactions (Amiard-Triquet and Amiard, 1998) have been considered for their 

influence on trace metal uptake and bioaccumulation. 

In organisms without external shells, as cephalopods, the uptake from water can 

take place in the gills but also in all body surface, and in all molluscs some absorption 

of dissolved metal across the digestive epithelium (Langston et al., 1998). Food may 

also be a significant source of metals, if not the primary source, to organisms (Wang, 

2002). For marine organisms dietary uptake (trophic transfer) is the predominant 

pathway by which metals are accumulated, primarily because of the very low dissolved 

uptake rate of metals (Xu and Wang, 2002; Zhang and Wang, 2006a, b). 

 

I.4.2. Bioaccumulation 

Bioaccumulation in a tissue can be considered as a balance between two kinetic 

processes accumulation and elimination of an element (Connel and Miller, 1984, Brown 

and Depledge, 1998). Generally, the accumulation of metals occurs in a pattern 

described in the Figure I.2. When an organism is exposed to a metal, levels increase 

logarithmically until adsorption sites become full (Langston et al., 1998), leading to a 

reduction in the accumulation. The elimination process becomes clear when a decrease 

in metal levels in the tissues of the organisms is observed. However, not all the metals 

are rapidly eliminated, depending on its half-life. Metal exposure may induce specific 

metal detoxification processes or physiological and biochemical changes that can 

subsequently affect the uptake of metals (Wang and Rainbow, 2005). Over the last few 

decades, numerous studies have been carried out on the uptake and bioaccumulation of 

trace metals by aquatic animals (Hamelink et al., 1994; Turner and Tessier, 1995). The 

bioaccumulation of trace metals depends on the physiological accumulation pattern of 

the species for each metal. If organisms with accumulation patterns with increasing 

dependence on storage accumulation follow sequentially along a food chain, the effect 

will mimic biomagnification of trace metals along food chains (Amiard-Triquet et al., 

1993; Wang, 2002). 

The different bioaccumulation strategies go from a high accumulation and weak 

depuration to weak accumulation and a high depuration. The subsequent fate of the 

element depends on the particular physiology of the organism, as to whether the metal is 

used for an essential metabolic purpose, stored in the body, excreted, or even gains 

access to the “wrong” biomolecule (Rainbow, 2002).

Miller, 1984). 

 

I.4.3. Detoxification 

Aquatic organisms have the ability to accumulate high levels of essential and 

non-essential metals, and therefore they need to develop effective detoxification 

systems (Finger and Smith, 1987; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998). Once exposure has 

occurred and substances are bioavailable, a sequence of biological responses may take 

place. Intrinsic (e.g. sex, age, health and nutritional status) and extrinsic (e.g. duration, 

dose, route of exposure to the contaminant and the presence of other chemicals) factors 

may influence the health of the organisms even when they are exposed to trace elements 

at undesirable concentrations (Van der Oost et al., 2003). Trace metals in excess are 

potentially toxic and should be removed from the vicinity of important biological 

molecules to maintain the regular function of cells. Subcellular metal partitioning is the 

basis of internal metal sequestration over different organs and tissues, depending upon 

many factors such as metal type and metal pre-exposure (Vijver et al., 2004). Indeed, it 

is generally accepted that toxicity will manifest itself at the subcellular level before it is 

observed at higher levels of biological organisation (Cajaraville et al., 2000).  

Aquatic organisms have evolved a number of subcellular systems for 

accumulation, regulation and detoxification of the excess of essential and non-essential 

metals, which allowed aquatic organisms to survive within environments containing 

toxic metals (Bebianno, 1990; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998; Isani et al., 2000). 

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X10002092#bib17


Chapter I 

| P a g e 30 

Currently, metals are generally fractionated into 5 operationally defined subcellular 

pools, consisting of metal-rich granules (MRG), cellular debris (mainly cellular 

membrane fragments), organelles (metals bound with mitochondria, lysosomes, 

endoplasmic reticulum), heat shock proteins (HSP, including enzymes), high-molecular-

weight ligands (HMW, such as metalloenzymes), low-molecular-weight ligands (LMW, 

e.g. glutathione) and heat-resistant proteins (generally considered to be metallothioneins 

(MTs) or more correctly metallothionein-like proteins MTLP) (Wallace et al., 2003). 

Overall, systems at subcellular level may be activated in order to prevent harmful 

effects. The onset of toxicity can happen at any total body concentration if the uptake 

rate changes such that it exceeds the combined rates of excretion and detoxification for 

sufficient time for the concentration of metabolically available metal to exceed a 

threshold (Rainbow, 2007). 

One of the best studied subcellular structures are the MTs, low-molecular-weight-rich-

proteins, metal-binding protein rich in sulphur groups, with high affinity for group B 

metal ions (e.g. Zn, Cu, Cd and Hg) (OSPAR commission, 2013). MTs are found in all 

vertebrates and most invertebrates, being identified in approximately 50 different 

species of aquatic invertebrates, the majority of which are molluscs or crustaceans. 

Most forms of MTs are involved in metal-sequestration, thereby possibly: regulating 

cellular processes requiring Zn and/or Cu; and binding and thus temporarily detoxifying 

non-essential elements such as Cd and Hg. In addition, MT has been suggested to be 

involved in the cellular defense against free radicals (mainly due to the large number of 

SH-groups) (OSPAR commission, 2013). Consequently, they have become of great 

interest for assessing pollution in the marine environment and are seen as potential 

biomarkers of metal exposure in molluscs and fish (Langston et al., 1998). Trace metals 

can induce MTs (Bebiano et al., 1993; Bebianno and Serafim, 1998; Lueng and 

Furness, 2001; Shi and Wang, 2005), which are involved in cellular regulation 

(homeostasis) and detoxification of these metals (Bebiano and Langston, 1998; 

Roesijadi et al., 1998; Viarengo et al., 1998; Wang and Rainbow, 2005; Amiard et al., 

2006). In marine fish species, MT concentration in tissues has been found to be most 

strongly associated with Zn and Cu levels, although Cd may also result in minor 

increases in areas with metal stress (Hylland et al., 2006). The fact that aquatic 

organisms have the capacity to synthesize these MTs that can sequester and 

subsequently detoxify metals implies that the increased body burden of metals will not 

necessarily result in increased toxic effects (Di Giulio et al., 1995).

Aquatic organisms utilize a variety of mechanism to eliminate metals. The kinetic of 

metal release is complex and reflects the diverse compartments from which metals must 

be mobilized. Additionally, physical and chemical parameters, such as temperature and 

salinity, may affect the rate of release in aquatic organisms, which can use several 

pathways to release metals: renal, digestive or diapedesis (in molluscs) (Kowalshi, 

2009). Salinity is one of the environmental factors that can have a wide variety of 

effects on the chemical speciation of river-borne trace metals such as desorption of 

particle-bound metals, organic complexation and removal of trace metals from solution 

(Li et al., 1984).

I.5.2. World distribution  

The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis Linnaeus, 1758, is one of the world's 

best known cephalopods. The specie presents a wide distribution (Figure I.4), is found 

in eastern Atlantic shelf waters (Nixon and Mangold, 1998), from southern Norway to 

south Mediterranean sea (Roper et al., 1984), and in the north Africa until Cap Blanc 

(Boletzky, 1983; Kromov et al., 1998). Further south in African coast Sepia officinalis 

is replaced by the subspecie Sepia officinalis hierreda (Guerra, 1987; Guerra et al., 

2001). Common cuttlefish is absent from American coast (Roper et al., 1984; Guerra, 

1987; Nash and Thorpe, 2003). In Portugal, cuttlefish is common among all Portuguese 

coast (Roper et al., 1984), however it is more abundant on west coast, at south of the 

Tagus river and in Algarve Coast (south Portugal) (Brito, 1998). There are 

approximately 100 species in the genus Sepia, in Europe’s coastal waters (Roper et al., 

1984; Pierce et al., 2010). In the same area of distribution also exists, Sepia elegans and 

Sepia orbignyana, species from the same genus of Sepia officinalis (Guerra, 1987; 

Pierce et al., 2010). Within these areas the specie lives in coastal waters and on 

continental shelf (Boletzky, 1983) (Figure I.4). These species of the continental shelf 

comprise only about 15% of all the cephalopods and live in waters with less than 300 m 

depth, which covers 6% of the Earth’s surface (Clarke, 1996).

I.5.3. Morphological characteristics 

The diagnostic characteristics of Sepia sp. genus are: size; number and 

arrangement of suckers in the tentacle club, as well as the sepion (cuttlebone) shape 

(Roper et al., 1984). According to Guerra (1992), the specie Sepia officinalis is distinct 

from others of the same genus by the following features: 

a) Body is broad and flattened, and is therefore oval in cross-section; 

b) Shape of the internal, porous and calcareous shell know as cuttlebone or sepion; 

c) Projection of the mantle over the head forming an obtuse angle; 

d) Encircling the mouth there are ten appendices: eight arms with suckers, used to 

manipulate prey, and two tentacles with flattened paddle-like tips, used to catch 

prey; 

e) tentacles are retractable into bags located on both sides of the head; 

f) Arms are short and possess 4 rows of suckers, with chitinous rings while 

tentacular clubs possess 5-6 suckers in transverse rows, where the median 

suckers are moderately enlarged; 

g) In males the left arm IV is hectocotylized where the normal-sized suckers are 

replaced by a series of minute suckers scattered over a large area of transverse 

folds, the hectocotylus. 

Mantle of common cuttlefish reaches a maximum length of 45 cm. In terms of weight, 

cuttlefish can reach up to 4 kg in temperate waters, not reaching more than 30 cm, and 2 

Kg in subtropical waters (Ropert et al., 1984). 

Cuttlefish are one of few animal groups with the ability to camouflage themselves on a 

wide variety of backgrounds, from open sandy plains to complex coral and rock reef 

habitats (Barbosa et al., 2008; Hanlon and Messenger, 1988). Camouflage is the 

primary defence in cuttlefish (Chiao et al., 2009). 

 

I.5.4. Ecology 

Sepia officinalis is a necto-benthic specie occurring predominantly on sandy and muddy 

bottoms from the intertidal zone to approximately 200m depth, with the highest 

abundance in the upper 100 m (OSPAR, 2000; Norman, 2000). Although excellent 

swimmers, they generally are bottom dwellers (Roper et al., 1984). 

Cuttlefish can live in a range of salinity between 20 and 38 (Guerra and Castro, 1988). 

In aquaculture, both embryonic development and growth of young cuttlefish, usually

occurs between 36 to 37 (Domingues et al., 2001a; Domingues et al., 2004a; Baeza-

Rojano et al., 2010). The range of temperature tolerated by cuttlefish is 10ºC to 30ºC. 

At temperatures below 10ºC the individuals do not feed, stay inactive and die after a 

couple of days (Richard, 1971; Bettencourt, 2000). Due to its capacity to adapt to a 

large range of these external parameters (temperature and salinity), the occurrence of 

this species is frequent in coastal lagoons, where cuttlefishs are exposed to unstable 

hydrological conditions, along the year (Palmegiano and D’Apote, 1983; Guerra et al., 

1988; Serrano, 1992; Guerra, 2006).  

The calcified shell of S. officinalis is internal and assists the animal in locomotion by 

facilitating buoyancy (Bassaglia et al., 2013). Experiments with cuttlefish showed that 

cuttlebone of large animals implode between 150 m to 200 m, whereas advanced 

embryonic specimens and newly hatched implode between 50 m to 100 m. The larger 

individuals are occasionally caught at depths greater than the implosion depth of 

juveniles shell parts. They apparently avoid the implosion of the early shell portions by 

refilling these first-formed chambers with cameral liquid later in life (Ward and 

Boletzky, 1984).  

Captive-raised experiments showed that behaviour of cuttlefish was intensely affected 

by housing conditions and suggested that this specie is probably semi-solitary under 

natural conditions (Boal et al., 1999). Domingues et al. (2003) revealed that S. 

officinalis cultured in isolation conditions had higher growth and survival rates than the 

ones maintained at relatively high densities, even when stressed. The authors observed 

agonistic behaviour related with competition for space with higher densities in tanks, 

indicating that density, or lack of space, appear to be more limiting than isolation. 

 

I.5.5. Reproductive traits  

Fertility in Sepia officinalis varies typically between 200 and 3000 eggs per female 

(Boletzky, 1988). Sexual maturation is conditioned by temperature and light. High 

temperatures improve the sexual maturation and light acts in the optical glandular 

system (weak light accelerates the process). Males reach sexual maturity earlier than 

females (Richard, 1971; Boletzky, 1983; Guerra and Castro, 1988), and in both genders 

the sexual maturation does not depend on the size of the individual (Boletzky, 1983). 

During reproduction season, males protect the females, and become more aggressive, 

attacking everything or everyone approaching (Richard, 1971). 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 35 

Cuttlefish is migratory specie of coastal waters that enters shallow coastal ecosystems 

for reproduction. Spawning generally takes place in coastal waters in depths rarely 

above the 30 to 40 m (Boletzky, 1983; Boucaud-Camou and Boismery, 1991). The life 

cycle and biology of this species are well known in several areas, as northwest 

Mediterranean (Mangold, 1966), English Channel (Richard, 1971), Sea Catalonia 

(Mangold-wirz, 1963), Ria de Vigo (Guerra and Castro, 1988) and Ria Formosa 

(Coelho and Martins, 1989; Martins, 1990). However, since the majority of the studies 

on Sepia officinalis have been based on laboratory-reared individuals under controlled 

conditions, some aspects of its ecology may remain unknown. Therefore there is the 

need of extending the knowledge of this specie to other areas of its distributional range, 

like northwest of Portugal. The main spawning season covers spring and summer, but 

there is also winter spawning, which is especially pronounced on the Atlantic coast 

(Pierce et al., 2010). 

In its natural environment, eggs are laid near the coast in spring. Particularly in the 

English Channel and Atlantic Ocean, they may be exposed to air and/or desalinated 

rainwater due to daily tides. Eggs are attached in batches and surrounded by thick black 

gelatinous envelopes (capsule) potentially protecting the embryo from environmental 

aggressions (Bassaglia et al., 2013). The eggs sizes usually range between 8 to 10 mm 

of diameter and are fixated in the shape of a bunch to algae, shells or other substrates 

(Boletzky, 1983; Roper et al., 1984). Larvae hatch as tiny replicas of adults assuming 

also their behaviour, namely the benthonic way of life (Boletzky, 1983). 

The mantle length of young individuals varies between 8 and 9 mm (Boletzky, 1979). 

Temperature influences the growing rate of individuals, which increases with the 

temperature, and the same trend is verified with the food availability (Richard, 1971). 

Cuttlefish has one of most complex nervous systems of all invertebrates. The 

connection between the brain cortex and the optical lobes is particularly developed 

(Boucaud-Camou, 1990).  

As several other cephalopod species, S. officinalis has an extremely high growth ratio, 

and his life span does not exceed two years. Females undergo just one reproduction 

round and die shortly after (Bassaglia et al., 2013). Cephalopods are the unique 

multicellular species with an exponential growth during a significant part of its life 

cycle (Monteiro et al., 1992). 

 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 36 

I.5.6. Trophic Ecology 

In general, cephalopods are active carnivores that feed on living preys during their 

entire life cycle (Boucher-Rodoni et al., 1987). The diet of S. officinalis includes a wide 

variety of prey, like fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, polychaetes, bivalves, nemertean 

worms, gastropods (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985, Castro and Guerra, 1989, Pinczon du 

Sel, 1992, Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000; Domingues et al., 2004b, Alves, 2006). Species 

composition within these prey groups depends upon the respective species composition 

and availability in each ecosystem. Large cuttlefish are also cannibals, capturing and 

eating smaller individuals (Richard, 1971; Castro and Guerra, 1990; Pinczon du Sel and 

Daguzan, 1992). Considering the wide variety of preys eaten by cuttlefish, this specie 

should be considered as trophic opportunistic animal (Alves, 2006). Over age there is a 

progressive replacement of prey, e.g. crustaceans by fishes (Castro and Guerra, 1990), 

this ontogenetic changes are also related with prey size (Blanc et al, 1999; Blanc and 

Daguzan, 2000). In terms of sex, S. officinalis presented a similar composition of the 

diet for males and females (Guerra and Sánchez, 1985). Castro and Guerra (1990) 

observed that with the sexual maturation the feeding intensity of females increased. The 

variety of preys decreased with the increase of length (Castro and Guerra, 1990).  

Predators of Sepia officinalis are marine mammals (Risso´s dolphin, Mediterranean 

monk seal and fur seals) and also, elasmobranchs (blue shark, smooth hound) (Pierce et 

al., 2010). 

 

I.5.7. Commercial importance, fisheries and aquaculture  

The total global capture production in 2011 was the third ever, slightly below 1996 

(93.8 million tons) and 2000 (93.5 million tons). Molluscs contributed with 767,021 

tons in 2010 and 738,729 tons in 2011, and a slight reduction of 3.7% from 2011 to 

2010 was observed (FAO, 2013). Global landings of cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid and 

octopus) have increased dramatically over the past 50 years and now constitute almost 

5% of the total world’s fisheries production (Pierce et al., 2010). The main reason for 

this increasing demand is that cephalopods are a good protein and lipid source (Kreuzer, 

1984; Sinanoglou and Miniadis-Meimaroglou, 1998; Sinanoglou and Miniadis-

Meimaroglou, 2000; Zlatanos et al., 2006), therefore a highly nutritious food that 

represents an alternative to over exploited fish resources (Sykes, 2009).

| P a g e 37 

For cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis the FAO department of statistics presents the evolution 

of total landings of the specie, since 1950 until 2011 (Figure I.5). Since 1980 the 

landings of cuttlefish exceeded 100 000 t and were more than 116 000 t in 2006 (FAO 

statistic), comprising 49 000 t landed into Europe from the Northeast Atlantic and 67 

000 t from Mediterranean. At the European scale, cuttlefish is currently the most 

important cephalopod fishery resource (Pierce et al., 2010) and is presently the highest 

yielding cephalopod group harvested in the north-east Atlantic, with the English 

Channel supporting the main fishery for this species (Bloor et al., 2013).  

Catches are made demersally by means of trawling and artisanal trapping. Trammel nets 

are widely used in most southern European countries for the exploitation of common 

cuttlefish. These traditional fisheries are seasonal and are related to the massive inshore 

spawning migration of S. officinalis (Pierce et al., 2010). The operation of these nets to 

catch cuttlefish usually extends from late winter to early autumn, depending on the 

availability of the resource as well as the seasonal abundance of other commercial 

species (e.g. shrimp, sole) that are also targeted on inshore fishing grounds (Arnáiz et 

al., 2001; Lefkaditou et al., 2004). Traps are the dominant gear for the capture of 

cuttlefish in south Portugal, Algarve coast (Carneiro et al., 2006).

In Portugal, the Aveiro region has a key role in the Portuguese fisheries market, 

contributing with 10,695 t of fish, crustaceans and mollusks (DGPA, 2010). Cuttlefish 

is caught along the entire Portuguese coast being considered as an important fishery

resource (Serrano, 1992). Local fishermen, in Ria the Aveiro, use trammel nets to 

capture cuttlefish (Jorge and Sobral, 2004). Despite being a seasonal fishery, cuttlefish 

landings in Aveiro Lagoon are very important to the local economy. Figure I.6 shows 

the total landings of cuttlefish between 2002 and 2012 and the annual turnover of those 

landings.  

Along the years, landings of cuttlefish fluctuate from higher to lower catches, and this 

fact is certainly related with changes in environmental conditions and with the 

recruitment. Modelling and understanding cuttlefish exploitation is a challenge for a 

series of reasons: life-cycle and population dynamics are different from those of finfish 

(Caddy, 1983; Boyle and Boletzky, 1996). Recruitment, the renewal of harvestable 

stages in a population, is a key parameter of stock dynamics, and recruitment variability 

is often considered as the most difficult problem in stock assessment (Hilborn and 

Walters, 1992 in Challier et al. 2002). In Cephalopods, the short life span makes 

commercial catches more dependent on the number of recruits than in most teleost fish 

(Challier et al., 2002). Early life stages are likely to incur higher mortalities than adult 

stages (Caddy, 1996), and are generally described as extremely responsive to 

environmental variables. Their population show wide fluctuations of abundance (Boyle 

and Boletzky, 1996), largely because they usually grow rapidly to maturity, they carry 

few food reserves (Rodhouse and Nigmatullin, 1996), have little overlap of generations 

and their migratory patterns make them particularly susceptible to chances in 

oceanographic conditions (Clarke, 1996). On the other hand, they show great resilience 

to fluctuations by their breeding seasons, varying the depth of their spawning grounds 

and maintaining complex recruitment patterns (Boyle and Boletzky, 1996).  

Despite being seasonal, cuttlefish landings in the Ria de Aveiro are very important for 

the local economy (Figure I.6). In 2010, the annual turnover was more than 1.5 million 

Euros. Between 2002 and 2012 the average turnover was 846 thousand euros, and the 

average price for 1 Kg varied between 2.43 € and 3.72 € in 2004 and 2012, respectively.

Figure I.6 - Total landings of cuttlefish in Aveiro Lagoon by tones captured (bars) and Annual 

turnover per year (line). (Docapesca - Statistical Department, 2013). 

The high commercial value of cephalopods and their characteristics: short life cycles, 

fast growth rates and high food conversion, makes the aquaculture of this group of 

molluscs an area of increasing interest (Boletzky, 1983; Domingues et al., 2001a; Pierce 

et al., 2010). The cuttlefish, S. officinalis, is an economically important species and 

therefore interesting to aquaculture (Pierce et al., 2010). Sepia officinalis is one of the 

most easily cultured cephalopods, and has been cultured in aquaria since the late 1960s 

(Richard, 1971; Pascual, 1978; Boletzky and Hanlon, 1983; Forsythe et al., 1994; Lee et 

al., 1998; Domingues et al., 2001a, 2001b, 2002, 2003, 2004a; Quintana et al., 2005; 

Sykes et al., 2006; Baeza-Rojano et al., 2010). Aquaculture of cephalopods represents 

an alternative to over exploited fish resources, thus the increasing development in this 

area (Sykes, 2009). 

 

I.6. Ria de Aveiro – a case study 

According to INE (2011) the number of inhabitants surrounding the entire watershed is 

approximately one million people. Ria de Aveiro has an important environmental role in 

local and surrounding areas due to its variety of resources and uses such as fishing (sea-

bass, eel, sole, flounder, lamprey, cuttlefish, crab, shrimp and cockle), aquaculture 



Chapter I 

| P a g e 40 

(mainly, sea-bass, eel, oyster and clam), recreational (windsurfing, boating, sailing and 

swimming) and traditional activities (salt production). Agriculture and cattle rearing, 

industries (chemical, metallurgic, ceramics, tannery and pulp miling), urban 

development and port activities increased significantly over years in the area around the 

lagoon (Abreu et al., 1998; Pastorinho et al., 2012). 

 

I.6.1. Morphologic and hydrological features  

The Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal lagoon located in the North-western of Portugal. It 

presents a very complex geometry and is characterized by large areas of intertidal flats 

and a web of narrow channels (Dias and Picado, 2011). The Ria de Aveiro lagoon 

constitutes a very important area, being the most extensive shallow lagoon system in 

Portugal and the most dynamic in terms of physical and biogeochemical processes 

(Picado et al., 2010). The lagoon covers an area of 83 km
2
 at high tide (spring tide) and 

66 km
2
 at low tide, is 45 km long, 10 km wide and is connected to sea by a 350 m wide 

inlet, fixed by two jetties (Dias and Lopes, 2006). Connection to the sea was made 

artificially since 1808 (Pombo, 2005). Four main branches radiate from this sea 

entrance: Mira, S. Jacinto, Ílhavo and Espinheiro channels (Dias, 2009). This system is 

also characterized by a large number of other smaller channels between which lie 

significant intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans (Picado 

et al., 2010). The average depth of the lagoon relative to mean sea level is about 3 m 

(Picado et al., 2010). The evolution process lasted for 800 years and occurred through 

the deposition of sand, with the formation of coastal sand dunes and a system of islands 

within the lagoon, this process was interrupted in the 18
th

 century by human action 

(Silva, 2000). 

The major factors that control the hydrologic dynamics of the Ria de Aveiro are: 

a) Oceanic tide, which propagates from south to north along the west coast 

Portugal, entering in the lagoon by its mouth; 

b) Winter that influences the lagoon for short periods and essentially in the wider 

part of the Ria de Aveiro; 

c) Freshwater flows, transported by four major rivers that converge to the Ria: 

Vouga and Antuã from the East; Caster from the North and Boco from the 

Southeast (Dias et al., 2001);

Aveiro (Dias, 2009). 

 

I.6.2. Contamination in Ria de Aveiro 

The Ria de Aveiro is highly explored and impacted by anthropogenic activities, with 

significant and diverse sources of aquatic contaminants due to population settlement, 

industrial, agricultural and shipping activities (e.g. Pacheco et al., 2005; Vasconcelos et 

al., 2007; Pastorinho et al., 2012). The contamination pathways from anthropogenic 

sources, in the Ria de Aveiro, have been extensively documented (e.g. Monterroso et 

al., 2003a; Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Several works conducted in the Ria de Aveiro 

system, in northern Portugal, revealed high levels of several metals (Hg, Cu, Cd, Zn, 

Pb) (Borrego et al., 1994; Martins, 2010; Monterroso et al., 2003a; Pereira, 2003; 

Nunes et al., 2008; Pastorinho et al., 2012).  

Despite all the activities mentioned above the principal source of anthropogenic 

contamination in Ria de Aveiro is the chlor-alkali plant located in Estarreja, that started 

its activity in early decade of 1950 and presented different stages and phases of 

production increments (Pereira, 1997; OSPAR, 2005) and being responsible for the 

main Portuguese chlor and caustic production (OSPAR, 2005). As many studies show 

(e.g. Lacerda and Salomons, 1998 and Ullrich et al., 2007) mercury-cell chlor-alkali 

plants have been identified as main sources of mercury to the environment. Though the 

plant started to change the production process in 1994 and completely ceased the use of 

mercury in 2002 (Ospar Commission, 2006). Mercury emitted from the existing plant 

still remains significant in the surrounding environment. Additionally, it is known that 

through the years, large amounts of mercury have reached Ria de Aveiro, a nearby 

coastal lagoon, due to wastewater discharges (Reis, 2009) and a large number of 

abandoned mines draining to the Vouga River or its tributaries (Delgado et al., 2000). 

Due to high levels of mercury found in Ria de Aveiro, this coastal lagoon and its 

environs have been extensively studied, with particular focus on sediments (Lucas et al., 

1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998; Pereira, 1997; Ramalhosa et al., 2001, 

2005, 2006; Ramalhosa et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2009; Pastorinho et al., 2012), 

plankton (Monterroso et al., 2003b), estuarine macroalgae (Coelho et al., 2005) and 

aquatic organisms (Coelho et al., 2006; Válega et al., 2006; Nunes et al., 2008; Cardoso 

et al., 2013). An effort has been made to monitor species with economic importance,

I.7. Aims and Organization of the Thesis 

The main objective of the present thesis was to characterize (biology, ecology, life 

cycle, diet and metal contamination) the cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, in Ria de Aveiro, a 

resource of high importance and a current item of the humans’ diet. In this thesis we 

pretended to answer to several questions such as: What is the distribution of cuttlefish in 

Ria de Aveiro? Which environmental factors affect the cuttlefish distribution in the Ria 

de Aveiro? Which is the spawning season of Sepia officinalis in the Ria de Aveiro? 

What are the feeding preferences of Sepia officinalis in the Ria de Aveiro? Is the diet of 

cuttlefish affected by season or sampling station? Sepia officinalis can accumulate 

metals in their tissues, and considering that Ria de Aveiro is a coastal ecosystem with a 

history of contamination, does the cuttlefish represents any risk for human health? What 

factors affected metal contamination in Sepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro? To answer to 

these questions and others, several biological and ecological data was collected in Ria 

de Aveiro during this work. The choice of tissues analysed were selected according to 

previous studies (Miramand and Bentley, 1992) and the choice of sampling areas within 

the Ria de Aveiro were selected according to previous studies of ecology (Pombo and 

Rebelo, 2000) and ecotoxicology (Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003a). 

The present thesis is organized in seven chapters. Each chapter can be summarized as 

follows: 

? Chapter I: provides a theoretical introduction regarding aspects of contamination 

in aquatic ecosystems and in the studied area, and the characterization of Sepia 

officinalis; 

? Chapter II: reviews the available bibliography concerning the biological, life 

cycle and ecological data about Sepia officinalis and makes a comprehensive 

study of this issues in Ria de Aveiro; 

? Chapter III: describes the concentrations of essential metals (Fe, Zn, Cu) and 

non-essential (Cd and Pb) in mantle and digestive gland of Sepia officinalis in 

Ria de Aveiro and evaluates the seasonal and spatial trends of this accumulation.

It is also compared the obtained values with others European aquatic ecosystems 

and one in New Caledonia waters. 

? Chapter IV: describes the concentrations of Hg in mantle and digestive gland of 

several selected sites in Ria de Aveiro and evaluates the eventual risk of 

consuming cuttlefish captured in a restrict area of Ria de Aveiro, the Laranjo 

bay. 

? Chapter V: describes the levels of essential (Fe, Zn and Cu) and non-essential 

(Cd and Hg) in two tissues (mantle and digestive gland) during the life cycle of 

Sepia officinalis. 

? Chapter VI: provides a general discussion of the results obtained in Chapters II-

V. As each of these chapters include its own discussion material, in this chapter, 

only a concise and global discussion of results is presented in order to highlight 

synergies between the different chapters and to show the coherence of the work.

II. Ecology and life cycle of common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis in a typical 

estuarine lagoon 

 

II.1. Abstract 

The cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) is one of the most important fisheries in Ria de Aveiro. 

Temporal and spatial distribution patterns and the reproductive cycle of this specie were 

studied monthly in ten sampling areas along the lagoon from July 2001 to December 

2003. The highest abundance was obtained in summer, while spring showed the higher 

biomass but a much lower abundance of specimens. Mature individuals prevailed in the 

eastern zone of the lagoon during summer while juveniles were dominant in autumn and 

winter. Almost all individuals leave the lagoon during winter. The reproduction season 

began in spring and continued during summer, the data did not reveal the existence of a 

second reproductive cycle in the autumn and winter. Weight–length relationship 

revealed significant differences between sexes, for lengths higher than 82.4 mm females 

were larger than males. A sex ratio of 1:1 was presented in this studied. The length at 

first maturity was estimated at 146.9 ± 0.8 mm dorsal mantle length (DML) for females 

and 91.4 ± 0.9 mm DML for males, and it was verified that males mature earlier than 

females. In Ria de Aveiro only one generation of cuttlefish breeders were found and all 

the individuals were in their first year of life. In terms of trophic ecology, the cuttlefish 

is an opportunistic feeder, consuming several preys of different taxa. Diet was not 

different between selected sites, however reveled differences between seasons and 

preys. The preferred prey for Sepia officinalis were the group of Portunidae, and the 

species Crangon crangon, Carcinus maenas and Pomatoschistus microps were 

secondary preys.

II.2. Introduction  

Like other cephalopods, Sepia officinalis reproduces only once over a short period at the 

end of its life (Mangold, 1983). The main stages of its life are punctuated by important 

seasonal migrations between shallow waters in summer and deeper waters in the winter 

(Gauvrit et al., 1997). Cuttlefish live approximately two years and exhibits mass 

mortality of adults following spring spawning period (Boletzky, 1983). Although 

cuttlefish can exhibit variations in the life cycle, e.g. Domingues et al. (2002) referred 

that some specimens can only reach 6 to 9 months of age. The duration of its life cycle 

is closely related to environmental factors, like the temperature of water (Domingues et 

al., 2002). Thus, in the northern part of their distribution area (English Channel), they 

reproduce during the second year of life, during a short breeding season of 2 to 3 

months (Boucaud-Camou et al., 1991). In contrast, in Warmer waters such as those 

around the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Tunis, the majority of 

cuttlefish reproduce at one year old and over a longer period (Coelho and Martins, 

1991; Guerra and Castro, 1988; Mangold, 1966).  

Due to the seasonal migrations for reproduction, the cuttlefish is exposed to a wide 

range of diets (Guerra, 2006). Several authors have studied the feeding habits of 

cuttlefish in northern Spain, France and Mediterranean (Najai and Ktari, 1979; Castro 

and Guerra, 1989, 1990; Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1992; Blanc, 1998; Pinczon du 

Sel et al., 2000; Boucaud-Camou et al., 1985). However, in Portugal studies about diet 

only appears in south coast, Alves et al., (2006) in Algarve and Neves et al., (2009) in 

Sado estuary. In the northern of Portugal, none published data about feeding habits in 

known.  

Cephalopods have growth rates that can be higher than 10% body weight day
-1

 

(Domingues et al., 2001b). Since cephalopods are poikilothermic, temperature is the 

most important factor affecting growth rates when food is abundant (Forsythe and Van 

Heukelen, 1987). Beyond the duration of life cycle and growth rates of cuttlefish, many 

others characteristics of their life cycle are affected by temperature such as survival and 

feeding rates, age and size maturation, embryonic development and hatchling survival 

(Boletzky, 1979; Boletzky and Hanlon, 1983).  

Sepia officinalis L., is one of the best known Cephalopods (Guerra and Castro, 1988). 

Several studies have been conducted on distribution (Gi Geon 1981; Boletzky, 1983; 

Roper et al., 1984; Kromov et al., 1998; Nixon and Mangold, 1998), biology (Ezzedine-



Chapter II 

| P a g e 69 

Najal S. 1984; Guerra, 1992; Clarke, 1996; Norman, 2000), life cycle (Choe, 1966; 

Boletzky, 1979; Boletzky, 1983; Forsythe et al., 1994; Le Goeff and Daguzan, 1991; 

Bouchaud, 1991; Nixon and Mangold, 1998; Önsoy B. and Salman A. 2005), 

maturation (Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1989; Richard, 1971), aquaculture (Hanley et al., 

1998; Pascual, 1978), diet (Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1992; Blanc et al., 1999; 

Koueta and Boucaud-Camou, 1999; Domingues et al., 2001a; Koueta et al.,2002) and 

external factors (Palmegiano and D’apote, 1983; Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; 

Domingues et al., 2001b). However, in spite of its economic importance in the Ria de 

Aveiro (Docapesca - Statistical Department, 2013), this species has not yet received 

consistent scientific attention, the information 

is scarce and only one study by Jorge and 

Sobral (2004) gave some information about 

species biology in Ria de Aveiro. 

The aim of this research is to improve the 

knowledge on the population structure of 

Sepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro (abundance, 

biomass (total weight), length, distribution of 

sex and maturity stages); to describe the diet 

of Sepia officinalis in Ria de Aveiro and the 

reproductive cycle of S. officinalis, in Ria de 

Aveiro lagoon. 

 

II.3. Materials and methods 

II.3.1. Study Area 

Ria de Aveiro is a coastal lagoon (Figure II.1), 

also mentioned by others author as a ‘‘bar-

built estuary’’ (Dias, 2001). It is located in the 

northwestern (40º38´N, 8º44´W) coast of 

Portugal. The system can be subdivided into 

channels that, due to specific characteristics, 

can be regarded as independent estuaries 

connected to a common outlet. In general, the 

Figure II.1 - Sampling sites of S. 

officinalis: Ria de Aveiro (Adapted 

from Valentim et al., 2013). 

 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 70 

most common typology is one of extensive intertidal zones, namely mud flats and salt 

marshes, with the exception of the central area of the lagoon (Pastorinho et al., 2012). 

Sampling sites were selected based on a geographic distribution taking into account the 

whole area of the lagoon. ARE, at the end of Mira channel (the Southern site); BAR 

near the entrance of the lagoon; SJA near the entrance of the lagoon in the initial part of 

S. Jacinto channel; POR within the harbour; GAF situated in the vicinity of a deep-sea 

fishing port and dry-docks; TOR an intermediate region of the longest channel (S. 

Jacinto-Ovar channel); RIO located in the terminal area of the main freshwater course, 

the Vouga river; LAR in the proximity of the chlor-alkali plant (6 km); CAR located in 

the terminal area of the S. Jacinto channel (the Northern site) and VAG located at the 

edge of Ílhavo channel. 

 

II.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection 

Sampling was made monthly, from July 2001 to December 2002 with bottom trawl and 

from March 2003 to December 2003 with a trammel network (Table II-I). In the years 

of 2001 and 2002, samples were collected in 10 sites of Ria de Aveiro (Figure II.1). The 

reason to use two different types of networks was the necessity of capturing cuttlefishes 

of all maturity stages, to have a representative structure of the population. A total of 295 

cuttlefishes were captured. 

 

II.3.3. Abiotic parameters 

The abiotic parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, turbidity 

and depth were registered on each capture. Temperature (± 0.1 ºC) and dissolved 

oxygen (± 0.01 mg.l
-1

) were recorded with an oxygen meter (Consort Z621), the pH (± 

0.01) with pH meter (WTW 330/set – 2), the salinity (± 0.1) with a refractometer 

(Atago), the turbidity (± 0.1 m) was recorded with a Secchi disc and the depth (± 0.1m) 

with a handmade probe (Table A. 1 - Appendix). 

 

II.3.4. Biological parameters 

Dorsal mantle length (DML, size), total weight (Wt), the wet weight of the gonad (WG), 

and for females the wet weight of the nidamental glands, the sex and a maturity stage 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 71 

were determined in each individual. The number of individuals, mantle length and body 

weight of each site are given in Table II-I. 

To determine the relationship between DML and Wt for males and females the 

parameters of the equation Wt = a DML
b
 were estimated. A standard 5-point scale of 

sexual maturity for S. officinalis was used (adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 

1984), in which stage I is “immature”, stage II is “developing”, stage III is ”maturing”, 

and stage IV is “ripe”. Specimens with no visible gonad development were classified as 

“juveniles” (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in maturity stage I. 

 

II.3.5. Trophic ecology parameters 

The analysis of gut contents was made with use of binocular lens, by separating prey by 

their different taxa, and being the identification of their taxonomic level made according 

to the digestion level. 

The prey´s identification was not made with the aim of reaching their specie, because it 

was considered that such precision was not necessary, and they were only identified to 

the lower taxonomic category possible. Other studies also suggest that it is not 

necessary to reach the species according to the proposed objectives (Windell and 

Bowen, 1978; Oliveira, 1997). Reaching the specie identification is a complex and time 

consuming task that would not add significant information.  

The identified preys were counted by taxa for each gut. The counting process was a 

difficult lengthy operation, as they were frequently disarticulated, and therefore it was 

decided to choose fragments that existed individually on each prey of a certain tax, as 

they might be considered diagnostic features. 

The unidentified material was classified as detritus, and counted as a single item, by 

each structure were it was identified as proposed by Madenjian et al. (1996). The 

different types of algae and marine angiospermae found, independently of the number 

of fragments, were counted as a unique feed component, being inserted as Vegetable. 

After their identification and counting by taxa, preys were preserved in 70% alcohol 

(ethanol) (Windell and Bowen, 1978). 

Wet weight (WWt) was determined for the different preys by taxonomic group in a 4 

decimal places scale. Several authors use WWt instead of the dry weight (DWt), which 

is the most accurate measure to use in the weight coefficient (Cw %) (Hynes, 1950; 

Windell and Bowen, 1978) and it is known that both are strongly correlated (Glenn and 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 72 

Ward, 1968). Prior to the identification ash-free dry weight (AFDW) was obtained after 

24h in an oven at 60ºC.  

Detritus were not used on later analysis, as performed by other authors (Caragitsou and 

Papaconstatinou, 1994; Capitolo et al., 1995). 

All biologic characteristics obtained from the monthly sampling campaigns were 

recorded as well as the ash-free dry weight (AFDW). 

 

II.3.6. Data analysis 

II.3.6.1. Abiotic data analysis 

Principal Component analysis (PCA) was performed, using the CANOCO software 

package for Windows, version 4.5 (Ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002) to assess the 

variability of abiotic parameters measured during the study period (2001-2003) in the 

different sampling sites. 

 

II.3.6.2. Biological data analysis 

The length at which 50% of cuttlefish were mature was determined for females and 

males. The percentage of sexually mature individuals (PM), for each sex (maturity 

stages III and IV) caught during sampling were determined by fitting the following 

logistic model:  

   
    

         
 , where SFM is the size at first maturation. 

An index of sexual development was calculated using the gonadosomatic index (GSI), 

which is defined as  

    
  

       
    , was estimated for season and maturity stage. 

The sex-ratio was calculated for each season. Seasons were defined as follow: 

Winter = January – March. Spring = April – June 

Summer = July – September. Autumn = October – December. 

The comparison of allometric relationships between males and females were tested 

using ANCOVA (Zar, 1999). Redundancy Analysis (RDA), a technique that falls 

between multiple regression and canonical correlation analysis (Sparks et al., 1999), 

was performed using the CANOCO software package for windows, version 4.5 to 

assess effects of biological factors on S. officinalis in the three years of sampling and in 

sites sampling. The significance of RDA was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 73 

test using routines built into the software package. A complete description of the 

method is provided in Van den Brink et al. (2003). Differences on the gonadosomatic 

index (GSI) for seasons and sites were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test using 

MINITAB® Release 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. The 

deviations from 1:1 sex ratio were assessed using chi-square test by Sigmaplot 10. 

 

II.3.6.3. Diet analysis 

 

Gut content analysis method 

To analyse the gut contents three methods were used: 

 Numeric method; 

 Occurrence (or frequency) method; 

 Gravimetric (or volumetric) method. 

These methods can be complemented by other “mixed” methods (data interaction 

between two or more of the base methods referred), as well as indexes and additional 

information that could help on the diet characterization. 

They produce accurate results, both at individual and conjugated level.  

 

Numerical method (CN %) 

The total number of individuals of a certain taxa is expresses as a percentage of the total 

number of preys (Hynes, 1950; Pillay, 1952; Hyslop, 1980; Bowen, 1983; Valente, 

1992): 

   
 

 
     

Where n – total number of preys of a certain taxa; N – total number of preys. 

Problems associated with this method and their specific resolution was previously 

referred in Materials and methods. 

 

Gravimetric method (Cw %) 

The weight estimation of each taxa (in fresh or dry) is calculated as a percentage of the 

total weight of the contents (Pillay, 1952; Hyslop, 1980; Bowen, 1983):  

   
 

 
     

Where w – total wet weight of the preys of a certain taxa; W – Wet weight of all preys. 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 74 

Gravimetric method gives a reasonable estimate of the preys weight, being easy to apply 

when residues are high (Valente, 1992) overvaluing the individual contribution of heavy 

taxa (George and Hadley, 1979). 

 

Occurrence method 

In this method, the number of individuals in which a determined item occurs is 

expressed in terms of frequency of the total number of guts sampled (Hynes, 1950; 

Pillay, 1952, 1983; Hyslop, 1980; Valente, 1992): 

   
 

 
     

Where f – number of guts where a certain taxa is present; F – Total number of full guts 

observed. 

This method can be used as an interspecific competition indicator. If CF% exceeds 25% 

in two or more predators, competition is possible (Hyslop, 1980). It is also considered 

useful on the determination of seasonal variations of diet composition (Frost, 1977; 

Pedley and Jones, 1978), as food selectivity by the predator and as an availability index 

of a certain food (Herrán, 1988). 

 

Feed coefficient (Q) 

The feed coefficient, by combining more than one method, is considered a mixed 

method (Herrán, 1988). Thus it allows a good analysis of the relative importance of 

different preys of a certain animal, by taking into account their contribution in weight 

and number (Hureau, 1970):  

            

Depending on the Q value, three categories were defined (Hureau, 1970): 

 Q&lt;20 – Occasional preys; 

 20&lt;Q&lt;200 – Secondary preys; 

 Q&gt;200 – Preferential preys. 

 

Statistical analysis 

Differences in AFDW of gut contents between sampling sites and the food types were 

assessed using the GLM module of Minitab 16 (Minitab Inc., 2010). Prior to the 

analysis the data was check for normality and homoscedasticity using the Anderson 

Darling Test and the Levene test, respectively. To correct for deviations to normality 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 75 

and heteroscedasticity AFDW was transformed using the log(X+1) transformation prior 

to further analysis. Specific size differences associated with the diet were assessed using 

the eviscerated weight of the individuals as a covariate. Whenever significant 

differences associated with a given factor were found the Tukey post hoc test was 

applied to identify differences between levels. All statistical analysis was carried out for 

a significance level of 0.05.

of individuals (n), mantle length (mm) and total weight (g)) by year of capture. 

 

 

II.4. Results 

II.4.1. Abiotic parameters 

PCA analysis showed that most of the variability is associated with the first two axes 

(76.1%), and the rest of the axis only explained 23.9%. The PCA analysis of abiotic 

parameters within different years of capture in Ria de Aveiro (Figure II.2; a)) was made 

assuming the existence of annual variation. However, the analysis showed that the 

differences in abiotic parameters didn’t lead to differences in between years. A good 

overlap of the three years of sampling was observed (Figure II.2; a)). Having this fact in 

mind, the analysis of three years of catches can be done together and the variation of 

abiotic parameters was not related to months but to sites of sampling (Figure II.2; b)). 

The PCA analysis of abiotic parameters within different sites of capture in Ria de 

Aveiro (Figure II.2; b)) showed that the main two factors that affected S. officinalis

were salinity and depths (Figure II.2; a) and b)). Indeed the only site where the 

cuttlefish was not caught was Areão (ARE), which was the site that presented the lowest 

values of salinity and depth (Figure II.3 and Figure II.4). ARE presented salinity values 

between 3 and 26, being the mean value 11 ± 6 (average ± SD) and depths of 1.21 ± 

0.35 m (average ± SD). Vagos (VAG) presented wide–range of salinity amplitudes that 

also influenced the number of cuttlefishes captured (Table II-I). VAG presented salinity 

values between 1 and 37, being the mean value 21 ± 9 (average ± SD). These two 

sampling sites, ARE and VAG, are included in the dashed ellipsoid area of the PCA 

biplot (Figure II.2; b)) and were sites where the sampling method was only the bottom 

trawl, because they had no adequate conditions for the trammel network.

with the individual captured on each site (Table II-I), it is possible to state that cuttlefish 

prefers higher depths, what may also justify the inexistence of individuals caught on 

Areão. 

 

II.4.2. Weight-length relationship 

Both males and females showed allometric growth (Figure II.5), and the analysis of 

covariance (ANCOVA) of log transformed length and weight data showed a significant 

difference between the growth pattern of males and females (p&lt;0.05).  

 

 

Figure II.5 – Length-weight relationship of female (red squares) and male (blue rhombus) of the S. 

officinalis captured in the Ria de Aveiro. 

Regression lines were not coincident (ANCOVA: F2, 148= 3.154; p=0.046). Slopes did 

not differ significantly (t148=0.974; p=0.332), but intercepts differed significantly 

(t148=2.315; p=0.022). For both sex the values obtained for slope (b) was lower than 3, 

corresponding to a negative allometry (b&lt;3), confirming a higher increase of length 

compared to weight. Although the slope (b) of the two curves was not significantly 

different (Table II-II), the female regression presented a higher slope when compared to 

the male regression. Smaller individuals have a similar total weight, but for individuals 

greater than 82.4 mm, females were heavier than males (Figure II.5).

II.4.3. Distribution patterns 

From the 295 cuttlefishes analysed: 89 were females, ranging from 28 mm to 190 mm; 

105 were male, ranging from 27 mm to 208 mm; and 143 were indeterminate, from 17 

mm to 67.3 mm ML. Figure II.6 shows that the frequency of individuals caught by 

mantle length class, sampled with the same network (2001 and 2002), present a similar 

structure distribution. This result was also verified with the RDA analysis along the 

years of sampling, which presented no significant differences for sex, sites and maturity 

stages (p&gt;0.05). In fact, when DML (mm) was removed from the analysis, the RDA 

revealed no significant difference in the S. officinalis distribution between sex and 

maturity stages (p&gt;0.05), indicating that the difference was a consequence of network 

caught.  

The highest abundance was registered in summer (225 individuals) and the lowest 

abundance was registered in winter (only, 3 individuals) (Figure II.7). The central part 

of the lagoon (near the mouth) was the most abundant in cuttlefish, while the most 

Northerly and Southerly sites presented the lowest abundance in this species. This fact 

is related to abiotic parameters (Figure II.2, b)), since sampling sites located within the 

limits of the Ria de Aveiro showed the lowest values of salinity. The highest biomass 

values were recorded in spring and summer (13 and 18 Kg, respectively) and the highest 

value by sampling site was obtained in POR (14.1 Kg) (Figure II.7).

sampling. 

 

The abiotic parameters provide the colonization of the lagoon by cuttlefish practically 

throughout all the year, although with marked fluctuations in abundance. During 

summer the cuttlefish appears with more frequency in the lagoon (Figure II.7), and the 

cuttlefish population is comprised by males, females and immature individuals (Figure 

II.6 and Figure II.8). In terms of sexual maturation, the dominant stage of cuttlefish 

observed was predominantly the immature stage of gonadal development, which 

reinforces the young character of cuttlefish population in the lagoon (Figure II.6 and 

Figure II.8).

Figure II.7 - Number of individuals (N) and total weight (Kg) for seasons and sites sampling, for 

the three years of sampling. 

Cuttlefish captured in Ria de Aveiro belonging to first maturity stage (I) presented DML 

between 15.3 to 73.9 mm; developing maturity stage (II) presented values between 44.6 

and 115.6 mm; maturing stage (III) ranged from 82.7 to 185.0 mm and ripe cuttlefish 

(IV) ranged between 78.0 and 208.0 mm. The analysis of the percentage of individuals 

per maturity stage along the three consecutive years of sampling (Figure II.8) showed 

that: large cuttlefish, higher than 82.7 mm, enter the Ria in spring; during summer and 

autumn the smaller individuals (stage I and II) dominate, however the expression of 

mature individuals in summer is still very high; in winter the abundance of S. officinalis 

in the Ria is strongly reduced. This fact suggests that the development of the cuttlefish 

born in Ria de Aveiro is mainly made offshore, what could justify the absence of 

maturing individuals during the autumn (Figure II.8). The absence of mature specimens 

after the spawning season (spring and summer) suggests that cuttlefish does not survive 

after spawning (Figure II.8). The spawning occurs in the late spring and early summer. 

With the exception of Carregal (CAR), in all other sites of Ria de Aveiro, ripe 

individuals were present (Figure II.8). However, by making a seasonal analysis, it was 

possible to observe that mature individuals were only captured in spring and summer 

(Figure II.8).

II.4.4. Reproduction strategies 

As stated above the cuttlefish enters the Ria de Aveiro in spring and summer for 

reproduction, and returns offshore with winter. Immature females ranged between 28 

mm and 73.9 mm, and developing specimens ranged between 45.2 mm and 114.6 mm. 

Maturing females were caught with mantle length from 122.1mm to 185.0 mm, and 

females in ripe conditions varied from 106.4 mm to 190.0 mm. Immature males were 

found from 27.3 mm to 106.9 mm, while specimens in developing stage ranged between 

44.6 mm and 109 mm. Maturing males were caught with mantle length ranged from 

82.7 to 130 mm, and males in ripe conditions varied from 78 mm to 208 mm. From the 

295 cuttlefishes caught in Ria de Aveiro, 89 were females and 105 were males, 

significant differences in the GSI values were obtained between seasons for both 

females (H = 29.6, P&lt;0.001) and males (H = 54.9, P&lt;0.001). Females showed high GSI 

values from April to July, noticing greater increase from April to June and a marked 

decrease from June to July (Figure II.9). The females caught in June had the higher GSI 

of the study period, and the principal maturity stage of the females in that month 

belongs to the third maturity stage (III), the developing stage. A similar pattern was 

noticed for males, with higher GSI index in June, although these values were 

considerably lower than those registered for females (Figure II.9). Significant 

differences in the GSI values were obtained between maturity stages for both females 

(H = 52.2, P&lt;0.001) and males (H = 73.2, P&lt;0.001). GSI increased according to 

maturity stage in females and males (Figure II.9), although a slight decrease was 

observed from stage III to stage IV, for both sexes.

Length at first maturity was estimated as 146.9 ± 0.8 mm DML for females and 91.4 ± 

0.9 mm DML for males (Figure II.10). A total of 89 females and 105 males were caught 

in Ria de Aveiro, which corresponds to a sex ratio of 46% for females and 54% for 

females. The values obtained do not differ significantly from the ratio 1:1 (?

stomachs, followed by Portunidae n.i., Pomatoschistus microps, and Mysidacea n.i.,

Figure II.11 shows a very strong correlation between AFDW (g) and WWt (g), indeed 

AFDW (g) is about 10% of the WWt (g). Due to the strong correlation between these 

two parameters, for the statistical analysis we used AFDW (g) instead the WWt (g), 

once this measured is independent of the percentage of humidity of each type of food

II.5. Discussion 

The Ria de Aveiro, similar to other coastal estuarine lagoons (Leeuwen et al., 1994; 

Elliot and Hemingway, 2002), is a system highly influenced by abiotic variations, which 

affect the recruitment and the survival of several species (Rebelo, 1992; Pombo and 

Rebelo, 2002). S. officinalis presented a wide dispersion in the Ria de Aveiro, where 

Areão (ARE), southern site of the lagoon, in the Mira channel, was the only site of the 

lagoon where cuttlefish was not found. Depth and salinity were the two main external 

factors affecting the spatial distribution of the cuttlefish in the lagoon. ARE could 

represent the minimum quota in terms of salinity and depths for cuttlefish presence. 

Other authors referred that cuttlefish tolerate values of salinity between 25 (Palmegiano 

and D’Apote, 1983) and 38 (Boletzky, 1983). Several authors referred that external 

parameters such as salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc. affect the 

development of the Sepia officinalis life cycle (Palmegiano and D’apote, 1983; 

Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; Domingues et al., 2001b). Temperature clearly plays a 

major role in determining the life span of S. officinalis (Richard, 1971; Forsythe et al. 

1991, 1994). Indeed, the Cuttlefish abundance in Ria de Aveiro lagoon starts to increase 

in April, when water temperature begins to increase and reproduction is triggered. In 

autumn, adults seem to disappear. This behavior could result from the mass mortality 

after spawning or the return of adults to sea. The pattern of migration found in Ria de 

Aveiro is in accordance to Richard (1971), Boletzky (1983) and Martins (1990). S. 

officinalis migrates inshore in spring and summer and move offshore in autumn. During 

the warm seasons (spring and summer), cuttlefish migrates to coastal waters, where 

physical conditions are more stable than offshore and food availability is higher. In late 

autumn, when temperature begins to decrease, cuttlefish migrates offshore and almost 

disappears from the lagoon. Abundance was much higher in summer then in autumn, 

while spring presented the higher biomass. This abundance pattern presented in the Ria 

de Aveiro is in accordance with other geographical areas, like the English Channel 

(Dunn, 1999; Wang et al., 2003; Challier et al., 2005); the Estuary of Sado in Setubal 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 87 

(Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009) and the French coast (Morbihan Bay) (Blanc et al., 

1998).  

The spawning season (spring and summer) found in this study was the same as the one 

determined for the Estuary of Sado (Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009), but different to 

Guerra and Castro (1988) in Ria de Vigo and to Jorge and Sobral (2004) for Ria de 

Aveiro. In both studies mature individuals were found throughout the year. In this 

studied the immature individuals dominate along the year suggesting a very young 

population of cuttlefish. Jorge and Sobral (2004) reported two spawning seasons for Ria 

the Aveiro, one more representative in June and August and other in February and 

October, however in this studied only one was evidenced.  

The stable conditions found in Ria de Aveiro during spring and summer months, and the 

high diversity of habitats and high prey availability represent good conditions for 

reproduction, especially for smaller individuals. The development of juveniles and the 

differences between individuals are really dependent on the environmental conditions 

(Challier et al., 2002; Dunn, 1999; Domingues et al., 2002; Koueta and Boucaud-

Camou, 2003). Individuals that are born in the lagoon during summer are likely to grow 

faster, reaching maturity at lower age (compared to those born in the coastal zone), and 

becoming mature for reproduction in their first year. Individuals born in other seasons 

will have poorer conditions for a rapid growth and will probably reach maturity at older 

ages. This phenomenon is apparently related with the time interval spent at higher 

temperatures (Domingues et al., 2001b).  

Males reach sexual maturity before the females (Gauvrit et al., 1997) being usually 

smaller than females (Pinczon du Sel and Daguzan, 1997). In the North Atlantic, 

cuttlefish can mature before one year old, although many individuals mature during 

their second year of life (Gauvrit et al., 1997). Several studies reported the first length 

of ripe individuals for males and females (Table II-V). All the studies presented a lower 

first length for maturity for males than females with the exception of Jorge and Sobral 

(2004). The value obtained in this work is much similar with the values presented in 

Mediterranean (Mangold-Wirz, 1963), in Golfo de Tunes (Ezzedine-Najal, 1984) and in 

south Brittany (Le Goff and Daguzan, 1991), being higher than Guerra and Castro 

(1988), in Ria de Vigo, Önsoy and Salman (2005), in Aegean Sea and Neves et al. 

(2009), in Estuary of Sado and much lower than Dunn et al. (1999), in the English 

Channel. 



Chapter II 

| P a g e 88 

Table II-V – Mean values (mm) of first length in ripe individuals for males and females, in 

cuttlefish from the literature. 

 

 

Several authors referred that temperature is determinant in Sepia officinalis 

development (Palmegiano and D’apote, 1983; Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; 

Domingues et al., 2001b) since it is a poikilothermic (Forsythe and Van Heukelen, 

1987), so the differences found in the first maturity length of cuttlefish in those referred 

areas could be the result of differences in water temperature.  

The length-weight relationship in this studied showed that, females are heavier than 

males for individuals larger than 82.4 mm. Dunn (1999) and Neves et al. (2009) found 

the same relationship, females became heavier than males at 106 mm and 108mm in 

Sado Estuary and English channel, respectively. The differences between males and 

females weight-length relationship could be due to different sexual developments, since 

this development has a bigger importance for females than males (Dunn, 1999). For 

same sex, the differences could result from other factors like quantity and quality of diet 

and temperature of water (Mangold-Wirz, 1963; Hatfield, 2000; Domingues et al., 

2001b). 

Other authors reported the occurrence of two breeder generations during the spawning 

period, which are recognized by their mantle length (Mangold-Wirz, 1963; Le Goff and 

Daguzan, 1991; Gauvrit et al., 1997; Dunn et al., 1999; Önsoy and Salman, 2005). 

Considering Le Goff and Daguzan (1991), breeders in first year of life presented an 

average of mantle length of 134 mm for males and 148 mm for females, while breeders 

of second year showed approximately 220 mm ML, for both sexes. According to these 

values, all mature individuals presented in this study were in their first year of life.

In Ria de Aveiro, only one breeding generation was found, with an average of 98 mm 

DML in females and 99 mm DML in males, which is in accordance to Jorge and Sobral 

(2004), which referred that both males and females reach their maturity approximately 

with 90 mm of DML. 

The present study showed that Sepia officinalis feeds preferentially from Portunidae 

(crabs) and fish, this is in accordance with other authors like Alves et al. (2006); Castro 

and Guerra, 1990 and Pinczon du Sel et al. (2000). Several other taxa appears as 

occasional preys e.g. amphipods, worms, isopods, which was also referred in other 

studies (Castro and Guerra, 1990; Najai and Ktari, 1979). Differences in terms of 

importance of prey items in feeding habits of cuttlefish, as well the presence of more 

species, are probably consequences of different habitats, predator size and number of 

analysed guts (Castro and Guerra, 1990; Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000). Cannibalism was 

occasionally referred by Najai and Ktari (1979); Castro and Guerra, 1990), which is in 

accordance with this study. Predators that feed on a wide variety of preys from different 

habitats have a generalist diet as well as opportunistic, attacking all prey within the 

physical capability of the predator (Hughes, 1980). Opportunistic predation is typical of 

cephalopods (Boucher-Rodoni et al., 1987). In this study, due to the wide range of preys 

found in the diet of Sepia officinalis, the assumptions refered above do apply to 

cuttlefish of the Aveiro lagoon. 

 

II.6. Conclusions 

Further studies in Ria de Aveiro and adjacent coastal waters would be needed to better 

understand the reproductive life cycle of S. officinalis on the north Portuguese coast and 

to understand the differences on the reproductive strategies of cuttlefish with other 

geographical regions of the world.

III. Accumulation of metals in common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in a temperate 

lagoon 

 

III.1. Abstract 

Concentrations of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) metals were 

determined in the tissues (mantle and digestive gland) of 53 individuals of the common 

cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), captured in six different sites in the Ria de 

Aveiro from March to December of 2003. Over decades, these types of marine 

ecosystems have been subject to discharges of effluents as a result of industrial and 

harbour activities, as well as urban and agricultural wastes. In this study, like other 

European studies on cephalopods, metal concentrations in digestive gland were much 

higher than those found in mantle, which suggests that digestive gland is the target 

organ for storage of these elements, acting as a detoxification organ. Size, sex and 

season don´t interfere with metal concentration. The metal concentrations obtained in 

each analysed tissue follow the gradient: Zn&gt;Fe&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Pb. The results suggest a 

gradient of contamination in the direction of Laranjo. However, in terms of metal 

concentrations, the Ria de Aveiro can be divided in two distinct regions, the first one 

comprising the site LAR, and the second one including all the others. All individuals 

captured in LAR presented levels of Cd in mantle higher than the limit proposed for 

human consumption (1 µg g
-1 

wet weight). For Pb the most problematic area is TOR 

presenting almost all the values higher than the limit for human consumption (1 µg g
-1 

wet weight). Cadmium is positively correlated with Cu in the digestive gland of the 

specimens collected in Ria de Aveiro. The ratios of Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu presented 

significant differences in the different sites of sampling.

III.2. Introduction 

Cephalopods eat a great variety of organisms, being carnivorous opportunistic predators 

with very high growth efficiency, and a rapid maturation that is followed by a single 

spawning season and, with few exceptions, an early death (Boyle, 1990). They are also 

consumed in large quantities by higher trophic levels, such as mammals, seabirds and 

fish, which support the idea that cephalopods are potentially capable of supporting 

significantly increased levels of exploitation (Boyle, 1990). For this reason this group of 

marine molluscs are considered as key species in several marine ecosystems 

(Amaratunga, 1983; Rodhouse, 1989; Bustamante, 2002). 

Cephalopods are known for their ability to accumulate high levels of essential elements 

to metabolic functions as well as non-essential elements (Martin and Flegal, 1975; 

Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 1998a, b, 2000; Raimundo et al., 

2004). Furthermore, metal levels in cephalopods, which are extensively fished and 

consumed by humans, are also of direct concern for public health (Bustamante et al., 

2004). Various studies have reported metal concentrations in cephalopods from several 

regions such as Smith et al., (1984); Miramand and Bentley, (1992); Bustamante et al., 

(2000); Raimundo et al., (2005); Pereira et al., (2009). At Ria de Aveiro only one study 

(Pereira et al., 2009) addressed this issue, but it is based in a narrow site selection and 

didn´t explore the spatial variability, that may be relevant due to the presence of 

industrial contaminated effluents.  

Sediments in coastal systems, which are surrounded by urbanized and industrialized 

areas, may contain high quantities of metals that may become available to benthic 

organisms and eventually transferred to upper levels, thus affecting the marine food 

chain (Bryan and Langston, 1992; Lee and Luoma, 1998; Warren et al., 1998), or be 

remobilized when sediments are dredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., 

1998). The Ria de Aveiro is a shallow productive coastal lagoon, located on the west 

coast of Portugal, with a complex network of inner channels into which industrial and 

domestic effluents have been discharged for many years (Hall, 1982). Cuttlefish, Sepia 

officinalis, is economically important target specie for Portuguese fisheries (Serrano, 

1992). Taking into account the economic importance of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and 

the absence of reported information about metal concentrations in closed and 

anthropogenic influenced ecosystems, like Ria the Aveiro, the present study proposed

the assessment of metal concentrations in cuttlefish from several locations of the inner 

part of the Ria de Aveiro.  

 

III.3. Materials and methods 

III.3.1. Study Area  

The Ria de Aveiro (40°38´N, 8°44´W) 

(Figure III.1) is a very important coastal 

system in the Portuguese west coast, with an 

adjacent area of about 250 km
2
 (Picado et 

al., 2010).  The lagoon has a maximum 

width of 10 km and its length measured 

along the longitudinal axis is 45 km (Dias 

and Lopes, 2006). The average depth of the 

lagoon compared to the mean sea level is 

about 3 m, although the inlet channel can 

exceed 28 m deep, due to dredging 

operations that are regularly carried out to 

allow the navigation (Picado et al., 2010). 

This coastal ecosystem is permanently 

connected to the sea (350 m width) and was 

first stabilized by man (Plecha et al., 2007). 

The hydrodynamics of the lagoon is 

essentially dominated by tidal currents 

entering its mouth (Hall et al., 1985; Dias et 

al., 2000; Lopes and Dias, 2007) which are 

responsible for the mixes of freshwater and 

seawater. Rivers have small overall 

contribution in terms of water inputs, when compared with the tidal prism, but have a 

long-term influence in the residual transport (Lopes and Dias, 2007). The four major 

rivers converging to the Ria are Vouga and Antuã Rivers from the East, Caster River 

from the North and Boco River from the Southeast. The fresh water input in a spring 

tide is estimated in 1.8 x 10
6
 m

3

major freshwater input comes from the Vouga River (50m

River (5m

 average flow). The Vouga River contributes with around 2/3 of the 

fluvial water entering the lagoon (Moreira et al., 1993; Dias et al., 1999).  

In terms of sediments quality, the lagoon receives considerable flows of raw and treated 

wastewater. Three main sources of pollution are apparent: organic and chemical 

pollution from paper-pulp factories (in rivers Vouga and Caima); chemical pollution, 

particularly mercury, from the industrial area of Estarreja (in Laranjo), and microbial 

contaminants from the urban sewage effluent and cattle raising areas (Ílhavo channel, 

Vouga river and Ovar channel) (Lima, 1986; Lucas et al., 1986; Borrego et al., 1994; 

Pastorinho et al., 2012).  

 

III.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection 

A total of 53 cuttlefishes, S. officinalis, were caught monthly with a network trammel, 

from March 2003 to December 2003, at six sites (Figure III.1): near the mouth of the 

lagoon (BAR, POR and GAF); in the main freshwater section, highly organically 

enriched (RIO); in a contaminated area, result of industrial pollution (LAR), and 

approximately in the middle of the longest channel (TOR). The abiotic parameters such 

as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, turbidity and depth were registered on 

each capture. Temperature (± 0.1 ºC) and dissolved oxygen (± 0.01 mg.l
-1

) were 

recorded with an oxygen meter (Consort Z621), the pH (± 0.01) with pH meter (WTW 

330/set – 2), the salinity (± 0.1) with a refractometer (Atago), the turbidity (± 0.1 m) 

was recorded with a Secchi disc and the depth (± 0.1m) with a handmade probe. Dorsal 

mantle length (DML, size), total weight (Wt), sex and maturity stage were determined 

for each individual. All individuals were included in an allometric relationship between 

total weight (g) and mantle length (mm) (Figure III.2). The number of individuals (n), 

wet weight range (g), size range (mm), sex and maturity stage from each site is given in 

Table III-II. A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. officinalis was used 

(adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984), in which stage I is “immature”, 

stages II-III are ”maturing”, and stages IV-V are “mature”. Specimens with no visible 

gonad development were classified as “juveniles” (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in 

maturity stage 1. Specimens were stored in individual plastic bags and immediately 

frozen, in order to minimize mobilization of metals between organs (Martin and Flegal, 

1975). In the laboratory, the digestive gland of each specimen was totally removed

under defrost conditions, without rupture of the outer membrane, and weighted. 

Samples of mantle free from skin and inner membrane were also taken.  

 

III.3.3. Analysis of metals 

Tissue samples were lyophilised and homogenised. Approximately 200 mg of the dry 

tissue was digested with a mixture of HNO3 (sp, 65% v/v) and H2O2 (sp, 30% v/v) at 

different temperatures according to the method described in Ferreira et al. (1990). All 

laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (20%) for 2 days and rinsed with Milli-Q water 

to avoid contamination. The selection of the analytical methodology and apparatus to 

use in metal quantification was determined by metal concentration present in the tissues. 

Quantification of Fe, Zn and Cu in mantle and digestive gland and Cd in digestive gland 

was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) 

while quantification of Cd in mantle and Pb in the mantle and digestive gland were 

analysed using ICP-MS. The accuracy of the analytical methods was assessed by the 

analysis of international certificate standards: DORM-1, DORM-2 (dogfish muscle) and 

TORT-1, TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas) (National Research Council of Canada). 

Blanks and standard references materials were run together with samples. The values 

obtained and the certificated values do not differ significantly (p&lt;0.05) (Table III-I). 

Concentration of metal was expressed relative to both the dry weight (µg g
-1

 DWt) and 

the wet weight of the tissue (µg g
-1

 WWt). The dry weight values are used for statistical 

analysis, to eliminate any effects of varying moisture content while the wet weight is 

used for calculating risks associated with consumption of cuttlefish tissue (Pierce et al., 

2008). The values in wet weight were calculated with the percentage of humidity of 

each tissue. Under our analysis conditions, the detection limits (µg g
-1

) were: 4.2 (Fe); 

0.50 (Zn), 1.2 (Cu), 0.089 (for Cd in Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) and 0.0055 (for Cd in 

ICP-MS) and 0.0040 (Pb). Precision varied between 1 and 8%.

 dry weight). 

 

 

III.3.4. Statistical analysis 

Specific weight metal concentrations were calculated as a function of dry weight. 

Normality of data and homogeneity of variance were tested using the Anderson-Darling 

test and Levene´s test, respectively. Whenever significant deviations from normality and 

homoscedasticity were found, data was log-transformed prior to further statistical 

analysis to correct those deviations. For each metal, statistical comparisons between 

sites, and sex were performed using a two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey 

comparisons, whenever significant differences were found. Pairing site and season was 

also used to assess seasonality effects using a two way ANOVA. Statistical testing was 

carried out with MINITAB® Release 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for 

all tests. Redundancy Analysis (RDA), a technique that falls between multiple 

regression and canonical correlation analysis (Sparks et al., 1999), was performed using 

the CANOCO software package for windows, version 4.5 to assess effects of 

environmental conditions on metal content. The significance of RDA was tested using a 

Monte Carlo permutation test using routines built into the software package. A complete 

description of the method is provided in Van den Brink et al. (2003).

mesh sizes were 80 mm. The relationship between size and weight of all cuttlefishes 

analysed showed a strong geometrical relationship (r=0.95, n=53, p&lt;0.05), 

independently of maturation stage (Figure III.2), and site location (Table III-III). 

Furthermore, the mature stage includes a broad range of size, including individuals from 

108 to 208 mm.

 wet weight (WWt) [COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Nº 629/2008 of 2 July 

2008]. The average amounts of Cd in muscle of S. officinalis, (i.e. the tissue 

predominantly used for human consumption) were below this threshold, with average 

levels of Cd of 0.36 µg g
-1

 DWt, with the exception of specimens captured in LAR and 

a single individual of Rio that also presented a value higher than the limit proposed. 

However, the value of Cd in mantle of cuttlefish from LAR was particularly high when 

compared with values from other sampling sites, which presented a maximum of 

0.44±0.53 µg g

 DWt for RIO. The same occurs with Pb for GAF and TOR which 

presented values of 1.1±2.4 µg g

BAR (Table III-III).  

For mantle, there was no significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between seasons. The 

statistical comparisons of metal concentrations in the mantle between sites and sex of 

the individuals (Table III-IV) showed that no significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were 

observed between males and females for all metals. However, differences between sites 

were observed for: Fe in TOR where the value was significantly higher than on the 

other sites; Zn in LAR and GAF were significantly different from RIO, POR and BAR; 

and Cd levels in LAR which presented a noteworthy value that was significantly 

different from the other sites.

different sites in Ria de Aveiro are presented Table III-III. The essential metals 

presented higher values than the non-essential metals, similarly to the mantle. Zn was 

the most abundant, reaching 1822±428 µg g

remained similar (p&lt;0.05), however, between sites, metal concentrations in the 

digestive gland were different (p&lt;0.05), and sites near the industrial area presented 

higher values than the farthest ones (Table III-IV). 

The innermost sites presented higher metal concentrations than the sites near the mouth 

of the lagoon. Indeed the site LAR which is a problematic site of pollution presented the 

highest values of all the metals (with the exception of Cd and Cu) in the digestive gland. 

Torreira (TOR) was the second site showing high levels of concentration of all the 

metals (Table III-III). The rest of the lagoon presented a similar distribution of metals 

with the exception of Cd in the POR that presented very high value in comparison with 

others sites. For sex, only Fe and Cd showed significant (p&lt;0.05) differences (Table 

III-IV), and for both metals, higher concentrations were found on females.

III.4.4. Metal concentration mantle vs digestive gland 

Metal concentration in mantle and digestive gland in all sites, was significantly different 

(p&lt;0.05). As expected the concentrations in the digestive gland were higher, indicating 

that these metals are preferentially accumulated in this organ. Depending on the 

sampling site, the values in digestive gland varied between one and three orders of 

magnitude above the mantle values (Table III-III and Figure III.3) for almost all metals 

studied. 

 

III.4.5. Relationships between Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu ratios 

The ratios Cd:Zn and Cd:Cu were calculated
 
in mantle and digestive glands for all the 

specimens at each site (Pereira et al., 2009) and ANOVA was tested to check 

differences between sites, sex, size and season (Table III-V). For mantle, no significant 

differences were found for sampling station, sex or season, although for digestive 

glands both ratios presented significant differences for sampling station (Table III-V). 

For the ratio Cd:Zn the higher value was 0.52 for POR and for the ratio Cd:Cu the 

higher value was 0.31 for BAR. No significant differences were found for sex and 

season. Moreover, ratios and tissues showed no significant differences when size of 

specimens was used as covariate. As observed for metal concentration in both tissues 

(mantle and digestive gland) also the ratios of Cd:Cu and Cd:Zn differ of one and two 

orders of magnitude, respectively. No correlation was observed with body weight and 

ratios with the exception of the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland that presented a positive 

correlation.

III.4.6. Correlations between metals 

In general, the correlations between metals were not significant with the exceptions of 

[Cu] vs [Cd] in digestive gland (p&lt;0.05) and [Cu] vs [Pb] in digestive gland (p&lt;0.001) 

(Figure III.4). Copper was positively correlated (p&lt;0.05) to Cadmium and lead 

(p&lt;0.001). Other authors have also studied these correlations, due to the quimical 

correlation of these metals (Pereira et al., 2009). 

 

Figure III.4 – Correlations between [Cu] vs [Cd] and [Cu] vs [Pb] in the digestive glands of S. 

officinalis from Ria the Aveiro (n=53; p&lt;0.001). 

 

Only lead concentrations were significantly correlated in mantle and digestive gland 

(r=0.333; n=53; p=0.015). 

 

III.4.7. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) 

The multivariate ordination (RDA) of metal concentrations within different sites of Ria 

de Aveiro (Figure III.5) support the results from univariate analyses (ANOVA). 

However, some differences in specific element were found, because RDA considered all 

the elements simultaneously rather than one at the time. The first RDA axis (horizontal 

axis) explains 38.7 % of the total variance of metals between sites, and the second one 

(vertical axis) 27.5 %. Both axes explain 66.2 % of the total variability. The third axis 

explained only 21.1 % of the total variation, and therefore it was not considered. Monte 

Carlo permutation tests on RDA results showed that the first axis is statistically 

significant (p=0.016). Similar results were obtained when all canonical axes were 

considered (p=0.002). Most of the observed variability in metal concentrations in tissues 

of Sepia officinalis was associated with differences between individuals within a site 

(72.2 %) while 20.4 % was associated with differences between sites and 7.4 % was 

explained by covariates (total weight, length, and digestive gland weight). The high

variability between individuals of the same sampling area hampers the establishment of 

patterns. Nevertheless, Laranjo is clearly separated from other sites presenting higher 

values of metal concentrations with the exception of Cd quantities in the digestive 

gland, as mentioned previously. Levels of Pb in mantle are strongly correlated with Pb 

concentrations in digestive gland, suggesting once more the weak affinity of the 

digestive gland to Pb. The opposite occurs with the accumulation of Cd in both tissues, 

where levels of Cd in mantle are much lower than levels of Cd in digestive gland. 

Torreira (TOR) is the site with higher variability, whereas POR is the area with lower 

variability with the exception of few values that presented extremely high values of Cd 

in the digestive gland. Commercial Port (POR) is strongly associated with higher depths 

and saturated oxygen in water. Barra presented a central distribution of metals, 

presenting the lowest values of metals concentrations and the factor that apparently 

influences more is the salinity, showing the highest values of salinity which could be 

explained by the proximity of the sea.

III.4.8. Relevance of metal concentration in cutlefish for human 

consumption  

In the digestive gland all the individuals captured presented quantities of Cd and Pb 

higher than the limit proposed for human consumption, however for Cd the values were 

much higher than the limit proposed, considering the eating habits of the Portuguese 

people, this poses risks to human health (Figure III.6).

III.5. Discussion 

The strong correlation between length and weight is independent of site and season, this 

was also observed by others authors like Pereira (2003); Raimundo et al. (2005); Pereira 

et al. (2009). 

The levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are higher, comparing with 

the values in mantle. The same trend was observed in other studies with different 

cephalopod species (Raimundo et al., 2004; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira, 2003; 

Pereira et al., 2009). This indicates that the accumulation of these elements in S. 

officinalis is preferentially made in the digestive gland, resulting from several

mechanisms as absorption, storage and detoxification of trace elements. Various studies 

confirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods concentrates high levels of Zn and 

Cu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd (Miramand and Guary, 1980; 

Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a; Raimundo et al., 2009). For TOR and GAF, the level 

of Pb was equal in the mantle and digestive gland (i.e. same order of magnitude) this 

may be caused by a higher availability of lead in these sites. This fact could be related 

with the location of both sites in Ria de Aveiro, GAF is situated in the vicinity of a 

deep-sea fishing port and dry-docks and also connected with the main channel coming 

from Aveiro city carrying domestic discharges, and TOR, in an intermediate region of 

the longest channel (S. Jacinto-Ovar channel), containing a higher number of 

recreational boats. However, until such assumptions are confirmed by levels of Pb in the 

water, they remain highly speculative. 

In general, metal concentrations obtained in this study for mantle and digestive gland of 

S. officinalis were higher when compared with values reported for same species and 

other cephalopods of various studies (Table III-VI). Comparisons with specimens from 

different ecosystems must be carefully made, as identical species may exhibit different 

feeding habits, growth rates and habitats, which may interfere with metal accumulation 

(Bustamante et al., 1998b; Raimundo et al., 2004; Pierce et al., 2008). However, the 

values obtained were comparable to previous data obtained along the Portuguese coast 

(Pereira et al., 2009; Seixas et al., 2005; Raimundo et al., 2005, 2008). Indeed, when 

compared with levels of S. officinalis of the same area (Pereira et al., 2009) the values 

obtained are higher or very similar, with the exception of Pb whose value was lower. 

For different geographic regions, the only exception was the slightly lower values of Fe, 

Zn and Cu obtained when compared to specimens captured in Mediterranean Sea and 

English Channel (Miramand and Guary, 1980; Miramand and Bentley, 1992) (Table 

III-VI).  

The most striking aspect was the extremely high value of Cd in mantle of specimens 

captured in Laranjo (LAR) and the relatively low value of this element in digestive 

gland (when compared with values of Cd obtained for POR and TOR in the digestive 

gland). The increase of Cd in mantle, without a corresponding increase in the digestive 

gland, organ where this element is stored (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a; 

Bustamante et al., 2002b; Raimundo et al., 2009) suggests a large transference of Cd 

directly from water. This fact probably indicates an acute exposition and a recent uptake 

from water. 



Chapter III  

| P a g e 116 

For Cd the values obtained in all sites of Ria de Aveiro are higher than the values 

measured in previous studies (see Table III-VI). This pattern of high levels of Cd in 

digestive glands of specimens captured in Ria de Aveiro appears to be a sign of higher 

Cd exposure. In reality, studies of distribution and accumulation of metals in sediments 

of Ria de Aveiro presented high Cd concentrations in the lagoon (Monterroso et al., 

2003a). Due to the species mobility and the different availability of preys along the 

lagoon, metal concentrations in tissues cannot be exclusively viewed as direct reflex of 

environmental conditions. However, there is no doubt that the contamination of Cd in 

Ria de Aveiro is essentially a result of the industrial complex of Estarreja, near the bay 

of Laranjo and the contamination of others locals of the lagoon are made by transport of 

contaminated sediments and water to the lagoon by tidal currents of Ria the Aveiro 

(Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 2003a) and by plankton exportation (Monterroso 

et al., 2003b). Bustamante et al. (2000) suggested that high Cd levels in digestive 

glands of species captured in contaminated areas are related to the surrounding 

environment. Commercial Port presented a really high value of Cd when compared with 

other sites, which could be related with the activities of the Port and also with the fact 

that this area forms a sort of bay which is influenced by tides that lead the contaminants 

into the bay and remain there accumulated. However, it´s also an area of refuge were 

fisheries are not allowed and probably a site where cuttlefish from other sites seek 

refuge. This idea might be supported by the increase number of specimens captured in 

this site in comparison with other sites (Table III-II). 

Metal concentrations increase as the distance from the sea increase. This metal 

distribution pattern in digestive gland appears to reflect the location of anthropogenic 

sources of metals discharged in the northern region of Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso, et al., 

2003a). Laranjo (LAR) and Torreira (TOR) are, probably, the most contaminated areas, 

presenting the highest values of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) 

metals for digestive gland (Figure III.3). The higher values presented in Torreira (TOR) 

suggests that this local suffers the influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second 

most contaminated area after Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a). 

Once more, metal concentrations in cephalopods could also vary according to the 

location where individuals were captured (Bustamante et al., 1998b; Seixas et al., 2005; 

Bustamante et al., 2008; Pierce et al., 2008).  

For metal-metal relationship in digestive gland and mantle, only Pb presented a low 

correlation between the two tissues, this could be related with the fact that food is the 



Chapter III  

| P a g e 117 

main source of metal contamination in cephlopods (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et 

al., 2002b).  

Only the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland presented a positive correlation with wet body 

weight, meaning that Cd was progressively sequestrated in digestive gland with age. 

This pattern was also observed for S. officinalis in Pereira et al. (2009) and for O. 

vulgaris in Raimundo et al. (2005). 

Miramand and Bentley (1992) and Bustamante (1998) showed that due to the 

similarities in chemical behaviour, Cd (non-essential metal), when in high 

concentrations in digestive gland, can compete with Zn and Cu (essential metals) for the 

same ligands, specific metalloproteins presented in digestive gland of cephalopods. For 

this reason it would be expected significant correlations between Cd-Cu and Cd-Zn, like 

in Pereira et al. (2009), however in this study it was only found significant correlations 

(P&lt;0.01) for Cd and Cu in digestive gland. In Aveiro lagoon the specimens captured in 

POR (Commercial Port) presented high levels of Cd and the highest value of ratio 

Cd:Cu in the digestive gland, significantly different (P&lt;0.05) than others (see Table 

III-V). Since essential elements tend to be maintained at a fairly constant concentration 

in tissues, Cd:Cu ratios increase in cephalopods contaminated by Cd (Bustamante et al., 

1998a; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira et al.,2009).  

In Mediterranean countries, the whole body of small cuttlefish is usually consumed. For 

bigger specimens, the digestive gland is often removed, but due to the high levels of Cd 

in the digestive gland, contamination of Cd in the mantle is frequent. This contributes 

significantly to Cd intake, since the mass of digestive gland is approximately 10% of the 

mantle, and the Cd content of other organs is negligible due to their small masses and 

low Cd concentrations (Miramand and Bentley, 1992), one may estimate that 95% of 

total body burden of Cd is stored in the digestive gland. Thus, frequent consumption of 

these small cuttlefish by humans might pose serious health risks.

III.6. Conclusions 

The digestive gland of S. officinalis has an extraordinary capacity to storage elements 

like metals, especially Zn, Cu and Cd. It seems that this organ also has the ability to 

redistribute these elements into the mantle of cuttlefish. For these reasons the digestive 

gland is considered a biomarker of potential contamination by metals in cuttlefish. 

S. officinalis shows a predisposition to accumulate Cd and was considered, like other 

cephalopods, by Bustamante et al. (1998b) as a vector for transfer of Cd to top marine 

predators. Cuttlefishes captured in Ria de Aveiro presented, in digestive gland and in 

some mantles, high levels of Cd, which seems to be a response to Cd contamination in 

marine ecosystems. Results also suggest that there can be higher accumulation of Cd on 

the mantle, rather than on the digestive gland, in environmental ecosystems with high 

levels of Cd. Owing to this contamination level of Cd in organisms near potential 

sources of contamination more studies with high number of individuals should be 

developed to ashore the good quality of the captured cuttlefish. Until now it seems that 

the mechanisms of sequestration and detoxification occurring in the digestive gland are 

effective to ashore the normal development of cuttlefish. 

Due to the local economic importance of S. officinalis for the region of Aveiro, and for 

being a target specie for this type of studies, further studies should be developed in 

strategic sites of the lagoon (Laranjo bay, Largo da Coroa and Commercial Port of 

Aveiro), may be further supplemented by studies of monitoring metal concentrations 

with emphasis on the function of the digestive gland as a storage organ of toxic 

compounds and principal producer of metalloproteins to the sequestration of these 

elements. Beyond that, trace elements are generally considered for their potential 

toxicity in ecotoxicological studies and biomonitoring surveys, and there is an increase 

interest in their use to provide information on life history and trophic ecology of 

cephalopods.

IV. Mercury concentration in mantle and digestive gland of common cuttlefish 

Sepia officinalis in a coastal lagoon with historical point-source discharges 

(Aveiro, Portugal) 

 

IV.1.1. Abstract 

The mercury (Hg) levels were measured in mantle and digestive gland of common 

cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis collected from six sites (Barra (BAR), Torreira (TOR), 

Commercial Port (POR), Gafanha (GAF), Rio Novo do Príncipe (RIO), and Laranjo 

(LAR) in the Ria de Aveiro. The Hg concentrations were higher in Laranjo bay (1.2 and 

2.0 µg g
-1

, in mantle and digestive gland, respectively). In other areas the accumulation 

of Hg is much lower (0.25-0.65 µg g
-1 

in mantle and 0.40-1.20 µg g
-1 

in digestive gland). 

The results suggest that the effect of mercury contamination in cuttlefish is restricted to 

the Laranjo bay. Mercury in mantle and digestive gland were of the same order of 

magnitude, indicating that the digestive gland does not have a specific affinity to store 

this element. The 1.5 µg g
-1 

dry weight EU limit was only exceeded in one cuttlefish 

sample. It may concluded that the cuttlefishes studied do not constitute cause for 

concern in terms of human consumption, and could be safely used for daily intake of 

essential elements.

IV.1.2. Introduction 

Mercury (Hg) is one of the most hazardous contaminants that may be present in aquatic 

environments, widely considered to be among the highest priority environmental 

pollutants in the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and on the 

global scale (Pereira et al., 2009a). Mercury is an element that has both natural and 

anthropogenic sources (OSPAR, 2004). Most of the anthropogenic mercury enters to 

aquatic ecosystems in its inorganic form through diffuse sources or via point discharges 

(Baeyers et al., 2003). It is recognised that anthropogenic sources of mercury are 

responsible for the highest environmental impacts (EPA, 1997), having deleterious 

effects on biota, including both Human health and ecosystem functions (Pereira et al., 

2009a). Mercury is accumulated by many aquatic organisms, transferred and magnified 

along trophic chain (Baeyers et al., 2003), eventually finding its way to economically 

important species and ultimately to humans (Pereira et al, 2006). Although, the existing 

restrictions on the anthropogenic sources of mercury, historically contaminated 

sediments may still constitute a source of mercury to the aquatic environment. In 

general, mercury has a high affinity with suspended particles which contributes to its 

removal from water and to sink in bottom sediments (Lee et al., 1998; Ramalhosa et al., 

2001, Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Thus, sediments may function as reservoir of 

anthropogenic mercury and/or as internal sources when metal is freed to pore-water 

(Arakel, 1995, May et al., 1997, Baeyers et al., 2003). Mercury retained in sediments 

may be released to the water column through physical disturbance as redox potential, 

temperature, oxygen, salinity, becoming available to aquatic organisms (Pereira et al., 

1998a, 1998b; Ramalhosa et al., 2006; Pato et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009a). The 

integration of Hg may vary with different parameters such as biological (growth rate, 

size, sex) ecological (food, habit) and environmental factors (Hg availability, 

methylation rate, primary productivity) (Raimundo et al, 2010). 

As several other cephalopod species, the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis is 

extensively fished and consumed by humans of coastal communities in Portugal, 

considered important target specie in fisheries having a high economic, social and 

cultural value. Therefore, contaminant levels in cephalopods are also of direct concern 

to public health, since they could represent an important vector of contaminant to the 

consumers as shown for Cd (Bustamante et al., 1998a).  

Ria de Aveiro, an estuarine lagoon in the northwest of Portugal, is a biologically 

productive system with a significant role in the life cycle of several organisms being 



Chapter IV  

   Page | 131  

used as nursery for many species, namely cuttlefish. Over five decades, this marine 

system received discharges of anthropogenic mercury from a chlor-alkali plant (Pereira 

et al. 1998a, b; Pato et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009a). It is well known that chlor-alkali 

industries using mercury as a cathode are an important source of this hazardous 

contaminant in aquatic environments (Ramalhosa et al., 2005). Since the influence of 

anthropogenic mercury in the environment persists for a substantial period of time after 

the reduction of emissions (Pereira, 1996), studies on the impact caused by emissions of 

mercury even after the sources have been extinguished are necessary. Mercury’s high 

mobility, persistence in the environment, and lipophilicity, justify the importance of the 

environmental study of mercury, as it is a toxic element to all living organisms 

(Boening, 2000).  

Several studies have been made to track the mercury discharges in the sediments (Lucas 

et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998a; Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Ramalhosa 

et al., 2005; Pastorinho et al., 2012); water (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., 1998b; 

Ramalhosa et al., 2001; Pato et al., 2008); organisms (Lima, 1986; Lucas et al., 1986; 

Abreu et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2006; Guilherme et al., 2008) and 

plants (Coelho et al., 2005; Abreu et al., 2008). In contrast to fish or others organisms, 

information on Hg in cephalopod tissues is scarce (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., 

2005a,b; Bustamante et al., 2006a; Pierce et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2009), which 

contrast once more with the several studies concerning other trace metals in cephalopod 

tissues (e.g. Martin and Flegal, 1975; Smith et al., 1984; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; 

Bustamante et al., 2000, 2002a, b, 2004; Ayas and Ozogul, 2011). Almost all of these 

studies demonstrated the major role of digestive gland in metal metabolism, as this 

organ is deeply involved in assimilation processes, detoxification and storage of both 

essential and non-essential metals. Only two studies analysed the levels of Hg in 

digestive gland of common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (Bustamante et al., 2006a; 

Pereira et al., 2009b). 

Therefore, there is a need to provide more data on Hg concentration in digestive gland 

and edible tissue of cuttlefish to better estimate the intake of human populations feeding 

on this cephalopod. Thus, the present study aims at providing baseline data on total Hg 

concentration in the tissues (digestive gland and mantle) of the cuttlefish S. officinalis 

(L.) from six sites of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, including areas with variable degrees of 

contamination. In addition to examining spatial and seasonal differences, biological data 



Chapter IV

was also collected to present a contemporary picture of the distribution of size, maturity, 

and sex ratio. 

 

IV.2. Materials and methods 

IV.2.1. Study Area 

The Ria de Aveiro (Figure IV.1), situated 

on the northern coast of Portugal and with 

a total area of 83 km
2
 (high tide) and 66 

Km
2
 (low tide) (Dias et al., 2001; 

Abrantes et al., 2006), supports a 

population of 350,000 inhabitants (INE, 

2001). Its principal municipaly (Aveiro 

town) is located 15 km south from the 

industrial complex of Estarreja, that 

includes a chlor-alkali plant that 

discharged mercury from the 1950s until 

the mid 1990s (Pereira et al., 2009a). The 

estimated lagoon tidal prism ranges from 

137 x 10
6
 m

3
 for maximum spring tide 

and 35 x 10
6
 m

3 
for minimum neap tide 

(Dias et al., 2001). The total mean river 

input into the lagoon during tidal cycle is 

smaller (about 1.8 x 10
6
 m

3
) when 

compared with the tidal prism (Lopes and 

Dias, 2007). Consequently semidiurnal tides 

are the major factor influencing the 

hydrodynamics of the lagoon (Dias et al., 

2000). Laranjo bay is an internal source of Hg by the sediments that have been highly 

contaminated with Hg (Pereira et al., 2009a). Dias (2001) and Lopes et al. (2006) 

characterized the first half of the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon as ebb 

dominated and the second half as flood dominated. As the lower lagoon is ebb 

dominated there is a trend to export sediments to the ocean (Picado et al., 2010). Taking 

this in consideration and the several sources of pollution of the lagoon, the following 

Figure IV.1- Sampling sites of S. 

officinalis: Ria de Aveiro (Adapted from 

Valentim et al., 2013). 

 



Chapter IV  

   Page | 133  

sites were selected: Barra (BAR), near the entrance of the lagoon in the initial part of 

the Mira channel and subject to considerable vessel traffic; Commercial Port (POR), 

within the harbour and so with the influence of all the activities developed in the 

harbour; Gafanha (GAF) situated in the vicinity of a deep-sea fishing port and dry-

docks, also connected with the main channel coming from Aveiro city carrying 

domestic discharges; Torreira (TOR), an intermediate region of the longest channel (S. 

Jacinto-Ovar channel) with influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second most 

contaminated area after Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro; Rio Novo do Principe (RIO) 

located in the terminal area of the main freshwater course, the Vouga river, 6.5 km 

distant from a paper mill effluent outlet; Laranjo (LAR), in the proximity of the chlor-

alkali plant (6 km), the principal source of metal contamination (mainly mercury). 

 

IV.2.2. Sampling and biological data collection 

Fifty three common cuttlefish, S. officinalis (Table IV-I), were caught from March to 

December 2003, with a fishing net, a network trammel, in five sites of Ria de Aveiro 

(Figure IV.1). The abiotic parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, 

salinity, turbidity and depth were registered on each capture. Temperature (± 0.1 ºC) 

and dissolved oxygen (± 0.01 mg.l
-1

) were recorded with an oxygen meter (Consort 

Z621), the pH (± 0.01) with pH meter (WTW 330/set – 2), the salinity (± 0.1) with a 

refractometer (Atago), the turbidity (± 0.1 m) was recorded with a Secchi disc and the 

depth (± 0.1m) with a handmade probe. Total body weight, dorsal mantle length (DML, 

size), total length (TL), sex and maturity stage were determined in each individual. All 

individuals were included in an allometric relationship between fresh weight (g) and 

mantle length (mm) (Figure IV.2). A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. 

officinalis was used (adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984) (Table A. 1 - 

Appendix), in which stage I is “immature”, stages II-III are “maturing”, and stages IV-V 

are “mature”. Specimens with no visible gonad development were classified as 

“Juveniles” (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated in maturity stage 1. The origin, number 

of individuals and body weight of each specimen are given in Table IV-I. Specimens 

were stored in individual plastic bags and frozen (-80 ºC) in order to minimize 

mobilization of metals between organs (Martin and Flegal, 1975). In the laboratory, 

digestive gland and mantle (without skin) were totally removed under partially defrost 

conditions without rupture of the tissues. Weight of digestive gland was expressed as 



Chapter IV

percentages of total body weight, e.g., digestive gland index (DGI, see Jorge and Sobral, 

2004). After separation, individual tissue samples were freeze-dried, ground and 

homogenised for the analysis of total mercury.

IV.2.3. Analytical procedures 

Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, using a silicon UV diode 

detector Leco AMA-254, after pyrolysis of each sample in a combustion tube at 750 ºC, 

under an oxygen atmosphere and collection on a gold amalgamator (Costley et al., 

2000). Mercury analysis were ran with respect to a methodical quality control including 

analysis of international certificate standards dogfish muscle DORM-1, DORM-2; 

lobster hepatopancreas TORT-1, TORT-2 and fish liver DOLT-3 purchased to the 

National Research Council, Canada. These certified materials were treated and analysed 

under the same conditions as the samples. The results were in good agreement with the 

standards values, not differing significantly at 95 % confidence level (Table IV-II). 

Blanks were also run together with samples. Concentration of metal was expressed in 

dry weight (µg g
-1

 DWT). Detection limit for Hg was 0.041 µg g
-1

. 

Table IV-II – Concentration of Hg in standard materials used to accuracy analytical quality 

control (mean±SD; µg g-

 dry weight) 

 

 

IV.2.4. Data analysis 

Specific weights of metal concentrations were calculated as a function of dry weight. 

Prior to statistical analysis, Hg concentrations and biological data were tested for 

normality and equality of variance using the Anderson-Darling test and Levene´s test, 

respectively. Whenever significant deviations from normality and homoscedasticity 

were found, data was log-transformed prior to further statistical analysis to correct for 

these deviations. For Hg, statistical comparisons between sites, sex and tissues were 

performed using a two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey comparisons

whenever significant differences were found. Pairing site and season was also used to 

assess seasonality effects using a two way ANOVA. For relations between other 

parameters such as mantle length, total weight, DGI, and concentration of Hg, was used 

Pearson coefficient of correlation. Statistical testing was carried out with MINITAB® 

Release 14.20. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. Redundancy Analysis 

(RDA), a technique that falls between multiple regression and canonical correlation 

analysis (Sparks et al. 1999), was performed using the CANOCO software package for 

windows, version 4.5 to assess effects of environmental conditions on metal content. 

The significance of RDA was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test using 

routines built into the software package. A detailed description of the method is 

provided in Van den Brink et al. (2003). 

 

IV.3. Results 

IV.3.1. Metal in mantle and digestive gland 

The differences in Hg concentrations tended to be slightly higher in the digestive gland 

than in mantle (Table IV-III). Despite the small difference between Hg levels in both 

tissues (values of the same order of magnitude), the between-tissues difference in 

concentration was significant for all areas of sampling (F1, 99=63.59, p&lt;0.001).

Two-way ANOVA was used to show significant differences in metal concentration 

between site, sex and season for mantle and digestive gland (Table IV-IV). Highly 

significant (p&lt;0.001) site-specific differences were detected in both tissues. The lagoon 

can be divided in two different areas in terms of Hg concentrations: a larger group 

without differences which includes the sites of BAR, POR, TOR, RIO and GAF, that 

can be considered as the area with lower Hg concentrations and a contaminated area, 

LAR. For sex only mantle presented significant differences (p&lt;0.001), in this case 

females presented higher values of Hg accumulated. In the seasonal analysis, only the 

digestive gland presented significant differences of Hg concentrations (Table IV-IV). In 

this tissue, all the sampling sites presented higher levels in summer than in spring.

The effect of body size (DML) which ranged for 91-208 mm was also evaluated, 

however the result was non-significant for both tissues analysed (p&lt;0.05).

Correlations of Hg in tissues  

The Hg concentrations in mantle and digestive gland presented a positive linear 

correlation (Pearson correlation of 0.69 with a p&lt;0.001), so higher values of Hg in 

digestive gland corresponded to higher values of Hg in mantle (Figure IV.3). The 

positive correlation between Hg levels in mantle and digestive gland is independent of 

the sampling site (Figure IV.4). Taking into account the low number of specimens 

analysed, the regression between Hg concentrations in the two tissues is strongly 

significant. When cuttlefish is subjected to lower concentrations of Hg the partition of 

this element to the mantle and digestive gland is almost the same. However, when the 

levels of Hg increase, the importance of the digestive gland in the storage of several 

metals seems to become effective (Miramand and Guary, 1980; Finger and Smith, 1987; 

Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2002a, b, 2004) (Figure IV.4).

IV.3.2. Implications for public health 

According to COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Nº 629/2008 of 2 July 2008, the 

limit established for the Hg content in the mantle of cephalopods is 0.5 µg g
-1

 (fresh 

weight) of Hg. Moreover, Portugal has also signed the OSPAR convention, in which it 

was established that the maximum level of mercury in animals for human consumption 

is 0.3 µg g
-1

 wet weight (i.e., 1.5 µg g
-1

 dry weight) (Seixas et al., 2005b).  

Considering average of Hg levels in mantle of cuttlefish, the values are significantly 

lower than the EU limit (1.5 µg g
-1

 DWt) (Figure IV.5). Taking into account all the 

results obtained it was found that only one individual from Laranjo presented a value 

higher (1.6 µg g
-1

 DWt) than the limit recommended for human consumption (Figure 

IV.5).

recommended limit for human consumption, from different sampling areas. 

Considering the body size of the analysed specimens the ingestion of the digestive gland 

is not suppose to occur, for this reason the values obtained for these tissue weren’t 

compared with the EU limit for human consumption.  

 

IV.3.3. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) 

RDA analysis showed that most of the variance is associated with the first axis (97.4%), 

and the remaining part is explained by the second axis (2.6%). Monte Carlo permutation 

tests followed the RDA and showed significance for the first axis (p=0.006), thus, 

differences found in the first axis are significant (Figure IV.6). The significance test of 

all canonical axes was also statistically significant (p=0.006).  

The results of multivariate analysis are comparable to the univariate one (ANOVA), 

however, the results of the multivariate analysis show more details in individual levels 

of Hg in tissues. The RDA focus on the absolute differences in ‘species’ abundances 

(here Hg levels) between the ‘samples’ (here sites). By the analysis of the RDA triplot 

is easily understood that LAR presents the higher values of Hg concentrations and the 

rest of the lagoon lower values of Hg concentrations. In terms of environmental 

parameters the factor that most interfere with the Hg concentration is the temperature. It 

seems that temperature makes the distinction between LAR and the rest of the lagoon. 

Temperature is strongly correlated with the first axis (Figure IV.6).

IV.4. Discussion 

Univariate and multivariate methods used in this work are concordant in terms of Hg 

distribution in Ria de Aveiro, and levels of Hg are low with the exception of Laranjo 

bay that presented higher values. This fact eliminates a regional distribution of Hg in 

Ria de Aveiro, the higher levels of Hg are certainly related with the historical discharges 

of effluents from the chlor-alkali industry of the industrial complex of Estarreja into 

Laranjo bay (Lucas et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998a; Reis et al., 2009; 

Monterroso et al., 2003; Pereira et al., 2009a). Today Laranjo bay is a non-significant 

active source of Hg since the discharges stopped in 1985, however, it is still an internal 

source of Hg by the sediments that have been highly contaminated with Hg (Hall et al., 

1985). The Hg contained in the sediments may became available to biota (Coelho et al., 

2007), eventually from food chain by the benthic organisms (Bryan and Langston, 

1992; Lee et al., 1998; Warren et al. 1998), or be remobilized when sediments are 

dredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., 1998). The RDA analysis clearly

separates Laranjo area from the rest of the lagoon, and temperature is the factor that 

most influences this distribution (Figure IV.6). Laranjo presented higher values of 

temperature than other sites, which probably influenced the Hg concentrations, since 

high temperature favors a high methylation rate (Bustamante et al., 2006a), which could 

lead to a higher uptake of mercury by aquatic organisms. Other authors also referred 

that environmental condition, such as levels in water, exposure period, and temperature 

may influence the metal accumulation in cephalopods (Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2000).  

The cuttlefish Sepia officinalis feeds on a large variety of living prey, including small 

molluscs, crabs, shrimps, other cuttlefish, and juvenile demersal fishes. Schuhmacher et 

al. (1994) concluded that the groups that accumulated more Hg are crustaceans and 

fishes, that are preferential preys of Cuttlefishes (Pinczon du Sel et al., 2000) Taking 

into account the cephalopods capacity to bioaccumulation (Bustamante et al. 1998b, 

2000, 2006a) and that cephalopods have economic importance for humans, the analyse 

of Hg levels in Ria de Aveiro is relevant. The levels of mercury in this study were in 

general below the acceptable limit for human consumption, only one value of Laranjo 

bay was higher than the limit (see Figure IV.5). Levels of Hg obtained in this study 

show that this specie does not constitute a cause of concern in terms of human 

consumption. However, due to the low number of individuals captured in Laranjo bay 

and the constant concern with human health, further studies in this area are needed for a 

better evaluation of the problem. 

Mercury is considered to be one of the most problematic metals in marine ecosystems 

due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs (EPA, 2001). 

Various studies reported Hg concentrations in different tissues (Alcobia, 1995; Buzina 

et al., 1989; Stoeppler et al., 1979; Rossi et al., 1993; Seixas et al., 2005a; Raimundo et 

al., 2004, 2010; Bustamante et al., 2008). Table IV-V compares Hg concentrations in 

mantle and digestive gland of cuttlefish with other cephalopods species. The values 

obtained revealed two distinct areas in Ria de Aveiro, the Laranjo bay (polluted area) 

with high concentration of Hg, and the rest of the lagoon as a whole, presenting low 

concentration of Hg. Considering the specie S. officinalis, and comparing only the 

polluted areas, the value presented for Laranjo bay is higher than the value of Kastela 

bay (polluted). When analysing the unpolluted areas of Ria de Aveiro the value obtained 

is higher than those presented on the referred studies. (Table IV-V) Mercury 

concentrations in the lagoon are greatly influenced by the historical discharges of 

mercury from industrial activities into Laranjo Bay (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., 



Chapter IV  

   Page | 143  

2009), leading to Hg concentrations higher than other ecosystems also polluted like 

Kastela Bay in Adriatic that is known for obtaining discharges of Hg from mine 

exploitation of the region (Faganeli et al., 2003).  

Considering different species, Hg concentrations in this work were always higher with 

the exception of the species (Eledone cirrhosa and Octopus vulgaris) captured in 

Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea and specific areas in Portuguese Coast (Cascais and 

Olhão). Higher Hg concentrations in Mediterranean organisms are typically explained 

by high temperature and the absence of solar radiation in the deep environment that 

favours a high methylation rate (Bustamante et al., 2006a). Moreover, natural sources of 

Hg in the Mediterranean Sea may contribute to Hg enrichment through the benthic food 

webs, as it constitutes the richest natural reserve of this element (Bacci, 1989 in 

Bustamente et al., 2006a). Geological characteristic such as sulphide deposits of the 

Iberian Pyrite Belt (Leistel et al., 1998) affect the Hg concentrations of the Gulf of 

Cadiz (Cossa et al., 2001). Taking into account the mainstream of the Mediterranean 

Sea and as a result of cyclonic currents in the eastern shelf of the South coast of 

Portugal the availability of Hg to local food web can be increased (Garcia-Lafuente and 

Ruizet, 2006; Relvas et al., 2007). The octopus is a top predator (Mangold, 1983) and 

this could justify the higher concentrations of mercury. These facts could explain the 

higher values obtained for Eledone Cirrhosa and Octopus vulgaris when compared with 

cuttlefish of the northwestern coast of Portugal. Like other metals, Hg concentrations in 

cephalopod may vary with biological factors such as age (size), sex and maturity stage 

(Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Ayas and 

Ozogul, 2011). It is generally admitted that Hg concentrations in cephalopod tissues are 

positively correlated with size (Monteiro et al., 1992; Rossi et al., 1993; Storelli and 

Marcotrigiano, 1999 in Bustamante et al., 2006a), however due to restrict range of size 

of captured individuals this couldn’t be verified. It would be extremely interest to invest 

more studies in Ria de Aveiro that includes a higher range of sizes, in order to verify 

this effect of bioaccumulation along life cycle of cuttlefish.

digestive gland of cephalopods from the literature. 

 

 

The distribution of Hg was considered between two separated tissues, mantle (muscle) 

and digestive gland of S. officinalis. Mantle muscle was first selected taking into 

account that it is referred by several authors (e.g. Renzoni et al., 1973; Monteiro et al., 

1992; Seixas et al., 2005a) as a body compartment that could store Hg in significant 

amounts and also for human health purpose. The second organ, digestive gland, plays a 

major role in storage and detoxification of several metals. In contrast to what was 

observed for other trace metals, like Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd in previous studies (e.g. 

Miramand and Guary, 1980; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; 

Bustamante et al., 2002a, b, 2004) where concentrations in digestive gland were one or 

more orders of magnitude higher than in other tissues, for Hg the concentrations 

recorded for digestive gland were in the same order of magnitude compared to the 

mantle. Such different patterns of accumulation between trace metals and Hg suggest 

that cephalopods have different mechanisms/rates of uptake and/or sequestration of

these metals (Pierce et al., 2008). This contrast between trace metals and Hg 

partitioning was also observed in other cephalopods (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et 

al., 2005a; Bustamante et al., 2006a).  

Sources of metal contamination in cephalopods are seawater, as it passes through the 

skin and through the gills; and diet, which probably represents the main pathway for 

many elements, as previously shown for Cd and Zn (Bustamante et al., 2002b, 2004, 

2006b; Miramand et al., 2006). Despite the comparable concentration of Hg, the 

digestive gland presented in all sites a higher value than mantle (see Table IV-III), 

which strongly suggests that food is a major source for mercury accumulation in 

cuttlefish. Due to the positive correlation between Hg concentrations in mantle and 

digestive gland (Figure IV.3), and the fact that muscular tissues contained most of the 

body’s burden of mercury, which suggests a translocation of Hg from digestive gland 

(Seixas et al., 2005a; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). The small difference between 

levels of Hg in mantle and digestive gland could be explained by the affinity of mantle 

to storage MeHg, that is the predominant form of Hg stored in muscle tissue (Harris et 

al., 2003; Amlund et al., 2007). However, compared to other metals like Cd, the role of 

digestive gland in storage of Hg appears to be relatively limited. This may be due to an 

excretion function of Hg by the digestive gland (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009), and a 

preferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues where it bound to the sulfhydryl 

groups of proteins (Bustamante et al., 2006a). 

 

IV.5. Conclusions 

The study provided new data on one of the most problematic contaminant in marine 

ecosystems, mercury, in edible tissue and digestive gland of the commonly eaten S. 

officinalis from Portugal, and clearly demonstrated that levels of mercury in Ria de 

Aveiro lagoon do not constitute a risk to human health. Actually the increment of 

temperature concentrated the contaminants in the aquatic environment and the known 

presence of historical anthropogenic discharges of mercury from a chlor-alkali plant 

near this site lead to a higher accumulation of Hg in S. officinalis specie in Laranjo bay. 

However, further and wider scale study would be valuable, especially in a restricted 

polluted area, Laranjo. Taking into account that organic form of Hg is the most toxic, it 

would be interesting in future studies to measure MeHg, when aiming to evaluate the 

risk for human consumption. In the same way, supplementary analysis concerning Hg

levels are needed to really understand the apparent limited role of digestive gland in 

storage and detoxification of this element when compared with others trace elements 

like Cd and Zn. Observed seasonal and spatial variations indicate that cuttlefish can be 

used to monitor the Hg levels in the environment.

V. Metals accumulation (Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg) during the life cycle of 

common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis 

 

V.1. Abstract 

The developmental changes in the concentration of 6 (essential and non-essential) 

metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Hg) in two tissues (digestive gland and mantle) of the 

common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis caught in Ria de Aveiro were analysed from the 

stage I to Stage IV of maturation. No differences between sexes were identified in the 

four stages of maturity. After the immature individuals start to feed, the digestive gland 

appears to play a major role in the storage of all metals with the exception of Hg. Metal 

concentration of Zn and Cd in digestive gland increases with age during the life cycle of 

cuttlefish, Pb decreases from the stage I of maturity to the rest of the stages. Hg 

presented a positive correlation with age, however, unlike other metals, this correlation 

was observed in the mantle and not in the digestive gland, which suggests that the 

capacity of digestive gland to storage this metal is limited. However, digestive gland has 

a major role in Hg detoxification and depuration. The essential metals Fe and Cu 

displayed a homogeneous concentration of metal during growth of cuttlefish which 

revealed the regular balance of these metals. For the entire life cycle of cuttlefish the 

concentrations of essential metals were always higher than concentrations of non-

essential metals. The results highlighted the strong capacity of cuttlefish to storage in its 

tissues essential and non-essential metals in different stages of its life cycle, suggesting 

that Sepia officinalis could be considered good specie for toxicological studies.

V.2. Introduction 

The cuttlefish Sepia officinalis has a very short life cycle, during which migrations 

related to growth and reproduction take place (Miramand et al., 2006). In Ria de Aveiro 

as in the English Channel and in other Atlantic inshore areas, the reproductive season, 

after which these organisms die, occurs between April and September of their second 

year of life, when they are aged between 14 and 18 months (Boyle, 1990; Boucaud-

Carnou et al., 1991; Legoff and Daguzan, 1991; Dias et al., in press). Consequently, the 

life of cuttlefish never exceeds 2 years in these areas (Richard, 1971; Boletzky, 1983). 

This extremely high growth rate of the cuttlefish is due to their high feeding rates, 

characteristic of cephalopods, moreover food has often been cited as the main uptake 

pathway of metal contamination in cephalopods (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Bustamante 

et al., 1998b; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). 

Cuttlefish is initially benthopelagic but subsequently is mostly benthic, however this 

specie spend long periods buried into sediment (Nixon and Mangold, 1998). Sediment 

represents the main sink for pollutants in coastal ecosystems that are impacted by 

anthropogenic activities (Fichet et al., 1999). Potentially toxic compounds, especially 

metals, are adsorbed on the mineral or organic particles, either in their organic or 

inorganic forms (Robbe, 1984 in Fichet et al., 1999). Taking this into account, the 

contamination via sediment must be considered for the early stages of the cuttlefish life 

cycle, and the contamination via water in the embryogenic stage, since this stage occurs 

in direct contact with water and the animal only feeds from the reserves of the egg. As 

the principal via of contamination changes along the cuttlefish life cycle, it is expected 

that the patterns of metal accumulation also change during the growth and development 

of juveniles into adult cuttlefishes. In general, after the hatching, accumulation of toxic 

elements shows two patterns: metals such as Ag, which is accumulated immediately 

since juveniles, are in direct contact with seawater, and metals as Cd and Pb which are 

significantly incorporate only once the cephalopods start to feed (Miramand et al., 

2006).  

Despite the short life cycle of S. officinalis, several studies have demonstrated the 

efficiency of cuttlefish as accumulators of various trace metals in their tissues, and also 

that the digestive gland acts as the principal organ in the bioaccumulation processes 

(Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 1998a; Bustamante et al., 2002a,b), 

with the exception of Hg where the digestive gland has a major role in Hg detoxification 



Chapter V 

   Page | 161  

 

and depuration, being limited it’s capacity for storage this element (Lacoue-Labarthe et 

al., 2009). Other authors studied the accumulation of metals in the early stages and 

during the growth of cuttlefish (Bustamante et al., 2002b; Bustamante et al., 2004; 

Bustamante et al., 2006b; Miramand et al., 2006; Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009), 

however only one of these studies is from organisms captured in is natural environment 

(Miramand et al., 2006). Overall, there is a lack of published data concerning the 

accumulation of essential and non-essential metals in juvenile cuttlefish captured in the 

wild and subject to the natural conditions of the environment. Such baseline information 

is needed to better understand the necessities and the processes of accumulation of trace 

metals along the cuttlefish life cycle. The main aim of this study is to understand the 

seasonal and spatial changes in metal concentrations during the growth, life cycle of S. 

officinalis, for those 6 metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg) investigated from immature 

to adult cuttlefish, in Ria de Aveiro. This 

investigation focused on S. officinalis, due to its 

wide distribution in coastal waters and high 

commercial importance in Portugal. 

 

V.3. Materials and methods 

V.3.1. Study Area 

Ria the Aveiro ia a shallow well-mixed (marine 

and freshwater) coastal lagoon on the northwester 

coast of Portugal (40°38´N, 8°44´W) connected to 

the sea by a single channel (1.3 Km long, 350 m 

wide and 20 m deep). (Dias and Fernandes, 2006; 

Abrantes et al., 2006). The system can be 

subdivided into channels that, due to specific 

characteristics, can be regarded as independent 

estuaries connected to a common outlet. In 

general, the most common typology is one of 

extensive intertidal zones, namely mud flats and 

salt marshes, with the exception of the central part 

of the lagoon (Picado et al., 2010; Pastorinho et 

Figure V.1 - Sampling station of S. 

officinalis in Ria de Aveiro (Adapted 

from Valentim et al., 2013) 



Chapter V  

| P a g e 162 

al., 2012). The hydrodynamic pattern of the lagoon is imposed by tide, each channel 

possesses its own hydrodymanics influence by the respective tidal prism, amount of 

freshwater input and wind force. Strongest currents are observed at the inlet channel, 

reaching values higher than 2 m/s (Vaz et al., 2009). The bathymetry shows that Ria de 

Aveiro is a very shallow lagoon (average depth of 3 m). The deepest areas of the lagoon 

are confined to the inlet channel and to small areas close to the lagoon mouth, at its 

western boundary, where the depths may reach values of 20 m. In the navigation 

channels, that are frequently dredged, the depths are about 7 m (Lopes and Dias, 2007).  

 

V.3.2. Sampling and biological data collection 

A total of 68 cuttlefishes were analysed, and the concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), 

cooper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) were determined. Cuttlefish, 

Sepia officinalis, was caught monthly during March 2003 to December 2003 with a 

network trammel and in two periods corresponding to spring and summer with a 

traditional beach-seine named “chincha”. The use of two types of gears was to ashore 

the capture of individuals of a wide range of sizes and consequently, individuals from 

immature stage (“chincha”) to adult stage (network trammel). Sampling was conducted 

in a single site of the Ria de Aveiro, Barra (BAR), corresponding to the initial part of 

the Mira channel, close to the entrance of the lagoon and subject to considerable vessel 

traffic (Figure V.1). The choice of the sampling site took into account several factors: 

site of easy and safe access for sampling; area subjected to regular dredging, which 

leads to large variations in the concentration of suspended sediments and consequently, 

increasing the availability of contaminants resuspended in water column; and also an 

area used by local fisherman to capture cuttlefish. Abiotic parameters (water 

temperature (ºC); dissolved oxygen (mg/L); turbidity (m); pH; salinity) were assessed 

according APHA (1998) guidelines (Table V-I). For all the cuttlefishes, dorsal mantle 

length (DML) (mm), wet weight (WWt) (g), sex, and maturity stage were recorded 

(Table V-II). A standard 5-point scale of sexual maturity for S. officinalis was used 

(adapted from Alonso-Allende and Guerra, 1984), in which stage I is “immature”, 

stages II-III are ”maturing”, and stages IV-V are “mature”. Specimens with no visible 

gonad development were classified as “juveniles” (Challier et al., 2002) and allocated to 

maturity stage I (Table V-II).Specimens were stored in individual plastic bags and 

immediately frozen, in order to minimize mobilization of metals between organs

(Martin and Flegal, 1975). In the laboratory, the digestive gland of each specimens was 

totally removed under defrost conditions without rupture of outer membrane. Mantle 

free from skin and inner membrane was also sampled. Tissues samples were weighted, 

frozen at – 80 °C and homogenized.

For dorsal mantle length (DML), the table shows the average±standard deviation. For 

maturity, the range and median values for the maturity stage index are presented. The 

proportion of mature cuttlefishes refers to stage IV-V. 

 

V.3.3. Analysis of metals 

Tissue samples were lyophilised and homogenised. Approximately 200 mg of the dry 

tissue was digested with a mixture of HNO3 (sp, 65% v/v) and H2O2 (sp, 30% v/v) at 

different temperatures according to the method described in Ferreira et al. (1990). All 

laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (20%) for 2 days and rinsed with Milli-Q water 

to avoid contamination. The selection of the analytical methodology and apparatus to 

use in metal quantification was determined by metal concentration present in the tissues. 

Quantification of Fe, Zn and Cu in mantle and digestive gland and Cd in digestive gland 

was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Analyst 100) 

while quantification of Cd in mantle and Pb in the mantle and digestive gland were 

analysed with ICP-MS. Total Hg was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry,

using a silicon UV diode detector Leco AMA-254 after pyrolysis of each sample in a 

combustion tube at 750 ºC, under an oxygen atmosphere, and collection on a gold 

amalgamator (Costley et al., 2000). The accuracy of the analytical methods was 

assessed by the analysis of international certificate standards: DORM-1, DORM-2 

(dogfish muscle); TORT-1, TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas) and DOLT-3 (fish liver) 

(National Research Council of Canada). The obtained values and certificated values do 

not differ significantly at 95% confidence level (Table V-III). Blanks and standard 

references materials were run together with samples. All the results are given in 

micrograms per gram of dry weight tissue (µg g

 DWT). Under our analysis conditions, 

the detection limits (µg g

) were: 4.2 (Fe); 0.50 (Zn), 1.2 (Cu), 0.0055 (Cd), 0.0040 

(Pb) and 0.041 (Hg). Precision errors varied from 1 to 8%.

V.3.4. Statistical analysis 

Specific weight metal concentrations were calculated as a function of the dry weight. 

Normality of data and homogeneity of variance were tested using the Anderson-Darling 

test and Levene´s test, respectively. Whenever significant deviations from normality and 

homoscedasticity were found data was log-transformed prior to further statistical 

analysis to correct for these deviations and normalize the data. Whenever significant 

differences were found, between sex and maturity stage, a two-way ANOVA followed 

by post hoc Tukey comparisons were performed for each metal. Pairing season was also 

used to assess seasonality effects using a two way ANOVA. Statistical testing was

V.4. Results 

V.4.1. Relationship between mantle length (DML) and wet weight (WWt) 

Through the use of two fishing arts for the capture of cuttlefish it was possible to obtain 

the various stages of maturation (I-IV) of the life cycle of S. officinalis. The analysed 

data included specimens from different sizes and weights over wide ranges, and also 

included individuals of both sex (M (?) and F (?)) (Table V-II). The relationships 

between size and weight of all analysed cuttlefishes presented a typically allometric 

curve (Figure V.2).

Weight and length present a strong correlation, with proportional increase over growth. 

The correlation was very significant (p&lt;0.001) and Pearson correlation of 0.995. There 

is not a clear cut-off point marking the transition between maturity stages (Figure V.2), 

instead some overlap exists in particular between the maturing and mature stages.

Metal concentrations in mantle of S. officinalis belonging to different stages of maturity 

(stages I, II, II and IV) from Barra in Ria de Aveiro are given in Table V-IV. The

65=2.22) associated with sex, thus for the rest of the analysis the individuals were 

considered all together. Highly significant (p&lt;0.001) differences between seasons 

(spring and summer) were detected for Zn and Hg concentrations. Levels of Zn and Hg 

were higher in animals captured during the spring season (Table V-V).

The tissue type (mantle and digestive gland) had a highly significant (p&lt;0.001) 

influence on the accumulation of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb being one or two orders of 

magnitude higher than in mantle (Table V-IV). Like for mantle, in digestive gland there 

was no significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between metal accumulation with sex. Only Zn 

and Cd concentrations presented significant differences (p&lt;0.001) between seasons 

(spring and summer). For both metals the accumulation was higher in spring than in 

summer (Table V-V).  

 

V.4.3. Variation of metal concentrations along life cycle of S. officinalis 

Metal concentrations in digestive gland, principal organ of storage, showed significant 

variations throughout the life cycle of cuttlefish (Table V-V). As expected the 

concentrations of the essential metals (Fe, Zn, and Cu) were much higher than the non-

essential metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) and the mean values of metals analysed, for digestive 

gland, were in the following order: Zn&gt;Fe&gt;Cu&gt;&gt;Cd&gt;Pb&gt;Hg (Table V-IV and Table 

V-V). This order is always verified in all maturity stages with the exception of stage I 

(immature specimens) were the mean values of Fe and Cu concentrations were higher 

than mean value of Zn concentration (Table V-IV).

Metal concentrations of Fe and Cu did not differ throughout the different stages of the 

life cycle of the cuttlefish, for both analysed tissues (Table V-V). Zinc (Zn) presented 

the highest concentrations of both tissues and increased notably from stage I to other 

stages II, III and IV, this increment was significant (p&lt;0.001), (Table V-V and Figure 

V.3).

digestive gland of Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg among life cycle of S. officinalis. Bars with the same letters 

were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) and bars with no letter were not conclusive. 

This metal showed a positive correlation with mantle length (age) (p&lt;0.001, 

F1,66=14.19), so Zn increased significantly in a allometric way (Figure V.4). For 

cadmium was observed a substantial increase when comparing the immature individuals 

with the mature individuals, in the digestive gland. The accumulation was similar in the 

two first stages (stages I and II) of maturity but different in later stages (stages III and 

IV) (Table V-V). For Pb, in terms of tissue type (mantle and digestive gland) a very 

high value (three orders of magnitude higher than in mantle) was obtained  in the stage I 

for digestive gland, while for mantle the higher value belongs to stage IV (two orders of 

magnitude higher than other stages in mantle). Pb tended to decrease significantly from

(p&lt;0.001, F1,66=41.24; p&lt;0.001, F1,66=21.62, respectively). Hg showed the same 

increase pattern between the stages of maturity in both tissues, however only for mantle 

this differences were significant (p&lt;0.001, F3, 64=24.10). (Table V-V). Among toxic 

metals, Hg was the only metal showing a linear significant increase with age (F1,

Table V-V - Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing statistical comparisons between 

seasons and maturity stage for mantle and digestive gland of S. officinalis on the concentration of 

essential metals (Fe, Zn and Cu) and non-essential metals (Cd, Pb and Hg). 

 

 

V.5. Discussion 

The strong correlation between length and weight is principally due to environment. 

Cuttlefishes in the different stages of their life cycle are subjected to different conditions 

in the environment, since they are migratory species, and as we known changes in the 

abiotic parameters can interfere with the process of maturation of the individual. 

Most of the studies that focus on the metal bioaccumulation in cephalopods are related 

to a single organ, mainly the digestive gland known to play a major role in the energetic 

metabolism of cephalopods. These works although limited to a restrict number of 

cephalopod species have highlighted that this organ is deeply involved in the 

metabolism of Zn, Cu and Cd (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Smith et al., 1984; Finger and 

Smith, 1987; Miramand and Guary, 1980; Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a). Metal 

concentrations in mantle and digestive gland of S. officinalis along several maturity 

stages (Stage I, II, III and IV) analysed showed distinct levels of bioaccumulation for 

both tissues. 

Indeed, the mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are 

much higher than the mean concentrations of those metals in mantle. In contrast, for Hg 

the concentrations obtained for the digestive gland were higher than in mantle but of the

same order of magnitude. Consequently, and in accordance to Miramand et al., 2006, 

the digestive gland generally contained a great proportion of the whole-body burden of 

the metals with the exception of Hg (Bustamante et al., 2006a). 

Several authors refer that mantle is a tissue with strong capacity for storage large 

amounts of Hg (Renzoni et al., 1973; Monteiro et al., 1992; Seixas et al., 2005). Such a 

different pattern of accumulation between Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb analysed and Hg 

suggest that cuttlefish has different mechanisms of uptake or sequestration of these 

metals (Pierce et al., 2008). This difference was also observed for other authors like: 

Raimundo et al. (2004); Seixas et al. (2005); Bustamante et al. (2006a). This may be 

due to an excretion function of Hg associated with the digestive gland (Lacoue-Labarthe 

et al., 2009), and a preferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues as 

methylmercury (MeHg) (Bustamante et al., 2006a). 

The embryonic development of nautiluses, cuttlefishes, squids and cirrate octopods 

occur in an eggs protected by a capsule whose thickness varies according to the species 

(Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). Inside the egg of cuttlefish, concentrations of non-

essential elements, as Ag, Cd and Pb, remains very low, which suggest a restrict transfer 

of these metals through the eggshell during the embryonic development (Miramand and 

Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2002b, 2004; Miramand et al., 2006). Moreover, eggs 

of cirrate octopods (en ex., O. vulgaris) lacks eggshell and the chorion is in direct 

contact with seawater. Taking this into account O. vulgaris eggs have higher 

concentrations for most of the essential elements and also for some of the non-essentials 

(i.e., Ag and Pb). This difference with encased eggs could be due to the absorption of 

these elements from the seawater during the embryonic development in O. vulgaris 

(Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). Collected data are in agreement with these facts, 

indeed, Zn, Cd and Hg presented higher concentrations in mature stages than in 

immature stages. However, the most striking result was the extremely high value of Pb 

in the digestive gland of immature specimens. This aspect can be related with the source 

of intake of this metal. To the best of our knowledge, no data on the respective 

proportions of elements incorporated from food and seawater has been published for 

cephalopods. So, two possibilities were considered for this value, the food ingested by 

immature specimens was probably highly contaminated by Pb or the specimens were 

subjected to an acute exposition and recent uptake of Pb by seawater. On these 

immature specimens, being on an early stage of maturation, the digestive gland may not 

be working properly, leading only to the accumulation of metal and not to its 



Chapter V 

   Page | 171  

detoxification. The decrease observed for the second stage of maturity reinforces this 

idea (Figure V.3). Further investigations on the uptake of Pb are needed to assess this 

hypothesis. It was shown (Miramand et al. 2006) that embryos present very low metal 

concentrations compared to older cuttlefish, and that concentrations of embryos were 

close or even identical to those measured in the vitellus of newly spawned eggs, which 

suggests that the vitellus contains a sufficient amount of essential metals (Cu, Fe, and 

Zn) needed for the development of the embryos. Considering the classification for 

cuttlefish age (Miramand et al. 2006), the immature cuttlefishes here analysed have 1 to 

2 months, and so have already started to feed. Food is the major source of essential 

elements such as Cu, Fe and Zn (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002b), which 

have low concentrations in seawater, and digestive gland acts in the regulation of Fe, Zn 

and Cu. Despite dietary intakes, the concentrations of Fe and Cu in analysed tissues did 

not vary significantly among cuttlefish life cycle (Table V-IV) and only Zn showed a 

significant increase of the concentration in the analysed tissues (Figure V.3). This could 

be due to mechanisms of homeostatic regulation (Miramand et al., 2006).  

In digestive gland, Zn presented a significant increase (p&lt;0.05) from stage I (243±112 

µg g
-1

.DWT) to stage II (578±270 µg g
-1

.DWT) (Figure V.3), stage I are increased 2.4 

times compared to stage II. This increase between immature and juveniles could be due 

to differences in efficiency of their digestive metabolism (Mangold, 1989 in Bustamante 

et al., 2002b). Regardless of being non-significant (p&gt;0.05) Zn concentration in 

digestive gland almost doubled from stage II (immature adults) to stage III (pre-

posture), this fact might be related to metal physiological changes during sexual 

maturation as reported for S. officinalis from the English Channel (Miramand et al., 

2006). In contrast, the decrease of Zn from stage III (pre-posture) to stage IV (posture) 

may result from higher metabolic requirements in immature individuals to reach 

maturation (Bustamante et al., 2002a,b). 

The digestive gland plays a major role in the energetic metabolism of cephalopods 

(Boucaud-Camou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983 in Bustamante et al., 2006a) and is known 

for accumulating metal in large amounts (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Finger and Smith, 

1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2000), especially for Cd (Figure 

V.4 and Figure V.3). Indeed, during the life cycle of cuttlefish, specifically between 

stage I and stage IV, Cd concentrations increased 14 times compared to a factor of 2 for 

mantle. Cd is strongly retained in the tissue of adult cuttlefishes and this increased 

retention capacity occurs almost exclusively in the digestive gland. Several authors 



Chapter V  

| P a g e 172 

reported that the digestive gland play a primary role in the accumulation of Cd in 

cuttlefish (Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a). 

Thus, assimilated Cd that is contained in the digestive gland may be considered as 

actually stored. The lower retention efficiency for Cd noted in immature cuttlefish 

would result from the incomplete development of the digestive gland in early juveniles 

(Bustamante et al., 2002b) and a restrict transfer of this non-essential metal from food 

in earlier stages. Cephalopods such as Sepia officinalis accumulate Cd mainly from diet 

(Bustamante et al., 2002a,b). 

Cephalopods are carnivorous, active predators and because they have very high feedings 

rates, most part of the metals can be assumed to be incorporated via food (Villanueva 

and Bustamante, 2006). Intake pathways also take place from seawater, as it occurs for 

Ag (Bustamante et al., 2004, Miramand et al., 2006). However, for all metals (including 

Hg) there are three possible sources of intake: water (Bustamante et al., 2006a), food 

(Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009) and sediments (Miramand et al., 2006). Nonetheless, it 

has been reported that Hg is mainly accumulated from food, contributing to almost 80% 

of the global metal bioaccumulation (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2009). Mercury is known 

for is capacity of bioaccumulate in marine organisms (Baeyers et al., 2003; Bustamante 

et al., 2006a). The results obtained in this work highlighted this capacity, in fact Hg 

concentration increased significantly (Table V-V and Figure V.3) along the life cycle of 

cuttlefish, presenting an increment of 2 times between stage I and Stage IV. 

 

V.6. Conclusions 

Comparison of metal concentrations in different maturity stages of cuttlefish show that 

cephalopods may accumulate differently along life cycle depending on physiological 

changes and also the characteristics of the analysed element. The results allowed the 

determination of three distinct groups of metals: the ones where the accumulated value 

decreased along the life cycle, as Pb; those where the accumulation increased in the 

tissues with growth (Zn, Cd and Hg); and finally, the metals that remained constant 

along growth, like Fe and Cu. Essential metal (Fe, Zn and Cu) always presented higher 

values than non-essential metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) regardless of the maturity stage of the 

specimen. The main stages of its life are punctuated by important seasonal migrations 

between shallow waters in summer and deeper waters in winter (Gauvrit et al., 1997). 

These migrations may modify the bioaccumulation processes of metals, whereas during 



Chapter V 

   Page | 173  

the migrations the animals move from coastal areas (with metallic inputs of 

anthropogenic origin) to offshore (presumably less polluted than the coast) (Miramand 

et al., 2006). For a better understanding of the accumulation process of metals during 

the life cycle of cuttlefish, further research focusing these migrations are needed to 

improve our knowledge. Indeed, it would be very important to capture cuttlefish before 

the entrance in the Ria de Aveiro to obtain metal concentrations without anthropogenic 

pollution sources that exist within the lagoon.

VI. General Discussion and Conclusions 

This study focus on the distribution patterns, the biology and some reproductive aspects 

of the life cycle of cuttlefish specie in Ria de Aveiro (chapter I). Due to the importance 

of cuttlefish, in diet and local economy of Aveiro region, the accumulation of some 

essential (Fe, Cu and Zn) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) metals in two target tissues 

(mantle and digestive gland) was studied (chapter II). Due to its extreme toxicity, strong 

capacity to persist in aquatic ecosystems and to the historical discharges of the chlor-

alkali industry in Ria de Aveiro, mercury levels, in mantle and digestive gland, were 

studied separately from other mentioned metals in chapter III. Other demanding aspect 

was to investigate the patterns of accumulation of all above mentioned metals (Fe, Cu, 

Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg) as well as their seasonal variation with age in chapter IV.  

Cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is an economically important target specie for Portuguese 

fisheries (Serrano, 1992), namely for Ria de Aveiro (Docapesca – Statistical 

Department, 2013). This work was performed at Ria de Aveiro (Aveiro lagoon) that is 

characterized by a large number of other smaller channels between which lie significant 

intertidal areas, essentially mudflats, salt marshes and old salt pans (Picado et al., 2010). 

Aveiro Lagoon is affected by a vast number of anthropogenic pressures: a) population 

settlement, the municipalities encircling this system are populated by 350,000 

inhabitants (INE, 2011); b) industries (chemical, metallurgic, ceramics, tannery and 

pulp milling (Pacheco et al., 2005); c) agriculture and cattle rearing (Vasconcelos et al., 

2007); c) offshore fisheries and fish and shellfish capture inside the lagoon (Pastorinho 

et al., 2012); d) the sizeable number of abandoned mines draining to the Vouga River or 

its tributaries (Delgado et al. 2000). Anthropogenic factors affect water quality and also 

influence the recruitment of several species in the lagoon (especially the migratory 

species like cuttlefish). Historical discharges of industrial and domestic effluents in Ria 

de Aveiro (Hall, 1982; Pereira et al., 2009a), for many years, affected the community of 

aquatic individuals that live in the wide diversity of characteristic habitats of this 

aquatic systems (Pombo and Rebelo, 2002). 

Several factors should be considered when studying the distribution of organisms such 

as seasonality, catchment size, estuary size and type, habitat type, near shore marine 

conditions, physical constrictions, the occurrence and severity of floods, salinity 

gradients, the ability of species to adjust to salinity and temperature fluctuations, 

dissolved oxygen levels, turbidity, food availability, predation, competition,

reproductive conditions and habitat degradation (pollution and dredging) (Whitfield, 

1996). Some of these factors cannot be achieved under field conditions, and in this 

study, abiotic factors like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH and 

salinity were measured to comprehend cuttlefish distribution in Ria the Aveiro. Among 

the five factors studied, the two factors that seemed to be relevant to determine the 

presence or the absence of cuttlefish in the lagoon were the salinity and depth. 

Salinity fluctuations in Ria the Aveiro depend mainly upon the balance between 

freshwater inflow and the tidal regime, with evaporation playing a major role in lagoon 

systems with a large surface area. The results obtained in this work suggest that, the 

cuttlefishes in Ria the Aveiro are therefore more tolerant to higher than lower salinity 

conditions, which is in close agreement with values obtained for optimum embryonic 

development and growth of young cuttlefish (36-37), under aquaculture conditions 

(Domingues et al., 2001; Domingues et al., 2004; Baeza-Rojano et al., 2010). Indeed, 

the entrance of cuttlefish in the lagoon may delay or suffer an interruption due to the 

presence of freshwater (Jorge and Sobral, 2004). This is relevant because within the 

lagoon some areas are affected by freshwater flooding (especially the sites near the 

main rivers) and others by marine tides, whereas salinity is typically of marine 

environments.  

Areão (ARE), the site without cuttlefishes, is the site located further away from the sea, 

so exhibits only minor tidal effects and also receives freshwater from lagoons (located 

to the South) through a system of ditches whose input is calculated as 1.9 m
3
 s

-1
 

(Rodrigues et al. 2009), both factors contribute to a very low salinity. This site presents 

the lower limits of salinity and depth, what may justify the absence of cutlefish. 

Marine tide regulates the salinity in Aveiro lagoon but also influences the depth of sites, 

mainly the sites near the mouth of the lagoon. Indeed the sites that presented the highest 

values of depth were POR, SJA and GAF, all near the sea.  

The abiotic characteristics observed seem to favor the colonization of the lagoon by 

cuttlefish, practically throughout the year, although with marked fluctuations in 

abundance.  

S. officinalis reproduces only once, over a short period at the end of its life (Mangold, 

1963). One of the most important characteristic of its life cycle is the seasonal 

migrations between shallow waters in summer and deeper waters waters in winter 

(Gauvrit et al., 1997). Cuttlefish live approximately two years and exhibit mass 

mortality of adults after spawning period (Boletzky, 1983). Abiotic parameters such as 



Chapter VI 

   Page | 183  

salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc., affect the development of the 

Sepia officinalis in its life cycle (Richard, 1971; Palmegiano and D’apote, 1983; 

Bouchaud and Daguzan, 1990; Domingues et al., 2001). Temperature clearly plays a 

major role in determining the life span of S. officinalis (Richard, 1971; Forsythe et al. 

1991, 1994). 

The life cycle of cuttlefish in Ria de Aveiro starts with the entrance of adults entering 

reproduction period in spring. The reproduction peak is reached in summer, when water 

temperature begins to increase, and apparently ends with the death of post-spawning 

individuals and later in autumn with the return of new borned cuttlefish to sea. This 

structure of reproductive life cycle presented in the Ria de Aveiro is in accordance to 

others geographical areas, like the English Channel (Dunn, 1999; Wang et al., 2003 and 

Challier et al., 2005); the Estuary of Sado in Setúbal (Portugal) (Neves et al., 2009) and 

the French coast (Morbihan Bay) (Blanc et al., 1998).  

The length of mature individuals caught in Ria de Aveiro suggests that cuttlefish 

breeders were in their first year of life. The energy required for the sexual development 

of males and females of cuttlefish is quite different (Dunn, 1999). Males attain sexual 

maturity earlier than females (Gauvrit et al., 1997) being usually smaller than females 

(Pinczon-du-Sel and Daguzan, 1997). These facts explain the significant differences 

between weight-length relationships of different sexes in cuttlefish. Richard (1971) and 

Boletzky (1979) showed that reared cuttlefish growth was sigmoid. Forsythe and Van 

Heukelem (1987) described a two – phase curve, with an exponential phase followed by 

a logarithmic phase.  

Cephalopods are known for their ability to accumulate high levels of essential elements 

and non-essential elements (Martin and Flegal, 1975; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; 

Bustamante et al., 1998a, b; Bustamante et al., 2000; Raimundo et al., 2004). 

Considering these two facts, the historical problem of pollution of Ria de Aveiro and the 

strong capacity of cuttlefish to accumulate exogenous compounds, this study tried to 

understand the patterns of metal accumulation in S. officinalis in Ria de Aveiro. 

One of the most important metals presented in the aquatic systems is mercury (Hg), 

since it is widely considered to be among the top priorities in environmental pollutants 

in the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and at a global scale 

(Pereira et al., 2009b). Ria de Aveiro is not an exception regarding the importance of 

this metal within the lagoon, in fact the studied area has historical discharges of 

effluents from the chlor-alkali industry of the industrial complex of Estarreja into 



Chapter VI 

| P a g e 184 

Laranjo bay (Lucas et al., 1986; Hall et al., 1985; Pereira et al., 1998; Monterroso et al., 

2003b). Nowadays, the Laranjo bay is a non-significant active source of Hg since the 

discharges stopped in 1985, however it is still an internal source of Hg due to the 

sediments that have been highly contaminated with Hg (Hall et al., 1985; Coelho et al., 

2008). Hg distribution in Ria de Aveiro showed that levels of Hg in the lagoon are low 

with the exception of Laranjo bay that presented higher values. However, only one 

individual of all the examined cuttlefishes presented an Hg level above the limit 

permitted, so we can conclude that the cuttlefish caught in the lagoon are not a concern 

for human health. Once more, abiotic parameters interfered with life of cuttlefish, 

because temperature can contribute to a higher methylation rate (Bustamante et al., 

2006a), which could lead to a higher uptake of mercury by aquatic organisms. The 

historical contamination of Laranjo bay and the higher values of temperature observed 

in this sampling site can explain the higher values of Hg in this specific area of the Ria 

de Aveiro. The Hg contained in the sediments may become available to biota (Coelho et 

al., 2007), eventually to food chain thru the benthic organisms (Bryan and Langston, 

1992; Lee et al., 1998; Warren et al. 1998), or be remobilized when sediments are 

dredged and disposed into water bodies (Newell et al., 1998; Chapman et al., 2003). 

Similarly the high Cd concentrations in Ria de Aveiro is also the result of the industrial 

complex of Estarreja, near the Laranjo bay, and the contamination of others locals of the 

lagoon are made by transport of contaminated sediments and water along the lagoon by 

the tide currents of Ria the Aveiro (Pereira et al., 1998b, Monterroso et al., 2003a) and 

by plankton exportation (Monterroso et al., 2003b). Bustamante et al. (2000) suggested 

that high Cd levels in digestive gland of species captured in contaminated areas are also 

related to the environment. 

Metal concentrations increase as the distance to the sea increase. This pattern of metals 

distribution in digestive gland appears to reflect the location of anthropogenic sources 

of metals discharged in the northern region of Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a). 

Laranjo (LAR) and Torreira (TOR) are, probably, the most contaminated areas, 

presenting the highest values of essential (Fe, Zn, Cu) and non-essential (Cd and Pb) 

metals in the digestive gland. The high values in Torreira (TOR) suggest that this site 

suffers the influence of Largo da Coroa, considered the second most contaminated area 

after Laranjo bay in Ria de Aveiro (Monterroso et al., 2003a).  

For metal-metal relationship in digestive gland and mantle, only Pb presented a low 

correlation between the two tissues. Only the ratio Cd:Cu in digestive gland presented a 



Chapter VI 

   Page | 185  

positive correlation with wet body weight, meaning that Cd was progressively 

sequestrated in digestive gland with age. This pattern was also observed for S. 

officinalis in Pereira et al. (2009b) and for O. vulgaris in Raimundo et al. (2005). 

The non-essential metal Cd, when in high concentrations in digestive gland, can 

compete with Zn and Cu (essential metals) for the same ligands, specific 

metalloproteins presented in digestive gland of cephalopods, since they have similarities 

in chemical behaviour (Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998a). For this 

reason, significant correlations between Cd-Cu and Cd-Zn were expected, as found in 

Pereira et al. (2009b), although only Cd and Cu in digestive gland showed the expected 

behaviour. Since essential elements like Cu tend to be maintained at a fairly constant 

concentrations in tissues, Cd:Cu ratios increase in cephalopods contaminated by Cd 

(Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira et al., 2009b). Measured 

levels of Cd in cuttlefish tissues, despite being below legal limits, may lead to some 

concern for human consumption. 

The cuttlefish S. officinalis feeds on a large variety of living prey, including small 

molluscs, crabs, shrimps, other cuttlefish, and juvenile demersal fishes. Crustaceans and 

fishes, which are preferential preys of cuttlefish (Pinczon du Sel et al., 1997; Pinczon du 

Sel et al., 2000), also accumulate more Hg than other species (Schuhmacher et al., 

1994).  

Mercury is considered to be one of the most problematic metals in marine ecosystems 

due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs (EPA, 2001). 

Various studies reported Hg concentrations in different tissues (Alcobia, 1995; Buzina 

et al., 1989; Stoeppler et al., 1979; Rossi et al., 1993; Seixas et al., 2005a; Raimundo et 

al., 2004, 2010; Bustamante et al., 2008). Mercury concentrations in the Aveiro lagoon 

are greatly influenced by the historical discharges of mercury from industrial activities 

into Laranjo Bay (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., 2009a), leading to Hg 

concentrations higher than other ecosystems also polluted, like Kastela Bay in Adriatic 

that is known for receiving discharges of Hg from mine exploitation (Faganeli et al., 

2003).  

Like other metals, Hg concentrations in cephalopod may vary with biological factors 

such as age (size), sex and maturity stage (Bustamante et al., 1998a; Raimundo et al., 

2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Ayas and Ozogul, 2011). It is generally admitted that Hg 

concentrations in cephalopod tissues are positively correlated with size (Monteiro et al., 



Chapter VI 

| P a g e 186 

1992; Rossi et al., 1993; Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 1999 in Bustamante et al., 2006a), 

however, due to restrict range of size of captured individuals this couldn’t be verified.  

While the mantle is a body compartment that can store Hg in significant amounts, the 

digestive gland plays a major role in storage and detoxification of several metals. The 

different patterns of accumulation of trace metals and Hg suggest that cephalopods have 

different mechanisms/rates of uptake and/or sequestration of these metals (Pierce et al., 

2008). This contrast between trace metals and Hg partitioning was also observed in 

other cephalopods (Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas et al., 2005a; Bustamante et al., 

2006a).  

Metal bioaccumulation in cephalopods is usually related to a single organ, mainly the 

digestive gland, known to play a major role in the energetic metabolism of cephalopods 

(Boucaud-Camou and Boucher-Rodoni, 1983 in Bustamante et al., 2006a). The 

digestive gland is known to accumulate metal in large amounts (Martin and Flegal, 

1975; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante et al., 2000). 

This organ is deeply involved in the metabolism of Zn, Cu and Cd (Martin and Flegal, 

1975; Smith et al., 1984; Finger and Smith, 1987; Miramand and Guary, 1980; 

Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a). The mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in 

the digestive gland are much higher than the mean concentrations of those metals in 

mantle while Hg presents similar levels in both tissues. Metal concentrations in different 

maturity stages of cuttlefish show that the accumulation is different for each stage of 

their life cycle (Bustamante et al., 2002b; Bustamante et al., 2004; Bustamante et al., 

2006b; Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). The results obtained in this studied 

determine that some metals remain constant along the age (Fe and Cu); others increase 

along maturity stage (Cd, Zn and Hg) and some decrease with age (Pb). Seasonal 

migrations evidenced in the life cycle of S. officinalis may interfere with 

bioaccumulation processes of metals, since cuttlefish migrates from coastal areas (more 

polluted) to offshore (less polluted than coast) (Miramand et al., 2006). 

In digestive gland, Zn presented a significant increase from stage I (243±112 µg g-

1.DWt) to stage II (578±270 µg g-1.DWt), stage I presented a value 2.4 times higher 

than stage II. This increase between immature and juveniles could be due to differences 

in efficiency of their digestive metabolism (Mangold, 1989 in Bustamante et al., 

2002b).  

The levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb in the digestive gland are higher than those found 

in mantle, what is in close agreement with other cephalopod species (Raimundo et al., 



Chapter VI 

   Page | 187  

2004; Raimundo et al., 2005; Pereira, 2003; Pereira et al., 2009b). These metals, in S. 

officinalis are preferentially accumulated in the digestive gland. Various studies 

confirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods concentrates high levels of Zn and 

Cu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd (Miramand and Guary, 1980; 

Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002a).  

In general, metal concentrations measured in this study for mantle and digestive gland 

of S. officinalis were higher, when compared with values reported for same species and 

other cephalopods of various studies, but comparable to previous studies along the 

Portuguese coast (Pereira et al., 2009b; Seixas et al., 2005b; Raimundo et al., 2005, 

2008). Nevertheless, comparisons between specimens from different ecosystems must 

be done carefully as identical species may exhibit different feeding habits, growth rates 

and habitats, which may interfere with metal accumulation (Bustamante et al., 1998b; 

Raimundo et al., 2004; Pierce et al., 2008). 

Extremely high values of Cd were found in the mantle of specimens captured in Laranjo 

(LAR) but a relatively low value of this element was found in the digestive gland. The 

increase of Cd in mantle, without a corresponding increase in the digestive gland, where 

this element is stored (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a; Bustamante et al., 

2002b) suggests that the levels in mantle result from a higher transference of Cd in 

water, most likely as a result of uptake through the diet (Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante 

et al., 2002b). For Cd the values obtained in all sites of Ria de Aveiro are higher than 

the values measured in previous studies.  

The similarity of Hg levels in mantle and digestive gland could be explained by the 

affinity of mantle to store MeHg, i.e. predominant form of Hg stored in muscle tissue 

(Harris et al., 2003; Amlund et al., 2007). However, compared to other metals like Cd, 

the role of digestive gland in storage of Hg appears to be relatively limited. This may be 

due to a preferential redistribution of Hg to muscular tissues as methylmercury (MeHg) 

(Bustamante et al., 2006a).  

The most striking result was the extremely high value of Pb in the digestive gland of 

immature specimens. This aspect can be related with the source of intake of this metal. 

To the best of our knowledge, no data on the respective proportions of elements 

incorporated from food and seawater has been published for cephalopods. So we 

consider that there were two possibilities for this value, the food ingested by immature 

specimens is probably highly contaminated with Pb or the specimens were subjected to 

an acute exposure and recent uptake of Pb by seawater. On these immature specimens,

being on an early stage of maturation, the digestive gland may not be working properly, 

leading only to the accumulation of metal and not to its detoxification. It was shown 

(Miramand et al. 2006) that embryos present very low metal concentrations compared 

to older cuttlefish, and that concentrations of embryos were close or even identical to 

those measured in the vitellus of newly spawned eggs, which suggests that the vitellus 

contains a sufficient amount of essential metals (Cu, Fe, and Zn) needed for the 

development of the embryos.  

During the life cycle of cuttlefish, specifically between stage I and stage IV, Cd 

concentrations increased 14 times, in the digestive gland, compared to a factor of 2 for 

mantle. Cd is strongly retained in the tissue of adult cuttlefishes and this high retention 

capacity concerned almost exclusively the digestive gland. Several authors reported that 

the digestive gland play a primary role in the accumulation of Cd in cuttlefish 

(Miramand and Bentley, 1992; Bustamante, 1998; Bustamante et al., 2002a). Thus, 

assimilated Cd in the digestive gland may be considered as actually stored. The lower 

retention efficiency for Cd measured in immature cuttlefish would result from the 

incomplete development of the digestive gland in early juveniles (Bustamante et al., 

2002b) and a restrict transfer of this non-essential metal from food in earlier stages. 

Cephalopods such as Sepia officinalis accumulate Cd mainly from diet (Bustamante et 

al., 2002b). 

The results revealed that the digestive gland of S. officinalis has an extraordinary 

capacity to store harmful elements like Cd and Pb, but also essential elements like Fe, 

Zn and Cu. Several studies also confirmed that the digestive gland of cephalopods 

concentrates high levels of Zn and Cu, and have an exceptional ability to store Cd 

(Miramand and Guary, 1980; Bustamante et al., 1998b, 2002b). However, the digestive 

gland presented other functions like redistribution of metals to others tissues, and for 

these reasons the digestive gland is consider a good biomarker of contamination for 

metals in cuttlefish. Due to the species mobility together with the influence of local food 

composition at different sites of the lagoon, metal concentrations in tissues cannot be 

exclusively viewed as direct reflex of environmental conditions. However, the obtained 

results and all that has been published suggest that the major source of contamination in 

Ria de Aveiro is the large complex of chemical industries located near the lagoon. The 

continuous effluent discharge had a considerable impact on bottom sediments (OSPAR, 

2000). Sediments act as source and sink for pollution, because once the pollutants are 

introduced, they may remain accumulated in soil for several years, even after removal 



Chapter VI 

   Page | 189  

of the sources (Paterson et al., 1996; Hursthouse, 2001; Wong et al., 2006). For 

example, Ria de Aveiro still have a gradient contamination in the sediments (Pereira et 

al., 1998 and Coelho et al., 2005) because of the continuous direct discharges, since the 

1950s of the chlor-alkali industry. Soil contamination resulting from anthropogenic 

activities may derive from both diffuse and local sources and is generally reflected by 

enhanced concentrations of acidifying contaminants (e.g. SO2, NOx), metals (e.g. 

cadmium, lead, mercury), metalloids such as arsenic, and organic compounds (such as 

pesticides, herbicides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated 

biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins (PCDDs) (EC, 2002). According to Scullion (2006) the 

main anthropogenic sources of soil contaminants are mining and smelting; fossil fuel 

combustion; sewage sludge; process and manufacturing industries (specifically 

metallurgical, electronics and chemical); waste disposal; the land spreading of 

fertilizers, fungicides and other agricultural materials; atmospheric deposition from 

traffic; waste incineration; the spillage of liquids such as solvents or oil; and practices of 

irrigation with contaminated waters. For Aveiro Lagoon previous studies (Pastorinho et 

al., 2012) considered that the major sources of sediments contamination are the 3 main 

watercourses (Caster, Antuã, and Vouga). However, Ria de Aveiro is influenced by 

strong marine tides (70 x 106 m
3
, in Picado et al. 2010), which redistributes sediment 

bound metals. According to Pastorinho et al. (2012), bottom sediments in the Ria de 

Aveiro system are in their majority unpolluted, with few metal hotspots and only these 

sites constitute a risk for biota. These results are in accordance with the ones obtained in 

this work, which demonstrated that the only problematic site were Laranjo bay, 

presenting much higher values of metals. Indeed, these results suggest a gradient of 

contamination in the direction of Laranjo. 

As final conclusion, as shown throughout the present study, there are general 

similarities but also differences between the Ria de Aveiro and other geographical areas 

referred in the study. This emphasizes its uniqueness not only in terms of abiotic 

parameters but especially in the biotic aspects, which enhances the idea that this 

transitional ecosystem should be deeply studied for this specie. Indeed the Ria the 

Aveiro is the only typically estuarine coastal lagoon, all the others sites represented the 

offshore or presented a higher communication with the offshore. 

This study has provided the first attempt to explain the seasonal and spatial variations in 

the reproductive life cycle of the cuttlefish in a wide range of sites in the Ria de Aveiro,

having in consideration historical discharges in the lagoon, and the results revealed 

different patterns in the accumulation of different metals along the life cycle.  

Future research should be addressed in order to enable a progressive understanding of 

the role of cuttlefish in Ria de Aveiro. New studies focused on the trophic ecology for 

cuttlefish should be made to better understand the predatory impact of this specie in fish 

community of the lagoon.
