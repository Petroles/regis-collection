A presente dissertação apresenta uma análise estratigráfica e palinológica integrada 
de uma secção de Cretácico Superior amostrada nos níveis basais da sucessão carbo-
natada exposta na arriba sul do promontório da Nazaré, com particular incidência 
no estudo quantitativo dos quistos de dinoflagelados de parede orgânica. Com uma 
idade Cenomaniano inferior terminal a médio, esta secção tem sido interpretada 
como registando a transição de um ambiente marinho aberto de plataforma interna a 
ambiente marginal marinho restrito (lagunar) entre o final do Cenomaniano inferior 
e o início do Cenomaniano médio. Onze amostras foram recolhidas em quatro níveis 
margosos selecionados ao longo do perfil estratigráfico e preparadas para análise ao 
microscópio, através de técnicas palinológicas normalizadas. Nove amostras ofere-
ceram um conteúdo palinológico diversificado, incluindo quistos de dinoflagelados, 
esporos, grãos de pólen, foraminíferos, algas e acritarcas. As associações de dinoquistos 
apresentaram uma diversidade reduzida, sendo fortemente dominadas pelo peridi-
nióide eurialino Subtilisphaera sp.. As inferências paleoambientais e paleoecológicas 
autorizadas pelos dinoquistos foram consistentes com reconstituições paleogeográ-
ficas de um ambiente lagunar propostas anteriormente para o Cenomaniano mé-
dio da região da Nazaré. A idade sugerida da sucessão estratigráfica, com base nas 
associações de dinoquistos, foi cenomaniana inferior a superior, mais tardia do que 
a idade cenomaniana inferior a média suportada pela convergência de vários outros 
indicadores bioestratigrágicos. Não se verificaram ganhos de resolução bioestratigrá-
fica relativamente à distinção entre subandares do Cenomaniano. As comparações 
com associações coevas de dinoquistos do Noroeste da Europa e com associações do 
Cretáceo Superior da Plataforma Castelhana acentuaram, sobretudo, a especificidade 
paleoambiental marcada do setor da Nazaré durante o Cenomaniano médio, com 
características de tipo lagunar.

Resumo





IX 

This work consists of an integrated stratigraphic and palynological analysis of an 

Upper Cretaceous section sampled at the base of the carbonate succession exposed 

on the south side of the Nazaré promontory, with a particular focus on the 

quantitative study of organic-walled dinocysts. The studied section has a proposed 

late early-middle Cenomanian age, and has been interpreted as recording a transition 

from an open inner shelf during the late early Cenomanian to a marginal-marine 

lagoonal environment at the early middle Cenomanian. A total of 11 bulk samples 

were collected from four marly layers selected along the section and subsequently 

prepared for microscopic analysis following standard palynological techniques. 

Nine of them yielded a diversified palynological content, including dinocysts, 

miospores, foraminifera test linings, blue-green algae and acritarchs. Dinocysts 

assemblages presented a relatively low diversity and were strongly dominated by 

the euryhaline peridinioid Subtilisphaera sp.. Dinocysts-based palaeoenvironmental 

and palaeoecological inferences were consistent with previous palaeogeographic 

reconstructions of a mid-Cenomanian lagoonal setting for the Nazaré range. The 

suggested age of the sampled succession, when based on dinocysts, is older than 

the upper Cenomanian, but higher than the lower to middle Cenomanian dating 

robustly supported by several other biostratigraphic markers. No improvement of the 

biostratigraphic resolution of Cenomanian substages could be obtained. Comparisons 

with coeval dinocysts assemblages of Northwest Europe and Upper Cretaceous 

assemblages of the Castilian Platform were mostly supportive of a highly specific local 

mid-Cenomaninan palaeoenvironment in the Nazaré sector, with characteristics of 

a lagoonal type.

Key-words: Dinoflagellate cysts, Biostratigraphy, Palaeoecology, Cenomanian, 

Nazaré (West Portugal).

1.1. PRESENTATION AND PERTINENCE OF THE THEME

The Western Portuguese Carbonate Platform (WPCP) is one of several European 

and North-African extended rimmed shelves that bordered the northern branch 

of the Tethyan Realm during a long term interval of worldwide sea level increase 

and eustatic highstand that occurred at the middle part of Cretaceous Period (e.g. 

Haq, 2014; Hancock &amp;amp; Kaufman, 1979; Hardenbol et al., 1998; Hart, 1990). Its 

depositional setting is related to the Cretaceous development of the Estremadura 

and Beira Litoral onshore sectors of the West Iberian Margin, after the post-rifting 

stage of the Lusitanian Basin (Wilson, 1988; Wilson, Hiscott, Willis, &amp;amp; Gradstein, 

1989; Pinheiro, Wilson, Reis, Whitmarsh, &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 1996; Kullberg, Rocha, Soares, 

Rey, Terrinha, et al., 2006; Rey, Dinis, Callapez, &amp;amp; Cunha, 2006; Dinis, Rey, Cunha, 

Callapez, &amp;amp; Reis 2008). Gradually settled during the Albian and Cenomanian stages 

and persisting to the end of Lower Turonian, its carbonate facies are presently widely 

documented along the onshore of the Western Portuguese Margin or Mesocenozoic 

West Portuguese Border (Soares &amp;amp; Rocha, 1984), in between the parallels of Aveiro 

and Lisbon (Callapez, 2008). Due to its location between North and Central 

Atlantic and North Africa, the WPCP has been the subject of recurrent interest 

concerning the biotic differentiation and mixing across the Tethyan and Temperate 

realms, particularly as regards the biogeographical distribution of rudist reefs and reef 

building corals, other benthic faunas and ammonites (Callapez, 2008).

Among the Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate exposures, the one of Nazaré,

adjoining the fishing village by the same name (see Fig. 1A and B), occupies a hinge 

position between the northern and the southern domains of the WPCP which, 

especially after the middle Cenomanian, display rather distinct facies: limestones 

with rudists and coral buildups at the south, and marly limestones with ammonites 

at the north (Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1984d; Berthou, 

Chancellor, &amp;amp; Lauverjat, 1985; Berthou &amp;amp; Lauverjat, 1979; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 

1998).

This outcrop presents an extended Late Cretaceous sequence, ranging from 

“Bellasian” (Choffat’s (1900) sensu) layers of Albian/early Cenomanian age to the 

lower Turonian (still additionally overlain by Campanian-Maastrichtian siliciclastics) 

(Antunes, 1979), and its thick succession of Cenomanian lagoonal marls and 

limestones are particularly suitable to the study of fossil content (Callapez et al., 

2014). For those reasons, it has long been the subject of systematic stratigraphical 

and palaeontological studies (for a review, see Callapez, 1998, 2008; Hart et al., 2005). 

Distinct macro and micro faunas have been considered in local biostratigraphical 

and palaeoenvironmental studies, or in regional ones that included Nazaré. After the 

pioneering monographs of Paul Choffat (1849-1919), whose datings were mainly 

based on ammonite assemblages (Choffat, 1898, 1900), the French workers Pierre-

Yves Berthou (1973, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1984d) and Jacques Lauverjat (1982) 

reviewd aspects of the biostratigraphical setting and resorted to foraminifera and 

ostracods as stratigraphical biomarkers integrated with ammonoids, echinoids and 

other additional biostratigraphical data. More recently, cephalopod (particularly 

ammonites) assemblages (Callapez, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2008; Callapez &amp;amp; Soares, 

2001; Barroso-Barcenilla, Callapez, Soares, &amp;amp; Segura, 2011) and the foraminifera 

biostratigraphy (Hart et al., 2005) were thoroughly revised from the 1990s onward, 

together with detailed analysys of macrobenthic invertebrate associations (Callapez, 

1998, 2008) and vertebrate remains of the Cenomanian lagoonal levels, including 

fish, turtle, and crocodyliform specimens (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014), for 

biostratigraphic and palaeoecological purposes.

Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

16

Despite several examples of the use of dinoflagellate cysts as biomarkers in 

Cenomanian deposits of the WPCP (e.g., Berthou, Foucher, Lecocq &amp;amp; Moron, 1980; 

Moron, 1981; Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler, 1982), there are no Cenomanian dinocyst 

studies specifically performed on the Nazaré outcrop, except for two samples 

collected by Moron (op. cit.) below the base of the marine carbonate units. The above 

mentioned studies are, to the best of our knowledge, the only ones tackling the 

Upper Cretaceous in Portugal, confirming the scarcity of dinocyst-based studies 

of the Portuguese, and more generally Iberian, Canomanian-Turonian signaled in 

Peyrot (2011). 

Considering the previous scenery, the present work arises as the first step of 

a new scientific project concearning the palynological research of dinoflagellates 

and dinocysts in the Upper Cretaceous of Portugal. Particularly, it focuses the study 

of a stratigraphical section sampled in the basal marl and limestone beds exposed 

in the south side of the Nazaré promontory, with an upper lower to basal middle 

Cenomanian record, and a particular focus on the preliminary quantitative study 

of organic-walled dinocysts. From a palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological 

standpoint, this particular section has been interpreted as recording the transition 

from an open inner shelf during the late early Cenomanian to a more constrained 

lagoonal environment in the mid part of this stage (Callapez et al., 2014). 

1.2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 

As an interdisciplinary work that focuses integrated aspects of general stratigraphy, 

taxonomy of organic-walled dinocysts and palaeoecology, the present study is 

centered on several general and specific main objectives.

The general aim of the research is to detail our knowledge on the dinoflagellate 

cysts from the early to lower Cenomanian transition in the shallow carbonate facies 

of the WPCP at the locality of Nazaré, one of the main sections for the study of this 

time span in the West Portuguese Margin.  

Taken as specific objectives, the purported goals of the study are: 

(1) To complement previous local biostratigraphic analyses of the basal section of

the carbonate formation by using dinocyst-based data as an additional biotic

calibration;
(2) To use the acknowledged potential of dinocyst assemblages as palaeoenviron-

mental tracers, and their marked provincialism, to enhance the reconstruction

of local palaeogeographical domains and their associated palaecology in the

lower and middle Cenomanian (much less studied in the Iberian Peninsula 

than the upper Cenomanian and Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, associated 

with the Bonarelli Event; e.g., Callapez, 2001, 2003; Hart et al., 2005; Barroso-

Barcenilla et al., 2011); 

(3) To obtain an exploratory view of the similarities and differences with the 

associations of dinocysts taxa in stratigraphically equivalent regions in NW 

Europe (Lignum, 2009); as noticed in Berthou et al. (1980), dinocysts of 

the Mesogean (Tethyan) province are less known than those of the Boreal 

province and might contribute to an understanding of the palaeogeographical 

differentiation/articulation between them;

(4) To contribute thereby to an integrated approach for a better knowledge of 

Tethyan carbonate platforms in the Iberian Peninsula, within the geodynamic 

context of the Atlantic and Mediterranean margins.

1.3. STRUCTURE OF THE WORK

The dissertation unfolds across 8 chapters, including the present one (Introduction) and 

a final discussion at the end. Chapter 2 presents the main geological setting, including 

an overall characterization of the Lusitanian Basin and the Western Portuguese 

Carbonate Platform (WPCP). Chapter 3 presents the stratigraphical framework 

at several levels, moving from a characterization of the Cenomanian-Turonian 

stratigraphy of the carbonate platform to a more focused stratigraphical description 

of the Nazaré sector, and finally narrowing down to the stratigraphic column elected 

for study, located at the base of the southern exposures of the Nazaré promontory. 

Chapter 4 conveys the essentials of dinoflagellates biology and morphology. Chapter 5 

addresses the taxonomic, biostratigraphic (cyst zonations) and palaeoecological issues 

related to the use of dinocysts as biomarkers, while also including a quick overview 

of dynocyst-based studies conducted in Portugal. Chapters 6 and 7 constitute the 

empirical part of the dissertation. The methods (e.g., the sampling of the geological 

column) and procedures (pre-laboratorial and laboratorial processing, leading to the 

microscopic analysis of the palynological content in the samples) are described in 

chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents the analyzed data under the form of tables, graphs, and 

summary statistics, and characterizes them with a view to their biostratigraphical 

and palaeoecological significance. Chapter 8, under the heading of “final discussion”, 

summarizes the main findings, discusses the limits and scope of the study, and tackles 

directions for future research.





19

The Lower part of the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary record in Portugal is mainly 

represented by the West Portuguese Carbonate Platform (WPCP) in the West-Central 

part of the continental margin of Iberia (Berthou, 1984b; Callapez, 1998). From a 

geological standpoint, the WPCP is related to the the Cretaceous development of 

the onshore sector of the Western Iberian (Portuguese) Margin, after the end of the 

distensive phase of the Lusitanian Basin in the late Aptian (Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg 

et al., 2006; Pinheiro et al., 1996) and during a long-term Albian to Late Cenomian 

eustatic sea-level rise leading to the formation of a number of European and North-

African shallow marine carbonate platforms along the borders of the northern branch 

ot the Tethyan Realm (Callapez, 2004, 2008). 

This platform overlies a nearly 5000 m thick Triassic to Jurassic and Early 

Cretaceous sedimentary record reflecting the geotectonic evolution of the Lusitanian 

Basin (Fig. 1A) across several rifting and post-tecnonic relaxation intervals (Rocha 

&amp;amp; Soares, 1984), until the formation of ocean crust wich marks the transition of the 

Western Central Portuguese margin to a passive margin (Callapez, 2008; Kullberg 

et al., 2014). While depositional processes occurring in the passive margin were no 

longer genetically associated with the rifting Basin (Kullberg et al., 2014), they were 

still constrained by its deep structuring into several sectors on the basis of a system of 

inherited late-Variscan faults and salt tectonics (Ribeiro et al., 1979). 

The main litostratigraphic units of these sectors (Northern, Central and 

Southern sectors, according to Rocha and Soares, 1984: see Fig. 2A) have been a 

longstanding subject of study from diverse standpoints (e.g., lithological, stratigraphic,

sedimentary, palaeographical) and underwent consecutive revisions (see Kullberg, 

2000, for an overview). Specificically for the Cretaceous onshore sedimentary 

record of the Western Central Portuguese Margin, a litostratigraphic synthesis, along 

with an interpretation of the main allogenic controls, is provided by Dinis et al. 

(2008), ranging from Berrasian to Middle Campanian-Maastrichtian deposits (see 

Fig. 1C) and distinguishing between a Northern and a Southern sector (separated 

by the Caldas da Rainha parallel). Transgressive and regressive episodes, under both 

eustatic and tectonic control, played a fundamental role in the deposition history, 

with transgressive events usually marked by carbonate intercalations and carbonate 

platforms (Dinis et al., 2008, Kullberg et al., 2006). In particular, after a regressive 

trend during the late Aptian and the Aptian-Albian transition (Moron 1981), a long-

term eustatic rise with an Albian onset gave way to the diachronic establishement 

of a carbonate platform in the southern domain (region of Lisbon), at first, and 

extending progressivelly up North all along the Cenomanian, to reach a maximum of 

carbonate sedimentation (full infill of the Lusitanian Basin) during the initial Upper 

Cenomanien (Callapez, 2008; Dinis et al., 2008) (see Fig. 2B). After this maximal 

Cretaceous transgression, the carbonate platform underwent a regressive episode 

(associated with an uplift of the continental margin), with progradation and fluvial 

incision, but still persisted to the end of Lower Turonian, after which it consistently 

gave way to the progradation of micaceous alluvial sands over realms of the platform 

(Callapez, 2004, 2008). 

The Cretaceous carbonate outcrops of the Western Portuguese Margin are 

irregularly spread along the coastline in between the parallels of Aveiro and Lisbon, 

following the overall NNE-SSW orientation of the passive margin (see Fig. 1B). 

Reflecting the additional role of NE-SW and E-W oriented reactivated hercyinian 

faults and regional halokynetic structures, leading to somewhat different tectonic-

sedimentary evolutions for different regions, a northern and a southern domain can 

be distinguished, delimited by the tectonic axis Caldas da Rainha-Nazaré-Pombal 

(Callapez, 1998, 2008; Dinis, Rey, Cunha, Callapez, &amp;amp; Reis, 2008; Dinis et al., 2015:). 

Lower Cretaceous sequences, namely Albian marine and lower Cenomanian, are 

only clearly identified in the southern domain, while the later phases of deposition, 

namely marine Lower Turonian, are only represented in the northern domain 

(Berthou et al., 1980), with a broad representation of a middle Cenomanian 

to lower Turonian carbonate platform, and of later Turonian to Maastrichtian 

marine and fluvial siliciclastics (Dinis, Rey, Cunha, Callapez, &amp;amp; Reis, 2008).

In addition to their distinct ages and stratigraphic facies, these two domains have 

also been recognized as distinct palaeogeographic and palaeoclimate realms, with 

significant palaeoecological implications regarding the distribution and diversity of 

shallow-water marine biota (Callapez, 1998, 2008). Contrasting to the setting up of 

a rimmed platform displaying a predominance of coral reef complexes and rudist 

build-ups in the southern domain, open platform domains developed in the northern 

sector with a prodominance of ammonite facies along with benthic faunas (Berthou, 

1973, 1984b; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008). Domain diversity, wich 

was also favoured by local uplift movements along the diapiric axes, was greater 

in the northern sector after the initial upper Cenomanian major transgression, 

exhibiting strong lateral variation in facies (Callapez, 1998, 2003, 2004). Thanks to 

its palaeoenvironmental diversity (inner shelfs, reefs, lagoons, aluvial plains, etc.) and 

its linkage to the evolution of the West Iberian Margin in between the Northern 



Geological setting

23

and Central Atlantic and the African plate, the Cenomanian-Turonian Carbonate 

Platform has a distinctive importance for the overall articulation between the Tethyan 

and the Boreal realms (Berthou et al., 1980; Dinis &amp;amp; Cunha, 2004), particularly as 

regards the understanding of faunal change and mixing between Northern Tethys, 

North-Africa and the Temperate Domain of West Europe (Callapez, 2008). 

The present study will be concerned with the base of the Upper Cretaceous 

Cenomanian platform, with a focus on the region of Nazaré. As indicated above, Nazaré 

occupies a hinge position in between the northern and the southern palaeogeographic 

domains. The Lower Cretaceous series, best represented in the Lisbon Peninsula, 

can still be documented at the exposures of Nazaré, which additionally present a 

rich depositional series for the entire Cenomanian, including a brecciated endokarst 

correlative of the Cenomanian-Turonian transition that stands as a first sign of the 

future inversion of the basin (Berthou et al., 1980; Corrochano, Reis, &amp;amp; Armenteros, 

1998; Dinis &amp;amp; Cunha, 2004; Reis, Corrochano, &amp;amp; Armenteros, 1997; Callapez, 2014) 

The identity of this boundary region as regards both the Lisbon Peninsula and the 

northern subdomain has allowed for the further distinction between a northern and 

a central sector of the carbonate platform in the Cenomanian-Turonian sucessions 

(Callapez, 2008).

3.1. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH

The study of the Portuguese Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate units has a century-

old tradition. Research was initiated by Daniel Sharpe (1806-1856) during the 

decades of 1830-40, among other XIXth century pionneers, and continued by Paul 

Choffat (1849-1919) and collaborators, from 1880 until the beginning of XX century. 

As a Swiss geologist based in Portugal, Choffat collaborated with the Geological 

Commission of the Kingdom for the detailed description of the stratigraphy, 

palaeontology and cartography of the Portuguese Mesozoic (Antunes, 1986). His 

first major study on the Cretaceous System dates back to 1885, and the section of 

Nazareth was described in 1894 attached to the monograph by Gaston de Saporta 

(1823-1895) on palaeobotany.

From 1960s onwards the works of Soares (e.g., 1966, 1972, 1980), focusing 

particularly on the region of Baixo Mondego, provided important contributions 

(França &amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1963). In the 1970s and 1980s, studies by P.-Y. Berthou, J. 

Lauverjat and collaborators have allowed the establishment of new biostratigraphic 

scales for the Cenomanian-Turonian (e.g., Berthou, 1984a, 1984b, Berthou et al., 

1980, 1985). Special note is due to the monographs by Berthou (1973) and Lauverjat 

(1982), where the outcrop of Nazaré was again taken up and its microfacies and 

associations of foraminifera and ostracods were addressed.

Starting in the 1990s, this study was resumed and the stratigraphy and 

invertebrates content revised north of Nazaré (e.g., Callapez, 1998, 2008). Foraminifera

biostratigraphy was tackled by Hart et al. (2005) and the ammonite biostratigraphy 

synthesized in Barroso-Barcenilla et al. (2011). The section of Nazaré was remade by 

Callapez (1998, 2001) and Callapez et al. (2014), including the study of the vertebrates 

of Cenomanian lagoonal levels.

The vast majority of these and other studies to date addressed stratigraphic 

successions located across the onshore regions of Estremadura and Beira Litoral, from 

Lisbon to Figueira da Foz and Nazaré-Leiria-Coimbra, which may be classified into 

one of the three sectors mentioned above: northern, central and southern.

3.2. GENERAL LITOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOSTRATIGRAPHY

The Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate series is part of a megasequence ranging from 

Late Aptian to Early Campanian in age (Cunha, 1992; Cunha &amp;amp; Reis, 1995), which 

comprises a succession of (1) alluvial coarse siliciclastic sediments and interbededed 

lutites drained westwards from the Hercynian Massif of Iberia, (2) open and rimmed 

platform carbonates, (3) marine to alluvial micaceous sandstones (best represented 

in the northeast areas of the onshore, and (4) alluvial sandstones and conglomerates 

(Callapez, 2004). Within this general sequence, the carbonate platform facies are 

middle Albian-early Turonian in age and are in turn articulated in two megasequences 

delimited by clear unconformities (Callapez, 1998; Dinis et al., 2008; Rey et al., 2006). 

The first megasequence records Albian to Upper Cenomanian marginal marine 

facies and includes only a limited representation of Albian carbonate sedimentation, 

basically limited to the Lisbon/Sintra region. The second megasequence is Turonian 

and has its depocentre in the Northern sector. 

The middle Albian-middle Cenomanian carbonate succession of the first 

megasequence was first studied in the southern region by Choffat, in 1885, who 

proposed the following units, defined by the marine fossils content, from base to the 

top: 1) the Knemiceras uhligi level; 2) the Polyconites subverneuilli recifal level; 3) the 

Exogyra pseudafricana [Ilymatogyra] level; 4) the Pterocera incerta [Harpagodes] level. These 

marl and limestone units, around 400 m thick, are overlain by a bed with the ammonite 

Neolobites vibrayeanus and a further level with ‘rudist limestones’ (systematic update 

sensu Callapez, 2003) (Callapez, 2004, 2008), both upper Cenomanian in age. The 

designation of “Bellasian” was used by Choffat (1885, 1900) as a chronostratigraphic 

unit aggregating the four levels described beneath the bed with the ammonite 

Neolobites vibrayeanus. More detailed biostratigraphic research led to the attribution of 



Stratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal

27

an Albian age to the two lower levels (1 and 2), redefined as the Galé Formation (Rey, 

1992, 2007), and to the dating of levels 3 and 4, redefined as the Caneças Formation, 

as, respectively, lower and middle Cenomanian (Rey, Dinis, Callapez &amp;amp; Cunha, 2006). 

The thickness of the old “Bellasian” unit of Choffat is strongly reduced towards north. 

Only the middle Cenomanian level with Pterocera incerta, displaying a mixed facies 

of sandy and marly limestones and sandy marls, can be found north of Torres Vedras, 

but associated with a marked retrogradation of the carbonate facies with ostreids and 

exogirinids (Callapez, 2004, 2008). However, the lower Cenomanian bed composed 

of marly limestones with biostromes of Exogyra pseudafricana still occurs across the 

Estremadura and in the exposures of Nazaré, in the Central sector (Callapez, 2008; 

Callapez et al., 2014). 

As for the middle Cenomanian-lower Turonian interval in the first megasequence, 

the basal upper Cenomanian is marked by a transgressive surface observable in all 

sectors of the onshore and recorded by a significant increase of fully carbonate facies 

of nodular limestone and marly limestone with ammonites, nautiloids and a diverse 

benthic fauna of open shelf environments (Callapez, 2004; Barcenilla et al., 2011). 

The most expanded sequences for this interval (“Beds with Neolobites vibrayeanus” of 

Choffat, 1989, 1900), which also present the richest biostratigraphically significant 

fossil content, outcrop both in the northern sector, near Figueira da Foz (Soares, 

1980; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008), and the southern sector, in Nazaré and near Runa 

and Lisbon (Berthou, 1973, 1984a; Lauverjat, 1982). 

The type area for the upper Cenomanian carbonate succession was established by 

Choffat (1897, 1900) and followed by subsequent workers (e.g., Berthou &amp;amp; Lauverjat, 

1974; Soares, 1980) at the site of Salmanha, near Figueira da Foz (Costa d’Arnes 

Formation), due to the best individualization of ammonite rich stratigraphic levels 

easily correlated with sections from other areas of the carbonate platform. The original 

succession of Salmanha comprises 14 levels ordered from “B” to “O”, which can be 

individualized by their lithofacies, fossil content, including ammonites, inoceramids 

and foraminifera, and are most often bounded by discontinuities (Choffat, 1897, 1898, 

1900; Berthou &amp;amp; Lauverjat, 1974; Soares, 1980; Rocha, Manuppella, Mouterde, Ruget, 

&amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1981; Lauverjat, 1982; Berthou, 1984a, Berthou, 1973, 1984a, 1984b, 

1984c, 1984d; Berthou et al., 1985; Callapez, 1998, 2001, 2004; Callapez &amp;amp; Soares, 

2001; Barcenilla et al., 2011). According to the cumulated biostratigraphic evidence 

(e.g., levels C to J are late Cenomanian in age, with “C” and “D” corresponding to 

the basal upper Cenomanian, and the first lower Turonian deposits (level “K”) laying 

on top of “J” (Callapez, 1998).

The lower part of the upper Cenomanian, displaying as a set of nodular and 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

28

marly limestones, occurs accross the whole basin, corresponding to the beds with 

the Tethyan ammonite Neolobites vibrayeanus (Berthou, 1984a) which, together with 

an overlying thick succession of “rudists limestone”, constitute the Bica Formation 

(Rey et al., 2006). 

In the upper part of the upper Cenomanian record three geographic ranges 

with distinct associations of facies can be reccognised: (1) Rimmed shelf limestones 

with rudists and coral buildups south of Leiria (towards Lisbon); (2) Open shelf 

marly limestones with ammonites north of Leiria (towards Figueira da Foz and 

Coimbra); and (3) inner shelf and lagoonal marls with echinoids and ostreids East 

of Leiria (around Ourém) (Choffat, 1900; Berthou et al., 1980; Berthou, 1984a). The 

correspondences between these distinct ranges, particularly the two main ammonite 

and rudists associations of facies, have been the subject of a number of stratigraphic 

and palaeontological studies (e.g., Choffat 1898, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Berthou &amp;amp; 

Lauverjat, 1979; Crosaz-Galletti, 1979; Moron, 1981; Lauverjat 1982; Callapez, 1998; 

Barcenilla et al., 2011) and are now better understood (Berthou, 1984a), allowing for 

an overall stratigraphic framework (see Fig. 2 A and B).

Figure 4 - A. General stratigraphy of of the carbonate succession in the northern sector, from Figueira da 
Foz inward, with standard ammonites biozones (after Hart el al., 2005, modified after Callapez, 1998). B. 
General stratigraphy of the Cenomanian-Turonian from the onshore sectors of the West Portuguese Margin 
eastwards of Nazaré (after Callapez, 2008).

This first Albian-upper Cenomanian megasequence presents a regressive facies 

at its top boundary (unit ”J”), followed by a hiatus and a karstified surface (Baixo 

Mondego and Nazaré) marking the Cenomanian-Turonian transition unconformity 

(e.g., Callapez, 2004; Dinis et al., 2008): This discontinuity is related to the overall 

uplift of the continental margin, resulting in the emersion and subaerial exposure of 

the onshore sections of the carbonate platform (Callapez, 2008).

The second megasequence, which is entirely Turonian in age, is recorde by units 

“K” to “O” of Choffat (1897, 1900), with a maximal thickness of 18 m in the type 

area (Salmanha, Figueira da Foz). With the exception of a narrow set of exposures 

along the southest southeast block of the Cós-Leiria-Pombal fault (central sector), 

it is restricted to the northern sector. The “K” and “L” levels correspond to the basal 

lower Turonian, starting with dolomitic marls which evolve to platy marly limestones 

including abundant concentrations of reoriented turritelids (Callapez, 2004). 

Ammonite associations mainly occur in level “L”, dominated by vascoceratids of the 

middle lower Turonian Tethyan biozone of Thomasites rollandi (Chancellor, Kennedy, 

&amp;amp; Hancock, 1994). This correlation concurs with the additional common occurrence

30

of inoceramids Mytiloides spp. among the fossil fauna (Callapez, 1998, 2003, 2004). The 

correlative depositional sequence in the central sector (southeast block of the Cós-

Leiria-Pombal) consists in 2-3 m thick marls with rudist (Radiolites peroni) biostromes.

The upper part of the lower Turonian is represented by units “M”, “N” and 

“O”, consisting of a succession with cross-bedded inner shelf grainstones with 

coral and rudist debris and an increasing upwards content in micaceous sandstones 

(Soares, 1980; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008; Hart et al., 2005.) This late 

sequence shows no record of ammonites, but the occurence of Actaeonella caucasica 

grossouvrei suggests a late early Turonian age (Callapez, 1993). Also, Berthou (1984b) 

inferred a possible correlation with the standard zone of Mammites nodosoides based 

in palynological data provided by micaceous sandstones sampled at the region of 

Coimbra. This sequence presents a strong regressive character, documenting a 

transition to littoral plain and alluvial micaceous standstones (Furadouro Formation), 

culminating with a withdrawal of the sea from the onshore sectors of the Western 

Portuguese margin (Callapez, 2008). The correlative sediments in the Central sector 

(recorded at the top of the exposures of Nazaré) correspond to coarse sands with 

abraded fragments of radiolitids and actaeonellids, consistent with a shallow littoral 

domain with prograding alluvial sandy bars (Callapez, 2004, 2008).

3.3. LOCAL STRATIGRAPHIC SETTING: THE “SÍTIO DA NAZARÉ 

FORMATION”

As mentioned before, tectonic activity associated with late Hercynian structural faults 

of diverse orientation led to the differentiation of several palaeogeographical regions 

in the carbonate platform (Callapez, 1998). The predominant NE-SW Cós-Leiria-

Pombal flexure and fault system (“Nazaré fault”) (Dinis, Lopes, Rodrigues, &amp;amp; Cunha, 

2012; Kullberg, 2000; Kullberg, Rocha, Soares, Duarte, &amp;amp; Marques, 2014) played a 

major role in the distinction between a northern, a central, and a southern region, but 

other sets of faults with NNW–SSE to NW-SE and with submeridian to meridian 

(N-S to NNE-SSW) orientations additionally contributed to the differentiation of 

structural domains within each region (Callapez, op. cit). In the northern sector, the 

Cenomanian-Turonian outcrops of the Baixo-Mondego Region are thus commonly 

divided in different structural and palaeogeographical domains, displaying marked 

lateral facies variation (Choffat, 1900; Soares, 1966, 1968, 1980): Figueira da Foz, 

Montemor-o-Velho, Tentúgal and East of Ribeira de Ançã (Callapez, 1992, 1998). 



Stratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal

31

In the Central sector, four structural domains have also been distinguished in the 

outcrops exposed over the southeast region of the Cós-Leiria-Pombal: (1) Nazaré; 

(2) Alpedriz syncline, (3) Pousos syncline and (4) Ourém (Choffat, 1900; Berthou,

1973; Crosaz, 1975, 1976; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2004). The stratigraphic

succession analyzed in this study is included in the Nazaré sector, which constitutes

the most western (external) domain of the Nazaré-Leiria-Ourém region, bordered at

east by the northern end of the diapiric anticline of Caldas da Rainha, and presenting

the most complete upper Cretaceous carbonate series in the central sector.

The single Cenomanian-Turonian outcrop found in the Nazaré sector corresponds 

to the large promontory which dominates the fishing village of Nazaré, located south, 

in the foothill (see Fig. 5A and B), with cliffs and slopes cutting Cenomanian massive 

limestones (e.g., Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Lauverjat, 1982; Hart et al., 2005; 

Callapez, 2004; Callapez et al., 2014) (see Fig. 5C). As stated in section 2.1 (historical 

overview of research), both the stratigraphy and the fossil content of this outcrop have 

been the subject of much prior research since the pionnering works of Choffat (1886, 

1900, 1901-02) and Saporta (1894, including an appendix with the first description 

of the stratigraphic section by Choffat), benefiting from cumulative contributions 

of further sedimentological, palynological, palaeoecological and micro- and macro-

faunal analyses (e.g., Antunes, 1979; Barroso-Barcenilla et al., 2011; Berthou, 1973, 

1984a; Berthou et al., 1985; Reis, Corrochano, &amp;amp; Armentero, 1997; Callapez, 1998, 

2001, 2004; Callapez &amp;amp; Soares, 2001; Callapez et al., 2014; Lauverjat, 1982). An overall 

description of the stratigraphic setting of Nazaré is provided in the following.

The sedimentary succession from the base of the promontory upwards displays 

the following main sequences (description closely following Callapez, 1998; Callapez, 

2004; Callapez et al., 2014): 

1) Albian to lower Cenomanian marine sandstones and lutites with plant remains

(ca. 30 meters of exposure, recording the upper part of the Figueira da Foz Fm.); 

2) Upper lower Cenomanian littoral plain mixed facies with Ilymatogyra pseudafricana

and Ceratostreon flabellatum biostromes, changing laterally to inner shelf

carbonates rich in benthic invertebrates and occasional turtle remains (level 

with Exogyra pseudoafricana from Choffat’s “Bellasian”; 1 to 8 meters thick); 

3) Middle Cenomanian laminated marls and mudstones interbedded with

oyster pavements and biostromes of Gyrostrea ouremensis, overlain at the top

by massive dolomitic beds with fish remains; this unit, which also contains

vertebrates remains and ichtyological fauna, crocodile and chelonians, is 39

meters thick and corresponds to unit “B” of Choffat, signaling a shift from

an open inner platform environment to a lagoonal environment;

34

4) Basal upper Cenomanian layers, composed of nodular limestones and marly 

limestones with Neolobites vibrayeanus and a fully marine benthic palaeofauna 

(11 meters thick), corresponding to unit “C” of Choffat (“Beds with 

Neolobites vibrayeanus”). This succession and the associated transgressive 

surface are easily identified in the whole carbonate platform, allowing and 

accurate stratigraphic correlation; 

5) Upper Cenomanian massive beds of withish calcarenitic limestone with a 

rich invertebrate fauna of bivalves, gastropods and echinoids (circa 4 m), 

corresponding to unit “D” of Choffat (“Bed with Anorthopygus michelini”). 

6) On the top the previous beds a narrow layer (few centimeters thick) of pinkish 

to beige yellowish nodular limestone including abundant Tylostoma ovatum, 

Helicaulax sp. and Drepanocheilus sp. can be observed, as a record of unit “E” 

(Callapez, 1998). 

Units “D” and “E” constitute the easternmost part of the upper edge of 

the promontory on the south side, forming a cornice below the Sítio da 

Nazaré. More westward, still on the south side, Choffat’s levels “F”, “G” and 

“H” are represented by a succession of outer reef limestones with Caprinula 

debris, one of the most typical groups of rudists from the upper Cenomanian 

Tethyan faunas (circa 21 m); 

7) The highest upper Cenomanian record, corresponding to levels “I”/”J“ (more 

easily observable on the western cliff), is composed of laminated limestones 

and heavily bioturbated marls, probably correlative of the Bonarelli event 

and affected by the early development of a well exposed intra-Cretaceous 

endokarst (Callapez et al., 2014; Corrochano, Reis, &amp;amp; Armentero, 1998; Reis 

et al., 1997).

The units from the top part of the Cenomanian-Turonian succession are exposed 

on the western side of the promontory (light-house outcrop and north-beach), where 

their strata slightly dip northwards. Lower Turonian sequences are well documented 

on the northern corner of the cliffs, resting unconformably on upper Cenomanian 

limestones (unit “J”, which in this realm corresponds to a 7 m sequence of marls and 

limestones) (Callapez 2004). Basal lower Turonian (units K/L) is represented by white 

and pink limestone interbedded with layers of micaceous sandy limestone (5-6 m), 

containing abraded fragments of Radiolites peroni, Apricardia sp., scleractinian corals, 

and Actaeonella caucasica grossouvrei (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014). 

An erosional surface associated with an abrupt change in facies signals the 
boundary between the “K”/”L” and “M”/”O” sequences. Over the micaceous 



Stratigraphical framework: the Cenomanian-Turonian platform carbonates of West Portugal

35

limestones, 4,5 metres of yellow coarse sandstones with debris of Acataeonella caucasica 

grossouvrei and Radiolites peroni correspond to Choffat’s unit “M”, of middle lower 

Turonian age. 

Finally, overlaying unconformably the Cenomanian-Turonian series, a layer 

of Coniacian–Santonian alluvial sandstones (circa 6 m), followed by a succession 

of Campanian-Maastichtian alluvial red mudstones interbedded with calciclastic 

conglomerates and red lutites with land gastropods (Antunes, 1979), closes at the top 

the Late Cretaceous exposures of Nazaré (Callapez, 2004; Callapez et al., 2014).

A stratigraphic profile of the Nazaré carbonate succession, ranging from Lower to 

basal Upper Cenomanian is illustrated above (Fig. 6, taken from Callapez et al., 2014). 

In addition to sedimentary data, the fossil content, characterized by its abundance 

and diversity, is indicated. The significant LEP (Level with Exogyra pseudoafricana)/B 

and B/C stratigraphic discontinuities, respectively at the boundaries between the 

lower and middle Cenomanian and the middle and upper Cenomanian, are signaled 

in between levels 18-19 and 114-115. This profile is part of a more extended one 

covering the entire Cenomanian-Turonian succession (until levels M/N/O) set up 

in Callapez (1998), starting at the base of the formation 400 meters west of the 

Northern end of the Nazaré’s beach (U.T.M. NE 93450 83990).

3.4. SURVEYED STRATIGRAPHIC PROFILE

The succession considered for study in this work starts at the base of the carbonate 

exposures on the south cliffs of Nazaré, in between the Sítio and the Rock of Guilhim 

(39°36’15.11”N and 9°4’55.26”W) (see Fig. 7). It extends upwards for 13,5 meters, 

covering an exposure of inner shelf and lagoonal marls and limestones of late early 

to middle Cenomanian age, with a view to examining its fossil content in dinocysts 

and other palynomorphs.

The selected stratigraphic profile is presented in Fig. 8, distinguishing 49 levels. 

The Lower-Middle Cenomanian boundary is signaled by the LEP/B discontinuity 

(12-13). Around 5,5 m of the profile lie below the LEP/B discontinuity, and the 

remaining 8 m above it, but without reaching the B1/B2 discontinuity, which delimits 

the early and latter middle Cenomanian (interval correlative to the standard ammonite 

zones of Rhotomagense and Jukes-brownwei, respectively) and occurs just below level 44 

in the Callapez (1998) profile. This late early and early middle Cenomanian interval 

is coeval with the beginning of one of the most significant sea level rises in the 

Cretaceous Period (Callapez et al., 2014; Gale et al., 2002; Haq, Hardenbol &amp;amp; Vail, 

1988) and has been interpreted as relating to a palaeoenvironmental evolution from 

an open inner shelf close to an intertidal flat in the lower Cenomanian to a more 

constrained lagoonal environment in the middle Cenomanian.

The section contains a succession of alternating limestones and marls with 

biostromes of Ilymatogyra pseudoafricana, followed by laminitic marly levels with 

Gyrostrea ouremensis. Upwards in the series the content in sands (sandy limestones) 

markedly decreases. From a litostratighraphic point of view, the layers represented in 

the profile are partly equivalent to the Costa de Arnes Formation described by Rocha 

et al. (1981) for the Figueira da Foz and Baixo Mondego regions, thus representing 

the sector of the Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate located northward the Nazaré-

Leiria-Pombal structural axis (Callapez, 1998; Dinis et al., 2008).

4.1. IMPORTANCE OF THE DINOFLAGELLATES

Dinoflagellates are unicellular microscopic organisms which, together with diatoms 

and coccolithophores, constitute an important part of the phytoplankton, closely 

following diatoms as primary marine producers (Hoppenrath &amp;amp; Saldarriaga, 

2012). Since about half of dinoflagellates species are actually heterotrophic and 

not photosynthetic, they are also important members of the zooplankton, strongly 

contributing to their taxonomic diversity and biomass (Gaines &amp;amp; Elbrächter, 1987). 

They can be found in virtually all sorts of aquatic environments, ranging from 

marine (the predominant case), to brackish and freshwater ecosystems to sea ice 

(Taylor, Hopenrath, &amp;amp; Sladarriaga, 2008). Besides the planktonic forms, there are also 

benthonic species. At particular stages of their life cycle Dinoflagellates may produce 

cysts with high potential to a successful fossilization, affording thereby important 

biostratigraphical and palaeoecological information (Sousa, Ribas-Carballo, &amp;amp; Pais, 

1999). 

Consistent fossil records of dinoflagellates have been established from Middle 

Triassic onwards (Fensome, Saldarriaga, &amp;amp; Taylor, 1999). Despite some evidence for 

the presence of the dinoflagellates lineage before the Mesozoic, the morphology of 

dinoflagellates as we know it today seems to have arisen from an evolutionary event 

occurred in the Early Mesozoic, thus making difficult to interpret fossils preceding 

that period as dinoflagellates (Fensome et al., 1999). Around three quarters of the 

genders and half of the species that have been described thus far are fossils (Taylor et al.,

AND MORPHOLOGY

2008). Given the importance of dinoflagellate morphology for its identification and 

classification, and its close connection to the dinoflagellate biology and life cycle, we 

provide in this chapter a brief biological characterization of this important taxonomic 

group. The characterization offered is largely based on Evitt, Lentin, Millioud, Stover, 

and Williams (1977), Fensome et al. (1999), Medlin and Fensome (2013), and Sousa 

et al. (1999). The database DINOFLAJ2 (Fensome, MacRae, &amp;amp; Williams, 2008), in 

particular the Glossary section, based on Fensome, Taylor, Norris, Sarjeant, Wharton, 

and Williams (1993), was also used as a regular source for short definitions.

4.2. DEFINING FEATURES

4.2.1. Flagella

The defining trait of dinoflagellates is the presence, at some stage of their life cycle, of 

two dissimilar flagella typically emerging out of a flagellar pore in the conventionally 

termed ventral surface of the cell (see Fig. 9). These flagella allow for position stability 

and motility in the aquatic environment. A ribbon-like transverse flagellum lying in 

the cingulum, an equatorial furrow all around the cell, provides simultaneous forward 

and rotating propulsion through undulation from base to tip at the outer edge. A 

more conventional longitudinal flagellum, projecting outwards from a medium 

groove termed sulcus, beats posteriorly and allows for translational motion (Gaines &amp;amp; 

Taylor, 1985). 

The type of flagella insertion just described is predominant and known as 

dinokont flagellation. A number of dinoflagellate genus, such as the Prorocentrum, 

present what has been termed desmokont flagellation: flagella are still similarly 

differentiated, but they do not lie in grooves and are anterior relative to motion 

(Fensome et al., 1999; Hoppenrath &amp;amp; Saldarriaga, 2012). In both cases, flagella and/or 

their associated structures provide a natural orientation to the cells. 



Dinoflagellates Biology and Morphology

41

Figure 9 - Morphology of a typical motile cell, illustrating the two dissimilar flagella and the axes defining 
the cell natural orientation: apex-antapex and ventral and dorsal surfaces (adapted from Fensome, Riding, 
and Taylor, 1996).

The cingulum (transverse groove) divides the cell in an upper and a lower part, 

generally designated as episome and hyposome, respectively. The highest point of the 

episome is called the apex, and lies at the front of the movement when the cell is 

swimming. The bottom of the hyposome is called the antapex. The upper and lower 

parts of the motile cell are for that reason also designated, respectively, as apical or 

anterior and antapical or posterior. The sulcus (longitudinal groove) conventionally 

defines a ventral surface of the cell, and thus also an opposite dorsal surface. For each 

surface, ventral and dorsal, right and left lateral sides can then be distinguished using 

the sulcus as a middle reference. Understanding of the cell orientation is essential both 

in describing a particular dinoflagellates species and in meaningfully interpreting 

descriptions made available in the literature.

4.2.2. Dinokaryon

A second typical feature of most, though not all, dinoflagellates is the possession of 

a nuclear state known as dinokaryon (Fensome et al., 1999). While both molecular 

phylogenetic and ultrastructural information establish dinoflagellates as eukariots, 

typically included in the Protist reign (division Dinoflagellata), dinokaryons (which 

determine the subdvision Dinokaryota) depart from conventional eukaryote nuclei 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

42

in several regards. They lack histones and nucleosomes, presenting a much lower ratio 

of proteins to DNA than other eukaryotes (Rizzo, 1991). Rather than decondensing 

during the interphase, chromosomes remain visible all along the mitotic cycle 

(Spector, Vasconcelos, &amp;amp; Triemer, 1981). Mitosis is also atypical, being dubbed as 

dinomitosis: the nucleus membrane is not ruptured during mitosis, which is thus 

“closed”, and the mitotic spindle is extranuclear, not linked to the centrioles (Dodge 

&amp;amp; Greuet, 1987). Dinoflagellates without a dinokaryon are classified as Syndiniales 

(subdivision Syndinia).

4.2.3. Other dinoflagellate ultrastructures

As other eukaryotes, dinoflagellate cells contain in their cytoplasm different types 

of organelles, including mitochondria, vacuoles and pusules (a special kind of 

vacuoles opening up at the cellular bases), Golgi complex, pyrenoids and plastids 

(in photosynthetic and mixotrophic species, which are the vast majority: Schnepf 

&amp;amp; Elbrächter, 1992), besides microbodies and storage products. The most common 

sort of plastides are peridin plastides, and photosynthetic pigments include peridin, 

chlorophylls a and c
2
, b-carotene and small quantities of diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin 

(Jeffrey, Sielicki, &amp;amp; Haxo, 1975; Sousa et al., 1999). Heterotrophic dinoflagellates do 

not present chloroplasts and may exhibit a variety of feeding stuctures, dependent 

on the particular form of feeding (e.g., direct phagocytosis, myzocytosis, or pallium 

feeding), such as cytostomes, peduncules or pallia (Jacobson and Anderson, 1992; 

Hackett, Anderson, Erdner, &amp;amp; Bhattacharya, 2004).

Especially important for the issue of dinoflagellates classification is the organization 

of the outer region of dinoflagellate cells, designated as cortex (Netzel &amp;amp; Dürr, 1984) 

or amphiesma (Morril &amp;amp; Loeblich III, 1983). The amphiesma is a complex structure 

composed of several membranes: underneath the plasmalemma, a membrane that 

coats the entire motile dinoflagellate cell, it typically includes a single layer of flat 

vesicles called alveolae or amphiesmal vesicles, which play a structural role. In many 

cases, these vesicles comprise tightly fit cellulosic plates (one per vesicle), which 

provide an external armor to the cell, known as theca. In other cases, the vesicles are 

either empty or filled with amorphous material. Dinoflagellates with thecal plates are 

thus known as armoured or techate and those without cellulosic plates as athecate. 

Cell protection is ensured in athecate dinoflagellates by a flexible protein coating, 

and some species may present an internal calcareous (or less often siliceous) skeleton 

(Morril &amp;amp; Loeblich III, 1983; Sousa et al., 1999). 



Dinoflagellates Biology and Morphology

43

Figure 10 - External morphology of an athecate and thecate motile cells: variations in the designation of 
anterior and posterior regions of the cell according to its thechate or athecate character are illustrated (after 
Hoppenrath, 2008, in Hoppenrath and Saldarriaga, 2012; changed to gray scale).

In some species a thin fibrous membrane, designated as dino-pellicle, chiefly 

made of cellulose and combined in varying degree with dinosporin, occurs under 

the alveolae. This pellicle can be the main strenghtening layer of the amphiesma in 

some athecate dinoflagellates, which are then referred to as pelliculate dinoflagelates 

(Morril &amp;amp; Loeblich III, 1983). When present in thecate varieties, the pellicle lies 

under the theca and forms the wall of organic-walled cysts prone to fossilize. The 

more specific designations of the episome (apical part) and hyposome (antapical part) 

of the motile cell defined by the cingulum vary according to the naked or armoured 

character of the dinoflagellate (see Fig. 10).

The episome can be termed epicone or epitract in atechate cells and epitheca in 

techate ones (or yet epicyst in dinocysts). The hyposome may be called hypoconone 

or hypotract in atechate varieties an hypotheca in techate ones (or yet hypocyst in 

dinocysts). Atechate cells may present a groove at the apex, known as acrobase, and 

techate cells a pore at the top of the apical horn (apical pore). 

The thecal plates form closely imbricated patterns, with sutures at their 

boundaries. These sutures grant flexibility and make possible for the cell to grow by 

adding wall material at the margins of the thecal plates. The arrangements of alveoles 

and thecal plates, known as tabulation, remain to this day the most information-

rich morphological dataset for the classification (taxonomy) of dinoflagellates motile 

stages Tabulation has long been shown to be highly conservative in each species 

(Fensome et al., 1999).

4.3. TABULATION IN DINOFLAGELLATES

Six main systems of tabulation have been distinguished in dinoflagellates (Fensome 

et al., 1993), respectively: Gymnodinoid, Suessioid, Gonyaulacoid-Peridinioid, 

Nannoceratopsioid, Dynophisioid and Prorocentroid. A brief characterization is 

given in the following of each of these systems (see Fig. 11):

Gymnodinoid tabulation: amphiesmal vesicles are numerous, often hexagonally-

shaped, typically without theca plates, and either randomly organized or arranged in 

more than ten latitudinal series. 

Suessioid tabulation: vesicles typically include delicate thecal plates (polygonal and 

of similar size) and are organized in an array of five to ten latitudinal series, with most 

often a not clearly differentiated cingulum.

Figure 11 - Schematic illustration of tabulation types (after Fensome et al., 1999, modified from Fensome 
et al., 1993).

Gonyaulacoid-Peridinioid tabulation: amphiesmal vesicles contain true thecal 

plates and are arranged in five or six primary latitudinal series and one longitudinal 

series, with a marked cingulum. Considered from the apex to the antapex poles, 

the techal plates are classified as apicals (those contacting the apical pore complex), 

precingulars (immediately preceding the cingulum), cingulars (located on the 



Dinoflagellates Biology and Morphology

45

cingulum), postcingulars (immediately following the cingulum) and antapicals (lying 

on the antapex), with those lying in between these series termed intermediaries and 

those located within the sulcus as sulcals. As a difference between gonyaulocoid and 

peridionoid tabulations, the former is associated with a symmetrical first apical plate 

and the occurrence of two antapical plates, while the latter involves an asymmetrical 

first apical plate and two to four fundital plates (posterior to the first postcingular 

series and external to the sulcus).

Dinophysioid tabulation: the vesicles are arranged in four latitudinal series, with a 

clear cingulum and a saggital sulcus that splits the theca in two well-defined right and 

left halves. A simple apical pore occurs on the ventral surface of the epitheca. 

Nannoceratopsioid tabulation: corresponds to a hybrid of the two preceding 

tabulations, combining a hyposoma which is dinophyisioid and an episoma which is 

gonyaulacoid-peridinioid. 

Prorocentroid: the teca comprises two large plates, named valves, separated by 

a saggital suture, without distinguishable cingulum or sulcus. Flagella are apically 

inserted (desmokont flagellation) on one of two apical pores, surrounded by small 

plates lying mainly on an excavation of the right valve.

These tabulation systems are of critical importance not just to the taxonomy of 

living dinoflagellates as to the taxonomy of fossil species, to the extent that the surface 

of fossil cysts reflects the cortical organization of the motile cell. As this happens to 

a varying degree, and cyst-specific structures without a thecal equivalent (coined 

as cystomorphic structures by Gocht, 1983) can also occur, tabulation applied to 

fossils has been more specifically referred to as paratabulation. However, in its broad 

sense, the term tabulation conveniently encompasses the taxonomy of both living 

and fossile material (Fensome et al., 1999). This issue will be more directly dealt with 

in the section devoted to the morphology of dynocysts.

4.4. DINOFLAGELLATES LIFECYCLE

With few exceptions, dinoflagellates present haplobiontic lifecycles (Fensome, Taylor, 

Norris, Sarjeant, Wharton, &amp;amp; Williams, 1993). Population growth is mostly obtained 

trough asexual reproduction via binary division of biflagellate haploid motile cells 

(vegetative stage). Although it has only been observed on a small percentage of 

species (around 1%), sexual reproduction also occurs under given environmental 

conditions, calling for an increase in genetic variability. Gametes (either isogametes 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

46

or anisogametes) are then formed, similar to the regular haploid motile cells, which 

fuse to produce a diploid zygote motile cell, known as planozygote. Depending 

again on the environment, the planozygote can directly undergo meiosis, restoring 

the vegetative haploid stage of the life cycle, or can shift first into a dormant stage, 

the hypnozygote, before meiosis takes place after a variable period, controlled by 

surrounding conditions which trigger excystment (see Fig. 12). 

Figure 12 - Dinoflagellates life cycle (after Figueiroa &amp;amp; Garcés, 2010, modified from Walker, 1984; changed 
to gray scaled).

This hypnozygote, also known as a resting cyst or dynocyst, is non-motile (it has 

no flagella) and is environmentally resistant through the building of a continuous 

thick wall below the theca. It naturally sinks into the sediments, behaving like a 

sedimentary particle. Another type of cysts, variedly known as pellicle, temporary, or 

ecdysal cysts, presents instead a thin wall which lasts only for a short period, and, just 

as the wall of vegetative (metabolic active) cysts, are easily destroyed by bacteria after 

death of the organism. By contrast, resistance cysts present organic walls typically 

made of dinosporine, a highly resistant material akin to sporopollenin, or sometimes 

inorganic, calcareous or (more rarely) siliceous walls, which all enable fossilization 

after the organism’s death. Most fossil dinoflagellates are thus believed to correspond 

to fossilized resistance dinocysts.

It has been estimated that only 15-20 % of living dinoflaglellates produce cysts 

which are prone to fossilization. As noted in Fensome et al. (1999), this may appear 



Dinoflagellates Biology and Morphology

47

at first sight to strongly limit the usefulness of microfossil records for highlighting 

dinoflagellate evolution. However, only a few number of dinoflagellate lineages 

are actually represented in the fossil record, mainly of the Gonyaulacoid-Perinioid 

system, so that the representation for these particular lineages is quite above the 15-

20% overall threshold (Fensome et al., 1999, p. 69). Critical to the biostratigraphic 

importance of fossil dinocysts is the way they reflect or not the external shape, 

particularly the tabulation, of the living motile cell. This depends on how the cyst 

wall is formed and opens way to the morphological classification of cysts. 

4.5. DINOCYSTS MORPHOLOGY

A resistant cyst may be formed either through building a continuous wall immediately 

within the theca (thus with a similar shape to the theca) or only after the contraction 

of the cell into a spherical body with projections (processes or crests), in which case 

the shape of the wall may significantly depart from the shape of the mother cell. 

Cysts of the former type are known as proximate and typically present no external 

projections. Cysts of the latter type are termed chorate or proximochorate, depending 

on the ratio of the length of the external projections to the shorter diameter of the 

central body (Sargeant, 1982). The length of these projections is in between ten and 

thirty percent of the central body diameter in proxichomorate and in excess of thirty 

percent in chorate cysts. 

Among the chief morphological features of the cysts are the cyst wall, which 

can present different degrees of complexity, the surface ornamentation (relief or 

projections), the archeopyle (corresponding to the excystment aperture), and the 

tabulation or paratabulation system.

4.5.1. Cyst wall

Dinocysts may have a single-layered wall enclosing a single cavity, in which case 

they are called autocysts, the wall being then termed autophragm and the enclosed 

cavity the autocoel. These dinocysts are also referred to as acavate and are often, 

though not exclusively, of the proximate type, reflecting the overall shape of the 

mother cell. Morphologically more complex dinocysts may in turn present a wall 

with several layers and enclosed cavities. When there are two layers, the inner one is 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

48

called endophragm and the outer one periphragm, with the innermost cavity named 

the endocoel and the cavity encircled by the two layers named the pericoel. When 

three layers occur, the one external to the periphragm is termed the ectophragm 

(typically structurally linked to the underlying layer via processes or other supporting 

formations) and the cavity between it and the periphragm is known as the ectocoel. 

Another kind of three-layered wall sometimes occurs, as in some peridinioid fossils, 

exhibiting an independent thin layer lying in between the periphragm and the 

endophragm. This layer, which is not structurally supported by any other, is known 

as the mesophragm and encircles a cavity termed the mesocoel. All cysts with 

multiple layers and cavities are known as cavate (Evitt et al., 1977; De vertuil &amp;amp; 

Norris, 1966; Sousa et al., 1999). Different types of cavate cysts can be distinguished, 

which constitute important morhological information (morphotypes) for species 

identification and dinocysts taxonomy. These include the holocavate, circumcavate, 

bicavate, cornucavate, suturocavate and camocavate forms, which differ concerning 

the form and distribution of the cavities in the cyst (Evitt, 1985). Procedures have 

been outlined for identifying the wall layers, largely based on the presence of regular 

processes and septa (Evitt et al., 1977) which will be briefly addressed in the following 

subsection. 

4.5.2. Surface relief

The surface of dinocysts may be smooth or exhibit some relief, such as the patterns 

of parasutural lines (Evitt et al., 1977) reflecting the arrangement of theca plates 

(thecamorphic structures), or cystomorphic structures such as processes (columnar 

formations arising from a specific point on an external structure), spines (acuminate 

processes) and septa (delicate linear projections which form circles or crests on the 

wall). These relief structures are highly variable in shape and distribution over the 

cyst (e.g., from random to parasutural to intratabular) (see Evitt et al., 1977; Evitt, 

1985; Zonneveld &amp;amp; Pospelova, 2015). In many cysts, the relief patterns, namely the 

processes and septa, reflect in total or in part the tabulation system of the original 

cell, which turns them into a core morphological element for the dinoflagellate-

cyst association (Fensome et al., 1993). They are commonly highly regular structures, 

virtually constant across individuals in a given species. However, they may sometimes 

happen to be irregular, varying from specimen to specimen within a species, in 

which case they become mere incidental features. Besides their value for species 

identification, they may also, less contentiously than overall cyst shape, be the carriers 



Dinoflagellates Biology and Morphology

49

of important palaeoenvironmental information. For instance, a relation between 

shorter processes and growth in lower salinity environments has been consistently 

documented (Dale, 1996).

4.5.3. Archeopyle

The archeopyle is an important morphological feature of dinocysts. It corresponds 

to the opening through which excystment takes place (Evitt et al., 1977; Fensome et 

al., 1993). Commonly, it is outlined by an archeopyle suture, visible at the microscope 

and believed to be formed at the time the cyst wall develops, but it may also result 

from the detachment of plates not delineated by a preexisting suture. The archeopyle 

suture typically runs along the boundaries of one or more paraplates (parasutures), 

defining this way a section of the cyst paratabulation. The opening left by the rupture 

of the wall along the archeopyle suture (or by plate detachment without a pre-

determined suture) is termed the archeopyle operculum. Opercula comprising one 

single paraplate are termed monoplacoid and those comprising several paraplates 

polyplacoid. When the operculum is completely encircled by the archeopyle suture, 

being thus entirely detachable from the cyst wall, it is said to be free (even if it may 

by accident be adherent to the wall at a point where the suture happened not to 

open). When the suture does not fully surround the operculum, which thus remains 

partly attached to the cyst, the operculum is known as adnate. Just as its shape and 

size, location of the archeopyle on the cyst may be highly variable, ranging from 

apical to intercalary and precingular, and even to postcingular and antapical, as is the 

case with siliceous cysts of Peridinites. Polyplacoid opercula may include paraplates 

belonging to one single series of paraplates, in which case they are simple, or to two 

or more series, in which case they are said to be compound. A particular case of a 

compound archeopyle is known as epicystal archeopyle (after Evitt et al., 1977), who 

deem this designation preferable to the one of epitractal archeopyle), comprising 

all paraplates of the epicyst. Although the archeopyle morphology may be highly 

specific in some dinoflaggellate species, as noticed in Evitt et al., 1977, it only provides 

direct indications about a small fraction (usually restricted to very few plates) of the 

tabulation.

50

4.5.4. Paratabulation

Paratabulation is by far the most important morphological classificatory feature of 

dinocysts. It designates the ensemble of characteristics of the apparent plates on the 

cyst, including their shape, number, size and mutual relationship (Evitt et al., 1977). As 

mentioned previously, tabulation is currently used to encompass both the tabulation 

of living motile cells and of fossil cysts, the same main six tabulation systems described 

above (section “tabulation in Dinoflagellates) being also used for the classification of 

patterns of plates in dinocysts. However, the expression paratabulation signals the 

circumstance that tabulation of the cyst will typically offer an incomplete view of 

the theca tabulation, the link between the two being thus inferential to some extent. 

Notwithstanding, just as tabulation for living motile cells, paratabulation has proven 

invaluable for the taxonomy of fossil dinocysts. 

One important methodological aspect of tabulation has been the development 

of notational codes to describe it, known as tabulation formulae (or paratabulation 

formulae, when applied to paraplates). A popular tabulation formula was put 

forward by Kofoid as early as 1907/1909 and is still in use today in modified 

versions (Fensome et al., 1993). Plates in each latitudinal series (apical, precingular, 

postcingular, antapical), indexed by specific symbols, are numbered from left to right 

starting from the midventral position and parallel to the transverse flagellum. While 

the tabulation formula for a theca includes the total number of thecal plates, the 

paratabulation formula for a cyst only expresses the number of observable plates and 

their disposition. As a consequence, the two formulae will only coincide when the 

thecal morphology happens to be fully expressed in the cyst morphology (see Evitt 

et al., 1977). Tabulation and paratabulation formulae deal with only a selected portion 

of the information conveyed by the tabulation (paratabulation), as they concern the 

number and arrangement of plates with no consideration for their size, shape and 

mutual relationships. Useful as they are, they cannot thus be thought of as exhausting 

the morphological information of dinoflagellates or dinocysts tabulations.

One often useful complement to address cysts paratabulation is provided by the 

pattern of processes (see subsection “surface relief ” above), whenever they happen to 

reflect thecal morphology (e.g., when arranged along the parasutural lines, or presenting 

an intratabular distribution). Formulae for processes have also been developed, which 

may or not coincide with the paratabulation formula (Stover, 1975).



51

5.1. TAXONOMY

An acceptable classification of dinoflagellates should be able to encompass both present 

and fossil forms and moreover reflect dinoflagellates phylogeny. Fensome et al. (1993) 

developed a phylogenetic tree of dinoflagellates based on ultrastructures, particularly 

tabulation, which was subsequently supported in many aspects by molecular studies 

(Medlin &amp;amp; Fensome, 2013). While molecular phylogenetic analyses successfully 

contributed to highlight the closest evolutionary relatives of dinoflagellates (e.g, 

Apicomplexa and Ciliata), they have failed to this day in decoding the internal 

relationships among classical orders of dinoflagellates (Gómez, 2012; Hacket et al., 

2004; Taylor, 2004). Nevertheless, they have supported overall morphologically based 

classifications (Hacket et al., 2004), which thus remain at the centre of taxonomic 

efforts.

Despite progress made in the morphological characterization of dinoflagellates 

since the first attempts of a comprehensive taxonomy (Bujak &amp;amp; Williams, 1981; Taylor, 

2004), several problems remain in the classification of this group, as part of a work 

in progress, particularly at the order levels (Goméz, 2012). One long acknowledged 

difficulty arises from the fact that species in a single living genus do not necessarily 

present uniform morphocysts, or that the cysts of two distinct species may be much 

more distinct than their theca armour (Sargeant, 1974). Nomenclature issues have 

also always been around, starting with the treatment of dinoflagellates by different 

authors under either the international zoological or the botanical nomenclature

AND PALAEOECOLOGY

Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

52

codes (respectively, I.Z.C.N and I.B.C.N: Goméz, 2012). It is now widely accepted 

that the ICN, abbreviation for International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and 

plants (McNeill et al., 2012) should be used for the classification of living Dinokaryota 

and of known fossil dinoflagellates (all in the Dinokaryota Subdivision) (Williams &amp;amp; 

Fensome, 2016). 

In spite of that, evolutions of the code itself and the need to account for new 

fossil taxa and nomenclatural changes proposed in a fast growing literature have 

required the regular revision and updating of major classification systems. In the case 

of fossil dinoflagellates, the first systematic attempt at an inclusive index of genera 

and species (the Lentin and Williams Index: Lentin &amp;amp; Williams, 1973) has accordingly 

undergone numerous revisions (Lentin &amp;amp; Williams, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1985, 1989, 

1993; Williams, Lentin, &amp;amp; Fensome., 1998; Fensome &amp;amp; Williams, 2004; Williams &amp;amp; 

Fensome, 2016). Some of these revisions were given a digital form and made generally 

available online, leading to DINOFLAJ2 (Fensome, MacRae, &amp;amp; Williams, 2008), 

which superseded the earlier DINOFLAJ database (Fensome, MacRae, &amp;amp; Williams, 

1998) and incorporates the nomenclature and taxonomy of the 2004 edition of the 

Lentin and Williams Index. A major update of DINOFLAJ2 is in preparation for 

release during 2016 (DINOFLAJ3, upcoming: Fensome &amp;amp; Williams 2016). 

Besides an index of fossil dinoflagellates at the levels of genera, species and 

subspecies (after Williams &amp;amp; Fensome, 2004), DINOFLAJ2 includes a joint classification 

of fossil and living dinoflagellates from the level of divison (Dinoflagellates) down 

to genera (based on Fensome et al. 1993), where it becomes continuous with the 

index information. The general taxonomy presented below is based on Fensome 

et al. (1993) (see also Sousa et al., 1999), and reproduced with adaptations from 

DINOFLAJ2 (see Table 1).

Figure 13 - Number of known dinoflagellate fossil species per family and per time interval (Mezosoic stages 
and epochs) represented as spindle plots. The light-transparent blue rectangle corresponds to the Lower and 
Midlle Cenomanian time interval (adapted from Fensome et al., 1999).

Taxonomically, dinoflagellates constitute a division (Dinoflagellates) of the 

Kingdom Protist, comprising three subdivisions, of which one is uncertain. The 

remaining two are the Dinokaryota (dinoflagellates presenting a dinokaryon in 

at least one stage of their life-cycle) and the Syndiniae (dinoflagellates presenting 

dinokont flagellation and histones in the nucleous). While Syndiniae have a single 

class (Syndiniophyceae), Dinokaryota comprise four classes, one of them uncertain 

and, under the class Dinophyceae, five subclasses, with one uncertain (Table 1). 

All known fossil dinoflagellates belong to the Dinokaryota subdivision. The Class 

Dinophyceae encompasses the six basic tabulation/paratabulation types described 

in the preceding chapter (gymnodinoid, suessioid, gonyaulacoid-peridinioid, 

dinophysoid, nannoceratopsioid and prorocentroid: Fensome et al., 1993; Talyor, 

1987), which provide the morphological basis for the distinction of subordinated 

main orders. These tabulation systems have distinct representations among extant and 

fossil forms. 

The gonyaulacoid-peridinioid system, exemplified by a majority of fossil 

dinoflagellates (from the Jurassic onwards) is also commonly represented in motile 

dinoflagellate cells (Fensome et al., 1999). Nannoceratopsioid tabulations are exclusive

55

of the fossil record (Jurassic). Prorocentroid tabulation is only found in living forms, 

which, to the exception of two questionable Jurassic fossil genera (Nannoceratopsis 

and Ternia,), might also be said of the dinophysoid tabulation. The gymnodinioid 

and suessioid systems have a sporadic fossil representation and have both extant 

representatives. Fig. 13 relates the classification of dinoflagellates to geochronologic 

units (Mesozoic stages and epochs) by plotting the time of appearance of different 

taxonomic subclasses and orders and the number of species per family obtained in 

the fossil record. The time interval delimited by the two horizontal dashed lines in 

the Cretaceous corresponds to the lower and upper boundaries of the Cenomanian 

Stage, which is the stratigraphic interval focused in the present work.

A more detailed account, at the level of relevant genera and species, of the 

relation between fossil dinoflagellates taxonomy and main stratigraphic intervals, will 

be given in the section devoted to dinocyst biostratigraphy.

5.2. DINOCYST BIOSTRATIGRAPHY

5.2.1. Relation to main geochronological units

Despite biogeochemical evidence for a pre-Mesozoic occurrence of dinoglagellates, 

with ancestors possibly dating back to the Cambrian period (Moldowan &amp;amp; Talyzina, 

1998), the earliest confirmed dinocysts were found in Middle-Late Triassic sediments, 

240-200 Ma (Macrae, Fensome, &amp;amp; Williams, 1996; Medlin &amp;amp; Fensome, 2013). From 

then on, cyst-forming dinoflagellates are abundantly documented in the fossil record 

of marine Mesozoic-Cenozoic sediments, exhibiting noticeable species diversity 

(circa 2500 species: Taylor et al., 2008). The pattern of diversity shows a rapid increase 

from Late Triassic to a maximum in the Cretaceous (local peaks in the Albian and 

the Maastrichian), and a consistent decline all along the Cenozoic, starting in the 

Early Paleocene and with the single exception of a local increase in the Early Eocene 

(MacRae et al., 1996: see Fig. 14).

Figure 14 - Fossil dinoflagellate diversity (number of species) during the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic (until 
the Quaternary) and its overall correlation with in long-term sea level (after MaCrae et al., 1996).

Despite disagreement as to the precise number of dinocyst species in each 

chrono-geologic unit (see Macrae et al., 1996, Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005 and Taylor 

et al., 2008), the profile of diversity plots is strikingly similar across different studies, 

indicating that it reflects natural events, rather than sampling or methodological 

artifacts (Macrae et al., 1996). Overall, the cyst-diversity plot correlates well with the 

long-term sea-level curve, with high diversity associated to periods of high sea levels

57

and large shelf seas, plausibly manifesting the preference of dinoflagellates for shelf 

environments (Macrae et al., 1996; Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). The declining trend 

from the Lower Cenozoic until the present day somewhat parallels the development 

of the Earth’s cryosphere (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). 

The rapid radiation of dinocysts from the Late Triassic into the Early Jurassic, 

characterized by a marked proliferation of morphological types (namely as regards 

tabulation) and followed, after the Middle Jurassic, by a relative stabilization of major 

lineages, was interpreted as a truly evolutionary event (Fensome et al., 1999), despite 

early concerns over the incompleteness of the fossil record. This interpretation is 

strengthened by the occurrence of sequential appearances of individual families 

with a link provided by intermediate tabulations (e.g., peridinioids appear to have 

derived from gonyaulacaleans via a cladopyxiinean ancestor already present in the 

Early Jurassic) (Fensome et al., 1999). Available evidence that core structural features 

of the dinoflagellates as we know them today, such as the cingulum and the sulcus, may 

have evolved during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic radiation also points in that same 

direction, having been supported by molecular analyses (Medlin &amp;amp; Fensome, 2013).

The first morphological (tabulation-based) groups to appear were suessioids and 

gonyaulacoids, followed by peridinioids, which underwent a quick expansion in the 

Cretaceous (Taylor et al., 2008). By the Middle Jurassic, the main gonyaulacoid-

peridinioid lineages (under the subclass Peridiniphycidae) to which most known fossil 

dinoflagellates belong were already established. After the mid Jurassic, the appearance 

of new groups within the dominant Peridiniphycidae subclass involve only minor 

morphological changes, (e.g., peridiniaceans differ from the earlier heterocapsaeans 

by the elimination of one apical plate boundary and the protoperidinaceans derive 

from peridinaciens via a reduction in the number of apical plates), contrasting with 

the major tabulation innovations that emerged in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic 

(Fensome et al., 1999). In general, no new important cyst types appear after the 

Mezosoic (Taylor et al., 2008). The first freshwater fossil dinocysts, consisting of 

species of the ceratioid group, appeared in Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) deltaic 

pounds, having thus a much shorter record than dinocysts in marine facies (Martín-

Closas, 2003). Differently from other groups, dinoflagellates do not seem to have been 

affected by species extinction at the Cretaceous-Terciary boundary (K/T) (Macrae et 

al., 1996), as all major lineages survived to this day (Taylor, 2004). However, regional 

evolution and extinctions of species during the late Cenozoic may have occurred, in 

connection to dramatic climatic variations at the onset of continental glaciations, as 

suggested by differences in cyst assemblages in mid-high latitudes of the Northern 

and Southern Hemispheres (De Vernal, 2009).

5.2.2. Dinocyst biozonations

Dinoflagellate cysts occur in a wide variety of marine sediments, from shales, clays 

and marls to sandstones and limestones (Sargeant, 1974). The circumstance that they 

can be found from inner neritic to pelagic settings makes dinocyst biostratigraphy 

particularly apt for correlations between proximal and distal marine sites (Pross 

et al., 2010). Relative to calcareous microfossils (e.g., foraminifera, calcareous 

nannoplankton), organic-walled cysts present the additional advantage that they do 

not suffer decalcification and are resistant to diagenetic processes as well as to mild 

thermal metamorphism (Sargeant, 1974). Relative to macrofossils, the analysis of 

dinocysts typically requires smaller amounts of material, remaining applicable to 

very small core samples (Pross, 2001; Sargeant, 1974). Dinoflagellates taxonomy is 

also more highly constrained than that of other palynomorphs, such as acritarchs 

and miospores (e.g., angiosperm pollen), thus allowing for more robust approaches 

(Fensome, Crux, et al., 2008). Taken together, these characteristics make organic-

walled fossil dynocists the prime candidates upon which to base a biostratigraphy of 

marine Mesozoic-Cenozoic strata.

Pioneer dinocyst-based biostratigraphic studies were largely the work of 

palynologists seeking a better understanding of petroleum systems (Williams et al., 

2004). An increased recognition of the usefulness of dinocysts ecobiostratigraphy in 

hydrocarbon exploration established it as routine tool in the past decades (Pross &amp;amp; 

Brinkhuis, 2005). Evidence that higher stratigraphic resolution can be obtained from 

dinocysts as compared to any other microfossil group has been reported for several oil 

and gas exploration sites at the central North Sea (Gradstein, Kristiansen, Loemo, &amp;amp; 

Kaminski, 1992). All earlier studies were however limited to local subsurface sections 

and did not include independent chronostratigraphic calibrations of dinocyst events 

(Williams et al., 2004). Increased efforts towards more extensive studies, allowing 

for the correlation of multiple sections, (including reference surface sections and 

stratotypes) and for external chronostratigraphical controls (e.g., biotic calibration 

to other fossil groups, such as foraminifers and planktonic nannofossils, or to 

macrofossils, magnetostratigraphy calibration, chemostratigraphic calibration) were 

thus developed, leading to the proposal of dinocyst biozonations for comprehensive 

regions and time intervals (Williams et al., 2004). 

A broad listing of dinocyst zonations for the Cretaceous-Cenozoic of the Northern 

Hemisphere and the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene of the Southern Hemisphere can 

be found in Williams et al. (2004), who also discuss remaining issues of calibration, 

particularly for the Paleogene in the Southern Ocean, and the problems faced by 



Dinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology

59

Neogene zonations in higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere due to shortage 

of specimens (reflecting the destruction of cysts by oxygen-rich waters and/or the 

disappearance of cyst-producing dinoflagellates from the Antarctic realm during 

the Oligocen). Significant formal calibrated dinocyst zonations were provided, e.g., 

for the Late Cretaceous-Early Oligocene and the Quaternary in the East Tasman 

Plateau (Brinkhuis, Sengers, Sluijs, Warnaar, &amp;amp; Williams, 2003), the Late Cretaceous 

and the Cenozoic of the Scotian Margin (Eastern Canada) (Fensome, Crux et al., 

2008), the northern European Turonian (Olde et al., 2015), the upper Albian to lower 

Maastrichtian in the Barents Sea (Radmacher, Tyszka, Mangerud, &amp;amp; Pearce, 2014), or 

the Eocene-Oligocen transition in the Southern Ocean (Sluijs et al., 2003).

Of special note is the global index of dinoflagellate cyst events published by Williams 

et al. (2004), which encompasses both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres 

and can be used as a general reference for comparison in dinocyst stratigraphical 

research. Conducted under the framework of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), 

it compiled the results of numerous dinocyst studies with independent age control 

(to other microfossils and to palaeomagnetic ages) for the Northern Hemisphere 

and compared them with proposed zonations of the Southern Ocean and with the 

analysis of dinocyst data from two sites (offshore Tasmania, Southern Hemisphere) 

of the ODP Leg 189, for which magnetostratigraphic and biotic calibrations were 

also available. By collating the stratigraphic ranges of different taxa, they produced a 

sequence of dinocyst events in association with standard timescales for the Mezoic 

(Gradstein and Ogg, 1996) and the Cenozoic (Berggren et al., 1995), and extending 

from the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) to the Zanclean stage in the Neogene. 

The stratigraphic ranges are conveyed through the indication of the First 

Ocurrence (FO) and Last Ocurrence (LO) for each taxon in mega-annum (Ma) 

Acknowledging the marked “provincialism” (geographical differentiation of dinocyst 

assemblages as a function of such factors as latitude/temperature) in the fossil record, 

first recognized in Mesozoic sediments (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005), Williams et al. 

(2004) also add to the FO/LO of each taxon its assignment to high-, middle- or 

lower-latitudes in the Northern or Southern Hemispheres. Fig. 15 schematically 

illustrates the global dinoflagellate cyst events for the Turonian (A) and Cenomanian 

(B) stages of the Upper Cretaceous provided in Williams et al. (2004).

5.2.3. Dinocyst stratigraphic studies in Portugal (Mesozoic-Cenozoic)

As the present work specifically concerns a section of the Lusitanian Basin dating 

from the Lower to Middle Cenomanian, we provide in the following a brief overview 

of dinocysts biostratigraphic studies conducted in Portugal (also allowing in, by 

convenience, some references to the Iberian Peninsula), especially those focusing on the 

Lusitanian Basin. In a stratigraphic study of the Castilian Platform in Northern Spain, 

based on dinoflagellate cysts, Peyrot (2011) reported that, as regards the Cenomian/

Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) in the Iberian Peninsula, only one Portuguese

61

succession had been examined by Berthou, Foucher, Lecocq, and Moron (1980). In 

fact, at least one more study by Berthou and collaborators was concerned with Albian 

(Lower Cretaceous) and Cenomanian (Upper Creaceous) dinocysts in different 

outcrops of the Lusitanian Basin (Lisbon Region) with a prime biostratigraphical 

focus (Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler, 1982). A few significant biostratigraphical analyses 

based on dinoflagellate cysts have addressed Lower Cretaceous sections (Berriasian 

to Albian) in both the Lusitanian and the Algarve Basins: Berthou and Leereveld 

(1990); Heimhofer, Hochuli Burla, and Weissert (2007), Horikx, Heimhofer, Dinis, 

and Huck (2014). This latter study revised the stratigraphy of Albian strata in three 

sections of the Lusitanian Basin based on dinocyst assemblages with an independent 

chemostratigraphic calibration (strontium-isotope and carbon-isotope stratigraphy), 

allowing for a high-resolution and well-constrained stratigraphical model. 

Most palynological studies allowing a room for the examination of dynocyst 

assemblages in Portuguese successions concern the Jurassic (more frequently Lower 

and Middle), e.g.: Barrón, Comas-Rengifo, and Duarte (2013) and Oliveira, Dino, 

Duarte, and Perilli (2007) focusing a Lower Jurassic section (Pliensbachian/Toarcian) 

of the Lusitanian Basin; Borges, Riding, Fernandes, and Pereira (2011) and Borges, 

Riding, Fernandes, Matos, and Pereira (2012), respectively addressing Pliensbachian 

to Kimmeridgian (mid-Lower to mid-Upper Jurassic) and Callovian (Middle Jurassic) 

stages in the Algarve Basin; Davies (1985), focusing the Sinemurian to Aalian interval 

(Lower to Middle Jurassic) in the central Lusitanian Basin; Doubinger, Adloff, and 

Palain (1970), affording a biostratigraphical analysis of the Lower Portuguese Mesozoic 

(Early Jurassic, reaching down to Late Triassic); Fernandes, Borges, Rodrigues, and 

Matos (2010), examining the Middle-Upper Jurassic (Callovian and Oxfordian stages) 

of the Algarve Basin at two offshore sites; Marques and Rocha (1988), addressing the 

Callovian of Eastern Algarve; Sousa (1998), focusing on the Oxfordian-Tithonian 

(Upper Jurassic) of the Lusitanian Basin. A few studies can also be found concerning 

the Cenozoic, e.g.: Castro (2010), focusing on the Tortonian (Late Miocene) deposits of 

the Lower Tagus basin; Castro, Borges, Pereira, Fernandes, and Pais (2013), addressing 

the biostratigraphical correlation between the Lower Tagus and the Algarve Basins on 

the basis of Miocene (Neogene) dinocysts assemblages; Gonçalves, Mendonça Filho, 

da Silva, Mendonça, and Flores (2014), covering the palynological content (dynocists 

included) of a set of stratigraphic units ranging from Middle Jurassic to the Neogene 

in the Lower Tagus basin.

The degree to which dinoflagellate cysts were used with a proper biostratigraphic 

view in this array of studies is rather variable (exception made to the Cretaceous subset 

of studies, where this is invariably a primary focus), going from merely recognizing 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

62

their occurrence in the samples (e.g., Gonçalves et al., 2014), to according them a 

supplementary role as regards other palynomorphs (notably spores and pollens), to 

using them as major biostratigraphical constraints (with or without additional age 

controls). Stratigraphic ranges delimited by First and Last Occurrences (FO and FA) 

or First Common and Last Common Ocurrences (FCO and LCO) of dinocyst taxa 

are offered in some studies, but not in many others. As regards the Upper Cretaceous, 

in particular the Cenomanian, Berthou et al. (1980) and Berthou and Hasenboehler 

(1982) emerge as the only available studies to the best of our knowledge, confirming 

the scarcity of dinocyst-calibrated stratigraphic models for the Portuguese successions 

corresponding to this geochronological span.

5.3 ECOLOGY AND PALAEOCOLOGY

Dinoflagellates are a highly diverse eukaryotic group which can be found in virtually 

any aquatic environment, from marine (around 90% of living species) to fresh 

water, predominantly in pelagic habitats, but also sometimes in sand (psammophylic 

dinoflagellates), ice or snow (Marret &amp;amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Taylor et al., 2008). Forming 

a significant part of the phytoplankton, they are important as primary producers. 

While most of the over 2000 inventoried extant species are free-living, a small 

percentage are endosymbionts (e.g., the zooxanthellae, associated with reef-forming 

corals) or parasites of other protists and animals (Taylor et al., 2008). 

Several characteristics of dinoflagellates favor their occurrence in a wide array of 

environments, noticeably among them (1) ability for directional swimming (as motile 

cells) and (2) diversity of trophic strategies (Hacket et al. 2004). In contrast to diatoms 

(see Smayda, 2002), controlled swimming allows dinoflagellates to position at distinct 

depths in the water column (vertical migrations) as a function of parameters such 

as, e.g., nutrients concentration, light intensity, salinity, sea surface temperature or 

oxygen availability. Differential sensitivity to these parameters has moreover been 

found across individual species (Anderson &amp;amp; Stolzenbach, 1985; Hacket et al., 2004). 

As for nutrition, about half of dinoflagellates taxa are photo-synthetic and the 

other half heterotrophic, predating to a large extent on other protists, particularly 

diatoms. Most photosynthetic dinoflagellates are not actually autotrophic but 

mixotrophic, combining photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Capture and feeding 

behavior among heterotrophs can be highly variable, ranging from phagotrophy (non 

thecate cells that engulf their preys) to myzocytosis or pallium-feeding (Hoppenrath 



Dinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology

63

&amp;amp; Saldarriaga, 2012; Jacobson &amp;amp; Anderson, 1986). Taken together, these ecologically 

relevant characteristics have allowed dinoflagellates as a group to globally exploit 

coastal waters, while at the same time exhibiting considerable habitat specialization at 

the level of individual species (Hackett et al., 2004; Smayda, 2002; Taylor, 1987; Wall, 

Dale, Lohmann, &amp;amp; Smith, 1977).

As mentioned earlier, some proportion (around 10 to 20 %) of dinoflagellates 

produce dormant resistant cysts, mostly organic-walled (made of dinosporin, which 

resists decalcification), as part of their life-cycle. These cysts deposit on the bottom 

sediments, where they form seed banks available for the renewal of motile forms 

and become additionally prone to fossilization (Sargeant, 1974; Taylor et al., 2008). 

The potential of the geographical distribution of dinocysts in the sediments for 

reconstructing salient environmental and climatic features of the upper water surfaces 

has been successfully demonstrated for neritic (e.g., estuaries, epicontinental seas, 

continental shelves) and pelagic settings (e.g., Marret &amp;amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Pross &amp;amp; 

Brinkhuis, 2005; Wall et al., 1977), despite a number of acknowledged limitations 

(Dale, 1996; de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007; Wall et al., 1977). 

As reliably identified fossil organic-walled dinocysts are available from the Triassic 

onward, the prospect of reconstructing past environments and climates based on cysts 

distribution in ancient sediments was also opened thereby (Marret &amp;amp; Zonneveld, 

2003; Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). However, the palaeoecology of fossil cysts requires, 

as a precondition, detailed information on the relationships between present day 

environmental conditions and the distribution of modern cysts in recent sediments 

(Zonneveld et al., 2013).

5.3.1. The ecological classification of organic-walled dinocysts: ground 

concepts

The geographical distribution of modern dinocysts was initially the subject of separate 

regional studies (e.g., western South Africa (Davey, 1971), North Atlantic Ocean 

(Williams, 1971)). In 1977, Wall et al. released a landmark study, based on 168 samples 

from fourteen geographical regions of mainly the North and South Atlantic oceans 

and adjacent seas, which set the basis for an ecological classification of dinoflagellates 

cysts as proxies to environmental-climatic factors characterizing different “water-

types”, particularly sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity. Two main trends, 

relating to distance to the shore (estuarine, estuarine-neritic, neritic, neritic-ocenic 

and oceanic) and to latitude-climate (cool water of temperate zones, warm water of 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

64

tropical and subtropical zones) were identified in the distribution of marine cyst-

based taxa. These two gradients have been consistently replicated in more recent and 

geographically broader studies, with sea surface temperature typically explaining the 

largest variance of species distributional data (Marret &amp;amp; Zonneveld, 2003; Zonneveld 

et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2008). 

Two other fundamental contributions of the Wall et al. (1977) paper involve the 

conceptual framework for an ecologically relevant interpretation of cysts distribution 

in the sediments and, related to it, the consideration of diversity signals within cyst 

assemblages, in addition to differences in species composition and the peak abundance 

of individual taxa (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). 

Most organic-walled cyst producing dinoflagellates inhabit shallower-waters 

along continental margins characterized by unstable and unpredictable (i.e., displaying 

high seasonal variability and irregular recurrence of conditions) hydrographic regimes 

(Wall et al., 1977; de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007). Consistent to what might be expected 

from an evolutionary adaptive standpoint, the most abundant taxa tend towards a 

cosmopolitan opportunistic distribution, exhibiting broad tolerance to salinity 

gradients (euryhaline properties), little thermal preference (eurythermic properties), 

slender differentiation along the inshore-offshore component and incipient speciation 

(limited to slight variations in features of cyst morphology, such as processes and 

spines) (Wall et al., 1977). 

These generalist taxa, due to their geographical ubiquity, are of reduced value 

to palaecological reconstructions. Those of greatest interest correspond to focused 

adaptations, at the species level, to stable sectors of the aquatic environments, typically 

occurring at the terminal/subterminal portions of the salinity and thermic regimes 

(Wall et al., 1977). Examples of such stenotopic taxa are the stenohalines Leptodinium, 

adapted to fully saline ocean water, and Gonyaulax apiculata, found only in freshwater 

lake sediments (Wall et al., 1977), or the stenothermics Impagidinium Palidum, adapted 

to cold ocean waters, and Islandinium, used as a marker of seasonal sea-ice cover (de 

Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007). Fig. 16 illustrates these two sorts of adaptation to the thermic 

and salinity domains: generalist adaptation, tolerant to wide range variations and 

leading to cosmopolitan distributions (eurytopic taxa), and specialized adaptation 

to the terminal sectors of these domains, reflected in geographically restricted 

distribution patterns (stenotopic taxa).

While inshore-offshore and latitudinal distributional trends are primarily reflected 

in the peak abundance (or exclusive occurrence) of different taxa in their optimum 

environments, they are also manifest in changes of species associations (co-occurring 

species) both across environment-climatic units and along the transitional regions in 



Dinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology

65

between them (e.g., estuarine-coastal or neritic-ocean transitions). This is consistent 

with the view that cysts assemblages arise from the combination of ecological groups 

through hydrographic mixing, so that species associations express the cumulative 

effects of individual taxa distributions (Wall et al., 1977).

sediments according to climatic regions (entailing distinct degrees of thermic-related tolerance) and of their 
corresponding salinity-related tolerance (slightly modified from de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007). The asterisk “*” 
indicates taxa exclusively found in the northern Hemisphere; the “o” signals taxa only found in sediments 
of the southern Hemisphere.

In addition to these two indices, Wall et al. (1977) promoted a measure of species 

diversity (number of species in an assemblage after normalization to the sample size: 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

see Hurlbert, 1971), widely accepted among ecologists to reflect the amount of stress 

in ecosystems (higher diversity associating with lower stress). Inshore-offshore and 

latitudinal trends were again detected with the diversity index, showing seaward 

augmented diversity and an increase towards low latitudes (intertropical areas, with 

low seasonal temperature constraints) in both hemispheres. Less ecologically stressed 

environments were thus coincident overall with the more stable and predictable ones, 

and diversity was most often augmented by the occurrence of a small set of more 

stenotopic species in addition to a background of cosmopolitan species (Wall et al., 

1977).

Pearce (2000) proposed in this sense that a ratio of cyst species diversity to their 

absolute abundance be used as an index of environmental stability-predictability 

(SPI), with increasing values indicating higher stability. Also, considering its broad 

alignment with an inshore-offshore direction, the diversity index can be cautiously 

used as an indicator of shoreline proximity, changes in sea level and the occurrence of 

transgressive-regressive phases. As indicated by Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis (2005), dinocysts-

based reconstruction of sea-levels has been chiefly based on (1) studies of assemblage 

composition and (2) studies of the diversity and abundance within assemblages.

5.3.2. Dinocysts-based environmental signals and new sets of environmental 

factors 

On the following of the Wall et al. (1977) paper, which laid down a framework for 

the use of dinocysts in palaeoceanographic studies, many regional studies of cysts 

distribution and their relation to environmental indices were conducted (for an 

extensive enumeration, covering the period from 1980 to early 2000-ths, see Marret 

&amp;amp; Zonnevel, 2003; see also de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007), and a first map of recent 

dinocysts in bottom sediments from the North Atlantic Ocean (and adjacent seas) 

was published by Harland in 1984. More updated databases were later provided for 

the North Atlantic Ocean (Rochon, de Vernal, Turon, Matthiessen, &amp;amp; Head, 1999; 

de Vernal et al., 2001), leading to an Atlas of the world-wide distribution of modern 

organic-walled dinocysts, including the relationships of their relative abundance to 

surface-water parameters, released by Marret and Zonnevel in 2003. A new extended 

version of this Atlas, published by Zonneveld et al. in 2013 on the basis of information 

gathered from 2045 sites (comparing to 835 in the early version) affords, to the best 

of our knowledge, the most comprehensive source on extant dinocysts geographical 

distribution and its relation to environmental factors.



Dinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology

67

One noticeable feature of the more recent studies of dinocysts ecology is the 

enlargement of environmental parameters considered. Nitrates and phosphates 

(nutrients) concentrations, chlorophyll-a concentrations (indexing phytoplankton 

production), and bottom water oxygen concentrations (indexing the redox state of 

bottom waters) have thus also been included as environmental parameters in the 

Zonneveld et al. (2013) synthesis, in addition to more standard measures of annual and 

seasonal SST and salinity. New relationships between cysts assemblages and oxidation, 

an important taphonomic factor which differentially affects organic-walled cysts taxa 

(Zonneveld, Versteegh, &amp;amp; Kodrans-Nsiah, 2008), sea-surface productivity and trophic 

regimes could in that way be exploited and made available for use in palaecological 

reconstructions (see the species ecological classification on each environmental 

parameter proposed in Zonneveld et al. (2013).

Given the above said, the number of ecological signals to be derived from 

dinocysts assemblages has naturally grown. In 1996, Dale identified six cyst-based 

signals, relating to coastal versus oceanic waters, salinity, sea-level temperature, and 

sea-water productivity (including, e.g., oceanic upwelling and coastal eutrophication), 

which all depended on the species composition of assemblages (Dale, 1996, 2001). 

A number of other signals may currently be added to the former, concerning, e.g., 

benthic oxygenation and ventilation of water columns (see Pross, 2001), stratification 

of water masses and circulation of surface water (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005), sea-ice 

coverage, SST seasonality, or transport mechanisms (de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007). 

Furthermore, ecological signals have increasingly been linked to a network of 

specific indices (qualitative and/or quantitative) which often contribute to more 

than one type of signal. For instance, an increase in the proportion of heterotrophic 

species in cysts assemblages – commonly assessed by the ratio Protoperidiniaceae/ 

Gonyaulacaceae (P/G, with P-cysts taken to be mostly heterotrophic, and G-cysts 

autotrophic) – may indicate changes in ocean upwelling intensity, augmented 

productivity unrelated to upwelling (due, e.g., to SST changes) or eutrophication in 

systems without previous nutrients limitation (Dale, 2001); hence, additional indices, 

such as changes in cysts concentration and the concrete species associations (namely, 

low vs. high latitude taxa), need to be jointly considered in order to distinguish 

among the alternatives (Dale, 2001; de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007). Conversely, distance 

to the shoreline may be indicated by a prevalence of taxa with known oceanic/

neritic distributions, changes in the diversity signal in the assemblages, or simply an 

increase/decrease of dinocysts abundance (cyst-producing dinoflagellates being mostly 

confined to coastlines, marked abundance speaks in favor of shoreline proximity) 

(Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005; de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007; Taylor et al., 2008). Such indices 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

68

have been broadly used in reconstructing sea level changes (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). 

However, many parameters mediate the relationship between cysts distribution and 

the nearshore-offshore gradient (e.g., water turbulence, water stratification, nutrients 

availability, long distance transport), calling on a cautious interpretation of results 

and on a multi-proxy approach to palaeoenvironmental inferences. For example, the 

impact of transport mechanisms on the assemblage might be evaluated with the 

(pollen + spores)/dinocyst ratio (Pol/Din), taken to reflect the terrestrial vs. marine 

origin of the organic flux (see de Vernal, 2009, and de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007, who 

refer to this ratio as a “continentality” index). An updated synthetic presentation and 

discussion of many of the environmental indices and ecological signals available from 

organic-walled dinocysts is provided by de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret (2007).

Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis (2005) indicate as two main advantages of using organic-walled 

dinocysts as (palaeo)environmental tracers (1) their sensitivity to even slight changes 

of several properties of surface waters (particularly temperature, where they compare 

favorably to most other microfossils), and (2) their abundance in neritic sediments, 

affording complementary information to that derived from offshore calcareous 

and siliceous fossil groups such as c. Even if much less studied, the potential (pala)

ecological relevance of calcareous dinocysts in the sediments of open oceanic waters 

(Dale &amp;amp; Dale, 1992) has received growing attention as a source for the reconstruction 

of upper water conditions (especially productivity, stratification and surface water 

currents) in domains where organic-walled cysts are inexistent (Vink, 2004; Vink, 

Brune, Holl, Zonneveld, &amp;amp; Willems, 2002; Wendler, Gräfe &amp;amp; Willems, 2002; Wiese, 

Zobel, &amp;amp; Keupp, 2015). Freshwater dinoflagellate cysts have also known a regain 

in interest as ecological/environmental proxies. In an up to date review, Mertens, 

Rengefors, Moestrup, and Ellegaard (2012) documented their potential usefulness 

in palaecological reconstructions, namely as indicators of temperature, pH and 

productivity (despite the fact that only a few freshwater dinocysts have the potential 

to fossilize). De Vernal (2009) has accorded them a role in assessing the freshwater 

versus marine character of sediments, and thereby in the reconstruction of sea level 

changes.

5.3.3. Dinocysts-based palaeoecology 

The palaecology of organic-walled dinocysts has been mostly studied in Quater-

nary marine sediments, due to the abundance of extant taxa allowing for an 

actuopalaeontological approach (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005) and the use of robust 



Dinoflagellates Taxonomy, Stratigraphical distribution and Palaeoecology

69

quantitative reconstruction methods, such as the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT: 

see de Vernal, 2009; Simpson, 2007). Some of those studies, concerning in particular the 

late Quaternary, were specifically motivated by environmental goals, such as gaining 

a better understanding of eutrophication and pollution (Dale, 2001, 2009). The last 

interglacial period before the present one, corresponding to the Eemian stage in 

the Pleistocene, has been the focus of a considerable number of palaeoceanographic 

studies based on dinoflagellate cysts (e.g., Head, 2007; Van Nieuwenhove, &amp;amp; Bauch, 

2008). Dinocysts-based reconstructions of palaeoceanographic conditions and 

palaeoclimates in the Neogene, both during the Miocene (e.g., Louwye, Foubert, 

Mertens, Van Rooij, &amp;amp; IODP Expedition 307 scientific party, 2008) and the Pliocene 

(e.g., Head &amp;amp; Westphal, 1999), were also proposed. As for the Paleogene, important 

climatic events such as Earth’s greenhouse-icehouse transition (e.g., Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 

2005; Sluijs, Pross, &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005) and the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum 

(e.g., Sluijs et al., 2008) were addressed resorting to dynocist studies (see also Pross, 

2001, addressing the palaeo-oxygenation of epeiric settings in the Oligocene). 

Mesozoic studies using organic-walled cysts as palaeoenvironmental tracers are 

scarcer. Most of the references included in Riding’s (2012, 2013, 2014) compilation of 

the literature on Triassic, Jurassic, and earliest Cretaceous dinoflagellate cysts concern 

dinoflagellates taxonomy and biostratigraphy, with only residual examples of attempts 

at palaeoecological reconstructions. Moreover, for reasons related to the extensive 

nature of marine strata and the diversity of dinocysts of the Late Jurassic (Riding, 

2012), most of the studies are focused on the Jurassic period, with little coverage of 

the Cretaceous. 

Among the organic-walled cyst-based palaeoenvironmental studies of the Late 

Cretaceous (which includes the stratigraphic time interval of interest in our study, 

i.e. the Cenomanian Age), most deal with the palaeoceanographic conditions during 

the Cenomanian-Turonian transition. Noteworthy examples are Pearce, Karvis, and 

Tocher (2009), and Peyrot, Barroso-Barcenilla, and Susanne Feist-Burkhardt (2012), 

focusing, respectively, on a reference section in England and an outcrop in Central 

Spain. In addition to the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, Lignum (2009) also 

affords palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of the Albian/Cenomanian boundary, 

and the mid-Cenomaniam across several palaeogeographical regions. Examples of a 

few palaecological studies addressing other time intervals include Dodsworth (2016), 

focusing on the middle to upper Cenomanian, Skupien (2003), focusing on the 

upper Barremiam-Albian ages of the Lower Cretaceous, and Pestchevitskaya (2008), 

focusing on a Berriasian to Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) section of the Siberia 

palaeobasin.

6.1. SAMPLING

As a first required step, a stratigraphical profile was elaborated at the base of the south 

side of the Nazaré promontory, including a section with 13,5 meters and 49 strata 

encompassing alternate layers of marls and limestones with biostromes of Ilymatogyra 

pseudoafricana and a sequence of laminitic marly levels with Gyrostrea ouremensis (see 

section 3.4 in chapter 3 for details). Careful sedimentological analysis of the profile 

helped determine which layers afforded the most convenient lithology for sample 

collecting. The main criteria used were the type of granulometry (preferably thin) 

and the color of the sediment (a darker sediment would be preferred as it allows 

inferring a larger quantity of organic matter). The joint use of these criteria led to 

the selection of the marly levels in the profile as the most suitable ones, providing the 

array of layers from which the samples were then collected. 

Samples were extracted from distinct marly levels, well separated apart in the 

profile, so as to provide a perspective on the distribution of dinoflagellates and other 

palynomorphs throughout the spanned time interval. Accordingly, samples were 

taken from layers more near the base, the middle and the top section of the profile. 

Furthermore, within each sampled layer, 2 or 3 samples were taken from the base, 

the middle (in case there were 3 samples) and the top of the layer. Accounting for 

the requirements of the subsequent laboratorial processing procedures, the amount 

of collected sediment for each sample was set to 200 grams.

B respectively designate the top, middle and base sections in each layer.

A total of 11 distinct samples were taken from four distinct layers of the geological 

profile. The first three samples were taken from the base, middle and top of stratum 

nº 47 in the stratigraphic column. Three samples were similarly collected from the 

lower, middle and upper sections of stratum nº 33, and three other from the upper, 

middle and lower sections of stratum nº 15. The two final samples were taken from 

stratum nº 16. Given that this particular layer was only 10 cm thick, only two samples 

were collected, one from the base and one from the top (see Fig. 17).

Additional care was taken in keeping the sampling restricted to the inner 

sediments in each layer, avoiding the top sediments, typically more exposed and 

vulnerable to contamination. The collected sediments were placed in appropriate 

plastic bags which were properly identified and taken to the laboratory for analysis.

6.2. PALYNOLOGICAL PROCESSING

The fluxogram presented in the following (Fig. 18) summarizes the sequence of 

procedural stages leading from the sample collecting to the final palynological 

processing (Costa, 2015).

Figure 18 – Fluxogram of processing stages.

As noted by L. Castro (2006), «a good palynological procedure depends on the 

“know-how” of each researcher, astuteness and technique, along with some personal 

involvement. It is essential to have access to adequate equipment» (p. 87). Since I was 

given the opportunity to go through the laboratorial procedures in the Laboratory of 

Palynology of the LNEG, Porto, the standard palynological techniques of the LNEG 

were employed, which include consecutive treatments of the sampled material with 

chloridric and fluoridric acids. Several of these procedures have been the subject of 

careful descriptions in Borges (2012) and A description of the main features of these 

four processing stages is given below:

Physical fractionation - After being cleaned, samples were smashed into thinner 

particles (which potentiates the action of the acids) with a suitable hammer (Fig. 19). 

The resulting fragments were then washed in tap water in order to remove subsisting 

larger sized particles which might react violently to the acids.

Figure 19 – Physical fractionation of the samples.

Demineralization - The fragments were placed in clearly identified teflon cups 

with large bottlenecks, which allow treatment with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric 

acids (see Fig. 20A and B). The sediment underwent several attacks with acids with 

different concentrations, in order for the mineral fraction to be progressively removed. 

This was performed in a laboratory hood that limited exposure to toxic fumes and 

facilitated the handling of the chemical products. Three consecutive acid attacks were 

applied:

(1) With hydrochloric acid (for the elimination of carbonates): the samples 

were submitted to a 48 hours treatment with hydrochloric acid (20% 

concentration), which can be extended to 4 days, if necessary. The volume 

of hydrochloric acid used was always enough to cover all of the sediment, 

and effervescence had to cease completely before proceeding to the next 

treatment step. In case effervescence was excessive, a few drops of alcohol 

were added as a means to control it. The solution was then diluted with tap 

water (passing through a filtering system) and additionally filtered (15 ?m 

sieve) to remove any chlorides that may have formed. Before removing the 

fluid, the sample was left to decant for a minimum of 4 hours, allowing 

palynomorphs to deposit during that time; 

(2) With hydrofluoric acid (for the elimination of silicates): hydrofluoric acid 

(37% concentration) was added to the residue for a period of 6 to 10 days. 

This reaction generates a lot of heat, with the potential to damage the cups or 

even endanger the person who is conducting the procedure. For that reason, 

the cups were placed in cold water so that the resulting heat from the reaction 

dissipates. To boost the effect of the acid, they were then revolved periodically 



Method and Procedures

75

(twice a day), the residue was subjected to successive decantations, and the acid 

renewed. After the sample was completely disaggregated, it was neutralized 

through consecutive decantations with water and subsequently filtered; 

(3) With hydrochloric acid (for the elimination of fluorides and sulfides): a hot 

attack with HCl was conducted to eliminate secondary minerals like insoluble 

fluorides and sulfides that might have resisted the previous treatments. The 

solution was boiled for about 5 minutes to eliminate the remaining mineral 

fraction. As in the previous stages, the remaining sediment was diluted, 

decanted and filtered (15 ?m filter) until the water became transparent and 

the acid was completely removed. In case a considerable mineral fraction 

subsisted after these procedures, the sample was again submitted to chemical 

treatment with HF for about 12 to 24 hours.

Following these three attacks, the remaining residue was cleaned with dispersant 

(for the elimination of thin mineral matter), washed and sieved (15 ?m sieve) (see 

Fig. 20C). In cases where leftovers of resistant minerals remained in the sediment, the 

treatment with hydrofluoric acid was repeated. When there was the further need to 

eliminate soluble organic matter (which hampers the observation of the lamina on 

the microscope), oxidation of the residue was induced, followed by a new cycle of 

washing and sieving, which concluded the demineralization stage.

76

Concentration of the organic content - In some samples, the resulting organic 

residue after the demineralization was scarce and a considerable mineral fraction had 

resisted the series of acid attacks. Two methods were then applied for the concentration 

of the organic residue. In samples with a really high mineral content, separation of the 

mineral and the organic fraction was achieved by using zinc chloride (znCl
2
), a high 

density liquid (2gm/cm3). The residues, placed in tubes, were centrifugated at 4000 

r.p.m for 5 minutes (with a balanced weight per tube). After the supernatant water 

was eliminated, about 5 ml of znCl
2 
solution was added to each tube, which was then 

shaken and had their weight adjusted. A further 5 minutes centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m 

was performed, following which the supernanant, containing the concentrated organic 

residue, was removed with a pipette. The collected residue was examined under the 

microscope and, if no mineral fraction was detected, transferred to a beaker where 

the solution was neutralized with water. Otherwise, a new centrifugation cycle took 

place. After neutralization, the final residue was washed, filtered with a 15 ?m sieve, 

and stored in small and properly labeled vials (Fig. 20D).

For samples with a low remaining mineral fraction, a second method was used. 

Concentration of the organic matter was then achieved by panning in a watch glass 

with water. The supernatant was removed with a pipette and the process repeated 

several times, so that all the organic matter could be removed. The recovered organic 

residue was then stored in properly identified small vials with water. A drop of diluted 

HCl was added to the vials in order to avoid fungal proliferation.

Preparing the slides for microscopic analysis - With the concentrated organic 

content moved to glass made beakers, a few drops of hydroxyethylcellulose (dispersant) 

were added to the solution to favor the dispersal of the palynomorphs at the time 

the lamellae were assembled. The solution was then manually agitated to become 

homogeneous and distributed by several lamellae with a pipette. These were placed in 

an appropriate greenhouse and left to dry at a constant temperature of 30ºC (Fig. 21B). 

The lamellae were labeled and assembled as microscope slides, using acrylic resin 

(Entelan®) as mounting medium. After a 2 hours rest, for the resin to settle and dry, 

the microscope slides were ready to be observed. As preliminary observations of 

the first slides revealed that the palynological content was not optimally visible, the 

practice was adopted of using a biological stain (Safranin) to highlight the structures 

of dinoflagellates and other palynomorphs. Several slides from each sample were 

thus prepared after first staining the organic fraction with Safranin for a period of 15 

minutes to 4 hours (see Fig. 21A). These slides were then studied on a biological SMI 

microscope (Olympus BX40 e Camara Olympus C5050).

7.1. GROUPS OF PALYNOMORPHS AND THEIR RELATIVE 

ABUNDANCE

Analysis of the palynological content of the samples disclosed the occurrence of 

distinct groups of palynomorphs, including 20 dinocysts taxa, 17 sporomorph taxa 

(of which 2 angiosperm and 9 gymnosperm pollen types, and 6 cryptogam spores), 4 

taxa of green-blue algae, common to abundant microforaminiferal linings and a single 

acritarch specimen.One scolecodont, one specimen of Diphyes sp. and a few dinocyst 

type A were also recorded.The identified taxa of dinocysts, spores, angiosperm 

pollen, gymnosperm pollen and algae are alphabetically listed in Tables 2 and 3, 

along with their suprageneric affiliations and an associated code referring to their 

microphotographic illustration in the plates provided in Annex 1. Due to excessive 

fragmentation of the organic residual, two (T2 and T3) of the eleven samples were 

palynologically barren and are thus not considered in the following analyses. 

The relative abundance of these distinct groups in each of the 9 positive samples 

is graphically represented in Fig. 22. These percentages were based on a counting 

of 157-233 palynomorphs/sample, with an average counting of 184 palynomorphs 

per sample. Samples are vertically arranged so as to reflect, from top to bottom, the 

location of the sampled layers in the stratigraphic column (number 1 corresponds to 

layers more towards the top, number 2 to layers near the middle, and numbers 4 and 

3 to layers more towards the base of the profile). Within each layer, corresponding 

to a row, samples are also arranged in a top-down order, with T standing for the top,

The predominance of dinocysts over all other palynomorphs is clear in all 

samples, with a largest value of 85% in sample T1 (top layer) and a lowest value of 

46% in M3 (in the base layer). Microforaminiferal linings and pollen grains alternate, 

depending on the samples, as the second most abundant group, with an advantage of 

microforaminifera in samples M1, B4 and B3, and of pollen grains in T1, B1, M2, T4 

and M3 (equal representation in B2). 

Spores occupy the following position, after dinocysts, pollen and microforaminiferal 

linings, in relative abundance, overcoming microforaminiferal linings in B1, B2 

and T4 samples, and surpassing the percentage of pollen grains in B2 and B3. 

Except for samples B1 and M2, where they reach percentages of, respectively, 10% 

(overcoming microforaminiferal linings) and 7 % (matching the pollen percentage 

and again overcoming microforaminiferal linings), green-blue algae have only residual 

occurrence in a few other samples. The single recorded acritarch specimen represents 

0,58% of the palynomorph content of sample B4.

A joint comparative appreciation of how these percentages vary across samples 

can be obtained from the stacked area chart of Fig. 23, which additionally affords a 

straightforward relation between samples and levels in the stratigraphic succession. 

The T2 and T3 barren samples (enclosed within brackets) are also located as regards 

the succession for convenience, but they have no corresponding values in the chart.

The largest reductions in dinocysts relative abundance (to 46 %) occur at M3 

followed by B4 (57%) and B1 (58%). These reductions are related to somewhat distinct 

patterns of increase of other groups of palynomorphs: in M3 it is the relative increase 

of pollen grains and, although to a much lesser extent, of spores (i.e., the terrestrial 

component) that associates with the reduction in the percentage of dinocysts; in 

B4, an increase of the relative abundance of microforaminiferal linings (included in 

the aquatic-marine component) contributes as well to that reduction; and in B1, 

in addition to important relative increases of pollen and spores, increased relative 

abundance of both the algae and the microforaminiferal (aquatic component) is also 

associated with the diminished percentage of dinocysts.

The marked predominance of Botryococcus sp., a freshwater alga, over the 

remaining algae in B1 (where it represents 89,4 % of the algae content) and in M2 

(where it represents 100% of the algae content), the two samples with a larger fraction 

of green-blue algae, suggests a trend for a more positive balance of freshwater in 

palaeoenvironments associated with layers higher up in the succession (e.g., proximal 

settings subjected to fluvial influence). The largest increases in dinocysts percentages 

occur in turn at T1 (to 85%) and M2 (to 81%): in T1 this is correlative of a decrease 

of all other groups; in M2, it associates primarily with a strong reduction of the 

spores content, accompanied by an also significant reduction of pollen grains (i.e., it 

is chiefly correlative of a reduction of the terrestrial component).

7.2. RELEVANT PALYNOLOGICAL RATIOS 

Several quantitative indexes of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological features 

have been proposed based on ratios between different types of palynomorphs (see 

point 4.3.2 above). Among them, one of the most common is the terrigenous versus 

marine ratio, computed as the sum of pollen grains and spores (representing the 

terrestrial influx) divided by the number of dinocysts (representing the marine 

influx) (de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007) Although complicated by a possible differential 

impact of oxidation conditions on the preservation of dinocysts and sporomorphs 

or by the importance of long-distance transport mechanisms (leading some authors 

to propose the exclusion of bisaccate pollen (e.g., Fernández-Marrón, Gil, Gil-Cid, 

&amp;amp; Fonollá-Ocet, 2010), higher values of this ratio can be taken to signal greater 

proximity to the shoreline, the reason why Vernal and Marret (2007) termed it a 

“continentality” index. Graph A in Fig. 24 plots this ratio (on the ordinate) as a 

function of the productive samples (on the abscissa, ordered from the top to the 

bottom of the stratigraphic column). Values are in all cases below 1, reflecting the 

overall predominance of the marine influx. With the exception of sample M3, where 

the ratio approaches 1 (close to even contribution of terrestrial and marine fluxes), 

the remaining values are actually below 0.5, reflecting a marked dominance of the 

marine component.

87

The red line helps to highlight a slight tendency for higher values of this ratio 

for samples located towards the bottom of the stratigraphic succession (T4 to B3, as 

compared to T1 to M2 or to B2). 

Another proposed palynological ratio for evaluating increases/decreases in 

distance from seashore is the bisacatte pollen versus other pollen ratio (B:O). Due 

to their sac-like appendices, which make them more aero- and hydrodynamically 

efficient for long distance transport, bisaccate conifer pollen tends to increase their 

relative proportion as overall pollen concentration decreases with distance from the 

coastline (e.g., McCarthy, Mudie, Rochon, Gostlin, &amp;amp; Levac, 2000; Rochon &amp;amp; de 

Vernal, 1994; de Vernal, 2009). As any other single palynological ratio, this one may 

alternatively reflect factors other than an onshore-offshore gradient, such as changes 

in the plant communities at the source of the terrestrial influx. Graph B in Fig. 24 

plots the B:O ratio as a function of the productive samples, ordered according to 

their location (from top to bottom) in the stratigraphic profile. Bisaccate pollen, 

represented in the examined samples by Alisporites sp., correspond in every sample 

to a small proportion of the pollen grains, which is reflected in the consistently low 

values of this ratio. A small trend for an increase of the B:O ratio in samples located 

more towards the bottom of the profile (to the right of M2 in the abscissa) can also 

be noticed, but still associated with rather low ratio values.

The ratio of pollen grains versus spores (P:S) has also been used as a proxy for 

distance to the shoreline, given the greater ease with which pollen can be wind or 

water-transported away from their origin (Batten, 1996), but mostly as a proxy for 

palynomorph oxidation. Since spores resist better to oxidation, the ratio P:S tends to 

be higher in environments of rapid sediment accumulation and burial (McCarthy et 

al., 2000). The Graph C in Fig. 24 expresses this ratio (on the ordinate) as a function 

of the top-down succession of productive samples, on the abscissa. With the exception 

of sample B2, pollen predominate over spores in all samples, resulting in ratio values 

above 1. The red line helps detecting a trend for higher values in samples more 

towards the top of the profile, suggestive of higher rates of sediment accumulation 

than those associated with layers lower down in the succession.

One widely used dinocyst-based indicator for assessing primary productivity 

conditions, first documented by Lewis, Dodge, and Powell (1990), is the Peridinioids 

versus Gonyaulacoids ratio (P:G). The inferential basis for the use of this ratio rests 

on taking Peridinioids as a close approximation to heterotrophic dinoflagellate 

species (Pross &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). Evidence for that comes from an analogy with 

the prevailing feeding behaviour of modern Protoperidinioids and from Quaternary 

studies, leading several authors to question its relevance for Cretaceous studies (Dale 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

88

&amp;amp; Fjellså, 1994). Nevertheless, several externally calibrated studies (e.g., using satellite 

data on primary productivity as a criterion) supported the potential usefulness of this 

ratio for productivity reconstruction (e.g., Radi &amp;amp; de Vernal, 2008). The dominance of 

peridinioid cysts in Cenomanian-Turonian assemblages is a common finding (Peyrot 

et al., 2012), and has been linked to several other environmental controls besides 

primary productivity. For instance, the predominance of peridinioids in reduced 

salinity conditions has been contrasted with the predominance of gonyaulacoids and 

gymnodioids in normal marine salinity conditions (Harker, Sargeant, &amp;amp; Caldwell, 

1990). Peridinioids comparative increase in nearshore conditions characterized by 

strong fluctuations in salinity and/or nutrient levels has also been signalled (Peyrot et 

al., 2012). Moreover, peridinioid-dominated assemblages have been correlated with 

colder surface waters (and higher latitudes, Dale, 1985) and gonyauculoid-dominated 

assemblages with warmer surface waters (Wall et al., 1977). Finally, selective destruction 

of peridinioids by oxidation has been demonstrated in laboratory (Marret, 1993, 

Hopkins &amp;amp; McCarthy, 2002) and a reduced occurrence of peridinioids in oxidised 

sediments has been documented (Zonneveld, Hoek, Brinkhuis, &amp;amp; Willems, 2001). 

A decrease in the P:G ratio may thus reflect oxidation related processes such as rate 

of sedimentation, which differentially affect these two groups of cysts. Both the link 

of this ratio to primary productivity and to the rate of sedimentation open up the 

possibility of cautiously using it to estimate a nearshore-offshore gradient, with lower 

values of the ratio indicating more distal environments (de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007).

Graph A in Fig. 25 plots a simple ratio of number of Peridinioids/(number of 

Periodinioids + Gonyaulacoids) expressed as a relative percentage (0 to 100 %) as a 

function of the top-down succession of productive samples. A clear predominance of 

peridinioids is manifest by relative percentages well above 50% in all samples. . Given 

the aforesaid, this overall predominance is in itself suggestive of reduced or variable 

salinity, temperate/cold water, and high productivity associated with nearshore 

conditions (e.g., lagoonal, estuarine or brackish).

A trend for a comparative reduction in the proportion of peridinioids (correlative 

of an augmented proportion of gonyaulacoids) is apparent after M2, i.e., for samples 

collected at lower levels of the stratigraphic columns. Interpreted in light of a distal-

proximal gradient, that would point to closer proximity to land at the top of the 

column, in agreement with the suggestions of the bissacate/other pollen ratio

(graph B in Fig. 25); considered from the standpoint of oxidation processes, to an 

increased rate of sedimentation/burial on the higher layers – in agreement with 

the suggestion of the Pollen/Spores ratio (graph C in Fig. 24). In this context, the 

increase of the terrestrial component in samples from the lower layers suggested by 

the (pollen + spore)/dinocyst ratio (graph A in Fig. 24) appears as either discrepant 

with the remaining indicators or as requiring explanation by factors other than 

higher proximity to land.

Other palynological-based signals have been proposed, namely regarding the 

inshore-offshore gradient, which are not based on quotients and can be used for 

cross-checking the indications arising from palynological ratios. Particularly in the 

case of dinocysts, highly indicative species (with marked preferences for specific 

environments) and assemblages’ composition may afford useful signals, which will 

be dealt with in the following sections. After the Wall et al. (1977) paper, dinocysts 

diversity has come to be recognized in itself as a relevant palaeoenvironmental 

indicator, overall dependent on the stress in ecosystems, which is often related to 

shoreline proximity (Sluijs, Pross, &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2005). Dinocysts diversity has been 

found to typically increase offshore (particularly near the shelf edge, along slope-

rise zones) and to decrease at more proximal settings, particularly in unstable and 

unpredictable (more ecologically stressed) estuarine/coastal habitats (Bradford &amp;amp; Wall, 

1984; Goodman, 1979; Wall et al., 1977). Graph B in Fig. 25 plots a straightforward 

measure of dinocysts diversity (the number of recorded distinct taxa, or species 

richness) as a function of the productive samples ordered from the top towards the 

bottom of the profile. An equivalent measure of diversity was also taken for the 

terrestrial component represented by spores and pollen grains and is additionally 

plotted for comparison (dashed line). The number of distinct dinocyst taxa in each 

sample is overall rather low (always below 15) and thus suggestive of a near shore, 

proximal setting, rather than open marine. In addition, it is quite constant, with only 

very small fluctuations between samples. A similar pattern is apparent for the pollen 

+ spore diversity, with the exception of a somewhat noticeable fall in B2 (extending, 

to a lesser degree, to T4). Pollen + spore richness was always lower than dinocysts

richness.

7.3. CHARACTERIZATION OF DINOCYST ASSEMBLAGES

Subtilisphaera sp. was by far the dominant taxon in all samples, accounting for around 

71 % of the total of recorded dinocysts. Its representation across samples varied from 

a minimum of ? 46 % (sample T4) to a maximum of 88 % (sample B1). The second 
most abundant taxa, at a considerable distance from the third one, was Spinidinium 

sp., accounting for ? 7% of the total number of dinocysts, and with percentages 
across samples varying in between ? 2,5 % (sample B2) and ? 17,5 % (sample T4). 
Spiniferites ramosus was the third most common taxa, with an overall representation 

of ? 3,2%, varying from 0% (in M1 and B3) to ? 15,5% (B4) across samples. The first 
two taxa, both peridinioids, which together account for more than 75 % of the entire 

dinocysts count, were recorded in all samples. 

This pattern of species representation, graphically illustrated by the dinocyst 

percentage diagram in Fig. 26, reflects high dominance assemblages, with an 

overwhelming prevalence of the cosmopolitan species Subtilisphaera sp. An inverse 

relation between dominance and species diversity has been signalled by Goodman 

(1979), such that low dominance-high diversity assemblages reflect more offshore 

conditions and high dominance-low diversity assemblages more inshore conditions. 

The high dominance found in all samples thus converges with the low number of 

dinocysts taxa recorded (low diversity) in signalling an innershore marine setting. 

Moreover, assemblages including only a few dinocyst species and overwhelmingly 

dominated by one single taxon have been particularly associated with ecologically 

restricted nearshore and estuarine (brackish) environments (Li &amp;amp; Habib, 1996; 

McMinn, 1991), with relatively low energy and little water movement, leading to the 

suggestion that this may be the case here.

Relatively small fluctuations of the percentage representation of each taxon across 

samples are apparent in Fig. 26. A comparatively higher peak of Florentinia sp. can be 

seen at B3, of Spiniferites ramosus at B4, of Canningia sp. and Spinidinium sp. at T4, of 

Xiphophoridium alatum at B2 or of Heterosphaeridium sp. at T1sample. These fluctuations 

are associated with some degree of change in the species composition across 

samples and may involve either inverse or direct relations between the percentage 

representation of different species, which will be considered in the following sections. 

Fig. 27 presents the relation across samples between the proportions of 

Subtilisphaera sp., the most abundant peridinioid cyst and the dominant taxon 

overall, and of Spiniferites ramosus, the most abundant gonyaulacoid (and third best 

represented taxon). An overall inverse relation can be noticed, whereby increases in 

the proportion of Spiniferites ramosus (gonyaulacoid) are accompanied by decreases 

in the proportion of Subtilisphaera sp. (peridinioid) and vice versa. A tendency for an 

enlarged representation of Subtilisphaera sp. on samples from higher layers indicates 

an increasing gradient of dominance towards the top of the succession (M2 to T1). 

The ratio between the number of distinct peridinioid and distinct gonyaulacoid 

taxa was also computed for each sample and plotted on the same graph, with values 

on the left ordinate. This ratio allows examining whether the increased dominance 

of Subtilisphaera sp. at samples located higher in the stratigraphical succession goes 

along with an overall pattern favouring the occurrence of higher species richness of 

peridinioids over gonyaulacoids. As shown by the dashed line, this appears to be the 

case, with some trend for larger values of the ratio on the left part of the abscissa. This 

relative increase in species richness of the peridionoids concurs with the increased 

dominance of Subtilisphaera sp. and with the enlarged representation of peridinioids 

as a group (see Fig. 25A) to suggest augmented productivity and/or more reduced or 

variable salinity conditions of the palaeoenvironments associated with layers higher 

up in the succession. 

Pearson correlations computed between all pairs of dinocyst taxa similarly 

indicate that an overall inverse relation between peridinioids and gonyaulacoids 

largely organizes the variation in species composition across samples. Statistically 

significant (at ? ? 0.05, bilateral) negative correlations were found between 
Subtilisphaera sp. (dominant peridinioid) and the gonyaulacoids Spiniferites ramosus 

(r = -0.743), Canningia sp. (r = -0.767), Spiniferites sp. (r = -0.756) and Xenascus 

sp. (r = -0.813). Although they didn’t reach the statistical significance criterion, the 

remaining correlations of Subtilisphaera sp. with other gonyaulacoids (excluding those 

occurring in less than three samples) were also negative, with two exceptions (r ? 0 
for Xenascus ceratioides and r = 0.373 for Heterosphaeridium sp.).

right vertical axis. Dashed line: ratio of the number of Peridinioids taxa (Peridinioids species richness) to 
the number of Gonyaulacoids taxa (Gonyaulacoids species richness) across samples. Values should be read

Only one significant correlation, negative in sign, r = -0.774, was found between 

Subtilisphaera sp. and any of the other peridinioid cysts, involving Spinidinium sp., 

the second most ubiquitous and abundant taxon overall. Under the reservation that 

they were not statistically significant, negative correlations also occurred between 

Subtilisphaera sp. and Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides, r = -0.427, and Epelidosphaeridia 

spinosa, r = -0.140.These negative correlations may cautiously be taken to suggest 

a competitive relationship between the dominant Subtilisphaera sp. and some of the 

other peridinioid species. Positive non-significant correlations emerged in turn with 

Trithyrodinium suspectum, r = 0.373, and Trithyrodinium sp., r = 0.171 (because it only 

occurred in one sample, Palaeohystrichophora sp., was not considered). No significant 

correlations between peridinioid taxa other than the one involving Subtilisphaera 

sp. and Spinidinium sp. were found. All significant correlations found between 

gonyaulacoid species (6 correlations, after discarding species occurring in less than 

3 samples) were positive, indicating that their percentage representations tended to

95

increase or decrease as a block. A significant negative correlation, r = -0.691, occurred 

between the gonyaulacoid Heterosphaeridium sp. and the peridinioid Epelidosphaeridia 

spinosa.

Another look at the distribution of dinocysts across samples is provided in Table 

4, which classifies each taxon in terms of abundance (percentage of the total count of 

palynomporphs in each sample). Three classification categories were used, following 

the terminology and percentage criteria offered in Balme (1970): rare, for percentages 

&amp;lt;1%; common, for percentages from 1.1 to 10%; abundant, for percentages &gt; 10%.

The absence of several golyaulacoid taxa in T1, M1, B1 samples (e.g., Canningia 

sp., Florentinia mantellii, Spiniferites sp., Xenascus sp., Xiphophoridium alatum) reflects 

the signalled reduction in species richness of the gonyaulavoids in samples higher 

up in the succession (lowest values, of 2 and 4 taxa out of 13, occur at M1 and B1 

respectively, and highest ones, of 10 and 7 taxa, occur at B2 and T4 respectively). 

Periodinioid taxa, in turn, have their highest species richness in T1 and M1, with 

6 out of 7 taxa present). Using the rare (R) category to characterize dominance in 

dinocysts associations, the highest percentage of rare taxa, indexing higher dominance, 

occurs at T1 (58%) and the third highest value at M1 (37.5%), samples located higher 

in the stratigraphic succession. Considering now the abundant (A) and common (C) 

categories to characterize the prevalent species association, Subtilisphaera sp. (abundant 

in all samples), Spinidinium sp. (abundant in one sample and common in every other), 

Spiniferites ramosus (common in all seven samples where it occurs), Xenascus ceratioides 

(common in five out of seven samples where it occurs) and Florentinia sp. (common in 

five out of six samples where it occurs), appear as the most widely shared taxa across 

samples. Commonly represented in four out of seven and four out of five samples, 

respectively, the peridinioids Epelidosphaeridia spinosa and Trithyrodinium suspectum are 

also fairly transversal across assemblages.

Table 4 – Stratigraphic distribution of dinocysts. Occurrences in each sample are 

classified as R-Rare (&amp;lt;1%), C-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and A-Abundant (&gt; 10%) 

(Balme, 1970).

Canningia sp. and Spiniferites sp. contribute specifically to assemblages recorded in 

samples lower down in the section (B3, M3, B4, T4), where they are always common. 

They seldom co-occur with Heteosphaeridium sp. and Trithyrodinium sp., which are 

restricted to higher-up samples (in between B2 and T1), the former being common 

in three out of three samples, and the latter common and abundant, respectively, in 

two out of five samples). Xiphophoridium alatum and Xenascus sp. only occur at lower 

to middle samples in the section, the former being restricted to T4 (where it is 

common) and B2 (where it becomes abundant), and the latter occurring commonly 

in samples B4, T4 and B2. These taxa with occurrences restricted to distinct sample 

ranges suggest that, in addition to a widely shared basic association comprising six or 

seven taxa, some degree of differentiation may be established between assemblages 

more towards the lower and more towards the upper parts of the succession.

The environmental preferences of dinocysts taxa have been recognized as 

important palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological indicators. Despite the fact that 

many of the recorded species in this study are cosmopolitan and may be qualified as 

opportunistic, as is typical of most dinocysts assemblages (Wall et al., 1977), remaining

differences in the degree of tolerance to variations in trophic, salinity or water depth 

conditions may still afford a basis for palaeoenvironmental inferences. As previously 

noticed, strong peridinioid dominance is a common finding in Cenomanian-Turonian 

assemblages (Peyrot, 2012), generally accepted as a signal of increased nutrient supply 

and/or reduced salinity under nearshore conditions (Wall et al., 1977; Lewis et al., 

1990). However, while Palaeohystricophora infusorioides has currently emerged in those 

assemblages as the dominant cyst (Lignum, 2009; Pearce et al., 2009; Peyrot et al., 

2011; Peyrot et al., 2012), Subtilisphaera sp. is way far dominant in the present case. 

This difference plausibly reflects differences in ecological preferences, and may thus 

help highlighting characteristic features of the palaeoenvironment associated with 

the studied succession.

Affinities of Subtilisphaera sp. to salt marshy, intertidal (Skupien &amp;amp; Vacísec, 2002), 

deltaic (Carvalho, Bengtson, &amp;amp; Lana., 2016), estuarine and lagoonal low salinity 

environments (Jain &amp;amp; Millepied, 1975) have been suggested. Its strong dominance 

in unstable estuarine (Pedrão &amp;amp; Lana, 2000) and lagoonal (Ji, Meng, Yan, &amp;amp; Song, 

2011) settings supports moreover a marked euryhaline character, allowing for rapid 

opportunistic proliferation at the onset of marine transgressions (Pedrão &amp;amp; Lana, 

2000). Palaeohystricophora infusorioides has in turn been interpreted to show outer 

neritic, open marine affinities, with a predominance at offshore upwelling sites 

with high primary productivity (Pearce et al., 2009; Peyrot, 2011; Skupien, 2007). 

Despite some tolerance for reduced salinity, which may account for its documented 

occurrence at nearshore environments (Habib &amp;amp; Miller, 1989), it displays a preference 

for close to normal salinity condition (Lignum, 2009). The overwhelming dominance 

of Subtilisphaera sp. in the present assemblages may thus be taken to suggest a restricted 

shallow marine to brackish environment, with either considerably reduced or variable 

salinity conditions. Its increased dominance at samples upward in the succession 

may additionally suggest a reinforcement of these conditions towards the top of the 

stratigraphic profile (i.e., an increasingly restricted, less open marine sedimentation 

environment).

This interpretation is overall consistent with the ubiquitous occurrence of 

Spinidinium sp., the second most abundant recorded taxon, which displays a preference 

for marginal marine environments (Sluijs, Brinkhuis, Williams, &amp;amp; Fensome, 2009; 

Willumsen &amp;amp; Vajda, 2010) and low salinity conditions, including those associated 

with fluvial freshwater input (Sluijs &amp;amp; Brinkhuis, 2009). Several other taxa in the 

assemblages exhibit akin tendencies: 

- Xenascus ceratioides, whose relationship with restricted shallow marine (Tocher &amp;amp; 

Jarvis, 1987; Skupien &amp;amp; Mohammed, 2008) and low to varying salinity settings 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

98

(Lister &amp;amp; Batten, 1988; Wilpshaar &amp;amp; Leereveld, 1994) appears well established; 

- Trithyrodinum sp. and Trithyrodinium suspectum, typical occurrences of nearshore 

shallow marine environments with a sizeable terrestrial influx (Skupien &amp;amp; 

Mohammed, 2008) and often associated with marginal marine dinocysts genera, 

such as Spinidinium (Willumsen &amp;amp; Vajda, 2010); 

- Canningia sp. and Canningia reticulata which, within a general inner neritic propensity, 

have been related to lagoonal and restricted marine (Hunt, 1987; Peyrot, 2011, 

Skupien, 2007) varying salinity environments (Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 2003; Skupien, 

2007), though with a preference for hiposaline waters (Lignum, 2009); 

- Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum, considered to be a euryhaline species with an affinity 

to reduced salinity nearshore environments (Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 2003; Lebedeva, 

2010; Lignum, 2009). 

Although not much seems to be known about the palaeoecological preferences 

of Impletoshphaeridium spp., except for an affinity to cold waters (Warny, Anderson, 

Londeix, &amp;amp; Bart, 2007), its recorded occurrence at a restricted infralittoral neritic 

marine environment (Borges, Riding, Fernandes, Matos, &amp;amp; Pereira, 2012) may be 

taken to suggest a propensity for nearshore shallow waters. Together with Subtilisphaera 

sp. and Spininidum sp. these taxa make up to 86 % of the total count of dinocysts.

Some of the other recorded taxa testify for distinct, open marine affinities. The 

stenohaline Epelidosphaeridia spinosa is widely regarded as a marker of offshore/

oceanic environments (Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 2003; Lignum, 2009); Florentia spp., in 

particular Florentinia mantellii, exhibit middle to outer-shelf affinities, with a leaning 

for outer environments (Omran, Soliman, &amp;amp; Mahmoud, 1990; Pearce, 2000; Peyrot et 

al., 2011); the cosmopolitan Heterosphaeridium sp. has been credited with full marine 

affinities (Ellegaard, Lundholm, Ribeiro, Ekelund, &amp;amp; Andersen, 2008), preferential 

distribution in the inner to middle-shelf and a propensity for close to normal, slightly 

reduced salinity (Lignum, 2009). As mentioned above, Palaeohystricophora infusorioides 

also reveals outer neritic preferences, being often considered a marker of offshore 

upwelling zones (Pearce, 2000; Lignum. 2009, Peyrot et al., 2011). The cosmopolitan 

species Spiniferites ramosus, corresponding to the most overall abundant gonyaulacoid 

(about 3% of the total dinocysts count), represents a special case. Despite recognized 

outer neritic affinities (Lignum, 2009, Mao &amp;amp; Lamolda, 1998, 1999; Peyrot, 2011), it 

displays broad tolerance to variations in primary productivity (from oligotrophic to 

eutrophic conditions), permanent or seasonal (e.g., due to river discharges) reductions 

in water salinity and water temperature changes (Zonneveld et al., 2013), and 

can thus be found in a wide range of habitats, including nearshore shallow-water 

environments (Carvalho et al., 2016). Finally, Xiphophoridium alatum has shown no

99

palaeoenvironmental preferences as regards salinity or water-depth (Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 

2003). 

Taken altogether, the overall composition of the assemblages is thus suggestive 

of a low salinity, possibly brackish setting, involving restricted shallow conditions 

consistent with lagoonal and/or tidal flat environments. The very low number of taxa 

presenting open marine, particularly outer neritic and oceanic affinities (4), and the 

scarcity of their percentage representation (excluding Spiniferites ramosus, due to its 

wide range of habitats, they account for about 6% of the total dinocysts sum) indicates 

a moderate degree of exposure to open marine influxes, possibly due to restricted 

(e.g., by barriers) tidal influx. The interpretation given above of the increasing 

dominance of Subtilisphaera sp. in samples higher up in the succession as a possible 

indication of a reinforcement of these palaeoenvironmental characteristics is to some 

extent supported by an upward increase in the representation of Xenascus ceratioides, 

Trithyrodinium suspectum, Trithyrodinum sp., Canningia reticulata and Oligosphaeridium 

pulcherrimum, and a better representation of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides, Florentinia 

mantellii and Spiniferites sp. at samples lower down in the succession (B3 to T4 or to 

B2), although the increased representation of Canningia sp. at samples lower in the 

succession would not be expected under this scenario (see Table 4).

Assemblages reflect a predominant Tethyan influence, signalled by the occurrence, 

among some of the best represented taxa, of species with a recognized Tethyan affinity, 

such as Subtilishphaera sp. (Arai, Neto, Lana, &amp;amp; Pedrão, 2000; Arai, 2014), Spinifirites spp. 

(Carvalho et al., 2016), Florentinia spp. (Skupien &amp;amp; Vasicek, 2002), Xenascus ceratioides 

(Masure, Aumar, &amp;amp; Vrielynck, 2013). Only of few taxa exhibit high latitude affinities, 

such as Xiphophoridium alatum (Williams et al., 2004), which nevertheless presents 

a cosmopolitan distribution (Masure et al., 2013). In accordance with the lack of 

typically Temperate or Boreal species, several taxa exhibit preferences for warm water, 

such as Trithyrodinium suspectum (Willumsen &amp;amp; Vajda 2010), Spiniferites sp. (Prauss, 

2002), Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum and Palaeohystricophora infusorioides (Uwins &amp;amp; 

Batten, 1988). Impletospheridium sp. and Heterosphaeridium sp. appear in turn to prefer 

cooler water temperatures (Arai, 2007; Warny et. al, 2007). The absence of Spiniferites 

sp. and the decreased representation of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides, two taxa with 

a specific affinity for well oxygenated waters (Courtinat &amp;amp; Shaaf, 1990), at samples 

higher up in the succession, might signal upward decreasing oxygenation in the 

associated palaeoenvironmental. All in all, the most important palaeoenvironmental 

controls for the species composition of the assemblages and namely the overwhelming 

dominance of Subtilisphaera sp., seem to be nutrient availability under a restricted 

shallow water environment with reduced (and eventually varying) salinity.

7.4. CHARACTERIZATION OF OTHER PALYNOMORPHS 

ASSEMBLAGES

Table 5 provides a classification of sporomorphs, algae, microforaminiferal linings and 

acritarchs in terms of abundance (percentage of the total count of palynomorphs in 

the sample), based on the same criteria used above for dinocysts: R-Rare (&amp;lt;1%), 

C-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and Abundant-A (&gt; 10%). 

Table 5 – Stratigraphic distribution of spores, pollen, algae, foraminifera and acritarchs. 

R-Rare (&amp;lt;1%), C-Common (1.1 - 10 %) and Abundant-A (&gt; 10%).

Spores: the pteridophyte spore Pattelasporites sp., commonly found in several 

landscapes from the mid-Cretaceous Iberian Peninsula (Hasenboehler, 1981; 

Villanueva-Amadoz, 2009), was the only ubiquitous taxa across samples and also the 

most abundant, being common in all samples except T1 (where it becomes rare). 

It is followed by the also pteridophyte spore Cicatricosisporites sp., already recorded 

in the Cretaceous of Portugal (Rey, 1972), which can be found in many diverse 

environments, from marine to lagoonal and terrestrial (see: Fossilworks: Gateway to the 

Paleobiology Database, accessible at http://www.fossilworks.org/). Combined with the 

much larger representation of pollen grains versus spores (see Fig. 24C), the strong 

predominance of spores of pteridophytes, and the absence of bryophytes spores 

(more dependent on water for their reproduction) may signal a moderately humid 

palaeoclimate (Villanueva-Amadoz, Sender, Diez, Ferrer, &amp;amp; Pons, 2011).

Spores Pollen Algae



Presentation, Analysis and Discussion of results

101

Pollen grains: Gymnosperm pollen grains, particularly of the conyphera type,  

predominate, with Classopollis spp. (especially Classopollis brasilliensis) as the 

most ubiquitous and abundant. Alisporites is the only bisaccate pollen, much less 

represented than other pollen types (see also Fig. 24B), suggesting a low influence 

of transportation and a deposition close to the production site of the pollen grains. 

Classopolis-dominated assemblages have been interpreted as corresponding to coastal 

vegetation (Peyrot et al., 2011). A similar association of conifer pollen, predominantly 

Classopollis, with spores of pterydophytes, chiefly Pattelasporites, has been reported 

for the Lower Cretaceous of the Lusitanian Basin (Mendes, Dinis, &amp;amp; Pais, 2014), 

and interpreted to indicate a warm, seasonally dry climate. This would agree, in the 

present case, with the tangentially rare representation of Afropollis, the only recorded 

type of angiosperms pollen, possibly associated with humid tropical climates (Doyle, 

Jardiné, &amp;amp; Doerenkam, 1982). 

Algae: Among the recorded taxa of marine algae, Leiosphaeridia sp. (recorded at 

B1 and B2 samples) and Pterospmella sp. (recorded at B4) have been well correlated 

with shallowing phases in Jurassic studies (Tahoun &amp;amp; Mohamed, 2014), suggesting 

an overall shallow environment. The most abundant type, with common occurrence 

higher up in the succession (M2 and B1) is Botryoccocus sp., a fresh-water/brackish 

alga (Guiry &amp;amp; Guiry, 2017; El Beialy, El Afty, Zavada, &amp;amp; Khoriby, 2010). Besides an 

overall indication of reduced salinity, possibly corresponding to a fluvial influence on 

the palaeoenvironment, its common occurrence higher up in the profile may indicate 

a reduction in salinity upwards. The prevalence of salinity reduced conditions is also 

supported by the presence of the other, prasynophyte-type algae, which typically 

signal lower salinity of surface waters and exhibit a preference for lagoonal to brackish 

environments (Skupien &amp;amp; Vasicek, 2002).

Microforaminiferal linings: Several studies have shown an increase in microforaminiferal 

linings in shallower waters (Melia, 1984; Powell, Dodge, &amp;amp; Lewis, 1990), allowing to 

interpret the common to abundant occurrence of microforaminifera across samples 

(with the single exception of T4, where no microforaminifera linings were recorded) 

as an indication of an overall shallow water palaeoenvironment. No particular 

shallowing trend upwards in the succession is suggested. 

Taken overall, the study of the assemblages of palynomorphs other than 

dinocysts concurs with the same general indications of a shallow water nearshore 

palaeoenvironment with reduced salinity, possibly of a lagoonal/brackish type and 

allowing for some contribution of river freshwater input.

7.5. DINOCYSTS-BASED BIOSTRATIGRAPHY

The usefulness of dinocysts as biostratigraphic markers is highly dependent on the 

occurrence of biostratigraphically relevant species/genera, that is, taxa with a narrow 

chronostratigraphical range in between their first occurrence (FO) and their last 

occurrence (LO), allowing thereby for low resolution correlation. This was not the 

case of the studied assemblages, which individually do not add diagnostic value as 

regards the proposed age of the succession from late early Cenomanian to early 

middle Cenomanian on the basis of foraminifera, benthic faunas of invertebrates, 

and even ammonoid and vertebrate assemblages (e. g. Berthou, 1973, 1984; Berthou, 

Soares, &amp;amp; Lauverjat, 1979; Lauverjat, 1982; Callapez, 1998, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014). 

Fig. 28 illustrates the range of the recorded dinocysts taxa across samples with 

reference to the geological time scale (Gradstein et al., 2012) (28A) and to the first 

(arrow with up bar) and/or last (arrow with down bar) occurrence of four taxa 

documented in this study and figuring among those selected in Williams et al. (2004) 

as of biostratigraphic interest to the Cenomanian (28B).

mid-latitudes.

The correspondence between the stratigraphic column and the geological time 

scale in Fig. 28A was obtained through the alignment of the LEP/B discontinuity 

with the proposed onset of middle Cenomanian in Williams et al. (2004). Fig. 28B 

reproduces the FO an LO established in Williams et al. (2004) for the selected 

dinocysts taxa in the Cenomanian, affording thereby a comparative basis for possible 

biostratigraphic inferences.

Following Williams et al. (2004), Xiphophoridium alatum has its FO in the lower 

Cenomanian. In the present study it occurs for the first time in sample T4, where it is 

common. This may thus be taken to mean that, from sample T4 upward, the age of the 

succession cannot be inferior than the lower Cenomanian (which is consistent with 

a middle Cenomanian age, but does not add an independent calibration index to the 

existing ones). The Albian FO of Palaeohystricophora infusorioides and of Epelidosphaeridia 

spinosa (following William’s et al., 2004) has even lesser biostratigraphical value: given 

that both taxa have their FO in the lowermost sample of the studied stratigraphical 

succession (B3), they may only indicate that the entire succession is postearly than 

Albian age. The LO of Epelidosphaeridia spinosa at the end of upper Cenomanian, still 

below the Cenomanian-Turonian transition (following Williams et al., 2004), provides

a too coarse upper age limit for the studied succession, as its documented LO happens 

at the uppermost sample (T1). The possible inference is that the succession age is 

pre-Turonian (which, again, is consistent with the middle Cenomanian age already 

proposed, but does not afford any new specific calibration index to this datation). 

The common occurrence of Trithyrodinium suspectum in several of the samples of 

the stratigraphic column, including the lowermost (B3) and uppermost (T1) ones, 

is a particular case. According to William et al. (2004), Trithyrodinium suspectum FO 

is referred to the middle of the upper Cenomanian (an indication already afforded 

in Williams &amp;amp; Bujak, 1985). The possible inference would then be that the studied 

succession is at least of upper Cenomanian age. In conclusion, the Nazaré section 

provided an age of middle upper Cenomanian to latest Cenomanian based on 

dinoflagellates cysts (Fig. 28B).

This result suggests an upper age for the Nazaré section than the robust middle 

Cenomanian age provided by numerous other micro and macro biostratigraphic 

markers (Callapez, 1998; Callapez et al., 2014). Additional palynostratigraphic sampling 

in the studied section could provide additional relevant data, and eventually support 

the need for a revision of the FO of Trithyrodinium suspectum in Late Cretaceous in 

Iberia (while recognizing that no further evidence in the literature points in that 

direction).

7.6. COMPARISON WITH OTHER CRETACEOUS DINOCYSTS 

ASSEMBLAGES

Most studies of Upper Cretaceous dinocysts concern the upper Cenomanian and 

particularly the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary, given its association with the 

major biotic event known as OAE 2 or Bonarelli Event (Hart et al., 2005; Pearce 

et al., 2009; Barroso-Barcenilla et al., 2011). Comparisons of the found dinocysts 

assemblages with coeval assemblages obtained in other studies (either specifically 

addressing or encompassing the late early and middle Cenomanian) in the same or 

distinct palaeogeographical realms are thus met with limited opportunities. 

Two earlier studies conducted in Portugal which allow a comparison with the 

present one are those of Berthou et al. (1980) and Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler (1982). 

They both investigate the Albian and Cenomanian dinocysts associations in the region 

of Lisbon (south of Nazaré) and distinguish furthermore between the early, middle 

and late Cenomanian stage. Besides the indication that dinocysts are considerably 



Presentation, Analysis and Discussion of results

105

more abundant in the Albian than in the Cenomanian in the studied region, Berthou 

et al. (1980) report that dinocysts occurrences were rare in both the early and middle 

Cenomanian, with Trichodinium castaneum as the single identified species. These 

findings diverge from those in the present study, where diverse and relatively well 

represented dinocyst taxa were found in samples corresponding in all likelihood to 

the middle Cenomanian, though not the very single taxa identified by Berthou et al. 

(1980) for this time interval (Trichodinium castaneum). This discrepancy might signal 

coeval diverging local sedimentological and palaeoenvironmental conditions at the 

Lisbon and Nazaré sectors. 

The study of Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler (1982) has provided a much larger 

diversity of taxa occurring during the early and middle Cenomanian (32 taxa ranging 

in the early and middle Cenomanian, although virtually all of them shared with 

Albian substages and many of them with the late Cenomanian one). A comparative 

summary of Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler’s (1982) reported taxa is given in Table 6 

(middle column). All taxa shared with the present study are represented in bold: 

dominant taxa in a given Cenomanian substage and do not occurring in any other 

substages are additionally reported and signalled with two asterisks (**), and taxa 

ceasing to occur after a given substage are marked with an asterisk (*). Taxa within 

brackets ([ ]) are not of interest for the current comparison.

Nine of the 20 dinocysts taxa identified in the present study (i.e., 45%) were also 

reported in Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler (1982). However, rather than being specific to 

one stage, they largely spread across the three Cenomanian substages. While all occurred 

at the middle Cenomanian, seven were also reported in the early Cenomanian and 

three in the late Cenomanian. With the exception of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides 

identified only in the Cenomanian (across all substages), all other taxa also range 

across several Albian substages. Nevertheless, five of these shared taxa did not occur 

after the middle Cenomanian (taxa in bold followed by an asterisk), suggesting that 

the presently studied succession is bellow the basal upper Cenomanian, as already 

comproved by other taxonomic groups. 

However, no indications in the relevant literature support a key biostratigraphical 

value of these particular taxa, excepting Epelidosphaeridia spinosa for the whole 

Cenomanian (Williams &amp;amp; Bujak, 1985; Williams et al., 2004). Concerning 

Epelidosphaeridia spinosa, its last occurrence is located by Williams et al. (2004) in late, 

not middle Cenomanian, which attributes it a diagnostic value as a pre-Turonian 

species, but not as regards a distinction between Cenomanian substages.

Presentation, Analysis and Discussion of results

107

One general indication of the Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler’s (1982) study, explicitly 

allowed by the authors (p. 761) and finally convergent with Berthou et al. (1980) 

and with the results of the present study is that, as far as the lower, midlle and upper 

Cenomanian are concerned, dinocyst-based studies do not seem to add significantly 

to the biostratigraphic precisions in the studied regions. However, this does note 

mean that they cannot be useful for integrated biostratigraphic purposes with other 

taxonomic groups.

Another relevant indication supported by the fact that 65 % of the taxa in the 

current study, among which the dominant and the second most abundant genera, 

were absent from Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler’s (1982) samples, is that, again, coeval 

palaeoenvironmental conditions at the Lisbon and Nazaré regions were very 

likely divergent. This suggests that, in contrast to their seemingly reduced value 

for biostratigraphical purposes in the Cenomanian (at least in the studied settings 

of the WPCP), dinocyst-based studies may be important sources in assessing 

palaeoenvironmental conditions and palaeoecological communities, and differences 

among coeval distinct palaeogeographical regions.

In the left column of Table 6, a summary comparison with the findings of three 

dinocysts studies conducted at different sites of the Castilian Platform, Northern-

Central Spain (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011, and Peyrot et al., 2012) is presented. 

Although these studies were concerned with late Cenomanian-early Turonian 

stratigraphic intervals, not equivalent thus to the proposed late early-middle 

Cenomanian interval addressed in the current study, they still afford interesting 

possibilities for comparison. During the Late Cretaceous, the Iberian Subplate shared 

general tectonic, latitudinal, palaeogeographical and eustatic sea-level influences 

(Peyrot et al., 2012; Segura et al., 2014), which might reflect in some general affinities 

between dinocysts assemblages. In addition, the three Spanish studies involve 

distinct outcrop sections corresponding to an outer shelf to coastal and terrestrial 

transect (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011), opening the possibility for assemblages’ 

comparisons across distinct palaeoenvironmental settings. Finally, assessing the extent 

to which taxa identified in the present study occur (or not) in the upper Cenomanian 

successions of settings with an overall akin palaeogeographic location (between the 

Tethyan and the Boreal Realms) affords additional means to evaluate the specificity 

of the recorded assemblages. 

Despite differences in assemblage’s diversities and composition, interpreted by the 

authors as expressing mainly the distal-proximal gradient, a transversal predominance 

of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus was found in all Spanish 

studies (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011; Peyrot et al., 2012). This concurs with a

108

common dominance of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides during the middle and 

late Cenomanian in most NW areas (Lignum, 2009), very often associated with 

Spiniferites ramosus, leading to the recognition of an Upper Cretaceous “Spiniferites-

Palaeohystrichophora (S-P) Assemblage” (Prince, Jarvis, &amp;amp; Tocher, 1999), expressing 

eutrophic conditions of the middle shelf. As shown in Table 6 (left column), eight 

of the 20 taxa recorded in the present study (i.e., 40%) are represented in the late 

Cenomanian-early Turonian assemblages of the Castilian Platform (taxa in bold), 

with four of them among the six most abundant taxa in the Spanish studies (ordered 

by abundance and accounting for more than 75% of the total count). Conversely, 

60% of the taxa in the present study are absent in the Castillian Platform assemblages, 

among which the largely dominant Subtilisphaera sp. and the second most ubiquitous 

and abundant taxon Spinidinium sp., expressing a rather different species composition 

(and namely, an important divergence as regards the P-S assemblage, which seems to 

provide the basic association in the Spanish samples). Given the interpretation of the 

P-S assemblage as a marker of eutrophic middle-shelf environments, the contrasting 

dominance of Subtilisphaera sp. in the present study, with reported affinities to restricted 

marginal low salinity environments, should be taken as a clear signal of a local 

palaeoenvironmental divergence. All three Spanish studies have used the dinocysts 

assemblages for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological inferences, but only one 

examined their value as biostratigraphic markers in the concerned stratigraphic 

interval (Peyrot, 2011), with limited results given by the absence of reliable late 

Cenomanian-early Turonian markers in the samples (p. 269). Of particularly interest 

to the present study, none of the potentially useful biostratigraphical indications 

reported seems able to provide a distinctive signal of the late Cenomanian substage 

(i.e., simultaneously excluding earlier Cenomanian substages and the later Turonian 

age). These results appear to generalize the suggestion that Cenomanian dinocysts 

are much less useful for improving the resolution of stratigraphic datations than for 

palaeoenvironment reconstructions.

Finally, a last set of studies of Cenomanian dinocyst assemblages used for comparison 

were provided in Lignum (2009). These studies concern seven Cenomanian sections 

from NW Europe (Culver Cliff and Folkestone, UK, Vergons and Pont d’Issole, 

SE France, and Wunstorf, Ratssteinbruch and Gröbern, Northern Germany), 

selected so as to represent a Boreal–Tethyan transect (North Boreal represented by 

the German series, South Boreal by the UK sections, and Tethyan by the French 

sections) and a range of palaeoenvironments, namely as regards seawater depth. The 

Cenomanian interval being their proposed focus, most include samples taken from 

the standard European ammonite zones of Mantelliceras dixoni, corresponding to the

109

upper lower Cenomanian, and Acanthoceras rothomagense and Acanthoceras jukesbrownei, 

corresponding respectively to the lower and upper middle Cenomanian (Kennedy &amp;amp; 

Gale, 2006). These zones, particularly the Acanthoceras rothomagense one, offer a close 

stratigraphical equivalent to the beds with Pterocera incerta, or level B sensu Choffat 

(Callapez, 1998), from which the succession in the present study was selected, meaning 

that comparisons can be made with coeval assemblages. 

Again, despite variations in species composition of the assemblages, 

Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus (followed by Chlamydophorella 

nyei) predominated in most of the samples, with an increased representation of 

Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides during the early to early middle Cenomanian at 

several locations (Anglo-Paris, Vocontian and Lower Saxony basins), interpreted as 

the effect of increased nutrients supply to shelf areas (Lignum, 2009). In addition 

to P. infusorioides and Spiniferites ramosus, a few more taxa (Epelidosphaeridium spinosa, 

Florentinia sp., Heterosphaeridium, Xenascus ceratioides) were shared by Lignum’s (2009) 

assemblages and those of the present study, which nevertheless differed greatly in 

composition from the former, both in terms of the recorded taxa and of the distinctive 

dominance of Suptilisphaera sp. and the significant proportion of Spinidinium sp.. As 

before, these differences are consistent with a specific local palaeoenvironment of the 

Nazaré’s sector during the upper early-middle Cenomanian, departing from the inner 

to outer-shelf open marine environments represented in Lignum’s (2009) samples. 

While the chief palaeoenvironmental controls of Cenomanian dinocysts assemblages 

appear to be sea-level, relative water depth and nutrient availability (Lignum, 2009), 

markedly reduced and/or variable salinity in a restricted shallow setting may have 

contributed an important additional control to the mid-Cenomanian assemblages in 

the Nazaré sector.

As reported by Lignum (2009), the most significant changes in dinocysts 

assemblages occurred at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, and cannot improve 

as such the resolution of Cenomanian substages (Lignum, 2009). Last occurrences of 

two species in the Acanthoceras rhotomagense standard ammonite Zone (Endoceratium 

dettmanniae and Impagidinium crassimuratum subsp., none of them recorded in the 

present study) were documented, but remain of doubtful significance as useful mid-

Cenomanian markers (Lignum, 2009). These results accord with and generalize the 

indications from the present study that Cenomanian dinocyst-based studies afford a 

valuable path for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological reconstructions, but not 

so much for additional biostratigraphical calibrations.

This dissertation was aimed at providing an integrated stratigraphic and palynological 

study, with a particular focus on organic-walled dinocysts sampled from an upper 

lower-lower middle Cenomanian section located near the base of the carbonated 

succession exposed on the south face of the Nazaré promontory. This section comprises 

a partial record of the “Bellasian” stratigraphic units with Ilymatogyra pseudafricana and 

Harpagodes incertus (Callapez, 1998) (= “Level with Exogyra pseudafricana” and “Level 

with Pterocera incerta” sensu Choffat, 1900; Berthou, 1973; Rey, 1979). Except for the 

analysis of two samples collected by Moron (1981) at the detrital series beneath the 

first carbonate units, no other dinocysts studies have been conducted specifically at 

the site of Nazaré, to the best of our knowledge.

8.1. PALAEOENVIRONMENTAL AND PALAEOECOLOGICAL 

IMPLICATIONS

Drawing on the recognized potential of dinoflagellates cysts as palaeoenvirnommental 

tracers (de Vernal &amp;amp; Marret, 2007; de Vernal &amp;amp; Rochon, 2011; Rochon, Eynaud, 

&amp;amp; de Vernal, 2008), one of the study’s purported goals was to contribute to a 

palaeogeographic reconstruction of the Nazaré sector during the early-middle 

Cenomanian. This particular section has been previously interpreted, based on 

the sedimentary facies and an extensive analysis of (mostly) macro invertebrate and

vertebrate faunas, as reflecting a transition from an inner-shelf carbonate platform 

(uppermost lower Cenomanian) to a more restricted lagoonal environment (basal 

middle Cenomanian) yielding benthic palaeocommunities dominated by the 

oyster Gyrostrea ouremensis (Callapez, 1998, 2004, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014). An 

interesting prospect in this context is thus assessing the convergence of microbiotic 

data brought about by the study of dinocysts assemblages with the proposed regional 

palaeogeographic scheme (Callapez et al., 2014), and whether further constraints to 

palaeoenvironmental interpretations can be obtained thereby.

Three structural features of the recorded dinocysts assemblages were: (1) high 

dominance, (2) low species diversity, and (3) a clear predominance of peridinioids 

over gonyaulacoids (with Subtilisphaera sp. alone representing over 70% of the total 

dinocysts count). As previously signaled, high dominance-low diversity assemblages 

are a common indicator of proximal innershore conditions (Goodman, 1979), with 

strong domination by one single taxon, as is the case here, often related to restricted 

nearshore and estuarine (brackish) low energy environments (Bradford &amp;amp; Wall, 1984; 

Li &amp;amp; Habib, 1996; McMinn, 1991). Dominance of peridinioid cysts, on the other 

hand, is an accepted proxy for reduced/variable salinity under nearshore conditions 

(Harker et al., 1990) and/or abundant nutrient supply associated with upwelling zones 

or with enriched terrestrial input (Lewis et al., 1990; Peyrot at al., 2012; Wall et al., 

1977). All mentioned structural features thus converge in pointing towards a markedly 

nearshore, rather restricted, variable to low-saline, possibly brackish, environment 

with a rich nutrient supply, plausibly of terrestrial origin. This palaeoenvironment 

was in connection both with a large littoral/alluvial plain placed eastward, and the 

inner shelf sectors of a growing carbonate platform (Callapez, 2008).

The environmental preferences of the species/genera identified in the 

assemblages supported these indications and added further details. Diverging from 

the Spiniferites-Palaeohystrichophora (S-P) Assemblage (Prince et al., 1999), predominant 

during middle-late Cenomanian times in Northwest Europe and reflecting middle to 

outer shelf eutrophic conditions, the by far dominant cyst was the strongly euryhaline 

Subtilisphaeara sp., with reported affinities to restricted marine environments, 

including salt marshy, intertidal, deltaic, estuarine and lagoonal habitats (Carvalho 

et al., 2016; Jain &amp;amp; Millepied, 1975; Ji et al., 2011; Pedrão &amp;amp; Lana, 2000; Skupien &amp;amp; 

Vacísec, 2002). Consistent with this fact, specific preferences for marginal marine low 

salinity conditions, namely those associated with fluvial freshwater inflow, have been 

attributed to the ubiquitous and second most abundant taxon, Spinidinium sp. (Sluijs &amp;amp; 

Brinkhuis, 2009; Sluijs et al., 2009; Willumsen &amp;amp; Vajda, 2010). Among the remaining 

taxa, several display an akin propensity towards restricted environments of low to

varying salinities, along with documented occurrences in diverse marginal marine 

and lagoonal habitats: Xenascus ceratoides, Oligosphaeridium pulcherrimum, Trithyrodinium 

suspectum and Trithyrodinum sp., Canningia sp. and C. reticulata, Impletoshphaeridium spp. 

(Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 2003; Hunt, 1987; Lebedeva, 2010; Lignum, 2009; Lister &amp;amp; Batten, 

1988; Peyrot et al., 2011; Skupien, 2007; Skupien &amp;amp; Mohammed, 2008; Tocher &amp;amp; Jarvis, 

1987; Warny et al., 2007; Willumsen &amp;amp; Vajda, 2010; Wilpshaar &amp;amp; Leereveld, 1994). The 

reduced representation (? 6%) of stenohaline taxa with open marine, and specifically 
outer neritic/oceanic, affinities (Epelidosphaeridia spinosa, Florentinia sp., F. mantellii, 

Palaeohystricophora infusorioides: see Harris &amp;amp; Tocher, 2003; Lignum, 2009; Omran et 

al., 1990; Pearce, 2000; Peyrot et al., 2011) accords with the preceding indications of 

a shallow nearshore palaeoenvironment, while simultaneously documenting some 

moderate degree of exposure to open marine influences, consistent with, e.g., a 

restricted tidal influx. 

Complementary indications from the other recorded palynomorphs are in line 

with those provided by dinoflagellate cysts. The occurrence of common to abundant 

microforamineferal linings is taken as an indication of shallow waters (Melia, 1984; 

Powell et al., 1990). Classopolis-dominated assemblages of pollen grains, an indicator 

of coastal vegetation (Peyrot et al., 2011), along with the scarce representation of 

bisaccate pollen, suggest a nearshore deposition, close to the production source. 

The presence of prasinophyte algae also suggests lower salinity of the surface water 

(Skupien &amp;amp; Vasicek, 2002), confirmed by the common occurrence of the fresh-water/

brackish algae Botryoccocus sp. in some samples (Guiry &amp;amp; Guiry, 2017; El Beialy et al., 

2010), which may additionally indicate local fluvial influences. 

All taken together, the overall picture provided by the dinocysts-based analysis fits 

well the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the middle Cenomanian of Nazaré 

based on the sedimentary and macro-faunal (invertebrate and vertebrate) evidence, 

namely the schematic reconstruction proposed by Callapez et al. (2014), articulating 

an idealized tidal flat model and a marginal marine lagoon partially separated from an 

open shelf environment by barrier shoals (see Fig. 29).

Figure 29 - A. Schematic palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for the Nazaré sector during the Midlle 
Cenomanian (after Callapez et al., 2014). The lagoonal environment is represented by oyster communities 
with Gyrostrea ouremensis, illustrated in B. and a vertebrate fauna including fishes, turtles and crocodyliforms.

Nevertheless, despite suggestions that these inferred palaeoenvironmental 

features may be somewhat reinforced at the top of the succession (e.g., increased 

dominance of Subtiliphaera sp., increased representation of taxa with more nearshore 

affinities, absence or weakened representation of taxa with more offshore affinities: 

see section 7.3), no clear record of a lower Cenomanian open shelf environment, or 

of a transition into the suggested mid-Cenomanian lagoonal system, was obtained. 

This signals a limit of the present study, related to an uneven distribution of the 

samples across the stratigraphic succession. As a result of the criteria guiding the 

selection of the most suitable layers for sampling (thin granulometry and darker 

sediment: see section 6.1), the lowest sampled layers were actually close to the level 

of the LEP/B discontinuity, the accepted boundary between the lower and the 

middle Cenomanian. Undersampling of the “Level with Exogyra pseudafricana” strata 

may thus explain the lack of dinocyst-based evidence pointing to an open shelf 

environment (e.g., a marked increase of stenohaline species and/or the occurrence of 

P. infusorioides-dominated assemblages), which may be available at layers lower down 

in the succession This issue can only be addressed through future work. In any case, 

the present data suggest that a well developed restricted marginal marine setting was 

already in place at the very beginning of the mid-Cenomanian in the Nazaré sector.

8.2. BIOSTRATIGRAPHICAL IMPLICATIONS 

Another purported goal of this study was to supplement local biostratigraphic analyses 

of the basal section of the carbonate formation (see Callapez, 1998, for a review of 

proposed biozonations), with data provided by the dinocysts assemblages. Results 

were rather limited, given the prevalence of species with a long cronostratigraphic 

range. Accepting that Xiphophoridium alatum has its FO during the lower Cenomanian 

and Epelidosphaeridia spinosa its LO of at the end of upper Cenomanian (following 

Williams et al., 2004), still below the Cenomanian-Turonian transition, the pattern of 

occurrence of these two species in the samples suggests a lower to upper Cenomanian 

age of the studied stratigraphic succession (see Fig. 28A and B), The occurrence in 

several samples, including the lowermost one (M1), of Trithyrodinium suspectum, given 

its FO during the upper Cenomanian (following William et al., 2004), suggests a late 

Cenomanian age for the succession, higher than the early to middle Cenomanian 

dating co-indicated by diverse other biostratigraphic markers (Callapez, 1998; 

Callapez et al., 2014). Further palynostratrigraphical sampling of the section would be 

needed for a better assessment of the occurrence profile of Trithyrodinium suspectum, 

making room for the possibility that a revision of its FO in the Late Cretaceous of 

Iberia might be required. Meanwhile, no other supporting evidence in the literature 

suggests that to be the case. 

While allowing for a discussion of the overall age range of the succession, no 

relevant contributions for the distinction between Cenomanian substages (lower, 

middle, upper) came out of the dinocysts analysis. This concurs with the findings 

of several other studies where Cenomanian dinocysts assemblages were shown of 

limited value for improving the biostratigraphic resolution at the level of Cenomanian 

substages (Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler, 1982; Lignum 2009; Peyrot, 2011).

8.3. COMPARATIVE VIEWS WITH OTHER CRETACEOUS 

DINOCYSTS ASSEMBLAGES 

A further twofold goal of the study was to arrive at an exploratory view of the 

similarities and differences with dinocysts assemblages at stratigraphically equivalent 

regions in Northwest Europe, on the one hand, and at other Tethyan carbonate 

platforms from the Iberian microplate, which during the Late Cretaceous constituted 

a relatively independent tectonic block with a palaeogeographical location in between 



Contribution to the knowledge of dinoflagellate cysts from the upper cretaceous of Portugal

116

the Protoatlantic and Mediterranean margins (Segura et al., 2014). 

The assemblages found at the Nazaré sector reflect a predominance of taxa with 

a recognized/probable Tethyan affinity, such as Subtilishphaera sp., Florentinia spp., 

Spinifirites spp., Xenascus ceratioides (Arai, 2014; Arai et al., 2000; Carvalho et al., 2016; 

Masure et al., 2013; Skupien &amp;amp; Vasicek, 2002), and environmental preferences for 

warm water, such as Spiniferites sp., O. pulcherrimum, P. infusiorioides (Prauss, 2002; 

Uwins &amp;amp; Batten, 1988), while also including species sometimes taken to reflect more 

northern, Protoatlantic influences, such as Trithyrodinium suspectum (Peyrot, 2011). 

Unlike assemblages of the Castilian Platform (Northern-Central Spain), where 

characteristic high latitude species such as Isabelidinium acuminatum were recorded, no 

taxa with a recognized specific Temperate-Boreal affinity were found at the Nazaré 

site.

The most general result of the comparisons with Cenomanian-Turonian Spanish 

assemblages (Peyrot, 2011; Peyrot et al., 2011; Peyrot et al., 2012) and with coeval 

assemblages from different parts of Northwest Europe (Lignum, 2009), which 

nearly all exhibited a predominance of Palaeohystichophora infusorioides and Spiniferites 

ramosus, was the suggestion of a rather specific local palaeoenvironment of the Nazaré 

sector during the late early-middle Cenomanian, departing from the widespread 

open shelf marine environments reflected in the studies used for comparison. This 

palaeocological specificity of Nazaré was further confirmed by comparisons with 

earlier studies of Albian-Cenomanian dinocysts in the region of Lisbon (Berthou et 

al., 1980; Berthou &amp;amp; Hasenboehler, 1982: see section 7.6) and harmonizes well with 

the suggested role of local tectonics structures (close by diapiric structures of Caldas 

da Rainha and São Pedro de Moel acting as barriers) in sustaining the development 

of a marginal-marine lagoonal system in early-middle Cenomanian time (Callapez, 

1998, 2008; Callapez et al., 2014).
