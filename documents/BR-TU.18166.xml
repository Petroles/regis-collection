Abstract: The Figueira Branca Suite is a layered mafic-ultramafic complex 
in the Jauru Terrane, southwest Amazon Craton. New lithological, 
geochemical, gamma-ray and potential field data, integrated with 
geological, isotope and paleomagnetic data are used to characterize this 
pulse of Mesoproterozoic extension-related magmatism. The Figueira Branca 
Suite formed through juvenile magma emplacement into the crust at 1425 
Ma, coeval with the later stages of the Santa Helena Orogen. Gabbros and 
peridotite-gabbros display increasing enrichment of LREE, interpreted as 
evidence of progressive fractionation of the magma. Magnetic and gamma-
ray data delimit the extent of magmatism within the suite to four bodies 
to the north of Indiavaí city. Modelling gravity and magnetic field data 
indicate that the anomalous sources are close to the surface or 
outcropping. These intrusions trend northwest over 8 km, with significant 
remanent magnetization that is consistent with published direction 
obtained through paleomagnetic data. The emplacement, mineralogy and 
geochemical signature point towards a back-arc extension tectonic 
framework in the later stages of the Santa Helena Orogen.

Abstract 27

28

A variety of reconstructions have been proposed for the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic 29

supercontinent Nuna. Most involve the juxtaposition of Laurentia and Baltica with Siberia 30

occupying an adjacent or nearby position. But the disposition of other cratonic blocks around 31

these core elements, or whether they were even part of Nuna, is unresolved. We use magnetic 32

field data from the global magnetic anomaly map, EMAG2, from the Amazon, Baltic, West 33

African and North China cratons to observe potential continuity of magnetic lineaments and 34

regimes in domains of similar ages within these cratons. On this basis, a permissible early 35

Mesoproterozoic configuration of these cratonic fragments involves southwest Baltica 36

(Sarmatia) abutting the northern portion of the Amazon Craton (Maroni-Itacaiúnas), whereas 37

the western or the southern border of West Africa would be close to, or connected with, the 38

northeast side of the Amazon Craton. This data is consistent with those models that locate the 39

Amazon Craton at the southern end of the main Nuna landmass. 40

1. Introduction55

56

The location and composition of the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic supercontinent Nuna, also 57

known as Columbia and Hudsonland, and its constituent fragments is much debated and a 58

variety of models, some of which entail mutually exclusive configurations, have been proposed 59

(Evans and Mitchell, 2011; Johansson, 2009; Pisarevsky et al., 2014; Rogers and Santosh, 60

2002; Williams et al., 1991; Zhao et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2001).61

Understanding the processes of supercontinent amalgamation and breakup, as well as their 62

paleogeographic configuration, provides valuable insights into the evolution of the Earth, 63

including the role of Large Igneous Provinces (LIP) (Youbi et al., 2013), their relationship to 64

patterns of ore deposits (Cawood and Hawkesworth, 2015; Pehrsson et al., 2015), and their 65

potential impact on the Earth’s surficial environments, including atmosphere and ocean 66

composition and the biosphere (e.g., Cawood and Hawkesworth, 2015, and references therein).67

Historically, supercontinent reconstructions are based on the integration of one or more datasets 68

involving stratigraphic and tectonic correlations, geochemical and isotopic compositions, and 69

paleomagnetic data. In this paper, we evaluate the position of the Amazon Craton in the Nuna 70

supercontinent using magnetic field data and, in particular, we assess a number of recent 71

reconstructions that highlight the range of Nuna configurations and the datasets used to justify 72

those configurations, including: (1) Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), which is based on 73

paleomagnetic data; (2) Pisarevsky et al. (2014), based on paleomagnetic and geological 74

constraints; and (3) Pehrsson et al. (2015) who integrated paleomagnetic and geological data75

with patterns and features of ore deposit distribution (Fig. 1).  76

Pisarevsky et al. (2014), and (c) Pehrsson et al. (2015). 80

81

Our assessment is based on a combination of  Total Magnetic Field, the Amplitude of the 82

Analytic Signal 3D (Roest et al., 1992), and Tilt data (Verduzco et al., 2004) of the Amazon 83

and potential adjacent cratons, to compare magnetic signature, which along with geologic and 84

age data of these cratons enables us to revaluate proposed Nuna reconstructions. Unfortunately, 85



86

paleopole data for the Amazon Craton for the relevant period of Nuna assembly is limited: the 86

1420 Ma Indiavaí (D'Agrella-Filho et al., 2012) and Nova Guarita intrusives (Bispo-Santos et 87

al., 2012), and the 1790 Ma Colider (Bispo-Santos et al., 2008) and Avanavero intrusives (Reis 88

et al., 2013). The small number of Proterozoic reference poles in the Amazon Craton, as well 89

as West Africa (Pisarevsky et al., 2014), in part reflects the vast area of the Amazon forest90

with limited access and poor exposure, as well as areas of civilian unrest, or of military and 91

strategic value, and thus complicates the reconstruction of the Amazon Craton in Nuna. In this 92

paper, we demonstrate that remotely accessed data, such as magnetic field data, can provide 93

additional information to constrain the relationship between blocks in Nuna. In particular, we 94

use magnetic field data and its products to evaluate field regimes and magnetic lineaments95

within and between cratons. Magnetic field regimes are defined by the concentration of 96

magnetic anomalies within a designated region. The regimes can be interpreted as calm, 97

intermediate or agitated depending on the frequency pattern of the magnetic anomalies (Fig. 98

2). Magnetic lineaments are normally expressions of contacts, faults, boundaries between 99

terranes, and folds, where secondary magnetite is created through the insertion of oxygen in a 100

Fe-bearing environment (Grant, 1985b; Rotherham, 1997).  101

2. Geology of the Cratons106

107

The evaluation of the role of Amazonia in Nuna, or indeed whether it was even part of Nuna, 108

requires an outline of available geological constrains. Our focus is the Amazon Craton and 109

most published models suggest that it is linked with one or more of West African, Baltic and/or 110

the North China cratons. Outlined below are the key geological features of these blocks.111

112

2.1. Amazon Craton113

114

Tassinari and Macambira (1999) and Teixeira et al. (2010) divide the Amazon craton into six 115

structural and geochronological provinces: Central Amazon (&gt; 2.6 Ga), Maroni-Itacaiúnas116

(2.25 to 2.10 Ga), Ventuari-Tapajós (1.98 to 1.81 Ga), Rio Negro-Juruena (1.79 to 1.52 Ga),117

Rondonian-San Ignácio (1.55 to 1.30 Ga) and Sunsás (1.28 to 0.97 Ga) (Fig. 3). The stable 118

Archean nuclei of the Central Amazon is a granite-greenstone terrain. It was not affected by 119

the 2.2 Ga to 1.9 Ga Trans-Amazonian Orogeny (Hurley et al., 1967), however120

Paleoproterozoic magmatic and sedimentary events are recorded across this cratonic core.121

122

123

Fig. 3 – Geochronological provinces of the Amazon Craton (Bahlburg et al., 2009). 124



88

The Paleoproterozoic Maroni-Itacaiúnas Province is located to the northeast of the Central 125

Amazon and can be traced for 1500 km (Fig. 3). It is characterized by greenstone belts and 126

associated calc-alkaline granitoids, with large metavolcanic-sendimentary sequences 127

metamorphosed from greenschist to amphibolite facies (Tassinari and Macambira, 1999). To128

the southwest of the Central Amazon, lies the northwest-southeast elongated Ventuari-Tapajós 129

province, composed of calc-alkaline granitoids with juvenile isotopic signatures (Cordani et 130

al., 2010). Further to the southwest, the Rio Negro-Juruena province of granite gneisses and 131

granitoids of granodioritic and tonalitic compositions forms a 2000 km long and 600 km wide132

belt aligned northwest-southeast (Fig. 3).133

The Rondonian-San Ignácio and Sunsás are the largest provinces of the Amazon Craton (Fig. 134

3). The 1.55 to 1.30 Ga Rondonian-San Ignácio has granite-gneiss-migmatitic terranes 135

metamorphosed to amphibolite or granulite facies composing its basement (Tassinari and 136

Macambira, 1999). Cordani and Teixeira (2007) associate the formation of the Rondonian-San 137

Ignácio province to the amalgamation of intra-oceanic magmatic arcs and accretionary prisms138

and ultimately their collision to the southwest with the Rio Negro-Juruena province. The 139

Sunsás orogenic belt is the youngest province of the Amazon Craton. It is the expression of the 140

collision between Amazonia and Laurentia, during the assembly of the Rodinia (Cawood and 141

Pisarevsky, 2017; Sadowski and Bettencourt, 1996; Tohver et al., 2006). The Sunsás province 142

is characterized by metamorphosed volcano-plutonic-sedimentary sequences intruded by 143

Neoproterozoic granitic suites (Boger et al., 2005).  144

145

2.2. West African Craton 146

147

The West African Craton, northwest Africa (Fig. 4), has been stable since 2 Ga (Youbi et al., 148

2013). It consists of the Archean Reguibat and Man shields to the north and south, respectively,149

large Paleoproterozoic domains separated by cratonic sedimentary basins, and at the northern 150

end, the Anti Atlas belt. The Man shield is composed by TTG-type banded gneiss, older than 151

3.0 Ga (Beckinsale et al., 1980), overlain by greenstone belt lithologies intruded by granites. 152

The Reguibat Shield contain Archean and Paleoproterozoic migmatites interlayered with mafic 153

gneisses, greenstone belts, and voluminous tonalitic or granodioritic plutons (Key et al., 2008).154

Between the shields, in the central portion of the West African Craton, the late Proterozoic to 155



89

Paleozoic Taoudeni basin, and to the north of the Reguibat Shield, the Paleozoic Tindouf basin,156

overlie basement (Guerrak, 1989; Windley, 1987). 157

158

159

Fig. 4 – West African Craton (WAC) (Ennih and Liégeois, 2008). 160

161

The Anti-Atlas belt is located between the Alpine Atlas chain and the Tindouf basin. It is 162

composed of Proterozoic low- to medium-grade schists and intrusive granitoids, and a thick 163

(ca. 10 km) late Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sedimentary cover (Soulaimani and Burkhard, 164

2008). Many orogenic cycles are recognized in the West African Craton, spanning from 3.5 to 165

1.75 Ga, along with the 750 to 550 Ma Pan African orogenic event (Ennih and Liégeois, 2008).166

Söderlund et al. (2013), El Bahat et al. (2013), Kouyaté et al. (2013) and Youbi et al. (2013)167

indicate that the interval from 1.7 to 1.0 Ga was marked by intraplate magmatic events.168

169

2.3. Baltic Craton 170

171

Baltica is divisible into the Archean proto-continents of Sarmatia, Volgo-Uralia and 172

Fennoscandia (Fig. 5) that were assembled into Baltica along Paleoproterozoic to 173

Mesoproterozoic orogenic belts (Bogdanova et al., 2008).  174



90

The Fennoscandian Shield, northwest Baltica, is surrounded by Paleoproterozoic crust formed 175

between 1.95 and 1.90 Ga, and intruded by the 1850-1650 Ma Transcandinavian Igneous Belt 176

(Bingen et al., 2008). Basement within the shield is cut by Anorthosite-Mangerite-Charnockite-177

Granite (AMCG) (Emslie et al., 1994) and A-type granitoid suites, dolerite dykes and sills,178

tholeiitic basalt, mafic metavolcanic rocks, and gabbro-tonalite complexes were emplaced 179

between 1.73 to 1.44 Ga (Bogdanova et al., 2006; Bogdanova et al., 2008). The Central Russian 180

collisional belt connects Fennoscandia and Sarmatia (Fig. 5). It contains blocks of Archean 181

rocks reworked during the Paleoproterozoic.  182

183

184

Fig. 5 – Baltic Craton (Bogdanova et al., 2008). 185

186

The Volgo-Uralia Shield in eastern Baltica, contains granitic gneiss as old as 3.3 Ga 187

(Bogdanova et al., 2005) and is characterized by 3.0 to 2.7 Ga belts of metasedimentary and 188

metaigneous granulites, and subordinate komatiite-bearing greenstone sequences (Bogdanova 189

et al., 2008). The collisional belt between the Volgo-Uralia and Sarmatia contains turbiditic 190

pelites and greywackes with carbonaceous rocks (Shchipansky et al., 2007). To the north and 191

east of the Volgo-Uralia, lies an infered 1.4 to 0.7 Ga passive margin succession (Bogdanova 192

et al., 2008). 193

Sarmatia is the result of the amalgamation of 3.7 to 2.6 Ga blocks intercalated by 2.2 to 2.1 Ga 194

Paleoproterozoic belts (Bogdanova et al., 2008). Bogdanova et al. (2006) report north-south 195



91

trends, both in the Paleoproterozoic belts and reworked Archean crust, but with an abrupt 196

change to a northeast-southwest orientation at the northeastern limit of the block. This change 197

marks the continental-margin igneous belt formed at 2.0 to 1.95 Ga with the collision of 198

Sarmatia with the Volgo-Uralia.199

200

2.4. North China Craton201

202

The North China Craton consists of four Archean blocks (Yinshan, Ordos, Longgang and 203

Nangrim), amalgamated by younger orogenic belts (Fig. 6) (Zhao and Cawood, 2012). The 204

Yinshan and the Ordos blocks are separated by the 1.95 to 1.92 Ga Khondalite Belt, which 205

together form the Western Block of the North China Craton (Dong et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2013; 206

Zhao and Cawood, 2012). The Longgang and the Nangrim blocks, united by the Jiao-Liao-Ji 207

belt at 1.90 Ga, constitute the Eastern Block of the North China Craton (Wu et al., 2013; Zhao 208

and Cawood, 2012). The Western and Eastern blocks collided at ca. 1.85 Ga, forming the 209

Paleoproterozoic Trans-North China Orogen (Zhao et al., 2012). 210

211

212

Fig. 6 – North China Craton (Zhao et al., 2004). 213

214

The Yinshan Block is composed of Neoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG)215

gneisses and minor supracrustal rocks metamorphosed at ca. 2.5 Ga (Wu et al., 2013). The 1.95 216

to 1.92 Ga Khondalite Belt, separating the Yinshan and the Ordos blocks is dominated by 217

gneisses, paragneisses, calc-silicate rocks and marbles (Zhao and Zhai, 2013). The Ordos 218

Block, to the south of the Khondalite Belt, is largely covered by the Mesozoic to Cenozoic 219

Ordos basin. 220



92

In the Eastern Block, the Longgang and the Nangrim blocks consist of 3.8 to 3.0 Ga TTG 221

gneisses, 2.7-2.5 Ga syntectonic granitoids, supracrustal ultramafic (komatiitic) to felsic 222

volcanic rocks and metasedimentary rocks (Zhao et al., 2001). The Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, separating 223

the Longgang and Nangrim blocks, is characterized by metamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic 224

successions and associated granitic and mafic intrusions (Zhao and Zhai, 2013). 225

The Trans-North China Orogen extends north-south for approximately 1200 km and is up to 226

300 km wide (Zhao et al., 2012). It contains late Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic (2560227

to 2475 Ma) TTG gneisses, granitoids and greenstone belts developed under continental228

magmatic arc, island arc- or back-arc basin environments (Wilde et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2012; 229

Zhao and Zhai, 2013). 230

233

3.1. Data234

235

The magnetic field data used here was obtained through the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid 236

(EMAG2) (Maus et al., 2009). This compiled and corrected data set incorporates satellite, ship 237

and airborne surveys, of which the last two had been given preference where available. The 238

resolution of the grid is 2 arc min (ca. 3.7 km in the equator), and the altitude normalized to 4 239

km above the geoid. Wavelengths longer than 330 km were obtained with the latest CHAMP 240

satellite magnetic field model MF6 (http://geomag.org/models/MF6.html, accessed 241

28/02/2017). 242

We analysed the crustal magnetic field data obtained by EMAG2 to evaluate Nuna 246

reconstructions. Three features of the magnetic field were considered to facilitate comparison 247

of continental-scale structures: the magnetic regime (agitated, intermediate, or calm, e.g. Fig. 248

2), the size of the anomalies, and the orientation of the magnetic lineaments. The resolution 249



93

and normalized altitude obtained from the EMAG2 are compatible with the scale of the 250

investigated tectonic features (&gt; 3.7 km). 251

Geological and tectonic features usually present different amounts of magnetic minerals, 252

resulting in the generation of a magnetic signal, whether inserted in an external (geomagnetic) 253

field or not. Magnetite is a minor accessory mineral present in most rocks, rarely constituting254

more than 1 % by volume of a rock (Grant, 1985a). The formation of magnetite, primary or 255

secondary, is mainly associated with the supply of oxygen in the system. The most important256

factors that determine the bulk magnetic properties of a rock are the total iron content, the 257

oxidation state, the initial crystallization environment, the degree of metamorphism, the degree 258

of silica saturation, the grain size of original sediment (in metasedimentary rocks), and the 259

major element chemistry (Grant, 1985a). 260

The magnetic regimes were evaluated based on the frequency that magnetic anomalies appear 261

in each domain of the cratons. An agitated regime (Fig. 2) is interpreted to represent greater262

tectonic activity through the entire history of the block, but not necessarily in a single period, 263

while intermediate and calm regimes indicate less active settings, e.g., passive margins 264

undergoing thermally driven subsidence (Olesen et al., 2007). To observe the magnetic 265

regimes, the Total Magnetic Field (TMI) and the Amplitude of the Analytic Signal 3D (AAS) 266

(Roest et al., 1992) were analysed. The TMI shows overall patterns of anomalies, but depends 267

on the geomagnetic (inducing) field at the time of the survey. This dependence is relevant in 268

studies of large areas, in which the magnetic field changes in orientation and intensity, i.e. the 269

present magnetic field in the Amazon Craton varies in inclination from -30° to +30°, 270

declination from -20° to -10°, and intensity from 33012 to 22890 nT, depending on the location,271

whereas in Baltica, it changes from +68° to +78° in inclination, from -2° to +10° in declination, 272

and from 52952 to 54635 nT in intensity (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm,273

accessed in 28/02/2017, the magnetic field refers to the International Geomagnetic Reference 274

Field model for same date the data was accessed in the website).275

The AAS is given by the expression (Roest et al., 1992): 276

AAS = ( T/ x)2 + ( T/ y)2 +( T/ z)2] (1) 277

where T refers to the TMI, and x, y, and z directions in Cartesian space. The AAS is one of the 278

most commonly used techniques to evaluate the lateral limits of sources of potential field 279

anomalies.280



94

Linked to the magnetic regime, the size of the anomalies was explored with the AAS (Figs. 7b, 281

8b, 9b and 10b). This technique, based on directional derivatives of the field, reveals the lateral 282

limits of discrete bodies and geological features. It displays little dependence on the direction 283

of the magnetic field, so the location of the anomaly or the presence of remanent magnetization 284

does not interfere with the results. Coeval domains connected at some point in Earth evolution 285

tend to present structures of similar sizes (Olesen et al., 2007) if no posterior event altered 286

significantly its composition and size. Regional tectonothermal events involving magmatism, 287

deformation and metamorphism can generate strain and thermal energy sufficient to alter the 288

size of the anomalies, whether by distorting the body, by changing and or extinguishing the 289

remanent magnetization, or by opening the system to oxygenated fluids and formation of290

secondary magnetite. These changes can be observed in large areas that not necessarily are 291

limited to one specific domain.  292

The assembly of terranes and regional movements inside the cratons are considered by 293

evaluating the size of the anomalies. These events can alter the direction of magnetic 294

lineaments, especially close to the boundary zone, and less significantly in distal regions from 295

the event. The magnetic lineaments were assessed primarily with the Tilt technique (Verduzco 296

et al., 2004), and complemented by AAS. The Tilt technique is given by the relation:297

TILT = tan-1{[ ( T/ z)2]/ ( T/ x)2 + ( T/ y)2]} (2) 298

where T refers to the TMI, and x, y, and z directions in Cartesian space. 299

In successful supercontinent reconstructions, coeval stable domains in adjacent cratons, created 300

under similar circumstances, should display parallel to subparallel lineaments, and continuity 301

from one craton to another. Magnetic overprinting can occur after the stabilization of the 302

domain, commonly in cratonization events; for example, a regional thermal overprint occurred 303

in the southwest Amazon Craton at ca. 1.3 Ga (Bettencourt et al., 2010). This kind of event is 304

accompanied by tectonic reactivation, deformation, and magmatism, which are manifested by 305

extensive shear zones, mylonitic belts, rifts and sedimentary basins, and post-tectonic and 306

anorogenic intrusions (Cordani and Teixeira, 2007). The magnetic overprint can change the 307

orientation of the magnetic lineaments to directions that differ from those obtained during the 308

formation of the domain. Such later tectonic events are generally associated with a regional 309

thermal anomaly of sufficient magnitude to unblock the magnetic moments, which vary 310

depending on the mineral and size of the grains. These are large-scale events and were mostly 311

recognized in the cratons used in this work, and are incorporated into our interpretation.  312

315

To aid the visualization and interpretation of tectonic provinces and lineaments, the colours of 316

the provinces were normalized to the colours used in the Amazon Craton map according with 317

their respective ages (Fig. 3). The age relations and magnetic regimes are summarized in Table 318

4.1. Amazon Craton 324

325

The Amazon Craton has a northwest-southeast trend of lithotectonic assemblages (e.g. Fig. 3)326

that is mimicked by the magnetic field (Fig. 7). The limits of the various provinces recognized 327

within the craton are not clear from the magnetic data set alone, but with the support of 328

geological data, it was possible to associate specific magnetic signatures for each province. The 329

Central Amazon province shows an agitated magnetic domain in the north, with large 330

anomalies up to 100 km wide, and decreasing agitation and anomaly size to the south. The 331

Maroni-Itacaiúnas province has an agitated magnetic domain, with anomalies up to 130 km332

wide. The Ventuari-Tapajós, Rio Negro-Juruena, Rondonian-San Ignácio, and Sunsás 333

provinces show a progressive decrease in agitation and anomaly size. Further to the southwest, 334

in the Amazon basin, the magnetic signature shows a significant decrease of agitation in all 335

provinces. The areas proximal to the borders of the Amazon basin show a new increase of 336

agitation, but still maintaining the overall trend of a reduction in the size of the anomaly.337

338

geological provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized 341

to the colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages. 342



98

The magnetic lineaments from the Amazon Craton show the overall northwest-southeast trend 343

displayed by the lithotectonic provinces (Fig. 7d). This trend is orthogonal to the northeast-344

southwest-oriented accretion that occurred around the Central Amazon province since the 345

Paleoproterozoic. The area occupied by the Amazon Basin, central in the map and covered by 346

Phanerozoic cover, shows a significant decrease in the magnetic regime and in the volume of 347

lineaments. A major lineament crosscuts the craton from east to west, starting in the eastern 348

end of the Amazon basin and continuing through the Sunsás Belt to the western border.  349

350

4.2. West African Craton 351

352

The Archean shield regions of the West African Craton, are equivalent in age to the Central 353

Amazon province, and display an overall agitated regime (Fig. 8). The shields, however, 354

display large areas that lack data. The Paleoproterozoic domains display a calm regime in the 355

south, but agitated in the northern region proximal to the Anti-Atlas belt. In the areas dominated 356

by Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sedimentary cover, the magnetic field has intermediate 357

agitation in the southeast of the West African Craton, but an agitated character in the northeast,358

proximal to the southern front of Variscan deformation. Like the Archean shields, the359

Neoproterozoic and Cambrian cover incorporate large areas that lack data.  360

361

geological provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized 364

to the colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages.365



100

The relatively small area representing the Pan-African belts within the West African Craton is 366

dominated by a small number of large anomalies up to 100 km wide. The Paleozoic to Recent 367

sedimentary cover, extending over most of the craton, shows intermediate agitation in the 368

magnetic regime. This cover displays a local increase in agitation when proximal to the 369

Southern Front of the Variscan deformation, in the northeast of the craton. Large areas without 370

data compose the sedimentary cover.371

The north portion of West African Craton has a northwest-southeast trend, parallel to the Anti-372

Atlas belt and the south Variscan front (Fig. 8d). Orthogonal, northeast-southwest-oriented, 373

lineaments can be seen in the Man Shield in the south of the craton and in the area covered by 374

Mesozoic to recent sediments in the centre of the craton. Significantly large areas in the 375

southwest and northwest West African Craton do not have available magnetic field data, 376

impeding further analysis. 377

378

4.3. Baltic Craton 379

380

The Baltic Craton shows an overall calm to intermediate magnetic field in its northern and 381

southern portions. A highly agitated east-west trend crosscuts the craton, occupying the region 382

south of Fennoscandia, the collisional orogens between Fennoscandia and Sarmatia, and383

between Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia (Fig. 9). We will refer to this trend as the Central Baltica 384

Magnetic regime. The Archean crust in Baltica shows an intermediate magnetic regime in the 385

central Archean terrane of Fennoscandia and in the Archean domain in southern Sarmatia. In 386

northern Fennoscandia and southwestern Sarmatia, the magnetic regime is agitated. In Volgo-387

Uralia, the Archean crust presents an agitated regime, especially in its southern area (Central 388

Baltica Magnetic regime). In regions composed of reworked Archean crust, a calm regime 389

dominates the magnetic field, except in areas proximal to the Central Baltica Magnetic regime.390

391

provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized to the 394

colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages.395



102

The magnetic field of the Paleoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia and Volgo-Uralia, shows 396

higher agitation than Archean crust reworked during the same period (Figs. 5 and 9). The late 397

Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic structures and suites indicate an increasing magnetic 398

setting from calm in the east to agitated in the west, which experienced the late 399

Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic Sveconorwegian orogeny. In the Central Russian 400

collisional belt, the field remains calm. The mostly inferred passive margins along the northern 401

and eastern borders of the Baltic Craton (Fig. 5) show a predominantly calm regime, with very 402

long wavelength anomalies, typical of this type of tectonic setting 403

2014). The central area of Baltica, corresponding with the eastern limit of the Central Baltica 404

Magnetic regime, is characterized by a sudden increase in the magnetic regime to agitated.405

The Fennoscandia, Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia domains, and the intervening collisional 406

orogenic belts, are reflected in the distribution and orientation of the magnetic lineaments from 407

the Baltic craton (Fig. 9d). Fennoscandia shows a WNW-ESE trend in lineaments, except near 408

the western limit of the craton with the Sveconorwegian orogen, where the trend varies from 409

east-west to northeast-southwest. An almost orthogonal trend to the Fennoscandian shield 410

occurs in the collisional zone of Fennoscandia and Sarmatia and continues in the northeast-411

southwest direction through the Central Russia Collisional Belt. The Volgo-Uralia shield 412

displays a similar ENE-WSW orientation. Sarmatia shows an overall northwest-southeast 413

orientation, slightly oblique to that in Fennoscandia. The inferred 1.4 to 0.7 Ga passive margins 414

of Baltic craton do not show a predominant trend of magnetic lineaments.415

416

4.4. North China Craton 417

418

The North China Craton is characterized by long wavelength anomalies, and increasing 419

agitation near the limits between the Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement and the orogens 420

and belts (Fig. 10). A northeast-southwest trend is visible in all magnetic fields and derived 421

maps. The Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement presents intermediate to agitated regimes 422

with large magnetic anomalies. The magnetic regimes in the Ordos and Longgang blocks have 423

intermediate frequency, whereas the Yinshan block shows an increased concentration of 424

anomalies. The Nangrim Block, in the Eastern Block, does not have sufficient data to be 425

evaluated.426

427

geological provinces and magnetic lineaments. The colours of the provinces were normalized 430

to the colours used in the Amazon Craton map (Fig. 4) according with their respective ages.431

432

The Trans-North China Orogen displays a similar magnetic regime to that of the Ordos and 433

Longgang blocks, including long wavelengths and intermediate concentration of anomalies. 434

The Khondalite Belt varies from a calm regime in the west, near the border of the craton, to the435

increasing agglomeration of large anomalies from the centre to the eastern end proximal to the 436

Trans-North China Orogen. The Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt has a calm regime in the south with sparse 437

anomalies from the centre to the northeast area.438

In the Archean to Paleoproterozoic basement of the North China Craton, the magnetic 439

lineament trends show a northeast-southwest pattern in the Ordos Block (Western Block) and 440

northwest in the Longgang Block (Eastern Block) (Fig. 10d). The northwest portion of the 441



104

craton, marked by the Yinshan Block and the Khondalite Belt shows a predominant east-west 442

trend. The northwest area, containing the Nangrim Block and the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, does not 443

have sufficient data to reveal a major trend.444

445

5. Results 446

447

Based on mapping the magnetic regimes and lineaments for Amazonia, West Africa, Baltica,448

and North China, Tilt maps were overlain by geological provinces and magnetic lineaments to 449

compare a variety of proposed Nuna reconstructions (Figs. 12, 14 and 16). This enables a visual 450

comparison of the alignment and possible continuity of magnetic lineaments within and 451

between the cratons. The continuity of provinces based on the magnetic field data was 452

compared with respect to available geological and paleomagnetic data to evaluate the Nuna 453

reconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014) and Pehrsson et al. 454

(2015).455

456

5.1.Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) 457

458

Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) used a compilation of Precambrian paleopoles with minimum 459

Q-values of four (Van der Voo, 1990) to propose Nuna reconstructions for 2.45, 1.88, 1.78, 460

1.63, 1.53, 1.26 and 1.04 Ga. The Q-value is a 7-point measure that determines the quality of 461

a paleopole measurement. Their reconstructions show that by 1.53 Ga an assembled Nuna 462

included a continuous landmass formed by Amazonia, Baltica, Laurentia and Australia (Fig. 463

11). Siberia and North China cratons are disconnected from this main landmass reflecting a 464

lack of continuity between their Paleoproterozoic and older orogenic belts with coeval units in 465

their proposed reconstruction. The position of Amazonia with respect to Baltica is based on the 466

inferred continuity of the 1.9 Ga to 1.8 Ga Ventuari-Tapajós Province with the Svecofennian, 467

and the 1.8 Ga to 1.5 Ga Rio Negro-Juruena provinces with the Trans-Scandinavian Igneous 468

Belt. Laurentia is orientated so the 1.8 Ga to 1.5 Ga orogenic belts along its eastern and 469

southwestern margins face an open ocean, thus forming a long lasting accretionary orogen that 470

was only terminated with the Mesoproterozoic Grenville collisional event (Cawood and 471

Pisarevsky, 2017; Hynes and Rivers, 2010; Karlstrom et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2002).   472



105

473

Fig. 11 – Nuna reconstruction at 1.53 Ga. 474

475

The Nuna reconstruction proposed by Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) shows Baltica and the 476

North China cratons adjacent to the Amazon Craton (Figs. 11 and 12). The Amazon Craton is 477

rotated approximately 35° clockwise, whereas Baltica is rotated 20° and North China 78° anti-478

clockwise relative to their present orientation. The magnetic lineaments of the Paleo- to 479

Mesoproterozoic domains from Amazon and Baltica are sub-parallel, displaying a northwest-480

southeast trend. The Archean Central Amazon and the Archean crust of Sarmatia maintain this 481

alignment and suggest a connection of both cratons. Although the apparent geological and 482

geochronological continuity of the Longgang Block and the Trans-North China Orogen with 483

the Archean and Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia support their reconstruction,484

the magnetic lineaments of North China Craton are near orthogonal to those of Fennoscandia 485

(Fig. 12). 486

5.2. Pisarevsky et al. (2014)494

495

Pisarevsky et al. (2014) used apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) and coeval paired 496

paleopoles between continents to evaluate possible cratonic connections during the 497

Proterozoic. They propose a model in which two separated landmasses, East and West Nuna, 498

formed a single supercontinent between 1650 and 1580 Ma. Pisarevsky et al. (2014) present 499

the evolution of the Nuna through a series of global paleogeographic reconstructions for 1770, 500

1720, 1650, 1580, 1500, 1470, 1450, 1380 and 1270 Ma. West Nuna was composed by 501

Laurentia, Baltica and possibly India, whereas the East Nuna contained Australia, Mawson 502

(Antarctica), and North China. After ca. 1500 Ma, Siberia and Congo/São Francisco joined 503

Nuna, whereas West African and the Amazon cratons formed a separate continent from Nuna 504

(Fig. 13). 505

506

509



108

In the Pisarevsky et al. (2014) reconstruction the Amazon and the West African cratons are 510

separate from the Nuna supercontinent. Both cratons lie northwest of the main Nuna landmass511

with Amazonia rotated 137° and the West Africa 74° anti-clockwise relative to their present 512

orientation. No geological or geochronological continuity between the two cratons is visible in 513

this reconstruction (Fig. 14). The Paleoproterozoic Maroni-Itacaiúnas (1.98 to 1.81 Ga) 514

presents a northeast-southwest trend in the magnetic lineaments subparallel with one of the two 515

trends shown in the Man Shield. None of the remaining domains from the West African Craton 516

display a similar parallelism with coeval provinces in the Amazon Craton.  517

5.3. Pehrsson et al. (2015) 526

527

The reconstruction proposed by Pehrsson et al. (2015) attempts to integrate data from previous 528

models, including paleomagnetic data, with constraints from ore deposit as the formation and 529

preservation of such deposits is linked to the supercontinent cycle (Cawood and Hawkesworth, 530

2015). The deposits types were used to test the reconstructions, based on the expected 531

environment and age for each deposit type; i.e. volcanic-hosted massive sulphides in collisional 532

or accretionary settings, sediment-hosted copper deposits in extensional settings, and uranium 533

mineralization in subtropical latitudes.534

Pehrsson et al. (2015) show a Nuna reconstruction from 1.6 and 1.4 Ga (Fig. 15), with a main 535

landmass composed of Laurentia, Baltic, Amazon, Rio de la Plata, West African, Siberia and 536

São Francisco/Congo cratons. Proto-Australia (South, North and West Australia) and the 537

Yangtze cratons are located northeast of the main Nuna mass and separated by a zone 538

undergoing regional extension, leading ultimately to ocean formation. North China, North and 539

South India, Rayner and the Kalahari cratons are separate from Nuna. 540

542

Fig. 15 – Reconstruction of Nuna for the period from 1.6 to 1.45 Ga. 543

544

The Pehrsson et al. (2015) reconstruction locates the Amazon Craton in the southern 545

hemisphere, to the south-southeast of Baltica and to the southwest of West Africa (Fig. 16).546

This reconstruction involves anticlockwise rotation of the Amazon Craton by 20°, Baltica by547

51°, and West Africa by 48°. The WNW-ESE-oriented magnetic lineaments of the Ventuari-548

Tapajós province are subparallel to the lineaments in the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of 549

Fennoscandia, so are the lineaments in the Maroni-Itacaiúnas and the Paleoproterozoic crust of 550

Sarmatia (Fig. 5). The West African Craton, connected with the present east of the Amazon 551

Craton, displays a similar parallelism between the lineaments of the coeval Man Shield (West 552

Africa), the Maroni-Itacaiúnas province (Amazon) and the Sarmatia Paleoproterozoic crust 553

(Baltica). Lineaments from the south of the Central Amazon province also show a subparallel 554



111

trend to the lineaments of the Archean domain in the southern part of West Africa. In this last 555

case, however, the parallelism is speculative, given the small number and size of the lineaments 556

in the West Africa due to absence of magnetic field data.557

6. Discussion566

567

Magnetic anomaly patterns of sources in blocks of different cratons should be different of each 568

other, unless they were together during their formation and/or overprinted during reworking by 569

younger events. The comparison of anomalies for the Amazon, West African, Baltic and North 570

China cratons shows that coeval and possibly related Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic domains in 571

the different cratons have different sizes of anomalies. Thus, the wavelength of anomalies for 572

Amazon and West Africa are predominantly larger than those in Baltica (Figs. 7 to 9; compare 573

the Maroni-Itacaiúnas, Man Shield and the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of Fennoscandia).574

Reasons for these differences could include distortion caused by different projections of large 575

landmasses, and the different resolution and amount of data of the compiled magnetic surveys.   576

In the Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) reconstruction, the approximately coeval Paleo- to 577

Mesoproterozoic provinces in Amazon, Baltic and North China cratons show north-south 578

continuity between the first two cratons, and northwest-southeast with the last two. The 579

Longgang Block of the North China Craton is well aligned with the Archean crust of 580

Fennoscandia, and the Mesoproterozoic terranes (1.79 to 1.52 Ga) of Amazon and 581

Fennoscandia also maintain continuity. The continuity does not, however, extend to the582

Archean Western Block of North China Craton, which has no counterpart in either Amazon or 583

Baltica. These latter two cratons were still accreting younger provinces until 1.53 Ga, whereas 584

the North China was already stabilized by this time. The lineaments in the 1.98 to 1.81 Ga585

domains in Amazon and Baltica are well aligned but not with the North China Craton, which 586

are almost orthogonal orientation to those in the other two cratons. The Amazon and Baltica 587

domains show concordant magnetic regimes, which again cannot be extended to those of the 588

North China Craton. 589

The model of Pisarevsky et al. (2014) is the only one in which the Amazon Craton, along with 590

West Africa, is not included within Nuna in the Mesoproterozoic (Figs. 1 and 14). The relative 591

orientation and juxtaposition of Amazonia and West Africa proposed by Pisarevsky et al. 592

(2014) is not supported by the geological and magnetic data which lack continuity between the 593

two cratons, except perhaps for a small number of lineaments in the Maroni-Itacaiúnas 594

province and Man Shield due to 2.15-2.14 Ga calc-alkaline magmatism in the former (da Rosa-595

Costa et al., 2006), and the 2.15 Ga Eburnean orogeny in the latter (Abouchami et al., 1990).596

The Maroni-Itacaiúnas province and the Man Shield, however, show divergent magnetic 597



113

regimes, the Amazonic domain shows an agitated behaviour, whereas the West African Man 598

Shield presents a calm regime.599

Pehrsson et al. (2015), like Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), locate Baltica to the north of the 600

Amazon Craton but with a further additional rotation of Baltica to further enhance geological 601

compatibility and continuity of the 1.98 to 1.81 Ga Ventuari-Tapajós province of the Amazon 602

Craton with the coeval terranes of Fennoscandia. This rotation promoted the contact of the 2.25 603

to 2.10 Ga Maroni-Itacaiúnas with the reworked 2.20 to 2.00 Paleoproterozoic crust of 604

Sarmatia. This contact, in the Tilt map (Fig. 14), reveals possible lineament continuity in the 605

extreme north of the Amazonic domain with the Sarmatian crust to the southwest. As discussed 606

with respect to the Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) reconstruction, the connection of Baltica with 607

the Amazon Craton is supported by the magnetic regimes of the coeval domains. The West 608

African Craton, which is significantly rotated from the position proposed by Pisarevsky et al. 609

(2014), allows the alignment of the lineaments from the Central Amazon and the Maroni-610

Itacaiúnas provinces with the Archean domain and Man Shield, respectively. Evaluating the 611

continuity and parallelism of lineaments between the West Africa and Baltica is impaired by 612

the absence of data in several areas of the West African Craton. 613

614

7. Conclusions 615

616

The configuration of the Nuna supercontinent is a matter of ongoing debate as indicated by the 617

diverse distribution of cratonic blocks in the recent reconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen 618

(2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014), and Pehrsson et al. (2015). These models, as well as many 619

others (e.g. D'Agrella-Filho et al., 2012; Evans and Mitchell, 2011; Johansson, 2009; Rogers 620

and Santosh, 2002; Zhao et al., 2004), involve a similar configuration for the supercontinents 621

cratonic core juxtaposing northeast Laurentia and northern Baltica, with Siberia occupying an 622

adjacent or nearby position (e.g. Fig. 1). But the configuration of other continental blocks with 623

respect to this core assemblage, and even if these other cratonic fragments were part of Nuna 624

or separate continents, is unresolved. Most attempts to reconstruct Nuna are based on a 625

combination of geologic, geochemical, paleomagnetic, ore deposit data, with variations 626

between models often reflecting differences in the emphasis placed on the different data sets. 627

Thus, in the models evaluated here in, Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) and Pisarevsky et al. 628

(2014) integrated a combination of geological and paleomagnetic data, while Pehrsson et al. 629



114

(2015) also used isotopic and ore deposit data. In our evaluation of models of Nuna 630

reconstruction, we incorporated a worldwide compilation of magnetic field data (magnetic field 631

EMAG2). We used this to analyse the magnetic regime of each of the lithotectonic domains632

recognized in the Amazon, West African, Baltic and North China cratons, as well as the 633

wavelength of the magnetic anomalies, and magnetic lineaments, which we then compare with 634

proposed paleogeographic configurations for these blocks.  635

Similarities in the geology, age, magnetic regime, and lineaments between Archean to 636

Mesoproterozoic domains of the Amazon and Baltic cratons are consistent with the 637

reconstructions of Mertanen and Pesonen (2012) and Pehrsson et al. (2015). The geological 638

data for the North China Craton shows some similarities to the adjoining Amazonia and Baltic 639

cratons in the configuration proposed by Mertanen and Pesonen (2012), but not in the magnetic 640

field evidence. The connections between the West African and Amazon cratons proposed by 641

Pisarevsky et al. (2014) and Pehrsson et al. (2015) are not entirely supported by the magnetic 642

field data. However, juxtaposition of the present western or southern border of the West 643

African Craton with the northeast of the Amazon Craton would align the magnetic features of 644

the two cratons. 645

Of three Nuna evaluated reconstructions, the model of Pehrsson et al. (2015) agrees best with 646

the magnetic field data. It locates the Amazon Craton towards the southern portion of the Nuna647

supercontinent, connected to the West African and Baltic cratons, with an open ocean to its 648

west, where continuous accretion would occur until the mid-Neoproterozoic.  649

. Conclusions

A few questions were raised in the introduction of this thesis. The questions argued 

about how much a single suite can tell about itself and the environment around it, about honest 

mistakes in during geophysical modelling, and the Earth evolution. Three papers were 

presented proposing answers for these questions. First, a study considering the effects that 

using inaccurate constraints have in the outcome of potential field data modelling. Then, the 

development of a geophysical model from this suite, and a geochemical analysis of the tectonic 

framework and parental magma that resulted in the intrusion of the Figueira Branca Suite. The 

third and last part of the thesis consisted on using magnetic field data to evaluate supercontinent 

reconstruction models.  

The Figueira Branca Suite is a 1425 Ma layered mafic-ultramafic complex intruded in 

the Alto Jauru group, southwest Amazon Craton. This suite has been focus of isotopic and 

paleomagnetic studies, and was the centre of the three studies that composed this thesis. The 

suite is composed by four northwest-southeast-oriented bodies: Indiavaí, Azteca, Figueira 

Branca and Jauru, from southeast to northwest. The environment that surrounds the Figueira 

Branca Suite consists in the 1.8 Ga Alto Jauru meta-volcanosedimentary group that hosts the 

suite, the granite-gneiss Santa Helena (to the west) and Água Clara (to the east) suites.

Modelling, in Earth Sciences, is the ultimate effort to represent a part of the Earth that 

cannot be entirely seen. Geophysics and geochemistry are two of the sciences that most 

frequently use modelling. This thesis repeatedly used this resource, from testing how a 

microscopic analysis affects the constraints used in the modelling, to the evaluation of 

supercontinent reconstruction models with magnetic field data. 



1

Preliminary data showed abnormally low values of density and magnetic susceptibility 

in hand samples of the Figueira Branca Suite. A preliminary model was developed using these 

values as constraints. The shape, depth and remanent magnetization from this model, however, 

did not agree with geological observations and paleomagnetic data. Hand samples did not 

display clear signs of weathering or evidences that could explain the low properties, so thin 

sections were extracted to investigate their possible cause. The thin sections displayed intense 

weathering and serpentinization in some samples. This process justified a deeper investigation 

on how and how much an inaccurate constraint affect the outcome from modelling. In this case, 

the density and the magnetic susceptibility were evaluated for gravity (Bouguer anomaly) and 

magnetic field respectively.

The investigation of the effects of inaccurate constraints was made using a synthetic 

model and real data from the Indiavaí body, the southernmost intrusion of the Figueira Branca 

Suite. The investigated cases proved that using inaccurate constraints can produce errors about 

50% higher than the correct and shapes significantly different than the reality. The results also 

showed that in cases that a more thorough analysis in the sources of the constraints, the best 

solution is to perform the modelling setting the constraints free, instead of fixing inaccurate 

values and forcing the reduction of the error through the variation of depth and shape of the 

models.

With a reliable modelling methodology and constraints, it was possible to model the 

remaining anomalies of the suite. Previous studies of the Figueira Branca Suite suggest that it 

extended further to the north and northeast of the four cited bodies. However, no other analogue 

geophysical signature in the Jauru Terrane represented an intrusion of the same geological 

characteristics of the Figueira Branca Suite bodies.



1

The geophysical models obtained for the suite intrusive bodies displayed very shallow 

sill-like shapes extending 8 km on average in the northwest direction. Mineralogy and 

geochemical data indicated gabbroic rocks with predominance of plagioclase, olivine, and 

variable amounts of intergrown pyroxene. The increasing presence of pyroxene indicated a 

fractionation in the parental magma, whereas the change in the slope of the REE normalized to 

chondrites suggested an increase in the amount of melt. Both datasets together permitted to 

propose the sequence of magma extraction that generated the bodies of the Figueira Branca 

Suite was: Indiavaí, Figueira Branca, Azteca and Jauru. Trace elements completed the data, 

displaying evidences of hydrous melts in the parental magma, typical from supra-subduction 

environments. This geochemical signature for the parental magma, associated with the tectonic 

framework where the suite is hosted, was interpreted as a magmatism in the back-arc zone of 

the Santa Helena Orogen.

The answers for how much a suite can tell about itself and the environment that hosts 

it, and the larger scale analysis of the Jauru Terrane raised the last question: what about the 

Earth evolution? Where was the Amazon Craton by the time of the Santa Helena orogeny, and 

when was the Figueira Branca Suite intrusive event? The supercontinent Nuna position and the 

cratonic fragments that composed it are a matter of ongoing debate. By consequence, the debate 

extends to the Amazon Craton. Supercontinent reconstructions varies depending the amount 

and kind of data used to constraint them (e.g. combination of geologic, geochemical, 

paleomagnetic, and ore deposit data). Three recent reconstructions Mertanen and Pesonen 

(2012), Pisarevsky et al. (2014), and Pehrsson et al. (2015) suggest different configurations for 

the Nuna supercontinent, where Amazonia is adjacent to the West African, Baltic and/or the 

North China cratons. Using a worldwide compilation of magnetic field data (EMAG2), these 

reconstructions were analysed based on the magnetic regimes and lineaments of each block, 

and then the proposed paleogeographic configurations for these blocks.  



12

None of the reconstructions were entirely supported by the magnetic field data, however 

Pehrsson et al. (2015) reconstruction agrees best with it. This reconstruction locates the 

Amazon Craton towards the southern portion of the supercontinent, connected in the northeast

to the West Africa, and in the north to Baltica cratons. In this reconstruction, the southwest of 

the Amazon Craton has open ocean to its west, where continuous accretion would occur until 

the mid-Neoproterozoic, forming the Santa Helena Orogen and, later, the back-arc extension 

that permitted the intrusion of the Figueira Branca Suite.

Abstract 34
 35 
The gamma spectrometric method is an important geophysical exploration technique with 36
widespread applications in the geosciences, from local environmental applications to regional 37
geologic mapping. The method has evolved over several decades and recent advances continue 38
to present new outbreaks in instrumentation, data processing and interpretation.  39
Radioelement concentrations measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy reflect the mineral 40
composition of an outcrop. However, magmatism, erosion, hydrothermal activity and/or tectonic 41
events can significantly change the gamma signature. This work explores how different 42
processes affect the emission of radioelements and how information can be extracted from this. 43
The radiometric response of several geological terrains with different tectonic histories were 44
compared, whereas radiometric signatures of granitic intrusions, alluvium regions, craters and 45
shear zones were demonstrated. The results show how the gamma spectrometric method can 46
contribute significant information, can complement and go beyond the superficial geology. 47

1 Introduction 49
50

The gamma spectrometric method considers the natural decay of K, equivalent Th and U 51
(eTh and eU, respectively) and maps these element’s distribution spatially. The method has a 52
broad range of applications, such as: identifying outcropping points of igneous intrusions 53
[Ribeiro, 2014], characterization of undifferentiated intrusions [Ulbrich et al., 2009], mineral 54
prospecting [Fornazzari Neto and Ferreira, 2003; Carrino et al., 2007], study of impact craters 55
[Vasconcelos et al., 2012], environmental studies [Conceição and Bonotto, 2003], oil exploration 56
[Saunders et al., 1987; Lüning and Kolonic, 2003], study of hydrothermal alteration zones 57
[Biondi et al., 2001] and study of radioactive accidents impact [IAEA, 2003]. 58

Although the limited penetration in the first dozens of centimeters, gamma-rays are the 59
most penetrating form of radiation available. The shallow reach makes the gamma-spectrometry 60
a reliable source of data for near-surface geophysical studies. Large scale structural analyses 61
[Nóbrega et al. 2011; Ribeiro et al. 2013], mineral, oil and gas exploration [Saunders et al. 1987; 62
1993, 1994], astrophysical phenomena [Maziviero et al. 2013; Bose et al. 2013] and 63
environmental monitoring [Sanderson et al. 2004; Rachkovskij and Revunova 2011] are only a 64
few of the fields which the gamma-ray spectrometry has been successfully applied over the last 65
eighty years.66

Several minerals of economic interest (such as Au, Zn, Ag, Cu) do not present a strong 67
geophysical signature, but are associated with specific geological processes (such as 68
hydrothermal activity) and thus techniques which can indicate the geological process can provide 69
an important vector for exploration. For example, Ostrovsky [1975] highlights the antagonism in 70
K and eTh behaviors under this activity, and this characteristic was then used by several authors 71
to propose different techniques to enhance the hydrothermal signature in radiometric data, such 72
as F parameter [Gnojek and Prichystal, 1985]. The correct application of F factor techniques can 73
provide an important tool to optimize the exploration of hydrothermal deposits. 74

Filtering parameters (leveling and microleveling - Hogg, 1979; Paterson and Reeves,75
1985; Urquhart, 1988; Minty, 1991] and gridding techniques (such as minimum curvature and 76
kriging - Briggs, 1974; Hansen, 1993] have a direct influence on the final map and can introduce 77
pseudo-anomalies not related with geological structures. Although the correct application of 78
these procedures is a make or break moment for gamma spectroscopy, it is not easy to find 79
