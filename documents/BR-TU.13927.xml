Abstract

The aim of this work was to determine the composition of the fish assemblage of Passa Cinco stream and verify changes 
in their structure on the altitudinal gradient. Six samples were performed at five different sites in Passa Cinco stream 
(from the headwater, at order two, to its mouth, at order six), using an electric fishery equipment and gill nets in May, 
July, September and November of 2005 and January and March of 2006. The indices of Shannon’s diversity, Pielou’s 
evenness and Margalef’s richness were quantified separately considering the different fishery equipment (nets versus 
electric fishery equipment). An ANOVA was used to compare samples collected in relation to values of abundance, 
diversity, evenness and richness. The representativeness of the species was summarised by their average values of 
abundance and weight. We captured 5082 individuals distributed into 61 species. We observed a trend of increasing 
diversity, richness and evenness of species from site 1 to 3, with further decrease in sites 4 and 5. The values found 
for habitat diversity also followed this pattern. Significant differences were found for all three indices considering the 
electric fishery samples. For individuals caught with nets, only the richness index showed a significant difference. 
Characidium aff. zebra was an important species in the headwater and transition sites and Hypostomus strigaticeps 
in middle-lower course sites. Despite the small extension of the Passa Cinco stream, environments structurally well 
defined were evidenced by the species distribution and assemblage composition along the gradient.

Keywords: ichthyofauna, species diversity, altitudinal gradient, river continuum concept.

Resumo

O objetivo desse trabalho foi determinar a composição da assembleia de peixes do Rio Passa Cinco, além de verificar 
alterações em sua estrutura em função do gradiente altitudinal. Foram realizadas seis amostragens em cinco pontos 
distintos no Rio Passa Cinco (contemplando trechos de ordem dois, três, quatro, cinco e seis), fazendo uso de pesca 
elétrica e redes de espera, nos meses de maio, julho, setembro e novembro de 2005 e janeiro e março de 2006. Os 
índices de diversidade de Shannon, equidade de Pielou e riqueza de Margalef foram quantificados separadamente, 
considerando as diferentes artes de pesca (redes versus pesca elétrica). Foi utilizada a ANOVA para comparar os 
pontos de coleta quanto aos valores médios de abundância, diversidade, equidade e riqueza. A representatividade das 
espécies foi resumida pelos seus valores médios de abundância e peso. Foram capturados 5082 indivíduos distribuídos 
em 61 espécies. Foi observada uma tendência de aumento de diversidade, riqueza e equidade das espécies do ponto 1 
ao 3, com posterior queda nos pontos 4 e 5, indo ao encontro com os valores de diversidade de habitat, que também 
seguiram esse padrão. Foram encontradas diferenças significativas para os três índices considerando as amostras de 
pesca elétrica. Para os indivíduos capturados com redes, apenas o índice de riqueza apresentou diferença significativa. 
Characidium aff. zebra foi uma espécie importante nos trechos de cabeceira e transição, e Hypostomus strigaticeps 
nos trechos de médio-baixo curso. Apesar da pequena extensão do Rio Passa Cinco, ambientes estruturalmente bem 
definidos foram evidenciados pela distribuição das espécies e pela composição da assembleia ao longo do gradiente.

Palavras-chave: ictiofauna, diversidade de espécies, gradiente altitudinal, conceito do rio contínuo.

1. Introduction

Fish distribution in an environment is rarely caused 
by a single factor. Changes in the fish species composition 
from the headwaters to the lower parts is a common 
phenomenon and conceptual models based on temperate 
rivers seek to explain the mechanisms responsible for these 
processes (Matthews, 1998). Geomorphology is an important 
factor affecting the structure of fish communities in lotic 
environments (Allan, 1997), because from the headwaters 
to the mouth, the river goes through different terrain 
features, leading to changes in limnological characteristics 
and structural environment.

According to the river continuum concept (Vannote et al., 
1980), we expect a gradual increase in species richness 
along the gradient, and the area of the middle section as 
the most diverse. These changes usually are associated 
with habitat changes along the gradient (Gorman and Karr, 
1978). Matthews and Styron (1981) also suggested that 
the physical and chemical conditions in the headwaters 
are more stressful than in the lower portions, so that few 
fish species can colonize these areas.

Spatial patterns of species distribution have been 
addressed in several studies (Uieda, 1984; Garutti, 1988; 
Uieda and Barreto, 1999; Silvano et al., 2000; Mazzoni and 
Lobón-Cerviá, 2000; Uieda and Uieda, 2001; Pavanelli and 
Caramaschi, 2003; Castro et al., 2003; Súarez and Petrere, 
2003; Súarez and Petrere, 2005; Castro et al., 2004; Casatti, 
2005; Braga and Andrade, 2005; Cetra and Petrere, 2006) 
that, in general, reported an increase in species diversity 
since the headwaters to the mouth in fish communities at 
different locations. The relationship between habitat and 
community composition was presented by Montag et al. 
(1997), Benedito-Cecilio et al. (2004) and Gomiero and 
Braga (2006), which showed the correlations between 
habitat diversity and general conditions in the environment.

Among the main patterns of longitudinal variation 
in stream fishes, there are the species additions and 
replacements (Gilliam et al., 1993; Petry and Schultz, 
2006). Species additions are generally correlated with 
less severe environmental gradients, leading to smooth 
changes in abiotic and/or structural factors, while the 
species replacements occur as a result of abrupt changes in 
stream geomorphology or are related to abiotic conditions 
(Balon and Stewart, 1983; Winemiller and Leslie, 1992; 
Edds, 1993; Jackson et al., 2001; Wilkison and Edds, 
2001; Ferreira and Petrere, 2009).

The Passa Cinco stream is one of the main rivers of the 
Corumbataí river sub-basin, that belongs to the Piracicaba 
river basin, one of the last options to provide good water 
quality to several municipalities. Situated next to major 
urban, agricultural, technological and scientific centres of 
southeastern Brazil, it has been degraded over a century, 
through soil use and occupancy, and by excessive withdrawal 
of water for human consumption and agriculture. Given 
the regional importance of these water bodies, the aim 
of this study was to determine the composition of the 
fish assemblages in Passa Cinco stream and measure the 
changes in their structure along the longitudinal gradient.

2. Material and Methods

This study was accomplished in the Passa Cinco 
stream, with headwaters localised in the Serra da Cachoeira 
a component of the complex of Serra de Itaqueri, in the 
municipal district of Itirapina. The drainage area of Passa 
Cinco stream is 525 km2, covering about 60 km from its 
headwaters (with about 1000 m) to its confluence with 
the Corumbataí river (to 480 m) (Garcia et al., 2004). 
Currently, it has 51.72% of its area occupied by pastures, 
14.13% by sugar cane, 15.67% by native forest and 0.74% 
by savanna (Valente and Vettorazzi, 2002).

Six samplings were accomplished at five different sites 
in Passa Cinco stream, contemplating sections of order two, 
three, four, five and six, according to the Strahler (1952) 
classification, with the following geographic coordinates: 
site 1 (order 2) - 22° 23’ 36” S and 47° 53’ 08” W, site 2 
(order 3) - 22° 22’ 10” S and 47° 51’ 22” W, site 3 (order 
4) - 22° 21’ 63” S and 47° 48’ 48” W, site 4 (order 5) 
- 22° 24’ 74” S and 47° 43’ 34” W and site 5 (order 6) - 
22° 30’ 97” S and 47° 39’ 49” W in the months of May, 
July, September and November of 2005 and January and 
March of 2006 (Figures 1 and 2).

In each sample site, the predominant substrate type was 
recorded, as well as presence/absence of riparian vegetation, 
degree of shading, type of current and mean depth, as 
shown by Rondineli and Braga (2009). From these data, 
the habitat heterogeneity at each site was estimated using 
the Shannon diversity index (Gorman and Karr, 1978).

The fishery equipment used was electric fishery and 
gill nets. The electric fishery equipment (which consists 
of a generator that provides power - 110 V - for a rectifier 
current that has the capacity to increase the voltage - up to 
1500 V - and reduce the amperage - to 2 A) was used in 
the first three sites (1, 2 and 3). In these sites we performed 
a downstream-upstream pass at 50 m stretches without 
using contention nets. Gill nets (with mesh sizes varying 
from 3 to 9 cm between adjacent knots) were used in 
sites 3, 4 and 5. The sequence of gill nets was determined 
at random and placed in the afternoon (between 15 and 
18 hours) remaining until the following morning. After 
each collection, fish were put into plastic bags, fixed in 10% 
formalin for 2 days and then transferred to 70% ethanol 
until the analysis was accomplished. In the laboratory, the 
fishes were identified to species level, measured for total 
length (cm) and weighed (g). Voucher specimens were 
deposited in the Ichthyology Laboratory, Department of 
Zoology of the Universidade Estadual Paulista, in Rio Claro.

The indexes of Shannon’s diversity, Pielou’s evenness 
and Margalef’s richness were calculated for each sample site, 
separating the individuals captured by electric fishery from 
those captured by gill nets. To determine mean differences, 
ANOVAs were performed for each index to compare the 
sites sampled with the same fishery equipment (P1, P2 
and P3 - electric fishery and P3, P4 and P5 - gill nets).

The representativeness of the species were summarised 
by their mean values of abundance (N

3. Results

The substrate type changed gradually from site 1 to site 
5, the marginal vegetation (presence of grasses along the 
streams bank) occurred in all sampling sites, except for site 
1. The degree of shading decreased from the headwater to 
the mouth. The types of predominant current were: riffle 
in site 1, riffle and run in site 2, riffle, run and pool in site 
3 and run in sites 4 and 5. The mean depth increased from 
upstream to downstream (Table 1 and Figure 2). Site 3 
showed the highest diversity of habitats, followed by sites 
5 and 4 (Figure 3).

We captured 5082 individuals belonging to 61 species. 
Characidium aff. zebra was the most abundant species 
(Table 2). The number of individuals, species richness and 
the indexes of Shannon’s diversity, Margalef’s richness 
and Pielou’s evenness are shown in Table 3 for each site 
and fishing gear. The largest catches occurred in sites 3, 2 
and 1 sampled with electric fishery. The greatest richness 
and diversity were obtained in site 3, regardless of the 
fishing gear used. The evenness index values for all sites 
were around 0.8.

For sites 1 to 3 (electric fishery), the ANOVA showed 
significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.001, Table 4) in the indexes 
of richness, diversity and evenness. So we can accept that 
the Shannon diversity changed due to variation in either 
richness and evenness. For sites 3 to 5 (gill nets), only the 
richness index differed significantly (p = 0.047, Table 4).

Figure 4 presents the mean values, standard errors and 
95% confidence intervals for the indexes of diversity, richness 
and evenness as well as for the number of individuals in 
the five sampling sites, considering separately the sites 
sampled with electric fishery (sites 1, 2 and 3) and gillnets 
(sites 3, 4 and 5). An increase in diversity, evenness and 
richness can be found from site 1 to site 3. Moreover, a 
decrease in richness was found from site 3 to site 5, with 
the lowest value found in site 4. Regarding the number of 
individuals, there is a greater abundance in places where 
electric fishery was used. However, the fishery equipment 
had more subtle effects on the indexes of diversity, evenness 
and richness, as shown in site 3, the only one in which it 
was possible to apply the two techniques.

When species composition was analysed in terms of 
mean weight and mean abundance per sample, it is possible 
to see which will best represent the sampled sites. When 
considering only the individuals captured with electric 
fishery Characidium aff. zebra, Trichomycterus sp.1, 
Imparfinis mirini and Cetopsorhamdia iheringi

4. Discussion

The Passa Cinco stream has a steep gradient, given 
its location in the cuestas of São Pedro and Analândia. In 
the headwaters, the water flow is faster, and the stream is 
more shallow and narrow. These characteristics directly 
influence the substrate composition. In such places, the 

rocks are slightly larger and little suspended matter or 
background particulates are verified. All these features 
will be inverted along the channel. The large amount of 
water received in a short time, resulting from heavy rains 
in summer, makes the environment very susceptible to 
runoff, that quickly raises the water level. The substrate, 
depth and current are some of the most important physical

aspects in determining the distribution of stream fishes 
(Gorman and Karr, 1978; Argermeier and Karr, 1983). 
The combination of each aspects of these environmental 
characteristics produces a mosaic of microhabitats that 
changes along the gradient according to the physical 
conditions, which requires adjustments in the biological 
communities living there (Vannote et al., 1980).

In São Paulo state, the Alto Paraná system includes the 
major rivers and contains 38 families and 310 species of fish 
described (Langeani et al., 2007). In association with these 
major rivers, there is a large number of headwater streams 
inhabited mainly by species of small fishes with restricted 

geographic distributions, such as Bryconamericus turiuba, 
Astyanax bockmanni and Corumbataia cuestae. The Passa 
Cinco stream is one of these streams with large numbers 
of small-sized species, some with restricted distributions.

Considering species diversity, richness and evenness, 
there was an increase from site 1 to 3, with further decrease 
in sites 4 and 5, agreeing with the values of the habitat’s 
diversity. These patterns are not due exclusively to the 
fishery equipment employed, since site 3 was sampled 
with different equipments. In this site, all values had 
comparable magnitudes except number of individuals, 
which was remarkably higher in the electric fishery sites.

individuals caught in site 3, considering the individuals

Composition and structure of fish assemblage from Passa Cinco stream

The ANOVA confirmed the increasing pattern of diversity, 
evenness and richness from site 1 to 3.

For individuals caught with nets, significant differences 
were observed only for the richness index. This was 
because sites 4 and 5 had the lowest number of species. 
The upstream reaches had lower habitat diversity than the 
downstream ones (Uieda and Barreto, 1999), which may 
explain the common pattern of higher species richness 
at lower portions (Gorman and Karr, 1978). Harrel et al. 
(1967) apud Peres-Neto (1995) suggest that an increase 
in species diversity along the river course can occur not 
only due to an increase in suitable habitats, but also a 
decrease in environmental fluctuations. The more severe 
and variable conditions in the headwaters requires from 
the organisms specific adaptations and higher energy to 
move against the current and to lessen the likelihood of 
being swept downstream (Allan, 1997). In more stable 
sites downstream, where the current is slower or even at 
a standstill, less energy expenditure is necessary from the 
individuals to stay in their positions (Allan, 1997).

Although there are fewer species in headwaters sites, 
there are larger populations, whereas in the downstream 
sections, the number of species increases and their population 
densities decrease. The species abundance distribution 
becomes more homogeneous leading to a higher evenness. 
This pattern can be seen for sites 1 to 3 (electric fishery) and 
sites 3 to 4 (gillnets). The same patterns would be expected 
following the increase in water volume (Garutti, 1988), but 
in this case, it would be necessary that the environment had 
a variety of physical structures to provide suitable habitats 
(Gorman and Karr, 1978; Argermeier and Karr, 1983). 
On the other hand, when the physical structures inside 
the stream channel are simplified, the increase in water 
volume can lead to an environmental homogenisation, as 
was observed for sites 4 to 5 in the Passa Cinco Stream.

 Besides the occurrence and number of individuals, the 
species importance can also be defined by weight. These three 
additional measures provide different information about the 
fish assemblage (Ferreira, 2007). When considering only the 
species captured with electric fishery, Characidium aff. zebra 
was the most important species in the first three sample 
sites, occurring in large numbers and high weight. In 
addition to C. aff. zebra, other species were important 
for these sites (Trichomycterus sp.1, Imparfinis mirini, 
Cetopsorhamdia iheringi, Bryconamericus stramineus, 
B. turiuba, Apereiodon ibitiensis, Parodon nasus e 
Hypostomus strigaticeps). Headwater stream fishes from 
different families have morphological traits that allow 
them to better explore these environments (Braga, 2004). 
When considering individuals caught with nets (middle-
lower portions), H. strigaticeps was the most important 
species in site 3, and remained important downstream, 
joining Odontostilbe aff. microcephala, Astyanax sp.1 and 
A. altiparanae. We suggest that the species mean abundance 
and weight are more or less related to population densities 
at each site. If so, we agree with Mazzoni (1998) that the 
structural components of the stream channel promote 
differential resource availability along the longitudinal 
gradient that, in turn, are correlated to these densities.

5. Conclusions

Considering the number of individuals and biomass, 
as well the changes in diversity, evenness and richness, it 
was found that, despite the short size of the Passa Cinco 
stream, the environments are well defined, and structured in 
headwater, transition (medium-low) and mouth portions. This 
was evidenced by the species distribution and assemblage 
composition along the gradient.
