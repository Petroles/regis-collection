ABSTRACT. The temporal variability of benthic macrofauna on Cassino beach, southernmost Brazil, was studied for a period of one
year (June 2004 to May 2005) based on  monthly sampling. Three sites were selected distant 50m from each other. At each site, 3
transects were established, 2m equidistant from one another. Each transect extended from the base of the primary dunes to the inner surf
zone at approximately 1m in depth, with 7 or 8 sampling levels. Within transects, the distance between the levels was 20m until the upper
swash zone, from which distance was 10m until the 1-meter isobath. The temporal variation in the abundance of benthic macrofauna
observed in the present study can be attributed to (1) the positive effects of the recruitment peaks and migration of particular species to
the swash zone and (2) negative effects of the migration of some species to deeper waters, as well (3) as mortality through natural causes
(stranding and action of predators) and (4) human causes (harvesting and vehicle transit). We attribute the expressive abundance increase
of benthic macrofauna to recruitment. The stranding, that is, the trapping of the organisms on the upper parts of the beach, is likely the
main cause of abrupt drops in benthic macrofauna abundance.

RESUMO. Variabilidade temporal da macrofauna bentônica na praia do Cassino, extremo sul do Brasil. A variabilidade
temporal da macrofauna bentônica na praia do Cassino, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, foi estudada durante o período de um ano (junho 2004
a maio de 2005) com base em coletas mensais. Escolheram-se três locais, distantes 50m um do outro, sendo que em cada local foram
fundadas três transversais 2m eqüidistantes. Cada transversal se estendeu desde a base das dunas primárias até aproximadamente 1m de
profundidade no infralitoral. A distância dos níveis de coleta em cada transversal foi de 20m até o limite superior da zona de varrido, a
partir do qual a distância foi de 10m. A variação temporal da abundância da macrofauna bentônica, constatada no presente trabalho pode
ser atribuída a (1) efeitos positivos decorrentes dos picos de recrutamento e migração de determinadas espécies para a zona de varrido e
a (2) efeitos negativos como a migração de algumas espécies para águas mais profundas, a (3) mortalidade por causas naturais (embancamento
e ação dos predadores) e (4) antrópicas (extrativismo e o trânsito de veículos). Ao recrutamento é atribuída a responsabilidade pela
expressiva elevação da abundância da macrofauna bentônica. Já o embancamento, isto é, o aprisionamento dos organismos nas partes
superiores da praia, provavelmente seja a principal causa das abruptas quedas nas abundâncias do macrozoobentos.

PALAVRAS-CHAVE. Praias arenosas, macrofauna bentônica, variabilidade temporal, praia do Cassino.

The distribution, abundance and diversity of beach
macrofauna have been related to different physical factors,
from which the most important are wave action, the size
of sand grains and the slope of the beach (MCLACHLAN,
1983). The availability and search for food, dispersion
and settling, modes of locomotion and aggregation
patterns, intra- and interspecific competition and the
effects of predation may also influence the structure of
benthic macrofauna communities (KNOX, 2000).

Several studies that characterize benthic
assemblages on sandy beaches are restricted to a short
sampling period from which it is not possible to assess
the temporal variation of benthic macrofauna (JARAMILLO,
1978; MCLACHLAN, 1990; DEFEO et al., 1992a; JARAMILLO
&amp;amp; MCLACHLAN, 1993; BORZONE et al., 1996; JAMES &amp;amp;
FAIRWEATHER, 1996; HERNANDEZ et al., 1998).

The temporal variability of benthic macrofauna
around the world has been  related to seasonality as well
as periods of upwelling (DEXTER, 1979), reproductive
activities of the more abundant species (DEXTER, 1984)
and changes in temperature (LEBER, 1982). However,
JARAMILLO et al. (1996b) observed that abundance
patterns were generally not linked to physical factors,
except for one species, whose temporal variation was
related to beach morphodynamics.

In Brazil, VELOSO et al. (1997) reported in the state
of Rio de Janeiro, that the temporal variation of benthic
macrofauna was subject to reproductive activities and
recruitment, and that these variations were not related to
non-biological factors. VELOSO &amp;amp; CARDOSO (2001)
compared three beaches, and observed that one of them
exhibited more temporal variation than the others. VELOSO
et al. (2003) did not verify significant differences in
macrofauna density and biomass on fifteen beaches
studied between winter and summer. In the state of Paraná,
Brazil, a year-long follow-up by SOUZA &amp;amp; GIANUCA (1995)
indicated that the variation in benthic macrofauna
abundance was mainly due to recruitment, whereas
changes in the richness of the species were caused by
the organisms that recruit but did not remain on the beach.
In another year-long study on a sandy beach in Paraná,
BORZONE &amp;amp; SOUZA (1997) verified a striking seasonality in
macrofauna abundance due to the recruitment of
dominant species and variability in the occurrence of the
organisms.

GIANUCA (1983, 1987) and BORZONE &amp;amp; GIANUCA
(1990) analyzed the composition and distribution of
benthic macrofauna at distinct levels on beaches in the
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. However, no

studies have been carried out with quantitative sampling
replicated between the supralittoral zone and the inner
surf zone with a focus on the temporal variation of benthic
macrofauna on sandy beaches in the southernmost region
of Brazil.

Considering the lack of information of this nature
for the region, this study aimed to analyze the temporal
variation of the benthic macrofauna assemblage during
one year on Cassino Beach, southernmost Brazil.

MATERIAL  AND  METHODS

The sandy beaches of southernmost Brazil are
exposed, slightly declined, with fine sand, moderate to
strong wave action and well-developed surf zone,
presenting dissipative to intermediate morphodynamic
states (GIANUCA, 1983; BORZONE &amp;amp; GIANUCA, 1990; GARCIA
&amp;amp; GIANUCA, 1998). The astronomical tides have a
microtidal regime, and meteorological factors are the main
cause of variations in water level (CALLIARI &amp;amp; KLEIN, 1993).
The site of present study is located on Cassino beach,
Rio Grande, state of Rio Grande do Sul, 17.2 Km to the
south of the western jetty (052º14’04”W, 32º15’55”S)
(Fig. 1).

The sampling of benthic macrofauna was
performed monthly for a period of 12 months (June 2004
to May 2005). Three sites were selected at a distance of
50m from one another. At each site, three transects were

established, 2m equidistant from one another. Each
transect extended from the base of the primary dunes to
the inner surf zone at approximately 1m in depth, with
between 7 and 8 sampling levels. Within transects, the
distance between the levels was 20m until the upper
swash zone, from which distance was 10m until the 1-
meter isobath (Fig. 1). The smaller distance between levels
on the lower parts of the beach was due to the greater
number of species and organisms that tend to concentrate
in this area (GIANUCA, 1983; DEGRAER et al., 2003).

Biological samples were obtained using a core of
20cm in diameter (0.03 m2), sunk into the sediment to a
depth of 20cm, as most of the macrofauna abundance is
found in the first 15-20cm of depth in the sediment (BALLY,
1983). Samples were sieved with a nylon mesh with a
0.5mm pore opening, and the material collected was fixed
in a 10% formaldehyde solution. In the laboratory, the
organisms were quantified and identified to the smallest
possible taxonomic level under a stereomicroscope.

A monthly quantification was also performed on
the number of burrows of the ghost crab, Ocypode
quadrata (Fabricius, 1787), which were mainly located in
the supralittoral zone. Starting from the bases of the
primary dunes, 100m lines parallel to the beach were
established. These lines were anchored in the area of
occurrence of the O. quadrata burrows at a distance of
5m from one another. Through the continuous
arrangement of 1x1m grid, the density of burrows along
each line was recorded.

Samples belonging to each transect were totaled
on a monthly basis for the analysis of the temporal
variation of the benthic macrofauna and with the aim of
avoiding disturbances to the spatial variation.

Regarding the bivalve Mesodesma mactroides
Deshayes, 1854, individuals with a shell length between
1 and 10mm were defined as recruits; those with a shell
length between 10.1 - 42.9mm were defined as juveniles;
the ones with a shell length greater than 43mm were
defined as adults, according to MASELLO &amp;amp; DEFEO (1986)
and DEFEO et al. (1992b). Recruits, juveniles and adults
of the bivalve Donax hanleyanus Philippi, 1847 were
defined respectively as individuals of 1-5mm, 5.5-15mm
and &gt;15mm in length, following DEFEO &amp;amp; DE ALAVA (1995).

Seasonal sediment samples were taken at each of
the levels of the three sites. The proportions of sand, silt
and clay in the sediment were determined through sieving
(&gt; 0.062mm in diameter) and pipetting (&amp;lt;0.062mm in
diameter), following procedures described by SUGUIO
(1973). During the monthly sampling, wave height (visual
observations), average wave period (digital chronometer)
and salinity (optical refractometer) were recorded, along
with air and water temperatures (mercury thermometer).
Hourly data on wind speed and direction were provided
by the Barra de Rio Grande Pilotage Authority.

To characterize the seasonal morphodynamics
state of the beach, the dimensionless Dean’s parameter
11=Hb/WsT was employed, where Hb is the wave height
of the surf, Ws is the rate of sediment decantation and T
is the wave period. The       values &amp;lt;1 represent reflective

beaches; intermediate beaches are classified within the
1 to 6 interval; and dissipative beaches present       values
&gt; 6 (SHORT &amp;amp; WRIGHT, 1983).

In order to analyze the temporal variation of the
benthic macrofauna throughout the year, statistical
analyses were performed on the PRIMER v5 program
(Plymouth Routines In Multi Ecological Research) using
quantitative data (CLARKE &amp;amp; WARWICK, 1994). From the
sum of the samples of each transect, a similarity
spreadsheet was drawn up (Q mode) using the Bray-
Curtis dissimilarity index. Multi-Dimensional Scaling
(MDS) analysis was then performed and the groups
determined by grouping of the samples and analysis of
the graphics that showed the temporal variability of the
populations abundance. The difference between groups
was tested through the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM),
at a significance level of p&lt;5% and R statistic &gt;0.5.
Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) was used to
determine the contribution of the principal species in the
formation of the groups.

The monthly variability of the abundance of the
eleven most important taxa was compared. The Shannon-
Weaver diversity index (H’) and the Pielou evenness index
(J’) were also determined for each month.

RESULTS

Minimum salinity was recorded during July (29)
and maximums were recorded in January (36) and March

(36). Water temperature of the inner surf zone following
the same tendency as air temperature, with minimums
recorded in July (water=14º C; air=15º C) and May
(water=13.5º C; air=15º C), and the maximum recorded in
January (water=26º C; air=30º C). Wave height presented
higher values in November (1.5m) and July (1m), whereas
the average wave period ranged from 8 to 11.9 seconds.
Average declivity of the beach was 1.7º throughout the
sampling period.

From the     values, it was determined that the
b e a c h  studied presented an intermediate stage
throughout the four seasons of the year (Tab. I). The
sediment type for most of the area was classified as fine
sand, but in some occasions medium sand predominated
on the lower part of the beach (Tab. I).

The NE wind was the most frequent among the
sampling periods. The S wind was not very frequent, but
reached high velocities, especially among the sampling
periods of October – November and February – March
(Tab. II).

A total of 28 taxa were collected. January had the
highest number of taxa and July had the lowest, but the
latter presented a higher diversity index (H’). The class
Crustacea presented the highest number of taxa, followed
by the class Polychaeta (Tab. III).

The MDS analysis indicated the tendency to
formation of three sample groups: the first formed by
samples obtained in June, July, August, September and
May (6, 7, 8, 9 and 5); the second by samples of March

and April (3 and 4); and the third by samples of  December
and February (12 and 2). The remaining sampling periods
were not grouped (Fig. 2).

ANOSIM analysis revealed significant differences
between all the groups and remaining periods (Tab. IV).

The polychaeta Scolelepis gaucha (Orensanz &amp;amp;
Gianuca, 1974) characterized the December/February
group, as well as the November and January periods.
The difference in abundance of this species was the main
reason for the separation of this group from the other
months. The May-September and March/April groups
were respectively formed mostly by the amphipod
Platyischnopidae indet. and the bivalve D. hanleyanus.
The amphipod Bathyporeiapus sp. strongly influenced
the samples grouping of the October period (Tab. V).

Scolelepis gaucha was the most abundant taxon
throughout the study period, followed by M. mactroides,
Bathyporeiapus sp., and D. hanleyanus (Tab. III).

Temporal variability of the abundance of populations
indicated that S. gaucha, M. mactroides, Bathyporeiapus

Temporal variability of benthic macrofauna on Cassino beach...

DISCUSSION

Fluctuations in the total abundance of organisms
throughout the twelve months of sampling were strongly
influenced by periods of recruitment. The two main
occurrence peaks, however, were due to the high number
of adults and juveniles of the polychaeta S. gaucha in
the mesolittoral zone.

Scolelepis gaucha was the most abundant species,
being numerically dominant between November and
February and with abundance peaks in November and
January. SANTOS (1991) verified that S. gaucha was the
most abundant polychaeta in the mesolittoral zone of
Cassino Beach, reaching a density of up to 100,000m-2 in
spring and early summer. BARROS et al. (2001) also
observed the dominance of this genus in Paraná, where
Scolelepis squamata (Müller,1806) reached around 70%
of macrofauna abundance on two sandy beaches in winter
and summer.  BORZONE et al. (1996), in summer, and
DEGRAER et al. (2003), at the end of summer and early fall,
observed that S. squamata was the most dominant species
on several beaches.

NEVES et al.

Mesodesma mactroides had its abundance peak in
January, and also had a high number of organisms in
October, December and April due to recruitment of this
bivalve. DEFEO et al. (1992b) identified two recruitment
periods for the species: one between November and
January; and the other between February and April.

For the high abundance of M. mactroides in
October, there was a contribution from juveniles, which
up until then were practically absent from the beach.
CASCARÓN (1959) stated that most M. mactroides juveniles
and adults are concentrated in the infralittoral zone during
winter, and in spring there is a migration to the mesolittoral
zone, where they remain through summer and early fall.
During research carried out with M. mactroides on the coast
of Mar del Plata, Argentina, in the 1970s, it was also observed
migratory movement of the species in this period (R. Capítoli,
pers. comm.). Information obtained from fishermen who
extract yellow clam from Cassino beach confirms an increase
in the amount of juvenile and adult yellow clam between
spring and summer in the swash zone (pers. comm.).

The expressive occurrence of Bathyporeiapus sp.
strongly influenced the macrofauna abundance in
October. In the state of Paraná, BORZONE &amp;amp; SOUZA (1997)
observed that Bathyporeiapus ruffoi Escofet, 1971
presented high abundance in September and November,
but October was not sampled in the study. This species
was well represented in stations of the lower mesolittoral
zone, extending its distribution to the infralittoral zone
with high abundance (BORZONE &amp;amp; SOUZA, 1997). In the
USA at 34º40’N of latitude, LEBER (1982) observed that
two species of amphipods predominated in early winter
at milder temperatures. In Florida, USA, CHARVAT et al.
(1990) observed that amphipods were more important in
the infralittoral than the mesolittoral zone, suggesting
that higher temperatures exclude amphipods from the
upper parts of the beach.

Donax haleyanus recruits were largely responsible
for the formation of the March/April group. On
Uruguayan beaches, DEFEO &amp;amp; DE ALAVA (1995) verified
recruitment peaks between February and May, coinciding
with the finding of the present study, whereas CARDOSO
&amp;amp; VELOSO (2003), on a tropical beach, found greater
abundances of this species in fall and winter. It is
noteworthy that the recruitment peak for D. hanleyanus
came after the recruitment peak for M. mactroides. In a
study carried out in Uruguay, an inverse relationship was
found between the recruitments of D. hanleyanus and
the presence of M. mactroides juveniles and adults (de
Alava, 1993 apud DE F E O, 1996b). Indications of
competition between these species are reinforced by the
fact that the distinct class sizes of D. hanleyanus and M.
mactoides recruits and juveniles occur at similar depths
in the sediment (DEFEO et al., 1986), thereby increasing
the chances of competition for space.

The formation of the group that encompassed the
months of May, June, July, August and September was
due to the frequency of Platyischnopidae and, especially,
the low abundance of other taxa. There was an absence
of recruitments in this period, as well as the migration of
some species to deeper waters, contributing to the scarcity
of benthic macrofauna. LEBER (1982) observed that Donax
parvula Philippi, 1849 migrated to the infralittoral zone
during winter and CASCARÓN (1959) verified the same
tendency for M. mactroides.

Euzonus furciferus was the only species that
recruited during the period in which the lowest
abundance of benthic macrofauna occurred, with its peak
abundance concentrated in May. On Matadeiro beach,
in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, the population of E.
furciferus showed the main recruitment period between
May and August (pers. comm.), in agreement with the
findings of the present study. In Oregon, USA, KEMP

Temporal variability of benthic macrofauna on Cassino beach...

(1988) verified that Euzonus mucronata (Treadwell, 1914)
recruitment occurred in early summer. The difference of
approximately 13º more in latitude of the site in Oregon in
comparison to the studies carried out in southern Brazil
allows us to infer that the recruitment period of both species
occurs at times with quite similar temperatures.

One of the typical organisms from the supralittoral
zone, the crab O. quadrata, presented oscillations in the
density of burrows throughout the year, with no high
densities verified during the 12-months study period.
Furthermore, there were months in which no burrows were
encountered. During the study it was observed that wind
action could easily cover the burrows with sand, and the
low density could be a reflection of such a process. NEVES
&amp;amp; BEMVENUTI (2006) recorded this phenomenon studying
the distribution and abundance of O. quadrata burrows on
three beaches on the northern coast of state of Rio Grande
do Sul. ALBERTO &amp;amp; FONTOURA (1999), in the same state,
observed that variations in temperature, wind directions and
intensity, and the reach of the waves directly interfered in
the activities of O. quadrata, and in adverse conditions no
sign of the species is observed on the beach.

It was generally verified that most of the
recruitments of the several taxa mainly occurred in the
periods of spring and fall, thereby altering the abundance
of benthic macrofauna.

From a study carried out in the temperate region of
Cape Paterson, Victoria, Australia, HAYNES &amp;amp; QUINN (1995)
found a significant temporal variation in densities and
number of species, relating this occurrence with changes in
the densities of species common to the mesolittoral zone.
On a subtropical sand beach in Paraná, SOUZA &amp;amp; GIANUCA
(1995) observed that the overall abundance of macrofauna
was significantly higher in summer than in winter. VELOSO et
al. (2003), however, did not verify a significant difference in
benthic macrofauna density and biomass between the
periods of summer and winter on a tropical beach (state of
Rio de Janeiro). It is likely that the difference in latitude of
the beaches, with the subsequent variations in temperature,
is the main non-biological determinant in the seasonal
variation of benthic macrofauna.

The temporal variation revealed that there were abrupt
reductions in the abundance of diverse species of benthic
macrofauna generally 30 days after the occurrence of
abundance peaks. Donax hanleyanus was the only species
that maintained two consecutive abundance peaks (March
and April), but one month later, a striking reduction in the
number of individuals was verified.

There is a number of factors that may be responsible
for the abrupt drop in the abundance of taxa. One of these
factors is the predation pressure on the benthic macrofauna.
In a study carried out in the USA, the most obvious predators
on the beach were crabs, fish and birds. These predators
fed on the tidal migrants and were more abundant during
the summer months (LEBER, 1982). On Cassino Beach, many
species of fish fed on the benthic macrofauna in the surf
zone during the high tide, accompanied by crabs and
gastropods. At low tide, birds were the main predators, some
of which were residents and others were migrants (GIANUCA,
1983). The migration of some birds determines that the arrival
of flocks coincides with peak benthic macrofauna abundance
in southernmost Brazil (VOOREN, 1998).

The larger number of beach-goers and, consequently
greater transit of vehicles on the beach, especially during
the hotter months of the year, may also affect benthic

macrofauna recruits and juveniles abundance. On the Chilean
coast, JARAMILLO et al. (1996a) verified no significant effect
of the presence of humans on benthic macrofauna. However,
GIANUCA (1983) observed that a threat that affects the
populations of the mesolittoral zone, especially juveniles
and surface diggers, is the use of damp, compact sands by
all types of vehicles, including the trucks of fishermen.

The decrease in M. mactroides density soon after the
peak recorded in October may have been influenced by the
imprisonment of individuals on the upper parts of the beach.
Winds from the south, which occurred between the sampling of
October and November, with velocities of up to 23.7m/s-1,
elevated the sea level, causing the imprisonment of a high
number of M. mactroides specimens in the supralittoral zone.
In the study area, the incidence of southern winds can raise
the sea level by as much as 2m (BARLETTA &amp;amp; CALLIARI, 2003).
In Argentina, strong southern winds carry and deposit a
large number of organisms, without the possibility of their
returning to the lower parts of the beach. This phenomenon
commonly occurs with M. mactroides, making the return of
the species to the water impossible (RAMÍREZ et al., 2004).

DEFEO (1989) observed that M. mactroides is collected
by fishermen with shovels on the Uruguayan coast. The
collection of M. mactroides with the use of shovels causes
collateral damage to non-exploited classes, breaking their
shells and affecting the survival of juveniles due to
disturbances in the sediment (DEFEO, 1996a; BRAZEIRO &amp;amp;
DEFEO, 1999). This collection procedure is also used by
fishermen in southernmost Brazil, and the mortality of
individuals from all classes may be a consequence of this
type of activity.

Temporal variations in the benthic macrofauna
abundance on Cassino beach can be attributed to the
positive effect of recruitment peaks and the migration of
species to the swash zone, as well as the negative effects
of the migration of some species to deeper waters,
mortality by natural causes (stranding and action of
predators) and human activity (extracting and traffic of
vehicles). Among the positive effects, recruitment can
be considered the main determinant in the expressive
increases of benthic macrofauna abundance for most
organisms. Stranding, that is, the trapping of organisms
on the upper parts of the beach, is likely the main cause
for the abrupt drops in benthic macrofauna abundance
on sandy beaches in southernmost Brazil.

It was possible verify the monthly temporal
variability in the present study. Perhaps other patterns
could be observed depending on the samplings frequency.
