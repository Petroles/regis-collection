ABSTRACT 

The hydraulic performance of centrifugal pumps depends on several hydraulic dimensions 

of the pump, but most of them are not easily accessible. Therefore, the pump’s hydraulic 

performance always has to be informed by the pump manufacturer. Furthermore, in order to 

protect their intellectual property, manufacturers rarely share more detailed information about the 

pump hydraulics with the public. As a consequence, pump users and researchers don’t have 

access to all the data they possibly need. In literature, there are several proposed models based on 

fluid dynamic principles and experimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance 

of centrifugal pumps. Alternatively, it is also possible to calculate a pump’s performance with 

numerical simulation. However, the accuracy of such models is usually proportional to the 

number of necessary parameters – those of which may not be easily accessible, as stated before. 

In this work, a simple approach available in literature, based on fluid dynamic principles, that 

predicts a pump hydraulic performance with only a few accessible hydraulic dimensions, is 

validated with several experimental data. Eighty tests of different types of pumps, with a large 

range of specific speeds are considered. From this analysis, correlations among the coefficients of 

the model equation and the main hydraulic data of the pumps are proposed. Afterwards, several 

shut-off head prediction methods available in literature are analyzed in order to define the one 

that best predicts the shut-off head of the given tested data. Finally, for each pump type, the best 

combination of correlations and shut-off head prediction method are selected to reduce the error 

on the whole head curve prediction. Given all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective 

of this work is to present a method applicable to several pump types that easily provides a 

prediction of the whole head curve with reasonable error.

RESUMO 

A performance hidráulica de bombas centrífugas depende de várias entre suas dimensões 

hidráulicas, mas a maioria delas não é facilmente acessível. Por este motivo, a performance 

hidráulica da bomba deve sempre ser disponibilizada pelo seu fabricante. No entanto, para 

proteger sua propriedade intelectual, fabricantes raramente compartilham com o público 

informações mais detalhadas sobre a hidráulica da bomba. Como consequência, os usuários dos 

equipamentos e pesquisadores não têm acesso a todas as informações de que podem necessitar. 

Na literatura, há diversos modelos para a predição da performance hidráulica de bombas 

centrífugas, baseados nos princípios da fluidodinâmica e em dados experimentais. 

Alternativamente, é possível calcular a performance das bombas através de simulações 

numéricas. Entretanto, a precisão destes modelos é normalmente proporcional ao número de 

parâmetros envolvidos, os quais podem não ser de fácil acesso, como mencionado anteriormente. 

Neste trabalho, uma abordagem simples disponível na literatura, baseada nos princípios de 

fluidodinâmica, que prediz a performance hidráulica de bombas com poucas e acessíveis 

dimensões hidráulicas, é validada com uma grande variedade de dados experimentais. Os dados 

de oitenta testes de diferentes tipos de bomba, cobrindo uma ampla extensão de velocidades 

específicas, são considerados. A partir desta análise, correlações entre os coeficientes da equação 

do modelo e os principais dados hidráulicos das bombas são propostas. Em seguida, diversos 

métodos de predição da altura no shut-off disponíveis na literatura são analisados para que seja 

possível definir o que melhor prediz a altura no shut-off considerando os dados de teste. 

Finalmente, para cada tipo de bomba, a melhor combinação entre correlações e método de 

predição de altura no shut-off é selecionada para reduzir o erro na predição das curvas de altura 

completas. Dadas todas as premissas e simplificações, o objetivo deste trabalho é apresentar um 

método aplicável para diversos tipos de bomba que facilmente prediz a curva de altura com erro 

razoável.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Centrifugal pumps are turbo machines that provide energy increase to the fluid. They have 

a stationary casing, which can be a volute or diffusers, with one or more impellers inside, one or 

two bearing housings and a shaft, as shown in Figure 1. The impeller mounted on the shaft is 

driven via a coupling by a motor or turbine. The centrifugal force generated at the impellers is 

transformed into a static pressure increase to the flow. The fluid exiting the impeller is 

decelerated in the volute or diffuser in order to utilize the greatest possible part of the kinetic 

energy at the impeller outlet for increasing the static pressure. 

 

 

Figure 1 - Centrifugal pump. 

 

The flow energy is composed of kinetic energy, pressure and potential energy. In order to 

transport fluid from one place to another, pumps are used to provide a static pressure increase to 

the flow, which could be useful overcoming a height difference and long distances (pressure 

losses in the line). 



2 
 

As already mentioned, the stationary part around the impeller can be a diffuser or a volute. 

These are two different pump concepts, which have their applicability, advantages and 

disadvantages. In both cases, the pumps can have one or multiple stages. 

Centrifugal pumps are widely used in the industry. Some examples of segments that use 

centrifugal pumps are Oil &amp;amp; Gas (off-shore, distribution, refineries), power, water and 

wastewater, pulp and paper and general industry. 

The differential pressure provided by the pump (!?) is usually represented by its related 
head of elevation (H), where " is the fluid density and # is the acceleration due to gravity. 

$ = &amp;amp;'(?                        (1) 
This representation makes it possible to show the performance of a pump for fluids with 

different densities in just one curve. 

The pump hydraulic performance is defined by the head, shaft power, efficiency and NPSH 

curves versus flow rate. In Figure 2, the performance curves of a centrifugal pump are shown. 

 



3 
 

 

Figure 2 - Performance curves of a centrifugal pump. 

 

These curves are associated to just one pump model and represent the pump performance 

while pumping a liquid with low viscosity (similar to the water viscosity). Furthermore, these 

curves are related to just one impeller outlet diameter and rotation speed. 

The range of operation of a pump defines the maximum and minimum impeller outlet 

diameter and maximum and minimum flow rates for that model. 



4 
 

Usually, pumps are grouped in families. Each family represents a group of pumps with the 

same design concept, but in different sizes. When all the pump ranges are put together, a wide 

area of operation (flow versus head) is covered, as shown in Figure 3. 

 

 

Figure 3 – Operating range. 

 

The head and shaft power ( ? ) are measureable parameters and the efficiency ( ) ) is 
calculated according to the Equation (2), where Q is the flow rate: 

) = *+('                        (2) 
The operating point that provides the best efficiency at the maximum impeller outlet 

diameter is called BEP (best efficiency point). This is the operating condition for which the 

hydraulics have been developed. 

The specific speed is a characteristic number that represents the hydraulics and it is 

calculated based on the conditions of the BEP, according to the Equation (3), where - is the 
rotational speed: 

./ = 01*+2 3?                       (3) 
The hydraulic performance depends on several hydraulic dimensions of the pump. The 

main ones are listed below and presented in Figure 4:

Impeller: 	5, 65, ?5, 	7 and 	8 
Diffuser/volute: 9:, 6:, 	:, 9; and 6; 
 

 

Figure 4 – Main pump hydraulic dimensions. 

 

Usually the dimensions identified by the subscript “1” are related to the impeller leading 

edge, “2” to the impeller trailing edge, “3” to the diffuser or volute leading edge and “4” to the 

diffuser or volute trailing edge. The subscript “8” also indicates important dimensions in the 

volute throat. 

 

1.1 Motivation 

During the conception phase of a project, it may be necessary to estimate the performance 

of some of the equipment in order to assess the project cost and its viability. However, most 

pump hydraulic dimensions are not easily accessible. As a result, the pump hydraulic 



6 
 

performance always has to be informed by the pump manufacturer, who has designed the pump 

hydraulics. 

Furthermore, in order to protect their intellectual property, manufacturers rarely share more 

detailed information about the pump hydraulics with the public. As a consequence, pump users 

and researchers don’t have access to all the data they possibly need. 

In literature, there are several proposed models based on fluid dynamic principles and 

experimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of centrifugal pumps. 

Alternatively, it is also possible to calculate a pump’s performance with numerical simulation. 

However, the accuracy of such models is usually proportional to the number of necessary 

parameters – those of which may not be easily accessible, as stated before. 

Based on this scenario, it would be very useful to predict a pump’s hydraulic performance 

with only a few accessible hydraulic dimensions, so that the dependency on the manufacturer’s 

information would be reduced. Furthermore anyone would be able to predict the hydraulic 

performance of a pump with acceptable accuracy. 

 

1.2 Objectives 

Biazussi (2014) presented a simple single-phase approach (model), based on fluid dynamic 

principles, that defines the head versus flow rate curve. It is presented in Chapter 3. According to 

this approach, for fluids with low viscosity, the head curve is a quadratic function of the flow 

rate, as expected. Some assumptions and simplifications were considered, so that the model 

would only depend on a few accessible hydraulic dimensions and the performance would be 

predicted with reasonable error. 

One of the equation coefficients, ?7, is defined by accessible hydraulic dimensions of the 
pump. The other coefficients are adjusted by the model in order to reproduce the given tested 

data. Some tests were held in order to validate this model and also propose correlations among 

these coefficients and basic hydraulic data of the pumps.  

The results of the work were presented and were considered reliable for these few cases 

studied. However more experimental data was necessary to fully validate the model.  

 



7 
 

The current work uses Biazussi (2014)’s work as a starting point. The data from eighty tests 

was collected so that the aforementioned model could be validated and that its coverage could be 

defined. Several different types of centrifugal pumps with a large range of specific speeds were 

considered and are described in Chapter 4. 

In Chapter 5, the tested hydraulic performances were compared to the results provided by 

the model. Furthermore, the mentioned equation coefficients were plotted against the pump 

specific speed in order to analyze if there was a correlation among them. It was possible to find 

clear tendencies, even considering all the different types of pumps. 

Considering these tendencies, equations were proposed in order to make it possible to 

define the head curve against flow based only on the specific speed and main hydraulic 

dimensions of the pump, such as 	5, 65, ?5 and 	7. The correlation based curves were compared 
to the tested curves and the difference between them was analyzed. 

Afterwards, since an offset of the prediction of the head curve was observed in some cases, 

several shut-off head prediction methods available in literature were analyzed in order to define 

the one that best predicts the shut-off head of the given tested data.  

Finally, for each pump type, the best combination of correlations and shut-off head 

prediction method was selected to reduce the error on the whole head curve prediction. 

Given all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective of the current work is to 

present correlations applicable to several pump types that easily provides a prediction of the 

pump head curve with reasonable error.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

2.1 Dimensional analysis  

Dimensional analysis is used to represent all the parameters in a dimensionless way, so that 

it is possible to compare different scenarios. With regard to the pump performance, using 

dimensional analysis it is possible to compare performances considering different speeds or 

impeller outlet diameter, for instance. Gülich (2007) presents a detailed explanation of the 

dimensional analysis.  

The independent variables related to the pump performance are differential pressure (??) 
and shaft power (? ). These variables depend on the flow rate (Q), speed (-), impeller outlet 
diameter (	5), roughness (=), viscosity (&gt;) and density ("). Therefore: 

!? = ?7@A, 	5, -, ", &gt;, =C          ? = ?5@A, 	5, -, ", &gt;, =C                (4) 
Based on the dimensional analysis, the following dimensionless coefficients are defined: 

Flow coefficient: D* = *0??2                   (5) 
Head coefficient: D+ = &amp;amp;'(0???? ; D+ = ?:ED* , F, =/	5G               (6)

The parameter =/	5  is the relative roughness, which affects the pump efficiency. The

The dimensionless specific speed is represented as: 

P? = 1????2 3?                     (10)

2.2 One-dimensional calculation with velocity triangles 

The velocity of the fluid within the diffuser and the impeller can be understood with the 

help of the velocity triangle, which breaks down the fluid’s main velocity components in certain 

positions, as shown in Figure 5.  

In this analysis, some considerations need to be made: 

• The flow is permanent and one-dimensional; 

• The flow is uniform through the impeller; 

• Secondary flow is disregarded. 

 

 

Figure 5 – Impeller inlet and outlet velocity triangles (Biazussi, 2014). 

 

Similar to the hydraulic dimensions, the parameters related to the impeller leading edge are 

identified by the subscript “1” and the ones related to the impeller trailing edge by the subscript 

“2”. 

The flow velocity is defined by two components. The first one is the velocity tangent to the 

impeller vane w. The second one is the peripheral velocity, ? = -Q. Then the absolute flow 
velocity V is the vector sum of these two components. 



11 
 

RST = USST + ?ST                    (11) 
By balancing the moment of inertia, while admitting permanent flow and disregarding the 

effect of gravity, the power that the impeller exerts on the fluid can be formulated as:   

? = "A@-Q5R?5 ? -Q7R?7C                   (12) 
Given that ?? = X? - , the torque (X? ) can be written as: 
X? = "A@Q5R?5 ? Q7R?7C                  (13) 
In an ideal system where no losses are considered, ?? = "#A$. Thus, the ideal differential 

pressure provided by the impeller is represented by: 

!?
 = "@?5R?5 ? ?7R?7C                  (14) 
The equation above is called the Euler equation for turbo machines. It can be seen that the 

power, torque and differential head depend only on the peripheral velocities and the tangential 

component of the absolute velocities on the impeller inlet and outlet.  

If we consider that the flow has no tangential velocity on entering the impeller (R?7 = 0), 
and apply some geometric correlations based on the triangle velocities, the Euler equation can be 

written as: 

!?
 = "?55 Z1 ? * ??? [?5\??]???^                              (15) 
where, according to Figure 5, ?5 is the outlet angle of the impeller vane and 65 is the width 

of the impeller outlet. 

 

2.3 Pressure losses 

According to Gülich (2007), losses arise whenever a fluid flows through (or components 

move in) a machine. The useful power is therefore always smaller than the power supplied at the 

pump shaft, where the losses are dissipated into heat. The sources of loss are classified in the 

following groups: 

• Mechanical losses in bearings and shaft seals. Since these losses don’t cause fluid 

heat, they are considered external losses; 



12 
 

• Volumetric losses due to all leakages which are pumped by the impeller, including 

leakage through the annular seals, device for axial thrust balancing, balance holes 

and central balance devices; 

• Disk friction losses generated on rear and front shrouds of the impellers which 

rotate in the fluid; 

• Similar friction losses created by the components of axial thrust balance devices; 

• Leakage through the interstage seals in multistage pumps. These leakages do not 

flow through the impeller. Consequently, they do not influence the power 

transferred from the impeller vanes to the fluid; 

• Hydraulic losses due to friction and vortex dissipation in all components between 

suction and discharge nozzle; 

• Fluid recirculation at partload creates high losses due to an exchange of momentum 

between stalled and non-separated fluid zones. 

 

The real head curve can be obtained by subtracting the hydraulic losses caused by friction 

and vortex dissipation from the theoretical head. 

 

2.3.1 Friction losses 

The shear stresses created by the velocity gradient in the non-separated boundary layers are 

responsible for the friction losses. According to Gülich (2007), experience shows that roughness 

increases the flow resistance in turbulent flow. However, this is only the case if the roughness 

elements protrude beyond the laminar sub-layer. In laminar flow the roughness has no influence 

on the resistance since there is no exchange of momentum across the flow. With growing 

Reynolds number, the boundary layer thickness decreases and the permissible roughness drops as 

well. Vortex shedding from the roughness peaks creates energy dissipation due to the exchange 

of momentum with the main flow. In the fully rough domain the losses become independent of 

the Reynolds number and increase with the square of the flow velocity. 

 



13 
 

2.3.2 Vortex dissipation (form drag) 

In this work, all of the following were considered as vortex dissipation losses: localized 

losses, shock losses, losses due to secondary flow and recirculation. Since recirculation causes 

vortex dissipation, the losses due to this effect will be also considered as hydraulic losses. 

While static pressure can be converted into kinetic energy without a major loss (accelerated 

flow), the reverse process of converting kinetic energy into static pressure involves far greater 

losses, because the velocity distributions are actually mostly non-uniform and subject to further 

distortion upon deceleration. Non-uniform flow generates losses caused by turbulent dissipation, 

known as “form” losses, and this is considered to be the main source of energy loss in pumps, 

especially at high specific speeds. Flow separations and secondary flows also increase the non-

uniformity of a velocity distribution and, consequently, the losses. 

 

2.3.2.1 Localized losses 

The localized losses occur at the inlet and outlet of the impeller and casing/diffuser. This is 

due to the sudden change of section area and also because of the shift from a rotating component 

to a stationary one, or vice-versa. Fluid viscosity does not influence these losses, as they are 

purely inertial. 

 

2.3.2.2 Shock losses 

When the flow approaches the impeller or diffuser vanes at an incorrect angle, shock losses 

occur, as shown in Figure 6. These losses, which are also considered as vortex dissipation losses, 

are normally low at the design point and increase at off-design conditions with @A/A]_' ? 1C` , 
where x = 2 is usually assumed.  

 



14 
 

 

Figure 6 - Effect of local flow separation at impeller or diffuser inlet (Gülich, 2007). 

 

Because of the complicated three-dimensional flow patterns, these losses cannot be 

predicted theoretically. Either empirical pressure loss coefficients are used for estimation or 

numerical methods are employed. 

 

2.3.2.3 Losses due to secondary flow - Flow deflection caused by the vanes 

According to Gülich (2007), the moment acting on the vanes can be considered a result of 

the integral of the pressure and shear stress distributions across the vane surface (vane forces). It 

can be determined that different flow conditions are found between vane pressure and suction 

surfaces, since the pressure distributions result from the velocity distributions around the vanes. 

According to Stepanoff (1957), this pressure distribution profile makes the relative velocity 

at the suction side (SS) of the impeller vane be greater than the one at the pressure side (PS). As a 

result, a smaller real differential pressure is generated at the impeller than if there were a uniform 

velocity profile.   

 



15 
 

 

Figure 7 - Slip phenomenon. a) Flow between the vanes; b) Secondary flow (Gülich, 2007). 

 

Furthermore, the flow is not able to follow the exact contour of the vanes. It is the deviation 

between the vane and flow angles that makes the work transfer possible. The described 

phenomenon is quantified by the “slip factor” or by the “deviation angle” and is shown in Figure 

7. 

Generally, secondary flows are induced when the fluid is subjected to forces acting 

perpendicular to the main flow direction. These forces generate corresponding pressure gradients 

which are determined by the resultant of the centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations. Consequently, 

the ratio of these accelerations, known as “Rossby number” ab , determines the direction into 
which the flow will be deflected (Gülich, 2007). 

In theory, if ab  is near 1, no relevant secondary flow would be expected. If ab&amp;lt;1, the 
Coriolis forces are dominant and the flow direction is towards the pressure side of the vane. On 

the other hand, if ab&gt;1, the flow direction is towards the suction side of the vane. 
 

2.3.2.4 Recirculation 

When a pump works significantly below the best efficiency point, it is said to be operating 

at partload. Since vane inlet angles and channel cross sections are too large for the reduced flow 

rate, flow patterns during partload are significantly different from those at the design point. The 

flow becomes highly tridimensional since it separates in the impeller and the collector. At 

sufficiently lower flow, recirculation is observed at impeller inlet and outlet. 



16 
 

According to Fraser (1981), the total head produced is the sum of the centrifugal head and 

the dynamic head. The centrifugal head is independent of the flow rate, but the dynamic head is a 

function of the absolute velocity and therefore is a function of the flow rate. At some capacity, 

the dynamic head might exceed the centrifugal head, causing the pressure gradient to revert. The 

direction of the flow reverses, which causes flow recirculation. 

Recirculation is a reversal of the flow at the inlet or at the discharge tips of the impeller 

vanes. All impellers display a start point of suction recirculation and a start point of discharge 

recirculation at some specific capacity, and the effects of recirculation can be very damaging 

depending on the size and speed of the pump. Therefore, the starting point of suction 

recirculation has to be considered when defining the pump’s minimum flow. Furthermore, the 

starting point of discharge recirculation has to be analyzed due to its influence on the pump 

efficiency, especially in large specific speed pumps. 

 

2.3.3 Secondary losses 

Secondary losses also cause fluid heat and they have to be taken into account as power 

losses. However they are not considered as pressure (head) losses. 

 

2.3.3.1 Disk friction losses 

When a circular disk or a cylinder rotates in a fluid, shear stresses corresponding to the 

local friction coefficient occur on its surface. The friction coefficient depends on the Reynolds 

number and the surface roughness. 

If the body rotates in a casing (as is the case in a pump) the velocity distribution between 

casing and rotating body depends on the distance between the impeller shroud and the casing wall 

as well as on the boundary layers which form on the stationary and rotating surfaces. In other 

words, ? = -Q can no longer be assumed.  
The disk friction losses in a pump depend on the following parameters: Reynolds number, 

roughness of the rotating disk and casing wall, axial sidewall gap, shape of the casing and size of 



17 
 

the impeller sidewall gap, influencing the boundary layer and leakage flow through the impeller 

sidewall gap, partload recirculation and exchange of momentum. 

The last three parameters can severely influence the disk friction loss and render its 

calculation quite uncertain, especially with large leakage flows and at partload. Even at the best 

efficiency point, the tolerance of the calculated disk friction loss is estimated to be about 25%.  

The share of disk friction losses in the power consumption of a pump drops exponentially 

with increasing specific speed and increasing head coefficient. With low specific speeds disk 

friction is the main source of loss and can achieve up to 30% of the useful power of the impeller. 

 

2.3.3.2 Leakage losses 

Close running clearances between impeller and casing/diffuser or on axial thrust balance 

devices limit the leakage from the impeller outlet to the inlet. Any leakage reduces the pump 

efficiency. Since the entire mechanical energy transferred by the impeller to the leakage flow (i.e. 

the increase of the static head and the kinetic energy) is throttled in the seal and converted into 

heat, one percent of leakage flow also means an efficiency loss of one percent (Gülich, 2007). 

 

2.3.3.3 Mechanical losses 

The mechanical losses are generated by the radial and axial bearings and by the shaft seals. 

Occasionally these losses include auxiliary equipment driven by the pump shaft. 

The mechanical efficiency of large pumps is around 99.5% or even above. In contrast, the 

mechanical losses of small pumps (say below 5 kW) can use up a considerable portion of the 

coupling power. Examples are process pumps which are often equipped with dual mechanical 

seals.

2.4 Head curve prediction methods 

As already mentioned, in literature, there are several proposed models based on fluid 

dynamic principles and experimental data that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of 

centrifugal pumps. There are also various methods to calculate a pump’s performance with 

numerical simulation. Some of these methods are presented below. 

Patel et al. (1981) presents a theoretical model to predict the whole head curve of 

centrifugal pumps based on fluid dynamic principles, over a wide range of specific speeds, 

considering various sizes and types of pumps. The head curve is presented as being the Euler 

head minus friction and shock losses. The results are found to be in good agreement with the 

experimental data of more than 50 pumps, with an error of ± 3%. 

Sun &amp;amp; Tsukamoto (2001) presents a CFD model to predict off-design performance of 

diffuser pumps, a condition in which the effects of rotor/stator interaction and the pump system 

characteristics become significant. The predicted head curve is validated by experimental data. 

The model produces a good prediction of pump off-design performance. 

Li et al. (2002) affirms that most published guidelines for the selection and design of 

centrifugal pumps are based on performance data collected before 1960, on pump designs of the 

1920’s and 1950’s. It analyzes the performance of a modern pump in an attempt to update the 

information. According to this work, calculating the performance of a modern pump from the 

available published guidelines may lead to discrepancies of up to 10% from the real performance. 

Sun &amp;amp; Prado (2003) presents a single-phase model based on fluid dynamic principles, for 

different ESP pump types, liquid properties and motor speeds. Friction and shock losses are taken 

into account. A comparison between the predicted performance and the pump performances 

based on the Affinity Law is presented. 

Asuaje et al. (2005) presents a 3D-CFD simulation of the impeller and volute of a 

centrifugal pump. This flow simulation is carried out for several impeller vane numbers and the 

relate volute tongue positions. According to this work, the volute tongue causes an 

unsymmetrical flow distribution in the impeller, which is confirmed by experimental data. 

Finally, velocity and pressure fields are calculated for different flow rates. 

Cheah et al. (2007) presents a numerical simulation of the internal flow in a centrifugal 

pump impeller by using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code. Both design and off-design 



19 
 

conditions are analyzed. The results show that the impeller passage flow at the design point is 

smooth and follows the curvature of the vane. However, flow separation is observed at the 

leading edge due to non-tangential inflow conditions. When the centrifugal pump is operating 

under off-design conditions, unsteady flow develops in the impeller passage. The results are 

compared to experimental data over a wide range of flow and show good agreement. 

Thin et al (2008) presents a method to predict the performance curves of a centrifugal 

pumps based on fluid dynamic principles. The theoretical head, slip factor, shock losses, 

recirculation and friction losses are taken into account. The pump considered in this work is a 

single-stage end suction centrifugal pump, with low specific speed. 

Das et al. (2010) presents a performance prediction method for centrifugal submersible 

slurry pumps, based on fluid dynamic principles. Initially, the head curve for clean water is 

considered as the theoretical head deducted by the head losses. Then, the effects of solid particle 

size, specific gravity and concentration on pump slurry flow are shown. Finally, additional head 

losses due to solid particles in the slurry are predicted and deducted from the clean water head to 

establish the performance of centrifugal slurry pump. The performance prediction using this 

method is more accurate around the design flow rate and gives a more accurate prediction of 

centrifugal slurry pump performance for mostly homogenous slurry than it does for 

heterogeneous slurry. 

Jafarzadeh et al. (2011) presents a general three-dimensional numerical simulation of 

turbulent fluid flow in order to predict the velocity and pressure fields of a centrifugal pump. A 

low specific speed, high speed pump is considered. A commercial CFD code is used. The 

comparison between the resultant performance curves and experimental data shows acceptable 

agreement. Furthermore, the effect of the number of impeller vanes on the hydraulic efficiency 

and the effect of the position of the vanes with respect to the tongue of the volute on the start of 

the separation are analyzed. 

El-Naggar (2013) presents a one-dimensional flow procedure for the prediction of 

centrifugal pump performance, based on principle theories of turbomachines, such as the Euler 

equation and the energy equation. The loss at the impeller exit associated to the slip factor and 

the volute loss are estimated. The predicted curves are consistent with experimental 

characteristics of centrifugal pumps. 



20 
 

Shah et al. (2013) presents a critical review of the CFD analysis of centrifugal pumps along 

with the future scopes for further improvements, since in recent years it has been observed a 

growing availability of computational resources and progress in the accuracy of numerical 

methods. According to this work, the most active areas of research and development are the 

analysis of two-phase flow, pumps handling non-Newtonian fluids and fluid-structure interaction. 

The CFD approach provides many advantages compared to other approaches, but due to its 

theoretical nature, validation with experimental results is highly recommended. 

Biazussi (2014) presents a simple single-phase approach, based on fluid dynamic 

principles, that defines the head versus flow rate curve. According to this approach, for fluids 

with low viscosity, the head curve is a quadratic function of the flow rate, as expected. Some 

assumptions and simplifications were considered, so that the model would only depend on a few 

accessible hydraulic dimensions and the performance would be predicted with reasonable error. 

 

Considering the aim of this work, the model presented by Biazussi (2014) is chosen as the 

starting point, due to its simplicity and dependency on few and accessible data of the pumps. 

 

2.5 Shut-off head prediction 

According to Dyson (2002), for many years, much of the pump community's focus has 

concentrated on improving prediction methods for best efficiency point conditions. But this is not 

true for the prediction methods available to estimate off-design performance. Investigations at 

partload operation are difficult. The area of off-design behavior that has received least attention is 

the prediction of the level of head a pump produces when its discharge valve is closed and the 

flow through the pump approaches zero, the shut-off condition. 

Dyson (2002) and Newton (1998) compared some shut-off head prediction methods 

available in literature. These methods are either based on empirical data or developed from an 

analytical approach, they are presented below. 

 



21 
 

2.5.1 Stepanoff’s method 

The Euler equation simplified for the shut-off condition is presented as: 

$8 = Z??
?

? ^                    (16) 
On this basis, many statistical investigations have attempted to modify this theoretical 

maximum head by the application of a universal correction factor. 

Stepanoff (1957) proposes the use of the factor cd, a constant, independent of the pump 
geometry and equal to 0.585.  

$8.d = cd Z??
?

? ^                    (17) 
This factor was derived from a review of a number of centrifugal pumps. The spread of 

error is over 20 per cent. 

 

2.5.2 Peck’s method 

A similar correction factor for the Euler equation is proposed by Peck (1968), who also 

based his work on statistical analysis of pump geometry. 

$8.'f = c'f Z??
?

? ^                   (18) 
He suggested that the pump configuration affected this constant. In this way: 

• For single suction volute pumps, c'f  = 0.575; 
• For double suction volute pumps, c'f  = 0.625; 
• For multistage volute pumps, c'f  = 0.6. 

The available data has shown that the spread of the results is still wide. 

 

2.5.3 Patel’s method 

According to Patel (1981), the specific speed of the pump has an influence on the shut-off 

head. Typically, a low specific speed pump may have a flat performance curve, while a high 



22 
 

specific speed one may have a higher head rise to shut-off. Patel (1981) proposes the following 

correction factor to the Euler equation: 

$8.'? = c'? Z??
?

? ^                   (19) 
c'? = 0.65 ? 0.00344./                  (20) 
The specific speed ni is calculated with metric units. The range of specific speed of the 

pumps analyzed by Patel is from 12 to 50. 

Using the database to separate out pump configuration, the difference between each pump 

type becomes apparent. The data suggests that this method can be further modified to also take 

into account the pump configuration. The Patel’s modified correction factor would then be: 

• For single suction pumps:  

$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.m7nOo8.8887?p                  (21) 
• For double suction pumps:  

$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.mm5:o8.8887?p                  (22) 
• For multistage pumps:  

$8.'?.j?? = +k.Nl8.;OOmo8.8885?p                   (23) 
According to Dyson (2002), this method presents an increased accuracy compared to the 

previous ones. 

 

2.5.4 Thorne’s method 

Thorne (1988) proposes a correction factor for the Euler equation based on empirical 

constants for the impeller and casing: 

$8.q = Z??
?

? ^ rZ
7

?s
t^ ? Z
?uv
5?u ^ Z9

5 + ]??s
t?^w                (24) 
xyz{ = 1 + Z?|^ Z

7o[?
n8 ^ Z

5
7}@?u/??C?^                 (25) 

The casing factor in the slip equation ~ = 0.77, z is the number of impeller vanes, D7j is the 
inlet meridional velocity. A is the ratio of the impeller inlet and outlet radius and B is the ratio of 

the inlet radius and the cutwater radius. 



23 
 

This method attempts to consider the impeller inlet and outlet diameters, which have 

influence on recirculation, causing negative effects on the shut-off head. The slip represents the 

effect of the impeller vane geometry. The casing is taken into account by the use of an 

empirically derived coefficient. The pump configuration is not taken into account. 

According to Dyson (2002), this method consistently overpredicts the value of the shut-off 

head, with errors of over 20 per cent. 

As proposed by Dyson (2002), the accuracy of Thorne’s method could be increased by the 

use of the following correction factors, according to the pump configuration: 

• For single suction pumps 1/1.31; 

• For double suction pumps 1/1.1; 

• For multistage pumps 1/1.36. 

 

2.5.5 Stirling’s method 

Stirling (1982) proposes that the shut-off head be composed of three components: impeller 

contribution (as if the impeller were a solid body), volute contribution and inlet backflow (when 

liquid exits from the impeller eye and flows into the inlet channel). 

$8.d?.
jt = 75? Z?55 ?
?u?
5 ^                  (26) 

$8.d?.??s = ??

?9 = 1.17? ? 3 Z'?[??? ^                  (28) 
?K = ?0.2331 Z?u??^ + 0.1952                  (29) 
where AR is the ratio of rotor outlet area to the volute throat area, ?8 is the slip factor, ?5 is 

the impeller vane pitch at Q5 and D? is a coefficient which takes into account the thickness of a 
rotating disk when calculating its disk friction. 

This prediction method attempts to consider the contribution of important geometric 

features such as suction diameter, impeller diameter and volute. However it still relies on 

empirically derived constants. The pump configuration does not have a marked statistical effect 

on the predicted head, but the method consistently underpredicts the shut-off head. 



24 
 

Therefore, a modifying factor can be applied to the Stirling equation. 

$8.d?.j?? = +k.?l8.m::m}8.8888n?p                  (30) 
 

2.5.6 Frost and Nilsen’s method 

Frost and Nilsen (1991) also proposes a method based on the contribution of the impeller 

and volute. However, while Stirling’s method uses empirical coefficients, Frost and Nilsen’s is 

purely analytical. The flow in the impeller is assumed to exhibit solid body rotation. 

$8.??.
jt = ??
?

5? ?1 ? Z
?u

5?                  (31) 
According to Newton, (1998), they were uncertain of the value of Q7 and identified three 

possibilities: the impeller vane inlet radius, the radius of the suction pipe or zero, due to the fact 

that forced vortex rotation will spread to the centerline. 

The volute contribution was obtained by assuming that the velocity distribution within the 

diffuser satisfied the following three flow conditions: the velocity at the exit of the impeller is 

equal to the vane velocity, there is no net flow in the discharge duct, and there is continuity of the 

recirculating flow in the volute. 

$8.??.??s = Z ???@?v}??C?^ rQj y. Z

where ? is the angular velocity of the impeller, QJ is the height from the impeller centerline 
to the throat, Qj  is (radius at tongue - QJ )/2 and Q5  is the radius at the middle of the throat. 
According to Dyson (2002), although this method doesn’t consider the negative contribution 

from the backflow, it is more accurate than the previous methods. 

Dyson (2002) also presents a modifying factor for the Frost and Nilsen’s equation: 

$8.??.j?? = +k.??8.m5;5}8.8888O?p                  (33) 
 

2.5.7 Gülich’s method 

Based on numerous measurements in all types of centrifugal pumps, Gülich (2007) presents 

a graph of the pressure coefficient as a function of the specific speed. He also presents an 



25 
 

estimate of the shut-off head. As with all statistics, the figures show mean values and mean errors 

but do not permit any statement on possible deviation of the individual measurement which, in 

principle, can be of any magnitude (Gülich, 2007). 

c = 5?+???                      (34) 
 

 

Figure 8 – Pressure coefficients (Gülich, 2007). 

 

Analytical functions for the shut-off pressure coefficients are provided by Equations (35) 

and (36): 

For diffuser pumps: c8 = 1.31?}8.:?p ?p.????                  (35) 
For volute pumps: c8 = 1.25?}8.:?p ?p.????                        (36) 
where ./.K?? = 100. 
 

The previous section clearly demonstrates that the shut-off head takes into account 

numerous phenomena and its prediction is very complex.

3 THEORETICAL MODEL  

The theoretical model used in this work is the one developed by Biazussi (2014) and it is 

presented below. This model establishes a method for the interpretation of the head versus flow 

rate of a centrifugal pump. The following premises are considered: 

• Homogeneous and single-phase flow; 

• One-dimensional and permanent flow; 

• Uniform flow through the impeller; 

• Constant speed; 

• Negligible torque due to superficial and field forces. 

Dimensional analysis provides a better understanding of the flow and the physical effects 

involved before starting a theoretical and experimental analysis, allowing for the extraction of 

data trends that would otherwise remain disorganized and incoherent.  

The differential pressure is a function of the head provided by the pump, while the head 

depends on the volumetric flow rate (A), speed (-), density ("), viscosity (&gt;), impeller diameter 
(	5) and other hydraulic dimensions (?
 ). 

!? = ?7@A, -, ", &gt;, 	5, ?

As previously shown in Chapter 2, through dimensional analysis, we can derive the 

following equations:  

Capacity coefficient: D* = *0??2                 
Head coefficient: D+ = &amp;amp;'(0????

Geometric coefficients:

A generic expression for $7  has to be defined based on physical phenomena. The 
correlations have to be adjusted to the experimental data. The pump geometry is taken into 

account by the model adjustment coefficients. 

The differential pressure provided by the pump can be calculated by subtracting the 

hydraulic pressure losses from the Euler differential pressure: 

!? = !?_?s?? ? !?s?????                   (40) 
where: 

!?_?s?? = "-5Q55 Z1 ? * ????[?5\]?0???^                 (41) 
And Q5 = 	5 2?  .                     (42) 
The Euler differential pressure can also be written as: 

!?_?s?? = 7J "-5	55 ? ?7
(0*

??                   (43) 
where ?7 = ??  ??? [?5\]?                   (44) 
And according to the dimensional analysis, the Euler head curve is written as: 

D+ _?s?? = 7J ? ?7D*                   (45) 
The hydraulic pressure losses are composed of the friction, localized and distortion losses: 

!?s????? = !???
??
?? + !?s?? + !??
?????
??                (46) 
The friction losses are expressed by an equivalent friction factor, which is composed of a 

turbulent term and a viscous term: 

!???

?? = ? ????

                  (48) 

where 9? = 2 Q?6¢ ,  ?5 = ?? ?5 ?  and  ?: = ?? ?:?. Therefore, it follows that:

?? = r?5 ZM??(* ^ + ?: Z

where . expresses the viscous effect in high flow rate and is always smaller than 1. 
According to the dimensional analysis, the friction head losses are written as: 

D+ ??
??
?? = r?5 ZM??(* ^ + ?: Z
M??
(* ^

?w D* 5                (50) 



29 
 

The localized losses are considered purely inertial and independent of the viscosity. They 

are represented by the sum of the dissipative losses that occur in the inlet and outlet of the 

impeller and casing/diffuser. 

!?s?? = ?n"-5	55 Z *0??2^
5
                  (51) 

The localized head losses are written according to the dimensional analysis as follows: 

D+ s?? = ?nD* 5                    (52) 
The distortion losses represent the sum of the shock losses, losses due to secondary flow 

and recirculation losses.  

For a one-dimensional simple model, the effects of the recirculation losses, losses due to 

secondary flow and shock losses overlap themselves, which makes it difficult to separate them. In 

this model they are represented as just one type of loss, called distortion loss. 

!??
?????
?? = !?????f + !????.?s?£ + !????
???s??
??              (53) 
The shock losses are inertial losses, caused by the misalignment of the fluid velocity with 

the vane surface, when the pump operates out of BEP of the maximum diameter. 

!?????f = "-5	55?J r1 ? ?O? *0??2w
5                 (54) 

where kO?  is based on pump geometry and is defined as: 
?O? = ??

2 ??? [u
5\]u?u?                     (55) 

The losses due to secondary flow also depend on the flow rate and are relevant at partload. 

Secondary flow can be caused by the difference between the pressure at the suction side and the 

pressure at the pressure side of the impeller vanes, especially in the region closer to the vane 

outlet. 

The recirculation losses occur inside the impellers and depend on the flow rate. These 

losses are maximized at zero flow (Gülich, 2007) and are expected to be zero at the best 

efficiency point. 

The distortion losses are represented similarly to the shock losses, with similar equation, 

but without an explicit definition for ?O?. Therefore, the distortion losses are defined as follows: 
!??
?????
?? = "-5	55?J r1 ? ?O *0??2w

5
                (56) 

And the distortion head losses are written as follows:

The interpretation of the head versus flow rate curve of a centrifugal pump requires the 

explicit definition of the coefficient ?7 from the pump geometry and the simultaneous adjustment 
of the other six dimensionless parameters (?5,  ?:,  ?J,  ?O,  ?n, .). 

When the fluid viscosity is low, the parameter F is very small (less than 10}; ) and its 
influence on the head curve can be neglected. In this case, the pump performance depends only 

on the flow rate and pump geometry. 

D+ = ? ZD* , ????^                   (60) 
Therefore, the head curve is represented by the following equation: 

D+ = 7J ? ?J + @??7 + 2?J?OCD* + ¯??J?O5 ? ?n°D*5              (61)

4 TEST PROCEDURE AND PUMP TYPES  

Since the tests used in the current work were not part of its scope, the test procedure is 

presented without many details. In Section 4.1 to 4.3, the test procedure with main followed 

recommendations and main instruments is presented. They are in accordance with the Standard 

ANSI/HI 14.6. In section 4.4, the different tested pump types are presented. 

All the tests were performed according to the test procedure and test recommendations 

presented below.  

 

4.1 Test procedure 

The preferable layout for pump tests is a loop with the following characteristics: 

• Closed loop as applicable; 

• Pipe losses including valves shall allow for the full flow range to be measured; 

• Cooling and heat exchanger as necessary; 

• Possibility for degassing; 

• Measuring device for dissolved oxygen concentration. 

For performance tests a closed test loop with a separate connected tank according to Figure 

9 is recommended. This layout ensures that no air gets into the loop after degassing. However, 

Figure 10 shows a simplified test loop with the main pipe going through the tank. This approach 

allows for a reduced cost piping layout with fewer valves and a simpler heat exchanger. The main 

disadvantage of this set-up is that it is possible for air from the tank to re-saturate and/or reenter 

the main pumping flow. Additionally the tank water level shall provide adequate submergence 

over the suction (tank outlet) pipe.

4.2 Recommendations for the tests 

Inlet flow disturbances, such as swirl, unbalance in the distribution of velocities and 

pressures, and sudden variations in velocity can be disruptive to the hydraulic performance of a 



33 
 

pump, its mechanical behavior, and its reliability. The most disturbing flow patterns to a pump 

are those that result from swirling liquid that has traversed several changes of direction in various 

planes.   

When fittings, such as tees and elbows (especially two elbows at right angles) are located 

too close to the pump inlet (suction), a spinning action, or swirl, is induced. Higher energy and 

higher specific speed pumps with lower NPSH margins are more sensitive to suction conditions. 

Additionally double suction pumps are sensitive to uneven flow caused by an elbow in the plane 

of the shaft mounted on the suction flange which will direct more flow to one side of the impeller 

than the other. 

For the best performance test results, the fluid flow into the pump should be as smooth and 

uniform as possible. Therefore a straight section of pipe should be used at the pump inlet. 

Generally 5 pipe diameters of straight pipe are required to ensure uniform flow. If the minimum 

recommended pipe lengths cannot be provided, flow-straightening devices should be considered. 

Bends, valves, etc. should be limited in the suction line, especially directly upstream of the 

pump. The last elbow before the suction pipe shall be a long radius elbow. 

The suction pipe shall be the same size as the pump suction nozzle. Piping leading to the 

suction pipe shall be the same size or larger. If a smaller pipe is unavoidable, it shall be at least 

10 suction pipe diameters away from the pump suction. Also the fluid velocity and pressures 

should be checked to ensure that there is a margin over vapor pressure. 

Velocities may be increased at the pump suction flange by the use of a gradual reducer (no 

more than one pipe diameter reduction in a single reducer should be used). A concentric reducer 

is recommended for vertical inlet (suction) pipes, reducing the possibility of air or vapor 

accumulation. When piping reducers are required in horizontal suction pipe runs, they shall be of 

the eccentric design oriented so as to not trap vapor (flat side up). 

All inlet (suction) fitting joints shall be tight, especially when the pressure in the piping is 

below atmospheric, to prevent air leaking into the fluid. Care shall be taken to eliminate high 

points in the suction piping which may collect vapor. Vents shall be located at all high points of 

the suction piping. 

Long horizontal runs of pipe should be sloped slightly upwards in the direction of flow to 

allow the fluid flow to sweep air bubbles to a high point which is vented. 

The main components used on the performance tests are the following: 



34 
 

• Suction piping: pressured directly from the tank or by means of a booster pump; 

• Suction valve: necessary for the NPSH tests; 

• Suction pressure gauge; 

• Tested pump; 

• Driver (electric motor, turbine or diesel engine); 

• Discharge pressure gauge: placed after a reasonable straight pipe length in order to 

provide a constant flow distribution; 

• Discharge valve; 

• Discharge piping; 

• Flowmeter; 

• Counter pressure valve. 

Before the test, the following items are checked: pump and driver alignments, speed 

direction, electric parts, suction and discharge pipes, and instrument position and calibration. 

During the test, the flow rate is controlled by the discharge valve. For each flow rate, the 

suction and discharge pressure, the speed and power at shaft end are measured. During the test, 

the bearings temperature and mechanical seal leakage are monitored. 

At least five sets of readings are taken from the zero flow to 120% of the best efficiency 

flow (BEP). Points are chosen to include the shut off (if allowed), minimum flow, midway 

between minimum and rated flow, rated flow, BEP (if BEP is not within 5% of rated flow) and 

120% of rated flow. 

All testing is conducted with water, which is free of contaminants, at temperatures less than 

55°C (130°F), or as otherwise specified. 

Adequate suction pressure is maintained for safe and smooth operation of the pump during 

performance testing. Testing shall be performed within 50% to 120% of specified speed.  

The instruments used for the test must be able to accurately measure the performance at the 

rated flow point and ensure that each instrument reading is within 1/3 - 2/3 of the meter range 

under rated working condition. 

• Capacity: flow is measured with either a calibrated venturi meter, dall tube or 

orifice plate and a differential pressure gauge, transducer, or mercury manometer, or 

a magnetic, ultrasonic or mass flow meter, with an electronic output; 



35 
 

• Head: discharge pressure, and suction pressure when appropriate, is measured with 

a transducer, pressure gauge, positive displacement type deadweight tester, or 

manometer, with a correction added for the water surface or reference plane to 

gauge measurement. The differential head is calculated, including velocity heads, 

per the appropriate standard (ISO, HIS, or ASME); 

• Power: a digital power meter or a poly-phase wattmeter, in conjunction with current 

and potential transformers as necessary, is used to measure the input power to the 

motor. The pump shaft power is computed using the calibration data of the motor 

(and gear as applicable). Alternatively a torque meter may be used; 

• Speed: a photo tachometer, electronic counter and a magnetic pick-up or a hand 

held photo cell type digital counter is used to measure the pump shaft speed; 

• Elevation: gauge elevations are be measured with a measuring stick or tape 

measure. 

Table 1 presents the list of instruments used on the tests considered in this work. The 

instruments accuracy is such that the accuracy at the measured points is the one presented in this 

table. The tests were performed with the use of a data acquisition system and other computerized 

data recording systems that are responsible for the calculation, performance curves plotting and 

test report generation.

4.3 Vertical pumps 

The test procedure and recommendations for vertical pumps are similar to the ones for 

horizontal pumps. Vertical pumps can be tested in a closed test loop with a suppression tank, 

according to Figure 11. This layout ensures that no air gets into the loop after degassing. 

However Figure 12 shows the typical vertical pump testing arrangements in open wet pits. These 

approaches allow for reduced cost piping layout and testing. The main disadvantage of this set-up 

is it is impossible to de-aerate the system, therefore fully saturated water must be considered. 



37 
 

 

Figure 11 - Closed test loop through a suppression tank – Vertical pump. 

 

 

Figure 12 - Open test loop from wet pit – Vertical pump. 

 

When tested in an open loop (wet pit) the pumps suction shall have sufficient submergence 

to prevent air borne vortexes. For pumps with suction cans or containers the inlet suction pipe 

shall have a straight section of pipe. Generally 5 pipe diameters of straight pipe are required to 



38 
 

ensure uniform flow at the pressure measurement section. If the minimum recommended pipe 

lengths cannot be provided, flow-straightening devices should be considered.  

The main components used on the performance tests of vertical pumps are the following 

ones: 

• Tested pump; 

• Driver (electric motor, turbine or diesel engine); 

• Discharge pressure gauge: placed after a reasonable straight pipe length in order to 

provide a constant flow distribution; 

• Discharge valve; 

• Discharge piping; 

• Flowmeter; 

• Counter pressure valve. 

 

4.4 The tested pumps 

The tests used in the current work were provided by a global pump manufacturer. Therefore 

it was possible to collect a big quantity of tests. The test data is shown in APPENDIX B. 

In order to ensure the correspondence among the hydraulic dimensions of the pump, only 

performance tests at the impeller maximum diameter have been considered, so that the impeller 

outlet angle ?5 and the impeller outlet width 65, for instance, would in fact correspond to the 
impeller outlet diameter, 	5. 

Furthermore, it was possible to select tests of several types of pumps. These pump types are 

described here according to the classification presented by the international standard API 610 

11th edition, “Centrifugal Pumps for Petroleum, Petrochemical and Natural Gas Industries”. The 

pump types used in this work are the following ones: OH2, BB1, BB2, BB3, BB4-BB5 and VS2. 

 



39 
 

4.4.1 Pump type OH2 

The OH2 pumps are horizontal, centerline-mounted, single-stage overhung pumps, with 

single suction. They have a single bearing housing to absorb all forces imposed upon the pump 

shaft and maintain rotor position during operation. The pumps are mounted on a baseplate and 

are flexibly coupled to their drivers. 

This pump type is widely used in off-shore and on-shore applications and also in the 

general industry. 

Twenty-one tests of OH2 pumps were analyzed in this work, with a range of dimensionless 

specific speeds from 0.11 to 0.83. 

Figure 13 represents a typical OH2 pump. 

 

 

Figure 13 - OH2 pump type. 



40 
 

4.4.2 Pump type BB1 

The BB1 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, axial split, volute pumps, with double 

suction impeller. According to the API 610 11th edition, this type of pump has one or two stages, 

but in this work just the pumps with one stage are considered in the category. 

These pumps are used especially in pipeline applications, refineries and in the water and 

wastewater markets. 

Seventeen tests of BB1 pumps were considered in this work, with a range of dimensionless 

specific speeds from 0.31 to 1.35. These pumps have a larger impeller outlet width 65 , that 
corresponds to the two sides of the impeller, which were used in the calculations. 

Figure 14 represents a typical BB1 pump. 

 

 

Figure 14 - BB1 pump type. 

 



41 
 

4.4.3 Pump type BB2 

The BB2 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, radial split volute pumps with a double 

suction impeller. According to the API 610 11th edition, this type of pump has one or two stages, 

but in this work just the pumps with one stage are considered in the category. 

This pump type is used in off-shore applications, such as SRU pumps, and in applications 

with high temperature. 

In this work, two tests of BB2 pumps were considered, with dimensionless specific speeds 

of 0.32 and 0.47. Like the BB1 pumps, the 65 used in the calculations corresponds to both sides 
of the impeller. 

Figure 15 represents a typical BB2 pump. 

 

 

Figure 15 - BB2 pump type. 

 



42 
 

4.4.4 Pump type BB3 

Similar to the BB1 pumps, the BB3 are horizontal, between bearings, axial split volute 

pumps, but with multiple stages. In this work the pumps with two stages or more are considered 

in this category.  

These pumps are also used in pipeline applications and in the water and wastewater 

markets, but in applications with more flow rate and pressure than the ones in which the BB1 

pumps are used. 

In this work, nine tests of BB3 pumps were analyzed, with a range of dimensionless 

specific speeds from 0.49 to 0.92. Like the BB1 and BB2 pumps, the 65 used in the calculations 
corresponds to both sides of the impeller. Furthermore, the hydraulics were analyzed considering 

just one impeller. The pressure provided by the pump was divided by the number of stages of the 

pump. 

Figure 16 and Figure 17 represent typical BB3 pumps. 

 

 

Figure 16 - BB3 pump type. 

 



43 
 

 

Figure 17 - BB3 pump type. 

4.4.5 Pump types BB4 and BB5 

The BB4 and BB5 pumps are horizontal, between bearings, radial split pumps, with 

diffuser and multiple stages. BB4 pumps have a single-casing, while the BB5 ones have a double 

casing (barrel). 

BB4 pumps are mainly used as boiler feed water pumps in the power market. BB5 pumps 

support the highest pressures and therefore are used in high reliability applications, such as 

injection pumps on platforms. 

Since the hydraulics of BB4 and BB5 pumps are usually the same, they were considered as 

a single group in this work. Twenty four tests were considered in this category. Like the BB3 

pumps, the hydraulics were analyzed considering just one impeller. The pressure provided by the 

pump was divided by the number of stages of the pump. 

In this work, twenty four tests of BB4-BB5 pumps were analyzed, with a range of 

dimensionless specific speeds from 0.24 to 0.50. 

Figure 18 and Figure 19 represent typical BB4 and BB5 pumps. 

 



44 
 

 

Figure 18 - BB4 pump type. 

 

 

Figure 19 - BB5 pump type. 

 



45 
 

4.4.6 Pump type VS2 

Wet pit, vertically suspended, single-casing volute pumps with discharge through the 

column are designated as VS2 pumps. 

These pumps are widely used in off-shore application, such as fire-fighting system and as 

seawater lift pumps. They are also used in the water and wastewater market. 

Seven tests of VS2 pumps were analyzed in this work, with a range of dimensionless 

specific speeds from 0.89 to 1.49. It is important to note that, for vertical pumps, at the 

differential pressure calculation, the level difference between the bowl and the discharge nozzle 

has to be taken into account, as well as the pressure losses at the column pipe.  

Figure 20 represents a typical VS2 pump. 

 

 

Figure 20 - VS2 pump type. 

 



46 
 

In total, eighty tests were analyzed in the current work, with a range of dimensionless 

specific speeds from 0.11 to 1.49. Six different types of pump were considered, including volute 

and diffuser pumps, single and double suction, horizontal and vertical, single or multistage. This 

diversity on the tests is essential for the validation of the proposed model.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Initially, the tests used in this work are presented. They are compared to the reference 

curves provided by the pump manufacturer, which are henceforth referred to as theoretical 

curves. This comparison is not shown for all the eighty tests considered in the current work, just 

for two tests of each pump type. 

Then, the tested curves are compared to the ones adjusted by the model presented by 

Biazussi (2014). Again, this result is shown just for some tests. 

After that, the model equation coefficients are plotted against the pump specific speed in 

order to analyze the correlation among them. From the analysis of these correlations, equations 

are proposed, so that the coefficients can be defined from basic characteristics of the pumps, such 

as specific speed and main dimensions. As a result, the head curve against flow can be defined, 

only based on these characteristics.  

Then, the correlation based curves are compared to the tested curves and the difference 

between them is discussed. 

Afterwards, several shut-off head prediction methods are analyzed, so that the correlations 

proposed to predict the whole head curve can be improved. Then, the improved head curves are 

plotted against the correlation based and the tested ones and the difference among them is 

discussed. 

Finally the effectiveness of the proposed method to predict the head curve of centrifugal 

pumps is evaluated.

Figure 22 - Tested curve with flow and head coefficient errors. 

 

Besides the experimental data error, the most relevant factors that could result in the 

differences observed among the curves are variations both in the casting process and during the 

test procedure. The test standards already allow for certain tolerances in the test results. So there 

is a margin to accommodate these variations. 

The curves considered as reference for the model adjustment and the analysis of the results 

are the tested ones, since they represent the real performance of the pumps considered in this 

work.  

 

5.2 Model adjustment for the head curve 

The model adjustment proposed in Equation (61) was done by the software Wolfram 

Mathematica ™ version 9.0.1. The “FindFit” function was used to find the numerical values of 

the equation coefficients that best fit the input data. The adjustment is based on the minimization 

of the norm, calculated as follows: 

P±Q² = 19³x@´C5 + 9³x@µC5 + 9³x@¶C5 + ? + 9³x@.C5              (62) 
where . is the quantity of input data and the variables x, y and z are the deviation between 

the tested and the calculated values.

5.2.1 The influence of ¸¹ on the head curve prediction 
In some situations, the outlet angle of the impeller vanes ?5 might be difficult to measure. 

In these cases, since this hydraulic parameter is essential for the determination of ?7 , this 
coefficient has to be adjusted based on the tested data, as do the other equation coefficients. 

In order to evaluate the influence of ?5, several values of ?5 were considered on the head 
curve prediction by the model. The data of test 40 (BB2 pump) was used on this analysis. The 

range of ?5 considered was from 15° up to 37.5°. Figure 24 shows the head curve predicted by 
the model considering all the values of ?5. 

 

 

Figure 24 - Influence of ¸¹ on the calculated curve. 
 

The bigger ?5 the lower the predicted head losses and, consequently, the flatter the head 
curve. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that ?5 in fact influences the shape of the 
head curve. This conclusion was already expected, since ?5 is one of the hydraulic parameters 
that define ?7, which multiplies D* in the model equation.

The real value of ?5 is 20.8°, but according to Figure 24, the curve that best predicted the 
shape of the head curve was the one with ?5 = 32.5°, but presenting an off-set that might be 
related to an error on the shut-off head prediction. 

Additionally, in order to evaluate the effect of a missing ?5, the model was also run without 
?5 and adjusting ?7 based on the tested data. Figure 25 presents a comparison among the tested 
curve and the head curves predicted with and without ?5. 

 

 

Figure 25 - Effect of a missing ¸¹ on the calculated curve. 
 

The head curve predicted without ?5  was not able to reproduce the shape of the tested 
curve. It over predicted the head losses. However, the curve predicted with the real value of ?5 
has also presented a deviation in the shape of the curve. Therefore it is possible to conclude that 

the absence of a ?5 value in fact influences the head curve prediction, but there are also other 
influencing factors in play.

5.2.2 The contribution of each head loss on the head curve 

As already shown in Chapter 3, the differential pressure provided by the pump can be 

calculated by subtracting the hydraulic pressure losses (friction, localized and distortion) from the 

Euler differential pressure.  

According to the Equations (45), (50), (52) and (57), and using the data of test 17 (OH2 

pump), the Euler head curve, the contribution of each head loss and the head curve with losses 

are visualized in Figure 26. 

 

 

Figure 26 - Contribution of each loss on the head curve. 

 

The friction losses are negligible, since the test was conducted with water, which presents 

low viscosity. 

Figure 27 shows the total head losses curve and the flow at the best efficiency point (BEP). 

It is clear that the BEP flow does not correspond to the flow in which the losses are minimized.

5.2.3 The influence of the surface finish on the pump performance 

According to the theory, the surface finish (roughness) influences the friction factor f and, 

consequently, the friction losses. However, in practice, this affects the pump efficiency more than 

the head curve. Figure 28 compares the head and efficiency test curves of a certain pump, with 

and without polishing. The pump material in both cases was chrome steel, A487 CA6NM, and 

the casting process was done with sand mold. 

The tested pump is a BB1 type, with dimensionless specific speed of 0.905 and impeller 

diameter of 918 mm.

Around the BEP, the head curve almost didn’t change, but the polishing from Ra50 to

axis range in Figure 29.

These results are in line with the ones shown in Figure 26, in which the friction losses were

5.3 Model equation coefficients versus pump geometry 

The coefficients ?J , ?O  and ?n  are also dependent on the pump geometry and can be 
represented as a function of the dimensionless specific speed. This analysis was done by Biazussi 

(2014), but only with a few test results, and the correlations found among the coefficients and the 

specific speed were linear, as shown in Figure 30. 

 

      

 

Figure 30 - Equation coefficients vs. specific speed for the tests analyzed by Biazussi (2014). 

 

Biazussi (2014) has even suggested that more tested data should be used in order to better 

understand these correlations. And this is the biggest contribution of the current work. With the 

data from eighty tests, it was possible to evaluate these correlations and, in fact, they proved not 

to follow straight lines. 

In Figure 31 to 34, the equation coefficients k7, kJ, kO and kn adjusted by the model for all 
the tests are plotted as functions of the dimensionless specific speed. The points are grouped 

according to the pump type, but it is possible to notice tendencies when analyzing the results of 

all the pump types together.

The coefficients ?7 , ?O  and ?n  could be represented as functions of the dimensionless 
specific speed directly. The value of the coefficient ?J is around 0.1 for most tests. However, in 
order to define a refined correlation for this coefficient, the ratio between the impeller inlet and 

outlet diameters, 	7 and 	5, has to be also taken into account. A reasonable correlation has been 
found between ?J ?u?? and the specific speed. Figure 35 shows this correlation.

Figure 35 - Equation coefficient º¼ ¿»¿¹  vs. specific speed. 
 

The ratio  
?u
?? is purely geometric and represents the effect of the impeller vane length on the 

differential pressure. If the impeller inlet and outlet diameter were the same, no differential 

pressure would be observed. 

The correlations between the coefficients and the dimensionless specific speed can also be 

represented as equations that are the best fit for each group of points. They are shown as the 

tendency lines in Figure 31, 33, 34 and 35 above.  

With these correlations and Equations (44) and (61), the head curve against flow can be 

defined only based on basic characteristics of the pump, namely 	5, ?5, 65, 	7 and P?, as shown 
in Table 2:

?O = 7.3282P? }7,O85 (64)   
?n = 10.97P?}J,5J5 (65) 

 

It is recommended that the value of the coefficient ?7  is calculated based on the pump 
geometry, according to Equation (44). The correlation presented in Figure 31 should be used only 

in case one of the hydraulic parameters that define ?7  is not available, for instance ?5 , as 
discussed in section 5.2.1. 

With regard to the coefficient ?J, it is also recommended that its value be obtained based 
on the correlations presented in Table 2. However, if the hydraulic parameter 	7 is not available, 
it is possible to approximate ?J to 0.1, according to Figure 32. 

This simplification is in line with Stepanoff’s method for the shut-off head prediction, as 

shown below: 

According to the Euler head equation, Equation (45), the head at shut-off is: 

D+ 8._?s?? = 0.25                   (66) 
As shown in Chapter 2, Stepanoff (1957) proposes the use of the correction factor cd for 

the Euler head, having a constant value of 0.585. Therefore:  

D+ 8.d??t????? = 0.25 ? 0.585 = 0.14625                            (67) 
According to Equation (61), the head at shut-off is: 

D+ 8 = 7J ? ?J                     (68) 
Therefore, considering the Equations (67) and (68), the coefficient ?J would be: 
?J = 7J ? 0.14625 = 0.10375                            (69)

In most cases (64 tests), the correlations (Table 2) were able to predict the tested curve with 

good accuracy. The standard deviation limit set to define good accuracy is 0.02. This behavior 

was observed in all the pump types. 

In some cases (10 tests), the correlations (Table 2) were able to predict the shape of the 

tested curve, but an offset was observed due an error on the shut-off head prediction. This 

behavior was observed in few cases of all pump types. 

In few cases (6 tests), the shape of the curve was not well predicted. This behavior was 

observed in 2 tests of BB1 pumps and 4 tests of BB3 pumps. It happened more critically with the 

tests of BB3 pumps, but it is important to note that the pump hydraulics was the same in these 4 

tests.  

As already mentioned, there are several proposed models to predict the hydraulic 

performance of centrifugal pumps in literature. However, even the best CFD simulations can’t 

predict the pump performance accurately.  

The correlations proposed between the equation coefficients and the basic information of 

the pumps represent the mean tendency among a huge amount of experimental data from several 

types of pumps. Therefore the provided values of the coefficients may not be so accurate in some 

cases. 

Given all the assumptions and simplifications, the objective of this work is to present 

correlations applicable to several pump types that easily provide a prediction of the head curve 

with reasonable error. This error is natural and expected. Since pumps have numerous 

configurations and their hydraulics are very complex, it is not expected that their performance be 

accurately predicted with only a handful of parameters. 

Therefore, considering the goal of this work and all the tested data used to validate it, it is 

possible to affirm that the proposed correlations (Table 2) are able to easily predict the head 

curve of pumps in several different configurations with reasonable error. 

 

5.4.1 Previous work curves predicted based on the correlations 

The three pumps tested by Biazussi (2014) are multistage pumps, with 3 stages and 

diffusers. Therefore they are considered BB4 pumps. They are called P23, P47 and P100, with 



66 
 

specific speeds of 28, 46 and 68, in SI units, respectively. Each one of these pumps was tested in 

three speeds. Therefore 9 tests are available. 

For all the tests, the coefficients ?7, ?J, ?O and ?n were adjusted by the model presented by 
Biazussi (2014) and their values were plotted over the curve with the coefficients calculated for 

all the 80 tests presented in this work. This is shown in Figure 37. 

 

      

      

Figure 37 - Equation coefficients vs. specific speed for the 80 tests presented in this work and 
also the tests analyzed by Biazussi (2014). 

 

For Biazussi (2014)’s tests, the values adjusted by the model for the coefficients ?7, ?J and 
?O  fit the correlations previously established between the coefficients of the 80 tests and the 
related specific speed. However the values adjusted for ?n don’t fit the tendency curves. Since ?n 
multiplies D*5 on the model curve, this deviation reflects on the head curve prediction based on 
the correlations (Table 2), as shown in Figure 38.

Figure 38 - Correlation based and tested curves analyzed by Biazussi (2014) (continued). 

 

For the pumps P23 and P47, the pressure losses were underestimated and, as a 

consequence, the correlation based head curves are flatter than the tested ones. It is important to 

mention that, even with specific speeds in the same range of the ones of the 80 tests, these pumps 

are very small. Therefore, the pressure losses tend to be more relevant than the ones in big 

pumps. 

Among these three pumps, it is possible to notice that the bigger the pump, the closer its 

predicted curve to the tested one. P100 is bigger than P23 and P47, which could explain why the 

losses were not underestimated. The deviation on the curve could be associated to the deviation 

observed on ?n.

5.5 Improvement on the shut-off head prediction 

As mentioned previously, for many years, much of the pump community's focus has been 

on improving prediction methods for best efficiency point conditions. The design of machines 

has evolved to such an extent that their efficiencies now approach the theoretical values and their 

design points can be estimated to within a few percentage points. This cannot be said of the 

prediction methods available to estimate off-design performance. Investigations at partload 

operation are difficult. The flow is impulsive, unsteady and strongly influenced by the time 

dependent nature of the rotor/stator interactions. The area of off-design behavior that has received 

least attention is the prediction of the level of head a pump produces when its discharge valve is 

closed and the flow through the pump approaches zero, the shut-off condition. 

Not surprisingly, the main source of error on the correlation based curves was the shut-off 

head prediction. The offset observed between the correlation based and the tested curves in some 

cases is related to the error on the shut-off head prediction.  

For this reason, some of the shut-off prediction methods presented in Chapter 2 were 

analyzed and used to optimize the correlations proposed to predict the head curve (Table 2) by 

changing the equation coefficient ?J. 
According to the Equation (61), at shut-off (D* = 0), the head coefficient D+ = 1 4? ? ?J. 

Therefore, from the shut-off head estimated by the several shut-off prediction methods, it is 

possible to calculate the related ?J  to be used on the whole head curve prediction. The 
coefficients ?7, ?O and ?n remain the same ones based on the correlations (Table 2). 

It is important to notice that the improved prediction of ?J has also an influence on the 
shape of the curve, since this coefficient also multiplies D* and D*5 . 

For each test and each one of these methods, the shut-off head was calculated and used to 

estimate the value of ?J and then the whole head curve was raised. 
In this work, improved curves are the head versus flow curves predicted based on the 

correlations presented in Table 2 and improved by a shut-off head prediction method presented in 

Chapter 2.  

The standard deviation of the improved curves was used to compare them to the tested 

curve and also among themselves. As a consequence, it was possible to identify the best 

prediction method for the whole head curve for each pump type. 



70 
 

Since the goal of this work is to predict the pump hydraulic performance only with few and 

accessible hydraulic dimensions, some methods were discarded because they considered several 

hydraulic dimensions that are not easily obtained. This was the case of the Thorne’s, Stirling’s 

and Frost and Nilsen’s methods. 

The methods analyzed are the ones proposed by Stepanoff (1957), Peck (1968), Patel 

(1981) and Gülich (2007). The first three methods present correction factors to the Euler’s 

equation, based on the statistical analysis of several test results. The fourth method is also based 

on statistical data, but it presents a graph for the shut-off head prediction based on the specific 

speed of the pump. These methods are presented in detail in Chapter 2. 

Table 3 presents the sum of the standard deviation (total standard deviation) of the 

improved curves, grouped by pump type, for each method. 

 

Table 3 - Total standard deviation of the improved curves.

Patel 0.17 0.33 0.04 0.29 0.39 0.14 
Gülich 0.15 0.24 0.04 0.24 0.28 0.08 

 

For the OH2 pumps, by using Stepanoff’s method of shut-off head prediction to improve 

the head curve predicted based on the correlations (Table 2), the total standard deviation drops in 

36%, from 0.22 to 0.14. 

With regard to the BB1 pumps, besides Patel’s, all the methods presented similar values of 

total standard deviation. The use of Stepanoff’s or Gülich’s method presents total standard 

deviation of 0.24, which is 4% smaller than the one calculated for the predicted curve based on 

the correlations.  

Since there are just two tests of BB2 pumps available, the total standard deviation is smaller 

than the ones calculated for the other pump types. Even though, it is possible to evaluate the best 

method to predict the head curve. In this case, Peck’s method presents the smallest total standard 



71 
 

deviation, 0.027, which is 13% smaller than the one calculated for the predicted curve based on 

the correlations. 

Considering all the tests of BB3 pumps, Stepanoff’s and Peck’s methods present the 

smallest total standard deviation, 0.21. However, as mentioned previously, among the 9 tests of 

BB3 pumps, 4 of them had the same hydraulics and presented serious deviation on the prediction 

of the shape of the curve. This hydraulics is very peculiar and could not represent well the 

behavior of this type of pump. If these tests are ignored, the smallest total standard deviation is 

0.013 with Stepanoff’s method, against 0.017 based on the correlations and 0.022 with Peck’s 

method. 

The correlations (Table 2) predict the head curve of BB4-BB5 pumps better than all the 

other methods. In fact, the comparison of the correlation based curves with the tested ones shows 

the smallest total standard deviation, 0.24. 

For VS2 pumps, Gülich’s method presents the best head curve prediction, with total 

standard deviation of 0.08. Even being vertical and with high specific speed (semi axial pumps), 

it was possible to find a good method to predict the head curve of VS2 pumps. 

Comparisons among tested, correlation based and improved curves are presented in Figure 

39. The standard deviation among these correlation based, improved and tested curves are 

presented in Table 4. In all cases, besides test 75, the standard deviation of the improved curve is 

smaller than the one of the correlation based curve. Test 75 represents the exceptions, which 

means that the method chosen as the best one to predict the head curves of a certain pump type 

doesn’t correspond to the best method to predict the head curve in this particular case.

6 CONCLUSIONS 

In literature, there are several models that attempt to predict the hydraulic performance of 

centrifugal pumps. Some of them are based on fluid dynamic principles, but others are based on 

empirical data and there are also the modern ones based on numerical simulation. In order to 

decide the best one to be used, the available information about the pump has to be taken into 

account.  

The current work proposes correlations for the head curve prediction based on few and 

accessible pump characteristics. The data of eighty tests of different pump types are used, 

covering a wide range of specific speeds. Even with simple input data, results with reasonable 

accuracy are obtained. 

In addition, the use of simple shut-off head prediction methods increases the accuracy of the 

whole pump head curve predicted by the correlations (Table 2). This combination does predict 

the pump hydraulic performance with acceptable accuracy only with few and accessible 

hydraulic dimensions. 

To summarize, the recommended methods to predict whole head curve for each pump type 

are the following ones: 

• Correlations (Table 2) + Stepanoff’s method for OH2, BB1 and BB3 pumps; 

• Correlations (Table 2) + Peck’s method for BB2 pumps; 

• Correlations (Table 2) for BB4-BB5 pumps; 

• Correlations (Table 2) + Gülich’s method for VS2 pumps.

7 RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE PROJECTS 

One of the assumptions considered on the theoretical model was that the effects of the 

recirculation losses, losses due to secondary flow and shock losses overlap themselves, which 

makes it difficult to separate them. Therefore, they were represented as just one type of loss, 

called distortion loss. 

In fact, all of them depend on the flow rate, tend to a minimum value at the best efficiency 

point and are more critical at partload. However it would be important to know the contribution 

of each component. 

The correlation found between the equation coefficient ?J and the specific speed depends 
on 	7 	5? . It would be valuable if this ratio could be considered since the theoretical model 
definition. 

Since the energy consumption has always been an issue, for sure the best complement for 

this work would be the analysis of the available data also with regard to the pump power, so that 

it would be possible to predict the power consumption of a centrifugal pump only with few and 

accessible hydraulic dimensions.

APPENDIX A – Experimental data error analysis 

 

The experimental data error represents the maximum deviation around the best estimated 

value of a parameter. This uncertainty is the result of a lack of information regarding the 

parameter being measured. In other words, infinite information would be necessary to define its 

exact value. Therefore, when experimental data is presented, its error needs to be informed. 

The error is calculated according to normalized procedures. INMETRO presents general 

rules for the experimental error evaluation. Two types of errors are considered: 

• Error type A: based on the statistical analysis of a series of measured data; 

• Error type B: based on other examinations not based on statistical analysis. 

Since the data acquisition was not part of the scope of this work, only one measure of each 

parameter was available. Therefore, the errors considered in this work are of type B, with the 

exception of the density error. 

 

A.1 – Combined error 

 

Combined error can be understood as the standard deviation of a variable ¶ based on the 
standard deviation of its dependent variables, ´ and µ, according to the equation below: 

?|5 = ZÃ|Ã` ?` ^
5 + ZÃ|ÃÄ ?Ä ^

5
                 (A.1) 

where ?`  and ?Ä  are the errors associated to the variables ´  and µ , and ?|  is the error 
associated to variable ¶. 

 

A.2 – Combined error of the differential pressure provided by the pump 

 

The differential pressure provided by the pump is obtained based on the pressure measured 

at the suction and discharge of the pump, according to the equation below: 

?? = ??
??????? ? ?????
??               (A.2) 
where ??
???????  is the pressure measured at the discharge of the pump and ?????
?? is the 

pressure measured at the suction of the pump. 



82 
 

The error associated with the differential pressure provided by the pump is calculated 

according to the following equation: 

??'5 = ¬ Ã?'Ã'??ÅÆÇÈÉÊ? ?'??ÅÆÇÈÉÊ? ®
5

+ Z Ã?'Ã'ÅËÆl?Ì? ?'ÅËÆl?Ì? ^
5
           (A.3) 

where ??'  is the error of the differential pressure, ?'??ÅÆÇÈÉÊ?  is the error of the discharge 
pressure and ?'ÅËÆl?Ì?  is the error of the suction pressure. Therefore,  

??' = Í?'??ÅÆÇÈÉÊ?5 + ?'ÅËÆl?Ì?5                     (A.4) 
 

A.3 – Combined error of the head coefficient 

 

According to Equation (6), the head coefficient is defined as: 

D+ = &amp;amp;'(0????                  
The error associated with the head coefficient is calculated according to the following 

equation: 

???5 = ZÃ??Ã?' ??' ^
5 + ZÃ??Ã( ?(^

5 + ZÃ??Ã0 ?0 ^
5 + ZÃ??Ã?? ??? ^

5
               (A.5) 

where ???  is the error of the head coefficient, ?( is the error of the density, ?0  is the error 
of the speed and ???  is the error of 	5. Therefore: 

??? = Í
JÎ'??§??
??«(?03 +

Î'??ª?
??3(303 +

JÎ'??L?
??3(?0« +

?ÏN?
??3(?03            (A.6) 

 

A.4 – Combined error of the flow coefficient 

 

According to the Equation (5), the flow coefficient is defined as: 

D* = A-	5: 
The error associated with the flow coefficient is calculated according to the following 

equation: 

???5 = ZÃ??Ã* ?* ^
5 + ZÃ??Ã0 ?0 ^

5 + ZÃ??Ã?? ??? ^
5
             (A.7) 

where ???  is the error of the flow coefficient, ?*  is the error of the flow. Therefore: 



83 
 

??? = Í
m*??§??

??Ð0? +
???

??«0? +
*??L?
??«03               (A.8) 

 

A.5 – Calculation of the combined errors 

 

According to the combined error definition, the errors associated with the flow and head 

coefficients, D* and D+, calculated for test 17 and presented in Figure 22, are the following: 
 

Table A.1 – Variables and errors
