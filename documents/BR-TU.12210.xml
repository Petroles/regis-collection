1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The discovery of Pego in 2003 lead to 

archaeological excavations resulting from 

different contexts. After a first evaluation 

carried out by archaeological surveys, assigned 

by Acheo’Estudos. Investigação Arqueológica, 

Lda., the archaeological works proceeded under 

the project The Entre-o-Douro landscape 

between the III and the I millenniums BC
1
. 

These works were coordinated by one of the 

authors (A.M.S.B.) until 2007.

Abstract : This work reports the data which has been recovered from the excavation of Sector II of Pego. Among other kinds of 
evidence, that area encompasses traces of funerary practices dating back to the Bronze Age. 

Based upon the local’s choice, the structures’ architectonic features, their interrelations, materials associated and strati-

graphy and in the carbon dating results available we have proposed different uses and occupation phases. 

Although certain materials reflect human presence during later periods, the frequency of that area denounce three occu-

pation moments datable from between the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. These moments are consistent 

with the construction of a plain grave’s necropolis, probably forming familiar clusters, a hypothetic pits’ necropolis and, 

prior to the abandonment of the area, an “enclosure”. 

Given the interpretations presented we have discussed the possible relation between the local, certain physical charac-

teristics and the presence of funerary practices. As a work hypothesis we consider those relations as fundamental for the 

places’ choice. Alongside with other evidence of difficult interpretation and, perhaps, in the context of new senses 

meanwhile acquired by this place, these data form part of this place’s biography. 

Keywords: Portuguese Northwest, Bronze Age, necropolis, flat graves, pits, ceramic depositions, deathscape. 

Resumo: Entre o vale e o monte. Refletindo sobre a importância espacial da necrópole da Idade do Bronze do 
Pego, Braga (Noroeste de Portugal) 

O presente trabalho apresenta os dados de escavação relativos ao Sector II do Pego, área onde foram identificadas, entre 

outras, evidências de práticas funerárias da Idade do Bronze. 

Com base na escolha do local, nas caraterísticas arquitetónicas das estruturas, nas suas inter-relações, nos materiais a 

elas associados, na sua estratigrafia e nas datas de radiocarbono disponíveis são propostos diferentes usos e fases de 

ocupação. 

Embora certas materialidades denunciem presença humana posterior, a frequência da área denuncia quatro momentos 

de ocupação datáveis entre o Bronze Médio e o Bronze Final. Esses momentos são compatíveis com a construção de 

uma necrópole de sepulturas planas, quiçá formando núcleos familiares, com uma hipotética necrópole de fossas e, 

antes do abandono do local, com um “recinto”. 

Atendendo ao quadro interpretativo apresentado, discute-se a possível relação entre o local, certas caraterísticas do meio 

e os vestígios das ações funerárias. Como hipótese de trabalho consideram-se tais relações como fundamentais para a 

escolha deste lugar. A par de outros vestígios de interpretação mais difícil e, talvez, no quadro de novos sentidos entre-

“How things are materialized depends upon the language, the concepts, the experiences, and the power relations which converge 

on a particular experience. So just as we cannot look back at the ancient past and imagine that those people understood their own 

bodies in the same way as we do in the present, we equally cannot imagine that the significance of material culture is fixed and 

changeless”.

The subsequent works continued under the 

doctoral thesis project submitted by one of the 

signers
2 

(H.A.S.), entitled Bronze Age places in 

the river Ave’s basin. More recently, this work  

integrated the interdisciplinary project named 

Natural Spaces, Architectures, Rock Carvings 

and Depositions of the Western Façade of the 

Central-Northern Portugal Late Prehistory: 

from Agencies to Meanings
3
, equally lead by 

one of the authors (A.M.S.B.). 

From these  different  works  resulted two 

publications (SAMPAIO et al. 2008; SAMPAIO &amp;amp; 

BETTENCOURT 2011) and the preparation of a 

monograph  chapter  is  to  be  included  in  the 

aforementioned doctoral thesis. 

The  campaigns  developed  between  2003 

and 2010 enabled the recovery of an important 

set of information significantly relevant for the 

Bronze  Age  understanding.  Although  some 

evidence  identified  in  other  areas  of  the  site 

denounce  different  activities,  some  of  which 

datable  from  historic  phases,  this  work  will 

only  focus in the so-called Sector  II.  In that 

area,  corresponding  to  the  South  slope  of  a 

knoll and alongside with Bronze Age mortuary 

practices, other activities have occurred, which 

its  interpretation  is  complex.  Altogether  its 

analysis may contribute to a better knowledge 

of  the  Northwestern  Iberian  Bronze  Age 

funerary contexts and practices. 

 
2. LOCATION AND PHYSICAL CONTEXT 

 

The site of Pego is located in Souto, 

parish of Cunha, county and district of Braga, 

in the North of Portugal. According to the 

World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) is 

positioned at the geographic coordinates of 

41, 4939 N and -8, 5206 W (Fig. 1).

It occupies a little knoll with 150 meters of 

maximum altitude that corresponds to a flattened 

spur. This knoll integrates a wider mount that from 

Sequeira grows in that direction, reaching the 

220/240 meters of altitude. 

The knoll is flanked from East by the 

Levegada’s stream. Its valley is mainly developed 

from Northeast to Southwest, coursing between 

moderate granitic reliefs lower than 270 meters of 

altitude, and joining the river Este at about 1 km to 

South. As so, Pego integrates the river Ave’s basin 

(Fig. 2).  Not far to the Southwest it was possible to 

identify a paleochannel, cut in the edge of a nearby 

pathway owned by a local home-keeper. It is likely 

that this paleochannel might have been active during 

the Bronze Age. Within 50 meters to the North there 

is known to be a potable water source. 

This positioning allows for excellent 

visibility conditions, in particular between the 

Northeast and the South. Concretely, to the wider 

alluvial valley of Levegada’s stream, with 

sprawled banks on which proliferate suitable 

agricultural soils. 

The local rock substratum is mainly 

constituted by biotitic monzogranites, with rare 

muscovite, porphyroids, of coarse grains, often 

outcropping (TEIXEIRA &amp;amp; MEDEIROS 1969). The 

regional climatic conditions impel the bedrock 

meteorization, in many cases promoting its 

arenization (GONÇALVES 2013).

Analysing the Portuguese Geological Charts, 

sheets 5-C from Barcelos (TEIXEIRA &amp;amp; MEDEIROS 

1969), 5-D from Braga (FERREIRA et al. 2000), 9-

A from Póvoa de Varzim (TEIXEIRA &amp;amp; MEDEIROS 

1965) and 9-B from Guimarães (ANDRADE &amp;amp; 

NORONHA 1986), at the scale of 1/50.000, it is 

possible to identify several ore resources in a 

radius inferior to 25 km: at a maximum of 13 km to 

the Northeast – the tin-mining complex of 

Negreiros (Barcelos) / Lousado (Vila Nova de 

Famalicão); at about 8 km to the Southwest – the 

tin-mining resources spread between Cabreiros and 

Padim da Graça (Braga); at about 19 km to the 

South – the tin mines of Parada de Gatim / 

Cabanelas (Vila Verde); and at about 25 km to the 

South – the gold minerals of Portela das Cabras 

(Vila Verde) (Fig. 2). The proximity of the rivers 

Cávado, Ave and Este, waterways of considerable 

dynamic available at about 10 km, also facilitated 

the gathering of alluvial native minerals like gold, 

silver and tin (Fig. 2). 

Although tendentiously sparse, the current

methods in order to minimize the lack of 

information. The excavation in plan (and not 

sectioned) of the structures’ stratigraphy allowed, 

in some cases, the identification of organic 

matter’s concentration distributed in the central 

area of some structures. This concentration of 

organic matter was linked to the corpses’ decay 

inside the grave. 

We also focused on the materials deposited 

inside those structures, whose origin we related 

directly to the funerary practices which occurred in 

this space. In this sense, the analytical observation 

of the ceramic vessels recovered inside each grave 

took into account some technical, morphological 

and stylistic aspects, so as their positioning inside 

all structures. 

Seeking to clarify the internal organization of 

that area and to assess the necropolis’ spatial and 

social organization, we have considered the 

interrelations between structures, between groups 

of structures and between ceramic depositions. 

Simultaneously, we prioritize the necropolis’ 

chronological dating and the identification of 

different occupation moments. These moments, 

datable back to the Bronze Age, were also object 

of scrutiny, in order to identify any traces of 

continuity or disruption amidst them. This was 

supported by radiometric dating that ground the 

proposed chronology. 

We also took into account the necropolis’ 

positioning in relation to the knoll and to some 

natural elements, such as watercourses and solar 

cycles.  

Finally, and based on the Peninsular 

Northwestern Bronze Age occupation, we 

attempted some parallels with other known 

coetaneous places. 
 

 
4. DATA 
 

The earliest occupation of Sector II is 

related with the construction of 13 plain graves. 

The layouts of those structures reveal a common 

orientation, aligning their longer axis from the 

Northeast towards the Southwest. 

Their shapes are predominantly 

subrectangular, only oval in graves 4 and 10. All 

the sections are in “U” and their bases are 

flattened, except in graves 8, 9, 10 and 11, which 

are rounded. 

They exhibit variable measures of length, 

height and depth, ranging between 130-245 cm, 

40-90 cm and 12-40 cm, respectively (Tab. 1). 

The absence of osteological remains 

disabled the identification of their heads. 

However, we identified inside the fillings of 

graves 9 and 11, during the excavation in plan 

and in central positioning, different layers that 

suggest them. This may be inferred by a dark 

coloration, which we relate with the presence of 

land cover is formed by arboreal, shrubby and 

herbaceous species, and the nearest terrains 

located on lower altitudes, close to the river 

Este’s valley, as already said, are suitable for 

agriculture. 

A dozen meters to the Southwest are 

known the archaeological sites of Frijão I and 

Frijão II, dating back to Bronze and Iron Age, 

respectively (BARBOSA &amp;amp; AZEVEDO 2004-

2005).  

 
3. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH 

 

Theoretically the dynamic concept of 

landscape is assumed according to Ingold (2000), 

perceived as the dialectic result between the human 

agency and the physical scenario where man lives. 

The landscape is also the perception and the 

experience that communities obtain and create 

from the surrounding world. As so, it is a complex 

and a permanently (re)constructed element which 

actuates many times as an agent. 

Inherent to its existence in the world, man 

embodies and recreates different places. These 

known, experienced and practiced places promote 

the sense of belonging and social integration, 

culminating in the attainment of a sense of place 

(FELD &amp;amp; BASSO 1996; VAN DYKE &amp;amp; ALCOCK 

2003). Their frequency and use is connected with 

actions, histories, memories, feelings and 

meanings, allowing for populations to develop an 

emotional relation to different places. 

The experienced loci become significant, 

incorporating individual and collective memories. 

Sometimes, its uses, frequencies and alterations 

left “readable” archaeological traces. Therefore, 

the recurrent use of particular places enables the 

construction of memoryscapes, where people, 

agencies and memories converge (CLACK 2011). 

The specific case of Pego takes the form of 

deathscape (COOK 2011: 14), a place where the 

performance of “mechanisms in the construction 

and negotiation of identity, heritage and attitudes 

towards death” led to the creation of a place for 

death. Like Thomas (2001: 175) wrote, landscape 

allows for the permanent remembrance of the 

relation between the living and the deceased 

generations and consequently between lines of 

affiliation and succession. 

Based on these assumptions this work 

prioritized both micro and intrasite scales of 

analysis. Firstly, we observed independently the 

structures’ features, focusing their constructive 

elements. Their shape, depth, spatial orientation, 

stratigraphy and covering was carefully analyzed 

and compared. 

The performed rites were another 

contemplated item. The absence of osteological 

remains, due to the Portuguese Northwestern soils’ 

typical acidness, forced us to pursue new work

The top of graves 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11 was 

sealed with a layer of gravel (Fig.5). 

Unfortunately, the level of destruction of the 

remaining graves precluded the observation of the 

same type of cover. At the top of the Southwest 

edge of grave 11 was found an angular granitic 

pebble nailed into the soil, making its 

interpretation difficult.

Observing the spatial distribution of the 

graves one can verify the formation of two 

clusters, which may be compared with the 

segmented model described by M.P. Pearson 

(1999). These were named of nucleus 1 and 

nucleus 2 (Fig. 8). 

Nucleus 1 occupied the upper area of 

the South slope of the knoll and includes 

graves 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 (Fig. 7A). 

The maximum lateral length between graves 

7, 8 and 11 reaches approximately 120 cm. 

Among graves 9, 10 and 12 the length is

about 70 cm. Amidst opposite ends of different 

graves we can only register 40 cm between 

graves 11 and 12. Except for graves 7 and 12
4
, 

all the others included ceramic vessels with flat 

edges (form 13 from BETTENCOURT 1999). 

These vessels were all recovered at the South-

west end of the graves
5
 (Fig. 6). 

The  positioning  of  their  handles  inside 

different  structures  was  variable,  whereby  no 

regularity  was  identified.  Only  the  vessel  of 

grave 9 held external wall burnished and inter-

nal  wall  smoothed,  while  the  others  have 

smoother finishing both on internal and external 

walls. Technical features and decorative com-

positions  analysis  allowed  some  inferences. 

However, for the prior reported reasons, grave 

12 was not contemplated.  All the decorations 

were  distributed  in  metopes  and  demonstrate 

significant complexity. The most frequent deco-

ration techniques conjugate the of use impres-

sion and incision, although in the vessel from 

grave  8 impression  and  plastic  addition tech-

niques  were  simultaneously  used,  the  later  in 

the form of slightly prominent stands transver-

sal to the lip. Likewise, only in the vessel of 

grave 11 the use of impression is present. In-

deed, this was taken as the “simplest” composi-

tion. Graves 7 and 8 also stand out, since their 

fillings included the deposition of a loom weight 

or net weight and a spindle whorl or bead (Fig. 7). 

Nucleus 2 occupied the Southwest area, 

slightly below nucleus 1, and included graves 1, 

2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (Fig. 8). The lateral height be-

tween graves 3 and 6 reached about 140 cm and 

among graves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 about 120 cm. 

Between the opposite ends of graves 2 and 5 the 

maximum height was registered, 70 cm. Except 

for graves 1 and 4 all the others contained a 

ceramic vessel inside their fillings.  In graves 3 

and 6 these were deposited in the Southwest 

quadrant, whilst in graves 2 and 5 in their 

Northeast end (Fig. 6). The position of the han-

dles was variable, and no regularity was ob-

served. The internal and external walls of all 

the vessels denounce a smoothed finishing. 

Like nucleus 1, the decorative compositions 

also denote the use of metopes, in some cases 

evidencing significant complexity, prevailing 

the conjugation of incision and impression tech-

niques. Whereby, only the vessel from grave 5 

denoted simultaneously the application of inci-

sion and plastic addition, the later taking the 

form of slightly prominent protuberances. Like-

wise, only the vase from grave 2 denoted the 

use of impression, exhibiting the “simplest” 

decorative composition. 

Other signs of occupation are materialized 

by the presence of 6 pits dug on the rocky sub-

stratum. These were located very close to plain 

graves, in some cases even overlapping them 

(Fig. 8). The majority held an oval shape, with 

length, widths and depth ranging between 60-78 

cm, 32-52 cm and 30-68 cm, respectively (Tab. 

2). 

4
 Nevertheless, we must underline that the excavation of grave 12 was not completed. From its fillings we recovered three pot sherds apparently belonging to 

another flat edge vessel. Numerous eucalyptus roots are responsible for the disturbance of this structure, especially its Northeast quadrant. This occurrence 

does not invalidate the possibility of another deposition of a vessel inside this structure.  
5
 In grave 8 it was not possible to recover the vessel in its original position, since a massive root disturbed its Southwest quadrant. The vessel was recovered in 

dispersed sherds, which permit to consider its original deposition in that area of the grave.

Pit 4 may correspond to a first pit later 

cut by another similar structure, as appar-

ently prevail its original interface in the 

Southeast quadrant. It held 120 cm in length, 

56 cm in weight and 24 to 48 cm of depth. Pit 

5, substantially different from the others, had 

a circular shape with 124 cm of diameter and 

reached a maximum depth of 32 cm. Its most 

particularity was to overlap grave 11, cutting 

its Southwest end. Beside no evidence of de-

bris in their fillings, the top of pits 1, 2 and 5 

were sealed with a gravel layer (Fig. 9), 

whereas pits 1, 2 and 4 were marked with an 

angular granitic pebble at their top.  

Pit 1 included roughly in its middle a subcir-

cular four stones arrangement, three of which were 

non local granites with high percentage of biotite. 

This feature conferred to those stones a black 

glassed appearance. Hypothetically, this arrange-

ment could have served as base to host something, 

like a body, bones or any other perishable offer-

ings. 

In general the materials recovered inside their 

fillings did not abound: from pit 1 only a pot sherd 

belonging to a belly was recovered; in pit 2 a piece 

of yellow dye was identified; and from pit 3 some 

pot sherds that allowed the partial reconstruction of 

a little pot’s profile were exhumed.

 DATES AND OCCUPATION PHASES 

 

It was an option to date scraped residues of 

soot identified in the internal wall of the vessel de-

posited in grave 9. The carbon dating results situated 

the plain graves of this context between the XVIII 

and XV centuries BC, that is, in the second quarter 

of the I
 
millennium BC and in what is generically 

accepted as regional Middle Bronze Age (Tab. 3). 

Such chronology is compatible with other flat 

edge  vessels  recovered  elsewhere  in  the  river 

Ave’s basin, like Quinta do Amorim 2 (SAMPAIO et 

al.  2014),  for  example.  Therefore,  the previous 

proposed chronology for that area of Pego is re-

ceded, since it was prior ascribed to Late Bronze 

Age (SAMPAIO et al. 2008; BETTENCOURT 2010).

The structures’ spatial distribution and inter-

relation analysis allows for the understanding of its 

chronological sequence. Therefore, the plain grave 

11 was cut by pit 5, corroborating the older con-

struction of the later structure. The cut of the 

Southwest end of grave 1 happened in a later 

phase, during the construction of the perimeter 

ditch. And pit 6 was covered with gravel that also 

resulted from the opening on the rock substratum 

of that perimeter ditch. 

Therefore, based on the stratigraphic record, 

the interrelation between structures, in the recov-

ered materials and in the available carbon dating 

results we have proposed four different occupation 

moments for the South slope of Pego’s site. 

The first moment dates back, at least, to the 

Middle Bronze Age, specifically, to the second 

quarter of the II millennium BC (XVIII-XV centu-

ries BC). This occupation phase corresponds to the 

construction of a plain grave’s necropolis. A latter 

moment is related with a hypothetical pit’s ne-

cropolis that was constructed in the immediate area 

of the plain graves. Although there are no carbon 

dating results available that securely confirm their 

chronology, based on the interrelations between 

structures listed above one can situate them be-

tween the second and the fourth quarter of the II 

millennium BC, that is, between the XVIII-XV 

centuries BC (date from the plain grave’s necropo-

lis) and XII-X centuries BC (date from the perime-

ter ditch’s opening). Subsequent moments date 

back to Late Bronze Age, more precisely, from 

between the XII-X centuries BC and IX-V centu-

ries BC (SAMPAIO et al. 2008). These moments

were matched to the opening and closure of the 

perimeter ditch that surrounded the knoll. 

 
6. FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PLAIN 

GRAVE’S NECROPOLIS TO ITS TRANSFOR-

MATION IN AN ENCLOSURE 

 
The absence of osteological remains requires 

some explanation that support the interpretation of 

certain structures as plain graves and the South 

slope of Pego (Sector II) as a necropolis. These 

assumptions were based upon the shapes, the con-

tours, the dimensions, the stratigraphy and the ma-

terials deposited inside those fillings’ structures. 

It was referred that during the excavation in 

plan of graves 9 and 11 were individualized dark 

layers. Their central distribution was related with 

the decomposition of the deceased. As such, it is 

feasible to hypothesize that each of these graves 

hosted a primary inhumation. 

The compact gravel layer identified on top of 

graves 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11 suggests their sealing with 

this kind of material. 

Other coetaneous contexts like Pego, where 

similar plain graves were identified, are known in 

the Northwestern Iberian Peninsula: Tapado da 

Caldeira, in Baião (JORGE 1980a, 1980b, 1983, 

1985); Cimalha, in Felgueiras (ALMEIDA &amp;amp; FER-

NANDES 2007, 2008; ALMEIDA et al. 2008); Alto 

da Vela/Gulpilhares, in Vila Nova de Gaia 

(FORTES 1909); Quinta do Amorim 2, in Braga 

(SAMPAIO et al. 2013); Coto da Laborada, Calvos 

de Randín (LÓPEZ CUEVILLAS 1930, 1947; LÓPEZ 

CUEVILLAS &amp;amp; LORENZO FERNÁNDEZ 1930); or 

Monte de Mesiego, O Carballiño (LOPEZ CUEVI-

LLAS &amp;amp; LAMAS 1958). 

The presence of flat edged ceramic vessels 

inside the great majority of these graves enhances 

the sepulchral nature of this context. In Northwest-

ern Iberia there other necropolis where these kind 

of ceramic forms were exhumed: Belinho, in 

Esposende (ALMEIDA 1986); Monte da Ola, in 

Viana do Castelo (PAÇO 1933; DINIS &amp;amp; BETTEN-

COURT 2004); Faísca, in Guimarães (CARDOSO 

1936); Cimalha, in Felgueiras (ALMEIDA &amp;amp; FER-

NANDES 2007, 2008; ALMEIDA et al. 2008); Alto 

da Vela/Gulpilhares, in Vila Nova de Gaia 

(FORTES 1909); or Coto da Laborada, in Calvos de 

Randín (LÓPEZ CUEVILLAS 1930). We can also 

highlight the necropolis of Agra de Antas, in 

Esposende, where osteological remains were re-

covered (ATAÍDE &amp;amp; TEIXEIRA 1940; CRUZ &amp;amp; GON-

ÇALVES 1998/1999; BETTENCOURT 1999; CUNHA 

&amp;amp; BETTENCOURT 2013). 

Attending to the general similitude observed 

between graves it is feasible to assert that during 

the Middle Bronze Age a plain grave necropolis at 

Pego’s Southern slope was built. This necropolis 

hosted primary inhumations deposited in lateral 

decubitus – at least in two cases, graves 9 and 11 –, 

sealed with gravel layers and containing, in most 

cases, ceramic offerings and, more rarely, other 

objects. 

The angular pebble identified at the South-

west top of grave 11, interpreted as a marking ele-

ment, lead us to hypothesize that some of these 

structures may have been marked with perishable 

materials and/or additional structures. 

Their organization in clusters enables us to 

question if their disposition can represent familiar 

groups. The answer is not easy but the analysis of 

the decorative techniques and compositions of the 

ceramic vessels appear to show that in each nu-

cleus prevails heterogeneity on the decorative tech-

niques and patterns. This may indicate distinct 

elements of a family, according to a subdivision 

respecting the age, gender or other attributes/

predicates. We also denote that there are recur-

rences in each nucleus, related with vessels’ posi-

tioning and certain decorations. That is, each nu-

cleus includes a vessel decorated with plastic addi-

tion; one vessel decorated only by impression of 

diagonal metopes and graves with absence of ves-

sels occupied identical intra-nucleus positions. It 

seems reasonable to interpret either nucleus as a 

different familiar group, albeit deriving from the 

same community, with specific norms/standards 

towards death. The humble dimensions of this 

place and the lack of superimpositions between 

structures may corroborate the construction and 

frequency of this necropolis by one single commu-

nity. 

The location of this necropolis, between the 

top of the hill and the valley, in the South slope of 

a little knoll, its closeness to a nearby watercourse 

flowing from the North/Northeast to the South/

Southwest, and its viewing of the Levegada’s 

stream were some of the physical features consid-

ered important. According to Tim Ingold’s land-

scape concept (INGOLD 2000) these may not be 

random items. On the contrary, probably these 

were foundational factors taken into account dur-

ing the choice of this locus for its use to perform 

sepulchral practices. As such, these factors were 

agents riddled with cultural and symbolic signifi-

cances. 

The preferential area chosen for the construc-

tion of the necropolis was the sunny quadrant of 

the knoll, facing the South. Can the manorial char-

acteristics of this area, well illuminated from sun 

rise to sunset, reveal any association between the 

solar cycles and death and life cycles? We do not 

know, but this work hypothesis can be raised, al-

beit more data is needed to corroborate its veracity. 

Could the similarity between Levegada’s stream 

and the graves´ orientations (Northeast-Southwest) 

indicate any association between the flow of the 

waters and the journey to death? We also do not 

know. 

Besides, the necropolis occupied the soft

(Northwest of Portugal) 

55 

slope of the knoll, in the area with the best access 

to the nearest fertile valleys. It is located between 

the valley and the hill top, in a liminal position, 

that is, a passage area between low and higher 

lands. Can this physical characteristic be associated 

with death, also seen as a passage between two 

worlds? It seems likely since it is a recurrent location 

observed in other necropolis that we are studying. 

It is curious to register that at the top of the 

knoll no necropolis’ coetaneous occupation was 

identified. This may lead us to consider the South 

slope of Pego as a deathscape in the sense of Clack 

(2011), that is, an area where actions and memories 

towards death took place. Only this way Pego 

could be articulated with other nearest significant 

and experienced places from the Middle Bronze 

Age landscape. Probably recurrently used as a ne-

cropolis, this place subsisted in the everyday life, 

at least, for some time. We do not know if its mem-

ory remained active and if Pego became a memory-

scape, that is, a place of people’s, agencies’ and 

memories’ convergence in its large duration. The 

various occupations identified dating back from 

between the II and the I millenniums BC, as we 

shall see, prove that Pego was occupied several 

times. 

The presence of pits in the plain graves ne-

cropolis’ area is enigmatic. No specific spatial 

disposition stands out, but its proximity to one 

cluster (nucleus 1) is clear. Although the absence 

of osteological remains incites to careful interpre-

tations, funerary pits’ contexts in the Northwestern 

Iberia are known. We may refer, for example, 

Fraga do Zorro, in Verín (FÁBREGAS VALCARCE 

2001; PRIETO MARTÍNEZ et al. 2009), or Medal, in 

Mougadouro, this last site recently discovered and 

presented

. 

The sealing of pits 1, 2 and 5 with gravel and 

the marking of pits 1, 2 and 4 with an angular peb-

ble resemble some plain graves characteristics, and 

may denounce analogous purposes. We also need 

to refer to their non detrital fillings and distinct 

forms, when compared with storage pits defined by 

Buxó (1997), whose sections are funnel-shaped. As 

so, their ceremonial or commemorative role can be 

questionable. Denouncing evident links with funer-

ary practices, by their proximity to some plain 

graves (nucleus 1), it is possible that they served as 

containers to hold depositions or offerings in per-

ishable materials. Such a situation is compatible, 

for example, with the subcircular base formed by 

four rocks which was identified thereabout the 

middle interior of pit 1. This stony arrangement 

may have received a child’s body, an ossuary, a 

reduction, etc. 

Finally, both South slope and the knoll were 

circumscribed by a perimeter ditch. Its stratigraphy 

confirms a simultaneous construction throughout 

the different areas of the knoll, which carbon dat-

ing results situate on the regional Late Bronze Age.  

This circumscription may be interpreted as the 

construction of an “enclosure” that, at a certain 

time, was circled by a palisade (SAMPAIO et al. 

2008).  However, its purposes seem to move away 

from the original funerary features attached to the 

site. This may be explained by the alteration and/or 

renovation of the significances and senses attrib-

uted by the communities to this place, during its 

long diachrony. 

Like other topics, the study of the Bronze 

Age funerary ambiences reflects the complexity of 

the communities that once practiced them. Just as 

today, their dealing towards the inevitability of 

death assumed unique perceptions and understand-

ings about the phenomenon.  As such, each funer-

ary context revealed – more or less singular – may 

open a new window to our interpretation about the 

past and how populations coped and acted with the 

loss of their loved ones. At the same time, it in-

creases our interpretative possibilities on the living 

ones, in other words, on the lifestyles of the popu-

lations that erected those sites for the dead and 

participated in the funerary ceremonies.
