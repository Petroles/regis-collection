SUMMARY

Empirical models are mathematical equations that
can be fitted to experimental results. The use of these models aims
to evaluate or predict observed phenomena or experimental data
with the objective of helping the development of adequate soil
management practices. Based on these considerations, eight
mathematical models described in the literature are compared in
the present work, using as experimental data the mineral N
accumulated during 32 weeks of incubation in Southern Brazilian
soils. To obtain mineralization values experimentally, an
incubation-washing procedure with 0.01mol L-1 CaCl2 was used.
Mineral N was determined at the beginning of the incubation and
in the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th and 32nd weeks. Among the models, the best
fit was obtained with the simple exponential model to describe the
mineralization of organic N in the soils. The double exponential
models showed quite good fit, but may be superparametrized. In
addition, the hypothesis on which these models are based, i.e., the
presence of two forms of organic N susceptible to mineralization,
cannot be sustained in this study.

Key words: potentially mineralizable N, mathematical models,
simple and double exponential, N pools.

RESUMO

Modelos empíricos são equações matemáticas que
podem ser ajustadas a resultados experimentais. Esses modelos
podem ser utilizados para avaliar ou predizer fenômenos
observados ou dados experimentais e auxiliar no
desenvolvimento de práticas adequadas de manejo do solo. Desse
modo, o presente trabalho teve por objetivo comparar oito
modelos matemáticos descritos na literatura, utilizando como
dados experimentais o N mineralizado de dez solos do Rio

Grande do Sul, acumulado  durante 32 semanas de incubação. O
N mineralizado foi obtido experimentalmente em um experimento
de incubação, seguido de lixiviação com CaCl2 0,01mol L

-1. O N
mineral foi determinado no começo do período de incubação e ao
final da 2ª, 4ª, 8ª, 16ª e 32ª semanas. Entre os modelos testados, o
melhor ajuste do N mineralizado foi obtido com os modelos
exponenciais simples, ao passo que a obtenção desses ajustes nos
modelos exponenciais duplos esteve condicionado ao aumento de
parâmetros na equação. Em função dos resultados observados e
das condições experimentais, conclui-se que a  hipótese em que
os modelos  exponenciais duplos estão baseados, isto é, na
presença de dois compartimentos de nitrogênio suscetíveis à
mineralização, foi rejeitada.

INTRODUCTION

Models represent attempts of
mathematical description of a natural event. In the
case of N-mineralization, the main purpose of
modeling is to obtain quantitative data to
recommend nitrogen addition (TANJI, 1982). The
degree of complexity of a model is determined by
the understanding of the system to be modeled, by
the availability of data and by the way the model
will be applied. The main limitation of the models
that include the mineralization of organic N is that

the organic N pool is very large  when compared to
the inorganic N pool (CAMARGO et al., 1997a),
causing large errors when estimating the quantity of
organic N available to plants (TANJI et al., 1979).

Initially, the mathematical fittings
obtained for N-mineralization as a function of time
were described by simple exponential models,
considering the existence of only one form of
potentially mineralizable N (No), decomposing at a
rate proportional to its concentration (STANFORD
&amp;amp; SMITH, 1972). When this concept was
introduced, several mathematical attempts to
estimate No were proposed, using the accumulated
values of mineralized N. The majority of the new
models separate the organic N pool, trying to reduce
the errors in the estimates of No. These models
consider the existence of two or more fractions
occurring in the process, a more stable and a less
stable form, also referred to as readily and less
readily mineralizable N (MOLINA et al., 1980;
INOBUSHI et al., 1985).

Comparative studies of simple and double
exponential models and other functions show that
the best fit to N-mineralization in incubation studies
is obtained with the double exponential function,
especially for short incubation times (MOLINA  et
al., 1980; DEANS et al., 1986; CABRERA &amp;amp;
KISSEL, 1988). However, only a simple fit for
comparison is generally shown, not considering the
biological response of the observed data
(CAMARGO et al., 1997b). The present work aims
to compare mathematical models described in the
literature, using experimental organic-N
mineralization data from soils of the Rio Grande do
Sul State, Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Theoretical background: STANFORD
&amp;amp; SMITH (1972) proposed a biological method to
study N-mineralization from organic matter
incubated at constant temperature and moisture. The
mineralization potential for soil nitrogen (No) was
defined as the fraction of the N pool considered
susceptible to mineralization, as long as the process
follows a first order kinetic. They suggested that the
mineralization potential, No, and the mineralization
constant, k, could be used to predict the soil nitrogen
availability to plants in a time period, considering
that mineralized N is a linear function of the square
root of time. This exponential model is based on the
assumption that there is only one form of potentially
mineralizable nitrogen, decomposed at a rate
proportional to its concentration (Table 1). This
form is assumed to be of a discrete size (No) and its

magnitude approaches asymptotically that of
mineralized N (Nm) accumulated through time.

Ever since STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH
(1972) introduced the concept of potentially
mineralizable N (No), different mathematical
approaches have been used to estimate its value
using mineralized N data. From the simple
exponential model (Table 1) a physical meaning for
k (specific decomposition rate) is obtained, and k is
not linear with time (DEANS et al. , 1986). When it
is difficult to obtain a non-linear regression, No can
be obtained by the hyperbolic equation described by
JUMA et al. (1984). According to MOLINA et al.
(1980), neither the forms obtained by a non-linear
nor those by linear methods give satisfying results
for No or k.

A quite popular model is the double
exponential described by MOLINA et al. (1980) and
INOBUSHI et al. (1985). Both authors consider the
existence of two fractions within the process, one
being a less stable form, and the other one more
resistant. These models are mathematically and
conceptually identical, but with some differences in
interpretation of their parameters. MOLINA et al.
(1980) described this behavior by the equation in
table 1, where S and (1-S) represent, respectively,
the less stable and the resistant fractions of organic-
N, decomposing at specific rates h and k. The model
described by INOBUSHI et al. (1985) was used to
fit N-mineralization data for submerged soils. These
authors proposed a double exponential equation
(Table 1), where Noq and Nos are described by first
order kinetic reactions, with readily and less-readily
mineralizable N, decomposed at specific rates of kq
and ks, respectively. According to DEANS et al.
(1986) the simple exponential equations exhibit a
systematic subestimation of No and a
superestimation of the mineralization rate k. These
authors observed that the double exponential models
gave better estimates of k with lower mean squares,
which supports the hypothesis that at least two
organic N pools contribute to mineralized N.

Notwithstanding the relevance of these
studies, TALPAZ et al. (1981) proposed a non-linear
fitting, considering only one mineralizable N-pool,
whereas SIERRA (1990) considered the simple and
double exponential models only as approaches to the
mineralization that happens within the soil organic
matter. This author showed that the mineralization
rate diminishes continuously, and that it is
impossible to recognize mineralized N pools as
proposed for exponential models, due to the non
significance of the pool size (mineralized N). From a
practical point of view, the number of pools to be
included in the model depends on the fit and the
desired precision.

Experimental data: Eight mathematical
models (Table 1) were compared using experimental
data from the average of ten representative soils
from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, comprising a wide
range of organic matter (17 - 56g kg-1), nitrogen (0.9
- 3.6g kg-1), pH (4.0 - 6.4) and clay content (180 -
550g dm-3), described by CAMARGO et al.
(1997b). Initially, these soils were incubated for four
years in micro-plots (30L) with drainage and
exposed at field conditions. This procedure was used
to minimize sampling and handling effects at the
beginning of incubation. One sample was colleted to
determine soil moisture and another one with natural
moisture to be used, immediately, in the procedures
of incubation described below. This method of
incubation described by STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH
(1972) was used. The method consist of using 25g of
each soil mixed with 25g of washed sand in leaching
tubes of 100mL. These tubes were washed first with
0.01mol L-1 CaCl2, and then a solution without N
(0.002mol L-1 CaSO4.2H2O,  0.002 mol L

-1 MgSO4,
0.005mol L-1 Ca(H2PO4)2. H20 and 0.00025mol "

K2SO4) was added and the water excess removed by
suction at 80 kPa. The tubes were closed to maintain
aerobic conditions and incubated at 35oC. At the
beginning, and after 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks, the
soils were washed using the same procedure,

according to STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972). NH4
+

(distillation with MgO) and NO3
- + NO2

- (distillation
with devarda alloy) were determined in the wash
water.

The fitting of the mathematical models
was done using SAS-ProcNLIN (SAS Institute,
1990), an iterative method using MARQUARDT
(1963) algorithm, obtaining convergence when the
decrease in residual squares in relation to that of the
previous iteration become negligible. The method
depends on initial values for the parameters,
important to reduce the number of iterations and to
avoid non-convergence problems.

The initial estimates were based on the
behavior of the results in relation to those observed
in the literature and afterwards determined by the
least number of iterations for convergence, least
standard error and coefficient of variation, by the
variation inflation factor (VIF) and by the least
dependence between parameters (1/(1-VIF)), given
by the SIGMASTAT (1994) software, using the
MARQUARDT (1963) algorithm for non-linear
models. To identify the most convenient model, the
mathematical properties of the functions were
considered (from a biological point of view) as well
as the determination coefficient (R2), the adjusted
coefficient of determination (adjusted R2), the

residual mean of squares (RMS), the residual
standard deviation (RSD), the distribution of
residues and the asymptotic correlation matrix for
the parameter estimates.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Due to the similarity of the R2 values
(Table 2) calculated from the 8 models, it was not
possible to determine the best model, using this
index. Eliminating the effect of the number of
parameters by the adjusted R2, the fitted models
showed differences, with a slight superiority of the
simple exponential ones. This behavior could be
expected, given the similarity of the R2 and the higher
number of parameters of the double exponential
models. Among the models studied, that of JONES
(1984) is outstanding by its fitting capacity and
description of observed data. With one parameter less
than the models of MOLINA et al. (1980) and
INOBUSHI et al. (1985), this model showed highest
adjusted R2 value, showing that the use of
superparametrized models, like the double exponential,
is not essential for obtaining an adequate fit.

Comparing the models by residual mean
squares and residual standard deviation, the
superiority of JONES' (1984) model is clearly seen
(Table 2). The fit of the double exponential models
(MOLINA et al., 1980; INOBUSHI et al., 1985)
was of lower quality, being superior only to the
model described by BROADBENT (1986), that, in
the context of the present study, was the most
inadequate. As far as the distribution of residues is
concerned, the models were alike; however, JONES
(1984) model showed a distribution of residues that

suggests better fit. Examining the asymptotic
correlation matrix of the parameter estimates, high
positive and negative correlations are observed for
the double exponential models (MOLINA et al.,
1980; INOBUSHI et al., 1985), indicating that they
are superparametrized for the used data set. Models
with less parameters show low correlations,
especially that of JONES (1984).

Considering the mathematical properties
of the functions, based on the graphical
representation of the fitted models, using the simple
exponential as reference (Figure 1), it can be seen
that, as they turn into typical zero order kinetic
reactions, a slight subestimation of mineralized N
occurs for the last point of measurement (32 weeks).
JONES (1984) model fits this point better (Figure 1),
including the concept of initial flux of mineralization
and active nitrogen fraction.

The parameter added to the model of
STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) by MARION et al.
(1981), a time exponent, improved the fitting (Figure
1). STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) observed that the
model, made up of two parameters, does not
describe adequately the initial nitrogen
mineralization rate. These authors corrected their
estimates adding N mineralized during the first two
weeks of incubation to the potentially mineralizable
N, obtained by the simple exponential function
(containing two parameters), on the mineralized N
after 30 weeks of incubation. The parameter (time
exponent) added by MARION et al. (1981) to the
basic mineralization equation described by
STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) has the same
objective and is a simpler way. Recently,
CABRERA (1993) used a simple exponential model,

including the mineralization rate of the most stable
nitrogen pool. Therefore, the application of this
model is based on the existence of two pools of
organic N being mineralized.

STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) verified
for 39 soils that the variation of N-mineralization
rate was very small (k=0.054 ± 0.009. week-1),
suggesting that the main source of mineralized N
was the same for all soils. A reevaluation of the
experimental data of these authors by MOLINA et
al. (1980) revealed that a better fit of the simple
exponential model depends on the presence of
various organic N pools, each one with its own
mineralization rate. Following this principle,
INOBUSHI et al. (1985) assumed the existence of
two nitrogen pools in the mineralization process in

30 flooded soils from Japan. The application of the
double exponential model described by these authors
(MOLINA et al. 1980; INOBUSHI et al. 1985) to
the results of the present paper showed good fit to
the data observed after the second week (Figure 1).

The first data point was not well fitted by
the models, with a deviation of 11.55mg N kg-1 of
soil. The only model that estimated zero time well
was the simple exponential model described by
JONES (1984), representing an important factor for
the mathematical estimation of residual nitrogen
present at the beginning of mineralization. This
result was expected because the other authors did not
generally use time zero in their adjustments because
at this time the mineralization had not begun. The
hyperbolic function (JUMA et al., 1984) did not

describe the data as well as the double exponential
models, mainly for data at week eight (Figure 1).

STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) observed
that most of their results fitted well to the parabolic
equation (Table 1). However, they did not give any
more attention to this model, used only as a mean of
pre-estimating No for the simple exponential model.
It is a fact that the parabolic model fitted the data
better than the simple exponential model for some
soils, not for all of them. BROADBENT (1986),
based on the hypothesis that a better estimate of
mineralized N could be obtained using the parabolic
equation, used values for the time exponent different
from 0.5. A comparison between the parabolic model
and the exponential model described by STANFORD
&amp;amp; SMITH (1972) (Figure 1) showed a better fit with
the late model. In their original paper, STANFORD &amp;amp;
SMITH (1972) estimated k and No by a non-linear
fitting of mineralized N as a function of incubation
time. This fit is worse than the non-linear model when
estimating the mineralization parameters and for the
fitting of exponential data (SMITH et al., 1980). As in
the present paper, the treatment given to the
exponential model is non-linear; hence the greate
difference between the models can be justified.

Some other differences among the
parameters estimated by the eight models can be
observed (Figure 1). As far as the potentially
mineralizable N (No = 145.92 mg kg

-1) in the model
of STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972) is concerned,
some models subestimated its value, such as those
described by JONES (92.2% of No), CABRERA
(88.1% of No) and BROADBENT (47.2% of No),
while other superestimated it, like those of
MARION et al. (103.6% of No), JUMA et al.
(113.9% of No), INOBUSHI et al. (118.1% do No),
and MOLINA et al. (118.1% of No).

Nitrogen mineralization rates obtained in
this work were higher than those cited in the
literature. This may be due to the nature of the
process, with intense mineralization in the first
weeks followed by a relatively long period of
stabilization when compared to the mineralization
periods. The occurrence of these high initial rates
may be associated with an increase of microbial
activity, induced by the handling and preparing of
the samples. This is a recognized fact, and some
authors even neglect the zero time mineralized N for
this reason (STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH, 1972), while
other (MATAR et al., 1991) start their calculations
of accumulated mineralized N from the 4th week.
Applying these methods to the data of the present
paper, mineralization rates decrease from an average
of 0.3196 week-1, to 0.2530 week-1, if considered

from the 2nd week, and to 0.129 week-1, if considered
from the 4th week (CAMARGO et al., 1997b).

The comparison of the models reveals that
the simple exponential model described well the
mineralization of organic N in soils from Southern
Brazil. The active fraction (N2) and the initial flux
(N1) parameters that compose the model of JONES
(1984) can represent the residual mineral N (N1)
that, together with the potentially mineralizable
fraction (N2) and could be used as a simplification
for N fertilizer recommendation. Considering that
the models studied in this paper are linked to that
one of STANFORD &amp;amp; SMITH (1972), but including
a higher number of parameters, the only model that
presented a significant increase 10% of the
explanation variability for mineralized N (F value;
Table 2), in relation to the model of STANFORD &amp;amp;
SMITH (1972) was the model of JONES (1984).

The double exponential models fit the
data satisfactorily, however, only a little
improvement was observed when compared to the
simple exponential ones, indicating that the
superparametrization of these models is not justified
when few points are used. In this case, the use of
models with more than tree parameters did not fit
very well because the low number of degrees of
freedom. Nevertheless, it is possible to conclude that
during the growing period, or during the incubation
period studied (32 weeks), there was no contribution
from the recalcitrant fraction to the mineralized
organic N balance. This fact is confirmed by data
obtained from 26 soils by KEENEY &amp;amp; BREMNER
(1966), who divided organic N into that found
before and after a year of incubation. The
differences between the divided organic forms in
this period were not significant, as well as the
recovery of exchangeable ammonium, showing that
such a situation does not require a higher number of
parameters for a better fit.

The unstable or easily mineralizable
fraction is mineralized at rates up to 10% per year
(HEBERT, 1982). In the present study, a rate of
about 7% was observed, characterizing the absence
of nitrogen originating from the recalcitrant fraction.
The double exponential models give a better fit than
the simple exponential models, which is expected
given the elevated number of parameters. However,
those models present indications of
superparametrization and the hypothesis that these
models characterize the presence of two forms of
organic N susceptible to mineralization can not be
sustained or is sometimes impossible
(DENDOOVEN et al., 1997). To test the hypothesis
that there are two organic N pools a 1-2 year-

period of incubation is need. In this case, it is
possible that the double exponential models would
show some advantages over the single exponential
models. Results from DOU et al. (1996) study show
that the pool size and mineralization rate parameters
in the different models are merely mathematically
defined quantities and do not represent any
rigorously-defined pool size of potentially-
mineralizable N and their mineralization rate
constants in the soils.

CONCLUSIONS

Based on the results obtained in this study
and on the numerical and graphical analysis of the
models, is possible to conclude that the simple
exponential model proposed by JONES (1984) is the
one that best describes the mineralization process
and the potential of organic N to be released to the
environment and to become available for plants.
