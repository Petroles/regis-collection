ABSTRACT

Weathering is a complex process comprising physical disaggregation, chemical and biological

decomposition of rocks and minerals transforming complex structure minerals in simpler ones.

Hydrolysis of silicates is perhaps the most important process but associated certainly to biological

weathering. It is discussed the role of waters: activities/concentrations of chemical species, pH, Eh,

importance of complexes. Weathering is not only a destructive process. It can concentrate chemical

species and form mineral deposits (kaolin, bauxite, Fe, Mn, P, Nb, Au). Weathering studies are

important in pedology, engineering geology, hydrogeology, paleoclimatology and ecology. The

use of stonemeal is based upon the study of rock weathering.

Key words: chemical weathering, hydrolysis of silicates, biological weathering, physicochemical
parameters of weathering.

INTRODUCTION

Weathering is a process characterized mainly by physical disaggregation and chemical decompo-

sition of rocks transforming structures of more complex minerals in others with simpler structures.

The transformation of tectosilicates (feldspars) in 1:1 phylosilicates represents well this process.

At the same time the neoformation of minerals such as kaolinites, iron oxides (goethite, hematite),

aluminum oxides-hydroxides (gibbsite, boehmite) which are stable at low temperature and pres-

sure (25?C, 1 atm) replacing higher temperature and pressure minerals is also representative of
supergene alteration.

The supergene alteration is dependent upon climate (rainfall and temperature), topography,

nature of rock (fissural system, texture and composition), influence of biosphere and controlled by

drainage conditions of the profile.

The hydrolysis of silicates is the most important process during the weathering. For example:

2KAISi3O8s,c,K-feldspar + 11H2Ol = 4H4SiO4aq + Al2Si2O5(OH)4s,c,kaolinite + 2K+aq + 2OH?aq
s = solid; c = crystalline; aq = aqueous; l = liquid

Hydrolysis of silicates is characterized by increasing of pH (OH?), leaching of alkaline and
earth alkaline cations and the partial or total leaching of H4SiO4. The formation of kaolinite means

a partial leaching of H4SiO4.

The supergene alteration of rocks produces “ alterites” (Figs. 1 and 2). Alterites are constituted

by neoformed supergenic minerals plus some primary minerals from preexisting rocks. (Fig. 1 –

(Pedro 1985 in Melfiet al. 1999)).

Fig. 1 – Alteration cover (alterite + soil) in relation to atmosphere and continental biosphere (Pedro 1985).

CHEMICAL WEATHERING OF MINERALS

In principle, all minerals can undergo destruction by weathering but normally the primary minerals

are less resistant than the secondary ones. Minerals can be listed according to their degree of

resistance to weathering. Fig. 3 displays a list of minerals in order of increasing resistance to

weathering.

Note: The exact position of minerals depends upon grain size, environmental conditions. Sec-

ondary minerals are at the bottom of the list as it could be expected. (See also Loughnan 1969,

Carrol 1970, Berner and Berner 1996).

The weathering of silicates especially their dissolution is not clearly explained. Muir and

Nesbitt 1992, conclude that silicate dissolution occurs by means of a protective layer of altered

composition which inhibits the migration of dissolved species to and from the surface of the mineral

(dislocations) on the mineral surface. (Nahon 1991). In general different chemical compositions

and the formation of etch pits (feldspars, pyroxenes and amphiboles) control the dissolution of

minerals.

Holdsen and Berner (1979) and Meunier (2003) present a discussion on the dissolution of pri-

mary phases during the supergene alteration. Meunier (2003) emphasizes that the dissolution starts

by the more energetic sites: surface, edges and vertices. The supergene alteration advances under

corrosion zones formed by the coalescence of dissolution of materials at the sites of dissolution.

BIOLOGICAL WEATHERING

Although the weathering of rocks is both a mechanical and mainly a chemical process the biological

influence is very important in the changes suffered by the rocks close to the surface. Acids produced

around the roots of living plants and by the bacterial decomposition of plants interact with rock

minerals increasing the chemical alteration of those minerals.

The upper part of the soil is a zone of intense biochemical activity. The bacterial population

near the surface is large but decreases downward with a steep gradient. The organic acids mainly

those with low molecular weight attack silicate minerals which commonly dissolve incongruently.

For instance, an organic acid, as oxalic acid, dissociates to form H+ ions:

H2C2O4aq = 2H+aq + C2O2?4aq
The H+ ions attack the silicate liberating its constituent chemical species:

H+aq + 4H2Ol + silicate = Al3+aq + Mn+aq + mH4SiO4aq
The C2O

2?
4 reacts with Al

3+ to form a chelate:

Al3+aq + C2O2?4aq = Al(C2O4)+aq
This latter reaction is a dissolution reaction very common at the uppermost acid portion of

most temperate soils.

Bacterial activity is responsible by the decomposition of the Al(C2O4)
+ and H2C2O4. The

oxalic acid and the oxalate are oxidized to CO2 and HCO
?
3 and the Al

3+ is liberated and precipitates
as Al(OH)3 or clay minerals. Thus the organic acids are responsible mainly by the low pH and

formation of organic complexes. The process does not preserve the organic acid.

WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION

When alterite material comes into contact with air (atmosphere), water (hydrosphere) and biosphere

(decomposing organic matter, living plants and animals) (Figs. 1 and 2), becomes organized into

structural patterns (soils) under the influence of the environmental conditions. Perhaps, climate

is the principal control of soil formation. High rainfall and low temperature both favor the accu-

mulation of organic debris in soils (Loughnan 1969, Retallack 1990). Retallack (1990) displays a

soil classification with ten types of soils according to climate and evolution. For example, oxysol

is considered a deeply weathered, reddish, kaolinite, clay-rich and iron-rich soil of tropical hu-

mid climates with almost no remaining primary minerals (formerly called laterites, lateritic soils,

latosols). In tropical soils there is little burial of organic matter and there is still intense leaching

of cations and silica due to heavier rainfall (&gt; 2000 mm per year). According to Melfiand Pedro

1977, the laterite and oxysols (latosols) cover about 65% of Brazil´s total surface, prevailing in all

of Amazon, Central and Southeastern regions of this country (Fig. 4).

WATERS

Rain waters coming into contact with rocks (and derived soils) react with primary and secondary

minerals or amorphous phases modifying the compositions of those waters. Rain waters increase

their content of ions released from the rocks and organic matter from the biosphere constituting

the soil waters. The composition of surface waters (in tropical and temperate areas) is represented

by common cations Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+ and normally the principal anion is HCO?3 . Activity
of ions, pH, Eh, complex ions can control the composition of soil, surface and ground waters. In

dilute solutions activities and concentrations are almost equal because the activity coefficients are

close to one (a = ? m; a = activity; m = concentration and ? = activity coefficient).

a – pH

pH (= ?log aH+ ) is controlled by the activity of various anions and cations. The
?

CO2 = aH2CO3 + aHCO?3 + aCO2?3
(or in dilute solutions the concentrations of those anions) is very important in controlling the pH.

The presence of organic acids is also of great importance. There is a competition between the

hydrolysis of silicates and the decomposition (bacterial or chemical decomposition) of organic

material. The rain water is a dilute solution of carbonic acid and its pH is around 5.65 (without

pollution). Rain water and surface waters coming into contact with rocks react with them which

release cations, H4SiO4 and OH
? from the hydrolysis of silicates. Normally without the presence

of organic matter and vegetation, the hydrolysis of silicates predominates and the pH is higher than

7. The OH? predominates in comparison with organic acids and the pH is basic as happens in
semiarid climates. In ground waters, the confined interaction between meteoric waters and rocks is

still the most important factor and the influence of organic matter and products of its decomposition

is much less important. The pH of ground waters is generally higher than 7. In surface waters (and

in soil waters), the hydrolysis of silicates and the OH? produced are neutralized by the CO2aq and
by the organic acids formed in soils from the decomposition of organic debris. The resultant pH

is lower than 7, in general, between 5.5 and 7 without anthropic pollution. In organic layers of the

podsols, the pH may reach 3.5. The industrial contamination increases the content of sulfuric and

nitric acids of the rain water constituting the acid rain. Normally the acid rain waters destroy the

buffering ability of HCO?3 leading to the decrease of pH of waters.
In sea water, there is also a competition between the acid volcanic gases and the hydrolysis

of silicates (Sillén 1961); the acid volcanic gases are CO2, HCl, HF, SO2, H2S and the hydrolysis

of silicates is from sea floor and from erosion products of continents. The resultant pH is around

8.2– 8.4. The sea water is buffered by the system
?

CO2 especially the HCO
?
3 ion.

The HCO?3 presents buffering ability in sea water and also in lakes and even in some rivers. The
equation HCO?3aq + H+aq = H2CO3aq shows that the H+ reacts with HCO?3 forming H2CO3 which
ionizes very little. The concentration of HCO?3 is almost equal at pH = 6.4 and 10.3 explaining
the buffering behavior of HCO?3 at a

?
CO2 = 10?3 (Fig. 5). In the presence of carbonate rocks

the buffering ability of HCO?3 increases because of higher HCO
?
3 concentration:

H+aq + CaCO3s = Ca2+aq + HCO?3aq .

b – Eh

The oxidation potential is another important parameter for the definition of geochemical charac-

teristics of water. Chemical species of Fe, S, Mn, C present several oxidation numbers and have

their behaviors dependent of Eh. The ratio Fe3+/Fe2+ is very important and the tendency is the
oxidation of Fe2+aq and the precipitation of Fe(OH)3 (or goethite and hematite). In latosols, the
oxidation-reduction of the Fe species is responsible (Fe2+aq = Fe3++ e?) by the dissolution – pre-
cipitation of the Fe in this type of soil associated certainly to the oscillation of water table in wet

and dry seasons.

Sulfur species especially S2? and SO2?4 are important in terms of Eh/pH and the occurrence
of sulfides (FeS2) and SO

2?
4 are quite characteristic. In acid mine drainage (Kim and Chon 2001,

Roisenberg et al. 2004), the oxidation of pyrite forms Fe2+aq , SO
2?
4aq + 2H+aq and the later oxidation

of Fe2+ to Fe3+ (or Fe(OH)3). The pH reaches values close 2 and Fe3+aq is in solution. When the
pH increases, the Fe3+ precipitates. Manganese species present five oxidation numbers (2+, 3+,

4+, 6+ and 7+). The Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ are very common and Mn6+ and Mn7+ are normally
present in laboratory conditions (MnO2?4 and MnO

?
4 ). The most common oxidation reaction in

terms of manganese is Mn2+aq + 2H2Ol = MnO2s,c + 4H+aq + 2e?.
Mn2+ is more stable than Fe2+; in other words, the oxidation of Fe2+ is faster than Mn2+.
The oxidation of carbon compounds to CO2 is one of the most common oxidation processes

in nature. The oxidation of carbon chemical species to CO2, H2CO3 or HCO
?
3 is very common in

soils, sediments and waters.

Other oxidation of ions as

U4+aq = U6+aq + 2e?; Ce3+aq = Ce4+aq + e? and Eu2+aq = Eu3+ + e?

are also important but not so common as those described above (Fe, S, Mn, C). The use of Eh-pH

diagrams became very frequent in geochemical literature in the last fifty years. (Garrels and Christ

1965).

c – Complex ions

Complex ions (inorganic or organic), ionic pairs (sea water) are association between ions or with

other chemical species which are responsible by the transport of chemical species in solution. The

stability of complex ions depends on their constants of stability. Carbonates form more stable

complexes with HREE than LREE (it depends on ionic radius).

APPLICATION OF WEATHERING STUDIES

a – The weathering is not only a destructive process. The rocks are leached by rain, soil and surface

waters and many chemical species are dissolved and transported. However, the residual material

may represent a concentration of chemical species constituting a mineral deposit. The final result

is the formation of laterites and lateritic soils. Mineral deposits such as of Fe, Mn, P, Nb, Au,

kaolin and bauxites may be formed in lateritic environment. (Fig. 6). For example, the genesis of

kaolin of Rio Jarí (Montes et al. 2002) is related to the weathering of Cretaceous Alter do Chão

Formation (Amazon) with the neoformation of a new generation of kaolinite and leaching of iron

resulting in an enrichment of kaolinite forming the important deposits of Rio Jarí kaolin. Similarly,

at the high places the more advanced leaching of H4SiO4 led to the formation of bauxites.

Fig. 6 – The solubility of aluminum hydroxide, amorphous silica and ferric oxide in terms of ph in superficial conditions.

In deposits of Fe and Mn is very common the oxidation and dissolution – precipitation of Fe

and Mn, respectively.

b – In many cases, a thick lateritic cover might hide deeper important mineral deposits and we

may use geochemical prospection of soils, sediments and waters for making the prospection of the

elements we look for.

c – Other important application of weathering studies is the transformation of lateritic soils (or

latosols) in podzols – (Pedro 1985, Lucas et al. 1989, Melfiet al. 1999).

It is a unique example the transformation of yellow latosol in podsol that occurs in the Amazon

region as an effect of hydromorphism (Melfiet al. 1999). (Figs. 7 and 8) – Latosols become white

quartz sands. The soils associated to the Cretaceous Alter do Chão Formation are progressively

more arenaceous toward their lower parts by the dissolution of iron species and kaolinite. The soils

will become more acid until the forests start degrading being replaced by “ campinarana”, a new

type of vegetation. The podzolization is characterized by the whitening of upper horizons with

the individualization of a humic B horizon. The podzolided soils are formed from latosols in a

transformation system (latosol – podzol).

Two types of water streams draining the system can be found. One type drains the lateritic

basin; it displays clear water and is poor in dissolved organic material, high dissolved Si species

and very low concentration of Al and Fe species. The second type, which drains podzolic regions,

has brownish waters due to dissolved organic material and also has high concentration of iron

and aluminum chemical species and low content of silicon dissolved species. The particulate

fraction is important being made up of quartz, kaolinite and gibbsite. Organic-metalic complexes

are responsible by the transport of Al and Fe species in solution (Melfiet al. 1999).

d – Studies of weathering are fundamental in Engineering Geology, Hydrogeology and practical

applications of Geology. In Engineering Geology, the search of materials used in the construction

of roads, dams and houses include certainly studies of supergene alteration of those materials.

In Hydrogeology, the studies of ground and surface waters obviously involve the interaction

water-rock (also supergene alterations).

e – Paleoclimatology and Ecology are very dependent on research in weathering. For example,

the study of alterites and soils is important because they may be associated to the development of

vegetation (including forests), playing an important role in the bioclimatic balance of the planet

(Melfiet al. 1999).

Alterites (especially laterites) are important marks in Paleoclimatology mainly in regions

tectonically stable.

STONEMEAL

According to Leonardos and Theodoro 1999, “ Under our conditions of lateritic soils we must,

as an important step towards sustainable development, restore to the leached soils, the balanced

inorganic meal on which crops and biodiversity can be properly fed. Stonemeal is Nature’s approach

to achieve overall soil fertility. The use of soluble fertilizers like NPK is only supported in limited

amounts and only if coupled or preceded by stonemeal soil reminalization.”

The use of stonemeal has as principle the weathering of rocks with release of major species

as (H4SiO4, Ca
2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+) or minor species (Ni2+, CO2+, Cr3+ and others), correction of

pH (OH? from hydrolysis of silicates).
The choice of the rock and conditions for stonemeal depends on various factors:

a – Chemical composition – for example, basic and alkaline rocks are ideal; rocks rich in SiO2,

especially quartz, are not adequate. Volcanic rocks are very good because the supergene

alteration is not slow (fine grain, sometimes glass);

b – The transport of the rocks may not be long (increase cost);

c – The addition of organic material together is certainly very important because it would bring

about a faster alteration of the stonemeal;

d – Normally the stonemeal must precede (or be simultaneous with) the addition of other fertilizers.
