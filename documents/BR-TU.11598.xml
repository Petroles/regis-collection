ABSTRACT: Soil loss expectation and possible relationships among soil erosion, riparian vegetation
and water quality were studied in the São José dos Dourados River basin, State of São Paulo, Brazil.
Through Geographic Information System (GIS) resources and technology, Soil Loss Expectation (SLE)
data obtained using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model were analyzed. For the whole
catchment area and for the 30 m buffer strips of the streams of 22 randomly selected catchments, the
predominant land use and habitat quality were studied. Owing mainly to the high soil erodibility, the
river basin is highly susceptible to erosive processes. Habitat quality analyses revealed that the
superficial water from the catchments is not chemically impacted but suffers physical damage. A high
chemical purity is observed since there are no urban areas along the catchments. The water is physically
poor because of high rates of sediment delivery and the almost nonexistence of riparian vegetation.
Key words: erosion modeling, expectation of soil loss map, riparian vegetation, water quality

RISCO DE PERDA DE SOLO E QUALIDADE DO HABITAT NUMA
BACIA HIDROGRÁFICA DE MESO-ESCALA

RESUMO: Expectativa de perda de solo e possíveis relações entre erosão, vegetação ripária e qualidade
da água foram estudados na bacia do rio São José dos Dourados (SP). Através de recursos de
geoprocessamento e da Equação Universal de Perda de Solos, os dados sobre expectativa de perda de
solo foram levantados. Para a área de drenagem total e a faixa tampão dos corpos d’água de 22 sub-
bacias aleatoriamente selecionadas, analisou-se a cobertura do solo predominante e qualidade do
habitat. Devido principalmente à alta erodibilidade do solo, a área estudada é altamente suscetível ao
processo erosivo. As análises de qualidade da água revelaram que as águas superficiais das sub-
bacias estão quimicamente não impactadas, mas fisicamente degradadas. A alta pureza química deve-
se, possivelmente, à ausência de áreas urbanizadas ao longo das sub-bacias e as alterações nas
características físicas são, possivelmente, decorrentes das altas taxas de transferência de sedimento
aos corpos d’água e à quase ausência de mata ciliar.
Palavras-chave: modelagem de erosão, expectativa de perda de solo, vegetação ripária, qualidade da

INTRODUCTION

The land use of a catchment exerts an impor-
tant impact on the erosive processes within a region
(Lufafa et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2003) and on the
health of rivers (Naiman &amp;amp; Décamps, 1997). This re-
lationship has been investigated worldwide (Silva &amp;amp;
Williams, 2001; Allan, 2004), and in Brazil some stud-
ies have been carried out to better understand such re-
lations (Alvares &amp;amp; Silva, 2005; Barrella &amp;amp; Petrere,
2003; Casatti et al., 2006).

Owing to important and interesting components
that are favorable to some human activities (Fischer et

al., 2000; Allan, 2004) riparian vegetation has been con-
stantly and directly affected by deforestation worldwide.
Jobin et al. (2004) point out that in North America over
90% of riparian habitats have been lost over the last 200
years, mostly due to intensive agriculture, which has
also contributed to the degradation of the originally for-
ested landscape. In Brazil, especially in the São Paulo
State, the level of degradation is similar (Kronka et al.,
2002), and such degradation has occurred mainly over
the last 100 years. Changes in riparian vegetation can
influence channel morphology, rates of erosion and
deposition, and by extension, the entire sediment bud-
get of a reach (Allan, 2004).

For this purpose, modern technology has pro-
vided effective analytical tools such as remote sens-
ing and satellite imaging, GIS, and expert systems to
facilitate studies of environmental impacts. Addition-
ally, habitat and water quality are also evaluated using
individual variables or combined metrics (Casatti et al.,
2006). Thus, a wide variety of assessment methods
is available to evaluate the response of stream condi-
tions to a gradient in land use (Allan, 2004). Although
these studies have become more common over the past
20 years, they leave many questions unanswered. For
instance, there is still an ongoing dispute as to whether
the land use of the entire catchment or that of the ri-
parian zone is more important in influencing the wa-
ter quality, all other factors remaining constant (Sliva
&amp;amp; Williams, 2001).

In this study we estimated the expectation of
soil loss and also analyzed possible relationships that
the erosive process has with the habitat quality in the
river network of the São José dos Dourados river ba-
sin (SJD).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study area
The study area is a meso-scale river basin

situated in the Northwest of São Paulo State (South-
eastern Brazil), between latitudes 20o15’36" and
20o51’32" and longitudes 49o31’30" and 51o21’32"
(Figure 1). It is a 6th order basin (Strahler, 1957) and
encompasses a drainage area of 5,158.9 km2. It com-
prises a delimited area for water resources and is lo-
cated in the Serra Geral formation, with basalt and
sedimentary rocks of the Caiuá and Bauru groups
(IPT, 2000).

The climate is of the hot tropical type (Nimer,
1989), with maximum mean temperatures ranging
from 31 to 32°C, and minimum mean temperatures of
13° to 14°C. The average annual rainfall ranges from

1,300 to 1,800 mm. The predominant original vegeta-
tion is “Semi Deciduous Seasonal Forest”, but patches
of Savanna (“Cerrado”) also occur in the area.

The SJD river basin is an important agricul-
tural region, presenting one of the highest livestock
populations for milk and meat production in Brazil
(named mix production – CATI, 2006). Thus, pasture
is the main land-cover class that occurs in the region
(Casatti et al., 2006). The soil and water resources
have been severely degraded due to diverse causes: soil
erosion (consequence of soil/soil-cover mismanage-
ment), increasing urban populations and related water
pollution problems, among others (Casatti et al., 2006;
IPT, 2000).

USLE application
The soil loss expectation data were surveyed

using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (Wischmeier &amp;amp;
Smith, 1978): A = R . K . L . S . C . P; where: A is
the rate of soil loss (t ha-1 y-1), R is a factor for an-
nual rainfall erosivity (MJ mm ha-1 h-1  y-1), K is a fac-
tor for soil erodibility (t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1), L, S, C
and P are dimensionless factors for slope length, slope
steepness, cover management, and supporting prac-
tices, respectively. The information concerning to the
six parameters of the USLE were computed using
GIS technology (Idrisi 3.2 (Eastman, 2001)), as ex-
plained below.

R factor – this layer was elaborated using the
database and the digital map of the rainfall erosivity,
extracted from the database elaborated and cited by
Silva (2004). K factor – this one was generated by us-
ing the São Paulo State pedological map (1:500,000)
and assigned values according to soil class as studied
by Silva &amp;amp; Alvares (2005). LS factor - a 30-meter
resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study
area was used. By using the DEM and the USLE-2D
freeware (Desmet &amp;amp; Govers, 1996), the LS factor was
generated, where the value of each cell corresponds
to the LS factor. C and P factor - were generated (C
and P jointly) using a digital land cover map, originally
divided into ten land cover categories. This map was
elaborated using a Landsat 5 (TM) image dated from
July – 1996 and the supervised classification method
(Lillesand &amp;amp; Kiefer, 2000). The C and P values were
assigned according to the land cover category obtained
from Bertoni &amp;amp; Lombardi Neto (1990); Mitchell &amp;amp;
Bubenzer (1980) and Silva (1999).

Once all existing information about each USLE
factors and their respective layers was gathered, the
soil loss expectation was calculated by the multiplica-
tion of the layers (Silva et al., 2003). The results were
reclassified into five interpretation classes (Silva et al.,
2003).Figure 1 - Location of the study area within the São Paulo State.

Riparian buffer zone determination
Following Narumalani et al. (1997), the map

containing the buffer zone of the river network of the
study area was elaborated using the land cover and
digital river network map. Subsequently, the dimension
of the buffer zone (30 meters) was decided accord-
ing to the values determined by the Brazilian Forest
Code (Brasil, 1965). Hence, the buffer zones were ex-
tracted using the river network, and the “Buffer” rou-
tine of the Idrisi 3.2 software (Eastman, 2001). The
maps containing the buffer zones and the land cover
were overlayed (“Overlay” routine of the Idrisi, with
the multiplication option), to generate a new map con-
taining the land cover for the buffer zones only. Fi-
nally, the areas of each land cover class were calcu-
lated (“Area” routine of the Idrisi).

Water and habitat quality analyses
The water quality was determined for twenty

two randomly chosen sampling points (Figure 2), six-
teen located in first-order rivers, classified in accor-
dance to the Strahler system of hydrographic hierar-
chy (Strahler, 1957), three points in second-order riv-
ers and three in third-order rivers. To minimize the in-
fluence of the seasonal variability, field work was car-
ried out during the beginning of the dry season (March
to June, 2003). A 75 m stretch was chosen at each
side of the stream with the aim of including all avail-
able macro-habitats (Casatti et al., 2006).

Water quality assessment included the devel-
opment of physical and chemical water indexes
(PCWI) and the physical habitat index (HI). For the
composition of the PCWI at each sampling point the
parameters dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, turbid-
ity (all measured “in situ” through digital meter Horiba®,

model U-10), orthophosphate, nitrate, and ammonia (all
analyzed in a specialized laboratory) were measured.
In addition, water odors were recorded and water sur-
face oils were also visually documented as indicators
of possible human disturbance of a stream reach
(Barbour et al., 1999). All parameters were compared
against conditions observed in the totally protected
water courses in the Morro do Diabo State Park (Silva,
2005), where the Atlantic Forest covers the entire wa-
tersheds. A metric raw score was developed based on
the deviation from the reference condition and the av-
erage final score for each site was separated into four
categories (good, fair, poor, and very poor). The com-
plete procedures of sampling can be found in Casatti
et al. (2006).

Following Roth et al. (1996), nine metrics
were used to compose the Habitat Index (HI), which
are: substrate stability, velocity and depth variability,
flow stability, bottom deposition, combinations of pool-
riffle-run, channel alteration, streamside cover, bank
vegetative stability, and bank stability. Complete and
detailed explanation of the PCWI and HI is available
in Casatti et al. (2006).

All the sampling points were geo-referenced
and plotted over the Digital Elevation Model of the
study area using the Idrisi program. The respective
catchment areas of each sampling point were on-screen
and manually digitalized. The layer of drainage area of
each of the sampling point was intersected with the
SLE, land-cover and buffer maps. Using these maps,
the catchment area, the percentage of occurrence of
each class of the SLE map, of each land cover cat-
egory (total catchment area) and of the predominant
land cover category - specifically for the 30 m ripar-

ian zone (including the percentage of remnant riparian
vegetation that occurs along the 30m buffer strip) -
were calculated.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

USLE application
Annual erosivity of the studied area increased

from east to west along the basin, ranging from
5,842 to 6,742 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1, being considered
of “medium-high” erosivity. The soil map and erod-
ibility values for the region show that the soils of the
river basin are highly erodible in approximately 94%
of the area. The soil class “Acrisol” occurs over
93.1% of the whole area and this class has the great-
est erodibility, classified as “very high erodibility”
mainly due the abrupt textural change and the high
sand percentage (Oliveira et al., 1999; Silva &amp;amp;
Alvares, 2005).

The LS factor map was reclassified into six
classes, according to LS values: “&lt;1” (occurring in
21.4% of the study area), “=1” (0%). The classes “3”,
“4”, “5”, and “6”, wich correspond, respectively, to
intervals of “1.1-10.0”, “10.1-50.0”, “50.1-100.0” and
“&gt;100.1”, occurred in 0.4%, 30.2%, 35.3% and
12.6%, respectively. The LS factor closely reflected
the overall topographic pattern of the region (predomi-
nance of flat to slowly undulating relief).

The land cover map of the basin (Figure 3) in-
dicates pasture as the predominant land-cover class,
occurring in 78.1%. For this land-cover class the val-
ues 0.1607 and 0.7000 were attributed to C and P
USLE factors, respectively. The remnant vegetation
class occurs in 6.9% of the study area and the C and
P values most appropriate for this class are 0.0024 and
1.000, respectively, (Bertoni &amp;amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990;
Mitchell &amp;amp; Bubenzer, 1980; Silva, 1999).

The category “urban places” occurs in 0.6%
of the river basin. The C factor was 0.1242 (Silva,
1999). Normally the value P = 1 is attributed to this
land cover category (Silva et al., 2003). In some cases,
however, there are some activities developed within the
urban area that can reduce erosion and land degrada-
tion. Consequently, considering this possibility, the P
value adopted for “urban places” was 0.95. Refores-
tation is a land-cover category occurring in a very
small percentage within the study area (0.02%). The
C value was 0.0470 and the P value was 1.000. The
attribution of P = 1 is because in Brazil usually no soil
conservation practices are used in reforestation activi-
ties (Kronka et al., 2002). Thus, the combined C.P
value is 0.047.

The class “perennial cultures” occurs in 3.2%
of the area, and is composed mainly of orange or-
chards and rubber tree plantations, although a few
coffee plantations also occur. The values attributed
were: C = 0.2190 and P = 0.40 (combined C.P =
0.088). The class “annual crops” occurs in 0.20%
of the study area and is represented by the corn and
soybean fields. For this class the C and P values
were, respectively, 0.1720 and 0.5000 (C.P = 0.086)
(Bertoni &amp;amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990; Mitchell &amp;amp;
Bubenzer, 1980; Silva, 1999).

"Sugar cane" and "bare soil", two closely re-
lated land covers, occur in 2.1% and 6.9%, respec-
tively, of the SJD river basin. For sugar cane the at-
tributed C and P values were, respectively, 0.1743 and
0.7000, while for bare soil the attributed values were,
respectively, 1.000 (soil totally uncovered) and 0.70
(Mitchell &amp;amp; Bubenzer, 1980). The combined C and P
values were 0.122 and 0.700, respectively, for sugar
cane and bare soil. The class "water bodies" occurs
in 1.82% of the area and has negligible significance

for soil loss, while the class “others” - that occurs in
0.2%, was attributed by convention, the values 0.14
and 1.00, for C and P factors, respectively (Silva et
al., 2003).

The result of the combination of the USLE fac-
tors revealed that there is a predominance of the class
that indicates “very high” soil loss expectation (that
means a soil loss expectation higher than 200 t ha-1

year-1). This class occurs in 73.4% of the area. The
class “null” (0 - 10 t ha-1 year-1) is the second pre-
dominant class and occurs in 15.3%, followed by class
“medium” (15 – 50 t ha-1 year-1) with 7.3%, “medium
to high” (50 - 120 t ha-1 year-1) with 2.9%, “high” (120
- 200 t ha-1 year-1) with 0.8% and “moderate” (10 -
15 t ha-1 year-1) with 0.3%. Through the routine “re-
gress” of the Idrisi, it was possible to verify that the
USLE factor that presented the closest relation with
SLE was the CP (r2 = 0.491).

Water and habitat quality analyzes
Table 1 summarizes the percentage occurrence

of each soil loss expectation, the percentage of rem-
nant riparian vegetation for a 30m buffer strip, the num-
ber of headwaters, the main land-use in the catchments
and in the respective 30m buffer strip, and the classifi-
cation of physical, chemical and habitat quality indexes.

As occurred in the whole river basin, pasture
was the predominant land cover class for the 22 in-
vestigated catchments, with occurrences higher than
75%. Similarly, pasture was the main land cover class
that occurred for the 30m buffer for most catchments,
the only exception being catchment number eighteen,
where for the buffer zone the predominant land cover
class was remnant natural vegetation.

The results of physico-chemical and habitat
quality analyses indicate that the streams are only slightly
affected chemically, because eighteen catchments pre-
sented a physico-chemical condition classified as “good”
and four classified as “fair”. On the other hand, the habi-
tat characteristics are strongly affected, because one
catchment had a physical quality classified as “very
poor”, sixteen were considered “poor”, five “fair” and
not a single one was considered as “good”. The per-
centage of riparian remnant forest along the 30m buffer
strip varied from 0 to 50.8% and eight of them did not
present any riparian vegetation cover.

The soil loss expectation class “&gt; 200 t ha-1 y-1”
presented predominant occurrence in all twenty-two
catchments, the occurrence varying from 59.8 to
90.4%. The hierarchical order of the stream did not
impede the degradation of the habitat quality and the
level of degradation can be ratified by the soil expec-
tation loss, which for all watersheds was predomi-
nantly “&gt; 200”.

Regarding the erosive process, the western re-
gion of the state presents elevated susceptibility to ero-
sion because of the high erodibility of both the soil and
the geological basement (IPT, 1997), which results in
sandy and highly detachable soils. Other river basins
located in such regions (Aguapeí, Peixe, for instance)
also present high susceptibility to erosion for the same
reason (IPT, 1997).

The resulting database obtained in this study
concerning soil loss expectation is in agreement with
the erosion map published by IPT (1997) for the en-
tire São Paulo State, based on geological, pedological
and geomorphological maps. The high occurrence of
areas showing high expectation of soil loss was also
verified by Cerri et al. (2001) for Piracicaba River Ba-
sin and, according to these authors, the main driving
forces were the kind of land cover and the absence
of adequate soil tillage practices.

Because the studied region may be highly sus-
ceptible to erosive processes, the use of conservation
practices is crucial, but the scenario is completely dif-
ferent. Through field trips it was verified that the use
of soil conservation practices is rare, relatively recent,
and in some regions the cattle density is high, leading
to overgrazing. Pasture, the main land-cover class re-
ported in this study, is a long term and significant part
of SJD land use and is a critical component of rural
landscape in São Paulo State. The main function of
pasture is as a primary support system for livestock.
It can affect conservation and environmental planning
in several ways, including soil carbon storage, soil
quality, and water quality. Depending on the way live-
stock and pasture are managed, the effect of livestock
on such parameters is highly significant (Al-Kaisi &amp;amp;
Hanna, 2004).

The class “urban settlement” did not occur in
any of the 22 catchments. This is, probably, the pri-
mary and main reason that explains the good chemi-
cal quality of the water observed for almost all
catchments. Sliva &amp;amp; Williams (2001) mention urban-
ization as the main factor that influences the chemical
quality of streams in Ontario (Canada), a result also
supported by Daniel et al. (2002) for the Piracicaba
River Basin (Brazil).

The second possible cause that explains the
good chemical condition of the stream water is the
chemical composition of the soil types of the catch-
ment area. Acrisol is the predominant soil unit (Oliveira
et al., 1999) and the Acrisol occurring in São Paulo
State is mostly sandy, with clays of low activity
(Bertoni &amp;amp; Lombardi Neto, 1990). This indicates that
the amount of chemical components removed from the
soil and delivered to the drainage channels is relatively
low.

The third possible reason is that the farmers
do not use fertilizers in pasture management (the main
species used for pasture seems to be Brachiaria
decumbens Stapf). Thus, when runoff occurs, there
is no fertilizer to be transported. On the other hand,
as this species is tolerant to soils of low fertility and
is highly adapted to Brazilian climatic conditions, it is
widely used (Mattos, 2001). As cattle are normally
mismanaged and the pasture is typically overgrazed,
the soil surface becomes poorly covered and highly
susceptible to erosion (Sparovek, 1996).

The association of livestock with pasture man-
agement, and the need for livestock to have access to
water, also intensifies the problems associated to soil
stability and water quality (Al-Kaisi &amp;amp; Hanna, 2004).
The deterioration of pasture cover due to intensive
grazing can be a very significant source of pollution
from both sediment and animal waste. To improve the
water quality of the SJD river basin, the producers that
work with livestock in pasture should find ways to
keep animals out of streams and find alternative wa-
ter sources. Rotational grazing might be a good op-
tion for managing the quantity and quality of vegeta-
tion so as to improve water quality, since this kind of
management system allows soil and vegetation time to
recover from grazing and restore good soil conditions
(Al-Kaisi &amp;amp; Hanna, 2004).

The majority of the stream reaches (77.2%)
present poor or very poor physical habitat conditions
for supporting aquatic wildlife communities (especially
fishes, according to Casatti et al., 2006). Such authors
observed, through field visits, that many small first-or-
der streams listed in the official hydrographic map of
the SJD river basin (which is from the 1970s) do not
exist anymore, being dry and completely silted. This
current and hazardous situation of high level degrada-
tion of the water (physical parameters) of the in-stream
habitat of the SJD river basin is partially due to the high
level of degradation of the riparian vegetation existing
in the catchments (Sliva &amp;amp; Williams, 2001; Allan, 2004).

The study area is in a worse condition than that
showed in IPT (1997 and 2000). Therefore, it is sug-
gested that extremely urgent and planned actions are
adapted, perhaps beginning the restoring actions of the
catchments with 0% riparian vegetation (Table 1).
These areas should be the first to receive action and
resources owing to the present expectation of soil loss.
The divulgation of these data to city managers and re-
gional populations is also extremely important and ur-
gent to show the seriousness of the situation, to stimu-
late the perception of the need for environmental con-
servation / repair, and also to facilitate a joint and co-
hesive action to improve the environmental quality of
the São José dos Dourados River Basin.

CONCLUSIONS

The predominant land cover (pasture) and
soil mismanagement have intensified erosion within
the study area. The results revealed the high level
of environmental degradation that the SJD river ba-
sin is suffering, with 77.2% of the catchments hav-
ing water of poor or very poor physical character-
istics for the sustenance of aquatic wildlife. Actions
for the restoration of the riparian vegetation (or, at
least, a part of it) are extremely important and ur-
gent to conserve and recuperate water resources
and wildlife (terrestrial and aquatic) of this river ba-
sin.
