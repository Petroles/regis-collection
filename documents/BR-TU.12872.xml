Resumo 

 

 

Os biocombustiveis têm sido alvo de grandes estudos nos últimos anos devido à 

escassez do petróleo.  

O bioetanol é dos biocombustiveis mais produzidos no mundo, contudo o seu 

processo de purificação torna-se dispendioso na medida em que este só pode 

ser usado em misturas com combustíveis fósseis se tiver cerca de 99.5% de 

pureza. Tem-se vindo a estudar alternativas aos solventes usados na destilação 

extrativa de etanol, de forma a minimizar os custos de operação. 

Os líquidos iónicos são vistos como uma solução para muitos dos problemas na 

indústria química num futuro próximo, devido às suas propriedades invulgares. 

O objetivo desta dissertação é estudar o equilíbrio líquido vapor de sistemas de 

líquido iónico-etanol ou água. Para o efeito medimos dois sistemas 

experimentais num ebuliómetro: cloreto de 1-butil-3-metilimidazólio e cloreto de 

colina com etanol a três pressões. Usou-se depois o modelo COSMO RS para 

efectuar a modelação dos dados. Discutem-se os vários factores que 

influenciam o comportamento dos sistemas.

Abstract 
 

 

Biofuels have been an important subject of study, mainly because of 

petroleum scarcity.   

Bioethanol is the most used biofuel as alternative to petrol, but the 

purification cost is high and in order to use bioethanol mixed with 

hydrocarbons, it needs to be 99.5 % pure. Alternatives for solvents to be 

used in ethanol’s extractive distillation are being investigated.  

The ionic liquids are seen as a solution to many of the problems in the 

chemical industry in the near future, due to their excellent properties.  

The purpose of this dissertation is to study the behavior of different ionic 

liquid – ethanol or water systems. This has been achieved through the study 

of two systems by ebulliometry: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 

choline chloride at three different pressures. Finally using COSMO RS, the 

modeling of the experimental data was made. Are also discussed several 

factors that influence the behavior of those systems.

1 Historical Introduction 

 

Energy is a determinant factor that influences and limits our lives and the 

technological progress of our society. Petroleum, the most powerful and plentiful source 

of energy consists on a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, that occurs in the  

result of organic remains deposition on the bottom of lakes and seas, which are 

undergoing chemical changes over millions of years
1
. 

The petroleum era began about 150 years ago and easily available energy has 

supported major advances in agriculture, industry, transportation and indeed many 

diverse activities overvalued by human beings. Now world petroleum and natural gas 

supplies have peaked and their supplies will slowly decline over the next 50 years until 

depletion
2
.  

Small amounts of petroleum and natural gas will remain underground but their 

extraction will be energetically and economically not viable. Although people are still 

comfortable with the security provided by fossil energy, especially petroleum and 

natural gas, they appear to be slow to recognize the energy crisis in the world. Oil, 

natural gas, coal and nuclear power provide more than 88% of world energy needs and 

the other 12% is provided by various renewable energy sources
1, 3

.  

Renewable energy technologies already exist, but more research is needed to 

improve their efficiency, costs and consequently their wide acceptance and 

applicability. During the last decade, biofuels have emerged as an alternative to 

petroleum-based energy sources for some applications.

2 Biofuels 
 

Biofuels are a wide range of fuels derived from biomass, which are gaining 

increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as petroleum price 

spikes, the need for increased energy security, and concern over greenhouse 

gas emissions from fossil fuels
4
. 

In a political-economic point of view, the biggest advantage of its use is to make 

countries less dependent on petroleum sources and its variations prices and availability
5
. 

Aiming at reducing the European countries dependency towards petroleum, the 

European Union (EU) has policies to implement renewable sources on the already 

available energy sources, through the Directive 2003/30/EC which aims that "member 

states should ensure that is placed on their markets a minimum proportion of renewable 

biofuels” (Figure 2)
5
.  

 

 

Figure 2- Minimum percentage of biofuel incorporation [3] 

 

In Portugal, the strategy for the introduction of biofuels on the market is based 

primarily on their blend in conventional fuels, within limits that allow their use in 

vehicles without requiring additional modifications to the country vehicles fleet.  

Biofuels can be classified in two different categories: first and second generation 

fuels.

It is referred as first generation fuels, fuels that have been derived from sources 

like starch, sugar, animal fats and vegetable oil, such as ETBE, biodiesel and bioethanol 

and first generation feedstocks are characterized by the fact that only parts of the plants 

are used for biofuel production. These types of fuels are obtained using conventional 

techniques of production and they offer the greatest short-term potentials of biofuels 

today. Although they differ in properties, technical requirements, economical aspects 

and potential, they contribute to guarantee long-term mobility when comparing 

environmental and social costs with conventional fuels
1, 6

. 

In other hand, second generation biofuels are not yet commercially available 

because their conversion technologies still need some improvement. BTL fuels and 

ethanol from lignocelluloses are examples of this type of fuels. Some sources define 

second generation fuels as biomass-to-liquid technologies, which are intended to use 

lignocellulosic biomass. They have been developed to overtake first generation biofuels 

important manufacture limitations. And unlike those, second generation feedstock types 

can provide the opportunity to use almost the entire plant and not only some parts of it
1, 

6
.  

Currently the most used biofuels are biodiesel and bioethanol.  

 

3 Bioethanol 

 

Bioethanol is a fuel that has different origins, such as biomass or petrochemical 

processes and its molecular formula is C2H6O.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3– Molecular structure of Ethanol [5] 



Also known as ethyl alcohol, it is a flammable and colorless chemical 

compound, every so often represented as “EtOH” or as C2H5OH. In Table 1 are shown 

the most important properties of ethanol.

It can be produced from any biological feedstock that contains appreciable 

amounts of sugar or materials that can be converted into sugars such as starch or 

cellulose. 
7
Two examples of feedstock for ethanol production are sugar beets and sugar 

cane which contain high percentages of sugar. Corn, wheat, barley, rye and other cereals 

are typical feedstock’s containing starch in their kernels. A large variety of feedstock is 

available for producing ethanol from biomass that contains large amounts of cellulose 

and hemicellulose
3
.  

Sugars can be easily fermented and starch can be converted into sugar and then 

into ethanol. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugar, though with more 

difficulty than conversion of starch. 

. Ethanol is considered a clean source of energy not only by the significant 

amount of heat released in combustion, but also because it has an oxygen atom, about 

35% of its mass is composed with oxygen. Thus, when blend with conventional fuel, the 

combustion is cleaner, helping to reduce polluting emissions and it is used as an octane 

enhancer. Ethanol seems to be one of the most realistic options for setting up a truly 

global bioenergy trade, at least within the present decade. Use of ethanol fuel is growing 

rapidly as it has a considerable potential for substituting oil in the transportation sector, 

given the right conditions. To be mixed with fossil fuels, the ethanol must be further 

processed in order to remove the water contained, requiring additional fossil energy 

inputs to achieve 99.5% of pure alcohol
6
.  



It is also expected to exhibit an exponential growth provided by the tax 

incentives in order to reduce atmospheric pollution. 

 

 

3.1- Ethanol Vs Petrol 

 

While bioethanol is one of the major biomass energy commodities, most of it is 

commercialized for alcoholic beverages, for solvent purposes and industrial 

applications. There is a need to maximize some of the many favorable properties of 

ethanol in order to achieve better results in biofuels market. Table 2 shows a 

comparison between bioethanol and fossil fuel properties.

Calorific Value  kJ/L 32.18 22.35 

Octane Number  RON 92 &gt;100 

Ignition Temperature °C 220 420 

    

 

The octane number measure the resistance of a fuel to self-ignition and 

detonation. It is determined by comparing, under standard conditions, the intensity of 

the detonation between the fuel and two reference fuels, such as iso-octane, which 

resists detonation, and heptane, which detonates readily. The value of octane number is 

the percentage by volume of iso-octane in the iso-octane-heptane mixture that matches 

the fuel being tested in a standard test engine and it influences the anti-detonation 

property of the fuel. The ability of detonation describes an uncontrolled combustion 

which puts heavy mechanical and thermal loads on the engine. So, a higher octane 

number stands for an anti-detonation fuel which permits the engine a more efficient use 

of the energy provided from the combustion heat.    



Ethanol is well known as an excellent anti-detonation additive and as an 

improver of the octane when blended with petrol, because of that its octane number is 

higher than conventional fuels.   

Table 2 also shows that, the calorific value of ethanol and petrol are different. 

Due to this difference, the energy yield of ethanol is one third lower than petrol. The 

energy of petrol is 32.5 MJ/L and 21.2 MJ/L for ethanol. For a better explanation, one 

liter of ethanol only replaces 0.65 liters of petrol.  

Another and important fuel property is its volatility. To perform a correct 

combustion, the fuel needs to be perfectly mixed with air. Although petrol has a higher 

calorific number, ethanol has a higher vapor pressure and, consequently, ethanol 

vaporizes more readily than conventional fuel and the resultant combustion is superior 

when it is utilized ethanol or blends composed with ethanol and petrol.   

Ethanol is thus, and regardless of the production process, an exceedingly good 

alternative to petrol use.  

 

3.2- Extraction processes of Ethanol 

 

 According to the literature, in 1994 the world production capacity for synthetic 

ethanol was about 2.6 million of tons per year and the major producer was USA. The 

production of ethanol by fermentation from agricultural products was just about 4 300 

000 tons per year in the same country. Nowadays, it is produced about 12.9 million tons 

per year of bioethanol and the major producer country is Brazil, followed by India and 

then USA.  

Formerly, ethanol was manufactured from ethylene by two ways: indirect 

hydration by addition of sulfuric acid and subsequent saponification of the sulfuric acid 

ester; and direct catalyst hydration. In the first method of production, the selectivity of 

ethanol is about 86% and in the second one is around 97%.  

In order to produce ethanol from biomass, basically there are three different 

processes: corn-to ethanol, basic lignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol and integrated 

lignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol. 
8
 

In the corn to-ethanol biorefinery, there are two major processes: the dry-grind 

and the wet mill. The first is a conventional method to obtain ethanol and consists of 



grinding, cooking, liquefaction, saccharification of the starch to sugars with enzymes, 

fermentation of the sugars to ethanol followed by distillation and dehydration 

processes.
8-9

  

The wet mill process consists on a pre-processing prior to fermentation to 

ethanol and it can produce high-value co-products such as fibers, germ and gluten. 

Consequently, it is a more expensive and energy intensive process.
8
 

The lignocellulosic biomass to- ethanol process can be a more promising and 

effective alternative. Processes of this type have a great potential as a net fossil fuel 

displacement because they contribute positively to a better environment, because of the 

diminished greenhouse emissions.
8
  

An integrated lignocellulosic biomass to-ethanol process is a new concept based 

on the existing pulp mills. It is possible to obtain fuel at the same time as chemicals. In 

this process, the short fiber of cellulose is converted into ethanol and the long fiber into 

materials for paper production or materials such as bio-composites. All the feedstocks 

components are used to produce value-added multiple co-products, including energy, as 

the concept of biorefinary.
8-9

 

In spite of all the advantages, these last processes are still not available in the 

industry due to existing technical, economic and commercial barriers.  

Although, ethanol is an exceedingly good fuel alternative, the separation of 

an aqueous mixture of ethanol /water is often mentioned as a problem for the 

adoption of ethanol fuel. It presents an azeotrope at xethanol?0.894 which difficult the 

obtainment of high purity alcohol, as shown in figure 4.    

  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So in order to solve this dilemma, the need to discover a viable alternatives to 

distillation is the mainly issue.  

 

4 Distillation 

 

Distillation is a separation process based in vapor-liquid equilibrium of 

mixtures.
8
 It separates two or more liquid components based on the principle of relative 

volatility or boiling points. The greater the difference between their volatilities, the 

easier is the separation using distillation
10

. This process involves production of vapor by 

boiling the liquid mixture and removal of the vapor by condensation as shown in Figure 

5. The vapor is rich in light components and the liquid is rich in heavy components.  

.  

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4 - Phase diagram of Ethanol-Water System 



 

 

 

Often a part of the condensate is flowed back to the still and is mixed with the 

outgoing vapor. To enhance mass transfer, there are devices called plates, trays or 

packing which role is to bring the vapor and the liquid phases into contact. The greater 

the difference of the relative volatility, the bigger number of plates is needed. 
11

  

Distillation is the mainly process utilized for alcohols recovery, due to its high 

percentage of alcohol product in the final stream, about 99% ends up in the alcohol 

product stream.  

 

In spite of all its advantages, distillation cannot perform a complete separation in 

azeotropic mixtures. For the ethanol-water separation it requires additional steps like 

molecular sieve adsorption or changes of the process parameters in order to reach 

product dryness.
12

 To obtain a 99.5% pure ethanol, it is necessary to overtake the 

azeotrope of ethanol-water system. In general, for the solutions containing around 10 to 

85% of ethanol, distillation is a very effective process obtaining approximately 92.4% 

ethanol in the product stream. While for mixtures with 85 to near 95.6% alcohol 

Figure 5 - Distillation Column  



containing, this process becomes more expensive and requiring high reflux ratios, just 

as additional equipments.
8, 12

 Although, the azeotrope can be eliminated by lowering the 

operation pressure to a vacuum condition, the alcohol is usually dehydrated to achieve 

anhydrous ethanol by employing azeotropic distillation, extractive distillation, liquid-

liquid extraction, adsorption, and some more complex separation methods. 
13

 

 

4.1- Azeotropic Distillation 

 

 Azeotropic distillation involves adding a third volatile component, in order to 

form a ternary azeotrope mixture. It affects the relative volatility of the two components 

to be separated and alters the separation factor in the distillation. The third component is 

usually called entrainer and the most commonly used for the ethanol-water separation 

are benzene, toluene and cyclohexane. 
11

 

In this process, ethanol exits from the bottom, while water vapor and small 

amounts of ethanol exit at the top. Then, it enters on a decanter and splits into two 

phases, the organic phase composed by ethanol-entrainer and the aqueous phase 

constituted by water-entrainer. The first is refluxed back into the first column and the 

latter is processed in the entrainer recovery column. 
8
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6 - Azeotropic distillation process diagram 



Consequently, the system has the disadvantage of high energy requirement and 

large capital cost. Not mentioning the health and safety concerns about the entrainer. 

For ethanol production, this method is the less used.   

 

4.2-Extractive Distillation 

 

Extractive distillation requires for an extractive agent, the extractant. It can be a 

liquid solvent, or a dissolved salt, a mixture of liquid solvent and dissolved salt, 

hyperbranched polymers and ionic liquids. Just like azeotropic distillation, extractive 

distillation adds a third component in order to increase the relative volatility of the 

components to be separated, it uses a selective high boiling solvent to alter the 

separation factor (Figure 7).  

Ethanol’s extractive distillation is commonly carried using as a liquid solvent, 

ethylene glycol and under specific operating conditions it can be competitive with 

azeotropic distillation
14

. 

The purpose of the utilization of a dissolved salt is to enhance the relative 

volatility, but also because the salt dissolves into the liquid, which is denominated as 

“salt-effect”. The most studied salts are potassium acetate, sodium acetate and calcium 

chloride. In literature, it is possible to find some studies about the comparison of 

extractive distillation with dissolved salts and conventional liquid extractants, it 

concludes that the former is more efficient for ethanol-water separation. When it is used 

both liquid solvent and dissolved salt, the extraction is also more efficient if used only a 

liquid solvent. 
8, 13

 

Hyperbranched polymers and ionic liquids are novel separating agents used in 

extractive distillation. Hyperbranched polymers are highly branched macromolecules 

with a large number of functional groups. They can be manufactured by one step 

reactions, an economical advantage, and possess a remarkable selectivity and capacity, 

low viscosity and thermal stability. 
8, 13

 

Polymers like poli(glycerol) are used as entrainers in the ethanol-water system 

enhancing the separation process efficiency and selectivity, by braking the azeotropic 



point. Despite some advantages, the obtained results are similar to conventional 

entrainers.
8, 13

 

On the other hand, extractive distillation with ionic liquids has the advantage of 

high separation ability, easy operation and no contamination of the distillate due to their 

non-volatility
10

. It only requires one distillation column, which represents lower energy 

consumption. However, ionic liquids containing halogen anions are expensive and less 

stable. 
15

 

 
Figure 7 - Extractive distillation process diagram 



5 Ionic Liquids 

 

5.1 Properties 

 

Ionic liquids (IL) are salts with a melting point below 100 ºC, composed entirely 

of ionic species. The cation is a poorly coordinating, bulky organic component and the 

anion can be organic or inorganic, which difficults the formation of crystal lattice.
16

 
15

   

They have been classified as process chemicals and as performance chemicals, 

but also as environmental friendly and as green solvents with a wide range of potential 

applications. Ionic liquids have been broadly studied (Figure 6). 
17

  

 

 

 

Figure 8 - Evolution of Ionic Liquids [12] 

 

Ionic liquids tend to have very appealing solvent properties and may be miscible 

with both water and organic solvents
18

. At room temperature, they are generally in the 

liquid state and their vapor pressure is negligible, which allows for recovery and reuse, 

not mentioning economic benefits, such as extremely low solvent loss

process operating conditions, they do not evaporate, raising some interest in the use of 

ionic liquids as industrial solvents to replace volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 

thus eliminate a source of air pollution.
16, 20

  

A large variety of ionic liquids can be created, essentially by changing the anion, 

cation and/or anion substituent’s (Figure 7). This ability makes possible to “tune” the 

ionic liquid in order to be applied as necessary, for example to separate selected 

alcohols from water. The types of IL’s available have been extended to include new 

generations with more specific and targeted properties
21

.  

 

 

Figure 9 - Representative cations and anions of Ionic Liquids 

 

They also are non-flammable and chemically stable. Ionic liquids can be 

applicable as solvents in organic synthesis, homogeneous and biphasic transfer catalysts 

and in electrochemistry.
16, 20

 

The presence of water in the ionic liquid phase can severely influence physical 

properties such as densities, viscosities and surface tensions
9
. The viscosity has strong 

temperature dependence allowing for fast phase separation at elevated temperatures, for 

example.

5.2 Applications 

 

 Ionic liquids can be applicable in different areas such as in Extraction, 

Distillation, Adsorption, Gas storage, Engineering fluids and Membrane technology
23

. 

Energy Storage also attempts to use them to produce electrochemical double layer 

capacitors (ECDL), batteries, fuel cells and mobile energy. 
24

 
25

 Surfactant technology is 

using IL’s to produce surfactants, lubricants, antistatic, anti corrosion and dispersions. 
25

 

Probably ionic liquids most important application is as solvents in organic and 

inorganic synthesis, homogeneous and biphasic transfer catalysis. 
24

 
25

 

 

  



6 Modeling  

 

 The knowledge of the phase behavior of mixtures is important for different 

applications, especially for the simulation and optimization of separation processes, 

where the phase equilibrium of the system must be known. The most used 

thermodynamic models to describe such behavior are free energy models such as 

NRTL, UNIQUAC and UNIFAC. These models have the advantage of being able to 

describe polar, nonpolar and associative systems. However, NRTL and UNIQUAC 

don’t have the ability to predict new systems and are restricted to low pressures.
26

 
27

 
28

 

Since no UNIFAC parameters are available for ionic liquids in this work COSMO RS is 

used as predictive model to describe the experimental data here reported.  

 

6.1 COSMO RS  

 

 The COSMO RS is a method proposed by Klamt and his cowokers used to 

predict a wide range of properties in complex liquid mixtures such as partial vapor 

pressures, activities, solubilities of gases, liquids and solids, partition in arbitrary 

phases, and phase behavior such as Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and Liquid-Liquid 

Equilibrium (LLE).
29

  

One of its most important advantages is the fact that, in the prediction of 

thermodynamic data, it is completely independent of any experimental data of the 

regarded compounds and any group interaction parameters. Unlike group contribution 

methods, such as UNIFAC or UNIQUAC, or other activity coefficient models, as 

Margules, Wilson or NRTL, COSMO RS does not consider the division of molecules 

into fragments losing any information about intramolecular interactions. It is based on 

unimolecular quantum calculations of the individual molecules and uses a very small 

number of adjustable parameters.
29

 
30

 

The calculation process of COSMO RS considers basically two major stages.  

The quantum chemical COSMO calculations for the molecular species involved, where 

the information about both solvents and solutes is extracted and COSMO RS statistical 

thermodynamic calculations performed in the COSMOtherm software.
31

 



COSMO theory describes the interactions in a fluid as local contact interactions 

of molecular surfaces.  In order to quantify the released energy, it analyses the values of 

two screening charge densities (? and ?’), which form a molecular contact. Electrostatic 

misfit energy and hydrogen bonds are the most important contributions to the 

interaction energy, described as functions of the polarization charges of the two 

interacting segments, if the segments belongs to hydrogen bond donor or acceptor 

atom.
29

 
30

 

Cosmo output provides the total energy of a molecule in its conductor 

environment and the 3D polarization density distribution on the surface of each 

molecule Xi. Then this output data is converted into a distribution function, the ?-

profile, p
Xi

(?), which describes the polarity of each surface segment on the overall 

surface of the molecule and quantifies the interactions of pairwise interacting surface 

segments. The ?-profile of a solvent S, pS(?), results of the adding the individual p
Xi

(?) 

weighing by their mole fraction, xi. Since it is convenient to consider a normalized 

ensemble and the integral of the ?-profile, p
Xi

(?) is the total surface area A
Xi

 of a 

compound Xi, the normalized ?-profile of a solvent, p’S(?), is defined in Equation 1 
30

The most important descriptor used in COSMO-RS is in fact ?, which would be 

induced on the molecular surface if the molecule would be in a virtual conductor 

environment. It can be calculated by quantum chemical calculations using the COSMO, 

and it is an extremely valuable for the local polarity of molecular surface. This 

descriptor is the only descriptor determining the interaction energies.
32

  

 

Cosmo RS has the potential to study ionic liquids thermodynamic behavior.  

 

 

  



7 Motivation  

 

 This work aims to provide a comparative analysis of how the two 

thermodynamic models presented above can describe the phase equilibria of the binary 

systems: ionic liquids + ethanol.  

 Ethanol’s purification is a very expensive process and some alternatives have 

been studied. Ionic liquid binary systems are an exceedingly good alternative, not 

because ionic liquids are environmental friendly, but because they are less costly.  

In the first section, it is reported a study of two ionic liquid + ethanol systems. 

the experimental data is also compared with literature data from ionic liquid + water 

systems, so as to verify the adequacy of the experimental method adopted.  

 A comparison between the data obtained experimentally on the ebulliometer and 

the prediction of COSMO RS model is made.  

In a second part several systems were studied to evaluate COSMOS RS 

predictive ability. The importance of different cations and anions, the chain length were 

analyzed and the ideality deviations of ionic liquid + ethanol and ionic liquid + water 

were calculated. Finally, the selectivity of those systems is calculated and analyzed.

respectively. 

 

2 Equipments 

 

2.1 Refractometer 

 

The refractometer is an optical instrument used to measure the refractive index 

of a translucent substance.  

The speed of light in a vacuum is always constant, but when light moves through 

any other medium it travels more slowly since it is constantly being absorbed and 

reemitted by the atoms in the material. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the 

speed of the light in another substance is defined as the refraction index for the 

substance, Equation 2. 

                     
                        

                           
                           (Equation 2) 

 

The correlation between light’s speed in two dissimilar media, vA and vB, the 

angles of incidence (?A) and refraction (?B) and the refractive indexes of the two 

medium (nA and nB) is shown in Equation 3: 

  

  
 

      

      
 

  

  
                                                                            (Equation 3) 



Thus, it is not necessary to measure the speed of light in a sample in order to 

determine its index of refraction. Instead, by measuring the angle of refraction, and 

knowing the refraction index of the layer that is in contact with the sample, it is possible 

to determine it accurately. Almost all refractometers utilize this principle, but may differ 

in their optical design.  

In the Abbe refractometer the liquid sample is inserted between an illuminated 

prism and a refracting one. The refracting prim is made of glass with a high refractive 

index and the refractometer is designed to be used with samples having a refractive 

index smaller than that.  

Since the density of a liquid usually decreases with temperature, the speed of 

light in a liquid will normally increase as the temperatures increases. Consequently, the 

refraction index will be superior as the temperature raises for a liquid. To achieve a 

good performance, many refractometers are equipped with a thermometer and a 

reservoir of circulating water to maintain a given temperature. Most of the refractive 

index measurements reported in the literature are determined at 20 or 25 ºC.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

Figure 10 - Abbe Refractometer 



2.2 Ebulliometer 

 

 The ebulliometer is designed to correctly measure the boiling point of liquids by 

measuring the temperature of the vapor-liquid equilibrium either isobarically or 

isothermally.  

The equipment used to execute the experimental procedure operates at constant 

pressure and in order to achieve a better performance was subjected to several changes 

and it can be seen in Figure 10. 

Primarily, the ebulliometer consists in a boiling chamber, a sampling point that 

allowed operating in isolation, without external disturbances, and a condenser with 

water circulation. The system pressure was achieved using a pump connected directly to 

the vacuum line.  

In the final version of the ebulliometer, the pressure is measured by a pressure 

sensor Heated Capacitance Manometer 728A Baratron MKS, placed near the sample 

cell, with an accuracy of 0.50%. The temperature measurement is made using a Pt100 

sounder with an associated error of 0.05K, immersed directly in the sample as shown in 

Figure 10. 

 

  

 

 

 

 

    

 

 

Figure 11 - Ebulliometer 



3 Experimental Procedure 

 

  First of all, prepare an ethanol-ionic liquid solution richer in the most volatile 

component (ethanol).  

 Consequently, add this solution to the boiling chamber of the ebulliometer along 

with a magnetic stirrer.  

 Assemble the ebulliometer and turn on the agitation, the heating plate and the 

thermostatic bath. Set the pressure on the right value.   

 When the system is in equilibrium, the temperature does not fluctuate much with 

time. Remove a sample of the mixture with a syringe.  

 Maintaining the same sample, alter the pressure and repeat the previous step. 

Repeat the last two steps of the procedure to all different pressure values.  

 After measuring all the data, add pure ionic liquid or a more concentrated 

solution in the boiling chamber so as to concentrate the solution on the ebulliometer.  

Reproduce the previous steps for more concentrated solutions.  

 Read the refractive index of the samples in the Abbe refractometer at 30ºC.

Results and 

Discussion 
 



The number of ionic liquids available commercially is today more than 1000. It is 

possible to synthesize more than 10
9
 according to several sources. The optimization of 

the IL to be used for a particular purpose cannot be carried by trial and error. A 

predictive model such as COSMO-RS can be useful as a scanning tool to identify the 

best characteristics of an ionic liquid. For that purpose we started by carrying a study to 

evaluate the ability of COSMO-RS to predict these systems. A database was compiled 

from the literature and is reported in Table 3 where are presented the references of all 

experimental data that we were able to find in for the VLE of different ionic liquids with 

ethanol and their temperature and pressure ranges.

Based on this information, we decided to study the influence of several important 

factors such as the temperature, the anion and the cation of the ionic liquids using 

COSMO RS as a predictive model.

The COSMO RS has shown to be an effective method to predict the VLE of the 

systems measured in this work. To evaluate its ability to describe other similar 

system it was made a comparison between the COSMO RS predictions and 

published data in the literature. The results are shown in Figure 13.

As result of the analysis of Figure 13, it appears that COSMO RS is a good 

model to predict the experimental VLE data. It is also notable that the COSMO RS 

is especially sensitive both to changes in the ionic liquid family as the variation of 

the substituent group.  

Another important fact that can be observed in Figure 13: a) and c) is that as the 

temperature increases the prediction made by COSMO RS are in better agreement 

with the experimental data.  

 

1.2 Anion and Cation influence   

 

So as to explore COSMO RS predictive properties, it was made a study to 

evaluate the influence of both cation and anion in the ionic liquids behavior. 

Primarily, it was studied the influence of the cation chain length and then the 

capacity to effect VLE behavior by different anions in the ionic liquid.

As represented in Figure 14, the chain length of the ionic liquid anion does not 

influence significantly the results obtained by COSMO RS. In the first case, the 

variation of the parameter n in [Cnmim][ESO4] does not change the VLE behavior of the 

ionic liquid. For the [Cnmim][Cl]+EtOH system, the COSMO RS only describes the 

experimental data correctly at high ethanol concentrations. Some other cases that were 

studied are presented on Appendix B. 

The influence of the cation adds great changes to the systems thermodynamic 

behavior. So as to understand which cations are good choices as entrainers in ethanol’s 

separation, we chose 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation to study the effect of several 

anions. 

Figure 15 shows the predictions of COSMO RS for a wide range of anions at 

constant pressure of 0.1 MPa.

 Although ionic liquids with anions such as dicyclohexylphosphinate and 

diisobutylphosphinate present the best results, they are not easily available as acetate, 

chloride, tetrafluoroborate among others.  

 

1.3 Activity Coefficients at Infinite Dilution 

 

The ethanol/ionic liquid relative volatility is defined as the ratio of the 

distribution coefficients of ethanol and the ionic liquid (Equation 4). 

    
          

        
                                 (Equation 4) 

The entrainer must be selected according to its volatility, selectivity, ease of 

separation from the bottom and top products and cost. The most easily assessed is 

selectivity by determining the effect on the relative volatility of the two key components 

adding a solvent.  

So as to study more correctly the influence of those the structure of the ionic 

liquid on the activity coefficient at infinite dilution several systems were evaluated by 

COSMO RS. Two major groups of systems studied were divided accordingly to Table 

4.

 Case: Effect of the anion 

 

It has been shown that the anion influences the VLE behavior of ionic liquid+ 

ethanol systems. To evaluate this effect an analysis was made to study different anions 

on ionic liquid+ ethanol and ionic liquid + water systems. The activity coefficients were 

calculated by COSMO RS and the results are shown in Figure 16. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 This coefficient represents the maximum of nonideality that a mixture can have. 

Figure 16 shows that there are several anions with activity coefficient at infinite dilution 

inferior to one and others that are superior to one.  

Figure 17 exhibits the selectivity for the studied anions. According to the results, 

the acetate (3) anion has the most significant ability in enhancing the relative volatility. 

Dicyclohexylphosphinate (1), diisobutylphosphinate (2) have the ability to enhance the 

relative volatility also, followed by decanoate (4), hydrogencarbonate (5) and 

hydrogensulfate (13).

Choosing chloride as the anion, it was tested in COSMO RS, two oxygenated 

Imidazolium cations, bis-1-hexyl-oxymethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium and 1-hexyl-

oxymethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium and several oxygenated cations as choline chloride, 

ethyl-2-hydroxyethyldimethylammonium chloride, hexyl-2-

hydroxyethyldimethylammoniun chloride, O-ethyl-N,N,N,N-tetramethylisouronium 

chloride and O-methyl-N,N,N,N-tetramethylisouronium chloride. The infinite dilution 

activity coefficients are presented in Figure 18.

 are inferior to one, which means that their interactions with

Using oxygenated cations and chloride as the anion, the selectivity for both 

systems is presented in Figure 19. 

 

 

Figure 19- Selectivity for several cations (The list of the cations is presented in Table 5). 

 

 As already discussed, ionic liquid systems that have a high selectivity are 

the best option to the extractive distillation of ethanol. As the results show, bis-1-hexyl-

oxymethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium (27) is a better option as an entrainer, because it has 

the higher selectivity value followed by Hexyl-3-hydroxyethyldimethylammonium (24).

2 Experimental Results for [C4mim][Cl]+EtOH and [Choline][Cl]+EtOH 

Systems 

 

Accordingly with the results obtained in the previous section, we decided to study 

the [C4mim][Cl]+EtOH system to validate the ebulliometer and the 

[Choline][Cl]+EtOH as a new system. The structure of the ionic liquids studied is 

presented in Figure 20 below.  

 

 
Figure 20 - Ionic Liquids structural formula: a) 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium Chloride; b) Choline Chloride 

 

 These systems were chosen because both have a chloride anion, the [C4mim][Cl] 

has a short alkyl chain as cation, and the choline chloride a small oxygenated cation. 

The experimental data was obtained at three different pressure values (1000 mbar, 700 

mbar and 500 mbar) to study the influence of this parameter on the boiling temperature 

of ionic liquid mixtures. 

From Equation 5 it is possible to calculate the activity coefficient of ethanol in mixtures 

of ionic liquids + ethanol to study the interactions between both species and compare it 

with results of COSMO model.

 As the alcohol percentage increases the less concentrated in ionic liquid is the 

mixture on the ebulliometer and a lower temperature value is needed to establish the 

vapour-liquid equilibrium.  

For [Choline][Cl]+EtOH it was also possible to obtain a good prediction of the system 

behavior by COSMO RS (Figure 22).  

Figure 21 - PTx diagram for the system [C4mim][Cl]+EtOH (Experimental data Vs Cosmo Rs prediction) 



 
Figure 22 - PTx diagram for the system [Choline][Cl]+EtOH (Experimental data Vs Cosmo Rs prediction) 

 

It was not possible to obtain from the COSMO RS, the data for P= 500 mbar due 

to an unrecognized error. Once more, as the content of alcohol increases, the more 

diluted the mixture is in ionic liquid and the lower the temperature value is needed to 

establish the vapour-liquid equilibrium.  

In comparison between the two different systems, choline chloride is less soluble 

in ethanol than 1-butyl-3-methylimidizolium chloride and the boiling temperatures are 

higher on [C4mim][Cl]+ EtOH system. 

It can be explained by the structural formula of the ionic liquids (Figure 20). The 

1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation consists of a five numbered ring with two nitrogen 

and three carbon atoms, with ethyl and methyl groups substituted at the two nitrogen 

atoms. On the other side, choline chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt with a N,N,N-

trimethylethanolammonium cation with a linear structure.

Conclusions 
 



 The main objective of this thesis is to evaluate ionic liquids as potential solvents 

for the extractive distillation of ethanol.  

Two ionic liquid + ethanol systems were studied: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium 

chloride and choline chloride. Their VLE was measured in an ebulliometer and this 

data, along with data from the literature was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the 

COSMO RS model. COSMO RS describe adequately the experimental data.  

By applying the COSMO-RS model to other literature data it was found that it is 

a good predictive model capable of describing the VLE data available in the literature 

and thus to be used as a tool in the selection of ionic liquids as entrainers for extractive 

distillation. 

Due to the very large number of potential ionic liquids their experimental 

selection is difficult and time consuming. For investigating the influence of ionic liquids 

on the separation of ethanol-water, the selectivities based on the infinite dilution activity 

coefficients were estimated.  

It was found that ionic liquids with cations with shorter alkyl chains have a 

higher affinity for ethanol than cations with longer alkyl chain. The presence of oxygen 

in cations, especially in small cations, contributes to increase the affinity between 

ethanol and the IL. Regarding the anions, oxygen anions such as the acetate have better 

affinity with the ethanol.  

Concerning the selectivity, anions such as dicyclohexylphosphinate (1), 

diisobutylphosphinate (2), acetate (3), decanoate (4), etoxyethylsulfate (14) and chloride 

(21) are good choices for the extractive distillation with ionic liquids. However, the 

acetate (3) anion has the most significant ability in enhancing the relative volatility. 

Dicyclohexylphosphinate (1), diisobutylphosphinate (2) have the ability to enhance the 

relative volatility either, followed by decanoate (4), hydrogencarbonate (5) and 

hydrogensulfate (13). Bis-1-hexyl-oxymethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium cation (27) is a 

better option as an entrainer, because it has the higher selectivity value followed by 

Hexyl-3-hydroxyethyldimethylammonium (24).
