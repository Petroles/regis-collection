1. Introduction 

Solving the linkage between the lithic constituents of tombs and 
the rock outcrops is a problem that has not been extensively 
addressed in the literature (Andrefsky, 1994; Clarkson and 
Bellas, 2014). The project “MEGAGEO: Moving megaliths in 

the Neolithic" gathered a multidisciplinary team, including 
geologists and archaeologists in a new approach to address this 
issue. 

Based on a database of tombs from Portugal, a set of three 
study areas was chosen to conduct detailed analyses aiming to 
identify and characterize outcrops and quarries that might have 
been the source of the lithic components used in the construction 
of the tombs. Figure 1 displays the studied areas named 
Monforte, Redondo and Lisboa after the main localities in their 

vicinities.  
Geological studies included detailed mapping, petrographic 

and geochemical analysis of samples from outcrops, quarries and 
tombs to fully characterize each area.  A geographic information 
system was designed and implemented to visualize the collected 
data and to produce field maps. In the phase of data analysis the 
spatial information gathered was consolidated and transformed 
into a spatial data warehouse. This approach is being proposed by 

many researchers and institutions as can be seen in Bedard and 
Han (2009), Stefanovic (1997) or McHugh (2008). In this paper 
we present the results of this approach, using the geochemical 
results obtained in the Redondo area as a case study. 

2. The data sources 

The geographic information system created uses several data 
sources where spatial information (e.g. tomb location or sample 
location) coexist with non-spatial information (e.g. SiO2 content 
of a sample or geological description of an outcrop).

For this project a total of twenty two databases were adapted 
or newly created. These databases include geographic 
information (e.g. roads, rivers, terrain slope, localities), 

geological information, such as geological mapping at scales 1:50 
000, 1:500 000 and 1:1 000 000, including rock formations and 
structures, archaeological information (e.g. location and types of 
tombs, tomb description, site sketch), and petrographic and 
geochemical data from samples collected in tombs and outcrops. 
Figure 2 shows the general organization of the GIS database 
system created.  

This data organization proved to be valuable in the phase of 

field campaigns and data collection as it was possible to rapidly 
produce maps to support field work and some synthesis maps 
needed when presenting the results in conferences (e.g. 
Boaventura et al., 2015). Our experience demonstrated that this 
approach is suitable for a system that is operated by GIS-
specialists but whenever it is necessary to carry out data analysis 
from the point of view of non GIS-specialists, the complexity of 
the data structure becomes difficult to use. The maintenance of 

such a system is also a time consuming task because data 
consistency must be kept at all time whenever there are many 
researchers adding data to the system. In terms of databases 
terminology the GIS-database system is considered a SOLTP 
system that is a Spatial Online Transactional Process because the 
data is handled as a transactional system.  

The spatial data warehouse was created to help the 
researchers of the project with a set of tools that might be usable 

in data analysis without the need to spend considerable amounts 
of time understanding all the operations and terminology specific 
to GIS systems. This approach implies the passage from a 
SOLTP to a more analytical system, that is, a Spatial Online 
Analytical Process, a SOLAP (Kimball and Ross, 2002; Bedard 
and Han, 2009).

3. The Spatial Data Warehouse 

Two datamarts were designed to respond to the geologists and 
the archaeologists questions. The geology datamart has got a fact 
table that is centered on the samples collected and the dimensions 

present include the outcrops, the tombs, the geology and the 
geography. For the archaeology datamart the fact table is 
centered in the tomb and as dimensions there is the geology, the 
petrography, the geochemistry and the geography. 

McHugh (2008) classified the dimensions of GIS databases 
as geometric, non-geometric and mixed according to the type of 
data contained. The transformation of these dimensions from the 
GIS database to a spatial data warehouse implies a process of 
Extraction, Transformation and Loading - ETL of information 

(Harvey and Jiawei, 2009). This ETL process includes several 
types of operations such as aggregation, filtering, aliasing or 
geocoding. An example of this is the transformation of chemical 
weight percentage of elements to a normalized description, 
allowing the archaeologists to understand the meaning of 
geochemical data and common names used in its description, 
aliasing. 

The ETL stage is error prone, complex and time consuming 

as the studied areas include all types of rocks and the 
interpretation needed for the geochemical and petrographic 
values and descriptions of sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous 
rocks is very different. An example is the creation of a set of 
fields for rock classification according to the geochemical 
contents of analyzed samples. For example classifying the acidity 
of a rock is based on the values of SiO2 leading to common 
names of mafic, intermediate or felsic. This transformation is 

made using an expression of the type: 
 

IF((“SIO2”)&amp;lt;= 52, 'MAFIC', IF((“SIO2”)&amp;lt;63, 
'INTERMEDIATE',  'ACID'))* 

* QGIS type expression. Field names are between double quotes. 

This transformation can only be applied in meaningful terms 
to igneous rocks, therefore a filtering of these types of rocks is 
necessary previously to the step of rock classification. Fig. 3 is an 
example of a map where the samples are classified according to 
their silica content. 

4. The outputs 

The Redondo area is presented as a case study of this approach. 
A set of thirty two dolmens can be found and eight of these were 
selected for detailed studies in the project. The outcrops of the 
area were mapped to find the ones that might have produced rock 

slabs used in the construction of the dolmens: the source rocks.   
Figure 3 displays a map constructed in QGIS under the 

spatial data warehouse created for the project. In this map a 
buffer with a 250 m radius was displayed confirming that the 
found outcrops are in an easily reachable distance for rock slab 
transportation and seven out of eight of the studied dolmens are 
within this range. Furthermore, this map displays the silica 
content from the rock slabs and from the outcropping rock type. 

This analysis demonstrates that there is a good match between 
outcrop rock type and rock slab silica content. Nevertheless, 
further analysis needs to be done in the dolmen from the 
northeast part of the map where the rock slab is of basic 
composition whereas outcropping rocks are more felsic. 

The spatial data warehouse also pretends to be useful for data 
analysis, therefore, for the data visualization it is necessary to 
include background map information. This background 

information, that is predefined, must be prepared including the

set of legends and labels for specific uses. An example of this is 
the set of geological maps with the standardized symbols and 
names of the geological units in Portuguese and English. Also for 

publishing purposes the different symbols were created in gray 
shades and in full color.  

Another example of a possible analysis done with the spatial 
data warehouse is the visualization of data based on a set of rules. 

When the geologists team wants to verify if it is necessary to 
consider further sampling and analyses of REE and isotopes it is 
possible to prepare a map were the analyzed samples are plotted 

and the values displayed in a suitable geological background. 
Figure 4 illustrates an example of the output map produced for 
the Redondo study area. In this map a filtering is done to display 
only the samples analyzed for

6. Conclusions 

In a multidisciplinary project such as the one presented, new 
tools have to be developed in order to find common means for 
analyzing and interpreting data.  

The spatial data warehouse specially created for the project is 
being used has a better tool in the analysis of the complex and 
multidimensional data that is used to find the relation between 
tomb sites and lithic material sources. The interpretation of the 
geochemistry and petrology of the samples can be combined with 
the archaeological information by all the researchers of the 
project without the need of high skills and knowledge of GIS.
