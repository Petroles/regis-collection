ABSTRACT

ROSA, A. (2016). Bioretention for diffuse pollution control in SUDS using
experimental-adaptive approaches of ecohydrology. Doctoral Thesis, São Carlos School
of Engineering, University of São Paulo, São Carlos.

Problems of land use and occupation in urban areas may prevent the infiltration of water,
thus increasing runoff. Bioretention techniques are solutions, which are emerging from the
hydrology field to mitigate the consequences of increasing urbanization, including,
flooding and contamination of rivers. The general objective of this research is to study the
general efficiency of combined Compensatory Techniques (CT) with detention and
bioretention control of diffuse pollutants from an urban drainage system. Specific
objectives are defined in each chapter and relates to sizing and to the bioretention systems
of modeling and monitoring, located in southeastern Brazil, São Paulo – São Carlos. The
first chapter presents the general introduction of the thesis, the objectives and research
hypotheses, as well as, the description of the general methodology for the thesis
construction and the goals related to each chapter. The second chapter discusses the scope
and some limitations of the classifications of terms frequently used in the theme of
sustainable urban drainage. This chapter, in a way, approaches the other chapters, which
composes this thesis, by providing them comprehensive database of references. The third
chapter presents the design criteria used for the construction of experimental bioretention
system and compares the design with the model HEC – HMS - Hydrologic Engineering
Center - Hydrologic Modeling System. The fourth chapter talks about some criteria to
identify areas for building bioretention systems and presents the GIS - Geographic
Information System and ecohydrology indicators, in this characterization, considering the
quantity and quality aspects in the urban drainage. The fifth chapter shows the use of
PCSWMM model (Personal Computer Stormwater Management Model) to simulate future
scenarios, assuming progressive modular expansion of CTs, modeling efficiency in
qualitative and quantitative aspects diffuse pollution for scenarios 2015, 2025, 2050, 2100.
The conclusion of this research is that compensatory techniques can be used not only to
assess the impacts of diffuse pollution stemmed from urban drainage system, but as a
contribution to the sustainability of watersheds and to mitigation of extremes risks derived
by increased urban drainage demand.

RESUMO

ROSA, A. (2016). Bioretenção para o controle da poluição difusa em drenagem
urbana sustentável (SUDS) utilizando abordagens experimentais-adaptativas de
ecohidrologia. Tese de Doutorado, Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, Universidade de
São Paulo, São Carlos.

Problemas decorrentes do uso e ocupação do solo em áreas urbanas podem dificultar a
infiltração da água, aumentando o escoamento superficial. Técnicas de bioretenção são
soluções decorrentes do campo da hidrologia para mitigar as consequências resultantes da
crescente urbanização, entre elas, enchentes e contaminação de rios. O objetivo geral da
pesquisa é estudar a eficiência generalizada de Técnicas Compensatórias (TC`s)
experimentais, adaptáveis combinadas de detenção e bioretenção para controle da poluição
difusa da drenagem urbana. Objetivos específicos são definidos em cada capítulo e
relacionam-se com o dimensionamento e monitoramento de modelagem de sistema de
bioretenção, localizado no Sudeste do Brasil, São Paulo – São Carlos. O Primeiro
capítulo apresenta a introdução geral da tese, objetivos e hipóteses, bem como, descreve a
metodologia geral para construção da tese e relação dos objetivos com os respectivos
capítulos. O Segundo capítulo discute os alcances e limitações de nomenclaturas sobre
termos frequentemente utilizados na temática drenagem urbana sustentável. Este capítulo
de certa forma aporta os demais capítulos que compõe esta tese, por propiciar vasto banco
de dados referenciais. O Terceiro capítulo apresenta os critérios de dimensionamento
utilizados para a construção de um sistema de bioretenção experimental e uma comparação
com o dimensionamento com o modelo HEC – HMS - Hydrologic Engineering Center -
Hydrologic Modeling System. O Quarto capítulo discorre sobre critérios de escolha de
áreas propicias para a construção de sistemas de bioretenção usando Sistemas de
Informações Geográficas para a caracterização de áreas, utilizando indicadores
ecohidrológicos, considerando os aspectos de quantidade e de qualidade na drenagem
urbana. O Quinto capítulo demonstra o uso do modelo PCSWMM – Personal Computer
Stormwater Management Model, na simulação de cenários futuros assumindo expansões
modulares progressivas da TC, modelando a eficiência para os aspectos qualitativos e
quantitativos da poluição difusa para os 2015, 2025, 2050, 2100.  Conclui-se com esta
pesquisa que técnicas compensatórias podem ser empregadas não só para avaliação dos
impactos da poluição difusa provindos da drenagem urbana, mas como forma de contribuir
com a sustentabilidade de bacias hidrográficas e para mitigação de riscos de extremos
advindos do aumento da demanda de drenagem urbana.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION

Historically, urban drainage in Brazil has focused on surface runoff water

treatment, resulting in the concept of conduit based drainage systems, as highlighted by

Pompêo (2000). In the 1990s, the Brazilian research centers that worked with urban

drainage sought to adapt the so-called “Compensatory Techniques” (CTs) to compensate

the effects of urbanization for the runoff, whose review and typology are discussed by

Baptista et al. (2005). These CTs were adaptations of techniques developed by research

groups from Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Currently, these concepts have brought out

considerations and changes in the paradigms of the new Urban Master Plans (PENNINO et

al., 2016). These experimental and adaptive approaches have been named as Sustainable

Urban Drainage Systems-SUDS, Water Sensitive Urban Design -WSUD, Best

Management Practices-BMP and/or Low Impact Development-LID (SAMPLE et al., 2014;

HUNT et al., 2006).

According to A. Morales-Torres et al. (2016), urban stormwater management is a

complex subject, directly linked with other parts of the urban water cycle: the management

of one element (either good or bad) can influence the successful management of another

one. Considering this, this thesis is divided in several chapters to explore this complexity.

Thus, it is presented in the first chapter of this thesis the general introduction of this work,

its objectives and research hypotheses, as well as, the description of the general

methodology for the thesis construction and a list of goals with its respective chapters.

It is observed that these new concepts essentially address the same principles and

the same types of solutions, whether by structural and/or non-structural means. According

to Fletcher et al. (2012), these new approaches prioritize induced infiltration, retention,

runoff bio-filtration, control at the runoff source, landscape integration with the urban

space, non-transfering of the downstream impacts and a multidisciplinary approach to

environmental education and social participation. In this sense, the second chapter

demonstrates, through bibliometric technique, a survey of publications and research

projects, from a collection of 22 terms frequently used in the subject sustainable drainage.

In short, all concepts are related to maintaining the urban conditions as close as

possible to the natural conditions of the hydrological cycle (qualitative and quantitative),

seeking to integrate quantity efficiencies (stored volumes, attenuated peak flows, delay of

flow time) and water quality (considering diffuse pollution with the physical-chemical,

microbiological and ecotoxicological aspects).



2

However, in spite of two decades of developing CTs in Brazil, there has been little

practical usage of the solutions developed, especially at the scale where they have been

studied. The main reasons are driven by the scale of drainage problems: I) there is a

preference for detention reservoirs in macro drainage systems (CANHOLI, 2005), due to a

lack of technical upgrading of the drainage management agencies to deal with the

implementation, operation and maintenance of diffuse, decentralized and small structures,;

II) society has difficulty in understanding the relationship between small-scale solutions

and large-scale problems: experimental research has focused on control at the source on a

local scale, while the urban drainage problems are seen on a large scale, as well as the

difficulty of inserting qualitative and quantitative parameters in the design of bioretention

systems.

Thus, the third chapter details the methodology used to measure and simulate the

bioretention system, object of this research, entitled BIoREteNtIon CEll method -

BIRENICE. And it also compares it with the HEC-HMS model, which is widely used in

researches.

One of the main difficulties in choosing propitious areas to build bioretention

systems ends up being the characterization and detail of the terrain. Some factors such as

slope, land use and soil type must be taken into consideration. Regarding this difficulty, the

fourth chapter demonstrates, with the use of GIS tools along with some indicators from

ecohydrological studies, a more detailed and precise analysis of suitable areas for building

bioretention techniques. Emphasizing that the system of monitoring has shown that the

benefits of CT implementation constitute a landmark for urban drainage.

The fifth and final chapter evaluate the performance of bioretention technique

through computer simulations as a result of mathematical modelling through the SWMM5

PCSWMM in version 6.2. The model inputs correspond to hydraulic, hydro-

meteorological and geotechnical components, being calibrated by the method of multi-

objective optimization, allowing users to set tolerances for the parameter of uncertainty in

SWMM layers, running the model to the extremes of this range of uncertainty. The model

responds in the form of the flow and level of water infiltration, making it possible to

evaluate the removal of pollutants and the water volume for different characteristics of

precipitation events.

This doctorate research project is connected to and has the financial support of

three ongoing projects: (1) MAPLU2 – Stormwater Management in the Urban

Environment/FINEP Agreement 0982/10(01.10.0701.00), composed of a network of 16

Brazilian IES, (2) Thematic Project FAPESP 2008/58161-1 “Assessment of Impacts and

Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil and Strategies for Adaptation Options”, through

its Component 6 (EESC/USP) “Mitigation and adaptation measures of vulnerable

communities to cope with water-related risks derived from climate change scenarios at

river basins of São Carlos”; and (3) Casadinho/PROCAD CNPq 552494/2011-9 (UFAL-

EESC/USP) “Advanced monitoring of biotechnological processes and environmental

quality”.

This research has an integrative aspect of the three (presented) projects, through

which it was possible to reach the objectives proposed here. With MAPLU2 project, a

broad network of researches and partnerships was accessed, fortifying the following study

through experiments, replicating methodologies and Compensatory Techniques

experiments in different regions of Brazil.

With the thematic project, FAPESP research was inserted in the subject of climate

changes and its consequences to the urban environment, reflecting the contributions of this

study for this research field, strengthening the proposal to model future scenarios due to

the impacts caused by urbanization.

While participating in the Casadinho/PROCAD project, it was possible to deepen

the knowledge obtained related to water monitoring quality. As follows, one of the main

objectives of this project, which intended to study the application of molecular techniques

to detect pathogenical organisms in the environment, especially in urban scenarios, is to

contribute to the water resources management through compensatory monitoring

techniques, mainly of urban areas.

It is important to notice that the participation in these projects provided great

visibility to the research by participating in major international scientific events. One of the

events was the Scientific Expedition Brazil – Germany, 490148/2011 – 5o Planning tools

and measures for sustainable management of water resources in Brazil. This expedition

involved researchers from the University of Kassel and University of São Paulo (São

Carlos School of Engineering - EESC). Another important event was the International

conference on Water, Megacities and global change - 2015 December 1st - 4th 2015 at

UNESCO HQ - Paris - France. After this participation, the project gained visibility in

Brazil, published in printed and televised media.

1.1 Research Hypotheses

Considering the state of the art on CTs for the control of diffuse pollution of urban

drainage, these research hypotheses state that:

? The compensatory techniques, when studied in the form of combined detention with

bioretention, represent more efficient adaptation strategies to control urban drainage

changes in the long run,

? Under these scenarios, the master plans seek to optimize resources and incorporate

drainage resilience, therefore the techniques will actually be compensatory if

progressive systematic rehabilitation or “modular” steps are included to increase

efficiency during its lifetime,

? Ecohydrological indicators are tools that evaluate how this generalized efficiency is

increased, and how quantity and quality of diffuse pollution could better characterize

urban drainage if an experimental and adaptive approach is used.

1.2 General Methodology

The general methodology follows the schematic flow chart shown in Figure 2.1,

divided into six steps: (1) pollutant loads analysis enchases the diffuse pollution of urban

drainage; (2) theoretical-adaptive approach of the compensatory techniques (CT) practices

is used; (3) experimental approach with sizing by detention and bioretention; (4) choosing

of experimental areas for construction of compensatory techniques practices; (5)

installation and quality-quantitative monitoring during the working of compensatory

techniques practices; and (6) performance evaluation of CT. The discussed methodology

may apply to any situation.

1.3 Relationship between Objectives, Methods and Products

Figure 1.2 shows the flowchart of the practical implementation of this research.

The first phase was the construction of a CT system, based on a comprehensive study and

characterization of the area to be implemented, taking into account the legal and

administrative requirements of land use and ecohydrological indicators. The research

recognizes that the use of compensatory techniques can be an effective alternative to

stemmed diffuse pollution control of urban drainage, using experiments built in real scale

in previously selected areas.

From documentary and literature surveys that culminated in the discussion of the

methodological scope and its limitations and through a thorough theoretical overview, the

methodology was developed. Bibliometric techniques were used and supported the

understanding of different denominations related to sustainable urban drainage techniques

as well as research groups, institutions and researchers involved. It resulted in the article:

Sustainable urban drainage: delineation of the scientific domain of knowledge production.

Through the proposed and implemented sizing model, adding to the aggregate

knowledge through conceptual theoretical research, it was proposed the second product,

which deals with the methodology used in the design of CTs system, the object of this

research. It demonstrates innovative aspects as modular design and considered qualitative

and quantitative aspects. This step resulted in the article: Modular sizing is bioretention

systems to urban scenarios considering scale and increasing urbanization time - a case

study in the city of São Carlos.

The choice of areas to construct the CTs systems can be considered one of the

most complicated steps in the implementation process and monitoring of these techniques.

The project was implemented with the support from the Brazilian legal framework and

ecohydrologicals indicators that supported the preliminary studies, giving rise to the fourth

chapter of this thesis called: CT for control urban drainage with ecohydrology base: GIS

as a tool for choices propitious areas.

The last paper, but not least, demonstrates that through the use of PCSWMM for

modelling qualitative and quantitative data obtained by monitoring the compensatory

technique, it is possible to study CT’s performance.

Thus, the project included the methodological steps ranging from the study of the

relevance of compensatory techniques in urban drainage to computer simulations to

evaluate the performance of the project after its construction.

2. SUSTAINABLE URBAN DRAINAGE: DELINEATION OF A SCIENTIFIC
DOMAIN OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION*

Abstract

Sustainable Urban Drainage emerged and gained prominence during the late 90s. Despite this
progress, there is little uniformity in subjects and definition of terms within the overall
sustainability theme. This tends to create a duplication of objectives and confusion about the
correct use of techniques and procedures. This paper seeks to identify, map and evaluate
‘Sustainable Urban Drainage’ as a scientific domain, using relationships between underlying
subthemes. We analyzed 3,805 publications by 8,237 authors with relation to 11,957 citations
using sociometric and bibliometric techniques. The results confirm the existence of the
knowledge domain with one main nucleus and 20 independent networks. Core subthemes
such as stormwater management, low impact development, integrated urban water
management, bioretention, and best management practices are distinguishable the main
domain.

Keywords: scientific domains, low impact development, integrated urban water management,
bioretention, best management practices

2.1 Introduction

Questions related to urban drainage have occupied professionals and researchers in

different contexts. Over the last decades, practical results, adaptations, experiences and

techniques have been the object of scientific literature originating mainly from Europe, the

United States of America (USA), and Australia. Research within the area of natural

hydrological cycles represents a point of convergence within this theme.

A central concept in the urban drainage literature is knowledge generated in

networks involving intellectual, social, and physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Studies focusing upon the theoretical development and practical application of new methods

are principally concerned with reducing negative impacts from urban development, as well as

the expansion of the respect for the natural environment limitations.

From this perspective, studies of urban drainage range from those that are strictly

technical in nature - e.g. induced infiltration, retention and (bio) filtration – to

multidisciplinary socio-technical studies whose aim is to avoid downstream transfer of

impacts, and reinforce environmental education and social participation. In this range of

approaches ranging from the technical scope to the political one, the increasing concern on



9

understanding how to operationalize socio-technical solutions capable of assuring significant

levels of success based on the sustainable development principles become more relevant.

This paper seeks to identify, relate and analyse a group of research areas united by a

sustainable urban drainage theme. This study maps and explains the relationships between

authors and subthemes related to urban drainage in an international context. The work seeks

answers to the following questions: Which are the main subthemes that emerge under the

sustainable urban drainage theme? Which are the major countries and authors that stablish

relationships among the subthemes? Which are the more active subthemes in the scientific

community?

2.1.1 Theoretical perspectives on urban drainage

As communities build improved responses to urban drainage problems, social

research that explains how scientists interact and how they reach consensus on methods is

conducted.  Scientific enterprise depends, to a large extent, on the community’s ability, to

adopt assumptions and dedicate themselves to implementing specific practices, until new

scientific knowledge becomes available. New investigations will consequently lead the

community to a new set of practices. While it is theoretically possible to repeat this process

indefinitely, in reality it tends to degrade over time, eventually leading to the emergence of

new methods, which, as they propagate, repeats the process. Within the sustainable urban

drainage theme, the fundamental questions currently in discussion pertain mainly to general

methods and philosophical principles (KUHN, 2000, pp. 23-25).

In the case of conventional urban drainage systems, efforts to expand knowledge

tends to concentrate on internal components (GELDOF, 1995). For example, reducing runoff

volume through infiltration, removes this source of flow to downstream areas more or less

permanent. This influence is perceived on the amount of technical developments and

theoretical framework about drainage based on conduits for the construction of stormwater

sewers and actions to increase the flow capacity of rivers and canals (POMPÊO, 2000;

PROCOPIUCK &amp;amp; ROSA, 2015). Although, this perspective on development of knowledge

about urban drainage is important in the scope of technological development as well as fast

responses to emergency problems; it showed itself little fruitful in offering more aligned

solutions to the sustainable development.

Since the 60s, municipal master plans have adopted protection of natural resources as

a policy goal, indicating a broader focus of urban drainage. Research are now focused on



10

aspects other than flooding of streams to overcome problems caused by the development of

integrated methods and measures to mitigate urbanization effects (GELDOF, 1995, p. 16;

POMPÊO, 2000).

The development of techniques to reduce flows by temporary storage in the soil,

through infiltration was created out of necessity to prioritize planning actions (POMPÊO,

2000). While originating in the broad strategies of environmental management, urban

drainage can be understood as a network of relationships between intellectual, social,

physical, chemical, and biological processes (GELDOF, 2005).

On a constant development process marked by new demands of sustainable urban

development, the technicist paradigm was replaced by a new perspective focused on

multifunctional adaptive structure for managing natural resources. Integrated management

emerges as a multidisciplinary approach to face uncertainties on how to handle natural

resources (JEFFREY &amp;amp; GEAREY, 2006). This change of perspective has contributed

significantly to the rise of a new concept of urban drainage, sustainable urban drainage

(SUD).

SUD research can be classified into: alternative techniques (Tim D. Fletcher et al.,

2014), best management practices (Davis, Hunt, Traver, &amp;amp; Clar, 2009; Tim D. Fletcher et al.,

2014; Zhou, 2014;), bioretention systems (R. A. Brown &amp;amp; Hunt III, 2010; Davis, 2008; Lucas

&amp;amp; Sample, 2015; Sample et al., 2012; Sample &amp;amp; Liu, 2014), compensatory techniques (Tim

D. Fletcher et al., 2014), design stormwater (Park, Chung, Yoo, &amp;amp; Kim, 2012), diffuse

pollution control (Panagopoulos, Makropoulos, &amp;amp; Mimikou, 2013), green infrastructure (Tim

D. Fletcher et al., 2014), integrated urban water management (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014),

low impact development (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; T. J. Scott et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014),

low impact urban design and development (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014),

management of urban drainage (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014), management of urban water

(R. Brown, 2005; Lee &amp;amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010), source control (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014),

stormwater control measures (Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014), stormwater management (Davis

et al., 2009; Roseen et al., 2009; T. J. Scott et al., 2014; Zakaria, Ab Ghani, Abdullah, Mohd.

Sidek, &amp;amp; Ainan, 2003), stormwater quality improvement devices (Begum, Rasul, &amp;amp; Brown,

2008), stormwater quality studies (T. D. Fletcher, Andrieu, &amp;amp; Hamel, 2013; Newman, Aitken,

&amp;amp; Antizar-Ladislao, 2013; Zakaria et al., 2003), stormwater quantity studies (R. Brown, 2005;

Zakaria et al., 2003), stormwater treatment efficiency (Zhang, Zhou, Li, &amp;amp; Yu, 2010),

sustainable drainage systems (Lee &amp;amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010), sustainable urban drainage systems

(Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014), and water Sensitive Urban Design (Davis et al.,

2009; Tim D. Fletcher et al., 2014; Lee &amp;amp; Yigitcanlar, 2010; Sharma, Gray, Diaper, Liston, &amp;amp;

Howe, 2008).

The increase and spread of different approaches to understand a phenomenon tends

to demonstrate its importance and dynamic. However, in this case, it complicates effectively

understanding the domain and its central themes. In this study, we investigate the direction of

SUD research.

2.1.2 Methodological approach to the comprehension of the theoretical field of urban

drainage

Considering this complexity, we contend that clarity and direction of the research

themes within SUD can be enhanced through domain analysis. According to Argas-Quesada

and de Moya-Anegón (2007), domain analysis is one of the novel fronts of research emerging

from advancements in information visualization of networks and this approach helps reveal

the essence of scientific knowledge, especially in multidisciplinary fields with intense

changes.

Domain analysis is based upon the concept that the best way to comprehend a

knowledge field is through analysis of speech patterns, and identifying the networks that

provide structure to knowledge areas. Knowledge domains contain unique structures and

organization, and standards of cooperation, language, and communication means (Argas-

Quesada &amp;amp; de Moya-Anegón, 2007; Hjørland &amp;amp; Albrechtsen, 1995). Based on sociometric

criteria, domain mapping generates  images that express the networks, relationships, and roles

that scientific communities play in society (Argas-Quesada &amp;amp; de Moya-Anegón, 2007; Hood

&amp;amp; Wilson, 2000).

In addition, bibliometric analysis reduces subjectivity by informing statistics such as

the number of authors, of publications, and of countries of origin in the citations of a  domain

category (Price, 1976, p. 39). Bibliometric studies use statistical and mathematical methods to

identify historical trends in the literature and assess emerging standards, mainly through

analysis of the relationship between authors and the use of domain knowledge and themes. In

these studies, a sociometric technique known as the Social Network Analysis (SNA)

perspective is often used. SNA views the researcher as a socially interconnected actor.

Advancing science and producing knowledge requires interactions, associations and the union

of abilities according to common views. This is especially the case with collaborative works.



12

The central-periphery model provides an important tool for SNA, facilitating the

evaluation of cohesion between nodes in a network. This evaluation algorithm calculates the

proximity values in relation to the center and, from that, the correlation between the empirical

matrix and the theoretical one. The evaluation was conducted with continuous method to

attribute a score to the relationships of each node to the center (Borgatti &amp;amp; Everett, 1999).

2.2 Material and Methods

The bibliometric analysis was conducted in two phases. First, was performed under a

qualitative method through the choice of expressions from a body of text comprised of 50

papers that address different perspectives of SUD studies; the papers served as a basis to the

construction of a research project under the theme. The objective was to make a systematic

survey of the most relevant terms and expressions. That survey resulted in 22 expressions,

which are listed in Table 2.1

Second, phase was conducted using a quantitative method, exploring research papers

and reviews that contained high information credibility and authored by prominent

researchers in the SUD field. The data was compiled in August 2015, from the Web of Science

database, covering all complete papers and reviews registered since the year 1864. The

software VantagePoint (Search Technology, 2006) was used to house and structure the data

and assist in further analysis.

Initially, 18,662 documents were identified, which reduced to 3,805, in the second

phase. A filter was used in the following areas: Environmental Science Ecology, Engineering,

Water Resources, Agriculture, Geography, Architecture, Science technology other topics,

Urban Studies, Biodiversity Conservation, Physical Geography, Chemistry and Public

Administration. This refinement was necessary because many expressions have multiple

meanings, outside the interest of SUD research.

The queries in the ‘Web of Science’ were based on the expressions in the first

column of Table 2.1. The searches included each expression altogether in quotation marks.

Thus, abbreviations and acronyms were omitted.

The data in the last column of Table 2.1 was condensed, for each expression, in a

matrix of co-citation in the software VantagePoint. These databases were converted into

edglist1 files through Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) codes run inside Microsoft Excel,

to be imported by the software Ucinet. The visualization of the networks was made with the

software NetDraw.



13

Finally, the evaluation of the centrality of countries, institutions, themes and authors

occurred using the Core/Periphery model of Ucinet (Borgatti, Everetti, &amp;amp; Freeman, 2002),

with 1,000 interactions processed based on continuous method. Centrality was evaluated

using the Gini index, where 0 stands for complete equality and 1 stands for complete

inequality.

2.3 Results analysis

In the following topics, there is a first a characterization of the body of analysis

comprised by the documents resulting from the search on Web of Science. Subsequently, it is

presented the global result based on the centrality relationships between authors relative to

locations. Then, the centrality and peripheral relationships of universities or research centers,

to which the authors are affiliated were characterized, as well as the themes reviewed in this

research; and finally, the relationship between authors without an institutional mediation.

2.3.1 Characterization of the analysis Basin representation

All documents selected by the search terms from the first phase, i.e., without any

filter are contained in column (b) of Table 2.1 There are the number of documents in the

research fields with affinity with the theme in column (c). Finally, the remaining documents

used in body of analysis of this paper is provided in column (d).

14

There are disparities among the results in Table 2.1 regarding the number of

documents found, refined and used for each searched term. That happens because some terms

are considered as techniques or a set of techniques in a global scope – for example,

Alternative techniques, Best management practices, Source control and Stormwater

management – and others can be applied in different knowledge fields.

2.3.2 Global network of authors and countries

The global network showed in Figure 2.1 express the relational logic of the

community studying SUD. This community is comprised of 8,237 authors from 82 countries.

The authors relate to each other through 11,957 bonds stablished by their location.

Figure 2.3 - Relationships between authors and countries related to countries

In the global network, 32% of authors are from the USA. An intermediary group

formed by 12 countries sums up 49% of authors. Finally, a last group of 80 countries gathers

19% of the authors. This distribution is verified in detail in the Figure 2.2. When author

locations are consolidated from country to continent, it is apparent that 72% comes from

North America and Europe, 25% from Asia and Oceania, and 4% from South America or

Africa Figure 2.3. When internal and external relationships of the authors are considered, the

central countries in the SUD research network are the USA, Australia, Canada, England, and

Germany, as marked by a dashed line in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4 - Centralization of countries in terms of relations between authors

In Figure 2.4, the solid line represents the centrality of authors exclusive of their

external relationships, i.e., international relationships. In this perspective, there is a shift of the

order of the countries in terms of centrality. In order of importance, the sequence becomes the

Peoples Republic of China (PRC), USA, Germany, England, Australia, and Canada. The

centrality index considering internal and external relationships are 0.786, considering only

international relationships, the centrality index is 0.770.

2.3.3 Relationship between research institutes

Regarding the relation between centrality and peripheral of institutions to which the

authors are affiliated, in the universe of 2,027, 12 are from the USA, 3 from Australia, 2 from

China, 1 from Sweden, 1 from Austria and 1 from Denmark. In Figure 2.5, the first 14

institutions were classified as central by the central-periphery model. From North Caroline

State University onwards, the following 2,020 institutions are considered peripheral.

With the application of the core-periphery model considering the internal

relationships of the authors from the institutions, the correlation coefficient was 0.197 and the

Gini index, 0.909. The model ‘reclassified as core members the first 14, with a concentration

correlation coefficient of 0.879. When only external relationships were considered, the

correlation coefficient was 0.236. The Gini index was the same, as well as the number of core

authors. In both evaluations there was no alteration in the centrality indices of the institutions.

The 20 most central institutions are shown in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5 - Institutions centrality

The Australian universities took the 1st position (Melbourne), 5th (Monash) and 20th

(Queensland). In this list, in quantitative terms, prevail the universities and institutes from

USA as 2nd position (Univ. of Maryland), 3rd (Univ. of Virginia), 6th (U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency), 12th (Arizona State Univ.), 15th (North Carolina State Univ.), and 19th

(CH2M Hill Inc.). Although the literature does not place PRC with a history of publications,

Tsinghua Univ. takes the 4th place and China Agriculture Univ., as 8th. Among the European

2.3.4 Relationship between research themes

The 22 themes assessed in terms of the internal and external relationships are shown

in Figure 2.6. The relationships built on similar themes are quantified in the diagonal,

highlighted in black in the matrix. These relationships are important to evaluate a discussion

concentration levels within each theme.

In the upper right frame of the matrix (Figure 2.6) lie the five most densely related

themes. Faced with the set of relationally evaluated themes, the subgroup – formed by (3)

Bioretention, (2) Best management practices (BMPs), (9) Low impact development (8)

Integrated urban water management, and (15) Stormwater management – is considered core

in the discussions about SUD. The themes (2) Best management and (8) Integrated urban

water stand out as internal cohesive elements in the discussion, while (15) Stormwater

management stands out as the most important intermediate topic in the central themes set.

Figure 2.6 - Core and peripheral themes of the net

In the above matrix, the data found above and below the diagonal are symmetric;

thus, in terms of the analysis, location on either side of the diagonal does not make a

difference. These data assist in the evaluation of diversity of terms. This evaluation helps

identify research gaps in the reviewed literature.

Some of the peripheral themes include: (7) Green infrastructure and (13) Source

control; and these themes assume a leading role in discussions for they concentrate the

number of intra-thematic relations. The themes (17) Stormwater quality and (22) Water

Sensitive Urban Design are easily identified as nodal elements of external thematic

relationships, and in effect, serve as a focal points in the network for important themes.

The core-periphery model, using the continuous method, indicated a correlation

coefficient of 0.971 and Gini index of 0.625. The model re-concentrated as core members the

first five themes, with a correlation of 0.838. When only external relationships of the

institutions were considered, correlation was reduced to 0.236. The Gini index remained

similar to the previous evaluation, as did the number of core authors. The centralization

indices of the themes were not changed in both evaluations. A diagram of the classification of

themes is provided in Figure 2.7.

Figure 2.7 - Expressions searched in the Web of Science base

Historically, SUD research has focused upon hydraulic treatment to conduct

superficial flow, resulting in the conception of drainage systems based on conduits (Pompêo,

2000). That started to change in the 90s, when experience and adaptation of compensatory

techniques received more attention by research groups from Europe, USA and Australia.

Currently this new approach has provoked reflections and pointed to a paradigm shift in the

urban drainage area. The Figure 2.7 brings a ranking of themes that takes prominent position

related to urban drainage management practices, techniques and technologies of adaptive

methods. This set of novel concepts has in common the same principles and types of solution,

2.3.5 Relationships of centrality among author

The global network of researchers in the SUD is shown in Figure 2.8. The network

formed by the core authors is highlighted in black. According to the results of the

Core/Periphery model, using the categorical method, the core authors network is comprised

by Fletcher, TD; Deletic, A; Rauch, W; McCarthy, DT; Hatt, BE; Kleidorfer, M; Sitzenfrei,

R; Bach, PM; and Urich, C. The density of relationships between the core authors was of

7.083 while for the peripheral model, was 0.001.

Figure 2.8 - Global authors network

The relationships between core authors shown in Figure 2.8 are detailed and

quantified in Figure 2.9. In these two networks, the node size is proportional to the degree of

centrality of each author.

Figure 2.9 - Core authors network

Table 2.2 complements the data presented in Figure 2.9 with data from the affiliation

and publication history. This set of authors that takes a core position in the network belongs to

four universities, which also stood out in Figure 2.9. The majority of the authors has a

publication history of approximately two decades.

The classification of authors through the continuous method is shown in Figure 2.10,

when Gini index was of 0.961, and the concentration index of 0.880. In this chart, the group

of authors considered core are easily identified by the point of abrupt drop of the centrality

indices.

With the purpose of exploring structures underlying the network shown above, the

Figure 2.11 represents all authors with degree equal or greater than 10. This set of authors,

formed by 21 communities, is comprised of 543 authors and 4826 relationships. The nodes

identified in black represent the principal authors, classified according to the core-periphery

model.

Figure 2.11 - Network of authors with degree higher than 10

In Figure 2.11, it is worth noting the broad network located in the bottom right corner

is dominated by the core authors. Regarding the other smaller networks, interesting

perspectives arise for investigations into which methods or interests structure the relationship

between authors.

2.3.6 Relationships of intermediation capacity

The betweenness centrality index considers a network as a whole and is an

expression of the capacity of each author to establish relationships between other two non-

neighboring authors in the network. The relationships between the two non-neighboring

authors depends on the intermediary authors, which implies that the latter has a greater

influence over the social network. The authors with higher level of intermediation are



22

considered core connectors because they provide the connection for a large number of authors

in the network.

This metric enables the evaluation of importance of a particular author as a function

of the flow passing by that author. The 70 authors with the highest intermediate centrality

index in 2,012 relationships are shown in the network of Figure 2.12, with indices ranging

from 249.2 to 2341.6.

Figure 2.12 - Betweenness centrality

The 15 most relevant authors in terms of intermediation centrality are Marsalek, J

(2,341.6), Bradford, A (2,291. 2), Meyer, P (2,078.3), Mikkelsen, PS (1,901.4), Hunt, WF

(1,770.8), Sample, DJ (1,677.3), Pesseport, E (1,650.6), Davis, AP (1,509.8), Li, J (1,505.1),

Deletic, A (1,482.3), Rauch, W (1,374.8), Smith, P (1,254.9), Drake, J (1,242.0), Li, JY

(1,225.9), Fran, C (1,205.7).  In the intermediation network, the authors are identified as

strategically located in a central position within the network; and they have an important role

in the flux by their capacity to concentrate and make directly available information of other

authors. They are authors that facilitate direct contact with many others without the necessity

of intermediates, and exert important influence in the network information flux.

2.4 Conclusions

The sociometric and bibliometric techniques described in this paper helped identify,

map and objectively evaluate the domain formed by scientific publications related to a set of



23

22 themes related to SUD, involving researchers from 82 countries, 2,027 research centers,

8,237 authors interacting through 11,857 citation relationships. In this domain, 72% of the

relationships occurred between authors from European and North American countries.

The research supporting SUDS has drawn attention from a large number of countries.

From the results, it can be inferred that the central locations, in terms of relationships between

researchers and research centers, are USA, Australia, Canada, England, and Germany. When

the internal relationships of each author of each location are considered, the PRC takes the

second place among the core countries. Considering the great number of authors that

articulate themselves in a large international, it is difficult to generalize tendencies in the area

guided only by the geographical location of the authors of seminal texts. On the other hand,

the domain shows that, if there are such pretensions, research should be expanded to capture

local and regional nuances to fully explore SUD. From that expanded domain, generalizations

would become more realistic.

Among the 8,237 authors, the ones considered as core authors in terms of density of

citation relationships with authors from other countries are Fletcher, TD; Deletic, A; Rauch,

W; McCarthy, DT; Hatt, BE; Kleidorfer, M; Sitzenfrei, R; Bach, PM; and Urich, C. Although

these pose as references to the domain due to their relationships in the central network, there

are other authors that stand out with relevant levels of leadership in 20 smaller networks.

Moreover, if the evaluation is accomplished under the perspective of intermediation, the 15

most relevant authors are Marsalek, J; Bradford, A; Meyer, P; Mikkelsen, OS; Hunt, WF;

Sample, DJ; Pesseport, E; Davis, AP; Li, J; Deletic, A; Rauch, W; Smith, P; Drake; Li, JY;

and Fran, C. While authors from the first core group dominates in terms of strong

relationships among each other, mainly because they belong to a selective group of 4

universities, the second group stand out because their publications broaden the reach of SUD

knowledge produced by other authors.

The majority of research conducted on SUD has been conducted within developed

countries. That probably derives from the investment capability of these countries and their

concerns with alternative solutions based on the SUD perspective, assigning greater

importance to the environmental issues. The low participation of African and South-American

countries, which provided only 2% of the citation relationships, can be explained by the lower

priority environmental issues may have in developing countries.  However, it may represent a

missed research and development opportunity if not corrected.

The most active themes in the academic community included: Stormwater

management, Low impact development, Integrated urban water management, bioretention



24

and best management practice. The nuclear position of these themes may indicate interesting

paths to future research regarding SUD and may suggest analytical efforts to try to unify the

nomenclature and form a domain of scientific research. The formation of a domain would

facilitate, on the one hand, a deepening of research, and on the other hand, bring benefits to

policymakers so they may understand and justify public policies based on a more consistent

theoretical diagnosis about how important it is to follow up such references on SUD.

In the present research, it was verified that the Brazilian researchers appear isolated,

not getting any prominence in any of the connections presented. This may occur because of

the different terminologies used from those considered in this study. Also, this groups have

published in other languages than English or because Brazilian academic production is not

indexed in the platform web of Science. The language variable can be a considerable

limitation, even if the possibilities of articles written in a language other than English have a

very low probability of being cited in the international scientific community, which uses

English as the basis for scientific communication in studies on the subjects covered by this

research. However, before being a limitation, this last hypothesis can be seen as an important

discovery that can be evaluated by the methodology developed, for example, by expanding

the databases used in future research. This could open interesting ways to objectively evaluate

whether such limitation arises from the intentional strategy of the Brazilian scientific

community to refrain from publishing in English or from a limitation imposed by the English

language as a barrier to international insertion.

3. MODULAR SIZING FOR BIORETENTION SYSTEMS TO URBAN
SCENARIOS CONSIDERING TIME SCALE AND INCREASING URBANIZATION -
A CASE STUDY IN THE CITY OF SÃO CARLOS, BRAZIL*

*ROSA, A.; MACEDO, M. B.; SAMPLE, D.; SOUZA, V. C. B.; MENDIONDO, E. M. Modular sizing for
bioretention systems to urban scenarios considering time scale and increasing urbanization - a case study in the
city of São Carlos, Brazil. Submitted to Journal of Hydrology. Protocolo HYDROL21595

Abstract

Especially after the 90s, the literature and research addressing the theme of sustainable urban
drainage systems have expanded. However, there is still a gap in the supply of bioretention
systems sizing methods that consider the characteristics and climatic conditions of different
regions where these practices are to be implemented. This paper presents a new bioretention
sizing methodology called BIoREteNtIon CEll method – BIRENICE, with a focus in
subtropical climates. The method presents, as innovation, the modular sizing with simulation
scenarios. The methodology details the sizing and simulation method proposed by
BIRENICE. A case study with a bioretention field application was made for a
microcatchment at Campus 2 of University of São Paulo, in São Carlos, Brazil. We then
compared the results with HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modeling System - Hydrologic Modeling
System), an already consolidated model. The proposed model, BIRENICE, makes possible to
calculate the dimensions of a bioretention cell for future scenarios. The simulation module
presented the water balance behavior over time, allowing the confirmation of the sizing. The
results demonstrate that the simulations for BIRENICE method are accurate and have a
similar behavior with HEC-HMS. In addition, BIRENICE shows that the stored volume
decays by percolation over time, while in HEC-HMS, this loss is not estimated in reservoirs.
By comparison, the sizing and simulation method proposed, BIRENICE, has little difference
in front of results found with HEC-HMS, showing its applicability. For further research, we
recommend to monitor bioretention cell in field for comparing actual data with simulated data
by the proposed method.

3.1 Introduction

According to Pômpeo (2000), in Brazil, urban drainage and runoff treatment have

been focused on hydraulic conveyance, which remains the prevailing design objective.

Traditional stormwater drainage has been found to be incapable of handling the impacts of

urban development (Dietz, Clausen, 2008). Therefore, the development of alternative

technologies emerged to deal with the impacts of urbanization. As an alternative to traditional

drainage measures, Low Impact Development (LID) practices have emerged and have

become increasingly popular (Sample &amp;amp; Liu, 2014). LID practices handles urbanization

impacts in a holistic manner and seeks to counterbalance their effects systematically.

Recently, the conservation of the water balance prior to urbanization has been a relevant focus



28

and is employed by reducing impermeable surface creation and increasing infiltration through

a variety of means.  LID practices also reduces runoff volume and slows the speed as the

volume moves downstream (Prince George's County, 2000). Baptista et al. (2005) presented

an overview of types and operation of several LID practices. Those alternative technologies

for urban drainage, which are focused on low impact and sustainable urban drainage,  have

other names according to different authors, such as: Alternative Techniques (Fletcher et al.,

2014); Best Management Practices (BMP) (Davis et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou,

2014); Compensatory Techniques (Fletcher et al., 2014); Diffuse Pollution Control

(Panagopoulos et al., 2013); Management of Urban Drainage (Fletcher et al., 2014);

Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) (Fletcher et al., 2014; Zhou, 2014), and Water

Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) (Davis et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2014; Lee &amp;amp; Yigitcanlar,

2010; Sharma et al., 2008). However, the most common terms are LID, BMP, WSUD e

SUDS.

The practices within LID technologies can be applied in three major scales: font

control, micro drainage and macro drainage (Marsalekk and Schereier, 2009). A great number

of practices, such as infiltration trenches, permeable pavements and green roof are usually

employed in a large scale with a better interaction between user and technology. The

bioretention practices, on the other hand, are also known as rain gardens, and even though

they can be used in a large scale they are a good option for micro-drainage (Sample et al.,

2013). Two treatment processes within the bioretention practices are filtration and infiltration

(Erickson et al., 2013), which contribute to both water retention as well as the treatment of the

water runoff quality (Sample et al., 2013).

Although there are over two decades of studies in LID operation and sizing, most

studies have been focused upon hydrologic performance and water quality limited to the

laboratory-scale, once field studies are more difficult, more expensive and harder to isolate

single variables (Liu et al., 2014). There also remain gaps on how to predict the hydrologic

effectiveness and water quality of bioretention (Lucas &amp;amp; Sample, 2015). Additionally, little

has been conducted in subtropical climates, which presents distinct hydrologic characteristics

with high temperatures and evapotranspiration rates. Nonetheless, developing countries are

located in these regions, which have different socioeconomic conditions, large urban

agglomerations and megacities associated with a lack of urban planning and economic

contrasts. There is a lack of understanding in the basic physical processes through which LID

practices actually works when applied in field (interaction with the user, visual integration

issues, waste and water quality issues, and potential risk of environmental degradation) (Liu et



29

al., 2014, Sample &amp;amp; Liu, 2014). A particular need is to concern the sizing issue, i.e., what size

is appropriate for a real watershed (Roy-Poirier et al., 2010).

Many authors have been working on developing models, simulations and

standardized methods and parameters aiming at a proper evaluation and design of LID

practices. Elliott &amp;amp; Trowsdale (2007) reviewed appropriate evaluation models for SUDS,

LID, BMPs, WSUD and more. Winston et al. (2011), Lintern et al. (2011) and Fletcher et al.

(2015) discussed how to choose the key parameters that can be used as a sizing criteria and its

influence in bioretention performance and useful life. In Brazil, Souza et al. (2011) adapted a

rainfall-runoff model to simulate LID practices in urban drainage systems under different

mitigation scenarios.

Table 3.1, adapted from Liu et al. (2014), presents different models used to simulate

and measure LID practices, including bioretention. The first column on the left brings the

model used; the middle column describes briefly the model; and the right column cites some

researchers that have used the correspondent model on their research. The models SWMM,

HEC-HMS, RECARGA and DRAINMOD present the advantage of being public-domain,

which makes its acquisition easier. The DRAINMOD and RECARGA are less used models

once the first was originally developed to simulate agricultural fields and has been adapted to

bioretention and the last was developed to simulate a single bioretention cell. However,

SWMM and HEC-HMS are hydrologic models employed for distinct purposes, including LID

practices and bioretention and are more internationally supported.

The integration of runoff performance and sizing methodology has recently been

explored. Silveira and Goldenfum (2007) present a pre-sizing "general methodology" for LID

practices. However, their methodology only considers quantitative aspects in peak flows and

volume controls. Akan &amp;amp; Houghtalen (2003) developed a detention basin sizing methodology

that integrated sediment removal as assessed by total suspended solids (TSS), but no other

water quality constituents.

Given the increasing adoption of biofilters and bioretention, it is critical that their

size should incorporate key design parameters within an integrative approach. In this paper,

we present a method to size a bioretention cell, which has a computer-based simulation

module, using a simple method known as loads detention to verify the dimensioning. The

proposed methodology considers the range of hydrological effects (Figure 3.1) guiding

treatment processes from the individual lot to the micro drainage scale. Figure 3.1 shows the

variables of the water balance and theirs expected temporal variation. Sizing is made based on

the quantification of the cell storage volume, calculated by the difference between inflow and

outflow hydrogram peak, in order to find the water balance as closely as possible to the pre

urbanization period. The hydrograms used are obtained by the computer-based simulation

module.

inflow, storage and outflow variables. The line colours of the graph at (c) corresponds to the inputs and outputs
represented in (b). In (b), it is possible to observe the temporal variation of each variable as it is the expected in
the observation from the computer-based simulation. In (c), more specifically, it is possible to see the volume of
the cell shown by the dotted lines, which is equivalent to the peak of the stored volume. After reaching the peak.

it begins to be output flow by the spillway.

As part of the innovation, we also propose the construction of bioretention cells

using an incremental approach, as a time-adapted strategy to improve the overall life of

bioretention structure. The method proposed is the construction of a bioretention cell

structured to use multiple gradual scenarios as opposed to building a single structure to meet

the final plan (Figure 3.2). Then, it is possible to develop a plan to supply the long-term

demand with amortized costs during the lifetime of the work.

Figure 3.2 - Graphs showing the increase of capacity of the urban drainage system using LID practices according
to its demand. In (a), we have the behavior of modular design, in which system capacity is increased by three

different modules

Finally, it was developed a case study in an urban basin in the city of São Carlos to

verify the real application of the model and the modular design. The model’s performance is

assessed and compared with another commonly accepted model, HEC-HMS, using design-

based examples with a range of event-based simulation. With this comparison, we intend to

show that the proposed model presents similar results as an established model, but it has the

advantage of being focused on bioretention and ease to use, beyond enabling the user to make

changes in the equation used for better meeting their goals.

3.2 Methods

In this section, it will be presented the conceptual methods of dimensioning proposed

by many authors, directing to a discussion about the development of the model design and

methodology. In order to verify its applicability, the developed model was compared to an

established model (HEC-HMS) and a bioretention cell was built in the field.

3.2.1 Sizing theory

Sizing by runoff retention (Vmas,quanti, eff?Qquanti)

For calculation purposes, we define the following mass variables as a function of

time: HE as the accumulated water depth at the input and HS as accumulated water depth at the

output, both of them are measured over the drainage area. The maximum potential treatment

volume can be estimated by solving a set of equations (Eq. 3.1 - 4), obtained from Silveira &amp;amp;

Goldenfun (2007). See the illustrative scheme of parameters used in the sizing in appendix C.

H= =( 60 × ? 60 ) Eq. 3.1
?= ×× Eq. 3.2
q = + × Eq. 3.3
eff =? ? ×? Eq. 3.4
Where: Vmaxquanti is the pre-sizing volume (mm height equivalent) to mitigate excessive urban runoff volume.
The total volume can be expressed as Vbioretention = Vmaxquanti • A, which can be simplified as Vbioretention = hmax
• Abioretention (plant) ? hmax • Abiofilter (plant). ? is the runoff coefficient with the ratio between percolation area and
implementation area; A is the contribution area; C is the runoff coefficient of contribution area; L and B represent
length and width dimensions (m) and T  represents return time (years); ? is the filler material porosity; ? is the
ratio between the percolation area and volume (mm); Ksat is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm h-1); ?
is the infiltration efficiency reduction coefficient due to clogging and, finally, qpre is the desired flow goal, which
is an environmental or pre-development flow established in the Drainage Master Plan.

Sizing by pollution charge retention (Vmas,quali, eff?Yquali)

Quality parameters are normally incorporated based upon the methodology proposed

by Akan &amp;amp; Houghtalen (2003), and Hatt et al. (2009). The hypothesis considers a trial size

based upon solids mass transport retention time (tTSS quali-IN), derived from urban drainage, and

the bioretention evacuation time (tTSS quali-OUT), which set an extra volume, Vmaxquali. Akan &amp;amp;

Houghtalen (2003), and Hatt et al. (2009) discuss the relationship between Vmaxquali and

output structure size and type using the set of  Eq. 3.5 - 9. See the illustrative scheme of

parameters used in the sizing in appendix C.

P= × , / (Spillway output) Eq.3.7

Where: Vquali and hcquali respectively represent the volume and the detention water depths for quality control
measured at the outlet structure; cquali and bquali are considered parameters; ko is the dimensionless orifice
discharge coefficient; ao is the orifice area; g represents the gravitational acceleration, ip is the maximum input
discharge, tp is the maximum discharge time; kw is the dimensionless discharge coefficient; L represents the
spillway width; w90 is the period in which at least 90% of runoff will be held; r90 as the time to which 90% of the
flow will be evacuated; Vmax,quali is the maximum water detention volume; tretention is the required time for TSS
retention; tdetention(j) as the required detention time, and uSTT (j) represents the settling velocity of the TSS j-th
fraction; and, finally, effremotion 90% ?Y is the overall removal efficiency for 90% of diffuse pollution charged by
TSS transport.

Sizing for bioretention device (Vmas,bio, eff?xbio)

Eq. 3.10 to 13 constitute the set of equations, presented in the Technical Design

Guidelines (McAuley, 2009), to estimate the efficiency of bioretention design. See the

illustrative scheme of parameters used in the sizing in appendix C.

= ,?( , . , ) Eq 3.10
, = . . . Eq.3.11= . . (? . + , .? ) Eq.3.12

In wich: Lbio is the length of bioretention cell; Qmax,?Pe is the maximum discharge rate entering the bioretention
cell, Bh,flooded and Bbio respectively represent the mean width of the transversal flooded area and the width in
bioretention cell; Ks is the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity; hmax is the maximum flooding depth above the
bioretention cell; dbiofilter is the biofilter depth; tc is the concentration time of contribution area; fh=0,5hmax is the
infiltration rate for water height equal to half of the maximum flooding depth; ø is the soil porosity; n is a
turbulence empirical hydraulic parameter proposed by Fair &amp;amp; Geyer (1954). For preliminary design, it is
recommended that it is assigned the value of 1.33 (PGC, 2009).

The bioretention efficiency eff ?X,bio depends on the hydraulic loading rate, defined as

the ratio between Qmax,?Pe and Abio, on hSTT, defined as the biofilter clogging depth, and on

hmeta, defined as an intermediate flooding depth to remove pollutants loads via filtration. The

advantage of using specific bioretention equations is that it can incorporate parameters such as

basin concentration time (tc) and hydraulic criteria for the hydrologic regime under which the

bioretention is subjected to.



35

Sizing by computational simulation

This fourth method integrates the detention and bioretention process and is valid for

hydrological simulation. It is used the level pool flow lamination (PULS method) and total

percolation in potential wet area (Aw), by the Green-Ampt method (Tucci 1993). The

discharge structure in bioretention cell output is sized in order to preserve the pre-

development of water balance. Infiltration at the bottom and the sidewalls depends on the

particle size and geometry of the soil that surrounds the device. Assuming the bioretention

cell with rectangular area plant (ATC) and maximum depth (hmax,LID), the criterion is

summarized as: optimize Vcell, hmaxLID and lip, subject to restrictions in Eq. 3.14 – 16.

, ? , (restriction of maximum flows) Eq.3.14? ? ? , +2? ? , (restriction of flowing excess) Eq.3.15

Cf,max*fmax the maximum pollutant load that seeps into the device and Cstandard * Cstandard*Qpreurbanization,max, max
maximum pollution load allowed the legal standard (see CONAMA 357/05).

3.2.2 Bioretention Cell Method – BIRENICE

Bioretention cells have multiple functions, including the reduction of runoff volume

(by increasing infiltration), the reduction of peak runoff and the reduction of pollutants in

discharge flows through both mass reduction and physical and biological treatment (LIU et

al., 2014), favoring the maintenance of water balance based on a pre urbanization period.

Bioretention can affect both water quantity and quality. Predicting hydrological and water

quality results, as a function of changing bioretention design parameters, is essential to

improve performance.

To facilitate the design of a bioretention cell, we have developed a computational

model to simulate the design, using unique parameters to each cell given its specific location.

A key feature of the method is that it estimates the eventual size of the bioretention cell in

multiple, cumulative scenarios. This enables the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and

iteratively simulate each bioretention cells in steps, by setting the desired time intervals and

the input parameters.



36

The computational model, BIRENICE, was developed in VBA (Visual Basic for

Applications). The BIRENICE method allows the adoption of two rain duration values as

sizing criteria. In addition, the user can choose either a single design event or continuous

simulation. In the simple mode, the structure simulation is done for a single design event, in

continuous simulation; it is possible to simulate multiple events, creating a worksheet

containing graphs for comparison of results from each simulated event. The model runs for

the present time and, then, continues until the bioretention cell is completely drained.

The proposed model follows the script shown in Figure 3.3. The bioretention design

input parameters are in blue, which include: return period, rain duration, contributing drainage

area, soil properties, occupation scenario and filtration material medium (% empty). The gray

color shows the intermediate parameters, calculated by the model, as follows: rainfall

intensity, rainfall, effective rainfall, runoff coefficient and peak flow. As the main system

output, there is the cell volume, from which it will be sized and designed based on the

available field area. In simulation module, used to verify the sizing (represented by the pink

part in Figure 3.3), it is used PULS method, which has as outputs the hydrograph for: inflow,

storage, outflow and percolation. These parameters, metrics and methods for computing them

are explained in the following sections.

Figure 3.3 - Diagram used for modeling and computational simulation. The model input parameters are in
blue. The pink part is the simulation module. The methods used in the intermediate and output variables calculus

are in red color.



37

3.2.3 Hydrological risk and return period

The risk adopted for designing stormwater management systems is defined as the

probability of occurrence or when overcoming a considered critical event for a given return

period (T). On risk analysis, it is implied that events have their origin in natural phenomena

and that there are statistical hypotheses related to the processing of hydrological variables as

being random. In this case, if P (X ? x) is the probability of an X ? x event, then the

probability of R (hydrological risk) that X ? x occurs at least once in n years is given by Eq.

3.17. Knowing that Eq. 3.18 (T) gives the return period, the hydrological risk can be written

as in Eq. 3.19.

=1?[1? ( ? )] Eq. 3.17= ( ) Eq. 3.18=1? 1? Eq. 3.19
According to this definition, it is known that the smaller the hydrological risk is, the

higher is the return period. The adoption of a higher return period implies to size a device for

increased flow, i.e., the structure will have higher cost. Considering the lack of resources, the

choice of return period is economically limited.

3.2.4 Soil properties

Determining the soil type and hydrologic group is important to set the runoff

division. In this model, the curve number method was chosen, identifying the CN coefficient

according to Drainage Manual and Stormwater Management (São Paulo, 2012). The

coefficient is, then, applied in the Natural Resources Conservation Service/Soil Conservation

Service - NRCS/SCS hydrologic method (USDA, 1986) to determine the runoff. Another

important soil property is the permeability coefficient, in order to quantify the percolation

over time.

3.2.5 Contribution of a drainage area and occupation scenario

The contribution of a drainage area is determined to quantify the peak flow runoff

and total rainfall volume. In urban areas, there is a great difficulty in defining the contribution



38

area due to lack of alignment between the drainage projects and their implementation, as well

as the large number of illegal foreign contributions.

It must also be determined the current land use area and occupation, as well as for

future planning scenarios. Future scenarios should be determined in accordance with the

guidelines of the local master plan.

3.2.6 Rainfall intensity and total rainfall

To calculate rainfall intensity the model uses the IDF equation (Eq. 3.20) with the

coefficients a, b, n and m to the desired location. Then, we calculated total rainfall using the

rainfall intensity (i) and the duration of the rain (t), according to Eq. 3.21.= .( ) Eq. 3.20= . Eq. 3.21
3.2.7 Effective rainfall

Effective rainfall is calculated by the method of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS-

CN) represented by Eq. 3.22 and 3.23.

&gt;0.2 ? = ( . ). ; ? 0.2 ? =0 Eq. 3.22= ?254 Eq. 3.23
Where: Pe corresponds to effective rainfall; P to rainfall; and S to ground potential retention.

The CN coefficient represents the soil ability to retain runoff, ranging according to

land use and occupation and soil type. Their values are tabulated (Drainage Manual and Water

Management Stormwater - Stormwater Drainage Manual and Management, 2012), and use, as

input, the soil hydrologic group and its use and occupation. If the area has more than a soil

group and more than one use and occupation, the CN average value is then computed by

means of Eq. 3.24.

= ? .? Eq. 3.24
Where: Ai corresponds to the area of i-th basin portion corresponding to CNi coefficient.



39

3.2.8 Runoff coefficient

The use of rational method for the peak flow forecast requires determining the runoff

coefficient C. It represents the runoff generation percentage for the contribution area. The

calculation was done according to Eq. 3.25 (KAWATOKO, 2012).

= Eq. 3.25
3.2.9 Peak flow

For bioretention basins application as stormwater treatment practices, it is

recommended small areas of contribution and microdrainage scale. Thus, it is considered the

basins as small ones, when they are smaller than 3km2, following the recommendations of the

Stormwater Management Drainage Manual of São Paulo, and it is used the rational method

(Eq. 3.26) to calculate the peak flow (Qpeak).

= . . Eq. 3.26
3.2.10 Inflow, outflow, percolation and storage

One can make the inflow determination through rational triangular hydrograph

method, taking as input to its construction the peak flow previously calculated and the basin

concentration time. As the basin has small dimensions, it is reasonable to assume that the rain

duration is equal to the basin concentration time. Thus, the hydrogram is represented as an

isosceles triangle.

For the outflow, it was proposed a triangular weir with a 90° opening angle. Thus,

the flow rate is calculated by the Thomson equation (Eq. 3.27) as a function of water height

(h) above vertex of the weir.

=1.4 .? . Eq. 3.27
Percolation flow is compounded by the percolation on the structure base and walls

(Eq. 3.28). The flow is calculated based on the Green-Ampt and Darcy method (Eq. 3.29)

(ERICKSON et al., 2013).



40

In which: fbase is percolation flow in the base; flateal is percolation flow in the walls; K is hydraulic conductivity;
Abase is the structure base area; ? is wetting front suction; L is the saturated area length; and h is water level
height above the base device.

Considering the saturated soil, the hydraulic unit gradient can be obtained in

literature (Souza, 2002). Thus, it is possible to calculate the percolation on the sidewalls using

Eq. 3.30. The total area of the sidewalls, as a function of time (t), is calculated through Eq.

3.31.

= .??. ( ) Eq. 3.30( )= 2. + +2.?( ) Eq. 3.31
Where: Alateral (t) is the sidewalls area and h(t) is the height of the water depth.

The purpose of the LID device in this project is to mitigate the effects of urbanization

so that the effective rainfall is equal to, or less than, the prior urbanization situation, i.e. the

situation described in the year 1900. According to Tucci et al. (1993), the dimensioning of

intensive measures for flood control of hydraulic structures, such as reservoirs, is made to

operate the reservoir in such a way to dispose the natural flow until it damps the peak flow

and it is transferred downstream. In Tucci et al. (1995), simplified methods to scale flood

control structures in holding a tank are presented and they use only a few input hydrograph

information such as the value of peak, peak time and/or time of concentration. Considering

these elements and establishing a critical flow output, which is less than or equal to the natural

flow of the river, it is estimated the volume of the required reservoir. Thus, in this case, the

storage (S) is calculated using the difference in depth minus the peaks, according to Eq. 3.32.

= . Eq. 3.32
The bioretention cell is filled with a granular material. By knowing the medium

material porosity, the estimated volume of the compensatory structure is calculated using Eq.

3.33.

= . Eq. 3.33
Where: n is media material porosity.



41

3.2.11 PULS Method

The PULS method is also known as the “Level Pool Routing” and it is used to

simulate retention device-behavior. It considers the continuous equation, described in Eq. 3.34

(CHOW et al., 1998). Adjusting to a bioretention cell inputs and outputs, we obtain the Eq.

3.35, which describes output mainly as a function of the percolation and outflow spillway

geometry. Dividing the flood hydrograph propagation into discrete intervals of width ?t, the

continuity equation is integrated during each interval, providing the retained volume in the

device. In this paper, we used the tabular method with automation in BIRENICE.

+ =0 Eq. 3.34?? = ? ? , Eq. 3.35
Where: St is storage volume; It represents inputs (runoff (Qin) and rainfall directly in  the bioretention cell); Ot
represents the outputs corresponding to the outflow (Qout); and fTC,t corresponds to soil percolation.

Applying the previously described parameters, each bioretention cell should be sized

to meet specific runoff reduction and retention goals. Any considerations should be based

upon its individual layout.

3.3 Case Study – Field Application
3.3.1 Study site

The field application of the proposed simulation method was made for a micro

drainage system located at Campus - Area 2 of University of São Paulo, located in São

Carlos, SP, Brazil (Figure 3.4). The study area is located in the sub-basin that belongs to São

Carlos’s urban basin, but with different soil occupancy levels, since it is located on a still-

expanding campus. Figure 3.5 shows contribution area layout, indicating the paths that

contribute to runoff. The sub-basin has a total area of 2,3 ha.



42

Figure 3.4 - Application field of experimental bioretention system - the red point represents its location in
the Mineirinho sub-basin, which comprises São Carlos urban basin.

Figure 3.5 - Bioretention implementation area - a) Map of the Campus – Area 2 of USP- São Carlos,
containing all eight basins proposed for a bioretention technique installation; b) Contribution area scheme

Scenarios were developed projecting the size of the campus at pre development (year

1900), current (year 2013) and future (year 2025); the existent bioretention cell was

incrementally expanded.

Overall, the retention catchments are sized based on a quota limit, which aims to the

volume that is reached when critical flow occurs. In the case of bioretention cell, it also scales

to a critical flow to be transferred to the receiving body. However, in this case, as the goal is

to restore pre-settlement patterns to avoid impacts on the adopted downstream critical flow, it

is that which of them had for the natural environment. For this case study, the 1900 scenario

represents the natural environment.

Otherwise, the site of application is in the expansion process and is not fully

occupied, according to his master plan. Thus, it is important to establish scenarios to assess

how the progressive increase in the land use and occupation impact the runoff production.

Considering this forecast, the method developed also scales future modular expansions to

meet increased demands due to changes in land use.

3.3.2 Determination of model parameters

Hydrological Risk and Return Period

According to the Drainage Manual and Stormwater Management (São Paulo, 2012)

for microdrainage, it is recommended to use return period values ranging between 2 to 10

years. Tucci et al. (1993) and Tucci et al. (1995) also recommend that, for micro drainage

articles, time ranging used stays between 2 to 10 yeas. Considering the Brazilian situation and

its financial constraints, long-term investments t imply high construction costs. Thus, Tucci et

al. (1993) recommends different values of Tr for various occupations and, for occupancy by

public buildings, it is recommended the value of 5 years. Thus, it was selected a value of 5

years, representing medium hydrological risk. The hydrological risk was calculated based on

Eq. 3.36.=1? 1? Eq 3.36
Rainfall intensity

Using the IDF curve (Eq. 3.20), parameters proposed by Barbassa (1991) for the city

of São Carlos, it was possible to calculate rainfall intensity relative to the application field. In

Eq. 3.36, i (mm/h) represents rainfall intensity; T (years) is return period; and t (min) is rain

duration.

=1519 ? ,( +16 , ) Eq.3.37
Rain duration

To estimate total precipitation, departing from rainfall intensity, it was used a 20-

minute rainfall duration. To select the time of precipitation, the precipitation intensity

variations were studied as a function of time t of precipitation and the return time Tr by

varying them. It was observed that from the time t 25min, the precipitation intensity curves

for different Tr are almost coincident. As Barbassa (1991) noted, the more frequent rain time

in the city of São Carlos is 20 min.



44

Contributing drainage area and occupation scenarios

We delineated the contributing drainage areas using an updated version of Campus –

Area 2 map and field visits - some during rain period, for better observation of the

contribution of the sub-basins and its limits.  We also manually completed the delineations

using AutoCAD 2010. The contribution area has a total of 2.3ha.

The updated map of Campus – Area 2 also comprises existing buildings, the

buildings in construction and those approved for construction in the near future. Given the

obvious lack of information corresponding to the completion of construction, all of these

areas were considered as complete in 2013. Additionally, the map shows the Permanent

Preservation Areas (APP), a strict conservation area, which comprises, among others,

riverbanks, to some extent proportional to the river width. The non-occupied areas and those

outside the APPs were classified as pasture, due to the vegetation in the area, once it is

undergrowth and predominantly Brachiaria sp. According to the campus master plan, the

future occupation scenario was assumed to be at 50% in 2025, 75% in 2050 and 85% in 2100.

To simulate the past scenario, setting the year 1900 as reference, the entire area was assumed

to consist of native forest.

Soil properties

The determination of the soil type was based on particle size analysis. According to

the distribution curve of ground particle size, the soil belongs to group C - loamy soils with

total clay content of 20% to 30% - but with no impervious clay layer or containing rocks at

depths up to 1.2m. For forested areas, it was forests in poor condition, with CN 77. The

occupied areas were considered industrial districts (72% waterproofing) with CN 91. For the

pasture areas, it was adopted CN 79, pasture in average conditions. For APP, there were

adopted CN 73, forest in good condition in 2013, and in the years 2025, 2050 and 2100, forest

on bad terms with CN 77.

Infiltration tests were also carried out in the original soil of the area, for further

identification of flow percolation. As results, the hydraulic conductivity coefficient was

1.62x10-4 cm.s-1, which classified the soil as low permeability.



45

Filtration media material

As filtering material it was selected a composition of a 0.70 m gravel layer and a 2 m

sand layer. These materials have the respective 45% and 30% as % empty.

3.3.3 HEC-HMS simulation

In order to verify the applicability for the proposed method, we compared it with

another numerical model, Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS 3.5) (USACE, 2010).

HEC-HMS is a rainfall-runoff model, which allows simulations in concentrated or semi-

distributed forms. It has been successfully used in impacts caused by climate change and land

use change in small basins studies (MEENU, et al., 2012; SAMIRAN, et al., 2012;

SIMONOVIC, 2010; McENROE, 2010; CUNDERLIK, 2005).

For the simulation with HEC-HMS, the study used the curve number method in order

to determine effective rainfall and peak flow. The same two scenarios were adopted: with land

use in 1900 as a period of unchanged vegetation and the altered (urbanized) scenario

projected to 2013 - 2025, both represented by the change in CN values in each simulation.

We also propose the evaluation of the catchment’s response to a 20-minute rainfall

event of 10-year return period, same parameters as BIRENICE. For the simulation, we

assumed a short-term water balance in order to estimate the bioretention cell’s size. In the

HEC-HMS structure, a reservoir represents the bioretention cell at the output, composed by a

triangular spillway. The useful volume of the cell is adopted as the soil empty ratio. A stage-

volume curve characterizes the cell’s geometry. In this case, the calculation of hydrograms is

made using the unit hydrogram method and, to quantify the storage and discharge variation, it

is used the Muskingum method.

3.4 Results and Discussion

3.4.1 BIRENICE sizing

The model was structured to be used with multiple scenarios as opposed to building a

single structure to meet a final plan (in 2100). Table 3.2 shows the main results of BIRENICE

method (Calculation memorial is attached at the end of this chapter). From the construction

area availability and storage and cell volume calculated, it was determined the practice

dimensions. Initially, only the first module is built, which will meet the first stage (2013-

2025). In 2025, to attend the urbanization expansion, the second module will be recalculated



46

and built as an expansion of the first one, which will attend the second stage (2025-2050).

Then, in 2050, the same process will be conducted and the third module will be constructed,

which will meet the third stage (2050-2100).

The structure should be built from upstream to downstream, so that the input

structure can be used in all stages, avoiding rebuilding. The area required for the final plan

(2100) has been put apart since the beginning. Figure 3.6 depicts the scheme by which the

bioretention dimensions are incrementally in expansion with each interaction, sized by the

methodology described in this paper. In short, for 2025, the first module dimensions are:

12.99 (height) x 5.6 (width) x 3.2 (depth) m. The highlighted area in red shows the modular

expansion planned. Parameters considered to size all bioretention cell modules and its final

dimensions are in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2 - Bioretention cell modular sizing for application field

To confirm the sizing obtained, a simulation module was used. The results are

presented in Figure 3.7 for the year 2025 (first module - bioretention area of 72.74m²) (Figure



47

3.7a), 2050 (second module - bioretention area of 118.22 m²) (Figure 3.7b) and 2100 (third

module– bioretention area of 140.28m²) (Figure 3.7c). It has been noted an increasing runoff

for future scenarios (with increased urbanization) resulting consequently in an increase in

storage and bioretention cell volume (Table 3.3).

As for storage, we have observed that the structure reaches its peak around 30 min

for all scenarios, at the time the outflow starts. The results of simulation module display a

reduction in the peak flow to none and total volume transferred to downstream, accomplishing

one of the goals of using LID practices. It also states that the transferred volume difference is

stored in the soil and percolates through the ground, replenishing the groundwater. Therefore,

there is a water balance closest to pre-urbanization scenario.

for (a) 2025, (b) 2050 and (c) 2100.

Modular sizing conserves limited financial resources and more closely follows future

needs. Resources are finite; so building a smaller structure leads to a cost reduction;

consequently, so the saved capital can be spent on other projects. This hedges risk, as the

predictions of future conditions at the campus are by nature uncertain, thus the structure is

sized for immediate needs during each scenario. Predictions can be as close to reality as closer

they are performed, thus, a three-step sizing was done. In the future, before the following

modules are constructed, new designs and associated sizing will have evaluated with the

model using updated (and hence more accurate) input data.

3.4.2 BIRENICE AND HEC-HMS simulations

To simulate and compare with BIRENICE and HEC-HMS methods, the return

period of 5 years and 20-minute rainfall duration were selected as input data. The rainfall

intensity was then calculated, giving a value of 77.87 mm/h.  The comparative results for the

year 1900 (pre urbanization) and 2025 (first stage) will be presented in this section.

The comparison between BIRENICE and HEC-HMS was done for the years 1900

(pre-urbanization) and 2025 (corresponding to the first module, therefore, the field

implantation for monitoring).

We first determined input hydrographs for the corresponding bioretention cell

catchment area. Figure 3.8 shows the results obtained with both methods for the years 1900

(pre-urbanization) (Figure 3.8a) and 2025 (Figure 3.8b). It can be noted that, for both

scenarios, the peak flow occur 20 min after the rainfall starts, for BIRENICE and HEC-HMS.

However, there is a little difference in hydrograph shape and peak. This difference is

associated with the different methods used by the two models. Once BIRENICE uses the

rational method triangular hydrograph; HEC-HMS uses the SCS-CN with the unit

hydrograph. Moreover, BIRENICE estimates greater peak flows than HEC-HMS; (Table 3.3).

The difference between the peak flows of the two methods is lower for a greater level of

urbanization (2025), presenting a percentage difference of 6%.

The inflow hydrograph obtained through BIRENICE method was used as input data

to size the bioretention cell, as shown in the previous section. BIRENICE and HEC-HMS also

simulate the internal water dynamics in the basin for 2025 (Figure 3.9).

Figure 3.9 - Internal water dynamics simulation and cumulative volumes for 2025 with methods (a) BIRENICE
and (b) HEC-HMS

For the volume stored in the basin, in 2025, the BIRENICE method gives a storage

peak in 30 min (10 min after the peak flow from inlet hydrograph), presenting a volume value

around 500 mm (Figure 3.9a). After the peak, the storage decreases quickly and continuous

due to the percolation process. On other hand, for HEC-HMS method the storage peak

volume is around 1500 mm and occurs in 50 min (30 min after the peak flow from inlet

hydrograph) (Figure 3.9b). The simulations have a difference in the order of 70% as the basin

storage capacity, for both scenarios, being the most significant difference between the two

methods. To explain this difference, it should be noted that the HEC-HMS does not have a

specific option for LID practices, thus simulating the bioretention cell was done through an

adaptation in a reservoir simulation. In this program function, it is not possible to insert

percolation losses directly in the ground, so it was not considered. Therefore, in Figure 3.9b

the storage reaches its peak and remains constant, as for BIRENICE it is noted the decrease in

time and less important storage peak, once the percolation represents a water loss.

To value the behavior storm of the bioretention technique, the calculations of the

hydric concentration were done and the results were introduced in Table 3.4 . Note that both

BIRENICE and HEC show no outflow during the event. It could have occurred, for example,

that there was 100% of water retention efficiency for the simulated scenarios. You can also

note that for BIRENICE, despite having a peak of expressive flow, the runoff that enters the

technique fully percolates, helping to restore the water balance of pre-urbanization. The HEC,

in turn, does the forecast percolated volume. It is estimated that all the runoff is stored in

bioretention basin, leading to the storage’s highest peak.

Table 3.4 - Comparative water balance for both models

With this comparison, it is clear that the differences in simulations for both methods

are small, which corroborates for using the developed method (BIRENICE) for future

applications, since it is targeted to bioretention basin. However, the study recommends further

comparison of its simulation with data obtained by monitoring the practice in the field for

actual method confirmation.

3.4.3 Comparison between to the sizing methods described

The BIRENICE method was executed based on the effective precipitation difference

projected in a year and standing urbanization period for peak flow retention. The simulation

showed that the module design is efficient so that the entire volume of accumulated rain is

retained in a bioretention bowl. This result can be confirmed by the simulation performed on

HEC-HMS, confirming the applicability of the method.

It performed a comparative evaluation between the scaling performed by the

proposed method (BIRENICE) with the methods presented by Silveira &amp;amp; Goldenfun (2007),

Sizing by runoff retention by Akan &amp;amp; Houghtalen (2003) Sizing by pollutant charge retention

and (McAuley, 2009) Sizing by bioretention. The results are shown in Table 3.4, which are

matched dimensions and volumes obtained from each useful as a storage volume. It is

possible to observe the runoff sizing methods by the size and retention of the bioretention,

which resulted in volumes up to 500% higher than for BIRENICE, as pollution by the sizing

method resulted in retention volume close to that BIRENICE.

Table 3.5 - Comparative results of sizing methods (see equations and criteria in the text)

In Table 3.5, it is possible to analyze the calculated efficiencies presented for each

method, using the empirical data presented about the area and compare it with the BIRENICE

method. For Sizing method by runoff retention, it was reached an efficiency of 97% retention

of runoff volume. The Sizing methods by pollutant retention and Sizing charge by device

bioretention have an efficiency of 88% and 55% respectively. It is noteworthy that for these

two methods, the efficiency was considered only for parameter SS of solids.

Note that the useful volume calculated is quite different, which would entail the

construction of a system with different relations and dimensions. So, the research considered

the specific area to be built as well, proposing an easily applicable system, which does not

demand large investments in infrastructure and is easy to perform and understand. It was built

a system which has advantages regarding to the qualitative treatment, using a pre-treatment

primarily to retain sediment and solids. It is also considered a deeper system than the

conventional one, with a significant filter layer, which, consequently, increases the area

storage.

Despite the significant difference, simulations made by BIRENICE and HEC-HMS

showed that the dimensions obtained are able to retain all the flow. All in all, these other

methods have a greater number of variables and, sometimes, it is difficult to determine (such

as b the Akan method) the results, becoming complex to implement. The large volume

estimated by these methods also makes deployment costs higher.

Compensatory techniques are implemented and disseminated as part of public

policies in countries with financial constraints. Thus, it is necessary that its design method be

simpler to use and with lower deployment costs, especially when compared to conventional

systems. Considering this, the BIRENICE method, which uses the difference of effective

rainfall, meets these needs and limitations when compared to other methods, without losing

efficiency.

3.5 Conclusion

The objective of this research was to propose a design method for a bioretention cell

that addresses system sizing and uses a computational model to perform evaluation.  This

method is proposed as an alternative technology for improving the performance of urban

drainage systems. The case study was conducted in a drainage area located at Campus - Area

2 of USP São Carlos.

The bioretention cell designed for this basin was sized for a 5-year return period,

seeking to attenuate peak flow and to reduce runoff volume. A 20-minute rainfall was used in

BIRENICE method and the eventual bioretention cell was sized in a way that no overflows

would occur during the next 5 years. Device storage peak occurs shortly after the hydrograph

runoff peak and the structure emptying time is around 50 minutes for all scenarios. The

outflow passing through the spillway, in all cases, is null. It represents an output hydrograph

temporal rearrangement, because of the bioretention device. The comparison to the HEC-

HMS method was used to validate the results obtained by the computational model.

We conclude that:

? The sizing and simulation method proposed, BIRENICE, has little difference

with HEC-HMS results. Therefore, it is an efficient method and recommended for further

research of the presented topic.

? BIRENICE method allows planned sizing for future expansion, called modular

sizing. Thus, it also allows lower initial investment and appropriateness to the objective

dimensions.

? Inside its simulation, it is included storage decay, through percolation process.

? It is easy to use the model, which was designed to subtropical areas, but also

allows the user to customize the parameters for local needs.

Contribution drainage area and occupation scenario

The determination of the contribution area was based on topological map and on verification

in the field. For the area 4 (deployment of bioretention basin) the contribution of the total area

A = 23714m².

Soil properties

Soil types were divided into sealed area, APP (vegetation) and pasture, having respective CNs

91, 77 and 79.

In 2025, occupation was considered on campus 50%, with a total area of APP 0% and 50%

pasture. As the area has more than a group of land use and occupation, an average CN was

calculated according to Eq. 8.

Where: Ai corresponds to the area of i-th basin portion corresponding to CNi coefficient.

Then:

CN = (0,5*10337*91)+(0*10337*73)+(0,5*10337*79)/10337 = CN = 85

It was used as coefficients a, b, n and m to the equation proposed by Barbassa (1991), where a

To the time T rain, there were several rainfall intensity curves as a function of time t rain. The

return time was ranging from 2 to 10 years. It was found that for the 20 minutes before

beginning the curves almost coincide.

Rainfall intensity curves for return times of 2 to 10 years

Thus, adopting T = 5 years and t = 20 minutes, we have:

i = 1519*50,236 / (20 + 16)0,935 = i = 77.87mm/h

The precipitation was, then, calculated:

pre-urbanization and current blades, as Eq 16 and 17:

Where: n is media material porosity.

S = ((4,7mm – 1,35mm)/1000) . 23714 = S = 78,9m³

Adopting porosity of 34% (weighted average of sand and gravel), we have:

Vcell = 100 . 78,9/ 34 = Vcell = 232,9m³

Considering fixed depth of P = 3,2m and surface area of rectangular CT width L = 5,6m, we

have:

Vcell = P.L.C

Thus, length of C bioretention basin is equal to:

C = V/P.L = 232,9/3,2x5,6 = 12,99m; C = 13m

For the years 2015 and 2100, the same way calculations were made, considering the values of

the parameter for the respective years.

Simulations of input hydrograph, output, storage volume and infiltration were based on PULS

method and extensive calculations that have been developed in Excel spreadsheets.

Through the mosaic images, it is possible to view the progress of the construction of

bioretention system. The images show the evolution from the choice of the area, even with the

native vegetation, as well as the demarcation of the boundary, through all construction stages,

reaching the operation of the input spillway.

4. BIORETENTION AS A CONTROL TO URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEM WITH
AN ECOHYDROLOGICAL BASE: GIS AS A TOOL ON DECISION MAKING

Abstract

Ecohydrology indicators stand out as tools for analyzing the human connection with the
environment. Such indicators, together with cleared technology of Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) can assist in planning the sustainable use of urban areas susceptible to
flooding. In this regard, the present research demonstrates, using GIS tools, along with the
study of ecohydrology indicators a more precise analysis of likely areas to build bioretention
techniques. The study area is located in São Carlos- São Paulo – Brazil. It can be verified,
with the results of the comparison between the scaling method proposed, BIoREteNtIon CEll
method - BIRENICE, and the consolidated model, Hydrologic Engineering Center -
Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS), that the proposed method is, in fact, effective.
This affirmation is based upon the good results found in both parameters analysis, qualitative
and quantitative. Through GIS, it is possible to obtain further details of the concerning area,
considering the terrain peculiarities as waterproof cutouts, vegetated areas and the distance
from water bodies, favoring the magnitude analysis of the impact the bioretention
implementation technique considering a temporal evolution of the use and occupation of the
area between 2004 and 2014. The results of the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the
implemented system showed a considerable improvement in the analyzed parameters, thus,
contributing to the sustainability of the watershed. Through maps, it was possible to observe
changes in land use and occupation, identifying decreased features related to area
permeability. The image processing favored quantification. That, therefore, favored
calculation through a natural runoff coefficient method in conjunction with the rational
method. From the preparation of flow scenarios, it was possible to observe the extents of the
impact on the runoff, land use and occupation. It is concluded that this methodology is
efficient and can be considered as a support tool for watersheds management.

Keywords: GIS, bioretention, ecohydrology, urban drainage, land use.

4.1 Introduction

Since the 1960s, the urban drainage started to appear as a solution to public policies.

Considering this, master plans started to aim the development bases aligned with the

protection of the natural resources. The attention of researchers and technicians tended to

transcend the water courses to tackle problems from an external approach. This happened

mainly because of the development (Geldof, 1995; Pompeo, 2000).

Continuous urban development has resulted in a number of negative environmental

impacts. An example of impact this is the increase in impermeable areas (Hatt et al., 2004)

reflecting on the increase of surface runoff (Wenguer et al, 2009; Debusk, Hunt &amp;amp; Line, 2010)

and the carriage of pollutants to water bodies, compromising the natural ecosystems

(Cianfrini, Hession &amp;amp; Rizzo, 2006).



64

The increase in the use of impermeable surfaces that follows urban growth in recent

decades has raised the volume of drained rainwater and pollution that is carried from these

waters to the receiving water bodies. Therefore, the management of stormwater in urban areas

has become a priority for new planning projects and urban water managements (Lucke &amp;amp;

Nichols, 2015).

The bioretention techniques for urban drainage systems transpas the mitigation

potential impacts caused by urbanization, promoting the improvement of the water quality

stemmed from catchments (Barbosa et al., 2012), considering the different levels of

development of urban infrastructure. Therefore, these techniques can generate alternatives for

the management of water resources and environmental protection (Azami et al, 2015; Colson,

2015; Liu et al, 2015; Gessner et al, 2014; McCleary &amp;amp; Hassan., 2008).

Bioretention systems have been widely implemented in urban areas over the past

decade to manage stormwater, reducing peak flows and downstream pollution loads (Lucke &amp;amp;

Nichols, 2015). Part of the reason for the recent popularity of bioretention systems is the

flexibility of its design, that helps with its relatively simple integration in existing urban areas.

They are also considered supplement to a range of benefits, in addition to the conventional

functions of stormwater management, also including aesthetic and social benefits (Chahal et

al., 2016). Bioretention systems are generally systems based on plants and soil that typically

consists of a filter media (typically sand) and also comprises a drainage layer of gravel (Li &amp;amp;

Davis, 2016; Sample &amp;amp; Lucas, 2014). The systems can be assembled with any type of

geotextile to allow infiltration or include a waterproof lining to help capturing rainwater and

reuse it (FAWB, 2009). Bioretention systems treats stormwater through a range of physical,

chemical and biological processes. These include mechanical filtration, sedimentation,

adsorption, absorption plant and microbial (Mullane, et al., 2015).

Although promising, there are still some difficulties in the implementation of

bioretention techniques to consider. Some variables, such as: proximity to water bodies, built-

up areas and preservation areas, soil type, contribution points and climatic characteristics of

the region should be observed and studied thoroughly to meet the specific standards to

enhance the process’s efficiency. (Dokulil, 2015).

In parallel, the ecohydrology emerges as a tool that assists the understanding of

hydrological mechanisms (Zalewski, 2002) through ecological paths and processes and must

observe the dynamics of ecological systems, hydrology and types of land use and occupation

by establishing connections between them (Liu, 2011; Zalewski, 2000; Zalewski et al, 2016.).



65

Geoprocessing tools help in urban planning and managing areas in its several aspects,

allowing the interpretation of satellite and mapping of urban areas images, showing different

levels of details and spatial spectrum (Martin-Mikle et al., 2015).

In this perspective, the objective of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility of the

area to the implementation of compensatory techniques through ecohydrological and

geoprocessing base. The methodology addresses the observation of local characteristics, the

inflow of catchment area, building bioretention systems, water quality in the system and its

possible interference with the basin. In case of flood events, the assessment is technically

guided with the use of GIS to raise images and maps that describes pre-established situations

and future scenarios, determining the CN (Curve Number) average for sub-areas.

4.2 Methods

The data and information collection needed for this study involved the following

steps: (I) Identification of areas that are adversely affected by flooding events; (II) Defining

the time interval needed to assess growth and urbanization of the area from satellite images;

(III) construction of thematic maps from digital images to identify different situations using a

geoprocessing tool, so that the identified classes were represented spatially.

Five categories of classification related to land use were created: I) existing forest

cover; II) used area for reforestation for commercial purposes; III) area occupied by buildings;

IV) paved areas for people to transit; and V) areas with low vegetation and bare ground.

The treatment and digital processing were performed using ArcMap 9.1 software,

one component of ArcGis platform of ESRI. The GIS incorporated dataframe layers for

Permanent Preservation Areas (APP) and Legal Reserve Area (RL). The Hydro APP layers

were developed in consideration of a 50-meter distance from the source and a 30-meter

distance from draining areas. These distances follow the guidelines established on the new

Brazilian Forest Code (BRAZIL, 2012). A polynomial file was created and the types of land

cover were delimited (I to V described above). Through some image analysis of Google

Earth® from 2004 and 2010, a comparison can be made and, thus, assess the incremental

change year by year.

4.2.1 Study Area

The selected study area is located in the city of São Carlos in the State of São Paulo –

Brazil, and makes part of Mineirinho’s River Basin. The Mineirinho River supplies 40% of

the water demand of the city of São Carlos (Figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1 - Location map for the Mineirinho’s River basin inside São Carlos

Campus Area 2 of the University of São Paulo - USP - São Carlos has an area of

approximately 73 ha, which started to be developed during the late 90s. An additional 29.4 ha.

was added to create a total campus size of 102.4 ha., when the university officially opened on

April 11 th, 2005. Along side the construction of the university, legal reserves and APPs were

recovered. (BENINI, 2005; PUSP-SC, 2015).

Support surveys indicate that the current campus drainage system is insufficient, as

periodically several areas of the campus flood during year events. Eight critical areas with

inadequate drainage were identified. The implementation of Compensatory Techniques (CTs)

in these points can excel as a solution, being investigated in the present work.

The Mineirinho River did not receive a classification by appropriate agencies.

However, in consideration of its current conditions in accord with the method developed by

Zaffani (2013), Negrão (2015) and Aprígio (2012),  we considered that this river is a class 2.

According to the Resolution No. 357 of March 17th, 2005 of the Brasilian National

Environment Council - CONAMA, which established criteria for the classification of surface

2047 km



67

water bodies and environmental guidelines for its framework, as well as the conditions and

effluent discharge Standards, waters from Class 2 Rivers may be used for:

a) The supply for human consumption after conventional treatment;
b) The protection of aquatic communities;
c) The primary contact recreation such as swimming, water skiing and diving;
d) The irrigation of vegetables, fruit trees and parks, gardens, sports and leisure
fields, with which the public might have a direct contact with;
e) Aquaculture and fishing activity.

4.2.2 Runoff Calculation – CN Method

One of the simplest and most used methods to estimate runoff volume (effective

rainfall) resulting from a rainfall event is the method developed by the National Resources

Conservation Service of the U.S. (1972) (formerly Soil Conservation Service - SCS). In this

method, after determining the total drained volume, one must calculate the peak flow. The

Drainage City Manual of São Paulo (São Paulo, 2012) recommends the use of rational

method for basins with less than 3 km². As the application of bioretention catchments occurs

even in microdrainage level, the recommendations of the manual and the rational method for

calculating the drained peak flow were used. First, it was calculated from the total runoff

volume from the determination of effective precipitation, based on Eq. 4.1 and 4.2.

&gt;0.2 ? = ( ?0.2 )+0.8 ; ? 0.2 ? =0 Eq 4.1
= 25400?254 Eq 4.2

Where: P is the total precipitation in the área; Pe is the effective precipitation; S (mm) is the ground retention
potential, and CN is the coefficient nunber.

The CN value depicts the conditions and the soil coverage, varying from a very

permeable cover (lower limit value = 0) to a completely impervious cover (upper limit value

= 100). The values were tabulated and the hydrologic group of soil and its use and occupation

were used as input data. For cases that there are more than one group of soil or use and

occupation, the value of CN was obtained by Eq. 4.3.

=? ×? Eq 4.3
Where is the i-th portion of the basin which has the coefficient ; is the coefficient of the i-th portion
of the basin.



68

The drained peak flow was then calculated using the rational method. The

determination of runoff coefficient (C) results from the ratio between the total precipitation

volume and the total drained volume, i.e. the ratio between the precipitation and effective

precipitation, as shown in Eq. 4.4 (Kawatoko, 2012). This ratio represents the percentage of

generation of surface runoff for the contribution area of interest. From the C relating to the

contribution area and the intensity of rainfall, one can obtain the drained peak flow as Eq. 4.5.

= Eq 4.4= . . Eq 4.5
4.2.3 Water quality

Next, the improvement in runoff quality as a result of the bioretention system must

be estimated. Samples were collected upgradient of the bioretention system (Figure 4.2a),

within the bioretention –system, here called “storage” (Figure 4.2b) and downgradient of the

bioretention system  (Figure 4.2c). At the upgradient location, samples were collected every

five minutes by an autosampler in order to obtain the concentration on the washoff load

following the procedure of SILVA et al. (2009). For storage and downgradient locations,

samples were collected every 20 minutes throughout the rainfall event.

Figure 4.2 - Collecting point for water samples a) input; b) storage, and C) output.

The mass balance, in order to calculate the efficiency of the bioretention system, was

done through Eq. 4.6, adapted from Erickson et al. (2013).( )= ( + )?( ( )+ ( )) Eq. 4.6

1 km



69

Where: Ms(t) = Polutant’s mass stored inside the bioretention system; Min(t) = Inflow polutant’s mass trough
runoff; MP(t) = Inflow polutant’s mass trough precipitation; MI(t) = Polutant’s mass infiltrated/treated by the CT;
Mout(t) = CT’s Outflow polutant’s mass; t = interval time.

The studied water quality variables were chosen based upon references from the

basic literature. Some works, such as Barbassa (2011) and Vasconcelos (2008), featuring the

rainwater drained by a roof in the peripheral region of São Carlos and the main pollutants,

were the typical ones of organic contamination by nutrients and metals.

Currently, a great part of studies conducted in this area, analysed the CT’s effects on

metal treatment. (WANG et al., 2016; WANG et al., 2015; HATT et al., 2009). Therefore, in

order to compare the efficiency of the bioretention system in other places, iron – Fe, zinc –

Zn, lead - Pb, nickel - Ni, manganese - Mn copper - Cu, chromium - Cr and cadmium – Cd,

some parameters were selected as metal contamination of quality variables.

The mass balance’s time control and the period of collection of samples, to

determine the concentration, at points 1 and 5, are shown in Table 4.1.

Event 1 Event 2 Event 3

Time Control 0-123 minutes 0 - 136 minutes 0 - 593 minutes

Samples collected (inflow) 0 - 30 minutes 0 - 26 minutes 0 - 26 minutes

Samples collected (outflow) 1 sample at the minute 6 25 - 45 minutes 0 - 60 minutes

Table 4.1 - Time control and collection times of the events.

The time control, applied for this balance, was considered the same as the inflow

occurrence duration. However, this period is much longer than the time covered by the sample

collection, for the concentration measurements. To overcome this issue, the total inlet and

outlet masses, for the events 2 and 3, were calculated through the Event Mean Concentration

(EMC). The EMC is given by Eq. 4.7

= ? . .? = ? . .? Eq4. 7
Where the Ct and Qt are the analyzed concentration parameters and the flow rate, at time t, respectively, and
the interval of each sample collation.

In theory, the event load is calculated by Eq. 4.8, and can be simplified to Eq. 4.9:= . .? Eq 4.8= . Eq 4.9
Where Qm is the mean flow rate, C the concentration and tc the time control.



70

Three series of data were obtained from the bioretention system, placed in the

Mineirinho’s river watershed, for three rainy events, between the months of August and

September 2015.

4.3 Results and Discussion
4.3.1 Geoprocessing use

Using ArcMap 9.1 software we have developed maps for classification of land use

and occupation. For the construction of the maps, we considered images taken in 2004, 2010

and 2014 (Figure 4.3). This period was chosen due to the construction of the university’s

campus: this area passed through very significant changes in its land use and occupation.

Figure 4.3 - Use and Occupation – Mapping for 2004, 2010 e 2014.

In Figure 4.3, it is possible to identify features that indicate a decrease of the

permeable area, which may result in increased formation of sediment targeted to the water

body.

The mapping shows the permanence of underbrush and riparian vegetation at the

locations all over time, showing the preservation of these areas, despite moderate changes in

the region. So, the bioretention techniques to be adopted should primarily support the

preservation of these areas.

The identification of changes in the features on the maps as the borders of built-up

area and reforestation indicates changes in both the soil morphology and the areas of use,

which implies a decrease in soil permeability. These changes may also be associated with

climatic variations of the region. Gordon and Meentemeyer (2006) demonstrated, in their

study, the effects of urban drainage systems on the ground vegetation. The formation of



71

climatic cores in regions, where there are built-up areas facing ciliary forests, are common

and changes the local environment. Thus, the flow associated with soil disturbance causes

major impact on local environment.

The variables identified in the features of the maps strongly justify flood zones and

suggests that conventional drainage methods would not cause improvements in the region.

The patterns of the maps suggest that urban drainage techniques for bioretention should

consider the hydro-geomorphologic and ecohydrological processes and, also, the relationship

between discharge and sediment carried in their constructive step.

4.3.2 Use Quantification

Through the processing of the images, it was possible to identify and quantify the

types of soil use and occupation at campus 2 of USP São Carlos (Table 4.2).

Area (m²) 2004 (m2) 2010 (m2) 2014 (m2)
Built-up Area 2142 22584 36230
Paved area 36521 72916 111619
Forest cover 85156 179839 184368
Comercial Reforestation Area 36026 17924 4303
Bare or ground vegetation area 863886 730467 687210

Table 4.2 - Evolution of land use at Campus 2 - São Carlos (USP).

Based on the data presented in Table 4.2, it can be observed that there was an

increase in built-up and paved areas as well as forest coverage area over the years. It is

possible to infer that there was an increase in the sealed area within the campus from the

increase in paved and built-up areas, which changed from 3.78% to 14.44% of the total area

of the campus. The increase of built-up area reflected in increased soil sealing, raising the

water runoff. Therefore, there is greater amount of sediment taken at a higher speed to the

receiver body and it may increase its sedimentation level.

In 2014, the sealed area was around 14.44% of the total of Campus 2. It was also

identified that the area of legal reserve represents around 20.7% of the campus. According to

the Forest Code, the area required by law is 20%, leaving approximately 0.7% of the area

suitable for further construction of techniques that allows better water runoff such as

bioretention systems.

While Evaluating the results with previous research on the characterization of the

Mineirinho Stream Basin, in terms of use and occupation, it is clear that Campus 2 followed

the pattern of occupation of other areas of the basin, with an increase in impervious areas by

construction of paved roads and built-up areas. Benini (2005) reports that for the year of 1972



72

about 75% of the area comprised pastures and grasses, corresponding to the permeable areas,

while little more than 5% corresponded to impervious areas. In 2000 this scenario changed,

increasing to 35% of impervious areas, with areas of grass reduced to less than half of the

coverage. Remaining forest areas decreased from just over 10% to approximately 5%. Aprígio

(2012) reported that in 2012 about 45% of the area was built with 20% grasses.

The data obtained from the construction of maps for use and occupation land at

Campus 2 demonstrate that, despite following the trend of the surrounding region that also

comprises the Mineirinho Stream Basin, this site has a moderately accelerated growth,

increasing about 10%  the permeable areas corresponding to reduction in areas with ground

vegetation. This demonstrates the need for future planning.

Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 present data related to the historical evolution in terms of

areas of legal reserve (RL) and permanent preservation areas (APP), whose objectives are to

correlate with the patterns presented by photo-interpretation. In technical terms, there was no

change in the identification method with the respective collected data, indicating that the

patterns relate to the decrease in drainage area of the region that enables entrainment of solids

to the/a water body. Unlike the surrounding region (Benini, 2005; Aprígio, 2012), one can

note that for Campus 2, there was an increase over the years in the area of forest cover and the

APP and RL ground vegetation were entirely converted to forest vegetation. This behavior

demonstrates the university administration's concern with the improvement of environmental

quality and commitment to follow the law.

4.3.3 Calculation of runoff

The confirmation and quantification of an increase in the surface runoff were made

through the peak flow calculation using the method CN - SCS conjugate with the rational

method. To this end, it was adopted different CN values corresponding to every area of

different land use and occupation. The general CN value was calculated in accordance with



73

Eq. 3 and peak flow. For the runoff, it was calculated from Eq. 4.5. In this calculation, a

rainfall intensity of 91.7mm / hr was considered, calculated from rain time of 20 min (more

common for the city of São Carlos) and return period of 10 years, set from the Drainage

Manual and Stormwater Management recommendations (São Paulo, 2012) for microdrainage.

With these input values, the value of precipitation obtained was 30.6mm

From the CN distribution calculations and expert analysis, it was considered CN 77

for forest areas - forests in poor condition. The occupied areas were considered industrial

districts (72% waterproofing) with CN 91. For the pasture areas, CN 79 was adopted - pasture

in average conditions. For APP (Area of Permanent Protection), CN 73 was adopted - forest

in good condition.

To complement the analysis of the increase in runoff with increased urbanization, it

was also made a forecast for future scenarios of urban drainage condition in the Campus, in

view of the occupations provided by the Master Plan of the Campus Area 2 and the city of

São Carlos. Thus, the CN calculations and drained peak flow were made for the scenarios of

2025 (50% occupancy), 2050 (75% occupancy) and 2100 (85% occupancy) (Figure 4.4). For

these scenarios the same CN values determined previously were considered, with the

exception of APP areas, which was adopted CN 77, representing forests in poor condition.

FORECAST FOR OCCUPATION AREA

Figure 4.4 - Forecast for occupation of the area.

Table 4.5 shows the flow scenarios obtained for each of the eight catchments

(contribution areas) that cover the study area. The drained peak flow rates were calculated

based on the CN values for each contribution area varying according to the percentage of

occupation of the campus. The results presented illustrate how changes in the land use and

occupation affects indeed the runoff. It may be noted that between the years 2014 and 2025,

in which the Campus occupation would double its size, there is a percentage increase in

runoff ranging from 13% (basin 5) to 100% (basin 7). The maximum expected increase is

214% occurring in the basin 7 for the 2100 scenario, with higher occupancy rate.

Table 4.5 - CN Values for contribution areas.

The scenarios observed on the maps composition denote a significant increase of the

impermeable area through the classes that indicate constructed areas and by the objects that

indicate road expansion. Under these conditions, after local consultations, it can be noticed an

increase in volumes of water running into the river studied. Additionally, the hydrological

performance can also be compromised over time, because, besides the running, the cycle as a

whole is influenced by the permeability coefficients.

4.3.4 Bioretention based on ecohydrological principles

The dimensions of the bioretention system followed the criteria, general efficiencies

and joint performance and can be checked by comparing the qualitative and quantitative

efficiency. In this work, only the qualitative results will be shown, guided by ecohydrological

principles, as seen in Figure 4.5, which is illustrative and is not on scale. The diagram shows

the contribution areas of the studied catchment regarding the bioretention technique. The

influence zones that emerge from the urban growth in the region are also considered. The

Mineirinho River has dense riparian vegetation and small pockets of water along its route.

The contribution flow is basically from the campus drainage system and rainwater capture.

All these components are evaluated in correlation to the ecosystem interactions. Figure 4.6

shows the constructive parameters of implementation of bioretention project.

Modular Expansion



76

The proposed system allows this temporal evaluation for being modularly

dimensioned. It allows, without much effort, to expand its size over time. This issue has been

considered by the fact that the study area is recent and is in full expansion. It is known that the

more urbanized the space is, the more increased the runoff and, hence, larger the bioretention

system must be.

4.3.5 Water quality in Bioretention Systems

Some analysis of water quality were made at three points in this bioretention

experiment - inlet, storage and outlet - in order to characterize the pollution present in the

surface runoff and evaluate the efficiency of the technique in removing pollutants. Three

rainfall events were considered, in the months of August and September 2015. The Table 4.6

also shows, for means, characteristics of events.

The Table 4.7 shows the EMC obtained for the variables: Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni, Mn, Cu, Cr

and Cd, and shows, for means of comparison, the standards established for the effluent

released in a Class 2 river, which is Mineirinho’s class, according to Brazilian Federal

CONAMA 357/2005 resolution. It can be observed that the outlet EMC for Fe, Ni, Cu, and

Cd, at all three events, and for Pb, in events 2 and 3, presents higher values than the limits

established by the CONAMA. However, the total inlet and outlet mass of the parameters

should be analyzed to verify the bioretention efficiency and how this system reduces the

impact on the receiving water body.

The rainfall measurements were 6.0 mm in the first event, 3.0 mm in the second

event and 39.0 mm in the third event. The Figure 4.7 shows the accumulated and

instantaneous water depth, generated by these rainfalls, for each event. It can be observed the

infiltration depth in the bioretention, being the difference of the inlet and outlet the water

depth. In event one (1) the infiltration rate was approximately 34%, to event two (2) 41% and,

to event three (3), it was 64%. The dashed lines on the graphics delimit the sampling period.

Figure 4.7 - Accumulated and instant depth for events

The inlet and outlet mass of each parameter analyzed and the removal efficiency are

shown in Table 4.8. It shows the removal efficiency for the monitored events. It is possible to

notice, for most of the parameters analyzed, that the practice decreases the pollutants load,

that would have reached the water body, considerably. The chrome concentration measured

was insignificant and it is not shown in the table.



78

The metal removal efficiency varies from 40.3% to 97.8%. Lead was the parameter

with the higher removal rates (94.0% and 91.8% for the events 1 and 2). Iron had the worst

removal efficiency: 40.3% in event 1 and it had even, for event 3, a higher outlet mass than

inlet, resulting in a negative efficiency (-74.84 %). This can be explained due to the Brazilian

soil chemical composition. Due to the geological characteristics and its high weathering levels

in tropical regions, it is common to find high iron oxides in the soils like the one used to the

superficial and vegetated layer of the CT in which an erosion occurrence was observed during

the event 3. Besides the iron, all other metals, in event 3, had a lower removal efficiency when

compared to the events 1 and 2. The reason may also be related to the soil type in the study

area, latosol and erosion events.

Table 4.8 - Removal Efficiencies

To complement the results analysis, a review of the metal removal rates obtained by

other authors was performed. Wang et al. (2016) studied the Cd removal in several filtrating

materials and had over 95% of efficiency. Wang et al. (2015) also evaluated the Cu, Pb and

Cd removal by filtration of wastes from construction sites and obtained more than 90% of

efficiency. These values are much higher than those found in this study. However,  Wang et

al. (2016) and Wang et al. (2015) did these studies under a laboratorial scale with no

adversities faced in a field experiment. Hatt et al. (2009), otherwise, analysed the removal

efficiency of a bioretention system applied on the field and obtained an efficiency of 67% and

80% for Cu and Pb respectively. It is important to highlight, that the removal efficiency of a

bioretention system varies with its location, due to the different climate conditions and the

filtrating material characteristics, as the vegetated layer has a great influence on the runnoff

treatment.

Despite the Mineirinho’s River Basin be classified as a Class 2 ? under Brazilian

law, which allows for a more noble use of its waters such as supply for human use and



79

primary contact recreation, Aprígio (2012) found illegal contribution of domestic sewage in

regions on its head. This may contribute to a loss of environmental quality of the basin, an

increase of pollutant concentration in its water and risks to the surrounding population. Thus,

some actions to reduce the amount of pollution and consequent improvement in water quality

to match its intended uses are important for this region.

4.4 Conclusion

The method used for mapping land use and occupation allowed to check and

compare the increase in the urban area and its interference with the local environment. Hence,

the criteria to define the study area were satisfactory and provided a study model and

characterization of the area - more comprehensive and accurate to select sites for construction

of bioretention techniques - based on ecohydrological principles. The mapping of land use

and occupation groups simplifies the procedures for integrating information regarding the

priority areas for the construction of bioretention systems and the particular characteristics of

each region, providing the implementation of resource of georeferenced bases directed to

ecohydrological issues.

The comparative visual analysis allows an initial assessment, although more

superficial, on the quality of the method applied to determine the CN. It is clearly noticeable

that there are bigger CN values in more urbanized areas, where waterproofing percentage is

high, associated with soil conditions showing infiltration capacity below the average. The

regions of forests and fields are clear indicators of areas where there is less runoff (lower CN).

The increase in impermeable areas, even with a slow rate of advancement, increases

the quantities of sediments during periods of heavy rainfall, making a high input of sediments

in the receiving body, causing the increase of various parameters related to water quality and

peak flow. With the implementation of compensatory techniques, this problem is mitigated,

lowering the impact in water ecosystems downstream of bioretention technique.

The quality of the output effluent from the bioretention system confirms a significant

improvement in the analyzed parameters. It was possible to verify that there is a decrease in

the mass loading and, accordingly, improvement in water quality parameters, which

contributes to lower of pollutants and contaminants to the receiver. This feature reinforces the

capacity of treatment of bioretention technique.

Guided by our studies, we can say that applying this methodology to select areas to

implement bioretention system is efficient and proves, with the data presented, the reduction



80

of pollutant load directed to the river, being understood that the construction of bioretention

techniques, in addition make lower impacting to the river, brings benefits to it. This is

justified by the thematic maps, where one can see that there is considerable natural vegetation

covering the area, as well as areas that were reforested over time. As for the quality of the

output effluent from the bioretention system, it is possible to verify that there is a significant

improvement of the analyzed parameters.

The study clearly shows the importance of using a georeferencing tool for analysis of

areas, since it enables a rapid and consistent analysis of the study area. When correlation

occurs with ecohydrological indicators, the perception of the process efficiency supported

with physical elements becomes believable when it is noticed. An example is the investigation

of vegetal areas, that together with the results of qualitative parameters, demonstrate that the

implementation of a bioretention system attenuates the peak flow effects for a specific region.

Studies of this size can support a feasibility analysis and is more accurate in efficiency for

regions with different climatic and physical characteristics.

5. USING PCSWMM TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF A BRAZILIAN
MODULAR BIORETENTION DESIGN FOR STORMWATER TREATMENT

ABSTRACT

Bioretention is a low impact development (LID) practice that has emerged as one of the best
solutions for mitigating the impacts of urban development. Prior to characterizing future
implementation of these systems, it is necessary to fully evaluate the efficiency of the systems
already implemented. This work simulates future scenarios through quali-quantitative
monitoring of a bioretention modular experimental system, which can be expanded in order to
deal with an increase in output. After developing and calibrating the model, It was used to
simulate one recent (2015) and three future (2025, 2050 and 2100) scenarios, based on the
LID modular design proposed and on the changes in impervious area over the years. This
evaluation can be assisted by the use of a numerical model, in this case the Storm Water
Management Model (SWMM). This model   was used to characterize the hydrology and water
quality of an upstream subcatchment and downstream bioretention system in São Carlos,
Brazil. The chosen area has recurrent flooding and water runoff quality issues. The model
was calibrated with data from rainfall events that occurred on August and September 2015.
The 2015 scenario presented the highest quality and quantity efficiency, with an average of
90,9 and 91,2% respectively, and in 2025 with the same parameter, the lowest numbers with,
81,8 and 82,3%. As the results by simulations suggest, the modular sizing methods are
sufficient to maintain the performance until 2100, with a simulated quantity efficiency of 85,1
and 89,2% for quality efficiency. The study shows how modular bioretention is an efficiency
system for treat diffuse pollution in urban areas.

Keywords: urban drainage, stormwater, quali-quantitative efficiency, modelling.

5.1 Introduction

As the world’s population grows, urban areas have grown even faster. According to

the United Nations (2014), approximately 54% of the world population currently lives in

urban areas, which will likely rise to 66% by 2050. Urban development to accommodate this

population results in increased imperviousness, altering the natural hydrologic cycle by

reducing infiltration (Elliot &amp;amp; Trowsdale, 2007), depletion of evapotranspiration from

removal of vegetation (Smith &amp;amp; Banting, 2005), reduction of recharge and base flows because

of the paving of the surface (Loc eta l., 2015), and an increase in runoff volume and peak

flows (Lucas and Sample 2015). Due to the direct connection between urban impervious areas

and the drainage system, the increased frequency and magnitude of runoff is directly

conveyed to some receiving water bodies without attenuation, shortening, because of that, the

time period to the peak (Sabouri et al., 2013). In addition, pollutants are now washed off more

easily and quickly (Alberti et al., 2007). Streams degrade rapidly as they accommodate the



84

new flows and pollutant loads, causing a general decline in aquatic health (Kaushal &amp;amp; Belt,

2012).

These widespread impacts from urban development can be mitigated by Best

Management Practices - BMPs, that restore natural conditions by increasing infiltration,

reducing runoff and improving water quality in runoff (Tillinghast &amp;amp; Jennings, 2011;

Mangangka et al., 2014; LaBarre et al., 2015; Ghodsi et al., 2016). Houdeshel et al., 2015;

Ghodsi et al., 2016; Palanisamy &amp;amp; Chui, 2015; and Lim &amp;amp; Lu, 2016 suggest that runoff

should be viewed as a resource, transforming it from a waste product through reuse, thus

creating a more sustainable development practice. These mitigation techniques are

collectively known as Low Impact Development (LID). In addition to runoff reduction,

implementing LID may reduce flooding (Klenzendorf et al., 2015), conserve water supplies

(Pongmala et al., 2015) and reduce urban heat islands that are now becoming prevalent in

many cities (Loc et al., 2015).

Bioretention cells are shallow depressions filled with a filtration media and resistant

drought, but with a hydrophilic vegetation. Their main purpose is to reduce runoff volume

through infiltration into surrounding soils, attenuating peak flows through available storage

and improving discharge water quality through filtration (Smith &amp;amp; Banting, 2005; Liu et al.,

2012; Lucas &amp;amp; Sample, 2015). The extent of these benefits depends on some hydraulic and

hydrologic factors of the upstream subcatchment and bioretention design.

The urban center of São Carlos, (the location of this study), currently experiences a

higher flood frequency, due to urbanization and discontinuities in the drainage system.

Imperviousness in the city varies from 55% to 100%, with resulting curve numbers (CN) from

58 to 95 (Zaffani, 2012). The Mineirinho’s River, which accounts for 40% of supply from São

Carlos, experiencing significant flooding as well as poor water quality.

To explore the benefits of implementing LID practices to remediate drainage and

water quality issues in São Carlos, a bioretention system was installed in Campus 2 of

University São Paulo, in an area experiencing high runoff peak flows. In order to evaluate this

system, understanding the influence of the hydraulic and hydrological factors of the upstream

subcatchment and the bioretention cell on treatment performance is needed (Mangangka et al.,

2014; Sample et al., 2012). A computational model provides a tool to accomplish this goal,

because of its ability to generalize system behavior and explore variations in design and other

spatial and temporal factors (Smith &amp;amp; Banting, 2004; Sample &amp;amp; Liu, 2014). The North-

American EPA’s Storm Water Management Model or SWMM (Rossman, 2014) is a broad

computational model for water quality and quantity analysis of urban drainage (Loc et al.,



85

2015; Sample et al., 2012). This model was chosen for simulating the deployed bioretention

system and its upstream subcatchment due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, and its

explicit hydraulic simulation of channels and pipes (Talbot et al., 2016). SWMM simulates

rainfall-runoff response of a watershed, given precipitation and other meteorologial inputs and

predicts the quantity and quality of the runoff (Sovan et al., 2015; Smith &amp;amp; Banting, 2004).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of urban development in the

flow during storm events and verify the effectiveness of a bioretention project in particular,

and to generally assess LID application through computer modeling, evaluating interference

the bioretention technique on both the quality and quantity of the drained water.

5.2 Materials and Methods

5.2.1 Study area

The area of study comprises the campus 2 of University of São Paulo, in São Carlos,

Brazil, which is approximately 102,4 ha, and is located approximately 203 km in the central-

eastern region of São Paulo state. (Figure 5.1). About 30% of the area surrounding the campus

is classified as environmental protected area. The region is a tributary of the Mineirinho

River, whose length is approximately 4 km, surrounded by native vegetation, forest areas and

urban areas.

The region incorporates 86% of the permanent preservation area and 14% of the

protection area. Rapid growth of the campus has caused deficiencies in the drainage system,

resulting in floods and erosion of stream channels and streambanks. The subject bioretention

has a contributing drainage area of 2,3ha, and covers 63 m2.

Figure 5.1 - Location of the study area.

5.2.2 Used Data

The hydraulic components of the upstream subcatchment and bioretention system,

(e.g., Manning’s roughness coefficient, hydraulic width, slope, inverts, etc.) were estimated

according to a site survey and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of spatial data.

Hydro meteorological data included precipitation and temperature. Precipitation was

measured by two rain gauges on the campus. The data were verified for homogeneity using a

double mass verification method, which compared stations operated by the National Institute

of Meteorology (INMET) with those from the National Center for Monitoring and Warning

Natural Disasters (CEMADEN). Other meteorological data collected included wind,

atmospheric pressure and temperature from the Center of Weather Forecasting and Climate

Studies (CPTEC/INPE).

Water quality samples were taken based upon the methodology proposed by Macedo

et al. (2015). Sample were collected from fixed locations, and were made by an automatic

sampler at the entrance of the bioretention system and manually in all other points. Collected

samples were analyzed in a laboratory for nitrogen, in form of nitrate and nitrite, chemical

oxygen demand (COD), phosphate, iron, zinc, cadmium, lead and nickel using the analytical

method recommended by Standard Methods (APHA, 1999). Table 5.1 shows the collection

scheme performed for the qualitative data.

5.2.3 Hydrological model

A SWMM model was developed based on the drainage area characteristics, types of

soil, imperviousness, among other aspects. The USEPA Storm Water Management Model

(SWMM) is a computer program that computes dynamic rainfall-runoff for single event and

long-term (continuous or period-of-record) runoff quantity and quality from developed urban

and undeveloped or rural areas. The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of

subcatchment areas that receive precipitation and generate runoff and pollutant loads. The



87

routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff overland and underground through a system

of pipes, channels, storage and treatment devices, pumps and regulators. SWMM tracks the

quantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment and the flow rate, flow

depth and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised of

multiple time steps. The Figure 5.2 show a flowchart modeling with PCSWMM.

Figure 5.2 - Flowchart of the methodological steps of the research in PCSWMM.

A digital elevation model (DEM) was developed based on satellite image. DEM and

an aerial photography with 1 m and 0,2 m horizontal resolution, respectively, were used as a

data sources. Hydraulic features were confirmed through field inspection. Based on the

analysis of GIS data and aerial images, the surface was classified as either buildings (roof),

footpaths paved, roadway, parking lots and permeable areas.

Each of these areas was then analyzed for their hydraulic and hydrological

parameters. After manipulating the storage behavior, according to the rules defined by the

theories used in the model elaboration (James, 1985), the tool gives temporary results to be

reintroduced into the SWMM for hydraulic analysis. The areas were delineated into two

subcatchments, i.e., the bioretention area and its contributing drainage area, which was

determined to be 75% impervious by analysis of GIS data.

SWMM version 5.1.010 includes an LID computational model which simulates the

hydrological response of each practice as part of its respective subcatchment. SWMM allows

runoff to be routed from impervious to pervious areas, and takes the additional infiltration

into account. Within the bioretention submodel, a report provides key characteristics such as

water level, soil moisture, evaporation, infiltration, soil percolation, runoff and continuity

error of the bioretention system. The model scheme can be observed in Figure 5.3.

Figure 5.3 - Model building scheme based on real scenario data.

5.2.4 Model calibration and validation

Model calibration provides means of verifying the model with respect to observed

physical scenarios. Monitoring the discharge into and out of the bioretention and the water

quality for selective rain events was performed.  Calibration was done using a sensitivity

analysis by the Sensitivity-based Radio Tuning Calibration (SRTC) tool in PCSWMM

version 6.3 (CHI, 2007).

Water quantity calibration was performed using monitored events from August to

September, 2015. The parameters used for calibration were the contributing area, hydraulic

width, average slope and the imperviousness. These parameters were chosen based on the



89

sensitivity analysis known in literature (e.g. Dudula, J., &amp;amp; Randhir, T., 2016). The SRTC

allows the user to define the uncertainty associated with the parameters and to execute the

model multiple times within the uncertainty limits. Once completed, adjustments were made

to individual parameters manually without the pre-defined uncertainty intervals, using the

observed data and the model response. The model performance was evaluated by the Nash-

Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the correlation coefficient (R²).

Infiltration was compared to soil moisture sensor data, installed in the bioretention

cell. The Green-Ampt method was used to calculate infiltration within each time step. Soil

laboratory analysis indicated the local soils were a medium to fine sand to dark brown silt.

Parameters for this type of soil were taken from Rawls, W.J. et al., (1983), and can observed

the contribution area characteristics observed in Table 5.2 . These parameters values were

used for the calibration of the drainage area and for the bioretention system subcatchments,

for more details can be found in appendix c. Manning’s coefficient for the impermeable areas

was estimated as 0.06.

Water quality calibration used data obtained from storm event on August and

September, 2015. To find the wash off coefficients a plot of load (mg.s-1 ) versus flow (L.s-1)

was made for each parameter to be analyzed and then a power equation for the curve

adjustments were determined from least squares analysis, resulting in the wash off coefficient

(C1) and the wash off exponent (C2) to be used in the Rating Curve. Table 5.3 shows the C1

and C2 coefficients, and the R² for the adjustment of each parameter. The plotted graphs, for

each parameter, can be seen in the appendix. Fourteen points were considered to the entrance

regression and five to the outflow regression.

The wash off calibration is representative as indicated by the R², with the exception

of Fe. The low adjustment efficiency for iron can be explained by the erosion that occurred in

the area during the monitored events.

For the buildup calibration, the data acquired from event 1 was used, since it is the

only monitored event preceded by dry days (29 in total). The buildup EXP function was used

for this calibration, requiring two coefficients, C1 and C2, to be calculated. The C1, or

maximum accumulation constant, was calculated through the total income mass (kg), divided

by the contribution area (ha). The accumulation constant (C2) is the inverse of the number of

dry days. The C1 and C2 were used in the EXP function for Buildup and are shown in Table

5.4. The Buildup coefficients were adjusted according to the methodology proposed by

(Alvarez 2010, Zaffani, 2012) and are shown in Table5.4.

Table 5.4 - Values of calibration coefficients for pollution accumulation concentrations (Buildup)

Pollutant accumulation on urban impermeable surfaces, such as roads, sidewalks and

rooftops during dry periods is referred as build-up pollutant. The accumulated pollutants wash

off load varies according to the deposition rates, the duration of prior drought period and the

effects of redistribution over the drought of the previous period. However, due to different

results coming out of different investigation studies, researchers began to question the

relationship between pollutant accumulation versus deposition speed over the prior drought

period (Chiew et al, 1999). The influence of many other factors, such as land use, traffic



91

volume and weather, play different roles over the accumulation of different pollutants

(Egodawatta and Goonetilleke, 2006).

5.2.5 Future scenarios

Scenarios were created for the model runs, as the years 2015, 2025, 2050, and 2100,

considering the possible evolution of the population and land use within the area and the need

to augment the bioretention dimensions. The dimensions of the bioretention system and the

percentage of impermeable areas of each scenario are shown in Table 5.5.

These values were obtained using the sizing method and simulation developed by

Rosa et al. (submitted) and presented in Rosa et al. (2015) and Rosa et al. (2016). In this

methodology, the following parameters have to be considered for the calculation:

hydrological risk, rainfall intensity, contributing drainage area, soil properties, precipitation,

runoff coefficient, drained peak flow, stored volume, bioretention geometry, mass reduction,

inflows, spillway and infiltration outflows, pollution load, reductions in inflows and

discharges and PULS routing method. To facilitate design of a bioretention cell, a

computational model was developed to simulate and optimize its design, using unique

parameters to each cell given its specific location. A key feature of the method is that it

estimates the eventual size of the bioretention cell for multiple, cumulative scenarios. This

allows the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and iteratively simulate each bioretention

cell by steps, by setting the desired time intervals and the input parameters.

5.3 Results and discussion

5.3.1 PCSWMM Calibration and validation

The three rainfall events quantity calibration, by the SRTC tool, is provided in Figure

5.4. The three events were calibrated simultaneously, achieving a NSE of 0,64 and R² of 0,66

for the entrance, and a NSE of 0,79 and a R² of 0,83 for the exit. In general, NSE and R²

higher than 0,5 are considered satisfactory for model calibration (Moriasi et al., 2007). Based

upon these results, the calibration in PCSWMM, with the SRTC has shown to be reasonably

capable of predicting runoff within this study.

5.3.3 Quantitative efficiency

Table 5.7 provides inlet, outlet and the infiltrated runoff volumes for the years of

2015, 2025, 2050 and 2100. The simulation results indicated that the predicted runoff

reduction will reduce from present day to 2025. However, it will increase in the following

simulated years. Considering this, the planned adaptations in the bioretention, for the changes

in the contribution area, may be beneficial.

Table 5.7 - Input volumes, output, and infiltration to the simulated scenarios

The design and simulate a bioretention cell is proposed by Rosa et al. (submitted).

Thus, it was developed a computational model in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), the

model called BIRENICE (BIoREteNtIon CEll method). A key feature of the method is to

estimate the eventual size of the bioretention cell for multiple, cumulative scenarios. This

enables the designer to select a variety of trial sizes and iteratively simulate each bioretention

cells in steps, by setting the desired time intervals and the input parameters.

This proposed modular sizing aimed to keep the quantity efficiency constant through

the increase of the impervious area, due the occupation over the years. However, the SWMM

model differs from the BERENICE, which can alter the storage rate from the designed and the

difference in efficiency over the simulated years. In addition, the sizing for the proposed

efficiency was done for a rainfall intensity of 77,9 mm/h (a 20 min rainfall for 5 return years)

and the simulation covers different precipitations and, consequentially, different income

discharges. The 2015 scenario presents the highest quantity efficiency of 90,7% and the 2025,

the lowest with 81,4%. The efficiency is improved from 2025 to 2050 with 84,3% and

continues to raise to 2100, reaching 85,9%.

The accumulated volume at the entrance and at the exit of the bioretention system

was analyzed for each scenario. From January to April of the each scenario-year, totalizing 15

months, the historic precipitation from January 2015 to April 2016 was used (Figure 5.5).



94

Figure 5.5 - Accumulated volume for each scenario

The accumulated volume curve behavior (Figure 5.5) reacts as expected in the dry

and rainy period, with a more accentuated accumulation in the rainy months. However, for the

outlet, the accumulation tends to be more uniform during the year, which suggests that

bioretention provides some resilience in operating under the both weather conditions (dry or

rainy).

5.3.4 Qualitative efficiency

The pollutant removal efficiency is directly related to the percentage of the volume

of the water infiltration and exhibits similar behaviour with all constituents. It should be

emphasized that the analysis was made for the total amount of precipitated rain during the

day, not considering the rain duration, which can explain some differences in efficiency for

near precipitated volumes values.

For a better comprehension of the bioretention removal capacity, the average

removal efficiency of all pollutants was grouped into precipitation intervals in Figure 5.6,

considering the same number of days in each group. The days, with precipitations lower than

10mm, were not considered in Figure 5.6, since it is almost 100%.

Comparing the scenario of 2025 to 2100, the nearer and farther future scenarios, it is

possible to verify that the removal efficiency for smaller amounts of precipitation is greater



95

for future scenarios, thanks to a greater holding capacity resulting from the increase of the

total area of the technique. However, these scenarios efficiency tends to be lower with higher

precipitation volumes due to the fact that with a larger percentage of impervious area, higher

input flow rates compromise the ability to store larger percentages of input volume.

Figure 5.6 - Average removal efficiency by depth

It is possible to notice that the average bioretention removal efficiency for all

scenarios keep constant. With Minitab 17 software support was performed variance analysis,

the results are shown in Table 5.8. Using a significance (?) of 0,05 the p-value, that indicates

the probability of falsely reject the null hypothesis when it is true, can be lower than or equal

to significance level (?). The result obtained was p=0,106, providing evidences to conclude

that scenarios average efficiencies analyzed are equal.

To verify the information veracity the Tukey’s method was applied with a trust

interval of 95%. The method expresses that averages that does not shares the same letter are

significantly different. Through Table 5.9 it is assumed that all scenarios belong to group A,

in other words, the analyzed efficiencies for the scenarios are very similar between each other.

Through variance analysis and Tukey’s test, it is possible to conclude that beyond

performance.

efficiency, between 90,0% and 94,7%, dropping down on the 2025 scenario, varying from

81,3% to 86,5%. For the following year, the efficiency, in general, raised compared to 2025

between 84,3% to 87,5% in 2050 and 85,8 to 88,3% in 2100. The highest removal efficiency,

in all scenarios, was for iron, contradicting the efficiency, measured in the field, in which iron

presented the lowest efficiency of all parameters. That supported that the wash off quality

calibration for this parameter was failed. The parameters with the lowest removal efficiency,

however, varies according to the scenarios.

Table 5.10 - Removal efficiency in future scenarios

In order to compare the overall quality efficiencies between the scenarios, the average

for all simulated scenarios was done, shown in Figure 5.7.

It can be noticed that, from 2015 to 2025, the proposed modulation is not sufficient

to keep the same efficiency. The reason is the sudden growth of the impervious area, from

25% to 50%, and, consequently, the increase of water volume into the bioretention. In the

other scenarios, it can be noticed that the proposed modulation to the CT area increment will

be enough to improve the efficiency in the following scenario. Another factor that may



97

interfere with the desired efficiency is that the proposed modulation is not a linear growth that

accompanies the growth of the urban area.

Figure 5.7 - Average Efficiency for scenarios

Comparing the quality efficiency with the quantity, in Table 5.7, it is noticeable these

values proximity: 90,9 and 91,2% in 2015, 81,8 and 82,3% in 2025, 84,6 and 84,9% for 2050;

85,1 and 89,2% in 2100, for quantity and quality efficiencies respectively. This comparison

shows the importance of water retention for the pollutant removal rate and how the quality

efficiency depends on quantity efficiency.

A research indicates a relationship between the contribution area and the area of

bioretention system: WSUD Manual (MELBOURNEWATER, 2003) presented efficiency

fractions of pollutant removal for bioretention system with 2% of the catchment area reaching

up to 99 % efficiency. The system presented here has a unique design methodology, not

following the mentioned relationship, with approximately 0,3% of the drainage area.

However, it has different construction characteristics, as being deeper than the commonly

used with pre-treatment for solids removal and having an expansion of the modular system,

allowing the achievement of the presented efficiency.

5.4 Conclusions

This study showed that implementing LID practices such as bioretention can mitigate

the impacts of urban development, in terms of both runoff and pollution excess. Thereby, the

risk of flooding in urban watersheds is reduced.

Simulations were conducted in PCSWMM in order to evaluate the expected LID

practice performance over the incoming years. The quality calibration model was satisfactory,



98

indicated by high NSE and R² values, for both the subcatchment and the LID practice. The

quality calibration, however, was poor, due to the data limitation.

Simulated pollutant removal efficiency for all scenarios was high, reaching values

between 80% to 90%, with the 2015 scenario receiving the highest efficiencies. The positive

impact of increasing the size of the bioretention (on removal efficiency) appears to offset the

negative impact of increasing urban development. Thus, the model has been demonstrated as

an effective designing tool for evaluating the effects of LID implementation. The steps

described in this study can be customized and applied to similar LID practices in various

climate regimes to more generally evaluate the effectiveness of LID.

The modular sizing, as the simulation has shown, is effective in maintaining the

quality efficiency until 2100. However, the LID practice area, proposed for 2025, should be

reviewed by other methods, in order to improve the LID practice efficiency for the

corresponding year and land use characteristics and to prevent higher pollutants load to go to

the receiving water body.

Given the difficulty to determine the adjustment coefficients for the wash off and

build up steps, this article wanted to elucidate these steps in order to contribute to the protocol

of low-impact techniques modeling for urban drainage.

6. GENERAL CONCLUSION

The conclusion will be presented in the form of answers to the proposed objectives

and, subsequently, a section of recommendations for future works.

The research objective is to study the generalized efficiency of combined detention

and bioretention compensatory techniques to control diffuse pollution, with the introduction

of new experiments coupled to long-term adaptation strategies for qualitative and

quantitative urban drainage aspects based on ecohydrology.

On the one hand, this thesis suggests that compensatory techniques can be used not

only for evaluation of the impacts of diffuse pollution from urban drainage, but also as a way

of contributing to the sustainability of watersheds, favouring the maintenance of the

hydrological cycle, and, consequently, of the cycling of water bodies. On the other hand, the

thesis also presents theoretical, practical and model examples of how compensatory

techniques can also be approached as in-site, local long-term adaptation and mitigation

strategies for qualitative and quantitative risks linked to urban drainage. Thus, CTs, as

engineered devices under the concept of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems would hit

multi-purpose targets reaching out a great variety of stakeholders.

One specific objective is “To discuss the scope and limitations of sizing

methodologies and criteria and evaluate the efficiency of compensatory measures in the

control of urban drainage quantity and quality”. Across the Thesis is clearly depicted how

scopes and limits of the up-to-date sizing methodologies and criteria introduce a great range

of outputs. Contrasting methods of addressing CT’s efficiency changes alter projects, budgets

and people’s experience. Thus, different CT’s sizing criteria perform a real gap of knowledge

that: (1) directly impacts on the physical and cost of the nature of CTs, and (2) inherently

exerts and prioritizes bias on forthcoming plans of operation and maintenance during the CT’s

lifetime to maintain a minimum, but theoretical, efficiency.

The quali-quantitative efficiency of methods proposed in specialized literature were

compared with the model performance proposed in this Thesis, making this as innovative

research by presenting the modular sizing system and the future scenarios simulation to

improve the use of compensatory techniques on drainage management in urban scenarios.

Therefore, the Thesis assumes that this gap of knowledge must be analyzed with a

deeper discussion on the worldwide state-of-the-art nomenclature of terms, approaches,

techniques and research groups on SUDS. Then, the Thesis’ second chapter presents the

technique of bibliometrics, an innovative and multidisciplinary tool in the area of engineering,



107

for the survey of bibliographic data, construction of databases and guidance for research of

bioretention and CTs. Cognitive and relative maps of authors and techniques also show that

still: (1) neither complete standards, nor norms are completely gathered among worldwide

research groups, which have interesting high auto-citation or indexing, and (2) local scales,

contexts and knowledge are crucial factors affecting a priori the assumptions for whichever

sizing of CT`s and even global vision of SUDS.

The set of 22 themes presented in this research and related to SUD, involved

researchers from 82 countries, 2,027 research centers and 8,237 authors interacting through

11,857 citation relationships. In this domain, 72% of the relationships occurred between

authors from European and North American countries. The topics most widely used in the

academic community are Stormwater management, Low impact development, integrated

Urban water management, Bioretention and best management practice.

The second specific objective of this thesis is to evaluate the applicability of

ecohydrological indicators in the generalized evaluation of the efficiency of compensation

mechanisms for the quantity and quality of water.

Through the fourth chapter and, based on the legal framework and ecohydrological

indicators using geoprocessing tools, it was possible to evaluate proper areas to implement the

bioretention techniques, evaluating the impacts of urban growth through maps of land use and

occupation. It also helped to choose the area for the constructions of the bioretention system.

After the construction of the system, it is proven by the results of quali-quantitative limits that

the system can corroborate (help) with the sustainability of Mineirinho’s river basin.  Besides

that, the construction of compensatory techniques to treat diffuse pollution provided with

drainage systems which are planned considering ecohydrology indicators, is also revealed as a

promising mechanism for maintaining urban watersheds.

As the third specific objective, which is to study experimentally, in the micro

drainage pilot devices, the detention effects combined with bioretention, including design,

sizing, installation, monitoring, modeling and efficiency analysis during the lifetime of the

devices.

One of the greatest challenges faced when coming to CT’s is the integration between

runoff quantitative, qualitative performance and sizing methodology. This Thesis presents on

its third chapter a sizing methodology for bioretention systems, called BIRENICE and its

performance compared with HEC -HMS model.

It is proved, by the results found in the comparison between the sizing method of

bioretention proposed systems, BIRENICE and HEC-HMS that the proposed method is



108

efficient, based on the presented results of the quali-quantitative parameters. It is innovative,

because it is planned and executed considering the modulation by predicting the growth and

development of the areas in question and, through the simulation of dimensioning, the

extension of the proposed systems, making it applicable to the conditions of urban drainage,

which can be adapted to other realities.

The last specific objective is simulating long-term adaptation scenarios to compare

the effects of combined detention and bioretention devices of macro-drainage on the selected

critical watersheds.

In this step of the research (the fifth chapter), the focus is to evaluate the

performance of a bioretention system and to simulate long-term scenarios using a PCSWMM

model. The simulation model PCSWMM has a quick and concise manner of using its

interface, allowing the user to have instant access to calibration components of the SWMM 5,

providing an effective calibration for the aspects used in the preparation of future scenarios.

Through the fifth chapter, it is possible to conclude, that the employment of PCSWMM tool

for simulation of future scenarios is efficient for any proposed adjustments in CT, considering

the changes in land use and occupation for future scenarios. The PCSWMM stands out as an

important model for simulation and a tool for managing water resources for decision

making. Comparing the results of quality and quantity efficiency, it can be noticed that even

though there is an efficiency variation between scenarios, it remained satisfactory, between

81,8% and 91,2% in the simulated scenarios.

By the experience obtained with this research together with the experimental results

found by monitoring of compensatory techniques, it was possible to evaluate the control of

diffuse pollution parameters in micro drainage and its computational modelling of quali-

quantitative aspects, which were considered in this study. However, it is noted that there are

still some gaps while inserting these types of technologies: (I) methods for generalized

dimensioning; (II) lack of experimental data; (III) needs maintenance and enhancement of

meteorological monitoring network; (IV) bureaucratic matters, involving the construction of

the experiment in the Brazilian territory.

Through experience, it is possible to conclude that compensatory techniques of

bioretention are promising alternatives to corroborate witch the water resources management,

mainly in relation to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of water from the diffuse

pollution of urban drainage caused by floods in urban centers.
