ABSTRACT

The Alcântara Formation, an important stratigraphic unit from the early Cenomanian of Brazil, was deposited under

transitional (estuarine) conditions, and its fossil record includes fragmentary remains of plants, fishes, crocodylomorphs,

pterosaurs and dinosaurs, with a noteworthy diversity of dipnoiformes tooth plates. The dipnoiformes material reported

here comprises a new taxon, Equinoxiodus alcantarensis, gen. et sp. nov. Most of the identified morphotypes of

continental vertebrates collected in the Alcântara Formation are similar to chronocorrelative faunas from Northern

Africa, but this new genus of Dipnoiformes indicates some degree of paleogeographic isolation and endemism. This

was probably caused by the widening of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean during the early Cenomanian, which may have

selectively affected some species.

Key words: Dipnoiformes, neoceratodontids, Equinoxiodus alcantarensis gen. et sp. nov., Cretaceous.

INTRODUCTION

In 1994, a multiple layered bone-bed within iron-oxide

cemented conglomeratic layers, alternating with sand-

stone levels, was discovered on the eastern side of

the Cajual Island (2?28?53, 4??S and 44?27?41, 3??W) in

northern Maranhão State, northeastern Brazil (Corrêa-

Martins 1997). Measuring about four hectares in area,

the bone-bed is exposed on a muddy beach, at low tide

twice a day. The tidal range exceeds six meters causing

the beach to be frequently swept by waves that expose

and free up the fossils from the rock matrix. Tradition-

ally deposits in this region were considered as belonging

to the São Luís Basin. However, a stratigraphic revision

undertaken by Góes and Rossetti (2001) demonstrated

instead its continuity southward with sedimentary se-

quences of the Grajaú Basin (= northern Parnaíba Basin

sensu other authors), which led them to conclude that

the two basins are in fact one, now so-called São Luís-

Grajaú Basin (Fig. 1).

The bone-bed (Fig. 2), named Laje do Coringa

(Corrêa-Martins 1997), is a sequence within the Alcân-

tara Formation (Itapecuru Group) located on the eastern

beach of the Cajual Island. It is unique in Brazil because

it crops out in a very restricted area exposed only dur-

ing the low tide that has yielded thousands of bones, teeth

and petrified plants as conifers and ferns. During the past

16 years, an impressive number of specimens has been

collected and studied, revealing a noteworthy continen-

tal palaeobiota that includes fishes, crocodylomorphs,

pterosaurs and dinosaurs. There is a remarkable num-

ber and diversity of dipnoiformes tooth plates, as well as

some marine fishes and reptiles (Medeiros and Schultz

2001, 2002, 2004, Vilas Bôas and Carvalho 2001, Cas-

tro et al. 2004, Medeiros et al. 2007, Elias et al. 2007,

Pereira and Medeiros 2008, Kellner et al. 2009). The

fossilization was mostly by permineralization of bones,

teeth and tooth plates by iron oxides. This permineral-

ization took place concomitantly with the lithification of

the conglomerate, which was the result of iron oxides de-

position (mainly goethite). Trunks of conifers and ferns

were distinctly fossilized by a combination of silica and

iron oxides and probably have a more complex tapho-

nomic history.

The Itapecuru Group extends over the northern

Maranhão State, covering an extensive area inland and

along the shore. Albian and early Cenomanian deposits

are well represented in this sedimentary sequence (Pe-

drão et al. 1993a, b, c). Numerous continental fossils

have been recovered yielding much information about

the northern South American environments, climate and

faunas, while the western Gondwana was breaking apart.

Laje do Coringa is thus far the richest fossiliferous site

of the Itapecuru Group. It is formed by a few conglom-

eratic lenses, each one varying in thickness from less

than one inch to about 15 cm, intercalated by stratified

sandstones. Holz (2003) considered the conglomerates

as lags assembling continental fossil material reworked

and re-deposited in marine sediments during a transgres-

sive episode.

Regarding lungfishes, a noteworthy diversity of

tooth plates has been collected and, thus far, some

have been identified: Ceratodus africanus (or Ceratodus

braziliensis sensu Cunha and Ferreira 1980), Asiatoce-

ratodus tiguidiensis, and Ceratodus humei (Medeiros

and Schultz 2001, 2002, Castro et al. 2004, Toledo et al.

2005). The present work deals with the morphological

description and taxonomy of some tooth plates recov-

ered from the Laje do Coringa, which are considered to

represent a new genus and species of lung fishes.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The richness of fossil deposits from the northern part of

São Luis-Grajaú Basin is a consequence of the rapid sub-

sidence of this region, which is situated on the Brazilian

equatorial margin. The region was directly affected by

rifting, which created a tectonic depression that was filled

out by sediments of the Itapecuru Group. This group lies

above Aptian strata of the Codó Formation. The Creta-

ceous sedimentary sequence of São Luís-Grajaú Basin

records the South American-African breakup (Aranha et

al. 1990, Góes and Feijó 1994, Góes and Rossetti 2001,

Rossetti 2001). The upper sequences are divided into

two transitional units: the Alcântara and Cujupe for-

mations. The Alcântara Formation contains sequences

that have been interpreted as an incised valley fill, which

were deposited under a tide-dominated palaeoenviron-

ment (Rossetti and Truckenbrodt 1997). This unit exten-

sively outcrops in the coastal cliffs in São Marcos Bay,

in the Alcântara City region (Fig. 2).

DATING

The palynological analysis of sediments in the coast of

the São Luis Island indicates the early Cenomanian age

in the outcropping Cretaceous sediments (Pedrão et al.

1993c). Klein and Ferreira (1979) also attributed a Ceno-

manian age to these deposits, based on bivalves from an

estuarine facies. In fact, subsidence was more intense

along the shore line in the early Cenomanian, resulting

in faster and more massive accumulation of sediments in

that region compared with deposition rates further inland

(see revision in Rossetti et al. 2001).

ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE

The palynological evidence for an arid tropical climate

throughout the early Albian to early Cenomanian is pro-

vided by Pedrão et al. (1993a, b, c) and Rossetti and

Toledo (1996), who studied sedimentary features in out-

crops of the Alcântara Formation. This interpretation

is reinforced by the study performed by Amiot et al.

(2010) on Cretaceous material from Brazil and North

Africa, which also evidences higher surface tempera-

tures than present-day arid to semi-arid environments

under tropical and equatorial climates. However, the

record of conifer woods and giant ferns suggests the

presence of forests, and fishes such as Mawsonia and

Lepidotes give evidence of a substantial body of wa-

ter in this region. Mawsonia could grow to a length of

more than 3.5 meters, as evidenced by isolated bones

from Laje do Coringa (to be published). Lepidotes would

also require a considerable body of water to survive

judging by the size of the scales found in the deposits.

On the other hand, the dinosaurian fauna, which in-

cludes very large animals like the titanosaurs and

rebbachisaurids, had to be supported by rich vegetation

nearby. Rich vegetation would obviously require a rela-

tive high degree of humidity. In order to reconcile both

aridity and humidity indicators in the same sedimentary

sequence, the environment was interpreted as a conifer

forest that would have been confined to the vicinity of

fluvial canals and surrounded by an arid to semi-arid

landscape (Medeiros and Schultz 2002).

ASSOCIATED PALEOFAUNA

Although very fragmentary, fossils of Laje do Coringa

are remarkably numerous. Teeth of some pterosaurs

and dinosaurs can be found in their hundreds, while fish

material like teeth and scales are counted in thousands.

Dinosaurian vertebral centra are also a common item.

Among sauropods, titanosaurids and a rebbachisaurid

are present (Medeiros and Schultz 2002, 2004, Medei-

ros et al. 2007). Theropods are mainly identified on

the basis of teeth, but some vertebral centra are also

considered. Carcharodontosaurus is obviously present

because its teeth are clearly diagnostic (Vilas Bôas et

al. 1999). Spinosaurids are also listed, possibly rep-

resented by Spinosaurus itself (Medeiros and Schultz

2001, 2002). It is important to note that the fish and

tetrapod taxa identified from Laje do Coringa repres-

ent a fauna similar to that from Albian and Cenoma-

nian deposits in northern Africa (Medeiros and Schultz

2001, 2002). Many of the identified taxa from the Al-

cântara Formation are also recorded in that region of the

African continent (e.g. Stromer 1915, 1931, 1934, Lap-

parent 1960, Tabaste 1963, Sereno et al. 1996, Russell

1996, Benton et al. 2000). The fish record is outstand-

ing. Besides Dipnoiformes, the following genera have

been identified: Lepidotes, Mawsonia, Bartschichthys,

Stephanodus, Onchopristis and Atlanticopristis, along

with pycnodontids and hybodontid sharks (Medeiros

and Schultz 2001, Medeiros et al. 2007, Pereira and

Medeiros 2008).

MESOZOIC DIPNOIFORMES FROM SOUTH AMERICA

AND AFRICA

Ceratodus iheringi, based on a single tooth plate from

the Upper Cretaceous (Senonian) of Patagonia (Ame-

ghino 1899, 1906), was the first record of Mesozoic

Dipnoiformes in South America. To date, the record of

Ceratodontiformes in Argentina ranges from late Ceno-

manian to late Campanian (Apesteguía et al. 2007).

The oldest Mesozoic record in the South American

continent is a single late Triassic dental plate identi-

fied as Ptychoceratodus cf. philippsi reported from the

Santa Maria Formation (Richter and Toledo 2008). Fur-

ther occurrences indicated the wide geographical range

achieved by these fishes in western Gondwana during

the Mesozoic, mainly in the Cretaceous. Dipnoiformes

are represented by morphotypes referred to Cerato-

dontidae, Neoceratodontidae, Asiatoceratodontidae and

Lepidosirenidae (Pascual and Bondesio 1976, Cunha and

Ferreira 1980, Gayet and Brito 1989, Schultze 1991,

Bertini et al. 1993, Silva and Azevedo 1996, Dutra

and Malabarba 2001, Medeiros and Schultz 2001, 2002,

Castro et al. 2004, Toledo et al. 2005, Apesteguía et al.

2007, Soto and Perea 2010). Neoceratodus would have

had a widespread distribution on Gondwana in the Early

Cretaceous, indicating an ancient origin to the group

(Cavin et al. 2007).

In Africa, Mesozoic Dipnoiformes are represented

by the same families. They are commonly found in the

northern part of the continent (Peyer 1924, Tabaste 1963,

Martin 1979, 1981, 1984a, b, Churcher 1999, Churcher

and De Iullis 2001), where Cretaceous deposits are well

represented.

Tabaste (1963) reported seven species from the

Mesozoic deposits of the Sahara: Ceratodus africanus,

C. humei, C. tuberculatus, C. pectinatus, C. tiguidiensis,

C. protopteroides and Ceratodus sp. Some species

were posteriorly revised by Martin (1984a), who rein-

terpreted C. tiguidiensis as Arganodus tiguidiensis, C.

africanus as Neoceratodus africanus, C. tuberculatus as

N. tuberculatus, and considered C. pectinatus as syn-

onymous with N. africanus. He also reassigned C.

humei to Protopterus humei (Martin 1984b). Arganodus

tiguidiensis was posteriorly reassigned by Kemp (1998)

to the genus Asiatoceratodus. Churcher and De Iullis

(2001) retained C. humei’s original assignment and re-

ported the presence of the lepidosirenid Protopterus

crasidens from the Cretaceous of Egypt. Churcher et

al. (2006) erected the genus Retodus to accommodate

specimens formerly referred to Ceratodus (or Neocera-

todus) tuberculatus, and made reference to C. africanus

as a valid taxon.

This instability of assignments is due to the dif-

ficulty in determining the taxonomic validity of many

features and the extensive variation of some of them,

as repeatedly stressed in the literature. Thus, the pres-

ence of the genera Ceratodus and Neoceratodus in the

Cretaceous of Africa and South America depends on the

authors’ interpretation.

A NEW GENUS OF DIPNOIFORMES FROM BRAZIL 1185

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The tooth plates were either found lying around free

from the host rock thanks to the erosive action of the

sea waves or were collected by using traditional tools to

release the specimens from the conglomerate. The ma-

terial was analyzed in the laboratory of UNESP, in the

city of Rio Claro.

The material collected at the Laje do Coringa fos-

siliferous site, Cajual Island, northern Maranhão State,

northeastern Brazil (Figs. 1 and 2), comprises a series

of 10 dipnoiformes isolated tooth plates with no sup-

porting bones preserved. The specimens are deposited in

the fossil collection of the Universidade Federal do

Maranhão (UFMA), in the city of São Luis, Brazil.

RESULTS

The morphological analysis has shown that the speci-

mens were representative of a genus of lungfishes that

had already been recorded in the Paleocene of Bolivia

(Schultze 1991), but was not named thus far. In the

present work, we erect a new species and a new genus to

accommodate this form of Dipnoiformes.

GENERIC DIAGNOSIS as for type species

Equinoxiodus alcantarensis sp. nov. (Figs. 3, 4)

Flat plates without definable ridges and with

slightly undulating occlusal surface. Four to five scarcely

defined rounded indentations, drawing a wavy profile

along the lateral margin in occlusal view. The ornamen-

tation is an extensive network of reticulated fine lines

formed by petrodentine, which extends from the labial

to the lingual margin.

MATERIAL

Holotype: UFMA 1.40.086. Paratypes: one complete
tooth plate (UFMA 1.40.060) and eight incomplete
tooth plates (UFMA 1.40.042, UFMA 1.40.043, UFMA
1.40.062, UFMA 1.40.079, UFMA 1.40.087, UFMA
1.40.374, UFMA 1.40.465, UFMA 1.40.489).

Referred material: Schultze, H.-P. 1991: left preartic-
ular tooth plate (Fig. 1), Left pterygoid tooth plate (Fig.
2) and right prearticular tooth plate (Fig. 3).

DESCRIPTION

The following descriptions mostly use, although not ex-
clusively, the terminology revised by Churcher and De
Iullis (2001).

Holotype: UFMA 1.40.086 (Fig. 3A) is a complete,
elongated, thin and almost flat tooth plate, measuring
82 mm in length and a maximum of 29 mm in width
from the labial to the lingual margin, including the den-
ticulations. It has no distinguishable crests or ridges,
and the denticulations form a sinuous profile in occlusal
view. The lateral margin exhibits posteriorly a curved
contour, which meets the posterior limit of the lingual
margin without abrupt angle. The denticulations follow
a wavy pattern in lateral view. A complex network of
anastomosed fine costae of petrodentine (“fine ridges”
in the terminology of Schultze 1991) covers the entire
crushing surface; most of them cross the plate labially-
lingually, forming a network (Figs. 3A, 4C). These or-
namental costae are also seen on the lingual margin. The
punctuations are extensive over the entire surface, oc-
curring on and between the costae. The lingual face ex-
hibits a sulcus, which extends antero-posteriorly along
most of its length.

Paratypes: UFMA 1.40.060 is a complete specimen
(Fig. 3B), measuring 63 mm in lenght and 22 mm in
width, showing a concave mesial face on its oral margin.
The lingual edge is progressively thicker anteriorly.

UFMA 1.40.465 is an incomplete specimen, 61 mm
long (Fig. 3G). The oral margin of the mesial face is
concave, becoming substantially thick aborally. In the
position of the mesiointernal angle there is a peak
shaped projection, directed almost perpendicularly in
relation to the occlusal plan (Fig. 4B).

A NEW GENUS OF DIPNOIFORMES FROM BRAZIL 1187

UFMA 1.40.079 (Fig. 3C), although incomplete,
is the only specimen that bears five indentations. It is
65 mm in length and 26 mm in width.

Considering the whole type series, the outline of
the plates is reminiscent of Archaeoceratodus djelleh
(Kemp 1982, 1997), but the number and morphology of
ridges and denticulations are different. The lateral den-
ticulations in our sample are badly defined. The straight
lingual margin curves slightly to the posterior extreme
of the plate. The slightly undulating occlusal surface,
as shown in Figure 4A (UFMA 1.40.489), seems to be
original or caused by feeding habit; it is not the result
of diagenetic deformation. The network formed by fine
lines of petrodentine (Figs. 4C, D) is a feature that distin-
guishes these plates from all other previously described
dipnoans from the Alcântara Formation.

The tooth plates underwent a significant post-
mortem abrasion. Nine of the specimens did not keep
any attached bone; the exception is UFMA 1.40.087,
a distal half of a plate (Fig. 3J), which exhibits a very
small, abraded and unidentifiable bone fragment. So,
we prefer not to speculate about the original position
of the plates.

LOCALITY AND HORIZON

Laje do Coringa site, Cajual Island (2?28?53.42??S;
44?27?41.32??W), Municipality of Alcântara, northern
Maranhão State, northeastern Brazil. Itapecuru Group,
Alcântara Formation, early Cenomanian, Late Creta-
ceous.

ETHYMOLOGY

“Equinoxi” as a reference to the France Equinoxialis,
the name given to the northern Maranhão state in 1612;
“odus” from the latinised Greek word for tooth; “al-
cantarensis” in reference to Alcântara, the town where
the type material was collected.

DISCUSSION

Equinoxiodus alcantarensis gen. et sp. nov. shows par-
allel pulpar canals similar to those in the families Cera-
todontidae and Neoceratodontidae (see Smith 1984), as
well as petrodentine and circumpulpar dentine.

The petrodentine is translucent under polarized
light and shows lower birefringence with colors of first

order from grey to pale yellow, weak pleochroism and
texture fibers that grows from the pulpar canal, paral-
lel extinction and negative elongation. The size of the
chrystalites in the petrodentine is around 0.2 mm, and
the diameter of the pulpar canals varies from 0.04 to
0.08 mm. The pulpar canals are filled by hematite and
goethite.

The circumpulpar dentine shows weak birefrin-
gence, which is lower than that of the petrodentine with
first order color from gray to light gray, sometimes pale
yellow. The dentine grows concentrically around the
pulpar canal and shows a granular texture. Locally, the
dentine shows high cristalinity and higher relief that
corresponds to higher birefringence.

The dentine tubules are 0.075 mm long, and their
width range from 0.04 to 0.1 mm.

The tooth plates of Equinoxiodus gen. nov. do not
exhibit diagnostic features to conclusively allocate it in
any known family of dipnoans. It is tentatively assigned
to the Family Neoceratodontidae based on (a) the par-
allel pulpar canals (Fig. 5), (b) the presence of petro-
dentine (Figs. 4D and 5) and (c) its elongated profile,
similar to Archaeoceratodus, in spite of the difference
in the number of denticulations.

The complex ornamentation seen on the crushing
surface of this new species and genus is similar to the
specimen described by Schultze (1991) from the Santa
Lucia Formation, Paleocene of Bolivia. Schultze (op.
cit.) considered the protuding “fine ridges” observed on
the specimens as a major distinctive feature, proposing
that the material should be allocated into a new genus,
although he did not name it.

Here we ascribe the Santa Lucia Formation tooth
plates to the genus Equinoxiodus gen. nov. Therefore,
the temporal range of this genus spans from early Ceno-
manian to early Paleocene.

Considering that South America and Africa were
connected until late Albian (Reyment and Dingle 1987,
Koutsoukos et al. 1991), it is not unexpected that the
paleocommunities recorded in northeastern Brazil, and
all along northern Sahara, are somehow similar as evid-
enced by the Alcântara Formation record (Medeiros
and Schultz 2001, 2002). The early Cenomanian con-
tinental Moroccan fish fauna of Kem Kem has been con-
sidered as similar to the South American record (Cavin
and Dutheil 1999; see also Cavin et al. 2010).

chamber to the tritural surface. A) ordinary light. B) polarized light.

Regarding dipnoiformes, Schultze (1991) con-
sidered ceratodontids euryhaline, justifying the occur-
rence of the group on both sides of the equatorial South
Atlantic Ocean. The new species described in the pres-
ent work, considered as neoceratodontid, is not recorded
in Africa. Therefore, one can speculate that either the
species was not able to tolerate saline conditions, which
would be an impediment to crossing even the narrow
South Atlantic Ocean, or other barriers to its disper-
sal, not registered in the geologic record, were in opera-
tion to prevent it reaching Africa. Maisey (2000) stated
that tectonic events involved in the opening of the
equatorial Atlantic Ocean also provided opportunities
for local vicariance even before the seaway develop-
ment. This could also be a reasonable explanation to the
rising of the endemic fish taxon described here. In any
case, this new record provides evidence that an effec-
tive isolation factor affecting at least some species was
present by the early Cenomanian. Even in the event of
a purported persistent transoceanic connection between
South America and Africa through a narrow and shal-
low ocean (Cox 1980, Rage 1988, Buffetaut and Rage
1993, Sereno et al. 2004), this would still probably rep-
resent a selective barrier for certain species.

CONCLUSIONS

Although the similarities observed in the recorded trans-
atlantic faunal elements are obviously resultant of the
major vicariant event that separated Gondwanan land-
masses, the presence of dinosaur genera common to the
continents of either side of the Atlantic Ocean in the
Cenomanian reinforces the idea that South American
and African populations would have maintained inter-
changes until the end of the Early Cretaceous or even
until the Cenomanian (Medeiros and Schultz 2002, see
Sereno et al. 2004). However, the fossil record from
the Laje do Coringa bone-bed in Brazil also includes
apparently endemic taxa like the new dipnoiformes de-
scribed here, namely Equinoxiodus alcantarensis gen.
et sp. nov. This suggests some degree of isolation
involving South American and African paleofaunas by
the early Cenomanian. These two apparently conflicting
pieces of evidences can be reconciled by assuming a se-
lective transatlantic connection and an effective isolation
for some taxa not able to cross the marine barrier.

Ceratodontids were considered to be euryaline
(Schultze 1991), and able to cross the equatorial South
Atlantic Ocean, but different species of continental wa-

ter fishes, including dipnoans, may have had different
degrees of response to the isolation by a narrow ma-
rine environment, as possibly also terrestrial vertebrates.
Equinoxiodus alcantarensis gen. et sp. nov., here con-
sidered a neoceratodontid, was probably a fresh water
fish with no adaptations to cross a marine barrier and
thus not able to reach Africa.

RESUMO

A Formação Alcântara, uma importante unidade estratigrá-

fica do início do Cenomaniano no Brasil, foi depositada sob

condições transicionais (estuarinas), e o seu registro fóssil in-

clui restos fragmentários de vegetais, peixes, crocodilomorfos,

pterossauros e dinossauros, com uma notável diversidade de

placas dentárias de dipnoiformes. O material de dipnoiformes

aqui reportado compreende um novo taxon, Equinoxiodus

alcantarensis gen. et sp. nov. A maioria dos morfótipos de

vertebrados continentais coletados na Formação Alcântara são

similares a faunas cronocorrelatas do norte da África, mas

este novo gênero de Dipnoiformes indica algum grau de isola-

mento paleogeográfico e endemismo, provavelmente causado

pelo alargamento do Oceano Atlântico equatorial no início

do Cenomaniano, que pode ter afetado, de forma seletiva,

algumas espécies.

Palavras-chave: Dipnoiformes, neoceratodontídeos, Equino-

xiodus alcantarensis gen. et sp. nov., Cretáceo.
