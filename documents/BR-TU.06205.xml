ABSTRACT

SANTOS, Nicolau Oyhenard. Study of the influence of offshore drilling rigs
heave motion in drillstrings dynamic behavior. 2018. 78 f. Thesis (Master’s in
Science) – Polytechnic School, Universiy of Sa?o Paulo, Santos, 2018.

The price of crude oil is a major concern for oil companies nowadays, maintaining costs
in deepwater drilling activities is of utmost importance. The contribution of the heave
movement from floating platforms to the vibrations of drillstrings is still a subject not
fully appreciated in the literature. This work deals with the dynamic behavior of the
drillstring through finite element analysis (FEA) when an oscillating axial displacement
at the top is applied. Numerous drillstring models were generated using two-dimensional
beam elements that have degrees of freedom for the axial, shear, bending, and torsion types
of displacement. The models incorporated an axial displacement at the top of a vertical
drillstring set at the bottom. Natural frequencies were obtained for all degrees of freedom
considering different heave scenarios. The variation in the normal forces distribution due
to the inertia effect on the entire structure caused a change in the stiffness for shear
and bending degrees of freedom. The variation of natural frequencies related to shear
were obtained. In addition, the displacement of the neutral point in the drill column was
obtained. The results presented here should contribute to future research on complex
dynamic behavior of drillstrings.

Keywords: Drillstring, Vibration, Finite element, Heave, Dynamic.

O prec?o do petro?leo bruto e? uma grande preocupac?a?o para as empresas de petro?leo hoje
em dia, a manutenc?a?o de custos em atividades de perfurac?a?o em a?guas profundas e? de
extrema importa?ncia. A contribuic?a?o do movimento de heave das plataformas flutuantes
para as vibrac?o?es das colunas de perfurac?a?o ainda e? um assunto na?o totalmente apreciado
na literatura. Este trabalho aborda o comportamento dina?mico da coluna de perfurac?a?o
atrave?s da ana?lise de elementos finitos (FEA) quando um deslocamento axial oscilante
no topo e? aplicado. Numerosos modelos de colunas de perfurac?a?o foram gerados usando
elementos de vigas bidimensionais que possuem graus de liberdade axiais, de cisalhamento,
flexa?o e torc?a?o. Os modelos incorporaram uma deslocamento axial no topo de uma
coluna de perfurac?a?o vertical engastada na parte inferior. Frequ?e?ncias naturais foram
obtidas para todos os graus de liberdade considerando diferentes cena?rios de heave. A
variac?a?o na distribuic?a?o de forc?as normais devido ao efeito de ine?rcia em toda a estrutura
causou uma mudanc?a na rigidez para graus de liberdade de cisalhamento e flexa?o. As
variac?o?es das frequ?e?ncias naturais relacionadas ao cisalhamento foram obtidas. Ale?m

1 INTRODUCTION

Drilling operations in ultra-deep waters demand high initial investments and,

consequently, a great concern with economical viability of offshore projects. During periods

of low barrel price, most companies prioritize production over drilling new wells in high

water depths, particularly in the Brazilian Pre-salt (Moreira Matoso Ribeiro Gomes et al.,

2017).

To face these financial challenges drilling operations need to be the most secure,

efficient and economical, they can be, and needs to avoid any additional expenditures.

Regarding this issue, one of the most contributing factors of problems occurred during

offshore drilling is equipment failure. Most offshore operations happen by renting Mobile

Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs), which requires a substantial investment from the

operator company. Each time equipment fails, a trip is necessary, that is the removal of

the entire drillstring and posterior placing of the same. Sometimes, it takes a full day for

such an operation.

Vibrations are the dominant cause of drillstring fatigue. An absolute path to avoiding

equipment fatigue is the previous simulation of drillstring behavior. Finite Element Analysis

(FEA) consists of an excellent tool for behavior prediction and simulation of different

settings in complex systems. Besides, costs are diminished substantially by not applying

the trial and error strategy on expensive drilling projects (KHULIEF; AL-NASER, 2005).

Earlier works have studied drillstring dynamic behavior concerning several aspects.

However, the contribution of offshore platforms heave, vertical oscillatory movement, in

drillstring dynamic behavior for deep or ultra-deep wells wasn’t extensively studied. This

work proposes bridging that gap by using finite element analysis.

1.1 Drilling

Primarily, this section covers basic concepts about drilling and differences between

onshore and offshore operations. A description of a typical drillstring used in deep wells is

given. Offshore drilling platforms are discussed with special attention to ultradeepwater

units. The chapter finishes with a literature review of state-of-art research regarding

drillstring dynamic behavior.

1.1.1 History

Petroleum is the energy necessary for almost every venture in the world, from

transportation of people and commodities to the production of some types of clothing

and medicine. This energy stays buried underground beneath miles and miles of rocks

and, sometimes, many miles of water as in offshore fields. All the activities to reach and

retrieve the oil from such a difficult place without disturbing the environment safely and

effectively are part of drilling engineering.

There are reports of oil well drilling activities from A.D. 300 in China and discussion

still exists on when and where was the first oil well drilled and who the pioneer was at

that time, but the industry in a general way recognizes some critical milestones. The

most famous landmark was the well drilled by Edwin L. Drake in 1859, 21.18 meters

deep, considered the first well originated from ”modern drilling,” taking into account

the previous methods, with the purpose of finding oil. The well produced initially 8 - 10

barrels/day of oil and the mechanism used is called today ”cable tool drilling”(MITCHELL;

MISKA, 2011).

Cable tool drilling consists on reaching the subsurface by repeatedly dropping a

heavy iron bit attached to a cable, an engine at the surface is responsible for pushing back

the tool so that it can fall once again. This method, also called ”percussion drilling,” was

adopted until the 1930s when rotary drilling became the standard in the drilling industry.

With the advent of rotary drilling, the industry changed. At the of the nineteenth

century and beginning of the twentieth century, Patillo Higgins and Captain Anthony

Francis Lucas managed to reach a reservoir located 305 meters deep under a salt dome

in Texas. At the time they used the more advanced rotary drilling method and, after

facing some challenges with unconsolidated sand, they reached the target depth producing

a burst and uncontrolled flow of 100 barrel per day of oil, as shown in Figure 1. That

well, named Lucas Spindletop, is considered one of the most significant milestones for oil

industry proving the superior capacity of the rotary drilling method and the presence of

substantial accumulations of oil in the region (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).

The use of floating units was introduced in well drilling in the 1950s. Exploration

of offshore fields added new challenges to the industry and innovative technologies had to

be developed, and still are. Offshore drilling moved eventually to ultra-deep waters and

now, is a source of investment for many international oil companies.

Drilling in deep and ultra-deep waters demands high initial investments and a low

barrel price creates a doubt when it comes to economic viability. The industry must adapt

itself and every time the crude oil prices decrease, technology improvements are required

to balance the financial equation, especially in relation to offshore exploration.

1.1.2 Description

A well is a hole that connects an underground hydrocarbons reservoir to the surface.

Generally, the objective is to reach a depth stipulated in a pre-defined diameter within

the time and cost programmed, respecting a predetermined operational window and

guaranteeing the safety of the workers involved.

A tool at the surface imposes rotation to a set of interconnected pipes or the

drillstring, that rotation is eventually passed down to a drilling bit, placed at the bottom



16

and responsible for actually drilling the well by crushing or scraping the rocks. The weight

of drillstring generates an axial downward force that helps to deepen the well. As the well

increases, the drillstring keeps getting longer by connecting new tubes at the top.

To maintain a clean well, drilling fluid is circulated inside the drillstring from the

surface to bottom of the well, reaching the annular between the drillstring and the borehole

through orifices located in the drill bit. The function of this ”mud” is to remove the

cuttings and lift them to the surface. When the mud reaches the surface, it is treated so

that it can once again circulate inside the well. Figure 2 shows the usual process of rotary

drilling.

Figure 2 – A drillstring and the necessary basic elements for drilling.

Wells can have many purposes, and the quantity of personnel, equipment and the

types of services depend on the objective of the well. Exploratory wells, or wildcat wells,

are the first wells drilled to discover a reservoir still unexplored. After finding a reservoir,



17

additional wells can be drilled to gather more information on the extension and possible

productivity of the field; these wells are called appraisal wells (or extension wells). If the

reservoir is considered economically viable, new wells with the purpose of producing oil

and gas are called development wells. Additionally, wells can serve different purposes such

as injection, stratigraphic tests, and blowout reliefs.

Before every drilling activity, a company needs to own the rights to operate on

the field. In some cases, the financial risks and profits of exploring a field are divided

by a group of companies or a consortium. In the latter case, one of the companies takes

the lead and is called the operator, and the other companies can participate or not

on operational decisions depending on the consortium contract. Assuming an operator

company exists and a location to drill an exploratory well is pinpointed by the geological

team, a drilling contractor is hired to actually drill the well by first planning the entire

operation, considering possible risks and following industry’s standards on Health, Safety

and Environment (HSE), consulting the operator company and executing the task.

Possible actions may be necessary before moving equipment and personnel such as

studying seabed capability of installing equipment or preparing a site if it’s in a remote

area. The operator may have a representative drilling engineer or a group of specialists

present at the moment of drilling the well depending on the importance of the operation.

The professional representing the operator company may change the well plan in case

of new circumstances present during the operation, but normally there is a great level

of communication between the rig and the onshore headquarters regarding operational

decisions. The person responsible for rig personnel and operation as a whole is called the

tool pusher, usually a qualified professional with many years of experience working on

drilling rigs. Also, drilling service companies can participate by executing diverse tasks

during drilling such as handling drilling fluid, performing well logging or monitoring the

well. Figure 3 shows the typical drilling rig organization.

1.1.3 Drilling rigs

Rotary drilling can occur through the use of land or maritime rigs. The weight

capacity, type of equipment, degree of automation and environment the platform can

operate will depend on the scenario.

Land rigs may be conventional or mobile. Conventional land rigs are assembled

on site, demanding more time for rig preparing and disassembling before and after the

operations. Mobile land rigs are usually carried on trucks pre-assembled so that when

on site, they can be put into action more quickly. Some modern land rigs have such a

low overall weight that they can be transported by helicopter, ideal for cases of remote

locations such as jungle or deserts. Figure 4 shows an example of a mobile land rig.

The first drilling activities in water began inland above structures such as artificial

islands and wharves where the drilling equipment would be installed to drill wells in order

to reach reservoirs below lakes or rivers. Marine rigs came later even though there was

evidence of the existence of underwater hydrocarbon reservoirs, mainly because of difficult

logistics at the time. The first marine rigs were submersible drilling barges with capacity

of operating in depths between 3 and 6 meters (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).

Fixed platforms appeared in the mid-1940s to be used in shallow waters where the

maximum water depth are up to 1500 ft (460 m) (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011). Fixed

platforms are bottom supported structures that are transported and mounted on location.

The primary type of fixed platforms uses a jacket structure between the seafloor and

the surface. This type of rig usually remains in the area for post-drilling production and

pre-processing. Many wells can be tied back to the same platform so that production is

centralized and logistics are easier to handle. The drilling rig can stay or be removed from

the fixed platform depending on the company’s strategy. Figure 5 displays an example of

a fixed rig.

Soon after, investing in mobile offshore drilling started. Fixed platforms weren’t

suitable to drill wells in multiple locations due to the necessity of high initial investments

and the impossibility of moving the rig after drilling. As a transition from fixed rigs, the

most used bottom supported, but mobile, are the jackup rigs. This type of vessel has from

3 to 5 retractable legs that, when on site, are lowered to the sea floor and the platform

elevated to the air as shown in Figure 6. When operations end the platform is lowered to

water level, and its legs are ”jacked up”.

Jackup rigs could move from place to place to drill new well, but the fact that they

are bottom-supported gives a great limitation to its use in the sea. Maximum water depth

for these rigs are approximately 106 meters (350 ft.) (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).

Floating platforms such as semisubmersibles and drillships became the preferred

options when exploring in deep waters. The semisubmersible (Figure 7) is a floating

platform with two hulls for buoyancy; a compartment is filled with water and, together

with an anchoring system there is reasonable stability for drilling operations. The platform

is usually toed to arrive at the well location, and after the activities are complete, the

platform is guided to drill in another area. This type of platform also serves as a production

platform with pre-processing capabilities in deepwater reservoirs. Modern semisubmersible

rigs have dynamic position capabilities and sensors installed on the wellhead to provide

greater stability and to assure that the rig remains above the well at all times (RITTO,

2010).

The drillship is a ship-like drilling platform. It is capable of moving into locations

by itself. It can operate in the most profound water depths, up to 3000 meters. Modern

versions capable of drilling in ultradeep waters usually have dynamic positioning systems

to control the ship’s motion. Platforms like the one shown in Figure 8 is called Floating

Production Storage and Offloading vessels because of its multifunctionality and high level

of autonomy.

1.1.4 Drilling Rig Systems

Drilling rigs in an offshore area usually have systems responsible for particular

functions while drilling a well. Those systems are:

• power system;

• hoisting system;

• circulating system;

• rotary system;

• well control system;

• well monitoring system;

The power system generates the energy required for the rig to operate. Diesel

engines are the primary source of energy in the platform. That energy is transmitted all

the other systems that require electricity.

The hoisting system is responsible for lifting or lowering equipment in the rig. It’s

mainly composed of the drawworks, the drilling line, the block and tackle, the derrick, the

substructure and ancillary equipment.

The circulating system is responsible for circulating drilling fluid. The route is from

the platform into the drillstring, through the drill bit orifices, into the annular and back

to the platform while carrying the cuttings so that it can be cleaned and reused.



24

The rotary system provides rotation to the drill bit. In older rigs, the primary

source of rotation is the rotary table, a device that has a geometrical orifice on its center

so that a shaft with a usually square or hexagonal cross-section transmits the rotation to

the drillstring. While ”making a connection”, i.e., connecting a new pipe to the drillstring

as the well deepens, a new tube is attached below the swivel, a device that combines the

hoisting system and the circulating system supplying fluid to the interior of the drillstring.

Modern drilling rigs use top drives, a more advanced alternative capable of giving rotation

and fluid flow without the need of a rotary table or kelly.

The well control system has a vital role during drilling. It is responsible for assuring

that no undesired flow of formation fluids occur during drilling and, if that happens, it

has to make sure that the situation doesn’t evolve into a blowout when an uncontrolled

flow of hydrocarbons reach the surface. Equipment such as Blowout Preventers (BOPs),

pit-volume indicators and flow indicators are part of the set of this system.

The well monitoring system is composed of all devices and equipment that have a

part in the control of essential parameters in the rig such as well depth, hook load, and

pit level. In modern platforms, a centralized control unit is present at the engineer’s office

so that monitoring occurs during all times during drilling.

1.1.5 Drilling rigs displacement

In marine environments, an important aspect when drilling is the rig displacement.

Sometimes environmental conditions can post a challenge for a rig to stay above the

well location. Vertical, horizontal and angular movements occur, especially in rough sea

conditions. To minimize horizontal displacement anchoring and dynamic positioning system

are good options. However, in water depths greater than 700 meters (MITCHELL; MISKA,

2011), anchoring a floating rig is not recommended because of the weight of the chains and

the difficulty of installing without support vessels. As a solution for this problem, dynamic

positioning (DP) is a system composed of a set of thrusters that counter the forces from

the marine currents measured by sensors. A control room inside the rig monitors the whole

system.

The vertical movement, called ’heave”, due to ocean waves is also a problem during

drilling operations. For the drilling to be efficient, the Weight On Bit (WOB) has to



25

remain constant. To compensate the vertical displacement a heave compensator is used

and a pneumatic tensioning device on the traveling block maintains a constant hookload

(MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).

1.1.6 Heave compensation systems

The main objective of a heave compensation system is to separate the vessel motion

from the load motion, reducing the tension variation on the suspended structure. Woodacre

et al. (2015) makes a comprehensive review of the different mechanisms of vertical motion

heave compensation systems. Two prevailing categories are passive and active heave

compensation systems.

A passive heave compensation system is basically an equipment that isolates

vibration. In order to attenuate the vessel motion and maintain a controlled displacement

of the drillstring, a series of spring-damper sets are put between the rig and the suspended

drillstring. Figure 10 gives a simplistic schematic of a passive heave compensation system.

A small vessel, a subject of heave displacement due to ocean currents, suspending a

concentrated load at the end of a line. The spring-damper symbolizes a passive heave

compensation system that attenuates the vibration from the vessel and transmits a lower

amplitude vibration to the load it carries. Passive heave compensators don’t require energy



26

and have proved to serve as an important asset during drilling activities as suggested early

in the seventies by Butler (1973).

Figure 10 – A basic schematic of a vibration isolator such as a passive heave compensator.

The active heave compensation systems use a control system that acts directly on

column weight variations, enabling operations under more severe environmental conditions

(DO; PAN, 2008). Passive systems act when subjected to a variation of traction due to

the change of load suffered, acting as a kind of ”spring”. In semi-active systems, there is a

combination of active and passive systems where an additional hydraulic force is applied

to the latter to minimize friction losses and air pressure losses. The semi-active system

consumes less energy than the active system (MELLO; VAZ, 2004). The absence of a

heave compensation system may jeopardize other activities not directly related to drilling,

such as the control and operation of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or the exact

location of equipment that has to be moved below the surface of the sea, besides causing

great risks during drilling.

Due to the high costs of drilling operations on large water depths, many studies

have focused on the development of heave compensation systems in order to mitigate

possible damages that vertical riser oscillation from the platform could cause (CUELLAR,

2014; DO; PAN, 2008).

In addition to the design of heave compensation systems, much attention is paid

by the industry to the understanding of the riser’s response to the vertical movement of

the platform. A major initiative of the industry was to develop systems of prediction of

movement of the riser. However, the major obstacle is to understand how the riser deforms

with the static and dynamic forces acting simultaneously on it (Marcio Yamamoto, 2011).

1.2 Drillstring

The drillstring consists on a string of steel tubes that are connected by threads.

When the complete set is assembled, it forms a long and flexible structure. This tubing

has at its lower end a shorter and heavier segment composed of thicker ducts, called drill

collars, with a cutting interface at its free end, the drill bit (TUCKER; WANG, 1999a).

The function of the heavier pipes is to apply weight to the bit so that the formation is

invaded until the purpose of the drilling project is reached, usually an oil and / or gas

reservoir.

The functions of the drillstring are (DAREING, 2012):

• to transmit mechanical rotary power to the drill bit;

• to circulate fluids;

• to affect hole direction;

• to apply force to drill bits.

The drillstring is mostly formed by drill pipes. There are drill collars at the lower

portion and tools can be present, such as stabilizers, Measuring While Drilling (MWD),

drill bit, Positive Displacement Motor (PDM) and turbines.

Drill pipes are designed to work while tensile is applied. In contrast, drill collars

have higher resistance to compression. The difference in physical parameters between drill

pipes and drill collars can be attenuated by placing heavy weight drill pipes between the

two portions of pipe.

The pipes are connected by shouldered threaded couplings, called tool joints. These

tools are used mainly to protect the coupling and to give an outside diameter offset so

that they are more easily lifted and suspended.

1.2.1 Mechanics

Drillstring vibrations are a complex research subject. Many factors such as bit/formation

interaction, drillstring/wellbore interaction and hydraulics can influence drillstring dynamic

behavior. Associated with these types of vibration are phenomena that can substantially

decrease drilling performance like premature wear and damage of drilling equipment, and

consequent decrease in the rate of penetration (ROP) (AADNOY et al., 2009). The BHA is

the location in the drillstring where most of the excitations happen, and the pertaining drill

collars and adjacent heavyweight drill pipes have a higher probability of suffering damage



29

due to vibrations. Although vibrations can generate adverse effects such as equipment

failure and well misdirection, there is research on benefits of axial vibration to drilling

(XIAO; HURICH; BUTT, 2018a; XIAO; HURICH; BUTT, 2018b).Three primary modes

of vibration exist during drilling: axial, torsional and lateral vibrations, as shown in Figure

12.

Figure 12 – Primary vibration modes of a drillstring.

Source: (J.J. Azar; G. Robello Samuel, 2007).

The axial vibration consists of the oscillation along the longitudinal axis of the

drillstring. The source can be static or dynamic. The leading dynamic cause of axial

vibrations is bit/formation interaction, especially in roller-cone bits (SKAUGEN, 1987).

Symptoms such as kelly bounce and whipping of the drawworks cables at the rig can

indicate axial vibrations (DAREING, 1984). The severity of the vibration can induce a

fluctuation in WOB decreasing the ROP as a consequence (AADNOY et al., 2009).

Axial vibrations may cause bit-bounce, a phenomenon where the bit temporarily

lifts from the bottom ceasing to interact with the formation to, later, impact the bottom

of the well. Bit-bounce may cause bit wear, excessive vibration, a decrease in ROP and

worse drilling performances.



30

Torsional vibration relates to angular motion along the drillstring longitudinal axis.

A constant ROP on the surface does not transmit correctly to the bit because of the

torsional flexibility of the drillstring. This type of vibration can be transient, where the

oscillation occurs at specific points in the drillstring, and steady-state, that happens for

a longer time interval. It relates to a common drilling problem called ”stick-slip”. This

motion consists of a very low angular velocity, or complete standstill, of the bit while the

tubes accumulate energy and a sudden release of energy making the bit rotate as fast as

ten times the original angular velocity. This phenomenon can cause extensive bit wear,

fatigue and even failure of drillstring equipment (AADNOY et al., 2009).

Lateral vibrations also called bending, transverse and flexural vibrations, are

the leading cause of drillstring failure. Bit/formation interaction, drillstring/borehole

interaction and an initially bent BHA can cause this type of vibration. A consequence

of lateral vibration is drillstring whirling, a centrifugal induced bowing of the drillstring

during bit rotation (VANDIVER; NICHOLSON; SHYU, 1990), this effect can be forward,

backward or chaotic. Figure 13 shows the nature of this motion where the center of mass

moves from the drillstring longitudinal axis. This effect may lead to a range of phenomena

that result in equipment failures such as abrasion of drill collars external walls, connections

fatigue and a decrease in ROP. Since the BHA is always subject to compression, this

section has a higher tendency of suffering from buckling and whirling (AADNOY et al.,

2009).



31

In practice, the study of drillstring mechanics involve the three main types of

vibration separately together with a range of effects. These effects can be linear and

parametrical coupling between axial, lateral and torsional vibrations (GHASEMLOONIA;

Geoff Rideout; BUTT, 2014a), bit-bounce, backward and forward whirl and stick-slip.

Coupling mechanisms occur and increase the complexity of the drillstring dynamic behavior

substantially.

1.3 State-of-the-art

Previous research has focused on multiple aspects of the drillstring dynamic be-

havior as mentioned in literature reviews addressing vibrations, modeling, and failure

(ZHU; TANG; YANG, 2014; GHASEMLOONIA; Geoff Rideout; BUTT, 2015; ALBDIRY;

ALMENSORY, 2016). As a general rule, the BHA is the location that suffers the most

with vibration (DAREING, 1984).

GHASEMLOONIA et al. (2015) makes a review on earlier works related to drill-

string vibrations modeling and shows the most significant research on drillstring behavior



32

predictions and vibrations mitigation. The literature review until the end of the research

period will follow the works mentioned in the publication.

KHULIEF (2005) developed a dynamic model of the drillstring including drill pipes

and drill collars. The shaft elements used had 12 degrees of freedom each. The gravitational

force field, the coupling between torsional and bending inertia and the gyroscopic effect

were considered. The author used a consistent mass matrix and the explicit method to

study the structure of dynamic behavior. Later, KHULIEF (2007) performed the analysis

of the stick-slip effect by coupling axial and bending degrees of freedom while adding

stick-slip self-excited oscillations.

TUCKER (1999b) developed a numerical model that covers all modes of vibration

in an integrated system which was composed of Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) and drill

pipes. In the analysis, the element used had 6 degrees of freedom. The research addressed

the oscillating friction between bit and formation (bit bouncing) and helical buckling of

the drillstring.

Experiments suggest that the drillstring reacts in diverse ways when changing

operating parameters such as torque, drag force, temperature and weight on bit. CHENG

(2011) assembled an experiment to measure the forces acting on the bit and BHA through

a dynamic force sensor that measures axial, lateral and rotational forces.

KAPITANIAK (2015) assembled and experimental rig with commercial drill bits

and rock-samples. Several types of phenomena could be studied, such as stick-slip, whirling,

bit-bounce and helical buckling. A finite element model was developed using shaft elements.

The results showed convergence between the experiment and the model, especially during

stick-slip oscillations.

Niedzwecki &amp;amp; Thampi (1988) studied the dynamic behavior of long drillstrings

subjected to the heave movement of the platform, compensated by a passive system

installed in the platform-column drilling interface. The sensitivity of the string to different

environmental loading scenarios was evaluated through the dynamic amplitude, the phase

angle and the dimensionless voltage ratio. Through this study, it became clear the need for

a heave compensation system to minimize vertical oscillation during drilling operations.

El-Hawary &amp;amp; Mbamalu (1996) developed robust estimation techniques for underwa-

ter motion compensation. Cuellar &amp;amp; Fortaleza (2014), developed a hydropneumatic heave

compensation system together with a semi-active control system for 6 km depth drillings.

The objective was to maintain the performance of the drilling with the constant change of



33

the mass of the drillstring due to the action of the environmental agents on the platform.

Through the said system, more robust, they obtained a good result in the compensation

of the heave.

There is a recent interest in the application of axial vibrations to increase ROP

and consequently drill wells more efficiently (GHASEMLOONIA; Geoff Rideout; BUTT,

2014b).

Studies were carried out on the dynamics of the drillstring, the heave movement of

the platform and the heave compensation systems currently used. However, few studies

have been carried out on the effect of the heave movement of floating platforms with

compensation system installed in the sum of vibrations of the drillstring.

1.4 Problem description

The fatigue caused by vibrations in drillstrings is a primary motive for equipment

failure during drilling operations. Previous works addressed various aspects of drillstring

vibrations, but the study of heave contribution was not particularly made. The input of

an oscillatory motion to the top of the drillstring may affect axial tension in the structure

in different ways, and changes in the modal behavior should occur.

1.5 Research objective

The objective of this work is to study the contribution of heave motion from

environmental loads in offshore platforms to drillstring dynamic behavior using finite

element analysis. Natural frequencies and vibration modes will be calculated as a function

of parameters such as wave amplitude and frequency.

2 THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD

2.1 Concept

Finite element method (FEM) is a mathematical tool used in many fields such as

heat transfer, electromagnetism, fluid mechanics and structural analysis. The primary

focus of this research in on structural analysis. Given the existence of a physical problem,

the use of the method creates the possibility of predicting complex structure behavior

considering different geometries and loads in a static or dynamic environment.

Every physical problem can be simplified by a mathematical model. A mathematical

model is a set of governing differential equations that determine the system behavior that

assumes parameters such as geometry, kinematics and physical laws that apply to the

problem. The process of solving these equations for every point in the domain is called

analytical solution.

Real problems, however, tend to have complex mathematical models that make it

solving analytically almost impossible. The finite element method comes as a tool (one of

many) that bypasses this problem. By breaking down the structure in ”finite elements,”

or discretizing the structure, each element has a set of simpler algebraic equations that

determine its governing behavior. Between elements, there are ”nodes.” Each node has

types of movement it can perform. Those types of displacement, linear or angular, are

called degrees of freedom.

The mesh or grid is the discretized structure; its refinement determines the accuracy

of the approximated solution. The mesh generates a significant number of linear equations

that are solvable by a matrix approach. After creating the mesh, it is necessary to set

displacement restrictions or boundary conditions. Boundary conditions enable eliminating

some rows and columns of the solution matrix, making the system solvable. Usually, in

structural analysis, the nodes displacement are the solution, and different parameters are

obtainable from the displacement values such as stress and strain on the nodes degrees of

freedom for the entire mesh. Figure 14 displays the usual path of a simulation.



35

Figure 14 – Usual path to a finite element analysis.

Source: Modified from (BATHE, 2006).

The model generates approximated numerical solutions for every degree of freedom

of the system. The results may have satisfying accuracy or not; it’s the responsibility of

the engineer to determine the degree of error for the model. If it does not satisfy, it’s



36

possible to refine the model and to generate a new mesh with more elements or, even, to

change the mathematical model for the physical problem.

The most valuable characteristics of the finite element method are efficiency and

reliability, especially after the advent of digital computers. Although FEM is a great tool,

the process depends on the mathematical model, if the numerical model doesn’t represent

to a certain extent the system behavior, the solution using FEM won’t be able to deliver

reliable results (BATHE, 2006).

2.2 Static analysis

The negative values relate to the displacement subtraction of The finite element

method is an excellent approach to both static and dynamic problems. For the static

part, the use of the technique is much more straightforward. Equation 1 gives the general

approach to static problems in structural analysis.

Kx = F (1)

In Equation 1, K represents the stiffness matrix, x represents the displacement

vector and F the load vector. It’s clear the relationship of the static problem with the

general linear spring equation. The stiffness parameter will have a different formula for

each degree of freedom.

For all analysis during the research period, the two-dimensional beam is the chosen

finite element. The beam element has eight degrees of freedom: axial, shear, flexural and

torsional for each node. Figure 15 shows the beam element for the example.

Equations 2, 3 and 4 set the uncoupled behavior of the degrees of freedom corre-

sponding to axial, shear, bend and torsion, respectively. Equation 3 represents the coupled

behavior of a translational and a rotational degrees of freedom, shear and bend.

shear modulus, and J is the polar moment of inertia.

Equation 5 is the matrix form of Equation 1 for the beam element (Marcio Ya-

mamoto, 2011). Matrix rows and columns 2 and 5 concern the degree of freedom due to

shear. In the stiffness matrix, rows and columns 3 and 6 represent bending and rows and

columns 4 and 8 represent the angular degree of freedom corresponding to torsion. Thus,

the elastic stiffness matrix for the 2D beam is 8x8.

2.3 Dynamic Analysis

Most finite element simulations involve dynamic problems. There are two types of

dynamic analysis: on the frequency domain and on the time domain. Equation 10 shows

the general equation for dynamic analysis in time domain.

Mx? + Cx? + Kx = F(t) (10)

Equation 10 has a few additional parameters, M stands for the mass matrix, C

is the damping matrix, x? and x? are the first and second derivatives of the displacement,

i.e., velocity and acceleration. The variation with time demands the input of the inertia

parameter, the mass matrix, and the damping parameter.



40

The linear dynamic response of a system depends on three types of forces: inertia

forces, damping forces and elastic forces. All of them are time-dependent. The same

equation can be used for static analysis as long as inertia and damping forces are neglected.

It’s the job of the engineer to provide justification for the choice of which type

of analysis to perform. The analyst suffers from the risk of performing useless work.

Particularly to nonlinear problems, this is critical.

Equation 10 represents, mathematically, a system of linear differential equations

of second order that can be solved by conventional methods using constant coefficients.

However, this approach is not applicable when very large matrices are involved.

The mass matrix for the beam element is of the same size as the stiffness matrix,

four rows and four columns for each node. The matrix can be lumped or consistent.

Equation 11 shows the lumped matrix for the beam element. Equation 12 represent the

consistent mass matrix for the beam element (Marcio Yamamoto, 2011).

In the equations above, ? stands for specific mass in [kg/m3], m is the distributed

mass per unit of length in [kg/m].

The damping matrix is assembled by a combination of the stiffness and mass

matrices using Rayleigh’s coefficients (CLOUGH; PENZIEN, 2013). Equation 13 shows

the usual method for the calculation of the damping matrix.

B = ?K + ?M (13)

Damping was not considered for the validation of the dynamic analysis in the time

and frequency domains. However, for the dynamic models of the drillstring, better results

were obtained when ? = 0.05 and ? = 0, and these results are shown in the last chapter.

2.3.1 Frequency Domain

Another code was created for dynamic analysis of beams. The examples used

for code validation also had a cantilever beam to check natural frequencies convergence

between analytical and FEA calculations. The analytical calculations were done based on

Equations 14, 15 and 16 (GRAFF, 1975).

2.3.2 Time Domain

The learning path of the method also covered dynamic analysis of structures formed

by beam elements in the time domain. What an usual time analysis does is to impose

equilibrium between inertia, damping and elastic forces to the system subjected to external

forces (Equation 10) for each time step regarding a total analysis time and a particular

time discretization.



45

There are numerical methods that can do this type of integration, two of these are:

direct integration and mode superposition. Although a little different, these two methods

are closely related.

In the case of direct integration methods, the word ”direct” corresponds to the fact

that no transformation is performed on the equations prior to the step-by-step numerical

procedure. One of the important aspect of these methods is that system equilibrium is only

sought for specific points in time rather than for the entire time interval. Another important

aspect is that a variation of displacements, velocities and accelerations is assumed and

this contributes to the solution accuracy and stability.

The solution of the equilibrium equations for dynamic analysis performed by direct

integration can happen by applying explicit or implicit methods. The explicit method

calculates the solution for a particular discrete time point t + ?t based on the equilibrium

equations of the previous time point t. The implicit method, however, obtains the solution

for t + ?t based on the equilibrium equations for time t + ?t as shown in Equation 17.

Another difference between the implicit and explicit method is the dependency of the

latter on the size of the time step used in the analysis.

t+?tKU + t+?tCU? + t+?tMU? = t+?tR (17)

This research focused on a particular implicit method called Newmark Method. It is a

widely used numerical integration method for structure analysis. Being one the most

used methods in finite element analysis, it solves differential equations that describe the

dynamic behavior of solids and structures, as well as other systems. Equations 18 and

19 represent the formulas used to obtain velocities and displacements in the Newmark

method. By isolating t+?tU?, accelerations are obtained (NEWMARK, 1959).

t+?tU? = tU? + [(1 ? ?) tU? + ? t+?tU?]?t (18)

t+?tU = tU + tU??t +

[(
1

2
??

)
tU? + ? t+?tU?

]
?t2 (19)

The parameters ? and ? can vary according to the necessary accuracy and stability

for the analysis. This work adopted the constant-average-acceleration method, where ? = 1
2

and ? = 1
4
, known for being unconditionally stable (NEWMARK, 1959).



46

To validate the application of the finite element method to dynamic analysis in the

time domain, an example from (BATHE, 2006) was used. Equation 20 shows the governing

equilibrium equations for the example.?

Apart from the example in the literature, a more realistic model was assembled in

order to show and validate the algorithm for solving dynamic systems. A steel bar with

properties shown in Table 6 has a punctual axial load of 10000 N at each node.

3 AXIAL TENSION, NATURAL FREQUENCIES AND VIBRATION
MODES

3.1 Analytic Model

Models with increasingly complexity were necessary until an ideal model could be

used for the obtention of natural frequencies and vibration modes. The static behavior of

the drillstring under axial tension can be modeled by Equation 21 (PATIL; TEODORIU,

2013). This is a basic model that doesn’t take into account hydrostatic and hydrodynamic

effects.

where xR refers to the drillstring deflection in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal

axis, z is the vertical coordinate, Tz is the axial tension along the beam, w corresponds to

the weight per unit of length (N/m2) and f is resultant force on the structure (Marcio

Yamamoto, 2011).

3.2 Geometric Stiffness Matrix

The effect of the axial stress on the drillstring due to pipe weight, buoyancy, hook

load and WOB cause a change on the buckling and shear stiffness that, if not addressed,

create a inaccurate response of the system. Equation 22 represents the geometric portion

of the stiffness for a beam element (Marcio Yamamoto, 2011).

3.3 Static model validation

Previous to dynamic analysis, a static example from the literature (Marcio Ya-

mamoto, 2011) was used as a base for validation of the static model. Figure 22 displays a

pipe with a weight attached to its bottom end and a distributed lateral force of 1 N/m.

Table 7 shows the material properties for the static simulation.

The figures in this chapter prove that all algorithms and implementations are

working properly, allowing to incorporate the heave influence on the drillstring behavior.

4 PARAMETRICAL ANALYSIS

In order to fulfill the objective of studying the influence of the heave motion of

MODUs to dynamic behavior of drillstrings, the research resulted into a parametrical anal-

ysis. By changing the environmental paramters, the drillstring suffers different influences

causing a different physical behavior and consequently variation of natural frequencies and

vibration modes.

After certificating that the model shows good results according to the wave data,

the following step is performing a modal analysis. Acquiring natural frequencies and

vibration modes can be performed computationally through LAPACK (Linear Algebra

PACKage) subroutines.

4.1 Heave Displacement

Heave is the vertical displacement of a rig placed offshore. To impose a displacement

to the drillstring, wave data (PIANCA; MAZZINI; SIEGLE, 2010), was used directly

as motion amplitude and period on the top of the drillstring. The research could have

used only a portion of the wave amplitude representing a passive heave compensation

system, but since the average values were low, it was decided to not consider a motion

compensation. This work considered average wave amplitudes and periods for all seasons

of the year in Santos Basin, Brazil. Figure 28 demonstrates the varying wave behavior

across the year taking an average of the wave amplitudes and periods.



54

4.2 Normal Forces Distribution

Normal forces in a drillstring is maximum at its top and minimum at the bottom,

where it turns negative because of the change from a tensioned system to a compressed

system. The amount of compressive force above the bit is also called Weight on Bit (WOB)

and is a paramount parameter for every drlling operation.

Equation 23 displays all forces considered in this model. Table 9 explains the

parameters in Equation 23.

F = Fg + Fp + T (23)

Force Explanation
Fg Hoisting system
Fp Distributed weight
T Axial Tension
F Total force

Table 9 – Forces present on each element of the system



55

Taking into account Equation 23 and replacing F in Equation 24, Equation 25 can

be used to calculate the tension on the drillstring. After calculating MU?, axial tension is

calculated.

MU? + CU? + KU = F(t) (24)

T = Fp ?Fg + MU? (25)

Figure 29 shows the variation of normal forces considering an static case. When

considering only the weight of the drillstring and the force due to the hoisting system of

the platform, most of the drillstring suffers tension while at the bottom the string is on a

compressive state.

Normal forces on the drillstring vary from the static example because of the inertia

effect. Neutral point is the location where axial stress is zero. If you cut the line at this

point, no difference in weight will be felt during suspension of the string.

4.3 Dynamic Model

After performing and validating static and dynamic analysis, the research focused

on a more realistic model of a drillstring. Two models were considered: a hanging structure

and a structure fixed at the bottom.

The program structure to perform the dynamic analysis consisted of:

1. Input data such as drillstring length, time of analysis, time step and number of finite

elements;

2. Assembling of organizing matrices based upon boundary conditions and input data

(Thomas J. R. Hughes, 1987);

3. Mass matrix assembling;

4. FOR loop [0: time interval: time of analysis]:

a) IF beginning of the loop:

i. Assembling of axial forces in the drillstring without acceleration.

ii. Assembling of stiffness and damping matrices.

iii. Obtention of dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the axial

and torsional degrees of freedom (non-time dependent).

iv. Load array assembling (time dependent - Dirichlet boundary conditions).

v. Newmark method (NEWMARK, 1959).

vi. Obtention of dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degree

of freedom of shear (time dependent).

b) ELSE:

i. Assembling of axial forces in the drillstring WITH acceleration for the

particular time step.

ii. Assembling of stiffness and damping matrices (time dependent).

iii. Load array assembling (time dependent - Dirichlet boundary conditions).

iv. Newmark method.

v. Obtention of dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degree

of freedom of shear (time dependent).

5. Output data



57

Taking into consideration the dynamic simulation of the drillstrings, the axial

force due to the drawworks was 0.02 the weight of the whole structure subtracted by the

buoyancy on seawater to maintain a tension-compression relationship in the drillstring

necessary for all drilling operations.

The model contemplated 4 scenarios of platform heave motion as seen in Figure 28

(PIANCA; MAZZINI; SIEGLE, 2010). The first scenario had a heave response amplitude

of 1.5 meters and wave excitation of 11 seconds, the second scenario had a heave response

amplitude of 2 meters and wave excitation of 11 seconds, the third scenario had a heave

response amplitude of 2.5 m and wave excitation of 11 s and the fourth scenario considered

a heave response amplitude of 1.5 m and wave excitation of 7 s. The drillstring model

considered for the analysis was a 1000 meters long composed only of drillpipes, heavyweight

drillpipes and drillcollars. Table 4.3 presents the parameters used for the different sections

in the drillstring (LYONS; PLISGA, 2005).

Table 10 – Data respective to all different sections in the structure.

All analysis had a total time of 50 seconds and a time step size of 0.05 seconds. To

show the convergence of numerical results for the displacements, velocities and accelerations

using the Newmark method, the first excitation period was removed because of transient

behavior of data. For better visualization numerical results for the displacements, velocities

and acceleration were shown for the first 30 seconds of analysis. The wave periods are

highlighted by different background colors on the graphs.

4.3.1 Hanging Structure

Figure 30 displays a simplified diagram of the drillstring for the first dynamic

model. Only one boundary condition is present, a prescribed displacement at the top node

representing the heave displacement of the rig. The lower end of the drillstring is free to



58

move. This model represents a drillstring being lowered or raised with its whole length

inside the riser.

Vertical displacement and axial force variation on the top node of the drillstring,

shown in Figure 31, prove coherent physical behavior of the drillstring. The axial force

variation with time shows an alternation between states of tension and compression at

the top of the structure. Although small considering the much greater weight of the

drillstring, the axial force variation states that when the string is being lowered due to the

displacement at the top the structure enters in a compressive state showing a negative

axial force. When the vertical displacement is positive the drillstring enters in a state of

tension. This behavior appears even when the drillstring has no physical link at its lower

end evidencing the elastic behavior of the long structure made of fortified steel.

Since the structure is hanging with its lower end free to move, the displacement

relative to time for the entire drillstring was equivalent. The amplitude and period of



59

excitation at the top have been displayed in all nodes of the discretized model with a slight

difference in amplitude due to the elastic behavior of the slender structure.

Although until this point the validation has accompanied all the models, to validate

this model data from active rigs such as hoisting force in the draw works system, drillstring

weight and compensated rig displacement would be necessary for validation. This research

proposes the obtention of rig data from the industry and comparison with results obtained

by the finite element analysis to validate this model.

4.3.2 Fixed Structure

Posterior to the analysis of the drillstring in a hanging situation, a new analysis

was made to the same structure fixed at the bottom. This new problem can be classified

as a boundary-value problem since no vertical displacement occurs at the lower end, but

an imposed displacement is passed at the top end of the string.

The direct integration through the Newmark method allows the obtention of

displacements, velocities, and acceleration for every node of the model. These values are



60

necessary for calculating the axial forces for each time step in every element. As explained

before, the geometric stiffness matrix is dependent on the axial force on every element.

The analysis considered all four scenarios of heave displacement obtaining the

dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degrees of freedom of axial, shear

and torsion. The axial and torsional behavior is not dependent on the tensioned or

compressed state of the structure so they were obtained only at the initial time step of

the analysis.

The variation of the dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degree

of freedom of shear is shown for all scenarios.

Scenario 1: Heave response amplitude 1.5 m, wave excitation 11 s

The first scenario considered a harmonic vertical displacement at the top node

of 1.5 meters of amplitude and 11 seconds of the natural period. Figure 4.3.2 shows 4



61

subplots, the first one representing the imposed displacement at the top, the second (to

the right) showing the displacement numerically obtained for a node at the middle of the

string and the last two graphs show the velocity and acceleration variation. The time scale

used, 11 to 30 seconds, in the graphs is a smaller portion of a longer analysis to show

the correct behavior of displacements, velocities, and accelerations and to validate the

dynamic analysis one more time.

The graphs show results starting from the second period due to the transient

behavior of the initial seconds of analysis. Figure 4.3.2 shows the displacement of the

neutral point in the drillstring. At this point, axial forces equal zero, above this point the

structure is tensioned and below this point, the structure is compressed.

There is clear periodicity on the displacement of the neutral point and range

between 912.5 and 937.5 meters demonstrate that the neutral point varies inside the drill

collar section. Figure 4.3.2 shows the variation of the dimensionless natural frequencies

with time. The graph displays natural frequencies from the second to the fifth vibration

mode, showing periodicity one more time and equivalent behavior for the transversal

degree of freedom.

As seen in the four different scenarios of heave motion that an offshore rig may

be subjected to, the model shows good convergence when comparing axial displacements,

velocities, and accelerations of a node in the middle of the structure, acquired through the

use of the Newmark method and the Dirichlet boundary conditions technique.

Also, the neutral point displacements are periodic and in accordance with heave

data. Results also incorporate the variation of the normal forces along the drillstring with

time.

Dimensionless natural frequencies for the degree of freedom corresponding to shear

were obtained. Results show periodicity when comparing every wave excitation. The

behavior of the natural frequencies can be associated with a nonlinear behavior of slender

structures when subjected to periodic loading such as marine drift.

The complete nonlinear behavior of the drillstring even now is studied by companies

and academia. This dynamic model could only be validated if the actual behavior of the

drillstring could be summarized with the present considerations. The research intends on



73

continuing with the goal of approaching a closer dynamic model of the drillstring that

could be used by companies in order to predict and prevent excessive vibrations when

drilling offshore.

5 CONCLUSIONS

An increasing complexity approach was adopted to apply accurately the finite

element method for drilling operations. An static example of a slender structure with

a weight applied to the bottom and a distributed transverse force was simulated and

compared to existing literature. Natural frequencies and vibration modes were acquired

and validated.

Dynamic analysis in both time and frequency domain showed good convergence

and accurate results when compared with analytic calculations. A varying distribution

of normal forces with time due to the inertia effect was adopted and the behavior of a

drillstring along a time interval was studied.

A finite element model of a drillstring considering an oscillatory movement on the

top node simulating the heave displacement of an offshore rig was produced. Natural

frequencies variation were obtained considering different types of heave environments.

Additionally, neutral point displacement was obtained.

The validation of the final model could be realized through a comparison of data

when the drillstring is being lowered or raised. The validation of the model when the

structure is fixed is impossible with data from the industry due to the lack of important

parameters such as rotation, ocean force, friction, impacts to the well, heave compensation

mechanisms, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects.

A higher discretization of the structure would allow a better visualization of neutral

point position across time. High performance computing is an important step in continuing

to study the drillstring, specially when facing nonlinear factor such as friction and impacts

to the well bore.

The author intends to increase the complexity of this final model by adding

hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects to the drillstring, angular velocity, marine loading

and a limit to drillstring displacement when simulating a drillstring inside a well.
