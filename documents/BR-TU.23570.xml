Abstract 
 

The Tertiary deposits of the Sado Basin (in southwestern Portugal) were 
deposited in a typical continental basin, composed by 4 main lithostratigraphic 
units. During the Palaeogene, the Sado Basin was a closed basin in which the 
mineralogy of the primary facies underwent significant changes that resulted in 
the extensive occurrence of palygorskite. The Palaeogene fill of the Sado basin 
is composed by reddish coarse detrital sediments (conglomerates, arkosic 
sandstones, clays and marly carbonates). 28 samples representative of the 
most exposed outcrops of these units were collected and analysed by XRD, 
XRF and SEM-EDS for their mineralogical and chemical characterization. SEM-
EDS was used to compute the crystallochemical formulas for the identified clay 
minerals. Clay minerals associations were used as lithostratigraphical markers 
as well as for paleoenvironmental reconstructions and diagenesis analyses. 
Palaeogene deposits are characterized by an increase on palygorskite relative 
amounts in the distal parts of the basin as well as by higher  structural order of 
the clay minerals in the Miocene sediments and lower structural order in 
Eocene sediments, pointing to a significant diagenesis contribution.

Resumo 
 

Os depósitos terciários da Bacia do Sado (no sudoeste de Portugal) 
comtemplam quatro principais unidades litoestratigráficas que resultam de uma 
deposição típica de uma bacia continental. Durante o Paleogénico, a Bacia do 
Sado era uma bacia fechada em que a mineralogia da fácies primária passou 
por mudanças significativas, que resultou numa extensa ocorrência de 
paligorskite. O preenchimento paleogénico da bacia do Sado é composto por 
sedimentos avermelhados detríticos grosseiros (conglomerados, arcoses, 
argilas e margas). Foram colhidas 28 amostras representativas dos 
afloramentos mais expostos das referidas unidades litoestratigráficas e 
analisadas, do ponto de vista mineralógico e químico, por DRX, FRX, 
respectivamente. Recorreu-se a análises SEM-EDS para calcular as fórmulas 
cristaloquímicas para os minerais argilosos identificados. Os resultados obtidos 
permitiram estabelecer associações mineralógicas para cada unidade, 
principalmente no que concerne os minerais argilosos. Estas associações 
foram interpretadas como marcadores litostratigráficos e possibilitaram a 
reconstrução paleoambiental e análise diagenética da bacia do Sado. De 
forma geral, os depósitos paleogénicos que preenchem a Bacia do Sado são 
caracterizados por um incremento na quantidade relativa de paligorskite no 
sentido proximal-distal, bem como por um aumento da ordem estrutural dos 
minerais de argila na mesma unidade litoestratigráfica, o que aponta para uma 
contribuição diagenética relevante.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) 

1 
 

1. Introduction 
Stratigraphic interpretation using clay-mineral analysis can be made when the 

diagenetic influence on clay mineralogy remains low. The spatio-temporal 

distribution of detrital clay minerals in sedimentary successions may provide 

information on the environmental conditions of the source areas such as climate  

lithology and soils composition (Adatte and Bolle, 2001; Alcalá et al., 2001; Ruffell 

et al., 2002; Dou et al., 2010), relative sea-level changes (Daoudi et al., 1995; 

Moon et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2009), and tectonics (Enu, 1986; 

Martín-Martín et al., 2001). This distribution can indicate the proximity to the 

source area (Thiry and Jacquin, 1993; Clark et al., 2009), with implications for 

palaeoenvironmental modeling. Stratigraphic changes in the abundance of 

smectite, kaolinite, and illite allow assessments of relative proximal–distal 

variations. 

The analysis of the clay mineral associations' provides important information on 

paleoclimatic studies essentially concerning regional data. The composition of 

detrital mineral associations is particularly useful in the way that they record the 

modifications that occur in source area, in what concerns the erosion conditions 

(Rocha et al., 2005). 

Palygorskite is relatively rare in nature; however, its origins has been studied 

frequently owing to the unique conditions required for its formation and stability, 

and the need to find new commercial deposits. According to Callen (1984), major 

deposits of palygorskite were formed in three different environments: (1) in 

epicontinental and inland seas and lakes as chemical sediments or by 

reconstitution of former sedimentary clays; (2) in the open ocean in association 

with fore-arc basins and ocean ridges by hydrothermal alteration of basaltic glass, 

volcaniclastic sediments or existing clays; and (3) in calcareous soils by direct 

crystallization. With respect to their geotectonic setting, neoformed palygorskite 

and sepiolite are predominant in shallow shelf basins on passive margins or 

intraplate basins. Continental rift basins, continental “sag” basins or some 

perimarine basins, tend to contain significant deposits of these minerals, 

commonly formed in saline or hypersaline conditions  Merriman, 2005).

According to Singer (1984), palygorskite in soils is associated with one of the 

following conditions: (i) modern soils that, at present or in the past, were affected 

by rising groundwater of pH 7–8 and high salinity; (ii) in soils with distinct and 

sharp textural transitions because these minerals accumulate in the coarse 

fraction (this group includes many palaeosols); and (iii) in calcretes (caliches). In 

all these cases, palygorskite (and very rarely sepiolite, when Al is absent or 

immobilized) is precipitated by evaporation of the vadose water (Jones and Weir, 

1983). Soils (duricrusts) can be cemented by palygorskite named palycretes 

(Rodas et al., 1994). 

The present research project was executed under the title, “Paleoenvironmental 

and stratigraphic reconstruction of Sado Basin (Portugal)”. This research work was 

carried out for the fulfillment of International Master in Advanced Clay Science 

(IMACS) degree. This thesis is the outcome of findings of fieldwork and laboratory 

investigations to decipher the paleoenvironmental model and marking of 

stratigraphic boundaries in the tertiary sedimentary sequence of the Sado basin, 

Portugal, using clay minerals assemblage as a valuable tool. This work has been 

divided into two parts. First part is focused on the the marking of stratigraphic 

boundaries between different sedimentary units and second part is concerned 

about the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental model and mechanism of genesis 

of palygorskite in Sado basin. Pimentel, N.L.V. carried out detailed 

sedimentological work on tertiary sequence of Sado Basin in his PhD work “The 

Sado Tertiary Basin. Sedimentological and tectono-sedimentary analysis” (PhD 

Thesis, 1997, University of Lisbon). It also includes the work done before in the 

studied area. We have tried to refine his results by establishing proximal-distal 

facies, marking different lithostratigraphic units as well as giving more detailed 

insights into clay minerals variations and their relationship.

2. Framework of the study area 

2.1.  Location 
The study area falls in the southwestern part of Portugal (Fig.1). The Sado Basin is 

bounded by the Messejana–Plasencia Fault and by two WNW–ESE late 

Hercynean reactivated faults, the Torrao and Grandola Faults (TF and GF, Fig. 2). 

 

Fig. 1- Location of Sado Basin (in brown) and sampling sites (marked with circles) 

in Portugal. 

2.2.  Geology and tectonics 
The Sado Basin is a small Tertiary basin, located in the southwestern area of the 

Iberian Peninsula, which was in connection with the larger Lower Tagus basin (Fig. 

2). The formation and tectono-sedimentary evolution of these basins are related to 

the relative movements between the African and the European lithospheric plates, 

during the alpine orogeny (Tapponier, 1977; Boillot et al., 1984; Uchupi, 1988; De 



PALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL)

Galdeano, 1996). The convergent movement of those plates started in the 

Palaeocene, leading to intense deformation in the western Mediterranean, but only 

in the Eocene the compression was transmitted further west into the Iberian 

Massif. Here, the N–S compression reactivated several originally late Hercynean 

faults, most of them as NE–SW strike-slip sinistral faults. Several tertiary iberian 

basins were then formed, such as the Tagus–Sado Basin between the Portuguese 

Central System and the Messejana–Plasencia Fault (MPF, Fig. 2). The 

Messejana–Plasencia Fault and the two WNW–ESE late Hercynean reactivated 

faults (Torrao and Grandola Faults) acted mainly as dip-slip faults, forming a small 

graben between them, in relation to the first Middle Eocene compressive phases. 

The sedimentary response was the infilling by thick alluvial fan deposits (Vale do 

Guizo Formation). During the Oligocene and Early Miocene, with the rotation of the 

main compression from NE–SW  towards E–W (De Galdeano, 1996), subsidence 

was attenuated and active sedimentation stopped in this basin, restricting the 

Neogene sedimentary record to less than 40 m of Messinean fluvio-marine 

deposits and Piacenzian fluvial sands (Pimentel, 1998b). The Neogene deposits 

lie unconformably and cover most of the Palaeogene, mainly at the SW half of the 

basin, reducing the outcrops for study. The Palaeozoic basement lies at altitudes 

between +100 m and -250 m, showing a general dip towards the SW (with several 

small horsts and grabens), accompanied by an increasing thickness of the 

Palaeogene sequence, from about 20 m (near the Torrao Fault) to a maximum of 

250 m (near the Grandola Fault). There are strong evidences for a syn-

sedimentary origin of this dip, namely the presence at the SW border of the Basin 

of porphyritic basic clasts—with indubitable provenance from the igneous areas 

forming the footwall of the Torrao Fault to the NE (Pimentel, 2002).

2.3. Climate 
According to Köppen (1936) classification, the studied area has temperate climate 

with warm summer (CSa). A small part of the basin has arid climate (BSk) as 

shown in the Fig.3 (Instituto português do mar e da atmosfera).

2.4.  Field Work Program 
Field work was carried out in two steps. First field campaign was done in order to 

have a broader view of the area. Second field trip was focused on the sampling of 

the formations having primarily palygorskite as their main constituents. The 

present work is based on the field data collected by the  field team, comprising the 

author, technical specialist, Joao Manuel Ferreira Ribeiro and field assistant Mr. 

Graça under the co-ordinative guidance of  Prof. Fernando Tavares Rocha.

2.5.  Working Conditions    
The study area is very much easy to access through the  Motorway. Access to the 

interior of field study area is very much easy as well. The network of roads in the 

study area proved to be best access routes for traversing in the investigated area.

3. Sampling and Methodology 
This chapter describes the sampling sites and techniques applied for the 

characterization of samples collected from different parts of Sado basin. 

3.1. Sampling 
 Sampling was carried out in two campaigns. The aim of first campaign was to 

identify the type and relative amount of clay minerals present in the samples. The 

second campaign was more focused on fibrous clay minerals found in Formation 

of Vale do Guizo and Formation of Ervidel. 

3.1.1.  First Field Campaign

3.2.1.  Wet sieving 
Wet sieving was performed to separate the silt-clay fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm) from the 

bulk material. Through the weighting of the obtained fractions, it was also used to 

assess the particle size distribution of the bulk materials. The method was 

developed according to the standard test for particle-size analysis of soils (ASTM, 

2007). After mixing the bulk sample with distilled water, a #230 washing sieve (63 

µm) was placed over a bucket and portions of the suspended sample were 

transferred to the sieve.  

The fine clay was washed through the screen using a squirt bottle, until the wash 

water was clean. The obtained fractions, silt-clay (&amp;lt;63 µm) and sand-gravel (&gt; 63 

µm), were dried (50oC) and after cooled, they were weighted. 

This method was used, rather than dry sieving, because for material that is finer 

than 150 µm, dry sieving can be significantly less accurate. Wet sieving also 

produces an adequate degree of separation between individual fractions. 

Suspending the particles in a suitable liquid allow the transport of fine material 

through the sieve much more efficiently than shaking the dry material. 

Furthermore, it allowed the gentle removal of cementing minerals and particles of 

higher size. These could represent impurities in the material to be studied, 

compromising its quality. 

3.2.2.  Sedimentation 
Clay fraction was obtained from silt-clay fraction using sedimentation according to 

Stokes law. The time for particle settling can be calculated using the following 

equation (Eq. 1): 

 (Eq. 1) 

Where, 

t – time, s; 

h – height of water column, m; 

g – gravitational acceleration, m/s2; 

D – equivalent spherical diameter, m; 

?p – mass density of particle, kg/m

?f – mass density of fluid, kg/m

The sedimentation procedure was carried out as follows: 20 grams of dried less 

than 63 µm fraction was suspended in 1000 ml of distilled water using ultra-sound 

and passed to cylinders (illustrated in Fig. 7). The uppermost 10 cm column of 

suspension was collected after a time period as given in the above table. When 

necessary, antifloculant was added to the suspension. Then, the collected 

suspension was put in the stove to dry at 50oC. The procedure was performed 

several times until the water became clean or the necessary amount of the less 

than 2µm fraction was obtained. The dried sample was grinded in agate mortar 

and stored for further analyses.

3.2.3.  Mineralogical analysis 

3.2.3.1. X-ray diffraction 
Crystalline phases in samples were determined using X-ray diffractometer (XRD). 

Powder x-ray diffractogram was obtained for fraction &amp;lt;63 µm. Clay fraction was 

characterized by preparing oriented slides, which were later treated with glycerol 

and heated for 500o C. The scanning was performed form 4o to 65o 2?, step 0,02o, 

scanning speed 0,02o/s. Sample was analysed using X'Pert-Pro 

MPDPhilips/PANalytical X-ray diffractometer (CuK?; ? = 1.5405 Å) operating at 50 

kV and 30 mA. In the case of clay fraction the scanning was performed from 4o to 

20o. The identification and semi-quantification of peaks was done manually using 

recommendations and given data of Brindley and Brown (1980). 

3.2.3.2. Scanning electron microscope 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a useful technique to study mineralogical 

and textural composition of clay minerals. SEM was used to ascertain the minerals 

found in diffractograms. It was also applied to ascertain the chemical composition 

of specific mineral phases. 

The parameters, which influence the image quality are accelerating voltage, beam 

current and probe current, Bias voltage, working distance, spot size, diaphragm 

size and aperture (Brisset, 2008). In our study, we used a Hitachi S-4100 

Scanning Electron Microscope. Operating voltage was 25kV and working distance

15 mm, carbon coating was applied to the samples to enhance the electron 

emission from their surface. 

3.2.4. Chemical analysis 

3.2.4.1. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 
Chemical analysis for less than 63 µm fraction was performed using X-ray 

fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). Preparation of sample included the mixture of 

10 g of sample with 5 drops of 2% Mowiol® (commercial product of polyvinyl 

alcohol) to improve adhesion and then pressure into platelet applying 15 T of 

pressure for 40 seconds.  Analysis was performed with XRF AxiosPANalytical 

spectrometer equipped with Rh bulb, the gas used - Argon/Methane, data 

processing program – IQ+ (major elements) and Pro-Trace (minor elements). For 

complete chemical analysis loss of ignition (LOI) was also determined by heating 

1g of the sample at 1000o C for 1 hour in furnace. 

3.2.4.2.  Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was applied to study elemental 

analysis for minerals observed in SEM. It allowed us to confirm the type of mineral 

and to calculate its chemical formula. In case of doubts, it helped to identify the 

possible mineral, studying the obtained chemical analysis.  The same Hitachi S-

4100 microscope as for SEM analysis was used for EDS analysis.

5.  Discussion and Conclusion 
The results obtained from XRD, XRF and SEM-EDS analyses are discussed in two 
parts as following: 

1. Lithostratigraphic markers 
2. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction and diagenesis 

 

5.1. Lithostratigraphic markers 
One major application of clay minerals in basin analysis consists of the utilization 
of selected minerals as lithostratigraphic markers allowing the definition of guide-
layers in field sections or in borehole logs. These guide-layers are established on 
the basis of clear anisotropies found out in the lateral or vertical evolution of the 
selected mineralogical parameters. The use of clay minerals as lithostratigraphical 
markers can be announced like a fossil, a mineral or an association of minerals 
can characterize a layer and allow regional correlations (Pomerol, 1987). 

According to Results (I), formation of Esbarrondadoiro can be divided into two 
units based on bulk sample analysis and clay size fraction analysis. 

1.  Formation of Esbarrondadoiro Unit (I). This unit (samples S5, S6, S7, S8) 
consists of phyllosilicate + quartz + K-feldspar + plagioclase. In the clay size 
fraction, this unit is characterized by the clay mineral assemblage of 
kaolinite + illite with very minor amounts of smectite and mixed layers KS.    

2. Formation of Esbarrondadoiro Unit (II). This unit (sample S9) consists of 
less phyllosilicate + high quartz + high K-feldspar + high plagioclase + small 
amount of opal, calcite and dolomite. In clay size fraction, this unit can be 
distinguished with the more proportional ratio of kaolinite and illite minerals.

Esbarrondadoiro.

1.  Formation of Ervidel Unit (I). It contains phyllosilicate + quartz + K-feldspar 
+ plagioclase + opal + carbonates (calcite/dolomite) with minor amount of 
hematite/pyrite. The samples (S1, S2, S3, SG1, SG2 and SG3) are 
relatively poor in phyllosilicate and rich in carbonates &gt;10% (calcite or/and 
dolomite).  

2. Formation of Ervidel Unit (II). This unit consists of samples (S4, SG4, SG5, 
SG6 and SG7) which are relatively richer in phyllosilicate, they are very 
poor in carbonates.

In clay size fraction, this formation contains palygorskite, illite, smectite, chlorite, 
kaolinite and mixed layers KS or/and CS. 

The bulk sample analysis (from Results(I) and (II) ) reveals that Formation of Vale 
do Guizo consists of phyllosilicate, quartzs, K-feldspar, plagioclase, varying 
content of carbonates (calcite, dolomite) with minor amount of opal, anatase, 
hematite, pyrite and magnesite in some samples. Based on mineralogical 
associations, two units are distinguished here as following: 

1. Formation of Vale do Guizo Unit (I). The samples (S10, S11, S12, S13, 
SG11, SG12 and SG14) are relatively rich in phyllosilicate and poor in 
terms of carbonates. 

2. Formation Vale do Guizo Unit (II). The samples (SG8, SG9, SG10 and 
SG13) are relatively rich in carbonates (calcite or/and dolomite) and 
poor in phyllosilicate. 

 
In clay size fraction, Formation of Vale do Guizo contains palygorskite, smectite, 
chlorite, illite, kaolinite with small quantity of mixed layer KS.

The mean value for Kubler index and Biscaye’s Index increases downward with 
the chronological order (Table 1). The younger Miocene formation, Formation of 
Esbarrandodairo has the least mean Kubler index value (1.8) whereas the more 
older formations, Formations of Ervidel and Vale do Guizo have the mean Kubler 
index values of 3.4 and 3.8 respectively showing that  there are more diagenetic 
imprints on the older formations. 

 

5.2.  Paleoenvironment 
A schematic sedimentary model for palygorskite formation is given in Figure 17 
that shows a cross section where the transition from an alluvial fan environment to 
a palustrine–lacustrine one can be observed, taking into account the presence of a 
source area comprised igneous and metamorphic rocks and the interaction of 
three water types: groundwater, runoff and lacustrine water. The rocky substrate of 
the parent area is fundamental in order to justify inputs of Mg or Si. The silica input 
can come from any magmatic rock, particularly those with a felsic composition, or 
from silica-rich metamorphic rocks and siliciclastic or biosiliceous (diatomite) 
sedimentary rocks. The Mg source can be any type of rock containing Mg-rich 
minerals, including magmatic rock (basalt, gabbro and peridotite), metamorphic 
rock (slate, serpentinite) or sedimentary rock (dolomite, magnesite and magnesian 
clays). The Si and Mg released in these zones can travel distances and 
accumulate in flooded lacustrine zones. Given its low solubility except with very 
alkaline pH levels, aluminium will tend to be less mobile and remain in the vicinity

of its parent rock area, or it may be transported as sediment in aluminous clay 
particles or colloids. Phenomena occurring in the parent rock area can favour the 
formation of aluminous clay minerals and the release of Mg and Si, which would 
favour palygorskite formation in lacustrine conditions, mainly by transformation. 
Detrital aluminous clay minerals are abundant in distal alluvial fan facies. 
Palygorskite may be formed there as the result of the transformation of the 
inherited aluminous clays in the vicinity of a lacustrine environment, particularly 
during periods of exposure. This process favours calcite precipitation. In areas 
nearest to a lake, more specifically in the zone containing intertidal mudflats where 
the water is more alkaline, the transformation of aluminous smectite into saponite 
would be favoured instead of forming palygorskite.

5.3.  Genesis of palygorskite in Formation of Vale do Guizo 
The mineralogical and chemical data suggest that palygorskite has been formed 
by transformation of smectite into palygorskite as it is evident by the inverse 
relationship between two minerals (further study of samples through transmission 
electron microscopy is needed to show the step by step the transformation 
phases). Samples S11, S12, S13, S14, SG11, SG12 and SG14 belong to the 



PALEOENVIRONMENTAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SADO BASIN (PORTUGAL) 

35 
 

alluvial fan facies. Samples SG8, SG9, SG10 and SG13 which are rich in 
carbonates can be attributed to distal facies (SG13, having calcite as major 
carbonate) and lacustrine-palustrine environment (SG8, SG9, SG10,having 
dolomite as major carbonate ). 

It is interesting to note that an inverse relationship can be established between 
smectite and palygorskite content (Fig. 18). 

 

 

Fig. 18- Relationship between palygorskite and smectite content in the studied 
samples from Formation of Vale do Guizo, Sado basin. 

 

5.4. Genesis of Palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel  
The formation of palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel seems to have been evolved 
from the transformation of illite into palygorskite as described for palygorskite 
deposit in Torrejon, Spain (Galan et al., 1975; Galan &amp;amp; Castillo, 1984), by 
degradation of schist illite and chlorite under acid conditions, and subsequent Mg 
fixing in the basin in an alkaline environment. Samples S4, SG4, SG5, SG6 and 
SG7 belong to the alluvial fan facies. Samples S1, S2, S3, SG1 and SG2 which 
are rich in carbonates can be attributed to distal facies and lacustrine-palustrine 
environment (SG3) having dolomite as major carbonate. 

It is interesting to note here that an inverse relationship can be established 
between palygorskite and illite amount in this formation instead of palygorskite and 
smectite content as in Formation of Vale do Guizo (Fig. 19).

Fig. 19- Relationship between palygorskite and illite content in the studied 
samples from Formation of Ervidel, Sado basin. 

The presence of palygorskite in Formation of Ervidel and Formation of Vale do 
Guizo is evident of arid to semi arid paleoclimate with the installation of small 
mudflats in the middle of basin during the time of deposition of these formations 
during Eocene. The typical fluvial fan system progrades to western part of the 
basin into palustrine environment.
