A structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, 
Araneae) in natural and artificial forest gaps at Porto 
Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia
Alexandre B. BONALDO1 , Sidclay C. DIAS2 

ABSTRACT
A preliminary survey of the spider fauna in natural and artificial forest gap formations at “Porto Urucu”, a petroleum/natural gas 
production facility in the Urucu river basin, Coari, Amazonas, Brazil is presented. Sampling was conducted both occasionally and 
using a protocol composed of a suite of techniques: beating trays (32 samples), nocturnal manual samplings (48), sweeping nets 
(16), Winkler extractors (24), and pitfall traps (120). A total of 4201 spiders, belonging to 43 families and 393 morphospecies, 
were collected during the dry season, in July, 2003. Excluding the occasional samples, the observed richness was 357 species. In 
a performance test of seven species richness estimators, the Incidence Based Coverage Estimator (ICE) was the best fit estimator, 
with 639 estimated species. To evaluate differences in species richness associated with natural and artificial gaps, samples from 
between the center of the gaps up to 300 meters inside the adjacent forest matrix were compared through the inspection of the 
confidence intervals of individual-based rarefaction curves for each treatment. The observed species richness was significantly higher 
in natural gaps combined with adjacent forest than in the artificial gaps combined with adjacent forest. Moreover, a community 
similarity analysis between the fauna collected under both treatments demonstrated that there were considerable differences 
in species composition. The significantly higher abundance of Lycosidae in artificial gap forest is explained by the presence of 
herbaceous vegetation in the gaps themselves. Ctenidae was significantly more abundant in the natural gap forest, probable due 
to the increase of shelter availability provided by the fallen trees in the gaps themselves. Both families are identified as potential 
indicators of environmental change related to the establishment or recovery of artificial gaps in the study area.

Inventário estruturado de aranhas (Arachnida, Araneae) em clareiras 
naturais e artificiais em Porto Urucu, Amazônia Ocidental Brasileira
RESUMO

Apresenta-se um inventário preliminar da fauna de aranhas em clareiras naturais e artificiais em “Porto Urucu”, uma instalação 
produtora de petróleo e gás natural na bacia do Rio Urucu, Coari, Amazonas, Brasil. As amostras foram realizadas de modo ocasional 
e com um protocolo estruturado composto por um conjunto de técnicas de amostragem: guarda-chuvas entomológicos (32 amostras), 
amostras manuais noturnas (48), rede de varredura (16), extratores de Winkler (24) e armadilhas de queda (120). Um total de 4201 
aranhas pertencentes a 43 famílias e 393 morfoespécies foi coletado durante a estação seca em julho de 2003. Excluindo as amostras 
ocasionais, a riqueza observada foi de 357 espécies. No teste de desempenho de sete estimadores, ICE (Incidence Based Coverage 
Estimator) gerou o melhor resultado, com 639 espécies estimadas. Para avaliar diferenças na riqueza de espécies associadas a clareiras 
naturais e artificiais, conjuntos de amostras do centro da clareira a até 300 m adentro da floresta adjacente foram comparados através da 
inspeção dos intervalos de confiança de curvas de rarefação baseadas no número de indivíduos de cada tratamento. A riqueza observada 
foi significantemente maior nas clareiras naturais combinadas com as florestas adjacentes do que nas clareiras artificiais combinadas 
com as matas do entorno. Além disso, uma análise de similaridade entre as faunas coletadas em ambos os tratamentos mostrou que 
existe diferenças consideráveis na composição de espécies. A abundância significativamente mais alta de Lycosidae nas florestas de 
clareiras artificiais é explicada pela presença de vegetação herbácea nas clareiras propriamente ditas. Ctenidae foi significantemente 
mais abundante nas florestas de clareiras naturais, provavelmente devido ao aumento da disponibilidade de abrigos causado pela 
queda de árvores nas clareiras propriamente ditas. Ambas estas famílias são identificadas como potenciais indicadores de mudanças 
ambientais relacionadas com o estabelecimento ou recuperação de clareiras artificiais na área de estudo.

A structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and 
artificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia

INTRODUCTION
Structured inventories of spider communities have 

been implemented on a regular basis in Amazon Basin only 
recently (Silva, 1992, 1996). Despite the fact that several 
such initiatives have been conducted in Brazilian Amazonia 
during the last 10 years, only two papers dealing with spider 
community structure have been published so far. Borges &amp;amp; 
Brescovit (1996) provided data from two western Amazonian 
localities, The “Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentado 
Mamirauá” and “Boca do Sumaúma”, both near Tefé, State 
of Amazonas. Höfer &amp;amp; Brescovit (2001) presented results of a 
long term spider inventory carried out at the “Reserva Florestal 
Adolfo Ducke” (RFAD), Manaus, Amazonas.

Porto Urucu, the locality addressed in this paper, is 
practically unknown regarding the composition of its spider 
communities. Only six spider species from that area were 
recorded in the literature so far. The Ctenids Centroctenus 
auberti (Caporiacco), Ctenus inaja Hofer, Brescovit &amp;amp; Gasnier, 
Ctenus villasboasi Mello-Leitão, Cupiennius celerrimus Simon 
and Ancylometes rufus (Walckenaer) were reported by Brescovit 
(1996), Höfer et al. (1994), Brescovit &amp;amp; Eickstedt (1995) and 
Höfer &amp;amp; Brescovit (2000). A single species has Porto Urucu 
as its type locality, Rhoicinus urucu (Trechaleidae), described 
by Brescovit &amp;amp; Oliveira (1994) on specimens collected 
occasionally in bromeliads during a floristic and herpetological 
inventory carried out in early 1990s. 

The study area is located nearly 600 kilometers southwest 
Manaus and harbors an oil/gas exploitation facility established 
in the 1980s. One of the most conspicuous results of this 
intervention is the creation of deforestation gaps in the 
dry land forest matrix to allow activities related to probing, 
establishing and operating petroleum and gas wells. These gaps 
are opened for several specific purposes, such as helicopter 
landing, drilling of wells and assembling of equipment for 
oil/gas extraction and transferring. One of the most common 
kinds of artificial gaps in Porto Urucu is the so called “Jazidas” 
(here termed JAZ gaps), represented by the gaps assigned 
for the aerial deposit of soil and raw materials for highway 
construction, typically located near the margins of the roads. 
These clear-cut, soil-compacted areas are probably the most 
distinct artificial gaps in the study area. 

In order to access the spider assemblages in both natural 
and artificial forest gaps, as well as in the dry land forest matrix 
adjacent to those gaps, we compared a set of high impacted 
JAZ gaps, each one from five to seven years in age, and a 
set of natural forest gaps, formed by the natural fall of old 
trees. This paper reports a first attempt to describe the spider 
communities under these novel environmental conditions 
and provides the following preliminary data on the Urucu 
spider community structure as well as on the impact of oil/
gas exploitation activities in the spider fauna of the study area: 

(1) a general checklist, including data on species composition 
obtained both occasionally and using a structured inventory; 
(2) a characterization of the differences in species richness 
and composition of the spider fauna present in both artificial 
and natural forest gaps formations; (3) comparisons between 
the performance of several richness species estimators and; 
(4) suggestions of appropriate environmental indicator taxa 
for both establishment and recovery of artificial gaps in the 
study area.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

STUDY AREA

“Porto Urucu” is a 54000 ha petroleum/natural gas 
production unity in the right margin of Urucu River, Solimões 
river basin, State of Amazonas, Brazil (4° 53’S, 65° 20’W). 
Regional climate is classified as “Afi” by the Köppen system, 
with the rainy season between September and April, and the 
dry season between May and August (RADAM-BRASIL, 
1978). The main forest formation in Porto Urucu is “terra 
firme” (dry land) associated with lowlands and plateaus as 
described by Ribeiro et al. (1999) and cut by small creeks 
(“Igarapés”), tributaries of the Urucu River. Three main creeks 
are located in the study area (Lontra, Tartaruga and Marta 
creeks). Natural gaps are formations produced in the forest 
matrix from fallen trees or large branches from the canopy, 
exposing the forest ground to direct solar radiation. The 
natural forest gaps sampled were coded as NAT1 (04º 51’17.7’’ 
S, 65º 04’14.4’’W), NAT2 (04º 51’22.5’’ S, 65º 04’16.2’’W), 
NAT3 (04º 51’35.8’’ S 65º 04’ 16.7’’W) and NAT9 (04º 
53’42’’S, 65º 11’18’’W). All artificial forest gaps sampled 
were originated from the construction or maintenance of the 
Porto Urucu road network, named JAZ 19 (04º 52’07’’S, 
65º 15’53’’W), JAZ 40 (04º 52’36’’S, 65º 09’05’’W), JAZ 
46 (04º 53’04’’S, 65º 09’12’’W) and JAZ 55 (04º 49’33’’S, 
65º 01’50’’W).  

COLLECTING
The data presented here were obtained in a single 

expedition carried out in July, 2003. Five methods were used 
to access the spider fauna; pitfall traps, Winkler extractors, 
beating trays, sweep-net and nocturnal hand searches, during 
13 days by three collectors. The samples were obtained from 
both the center and the edge of a given forest gap, as well as 
inside the forest immediately associated with the gap, until 
300 meters from gap edge. The edge of a given forest gap was 
roughly defined as a ten meters wide band circling the gap. 
Sweeping was performed only in the center of each forest 
gap and the nocturnal hand search was not applied in the 
gap edges. There was a total of 120 pitfall trap samples (60 
in the natural forests gap and 60 in the artificial forests gap),

A structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and 
artificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia

24 Winkler extractor samples (three by area), 32 beating tray 
samples, 16 samples of sweep-net and 48 samples of nocturnal 
collections, were obtained. Pitfall traps were used to access 
the litter-dwelling spiders. Each trap, composed of a 500 ml 
plastic cup of 10cm diameter buried to the level of the soil, 
was placed at least 5 meters apart one from another. Alcohol 
(80° proof ) was used as the preserving liquid.  

EstimateS software 7.5 (Colwell, 2006).  Differences in species 
richness in both JAZ and NAT communities (defined as 
those under the influence of either artificial or naturals forest 
gaps) were visualized through the inspection of the 95% 
confidence intervals of individual-based rarefaction curves 
calculated using EcoSim 7 (Gotelli &amp;amp; Entsminger, 2001). 
Kulczynski’s (sensu Toti et al., 2000) and SØrensen’s index of 
similarity were used to compare the composition of species 
in the two communities (Wolda, 1981; Krebs, 1999). To 
test the normality of the abundance data of Ctenidae and 
Lycosidae using the total sum of individuals (juveniles and 
adults) present in each JAZ and NAT samples, the Lilliefors 
test was implemented in BioEstat 4.0 (Ayres et al., 2005). As 
the Ctenidae data set was homocedastic and the Lycosidae one 
was heterocedastic, Student´s T test and Mann-Whitney tests 
were used respectively, also through BioEstat 4.0, to verify the 
differences in abundance of these families in both artificial 
and natural gap forests. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

ASSEMBLAGE COMPOSITION

The samples obtained in Porto Urucu from both natural and 
artificial forest gaps, together with those obtained occasionally in 
the vicinities of the Lontra and Tartaruga creeks, produced 4201 
spiders, belonging to 43 families. The most abundant family was 
Ctenidae, with 714 specimens, followed by Araneidae, Lycosidae, 
Theridiidae and Salticidae, each one accounting for between 
400 to 500 individuals. These five families represented 58.3% 
of all spiders collected. Seven families were recorded by only 
one specimen (Clubionidae, Dictynidae, Hahniidae, Idiopidae, 
Nephilidae, Paratropididae and Tetrablemmidae) and three were 
represented by two specimens each (Cyrtaucheniidae, Hersiliidae 
and Palpimanidae) (see Fig. 1 for data on abundance per family).

Beating trays were used to access shrub-dwelling spiders 
during the day. Each beating tray was comprised of a 0,80m2 
cotton white sheet. Nocturnal hand searches were modified 
from the “looking up – looking down” method proposed by 
Coddington et al. (1991). More detailed descriptions of these 
methods are avaliable in Coddington et al. (1991) and Brescovit et 
al. (2002, 2004). The samples combined across each methodology 
were the results of: one pitfall trap exposed by 10 days, one square 
meter litter (sifted and included in Winkler extractors for 3 days), 
one hour of beating per collector, one hour of sweeping per 
collector and, one hour of nocturnal hand search per collector, 
inside an area of 300m2. To improve the taxonomic list of the 
study area, we also performed occasional samplings in the margins 
of the Lontra and Tartaruga creeks. These occasional samplings 
were carried out using time-independent foliage beating during 
the day and time and area-free hand searching at night. Voucher 
specimens were deposited in the arachnological collections of 
Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, Belém (MPEG).

STATISTICAL PROCEDURES

Sample intensity (SI) was defined as the ratio of adults 
to species (Coddington et al., 1996). Seven non-parametric 
estimators of species richness (Chao 1, 2, Jackknife 1, 2, 
Bootstrap, ACE and ICE) were used in order to verify which 
richness estimators fit best to the present data set. Detailed 
descriptions of these algorithms are available in Colwell &amp;amp; 
Coddington (1994), Toti et al. (2000) and Colwell (2006). To 
reduce the influence of the sample order, 100 randomizations 
of sample sequence were made for each sample increment 
(Coddington et al. 1996). This analysis was performed using 

Figure 1 - Number of individuals per family collected in Porto Urucu, Coari, 
Amazonas, Brazil. Families with less than 20 individuals were grouped as 
“others”.

A structured inventory of spiders (Arachnida, Araneae) in natural and 
artificial forest gaps at Porto Urucu, Western Brazilian Amazonia

Considering only the adult spiders collected, the number 
of families represented in the samples decreases to 37, as 
Idiopidae, Paratropididae, Tetrablemmidae (represented by 
singletons), Cyrtaucheniidae (two individuals), Gnaphosidae 
(five) and Zodariidae (11) were represented only by 
unidentifiable juveniles. The observed richness was 393 species 
or morphospecies, represented by 1612 adults (38.3% of 
all spiders collected). From all the recognized species, only 
47 were identified to species level, highlighting the poor 
taxonomic knowledge of the Western Brazilian Amazonia 
spiders. Only four of these species were previously reported to 
occur in Porto Urucu. Two remaining species reported to the 
study area in the taxonomic literature, Cupiennius celerrimus 
and Rhoicinus urucu, were not re-collected.  

The sampling intensity was only four individuals per 
species, a low value when compared with the figures obtained 
in structured inventories in North America (e.g. Coddington 
et al., 1996, Appalachian Mountains, SI = 18.3) and Europe 
(e.g. Scharff et al., 2003, Denmark, SI = 132). However, low 
sampling intensity values are common in inventories carried 
out in tropical sites, such as those reported by Coddington et 
al. (1991) (Bolivia, three localities, SI &amp;lt;5), and even in some 

sub-tropical sites, as reported by Bonaldo et al. (2007) (State 
of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; SI = 10.4, but inflated by the 
inclusion of identifiable juveniles in the calculation; SI = 8.8, 
excluding the identifiable juveniles and few species identified 
only by juveniles). The number of species represented by 
singletons was 167. Thus, the inventory completeness, defined 
by Coddington et al. (1996) as the percentage of species 
represented by singletons, is still high (42.5% of all recognized 
species). This is another indication that this preliminary 
inventory is far from complete.  

In terms of number of species, the richer families were 
Theridiidae (68 spp.), Salticidae (60 spp.) and Araneidae (57 
spp.), confirming the general pattern observed in Neotropical 
ecosystems (Silva, 1992). Table 2 depicts the species and 
morphospecies recorded in Porto Urucu, with the number of 
individuals collected by sampled area. The occasional sampling 
in the Igarapés Marta and Tartaruga added 36 species to the 
list, mainly representatives of Pholcidae and Trechaleidae. At 
least some of these species are characteristically found near 
water, as in the case of several Trechaleidae and some Pisauridae 
(Höfer &amp;amp; Brescovit, 2001).

Excluding the occasional sampling, 3414 individuals 
were recorded in both artificial and natural forest gap areas. 
The 1321 adult specimens were identified as comprising 357 
species or morphospecies recorded in 218 valid samples. To 
provide an indication of the total species richness present in 
the study site, the results of seven species richness estimators 
are made available for entire Porto Urucu dataset (Fig. 2). The 
estimates ranged from 662 species (Jackknife 2) to 435 species 
(Bootstrap). However, these results must be viewed cautiously 

because the inventory is not complete. Walther &amp;amp; Moore 
(2005) stressed that each estimator has been developed to work 
best under the assumptions defined by a specific population 
model, which defines the population structure resulting from 
various community parameters. Thus, performance tests 
always must be carried out in order to verify which estimator 
fits best to the particular conditions of each inventory. 

Toti et al. (2000), in testing a spider assemblage’s database, 
indicated that a good way to test the performance of a given 
estimator is to inspect visually the shape of the curve, looking 
for trends toward the asymptote. The best estimators would be

those which need less information to approach stability. In the 
case here presented, no estimator reached a clear asymptote; 
but after applying the above procedure, we verified that ICE 
was the best fit estimator to this data set, characterized by 
large numbers of singletons and uniques. ICE (incidence-
based coverage estimator) is based on the proportion of 
species presented in the samples, relies on presence/absence 
data to quantify rarity and retrieves information from species 
represented by up to 10 individuals (Toti et al., 2000; Colwell, 
2006). The preferred estimated number, produced by ICE, 
was 639 species. This is the second larger estimate, being 
surpassed only by Jackknife 2. However, it is not an absurd 
prediction because the only spider inventory from a nearby 
locality available to comparison, the one provided by Höfer 
&amp;amp; Brescovit (2001) for the RFAD, reported an observed (or 
minimal) species richness of 506 species. 

Inspecting the individual-based rarefaction curves for 
both JAZ and NAT communities (Fig. 3) at the point that 
a comparison is possible (565th individual added), JAZ 
accumulated 196 species, while NAT accumulated 228 
species. These differences are significant given the calculated 
confidence interval (?= 0.05). The rarefaction curve for 
NAT reached a higher species richness with fewer specimens 
than the JAZ curve, which needed to add 712 individuals to 
accumulate only 224 species at the end of data entry. 

The values of the similarity indices for the JAZ and 
NAT communities were 0,34 and 0,48 for Kulczynski’s and 
Sørensen’s indexes, respectively. At the end of the observed 
sample-based accumulation curves, the samples related to 
natural forest gaps produced 239 species, while 230 species 
were recorded from the samples related to artificial forest 
gaps. Despite this apparently similar observed richness, only 
112 species were common to these two treatments. Both 

indices above depicted considerable differences regarding 
spider species composition between these two communities. 
The differences between the two kinds of communities were 
detectable, even considering that the collecting effort was less 
intense in the center of both kinds of gaps than in its forested 
edges and adjacent forest matrix. In the natural forest gaps 
of Porto Urucu, the composition of the plant communities 
does not differ greatly from that of the original forest matrix, 
but the artificial forest gaps present more herbaceous and 
pioneers plants (Lima Filho et al. 2001). It is possible that the 
differences depicted in species richness and composition of 
species among the two spider communities reflect responses 
to differences in physiognomy and plant species composition 
of the gaps themselves, revealing a differential influence of the 
presence of each kind of gap in the forest matrix. 

LYCOSIDAE AND CTENIDAE AS ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS   

Comparing the families represented by more than 400 
individuals (Fig. 4), a Mann Whitney test analyzing differences 
in abundance of Lycosidae in natural versus artificial forest gaps 
areas show that representatives of this family are much more 
abundant in JAZ areas than in NAT areas (U= 0; p= 0.0209). 
On the other hand, T test show that Ctenidae was more 
abundant in NAT than in JAZ areas (t= 3.289; p= 0.0166).

The great abundance of Ctenidae in NAT areas could be 
explained by a putative increase of suitable ground shelters 
for these spiders, provided in the center of the NAT gaps 
by the fallen trees. In fact, the gap centers contributed 202 
individuals out of the 395 collected in NAT areas (51%). 
However, the results of the T test could be biased by the rarity 
of Ctenidae in the center of the JAZ gaps (only 31 out of all 
179 individuals in JAZ, or 17%).

The large number of representatives of the family Lycosidae 
(N= 432) is an unusual result for tropical rain forest sites. 
From all individuals collected in Porto Urucu, 417 were from 
JAZ communities and only 15 were from NAT areas or from 
the surroundings of the creeks. Moreover, except for eight 
specimens from the adjacent forest matrix, all specimens of 
Lycosidae obtained in JAZ areas were collected in the gaps 
themselves. Jocqué &amp;amp; Alderweireldt (2005) stated that lycosids 
are consistently more abundant in areas covered by herbaceous 
layer, which is negatively correlated with the degree of canopy 
closure. In Porto Urucu, the natural forest gaps are surrounded 
by the primary forest and the canopy discontinuity is small. 
On the other hand, the artificial forest gaps represent a large 
canopy discontinuity, where in some areas, only herbaceous 
plants are present. 

The explosive abundance of Lycosidae in artificial gaps, 
combined with its extreme rarity in the wider forest matrix 
qualifies it as an excellent environmental indicator of forest 
degraded areas. The incidence and relative abundance of 
Ctenidae could be also monitored, providing a complementary 
indicator of recovering gap areas. 

RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES IN PORTO URUCU

The continuity of the project “Dinâmica de clareiras sob 
impacto da exploração petrolífera” (DICLA), which aims to 
address some fundamental questions involving community 
dynamics in artificial gaps in Porto Urucu, allowed us to 
considerably increase the sampling effort in the study area. 
Since 2005, further studies on the spider fauna were carried 
out as part of the second author's PhD project. This project 
applied a sampling protocol designed to maximize the 
acquiring of data related to spider fauna dynamics in artificial 
forest gaps with various degrees of regeneration, grouping gaps 
in three blocks, each one with high sample representation 

levels. Several occasional and fogging samples, as well as 
nearly 800 samples from a protocol composed by beating tray, 
nocturnal hand search and Winkler extractors, are available 
from this study. Adding information from these samples to the 
present dataset may help to better quantify the environmental 
impact of the artificial gaps in the spider communities present 
in the forest matrix of Porto Urucu.
