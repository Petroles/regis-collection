BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON A DWARF MINKE WHALE,
BALAENOPTERA ACUTOROSTRATA, CAUGHT IN SOUTHERN BRAZILIAN WATERS,

WITH A NEW RECORD OF PREY FOR THE SPECIES

Eduardo R. Secchi 1, 2, *, Lauro Barcellos 1, Alexandre N. Zerbini 1, 3 and Luciano Dalla Rosa 1

Abstract – In the late austral spring, a 3.43m long immature male dwarf minke whale (Balaenoptera accutorostrata) was accidentally
caught in a gillnet set in waters 143m deep, close to the continental slope off southern Brazil. A brief description of the specimen,
including external measurements, colour patterns, reproductive status and skull measurements, is presented. The stomach was full
of the euphausiid, Euphausia similis, and was heavily infested by anisakid nematode parasites. Euphausia similis is reported for the
first time as a prey species for dwarf minke whales.

Resumo – Durante a primavera austral, um macho imaturo de baleia-minke-anã, Balaenoptera accutorostrata, medindo 3,43m, foi
capturado acidentalmente em uma rede de emalhe armada em águas de 143m de profundidade, nas proximidades do talude
continental sul do Brasil. Se descreve, brevemente, aspectos biológicos do exemplar, incluindo medidas externas, padrões de coloração,
estágio reprodutivo e medidas cranianas. O estômago estava repleto de eufausiáceos, Euphausia similis, e infestado por parasitas
nematóides. Este é o primeiro registro de Euphausia similis como presa de baleia-minke-anã.

Keywords: Dwarf minke whales, Western South Atlantic, bycatch, euphausiids, parasites, colour pattern.

Until recently, the minke whale was considered to be a
single species, Balaenoptera acutorostrata, originally
described from the northeastern Atlantic Ocean but
considered to have a circumglobal distribution in
northern and southern hemispheres. In the mid 1980s,
two forms were recognised in the Southern Hemisphere
based primarily on body and baleen colouration as well
as some biological parameters (Best, 1985; Arnold et al.,
1987). The first form corresponded to Balaenoptera
bonaerensis, described from Argentina by Burmeister
(1865), and documented from commercial whaling
catches in the Antarctic (Williamson, 1959; Kasuya and
Ichihara, 1965; Doroshenko, 1979), South Africa (Best,
1982) and Brazil (da Rocha and Braga, 1982). Despite
earlier skepticism, B. bonaerensis has now generally been
recognised as a valid species, referred to as the Antarctic
minke whale (Rice, 1998; IWC, 2001). The second form
was a previously unrecognised diminutive form, now
more popularly called the dwarf minke whale. Based on
both morphological (Best, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987;
Zerbini and Simões-Lopes, 2000) and molecular (Wada
et al., 1991; Pastene et al., 1994) data, the dwarf minke
whale has been considered more closely related to the
Northern Hemisphere B .  a c u t o r o s t r a t a  than to the
Antarctic minke whale, but its taxonomic status remains
unclear, pending further study (IWC, 2001).
The dwarf minke whale has been reported near all
continents of  the Southern Hemisphere (see Baker, 1983;
Best, 1985; Marsh, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987; Baldas and
Castello, 1986; Zerbini et al., 1996; Arnold, 1997), as well
as in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters (Kato et al. 1990,
Kasamatsu et al., 1993; Aguayo, 1994). The southernmost
record of this species was based on one animal sighted
during winter at 69o25’S (Aguayo, 1994). In Brazil,

sightings are rare, but dwarf minke whale records
represent about 75% of all minke whale strandings
(Zerbini et al., 1996).
Although some biological data were collected from
individuals caught during commercial (da Rocha and
Braga, 1982; Best, 1985) and scientific whaling (Kato et al.,
1990), or through accidental capture (Marsh, 1985; Arnold
et al., 1987), the biology of the dwarf minke whale remains
poorly documented.  In this report, we present new
information based on a fresh specimen, accidentally caught
in fishing gear.

Specimen description and discussion

On 25 November 1992, a 3.43m long young male dwarf
minke whale (Fig. 1) was incidentally caught in a gillnet
set for sharks at a depth of 143m. The net was 6,000m
long and 4m high, with 30cm stretched mesh size. The
capture occurred south of Rio Grande (33o35’66”S -
51o29’80”W), Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil.
It is not known, however, whether the animal was caught
when the net was set at the bottom or during the setting/
h a u l i n g  p r o c e d u r e .  T h e  a n i m a l  w a s  b r o u g h t  b y
fishermen and landed while still fresh at a fishing facility
of Rio Grande. Subsequently, the whale was transported
to the Museu Oceanográfico “Prof. Eliézer C. Rios”, where
i t  w a s  d i s s e c t e d .  E x t e r n a l  c o l o u r  p a t t e r n s  w e r e
examined, organs were collected and weighed, stomach
contents, including parasites, were preserved. After
cleaning and preparation, the skeleton was deposited
in the marine mammal collection (MORG 0096) of the
Museu Oceanográfico.

External morphology and colouration: External measurements
and some organ weights are presented in Table 1.

LAJAM 2(2): 109-115, July/December 2003

Measurements were comparable to dwarf minke whales
from other regions (Best, 1985; Arnold et al., 1987). The
more anterior position of the dorsal fin observed in the
present specimen support the hypothesis that this
feature may have taxonomic value to distinguish the
dwarf minke whale from other minke whale types.
Colour patterns were also similar to the ones described
for the dwarf minke whale by Best (1985) and Arnold et
al. (1987). The base of the flippers was white and
connected to a nearly rounded white blaze on the
shoulder (Fig.1a). The dark pigmentation extended from
the back onto the area between the eyes and the anterior
insertion of the flipper, continuing as a dark throat patch
which covered the ten uppermost ventral grooves just
under and behind the angle of the mouth (Fig.1a).
However, this specimen presented a striking dark lateral
wave-like patch located in the flank of the whale (Fig.1a),
extending from just before the anterior insertion of the
dorsal fin almost to the ventral grooves (Fig.1b).  A similar
feature was observed in another young dwarf minke
whale collected in Australia (Paterson, 1994).
Not all baleen plates were kept so an accurate count can
not be provided. The colour of the preserved plates was
similar to the ones reported for dwarf minke whales
collected in South Africa and Australia (Best, 1985;
Arnold et al., 1987). Most plates were light yellowish and
a few presented a narrow external dark border. This
border’s breadth corresponded to up to 5% of the width
of the plate.

Skeleton: Cranial measurements are presented in Table
2, while pictures of the skull were illustrated by Zerbini
et al. (1996, Fig.3). The following cranial characters were
observed in the present specimen: the parietals were
incorporated in the vertex and were in contact with the
interparietal. The latter was exposed and presented a
somewhat rhomboidal shape. The anterior border of
the supraoccipital was curved posteriorly in the midline
of the skull and the hamular process of the pterigoyds
was narrow and elongated. These were previously
d e s c r i b e d  a s  d i a g n o s t i c  f o r  d w a r f  m i n k e  w h a l e s
(Arnold et al., 1987; Zerbini and Simões-Lopes, 2000).
T h e  v e r t e b r a l  f o r m u l a  w a s  C 7 - T 1 1 - L 1 0 - C a 1 8 .  T h e
vertebral epiphyses were not fused.

Reproductive status: The testes were very small. Both
measured 9.3cm of length and were clearly undeveloped.
The size of the specimen, i.e. 3.43m, and external analysis
of the testes indicated its immature status. Information
from animals caught in whaling activities suggests that
male dwarf minke whales reach sexual maturity at
approximately 6m (e.g. Best, 1985; Kato, 1991).

Parasite infestation: Despite the small size of this animal,
its stomach was heavily infested by at least two nematode
s p e c i e s  o f  t h e  g e n e r a  A n i s a k i s  ( a b o u t  3 % )  a n d
Pseudoterranova (about 97%). Further analyses, including
molecular methods, may help determine the species
identification of these nematodes. No parasites were
found either in the intestines or any other organ though

no fine search was performed. The genus Anisakis has also
been found in the stomach of an adult dwarf minke whale
stranded in New Zealand (Dawson and Slooten, 1990).
Studies on North Pacific minke whales (Araki et al., 1997)
and Antarctic minke whales (Dailey and Vogelbein, 1991)
indicated only Anisakis in the stomachs. There is an early
record of Pseudoterranova decipiens  from Northern
Hemisphere minke whales (from Delyamure, in Tomilin,
1967) but the accuracy of this information is uncertain
given the complex taxonomy of Anisakidae parasites.
Nematode parasites of the family Anisakidae, including
the genera Anisakis, Contracaecum, Pseudoterranova (=
Terranova, Phocanema, Porrocaecum) are composed of
s e v e r a l  c o m p l e x e s  o f  s i b l i n g  s p e c i e s  a n d  a r e  t h e
nematodes most commonly reported from the stomachs
of cetaceans (Dailey, 2001). Heavy infections of these
parasites rarely cause clinical signs, but can result in
gastritis and ulceration (Dailey, 2001).

Diet: The stomach was almost full of Euphausia similis,
suggesting that dwarf minke whales may wean at much
smaller sizes than Antarctic minke whales, given that
the latter measure approximately 2.8m at birth. This
e u p h a u s i i d  i s  c o n s i d e r e d  a n  i m p o r t a n t  p r e y  f o r
balaenopterid whales (Kawamura, 1980). Despite the
extensive review on the food of baleen whales around
the world (Kawamura, 1980) and specifically in the
Southern Ocean (Kawamura, 1994), this euphausiid
species has not previously been reported in the diet of
dwarf minke whales.  Dwarf minke whales taken in the
Antarctic fed primarily on myctophid fishes (e.g. Kato
et al., 1989).
In the western South Atlantic E. similis seems to occur
f r o m  t h e  A b r o l h o s  B a n k  r e g i o n  ( c a  1 6 o t o  1 9 oS )
northeastern Brazil to the Uruguayan continental shelf
(ca 34o to 35oS) (Ramirez, 1971; 1973; Tôha, 1981; Freire,
1991; Gorri, 1995; Muxagata, 1999). According to Gorri
(1995), this euphausiid has its centre of dispersion in
warm waters and is an indicator species of the influence
of the warm Brazil Current in the southern Rio Grande
do Sul State, southern Brazil (Gorri, 1995). In this area,
E. similis is abundant, representing 40-60% of the
zooplankton captured in sampling nets in the spring and
summer (Gorri, 1995).  E. similis occurs in neritic waters
(Tôha, 1981; Muxagata, 1999), where sightings of dwarf
minke whales have been reported in recent years (Hassel
et al., 2003; Zerbini et al., 1997). The more neritic
d i s t r i b u t i o n  p a t t e r n  o f  d w a r f  m i n k e  w h a l e s  h a d
previously been well documented off South Africa (Best,
1985) and off eastern Australia (Arnold, 1997).
Since E. similis typically inhabits mild and warm waters,
its lack in the checklist of prey species in the minke whales’
diet probably is because most data come from animals
caught in high latitudes. However, the species is not
included among the euphausiids found in the stomach of
minke whales in medium latitudes from waters off Durban,
South Africa (Best, 1982), which were: E. diomedea, E. lucens
and E. recurva. The “krill” (certainly not E. superba) found
in at least 3% of the analysed stomachs of minke whales

caught during whaling activities in northeastern Brazil
(Williamson, 1975) is probably not E. similis as the whales
were killed mostly in oceanic waters and further beyond
the northern limit of this eupahusid range. Although it is
already known that balaenopterids may feed outside their
regular feeding grounds in high latitudes whenever plenty
of prey is available (e.g. Kawamura, 1975; 1980),  this record
of E. similis is the only data available on food of dwarf
minke whales in mid latitudes. No records exist for the

South African specimens (P. Arnold, pers. commn) and
whales seen at low latitudes in Australia have not been
seen feeding (Birtles et al., 2002).
Records of juveniles of dwarf minkes throughout much
of the year along the Brazilian coast suggest that at least
some individuals do not migrate to Antarctic waters
(Zerbini et al., 1996; 1997) and may explore locally high
productive coastal areas off eastern South America (e.g.
Hassel et al., 2003).
