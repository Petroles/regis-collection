ABSTRACT: Considering the available data, the Mousterian period is the only techno-complex from the Middle Paleolithic
identified and characterized in Portugal. However, some of the sites referred in this work should be simply attributed to the
Middle Paleolithic due to the lack of detailed elements. The site of Vale do Forno 8 probably represents the transition between
the final Upper Paleolithic and the early Middle Paleolithic.

The open-air sites such as the ones in the outskirts of Lisbon and on the left margin of the Tagus estuary, where vestiges
are extremely abundant and the permanence for long periods correspond to sites of residential character.

None of these sites were subject to extensive excavations in order to confirm this type of settlement and further knowledge
of the social organization of the inhabited spaces. Other open-air sites located in fluvial terraces present smaller areas of occupa-
tion and were probably related to game activities, maybe seasonal in nature. This was the case of Santo Antão do Tojal, were
elephants and horses were eventually captured, of Foz do Enxarrique were red deer was almost exclusive and of Vilas Ruivas,
were faunal remains were not preserved but remains of wind-breaks or hunting blind structures were found associated with fire-
places and post-holes. Fireplaces were also found in Gruta da Buraca Escura and on the open-air site of Santa Cita.

Caves such as Gruta da Oliveira and the Gruta Nova da Columbeira show long stratigraphic sequences and prolonged set-
tlements, of residential type, though a few other caves also show temporary settlements related to game activities or the exploita-
tion of geological resources. In most cases, there is an alternance of the cave occupation by humans and large carnivores. Food
subsistence of humans was non-specialized, capturing large, mid and also small preys such as the rabbit, an abundant endemic
species. The terrestrial turtle was also captured, especially in Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Aquatic resources were a significative
part of the food supply in caves close to the coast such as Ibn Amar over the Arade estuary and Gruta da Figueira Brava, over
the sea, where a lot of different species of mollucs, crustaceans and sea mammals such as seal and dolphin were present.

In the caves some few kilometers from the coast, like Gruta Nova da Columbeira, recollection or fishing activities were not
present. It means that the resource exploitation areas around the settlements were small. The same reasoning is applicable to
the geological resources, in which the raw materials such as quartz, quartzite and flint were used in quantities according to their
availability in the surrounding cave area, never more than in a 10 km around the settlements. In some cases e.g. Gruta da
Figueira Brava and Gruta do Escoural, filonean quartz was extensively used in spite of its bad quality because of its abundance
in the cave surroundings. In Lisbon region, where the distance between sites did not surpasse 30 km, there is also a strong rela-
tionship between the types of materials used and their availability, indicating the opportunistic and local origin of the produc-
tion, even if mobility was high within each the exploited area.

From both technical and typological points of view, the Final Mousterian represented by the assemblages of Gruta da
Oliveira, Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira Brava, showed no evidence of transition to the Upper Paleolithic
but rather a “mousterianisation” of the lithic industry was observed.

The food supplies used and the species captured reflected the paleoclimatic conditions that took place. The eldest materials
dated Mousterian were collected in Gruta da Furninha, from ca. 80 Ka calBP, and are related to the stripped hyaena (Hyaena
hyaena prisca), a species of warm climate coexisting with the warmwater species Patella safiana and Pectunculus bimaculatus
which existed in the 5-8 m a.s.l. marine conglomerate level observed in Forte da Baralha, in the littoral of the Arrábida Ridge.
Presently these species do not occur at latitudes higher than the Mediterranean or the Atlantic Moroccan coast.

After the formation of the fossil deposits of Gruta da Furninha, the palaeoclimatic evolution is not known until ca. 45
Ka calBP, represented by the palaeontological sites of Vale de Janela in the Estremadura littoral and São Torpes in the Alente-
jo littoral. In both sites there were found species related to a cool and wet temperate climate, but Myrica also occurs, a ter-
mophilic genus. A climate cooler than the Mediterranean is in agreement with the presence of the mountain goat in the
upper Mousterian levels of gruta da Oliveira dating before 43/42 Ka calBP. Afterwards, the climate became progressively
warmer and Mediterranean-type: the mountain goat disappeared from Gruta da Oliveira and Mediterranean rodents are present
in the Level 8 of that cave, dating from 38/37 Ka calBP, while Cepaea nemoralis appeared in Lapa dos Furos, dating from 40
Ka calBP.

From 36 Ka calBP on, there was a climatic cooling and the mountain goat reappears in low altitude mountain ranges
(Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira Brava). In fact, the weather conditions were probably cooler than in the
present and comparable to those in the cantabrian region, as suggested by the findings in Gruta da Figueira Brava. But the pre-
sence of the land turtle, which was abundant in Gruta Nova da Columbeira (up to 34-31 Ka calBP) demands summer temper-
atures ca. 20-30 ºC for egg hatching. On the other hand, the microfauna from Level K in Gruta do Caldeirão, including
Allocricetus bursae, shows how steppic conditions migrated to the western part of the Iberian Peninsula and prevailed when the
first industries of the Upper Paleolithic occurred, an evolved phase of the Aurignacian, about probably 35-34 Ka calBP.

Within this particular paleoclimatic framework of the western and southwestern parts of the Peninsula, it is possible to
accept the survival of population remains of some species including the ancient elephant which is present in Foz do Enxarrique
about 33.6 Ka calBP, and also the last Neanderthals and their Late Mousterian industry.

1. Introduction

In order to understand the human presence in pres-
ent-day Portuguese territory corresponding to the Mous-
terian complex –the only cultural complex from the Mid-
dle Paleolithic so far recognised and characterised in the

Portuguese territory (Bicho, 2004)– whose terminus has
been verified at roughly 35/34 Ka calBP years, a limit
generally accepted nowadays (Table 1), it is important to
begin with a brief description of the most important sites
that have been identified up to now (Fig. 1). This will
form the basis for a discussion of the main issues leading,

RESUMO: O Mustierense é o único tecno-complexo do Paleolítico Médio reconhecido e caracterizado em Portugal. Alguns
dos conjuntos industriais referidos neste trabalho foram, contudo, incluídos na designação mais genérica de Paleolítico Médio,
por falta de elementos de pormenor.

As estações de ar livre referenciadas parecem corporizar, nuns casos, face à enorme quantidade de vestígios, estacionamentos
intensivos e prolongados, de tipo residencial, favorecidos pela abundância de matérias-primais disponíveis. É o caso das estações
dos arredores de Lisboa e das existentes na margem esquerda do estuário do Tejo. Nenhuma foi objecto de escavações em
extensão, impossibilitando a confirmação desta situação, por um lado e, por outro, o conhecimento da organização interna do
espaço habitado. Outras estações de ar livre, implantadas em terraços fluviais, ocupam áreas menores e configuram actividades
cinegéticas especializadas, talvez de carácter sazonal: é o caso de Santo Antão do Tojal, onde provavelmente se capturou o
elefante, da Foz do Enxarrique, especializada na caça ao veado e de Vilas Ruivas, onde os restos faunísticos não se conservaram.
Naquela última estação, foram identificadas estruturas habitacionais, atribuídas a pára-ventos (wind-breaks), ou a tapumes de
caça (hunting-blinds), associadas a lareiras e a possíveis buracos de poste; estes testemunhos juntam-se às lareiras identificadas na
Gruta da Buraca Escura e no sítio de ar livre de Santa Cita.

As grutas revelam por vezes estratigrafias extensas, denunciando permanências prolongadas e recorrentes, o que configura a
situação de corresponderem a sítios de tipo residencial, sem prejuízo de também se conhecerem grutas com ocupações episódicas,
relacionadas com actividades cinegéticas ou de exploração de recursos geológicos. A Gruta da Oliveira e a Gruta Nova da
Columbeira estão no primeiro caso. Evidencia-se a alternância da sua ocupação por carnívoros e pelo homem. A variedade dos
recursos cinegéticos identificados mostra uma economia de subsistência não especializada, capturando-se presas de grande, médio
e pequeno porte. Entre as últimas encontra-se o coelho, espécie endémica, então muito abundante, cuja caça era acompanhada
pela da tartaruga terrestre, a qual atinge expressão significativa na Gruta Nova da Columbeira. Os recursos aquáticos constituíam
parte significativa da dieta em grutas próximo do litoral, como a Gruta de Ibn Amar, sobre o estuário actual do rio Arade e a
Gruta da Figueira Brava. Nesta última, a importância desse contributo alimentar é evidenciada pela diversidade e abundância
das espécies de moluscos identificados, acompanhados de crustáceos e até de mamíferos marinhos, como a foca e o golfinho.

O facto de a componente de pesca e recolecção não se ter reconhecido em grutas fora da linha de costa actual evidencia a
área relativamente limitada de captação de recursos inerente a cada gruta, sem prejuízo de os seus habitantes, dentro dos
respectivos territórios, conhecerem um alto grau de mobilidade, o qual é sublinhado pela diversidade de recursos explorados.
Esta situação também se aplica à utilização dos recursos geológicos. Com efeito, nota-se que as matérias-primas mais utilizadas,
são o quartzo, o quartzito e o sílex, em percentagens variáveis consoante a sua própria disponibilidade na envolvência imediata
das grutas, não ultrapassando um raio superior a 10 km. Noutros casos, como na Gruta da Figueira Brava e na Gruta do
Escoural, observou-se uma incidência muito forte na utilização do quartzo filoneano, apesar da sua má qualidade, em virtude de
ser a rocha disponível no território adjacente.

Do ponto de vista tecnológico e tipológico, os três conjuntos reconhecidamente datados do Mustierense Final do território
português mais importantes: Gruta da Oliveira; Gruta Nova da Columbeira e Gruta da Figueira Brava, não evidenciam qualquer
indício de evolução para indústrias do Paleolítico Superior notando-se, ao contrário, um reforço das suas características
mustierenses.

Os mais antigos materiais mustierenses estratigrafados provêm da Gruta da Furninha, datados de ca. 80 Ka calBP,
encontrando-se associados a hiena raiada (Hyaena hyaena prisca). Trata-se de espécie de clima quente, já então uma relíquia a
nível europeu, compatível com a ocorrência, no cordão conglomerático formado ao longo do litoral da serra da Arrábida a 5-8
m de altitude, contemporâneo daquele depósito, de Patella safiana, espécie de águas quentes, que actualmente não ultrapassa a
latitude do litoral atlântico marroquino, acompanhada de Pectunculus bimaculatus, de distribuição mediterrânea.

Desconhece-se a evolução paleoclimática entre a época de formação do depósito fossilífero da Furninha e cerca de 45 Ka
calBP. Tal é a cronologia obtida pelo radiocarbono para as jazidas de interesse paleontológico de Vale de Janela, no litoral da
Estremadura e de São Torpes, no litoral alentejano. Apesar de existirem em ambas as jazidas espécies de clima temperado mais
fresco e húmido que o mediterrânico, é de salientar a manutenção do género Myrica, de características termófilas. Com efeito, a
tendência para um clima temperado fresco é compatível, para a referida época, com a presença de cabra montês nos níveis
mustierenses inferiores da Gruta da Oliveira, anteriores a 43/42 Ka calBP. A partir desta época o clima parece tormar-se
progressivamente mais quente, assumindo características mediterrâneas: tal é indicado pelo desaparecimento da cabra montês na
Gruta da Oliveira, acompanhada (Nível 8) de associação de roedores de características mediterrâneas datada de ca. 38/37 Ka
calBP, compatível com a presença de Cepaea nemoralis na Lapa dos Furos, ca. de 40 Ka calBP.

A partir de 36 Ka calBP as condições climáticas parecem modificar-se progressivamente no sentido do arrefecimento: a
cabra montês reaparece nas cadeias montanhosas atlânticas de baixa altitude (Gruta Nova da Columbeira e Gruta da Figueira
Brava); o arrefecimento climático, corresponde a condições um pouco mais frias que as existentes actualmente na zona, mas
comparáveis às do litoral cantábrico, é comprovado pelo conjunto de indicadores disponíveis na Gruta da Figueira Brava, o mais
completo até ao presente reunido. Mas a presença, até ca. 34-31 Ka calBP, na Gruta Nova da Columbeira, da tartaruga terrestre,
espécie ali abundante, que requeria temperaturas da ordem dos 20 a 30 graus centígrados ao longo do Verão, para a incubação
dos ovos, indica que o arrefecimento clumático não poderia ter sido muito acentuado. Por outro lado, a microfauna do Nível K
da gruta do Caldeirão, com Allocricetus bursae, demonstra a progressão até ao ocidente peninsular das condições estépicas cerca
de 35 Ka calBP. Tais condições prevaleciam aquando do surgimento na região, talvez ca. 35-34 Ka calBP, das primeiras indústrias
do Paleolítico Superior, pertencentes já a um estádio evoluído do Aurignacense.

É neste quadro paleoclimático particular ao ocidente e sudoeste peninsular que se devem entender sobrevivências tardias de
certas espécies, como o elefante antigo, presente na Foz do Enxarrique cerca de 33,6 Ka calBP o qual, oferecendo condições
geográficas favoráveis, favoreceu também a tardia presença dos últimos Neandertais e, com eles, do Mustierense Final no
território português.

in the final part of this article, to a concluding summary
of models of land use and occupation, closely linked to
the evolution of the paleoclimatic and paleogeographic
characteristics of the environments in which human acti-
vity took place.

Although some of the caves occupied during the
Mousterian period had been excavated in the 19th. cen-
tury, as was the case with the Furninha cave, and the
materials carefully recorded according to the levels on
which they were found (Delgado, 1884), interest in exca-
vating caves declined during the 20th. century in favour
of the study of open-air sites, usually lacking any strati-
graphic indicators. Two main reasons lay behind this: on
the one hand, the impossibility of carrying out lengthy
and systematic explorations of caves due to the lack of
available and suitably qualified archaeologists and, on the
other hand, the lack of funding meant that researchers
could not be trained who could then, in collaboration
with specialists from other countries, establish an area of
research, as had been the case in Spain. From the begin-
ning of the 20th. century until the start of the 1960s, the
study of Middle Paleolithic materials in Portugal was
therefore restricted to the results of surface collections,
involving low investment and a methodology that any

amateur could learn in a few hours. This happened with
the rich Paleolithic sites on the outskirts of Lisbon, dis-
cussed later, which were the object of intensive collecting
following the discovery of the famous site at Casal do
Monte just outside Lisbon, in 1909, by Joaquim Fontes.
This approach to studying Paleolithic materials was boosted
in the mid-1940s by the presence of H. Breuil in Portu-
gal (between June 1941 and November 1942), legitimis-
ing this form of collecting with the adoption of a method
–the so-called “series method”– that resolved the limita-
tions arising out of a lack of stratigraphic information,
based as much on the typology as on the physical state of
the industry. Thus the greater the surface wear on the
examples, including the identification of the superimposi-
tion of successive forms of erosion (e.g. water, wind), the
older the item was, based on the principle that all items
were affected by the same conditions since they had been
abandoned on the surface. Without wishing to enter into
a discussion on the relative merits and limitations of these
criteria, which continued to be used in Portugal for the
following sixty years due to the work of G. Zbyszewski, a
disciple of Breuil, it may be affirmed that he presided
almost exclusively over the classification of Lower and
Middle Paleolithic industry in Portugal until the start of

the 1980s, when a small group of researchers emerged
who, despite their different academic backgrounds, finally
managed in various ways to harness the necessary funding
for extensive research into cave and open-air site deposits.

In spite of the scarcity of human resources, it is dur-
ing this period, spanning the last 25 years, that the most

significant advances have been
made towards understanding the
Middle Paleolithic in Portugal,
although this has been insepara-
ble from parallel research into
the Upper Paleolithic, bearing in
mind that the sites were either
the same or were located in the
same geographical area, particu-
larly the Estremadura Limestone
Massif and adjacent areas, where
there is an abundance of karst
caves, thus justifying combined
research work.

The direct predecessor of
the studies currently being un-
dertaken into the Middle Pa-
leolithic period in Portugal was
the excavation of the Gruta das
Salemas (Loures), followed by
that of the Gruta Nova da
Columbeira (Bombarral), both
carried out by the staff of the
Serviços Geológicos de Portugal at
the beginning of the 1960s. It
was the only official organisa-
tion that had the necessary
resources and technical means to
carry out such research, albeit in
a circumstantial and limited
manner since it was subordinat-
ed to geological work. Neverthe-
less, it was the excavation of
these caves, due, in particular to
the work of O. da Veiga Fer-
reira, which inaugurated the era
of modern research into the
Middle and Upper Paleolithic
in Portugal. The delay in fol-
lowing-up the research explains
the long period before the
appearance of the first summa-
ry on the Early and Middle Por-
tuguese Paleolithic (Zby 74). A
later and more detailed summa-
ry appeared twenty years later
(illustrating the rapid evolution
of knowledge that had taken
place in the interim; Raposo,
1993). Recently, the subject has
interested several researchers
(Bicho, 2004; Zilhsa, 1992,
2004, 2006; Cardoso, 2002).

2.1. Sites on the outskirts of Lisbon

The earliest recovery of Paleolithic materials on the
outskirts of Lisbon dates from the end of the 19th centu-
ry, initially in the Monsanto hills, where the abundance

of flint, occurring in the form of nodules in the hard Cre-
taceous limestone, enabled thousands of items to be
chipped in workshops which operated throughout most
of the Paleolithic period and extended into post-Paleolith-
ic times. However, successive quarrying of the Cretaceous
limestone in this region, especially after the great earth-
quake of 1755, did away with most of the existing
remains. The most substantial collections were found in
the vast basalt complex of Lisbon which extends almost
continuously from the Cascais to the Loures region, form-
ing a long arc around the capital, with a greater concentra-
tion of occurrences in the Amadora and Benfica regions.
The extensive Paleolithic area discovered in the region was
therefore named the Lisbon Paleolithic Volcanic Complex.

In 1932, A. do Paço (Paço, 1932) mapped out 94 Paleo-
lithic sites surrounding the capital and the inventory was
subsequently updated but not significantly altered (Paço,
1940; Jalhay &amp;amp; Paço, 1941). Many of these sites (Fig. 2)
had been previously identified by Vergílio Correia and
Joaquim Fontes who, in the same year but as the result of
independent work, presented the first summaries of these
sites (Fontes, 1912; Correia, 1912), thus demonstrating
the Paleolithic richness of the region. Joaquim Fontes was
also responsible for identifying the first and certainly the
most important site in the region, Casal do Monte, in
1909 (Fontes, 1910). He was also apparently the first per-
son to use the term “Mousterian” in Portugal (referring to
the “Moustier epoch” and “Moustier type”) in 1912 whilst
studying examples collected from sites on the outskirts of
Lisbon, stating that he was using the nomenclature of G.
and A. de Mortillet. Encouraged by the interest his dis-
coveries aroused abroad, since little was known at the time
about the Portuguese Lower and Middle Paleolithic, in the
same year Joaquim Fontes presented the first summary on
the Mousterian period in Portugal (Fontes, 1913) at the
8th session of the French Pre-Historic Conference held in
Angoulême in 1912. In this study he classified the main
types of Mousterian tools on the basis of collections he
had gathered from sites on the outskirts of Lisbon, descri-
bing the Gruta da Furninha as the only known site of
stratigraphic interest based on of the excavations carried
out there by Nery Delgado in 1879.

The thousands of tools that had been previously been
recovered, considerably enlarged by their own collections
(Fig. 3), were studied exhaustively by H. Breuil and G.
Zbyszewski as part of their systematic review of the Pale-
olithic in the Lisbon region, thus identifying a long suc-
cession of industry from the Lower Acheulean to post-
Paleolithic times. This considerable industry is explained
not only by the broad diachronics of the succession, but
also by its geographical isolation, since it is associated with
a near peninsula bordered by the ocean in the west, the
Tejo estuary in the south and the Tejo valley in the east,

and particularly by the availabil-
ity of raw material, essentially
consisting of Cretaceous flint
(Fig. 4) and, to a lesser extent,
quartz and quartzite pebbles from
the Plio-Pleistocene deposits that
have almost completely disap-
peared today.

Bearing in mind the techni-
cal and typological characteristics
of the tools, the human presence
must have reached its peak dur-
ing the Mousterian age. At this
time, the region was, probably
densely covered with shrubs and
intermittently surrounded by for-
est areas, would have been a
good hunting ground, also due
to the mild climate resulting
from the low latitude and prox-
imity to the coast. In fact, the
predominance of open-air camps

Lisbon outskirts (after Paço, 1940).

over cave dwellings, which were almost always sporadical-
ly distributed, indicates the existence of a generally benign
climate during most of the last glacial period.

The Paleolithic materials on the surface were so widely
dispersed that the concentrations observed locally, all inva-
riably lacking stratigraphic information, were denied the
status of authentic archaeological sites by H. Breuil and G.
Zbyszewski as, in fact, they are not, in the traditional sense
of the term, signifying the demarcated distribution of arte-
facts with a well-defined stratigraphic position: “These are
widely dispersed over all the surfaces that were investigated
and, although denser in certain areas, were not really loca-
ted in authentic sites” (Breuil &amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1942: 32).

Due to gravity and post depositional mass movement,
the items were dispersed over the slopes. In the upper

parts of the landscape, erosion
revealed basalt outcrops and, at
the bottom of the valleys levelled
by fine sediments, it covered the
older levels containing Paleolithic
materials. This does not, howev-
er, refute the existence of areas
containing obvious concentra-
tions of artefacts separated by
areas where they do not occur, as
Joaquim Fontes had already clear-
ly emphasised (Fontes, 1912).

The most recent summary on
the Lisbon Paleolithic Volcanic
Complex (Cardoso, Zbyszewski
&amp;amp; André, 1992) demonstrates
the interdependence of the type
of raw materials used and the
regional geological sources that
were potentially available. Thus,
in the most westerly zones of
this Paleolithic area, close to the
flint nodules found in the hard
Cretaceous limestone ridges, this
is the raw material which pre-
dominates, whereas in the central
sector, representing the largest
concentration of materials, as wit-
nessed in the Amadora and Ben-
fica areas, there is a greater use of
quartzite and quartz, which
would have been available locally
in the remains of the Plio-Qua-
ternary detritic deposits. Finally,
in the most easterly zone in the
Loures area, quartz vein pebbles
predominate, originating in Ter-
tiary detritic deposits. This shows
that, notwithstanding the remark-
able mobility of these groups and
the mere dozens of kilometres
that separated the eastern from
the western zone, the production
of artefacts was carried out local-
ly, according to need, and oppor-
tunistically, making use of rock
that was available locally.

2.2. The Tejo valley terraces and the terraces of the left bank
tributaries

2.2.1. Foz do Enxarrique (Vila Velha de Ródão)

Located upstream from the previous site and from
Portas de Ródão and associated with a 5-10 m terrace of
the River Tejo periodically affected by river flooding, a
single archaeological level has been identified in an area
of roughly 150 m2, consisting of fine sediments (Fig. 5)
which, due to the formation of a calcium carbonate pre-
cipitate, have allowed the presence of faunal remains
(Raposo et al., 1985). In fact, the association with the

human occupation of this faunal assemblage
–including deer, horse, aurochs, rabbit, rhinoceros
and elephant (Cardoso, 1993; Brugal &amp;amp; Raposo,
1999), in which the first two species predomi-
nate– has been questioned by J. Zilhão (Zilhão,
2001). However the author himself later admit-
ted that although the remains of large animals such
as elephant and rhinoceros may have corresponded
to a natural accumulation, to which the remains of
carnivores such as the hyena, fox and occasional-
ly bear may be added, the remains of the other
animals, particularly deer, which represent almost
90% of the total, show signs of cutting and burn-
ing (Zilhão, 2006). Therefore, even taking these
reservations into account, this association of
fauna with lithic remains may still be considered
generally valid as an indication of a human
encampment in that sector of the river bank,
where it is joined on its right-hand bank by the
Enxarrique tributary.

The weighted average of three U/Th datings
on the teeth of horses (2) and aurochs (1) gave a
result of 33,600 years BP ± 500 years. The lithic
assemblage, most of which was chipped on site
thus establishing the existence of a “work camp”,
is dominated by the use of quartzite available local-
ly in large amounts from the gravel levels of the
terrace.

Approximately 10,000 artefacts were recovered
which unfortunately have still not been studied in
detail (Fig. 6). The Levallois technique is frequent-
ly in evidence, either in the form of centripetal
chipping used to work the cores or in the method
for removing a predetermined flake or point, with
all the stages in the operational chain for prepara-
tion and flaking present, as well as the correspon-
ding subproducts, most of which must have been
used without transformation, given the scarcity of
retouched tools.

Due to the large amount of material it has
provided, its stratigraphic features and its absolute

chronology, together with the valuable faunal information
it contains, the Foz do Enxarrique site represents one of
the most important Upper Middle Paleolithic sites in the
Iberian peninsula.

2.2.2. Vilas Ruivas (Vila Velha de Ródão)

Two thermoluminescence datings gave a weighted
average of 54,000 years + 12,000; -11,000 years BP for
the surface occupation of the remains of a Quaternary ter-
race downstream from Portas de Ródão and 32 m above
the level of the Tejo (Raposo, 1995). The main interest of
the site lies in the fact that two arched structures have
been preserved, possibly representing the bases for shades
to protect fire structures suggested by the accumulation of
thermoclast elements. Four negative structures have also
been identified, which are circular and approximately 20 cm
in diameter and may be interpreted as post holes (Fig. 7).
Luís Raposo (L. Raposo, 1995; GEPP, 1977) has no doubts
as to the anthropic nature of these structures, not only
because of their configuration but also because they are
made from pebbles that had been transported to the area,
given that the underlying geological deposit consists of
fine sandy silt. The Vilas Ruivas site may therefore be
associated with a group which exploited the hunting
resources of the region adjacent to the great peninsular
river, constructing fireplaces –as the aforementioned struc-
tures may be interpreted– and using the abundant raw
material available locally (particularly quartzite pebbles)
for processing in the area (as a “working camp site”). The
industry belongs to the Middle Paleolithic and contains
Levallois discoid cores, together with their associated

subproducts, in addition to some
retouched tools, scrapers and
denticulates (Fig. 8).

According to J. Zilhão, fol-
lowing L. Binford’s ethno-archaeo-
logical model, this could be an
example of a hunters’ camp and
he interprets the two arched struc-
tures as “hunting blinds”, empha-
sising their similarity to those
recorded in the Côa Gravettian
sites roughly 150 km to the north
(Zilhão, 1992, 2001).

2.2.3. Vale do Forno (Alpiarça)

The middle levels of the mid-
dle terrace in Vale do Forno sup-
plied materials that are characte-
ristic of the Upper Acheulean and
may be placed towards the end of
this technocomplex, between the
Late Riss and the Early Würm, in
accordance with radiometric da-
ting obtained from two of the
levels, VF 7 and VF 8 (Raposo,
1995). This therefore defines the
lower chronological limit of the

Mousterian period in Portugal, at least in that region. How-
ever, a lack of absolute dates prevents any adequate discus-
sion of this question in scientific terms.

One of the sites which has been investigated, Vale do
Forno 8, which belongs to the Upper Acheulean and has
been placed by Luís Raposo in the Late Riss, has provid-
ed, in association with typically Acheulean items such as
some bifaces and axes, numerous flake artefacts of Middle
Paleolithic pattern in flint and quartzite including Tayac
points, scrapers, denticulates, borers and discoid cores
(Fig. 9). But their similarities with the sites on the left
bank of the Tejo estuary located further downstream are
denied by L. Raposo. “This allows the inclusion of these
assemblages into a wider idea of the Middle Paleolithic,
despite the presence of techno-typological characteristics
very different from the real Mousterian industries” (Vega
Toscano, Raposo &amp;amp; Santonja, 1999). Nevertheless, the
presence of some acheulian artefacts is not a decisive argu-
ment against the integration of this industry in the Mous-
terian complex, having in account the frequence of bifaces
in the earlier times of the French Mousterian. On the
other hand, L. Raposo stresses the fact that flaking indus-
try predominates, obtained from globulous rather discoid
cores, corresponding neither to the typical mousterian nor
to an acheulian technology (L. Raposo, personnal infor-
mation). In conclusion, when more complete data has
been gathered, the succession of industries discovered in
situ in the complex terrace system of the Lower Tejo in
the Alpiarça region will open up discussion on the transi-
tion of industries from the Lower to the Middle Paleoli-
thic, similar to that which has been observed in other
large Peninsular river systems such as the Manzanares an
Tormes valleys.

2.2.4. Arneiro Cortiço (Benavente)

In their study of the Quater-
nary terraces of the Lower Tejo
valley area and the corresponding
Paleolithic industries, H. Breuil
and G. Zbyszewski recorded va-
rious Paleolithic materials asso-
ciated with the terraces of the
River Almansor, a tributary 
on the left bank of the Tejo,
although only a small amount
had been collected in situ (Breuil
&amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1945). Later, the
second of these two authors,
together with O. da Veiga Fer-
reira, identified other areas in the
same region. In four of these
areas, items were recovered in situ
from the gravel bed deposits of
the lower terrace (Q4, between 8
and 20 m). The materials, made
exclusively from quartzite pebbles
and flakes, were classified as da-
ting from between the Upper
Acheulean and the Mousterian
period (Zbyszewski &amp;amp; Ferreira,
1967).

Like many others, these occu-
rrences would not merit any
special attention in a summary
such as this had they not pre-
ceded an important archaeolo-
gical intervention which made
them more significant. In fact,
as part of the work involved in
mitigating the environmental
impact of the building of the A13
motorway, various areas contai-
ning Paleolithic industries dis-
persed over the surface have been
identified, six of which are of
stratigraphic interest, including
the site of the previously un-
known Arneiro Cortiço, which
merits excavation work.

This site is located at an
altitude of 19 m on the remains
of a terrace of the left bank of
the River Almansor. Surveys have resulted in the recovery
of 510 artefacts stratigraphic interest (Gaspar &amp;amp; Aldeias,
2005). It is a characteristic flaking industry of the Middle
Paleolithic, with the almost exclusive use of quartzite peb-
bles with a core/flake ratio of 1/5. Expeditive use has been
made of the abundant raw materials that are strewn over
large areas of the surface of the several terraces that have
been identified.

The existence of tools is minimal, denoting a context
identical to others from the same period in the Lower
Tejo valley. The average of 61 items per m2 reveals heavy
chipping activity in the area or nearby, which is another
identifying feature of the sites in this region. Unfortu-
nately, the deposit has not been dated and the chronology

of the site can only be inferred from the geological con-
ditions, which are similar to those at the Conceição site
discussed later.

2.2.5. The Santo Antão do Tojal terrace (Loures)

Mousterian materials have been observed on a 10-15
terrace in Santo Antão do Tojal, Loures, in the valley of
the Trancão River, in cuts exposed by the construction of
irrigation channels in the 1930s. These are apparently
associated with the presence of charcoal and the bones of
horses and elephants, slaughtered by the lacustrine area
which existed there at the time (Zbyszewski, 1943, 1977).

Using the U/Th datation method, elephant bones
yielded a result of SMU-305 – 81900 + 4000; -3800 BP
(Raposo, 1995), which is compatible with the presence of
the aforementioned Mousterian items.

The author developed a model to propose a corres-
ponding model for the occupation and use of the
resources existing in the region during the Mousterian
period: whilst the banks of the vast alluvial basin of the
Tejo were occupied by open-air residential camps spe-
cialised in hunting large mammals (horse, elephant), the
caves on the top of the limestone hills overlooking 
the alluvial valleys would have been used less frequently as
shelters during the course of the hunting. The raw mate-
rials originated locally: in fact, on the lower terraces there
was plenty of quartzite and quartz, whilst in the limestone
massifs in which the caves and shelters were set, there were
good quality flint nodules. Some of these caves in the
heart of the limestone area containing flint nodules show
signs of low-density occupation. This was the case of the

Gruta do Correio-Mor (Loures),
where the stratigraphy identifies
Mousterian activity using flint
nodules at the base of an essen-
tially Holocene archaeological se-
quence (Zbyszewski, 1987), and
the Gruta da Ponte da Laje
(Oeiras), overlooking the stream
of the same name, where the
tools have identical characteristics
and positioning (Cardoso, 1995).

2.2.6. Terraces on the left bank 
of the Tejo estuary

The Pleistocene sequence of
terrace systems on the Lower
Tejo is most marked in the
Alpiarça region where they are
over ten kilometres wide and
constitute the largest complex
of alluvial Pleistocene deposits
in Portuguese territory. The
terraces in the region further
downstream developing in the
estuary area are due to oscilla-
tions in the sea level, although
the geochronological framework
proposed in the 1940s and still
used today (Zbyszewski, 1946)
needs revising in the absence of
any updating of the entire suc-
cession observed.

Various sites of stratigraphic
interest are associated with these
deposits, indicative of the settling
of numerous human groups dis-
persed over the surface of the
middle terrace, roughly 15 m
above the level of the stream,
which can be attributed to the
last interglacial period in the tra-
ditional chronology (Breuil &amp;amp;
Zbyszewski, 1945).

Although flake tools occur in Cascalheira (Alcochete),
(including points and blades, scrapers, denticulates, sin-
gle-edged knives and others), it is mainly the discoid cores
predominate, featuring typical mousterian centripetal fla-
king (Fig. 10). Numbering more than 500, they represent
the largest collection ever found in Portugal (Carreira &amp;amp;
Raposo, 1994).

The Alto da Pacheca site, which is closely related to
Cascalheira, is situated in the surrounding area and is
associated with the same level of terrace (Cardoso &amp;amp; Mon-
jardino, 1976/1977), where the proliferation of Mouste-
rian nuclei is also marked. Within the context of the strati-
graphic sequence defined in the Alpiarça middle terrace,
the gravel bed which can be observed in both Cascalheira
and Alto da Pacheca, crowning a sandy series, may be
related with the beginning of the regressive phase of the
deepening of the Tejo river bed, at the beginning of 
the Würmian glaciation, a classification that is compatible
with the type of industry found there.

9, 11, quartz; 3, 7, 8, 10, 12-19, quartzite (after Raposo, 1995).



However, the best-known
Paleolithic site on the left bank
of the Tejo estuary is Conceição
(Raposo &amp;amp; Cardoso, 1998a),
associated with a lower level of
terraces located 8 to 10 m
above the level of the Tejo in
the area where the archaeologi-
cal site is located, afterwards
rising gradually to a height of
around 15 m. It is a low ter-
race, to use the terminology
applied by G. Zbyszewski to
the Lower Tejo terrace system
(Zbyszewski, 1946). During the
course of emergency excavation
work connected with the buil-
ding of access roads for the
Vasco da Gama bridge, a peb-
bly level was identified in the
highest section of the sequence,
on the uppermost part of which
occurred abundant of unsmoo-
thed flake items, indicating that
they were penecontemporary
with the formation of this deposit
(Fig. 11).

Two radiometric dates using
OSL (Raposo &amp;amp; Cardoso, 1998a)
were obtained. A fine clay/silt
level lacking in industry corres-
ponding to the lower part of
the sequence and associated
with the phase in which the val-
ley was filled in, gave a result of
74.5 Ka BP (+11,6; -10,4 Ka),
whilst a level of eolic sands
immediately re-covering the
upper part of the gravel bed
where the items lay was dated at
27.2 Ka BP (± 2,5 Ka), proba-
bly associated with the climatic
deterioration prior to the last pleni-glaciation. However,
the stratigraphy indicates that the chronology for the
mousterian occupation may be close to the more recent
date, given aspect the fresh aspect of the surface of the
pieces, indicating that they were rapidly re-covered by the
eolic deposit. In addition, the formation of the gravel bed
covering the basal deposit of fluvial-marine sands may be
associated with the beginning of a regressive episode,
which parallels the period of climatic deterioration that
later led to the deposition of the eolic sands observed at
the top of the sequence. If this is the case, the chronolo-
gy for human occupation would be the same as the one
identified for the Gruta da Figueira Brava discussed later,
of approximately 36 Ka BP, thus making it one of a series of
sites compatible with a chronology within OIS - 3.

The conclusions that can be drawn from a technical/
typological analysis of the many thousands of items collect-
ed reveal that the area was occupied intensively given the
abundance and quality of the available raw material, con-
sisting mainly of quartzite pebbles ranging from the initial
mass used as nuclei to the typically mousterian discoid

cores. The Levallois technique is in evidence, leading to
flakes obtained and used immediately or transformed into
various tools, mainly denticulates and notches but also
some scrapers and a few borers. The considerable stan-
dardisation of technical procedures should be emphasised,
based on economy of action in relation to the intended
purpose. This is exemplified in the proliferation of “Mous-
terian disc cores”, an extreme case of simplification of pro-
cedure in which advantage is taken of the morphology of
the natural stone in order to extract the selected flakes
directly from it without the need to shape and prepare
striking surfaces (Fig. 12).

In short, the Conceição site fully encapsulates the
“work camp site” concept of the Anglo-Saxon writers, in
which pre-shaped flake products would have been expor-
ted for use in other areas or on routes used to gather
resources. In fact the almost exclusive use of quartzite,
which could be found in large quantities in the area, pro-
duced only 3% of the tools obtained, in contrast with the
high percentage of nuclei, representing 24.3% of the total
number of artefacts.

2.3. Other open-air sites in central Portugal

2.3.1. Estrada do Prado (Tomar)

This is an open-air site located in a middle terrace of
the Nabão River. The abundant industry seems to have
been developed over successive levels of occupation and
has been covered with a fine deposit roughly 2 m deep
(Mateus, 1984).

Only a preliminary report has been published of 
the excavation, in spite of the importance of the site and the
amount and diversity of the flint, quartzite and quartz
materials. The lithic industry, approximately 3,000 arte-
facts was found in fine beds formed in a low-energy flu-
vial environment. The tools show the use of quartzite,
quartz, shale, arenite and flint, although only the latter is
used in quantity, representing 20% of the total; it was also
the only raw material that could be adequately charac-
terised. Analysis of the 584 corresponding artefacts
showed that the Levallois technique and the disc (cen-
tripetal) variant was used (27 examples). Some nuclei were
completely used up, which can be attributed to the fact
that flint was a scarce raw material in the immediate vici-
nity of the site. The flakes reveal a high level of facets on
the dorsal face, together with a high incidence of trans-
formation into tools, a fact related to the intensity with

which the flint cores were exploited, with a preference for
larger sized flakes for processing, totalling 173 items (Fig.
13) and corresponding to 29.6% of the total flint arte-
facts (Chacón &amp;amp; Raposo, 2001).

2.3.2. Santa Cita (Tomar)

Like the previous site this is also associated with a
low terrace on the right bank of the River Nabão, near
the mouth of the tributary Bezelga, the sixth and last to
be formed (T6b) in a regional sequence. Although there
is no chronometric information at present for this
deposit, or the Mousterian occupation associated with
it, it is obvious that the last phase in the formation of
terraces would have occurred during a Würmian inter-
stadial, belonging to OIS 3. Its chronology is set between
60 and 40 Ka BP, corresponding to a positive warm
oscillation (Lussu et al., 2001).

After an initial intervention supervised by Nuno
Bicho, the excavation work, prompted by the building of
an important road axis, was organised according to va-
rious objectives including the recovery and preservation of
the archaeological structures that had been identified,
namely a habitat level.

The general sequence established during recent archaeo-
logical work (Lussu et al., 2001) indicates that two Mous-
terian levels existed there, the most modern of which (B1),
interspersed as a fine deposit, can be identified as the top
of the Pleistocene terrace, corresponding to the transition
from a level of red clay with signs of pedogenesis to a level
of yellow silt. However, archaeological materials also exist
on the more recent level B2, allowing in some cases the
reassembly with materials from level B1. The oldest
archaeological assemblage is found beneath this fine
deposit, lying on top of the conglomerate deposit in the
terrace (C1), with the industries still in their original
place. This paleosurface was preserved by moulding.

There are therefore two levels on which, at separate
but close periods of time, various human activities were
carried out. In fact, the existence of reassemblages of
quartz, quartzite and flint cores in both levels points to
this conclusion. No faunal or carbon remains have been
preserved. Local quartz and quartzite pebbles predominate
in the terrace conglomerate, whilst flint is much rarer.

There does not seem to be evidence of any differences
between the materials belonging to the two stratigraphi-
cally distinct lithic assemblages (B1/B2 and the top of
C1). The quartzite nuclei were chipped using pre-defined
reduction techniques in which both the classic Levallois
and centripetal techniques are present and the flint nuclei,
as in the previous site, appear heavily exploited.

In total over 1,400 items were recovered from level
C1, a larger amount than from B1. In both cases, flakes
predominate, with evidence of technological differentia-
tion although no evidence of processing into tools.

A study referring to the initial work undertaken in
Santa Cita between 1990 and 1997 by a different team
also defined two stratigraphically distinct mousterian
occupations: level “M”, corresponding to level B2 and the
more modern level 6 (Bicho, 1997; Bicho &amp;amp; Ferring,
2001), possibly equivalent to level B1 in the sequence pre-
viously described. Level C1 was not identified.

of the pebble ground, with some artefacts in situ (photo

Studies by Nuno Bicho
reached different conclusions with
regard to the characteristics of
the Mousterian occupations,
namely that the older level, con-
taining approximately 5,000 arte-
facts represents a more intensive
occupation of the area, associa-
ted with the hypothesis of a
habitat structure consisting of 5
post holes which, according to
the author, describe a trapezoi-
dal circuit. In the upper level,
concentrations of small nuclei 
of materials can be observed,
totalling no more than 100
items. Although neither of the
Mousterian occupations has
been attributed the status of a
true occupation level, the con-
clusions of the technological
studies and studies on the sup-
ply of raw materials were con-
firmed in the work cited above.
In all the raw materials identi-
fied —quartz, quartzite and
flint, in that order— there is
evidence of the successive phas-
es of operative technological
chains featuring the disc core
technique and, more rarely, the
Levallois technique (obviously
used in the more modern level
and including a Levallois point),
indicating in situ production. 
As previously verified, flint was
the most heavily worked of all the
raw materials, especially in
the most modern level, certainly
as a result of its particular suit-
ability for full use of the Leval-
lois technique, involving raw
materials which came from two
areas that were over 10 kilome-
tres apart. Therefore, despite the
scarcity of the sample available in the upper level, there
seems to be a quartzite/quartz association in the lower
level which is replaced by a quartzite/flint association in
the upper level (Bicho &amp;amp; Ferring, 2001).

Scrapers, denticulates and notches were identified
amongst other items (Bicho &amp;amp; Ferring, 2001), thus filling
in a significant gap in the study produced by Lussu and
his collaborators.

The establishment of the site in a strategic area of
the Nabão valley plentifully supplied with water and
raw materials explains the abundance of artefacts asso-
ciated with recurrent occupations of the site during 
the Mousterian period. It should be stressed that the 
two Mousterian occupations later defined are linked
with authentic occupation levels, a very rare situation
in the case of open-air sites. The area may therefore
have acted as a logistic camp site, similar to Foz do
Enxarrique or Vilas Ruivas.

2.3.3. Ribeira da Ponte da Pedra, or Ribeira da Atalaia
(Vila Nova da Barquinha)

A short distance away from the right-hand slope of
the valley of the Atalaia stream, which flows into the River
Tejo, many Paleolithic artefacts have been identified,
exposed to the surface by present-day erosion that has cut
deeply into the succession of the Pleistocene deposits.
Excavations were carried out on the base of the middle
terrace (Q3) of the Tejo river system and the upper part
of the lower terrace (Q4-1 or Q4a).

The materials collected from the base of Q3 belong
to the Lower Paleolithic (and are totally devoid of any evi-
dence of Levallois or disc core centripetal flaking tech-
nique). Between the upper part of the lower terrace and
the base of the middle terrace important levels of ancient
colluvium were noted. By 2000 only 134 artefacts had
been excavated from there, including one disc core

and two bifaces, one of which
has arcane features (Grimaldi &amp;amp;
Rosina, 2001), suggesting a mix-
ture of sediments and materials
from various different ages con-
forming to the correlative nature
of the deposit.

An excavation, the results of
which have not yet been pu-
blished, took place on the surface
of the lower terrace which, like
Santa Cita, belongs chronologi-
cally to an interstadial formation
from OIS – 3. The identifica-
tion of a paleo-soil containing a
fire structure led to an extension
of the area being explored. The
presence of this structure (and
probably of others which have
not yet been identified) enough
to consider this site potentially
very interesting. It consists of a
sub-circular fireplace 0.90 x 1.0
m, defined along its perimeter
by local stone elements, with
some clear signs of reddening
caused by heat. The interior of
the structure was filled with an
ash sediment arranged in hori-
zontal levels beneath the termo-
clastic gravels.

Almost all the materials re-
covered from this sector of the
excavation area were attributed to
the Middle Paleolithic. They con-
sisted of quartzite pebbles, local
in origin, which provided flakes,
usually unprocessed, shaped peb-
bles and nuclei, together with
bifacial items and evidence of the
Levallois technique and its disc
core variant (Figueiredo et al.,
2005).

2.3.4. Sites in the area
surrounding Rio Maior

Good quality flint in the
form of nodules found in the neo-
genic deposits of Rio Maior basin
was used in successive periods,
from the Acheulian to more re-
cent times. Large amounts of
pinkish-red flint were used in the
Mousterian period to make tools,
showing evidence of Levallois
chipping including some good
examples of Levallois and Mous-
terian cores (Fig. 14), although
these were always recovered from
the surface, due to the lack of
excavation work (Cardoso &amp;amp; Nor-
ton, 1995).

2.3.5. Coastal sites

Recent surveys along the
coast have led to the identifica-
tion of a small Mousterian occu-
pation on an east Mira beach
with evidence of flakes, nuclei
and flint debitage products de-
noting use of the Levallois tech-
nique (Haws et al., 2006). The
occupation must have been based
in the area above the beach, in a
sandy environment which nowa-
days has an altitude of roughly 35
m. Bearing in mind the regressive
sea level at the time, its present
position has been interpreted as
the result of tectonic phenomena
located roughly in the area in
question.

A date for charcoal found 
in a bed of carbonised ashes
within the same geological unit,
whose relationship to this site
has not, however, been clarified,
has given a result of 36 ± 750
Ka BP. This result is similar to
that obtained for a deposit also
situated on the present coast of
Vale da Janela (Ferrel, Peniche)
further to the south, 38 Ka BP
+ 1,7; -1,4 Ky, in which a floral
association has been identified,
evidence of a cool, humid and
windy climate. These conditions
are also present in the Alentejo
coast: the S. Torpes palaeonto-
logical site, where an palinological
association has been dated from
39,49 ± 2,34 Ka BP and more
than 42,24 Ka BP (Schroeder-
Lanz, 1971). It should be empha-
sized the presence of Myrica in
both associations, a genus with
termophile characteristics (Diniz,
1986, 1993).

The discovery of this site
suggests the existence and even
frequency of occupations with
stratigraphic interest along this
coastal strip during the Mous-
terian. This conclusion results
the significant number of fin-
dings belonging to this period,
most of which were recovered
from the surface of the gravel
beds of Quaternary beaches
extending to the south (Breuil &amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1945).

2.4. Caves of the Estremadura Limestone Massif and
adjacent area

The karst caves found in the various Mesozoic lime-
stone formations in Estremadura are very striking. They

are found rarely in the Algarve crags and in some lime-
stone outcrops in the interior of the country dating from
the Palaeozoic era. However the area extending from the
Arrábida to the Sicó mountains near Pombal clearly pro-
vides valuable information on settlements in present-day
Portuguese territory during the Middle Paleolithic. In
geographical order, the following caves are therefore
described.

ton, 1995).



2.4.1. Gruta da Buraca Escura (Pombal)

Located in the heart of the Sicó mountains, this cave
has supplied items in flint and particularly milky quartz
from the Middle Paleolithic, at its deepest archaeological
levels corresponding to Assemblage 3 under the Grave-
ttian occupation (Aubry &amp;amp; Moura, 1994).

The abundant fauna includes carnivores, raising
doubts about the importance attributed to human hun-
ting activity in the aforementioned collection. However,
this cannot be the case in terms of the fauna exhumed in
a fire area and its immediate vicinity which, together with
the structures identified in Vilas Ruivas, constitutes the
oldest Paleolithic constructive evidence identified in Por-
tuguese territory. Here splinters from large mammal
bones have been identified, together with microfauna, a
phalanx and an astragalus from a mountain goat (Capra
pyrenaica) and an incisor from a young horse (Equus
caballus).

2.4.2. Gruta do Caldeirão (Tomar)

This karst cave was excavated under the supervision
of João Zilhão between 1979 and 1988. Under an Upper
Paleolithic sequence which confers archaeological impor-
tance on this cave, a Mousterian sequence has been iden-
tified, approximately 1 m deep (Levels N to L), from a
lengthy period of climatic improvement and covered by
Level K, which has an average depth of 0.45 m. This level
is separated from the others by a very marked discontinu-
ity, probably erosive in origin, attributed to the Denekamp
interstadial (Zilhão, 1997, Fig. 9.3).

The block of levels N to L contain few artefacts mixed
with numerous remains of carnivores, particularly hyena,
so that its formation essentially correlates with the activi-
ties of these and other carnivores (Davis, 2002). Level K
also provided materials that are exclusively Mousterian,
featuring the Levallois technique, although they are not
numerous, in association with a plentiful supply of bone
remains. This also suggests a natural accumulation, per-
haps as a result of hyena activity. The direct dating of one
bone gave a result of 27.6 ± 0.6 Ka C14 BP, correspon-
ding to the date calibrated at ca. 32.4 Ka calBP (Zilhão,
2006). This result, after having been initially accepted by
the author, was questioned in his latest work, in which he
claims that the date cannot be considered much earlier
than ca. 35 Ka calBP, due to extrapolations of a paleocli-
matic nature. In other words, the chronology of the most
modern Mousterian level in the Gruta do Caldeirão is not
at present established, and it is accepted that the only
bone dating from this level may have intruded from level
Jb, which dates from the Early Upper Paleolithic, given
that the sample recovered from the middle of this level,
roughly 0.22 m deep, gave a result of 30.8 Ka calBP.

A decline in the use of flint may be observed between
the older and more modern Mousterian levels. In Levels
O-L over 40% of the artefacts are made of flint, in con-
trast with the more modern Mousterian occupation (Level
K), which contains only 13% made of flint. However, the
scarcity of artefacts in this level means that the signifi-
cance of these results is limited. No rodents were found
in Levels L to N and the most positive results for these
were found in the most modern level in the Mousterian
sequence (Level K). Their study (Povoas et al., 1992)
reveals the existence of very dry open areas (containing
Allocricetus bursae and a large amount of Microtus arvalis)
together with forest areas (containing Apodemus sylvaticus
and Eliomys quercinus).

2.4.3. Gruta da Oliveira (Torres Novas)

The action of water in the River Almonda karst sys-
tem, which is still being formed, led to the opening up of
a series of cavities at decreasingly and successively more
recent altitudes in the rocky massif that forms part of the
“arrife” area of the Aire mountains, overlooking the vast
plain formed by Tertiary and Quaternary sediments to the
south.

This cave is still being excavated, under the supervi-
sion of João Zilhão (Fig. 15), and no definitive results can
be presented at the moment. The first published results
refer to a deposit initially attributed to an alluvial cone,
the “Mousterian cone”, found in 1989 and corresponding
to a secondary sedimentary accumulation within the karst
system above the present entrance to the Almonda cave,
due to the collapse of a gallery from a higher level where
the Gruta de Oliveira cave is situated. This deposit con-
tains a large amount of faunal remains and lithic industry
(around 250 artefacts), mainly made of flint (50%), with
a high incidence of the Levallois technique and many
retouched tools (scrapers, denticulates). The fauna con-
sists exclusively of ungulates (there is only one example 
of carnivore amongst the 240 fragments of deer, horse,
mountain goat, rhinoceros, rabbit and turtle bones)

and may therefore be attributed
to the hunting activities of the
human group established there,
particularly as around 20% 
of these remains show signs of
burning. Two dates have been
obtained by U/Th from a horse’s
tooth, giving a weighted average
result of 61.5 Ka BP, which is
compatible with the typologi-
cal characteristics of the lithic
assemblage (Zilhão &amp;amp; McKin-
ney, 1995). The deposit there-
fore corresponds to the oldest
Mousterian occupation of the
cave, which, in total, is 6 m deep
and is sealed by a thick level of
stalagmites.

The most modern Mouste-
rian occupation corresponds to
Level 8 in the general sequence,
dated at between 38 and 37 Ka
calBP (Zilhão, 2006). In con-
trast to what was found in the
“Mousterian cone”, the tools,
which show evidence of the Le-
vallois technique, are mainly
quartzite, followed by flint, then
quartz. This trend towards the
underepresentation of flint is
even more accentuated in the
deeper levels (Levels 9, 10, 11
and 12). In Level 9, the radial
chipping technology is much
more evident in comparison with
Level 8, featuring in roughly
54% of the total number of
items classified. In both levels it
can be seen that the use of raw
materials such as quartzite and
quartz has not produced items
of inferior quality obtained by
more expeditious technological
means, as is commonly thought
to be the case in Peninsular
Mousterian contexts (Marks, Mo-
nigal &amp;amp; Zilhão, 2001). In fact, it
is in the finer-grained pieces of quartzite, rather than in the
flint, that the application of a refined Levallois technique
can be observed (Fig. 16), and this can also be seen indi-
rectly in the fact that the quartzite flakes are not, on aver-
age, larger in size than those made of flint. The Oliveira
cave therefore confirms what is already known from pre-
vious studies on the Gruta da Figueira Brava and the Gruta
Nova da Columbeira, which have always emphasised the
important presence of quartz and quartzite in Mousterian
associations in Portuguese territory.

The deepest levels reveal an abundance of lithic indus-
try, although this has not been properly studied yet, which
precedes the date established for Level 9 of 44-43 Ka
calBP and probably represents the oldest date of the
“Mousterian cone”. A large quantity of turtle and rabbit
remains have been recovered from these older levels, which

show signs of burning, an indication that they had been
destined for human consumption (information supplied
personally by João Zilhão).

The sedimentation is continuous until Level 9, then
between this level and Level 8 there is a stalagmite crust
deposit, indicating a significant discontinuity in the sedi-
mentation. This may be linked to climate change since,
whilst from Level 10 onwards certain species indicate the
existence of open landscapes and a temperate-cold climate
(mountain goat, horse and rhinoceros), these are absent
in Level 8, in which deer are the only large ungulates pre-
sent out of roughly 300 remains that have been identified
(Brugal, in Zilhão, 2001). There is also a low incidence
of carnivores (fox, leopard and bear) and, in particular, of
a hyena cave. These observations, considered in conjunc-
tion with the frequent signs of cutting and burning on

the deer remains, suggest that they are connected with
human hunting activity. In terms of small mammals,
Apodemus sylvaticus and Eliomys quercinus together make
up approximately 96% of the rodents from this period,
indicating a Mediterranean climate (Zilhão, 2006). More-
over, it is this environment that explains the existence of
turtle and rabbit remains, which are particularly abundant
in the older levels in the sequence. This evidence indi-
cates the non-selective capture of faunistic resources by
humans in the immediate vicinity of the cave.

In addition, the reduction of the territories in which
these resources could be captured during the Mousterian
period is suggested (Zilhão, 2001) by a reduction in the
use of flint, between the oldest dated occupation, corres-
ponding to the “Mousterian cone”, where, out of the 250
artefacts recovered, around 50% are of flint, 30%
quartzite and 20% quartz and the more modern Mous-
terian occupations, represented by Levels 8 to 12. In sup-
port of this theory, the absence of mountain goat in the
more modern deposits should be noted, in contrast with
its presence in the older levels although its absence may
in fact correspond to other causes such as a rise in tem-
perature after an eventual colder period in around 38-37
Ka calBP, as indicated by the exclusive presence of red
deer amongst the fauna hunted at that time.

Three human remains recovered from the deeper lev-
els have been classified as Neanderthal, given that the
associated lithic technology is clearly Mousterian.

2.4.4. Gruta da Furninha (Peniche)

The formation of this cave, which nowadays over-
looks the sea, is related to a platform caused by marine
abrasion of approximately 15 m above sea level. The filling
in of a vertical aven approximately 10 m high inside the
cave is therefore more recent than the marine episode
which, using altimetric criteria, correlates with the last in-
terglacial period (Breuil &amp;amp; Zbyszewski, 1942). Excavations

carried out in 1879 by J. F.
Nery Delgado (Delgado, 1884)
were undertaken in compliance
with the best scientific standards
of the time, and careful records
were kept of the stratigraphy
and positions of all the lithic
industries and bones recovered,
which are still preserved today in
the Geological Museum in Lis-
bon. The Pleistocene sequence
consisted of a conglomerate at
the bottom, containing few fau-
nal remains, followed by a thick
sedimentary complex separated
from the former by a stalagmite
crust, revealing discontinuity in
the sedimentation. This succes-
sion consisted of seven fossilife-
rous bone levels, separated by
abandonment episodes consisting
of eolic sands.

The largest lithic and faunis-
tic assemblage comes from the
third and second fossiliferous

levels. From level 3 an elongated Upper Acheulean biface
was recovered, made from unsmoothed flint. The typolo-
gy of the associated flint items lies mainly within the
Mousterian period, revealing mixtures caused by circula-
tion currents within the cave. These mixtures were noted
by Nery Delgado and later assessed by Joaquim Fontes,
who carried out a review of the lithic materials and iden-
tified some Mousterian items (Fontes, 1916: Pl. 1), later
confirmed by Breuil and Zbyszewski (1942).

The existence of Mousterian tools mixed with osteo-
logical remains can be explained by the aforementioned
mixtures, given that the coexistence of humans with large
carnivores, essentially represented by the striped hyena
(Hyaena hyaena prisca) and a small wolf (Canis lupus lunel-
lensis), is not plausible. Proof of this lies in the fact,
Joaquim Fontes emphasised that half a Canis lupus radius
did not appeared to have been transported to any signifi-
cant distance and was recovered from the second level
whilst the other half was recovered 1.30 m above it from
another level. Although it is certain that movement
occurred, there are no doubts that this Mousterian cave is
contemporary with the striped hyena.

A U/Th date suggests the formation of this sequence
c. 80.88 Ka BP (+42.42; -31.26 Ka). Despite a high level
of uncertainty, this result is compatible with the older
chronology of the last interglacial when the cave was
formed; it is also compatible with the Mousterian indus-
try recovered from it.

The upper part of the accumulation, a level 1.5 m
deep of fine micaceous eolic sands correlating with the
Pleniglacial when the shore lay several kilometres away,
revealing a vast and windswept sandy coastal plain. The
small amount of industry recovered from the Upper Pale-
olithic is connected with this final phase in the filling in
of the aven, and includes two Solutrean laurel leaves and
a single-sided blade, separated by H. Breuil and G.
Zbyszewski in 1942 from the assemblage of a Neolithic
necropolis later established inside the cave.

2.4.5. Gruta Nova da
Columbeira (Bombarral)

Explored in 1962 by O. da
Veiga Ferreira and G. Zbyszews-
ki, this constitutes one of the
most complete and rich Mous-
terian stratigraphic successions
ever identified in Portugal. The
stratigraphic sequence and the
associated artefacts from each of
the levels identified are clearly
defined (contra Marks, Monigal
&amp;amp; Zilhão, 2001).

The cave, surrounded by a
landscape of Jurassic limestone
(Fig. 17), is set halfway up the
left-hand slope of the Roto val-
ley, which is cut deeply into the
karst landscape. It consists of a
high thin gallery, approximately
20 m long, on average 3 to 4 m
wide and roughly 10 m high.
The stratigraphy observed in
successive vertical cuts consists
of a maximum of 10 levels (Fig.
18) which are almost always separated by a fine stalag-
mite film, indicating a possible halt in sedimentation and
in occupation (Zbyszewski, 1963; Ferreira, 1966). The
last campaign in 1971, under the direction of J. Roche,
aimed to record a more detailed stratigraphic succession.
Two dates were obtained for the levels corresponding to
the base of the sequence, with the following results: 26.4
± 0.75 Ka C14 BP (Level 7) and 28. 9 ± 0.95 Ka C14
BP (Level 8). The poor quality of the samples was cited
by the laboratory (Delibrias et al., 1986). Nevertheless,
these two levels, and in particular Level 8, correspond to
the most intensive human occupation of the cave, under-
lined by the presence of a significant accumulation of
charcoal and ashes resulting from prolonged burning that
had taken place there and whose presence is duly separate
and uncontaminated from a stratigraphic point of view
(Ferreira, 1984; Cardoso, Raposo &amp;amp; Ferreira, 2002). There
appear to be no valid reasons, from an empirical point of
view, for rejecting the results that were obtained (contra
Zilhão, 2006), which, in addition, agree with the corres-
ponding stratigraphy. It is possible that the reserve
expressed by the laboratory where the samples were
processed are mainly due to an a posteriori attempt to
explain the results obtained which would have appeared
excessively recent.

Therefore the results which, after calibration, place
the Mousterian occupation of the cave within the period
between 34 and 31 Ka calBP are relevant to the discus-
sion concerning the last European Neanderthals (Cardoso,
Raposo &amp;amp; Ferreira, 2002). As J. Zilhão points out, the
fact that these results may fall within the chronology of
the Aurignacian and Gravettian periods in the region does
not constitute a decisive counter argument, since it is not
possible to determine a precise chronology for the start of
the Upper Paleolithic in the region.

J. Zilhão also observes that if such a modern chrono-
logy is accepted for the two levels that have been dated,

then the deposits which follow them must be even more
modern, even from the Solutrean period, which would
contradict the Mousterian chronology indicated by their
respective industries (Zilhão, 2006). In fact, Level 7 cor-
responds to the most modern effective human occupation
of the cave. Level 6 corresponds to the establishment in
the cave of a hyena lair indicated by the presence of
numerous coprolites, and the amount of artefacts decrea-
ses abruptly – a situation which can be observed even
more clearly in the two more modern levels. Level 8, con-
taining 2,433 artefacts, is followed by Level 7 which has
1,880; Level 6 contains only 677 artefacts 56 and 107
respectively in Levels 5 and 4, the most modern in the
sequence containing lithic industries, indicating the possi-
bility that it continued to be occupied sporadically over a
period of time that is impossible to determine but cannot
have lasted longer than a few centuries.

In conclusion, Levels 8 and 7 correspond to the “main
levels of human occupation of the cave and the only ones
in which it is possible to accept the hypothesis of consis-
tent occupations involving continuous residence” (Car-
doso, Raposo &amp;amp; Ferreira, 2002: 50).

The lithic industries of the Gruta Nova de Colum-
beira were attributed to the techo-typological group
known as “Mousterian with denticulates”, with Levallois
debitage and Levallois facies (Fig. 19).

Given the rarity and the controversy surrounding si-
milar occurrences, it is also worth noting the presence of
certain bones which had been broken deliberately and
used as tools, as can be deduced by the marks that remain
on them (Barandiarán &amp;amp; Ferreira, 1971; Cardoso, Raposo
&amp;amp; Ferreira, 2002).

There is a marked diversity in the use of raw mate-
rials throughout the entire sequence, revealing a trend
towards an increase in the use of flint and a correspon-
ding reduction in the use of quartz and stable levels for
quartzite. However, this does not mean that this increase

tion, see text. Archiv of O. da Veiga Ferreira.



of flint can be attributed to an extension of the territories
from which resources were gathered. The geology of the
surrounding area shows that flint could have been
obtained in the form of nodules or smoothed pebbles
from the limestone outcrops, including the massif in
which the cave itself is set, whilst quartz and quartzite
were plentiful in the lowlands nearby that extended to the
sea. Moreover, this increasing demand for flint is not
accompanied by any increase in its use; the rate at which
it was processed into tools decreased, in contrast to the
use made of quartz and particularly quartzite. Thus,
the greater demand for flint did not compromise but, in
fact, stimulated the use made of the other raw materials

and did not correspond to an
evolutionary pattern that heral-
ded the Upper Paleolithic; 
on the contrary, it was obser-
ved in the “Mousterianisation”,
along the stratigraphic sequen-
ce, of the industries.

Evidently alternating use
was made of the cave by humans
and predators and the levels
which reveal the most inten-
sive human occupation are
also those which contain the
smallest amount of carnivore
remains. In Level 8, which has
a high concentration of carbon
resulting from prolonged bur-
ning, only one wolf radius was
recovered and in Level 7, three
sets of hyena, in contrast with
the abundance of lithic industry
already mentioned. Conversely,
the levels containing the largest
collection of carnivore remains
in the central part of the fill
contained very little lithic indus-
try. Lastly, the upper levels, bea-
ring no traces of human pre-
sence, are characterised by the
presence of birds, including birds
of prey and the remains of the
prey with which they are nor-
mally associated.

The composition of the
large mammal fauna (Cardoso,
1993) suggests temperate cli-
matic conditions, with some
cold and dry spells, favourable
for the presence of Capra pyre-
naica (mountain goat) which
was also well-adapted to the
surrounding stony landscape that
forms part of the Estremadura
environment of low mountain
outcrops under a strong ocean
climatic influence. The existence
of several rhinoceros (Dicerorhi-
nus hemitoechus) milk teeth in-
dicates opportunistic hunting
involving the capture of youn-
ger and weaker animals. How-

ever, as all the examples of this species are restricted to
Level 6 (Cardoso, 1993), which corresponds to the hyena
lair, these remains may be linked to the activities of this
carnivore.

The most interesting of the faunal elements is the ter-
restrial turtle (Testudo hermanni) since this is clearly the
Portuguese site which contains the largest amount of
remains of this species (Jiménez Fuentes, Cardoso &amp;amp; Cres-
po, 1998). This species prefers coastal areas at altitudes of
no more than 500-600 m and a Mediterranean environ-
ment. Nowadays its circum-Mediterranean distribution
seems to be influenced in particular by a need for sum-
mer, rather than winter, heat and rain. Although the

adults can withstand tempera-
tures of up to 10° or even 20°
below zero, embryo develop-
ment requires high tempera-
tures, with an optimum of
around 30 ºC but never below
20 ºC. As the turtles reproduce
in summer and incubation lasts
roughly 2.5 months, between
June and August/September they
need temperatures that remain
close to this optimum. It is
without doubt due to the lack
of these conditions that the
species became extinct in Por-
tuguese territory long before the
end of the last glaciation, as it
had been unable to support the
climatic deterioration that took
place soon after the cave was
occupied. Of the 349 remains
identified, 338 came from Level
8, which contains the greatest
amount of evidence of human
presence. There is no doubt that they had been caught by
humans and that this had been easy to accomplish, a fact
that also lay behind the rapid extinction of the species.

It is important to emphasise the lack of sea molluscs,
which would have indicated an opportunistic, non-spe-
cialised use of the resources potentially available in the
territory immediately adjacent to the cave; however, the
importance of the anthropic deposits suggests a residential
type of settlement.

In conclusion, although the chronometric information
merits additional efforts in terms of revision/conformity,
the abundance of lithic industry attributed exclusively 
to the Mousterian, the abundance of faunal associations
that have been recovered and the relationship that may be
established between the two assemblages throughout the
stratigraphic sequence, one of the most complete in 
the Mousterian, and finally, the discovery of a human
tooth with Neanderthal characteristics on top of Level 9
(Level 10 is sterile), in contact with Level 7 in a sector
where Level 8 is missing (Ferreira, 1966; Ferembach,
1964/1965; Antunes et al., 2000), are all factors which
make this cave an important site in the Late Iberian
Mousterian period (Raposo &amp;amp; Cardoso, 1998b; Cardoso,
Raposo &amp;amp; Ferreira, 2002: figs. 15-17).

2.4.6. The Salemas cave and quarry (Loures)

The former, which was explored in 1961, became
famous as a result of the Upper Paleolithic sequence that
was identified there. At the base of the fill, an archaeolo-
gical level from the Middle Paleolithic period was observed,
containing some fairly untypical materials geologically
associated with a faunal assemblage also resulting from
remobilisations within the cave lasting for an undeter-
mined period of time. A date obtained for a set of these
remains –thus revealing the average age of the assemblage
itself– gave a result of ca. 25 Ka H calBP (Antunes et al.,
1989), which appears too modern for the industry in
question, even though it is not typical. A deciduous

human tooth was also recovered from here and studied
(Ferembach, 1962) in a recent review, which confirmed
that it belonged to a Neanderthal (Antunes, 2000). Near-
by a stratigraphic succession was observed which had
accumulated in a deep aven in the Cretaceous limestone
occurring at the front of a quarry. The base level, con-
taining plentiful faunal remains, also revealed an abun-
dant assemblage of Mousterian materials made from
blocks of whitish flint available locally that had never been
studied in detail. An assemblage of bones of large mam-
mals was dated at between 27.17 Ka BP (+1.0; -0.9 Ka)
and 29.82 Ka BP (+1.13; -0.98 Ka) (Antunes et al.,
1989), corresponding to an average of c. 34.6 Ka calBP
(Zilhão, 2006). Although the faunal assemblage had only
a geological relationship with the Mousterian materials, it
does not appear to be reasonable to doubt the contempo-
rary nature of both deposits (contra Zilhão, 2006) and
we believe that this date is valid for the Mousterian occu-
pation of the limestone outcrops in the region.

2.4.7. Gruta da Figueira Brava (Setúbal)

Directly overlooking the sea and set in a miocenic cal-
carenite massif on the south side of the Arrábida moun-
tains to the west of Portinho da Arrábida, various excava-
tion campaigns were carried out in this cave at the end of
the 1980s (Antunes, 1990/1991). The entrance to the for-
mer shelter was gradually filled in by calcium carbonate
precipitates (Fig. 20). Only a small part of the interior
has been explored but the stratigraphic, faunal and archae-
ological records emphasise the importance of this site. The
stratigraphic sequence in the area excavated consists of
materials that have been remobilised from other parts 
of the interior of the cave.

The base of the sequence corresponds to a conglom-
erate related to the raised, level beach measuring 5-8 m,
which is well preserved in the outer part of the cave, as
in the whole of the Arrábida southern coast (Teixeira &amp;amp;

Zbyszewski, 1949) and can be attributed to an interstadial
form at the beginning of the last glaciation period. How-
ever, two recent radiometric dates on shells from the Forte
da Baralha conglomerate deposit to the west of Sesimbra
indicate a much more recent chronology of ca. 37 Ka
calBP e 38 Ka calBP (Pereira &amp;amp; Angelucci, 2004). As the
occupation of the shelter had been dated at around 36 Ka
calBP –an absolute date for human occupation using
limpet shells (Patella sp.) gave statistically identical results
of 30.05 ± 550 Ka BP e 30.93 ± 0.7 Ka BP (Antunes et
al., 1989)– it was concluded that this must have taken
place immediately after the formation of the conglome-
rate deposit. However, the results obtained at Forte de
Baralha have to be seen as corresponding to the minimum
age of the corresponding deposits. In fact, the level of the
sea at the time, would have been approximately 60 m
lower than its present day level.

The results presented by these two authors also seem
incompatible with the actual faunal record identified in
the Gruta da Figueira Brava for two reasons. Firstly, it
would be impossible, if the sea reached the entrance of
the cave, to catch large mammals such as elephant/mam-
moth, aurochs, rhinoceros or horses, also incompatible
with the mountain land overlooking the submerged area
of Arrábida. These species could only have been caught
on the vast coastal plain if it was exposed and extending
to the east to the estuary of the River Sado (Antunes &amp;amp;
Cardoso, 2000). Secondly, the aforementioned fossil level
contained an abundance of Patella safiana remains, clearly
a southern mollusc abundant nowadays on the Moroccan
rather than the Portuguese coast (Choffat &amp;amp; Dollfus,
1904/1905). The presence of this species, and of Pectun-
culus bimaculatus, a mediterranean species also present,
indicates warmer waters and is obviously incompatible
with the opposite indication supplied by the molluscs at
the Figueira Brava cave. Therefore, the dates published in
2004 for the 5-8 m level at Forte da Baralha are not
acceptable, particularly since previous attempts made by
the same laboratory on identical material from the same
origin led by a team including the author, proved incon-
clusive due to lack of collagen.

The conglomerate level, which mainly consists of
Jurassic limestone pebbles, was identified inside the cave,
lying directly on the miocenic substrate. This conglome-
rate is followed by a series of fine carbon beds, resulting
from the lixiviation and transport of the products of com-
bustion from fireplaces in other areas of the cave, which
can also be observed presently in the exterior of the cave.
This is followed by a red, fossiliferous level, containing an
abundant lithic industry resulting from a similar process,
crossed by irregular whitish veins of calcium carbonate
(Level 2). The upper part of this level contains Roman
and Islamic materials mixed with the remains of domestic
mammals, shells and birds, and the series is sealed from
above by a stalagmite bed which is still forming today.

From an archaeological point of view, approximately
four thousand artefacts have been studied, or approxi-
mately two and a half thousand if the splinters from chip-
ping are excluded (Cardoso &amp;amp; Raposo, 1995; Raposo &amp;amp;
Cardoso, 2000a, b). Within this assemblage, the lithic
industry appears to be expeditious, with no artefacts dis-
playing any notable typological outlines due to the poor
quality of the raw material, dominated by quartz pebbles

of local origin. Some rare flint items occur, probably ori-
ginating from the S. Luís mountains 10 kilometres away.
Chipping from Mousterian centripetal disc cores predo-
minates; amongst the retouched tools there is a prevalence
of scrapers, followed by denticulates and notches. Accor-
ding to the traditional typological diagnostic criteria applied
to Middle Paleolithic assemblages, the Figueira Brava indus-
try corresponds to a Typical Mousterian, rich in denticu-
lates of non-Levallois debitage and facies (Fig. 21).

The significant invertebrate marine fauna confirms a
strong aquatic element in the diet of the Neanderthal po-
pulations based in what was, at the time, a large shelter.
In addition to molluscs (indicating waters that were, in
general, slightly cooler) there was also included crustaceans
such as Maja squinado and Cancer pagurus, whose pincers
have been deliberately broken to enable the soft flesh to
be extracted (Callapez, 2000).

The Gruta da Figueira Brava is the most important
set of paleoclimatic indicators around 36 Ka calBP. All
the molluscs belong to species that still exist in the area.
Amongst them, the great predominance of Patella vulgata,
which is common nowadays on the coast of Galicia and
the Asturias and has been replaced on the central and
southern coast of Portugal by P. intermedia, which fea-
tures rarely in the assemblage, suggests the existence of
colder waters than nowadays in the area (Callapez, 2000).
The avifauna is also a valuable indicator: in addition to
various extinct species, there are 3 species from a colder
climate than nowadays and 2 species from a Mediter-
ranean climate that is incompatible with a cold climate.
The majority of the species indicate a temperate climate,
including 3 species that nest nowadays in more northern
regions, but may be found in this area during the winter
season. The conclusion reached by authors is that of a cli-
mate colder than nowadays but sufficiently warm and
with sunny summers, to allow for the existence of
Mediterranean species (Mourer-Chauviré &amp;amp; Antunes,
2000). The study of insectivores, chiroptera and lago-
morphs (Mein &amp;amp; Antunes, 2000) led to conclusions that
were compatible with those previously cited: the associa-
tion of Mediterranean with nordic elements, indicating a
climate colder than nowadays and a fairly substantial
amount of forest and rocky terrain. Rodents (Jeannet,
2000) also suggest a cool temperate climate

The faunal record therefore indicates that, as the cave
overlooked the coastal plain at the time, it was here that
the majority of the animals were caught, including the
elephant or even the mammoth (Antunes &amp;amp; Cardoso,
1991), both by humans and by other predators from the
cave, such as the leopard, cave lion, hyena, wolf and griz-
zly bear, alternating with humans in their use of the cave.
However, unlike the Gruta Nova da Columbeira, it was
not possible to demonstrate clearly how this human occu-
pation alternated with that of the carnivores, given the
characteristics of the stratigraphic record.

In the rocky and more mountainous area of the
Arrábida range, Capra pyrenaica remains were also recog-
nised in the faunal assemblage, representing the second
most frequent species of large mammal to be identified
(ca. 22%) after the red deer (Cervus elaphus) (Cardoso,
1993). This situation indicates the exploitation of various
biotopes near the cave, a situation that appears identical to
that which has been observed in the other Estremadura

caves with significant Mouste-
rian occupations. The human
occupation is therefore residen-
tial in type, associated with the
systematic and non-specialised
use of the various food resources
available in the surrounding area,
from the shore to the mountain
area, including the coastal plain.
Underlying this proposition is
the abundance of marine species,
indicating a systematic collec-
tion from along the rocky or
sandy shore, both in the inter-
tidal and infralitoral areas inclu-
ding crustaceans. The area in
which the food resources were
obtained would not extended
beyond the area surrounding 
the site. The exception is the
whitish or sometimes streaked
flint, which came from the São
Luís mountains roughly 10 km
away in a straight line. However,
the scarcity of this raw material
(161 cores and debitage pro-
ducts out of a total of 3,848
items and 21 tools out of a total
of 358) (Raposo &amp;amp; Cardoso,
2000) is clear proof of the infre-
quent use made of this resource,
despite its obvious advantages
given the poor quality of the
local rock, and it reinforces 
the local, though prolonged,
nature of the human occupation.

As in the Gruta Nova da
Columbeira, bones were identi-
fied that had been deliberately
broken and used (Cardoso, 1993:
fig. 13, n.º 5; Antunes, 2000).
The human presence in this cave
is also exemplified by a tooth
which clearly has Neanderthal
characteristics (Antunes et al.,
2000).

2.5. The Hesperian Massif caves

2.5.1. Gruta do Escoural (Montemor-o-Novo)

This is the southernmost of the caves bearing evidence
of a Mousterian occupation. It is a karst cave accidentally
discovered in 1963 during quarry blasting and became
famous for the parietal paleolithic art identified shortly
afterwards (Santos, 1964). The existence of quartz mate-
rials from the Middle Paleolithic, recovered during exca-
vation work carried out under the supervision of M. Fari-
nha dos Santos, including nuclei of various types and
retouched flakes, was observed by the author in the
National Archaeology museum in 1989.

The Mousterian classification for some of these mate-
rials recovered from a fissure in the exterior of the cave

(Santos, 1985: 140) is due to the work of M. Farinha dos
Santos, so the presence of a Middle Paleolithic occupa-
tion was not unknown at the time when the cave was
re-excavated between 1989 and 1992. Many quartz arte-
facts were recovered at this time, near the area already
noted by Farinha dos Santos but inside the cave, corres-
ponding to its original entrance area (Silva et al., 1991).

A large amount of hyena remains, in association with
coprolites, occurring as a remarkable continuous level inside
the cave and related with the aforementioned Middle Paleo-
lithic occupation, show that human occupation of the cave
would have been unfeasible for long periods of time, and
most of the remains of ungulantes that have been identi-
fied must be connected with the activities of these and
other carnivores such as the leopard (Cardoso, 1993).

vered from a stratigraphic cut made in 1992 into the

aforementioned deposits inside the cave gave a result of
48.9 Ka BP (+5.8; -5.5 Ka) (Araújo &amp;amp; Lejeune, 1995),
compatible with the characteristics of the lithic industry,
still awaiting a detailed publication.

2.6. The Algarve

Although mousterian industries were documented
some time ago in Algarve, particularly in the eastern area,
through the pioneering work of G. Zbyszewski and A.
Viana in the 1940s, most of the collected pieces are from
surface. Nevertheless, some sites provided some typical
samples, with a particular emphasis on centripetal disc
cores made from quartzite pebbles, a raw material that
was plentiful in the Quaternary gravel beds of ancient
beaches along the present coastline (Viana &amp;amp; Zbyszewski,
1949; Raposo, 1997).

Recently a study programme on western part of the
Algarve resulted in an preliminary overview of the occu-
pation strategy and of the use of biotic and abiotic
resources during the Mousterian (Bicho, 2004). Open air
sites have been found at the edge of temporary lagoons
such as Lagoa Funda 1, 2 and 3 and Lagoa do Bordoal,
at altitudes of no more than 150 m, together coastal areas
such as the Praia da Galé and others including Vale Boi
(a rocky shelter roughly 3 km away from the ocean coast)
and the Ibn Amar cave, now located on the left-hand
bank of the estuary of the River Arade, facing Portimão.

The fauna has not been preserved in the open-air sites.
Only the Ibn Amar cave and Vale Boi provided a econom-
ic indicators of subsistence strategies.

In the former (Fig. 22) it is important to emphasise the
presence of fish and mollusc remains, together with medi-
um-sized and small terrestrial mammals which had been
caught (deer, ass and rabbit), as evidence non-specialised

hunting and compatible with
the wide range of resources availa-
ble, which (as seen in the caves
in Estremadura) also included
the terrestrial turtle (Testudo sp.)
and fish. The high density of the
occupation is indicated by the
fact that only 1 m2 yelded over
200 artefacts with mousterian
characteristics, together with a
variety of raw materials, which
included mainly quartz but also
flint, quartzite and even lime-
stone (a discoid core).

Vale Boi was another site
which provided faunal remains.
The levels below the oldest
Upper Paleolithic occupation,
separated by 0.35 m of sterile
layer, supplied untypical arte-
facts of quartz, flint and quartzite.
These materials were associated
with burnt bones, mainly from
rabbits, and shells. Once again,
there was evidence of small-
scale hunting, as well as a coas-
tal gathering strategy clearly

local in range, the best example of which is Gruta da
Figueira Brava.

The use of quartz and quartzite is also evidence of
local supply strategies, with the exception of flint which,
in some cases, may have come from roughly 30 km away.
Two flint quarries have been identified for this period
(Vale Santo 3 and Curva do Belixe) near the western
boundary of the region, yielding flint nodules from the
Jurassic limestone, sometimes measuring around 20 cm
in diameter (Bicho, 2004). Only nuclei were found at
both sites, indicating that debitage products, whether
processed or not, would have been exported to other
areas, probably including the Praia da Galé site approxi-
mately 30 km away.

3. Ecology, economy, subsistence bases, demographic
patterns

Important sites from the Mousterian, including both
open-air and cave and rock shelters, have been identified
and excavated. There were great restrictions on producing
any suitable characterisation of the former type due to the
effects of erosion, which has prevented the preservation of
extensive stratigraphic and faunal elements. It is possible
that in most cases site occupation was intensive and
lengthy, of residential type, given the abundance of the
remains that are dispersed, in most cases, over wide areas.
This is the case with the sites on the outskirts of Lisbon,
in which flint was used intensively, as well as the Casca-
lheira and Conceição sites, amongst others, on the other
side of the large Tejo estuary, with almost exclusive use of
raw materials available locally, consisting of quartzite peb-
bles carried by the Tejo from the Hesperic Massif. Howe-
ver, the shortage of information, due to the lack of exten-
sive excavation works, does not allow the full understanding

River estuary (photo supplied by N. Bicho).



of the organisation of the inhabited areas, their limits and
the possible existence of intra-site areas devoted to specific
activities.

Taking into account the published data, the two open-
air sites located in the Upper Portuguese Tejo area (in the
Vila Velha de Ródão region) apparently have distinctive
characteristics. Both the Foz de Enxarrique and Vilas
Ruivas sites appear to correspond mainly to a logistic
camp sites, particularly the latter, not only because of the
smaller amount of catalogued evidence but also due to
the prevailing hunting activities. This can be seen, on the
one hand, in the very large percentage of deer bones
showing signs of cutting and breaking at Foz do Enxar-
rique, located on a small platform where the Tejo is joined
by the Enxarrique stream, a favourable location for a tem-
porary specialised site periodically flooded. It can also be
seen in the structures that may be classified as fireplaces
(Raposo, 1995) or hunting blinds (using the terminology
of L. Binford) according to João Zilhão (Zilhão, 2001) in
Vilas Ruivas, together with the small concentration of
materials observed there.

The importance of the stratigraphic sequences of some
of the caves, such as the Gruta da Oliveira and the Gruta
Nova da Columbeira indicate residential types of sites,
with prolonged and recurrent characteristics. The Gruta
da Figueira Brava also appears to indicate this type of
occupation, although clearly it is not possible in any 
of these cases to determine the duration of human presence
nor, in most cases, any possible seasonal occupation. How-
ever, whilst certain sites indicate short-term occupation
due to the scarcity of the artefacts found and the poor
stratigraphic record –as in the case of Lapa dos Furos,
where only seven artefacts were identified, corresponding
to a date of 40 Ka calBP as a terminus post quem for the
Mousterian occupation (Zilhão, 2006)– the Gruta da
Figueira Brava was certainly occupied in spring and sum-
mer, given the abundance of young rabbits that had clear-
ly been caught by humans (Mein &amp;amp; Antunes, 2000). It is
clear that their occupation of the cave alternated with that
of carnivores, as observed in other caves dating from the
same period (Gruta do Caldeirão, Gruta do Escoural,
Gruta Nova da Columbeira).

The area in which resources were gathered –including
raw material for manufacturing artefacts– was always
restricted to the area surrounding each site and was char-
acterised by a non-specialised economy of hunting-gathe-
ring. Medium-sized mammals clearly predominated, such
as red deer and horse, common at the time in their respec-
tive biotopes and indicative of open land, or correspon-
ding more to forest areas. The scarcity of certain species
such as auroch is mainly due to the difficulty involved in
capturing them.

Six deciduous rhinoceros teeth (D. hemitoechus) were
recovered from Level 6 of the Gruta Nova da Columbeira;
however, as the human presence is slight in this level, the
presence of this species may be attributed to the activities of
large predators and the same may be true of a fragment
of jawbone containing two molars worn to the roots at
Gruta da Figueira Brava, corresponding to an old indivi-
dual. This was also the pattern witnessed in Lorga de
Dine, where there is no evidence of any compatible
human occupation (Cardoso, 1993).

Nevertheless, the hunting of large mammals is clearly
documented by the aurochs (and eventually by the elephant

and the mammoth); some deliberately broken auroch
bones had been transformed into various tools.

The hunting of medium-sized prey is documented
both in Gruta Nova da Columbeira and Gruta da Figueira
Brava. The majority of the remains consisted of deer
(almost 60% in the former and 34% in the latter) whilst
other species such as horse and mountain goat were also
present but in differing amounts due to the nature of their
respective biotopes (the contribution made by carnivores
cannot be quantified, but would have been much lower,
bearing in mind the number of remains preserved, parti-
cularly in Levels 8 and 9 of the Gruta Nova da Colum-
beira, as previously emphasised).

The exclusive presence of red deer amongst the fauna
hunted at Gruta da Oliveira in the most modern Mous-
terian levels dated at 38-37 Ka calBP indicates a more
temperate climate, perhaps warmer than the one corres-
ponding to the presence of this species in the two pre-
vious caves (36 Ka calBP for Gruta da Figueira Brava and
34-31 Ka calBP for Gruta Nova da Columbeira, if these
results are to be accepted, given the reasons previously
explained), both of which indicate a temperate but cooler
climate than nowadays, due to the presence of the moun-
tain goat. Thus a climatic cooling would have begun ca. 36
Ka calBP, leading gradually to the full pleniglacial, a con-
clusion that has been presented previously on the basis of
the study of large Pleistocene mammals (Cardoso, 1993).

The frequent presence of the terrestrial turtle, which
is largest in terms of amount in Level 8 of Gruta Nova
da Columbeira indicates a higher anthropic incidence.
The same conclusion may be extended to the remains of
this species originating in the deeper levels of the Gruta
da Oliveira, which are carbonised, like the rabbit remains
associated with them. In fact, both species are plentiful in
most of the caves showing human mousterian occupation
–and also marked in the Gruta de Ibn Amar (Bicho,
2004)– although they differ in quantity, indicating a prac-
tice of the hunting of small animals, which seems to have
been common throughout the Late Mousterian period.

In addition, the importance of gathering molluscs
from the shore should also be stressed in the areas nearest
to the coast, such as Gruta da Figueira Brava and Gruta
de Ibn Amar, where fishing has also been recorded. In the
former, the marine prey also extended to crustaceans
(Maja squinado, Cancer pagurus), whose pincers were
found deliberately broken (Callapez, 2000), and marine
mammals such as the common dolphin (Delphinus del-
phis) and the ringed seal (Pusa hispida), both represented
by one individual (Antunes, 2000). These may correspond
to the secondary exploitation of animals washed up on
the shore (or captured on it, in the case of the seal), 
with the the latter species indicating a colder climate than
nowadays. This is a clear indication of the importance
of the marine resources gathered and consumed in the
cave, at present a unique evidence in Portuguese territo-
ry in terms of the variety and abundance of the remains
preserved.

It can therefore be concluded that the claim made by
Nuno Bicho (Bicho, 2004) cannot be confirmed, accor-
ding to whom the pattern for settlements in the Algarve
during the Mousterian period would have been very dif-
ferent to that of Estremadura, on the basis of the pre-
sence of small prey (turtle and rabbit), in association with

João Luís Cardoso / The Mousterian complex in Portugal 45

aquatic fauna. This association can also be seen in
Estremadura where the aquatic contribution could even
be more significative.

The fact that this practise has not been recorded in
the Gruta Nova da Columbeira, located approximately 10
km away from the present coastline indicates that the co-
rresponding territories were, in fact, restricted in size.

These territories may also have varied in size over
time. Taking as comparison the percentage of flint items
–a rock whose specific features were preferred in general
to others– found in the two most complete stratigraphic
sequences studied, it can be seen that the use of flint
declined in the Gruta da Oliveira between the earliest and
most modern Mousterian occupations. It may therefore
be concluded that the respective territories for gathering
resources may have been reduced in size (Zilhão, 2001:
fig. 2). However, a closer observation shows only a
decline in the presence of flint from the “Mousterian
cone” and the assemblage from Levels 8 to 12. As N.
Bicho points out (Bicho, 2004), the trend is positive,
showing a consistent increase in time between Level 11
and Level 8.

The dubious legitimacy of an indicator of this kind
should also be noted: in Gruta Nova da Columbeira there
was also an increase in the use of flint but this was not
related to any true need for supplies of this superior quality
raw material, since there was no increase in the number
of tools manufactured from it, unlike the numbers for
those made from quartz or quartzite (Cardoso, Raposo &amp;amp;
Ferreira, 2002: fig. 18).

The scarcity of flint artefacts in the assemblage from
Gruta da Figueira Brava –only 161 nuclei and products
from debitage out of 3,848, or 21 tools out of a total of
358 (Raposo &amp;amp; Cardoso, 2000)– has led J. Zilhão (Zi-
lhão, 2006) to contemplate a restricted territory in which
resources were gathered. However, the low visibility of this
resource should also be emphasised, since it occurs in fine
beds interstratified in the limestone that have only recently
been exposed with the opening up of extensive quarrying
areas, meaning that its scarcity cannot be used as an argu-
ment to support this conclusion.

Whatever the case may be, other variables should also
be taken into consideration, such as exchanges amongst
groups and cultural aspects that may have led to a prefe-
rence for a particular type of rock, obviously without
excluding the mobility factor itself and, together with this,
the size of the corresponding territories. These factors,
possibly interacting with each other may, as a whole,
explain the almost exclusive use of quartz during the
Mousterian period, replaced by flint in the Upper Paleo-
lithic occupations in the Gruta do Escoural (Otte, in
Zilhão, 2001).

Given the current state of knowledge, the general con-
clusion that may be advanced is that during the Mouste-
rian period the territories must have, in fact, been rela-
tively restricted.

In the Algarve, the sites discovered so far are located
no more than 10 km away from the present coastline
(Bicho, 2004), meaning that most of the inland Algarve
area would have been covered at the time by dense maquis
and forests, making travelling and hunting in that area
difficult. The exceptions would have been the water cour-
ses which, as in the case of Estremadura, would have been

a good means of penetrating and travelling into the area,
favouring hunting and, therefore, open-air establishments
of groups of people, a situation that is particularly well-
evidenced by finds recovered in the Tejo valley and its
tributaries or sub-tributaries, such as the River Nabão in
the Tomar area or the River Almansor in the Benavente-
Santo Estevão area.

After a warm period, corresponding to the formation
of the deposits of Furninha cave, ca. 80 Ka calBP, with
the stripped hyena, the is no relevant paleoclimatic infor-
mation until ca. 45 Ka calBP. The Estremadura coast
would have been at that time mainly covered by pine and
Ericaceae, followed by Quercus, Corylus, Myrtus, Ilex and
Myrica, indicating an open, windy landscape and a tem-
perate-cool humid climate (Diniz, 1993). The same con-
clusion is valid to the Alentejo coast (Diniz, 1986;
Schroeder-Lanz, 1971). However, it should be emphazise
the presence in both sites of Myrica, a genus with ther-
mophilic characteristics.

After this cool period, also suggested by the mountain
goat in the lower levels of Gruta da Oliveira, older than
43 Ka calBP, the climate would generally have been
Mediterranean ca. 39/40 calBP up to 38-37 Ka calBP as
shown by the presence of rodents of mediterranean char-
acteristics in Level 8 of Gruta da Oliveira (38-37 Ka
calBP) and of Cepaea nemoralis, a land snail, recovered in
large amounts from the Lapa dos Furos (Tomar), dated
around 40 Ka calBP (Callapez, 1999). Meanwhile, as
expected, the mountain goat disappeared from Gruta da
Oliveira.

These conditions were slightly modified up to 34-31
Ka calBP, coinciding with the end of the Mousterian, con-
sidering the dates from Gruta Nova da Columbeira. In
fact, although the presence of the turtle in most of the
important caves that have been studied (Gruta Nova da
Columbeira, Gruta da Oliveira, Gruta de Ibn Amar and
Gruta da Figueira Brava) is an indicator of a warm tem-
perate climate, the mountain goat reappearing afterwards
(Gruta da Figueira Brava, Gruta Nova da Columbeira)
corresponds to a cooler climate. The microfauna in Level
K of the Gruta do Caldeirão (Póvoas et al., 1993), with
Allocricetus bursae, discovered in Portugal for the first time,
demonstrates the extension of eurasiatic steppes in the
Iberian peninsula ca. 35 Ka calBP. In conclusion, we can
admit that until 36 Ka calBP there was a progressive cli-
matic cooling that became more severe during the estab-
lishment of the first industries of the Upper Paleolithic c.
34 Ka calBP.

The fact that the first biologically modern human
populations did not occupy the centre, south and west of
the Iberian Peninsula until around 34 Ka calBP must
have been due to the combined effects of two factors: the
possible difficulty of adapting to the respective natural
environments and, above all, the fact that these environ-
ments were occupied by populations that were biologi-
cally progressive (not in the sense that they were approa-
ching the status of sapiens sapiens, but in the strictly
biological sense and within a Neanderthal frame of refe-
rence), although possibly technologically and culturally
less developed. In this context, it would be expected that
the size of the respective territories would have played a
decisive role: the smaller and geographically more accessi-
ble territories would have generated all the phenomena of

acculturation and/or a rapid decrease in population and
the extinction of the less well-equipped population. The
less geographically accessible territories would have led 
to the preservation of cultural traits and a longer survival of
the older populations who could make use of sufficiently
large areas for reproduction. This would have been the
case in the east (Greece and Italy) and the west (Portugal
and Mediterranean Spain) respectively. Their faunal asso-
ciations, especially in the Iberian case, which document
the survival of ancient mega-fauna remains until very
recent times (note, for example, the occurrence of Palaeo-
loxodon antiquus close to 33,6 Ka calBP at the Foz do
Enxarrique site, afterwards replaced by a common fauna,
of a modern type), are proof of these particularities, with
the Neanderthal population constituting only one ele-
ment in the broader geographical and natural frame-
work. Moreover, the role played by the present-day Por-
tuguese territory as an area of refuge originates in much
earlier times: in this context it is important to remem-
ber the presence of large numbers of Hyaena hyaena
prisca (the antecedent of the present-day African striped
hyena), as well as the ancient subspecies of small wolf
(Canis lupus lunellensis) in the Furninha cave (Peniche)
at the start of the last Ice Age (around 80 Ka BP), whilst
in the area of Europe beyond the Pyrenees records only
exist up to the Mindel-Riss interglacial period, as they
were unable to survive the rigours of the Rissian cold
that began around 250 Ka BP.

The past decade and beginning of this one con-
tributed with theoretical models to explain the late sur-
vival of the last Neanderthals in the south and southwest
of the Peninsula. This situation may at least be partly
explained by ecological reasons and the behavioural pre-
ferences of the two human groups, which has been called
the “Ebro frontier”, an imaginary geographical line that
would act as a stable barrier between the region to the
north and the rest of the Peninsular territory inhabited
by the last Iberian Neanderthals (Zilhão &amp;amp; Trinkaus,
2002: 567).

However, this demographic model based on a lasting
and stable separation between two populations has also
been questioned recently (Jöris, Álvarez Fernández &amp;amp;
Weninger, 2003). The authors verify that (1) there is a
clear discrepancy between the radiocarbon dates obtained
for bones and charcoal, with the latter being several thou-
sands of years more modern; 2) as a consequence, they
conclude that there is no proof of the duration of Middle
Paleolithic industries in the southwest of the Iberian
Peninsula during the oldest phases of the Aurignacian, a
conclusion which contradicts the “Ebro frontier” model
which, as previously stated, distinguished between the
Late Mousterian industries of the southwest and those of
the Early Aurignacian in the north east; 3) in fact, the
available dates imply a model of population dynamics
which shrank during the most intensely arid and cold
phases and expanded during the warmer interstadial pha-
ses, giving rise to the idea of regional development during
the Aurignacian in south-east Europe based on Late
Mousterian industries produced by Neanderthals. These
transitional industries are, however, completely absent
from Portuguese territory, in which the Aurignacian is at
present known only in its developed state and whose
absolute chronology is still very imprecise. In common with

the previous model, the geographical interpenetration
of the territories occupied by the two human groups
depended on climatic causes.

This new vision of the transition from the Middle/
Upper Paleolithic in the Iberian Peninsula, has already
been the object of an initial and full discussion (Zilhão,
2006).

Other contributions will certainly be added in the
near future, as a result of the research that this subject has
stimulated in recent years and on the basis of new infor-
mation obtained from excavations currently taking place,
new results will be produced so that the present limita-
tions referred in this summary will be overcome.

Final note. With this work already in press, there
was an oral communication addressing two new Middle
Palaeolithic sites having stratigraphic interest on the left
bank of the middle Tagus river valley, azinhal and Pego
do Tejo II (Nisa county), almost in front of Vilas Ruivas
site. The first site had an association of micoquian
bifaces with denticulates and was dated by OSL from 61
+/-7 Ka. The second site presented an association of
mousterian cores with denticulates, and was dated from
135 +/-21 Ka, also by OSL. We thank the author, Nel-
son Almeida, the possibility to refer these results before
their publication.
