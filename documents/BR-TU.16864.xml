Elementos terras raras (ETR) fazem parte de um grupo peculiar de elementos químicos e sua 
determinação em amostras geológicas é importante e complexa, devido às baixas concentrações 
e problemas com interferências espectrais e não espectrais. Neste trabalho, planejamentos 
experimentais foram utilizados para otimizar as condições operacionais de um espectrômetro 
de emissão óptica com plasma indutivamente acoplado (ICP OES) para a determinação de ETR. 
A razão entre o sinal analítico dos ETR e o sinal de fundo (SBR) e a razão Mg II/Mg I foram 
avaliadas como respostas na otimização. De acordo com os resultados obtidos, três diferentes 
condições de operação foram selecionadas e classificadas como robusta, semi-robusta e melhor 
SBR. Limites de detecção (LOD), SBR e desvio padrão relativo de medidas de uma solução do 
branco (DPRbranco) foram determinados. Na condição semi-robusta (potência de 1250 W e vazão 
do gás nebulizador de 0,90 L min?1) foram obtidos LOD e DPRbranco mais baixos que nas outras 
condições estabelecidas.

Rare earth elements (REEs) is a peculiar group of chemical elements. Their determination 
in geological samples is important and complex due to their low concentrations and problems 
with spectral and non-spectral interferences. Herein, the operating conditions of an inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer were optimized for the determination of REEs 
using experimental designs. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of the REEs emission signals 
and the Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio were evaluated as response functions. According to the 
results obtained, three different sets of operating conditions were selected and classified as robust, 
semi-robust and best SBR conditions. Limits of detection (LOD), SBR and relative standard 
deviation of the blank solution (RSDblank) were determined. The semi-robust condition (RF power 
of 1250 W and nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.90 L min?1) exhibited lower LOD and RSDblank than 
others tested operating conditions.

Keywords: rare earth elements, ICP OES, optimization, SBR, Mg II/Mg I

Introduction

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometry (ICP OES) has been widely used for multi-
element analysis and is recognized as one of the most 
effective techniques for determination of major, minor and 
trace elements including the rare earth elements (REEs) 
in geological samples with complex matrices.1-4 Recently, 

inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) 
has shown to be a powerful tool for the direct determination 
of REEs, but it is still too expensive and unavailable for 
many laboratories. On the other hand, ICP OES is more 
affordable and shows good analytical qualities, such as 
precision and accuracy, relatively low limits of detection, 
high sample throughput, simultaneous determination of 
most elements and wide dynamic range.5-7

From a geological point of view, the determination of 
REEs is vital to understand the geochemical processes in 



Evaluation of Signal-to-Background and Mg II/Mg I Ratios J. Braz. Chem. Soc.754

which rocks have been formed and to provide information 
about the environment.8-10 Several instrumental techniques 
are currently employed for REEs determination such as 
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), isotopic 
dilution mass-spectrometry (ID-MS), atomic absorption 
spectrometry (AAS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) 
and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 
(ICP-MS). Frequently the determination of almost all 
REEs is carried out by a combination of methods, including 
chemical separation.11,12

Geological materials present some analytical challenges 
related to complex matrix composition and low REEs 
concentrations in most samples. The main constituents in a 
geological sample (rocks, soils and sediments) are Si, Al, Fe, 
Ti, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na and K. These elements can contribute 
to high levels of chemical or spectral interferences 
and spurious background emissions due to the matrix 
complexity. Aluminum, Ca, Fe and to a lesser extesion Ti 
can cause significant background in many regions of the 
spectrum or give rise to serious line overlap interferences 
in the determination of trace elements.13 Easily ionized 
elements (EIEs), such as alkalis, Na and K, with their low 
first ionization potential can cause a shift in the spatial 
distribution of analyte-ionization equilibrium.14-16 Calcium, 
Ti and Mn are elements with a low second ionization 
potential that can cause severe matrix effects.17,18 These 
effects on the REEs emission signal will be discussed in a 
future work. In order to overcome some of these restrictions,  
sample pretreatment procedures have been extensively 
employed to separate and preconcentrate analytes prior 
to analysis.19 The optimization of the operating conditions 
is also an important step in the analytical sequence to 
guarantee the best analytical performance. The goal of any 
analytical procedure is to achieve a measurement with high 
level of sensitivity, great accuracy and precision, and the 
lowest limit of detection. Furthermore, the measurement 
technique should be robust.20

Good sensitivity is required for the determination of 
REEs in geological samples because these trace elements 
are found in complex matrices. Also, robustness is an 
important factor in the optimization of the ICP since the 
plasma must be able to deal with a matrix change without 
affecting plasma conditions, such as temperature and 
electron number density. Plasma conditions are easily 
evaluated using Mg II (280 nm) and Mg I (285 nm) line 
intensity ratio,21,22 a parameter that has gained almost 
universal popularity in the ICP OES community.23 The 
signal-to-background ratio (SBR) is another parameter 
commonly applied since it can be correlated to limits of 
detection.24 Choosing one parameter instead of another 

could lead to the use of a different set of operating 
conditions.

ICP has a wide variety of possible optimization 
parameters, including the operating conditions and 
instrumental variations related to types of torches and 
sample introduction system. Some factors have an 
expressive influence on the plasma excitation conditions, 
such as radio frequency (RF) incident power, nebulizer 
gas flow rate, auxiliary gas flow rate, plasma gas flow rate, 
sample uptake rate and observation height.13,24 In ICP OES, 
when radial view is used, at least three parameters must be 
taken into account: incident applied power, nebulizer gas 
flow rate and observation height.

Most of the studies about the determination of REEs 
deals with the optimization of the separation and pre-
concentration step, but ICP OES operating conditions are 
not optimized. These operating condition are only cited, 
sometimes based on previous works, such as the paper of 
Walsh et al..25 This is quite common in geochemical studies 
since the main purpose is the interpretation of the REEs 
pattern in environmental samples and not the development 
and the optimization of methodology. The optimization 
of ICP OES operating conditions for the determination 
of REEs has received little attention and there are not 
many works in the literature about the behavior of these 
elements in different conditions. Conversely, major and 
trace elements, specially toxic elements like As, Cd, Cr, 
Hg, and Pb are extensively discussed in the literature.26-30

In this work, the operating conditions of ICP OES 
were optimized aiming for reaching the best conditions 
for REEs determination (La, Nd, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er and 
Yb) based on robustness and sensitivity. Two different 
parameters were evaluated and compared as responses to 
obtain the optimum conditions: Mg II/Mg I line intensity 
ratio and SBR values of the REEs. Doehlert design was 
applied for the optimization of radio frequency applied 
power, nebulizer gas flow rate, sample uptake rate and 
observation height.

Experimental

Instrumentation

All measurements were performed with a simultaneous 
ICP OES spectrometer Spectro (Germany), model Ciros 
CCD with radial view. A Scott type double-pass spray 
chamber and a cross-flow nebulizer were used throughout 
the experiments. The detailed description of the equipment 
and operational parameters are presented in Table 1. The 
wavelengths selected and the ionization and excitation 
energies are reported in Table 2. 



Guimarães-Silva et al. 755Vol. 23, No. 4, 2012

The selection includes 7 elements and 4 or 5 ionic lines 
for each element, and the sum of ionization and excitation 
energies of the lines ranging from 8.40 to 13.41 eV. 
Analytical lines were selected based on sensitivity and 
minimum spectral interference. Spectral line interferences 
due to Si, Al, Ti, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na and K were evaluated 
by scanning the spectra of the analytes and the interfering 
elements using the profile mode of the analysis program. An 
improper analytical line selection may result in significant 
loss of detection power or accuracy for samples containing 
complex matrices. Therefore, the appropriate choice of 
analytical line is crucial to avoid interferences and ensure 
the quality of analysis.31

Reagents, samples and test solutions

High-purity water was supplied from a Millipore 
Milli-Q ion-exchange system (Millipore, Billerica, 
MA, USA). The concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and 
hydrofluoric acids employed were of analytical-reagent 
grade (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Laboratory glassware 
was kept overnight in a 10% (v/v) nitric acid solution and 
before use the glassware was rinsed with ultrapure water. 
Reference solutions were prepared from 1 g L?1 certified 
standard solutions (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) 
for REEs (La, Nd, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er and Yb) and for major 
common constituents in geological matrices (Al, Fe, Mn, 
Ti, Na, K, Ca and Mg).

The emission signals were evaluated in solutions with 
and without the matrix medium. The concentrations of the 
concomitants in test solutions were prepared according to 
typical mean concentrations presented in relevant geological 

samples routinely analyzed in the laboratory. Final solutions 
were acidified with 5% (v/v) HNO3. Digests from geological 
samples was mixed to use in some spectra measurements, 
considering the effect of the matrix medium in the emission 
signal of REEs. Two certified reference materials (CRMs) 
were used to evaluate the accuracy in the proposed operating 
conditions: AC-E (granite) from Centre de Recherches 
Pétrographiques et Géochimiques - CNRS (Vandoeuvre-lès-
Nancy, France) and GBW 07309 (stream sediment) from the 
National Research Centre (Hepingjie, China).

Sample preparation

The sample preparation procedure for geological 
samples was previously described by Moutte.33 A 250 mg 
portion of sample was directly and accurately weighted into

decomposition was carried out in hot plate device and was 
developed with successive additions of HCl (10 mol L?1), 
HNO3 (10 mol L

?1) and concentrated HF. Then, the residue 
was dissolved to 25 mL using 2 mol L?1 HCl solution.

Optimization procedure

Doehlert experimental design was used to optimize the 
operating parameters. The RF applied power, nebulizer gas 
flow rate, sample uptake rate and observation height were 
selected as independent variables. The Mg II/Mg I line 
intensity ratio and SBR values for REEs were considered as 
responses. The SBR value is given by SBR = (total signal  – 
background)/background.The background was measured 
from a separate measurement of the blank (i.e., on-peak 
background). Table 3 shows the design proposed and the 
respective parameters values. According to this design, each 
variable was studied at least in three levels. The central point 

was made in five replicates, adding up to 25 experiments. 
The maximum and minimum levels of each factor were 
established taking into account the default operating 
conditions and data of previous univariate experiments.

define mathematical models, but to verify the influence 
of the operational variables on the emission signals. All 
measurements were carried out using a test solution with 
1 mg L?1 of each REEs and 5 mg L?1 Mg. In order to check 
matrix effects on robustness and sensitivity, a multi-

Ca 400 mg L?1 and Mg 400 mg L?1, was employed using the 
same design to simulate the matrix medium. Magnesium is a 
test element for the evaluation of robustness, consequently, 
in the matrix medium, the Mg concentration in the solution 
was only 5 mg L?1.

Results and Discussion

Robustness - Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio

The Doehlert design was used to evaluate robustness. 
The use of multivariate techniques for the optimization of 
operational conditions in spectroscopic methods has been 
thoroughly exploited by analytical chemists, as evidenced 
by the multiple advantages that can be found using these 
tools.34,35 The operating parameters were considered as 
factors: RF incident applied power, nebulizer gas flow rate, 
sample uptake rate and observation height. The response 
surface in Figure1a illustrates the influence of main factors 
on the response (Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio) when a 
solution containing only Mg and REEs was analyzed. The 
nebulizer gas flow rate and RF applied power were found 
to be the most significant factors. A robust condition was 
obtained at high RF power and low nebulizer gas flow 
rate, as expected and described in the literature.36-38A 
response surface maximum point was not obtained; an 
ever-increasing pattern was observed until the instrumental 
limits. The thresholds between robust and non-robust 
conditions were established.

Also, the robustness was tested in a simulated multi-
element solution with the common constituents of a 
geological matrix in the respective concentrations (in 
mg L?1): Al 800, Fe 600, Ti 80, Mn 25, Na 200, K 200, 
and Ca 400. These concentrations are commonly observed 
in samples analyzed in routine studies of the laboratory. 
Magnesium was the test element and was considered at 
the concentration of 5 mg L?1. It was possible to observe a 
decrease in the value of Mg II/Mg I, but the general trend 
is the same determined to the solution without matrix 
(Figures 1a and 1b).

The main factors had the same influence in the 
robustness, and a maximum point was not obtained. There 
was a mean decrease in Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio of 
about 8%. Therefore, to maintain robust conditions in the 
presence of the matrix medium, higher RF applied power 
and lower nebulizer gas flow rate should be considered. If 
the optimization process was carried out with an aqueous 
solution without matrix medium, then the Mg II/Mg I 
intensity ratio above 9 should be needed to guarantee robust 
conditions in matrix medium. Both designs demonstrated 
that above 90% of the variance can be explained by the 
proposed model in the evaluation of robustness.

Mermet and co-workers22,39 defined robustness as the 
capability of the ICP system to accept a change in the 
concentration of major elements, acids, and other elements, 
without any significant variation in the line intensity of the 
analytes. This concept has become quite common in ICP 

optimization studies and can be easily measured using 
ionic-to-atomic line intensity ratio as Mg II (280 nm) and 
Mg I (285 nm).27,36,40-42 Since ionic lines are more sensitive 
to changes in atomization and excitation conditions than 
atomic lines, the intensity ratio of the lines is a practical 
criterion to evaluate the plasma robustness and analytical 
performance. A robust condition can be achieved when 
higher RF applied power level (? 1200 W) is combined 
with lower nebulizer gas flow rate (? 0.6 L min-1)37,38,43,44 
and this condition is characterized by the high intensity 
ratio of Mg II/Mg I, values above 8.22

Sensitivity -signal-to-background ratio (SBR)

Because of the spectral complexity, low sensitivity 
and interference combined with the low abundance of 
REEs, a set of operating condition should be considered 

Figure 1. Effect of RF applied power and nebulizer gas flow rate on  
Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio (a) without and (b) with the matrix solution.

to improve the signal-to-background ratio during the 
determination of REEs in geological samples. The 
Doehlert design demonstrated that the main factors 
which are able to influence the SBR value of the REEs 
were RF applied power and nebulizer gas flow rate as 
well as for robustness. However, in this case, the RF 
incident power was more significant than the nebulizer 
gas flow rate. The RF applied power is directly linked to 
the amount of energy transferred to the species and has a 
direct influence on net signal intensities and SBR value.45 

Unlike what was observed for robustness, both parameters 
demonstrated negative estimated effects leading to a set 
of operating conditions with lower RF applied power 
and intermediate nebulizer gas flow rate to obtain higher  
SBR values.

Response surfaces were obtained for each element by 
plotting the SBR of each element against the RF applied 
power and nebulizer gas flow rate. The results were 
obtained for solutions containing REEs in presence and 
absence of matrix. It was possible to observe the uniform 
behavior of SBR values in relation to the variation of 
the operating conditions. All analytical lines considered 
for REEs exhibited a similar distribution profile and 
the matrix tested did not significantly affect the value 
of SBR. Therefore a La line (408.672 nm) was chosen 
to exemplify the response surface obtained without and 
with matrix medium (Figures 2a and 2b, respectively). A 
maximum point was found at the operating conditions: RF 
applied power of 1100 W and nebulizer gas flow rate of 
0.9 L min?1. Walsh et al.25 also reported the application of a 
condition with lower-power to improve the SBR, which is 
a different condition commonly adopted to analyze major 
and trace elements in geological samples. Some papers 
published later cited this work as a reference condition 
to REEs.46 Others only cited the operating conditions 
adopted; in most cases, with RF applied power between 
1000-1200 W.2,47 Recently, Bentlin and Pozebon48 reported 
the optimization related to the sample introduction system 
applying pneumatic and ultrasonic nebulization for the 
determination of REEs. In this work, the RF applied 
power and nebulizer gas flow rate were optimized only 
based on the Mg II/Mg I. Thus, a condition with higher 
RF applied power was applied considering values between 
1300 and 1400 W, and nebulizer gas flow rate was  
0.75 L min?1.

In ICP OES, the experimental spectral intensity is a 
gross signal (S+B), which consists of the sum of the line 
intensity, S, plus the background, B. The background 
corresponds to the emission originating from the blank 
solution. Then the net signal is obtained by subtracting 
the value of the background, B. The simplest net signal 

measurement consists of a direct measurement of the gross 
line intensity (S+Bpeak) at the central wavelength of the 
analyte line.49 The signal will be processed unambiguously 
if the analytical signal is stand out from the background, 
which requires a meaning SBR value. The SBR is a 
traditional response used in optimization approach and it 
is also a figure of merit that can be correlated with limit 
of detection.24

It is important to consider the behavior of the 
background signal during the evaluation of SBR. There was 
an increase in analytical signals of REEs when increasing 
RF applied power, increasing nebulizer gas flow rate and 
at higher observation height. However, the background 
signal also had a sharp rise which led to a decrease in SBR 
values of the REEs (Figure 3a). Since an increase in power 
increases the background signals more than the analyte 
emission signals with subsequent decrease in SBR, it is 
assumed that a lower applied power seems to be the best 
choice for analyzing REEs by ICP OES.

Instrumental operating conditions - robustness and 
sensitivity

When the operating conditions are established considering 
the sensitivity of the system based on SBR values, conditions 
with lower RF applied power settings would be applied and 
the robustness would be affected. In order to avoid this type 
of mistake, robustness and SBR ratio can be considered 
together during the optimization processes. In this case, 
robustness was defined by line intensity ratio of Mg; on the 
other hand, SBR values were directly related to analytes. 
The Mg II/Mg I ratio and SBR values led to different 
sets of operating conditions because the emission lines 
considered in each response reacted differently to changes 
on excitation conditions. Evaluating the operating condition 
based on Mg II/Mg I the nebulizer gas flow rate was a more 
important parameter than the RF applied power. Conversely, 
considering the optimization with the SBR values of REEs 
the RF applied power was more significant and critical 
influence in the background was observed.

The main difference was related to changes in the RF 
applied power as can be seen in the behavior of the ionic 
lines of Mg and La in Figures 3a and 3b. Comparing REEs 
(e.g. La II 408 nm) with magnesium (Mg II 280 nm), an 
increase in RF applied power was followed by decreasing 
in SBR values of REEs and an increase in SBR value 
of Mg. All REEs ionic lines studied revealed the same 
pattern. The behavior of analytical signal and SBR value 
can be affected by different factors as range of wavelength, 
ionization state, excitation energy for atomic lines and 
energy sum for ionic lines. In addition, the background 
emission signal had an important effect on the SBR.24,45 
For some lines, the contribution of the background was 
higher than for others, probably because of the very low 
sensitivity of some lines. Non-robust conditions should be 
avoided for analytical applications dealing with complex 
matrices to guarantee precision and accuracy. But it cannot 
be the only one criterion in method development, mainly 
because it does not consider the behavior of the background 
emission signal that can be crucial in complex matrices.

The results obtained allowed the selection of three 
different sets of operating conditions (Table 4), classified 

on their robustness and the best SBR obtained. The routine 
operating condition is robust and is applied to determination 
of major and trace elements in environmental samples with 
good results. The best SBR condition was obtained when 
a lower RF applied power of 1100 W was applied. An 
intermediate condition between these two sets of operating 
conditions was suggested to consider robustness and 
sensitivity simultaneously. When a RF power of 1250 W 
was applied it is possible to obtain a semi-robust condition 
and intermediate values for SBR. 

In ICP OES a measurement is based on the emission 
line intensity and this signal is composed of the net 
signal and the background signal. These signals exhibit 
different behaviors in face of changes in excitation and

atomization conditions and it should be considered during 
the optimization step. The behavior of the analytical 
signals (gross signal and background) for the REEs using 
the different sets of operating conditions were analyzed 
applying the emission line of La II 408.672 nm (Figure 4). 

The samples analyzed consisted of a reference solution 
containing 1 mg L?1 of each REE, a blank solution and 
a mixture of digests from geological samples spiked 
with 1 mg L?1 of each REE. The pattern found for La II 
(408.672 nm) was also observed in others REEs emission 
lines. Considering the variation in the signal by reducing 
the RF applied power (1350 -1100 W), it was also observed 
that the background signal suffers more influence when 
decreasing RF applied power. The analytical signal 
undergoes more change in Set 1 (1100 W), in fact it is a 
non-robust condition. Analyzing the matrix spectra (digest 
from geological samples spiked with REEs) the effect of 
decreasing the RF power was even more critical and the 
matrix effects were more significant. 

Set 3 was considered a robust condition with lower 
SBR values and a considerable higher background 
signal (ca. 8000 cps, Figure 4 - Set 3). The results of the 
intermediate condition (Set 2) were clear in the spectrum; 
they displayed good sensitivity, low background emission 
and equivalent signals for reference and matrix solutions.

Table 5 shows the behavior of the 3 sets of operating 
conditions based on the values of limit of detection (LOD), 
SBR, relative standard deviation for 10 measurements of 
the blank solution (RSDblank), and recoveries (%) of REEs 
in reference solution (RS) and two certified reference 
materials,which were measured for the prominent lines 
considered in this work. The LOD was calculated using 
the background equivalent concentration (BEC) approach 
described by Thomsen et al.50 The lowest background 
intensity was obtained in Set 1 (Figure 4), being ca. 10-fold 
and 4-fold lower than Sets 3 and 2, respectively, and hence 
better SBR values. However, this condition shows a higher 
RSDblank and lower Mg II/Mg I ratio - non-robust condition 
(Table 4), thus this condition was not used. The robust 
condition (1350 W) shows the highest LOD, the RSDblank is 
higher than the Set 2 and the SBR value drops by half. The 
limiting factor in Set 3 - robust condition - is the highest 
LOD that could difficult the analysis of some REEs due to 
their low relative abundances. Besides that the quantitative 
results obtained for two certified reference materials does 
not show significant improvements in recoveries when 
comparing Set 2 and Set 3. Some interferences problems 
were not overcome regardless of the robust or better 
SBR condition, for example Gd and Er. Consequently, 
alternative approaches need to be investigated (standard 
additions method, internal standardization, mathematical 

corrections, etc.). So a detailed study of interferences in 
terms of major constituents of geological samples is ongoing 
and results will be presented later. Thus considering LOD, 
background signal and the need for interference correction 
regardless of the condition (robust or better SBR), it was 
clear that an intermediate condition between the robustness 
(Mg II/Mg I) and sensitivity (SBR) would be a good choice

for analysis affording good LOD and SBR values, a low 
RSDblank value and suitable recoveries.

Conclusions

This study focused on the optimization of the 
ICP OES aiming for better emission signals of REEs. The 
optimization process was based on two different responses: 
Mg II/Mg I line intensity ratio and SBR values, considering 
robustness and sensitivity. Robustness is a quite common 
response function in ICP OES optimization studies. 
Using different response functions for the optimization 
process of the operating conditions, such as robustness and 
sensitivity, the optimum conditions are not necessarily the 
same. An analytical judgment may be necessary to select 
the best operating conditions for complex samples. In the 
case of the REEs, it is very important to recognize their 
behavior in different conditions. Three different sets of 
operating conditions can be identified at first as: robust, 
semi-robust and best SBR. The RF applied power is the 
most critical parameter and lower applied power improved 
the sensitivity as it leads to lower background signals that 
can be crucial in trace analysis of complex matrices. A 
preliminary evaluation based on LOD, SBR and RSDblank 
indicates that the semi-robust condition is more suitable 
for the determination of REEs by ICP OES.
