Resumo 
 

O lagostim (Nephrops norvegicus) é um crustáceo bentónico de águas profundas, com uma 

distribuição ampla que se estende desde a Islândia, as Ilhas Faroé e o noroeste da Noruega 

até a costa atlântica sul de Marrocos e ainda uma distribuição em bolsas dispersas no Mar 

Mediterrâneo. Os indivíduos adultos de Nephrops norvegicus podem ser encontrados nas 

zonas de plataforma continental e no talude entre os 90m e os 800m de profundidade em 

águas portuguesas. A distribuição nesta espécie pode ir desde fundos de vasa compacta ate 

fundos de vasa arenosa. 

Ao longo dos anos esta espécie adquiriu alguma importância no sector das pescas devido ao 

seu crescente valor no mercado e é hoje em dia uma das principais espécies no arrasto de 

fundo de crustáceos na Europa. A atividade pesqueira resultante da exploração desta espécie 

tem demonstrado impactos ambientais negativos, com especial foco nos efeitos das redes de 

arrasto. Recentemente a pesca de Lagostim tem sido alvo de atenção por parte da 

Comunidade Europeia, com incentivos para a mudança de arte de captura da rede de arrasto 

para armadilhas, numa tentativa de redução das capturas acessórias. 

Durante este estudo foi possível verificar que existem diferenças bastante demarcadas entre 

os dois tipos de artes utilizadas. Estas diferenças verificam-se nomeadamente a nível do valor 

comercial do lagostim e nas espécies afetadas por cada uma das artes. 

 

Palavras-chave: Nephrops norvegicus, capturas acessórias, arrasto, armadilhas, gestão de 

recursos marinhos.

Abstract  
 

The Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) is a deep- water burrowing decapod crustacean 

with a widespread distribution ranging from Iceland, the Faroe Island and northwestern 

Norway to the south Atlantic coast of Morocco with a patchy distribution on the 

Mediterranean Sea. In the Portuguese shelf and slope areas, adults are found on depths 

ranging from 90 to 800 m depth. The distribution of this species seems to be limited to high 

percentage of mud bottoms. 

Along the years this species acquired some importance in the fisheries sector due to its market 

value. It is nowadays one of the main species in crustaceans’ bottom trawling in Europe. The 

fishing activity for the exploitation of this species has shown some environmental impacts. 

In particular, trawl fisheries are known to directly impact the bottoms, and are associated 

with considerable amounts of bycatch and discards. Recently, the European community has 

turned the attention to creel fishery for Nephrops, encouraging the change from trawl to creel 

in this fishery in order to reduce the bycatch.  

During this study it was possible to observe that there is a clear difference between both gears 

in what respects the commercial value of Nephrops caught as well as in terms of species 

affected by the gears. 

 

Key words: Nephrops norvegicus, bycatch, trawl, creel, marine resources management

1. Introduction 

1.1. General concepts 

 

Fisheries change the demographics of wild populations and the structure of ecosystems. 

These changes are dependent on the type of fishery, gear and affected area. Evidences to 

support these changes on the ecosystems are well documented and still undergoing study. 

One of the main issues is bycatch (Bell et al., 2008; Bellido et al., 2011; Catchpole et al., 

2006; Catchpole et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2009; Daw and Gray, 2005; Johnsen et al., 2011; 

Kelleher et al., 2005; Pita et al., 2010; Wilcox et al., 2009). Bycatch is present in all types of 

gears, global marine fisheries data showing that bycatch represents around 40% of the total 

marine catches worldwide (Davies et al., 2009). Part of the bycatch is composed by species 

with commercial value, comprising up to 76% of the landed catch (Bojorquez, 1998), 

depending on the type of fishery and gear used (métier). 

To fully understand the importance of the biomass waste produced in fisheries there is a need 

to have a definition of catch and bycatch. Bycatch is a term extensively used in many studies 

nowadays with different meanings. There are three accepted definitions of bycatch. One of 

the definitions currently accepted by the Fishery and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations (FAO) describes bycatch as “that proportion of the total organic material of animal 

origin in the catch, which is thrown away or dumped at sea, for whatever reason” (FAO 

Fisheries Report No. 547 FAO, 1996). This definition does not include plant material and 

post-harvest waste such as offal (Alverson et al., 1994). Another definition refers to bycatch 

as the group of species discarded (Hall et al., 2000) and a third definition (OECD 2001) 

includes in bycatch all the non-target fish retained and discarded. According to the 

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) bycatch is “total fishing 

mortality excluding that accounted directly by the retained catch of target species”. This 

definition also includes fish that die as a result of interaction with the fishing gear, including 

mortality caused by “ghost fishing” (OECD 2001). 

A more general definition of bycatch is currently used, and was adopted through this 

document, defining bycatch as the part of the catch that is constituted by the non-target-

species. Taking these definitions into account, the quantity of biomass taken by the fishing

gear may comprise the landed catch, including the target, accidental catches and non-target 

species that are marketable, and the discards, the catch fraction thrown back to the sea 

(Alverson et al., 1994). The species included in each group may change category depending 

on a number of variables.  

Bycatch can then be sold or discarded, depending on the circumstances. Discards are a main 

issue, and there is a high number of reasons for discarding. Most common reasons include 

regulatory measures (species protected, stock status, fishing quota attained, undersized 

individuals), and low market value (species with no value, damaged fish due to abrasion in 

the gear or handling onboard). Other factors, as the lack of space on board or vessel freezing 

capacity, among others, are also reasons for discarding. In such cases, only the most valuable 

species are retained, in a practice commonly known as high grading (Bellido et al., 2011; 

Catchpole et al., 2006; Catchpole et al., 2010; Davies et al., 2009; Daw and Gray 2005; 

Johnsen et al., 2011). Discarded species may include protected or stock managed species and 

the lack of records on these catches may lead to failure on management policies (Catchpole 

et al., 2006; Davies et al., 2009; Daw et al., 2005; Johnsen et al., 2011).  

A major issue related to the amount of by-catch and discards is gear selectivity. In the past, 

gear modifications were put in place to increase catch efficiency, but at present there is a 

concern to increase gear selectivity in order to avoid non-desirable, non-commercial and 

protected species (Aldrin et al., 2012; Bellido et al., 2011; Costa et al., 2008; Johnsen et al., 

2011; Kronbak, 2009). This change in paradigm is related to the evolution of management 

policies, from single-species to ecosystem-based management (Bellido et al., 2011; Hall et 

al., 2000; Johnsen et al., 2011; Simberloff, 1998). Although there are no conclusive studies 

about the ecosystem effects of a very selective fishing, the side effects of the exploitation of 

one species or a restricted group of species are considered preferred to the non-selective 

approach, due to the inexistence of market for the majority of bycatch species (Hall et al., 

2000). Another issue is market demand; while from an ecological point of view, the 

exploitation of species with lower trophic levels would lead to higher catch rates, market 

demand focus mostly on high trophic level species like tunas, sharks and other top predators 

that do not provide a sustainable fishery with high harvest rates (Hall et al., 2000). 



Introduction

Bycatch can lead to conservation problems, when species caught include iconic species. 

These include mostly marine mammals, sharks, sea birds and some marine reptiles, and 

commercial species that cannot be caught due to regulatory measures (Simberloff, 1998). 

These aforementioned reasons can lead to public concerns on protection of marine life, with 

media circles focused on the unaccounted mortality caused by fisheries activities (Hall et al., 

2000). 

Consequences of by-catch and discards go beyond the effects of mortality. The discarded 

bycatch will affect all the ecosystem by providing feeding opportunities to otherwise 

balanced communities with proper biomass intake and outtake. These disturbances are more 

evident on areas with intense fishing activity, affecting the constitution and demographics of 

the ecosystem, by indirectly benefiting scavenger communities and opportunistic species, 

(Catchpole et al., 2008b). 

Bycatch issues have been ignored in fisheries management to a high extent. Many reasons 

may account for this, as discards correspond to an “invisible” catch fraction. The declared 

catch on the port does not account for discards and hence only the data from landed catch are 

available (Wilcox et al., 2009). This was less significant in the past, but with the increase in 

fishing effort resulting from the development of more efficient and less selective gears, the 

increase in bycatch became a problem for stock assessment mortality estimates, (Daw et al., 

2005). Gear improvement allowed for extending the fishing activity to previously ignored 

areas and the increased pressure on the target species lead to a decline in the abundance of 

these species (Johnsen et al., 2011). The attempt to maintain the catch levels high also 

increased bycatch. However, the main management strategy is still based on single-species 

models, which do not take into account fisheries as a whole (Catchpole et al., 2006). 

Nowadays, one of the main factors for regulatory bycatch measures is the accidental catch of 

iconic groups as sea birds, mammals and sea turtles. The implementation of multispecies 

management policies can imply fishing closures whenever the bycatch of such species 

exceeds pre-determined amounts (Simberloff, 1998).  

Global discards have declined in recent years (Davies et al., 2009), nonetheless there are 

important exceptions. Deep-water fisheries in international waters are among these

exceptions; stock declines and quota restrictions resulted in fishing effort increase and a 

consequent increase in discarded by-catch (Andrew et al., 2007). 

 

1.2. International and European Regulations for fisheries bycatch and discards 

 

One of the most important international regulations affecting fisheries was the Third United 

Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. This convention was held 

with the objective to create a common Law of the Sea for all the States involved, to “promote 

the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of their 

resources, the conservation of their living resources, and the study, protection and 

preservation of the marine environment”(UNCLOS 1982). UNCLOS introduced the concept 

of exclusive economic zone (EEZ), an area over which a state has legal rights over the seabed 

and its resources. The EEZ extends the jurisdiction of coastal states from the previous 12 

nautical miles (territorial waters) to 200 nautical miles beyond the shore line; as a 

consequence, most of the natural exploitable resources fell under the management 

responsibility of a country. It was expected that resources previously in international waters, 

would be better protected and managed. 

Some guidelines for the sustainability of fisheries activities were proposed by FAO, resulting 

in the unanimous approval by the UN Council of the Code of Conduct for Responsible 

Fisheries” (FAO, 1995). Despite being of voluntary compliance, its principles have been 

generically adopted in fisheries strategic plans. 

Along the years, several other conventions were approved to protect marine organisms like 

seabirds, dolphins and whales. Although in force, they were not able to solve the bycatch 

problem, and in 2010 FAO issued the International Guidelines on Bycatch Management and 

reduction of Discards (FAO, 2010). This guideline had the objective to assist in the 

implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

1.3. The Common Fisheries Policy 

 

In Europe, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was created to manage the European Union 

stocks, through the establishment and further enforcement of a number of management 

measures. A central measure is the total allowable catch (TAC) (Johnsen et al., 2011), setting 

up a limit for the total amount of fish which can be landed from a particular species and area. 

Other measures are of a more technical nature such as gear regulations, closed seasons and 

minimum landing sizes for individual species. Another cornerstone of the CFP lies in 

controlling the capacity of the fleets by limiting the number of licenses for some fisheries 

and/or the number at days at sea (Daw et al., 2005). 

The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) produces a research report on a 

yearly basis which is then discussed by the Advisory Committee (ACOM). ACOM is 

responsible for defining the current status and providing scientific advice for the different 

stocks. This report is discussed within the several committees on the EU, among them the 

Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF) and the European 

Parliament Fisheries Committee (Johnsen et al., 2011). These committees are responsible for 

issuing a number of proposals on management issues which are then sent to the EU Council 

of Ministers for analysis and approval.  

This approach to management can be understood as a top-down approach and it is widely 

regarded as having failed to successfully accomplish sustainable fisheries management in 

Europe (Johnsen et al., 2011). The responsibility can be attributed to different parties. 

Technical and structural measures are rarely fully adopted at the policy stage and their 

enforcement is sometimes delayed due to economic or social interests prevailing over 

ecological sustainability (Johnsen et al., 2011). Political devaluation of fisheries science also 

comes into play due to the inherent uncertainty of fisheries models and the resulting advice. 

The over-simplification of the scientific advice leads to disregard by politicians and the 

general public (Johnsen et al., 2011). This whole scenario contributes to an encouragement 

to the scientific community to focus on other questions, reducing the quality and quantity of 

management-related research. Ultimately some blame can also be attributed to the scientific

14 
 

community, since fishers are more likely to be skeptical of scientific advice in which they 

have little or no involvement (Pita et al., 2010).  

Conservation objectives have been clearly incorporated in the CFP since 2002 (EC, 2002). 

After a period of intense exploitation some stocks collapsed and the need for management 

was enforced. Currently there is an increasing effort to create gears that allow, not only an 

efficient catch, but also reduce the bycatch. In the case of Nephrops stocks, the classification 

as “bellow biologically safe limits” has only been declared for the Iberian and Mediterranean 

stocks (ICES 2004). Management measures to recover Nephrops Iberian stock were adopted 

by reduction of the total allowable catch (TAC) (Harley et al., 2001; Abella and Rigini 1998). 

Technical measures related to gear selectivity have been adopted by a number of European 

countries (ICES 2004), but not in Portugal. 

 

1.4. Nephrops norvegicus - fishery 

 

The Norway lobster is a highly valuable resource, with an average price of 13.01€/Kg in 

Portugal (first sale). It is an important source of revenue for the trawl fleet in general, and for 

the crustacean trawl fishery in particular, and therefore its management needs to consider not 

only the biological component but the social and economic dimensions of this fishery as well 

(Ungfors et al., 2013).  

The landings of Nephrops increased from 1950 until the mid of the 1980´s, stabilizing since 

then at an average of 60,000t per year (Ungfors et al., 2013) (Figure 1.1). Coastal waters of 

the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea show a decrease in landings even with 

increase in effort, thus new management practices must be adopted (Abelló et al., 2002). In 

northern countries, like Sweden, new policies were introduced to make this fishery 

sustainable and there is a gradual shift of the effort from trawling gear to creels (Ziegler et 

al., 2008).

The main producer is the United Kingdom responsible for 28.5 thousand tones (56.8% of the 

total world catch) (Figure 1.2) in 2013, followed by Ireland with 8.4 thousand tones (16.8%). 

Denmark and France catch around 3 thousand tones (6.0% and 6.2% respectively) and the 

remaining countries involved in the fishery (with decreasing importance are Italy, Iceland, 

Sweden, Spain, Netherlands, Germany and Portugal.

Nephrops Landings

Data source: FAO landings data. 

Figure 1.2- Total annual landings of Nephrops per country. 

 

Gears used 

The main gear used to catch Nephrops is the bottom otter trawl. Trawling gear has been 

developed along the years with different mesh types, cod ends and designs to increase their 

efficacy in catching the target species (Catchpole et al., 2008a). Trawl selectivity changes 

according to the net section, the fore panels having large meshes so small organisms can 

escape, while the cod-end has a small mesh size to retain the target species. When trawling, 

the longer the haul, the less selective the cod-end will be due to biomass accumulation in this 

trawl section. (Kaykac et al., 2009).  

Management measures for Nephrops include annual total allowable catches (TACs), 

minimum landing size (MLS), closures in space and time, and specifically for trawlers, 

minimum codend mesh sizes (MMS) and maximum engine power. Regulations are not the 

same for all EU countries. In Portuguese waters, MMS in Nephrops trawls is 70 mm (Portaria

1557-A/2002, de 30 de Dezembro) and MLS is 20 mm (CL - carapace length). Both MMS 

and MLS should be based on maturation criteria that is, the MLS and the MMS length of 

50% retention, should be equal or above the 50% maturation size of the female maturation 

ogive. This will mean that most individuals caught will have matured and reproduced at least 

once (Ungfors et al., 2013). However the MLS of 20 mm is well below the L50 maturation 

length of around 30mm, as indicated by Relini et al. (1998) for Algarve waters. It is also 

below the 50% retention in the legal mesh size of 70mm, around 25mm according to Fonseca 

et al. (2007). Despite the very low percentage of individuals with 20 mm CL in a trawl catch 

(Frandsen et al., 2010; Fonseca et al., 2007), there is still an important proportion retained 

with CL between 20 and 30 mm..  

Trawls are among the less selective fishing gears and therefore the management of trawl 

fisheries must take into account all the bycatch, including commercially valuable and 

discarded species. Landings of commercial by-catch are usually recorded and therefore 

management can be achieved for these species (Catchpole et al., 2008a; Doyen et al., 2012). 

During the last decades, new trawl designs were developed in order to decrease trawl bycatch. 

These are commonly known by Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRD) and they contribute to 

exclude trawl by-catch either by sorting out unwanted species (physically or mechanically) 

or promoting escapement based on differences in behavior between crustaceans and fish 

species (Kronbak et al, 2009; Johnsen et al., 2011). Northern countries such as Sweden 

started to use BRDs such as species-selective grids in order to reduce the bycatch. A similar 

device was developed for the Portuguese Nephrops trawl fishery by Fonseca et al. (2005), 

consisting of a grid sorting system, with a grid allowing the passage of Nephrops and rose 

shrimp to the trawl codend, while directing by-catch species to an upper trawl opening 

through which they escape from the trawl. However, these options are still not applied on 

southern European countries like Portugal (Johnsen et al., 2011). 

 

Creels are a passive gear deployed on the sea bottom and then hauled after a period of time. 

Presently, they account for a small portion of Nephrops catch, but before the development of 

industrial trawling fleets most crustacean species, including the Norway lobster, were caught 

in creels. Recently, this gear is being increasingly used due to the efforts to reduce bycatch

(Ziegler et al., 2008). Creels are usually baited, in which case it is called a trap. The trap uses 

a simple catch mechanism: the target species gets into the trap usually by passing through a 

netting funnel (entrance), having its smaller opening turned into the inside of the trap, making 

it easy for the target species to get in but difficult to get out. This gear is highly selective, 

being characterized by very small amounts of bycatch (Ziegler et al., 2008). 

In Portugal, the minimum mesh size for traps is defined according to the percentage of target 

species caught per haul (Portaria nº280/2002 de 15 de Março: 8-24mm, 30-50mm and &gt;50 

mm with a minimum percentage of target species of 90%, 80% and 100% respectively).  

Baited traps have increased efficiency due to the attractiveness of the bait. This is even more 

important on the sea bottom where the food-web is based on scavenging. In crustacean 

creeling, the most common and cheaper fish species are used for bait, such as mackerel 

(Scomber scombrus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) (Ziegler et al., 2008). The fish are 

used whole in a similar condition to that used for human consumption, a situation that raises 

ethical concerns. Previous attempts to use loins or rotten fish failed due to the lack of 

acceptance of the final product by the consumer caused by smell and flavor of the crustacean 

meat that retained the bait smell and flavor. Artificial baits are being developed that can avoid 

the degradation of the final product and solve the problem of the use of fish on baited traps 

(Ziegler et al., 2008). 

Several studies have shown that traps are efficient in economic and environmental terms in 

Sweden (Ziegler et al., 2008), Iceland (Ungfors et al., 2013) and Portugal (Leocádio et al., 

2012). With the recent European policy of no discards (landing obligation), starting in 2015 

with pelagic fisheries and extending to demersal fisheries in 2016, all quota species, as 

defined by catch limits in the TAC and quota Regulation, must be recorded, landed and 

counted for the quota, including any by-catch of pelagic quota species when caught in 

demersal operations (Defra, 2015).Therefore, the use of creels for these fisheries seems more 

and more profitable due to the dramatic reduction on the bycatch and the reduced fuel 

requirements when compared with trawl fisheries (Catchpole et al., 2010; Leocádio et al., 

2012; Ungfors et al., 2013), making traps a sustainable gear from a biological, as well as 

economic, point of view.

1.5. Nephrops norvegicus - biology 

 

Reproductive cycle 

The reproductive cycle in Nephrops changes according to latitude (Sardà, 1998). The 

incubation period can vary from 6 months, in the Mediterranean, to 10 months in Iceland, the 

most northern populations having biennial spawns (Tuck et al., 1997; Tuck et al., 2000). The 

eggs are extruded during summer and the larvae hatch in the end of winter or early spring, 

after which the female populations undergo a process of moulting followed by matting. Egg 

spawning in the Portuguese coast takes place in August and September. The ovigerous period 

lasts about 28 weeks and hatching takes place from January to April (Chapman and Rice, 

1971; Sardà 1998).  

The larval phase includes three zoeal stages with temperature-dependent duration, ranging 

from 15 days (at 17ºC) to 45 days (at 8ºC) (Figueiredo et al., 1983). Nephrops zoeae are 

referred to occur between the ocean surface and 50 meters depth (Figueiredo et al., 1983). 

The larvae describe a diurnal vertical migration (DVM behavior pattern) which will affect 

the dispersal distance (Figueiredo et al., 1983). Environmental factors have a very decisive 

role during the zoeae development. Events such as offshore winds, that promote a stronger 

oceanic drift and abnormal seasonal temperatures, result in shifts from the optimal range 

levels for the development of Nephrops Zoeae, inducing years of poor recruitment that 

afterwards reflect on lower adult biomass (Figueiredo et al., 1983). 

Given that the adults are mainly sedentary, the larval phase has a very important role in the 

genetic connectivity between populations. Using DVM and with the influence of currents, 

populations export and import larvae from adjacent populations maintaining the genetic pool 

(Stamatis et al., 2004). This species shows some genetic divergence at a regional scale, 

however genetic differentiation at the distributional range of the species doesn’t seem to be 

significant to allow for the assumption of genetic isolation of populations (Stamatis et al., 

2004).  

The size of first maturation (smallest size at which 50% of the females display functional 

reproductive capacity, with ripe ovaries and spermatophores) also changes according to 



Introduction 

20 
 

latitude. Studies by Figueiredo et al. (1983), point out that the age of first maturity 

corresponds to the second and third year of life and is independent from size. However, data 

in Relini et al. (1998), using female Norway lobsters from the Algarve, indicate a 50% 

maturation length at around 30 mm. According to Queirós et al. (2013), some individuals 

with physiological readiness to reproduce may not be able to do so either due to small body 

size or underdevelopment of the body parts responsible for the mating process, a situation 

that should be taken into consideration when defining “maturity”. Moreover, the use of 

primary sexual characters for the evaluation of the size of first maturation, may lead to 

underestimation of the size of the onset of maturity (SOM) (Queirós et al., 2013). In Tuck et 

al. (2000), SOM values for females are between 21-34 mm carapace length and 29-46 mm 

for males. 

 

Growth and moult 

The moulting process is highly variable in length increment and moult frequency. These 

change according to the conditions of the environment and from individual to individual. The 

moult increment increases in absolute value with age, but is represents a higher percentage 

of the pre-moult size in younger individuals. The moult is more frequent in younger 

individuals and upon reaching sexual maturity males can moult as much as twice a year until 

they reach three, four years (Farmer 1973), while females will only moult once a year after 

maturation (Sardà 1995). The combination of more frequent molts and higher percent 

increase at moult in young individuals represents faster growth rates and an attenuation of 

growth rates with time can be observed in crustaceans as in other marine species such as fish. 

For this reason, Nephrops growth can be represented by the von Bertalanffy growth curve. ´ 

Age-length relationships do not show a clear pattern. Variability in growth, differences onset 

by the reproductive cycle and the absence of calcified structures that allow for exact ageing 

of individuals may account for the lack of such a pattern (Aydin and Aydin, 2011; Ayza et 

al., 2011).  

 

Behaviour  



Introduction 

21 
 

As a burrowing decapod, Nephrops spends most of its time hidden, coming out mainly during 

dawn and dusk in shallow waters (Hammond and Naylor, 1977). In areas where their 

distribution extends deeper than 150 m, the peak of activity slowly converges to a single peak 

that occurs at noon (Chapman and Howard, 1979; Rice and Chapman, 1971; Ungfors et al., 

2013). During their emergence from the burrows these individuals scavenge the seafloor. 

Studies show Nephrops exhibits some degree of fidelity to the burrow with occasional change 

of location associated with the creation of a new burrow (Chapman and Howard, 1979), 

consistent with short scavenging ranges. Their emergence rhythm is also conditioned by other 

factors such as seasonal variations, bottom type, individual size and water turbidity 

(Chapman and Howard, 1979). 

 

1.6. Assessment and management of Nephrops norvegicus 

 

In the North Atlantic, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands manage their Nephrops fisheries 

independently while in Europe these fisheries are managed under the Common Fisheries 

Policy (CFP) (Johnsen et al., 2011; Ungfors et al., 2013). The current management policy is 

a top-down approach with input measures including minimum mesh sizes, closed seasons, 

closed areas. maximum number of days at sea and output measures such as total allowable 

catch quotas (TAC), minimum landing size (MLS) and catch composition (Ungfors et al., 

2013).  

In Europe, the body responsible for the analysis of the scientific advice of the stock 

assessment and management from the International Council for the exploration of the Sea 

(ICES), is the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). This 

committee provides an overview of the ICES advice together with an evaluation and 

recommendation to the European Commission. Nephrops norvegicus is managed according 

to FUs, corresponding to stocks. Therefore an FU is defined as a subpopulation of individuals 

restricted to an area where they share similar life parameters as growth, fecundity, 

recruitment, mortality and, for management purposes, the same fishing mortality. Currently 

there are 8 FUs for Nephrops in the Mediterranean and 34 FUs in the North Atlantic from 

which 29 are in EU waters (Ungfors et al., 2013).  



Introduction 

22 
 

 

Stock Assessment 

There are multiple options for assessing stocks. For Nephrops, the most commonly used are 

surplus production models (SPM), length based cohort analysis (LCA) and in recent years, 

abundance information from underwater video cameras (UWTV). 

SPMs are based on a series of catch (in weight) and effort. From these, the ratio catch per 

unit effort (CPUE) is related to effort and the model predicts the maximum equilibrium yield 

(MSY and the corresponding fishing effort (Fmax).It is assumed that CPUE is proportional to 

stock abundance (Cadima, 2003). Fishing effort usually corresponds to the number of fishing 

operations, or fishing time. This can be number of traps set per day, number of hauls, time 

trawled or total soaking time (Harley et al., 2001). SPMs are easy to apply but they may be 

deceiving because the ability of CPUE to indicate stock abundance is very limited. Marine 

species display assemblage behavior that changes according to the season, and fishers with 

the capacity to predict this behavior attain high CPUE. Environmental causes can change 

these concentrations and, if fishers continue to fish on those areas, the CPUE will be low 

causing underestimation of the true stock abundance (Harley et al., 2001). Recent studies 

point out that the use of CPUE as the exclusive method for management, may lead to the 

collapse of a stock. Biological systems take time to answer to disturbances, hence a stock 

may be collapsing while CPUE values stay high, only dropping when the stock gets below 

the target reference points (Harley et al., 2001).  

LCA is based on catch data (Hilborn and Walters, 1992). The inputs for the model are catch 

data from commercial fisheries, fishing mortality rates derived from catch data and an 

estimated value of natural mortality. This method computes the number of individuals in the 

stock and its survivors, predicting the stock composition in the following year by using 

additional information on recruitment and fecundity. However, it also requires growth 

information, in the form a function, usually the von Bertallanfy growth curve, which relates 

length and age, a relationship difficult to obtain in crustaceans (Aguzzi and Sardà, 2012).  

The difficulty in obtaining age data is common to all crustaceans and results from the absence 

of permanent calcified parts, where growth rings can be formed. Traditional methods used in 

fish, where growth marks can be observed in otoliths or scales, do not have correspondence

23 
 

in crustacean. The correlation between length and age is therefore difficult, and growth 

curves are usually obtained with statistical techniques based on modal identification in length 

frequencies. Von Bertalanffy parameters can therefore be obtained and used in assessment 

models to convert length into age. Length data conversion is flawed due to the growth 

plasticity in Nephrops and may lead to bias (Ungfors et al., 2013). Nevertheless, this method 

is considered to be the standard for Nephrops stock assessment, largely due to the absence of 

a better one. The method is as good as the base data used and therefore, it is highly dependent 

on the reliability of the fishers to report the catch (Aguzzi and Sardà, 2012).  

Image based technologies made possible new procedures for Nehrops assessment. The use 

of cameras on trawls to assess Nephrops density was developed as an alternative to other 

conventional methods (Fonseca et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2012). With the creation of a proper 

algorithm that can analyze video and images, this method seems to offer a faster and easier 

way to assess Nephrops density, although problems have been reported with this technique 

(Fonseca et al., 2008). Some limitations of this method has to do with the fact it counts 

burrows, not individual Nephrops. The second problem is that, while processing the image 

and identifying galleries, it is difficult to distinguish between primary entrances and 

secondary openings, and the counting of galleries or identification of gallery systems is 

difficult (Fonseca et al., 2008).

Management of Nephrops norvegicus 

Portuguese waters include 3 functional units: FU 27, 28 and 29 (Figure 1.3) which belong to 

ICES area IXa. Records for Nephrops fisheries in Portugal are available in the FAO database 

since 1950. Landings reached a peak at 3025 t in 1987 and progressively declined until 1995. 

In 2012 the total landings were of 182 t (FAO landings 2012) (Figure 1.4).

In Portugal, Nephrops started to be caught as bycatch of hake fisheries (Costa et al., 2008) 

and thus the assessment in early years was mainly based on a rough estimate from the 

bycatch. As it started to attain economic importance, there was an allocation of part of the 

fleet to target Norway lobster (Castro et al., 1998; González et al., 2011; Ungfors et al., 

2013). Recent catch reports show a declining trend, which has been recorded since 1987. 

This reduction in Nephrops catches caused the effort to be shifted to other crustacean species 

such as the rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris). Later the CFP established that all stocks 

should be exploited at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but to put this directive into 

practice, the biological reference points must be known. The reference points of all the 

Iberian Nephrops stocks are currently unknown, the only current assumption is that the stocks 

were exploited above the MSY due to the low CPUE (ICES, 2012). The current management 

policy is the maintenance of TAC and MLS, but the stock response has not been evaluated. 

In Portugal, Nephrops is currently managed under the Recovery Plan for Nephrops and 

southern hake (Regulamento CE Nº 2166/2005, de 20 de Dezembro).

Objective of the study  

This study was developed with two main goals. One was to understand how traps and trawl 

gears affect the population structure of Nephrops. The other was to compare the impacts of 

these gears on the benthic community, in particular on species that compose the bycatch. 

 

  



Methodology 

27 
 

2. Methodology 
 

This study was based on Nephrops population from FU 28 (SW coast of Portugal). The 

objective was to compare the catches from two types of gear, traps and trawl, hence samples 

for both gears were simultaneously taken in the same geographic location. This area is known 

as Mar de Sesimbra by the local fishermen. The area adjacent to the coast is a marine 

protected area, the Parque Marinho Luiz Saldanha. This protected area covers 53km2 starting 

at Figueirinha’s beach and ending in the Foz’s beach, north of Cape Espichel. The continental 

shelf is narrow and the base of the slope, at around 1000 meters depth, is 20 km distant from 

the coast. This is the area where Setúbal and Lisboa canyons meet, which is limited at the 

south by a group of underwater hills (Infante Dom Pedro, Infante Santo and Infante Dom 

Henrique). 

The crustacean trawler was 18.8 m overall length (LOA) and 8 m wide, fiberglass hull, gross 

tonnage (GT) of 69 t and engine power of 221 kW. The trap vessel (a polyvalent vessel 

operating several fixed gears, among them creels) was 15 m LOA, 23 GT, wooden hull and 

an engine power of 119 kW.  

The dates of the study were chosen in order to cover different seasons during the year. The 

samples were obtained from 15th to 17th July 2014 (summer), 9th to 12th December 2014 

(winter) and 17th to 19th March 2015 (spring). 

The study was undertaken during regular fishing trips and had two conditioning factors: (1) 

not interfering or slowing down the fishing operations, (2) only one person dedicated to data 

collection in each vessel was available. Difficulties were of a different nature in each vessel. 

On board the trawler, the working conditions were good but the amounts of catch and bycatch 

to process were overwhelming in most hauls. On board the trap vessel, the working 

conditions were very harsh (open deck and very little space to work). The sampling 

procedures, for the catch and bycatch composition and Nephrops biological sampling, were 

adapted to those conditions to obtain sufficient data in the most efficient way. 

 



Methodology 

28 
 

2.1 Trawl samples 

 

A standard commercial trawl net was used in the sampling, with a diamond mesh codend 70 

mm mesh size. The GPS coordinates and time were registered at the start and the end of each 

haul. A total of 17 tows were conducted during this study, 8 during the summer, 3 during the 

winter, and 6 during the spring. The duration of the hauls was approximately 6 hours.  

The length composition of the target species, Nephrops, was obtained for each tow, from a 

random sample (2 to 4 kg) taken before sorting Nephrops by size. The standard measurement 

for Nephrops was used, the carapace length (CL), the distance from the posterior border of 

the eye socket to the center of the posterior border of the cephalothorax (Figure 2.1), 

measured to the lowest mm using calipers. During this process, the sex and the ovigerous 

conditions of the females were also registered.  

 

Figure 2.1-Photo showing the standard length for Nephrops. 

The catch was sorted out by the crew and Nephrops, as well as commercial bycatch, were 

separated by species and weighted. The unwanted bycatch was stored in boxes before it was 

discarded at sea, the number of boxes was counted and one of the boxes was chosen to be 

sampled. This box was weighted, and all the species identified (presence/absence). The total 



Methodology 

29 
 

weight of the discarded bycatch was estimated using, as extrapolation factor, the number of 

boxes.  

 

2.2 Creel samples 

 

Traps were set on the ocean floor, at the edge of the trawling grounds, for 5 days (soaking 

time). 

The traps had a welded steel structure with dimensions 50x20x25 cm and were covered with 

5 mm plastic net mesh (Figure 2.2). They included a funnel shape entrance and a bait cylinder 

pocket accessible from the outside. The entrance funnel had an inner opening of 15 cm and 

an outer opening of 25 cm, allowing the species to enter easily, but making the escape 

difficult. The bait cylinder with filled with sated bait. The most common species used were 

the largehead hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) and Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus 

trachurus), both chosen due to their low commercial value. Fish from previous fishing 

operations (from other trawling vessels from the same company) and of no value, were also 

used.  



Methodology 

30 
 

 

Figure 2.2- Photo of one of the traps used during this study. 

The trap line followed the typical basic design of this gear, with a main line sitting on the 

bottom to which the traps are connected through a short cable. The main line is attached at 

each end to a vertical line with weights on the bottom and floaters and signaling flags at the 

surface (Figure 2.3). Individual traps have a secondary point of attachment to the main line, 

in order to increase the chance of recovery in case they get caught on the bottom. Each trap 

line consisted of 100 to 200 traps.

Figure 2.3- Illustration of a trap line. 

 

During haul up all species caught were identified and counted. All the Nephrops were 

measured and sexed. Since no scale was available on board, the weight of the Nephrops catch 

was obtained by adding the individual weights estimated by using a length-weight 

relationship, applied to each sex, based on a sample previously obtained for the same area:  

? = ???  

Where w is the weight in grams and L the length in mm. The parameters for females were 

a=0.0091, b=2.3286 and for males a=0.00043 and b=3.1101. 



Methodology 

32 
 

All species other than Nephrops, in this gear, were either discarded at sea or kept for future 

use as bait. This means that the fraction “retained bycatch” does not exist for this gear.  

 

2.3 Biodiversity indexes 

 

The level of information obtained for each species and fraction of the catch was the 

following: 

? Target species, Nephrops: biological sampling (length distribution, sex ratio) and 

total weight per haul; 

? Retained bycatch (only for trawling): species list and total weight by species and haul; 

? Discarded bycatch: species list per haul (both gears) and total numbers by species 

(only traps). 

In this situation, the only comparable information for all species and catch fractions was 

presence/absence (P/A).  

Biodiversity indexes for presence/absence data were reviewed (Wilson and Shmida; 1984; 

Colwell and Coddington, 1994; Koleff et al., 2003). Three indexes were applied (separately 

for each gear), two of them based on the frequencies or rare species (Whittaker, 1960 in 

Wilson and Shmida, 1984 and Lande, 1996 in Koleff et al., 2003) and one based on the total 

number of species present (index modified from Chao, 1984 in Colwell and Coddington, 

1994):

where S is the total number of species recorded (all seasons), ??? is the average number of 

species per season, ???? is the number of species per season, L is the number of species that 

occur only once per season, M is the number of species that occurred in exactly two samples 

in a season and n is the number of samples per season. 

Whittaker’s and Lande’s indexes are based on the total number of species present in all 

seasons and the average number of species present in each season. In eq. 1, since ?&gt;??, and 

assuming ? ?&gt;1, ?1 will tend to have values close to zero at points of high diversity (where the 

ratio ?/? ? will be only slightly above 1) and high values at points of low biodiversity where 

???? and the ratio ?/? ? &gt;&gt;1 (Koleff et al., 2003). The range of possible values for ?1 is] 0, S-

1 [. 

The same variables are used in a more direct way in eq. 2, where ?2 varies inversely with 

biodiversity (Koleff et al., 2003). The range of values for ?2 is] 0, S [. 

Equation. 3 presents a different type of index, Chao’s modified index, which is sensitive to 

the presence of rare species, expressed by the variables L and M. This index values rare 

species and when presented with samples with no rare species (L=M=0), ?3=Sobs (Koleff et 

al., 2003). The quantity between brackets in eq. 3 is affected by L and M as well as the sample 

size n that defines the multipliers for L and M. The multiplier for M, equal to (n-1)2/ (n2-n), 

is always smaller than the multiplier for L. The quantity between brackets tends to be 

positive, with higher values associated to high frequencies of rare species. In theory, ?3 can 

fall below Sobs if M is considerably higher than L (Koleff et al., 2003).

Table 3.1 presents the sample size for Nephrons as well as the catch fractions (target species, 

bycatch discarded and bycatch retained) in the different hauls and Table 3.2 the percentages 

of each catch fraction in each haul. A total of 1027 Nephrons were sampled, 470 in the 

summer, 145 in the winter and 412 in the spring. Nephrons represented around 4% of the 

total catch in weight and 22% of the bycatch had commercial value and was retained. Most 

of the catch was systematically discarded. The percentage of discarded bycatch varied 

between a minimum of 57% in Summer and a maximum of 92% in Spring averaging around 

75% in total. 

Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 include the species composing the bycatch discarded and the bycatch 

retained respectively. The most important retained species are the anglerfish and the hake, 

followed by the dogfish and the gurnards. All retained species were also discarded, including 

Nephrops. There were multiple reasons for discarding. The most important one was lack of 

market value; this was the case for lantern shark, slimehead, pipefish, grenadier, lantern 

fishes, and hermit crabs, carrying crab, swimmer crab, whelks, sea urchins and sea 

cucumbers. For other species, such as conger, rockfish, megrim, anglerfish, greater 

forkbeard, rays, dogfish, rose shrimp, red shrimp, brown crab, Norway lobster and squid only 

the small sizes are discarded. The curled octopus and the blue whiting, with catches quite 

uniform in terms of the size of individuals, are retained when the caught amounts are low, 

and discarded otherwise. For hake, the main reason for discarding is quota limitations.

3.2. Creel samples 

 

Data from the trap fishery are presented in Table 3.5 and Table 3.6. A total of 5 trap sets were 

carried out during the Summer and 6 during the Winter. The weather conditions did not allow 

sampling in the spring. The number of traps per line was conditioned by the seafloor pattern; 

in rocky areas the number of traps will be just enough to cover the mud floor available among 

the rocks. Several lines of traps were deployed during each trip. During this study a total of 

1777 traps were deployed and sampled, 787 during summer and 990 during the winter.

A total of 12 different bycatch species were captured, including 3 species of fish belonging 

to 3 families, 5 species of crustaceans (5 families), 2 species of Molluscs (2 families), 2 

species of Echinoderms (2 families). All the species in the traps were also captured with the 

trawl. In the Summer a total of 10 bycatch species were captured, while in Winter only 6 

were. Most species were captured during Summer, in particular the crabs. The only exception 

was the swimming crab, the most abundant species in the catches that was almost entirely 

captured during the Winter.

Figure 3.2- Number of species present in each sample. TP represents trap samples and TR 

represent trawl samples. 

The impact of the trawl fishery on benthic biodiversity is clearly higher when compared to 

the traps. The difference is mainly associated with the active and passive nature of trawl and 

traps. While the trawling sweeps the grounds and catches all species not able to run away 

(both benthic and benthopelagic), the traps stay on the bottom and catch only benthic species 

that are attracted to the bait and do not exit the traps, mostly invertebrate scavengers.

The usage given to the bycatch of the traps is more consistent, only Nephrops is kept for 

commercial purposes. Although the bycatch species from the traps were only counted, while 

in the trawler they were weighted, the disproportion of the importance of the bycatch fraction 

in the two gears unequivocally indicates the much higher impact on bottom biodiversity of 

trawling (Figure 3.3).

The biodiversity indexes (Table 3.8) as expected, were notoriously different between traps 

and trawls. ?1 and ?2 indexes are inversely related with the number of rare species while ?3 

represents the number of species present and varies in opposite direction of the other indexes. 

These indexes are derived from beta diversity indexes and time was our continuous variable.

For the trawling little differences were found among seasons for all the indexes. This means 

that the composition of the catch, for the period of the study, had little changed. The variation 

in the seasonal values for these indexes is mainly due to the presence of three species, P. 

blenoides, L. vulgaris and skates. The differences between seasons are more pronounced for 

the traps, but since the species count is based on rare occurrences of most species, the index 

variation may be biased.

Length frequency distributions, for each gear and season, are presented in Figure 3.4. An 

analysis of the length distributions clearly indicates that trawlers catch a fraction of smaller 

individuas from both sexes that are not present in the traps.

4. Discussion 
 

The purpose of this study was to compare the species diversity of the catch and the size 

structure of Nephrops between two gears targeting the same species (Nephrops) in the same 

area. The fishing operations of both gears were conducted in the same area and at the same 

time, in order to guarantee that the biotic community and Nephrops population are the same. 

Complete overlap of the areas was not possible, because the trawling activity is not 

compatible with the presence of fixed gears, but the bathymetry was similar and the fishing 

grounds contiguous (Figure 3.1). The coordination of the operations between the two 

skippers was guaranteed by using vessels from the same company.  

Nephrops trawl activity and trap fisheries have been the focus of several studies, and several 

areas of Europe have different policies to allocate effort between traps and trawls. Creel 

fisheries for Nephrops are well established in Nordic regions such as Western Scotland and 

the Swedish Skagerrak. In the Faroe Islands a sustainable creel fishery developed where 

trawling was banned and in other European regions creels are being currently tested as an 

alternative to trawls as is the case of the North eastern part of the Adriatic Sea. In other areas, 

creeling operations are experimental (the central Adriatic sea, Morello et al. 2009) or at a 

reduced scale (Portuguese coast, Leocádio et al.2012). 

With respect to faunistic diversity of catches and quantities of by catch, the higher values for 

the trawl are not a surprise. Similar results were attained in all studies where traps were 

compared to trawls. A total of 27 species belonging to 26 families were captured. All species 

were present in the trawl but only 13 on the traps. The number of species present in each haul 

was consistently higher than the corresponding number in each trap line, indicating much 

higher impact of trawling on bottom biodiversity. This impact is even higher when it is 

analyzed in terms of biomass or number of individuals, much higher in the trawl when 

compared to traps.  

In several studies comparing trawl and trap fisheries similar conclusions were reached. 

Trawls have a higher impact in terms of biomass, both from the target species and the

bycatch. The main issue with trawl fisheries is the high proportion of unwanted catch (species 

and biomass), usually more than half of the catch being discarded at sea. This is true for most 

trawl fisheries (Alverson et al.1994), especially those targeting crustaceans. Some countries 

have developed ways of using this bycatch, reducing the amount of discards. An example is 

the shrimp trawl fisheries in China where most bycatch is landed to produce fishmeal (Chiu 

et al., 2013), a procedure replicated in South American countries. Some other countries have 

developed other ways to deal with the discard problem such as Canada and Northern 

countries that have enforced the use of by-catch reducing devices in trawls, for example grid 

sorting systems or square mesh windows, allowing the escapement of a significant fraction 

of the unwanted catch (Alverson et al.1994). 

Trawl impacts are also generally high on the sea floor (Guijarro et al.,2011; Martín et al., 

2014). The trawl doors scrap the ocean floor during their activity, destroying any structures 

present in their path. The movement of the vessel will also cause pressure on the gear, 

responsible for abrasions in the catch and even the death of some individuals due to crushing 

(Guijarro et al., 2011). Once inside the trawl net, escapement is possible but the injuries 

inflicted to the individuals during the process are of such an extent that most individuals will 

die; all these factors will affect the real mortality caused by this gear (Leocádio et al., 2012). 

This is relevant for this study because it was noticed that the individuals of most species 

arrived at the deck either dead or with serious injuries. Mortality of the bycatch will be very 

high even for small fish and crustaceans that are discarded, leading to the question of whether 

the use of this type of gear can be justified and sustainable, having into account the small 

amount of catch retained for commercial purposes (Guijarro et al., 2011). 

The effects of the traps on the sea bottom are less important, but still not negligible. Some 

studies indicate that the deployment of this gear can lead to disturbances on the sea bottom 

(Leocádio et al., 2012), but most criticisms come from the unseen bycatch of this gear (Hall 

et al.,2000). A hypothesis could be that the bycatch species present in the traps are rare 

events, but the long soaking time of the traps may lead the capture of species that are 

consumed by predators or scavengers and are never accounted as bycatch. It has been 

registered that some species of predators can freely enter the traps and feed on the catch. This 

behavior has been recorded in several trap fisheries, with species such as Octopus magnificus

(Groeneveld et al., 2006), using the traps to get easy meals (Favaro et al.,2010; Raby et al., 

2014; Watanuki et al.,2000).  

With the acknowledgement of the importance of managing fisheries at an ecosystem level 

and reducing discards, the renovation of stocks by safeguarding juveniles has been enforced, 

and traps fisheries have increased in the recent years. During this study it was possible to 

observe that the majority of the trawl catch had no commercial value, mainly due to the 

abundance of undersized individuals and unmarketable species. Another factor was the 

degree of damage observed in a high number of individuals. 

Contrary to trawls, creels yielded little or no bycatch with individuals of commercially 

important species rarely caught. Most of the individuals caught belonged to the family 

Buccinidae and were discarded due to the lack of commercial value. 

The higher impact of trawling has to do with the nature of the gears and with their fishing 

process because trawling relies on the engine power to drag the net throughout the ocean 

floor catching most of the individuals in the area swept while in the creel case, the catch will 

depend on the attraction power of the bait and access to the creel entrances (Morello et al., 

2009). 

The size distributions of Nephrops caught by creels and bottom trawling were different. The 

trawl catch was composed of a wide size range (30 mm to 75 mm) but 50% of the individuals 

were below 43 mm carapace length whereas the trap catch was composed of large size 

individuals (42mm to 76mm) with the exception of a single individual with 15 mm. The 

selectivity for larger individuals, mostly males, is commonly recorded in creel fisheries and 

this is attributed to behavioral differences (Morello et al., 2009). Selectivity for larger sizes 

can be double edge sword, on one side it guarantees that smaller individuals survive to reach 

reproductive size, on the other side it can lead to a decrease in the age of first maturity, an 

effect that has been widely reported on fish species (Cubillos et al., 2014). 

The condition and size of Nephrops changes their market value (Eriksson 2006; Milligan et 

al., 2009; Leocádio et al., 2012; Ridgway et al., 2006). This is largely evidenced for the ex-

vessel price (DGRM 2015). In 2014, the price per Kg of Nephrops caught with a trawler had 

a mean value of 13.47€/kg while the price per Kg of Nephrops caught with traps was 



Conclusion 

53 
 

40.45€/kg. This gap in value is due not only to size differences but also because individuals 

caught with traps arrive on deck alive, are kept alive in tanks on board and are sold alive. 

Markets nowadays value fresh products due to their quality and therefore individuals sold 

alive provide an opportunity to value trap fisheries (Eriksson 2006;, Milligan et al., 2009). 

Although the trawl caught roughly 3 times the amount of Nephrops, the ex-vessel value for 

the traps was 3 times higher, and total income from Nephrops was not much different 

between the two gears. However, when valuing both fisheries, trawling had the added income 

from the bycatch species. During this study, a total of 11 bycatch species were kept, of which, 

at least two of the most abundant, anglerfish and hake, reach high market prices.  

 

 

5. Conclusion 
 

With all considerations in mind, the sustainability of Nephrops fisheries should be improved 

and two kinds of actions are suggested. One aspect is the improvement of selectivity with 

gear modifications such as BRDs. Some of these devices were tested with good results in the 

Portuguese crustacean trawling fleet and the retention of important bycatch species, such as 

blue whiting Micromesistius. poutassou, can be significantly reduced (Fonseca et al., 2005, 

2007). These management measures can be important for the south coast, where traps do not 

seem to be, at this point, a viable option, due to, Nephrops smaller sizes in this area when 

compared to the southwest coast. A second line of action should be the exclusion of trawlers 

from certain areas, allowing the expansion of the creel fishery, at the moment restricted to 

areas inside the 6 miles limit or in a few other small areas of hard bottoms inaccessible to 

trawling. This approach would be important for the Southwest coast from Sesimbra to Cape 

St. Vincent. In this region, the exclusion of trawling between the 6 and 12 miles would not 

require negotiations at the EU and could be very positive, not only for the creel fisheries but 

for other fixed gears as well. The added income such a measure would bring with improve 

the economic sustainability of local polyvalent fleets. If such a management measurement is 

implemented, studies should be conducted in order to evaluate the effects of the gear change, 



Conclusion

on all aspects of fisheries sustainability namely, ecosystem recovery and socioeconomic 

aspects. 

Other factors should be considered when comparing gears, for example fuel consumption, 

employment and social conditions. With respect to fuel, a previous study done on the same 

fleets showed that during one day of activity the trawler spent 9 times the amount of fuel 

when compared with the trap vessel (Leocádio et al., 2012). With respect to employment, the 

trap vessel can accommodate up to 6 crew member (usually 5 at a given time) and the trawler 

employs 7 crew members. The multiplication factor (jobs generated) maintaining the 

working conditions, are clearly better in the trawler. In the trap vessel all work is done on an 

open deck with much worst conditions for resting, having meals or taking care of personal 

hygiene. A conversion of the fleet needs to consider comfort and safety conditions for the 

vessels crews.
