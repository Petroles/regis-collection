Summary/Resumo
O ciclo do N, composto por diversas etapas, é mediado principalmente por microrganismos. Os microrganismos diazotróficos fixam Azoto (N2), introduzindo-o na biosfera. Os compostos orgânicos azotados são depois mineralizados, em ambientes aeróbios, a amónia. Esta é rapidamente oxidada a nitrito (NO2-) e nitrato (NO3-) pelos microrganismos oxidantes de amónia (AOM) e oxidantes de nitrito (NOM), processo denominado de nitrificação. Em ambientes anaeróbios, pode ocorrer a desnitrificação com a redução do nitrato a óxido nítrico (NO), óxido nitroso (N2O) e azoto molecular (N2) (Bock and Wagner, 2006).
Um equilíbrio da forma e quantidade de N nos ecossistemas é vital, pois o ecossistema pode perder fertilidade com reduzida quantidade de N, mas pode sofrer eutrofização com elevadas concentrações de N. O ciclo do Azoto pode não ocorrer linearmente, sendo a resposta da comunidade microbiana responsável pelos processos de oxi-redução do azoto dependente das condições do ecossistema, tal como, a taxa de conversão de cada processo dependente do controlo da atividade microbiana, afeta a disponibilidade e a forma de azoto no ecossistema. Com excesso de N na forma orgânica, deverá haver um aumento na atividade de mineralização, seguido de nitrificação e desnitrificação, resultando na libertação de N para a atmosfera. Esta situação ocorre, se existirem condições ótimas para todos os processos, no entanto, o aumento da concentração de amónia, nitrito, nitrato, ou outros compostos resultantes dos processos oxi-redutivos do ciclo do azoto, no solo, pode ocorrer se as condições necessárias para um dos processos não se verificarem.
A nitrificação é o processo de oxidação da amónia a nitrito e nitrito a nitrato, catalisado por 2 grupos de organismos distintos (Norton and Stark, 2011; Fienck et al. 2005; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007), sendo a oxidação da amónia considerado o passo limitante da nitrificação.
A oxidação da amónia é catalisada por diversos grupos, sendo as bactérias e árqueas quimiolitotróficas oxidantes de amónia (AOB e AOA respetivamente) os principais intervenientes em ambientes terrestres aeróbios (Norton and Stark, 2011; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007).
As bactérias oxidantes de amónia (AOB) quimiolitotróficas são membros das classes p ou y de Proteobacteria. Nas p-proteobacteria existem 4 géneros diferentes, Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Nitrosolobus e Nitrosovibrio. O género Nitrosococcus pertence às Y-Proteobacteria (Purkhold et al. 2000). As AOB estão distribuídas por diversos ambientes costeiros, marinhos e ambientes polares (maioritariamente 2 clusters, Nitrosomonas e Nitrosospira), ambientes salinos ou hipersalinos (Nitrosomonas), condições com temperaturas elevadas (Nitrosospira) e ambientes acídicos (Nitrosomonas) (Junier et al. 2010; Prosser and Nicol, 2008).
AOB são bactérias litoautotróficas, tendo como substrato principal a amónia (NH3), e como dador de eletrões a hidroxilamina. A oxidação da amónia é catalisada pela enzima amónia monoxigenase (AMO), produzindo hidroxilamina, sendo esta oxidada a nitrito pela enzima hidroxilamina oxiredutase (HAO) (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Hatzenpichler, 2012).
As árqueas oxidantes de amónia (AOA), pertencentes ao novo filo Thaumarchaeota (Norton and Stark, 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012) aparentam estar presentes em diversos ambientes mesofilicos (marinhos, água-doce e terrestres) assim como em condições extremas (ambientes

acidófilos, termófilos, águas profundas e fontes termais) (Junier et al. 2010; Nicol and Schleper, 2006). A via metabólica das AOA é pouco conhecida, não tendo sido ainda identificado nenhum homologo da enzima HAO (Hatzenpichler, 2012; He et al. 2012). No entanto, parecem ter a capacidade de utilizar fontes orgânicas de energia como aminoácidos (He et al. 2012; Tourna et al. 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012). A enzima AMO das AOA, comparativamente à AMO das AOB, tem uma maior afinidade para a amónia, podendo ter as AOA uma maior contribuição para a atividade nitrificante em ambientes oligotróficos (He et al. 2012; Martens-Habbena et al. 2009).
A importância da nitrificação baseia-se no facto de ser o único processo biológico oxidativo que liga fontes de azoto inorgânico reduzido (amónia) e oxidado (nitrito e nitrato) (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009; Norton and Stark, 2011; Fienck et al. 2005; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007). Nitrito, o produto da oxidação da amónia, é normalmente encontrado em baixas concentrações nos solos devido à sua toxicidade, sendo essencial manter uma baixa concentração (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Norton and Stark, 2011; Cleemput and Samater, 1996). Para além do nitrito, o óxido nítrico e óxido nitroso também podem ser produzidos através da redução do nitrito pela nitrito redutase (NIR) presente em algumas bactérias oxidantes de amónia (Bremner, 1997; Burns et al. 1996). Além de promoverem a acidificação do solo com a formação de ácidos, o óxido nitroso age como um gás com efeito de estufa, 310x mais potente que o dióxido de carbono (Yamanaka, 2008; Bock and Wagner, 2006; Hatzenpichler, 2012). O nitrato pode ser utilizado como fonte de azoto por diversos organismos, e em excesso pode causar eutrofização desse ecossistema. Sendo facilmente lixiviado pode causar a contaminação de águas subterrâneas (Fienck et al, 2005).
Tendo a nitrificação uma forte influência no fluxo de azoto nos sistemas terrestres e marinhos, e os seus produtos importantes na determinação da qualidade de solos e águas, o estudo da influência dos fatores bióticos e abióticos no controlo da atividade nitrificante e crescimento dos organismos nitrificantes é essencial.
Existem diversos fatores estudados que influenciam o crescimento e atividade das comunidades oxidantes de amónia. Um dos principais fatores é a concentração de substrato, neste caso, amónia. Como foi referido, o aumento da concentração de N no ecossistema pode levar a um aumento da atividade nitrificante, dependendo da suscetibilidade das estirpes de AOB ao substrato e a sua adaptação ao aumento da amónia. Este aumento de atividade é problemática se houver acumulação de nitrito, nitrato ou outros produtos resultantes dessa atividade. A acumulação de nitrito ocorre em condições favoráveis à oxidação da amónia desfavoráveis à oxidação de nitrito e desnitrificação, como, ambientes bem oxigenados e condições alcalinas ou com pH neutro (Fienck et al. 2005), sendo as AOB muito suscetíveis a alterações no pH. Logo, a oxigenação dos solos e pH são outros fatores a ter em conta. Em ambientes pouco oxigenados (condições de microaerofilia) a formação de óxidos nitroso e nítrico é estimulada (Fienck et al. 2005; Bock and Wagner, 2006). Em solos carbonatados a produção de óxidos é reduzida pela interação química com os carbonatos, formando nitrito e nitrato. (Bock and Wagner, 2006). A produção de nitritos pode ser inibida pela presença de compostos orgânicos (Adair and Schwartz, 2008), no entanto algumas espécies de AOB podem crescer
mixotroficamente (amónia e C orgânico como fonte de energia, podendo haver produção de nitritos) com compostos como piruvato ou acetato, ou organotroficamente (C orgânico como fonte de energia, sem produção de nitritos) com açúcares. Contudo a nitrificação pode ser importante e benéfica para algumas plantas que utilizem preferencialmente o nitrato (Bock and Wagner, 2006), logo em ambientes pobres em nitrato a nitrificação pode ser estimulada pelas plantas. Assim, fatores a considerar para o estudo de populações de microrganismos oxidantes de amónia são nicho (solo rizosférico ou superfície das raízes), a adaptação à adição de N no solo, a concentração de substrato, pH das culturas e presença de matéria orgânica.
Tendo em vista o estudo da comunidade oxidante de amónia (Bactérias e Árqueas) num ecossistema mediterrânico os principais objetivos deste trabalho foram:
1.	Estudar a localização preferencial da comunidade oxidante de amónia (solo rizosférico ou superfície das raízes de Cistus ladanifer)
2.	Estudar o efeito da adição de N no solo, na atividade e estrutura das comunidades oxidantes de amónia
3.	Estudar o efeito da concentração de substrato (amónia), pH e presença de compostos orgânicos azotados/ glucose / acetato em culturas de AOB provenientes de solos com e sem adição de N
Num ecossistema mediterrâneo, pobre em nutrientes, os nichos preferenciais para o crescimento de microrganismos oxidantes de amónia deverão estar localizados perto da raiz das plantas, ou na superfície das raizes, proporcionando uma maior troca de nutrientes entre planta-microrganismos (Ochua-Hueso et al, 2011), além de facultar condições de oxigenação, pH e conteúdo em água favoráveis para o crescimento e atividade de oxidantes de amónia.
Sendo os solos pobres em azoto e matéria orgânica (Dias et al. 2012), espera-se encontrar populações de AOB mais adaptadas a ambientes oligotróficos. No entanto, em solos com frequente adição de N ao longo de 6 (desde 2007), o aumento da disponibilidade de N na forma de amónia, deverá determinar adaptação das populações de AOB, aumentando a atividade oxidante de amónia, e alterando a comunidade ao nível estrutural.
Em relação ao efeito da concentração de amónia nas culturas de AOB, populações de AOB adaptadas a baixas concentrações de amónia no solo, deverão ser mais suscetíveis a elevadas concentrações de amónia, comparativamente com populações de AOB adaptadas a maiores concentrações de amónia, ou seja provenientes de solos com frequente adição de azoto. Relativamente ao efeito do pH, espera-se que populações com maior atividade nitritante sejam mais tolerantes à acidificação, uma vez que o aumento da atividade leva a uma diminuição do pH, podendo resultar ou não na acidificação do solo, dependendo da composição deste. No efeito de compostos orgânicos nas culturas de AOB, espera-se que haja menor atividade com fontes energéticas orgânicas (para crescimento mixotrófico ou organotrófico), uma vez que AOB adaptadas a ambientes oligotróficos prefiram fontes energéticas e de carbono inorgânicas, como amónia e CO2.
Plantas de Cistus ladanifer de solos sem adição de azoto foram recolhidas juntamente com solo rizosférico a 5-6 cm de profundidade, em julho para estudar o nicho preferencial das AOM. Solo rizosférico e raízes lavadas com água destilada foram utilizadas como inoculo para crescimento de AOB. Para o estudo do efeito da adição de N no solo, amostras de solo foram retiradas a 1 cm da raiz primária de Cistus ladanifer a 5-6 cm de profundidade dentro dos talhões dos 4 tratamentos: controlo (solo sem fertilização) e três diferentes adições de azoto: 40 e 80 kg de N /ha /y na forma de NH4NO3 (40AN e 80AN) e 40 kg de N/ ha /y na forma de NH4+ (40A). O solo foi utilizado como inoculo no crescimento de AOB e AOA. As populações de AOM foram seletivamente cultivadas por 30 (AOB) /60 (AOA) dias com 3 enriquecimentos sucessivos em meio SFC (Synthetic Freshwater Crenoarchaeota) (Konneke et al. 2005; De La Torre et al. 2008), de modo a assegurar a diluição de microrganismos heterotróficos e de matéria orgânica no inoculo de solo inicial. O meio foi suplementando de acordo com a especificidade para bactérias e/ou árqueas oxidantes de amónia (3 antibióticos diferentes). No 3° enriquecimento os meios e condições de incubação foram suplementados/alterados de acordo com o objectivo (fonte de azoto, carbono, concentração de amónia, pH). A atividade das comunidades oxidantes de amónia foi avaliado regularmente pela quantificação do produto final de nitrito, permitindo distinguir a cinética da produção de nitrito de cada cultura. A atividade de cada cultura foi estudada no 3° enriquecimento de modo a ter-se culturas de AOB sem contaminantes. A presença de árqueas e bactérias oxidantes de amónia foi confirmada pela amplificação do gene 16S rRNA e amoA, especifico para cada grupo. A estrutura das comunidades bacterianas oxidantes de amónia foi avaliado por PCR-RFLP fingerprinting, com as enzimas de restrição Hinfl e Haelll. A análise estatística dos dados foi efetuada em SPSS, versão 20 para Windows.
Comparando o número de culturas ativas, taxa de produção de nitrito e concentração máxima de nitrito, uma localização preferencial de atividade das AOB foi observado no solo rizosférico de Cistus ladanifer. No entanto, não foi detetada a presença de AOA nas culturas.
Relativamente ao efeito da adição de azoto no solo, verificou-se uma tendência para o aumento da atividade oxidante de amónia das populações de AOB. No entanto, a resposta da população ao aumento de N no solo depende da forma e quantidade de N aplicado. O controlo da atividade dependerá também da disponibilidade da amónia nos solos, havendo uma competição pelo substrato entre plantas e AOB (Verhagen et al. 1994), principalmente nos tratamentos com maior cobertura vegetal como o 40AN (Dias et al, 2011). Embora a presença de AOA não seja confirmada, as culturas de AOA provenientes de solos sem adição de azoto apresentaram uma maior atividade oxidante de amónia, indicando uma resposta das populações de AOA diferente das populações de AOB. Por PCR-RFLP verificou-se que a estrutura das populações de AOB é alterada com a adição de azoto no solo, tendo os resultados também demonstrado a heterogeneidade dos solos com o mesmo tratamento. Comparando os perfis de PCR-RFLP realizados in-silico para as espécies conhecidas do género Nitrosomonas e Nitrosospira e os perfis obtidos a partir das populações de AOB, Nitrosospira tenuis foi identificada nas populações de AOB de solos com adição de azoto.
Nas populações de AOB foram observadas diferentes suscetibilidades a concentrações crescentes de amónia, tendo as comunidades AOB provenientes de solo sem adição de N uma maior suscetibilidade à amónia, comparativamente a populações de AOB de solos com adição de N. A atividade oxidante de amónia, com produção cumulativa de nitrito, das culturas de populações de AOB presentes em solos sem adição de N foi inibida pela presença de compostos orgânicos como peptona, glucose e acetato. No entanto, as populações de AOB parecem ter a capacidade de utilizar ureia como fonte energética em substituição da amónia.
Considerando a influência dos fatores estudados: nicho preferencial, adição de N no ecossistema, concentração de substrato, pH e presença de compostos orgânicos na atividade das populações de AOB, estas demostraram ser suscetíveis a alterações, não são resilientes e não aparentam ter redundância funcional (não têm o mesmo nível de atividade). Mas a influência que os fatores exercem sobre a população nitrificante é necessária para controlar essa atividade, de modo a que não haja perda de N no sistema. A adição de N no solo não implica necessariamente um aumento da atividade nitritante, se este N não estiver em excesso. No entanto, N em excesso aumentará a atividade nitrificante, com consequente diminuição da quantidade de N inorgânico no solo. Este aumento de atividade levará a uma diminuição no pH, particularmente em solos sem um forte efeito tampão, o que leva a uma inibição da nitrificação. O aumento de nitrito leva também ao aumento de nitrato (oxidação do nitrito a nitrato), e ao consequente aumento da biomassa e compostos orgânicos no solo, inibindo a atividade de AOB sensíveis a matéria orgânica. Diminuindo a oxidação da amónia haverá novamente o aumento de N inorgânico no solo, de modo a não haver perda de N e consequente perda de fertilidade do solo. Esta regulação é mantida devido à sensibilidade apresentada pelas populações de AOB a estes fatores, sendo essencial para o equilíbrio de N no ecossistema.
Nitrification control. How do the Natural ecosystem do it?

Nitrification is a fundamental and central step in the nitrogen cycle, linking the reduced and oxidized nitrogen pools, which processes are mostly accomplished by microorganisms. The first step is mainly done by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and by ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). Regulation of nitrification activity is essential in ecosystem to maintain N balance, since N excess can cause eutrophication and production of toxic compounds, and N limitation can reduce soil fertility. Mediterranean ecosystem soils are poor in terms of N therefore microbial communities can be more susceptible to change when confronted with N input, pH change or presence of organic matter. This study aims to understand the niche preference, the impact of N addition in soils, pH, substrate (ammonia) concentration and presence of organic compounds in ammonia oxidizing populations from Mediterranean soils. Rhizospheric soil and root samples from Cistus Ladanifer were collected from an experimental field in which has been added 3 different N - treatments since 2007, in Serra da Arrábida Natural Park. By using serial culture enrichments and nitrite quantification through incubation time it was possible to quantify and study nitrifying activity. The presence of AOB and AOA in each enrichment was confirmed by PCR. AOB structural community’s change by N-addition in soils was assessed by PCR- RLFP. AOB susceptibility to ammonia, pH and organic compounds was studied by testing several ammonia concentrations in the medium, altering pH and supplementing the medium with organic compounds. As a preferential niche for AOB activity, AOB populations appear to be more abundant in rhizospheric soil of Cistus ladanifer. Soils with N-addition had altered AOB population with higher ammonia oxidizing activity and a different community structure. By comparing in silico PCR-RFLP profiles and the AOB profiles it was possible to identify Nitrosospira tenuis in the AOB population. Though the presence of AOA was not confirmed in any of the treatments, activity of possible AOA from soils without N -addition was higher, than of AOA from soils with N-addition. AOB activity appeared to be influenced by the substrate concentration, with AOB from soils with N-addition being less susceptible to change in substrate concentration. AOB cultures appear to be susceptible to pH, having an activity inhibition with pH above 7 and under 6. The populations are also sensible to the presence of organic matter, however, being capable of using urea as a substrate for ammonia in litotrophic growth and nitrite production activity. It was observed that ammonia oxidation activity can be stimulated by N-addition, altering not just the activity but also the population structure to have a higher tolerance to the substrate. While ammonia oxidising activity is inhibited by pH changes and presence of organic matter.
Introduction
Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen is one of the important elements for life, as it is needed to synthesize major molecules in cell components, as aminoacids and nucleotides being two of many examples. The biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen comprises the biotic and abiotic conversion of the nitrogen compounds between their oxidised and reduced forms. These conversions are done in the atmosphere, in the biosphere and the interaction between both (Bock and Wagner, 2006). In the biosphere, most of the reactions are catalysed by microorganisms. Dinitrogen (N2) can be fixed and introduced in the biosphere by diazotrophs, in the form of ammonia (NH3) or organic nitrogen (amine group). Ammonia, the most frequently found form of nitrogen in the biosphere can be released from organic compounds by mineralization. In aerobic environments ammonia is quickly oxidised to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) by ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM), and by nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms (NOM) in a process called nitrification. In anoxic conditions denitrification can occur. The nitrate is used by denitrifying microorganisms, producing dinitrogen (N2), nitrous oxid (N2O) and nitric oxid (NO) (fig.1). (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Fiencke et al. 2005) The cycle is not entirely linear. Depending on the ecosystem conditions the microbial community responses change. So, the key processes stated above can directly affect the availability and form of N within the ecosystems. The increase of nitrogen can augment the concentration of toxic products, such as ammonia, nitrite, nitrous acid and nitric acid. It can also cause eutrophication of that ecosystem, and the contamination of ground water supplies (Fiencke et al. 2005). The decrease nitrogen can affect soil fertility and plant production (Bock and Wagner, 2006).

Strategies of the Natural ecosystem to balance the nitrogen availability
The natural ecosystems have developed mechanisms that involve multiple paths to nitrogen conservation (Dias et al. 2012). Paths to balance the inorganic and organic nitrogen, and to compensate the nitrogen increase or decrease in soil are essentials to the ecosystems. If there is an excess of nitrogen in soils, it can be reduced by mineralization (if the nitrogen appears as an organic form) followed by nitrification (directly if the nitrogen is in the form of ammonia or urea) and denitrification (directly with nitrate), resulting in the formation of atmospheric nitrogen. If the
system has limited nitrogen there is a need to increase nitrogen fixation and diminished nitrification and denitrification.
Nitrification and ammonia oxidation
Nitrification is the biological conversion of reduced nitrogen, ammonia, ammonium (NH4+) or organic N to oxidized N, nitrite and to nitrate successively. The importance of this process lies on the fact that it is the only oxidative biological process linking reduced and oxidized pools of inorganic nitrogen in nature (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009; Norton and Stark, 2011; Fiencke et al. 2005; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007), and therefore has a strong influence in the fate of N in terrestrial systems.
The oxidation of ammonia by microorganisms can be done by several groups. In the presence of oxygen by the chemolithotrophic bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. In the absence of oxygen by Planctomycetes. In aerobic soil environments the key participants in nitrification are chemolithotrophic bacteria and archaea. Heterotrophic nitrification can be catalysed by fungi, actinomycetes, and other bacteria, and seems to be significant in some forest and acidic pasture soils. The anaerobic oxidation of ammonium is known as the anammox process and it is widespread in marine and freshwater environments, but rarely found in soil. (Norton and Stark, 2011; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007).
Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)
Since the first chemolithotroph ammonia oxidizing bacteria isolation at the end of the nineteenth century by Winogradsky (1890), 16 more species of AOB have been described, accounting for a total of 25 culturable species (Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007). However, many not described species can be found, in culture collections at least 15 additional genospecies (Bock and Wagner, 2006) and more in natural environments.
These 25 species of chemeolitotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are comprise in the Proteobacteria phylum. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis has shown that all recognized AOB are members of the p- or y-subclass of Proteobacteria. In the p-proteobacteria there is 4 genera Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Nitrosolobus and Nitrosovibrio. The Nitrosococcus genus belongs to the y-Proteobacteria (Purkhold et al. 2000).
AOB are widespread in coastal, open ocean, polar environments (mainly 2 clusters, Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira), hypersaline enviroments (Nitrosomonas), high temperatures (Nitrosospira) and acid environments (Nitrosomonas) (Junier et al. 2010; Prosser and Nicol, 2008). Most soil bacterial ammonia oxidizers belong to Nitrosospira genera (Purkhold et al. 2000). Ammonia oxidizing Bacteria rarely grow in soils with a pH lower tan 7, however there are several niches for AOB were the pH is optimal for AOB (Junier et al. 2010).
For lithotrophic AOB ammonia (NH3) but not ammonium (NH4+) is essential as the primary substrate and the intermediate hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as the real energy source. Organic substances like urea or glutamine can be used as alternatives energy sources, when ammonia is not available, by some strains of Nitrosomonas (Nitrosomonas ureae) (Bock and Wagner, 2006). An ammonia oxidation schematic model of electron transport is shown in figure. 2. Ammonia oxidation begins with the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine by AMO. Oxygen (O2) is needed to form the intermediate compound and water. Hydroxylamine is oxidize to nitrite by HAO (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase). Two of the four electrons derived are required for AMO activity. The other two are used for energy generation (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Hatzenpichler, 2012). As most metabolic studies have been done in Nitrosomonas europaea, the metabolic pathways may
not be the same for the other genera.
AOB are autotrophic bacteria able to fix carbon through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (Calvin) cycle (Hatzenpichler, 2012; Sinha and Annachhatre, 2007). Some Nitrosomonas strains have the capacity to grown mixotrophically with organic compounds as carbon source (Clark and Schmidt 1967).
In presence of certain organic carbon compounds, such as pyruvate, the production of

Ammonia_________oxidizing
archaea (AOA)
The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) (Konneke et al. 2005) fundamentally
changed our view of nitrogen cycling in the environment. It was also the start of a new trend of
studies related to the importance of archaea in moderate ecosystems and in nitrification
processes. Since the first study by Konneke (2005) several culture- independent studies with the amoA gene have shown the presence of AOA in several diverse environments. They are present
in mesophyll environments (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments) as well as in
springs) (Junier et al. 2010; Nicol and Schleper, 2006). In some ecosystems they can have a
(Liu et al. 2013), acidic soils or poor nutrient ecosystems (He et al. 2012) are examples, among other.
While in an aquatic environment the majority of AOA belong to “mesophilic crenarchaeaota” 1.1a lineage, representing approximately 20% of all prokaryotes found in these ecosystems (Karner et al. 2001; Prosser and Nicol, 2008), most soils are dominated by sequences of ammonia oxidizing archaea belonging to 1.1b lineage.
The attention and studies done in this group of archaea culminated in a proposal of a third archaeal phylum named Thaumarchaeota (Brochier-Armanet et al. 2008; Spang et al. 2010), with a set of genomic characteristics that make it and distinct phylum (Hatzenpichler, 2012; Spang et al. 2010). Currently the only common physiological trait is the chemolithoautotrophic growth by ammonia oxidation. (Norton and Stark, 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012; He et al. 2012).
The metabolic pathways for ammonia oxidation in AOA are still unclear. No HAO homologue has been found in any AOA genome, so AMO may not catalyse the same reaction as in AOB (Hatzenpichler, 2012; He et al. 2012). In contrast to AOB, thaumarchaeotal populations seem to have the genetic potential and metabolic ability to use amino acid as energy source (Hatzenpichler, 2012). This metabolic ability can also be seen by the preference for organic sources of nitrogen, e.g. aminoacids (He et al. 2012; Tourna et al. 2011). AOA also have a higher affinity for ammonia (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009), being more adaptable to low nutrients conditions, AOA can out-number the AOB in oligotrophic environments.
Some marine species of AOA, e.g. “Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus” have shown a growth inhibition in presence of organic carbon. However the terrestrial Nitrososphaera strains growth can be enhanced by small amounts of pyruvate. So in some soil environments the AOA diversity can be enhance by a rich organic carbon content (Liu et al. 2013), contrasting with most AOB species that are sensible to the presence of organic carbon. So, the preferential nutritional and environmental conditions of AOB and AOA can be distinct, allowing a separation of both communities in distinct niches.
Importance of nitrification and regulation:
Through the nitrification process, several compounds can be produced. The intermediary product of nitrification, nitrite is usually is found in trace amounts comparing with other forms of N that can appear in relatively high concentrations (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Norton and Stark, 2011, Dias et al., 2012). The maintenance of a low nitrite concentration in aerobic habitats is essential since nitrite is toxic to microorganisms, root plants and seeds (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Norton and Stark, 2011; Cleemput and Samater, 1996). So, a sequential and almost immediate nitrite oxidation to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) is fundamental in maintaining a low nitrite concentration. The sequential nitrite consumption and oxidation is possible since ammonia oxidation to nitrite is done at low rates, being considered the rate-limiting step of nitrification (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Norton and Stark, 2011; Fiencke et al. 2005).
high ammonia concentrations and in conditions with decreased or inhibited nitrite oxidation activity. Nitrite oxidising organisms (NOB) can be inhibited by high ammonia concentrations (Norton and Stark, 2011) or by nitrite, since high concentrations are toxic. Without nitrite oxidation by NOB, it becomes difficult to regenerate the low nitrite state of the ecosystem.
In anoxic conditions, nitrite accumulation can lead to nitric oxide and nitrous oxide production by heterotrophic bacteria denitrifcation, or by AOB denitrification.. It was though that these oxides were produced as intermediaries in ammonia oxidation (Cleemput and Samater, 1996; Bremner, 1997). However it is now known that AOB are capable producing these oxides by a denitrification process, with the reduction of nitrite by nitrite reductase (NIR) in anoxic conditions (Bremner, 1997; Burns et al. 1996), as seen in some species of AOB e.g. Nitrosomas eutropha and Nitrosomonas europaea (Yamanaka, 2008; Bock and Wagner, 2006; Hatzenpichler, 2012). The production of these oxides is problematic since both oxides form acids (nitrous acid and nitric acid) when interacting with water and may contribute to soil acidification and root damage (Fiencke et al., 2005). Nitrous oxide also acts like a greenhouse gas with a potential 310 times higher than carbon dioxide (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Fiencke et al., 2005).
Therefore regulation of nitrifying activity is essential to maintain the level of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate so that there is not a loss of fertility with low N quantities, nor a system eutrophication due to high N quantities.
As it is mentioned above the main factors that can regulate ammonia oxidation activity and AOM growth are substrate concentration (ammonia concentration), pH, presence of organic matter, oxygenation, water content, temperature and biotic regulation through plant-AOM interaction which can be by substrate competition with plants, or effect of plant exudates.
Mediterranean type ecosystem
This study focus on AOB and AOA communities found in Mediterranean-type ecosystem. Mediterranean ecosystem can be characterized by a highly seasonal climate with hot dry summers and mild wet winters. This asynchronous ecosystem with marked seasonal changes greatly influences the N fluxes. In summer when soils become water-limited the microbial activity, like decomposition and ammonia mineralization, tends to decrease, as should also occur to nitrification. The microbial activity should be being higher in spring or/and autumn due to the increase in water content (Ochua-Hueso et al. 2011; Dias et al. 2012). Concerning vegetation, the study site, in Serra da Arrábida was characterized as being a dense maquis with Cistus ladanifer as the dominant summer semi-deciduous plant (Dias et al. 2008). As for inorganic N content, it is known to vary greatly through the year, being lower in August and higher in November (Ochua-Hueso et al. 2011). Soil can be considered poor in N content, with the non-fertilized soils (without any N addition) having a very low quantity of inorganic N even in spring when soils have a greater nutrients turnover. It is an acidic soil with a pH of 5.8 ±0.2. (Dias et al. 2012). Microbial communities from these types of ecosystem should be adapted to low water content, climate changes, and low nutrient content. For microorganism adapted to low nutrient concentrations, as
the microbial communities found in Mediterranean soils, a nutrient input can cause abrupt and drastic alterations in community structure and activity.
Aims of this thesis
The work presented in this thesis aims to understand the ammonia oxidizing community in soils from a Mediterranean type ecosystem. The first objective was to know in which niche AOM community’s had a higher ammonia oxidation activity. Two niches were studied the root surface and rhizospheric soil of the most abundant plant species, Cistus ladanifer (Dias et al. 2008). After assessing the niche with the higher ammonia oxidation activity, the second objective was to compare the ammonia-oxidising communities from soils under nitrogen addition. The 3rd objective was to assess the effect of ammonia concentration, pH and presence of organic matter in AOB cultures.
Hypothesis:
In a poor nutrient ecosystem as the Mediterranean ecosystem, the preferential niche for the AOM growth and activity should be near the plant root, to have a higher nutrient exchange between the plant and AOM (Ochua-Hueso et al. 2011), besides giving conditions, as pH and oxygenation, favourable to AOM. Microsite in the surface of the root may have the environmental conditions to ammonia mineralization and production to occur, increasing the quantity of substrate for AOM in that area (Cleemput and Samater, 1996), while rhizospheric soil around the root may not have the same quantity of nutrients.
Bacterial or archaeal communities that are adapted to low nutrient conditions tend to suffer great changes with nutrient addition. Although some microbial groups have shown a higher degree of metabolic flexibility and physiological tolerance when changing the growth conditions this case is not seen for AOB communities, as rapid growth rates and high abundances are needed for the community’s strains to have that flexibility and adaptability (Allison et al. 2008).
Regarding the effect of N-addition in soils, the increase in ammonia-oxidation activity when the ecosystem has an increase in N quantity is excepted since it can be a strategies to counterbalance the nitrogen excess in the naturally low nutrient ecosystem. However, as AOM populations in poor nutrient soils may be adapted to oligotrophic environments, a change in the population structure may occur as adaptation to the higher N input.
As population adapted to low N content, the AOB population from soil without N addition are expected to be more susceptible to higher ammonia concentrations. Concerning pH it is described that AOB prefer pH basic to neutral (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Norton and Stark, 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012), however AOB population can have ammonia oxidation activity at a slightly acid pH (&gt;6,&amp;lt;7) (Hatzenpichler, 2012), so it is expected to have ammonia oxidation activity between pH 6.5 and pH 7.8. As the soils are poor in organic matter (Dias et al. 2012), AOM populations may prefer inorganic energy and carbon sources, though AOM can have a mixotrophic or even organotrophic growth.
Materials and Methods:
Study site
The present study was conducted at Serra da Arrábida in the Arrábida Natural Park, a Natura 2000 site in south of Lisbon, Portugal (PTCON0010 Arrábida/Espichel). The study site (38° 29' N - 9° 01' W) is located within a region belonging to the sub-humid thermo-mediterranean bioclimatic domain (Clemente 2002). According to the climatic normal (2012) in July, when the first soil collect was done, the mean maximum temperature was 28°C, mean minimum temperature was 15°C and mean precipitation was 1 mm. In October, the second soil collect was done, the mean maximum temperature was 22°C, mean minimum temperature was 14°C and mean precipitation was 50 mm. Reported data refer to the nearest climatic station (Setúbal, 15 km distance -Instituto Português do Mar e Atmosfera). The dominant plant species is Cistus ladanifer (Dias, 2008).
Experimental design
The experimental design was defined on the scope of FCT project “Spheres of ecosystem response to nitrogen: a case Study in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem in the southern of Portugal (SERN) PTDC/BIA BEC/099323/2008. It consists of 12 plots, of 400 m2 each. N availability was modified by the addition of 40 and 80 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the form of NH4NO3 (40AN and 80AN, respectively) and 40 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as a 1:1 mixture of NH4Cl-N and (NH4)2SO4-N (40A) (Fig.2). Each treatment had three replicates (3 plots). To prevent N ‘contamination' through runoff from fertilized plots, the experimental plots were distributed in three rows along the slope, with the controls (without fertilization) being located in the top row. The fertilization began in January 2007 and it is still being applied. Three equal applications have been applied throughout the year: middle autumn/winter, spring and summer.
Soil and Root sampling
The soil samples used for the study of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing
bacteria (AOB) preferential distribution were collected in July 2012. Three soil locations were randomly chosen in each control plot (C, F and E) (Fig. 3). None of the sample was taken from the modified plots. For each sample rhizospheric soil and roots were taken from seed germinated Cistus ladanifer plants at a depth of 5 - 6 cm. Samples were stored in clean plastic cups and refrigerated. In the laboratory, individual samples were immediately weighted and prepared for the

of 5 - 6 cm in each plot (Fig.3). Samples were maintained cold in clean plastic cups. A composite sample was obtained by homogenization of three samples from each of the three field replicate plots. 1 gram of soil from each composite sample was used as inoculum for the sequential enrichment cultures (AOB and AOA). A soil extract was prepared for each composite sample with 1 gram diluted in 10 ml of ultra-pure water for nitrite and ammonia quantification.
Ammonia oxidizing microorganism’s enrichments cultures
To compare the nitrifiying activity in Cistus ladanifer rhizospheric soil and roots three sequential enrichments cultures were prepared to allow a selection and subsequent increase of the ammonia oxidizing microorganism’s (AOM) population.
In the first enrichment 36 enrichment cultures were prepared: 18 cultures for AOB (9 for roots, 9 for rhizospheric soil) and 18 for Archaea (9 for roots, 9 for rhizospheric soil). Ammonia oxidizer Bacteria enrichment cultures were achieved in 25 mL McCartney flasks containing 20 mL of Fresh Synthetic Crenoarchaeota (SFC) with 1 mM of NH4Cl. 1 g of soil or roots were used to inoculate 20 ml of medium. SFC medium (Konneke et al. 2005; De La Torre et al. 2008) consistes of NaCl (1 g L-1), MgCl2-6H2O (0.4 g L-1), CaCh-2H2O (0.1 g L-1), KCl (0.5 g L-1), MgSO4.7H2O (5 g L-1) and KBr (0.1 g L-1). After sterilization in autoclave (121°C; 10min) the medium was supplemented with: per litter of medium, 1 mL of non-chelated trace element mixture, 1 mL of vitamin solution, 10 ml of KH2PO4 solution (4 g L-1), 1 ml of tungstate-selenite solution, 1 ml of sodium bicarbonate solution (1 M), and 1 ml of NH4Cl (1M). These solutions were prepared with distilled water and sterilized in autoclave (121° for 10 min) or by filtration (0.45 pm) for heat-sensitive compounds. The final pH is between 6.5 and 7. Ammonia oxidizer archaea (AOA) first enrichment cultures were prepared with streptomycin in a concentration of 2.5 pg ml-1. Cultures were incubated at 28°C without shaking during 30 and 60 days for AOB and AOA respectively. After the first enrichment stage, AOM cultures producing more than 1 mg/L NO2- (positive cultures) were subcultured into a second enrichment stage transferring 5% (v/v) inoculum to 20 mL SFC fresh medium supplemented with sodium chlorate (5 mg L-1). For the second enrichment for AOA streptomycin was replaced by ampicillin at 100 pg ml-1. AOM cultures that didn’t produce nitrites (negative cultures) or those producing less than 1 mg /L of nitrites were discarded. The third enrichment for AOB was obtained by transferring 5% (V/V) of inoculum into 20 ml of fresh SFC medium. For AOA cultures ampicillin was replaced by 0.05% chloramphenicol.
For the study of ammonia oxidizing communities in the non-fertilized and in fertilized plots, rhizospheric soil was used to inoculate 24 initial enrichment cultures: 12 initial cultures for AOB and 12 for AOA. 1 g of soil was used to inoculate 20 ml of SFC medium with 1 mM of NH4Cl, supplemented with Calcium Carbonate (7.5 gl-1), Pimaricine (0.04 gl-1), and sodium chlorate (5 mg l-1). The first enrichment for Archaea had ampicillin in a concentration of 100 pg/ml. For AOB the medium was not altered in the sequential enrichments. For AOA cultures streptomycin (100 pg ml-1) was added to the 2nd and Chloranphenicol 0.05% to the 3rd enrichments.
In every enrichment 5 % (v/v) of inoculum was transferred from both positive and negative cultures. Cultures were incubated at 28°C without shaking during 30 and 60 days for AOB and AOA respectively.
Ammonia susceptibility:
SFC medium was supplemented with 5mM of sodium chlorate, pimaricine (0.04 gL-1), calcium carbonate (7.5 gL-1) and different ammonia concentrations: 1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM and 500 mM. The medium was inoculated at 5 % with 2nd enrichment AOB community cultures. Cultures were incubated at 28°C during 15 days without shaking. Growth was indirectly estimated by assessing cultures activity by nitrite concentrations determinations at several timepoints by the Griess method.
pH susceptibility:
SFC medium was supplemented with 5mM of sodium chlorate, pimaricine (0.04 gL-1), calcium carbonate (7.5 gL-1) and 1Mof ammonia concentrations. pH was altered with 1M and 10M HCl and 1M NaOH to achieve pH 5.6, 6.7, 7.1 and 7.9. The medium was inoculated at 5 % V/V with 2nd enrichment AOB community cultures. Cultures were incubated at 28°C during 30 days without shaking. Growth was indirectly estimated by assessing cultures activity by nitrite concentrations determinations at several time-points by the Griess method.
Effect of organic compounds in AOB nitrite production
SFC medium was supplemented with 5mM of sodium chlorate, pimaricine (0.04 gL-1), calcium carbonate (7.5 gL-1) and different organic compounds: urea (46.8 mg/L), peptone (101 mg/L), sodium acetate (0.5 %) and glucose (0.5 %).Concentrations for urea and peptone were calculated to have the same amount of N as the control media (1M of NH4C, corresponding to 0.78 mM of N). Media with a combination of ammonia and urea or peptone was prepared with 0.5 M of ammonia chlorate and urea (mg/L) and peptone (mg/L). Media with sodium acetate or glucose had 1M of ammonia, but not sodium bicarbonate.The medium was inoculated at 5 % with 2nd enrichment AOB community cultures. Cultures were incubated at 28°C during 30 days without shaking. Growth was indirectly estimated by assessing cultures activity by nitrite concentrations determinations at several time-points by the Griess method.
AOM Indirect Growth Measurement
Switzerland). Nitrite standard curve was prepared using sodium nitrite solutions with concentrations ranging between 1-100 pM. Nitrite concentration of experimental samples were obtained from the resulting standard curve of nitrite concentration vs. absorbance.
The nitrite concentration through time was used to establish a nitrite production profile and typical parameters were determined. For the 1st enrichment, length of Lag phase, nitrite production rate, maximum nitrite concentration and area under the curve were used to compare the different cultures. For the 2nd and 3rd stages of enrichment, nitrite production rate and maximum nitrite concentration were used to compare ammonia oxidizing community’s cultures.
Lag phase was defined as the time segment between the beginning of incubation time and beginning of exponential nitrite production, expressed by days. Nitrite production rate was define at exponential phase with linear regression and was expressed as mg of nitrite produced per liter per incubation day (mg/L/d). Maximum nitrite concentration was determined as the highest nitrite concentration value after the 1st day of incubation, expressed as mg of nitrite per liter.
Additionally, ammonia concentration was determined in the end of each culture enrichment stage by the Berthelot reaction. 50 pl of each culture was first mixed with 50 pl of 5 % sodium citrate solution (pH 7). After 1 min of incubation at room temperature, 50 pl of 2-phenylphenol nitroprusside (PPS-nitroprusside) solution was added. Then 25 pl of hypoclorite buffer (pH 13) was added followed by 100 pl of deionized water. The microplate was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min before reading. The assays were conducted in a 96-well microplate and the absorbance was read at 660 nm in a spectrophotometric microplate reader (Tecan Spectra Rainbow Micrplate Reader 400-700nm, Switzerland). The PPS-nitroprusside solution was prepared with 3.22 g of 2-hydroxybiphenyl sodium salt tetrahydrate and 0.015 g of sodium nitroprusside dehydrate dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water. The buffer was prepared by dissolving 1 g of tri-sodium phosphate dodecahydrate in deionized water and 10 ml of sodium hypochlorite.
Subsequentially ammonia consumption (%) (equation 1) and nitrite production yield (%) (equation 2) were determined. The yield is calculated given in account the N weight, not the total molecule weight.

DNA extraction:
DNA was extracted from 10 - 15 ml of the enrichment cultures using a direct boiling method (Sambrook et al. 2001). The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove the medium precipitated CaCO2. The supernatant was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was ressuspended in TE buffer (pH 8) and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 5 min to wash the cells.

The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was ressuspend with TE supplemented with 0.1% tween. The samples were incubated at 100°C for 10 min.
PCR amplification
Each 50 pl PCR reaction contained: 0.2 pl (1 unit) BioTaq DNA Polymerase (Bioline, 500 units), 5 pl (1x) NH4+ Buffer (Bioline, 10X), 2 pl (2 mM) MgCl2 (Bioline, 50 mM), 1pl (0.2 mM each) dNTPs (10 mM each), 1 pl (50 pmol/pl) of each primer, and 2.5 pl of BSA (0.1 %). 1 pl of extracted DNA was used as template.
Thermal conditions for the bacterial 16S RNA PCR were as follows: 3 min initial denaturing step at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min denaturing at 94 °C, 2 min annealing at 50 °C and 1 min extension at 72 °C, with a final extension step of 3 min at 72 °C.
All PCR products were verified on 1 % agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide under UV light. Primers used for amplification, targets and positive controls are listed in table 1.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20 software for Windows. All data was checked for normality with the Levine's test. The coefficient variation (equation 3) was calculated as a normalized measure of dispersion for all the data. Linear data was checked for multiple comparisons of means with ANOVA at p&lt;0,05. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for non-linear data at p&lt;0,05. Rank transformation followed by a two-way ANOVA was performed for the AOB community's ammonia sensibility data, as described by Iman and Conover (1983).

Results and Discussion
Where does the Ammonia-oxidizing community prosper?
Cistus ladanifer as the most abundant plant species in the experimental study, was expected to have the highest influence on soil microbial community. So, the activity of ammonia oxidizing communities in Cistus ladanifer root surface and rhizospheric soil was assessed in order to understand in which of these niches presents a higher ammonia oxidation activity. As described in methods, 3 sequential enrichments were done. Active AOB and AOA cultures were defined as cultures with nitrite accumulation through time, where the maximum nitrite concentration is higher than the nitrite concentration found in lag phase.
Nitrite production by Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria
Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria growth is difficult to measure, so most of the studies are based on the activity, or nitrite production. With the nitrite measurement through the incubation time it is possible to have nitrite production curves to characterize that community.
In the rizospheric soil community 1st enrichment, nitrite accumulation can be seen during the beginning of incubation, 2 days for soil and root AOB cultures (fig.4 a and d), but decreases after that period of time. For soil AOB cultures nitrite starts to accumulate 7 days after the first decrease. Nitrite production recovery for root AOB cultures starts after 15 days of incubation. Both soil and roots AOB cultures had a 2nd decrease in nitrite concentration, more evident for root AOB cultures at 22 days of incubation (fig. 4 d) than soil AOB cultures at 13 days of incubation (fig.4 a). If in the cultures AOB where the only functional community active then the nitrite production from ammonia should be constant. However the community's nitrite production dynamics includes diauxic growth and the variations in nitrite concentration can be considered as a result of the culture dynamics, since the coefficient variation (CV) for Griess method is 0.1, lower than these variations.
The 1st enrichments are prepared from soil and roots, adding nutrients and organic compounds to the medium. Since the microbial inoculum corresponds to the community present in that soil and root surface, both AOM and other heterotrophic bacteria, capable of producing nitrite, are present in the culture. AOM have a slow growth and most AOB species need several days to weeks for growth, depending on the conditions such as substrate concentration, oxygen availability, the temperature and pH values (Bock and Wagner, 2006). Since heterotrophic bacteria tend to out-grow the AOM in selective media, using the soil inoculum nutrients, the observed diauxic growth can be explained by the change in nutrient source from the ones in the medium to the nutrients in soil and roots.
Concerning the studied nitrite production parameters: lag phase, time period, in days (d), between the beginning of incubation and beginning of exponential phase; nitrite production rate, mg of nitrite produced per day per liter of medium (mg/L/d), calculated in the exponential phase; and maximum nitrite concentrations (mg/L), the enrichment community cultures from both soil and roots AOB cultures presented a high heterogeneity (table. 2 in annex) for maximum nitrite concentration (1.04 and 1.46, respectively) and nitrite production rate (1.59 and 2.3). Lag phase for soil and root AOB culture present the lowest variation (0.26 and 0.32). Root AOB cultures had higher CV for the studied parameters compared to soil AOB cultures.
The 3 studied plots (plot C, E and F) from soils without N addition, are considered field replicates in the experimental design, however considering the natural heterogeneity found in soils (Ochua-Hueso et al. 2011), it is expected to have a higher heterogeneity between communities from the same plot and between communities between the 3 plots.
Comparing the maximum nitrite concentration produced by the AOB cultures in both niches (Table 2), soil AOB cultures had higher maximum nitrite concentrations (3.59 mg/L) than root surface AOB cultures (1.35 mg/L), though significant differences were not found (ANOVA p=0.95, table 3 in annex). Particularly, communities from plot C had the highest values (9.36 mg/L, 3.06 mg/L and 11.27 mg/L) in soil AOB cultures. In root surface AOB cultures, plot C also presents the highest values for maximum nitrite concentration (2.26 mg/L, 0.75 mg/L and 6.62 mg/L) (table 2). Soil communities also present higher nitrite production rates than root surface communities (0.46 mg/L/d and 0.15 mg/L/d, respectively) (table.2), though significant differences were not observed (ANOVA, p=0.95) (table. 3 in annex). The highest nitrite production rate was also observed for plot C in soil AOB cultures and root AOB cultures (table.2).Concerning lag phase, root AOB cultures had higher lag phases than soil AOB cultures (23.33 d and 16.67 d, respectively) (table 2), lag phase was significant different between the soil and root AOB cultures (sig of 0.049, ANOVA with p= 0.95) (table. 3 in annex).
before being used as energy source for heterotrophic bacteria. This could explain the higher lag phase in root community cultures, particularly in plot C communities.
To correctly compare the AOB community activity, cultures without growth of other microorganisms are needed. Therefore a 2nd enrichment was performed.
From 9 inital rhizospheric soil community cultures, 7 were considered active and used as inoculum for a 2nd serial enrichment. From root community cultures 3 were considered active and used to prepare the 2nd enrichment (table. 1 in annex).

In the 2° enrichment’s community’s cultures (fig. 4 b and e) constant nitrite production can be observed. No nitrite decrease is observed for the root or soil AOB cultures (fig. 4 b and e). The nitrite concentration decrease observed in the 1st enrichment indicated a growth of other microorganisms than AOB. With a serial transfer, nutrients and organic compounds found in the 1st enrichment were diluted, decreasing the growth of heterotrophic bacteria.
As nitrite-oxidizing bacteria could be one of the possible groups of bacteria existing in the inoculum, in the 2nd enrichment a nitratation (nitrite oxidation to nitrate) inhibitor, sodium chlorate, was added to the medium. Chlorate appears to affect specifically the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, and has little to none inhibitory effect on the growth and activity of ammonium oxidizers (Belser and Mays, 1980). With a nitratation inhibitor the rate at which nitrite accumulates will be the rate of ammonium oxidation (Norton and Stark, 2011), allowing a more correct determination of ammonia oxidation parameters: maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production rate.
maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production rate can be observed in plot C (27.98 mg/L and 2.39 mg/L/d), and the lowest values can also be observed in plot C (0.21 mg/L and 0 mg/L/d) (table. 3).
Lag phase was measured, but not analysed, since it depends on the activity level of the previous cultures when they were transferred, requiring a similar activity level to be comparable.
A higher homogeneity can be observed for the soil AOB cultures (CV of 0.2 for nitrite production rate and 0.08 for maximum nitrite concentration) in the 2nd enrichment, though root AOB cultures did not presented an increase in homogeneity (CV of 1.86 for nitrite production rate and 0.92 for maximum nitrite production) in this enrichment as did the soil AOB cultures.
As the serial transfer dilutes the microbial cells from previous cultures, the prevailing community in the following enrichments corresponds to the fast growing microorganism, capable of growing in the selective medium. So, only a portion of the AOB, with “fast” growth among other AOB, are being transferred to the following enrichment, explaining the homogeneity between communities from different plots in soil AOB cultures.
Root AOB cultures presented a culture without nitrite production activity, and one culture with low activity, explaining the high heterogeneity observed (table. 3).
Comparing soil AOB community culture parameters, maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production rate, for the values obtained in the 1st and 2° enrichment, an increase of the nitrite maximum concentration can be observed (table.2 and table. 3) by 7 fold, and an increase in nitrite production rate by 5 fold was observed (table 2 and 3).

Given the highest number of active cultures from rhizospheric soil (7 cultures) and root suface (2 cultures) (table. 1 in annex), it is though that the AOB community is more spread in rhizospheric soil and more disperse in root surface.
To confirmed these results, and confirmed that the nitrite is being produced by AOB and not by other bacteria another enrichment was implemented.
From the 2nd enrichment, positive cultures with nitrite production were transferred, 7 for soil AOB cultures and 2 for roots AOB cultures (table.1 in annex).
Observing the nitrite production curves for root and soil AOB cultures (fig. 4 c and f), both profiles seem similar though a high heterogeneity can be observed for soil AOB cultures.
Concerning maximum nitrite concentration the values are similar for root AOB cultures (28.28 mg/L) and soil AOB cultures (27.95 mg/L) (table. 4). Nitrite production rate is higher for root AOB cultures (2.37 mg/L/d), compared to soil AOB cultures (2.13 mg/L/d) (table.4).
Since both parameters are similar for root and soil AOB communities, the assessment of AOB preferential environmental niche was based on the number of active cultures from each niche. As it was mentioned before AOB community in rhizospheric soil is thought to be more spread than in root surface, where could be and more disperse. So, what differs between niches is the community abundance, being AOB communities more abundant in rhizospheric soil than root surface
Comparing 2nd and 3rd enrichment root AOB community it is possible to detect the differences in the analysed parameters (table 2 and 3). Nitrite production rate and maximum nitrite production was lower in the 3rd enrichment.
Soil AOB community presented similar results for nitrite production rate and maximum nitrite concentration in both enrichments. As the nitrite production dynamics were constant between enrichments, soil AOB cultures appeared to be free of contaminants.

Nitrite production by Archaea
As the nitrifying community composed by AOB, the presence and activity of AOA was also assessed.To study of archaeal ammonia oxidizing activity, growth inhibiton of AOB was necessary, since they can out-grow AOA. This was accomplished by adding antibiotics in the 3 enrichments preventing bacterial growth. Since the cellular targets for the antibiotics were different and the antibiotic was changed in each enrichment, occurrence of resistant strains was prevented.
concentration. Concerning the number of active cultures in the 2rd enrichment, 2 for root community and 2 for soil community were transferred to the 3rd.
Observing the culture's nitrite production through incubation time (Fig. 5), only soil AOA community culture presented nitrite production and accumulation.
A variation of nitrite concentration, with successive decrease and recovery can be observed for root and soil AOA cultures, mainly after 30 days of incubation.
Decrease in nitrite concentration should have been prevented by growth inhibition of nitrite consuming bacteria, or by the addition of sodium chlorate, a nitrite oxidation inhibitor (Belser and Mays, 1980). Interesting Treusch et al. (2005) found a gene encoding a homologue of a copperdependent nitrite reductase (NirK) in AOA. So some strains of AOA, like AOB may be able to consume nitrite in anoxic conditions. The decrease in nitrite can occur due to chemodenitrification, a nonenzymatically catalyzed reaction where nitrite self-decomposes in NO (nitric oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O (nitrous oxide) or N2 (dinitrogen) in acidic conditions (Bock and Wagner, 2006; Cleemput and Samater, 1996). Since ammonia oxidation acidifies the medium, chemodenitrification can explain the decrease in nitrite concentration.
Concerning nitrite production rate, due to the variation in nitrite concentration, it was not possible to calculate nitrite production rate for root AOA cultures and soil AOA culture from plant 3, plot C. The observed maximum nitrite concentration (table. 5) were very low, compared to the AOB communities (table. 4).
Though nitrite with a concentration above 0.1 mg/L can be considered nitrite production by the cultures, active cultures were defined as cultures with nitrite accumulation through time of incubation, therefore in the 3rd enrichment, only the AOA culture from soil was considered active (fig.5). As the active culture was found to be in soil, AOA communities could be more abundant and active in the rhizospheric soil. However archaeal 16S gene PCR amplification did not confirmed the presence of archaea (fig. 6) in root or soil community culture, since positive control has an amplicon with a molecular weight of 700 bp and the amplicons observed (fig.6 A and B)
rhizospheric soil; b) root surface

A higher archaea population abundance in root surface was expected, since archaea and particularly, Thaumarchaeota have been found to be more abundant in the root surface (Simon et al. 2005), especially in consortia with mycorrhiza (Timonen and Bomberg, 2009).
Ammonia oxidizing archaea cultivation is highly difficult compared to Bacterial cultivation and although enrichment of archaeal ammonia oxidizers from mesophilic aquatic environments appears to be relatively easy the same did not happen for AOA from terrestrial environments (Prosser and Nicol, 2008). Other incubations conditions and mediums must be developed.

How would the AOB population respond to an increase in N input?
Once the preferential niche for AOB and AOA was defined it was possible to select the samples to be used for the second task. Rhizospheric soil, having the highest ammonia oxidizing activity, should be used as inoculum to decrease the possibility of having false-negative results.
Ammonia oxidizing bacteria activity from fertilized and non-fertilized soil
In the 1st task, “Where does the ammonia oxidizing community prosper?” a heterogeneity between the plant's rhizosphere communities from the same plot and between plots of the same treatment was observed. So to have a higher representation of the nitrifying community 3 different communities were combined. Although the control plots (C, E and F) have different activity profiles, they represent the natural field heterogeneity.
In the 1st enrichment the 80A and 40A AOB cultures presented the highest maximum nitrite concentration (30.7 and 30.1 mg/L, respectively), the highest nitrite production rate (3.32 and 2.88 mg/L/d) and ammonia consumption (91.1% and 92.6%) (fig.7 a, b and c). The 40AN AOB cultures had the lowest values for maximum nitrite concentration (19.83 mg/L) and nitrite production rate (1.68 mg/L), ammonia consumption is higher than for control AOB cultures with 85.7% of consumption (fig.7 a, b and c). Control AOB cultures have a maximum nitrite concentration of 22.27 mg/L, a nitrite production rate of 1.97 mg/L/d and the lowest ammonia consumption with 72.5% (fig.7 a, b and c). No significant differences were observed parameters mentioned above, between the communities from the control soil and communities from altered soils (ANOVA, CI of 0.95 or 0.9) (table. 5 in annex). Concerning lag phase, control AOB cultures had the highest lag phase with 16.7 d. 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures had similar lag phases with 8.3, 7.7 and 7.7 d respectively. A significant difference can be observed for lag phase with CI of 0.9 (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.061). Regarding nitritation yield or nitrite production yield, 80 AN AOB culture had the highest yield (53.7 %), followed by the control AOB cultures (49.1 %), 40A AOB cultures (46.6%) and 40 AN AOB cultures had the lowest yield (39.7 %) (fig.7 d). No significant differences were found for nitrite production yield (ANOVA, CI of 0.95, p=0.9) (table. 5 in annex).
Observing the several studied parameters (fig.7 a, b, c, d), there appears to be a tendency for the control and 40AN AOB cultures to have a lower ammonia oxidation activity than 80 AN and 40A AOB cultures, though significant differences between control and altered soils AOB cultures weren't found. However, as explained in the 1st task, nitrite produced by AOB cultures in the 1st enrichment may not be resultant of ammonia oxidation, as the soil inoculum can have enough organic matter to allow the growth of nitrite-producing heterotrophic bacteria.
These results could indicate the outgrowth of heterotrophic bacteria as there is a lack of amplicons for amoA and the positive results for the amplification of the 16S gene. However it does not confirm the absence of AOB.
Specific functional groups like AOB appear difficult to study them even with molecular tools because some techniques may lack the required sensibility. For example, the detection threshold of some PCR conditions may not be enough to amplify the amoA gene in soils or culture.

A nested PCR approach of the amoCAB sequence can increase the sensitivity in samples with low abundances in AOB (Junier et al. 2010).
ln the 2nd enrichment the 40A AOB cultures had the highest value for ammonia consumption (78.2 %), maximum nitrite concentration (46.74 mg/L) and nitritation yield (97.7 %) (fig.7f, g, h, i). Nitrite production rate was identical (4.5 mg/L/d) for 40A and 40AN AOB cultures. 40AN had a maximum nitrite concentration of 42.3 mg/L and a nitritation yield of 72.3 %, higher than 80AN AOB culture with a maximum nitrite concentration of 39.5 mg/L and nitrite production yield of 68.6 %, though ammonia consumption was higher for 80AN AOB culture (77.9 %) than for 40AN culture (76.5%) (fig.7 f, g, h, i). 80 AN also had a nitrite production rate lower than 40A and 40AN (2.6 mg/L/d). The control AOB cultures had the lowest values for all of the studied parameters (fig.13). No significant differences between treatments were found (Kruskal-wallis and ANOVA Cl of 0.95, table. 5 in annex).
The 40A AOB culture was more homogeneous, having less variance in the studied parameters with a lower coefficient of variation (CV) than the 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures. Both cultures present very high CV for the studied parameters (table. 4 in annex).
ln the second enrichment there is a difference between the control AOB culture and the AOB from soils with different N-addition treatments. The nitrite maximum concentration, yield, ammonia consumption and nitrite production rate are higher in the 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures (fig.7 f, g, h, i). However the differences are not significant, probably due to the samples high heterogeneity.
From the 1st to the 2nd enrichment it is possible to observe a decrease of the maximum nitrite concentration, nitrite production rate, ammonia consumption (42.47%) and nitritation yield (18.83%) in the control culture. lf in the 1st enrichment nitrite production was mostly done by heterotrophic bacteria then it could be possible to explain the decrease in activity in the 2nd enrichment. By transferring and diluting organic matter, nutrients and bacterial cells in the culture the conditions are better for AOB activity than for heterotrophic bacteria, so activity decreases.
Amplification of amoA can be seen in plot A from 80AN AOB cultures (fig. 8 a), light bands can be observed for plots M from 80AN AOB cultures, for plot G from 40A AOB cultures and for plot l and K from 40AN AOB cultures. Amplicons have a molecular weight of around 500 bp, identical to the positive control.
Though positive amplification of amoA gene in the 1st enrichment was not observed, amoA amplification occur in the 2nd serial enrichment, confirming the presence of AOB and indicating cell growth of AOB in the cultures.

In the 3rd enrichment different nitrite production curves profiles (fig. 9) can be observed, suggesting different ammonia oxidation activities in the control, 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures. Concerning variability, AOB cultures from the 40A plot seem less heterogeneous, while the control and 40AN AOB cultures appear to have high variability. The number of “active” cultures, with nitrite production, could explain the variability since the 40A and 80AN AOB cultures had 3 active cultures (replicates), while the control and 40AN AOB cultures had 1 active culture each.
Regarding the maximum nitrite concentration in each treatment, (fig.7, j) the lowest concentration seems to be produced by the control AOB cultures (14.3 mg/L), followed by the 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures (21.2 and 42.3 mg/L, respectively). 40A treatment has the highest maximum nitrite concentration (59.3 mg/L). Significant differences for maximum nitrite concentrations between AOB cultures were found with a CI of 0.9 (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.063) (table. 5 in annex). Concerning variability in maximum nitrite concentration, the control and 40AN AOB cultures had the highest variation (CV of 138.7 and 123.1). High variability was expected, since both cultures had one active culture in the total of 3, high deviation is expected.
Nitrite production (nitritation) yield, nitrite production rate and ammonia consumption were higher in 40A AOB cultures (97.5%, 3.8 mg/L/d and 100%, repectively), followed by 80AN AOB cultures (72.1 % of yield, 3.5 mg/L/d of rate and 96.2% of ammonia consumption) (fig. 7 k, l). The control AOB cultures had the lowest maximum nitrite concentration (14.3 mg/L), nitrite production yield (24.1%) and ammonia consumption (94.3%), while 40AN AOB cultures had the lowest nitrite production rate (0.9 mg/L/d) (fig. 7 j, k, l, m). No significant differences were found for nitrite production rate, and ammonia concentration decrease (Kruskal-Wallis, CI of 0.95) (table. 5 in annex). Significant differences were found for nitrite production yield with a CI of 0.9 (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.09) (Table. 5 in annex).
Concerning variability, the control and 40AN AOB cultures had the highest CV for the studied parameters (table. 4 in annex), though for ammonia consumption, variability was low.
As the 3rd enrichment should have growth of AOB without the interference of heterotrophic bacteria growth, AOB culture activity for the treatments should present the effect of N-addition in the AOB. However the presence of heterotrophic growth should not be disregarded. The decrease in ammonia concentration in control and 40AN AOB cultures was similar to the decrease in ammonia concentration for 40A and 80AN AOB cultures, though nitrite production (rate and maximum concentration) is different. This observation can be explained by growth of microorganism other than AOB or by ammonia volatilization, though AOB growth was attained in a closed system with the possible minimal gas exchange.
Presence of AOB was confirmed by amplification of the amoA gene (fig.8 b). Amplicons with the same molecular weight as the positive control were seen for plot C from control AOB cultures, for plots H, L and G from 40A AOB cultures, for plot I from 40A AOB cultures and for plots M and A from 80AN AOB cultures.
Corresponding amoA amplification and AOB ammonia oxidation activity, it is possible to observe that cultures with nitrite production and accumulation through time also had a positive amoA amplification, e.g., in control AOB cultures, plot C had active AOB (fig.9 a) and AOB presence was confirmed (fig.8 b), while control AOB cultures from plot F and E did not had nitrite production (fig.9 a) and AOB was not detected by amoA amplification (fig.8 b). This correspondence between ammonia oxidation activity and presence of amoA was also observed for 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures.
Considering all the parameters, and confirmation of AOB presence by amoA amplification (fig.8 b), it is possible to hypnotize an alteration in the AOB community’s ammonia oxidation activity in response to the N-addition, though no significant differences between treatments were found, given the high heterogeneity. The highest ammonia oxidation activity was found in the 40AN AOB cultures and use of ammonia (decrease in ammonia) also appears to be induced in these cultures. 80AN AOB cultures also had a high ammonia oxidation activity, similar, but lower than the activity found for 40A AOB cultures. The control and 40AN AOB cultures had similar activities, as 40A AOB cultures had a high maximum nitrite concentration and yield and the control AOB cultures have a higher nitrite production rate. Considering just the nitrite production rate, control AOB cultures can be considered more active than 40A treatment AOB cultures.
Since the same amount of ammonia, but not the same form, is being added to the soils from 40A and 80AN treatments it could explain the similar ammonia oxidation activity for 40A and 80AN AOB cultures. 40A and 80AN treatments do differ regarding the variability, which could be an effect of the type of ammonia compound, though more studies are needed to study the effects of different ammonia compounds in AOB activity. Concerning the effects of N-addition in different forms and quantities of ammonia on AOB community structure, TGGE studies performed in scope of the SERN (Spheres of Ecosystem Response to Nitrogen (SERN): A case study in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem in southern Portugal) project (PTDC / BIA-BEC / 099323 / 2008), suggested that the community structure changes more according with the quantity of N and not
with the form of N (Cristina Cruz personal communication), and regarding ammonia oxidation activity, a similar activity is seen with the same quantity and different forms of ammonia.
As soils fertilized with the 40AN treatment have half of the amount of ammonia quantity comparing to 80AN, it was expected a lower ammonia oxidation activity for 40AN AOB cultures than for the 80AN AOB cultures but a higher activity for the 40AN AOB cultures than for control AOB cultures, however 40AN and control AOB cultures had a similar ammonia oxidation activity. Both 40AN and control AOB cultures had similar CV, indicating that addition of 40 kg of ammonia nitrate may not alter the activity of AOB.

AOB community structure assessed by PCR-RFLP
Ammonia oxidation activity among AOB cultures from non-fertilized and fertilized soils were different, as well as the susceptibility to ammonia. Therefore is was of interest to understand if these differences would also correspond to different community structures.
To assess the community structure possible changes, PCR-RFLP was performed. The amoA gene was amplified from DNA extracted from the 3rd enrichment AOB cultures, with primers amoA-1F and amoA-2R. The PCR products were used for restriction with 2 different enzymes, HaeIII and HinfI. The results for the PCR-RFLP are shown in fig.10. Both HaeIII and HinfI restriction enzymes originated 2 distinct patterns.
HaeIII hydrolysis of amoA amplified fragment presented 2 bands with a molecular weight of 167, 124 or 102 bp, while HinfI restriction had bands with a molecular weight of 537 and 494 bp. Four different patterns for HAE III and 4 patterns for HinfI were obtained (table.6).

Profile types were coded to allow an easier interpretation (table. 6). Cultures from the control plot C AOB enrichment showed an A1 profile. No other culture presented the same profile. 40 A treatment showed 3 different profiles (B2 in plot H, C3 in plot L and C2 in plot G), plot I from 40AN presented a C3 profile, identical to plot L from 40A treatment. 80AN presented a C4 and D2 of profile in plot N and A respectively. So with the exception of plot L (40A) and I (40AN) the enrichments present unique profiles and, consequently, community structures.
In addition, a possible identification of AOB species was performed. Each profile was compared to Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrosospira sp. profiles done in-silico with the sequences available in the GenBank database for p-Proteobacteria (fig. 1 and 2 in annex).
A correspondence with the AOB in-silico HaeIII profiles was found for Nitrosomonas nitrosa (150; 140; 120; 35 bp), Nitrosomonas aesturi (150; 175; 10; 45) and Nitrosospira tenuis (25; 146; 127; 116). Concerning HinfI restriction profiles, most PCR products were not hydrolysed band (537 bp). Patterns with a 537 bp and other molecular weight fragments could indicate the presence of more than 1 type of strain in the culture. A strain with a restriction site in the amplified amoA fragment and another without that region. This was expected since the culture correspond to a population and not pure strains.
A correspondence with the AOB in-silico profiles was found for Nitrosospira tenuis in the PCR-RFLP profiles from plot H and plot L (40A), plot K (40AN) and plot A (80AN). The presence of this species of Nitrosospira is also in concordance with pyrosequecing data. Nitrosospira sp. But not Nitrosomonas sp. was found in rhizospheric soil of Cistus ladanifer (data from the project In-Nitro: conceptualizing the effects of increased nitrogen availability in a Mediterranean ecosystem - PTDC/BIA-ECS/122214/2010).
the apparent lower activity of 40AN AOB community can be due to the quick Ammonia-Nitrate use by plants. Because the fertilization causes an increase in plant growth (Dias et al. 2011) AOB communities in this treatment can have less substrate available than in control without N addition since plants may have a higher demand for nutrients, and AOB, being bad competitors for ammonium, may have less substrate available than in control without N addition (Verhagen et al. 1994). As, since 2007 N addition has been done AOB communities in 40AN could have been altered to have less activity, less nutrient demand, and with a higher ammonia affinity.
Contrary to that happens in 40AN treatments, 40A treatments shows less plant coverage, having more bare soil (Dias et al. 2011), therefore the AOB communities have more available ammonia than communities in soils with a higher plant coverage. However AOB may not be abundant in bare soil. Delgado-Baquerizo et al. (2013) have shown that, in Mediterranean ecosystems, with limiting nutrients, AOB amoA genes are more abundant in rhizospheric soil under the influence of Stipa tenacissima, while AOA amoA genes are more abundant in bare soil. However in Mediterranean environments with N addition an increase in plant growth can lead to a stronger competition for ammonia, inhibiting an ammonia oxidation increase.
Many studies show that AOB growth and activity normally benefits from an increase in nitrogen addition to the soil (He et al. 2012; Allison et al. 2008; Mendum et al. 1999).
Ammonia oxidizing archaea activity in fertilized and non-fertilized soils
As it was mentioned in the 1st task, AOA activity analysis can only be done in the 3rd enrichment to ensure the absence of AOB presence and activity. Since confirmation of presence and activity of AOA was not possible, the cultures are referred to “AOA” as possible AOA culture.
Concerning the nitrite production curves, a similar profiles could be observed (Fig. 11). The “AOA” cultures presented 2 exponential phases with a decrease in the nitrite concentration between the phases. Since there is not a constant nitrite production through the incubation time, nitrite production rate was not possible to calculate. Control and 40A “AOA” cultures appear to have a nitrite concentration peak at 30 days and 50 days of incubation, while 40A and 80AN “AOA” cultures have a nitrite concentration peak at 35 and 52 days of incubation.
Regarding maximum nitrite production and nitritation (nitrite production) yield (fig.12) 40AN “AOA” cultures had higher values (0.96 mg/L and 1.7%, respectively), followed by control “AOA” cultures (0.73 mg/L and 1.2%), 80AN “AOA” cultures (0.32 mg/L and 0.6%), 40A “AOA” cultures had the lowest maximum nitrite production and nitritation yield (0.18 mg/L and 0.3%) (fig.19). No significant differences were found between treatments for maximum nitrite concentration, nitrite production yield and ammonia decrease (Kruskal-Wallis, CI=0.95) (table. 5 in annex).

Concerning the previous enrichments for these cultures, in the 1st enrichment, maximum nitrite concentration of “AOA” cultures was similar to the 1st enrichment “AOB” cultures maximum nitrite concentration, though nitrite production rate was lower in “AOA” cultures than “AOB” cultures (data not shown). So the 1st antibiotic used had an effect on nitrite production rate. The activity of the “AOA” cultures decreased with each serial enrichment, being lower in the 3rd and last enrichment. So “AOA” ammonia oxidation activity analysis should and were performed at the 3rd enrichment.
These results are reverse to those found for AOB. For “AOA” a higher activity is found in 40AN treatment followed by control, 80AN and finally 40A with the lowest “AOA” activity.
The fact that the nitrite production activity for “AOA” is higher in the treatments where AOB activity is lower can be explained by the AOA higher ammonia affinity. So under limiting ammonium concentrations AOA activity is favoured therefore having a more important role in nitrification than AOB (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009). Although in some cases AOA can outgrow AOB, this appears to not be applicable in this
case study. Although nitrite production is higher in control and 40AN treatment, the AOB activity in these treatment is still higher than “AOA”.
Although AOB nitrite production is higher in 40A and 80AN treatments and “AOA” nitrite production is higher in control and 40AN “AOA” treatments, the ammonia oxidation and nitrite production attributed to AOB is higher than the nitrite production attributed to AOA. Thus, in soil and under these incubation conditions, both AOM coexist in the environment, being the observed differences due to AOA slower growth rate (Prosser and Nicol, 2008). The lower ammonia oxidation, and consequently, nitrite production in the enrichment cultures can, then be explained by the lower number of cells in the soil population.
Additionally, considering that AOA uses, preferentially, mineralized ammonia (urea) and organic nitrogen source (amino acids) (He et al. 2012; Tourna et al. 2011; Hatzenpichler, 2012), then growth and activity in a medium with ammonia as nitrogen and energy source may not be the best to ensure a high nitrite production by AOA. So optimal conditions for these cultures should be studied to understand which ammonia oxidizing group of organisms has the greatest importance in the control and 40AN treatment.
The presence of Archaea was monitored in the 3 enrichments, amoA archaeal gene presence was confirmed for cultures with confirmed archaea presence.
In the 1st enrichment, amplification of the 16S gene was negative (data not shown). In the 2nd enrichment bands of the same molecular weight as the positive control were observed in the M, B, and K plots (80AN and 40AN treatments) (data not shown), amplicons of other molecular weights were also observed.
In the amplification results of the archaeal 16S gene for the 3rd enrichments (fig 13), amplicons with several molecular weights can be observed. For the control “AOA” cultures, plots F and E, bands with around 200 bp can be observed. For 40A “AOA” cultures, bands with around 600 bp can be observed in plots L and G. The plots K and I from 40AN “AOA” cultures present bands with around 600 bp, 500 bp and 300 bp. 80AN “AOA” cultures had bands with around 800 bp, 600 bp and 1000 bp for plots N and M.
However most of those appears to be unspecific amplifications, since the molecular weight of the amplicon doesn't correspond to the positive control. The presence of amoA gene was studied in the cultures with bands with a correct molecular weight (600 bp). No positive amplification occur for the amoA gene (data not shown).

Although it was not possible to amplify archaeal amoA gene, nitrite production can be detected, thus the lack of amplification of amoA gene can be due to low cell density. More enrichments or time in each enrichment could increase AOA cell density and enable amplification.
AOA community are more sensible to N adittion and normally prosper in oligotrophic environments with low nutrient concentration (Hatzenpichler et al. 2006).
How does the AOB population responds to abiotic factors?
AOB susceptibility to ammonia
AOB species can be characterized by their ammonia tolerance. Nitrosomonas europaea can growth with an ammonia concentration up to 500 mM. However other strains can grow with concentrations below 50mM. In community the response to high ammonia concentrations can be different. Some communities can grow with concentrations as high as 1000mM (Spieck and Bock, 2005; Hatzenpichler, 2012). So depending on the community susceptibility to ammonia it will more susceptible to change activity when confronted by a change in substrate. However in soils with N-addition, when ammonia is frequently added to soil, it is expected for the AOB populations to be altered and have a higher ammonia tolerance.
Concerning the three nitrite production parameters, maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production rate for the control, 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures incubated with different concentrations of ammonia (fig.14) a similar pattern of response can be observed with the increase of the ammonia concentration. With 1 mM of ammonia, the control ammonia concentration, 40A AOB cultures had the highest maximum nitrite concentration (36.7 mg/L) and nitrite production rate (4.3 mg/L/d), followed by 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures that had similar results, while the control had the lowest values for the parameters (fig.14). The added10 mM of ammonia to the medium increased the nitrite production rate and maximum nitrite concentration of the AOB cultures (fig.14). 40A AOB cultures had the highest parameter values (42.1 mg/L and 6.02 mg/L/d) between treatments with this ammonia concentration, followed by 40AN, 80AN and control (12.8 mg/L and 2.3 mg/L/d) AOB cultures (fig.14). With 50 mM of ammonia, an increase of maximum nitrite concentration can be observed for 40A, with the highest value followed by 40AN and 80AN (51.1 mg/L, 42.4 mg/L and 23.1 mg/L, respectively), control AOB cultures had a decrease in maximum nitrite concentration (1.7 mg/L). A decrease in nitrite production rate can be observed for the AOB cultures. The 40A AOB cultures with the highest rate (5.4 mg/L/d) followed by 40AN (3.4 mg/L/d), 80AN (2.5 mg/L/d) and control (0.17 mg/L/d) (fig.14). Concerning the effect of adding 100 mM of ammonia in the medium a decrease in maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production rate can be observed, with the exception of an increase in nitrite production rate 40AN AOB cultures (3.8 mg/L/d). The 40AN AOB cultures presented the highest maximum nitrite concentration (32.8 mg/L) and rate, followed by 40A (20.6 mg/L and 2.1 mg/L/d, respectively), 80AN AOB cultures (5.8 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L/d). Control AOB cultures had the lowest vales for the studied parameters (0.3 mg/L and 0 mg/L/d) (fig. 14). With 500 mM of ammonia, nitrite production rate of AOB cultures was not possible to calculate, since nitrite
accumulation through time did not occur. No significant difference was found between treatments and ammonia concentration (2-way ANOVA, Cl=0.95) (see table. 6 in annex).
Control AOB cultures had the highest maximum nitrite concentration and nitrite production
Fig.14 Nitrite production parameters of the control, 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures in relation with different ammonia concentration in the medium(1 mM, 10 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM and 500 mM): a) nitrite production rate; b) maximum nitrite concentration. Standard deviation is represented as error bars.

rate with 10 mM of ammonia, indicating an optimal ammonia concentration for ammonia oxidation activity of 10 mM, having an activity decrease with 50 mM.
The 40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures had the highest maximum nitrite concentration with 50mM of ammonia and highest nitrite production rate with 10 mM of ammonia with 1 mM of ammonia. 40A and 80AN AOB cultures start to have an ammonia oxidation activity decrease with 100 mM of ammonia, while 40AN AOB cultures had a similar rate and maximum nitrite concentration with 10 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM, with and activity decrease with 500 mM of ammonia.
So AOB cultures from soils with different N-addition treatments appear to have a distinct ammonia tolerance. Control AOB cultures are the most susceptible to ammonia,
being inhibit with 50mM of ammonia. 40A and 80AN treatments have higher tolerance, being inhibit with 100mM of ammonia. 40AN treatment, though it has a lower activity at standard conditions (1mM) than 40A and 80AN, it shows a higher ammonia tolerance, still having a high activity at 100mM. More ammonia concentrations should be tested to fill the gap between 100mM and 500mM and to know the inhibitory concentration of ammonia for the 40AN treatment.
AOB susceptibility to pH changes
the response of AOB populations to pH changes depends on their capacity to adapt to the change, and while some species are more tolerant, others are more susceptible and have a limited pH range in which they are active.
40A, 40AN and 80AN AOB cultures in relation with different pH in the medium (5.6, 6.6, 7.1 and 7.9): a) maximum nitrite; b) nitrite production rate concentration. Standard deviation is represented as error bars.
Fig. 15 Nitrite production parameters of the control,
Concerning the effect of pH on AOB activity it is possible to observe that AOB cultures incubated in media with pH 6.6 had the highest activity (fig.15). With pH 5.6 only the AOB cultures from the 40A soil
treatment present activity, with a nitrite production rate of 0.362 mg nitrite /L /d (fig. 15 b), and the concentration of
highest maximum nitrite
2.603 mg/L. Though a concentration can be

other AOB cultures, through time shows being possible to

determine nitrite production rate since nitrite accumulation is not observed.
With pH 6.6, as the control pH, it is possible to observe the same pattern of activity with AOB soils from 40A and 80AN treatment having the highest rate and maximum nitrite concentration as it is
observed before. With pH 7.1 AOB cultures from 80AN has the highest nitrite production rate (1.243 mg nitrite /L /d), followed by AOB cultures from the control (0.146 mg nitrite /L /d) and AOB cultures from 40AN (0.042 mg nitrite /L /d). With pH 7.9 none of the AOB cultures are considered active, though maximum nitrite concentration was determined.
So pH changes have different impact on the AOB cultures, depending on their adaptation to increased N input in the ecosystem. AOB cultures adapted to N input of just ammonia (40A) appear to be more active at slightly acidic pH (&gt;5.6, &amp;lt;7.1), having the activity inhibit at neutral to basic pH. While AOB cultures adapted to N input of ammonia - nitrate tend to be active at pH &gt; 6.6 and pH &amp;lt;7.9. AOB cultures from soils without N have the same response pattern to pH as AOB cultures from 40AN treatment, with a total activity inhibition at pH &amp;lt;6.6, and lower activity at pH 7.1. So AOB cultures from control and 40AN appear to more susceptible to pH change both with the decrease or increase of pH, while AOB cultures from 80AN is more susceptible to pH decrease and AOB cultures from 40A are more susceptible to pH increase.
to the exponential decrease in NH3 availability. However ammonia oxidation activity under acidic conditions might be possible through ureolytic activity, aggregate formation, or by biofilm formation (Bock and Wagner, 2006). Some AOB species, encoding ureases enzymes, are capable of using urea and catalyse the formation of NH3 and CO2 intracellularly, having a source of substrate for ammonia oxidation activity (Norton and Stark, 2011; Bock and Wagner, 2006), and possible regulating the pH in the surrounding area of the cell (Hatzenpichler, 2012).
Biofilms and aggregate formation allow the population to create a more beneficial environment and regulate pH, substrate concentration and other factors than may alter AOB activity, giving the population a higher resistance to change.
Effect of organic compounds in AOB nitrite production
To assess the response of the AOB community from soils without N addition to the presence of organic compounds, urea, peptone, glucose and acetate were used to supplement the media. Urea and peptone can be used as energy sources in litotrophic growth (with nitrite production), in mixotrophic or organotrophic growth (lower to none nitrite production). Glucose and acetate can be used as carbon sources in mixotrophic growth (with nitrite production) with ammonia as energy source (electron donor). Control media had ammonia as energy source and sodium bicarbonate as carbon source. In media supplemented with acetate and glucose (carbon source), sodium bicarbonate was not added. While media supplemented with urea or peptone had sodium bicarbonate as carbon source.
Concerning the AOB population activity, nitrite production was observed in cultures supplemented with just urea and with a combination of urea and ammonia, though AOB cultures with a combination of N compounds tend to have lower nitrite production (fig.16 a). However in AOB cultures incubated in a media supplemented with peptone, a combination of peptone and ammonia, acetate or glucose, nitrite production was not observed (fig. 16 b, c).
Regarding nitrite production rate, AOB cultures incubated with media supplemented with just ammonia had similar rates as the AOB cultures incubated in control medium (1.68 and 1.69 mg nitrite /L /d), while in a media supplemented with both ammonia and urea the AOB nitrite production rate was lower (1.17 mg nitrite /L /d) (Fig. 17 a). For AOB cultures incubated with peptone, peptone with ammonia, acetate or glucose, nitrite production rate was low (0.02, 0.03, 0 and 0.01 mg nitrite /L /d) (fig. 17 b), therefore the cultures were considered non-active. Maximum nitrite concentration was higher in the control AOB cultures (14.32 mg/L), followed by AOB cultures in media supplemented with urea (9.2 mg/L), and AOB cultures in media with urea and ammonia (5.95 mg/L). Though activities tend to be different according to the nitrogen compound, no significant differences were found (Kruskal-Wallis, p of 0.95 table. 7 in annex). Amplification of amoA was performed to confirm the presence of AOB, as addition of organic compounds will increase the growth of heterotrophic bacteria than might still be in the inoculum. Positive amplification for amoA was observed in the AOB cultures in media supplemented with just urea and urea with ammonia (fig.18).
Fig. 17 Effect of organic compounds in nitrite production parameters for AOB cultures from soils without N addition, incubated in media with: a) effect of N organic compounds in maximum nitrite concentration; b) effect of N nitrite in production rate; c) effect of C organic compounds in maximum nitrite concentration; d) effect of C organic compounds in nitrite production rate Standard deviation is represented as error bars.
activity, supplementing peptone in the incubation medium seem to inhibit nitrite production. Mixotrophic growth and activity can occur in Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, with ammonia as energy source and organic compound as carbon source, chemoorganotrophic growth with acetate or pyruvate as electron donor was also described for AOB (Bock and Wagner, 2006). However none of the cases were observed, since the cultures were not active and amoA amplification had negative results (no amplification or non-specific amplification) (fig.18).
Thus, AOB populations from soils without N addition appear to be able to use urea, but are susceptible to the presence of peptones, glucose and acetate. The susceptibility of AOB populations from soils with N addition should be studied, as more organic compounds should be tested.

E, F and C correspond to the plots from which soil AOB cultures were collected. Samples outlined by green had positive amplification for amoA, red outline indicates non-specific amplification. Positive control has a blue outline.
Conclusions
Considering the influence of factors such as niche, N concentration in soils, ammonia concentration, pH and presence of organic matter in AOB population activity, it is possible to say that this population are not resistant to change and responsive to changes. Therefore changes in the environmental conditions can alter the nitrification rate and possibly the N flux in the ecosystem. The susceptibility of AOB population to environmental factors may represent a fine tuned mechanism of control necessary to guaranty the balance of N in the ecosystem.
to the acid pH, as it is seen for the AOB culture from the 40A treatment. Consequently changes in pH may represent a transient mechanism to regulate the AOB activity. Nitrogen addition to the soil is known to increase the ecosystem productivity, leading to an increase in the concentration of organic compounds, which can inhibit the ammonia oxidation rate. Therefore another possibility of nitrification control is through negative feedback by the increase of organic compounds.
Though nitrification appears to be a highly controlled process, the AOB population can be altered in a way that the activity may not be easily regulated.
