New species of Scleromystax Günther, 1864 (Siluriformes: 
Callichthyidae) - extending the meridional distribution of 

genera endemic to the Atlantic Forest

Marcelo R. Britto1, Clayton K. Fukakusa2 and Luiz R. Malabarba2

The genus Scleromystax includes species occurring in several coastal river basins from southern Bahia to southern Santa 
Catarina States. Examination of Scleromystax specimens sampled from the laguna dos Patos drainage revealed a new taxon, 
further extending the distribution of the genus to the southern border of the Atlantic forest. The new species differs from its 
congeners by the second infraorbital ventrally expanded. It is also distinct, except from S. macropterus and S. salmacis, by 
roughly oblique, elongate, dark brown blotches along body; large specimens displaying cranial fontanel completely occluded, 
leaving just a shallow fossae; and sexually dimorphic features inconspicuous, i.e. preopercular (cheek) region similar in 
males and females, and dorsal and pectoral fins of males slightly longer than in females. Herein, we also extend the record of 
Scleromystax salmacis to the rio Tramandaí drainage.

O gênero Scleromystax inclui espécies distribuídas nas diversas bacias hidrográficas costeiras entre o sul do Estado da Bahia e 
o sul do Estado de Santa Catarina. O exame de exemplares de Scleromystax coletados nos sistema da laguna dos Patos revelou 
um novo táxon, estendendo a distribuição do gênero para o limite austral da Mata Atlântica. A nova espécie difere de seus 
congêneres pelo segundo infraorbital expandido ventralmente. Também se distingue, exceto de S. macropterus e S. salmacis, 
por manchas castanho-escuras alongadas e oblíquas ao longo do corpo; espécimes grandes apresentando a fontanela craniana 
completamente oclusa, restando somente uma depressão superficial; e características de dimorfismo sexual inconspícuas, i.e. 
região pré-opercular semelhante em machos e fêmeas, e nadadeiras dorsal e peitoral dos machos sutilmente mais longa que 
das fêmeas. No presente estudo, o registro de S. salmacis é estendido até a drenagem do rio Tramandaí.

Introduction

The fish fauna from the coastal river drainages in 
Brazil shows a high endemism (Vari, 1988; Weitzman et 
al., 1988; Bizerril, 1994; Buckup, 2011), not only in species 
composition, but also observable at the level of genera. 
Some genera (Deuterodon Eigenmann, Hollandichthys 
Eigenmann, Listrura de Pinna and Scleromystax) have 
their species distribution fully contained in the Atlantic 
Forest Biome, that extends from near Porto Alegre, Rio 
Grande do Sul State, to near Natal, Rio Grande do Norte 
State, and are found inhabiting rivers and creeks running 
through forested areas (Menezes et al., 2007).

Until recently, only the genus Deuterodon was known 
to occur in the southern limit of the Atlantic Forest in 
the rio Maquiné, rio Tramandaí drainage (Gomes, 1947), 
but in the last few years the three other genera have had 

their southern distributional limits extended farther south 
through the description of recently discovered populations 
of new species. These records includes the description of 
a new species of Scleromystax from the rio Mampituba 
drainage (Britto &amp;amp; Reis, 2005), a new Hollandichthys 
from the rio Maquiné, rio Tramandaí drainage (Bertaco 
&amp;amp; Malabarba, 2013), and a new Listrura from the laguna 
dos Patos drainage (Villa-Verde et al., 2013). In all these 
cases, these peripheral populations seems to be small and 
hardly represented in collections, when compared to the 
species of those genera found in the central areas of the 
Atlantic forest.

We herein extend the record of Scleromystax salmacis 
Britto &amp;amp; Reis to the rio Tramandaí drainage and describe 
a new species of Scleromystax from the laguna dos Patos 
drainage, further extending the distribution of the genus to 
the southern border of the Atlantic forest.

Material and Methods

Morphometric and meristic data were taken following 
Reis (1997) and Britto &amp;amp; Reis (2005). Measurements were 
obtained with calipers to 0.1 mm. Teeth and vertebral 
counts were taken from cleared-and-stained (cs) specimens, 
prepared according to Taylor &amp;amp; Van Dyke (1985). In the 
description, values for the holotype are marked with an 
asterisk. Nomenclature of latero-sensory canals follows 
Schaefer &amp;amp; Aquino (2000), and that of preopercular pores 
follows Schaefer (1988). Osteological terminology follows 
Reis (1998), except for the use of parieto-supraoccipital 
instead of supraoccipital (Arratia &amp;amp; Gayet, 1995), 
compound pterotic instead of pterotic-supracleithrum 
(Aquino &amp;amp; Schaefer, 2002), and scapulocoracoid instead 
of coracoid (Lundberg, 1970), as adopted in Britto &amp;amp; Lima 
(2003). Homologies of barbels follow Britto &amp;amp; Lima (2003). 
Institutional abbreviations are according to Reis et al. 
(2003).

In order to investigate the phylogenetic affinities of the 
new taxa, a parsimony analysis was performed using the 
morphological character data matrix published by Britto 
(2003), but restricted to Scleromystax species and a selected 
outgroup (Callichthys callichthys (Linnaeus), Aspidoras 
albater Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker, Corydoras difluviatilis Britto 
&amp;amp; Castro and C. aurofrenatus Eigenmann &amp;amp; Kennedy), 
including just the characters that vary among this sample 
(46 characters: 2, 6, 7, 15-30, 32-34, 37-40, 42, 43, 45-50, 
52, 54, 56, 60, 62, 65, 66, 68, 72, 80-82), with the same 
codification. The analysis was performed using the T.N.T. 
software (Goloboff et al., 2008) via a traditional heuristic 
search performed using the stepwise addition algorithm 
associated with tree bisection reconnection in a total 
amount of 10.000 samples. Attributes of connectivity and 
ambiguity among character-states were treated in the same 
way as in Britto (2003).

Diagnosis. Scleromystax reisi differs from its congeners by 
infraorbital 2 expanded ventrally, adjacent to small, almost 
imperceptible, naked area between sphenotic, compound 
pterotic, opercle and preopercle (vs. infraorbital 2 narrow, 
leaving a somewhat large area between those bones). 
The new taxon is also distinct from its congeners, except 
Scleromystax macropterus (Regan) and S. salmacis, by 
roughly oblique, elongate, dark brown blotches along body 
(vs. large, dark brown blotches, often coalesced, mainly 
on almost all dorsolateral body plates, in S. barbatus; or 
ground color yellowish white, with a dark brown stripe 
along junctions of dorso- and ventrolateral body plates, in 
S. prionotos (Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker)). It is also distinguished, 
except from S. macropterus, by large specimens displaying 
cranial fontanel completely occluded, leaving just a 
shallow fossae, delimited by frontal bones, and reaching 
anterior tip of parieto-supraoccipital (vs. wide or narrow

fontanel between frontals). Scleromystax reisi differs 
from S. macropterus mainly by the absence of a black 
dot on the base of median caudal-fin rays (vs. presence), 
and sexually dimorphic features inconspicuous, i.e. cheek 
region similar in males and females, with only minute, 
scattered odontodes in the former (vs. males with developed 

odontodes inserted in fleshy papillae), dorsal and pectoral 
fins of males slightly longer than in females (vs. dorsal and 
pectoral fins of males 2-3 times longer than those fins in 
females). It is also distinguished from S. salmacis by the 
tip of snout roughly truncate (vs. slightly continuous and 
smoothly tapered).

Description. Morphometric data presented in Table 1. 
Head compressed with slightly convex dorsal profile until 
posterior tip of parieto-supraoccipital process; roughly 
triangular in dorsal view. Snout straight and relatively blunt, 
roughly truncate (Fig. 2). Profile slightly convex along 
dorsal-fin base. Postdorsal-fin body profile nearly straight 
to first preadipose unpaired platelet; slightly convex along 
preadipose platelets and base of adipose-fin spine. Ventral 
profile nearly straight from isthmus to anal-fin origin, with 
pronounced convexity just anterior to pelvic fins. Profile 
markedly concave from first anal-fin ray to caudal-fin base. 
Body roughly elliptical in cross section at pectoral girdle, 
gradually becoming more compressed toward caudal fin.

Eye round, located dorso-laterally on head; orbit 
delimited dorsally by frontal and sphenotic, ventrally by 
infraorbitals. Anterior and posterior nares close to each 
other, only separated by flap of skin. Anterior naris tubular. 
Posterior naris close to anterodorsal margin of orbit, 
separated from it by distance equal to diameter of naris. 
Mouth small, subterminal, width slightly larger than bony 
orbit diameter. Maxillary barbel reaching anteroventral 
limit of gill membrane in some individuals. Maxillary barbel 
slightly longer than outer mental barbel, with nearly same 
length. One specimen (UFRGS 8754, 49.9 mm SL) only 
with outer mental barbel. Inner mental barbel fleshy, nearly 
one-third of outer mental barbel length. Small rounded 
papillae covering entire surface of all barbels, upper and 

lower lips, and isthmus; more evident on lips and barbels. 
Minute odontode-bearing platelets scattered on ventral 
surface, between pectoral and pelvic girdles. Side of snout 
(cheek, preopercular region just below first infraorbital) 
conspicuously fleshy; males with several minute, scattered 
odontodes somewhat larger than those ones over body. Gill 
membranes united to isthmus. Four branchiostegal rays 
covered by thick layer of skin; distal two rays united at their 
tips by branchiostegal cartilage. Teeth on upper pharyngeal 
tooth plate 32, roughly arranged in two rows, and on fifth 
ceratobranchial 27, restricted to one row at mesial margin.

Sphenotic, parieto-supraoccipital, and frontal bones 
visible externally, all covered by thin layer of skin and 
bearing minute scattered odontodes. Cranial fontanel 
completely occluded in large specimens (Fig. 3), leaving 
shallow fossae, covered by thin skin, delimited by frontal 
bones, and reaching anterior tip of parieto-supraoccipital; 
small specimens (up to 38.3 mm SL) with opened fontanel 
restricted to region between frontal bones. Sphenotic 
trapezoid in shape, contacting parieto-supraoccipital 
dorsally, compound pterotic posteriorly, and second 
infraorbital ventrally. Parieto-supraoccipital quadrangular 
with posterior expansion triangular and elongate, but not 
reaching nuchal plate, leaving naked area with scattered, 
minute odontode-bearing platelets. Unpaired odontode-
bearing platelets between parieto-supraoccipital posterior 
process and nuchal plate.

SL (b; modified from Britto &amp;amp; Reis, 2005: fig. 1).

Two infraorbital bones, externally visible, covered by 
thin layer of skin; both bearing few minute odontodes. 
First infraorbital with anterior expansion just surpassing 
vertical through anterior naris. Second infraorbital 
expanded ventrally, leaving small, almost absent, naked 
area between sphenotic, compound pterotic, opercle and 
preopercle (Fig. 4). Opercle exposed, ovoid in shape 
and roughly elongate, with free border variably smooth 

or angulated. Preopercle externally visible, slender and 
covered by thin layer of skin. Opercle and preopercle with 
minute odontodes scattered over their surfaces.

Trunk lateral-line composed of one perforated 
dorsolateral-body plate and two laterosensory canals, 
reduced to small ossicles. Lateral-line canal entering 
neurocranium through compound pterotic, splitting 
into three branches before entering sphenotic: pterotic, 
preoperculomandibular, and posterolateral, each with 
single pore. Posterolateral branch opened in compound 
pterotic itself, just above upper margin of opercle. 
Sensory canal continuing through compound pterotic, 
entering sphenotic as temporal canal, which splits into 
two branches: one branch giving rise to infraorbital canal, 
other branch entering frontal through supraorbital canal. 
Supraorbital canal not branched, running through nasal 
bone. Epiphyseal pore opening at supraorbital main canal. 
Nasal canal with single opening at each end. Infraorbital 
canal running through entire second infraorbital, 
extending to infraorbital 1 and opening into four pores; 
one pore at second infraorbital just before articulation 
point with infraorbital 1, remaining pores opened in first 
infraorbital. Preoperculomandibular branch not connected 
to preoperculomandibular canal, which runs through 
entire preopercle with three openings, leading to pores 3, 
4, and 5, respectively.

posterior to cleithrum to caudal peduncle, along ventral portion 
of dorsolateral body plates and dorsal portion of ventrolateral 
body plates, respectively; nearly close to midlateral plate 
junctions; more evident in males (Fig. 1) than in females (Fig. 
6) and absent in juveniles (Fig. 7). Inner coloration layer on 
plate junction. Four oblique, trespassing, rough bars on side of 
trunk, more evident in juveniles with less than 19 mm SL (Fig. 
7). In males, bars variably restricted to dorsolateral body plates, 
or extending through plate junctions to ventrolateral body 
plates (Fig. 1). In females, bars shape variable, usually present 
on dorsolateral body plates and extending to ventrolateral body 
plates, sometimes forming a zigzag pattern (Fig. 6). Ventral 
surfaces of body yellowish white.

Dorsal spine light brown. Anterior portion of dorsal fin 
with several chromatophores, coalesced in diffuse, elongated 
blotch along the membrane between the first and second 
branched rays and along proximal portion of the membrane 
between third and fourth branched rays; remaining 
interradial membranes hyaline. Roughly two series of 
brown blotches restricted to rays, except by interradial space 
between first-second, and second-third branched rays (Figs. 
1, 6). Juveniles with dorsal spine and two anterior branched 
rays black pigmented, as well as the membrane between the 
first and second branched rays and along proximal portion 
of the membrane between third and fourth branched rays; 
remaining interradial membranes hyaline; branched dorsal 
fin rays 2 or 3 to 8 or 9 with small black dots along half-distal 
length (Fig. 7).

Ground color of anal-fin rays faintly yellowish white, 
almost hyaline. Interradial anal-fin membranes in the 
midlength of anal-fin rays hyaline to light gray with 
scattered chromatophores on rays and membrane (Figs. 
1, 6) and dark gray to black in juveniles (up to 20 mm SL; 
Fig. 7). Adipose-fin spine brown in adults (Figs. 1, 6) and 
black in juveniles (Fig. 7). Adipose-fin membrane with 
scattered chromatophores; more concentrated on free border. 
Pectoral spine light brown. Pectoral-fin rays with dark brown 
chromatophores restricted along first four branched rays; 
interradial membrane hyaline. Pelvic fin hyaline, with diffuse 
series of scattered chromatophores on middle region of fin in 
smaller specimens. Caudal fin with three-four series of small, 
dark-brown blotches restricted to principal rays.

Coloration in life. General color pattern of black marks 
similar to that described for specimens in alcohol. Region of 
opercle and side of scapular girdle iridescent green (Fig. 6).

Sexual dimorphism. Male representatives of Scleromystax 
with a well-distinguishable genital papillae display some 
dimorphic features that help to distinguish them (Britto, 
2003). The most useful characteristics are the elongate 
pectoral and dorsal fins, and the sides of snout (cheek region) 
bearing pointed, relatively long odontodes embedded in 
fleshy papillae. Notwithstanding, those features show a 
variable degree of development within the genus (Britto &amp;amp; 
Reis, 2005: 486-487), and S. salmacis displays none of the 
dimorphic conditions in addition to the shape of the genital 
papillae (Britto &amp;amp; Reis, 2005: figs. 1-2). Scleromystax 
reisi shared with its congener, S. prionotos, these sexually 
dimorphic features less evident, i.e. males with only minute, 
scattered odontodes in the sides of snout (although inserted 
in fleshy tissue in some specimens of S. prionotos), and 
dorsal and pectoral fins slightly longer than in females; 
conditions even less conspicuous in S. reisi. Males of S. reisi 
present thicker pectoral spines, with plentiful, randomly 
scattered odontodes, while females display odontodes 
roughly arranged in longitudinal rows. Also, males bear 
small, whiskerlike odontodes on dorsal surface of pectoral 
spine just adjacent to fin membrane.

Habitat and ecological notes (based on material from 
EEA-UFRGS). Scleromystax reisi was found mainly 
in very small (0.5-2 m wide) and shallow streams (30-60 
cm depth), with slow current water and surrounded by 
relatively preserved riparian vegetation. The bottom was 
sandy, sometimes covered with a thin layer of mud or 
fallen leaves. Although there were rocky bottom stretches 
in the same creeks, the species was never found there. The 
streams may have a small amount of submerged vegetation. 
Other species collected along with Scleromystax reisi were 
Astyanax eigenmanniorum (Cope), Cheirodon interruptus 
(Jenyns), Corydoras paleatus (Jenyns), Heptapterus 
mustelinus (Valenciennes), H. sympterygium (Buckup), 
Mimagoniates inequalis (Eigenmann), Phalloceros 
caudimaculatus (Hensel), Pseudobunocephalus iheringii 
(Boulenger), Rhamdia sp. and Scleronema sp.

Distribution. Mainly first order streams of tributaries of 
the rio Jacuí and rio Camaquã, laguna dos Patos drainage, 
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Fig. 8).

southern Santa Catarina State, Brazil, showing the 
distribution of Scleromystax reisi in the laguna dos Patos 
drainage (yellow symbols; star = type locality) and the 
distribution of S. salmacis (red symbols; triangle = first 
record to the rio Tramandaí drainage).

Etymology. The specific name is given in honor to 
our colleague Roberto Esser dos Reis, for his many 
contributions to Neotropical ichthyology, including studies 
in callichthyid fish. A noun in the genitive case.

Conservation status. Scleromystax reisi is known from an 
Extent of Occurrence (EOO) of approximately 9,400 km2 
and occurs only in forested streams with preserved riparian 
vegetation, a habitat naturally fragmented in the southern 
border of the Atlantic forest. There are no additional treats 
and it can be categorized as Least Concern (LC) according 
to IUCN criteria (IUCN, 2016).

Discussion

Conservation notes. The discovery of Scleromystax reisi 
is recent, but although the species is relatively rare in fish 
collections, it has been successfully collected in different 
occasions in at least one locality (EEA-UFRGS: 1 Apr 2008, 
UFRGS 16590; 25 Apr 2011, UFRGS 14965; 6 May 2011, 
UFRGS 14964, UFRGS 14968; 6 Oct 2012, UFRGS 17416; 23 
Jan 2013, UFRGS 17414; 20 Sep 2013, UFRGS 19189, UFRGS 
19188; 1 Nov 2013, UFRGS 18254; 30 Nov 2013, UFRGS 
19191). This suggests that the species is well stablished but 
in very selective habitats associated with preserved riparian 
vegetation (see “Habitat and ecological notes” above). 

The same seems to be true for Scleromystax salmacis. 
That species was described from the rio Mampituba and rio 
Araranguá, in Santa Catarina State (Britto &amp;amp; Reis, 2005) 
based on a few lots. These two rivers form, along with the rio 
Tramandaí drainage, an area of endemism in southern Brazil, 
sharing a number of endemic fish species (Malabarba &amp;amp; 
Isaia, 1992; Reis &amp;amp; Schaefer, 1998; Hirschmann et al., 2015), 
and historically united in a single palaeodrainage in the area 
exposed with the retreat in sea level during the Last Glacial 
Maximum (Thomaz et al., 2015). Surprisingly, S. salmacis 
was not recorded from the rio Maquiné or rio Três Forquilhas 
in the rio Tramandaí drainage, regardless the extensive 
collections of fishes from rio Tramandaí drainage (e.g., see 
map of distributional records of Corydoras paleatus in this 
drainage at Malabarba et al., 2013: 65). The re-identification 
of one lot of callichthyid catfish from a dense fragment of 
wetland forest located in the rio Tramandaí drainage (UFRGS 
6575), however, allowed the recognition of a single lot of S. 
salmacis from this southern drainage in the Rio Grande do 
Sul State, Brazil. Likewise Scleromystax reisi, S. salmacis 
seems to inhabit very restricted habitats associated to forested 
streams, a kind of habitat that is naturally fragmented in the 
southern border of the Atlantic forest. 

Similar results have been obtained by Villa-Verde et al. 
(2013) that discovered and described a new trichomycterid, 
Listrura depinnai (known only from two specimens of a 
single dense fragment of wetland forest from the laguna 
dos Patos drainage), a genus with six species previously 
known to occur from Santa Catarina to Rio de Janeiro 
States. All these results points out that forested fragments 
at the southern border of the Atlantic forest are especially 
critical for conservation. The fishes found in these habitats 
are not border populations of species with broader areas 
of occurrence in this biome, but otherwise species with 
small populations and small areas of occurrence associated

with the remaining fragments at the southern limits of the 
Atlantic Forest. 

Phylogenetic notes. The new taxon could be easily assigned 
to Scleromystax, displaying the character-states that defines 
the genus, such as a slender palatine, an elongate lateral 
ethmoid (Britto, 2003), presence of minute odontode-bearing 
platelets between posterior tip of parieto-supraoccipital and 
nuchal plate, and posterior process of parieto-supraoccipital 
and nuchal plate both elongate, almost reaching, but not 
touching each other (Britto, 2003; Britto &amp;amp; Reis, 2005). 
Besides, S. reisi presents the sexually dimorphic conditions 
found in almost all Scleromystax representatives, although in 
a less-conspicuous form. 

A diagnostic feature of Scleromystax reisi is the second 
infraorbital expanded ventrally, adjacent to small, almost 
imperceptible, naked area between sphenotic, compound 
pterotic, opercle and preopercle (Fig. 4). Although a ventral 
expansion on the infraorbital 2 could be observed in some 
Corydoras species (Britto, 2003: 129-130), such conditions 
are somewhat different. In those Corydoras, the expansion 
fully contacts the compound pterotic, while the contact is 
limited to the sphenotic in the new taxon. Interestingly, the 
infraorbital series seems to be a useful source of taxonomic 
features for Corydoradinae (Tencatt et al., 2013).

Another interesting condition of Scleromystax reisi 
concerns the cranial fontanel completely occluded in large 
specimens, leaving just a shallow fossae between frontals and 
anterior tip of parieto-supraoccipital (Fig. 3). Examination 
of several representatives of Scleromystax reveals that this 
feature is shared only with fully-grown specimens of S. 
macropterus. In the other species, even the largest individuals 
of S. barbatus (Quoy &amp;amp; Gaimard), the cranial fontanel is 
always wide or narrowly opened.

The inclusion of Scleromystax reisi in the data matrix of 
Britto (2003) grouped this species close to S. salmacis and S. 
macropterus, with S. barbatus and S. prionotos as successive 
sister-clades of this assemblage. The group recovered by the 
former three species is based on characters as a wide posterior 
portion of the mesethmoid, a slender lateral ethmoid, and a 
deep opercle. Although preliminary, this hypothesis partially 
corroborates Britto &amp;amp; Reis (2005) that suggested (p. 487) a 
close relationship between S. salmacis and S. macropterus. 
Besides, it brings interesting insights about the distributional 
pattern of representatives of this clade of Scleromystax 
species. As cited above, S. reisi and S. salmacis inhabit 
habitats associated to forested streams in the southern 
border of the Atlantic forest. This kind of habitat restriction 
is also shared with S. macropterus, whose representatives 
are recorded from São Paulo to Santa Catarina states in 
fragments of the Atlantic forest.
