Abstract

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest water mass on the globe, with

a complex biogeochemical system. As such, prokaryots have available

a myriad of di?erent environments to exploit resources, namely, ni-

trogen compounds, in which they participate and manipulate to form

the nitrogen cycle. In this study we aim to characterize the microbial

phylogenetic and denitriti?cation diversity throughout the Atlantic.

For this, water samples were retrieved from four depths in 12 points

across the Atlantic, to extract, sequence and analyse the 16S rRNA

and nirk genes using three di?erent pipelines. In addition, environ-

mental data was retrieved to attempt to predict the distribution of

each microbe in the studied area, by developing a Mahalanobis dis-

tance based model. From the three pipelines, the most promising

results came from Uparse. The results from 16S rRNA showed that

Archaea communites tended to segregate mostly on depth while Bac-

teria segregated in relationship to their regional distribution. While

the results from nirk reveal that Archaeal nirK-a containing commu-

nities consisted of three main clusters and Archaeal nirK-b communi-

ties were composed of two clusters. Furthermore, Bacteria harboring

nirK clustered mainly according to the oceanographic region. The

developed model could not show similar results observed in the ?eld,

and could not be applied to the nirK dataset. Certain phila distribu-

tion were cartographed in this transect for the ?rst time, and patterns

of distribution visited in other studies could be observed (bipolar and

lower latitude bound phila). Both Archaea nirK harbouring commu-

nities were depth-strati?ed which could be associated to the higher

nutrient supply rates in the epi- and upper mesopelagic as compared

to bathypelagic waters. In contrast, bacterial nirK harbouring com-

munities clustered according to the oceanographic regions probably



due to water mass formations. In the future, further work must be

employed in the development of distribution explaining models.

Resumo

O Oceano Atlântico é o segundo maior oceano do nosso planeta, e

consiste em duas bacias em forma de S, separadas longitudinalmente

pela Crista Médio-Atlântica. Estas formações geológicas in?uenciam

as correntes, as temperaturas e a composição química da água, e con-

sequentemente, as formas de vida que a habitam. A Crista Médio-

Atlântica é caracterizada, ao longo de toda a sua extensão, pela pre-

sença de atividade vulcânica, que introduz na coluna de água enormes

quantidades de metais e minerais a altas temperaturas. De notar a

existência de zonas de alta produtividade como o Mar dos Sargaços,

e a presença da corrente termo-halina, onde a água afunda na prox-

imidade dos polos e volta a emergir nos oceanos Indico e Pací?co. A

árvore da vida divide-se em três domínios: Eucariota, Bactéria e Ar-

queias. Arqueia e Bacteria formam o grupo denominado Procariota,

o qual ocupa todos os habitats presentes no oceano e, por isso, consti-

tui a maior porção de biomassa e faz parte central de vários sistemas

biogeoquímicos. O Azoto está presente nos seres vivos em vários com-

ponentes orgânicos. Transforma-se em diferentes formas químicas no

processo conhecido como ?Ciclo do Azoto?. Estes processos são em

grande parte mediados por procariotas e, de especial interesse para

este estudo, encontra-se o processo de desnitri?cação, no qual o Ni-

trato, numa série de passos de redução, se torna em Azoto atmosférico.

Atualmente, os microbiologistas utilizam diversas ferramentas molec-

ulares para estimar a diversidade e identi?car os micróbios, com base

nos quais podemos começar a fazer estudos de biogeogra?a micro-

biana, biodiversidade, etc. Apesar dos padrões já identi?cados para

estes seres, os fatores por tràs dos padrões biogeográ?cos continuam

pouco caracterizados, estando ainda em discussão se os que predom-

inam são o nicho ecológico clàssico e competição ou se, de acordo



com a teoria neutral, serão a dispersão e a deriva. A diversidade

?logenética não fornece informação acerca do funcionamento do ecos-

sistema. Os genes funcionais podem ser estudados neste sentido, como

é o exemplo do gene nir, responsável pela redução de nitrito (desni-

tri?cação) dentro do ciclo de Azoto. Foram desenvolvidos modelos

para explicar os mecanismos causadores de diversos fenómenos, os

quais fornecem simulações sem serem necessárias futuras observações

no alvo em estudo. O presente estudo tem como objetivo caracteri-

zar a diversidade ?logenética e as comunidades procariotas envolvidas

no processo de desnitri?cação, ao longo do Oceano Atlântico e veri-

?car a aplicação de um modelo preditivo da distribuição das mesmas.

Procedeu-se à colheita de amostras em duas expedições (Geotraces-1

e -2) ao longo de um transepto no sentido norte-sul no lado Ocidental

do Oceano Atlântico. Em 51 estações entre as latitudes 65°N e 55°S

foram colhidas 4 a 8 amostras em profundidades desde a superfície

até 4000 metros de profundidade. Para a colheita das amostras de

água foram utilizadas garrafas Niskin , acopladas a um sensor CTD.

As diferentes regiões oceanográ?cas amostradas foram classi?cadas

da seguinte forma:North Atlantic Arctic Province (ARCT), North At-

lantic Drift Province (NADR), North Atlantic Gyral Province (NAG),

Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA), South Atlantic Gyral (SATL) e

Subantarctic Province (SANT). Para caracterizar a comunidade pro-

cariota, foram utilizadas amostras de quatro profundidades diferentes,

colhidas em duas estações em cada região oceanográ?ca, de forma a

sequenciar nirK e 16S rRNA de Bactérias e Arqueias com tecnolo-

gia Illumina. Após a extração, ampli?cação e sequenciação dos genes

nirK e textit16S rRNA, foram utilizadas três pipelines (Uparse, Qiime

e Mothur) para calcular a tabela de Unidades Taxonómicas Opera-

cionais (Operational Taxonomic Units - OTUs) e os correspondentes

índices de biodiversidade, para comparação. Os resultados destas

pipelines foram semelhantes entre si, pelo que apenas os resultados

vindos de Uparse foram utilizados no desenvolvimento posterior do

estudo. Esta pipeline usa ferramentas e comandos de usearch, já que



Uparse faz parte desta coleção de software. Para atribuir taxonomias

às diferentes unidades, foi feito um blast com as sequências representa-

tivas das OTUs para comparar com a base de dados SILVA_123 (para

16S rRNA) e uma base de dados desenvolvida (para nirK) no depar-

tamento de Microbiologia Oceanográ?ca da Universidade de Viena.

Para melhor identi?car padrões de diversidade, foram calculados, para

cada amostra, índices de diversidade e equitatividade de Shannon e o

número de Chao. O modelo desenvolvido para prever a distribuição

das OTUs, calculou para cada uma delas, a distribuição normal mul-

tidimensional das variáveis ambientais observadas nos locais em que

a unidade em estudo estava presente, e ponderada pela quantidade

de OTUs aí registadas. De seguida, a distância de Mahalanobis foi

medida entre a média multidimensional e cada local amostrado. Esta

distância foi usada como aproximação à variância, e usada para calcu-

lar a quantidade de OTUs em cada amostra, através da sua subtração

à média quantidade da OTU. Da sequenciação das nossas amostras re-

sultaram 4 111 873 sequências. As pipelines Uparse, Qiime e Mothur

obtiveram respetivamente 1 986, 7 941 e 244 734 OTUs das sequên-

cias das bactérias e o tempo de processamento foi aproximadamente

3 horas, 2 dias e 2-3 semanas respetivamente, com os índices de biodi-

versidade semelhantes para os produtos das três pipelines. Os ?los de

Arquias presentes no Oceano Atlântico incluem Euryarchaeota, Woe-

searchaeota (DHVEG-6), Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota e o grupo

marinho de fontes hidrotermais (MHVG). O mais representado foi

o Taumarchaeota (51,7%), seguido do Euryarchaeota (45,2%). Em

termos de abundância, o ?lo Euryarchaeota aumenta relativamente

ao resto da comunidade de Arquias, em baixas latitudes, no ambi-

ente epipelágico, em contraste com Thaumarchaeota e Euryarchaeota

que habitam o meio batipelágico inferior. As comunidades de Ar-

quias agruparam-se de acordo com a batimetria em que foram encon-

tradas, e encontrando-se mais próximas de comunidades de batime-

trias semelhantes. Os ?los de bactérias presentes no Oceano Atlân-

tico incluem Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chlo-



ro?exi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Marinimicro-

bia (SAR406), Nitrospirae, Parcubacteria, Verrucomicrobia, LCP-89,

Lentisphaerae, Hydrogenedentes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Gracilibac-

teria, Spirochaetes, PAUC34f, Gemmatimonadetes, Sacharibacteria,

Deferribacteres e Firmicutes. O mais representado foi Proteobactéria

(63,7%). O ?lo Chloro?exi aumentou em profundidade e em baixas

latitudes. O Actinobacteria foi mais abundante à superfície, e com

redução da abundância nas regiões SANT, WTRA e ARCT. À super-

fície, o ?lo Bacteroidetes apresentou maiores abundâncias no hemis-

fério norte, enquanto em profundidade, foi mais abundante em altas

latitudes. O Cyanobacteria esteve presente nas camadas super?ciais,

em abundâncias relativamente altas (11,6%). Tal como as Arquias, as

comunidades bacterianas também se agruparam de acordo com a pro-

fundidade. Contudo as regiões ARCT e WTRA formaram um grupo

à parte. As Arqueias apresentam duas formas de nirK: tipo a e tipo

b, enquanto as Bactérias apenas possuem um. As comunidades de

Arqueias que possuem tipo ?a? apresentaram três agrupamentos: co-

munidades do ARCT-meio batipelágico superior-SANT mesopelágico,

meio batipelágico inferior e o terceiro com as comunidades presentes

nas camadas super?ciais. As do tipo ?b? apresentaram dois grupos:

um com as comunidades do meio batipelágico superior e a comunidade

do ARCT do meio batipelágico inferior, e a outra com as comunidades

do meio batipelágico inferior. As comunidades bacterianas que pos-

suem nirK agruparam-se principalmente segunda as regiões, com co-

munidades ARCT e NAG bem de?nidas, e um terceiro grupo com

as comunidades do meio batipelágico inferior. O modelo aqui desen-

volvido resultou em índices de diversidade inferiores aos observados

e, no caso dos dados das Arqueias, os mesmos padrões de profun-

didade nos índices Chao (super?cie-batipelágico inferior menor que

batipelágico superior) entre os dados observados e os do modelo. Os

índices de Shannon para os dados do modelo das bactérias, apresen-

taram um aumento com a profundidade, o mesmo padrão que é ob-

servado para os índices de Chao dos dados originais recolhidos. Neste



estudo foi cartografada, pela primeira vez, a distribuição de vários

?los ao longo do Oceano Atlântico, tendo sido também con?rmados

os padrões de distribuição em outros estudos (bipolar e tropicalismo).

Ambas as comunidades de arqueias com nirK, estão estrati?cadas ao

longo das camadas do Oceano, o que pode estar associado a maiores

taxas de fornecimento de nutrientes à superfície em comparação com

o meio batipelágico. Em contraste, comunidades de bactérias com

nirK, diferenciaram-se de acordo com a região, provavelmente devido

às formações dominantes de massas de água presentes nestas áreas,

que não se misturam entre si, possibilitando segregação. O modelo

mostrou-se adequado em algumas situações mas revelou debilidades

noutros casos, necessitando de melhorias para permitir extrapolações

de dados a nível global.

Introduction

1.1 The Atlantic Ocean

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean, and is delimited by the continents

of Africa, America and Europe and by the Southern and Arctic Ocean (Figure

1.1) . It consists of two S-shaped basins separated longitudinally by the Mid-

Atlantic Ridge, with minor transverse ridges generating a series of basins. These

geological features in?uence the current systems, temperature and chemistry of

the water, and therefore the life forms inhabiting it. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is

a submarine mountain range, sometimes reaching the sea-surface where it forms

islands and archipelagos, such as Iceland and the Azores archipelago. Numerous

active volcanoes and hydrothermal vents are located along the oceanic ridges,

mainly underwater, releasing copious amounts of minerals and metals to the wa-

ter column at high temperatures. The continental shelves are characterized by

high biological productivity, as the hydrodynamics of these regions favour pho-

tosynthetic organisms staying within the euphotic zone, the sunlit surface waters

where net primary production is possible. A particular feature is the Sargasso Sea

in the North Atlantic Gyre, characterized by the presence of Sargassum seaweed

in the surface waters.

Surface currents are wind driven, and therefore, due to the Ekman [and Corio-

lis] e?ects, generate two major oceanic gyres north and south of the Equator, with

clockwise and counter clockwise rotation, respectively. Downwelling processes oc-

cur in the centre of the gyres and in the subpolar regions, while upwelling prevails

at the equator. In contrast, the currents in the deep ocean are density driven,

coined the thermohaline circulation (Rahmstorf, 2006). Sea surface water cools

down on its way to the poles and becoming denser, eventually sinks at high lat-

itudes, a process known as deep-water formation. The newly formed deep-water

?ows towards lower latitudes and is upwelled in the North Paci?c and northern

Indian Ocean.

1.2 Microbes

The tree of life has been traditionally separated into 3 domains of life (Figure 1.2)

(Woese et al., 1990). Eukaryotes, including humans, are formed by one or more

cells which contain several compartments, such as the nucleus, where (most of)

the genetic material of the organism is found. Bacteria are single-celled organisms

without nucleus and a di?erent cellular structure as compared to the eukaryotes,

especially in the outer layer of the cell. The third domain of life, Archaea, consists

of single-celled organisms without cellular compartments, however, they share

with eukaryotes many molecular features (Woese et al., 1990).

Archaea and Bacteria, frequently referred to as prokaryotes, from the Greek

?pro-karyon? (before core) due to the lack of a nucleus, successfully inhabit all

oceanic habitats. Prokaryotes are found from several hundred metres below the

sea?oor (Schippers et al., 2005) to the ocean surface (Franklin et al., 2005), in

super-cold brine channels of icebergs and sea-ice (Margesina &amp;amp; Miteva, 2011) and

hot waters originating in hydrothermal vents (Nakagawa et al., 2004).

Prokaryotes constitute the largest fraction of the living biomass of the world's

oceans (Whitman et al., 1998) and play a key role in all biogeochemical cycles in

the ocean (Azam &amp;amp; Worden, 2004; Kirchman, 2008). However, our knowledge on

their distribution patterns and functional response throughout the ocean, their

response to di?erent environmental parameters, and their ecological roles, is still

rather limited.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.3 The Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrogen (N) is present in all living organisms, found in nucleic acids and amino

acids (the building blocks for DNA-RNA and proteins, respectively) and other

biomolecules. N is transformed through di?erent chemical forms in the nitrogen

cycle (a simpli?ed scheme is shown in Figure 1.3). Atmospheric N2 is reduced to

ammonium (NH+4 )via nitrogen ?xation and can be afterwards incorporated into

organic molecules, process known as assimilation. Ammonium can also subse-

quently be oxidized to nitrite (NO?2 ), a process known as the ammonia oxidation.

NO?2 can be further oxidized to nitrate (NO
?
3 ) via nitrite oxidation. Nitrate,

in a series of reduction steps normally under anoxic or hypoxic conditions (see

Figure 1.3, left side of dashed line) can be transformed back to N2, in a process

named denitri?cation. The process by which organic nitrogen, i.e., incorporated

in molecules with carbon, is turned into inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammo-

nium, is known as mineralization or ammoni?cation. All the di?erent processes

from the N cycle are mediated by Bacteria and to a lesser extent Archaea. Ni-

trogen ?xation, nitri?cation and denitri?cation are performed by prokaryotes.

However, Archaea have not been shown to perform nitrite oxidation (Madigan

et al., 2012).

1.4 Prokaryotic diversity

Microbiologists are now using molecular tools to estimate diversity and identify

microbes which do not have cultured representatives. One of the tools used is

ortholog genes, i.e., genes that have changed in sequence over time as species

have diverged (Madigan et al., 2012). Organisms that share the same orthologs

are considered a phylotype. Genes encoding the small subunit of the ribosomal

RNA (rRNAs), in particular the 16S rRNA, are widely used to reconstruct the

phylogeny of microorganisms as it is highly conserved (Weisburg et al., 1991).

Using these genetic tools, we can identify microbial operational taxonomic

units(OTUs) and we can conduct studies on microbial biogeography, diversity,

etc. Prokaryotes, similarly to eukaryotes, show macroecological distribution pat-

terns, such as latitudinal species richness gradients (Fuhrman et al., 2008; Pom-

6



1.5 Functional diversity

mier et al., 2007), the Rapoport rule, i.e., latitudinal ranges of organisms are

generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes (Amend et al., 2013;

Sul et al., 2013). Contrasting patterns of microbes as compared to macroorgan-

isms, such as no elevation gradient in diversity and distinct generalist/specialist

spatial distribution (microbial specialists with broader distribution than gener-

alists) (Carbonero et al., 2014; Fierer et al., 2011). Therefore, the existence of

microbial biogeography is now widely accepted (Parnell et al., 2010; Sintes et al.,

2015; Sul et al., 2013). However, the underlying factors behind these biogeograph-

ical patterns are still poorly characterized. Whether the distribution of microbial

OTUs is depending on competition and follows the classical niche theory or, as

proposed by the neutral theory, is due to dispersal and drift is still under debate

(Vellend et al., 2014).

1.5 Functional diversity

Phylogenetic diversity does not provide information on the ecosystem function-

ing. All organisms perform metabolic processes mediated by proteins that are

encoded by speci?c genes. These functional genes can be used to assess the dis-

tribution and diversity of the organisms according to their potential function in

the ecosystem. Ammonia monooxygenase, encoded by the amo gene, responsible

for ammonia oxidation, and nitrite reductase, encoded by the nir gene (Figure

1.3), metabolizing NO?2 into NO, a process known as nitrite reduction, are two key

enzymes in the nitrogen cycle. The abundance and diversity of functional genes

can subsequently be assessed using molecular techniques, such as quantitative

PCR and sequencing.

1.6 Modelling

According to the Oxford Dictionary (Stevenson, 2015): ?Model - A. Noun. 8.

A simpli?ed or idealized description or conception of a particular system, situ-

ation, or process, often in mathematical terms, that is put forward as a basis

for theoretical or empirical understanding, or for calculations, predictions, etc.; a

conceptual or mental representation of something.?.

1. INTRODUCTION

Models have been developed to explain the mechanisms behind diverse phe-

nomena. They have been used to explain the movement of celestial bodies with

Newton laws (Newton, 1687), quantum mechanics (Schrödinger, 1926), bacterial

growth (Zwietering et al., 1990), evolution (Hanage et al., 2006) and even life (ar-

ti?cial life) models (Gardner, 1970). Thus, a model should provide simulations

without having to rely on future observations of the target of the study. The

usual representation of a model is based on simple equations, such as regression

models or the Newton's law of universal gravitation (Newton, 1687):

F = G
m1m2
r2

(1.1)

Alternatively, algorithms can be used.

1.7 Objectives

In the present study, we aim to (1) characterize the geographical distribution of

both Archaea and Bacteria from pole-to-pole across the Atlantic Ocean, (2) to

assess the relative abundance and diversity of di?erent prokaryotic genes related

to speci?c metabolic pathways from the nitrogen cycle, and ?nally, by using

the information obtained from the previous two objectives, (3) to build a model

based on the environmental conditions to predict the distribution and diversity

of Archaea and Bacteria in the ocean, both at a functional and at a phylogenetic

level. In order to achieve these objectives, high throughput sequencing of the

16S rRNA and the nirK gene from Archaea and Bacteria was carried out using

DNA extraction from water samples obtained from di?erent depth layers along a

latitudinal transect in the Atlantic Ocean.

Materials and Methods

2.1 Sampling

Seawater samples were collected during the GEOTRACES-1 and -2 cruises on-

board R/V Pelagia, from April to June 2010, and GEOTRACES-3 on board

of R/V James Cook from February to April 2011. Samples were collected at

6-8 depths in 51 stations from 65°N to 55°S (Figure 2.1) from the epipelagic

[0 - 199 m], mesopelagic [200 - 999 m], upper bathypelagic [1000 - 1999 m]

and lower bathypelagic [&gt;2000 m] depths. Water samples were collected with

Niskin bottles mounted in a frame holding also sensors for conductivity, tem-

perature, depth (CTD), salinity, oxygen, ?uorescence and optical backscattering.

Six di?erent oceanographic regions were distinguished according to Longhurst

(Longhurst, 2007, from north to south: North Atlantic Arctic province (ARCT),

North Atlantic Drift province (NADR), North Atlantic Gyral province (NAG),

Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA), South Atlantic Gyral (SATL) and Sub-

antarctic province (SANT); Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1). The methods used for

the measurement of inorganic nutrients and trace elements are available at the

Geotraces website (http://www.geotraces.org) (Group et al., 2015). Bacte-

rial abundance was assessed by ?ow cytometry as previously described (Sintes

et al., 2015). Inorganic nutrients (SiO4?4 , PO
3?
4 , NO

?
3 , NO

?
2 ) and trace elements

(Al, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Y, La), and bacterial activity (3H-Leucine uptake)

were measured (Table 2.2) at 24 depth layers. Samples for prokaryotic activ-

ity measurements (leucine uptake and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) ?xation)

and DNA extraction were collected at 6-8 depths. Prokaryotic leucine uptake

(De Corte et al., 2016) and DIC ?xation (Herndl et al., 2005) were evaluated

via the incorporation of radiolabeled substrates as previously described. Samples

from four depths obtained from two stations per region were used to characterize

the nirK and 16S rRNA gene of Bacteria and Archaea (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1) by

Illumina sequencing.

2.2 DNA extraction

Two-10 L of seawater were ?ltered onto 0.22µm polycarbonate ?lters depending

on the depth. The ?lters were stored at -80°C until DNA extraction was per-

formed using Ultraclean soil DNA isolation kit (MoBIO) at the facilities of the

Department of Limnology and Bio-Oceanography, University of Vienna.

2.3 PCR and Sequencing

2.3 PCR and Sequencing

The 16S rRNA gene from Bacteria and Archaea, and the nirK gene from Bac-

teria and Archaea were PCR ampli?ed using the primers described in Table 2.3

prior to sequencing at the facilities of the Department of Limnology and Bio-

Oceanography, University of Vienna. Each 25 µL PCR reaction consisted of

0.2-1.0 µM of the corresponding primers (Table 2.3), 200 µM of dNTP, 2µg BSA,

2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5U Picomaxx high ?delity DNA polymerase (Agilent Tech-

nologies), 2.5 µL of the corresponding PCR bu?er, and 1-2 µL of the DNA extract,

made up to 25 µL with UV-treated ultra-pure water (Sigma). Cycling conditions

for bacterial 16S rRNA gene were as follows: 5 min at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles

consisting at 94°C for 30 sec, 57.5°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45 sec.

Cycling was followed by a ?nal ampli?cation step at 72°C for 10 min and

then held at 4°C. The thermocyling for archaeal 16S rRNA gene consisted of an

initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 10 touch-up PCR cycles

consisting of 30 sec at 94°C, increasing annealing temperature from 50°C to 54°C

(increasing 0.5°C each cycle) for 40 sec, 72°C for 1 min, 20 cycles of 94°C for 30

sec, 54°C for 40 sec, 72°C for 1 min, followed by one cycle of 72°C for 10 min and

4°C hold.

Bacterial nirK gene thermal cycling consisted of an initial denaturation step

at 95°C for 5 min, 9 touchdown cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, decreasing annealing

temperature from 68°C to 60°C for 30 sec (progressively decreased by 1°C), and

81.5°C for 60 sec. This was followed by 26 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30

sec, at 81.5°C for 60 sec, and a ?nal extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Archaeal

nirK -a and -b were ampli?ed by an initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min,

followed by 30 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94°C for 60 sec, annealing at

50°C for 60 sec, an extension at 72°C for 60 sec, and a ?nal extension step at

72°C for 10 min.

After the PCR, the di?erent products were checked on a 2% agarose gel for the

correct band size, and the PCR product was puri?ed using PCRExtract MiniKit

(5-PRIME). Puri?ed PCR products were quanti?ed using a Nanodrop® spec-

trophotometer. Subsequently, all PCR products were standardized to a concen-

tration of 20 ng DNA µL?1 with PCR-grade water (Sigma) prior to sequencing.

13



2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq ® next generation sequenc-

ing system (Illumina Inc.). The resulting 2 x 300 bp reads were demultiplexed.

The ?nal output from three di?erent pipelines (Uparse, Qiime, Mothur) were

compared. Speci?cally, the total number of estimated OTUs present and the

diversity indexes (Shannon, Shannon evenness and Chao) obtained with the three

di?erent pipelines were compared.

The results obtained with the three pipelines were similar (see results section).

Thus, we subsequently used the Uparse based pipeline. This pipeline mainly used

usearch tools and commands, as the Uparse clustering tool is inserted in this

software collection. Therefore, almost all (except for the taxonomy classi?cation)

the steps were conducted with usearch. Both forward and reverse reads were

merged, followed by ?ltering (minimum length of 400 nucleotides, no n's, no

reads with more than 4 total expected errors). The merged and ?ltered reads

were then dereplicated (a list of unique sequences was kept in this step, with the

number of repeated sequences annotated to the sequences labels) sorted (with

all singletons discarded), and clustered into di?erent OTU's, using the Uparse

commands. fasta_number (python script) was used to label the sequences of

each OTU, with its respective OTU code, and with this output, all the reads were

mapped against. The previous mapping ?le was used as an input for uc2otutab

(python script) to create the OTU table. To access the taxonomy to the OTUs,

a blast was carried with the labelled OTU sequences against the SILVA_123

database (for 16S rRNA gene) and a in house nirK database (for the nirK gene).

2.4 Modelling and Statistics

2.4 Modelling and Statistics

The developed model (Annex 1) calculated for each OTU the multidimensional

normal distribution in relation to selected environmental data (absolute latitude,

depth, temperature, concentrations of Ni, Fe, Zn, Mn, Si, PO4, NO2, bacterial

abundance, leucine incorporation). For this, the averages of the samples were

calculated for each environmental variable, where each observation was weighted

according to OTU frequency detected on that same sample,

E?x,otu =

?i=n
i=1 ei,x,otuwi,x,otu?i=n

i=1 wi,x,otu
(2.1)

where E? is the Environmental variable x on OTU otu, e is the observation, i is

the sample and w is the weight(frequency). For the calculation of the distance

between this multidimensional point of averages, and a sample, it was used the

Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936),

M =
?

(u ? vi)V ?1(u ? vi)T (2.2)

Where M is the Mahalanobis distance, V ?1 is the inverse of the covariance matrix,

u and vi are two arrays of values(u with the averages of E?, and vi with the sample

i environmental values) and T stands for transposed. The Mahalanobis distance

was used as a proxy for standard deviation. Further down, the abundance of a

speci?c OTU was calculated for each sample as so,

Modi,otu = f?otu ± Mi × sdotu (2.3)

Where Mod is the modeled value (of abundance, i.e. frequency) for the sample,

M is the Mahalanobis distance, i is the sample and both f?otu and sdotu are

the average and the standard deviation of the OTU otu frequency, respectively.

From this equation, two results (? and +) are compared to the original value
of (frequency) abundance, with the closest to the original being kept. All values

below 0 were turned into 0. This was applied to all OTUs throughout the entire

sampling locations.

17



2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

The diversity indexes were calculated from the estimated OTUs and compared

to the diversity indexes estimated from the sequences obtained in the di?erent

samples. All the simulations and algorithms were run and written using python

programming language (Rossum &amp;amp; Drake Jr., 2006).

All statistical analyses used a signi?cance level of ? = 0.05, and were per-

formed using R (R Development Core Team, 2008), packages (Chen, 2012; Dray

et al., 2007; Hijmans &amp;amp; Van Etten, 2014; Lemon, 2006; Paradis et al., 2004; Pierce,

2012; Schliep, 2011).

Results

3.1 Comparison of di?erent pipelines for analysis

of high throughput sequencing data

16S rRNA gene and nirK gene sequencing of Bacteria and Archaea from the

Atlantic resulted in a total of 4111873 sequences (Table 3.1), with a majority of

archaeal sequences (&gt;3.5 million 16S rRNA gene sequences from Archaea).

We analysed the obtained sequences with three di?erent available pipelines:

Uparse, Qiime, and Mothur. These 3 pipelines resulted in 1986, 7941 and 244734

OTUs for the whole dataset of Bacteria (Table 3.2).

The processing time with the three pipelines was exponentially increasing

from Uparse to Qiime and to Mothur, lasting approximately 3 h, 2 d and 2-

3 weeks, respectively. The patterns of diversity and community composition

obtained from the di?erent pipelines were similar (Table 3.2). However, the

diversity and richness indexes were UPARSE&amp;lt;QIIME&amp;lt;MOTHUR, in agreement

with previous reports indicating that both Mothur and Qiime might overestimate

abundance phyla comprised Aigarchaeota and the marine hydrothermal vent

group (MHVG).

The dominant phylum was Thaumarchaeota with an average of 51.7 % of the

archaeal OTUs, followed by Euryarchaeota with an average 45.2 % of the OTUs.

Euryarchaeota increased in their relative contribution to the archaeal com-

munities towards lower latitudes in the epipelagic environment (Figure 3.1.a) in

contrast to Thaumarchaeota. In contrast, Euryarchaeota inhabiting the lower

bathypelagic realm decreased in their relative abundance from high to low lati-

tudes. Thaumarchaeota dominated the archaeal community in mesopelagic wa-

ters (Figures 3.1.b, c, d), contributing up to 74.0 % and 81.0 % of archaeal

sequences in the NAG and NADR, respectively.

Woesearchaeota (DHVEG-6) contributed on average 2.6 % to the archaeal

communities, increasing in their relative abundance from high towards lower lati-

tudes in all depth layers, except in the mesopelagic environment. Woesearchaeota

were mostly uniformly distributed in mesopelagic waters, with slightly higher

abundance at the NAG.

Members of the MHVG were limited to the lower bathypelagic layers, where

they represented ? 1.3 % of the archaeal communities in the NADR, NAG,
WTRA and SATL (Figure 3.1.d).

Aigarchaeota, with an average contribution of 0.2 % to the archaeal commu-

nities, were mainly found in the communities below the epipelagic zone, with a

maximum at the southern station of the NAG in mesopelagic waters.

Archaeal communities throughout the Atlantic were strati?ed (Figure 3.2).

Archaeal communities from epipelagic waters clustered together and were closer

related to mesopelagic communities than to those from deeper layers. Likewise,

mesopelagic communities clustered closer to upper bathypelagic than to lower

bathypelagic communities. Interestingly, epipelagic and lower bathypelagic com-

munities were closely represented in the PCoA plot, indicating a higher similarity

between these two communities as compared to the upper bathypelagic (Figure

3.2). Epi- and mesopelagic archaeal communities showed a larger dissimilarity

between samples from di?erent locations (Figure 3.2) as compared to the bathy-

pelagic communities.

23



3. RESULTS

The dominant bacterial phyla included Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Acti-

nobacteria, Chloro?exi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Marin-

imicrobia (SAR406). Other phyla present were Nitrospirae, Parcubacteria, Ver-

rucomicrobia, LCP-89, Lentisphaerae, Hydrogenedentes, Deinococcus-Thermus,

Gracilibacteria, Spirochaetes, PAUC34f, Gemmatimonadetes, Sacharibacteria,

Deferribacteres and Firmicutes.

The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, accounting on average 63.7

% of the bacterial community. Alpha-, Gamma-, Delta- and Betaproteobacte-

ria represented on average 30.1 %, 21.3 %, 11.6 % and 0.3 % of the bacterial

community, respectively.

The Chloro?exi phylum constituted on average 8.9 % of the bacterial OTUs.

Chloro?exi increased towards the bathypelagic layers, where they accounted for

11.4 % and 14.8 % of the upper and lower bathypelagic bacterial OTUs, respec-

tively. Moreover, the relative contribution of Chloro?exi increased towards low

latitudes at all depth layers (Figures 3.3.c, d). Actinobacteria, with an average

contribution of 6.5 % to the bacterial communities, was relatively more abundant

in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers. In epipelagic waters, Actinobacteria were

less abundant in SANT, WTRA and ARCT regions, with relative abundances

ranging between 0.9 and 7.3 % of the bacterial community. In mesopelagic wa-

ters from ARCT, NAG and SATL, Actinobacteria ranged between 3.0 % and

5.8% of the bacterial community (Figure 3.3.b). SAR406 account for 6 % of the

bacterial communities. SAR406 members increased in their relative abundance

with depth, with average contribution ranging between 14.4 % and 35.4 %, from

epi- to lower bathypelagic waters. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes de-

creased with depth from 10.2 % in epipelagic waters to 2.3 % in lower bathypelagic

environments. In epipelagic waters Bacteroidetes the highest contribution to bac-

terial communities was detected in the northern hemisphere, while Bacteroidetes

inhabiting deeper layers were more abundant at high latitudes, both in the north

and south (Figure 3.3). Cyanobacteria were present in the epipelagic layer at a

high relative abundance, on average 11.6 % of the bacterial OTUs, and to a lesser

extent in the mesopelagic realm mainly in SATL and SANT, with an average of

4.8 %.

24



3.2 Phylogenetic characterization of Bacteria and Archaea based on

16S rRNA gene

Acidobacteria represented on average 1.6 % of the bacterial communities. The

highest abundance of Acidobacteria was found in the bathypelagic realm, with

an average contribution of 2.6 % to bathypelagic bacterial communities (Figure

3.3).

Planctomycetes, with an average contribution of 1.4 % to the bacterial com-

munity, increased its contribution with depth and reached up to 2.3 % in lower

bathypelagic communities.

The relative abundance of Nitrospirae and Parcubacteria peaked at NAG,

where Nitrospirae contributed up to 2.1 % in the mesopelagic and Parcubacteria

contributed 18.7 % in the lower bathypelagic waters (Figures 3.3.b, d).

Similarly to archaeal communities, bacterial communities were depth strati-

?ed, with higher similarities between communities from speci?c depth layers as

compared to communities from speci?c regions. However, ARCT and WTRA

communities formed a separate cluster of deep ocean bacterial communities (Fig-

ure 3.4).

3.2.2 Nitrite reductase containing Bacteria and Archaea

Archaeal cells harbouring the nirK gene were divided in two groups (a and b)

according to their sequences, Archaeal nirK-a containing communities consisted

of three main clusters. Upper bathypelagic communities from throughout the

Atlantic clustered together with the ARCT communities from all depth layers

and SANT communities from the mesopelagic. Lower bathypelagic communi-

ties formed a separate cluster and meso- and epipelagic communities from other

regions except the ARCT (and SANT) region formed the third cluster (Figure

3.5).

Archaeal nirK-b communities were composed of one well de?ned group com-

prising the upper bathypelagic communities and the ARCT lower bathypelagic,

and a second group which included the lower bathypelagic communities. The rest

of the archaeal nirK-b harbouring communities from meso and epipelagic realms

were scattered (Figure 3.6).

Bacteria harbouring nirK clustered mainly according to the oceanographic

region, with ARCT and NAG communities forming separate clusters, and lower

3.3.1 Diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities

The diversity, evenness and richness indexes were in general higher for Bacteria

(Table 3.4) than for Archaea (Table 3.3) (Shannon diversity, Mann-Whitney: W=

131, p-value&lt;0.001; Shannon Evenness, Mann-Whitney: W= 270, p-value&lt;0.001;

Chao, Mann-Whitney: W= 18, p-value&lt;0.001).

In relation to depth, the Chao richness index of Archaea (Table 3.3) was

lower (Kruskall-Wallis: ?2: 12.84, p-value=0.005) in epipelagic and lower bathy-

pelagic communities as compared to upper bathypelagic (Multiple comparison

test after Kruskal-Wallis; p-value&lt;0.05). In contrast, the Chao index of Bacte-

ria (Table 3.4) was higher (Kruskall-Wallis: ?2: 9.26, p-value=0.026) for deeper

ness was high in the NAG region (Table 3.5.b). The Chao richness indices were

higher in the epipelagic waters of ARCT and SANT, while in other regions, the

richness was higher in deeper waters.

NirK-b containing archaeal cells exhibited a higher diversity in mesopelagic

and upper bathypelagic environments, especially in the WTRA (Table 3.6.a.c).

The evenness of archaeal nirK-b followed the same pattern as the diversity (Table

3.6.b). The Chao richness indices were higher in the mesopelagic and upper

bathypelagic.

Diversity, evenness and richness indices of nirK of Bacteria were higher in the

lower bathypelagic waters of the NADR, NAG and SANT, and in the mesopelagic

of the SANT. However, nirK of Bacteria could not be ampli?ed e?ciently in some

samples, especially from epipelagic waters (Table 3.7).

3.4 Modelling

The developed model applied to the dataset of 16S rRNA of Archaea (Annex:

Table 1) resulted in lower Shannon diversity (Figure 3.8; Mann-Whitney: W=

2585, p-value&amp;lt;0.001), evenness (Figure 3.9; Mann-Whitney: W= 2523, p-value

&lt;0.001) and Chao richness indices (Figure 3.10; Mann-Whitney: W= 2465.5, p-

value&amp;lt;0.001) as compared to the calculated ones based in measured parameters.

Chao richness showed a similar depth pattern in the model as obtained from

the actual data, with lower indices (Multiple comparison test after Kruskal-Wallis;

p-value&amp;lt;0.05) for the epipelagic and lower bathypelagic (Figure 3.11; observed

di?erence: 13.08; critical di?erence: 15.38) than in the upper bathypelagic realm.

Modelled Shannon diversity and evenness performed di?erently than the ob-

served indexes. Modelled diversity and evenness were signi?cantly lower in the

lower bathypelagic than in the epipelagic and upper bathypelagic (Figures 3.18,

3.13; Multiple comparison test after Kruskal-Wallis; p-value&amp;lt;0.05). The mod-

elled Chao richness index showed signi?cant di?erences between the di?erent

regions, however, it could not be pinpointed to speci?c samples (Figure 3.14; p-

value= ? 0.05; Observed di?erences: SANT-WTRA=20.31, ARCT-WTRA=19.75;

Critical di?erence= 21.82). The modelled diversity and evenness did not show

any signi?cant di?erences between the di?erent regions.

The model also resulted in lower diversity (Figure 3.15; Mann-Whitney: W=

value&amp;lt;0.001) when applied to bacterial 16S rRNA (Annex: Table 2) as compared

to the indices obtained from actual measurements.

Shannon diversity and evenness increased signi?cantly with depth (Multiple

comparison test after Kruskal-Wallis; p-value&amp;lt;) with signi?cantly lower values

in epipelagic bacterial communities as compared to lower bathypelagic communi-

ties (Figure 3.18, 3.19; Observed di?erences between epipelagic and lower bathy-

pelagic: Shannon diversity=17.44, Shannon evenness=17.81; Critical di?erence=

over, no signi?cant di?erence according to the region was observed for any of the

three indices.

The developed model could not be applied to the di?erent nirK gene datasets

due to the limited dataset.

Chapter 4

Discussion

4.1 Biogeography of prokaryotes.

Biogeography studies the distribution of organisms in space and time. Histori-

cally, this scienti?c discipline has focused on the distribution of macroorganisms,

plants and animals. However, in the last decades biogeographic studies of mi-

crobes have experienced major advances as a consequence of the development of

molecular tools that have allowed the study of uncultured organisms (Olsen et al.,

1986; Pace et al., 1986; Woese &amp;amp; Fox, 1977). Several biogeographic patterns de-

scribed for macroorganisms also occur in prokaryotes, such as latitudinal richness

gradients (Fuhrman et al., 2008) and bipolar distribution patterns (Sintes et al.,

2015). Moreover, depth distribution patterns of microbes have been frequently

described. Not surprisingly, phototrophic (light dependent) prokaryotes inhabit

the sunlit layers(Landry &amp;amp; Kirchman, 2002; Partensky et al., 1999) together with

microbes bene?ting from organic matter released by phytoplankton (Cho et al.,

2001), while some other prokaryotic taxa might bene?t from the conditions found

in the deep ocean (Zeng et al., 2009). Other general biogeographical patterns that

prokaryotes exhibit are the latitudinal richness gradients (Fuhrman et al., 2008;

Pommier et al., 2007), and the Rapoport rule, i.e., latitudinal ranges of organisms

are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes (Amend et al.,

2013; Sul et al., 2013).

Our results reveal distinct biogeographical patterns for most bacterial phyla

in agreement with previous ?ndings. Chloro?exi (SAR202) was characterized by

41



4. DISCUSSION

higher relative abundances towards low latitudes, while Bacteroidetes, Gammapro-

teobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Marinimicrobia (SAR406) exhibited dis-

tribution gradients from one pole to the other (higher relative abundances at

one pole and decreasing towards the other), as previously reported for Bac-

teroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria by ?uorescence in situ hybridization in epi-

and mesopelagic waters (Schattenhofer et al., 2009).

The pattern observed in Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobac-

teria and Marinimicrobia (SAR406) might be explained by environmental prefer-

ences (e.g., higher concentrations of inorganic nutrients at the northern latitudes),

or by the fact that sampling took place in di?erent seasons. Samples collected in

the northern hemisphere corresponded to spring and early summer, while samples

taken in the southern hemisphere were taken in autumn. However, a previous

study determined that the temporal e?ect on prokaryotic communities was low

as compared to spatial and environmental factors in the deep sea (Sintes et al.,

2015). The SAR202 metabolism is not well characterized (Schattenhofer et al.,

2009) thus it is di?cult to explain the distribution of this phylum. However,

previous studies (DeLong et al., 2006; Schattenhofer et al., 2009) have reported

the increase in relative abundance with depth in Chloro?exi in accordance with

our results.

Surprisingly, Nitrospirae and Parcubacteria were relatively abundant in mesopelagic

and bathypelagic waters at the southern station of the NAG (North Atlantic

Gyre). This region is located close to the Sargasso Sea, characterized by higher

primary production than the neighbouring oligotrophic ocean (Jenkins &amp;amp; Gold-

man, 1985). Members of Nitrospirae are commonly chemolithotrophic nitrite-

oxidizing bacteria, while Parcubacteria have been identi?ed mainly in anoxic envi-

ronments (Nelson &amp;amp; Stegen, 2015). However, little is known about the metabolism

of this latter group. Environments favourable for Nitrospirae are associated with

high amounts of decaying organic matter in the mesopelagic realm and conse-

quently reduced oxygen concentrations, favouring nitrite oxidizing bacteria. In

contrast to the Paci?c or Indian Ocean, the oxygen minimum zone in the Atlantic

is generally poorly developed in the mesopelagic layer.

Cyanobacteria were found mainly in the euphotic zone where they can perform

photosynthesis. However, few sequences associated to this phylum were also found

42



4.1 Biogeography of prokaryotes.

down to the bathypelagic environment. Thus, the presence of Cyanobacteria

sequences in the bathypelagic is most likely attributable to remains of cells sinking

down e.g. with the faeces of zooplankton (Bruland &amp;amp; Silver, 1981; Caron et al.,

1989).

Marinimicrobia (SAR406) with an average abundance of 6 % of the total mi-

crobial abundance in the Atlantic increased below the deep chlorophyll maximum

in agreement with previous ?ndings (Gordon &amp;amp; Giovannoni, 1996).

The dominance of Proteobacteria has been previously observed (Pham et al.,

2008) with Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria

contributing about 25 %, 24% and 12% of total microbial abundance in marine

ecosystems, in agreement with our ?ndings in this study. Deltaproteobacteria,

including many sulfur and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Kuever et al., 2005), in-

creased with depth, which might indicate more favourable conditions for sulfur

and sulfate-reducing prokaryotes in the deep ocean as compared to the epipelagic

realm.

Archaeal taxa did also show biogeographical distribution patterns. Woe-

searchaeota and Euryarchaeota, the latter in the epipelagic realm and the former

in the lower bathypelagic, presented higher relative abundances towards the lower

latitudes and in the southern station of NAG and the SATL. The dominance of

Euryarchaeota in the epipelagic and a gradual decrease with depth has been

previously described (DeLong et al., 2006; Massana et al., 1997, 1998).

Aigarchaeota and marine hydrothermal vent group (MHVG) showed a similar

distribution, while Thaumarchaeota displayed an opposite pattern, i.e., higher

relative abundances towards the higher latitudes. The presence of MHVG Ar-

chaea in speci?c bathypelagic locations might point to hydrothermal activity

close to these sampling sites, as members of this taxon were initially isolated

from hydrothermal vents (Takai &amp;amp; Horikoshi, 1999). However, the biogeochemi-

cal parameters (Annex 3) and the described local topology of the sea?oor in the

locations where we detected them, several hundreds to thousands of kilometres

away from the Mid Atlantic Ridge or any other active volcanic location (Figures

1.1 and 2.1), do not support a local hydrothermal origin. Thus, the presence of

MHVG could indicate the presence of prokaryotes closely related to this group

but adapted to di?erent environmental conditions. Alternatively, cells from this

43



4. DISCUSSION

group might originate from a plume located several hundreds of kilometers away

and might have been transported to the sampling site, or it could indicate the

in?uence of hydrothermal vents not mapped yet.

The distribution of Thaumarchaeota throughout the Atlantic agrees with pre-

vious studies, and suggests that Thaumarchaeota thrives in the oxygen minimum

layer (Agogué et al., 2008; Beman et al., 2008) where they could be oxidizing

ammonia to support their metabolism (Sintes et al., 2015).

Comparing the communities of Archaea and Bacteria, archaeal community

members seem to have a very well de?ned depth distribution, while for Bacteria

although epi- and mesopelagic communities di?er from bathypelagic communities,

the upper- and lower bathypelagic communities clustered together. Di?erences in

community composition of Archaea were mainly associated to depth, while bacte-

rial community composition was related to oceanic regions. The Arctic bacterial

communities di?ered from the rest of the samples, probably associated to the

nutrient-rich environmental conditions (Winter et al., 2013). The bathypelagic

layer was inhabited by more similar bacterial communities throughout the ocean,

probably due to the more stable and homogeneous environmental conditions (An-

nex 4). The bacterial communities in the equatorial region (WTRA) were more

similar throughout the depth pro?le, as compared to other regions, probably due

to the characteristic upwelling phenomenon in the area, which provides nutrients

and Bacteria from deeper layers to the upper layers of the ocean. A previous

study (Sintes et al., 2015) suggested that these regions, characterized by deep

water mass formation (ARCT and SANT) or upwelling (WTRA), might act as

hot spots for dispersion of microbes in the bathypelagic realm, explaining the

higher similarity between the communities from di?erent depth layers in these

three regions.

4.2 Biogeographical distribution patterns of ni-

trite reductase harbouring prokaryotes

The nirK gene was used as a proxy to characterize the distribution of the group

of prokaryotes reducing nitrite. Archaea harbouring nitrite reductase could be

44



4.3 Modelling

di?erentiated into two groups according to their nirK (Lund et al., 2012), namely

nirKa and nirKb. Nitrite reducing Bacteria also express downstream enzymes

involved in denitri?cation processes (Figure 1.3), while the role of nirK in Archaea

has not yet been completely resolved (Blainey et al., 2011; Hallam et al., 2006;

Walker et al., 2010). It is unknown whether nitrite reduction in Archaea is linked

to energy conservation (Lund et al., 2012) or nitrite detoxi?cation as described

for some Bacteria (Beaumont et al., 2002; Cantera &amp;amp; Stein, 2007).

Both Archaea nirK harbouring communities were depth-strati?ed (Figures 3.5

and 3.6). There was a very strong segregation between the upper bathypelagic,

lower bathypelagic and the meso- and epipelagic communities. This strati?cation

could be associated to the higher nutrient supply rates in the epi- and upper

mesopelagic as compared to bathypelagic waters, favouring the appearance of

archaeal ecotypes as previously described for archaeal ammonia oxidizers (Sintes

et al., 2016).

However, archaeal nirK a harbouring communities from ARCT and SANT

cluster together and do not show depth-strati?cation, in agreement with the bipo-

lar distribution of Thaumarchaeota (Sintes et al., 2015) and with the function of

these locations as hot spot for dispersion of microbes due to deep water mass

formation.

In contrast, bacterial nirK harbouring communities clustered according to

the oceanographic regions (Figure 3.7). Arctic communities from di?erent depth

layers clustered together probably due to the deep water mass formation in this

region as mentioned above (Annex 4).

4.3 Modelling

Most models that try to explain or predict biogeographical distributions of certain

species, they gather information (environmental values) from the observations

with (and sometimes without) the species (in our study, OTUs) present as a

predictor of presence (or absence, respectively), i.e. they compare the values

collected from the previous (e.g. a subset) with the ones observed on other (new)

datasets. If the values on a dataset are close to the samples that had the character

present, then the character is most likely present.

45



4. DISCUSSION

These models have two possible outputs, either they state whether a certain

character is present or absent (binary output) or give a probability of the presence

of the species in a certain point of a dataset. Abundances, however, are not

possible to predict with these models.

Here, we tried to develop a model that would predict the abundance of speci?c

microbial OTUs according to environmental conditions. The model developed did

not perform well with low abundance OTUs, particularly with OTUs present at

only one location and with OTUs that after the rarefaction step were removed.

This low performance was due to the fact that the Mahalonabis distance uses

the inverse of the covariance matrix of the di?erent environmental parameters,

and the calculation does not work with one or fewer points (Mahalanobis, 1936),

therefore dominant species were even more dominant, and rarer species became

even rarer, which may have been the reason why the overall diversity, evenness

and Chao indexes of the predicted values was so low comparing to the observer

data. Also, due to the number of di?erent parameters used to calculate the mul-

tidimensional statistical space, the calculated Mahalonabis distance resulted in a

gross over-estimation of the distance and of the OTU counts in the following steps

as they added a lot of noise in the calculation of this distance. This pitfall makes

di?cult to predict the abundance of OTUs present in extreme environments, i.e.,

present in only one sample where the maximum or minimum values in a set of

parameters occur, such as the samples from higher latitudes or bathypelagic.

Aside from these drawbacks, the patterns in diversity indices calculated from

the model were quite similar to the observations. Aspects that could be improved

in the model would be including ocean circulation models (Bardin et al., 2014), use

of fewer environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen,

silicate, phosphate and nitrate) to extrapolate for the dataset of the World Ocean

Atlas (Levitus &amp;amp; Technical, 2013).
