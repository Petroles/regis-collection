Abstract

Due to the importance of water variables conditions and available food in the development and survival of fish larvae, 
the current research evaluates the effects of two different food treatments (ration + zooplankton and only zooplank-
ton) and water quality in tanks with Brycon orbignyanus larvae. Total water transparency (45 cm) has been mainly 
associated with short residence time, continuous water flow and shallowness. Dissolved oxygen ranged between 1.32 
and 7.00 mg.L–1 in tanks with ration + zooplankton and between 1.82 and 7.60 mg.L–1 in tanks with only zooplankton 
treatments. Nutrients were directly affected by the addition of ration in water, with the exception of nitrite. Ten Rotifera 
species were found represented by high densities, ranging between 8.7 x 105 and 1.3 x 106 org.m–3, throughout the 
experimental period (January to March/1996). Cladocera had the lowest density in the four tanks under analysis and 
ranged between 4.7 x 104 and 2.1 x 105 org.m–3 for the six species. Diaphanosoma birgei has been classified as the most 
frequent species. Since ration + zooplankton produced better larvae yield, this treatment is recommended for Brycon 
orbignyanus larvae.

Qualidade da água e zooplâncton em tanques de larvicultura de  
Brycon orbignyanus (Valenciennes, 1949)

Resumo

Devido à importância das condições das variáveis da água e do alimento disponível no desenvolvimento e sobrevi-
vência das larvas de peixes, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito do uso de dois tratamentos alimentares (ração 
+ zooplâncton e somente zooplâncton) e a qualidade da água, em tanques de larvicultura de Brycon orbignyanus. A 
transparência total da água (45 cm) esteve associada principalmente ao curto tempo de residência, fluxo contínuo e 
baixa profundidade. As concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido variaram de 1,32 a 7,00 mg.L–1 no tratamento contendo 
ração + zooplâncton, e de 1,82 a 7,60 mg.L–1 no tratamento contendo somente zooplâncton. Os nutrientes foram dire-
tamente influenciados pela adição de ração no meio com exceção do nitrito. Rotifera apresentou a maior densidade, 
variando ao longo do período experimental de 8,7 x 105 a 1,3 x 106 org.m–3 entre os quatro tanques estudados, num total 
de dez espécies. A menor densidade foi observada para Cladocera, variando de 4,7 x 104 a 2,1 x 105 org.m–3 num total 
de seis espécies encontradas, sendo Diaphanosoma birgei a única espécie classificada como muito freqüente. O uso de 
ração junto com zooplâncton proporcionou melhor rendimento para larvas de B. orbignyanus.

1. Introduction

A major problem in Brycon orbignyanus produc-
tion is its high mortality rate during the larvae stage and 
during development into the fingerling stage. Feeding 
preference of B. orbignyanus larvae consists of crusta-

cean zooplankton, mainly Cladocera and insect larvae. 
According to Ceccarelli and Senhorini (1996), other fish 
larvae should be placed together with B. orbignyanus 
larvae in order to avoid cannibalism during the incuba-

Tanks were half filled (0.23 m) and kept at the same level 
for 5 days. They were then completed up to 0.45 m and 
water was made to flow continuously through the tanks. 
Larvae were placed in the tanks 2 days after spawning.

B. orbignyanus larvae in the current research origi-
nated from the CEMIG breeding stock. Following pro-
tocols by Woynarovich and Horvath (1985), recently 
hatched tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum (Curvier, 
1818)) were added to the 36 hatcheries to feed the B. 
orbignyanus larvae and prevent cannibalism. Two types 
of food treatments were investigated: one containing ra-
tion + zooplankton (TR) and another containing only 
zooplankton (TN). A supplementary diet containing 19% 
crude protein was given to larvae in TR up to the 20th 
day; a pellet-shape ration, containing 20% crude protein 
(20 kg.d–1), was given as from the next day. The experi-
ment was conducted in duplicate (TN

plankton, and TR

 = ration + zooplankton).

Water samples were analyzed daily, with a 1 L Van 
Dorn bottle during the first week and then every four 
days, in all of the tanks, until the end of experiment. 
Temperature, conductivity and pH were determined 
with Corning temperature meter, Micronal B330 and 
Metrhon Herisau E 488, respectively. Transparency was 
determined by Secchi disk, dissolved oxygen, nitrite, ni-
trate, total phosphorus and orthophosphate were meas-
ured according to Golterman et al. (1978). Ammonia, 
chlorophyll-a, alkalinity and inorganic carbon were de-
termined according to Koroleff (1976), Nush (1980) and 
Mackereth et al. (1978). Residence time was measured 
by the speed of water entrance into the tanks, assessing 
time spent for 2 L water output, expressed in days, need-
ed for the total renewal of water volume in the tanks.

For quantitative and qualitative analysis of zooplank-
ton, samples were obtained with a 58 ?m mesh plank-
ton net and then preserved in 4% formalin. Zooplankton 
organisms were counted in Sedgewick Rafter Cell and 
examined under 100x magnification. Copepoda nauplii 
and copepodids of Argyrodiaptomus furcatus Cowgill 
et al. (1985) and Notodiaptomus iherinig (Wright, 1935); 
were counted together; density data were expressed in 
abundance percentage and individuals.m–3. Frequency 
occurrence was also estimated for total zooplankton or-
ganisms, divided into four classes: class 4 (very frequent, 
from 76 to 100%), class 3 (frequent, between 51 and 
75%), class 2 (moderately frequent, between 26 and 
50%) and class 1 (low frequency, between 1 and 25%). 

Ten fish larvae were measured for total length with a 
graded scale and weighed using a 1g-precision balance. 
Larvae were measured daily during the first week; later, 
they were measured at a four-day interval, until the end 
of the experiment. 

Total length and weight of B. orbignyanus larvae 
were determined by minimum square methods (Santos, 
1978). Growth rates compared by method of treat-
ment were analyzed according to Gabriel’s procedure 
(Sokal and Rohlf, 1981), using simultaneous compari-
sons. Density of zooplankton organisms was evaluated 

tion period. After this phase B. orbignyanus larvae may 
be transported to fishponds, although culture success de-
pends on the type and quantity of zooplankton available 
in the pond, larvae density and water quality. 

Lopes et al. (1994) showed that supply of ration + 
 zooplankton to Brycon cephalus Gunther, 1869 estab-
lished higher survival rates, whereas larvae had high 
growth rates (length and weight) in zooplankton only 
treatment. This fact confirmed the importance of live 
plankton as a basic component for fish initial feed. 

Brycon orbignyanus, commonly known as “pira-
canjuba”, is a species of great interest for fish farmers 
due to its fast growth, food habits (omnivore), easy ad-
aptation to artificial diets, good flesh quality and for its 
use in sport fishing. “Piracanjuba” is an indigenous spe-
cies of the river Paraná basin where it used to be found 
abundantly. However, due to deforestation, pollution and 
impounding, the species has become rare in its natural 
habitat (Mendonça, 1996).

Physical, chemical and biological variables regulate 
the functioning of larvae production tanks. Control of 
the environment culture conditions is currently consid-
ered to be the main factor in production improvement. 
Actually, the latter depends on management approaches, 
on water quality monitoring and on knowledge of the 
species´ feeding habits. 

Great variability in survival, growth and quality of 
hatchery-produced fish larvae is a common and complex 
problem and mass mortalities may occur (Battaglene 
et al., 2005). In spite of some recent encouraging results 
involving dispensed diets for fish larvae, the rearing of 
most freshwater fish species still relies on live food, at 
least up to metamorphosis. Zooplankton groups, such 
as Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera, are preys widely 
used in the rearing of fish larvae (Aragão et al., 2004).

Harvested zooplankton has regularly been used as 
live food for larvae of freshwater fish species. The water 
quality control in larvae tanks and zooplankton as live 
food affect variable growth and larval survival (Evjemo 
et al., 2003).

Given the importance of the water variables condi-
tions and available food in the development and survival 
of fish larvae, the current research evaluates the effects 
of two different food treatments (ration + zooplankton 
and only zooplankton) and water quality in tanks with 
Brycon orbignyanus larvae

2. Materials and Methods

This study was undertaken at the Research Station 
and Environmental Development of Volta Grande 
(CEMIG, MG, Brazil), downstream the Volta Grande 
reservoir, and a water source for CEMIG tanks. Four 
8.49 m2 tanks were populated with Brycon orbignyanus 
larvae, at a density of 94 larvae fish/m2, and were reared 
until the 41st day.

The tanks were left empty for 7 days before the 
experiments and dolomitic lime (MgCO

3
) at 8 kg/tank 

and chicken dung (1000 g.m–2) at 9 kg/tank were added.

centration above 4.25 mg.L–1 occurred starting from the 
11th day, (above 4.25 mg.L–1) with its peak at 7.6 mg.L–1 
on the 27th day, the highest reported value during the 
study period (Figure 1).

Water temperature varied from 27 to 30 °C in the 
four tanks under analysis. Affected by the oligotrophic 
conditions of the reservoir, pH remained acid, with vari-
ations between 5.7 and 6.8 in TR

in TR

 concentrations in TR and TN treatments 

were high due to the acidic pH of the medium and alter-

1975) and significance level for statistical test results 
was p = 0.05.

Although high concentrations of total phosphorus 
and orthophosphate were reported up till the 15th day, 
rates later on decreased to insignificant concentrations. 
Phosphorus concentrations in TR treatment were higher 
and reached a maximum of 847 and 935 ?g.L–1 in TR

1
, 

and TR
2
 tanks respectively. Chlorophyll-a was lower than 

25 ?g.L–1 during the experimental period (Figure 4).
The zooplankton community consisted of 19 taxa 

or rather, 10 Rotifera, 6 Cladocera and 3 Copepoda. 
Table 1 shows their density variations. Although most 
taxa showed low frequencies (class 1), the short resi-
dence time restricted long life span and stimulated the 
short life-cycle of Rotifera. Actually, the latter constitut-

variation similar to bicarbonate with higher concentra-
tions in ration-less treatments, ranged between 11 and 
23 mg.L–1 in TN

, and between 15 and 22 mg.L–1 in TN

when compared to ration treatment with variations from 
8 to 27 mg.L–1 and from 6 to 22 mg.L–1 for treatments

 and TR

, respectively (Figure 2).

Highest ammonium concentrations were reported in 
the treatment with TR

2
 ration (740 ?g.L–1), mainly at the 

start of the experiment and up to the 9th day; later con-
centration rates were similar to nitrite and nitrate ones. 
Throughout the study, nitrogen compounds remained 
low with the exception of registered sudden ammonium 
peaks at the start of the experiment (Figure 3).

cies were, as a rule, reported in treatment TR, Bosmina 
tubicen Brehm, 1953 and Moina sp. were not reported in 
TN treatment. The highest number of individuals, was 
reported in TR 2,010 ind.m–3 (TR

1
) and 2,283 ind.m–3 

(TR
2
), was reported in TR (Table 1).

The highest survival rate (48%) has been observed 
for plankton treatment only (TN

1
); however, the percent-

age was reduced to 20% for TN
2
. Survival rates for TR

1
 

and TR
2
 were 28 and 26%, respectively. 

Weight-length relationship was not significantly 
different (p &gt; 0.05) among the treatments, overlapping 
between intervals (Table 3). The average initial size 
and weight of the larvae in TR tanks were 1.21 cm and 
0.02 g, respectively, and in TN tanks 1.08 cm and 0.02 g 
in TN tanks. During the experimental period, weights 
increased more quickly in tanks with ration. In fact, 

ed the largest number of species and/or genus reported 
(Table 2).

Rotifera were moderately frequent and were mainly 
represented by Asplanchna sp., with 1.5 to 3.8 x 105 
ind.m–3, and by Epiphanes macrourus Barrois and Dady 
(1894), with 3.5 to 6.0 x 105 ind.m–3. Rotifera dominated 
the zooplankton community from the 19th day up till the 
end of the experiment. Copepoda were mostly repre-
sented by nauplii and copepodid, with more than 30 and 
35% in TR, and 47 and 45% in TN. In TR treatment 
Copepoda – nauplii were considered frequent (class 3). 
Cladocera, the least abundant taxa, were represented 
mostly by the species Diaphanosoma birgei (Korineck, 
1981), with over 54%. It was the only species classified 
as class 4, that is, very frequent, during the study period 
(Tables 1 and 2, Figure 5). Although all zooplankton spe-

28 and 32 °C. Total water transparency has been mainly 
associated with short residence time, continuous flow and 
shallowness. These factors associated to a water supply 
from an oligotrophic reservoir, also affected conductivity, 
which remained below 50 ?S.cm–1, frequently reported in 
the Volta Grande reservoir (Rolla et al., 1990). 

Acid pH in tanks affected inorganic carbon com-
pounds with significant rates of free CO

2
. According 

to Gomes (1997), acid pH in larviculture tanks nega-
tively affected both the survival and the development of 
 B. c ephalus larvae.

Nutrients in water were affected by feed treatment. 
Due to the feed decomposition and the consequent in-

the larvae reached a final average weight and length of 
8.58 g and 9.06 g, and 8.34 and 8.76 cm for TR

1
 and 

TR
2
, respectively. Results from ration-less tanks (TN) 

were lower, final average weights and lengths were 1.43 
and 1.72 g and 4.91 and 5 cm, respectively.

4. Discussion

Water temperature in shallow artificial ponds is di-
rectly affected by solar radiation. During the experimental 
period temperature values were within normal limits suit-
able for the breeding of Brycon orbignyanus. According 
to Kubtiza (1998), adequate temperature for tropical 
fish ranges between 20 and 30 °C, with its best between

which triggered the re-suspension of the sediment. 
Furthermore, phosphorus compounds of food affect its 
availability in the environment: greater loss occurs when 
food has a low conversion. Whereas nitrogen depends on 
several factors, fish excretion rates depend on the food 
rate, digestibility and availability (Pillary, 1992).

Low chlorophyll-a concentration may be associated 
with the water short residence time which will have re-
stricted a long permanence of phytoplankton biomass in 
the ponds. This fact influenced the low dissolved oxygen 
concentrations due to the fact that oxygen consumption 
and phytoplankton production were more important than 
diffusion processes. According to Gomes et al. (2000), 
Brycon can survive in water with low levels of dissolved 
oxygen.

Short residence time in ponds affected directly the 
zooplankton community, characterized by low species 
diversity. However, short life-span organisms, such as 
Rotifera, were ecologically better adapted to unforeseen 
changes of the environment and, in the long run, become 
dominant. Probably associated with higher availability 
of nutrients in culture tanks, Rotifera represented more 

corporation of these elements into the water column by 
algal biomass, the concentration of nutrients in TR tanks 
was higher. Since movement stirred by water input and 
output in tanks causes more active nitrification, lower ni-
trite concentrations were reported when the latter were 
compared to nitrate and ammonia concentration rates. 

Sipaúba-Tavares et al. (2000) also reported low ni-
trite and high nitrate concentrations in tilapia tanks with 
water renewal. This fact demonstrated not only absorp-
tion of the element by phytoplankton but also activities 
of nitrifying bacteria in fishponds.

Since higher concentrations of orthophosphate and 
total phosphorus occurred in TR treatments, the direct 
effect of inert feed on the dynamics of nutrients has been 
indicated. Avnimelech (1998) verified that in earthen 
carp ponds 20% of phosphorus and 25% of nitrogen 
were recovered when fish were harvested. The remain-
ing percentage was accumulated in sediments or became 
available in the water column. 

Water mass circulation was also affected by nutrient 
availability, which in turn was influenced by the continu-
ous water flow and by the management of fish  harvesting,

than 50% of the organisms found in the experiment and 
were more abundant in TR treatment. High Rotifera den-
sity has been associated with the capacity of organisms 
to adapt themselves quickly to environmental disrup-
tion and perturbation. In fact, prevalence in physically 
unstable systems, such as fishponds, has been the trend 
(Sipaúba-Tavares and Colus, 1997).

According to Sendacz and Kubo (1982), Calanoida-
Copepoda is more abundant than Cladocera in oligo-
trophic waters, a characteristic of the water supplied to 
the tanks. Lower abundance of Cladocera in tanks may 
be associated with predation by B. orbygnianus larvae, 
which prefer zooplankton crustaceans, mainly Cladocera 
(Ceccarelli and Senhorini, 1996). In their study on sur-
vival, growth and trophic dynamics in “piracanjuba” lar-
vae tanks, Senhorini and Fransozo (1998) verified that 
Cladocera were preferentially ingested by the larvae 

Coupled to predation, high water transparency, low 
temperatures and water flow are unfavorable factors to 
Cladocera in fish tanks (Sipaúba-Tavares and Colus, 
1997). Cladocera were more abundant only at the start 
of the experimental period when water temperature was

high. Although Diaphanosoma birgei was the only dom-
inant one among Cladocera, it was also the only zoo-
plankton species classified as frequent in the tanks.

According to Pereira et al. (2004), predominance 
of Diaphanosoma birgei in fish tanks is associated with 
continuous water flow, low dissolved oxygen and high 
phosphorus rates. High phosphorus rates in TR

2
 affected 

the high species density observed, since it represented 
88.6% of all Cladocera reported. 

The water supply of the culture tanks came from an 
oligotrophic reservoir and directly affected the Copepoda 
community. In fact, the two Diaptomidae species, 
Notodiaptomus iheringi and Argyrodiaptomus furcatus, 
were the most abundant. Thermocyclops decipiens, char-
acteristic of mesotrophic and eutrophic environments 
(Sendacz and Kubo, 1982), represented a single occur-
rence of a Cyclopoida species.

Zooplankton fluctuations are triggered by several 
factors such as temperature, light and dark periods, water 
quality, food availability, competition and predation. In 
fish hatcheries, management may also modify the repro-
ductive cycles of these organisms and population succes-
sion (Sipaúba-Tavares and Colus, 1997).

Survival rates were low. Whereas only in treatment 
TN

1
 a 48% survival occurred, survival rates were lower 

than 28% in the other tanks. Lopes et al. (1994) dem-
onstrated that supply of zooplankton plus ration caused 
higher survival rates for Brycon cephalus. 

According to Battaglene et al. (2005), Rotifera were 
a likely source of bacterial load to larval striped trum-
peter (Latris lineata) in tanks. Moreover, Evjemo et al. 
(2003) verified that total protein in Calanoida-Copepoda 
was higher than 50% of dry weight than that of Rotifera. 
In the current experiment, Rotifera reached high den-
sities and Copepoda, low densities. These factors may 
be influenced by growth and survival results of Brycon 
 orbignyanus larvae. Quantity and quality of available 
food and the control of the culture water variations di-
rectly affected the survival and performance of fish lar-
vae. 

Since there was no difference between growth rates 
within the weight-length relationship, condition fac-
tors of larvae in the treatments were similar (p &gt; 0.05). 
Condition factors showed the fish well-being within a 
certain environment and were associated with conditions 
in the allometric equation y = axb, adjusted to weight and 
length data (Braga, 1997).

Pronounced fluctuation of organisms in Rotifera-
dominant tanks has been reported, followed by Copepoda 
and Cladocera. Fluctuation in shallow artificial fish cul-
ture systems are probably associated with water flow, 
quantity of available food, chemical and physical chang-
es of water and biological interactions including preda-
tion and competition. Zooplankton was thus affected by 
short life-span water residence which favored opportun-
ist species, such as Rotifera, and affected the survival of 
B. orbignyanus larvae in tanks.

Results indicate some management recommenda-
tions can be applied in the larvae culture station of Volta 
Grande (CEMIG) so that the survival of B. orbignyanus 
larvae may be increased:

1) Water flow decrease in tanks in order to retain 
phytoplankton biomass and consequently to 
increase the quantity and quality of zooplankton 
organisms; water turbidity caused by planktonic 
organisms increases, light penetration is reduced 
and dissolved oxygen in the tanks is increased. 

2) Since the ration + zooplankton treatment (TR) 
showed better results, this treatment should be 
recommended for Brycon orbignyanus larvae.

3) Deeper ponds may be used, since these systems 
are directly affected by local climate. 

4) In this study, water in the tanks was supplied by 
an oligotrophic reservoir characterized by low 
plankton densities; consequently, tank construction 
with the sole aim to cultivate zooplankton as 
a food reserve for B. orbignyanus larvae is 
recommended.
