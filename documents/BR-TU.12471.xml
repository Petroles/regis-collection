resumo 
 
 

Com o intuito de estudar as principais vias de transporte de sedimentos finos 
recentes na zona central da margem continental Oeste Portuguesa, 
parâmetros geoquímicos, mineralógicos e granulométricos foram analisados 
em sedimentos superficiais e em matéria particulada colhida em armadilhas de 
sedimentos e integrados com observações da hidrodinâmica de fundo. Os 
parâmetros geoquímicos foram também estudados na coluna de sedimentos 
depositada nos últimos 150 anos e em sedimentos pré-industriais. Os referidos 
parâmetros determinados foram: concentrações elementares, isótopos 
estáveis de Pb, teores em materiais litogénicos, carbonato de cálcio e carbono 
orgânico. Os canhões de Lisboa-Setúbal e Cascais tiveram especial destaque 
no presente estudo dado que, até à data, encontram-se menos estudados que 
o Canhão da Nazaré. Os resultados mostram que a distribuição de sedimentos 
na zona central da margem ocidental Portuguesa é particionada pelos canhões 
e que a exportação de sedimentos da plataforma para zonas mais profundas 
da margem é restringida pelas correntes do talude, excepto onde os canhões 
funcionam como corredores para o transporte de sedimentos. Enquanto no 
Canhão de Lisboa-Setúbal, e provavelmente no Canhão de Cascais, o 
transporte de sedimentos até à zona inferior é limitada, provavelmente apenas 
despoletado por eventos de elevada energia, no Canhão da Nazaré o 
transporte ao longo do todo o canhão parece eficiente. As zonas superiores 
dos canhões de Lisboa-Setúbal e Cascais presentemente actuam como 
armadilhas de sedimentos finos, aprisionando partículas em suspensão 
provenientes da plataforma adjacente. A introdução directa de sedimentos 
provenientes das plumas dos rios Tejo e Sado nas zonas superiores dos 
canhões parece limitada, contudo a resuspensão dos sedimentos do prodelta 
do Tejo como resultado de ondas de tempestade e ondas de maré interna 
permite o transporte de sedimentos para os canhões adjacentes. Na 
plataforma de Lisboa-Setúbal-Sines foram identificadas as assinaturas 
geoquímicas e mineralógicas de diferentes fontes de sedimentos finos (e.g. 
estuários do Tejo e Sado, arribas costeiras, lagoas de St. André e Melides). As 
concentrações elementares pré-industriais são muito semelhantes nos 
canhões da Nazaré e Lisboa-Setúbal, mas variados graus de enriquecimento 
antrópico de metais traço estão presentes nos sedimentos recentes. A mais 
acentuada influência antrópica na última área referida é consistente com a sua 
proximidade a áreas densamente povoadas e industrializadas e com input de 
sedimentos originários dos rios Tejo e Sado, potenciais transportadores de 
partículas poluentes. A dispersão de Pb atmosférico parece também 
significativa sendo que toda a zona da plataforma continental adjacente aos 
canhões de Lisboa-Setúbal e Cascais apresenta-se enriquecida. A principal 
fonte de Pb antrópico identificada através de isótopos estáveis de Pb é 
consistente com a assinatura das cinzas de incineradoras. No Canhão de 
Lisboa a imersão de dragados contaminados parece ser também uma 
potencial importante fonte de metais traço antropogénicos.

abstract 
 

In order to study the main pathways of recent fine sediment transport in the 
central area of the west Portuguese continental margin between the Nazaré 
Canyon and Cape Sines, geochemical, mineralogical and grain size 
parameters were analysed in surface sediments and sediment trap particulate 
material. This data was integrated with observations on near-bottom 
hydrodynamics and sediment dispersal. The sediment column deposited over 
the last 150 yrs and pre-industrial sediments were studied for the geochemical 
parameters. The determined geochemical parameters include elemental 
concentrations, stable Pb isotopes, contents of lithogenic material, calcium 
carbonate and organic carbon. The Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons 
received special attention in this study as these structures have had much less 
attention than the Nazaré Canyon. The results show that sediment distribution 
on the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by submarine canyons and 
export of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental margin is restricted by 
slope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-slope 
transport. While in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, and probably in the Cascais 
Canyon, down-canyon transport of sediments to the lower canyon is limited, 
conceivably only triggered by high energy events, in the Nazaré Canyon down-
canyon sediment transport seems efficient. The upper reaches of the Lisbon-
Setúbal and Cascais canyons presently act as traps for fine-grained sediments 
entrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf. Direct sediment input from the 
Tagus and Sado river plumes into the upper canyons seems limited. However, 
resuspension of sediments from the Tagus prodelta as a result of storm waves 
and internal tidal waves seems enough for an efficient transport of sediments 
into the upper Lisbon and Cascais canyons. In the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines 
continental shelf geochemical and mineralogical signatures from various fine 
sediment sources were identified (e.g. Tagus and Sado estuaries, sea-cliffs, St. 
André and Melides lagoons). The contribution of trace metals from 
anthropogenic sources was assessed by comparing present-day and average 
elemental concentrations for the industrial period with pre-industrial baseline 
values. Baseline elemental concentrations are very similar for the Nazaré and 
Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, but varying degrees of anthropogenic trace metal 
enrichments are recorded in more recent sediments. Enhanced anthropogenic 
influence in the latter area is consistent with its proximity to heavily populated 
and industrialized areas and with sediment input originated from the Tagus and 
Sado rivers, potential major carriers of pollutant particles (Pb, Zn and Cu). 
Atmospheric dispersal of Pb seems important as well in the Lisbon-Setúbal-
Sines margin and virtually all the studied continental shelf adjacent to the 
Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons shows enrichment of Pb. The main 
source of anthropogenic Pb identified through Pb stable isotope signatures 
seems to be incinerator fly ashes. Discharge of dredged contaminated 
sediments in the Lisbon Canyon appears also as a potentially important source 
of anthropogenic trace metals.

Structure of the thesis 

The thesis here presented is organised in four parts and eight chapters. 

 

Part I (Introduction, Regional Setting and Materials and Methods) – Includes three 

introductory chapters which provide scientific and regional backgrounds, and describe the 

materials and methods used. 

Chapter 1 presents a state-of-art about the recent developments on the knowledge 

of continental margins and the special focus of EU-Projects on submarine canyons and 

their roles in transferring particulate matter to the deep sea. The objectives of the present 

thesis are also presented. 

Chapter 2 is intended to be a characterisation of the submarine canyons from the 

western Portuguese margin. The surrounding areas of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais 

canyons (adjacent continental margin, beaches, and river basins) are also described in 

terms of geomorphology, geology, oceanography and climate. 

In Chapter 3 the materials (core, trap and grab sediment samples) and methods 

(geochemistry, mineralogy and grain size of sediments; mass deposition fluxes, sediment 

accumulation rates and near-bed hydrodynamic data) used for the present study are 

presented. 

 

Part II (Continental shelf and upper slope) – Results about the continental shelf are 

presented and discussed in two chapters. 

Chapter 4 is focused on mineralogical parameters determined in surface sediments 

from the shelf/upper slope and its discussion deals mainly with using these parameters to 

identify the main sources of fine-grained sediments and to gain insight in prevailing 

dispersal processes acting on the shelf. 

Chapter 5 presents elemental contents of surface sediments from the shelf/upper 

slope and its discussion is focused on trace metal dispersal in surface sediment and its 

relationships with pathways of recent sediment transport in the shelf. 

 

Part III (Submarine canyons and open slope) – Results about submarine canyons and 

open slopes of the central Portuguese margin are presented and discussed in two 

chapters. 

In Chapter 6 near-bottom hydrodynamic data and sedimentological data (general 

composition, grain size, Corg/N ratios and mineralogy) from surface and sediment trap 



 2 

material collected throughout the canyon are integrated in order to understand the recent 

sedimentary dynamics of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon system. Data from the Nazaré and 

Cascais canyons and from the open slope areas of Mondego, Estremadura and Sines are 

also presented in order to obtain an overview about the pathways of recent fine-grained 

sediment transport on the central Portuguese margin, with especial focus on the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon.   

Chapter 7 presents geochemical data from surface and sediment trap material so as 

to determine anthropogenic inputs of trace metals. The knowledge of specific signatures 

and its dispersion will give insight into sedimentary processes operating on the central 

Portuguese margin, again with especial focus on the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon.  

 

Part IV (Data integration and conclusions) – In this part, composed of one chapter, 

data from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines continental shelf and Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais 

submarine canyons are integrated, the main conclusions from the thesis are summarised 

and proposals for future investigations are indicated. 

Chapter 8 is intended to integrate data from the four last chapters so as to build a 

model for the main pathways of fine-grained sediments in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and 

adjacent shelf area.

1.1. Continental margins: main sedimentary processes 

Continental margins form relatively narrow transition zones between continental land 

masses and deep-ocean basins. They are the main regions of input and transfer of 

particulate matter to the oceans and, as such, they represent important zones of 

particulate matter flux. 

The continental margin is made up of the shallow, relatively flat continental shelf, 

bordered by an inclined continental slope, at the base of which there is often a wedge 

shaped accumulation of sediments, the continental rise. The continental shelf, which 

depending on the geological setting may span from few to hundred kilometres wide, can 

roughly be subdivided in three other areas: inner shelf (10 - 50 m WD), middle shelf (50 - 

100 m WD) and outer shelf (100 - 200 m WD). 

1.1.1. Continental shelves 

The continental shelf is generally an area where material derived from the continent 

is initially deposited, although it commonly only represents a temporary resting place for 

sediments. On the shelf there are two main directions of transport of particulate matter: 

along-shelf and across-shelf transport. The magnitude of along-shelf particulate transport 

is usually much greater than that of across-shelf transport. Across-shelf transport can be 

important near capes and canyons, diverting flows across the shelf more effectively than 

other physical mechanisms. 

Particulate transport in both the along-shelf and across-shelf dimension is driven 

almost entirely by water motions. The surf zone (traditionally not included in the 

continental shelf) is the area where the highest volumes of sediment move alongshore. 

The dominant mechanism envisaged in alongshore transport in the surf zone is movement 

of sediment by longshore-directed currents generated by oblique waves. Since most wave 

energy dissipation takes place in the surf zone, this is a zone where both suspended load 

and bedload longshore transport takes place.  

Comparably lower but still considerable volumes of sediment move alongshore on the 

shelf immediately seaward of the surf zone. Sediment transport in the inner shelf and 

further offshore is primarily wind-driven (Savidge &amp;amp; Bane Jr., 2001) and highly dependent

on sediment availability, topography and geology. Additionally, tidal currents have been 

identified as responsible for significant longshore transport of sediments. 

The flow regimes of continental shelves vary appreciably as water depth changes 

from shore to shelfbreak. Not only do flow velocities change across the shelf, but so do 

the relative importance of various types of flows. The mechanisms that contribute most to 

across-shelf particulate transport are: 1) wind-driven upwelling and downwelling flows; 2) 

internal waves; 3) wave-orbital flows; 4) infragravity oscillations; 5) buoyant plumes 

(positive and negative); and 6) surf zone (wave driven) processes. Most of the above 

driving processes are bidirectional and therefore capable of reversing direction of 

transport. A review on the processes affecting transport of particles across continental 

shelves can be consulted, for example, in Nittrouer &amp;amp; Wright (1994).  

 

1.1.2. Continental slope and rise 

Once on the slope, material exported from the shelf is subject to further transport 

under influence of a variety of across-slope, along-slope and hemipelagic processes 

(Figure 1.1). Continental margin systems are likely to include all three components, albeit 

in differing proportions in space and time. It is important not only to recognize the 

interaction of these processes, but also to appreciate their variation in magnitude, and 

their frequency (Evans et al., 1998).

1. Introduction

On short time scale, across-slope sediment transport is often dominated by 

bidirectional tidal currents, moving sediment both in upslope and downslope direction. 

Internal tides are an efficient driver of sediment transport, especially in the deep and 

narrow upper reaches of canyons where tidal currents are focused. On longer time scales, 

however, across slope transport is predominantly in downslope direction, driven by 

gravitational forces that continuously or episodically move sediment downslope over the 

sea floor into deeper water. They range in scale from minor creep to major translational 

slides, and may take place on a range of timescales. Sediment creep is a semi-continuous 

process caused by load-induced stress, whereas discrete debris flows, slumps and slides 

may occur episodically, in between long periods of relative quiescence. Mass wasting 

events may last from minutes to hours. Turbidity currents are another type of frequent 

downslope event and they are sediment-laden water moving down a slope through water. 

The current moves because it has a higher density (and turbidity) than the fluid through 

which it flows. Turbidity currents may flow for hours (high-density flows) up to days (low-

density). During any single downslope event these various processes may operate 

together or in temporal sequence, slumps often disintegrating into debris flows and then 

into turbidity currents. Continental margins subject to frequent downslope activity are 

commonly characterised by slope aprons and submarine fans (Stow, 1986). 

Bottom-current activity greatly influences both sediment accumulation and erosion on 

continental slopes. The effects of along-slope currents (contour-following, deep, 

geostrophic currents) are particularly marked on slopes and basin plains within and 

adjacent to continental margins, where a variable sea-floor bathymetry may locally 

intensify and focus current activity. Sediment drifts and associated bedforms are the 

characteristic depositional product of along-slope bottom currents, and commonly 

accumulate where there is a change in the gradient of the seabed, such as at the base of 

continental slopes. Where particularly strong, bottom currents may cause erosion of the 

seabed and the formation of channels, moats and furrows (Evans et al., 1998). 

Hemipelagic sedimentation includes the settling of pelagic as well as land-derived 

material. Although commonly represented as a vertical flux, the settling velocity of the 

very fine-grained bulk of hemipelagic sediment is usually far less than the velocity of 

prevailing horizontal currents, and the resulting flux is therefore nearer to horizontal than 

to vertical. Hemipelagites, formed by hemipelagic sedimentation, are poorly sorted, 

predominantly fine-grained sediments, with variable composition according to the 

contribution from pelagic and terrestrial sources. They are commonly devoid of primary

sedimentary structures other than lamination, although lamination is usually thoroughly 

reworked by bioturbation. Their study is important because hemipelagic sedimentation is 

the primary “background” process on margins. 

The various processes operating in the continental shelf and slope need to be 

integrated to produce a model of margin development. The characteristics, sources and 

fate of particulate matter in the sea are of great interest for other reasons than those 

related to sedimentology only. Two examples would be the dispersion of contaminants 

(Puig et al., 1999) and the nourishment of benthic ecosystems (Pfannkuche, 1993; Cartes 

et al., 2002). A holistic approach is therefore needed in order to understand the complex 

environments found on the continental margins. 

 

1.2. Continental margins and submarine canyons: the state of art 

In the past decades, several major multidisciplinary studies have been conducted all 

over the world to examine the processes and extent of exchange between the continental 

shelf, slope and deep sea. 

A holistic approach is necessary in these complex dynamic settings moulded by the 

interplay of biology, physics, geochemistry and sedimentology. 

The first great multidisciplinary effort was conducted in the Mid-Atlantic Bight on the 

eastern US continental shelf and slope during the SEEP-I (1983-1984) and SEEP-II (1988-

1989) projects (Biscaye et al., 1988, 1994). The overall SEEP working hypothesis was that 

a large part of the organic particulate matter that is formed on or introduced to the shelf 

and not consumed there is not deposited and buried on the shelf but transported further 

seaward, to the adjacent slope and open ocean. The results of the project SEEP-II led to 

reject that hypothesis. The experiment revealed that only a small proportion (&lt;&amp;lt;5 %) of 

this organic matter was exported to the adjacent slope (Biscaye et al., 1994), and much 

of the exported organic matter may have initially been deposited on the shelf or shelf 

break and resuspended and transported down-slope thousands of years later (Anderson 

et al., 1994). Most of the biogenic particulate matter is recycled on the shelf and only the 

most refractory (particulate) organic matter is likely to be exported (Bacon et al., 1994). 

De Haas et al. (2002) reviewed several studies on continental shelves of the world 

and concluded that large areas of the world shelves do not show any accumulation of 

organic matter under present-day conditions. Only locally, where hydrological and 



1. Introduction

sedimentological conditions are favourable for organic matter accumulation, considerable 

amounts of organic carbon are buried, mainly where rivers introduce large amounts of 

fine-grained sediments and organic matter on the shelf, for example the Amazon River. 

For most continental shelves, de Haas et al. (2002) depicted the following scenario: once 

the fine-grained sediments associated with the organic carbon reach the shelf, a 

continuum of bioturbation and cycles of erosion, transport and redeposition takes place 

under the influence of tidal and large scale shelf currents and storm induced waves and 

currents. After several cycles of successive exposition to oxic and anoxic conditions, most 

of the organic matter is mineralised; the sediments with the more refractory remainder of 

the organic matter reach their final destination and become buried. 

It is important to bear in mind that the SEEP experiments focused on the processes 

taking place across the open slopes, largely avoiding submarine canyons. 

Partly concurrent with the SEEP effort, the interdisciplinary ECOMARGE project 

(1986-1988) (Monaco et al., 1990a) based in the Gulf of Lions did recognise the 

importance of canyons in the shelf-slope exchange. It was noted that export of material 

preferentially occurred down the canyon systems, notably the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon 

(Monaco et al., 1990b). The project ECOFER (1989-1991) (based on the Cap Ferret 

Canyon) also showed preferential focusing of particulate matter in a submarine canyon 

incising the slope of the southeastern Bay of Biscay (Monaco et al., 1999a). 

SEEP-I &amp;amp; II, ECOMARGE and subsequent multidisciplinary projects like KEEP (1989-

1994), OMEX I (1993-1996) II (1997-2000), or FRUELA (1995-1996), concluded that 

organic particle flux to the slope is mainly supplied by lateral transport from the shelf and 

upper slope rather than by pelagic settling. Other authors reached the same conclusion 

from the deficit found between the vertical flux of organic matter and the energy and 

material requirements of the benthos (e.g. Thomsen, 1999; Druffel &amp;amp; Robinson, 1999). In 

other words, the concept of a “biological pump” dominated by vertical processes, as 

conceived in open oceans, seems not applicable to ocean margin settings, where 

resuspension and lateral advection are major drivers of particle transport. 

Another key finding of these projects was the importance of the along-shelf and 

along-slope transport driven by the general circulation, as opposed to processes that 

transport material offshore, which tend to be less common and focused in specific areas 

(Monaco et al., 1999b); this does not imply that offshore transport (e.g. upwelling 

processes) may not have major impact on particulate fluxes in specific areas of the globe. 



1. Introduction 

 10 

With regards to the carbon cycle, the relatively limited export of organic particulate 

matter from the continental shelf to the slope and beyond found in the SEEP projects, has 

later been confirmed in other margins of the world. After all, the SEEP results identified a 

mid-slope depocentre of organic carbon, whereas the OMEX-I project, found no obvious 

depocentre of organic carbon in the northern Bay of Biscay margin (Wollast &amp;amp; Chou, 

2001). However, Wollast &amp;amp; Chou (2001) added to that conclusion that the possible role 

and importance of submarine canyons for the transportation of organic carbon to the 

slope had not been addressed in OMEX-I. This point was explored and confirmed in 

OMEX-II, namely in the Nazaré Canyon (Van Weering et al., 2002). High sedimentation 

rates (Schmidt et al., 2001) and high burial efficiencies of organic carbon (Epping et al., 

2002) and reactive phosphorus (Van der Zee et al., 2002) were encountered in the 

Nazaré Canyon sediments. The role of this canyon in the formation and offshore 

channelling of thick nepheloid layers was also highlighted (McCave &amp;amp; Hall, 2002).  

A workshop on the role and functioning of canyons held in Sitges (Spain) in 2002 

revealed that only few of the canyons across the NW Mediterranean and NE Atlantic 

European margin had been mapped and sampled in detail, and that transport processes 

and mass fluxes of particles, including organic matter, anthropogenic substances and 

urban waste to the deep sea and their sites of final deposition were virtually unknown 

(Van Weering &amp;amp; Weaver, 2007). 

As a consequence of the above, submarine canyons dissecting the European 

continental margins were one of the main targets of the EC-EUROSTRATAFORM (2002-

2005) and HERMES projects (2005-2009). The EUROSTRATAFORM was the first EU-

project specifically looking at different submarine canyons from the European margins 

with the objective of understanding their role in ocean margin strata formation. This 

project aimed to understand sedimentary systems from source to sink. A key aim was to 

gain a better understanding of how sediment particles are transported from river mouths, 

across the shallow shelf and/or through submarine canyons, down to the deep sea. By 

studying different areas of the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean margins, it was possible to 

gain an idea on how these sedimentary systems work in different regional settings. 

In April 2005 a new EU-project started with a different point of view. HERMES 

(Hotspots Ecosystems Research on the Margins of European Seas) was designed to gain 

new insights into the biodiversity, structure, functioning and dynamics of marine 

ecosystems along Europe’s deep-ocean margin. It represented the first major attempt to 

investigate and understand deep-water ecosystems and their environment in an 



1. Introduction 

 11

integrated way by bringing together expertise in biodiversity, geology, sedimentology, 

microbiology, physical oceanography and biogeochemistry. Submarine canyons were 

again one of the main study areas in focus on this project. This time the goal was more 

ambitions since it was not only about investigating the driving forces that control ocean 

margin strata formation but also the ecosystems associated (Weaver et al., 2004). 

 

1.2.1. Submarine canyons: conducts for across-margin transference of 

particulate matter 

Submarine canyons, incisions of up to hundreds of meters below the level of the 

surrounding continental shelves and slopes, may constitute a significant alternative to the 

scenario depicted by De Haas et al. (2002). The focusing and channelling effect of 

submarine depressions may allow an important fraction of the labile organic matter to 

reach the open ocean, bypassing the slow pathway and subsequent intense 

remineralisation characteristic of non-dissected, gently sloping margins. This might 

translate into a greater percentage of labile organic matter to fuel deep sea food webs, 

and also in a larger amount of carbon sequestered from exchange with the atmosphere. 

This rapid lateral transfer of organic matter is especially important in a semi-enclosed sea 

as the Mediterranean, where the high thermal stability of deep waters promotes rapid 

degradation of organic matter. 

Submarine canyons have often been regarded as relics of glacial periods of lowered 

sea-level, when voluminous quantities of sediment were carried by rivers right across 

what are now continental shelves (Pickering et al., 1989). Flooding of the continental 

shelves after the last glacial period decoupled continental drainage systems from 

depocentres on the slope, and consequently the sedimentary regime on continental slopes 

has shifted from a situation dominated by turbidity currents to another regime dominated 

by hemipelagic deposition (Nelson, 1976; Thorbjarnarson et al., 1986). Sediment supply 

to the continental slope and the role of submarine canyons as pathways of sediments to 

the deep-sea floor, have both been drastically reduced. However, there is evidence that, 

even with the present high sea-level stand, many submarine canyons of the world’s 

continental margins continue to channel and/or accumulate substantial quantities of 

sediment and therefore organic matter (e.g. Puig &amp;amp; Palanques, 1998a; Lewis &amp;amp; Barnes, 



1. Introduction 

 12 

1999; Van Weering et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2002; Paull et al., 2003; De Stigter et al., 

2007b). 

One of the main contributions from the EUROSTRATAFORM was that at the present 

climatically controlled high sea-level stand, the majority of the finer grained material 

transported into the canyons is retained largely in the upper and middle part of the 

canyons (1500–3000 m water depth) and these parts of the canyons act as a temporary 

buffer for the storage of sediment and carbon (Van Weering &amp;amp; Weaver, 2007). 

Modern sedimentation rates (e.g. Carpenter et al., 1982; Sanchez-Cabeza et al., 

1999; Schmidt et al., 2001, Van Weering et al., 2002; Turchetto et al., 2007) and 

downward particulate matter fluxes (e.g. Puig &amp;amp; Palanques, 1998a; Monaco et al., 1999b; 

Hung et al., 2003; De Stigter et al., 2007b) have been found much higher in many 

submarine canyons than on the adjacent open slopes. 

Many canyons continue to be favourable sites for the concentration of fine-grained 

sediments, whereas some of them are able to tap on abundant terrigenous sediment 

supplies, namely those that head off large rivers. In certain cases the canyon enters the 

river mouth, forming a continuum with the river bed, as for example the Sepik Canyon 

(Walsh &amp;amp; Nittrouer, 2003) or the Zaire Canyon (Khripounoff et al., 2003). 

However, proximity to a river is not a prerequisite for canyons to be active. On 

narrow, tectonically active margins, canyons have cut headward across the continental 

shelf, intercepting the sediment transported by along-shore currents (Lewis &amp;amp; Barnes, 

1999). For example, the Nazaré Canyon (central Portuguese margin) is remote from any 

major stream, but as the canyon crosses the full length of the continental shelf and 

virtually reaches the shore, substantial amounts of material transported by the along-shelf 

currents are trapped in the canyon. Exports of material from the shelf to the deeper 

canyon is testified by thick nepheloid layers observed throughout the upper and middle 

canyon (McCave et al. 2001), and strong downward fluxes of sandy sediments and 

terrestrial plants debris observed at 3200 m water depth near the bottom (Martín et al., 

2004). In the canyon below 2700 m water depth most of the suspended sediments settle 

and are only transported to the lower canyon by sediment gravity flows occurring on a 

yearly or longer timescale (De Stigter et al., 2007b). 

Also for the Cap Ferret Canyon on the southern Bay of Biscay margin, Mulder et al. 

(2001) proved that turbidity currents are occurring in present times, despite the absence 

of a direct connection with an important fluvial sediment source. 



1. Introduction 

 13

Thus, while some canyons act as passive depocentres for the particles entering them 

via hemipelagic settling (Hickey et al., 1986; Carson et al., 1986), others are able to 

convey the particulate matter further to deeper water, acting as preferential conduits for 

matter transfer to deeper domains (Gardner, 1989; Puig &amp;amp; Palanques, 1998a; Hung et al., 

2003). 

Inside canyons, particulate matter can be transported through nepheloid layers 

generated by tidal or residual currents (Gardner, 1989; Puig &amp;amp; Palanques, 1998b; Van 

Weering et al., 2002), but also, turbidity currents, slumping from the walls, and other 

gravitational processes have been described in contemporary submarine canyons (May et 

al., 1983; Ferentinos et al., 1985; Xu et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007b). 

Turbidity currents flowing along the canyon axis are known to occur in present times, 

and are documented either indirectly (for a review cf. Nisbet and Piper, 1998), or shortly 

before the measuring instruments were broken down or dragged away by the violent 

currents (Paull et al., 2003 and Khripounoff et al., 2003). A successful in situ observation 

of contemporary turbidity currents was achieved by Xu et al. (2002) in the Monterey 

Canyon. Aside from these extraordinary events, observations in the Eel Canyon have 

demonstrated that sediment gravity flows of lesser magnitude but higher frequency may 

constitute an important agent in the effective across-margin transport of sediments in 

canyons receiving large amounts of sediment (Puig et al., 2003, 2004). 

The role of a canyon as a trap or a channel for sediments may differ according to the 

time-scale considered, due to redistribution processes operating on different time-scales. 

This is a critical point, since the net transport in these environments may be largely 

event-driven. Thus, observations within a small temporal window may lead to ambiguous 

mean fluxes, either dominated by exceptional events, or on the contrary, reflecting the 

“normal” conditions of relative quiescence, missing single events that may overwhelm, in 

terms of net fluxes, the cumulative values between events (Martín, 2005). 

 

The modifications of water circulation associated to topographic features such as 

canyons have important implications for marine ecosystems. By altering the main 

currents, they affect biomass patterns (Masó &amp;amp; Duarte, 1989; Sabatés et al., 1989), 

composition of phytoplankton assemblages (Estrada et al., 1999), and distribution of fish 

larvae due to inshore-offshore exchange of water masses (Olivar et al., 1988; Sabatés &amp;amp; 

Masó, 1990). 



1. Introduction 

 14 

Unfortunately, canyons are also prone to transport and accumulate pollution (e.g. 

trace metals, Palanques et al., 2008 and Jesus et al., 2010; pesticides, Paull et al., 2002; 

or litter, Galgani et al., 1996), which further raises the need for research and protection. 

The current multidisciplinary European project HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem 

Research and Man's Impact On European Seas) envisages to give answer to questions 

regarding the ecology of submarine canyons, along with various other continental margin 

ecosystems, and also to focus on the impacts made by human activities on these 

ecosystems. 

 

As a conclusion, one may notice that submarine canyons are complex systems in 

terms of hydrography, sedimentology, biogeochemistry and biology and great variability 

occurs both within individual canyon systems and between different canyons. Individual 

canyons have very different environmental characteristics that determine the diversity and 

the ecology of their fauna. 

 

1.3. Objectives of the present study 

In various EU-projects (OMEX-II, EUROSTRATAFORM and HERMES) the Nazaré 

Canyon on the Portuguese margin was an area of specific interest and as a consequence 

numerous papers dealing with this canyon have been published. On the other hand, the 

geographically nearby and equally huge Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon has so far received much 

less attention. The main goal of the present thesis is therefore to study the pathways of 

recent fine-grained sediment transport on the central Portuguese continental margin with 

special focus on the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent shelf area. 

The Nazaré and Cascais canyons were also studied along with the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon, so that a comparison can be made between canyons with different sedimentary 

setting and anthropogenic pressures. 

The Sines, Estremadura and to some extent the Mondego open slopes were studied 

through cross-margin transects allowing comparison with transects in the submarine 

canyon systems. 

The present thesis is based on comprehensive sediment sampling and collection of 

hydrographic data in the Lisbon-Setúbal, Nazaré and Cascais submarine canyons and 

adjacent open slopes. In order to achieve the above goal, the compositional variability of 



1. Introduction 

 15

sediments was assessed along the canyon axes in the three canyon systems. Short-term 

sedimentation from sediment traps was compared with the longer-term integrated 

sedimentary signal from core tops. The geochemical (elemental and isotopic) and 

mineralogical results were also integrated with data on processes and pathways of 

sediment transport (total mass fluxes through sediment traps, sediment accumulation 

rates through 210Pb geochronology, horizontal SPM fluxes) for the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Nazaré canyons. For the latter canyon, data on processes and pathways of sediment 

transport were previously published by De Stigter et al. (2007b). 

Overall, the here presented data yield information on sedimentary processes 

presently operating within submarine canyons on timescales of days to decades and 

more, and specifically on sources and dispersal pathways of natural and anthropogenic 

trace metals affecting deep sea areas yet poorly known, such as submarine canyons. 

 

In the next chapter a description of the central Portuguese margin will be presented 

focusing especially on the submarine canyons and also on the shelf and slope adjacent to 

the canyons. Since the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and the adjacent shelf and slope are the 

central topic of the present thesis, a more comprehensive description of these areas will 

be given, including a description of the adjacent hinterland areas (basin watersheds and 

coastal areas).

2.1. Portuguese Atlantic margin 

The Portuguese Atlantic margin is characterised by a narrow shelf and steep irregular 

slope, dissected by several deep canyons. Structural trends of the margin are determined 

by fault systems present in the Hercynian basement, by Mesozoic extensional tectonics 

related to the opening of the North Atlantic, and by Cenozoic compression resulting from 

the collision of the European and African plates (e.g. Vanney &amp;amp; Mougenot, 1981). The 

present morphology of the margin was basically established since the Miocene, when 

major subsidence occurred and prograding sedimentary series were deposited on the 

shelf and slope (e.g. Alves et al., 2003). The latter were subsequently incised by canyons, 

which channelled large volumes of sediment towards submarine fans at the base of the 

slope. The main submarine canyons from north to south are: Porto, Aveiro, Nazaré, 

Cascais, Lisbon-Setúbal and São Vicente, which exhibit a very general northeast–

southwest trend (Figure 2.1). These canyons, dividing the western Iberian margin into 

sub-margins with different features, are the main pathways through which shelf 

sediments are transported to the abyssal plains (Vanney &amp;amp; Mougenot, 1990). The sub-

margins (shelf and slope) are here referred from north to south as (Figure 2.2): 

• Aveiro margin between Espinho and Cape Mondego; 

• Mondego margin between Cape Mondego and the Nazaré Canyon;  

• Estremadura margin between the Nazaré Canyon and Cape Roca;  

• Lisbon margin between Cape Roca and Cape Espichel; 

• Setúbal margin between Cape Espichel and the Setúbal Canyon; 

• Sines margin between the Setúbal Canyon and Cape Sines. 

 

At depths over 4500 m the Aveiro and Mondego slope run out into the Iberia Abyssal 

Plain, and the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines slope into the Tagus Abyssal Plain. The 

Estremadura spur, projecting westwards from the Estremadura margin, separates the 

Iberia and Tagus abyssal plains (Figure 2.1). 

The Minho, Douro, Mondego, Tagus (Tejo) and Sado rivers supply sediment to the 

shelf, which is composed of a thick (&gt; 1000 m) Cenozoic sediment wedge draping a 

Mesozoic substrate (Coppier &amp;amp; Mougenot, 1982). Cliff erosion and reworking of shelf

 18 

deposits are additional sources of recent sediment, next to biogenic sediment. Recent 

sediments are predominantly deposited on the shelf in a narrow belt along the shore and 

in mid-shelf mud patches. Further dispersal of fine-grained suspended sediment along 

and across the shelf occurs mainly in winter under the influence of southerly storms 

(Vitorino et al., 2002b; Oliveira et al., 2002). Transport of shelf sediments towards the 

deeper continental margin is limited by poleward flowing slope currents, in particular the 

flow of Mediterranean Water on the upper continental slope (Van Weering et al., 2002). 

Submarine canyons like the Lisbon, Setúbal and Nazaré Canyon which cut deeply into the 

continental shelf, are likely to intercept the sediment transport along the shelf and provide 

corridors for transport down the continental slope.

2.1.1. Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines margins 

The continental shelf between Cape Raso and Cape Sines, in this study referred to as 

the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelf, has a width ranging from 3 to 30 km, with the 

shelfbreak located around 200 m depth (Figure 2.2). 

The sedimentary cover of these shelf areas was virtually unknown until the middle 

1970’s when the mapping of surface sediments was initiated with the SEPLAT 

Programme, carried out by the Instituto Hidrográfico of Portugal. Figure 2.3 showing the 

sedimentary cover of the study area is redrawn from the map published in 2005 by the 

Instituto Hidrográfico, as a result of this programme.  

The close proximity to two rivers and protection of an important portion of the 

continental shelf from the main swell coming from the NW allowed the formation of mud 

patches in the shelf off the rivers. As a result of the sea-level rise since the last glaciation, 

paleocoast deposits can also be found in the shelf. In general, the sedimentary cover of 

the Iberian margin is mainly composed of late Quaternary and Holocene sediments (Dias, 

1987). 

 

River-derived sedimentary deposits 

On the Lisbon and Setúbal continental shelves, sediment discharges from the Tagus 

and Sado estuaries have resulted in the formation of submarine protofluvial deltas in front 

of the river mouths. The sedimentary deposits off the Tagus River are essentially muddy 

(Figure 2.3). Protected against swell from the northwest, almost the entire Lisbon 

continental shelf is covered by a large expanse of muddy deposit. 

The Tagus mud patch with an area of about 560 km2 is the most important riverine-

derived deposit of the Portuguese margin. Sediments from this deposit are composed of 

more than 85 % of terrigenous material whereas carbonate contents vary from 5 to 9 %, 

occasionally reaching values between 17 and 25 % (Jouanneau et al., 1998 and Alt-

Epping et al., 2007). Linear sediment accumulation rates vary between 0.07 and 

0.18 cm year-1, with maximum values of 2.13 cm year-1 (Jouanneau et al., 1998). 

Muddy deposits of the Sado protofluvial delta cover only a relatively small area 

confined to the river outlet, in accordance with the much smaller size of this river. The 



2. Regional setting 

 21

sedimentary deposits covering the continental shelf adjacent to the Sado River are mainly 

sandy muds. Muddy sediment areas in the Setúbal shelf are restricted to the northern 

coast of the bay in front of Sesimbra and to the upper Setúbal Canyon (Monteiro &amp;amp; Moita, 

1971; Moita &amp;amp; Quevauviller, 1986). The sedimentary cover of the Setúbal shelf is 

predominantly composed of terrigenous lithoclastic material, mostly quartz, whereas bulk 

carbonate content is mostly below 30 % (Figure 2.4). 

 

Sandy deposits of the inner and outer shelves 

Sandy deposits occur on the inner part of the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelves, 

where the energy of littoral currents is sufficiently high to remove the finer sediment 

fractions. On the Sines shelf, coarse sandy deposits occurring on the outer shelf near the 

shelfbreak are a remnant of an old shoreline dated ~16 000 years B.P., which has not 

become covered by recent muddy deposits because of prevailing dynamics of the outer 

shelf (Dias, 1987). These deposits have carbonate contents which can exceed 50 % 

although contents below 30 % predominate (Figure 2.4). Local rock outcrops occur on all 

the three shelves but are most common on the Sines shelf (Figure 2.3). 

Whereas the Lisbon and Setúbal outer shelves around 200 m WD pass abruptly into 

the steeply dipping slope leading down to the Tagus Abyssal Plain, the Sines shelf passes 

more gradually into the gently dipping slope. In this area steep slopes are only found at 

the intersection with the Setúbal Canyon. 

2.1.2. Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon is located on the Portuguese continental margin 

around 38º00’-38º30’N; 009º-010º30’W (Figure 2.5). The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

intersects the Portuguese margin just south of Lisbon near the mouth of the Tagus and 

Sado rivers. It is a canyon system since it is characterised by having two upper-canyon 

parts: the Lisbon Canyon and the upper Setúbal Canyon. The head of Lisbon Canyon is 

located close to the mouth of the Tagus River, the largest river of the Iberian Peninsula. 

The head of Setúbal Canyon is located close to the mouth of the Sado River, a smaller 

river south of the Tagus. These two branches join together at around 2010 m WD. From 

the junction point onward the canyon, usually named Setúbal Canyon after the longest of 

the two branches, continues in WSW direction for another 127 km to the foot of the 

continental slope at 4500 m.

Upper Setúbal Canyon and Lisbon Canyon 

The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon is fed by two main canyon branches, the east–west-

oriented Setúbal branch and the north–south-trending Lisbon branch (Figure 2.5). The 

Setúbal branch canyon head is located at 38°18?45?N, 8°52?49?W, at ~90 m WD, 20 km 

south-southwest of the Sado River mouth and 6 km west of the nearest coastline between 

Tróia and Sines. The branch cuts 45 km into the continental shelf with low sinuosity, 

although in its shallowest course it displays some open meanders; this section has a width 

of less than 8 km from edge to edge (section 9 of Figure 2.6c). Small terraces can be 

identified in TOBI imagery, both in its northern and southern walls (Lastras et al., 2009) 

(Figure 2.7e). 

The Lisbon branch canyon head is located at 38°33?15?N and 9°16?48?W, at ~120 m 

water depth, 13 km south-southwest of the Tagus River mouth, and 5 km west of the 

nearest coastline. It cuts 28 km into the shelf and is sinuous, with a total length of 38 km, 

due to a series of sharp meanders entrenched between high gullied walls (Figure 2.7c and 

Figure 6.2). A straight escarpment marks the western wall down slope of the major 



2. Regional setting 

 24 

meanders, where the canyon axis straightens (Figure 2.7c) before its almost 

perpendicular junction with the Setúbal branch at 38°17?38?N and 9°19?39?W around 

2010 m WD. 

The along-canyon profiles of the Setúbal (C–C2 in Figure 2.6c) and Lisbon (C–C1 in 

Figure 2.6c) branches differ substantially. The Lisbon branch displays a concave 

bathymetric profile that matches the profile of the Setúbal Canyon at water depths 

exceeding 2010 m. It is also parallel to the bathymetric profile of the lower part of the 

Setúbal branch, that is, between 1420 and 2010 m. However, that parallelism disappears 

upslope of 1420 m WD. There, the Setúbal branch displays a convex morphology with a 

knick point at 1040 m WD and high slope gradients in the canyon axis between 1040 and 

1420 m WD (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.6c). 

There is a third, minor branch (C–C3 in Figures 2.6a and c), which starts at ~250 m 

WD and joins the middle course of the Setúbal Canyon at 2165 m WD, hanging 350 m 

over the canyon axis (section 8 in Figure 2.6c). 

 

Setúbal Canyon - middle course  

The middle course of the Setúbal Canyon is more than 25 km wide (from edge to 

edge) in some areas and 70 km long, measured from the confluence of the Lisbon and 

Setúbal branches at 2010 m down to the Setúbal Canyon mouth (the area where the 

canyon widens onto the lower portion) at 4170 m WD. Most of the middle course is 

characterised by a flat-bottomed canyon axis. This is most evident between 2150 and 

2320 m WD, where a 500 m wide thalweg just upslope of a 110° sharp meander and a 

number of terraces in the northern wall can be identified, together with an over deepened 

pond (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.7g). 

Some short sections show, on the contrary, V-shaped axes, as happens in a north–

south-oriented straight section at ~2600 m WD. In this part, the Setúbal Canyon is 

strongly incised. The external walls of meanders in the middle course show evidence of 

intensive gullying. The final part of the middle course, between 3700 and 4170 m WD, 

displays a striking variety of sedimentary processes (Lastras et al., 2009). A flat-bottomed 

and slightly incised canyon thalweg of up to 1 km wide is bounded to the south by up to 

four levels of terraces, each more than 200 m wide. These terraces are swept by material 

coming from a 1200 m-wide notch in the southern wall and, down-slope, by a linear 

escarpment at the base of the southern wall. Large blocks and debris are clearly visible 

below this escarpment (Figure 2.7f), according to Lastras et al. (2009).

Setúbal Lower Canyon 

At 4170 m WD, the Setúbal Canyon abruptly widens and opens onto the lower part 

through the Setúbal Canyon mouth. The northern wall of the canyon mouth region 

displays pervasive signs of grooving. The first 11.5 km of the lower part, between 4170 

and 4460 m WD, display a flat-bottomed, 1.9 km-wide thalweg bounded by high, steep 

walls (Figure 2.7f). The canyon thalweg gradually widens up to 5 km over the following 

25 km, where tributaries join it from both walls. The thalweg is composed generally of 

high backscatter deposits in this section, with small low backscatter spots (Figure 2.7b). 

According to Arzola et al. (2008) the largest failure deposit from the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon occurs in this area. Seismic shaking was interpreted as the likely cause of such a 

localised slope failure event on the northern levee. Over the following 11 km, i.e., 

between 46 and 57 km downslope from the canyon mouth, the thalweg has a very low 

slope gradient, and gains only 40 m in depth, from 4820 to 4860 m WD; beyond this 

point the canyon opens gradually onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Figure 2.2). Between 46 

and 57 km, close to the southern rim, the thalweg displays evident signs of erosion, with 

elongated scours perpendicular to the canyon direction (Figure 2.7d). These scours tend 

to be orientated parallel to the canyon axis in the central parts of the thalweg. The 

Setúbal Canyon finally opens out onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain 57 km away from the 

canyon mouth, but its influence can be traced much farther away. TOBI imagery shows 

pervasive chevron-shaped scouring and other erosional morphologies 95 km away from 

the canyon mouth (Lastras et al., 2009) (Figure 2.7a).

2.1.3. Cascais Canyon 

The Cascais Canyon is incised in the shelf edge and slope northwest of the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon (Figure 2.5), being separated from the latter by the Afonso de 

Albuquerque plateau (Vanney &amp;amp; Mougenot, 1981). Compared to the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Nazaré canyons it is the shortest in length, taking almost 90 km in an open U-turn to 

cover a straight-line distance of 62 km between canyon head and mouth. Since it spans a 

depth range similar to that of the other two, it is also the steepest one, with slope 

gradients typically exceeding 10° (Lastras et al., 2009). 

The Cascais Canyon head has a very complex morphology when compared to the 

other central Portuguese canyons, with multiple branches and gullies slightly incised in 

the shelf edge (see Figure 2.6b, section 2), reflecting an initial phase in submarine canyon 

evolution (Twichell &amp;amp; Roberts, 1982; Farre et al., 1983 in Lastras et al., 2009). It displays 

pervasive gullying of its walls, has a 4.2 km wide V-shaped morphology and is incised up 

to 1350 m below the continental shelf. 

The middle course of the Cascais Canyon runs from 2200 down to 4510 m WD, a 

distance of 43 km across the continental slope and base of slope. It is the most sinuous 

section of the canyon. In contrast to the upper section, which has an almost north–south 

mean direction of 196°, the middle section trends east–west. It has a width of up to 

22 km, and is incised as much as 1800 m. Although the four axial incisions, corresponding 

to the four branches of the canyon, have joined to form one single axis, numerous gullies 

still enter the Cascais Canyon through its northern wall, whereas the southern wall is 

smoother and more regular. A wide canyon axis characterises the first part of the middle 

course, between 2200 and 3300 m WD, with slope gradients not exceeding 8° (see Figure 

2.6b). In contrast, between 3300 and 4510 m WD, the Cascais Canyon thalweg is 

steeper, with slope gradients in places exceeding 15° and with widespread evidence of 

erosion, like grooving both in the thalweg and in the canyon walls, thalweg escarpments 

and over-deepened ponds (Lastras et al., 2009). 

The steep final part of the middle course of the Cascais Canyon opens at 4510 m WD 

into the lower-canyon. The lower part of the Cascais Canyon has a smooth, flat-bottomed 

and less incised valley, which in turn opens out into the Tagus Abyssal Plain (Figures 2.1 

and 2.5).

2.1.4. Mondego and Estremadura margins 

The Mondego margin has a shelf which varies from 65 km in width in its northern 

part down to 45 km close to the Nazaré Canyon. The main features of this portion of the 

Portuguese shelf are the mid-shelf rock outcrops in the north and a mid-shelf mud patch 

in the vicinity of the Nazaré Canyon. This middle shelf deposit, sub-parallel to the 

bathymetry, is 38 km long and 11 km wide (in average) but only 1-2 m thick. It is 

essentially formed by coarse silt, showing relatively high percentages of clay material 

(38 %) (Oliveira et al., 2007). The rest of the shelf is composed of sandy sediments. In 

the area where rock outcrops occur, sandy sediments have gravel contents higher than 

25 % (Dias, 1987). According to this same author, similar sediments can also be found 

half way between the Cape Mondego and the Nazaré Canyon head in a 20 km long 

deposit sub-parallel to the 50 m WD bathymetric line. 

The Estremadura margin (also known as the Estremadura Spur) is composed of a 

shelf about 70 km wide at its largest extension and a slope spur projecting to the West 

(Figure 2.2). To the North and South the Estremadura spur has steep and irregular 

slopes, incised by numerous deep valleys, some of which act as tributaries to the Nazaré 

and Cascais canyons. In its lower part the spur separates the Iberia and Tagus abyssal 

plains. The Estremadura shelf is dominated by rocky outcrops, rising up next to lower 

lying areas which act as traps for coarse sediment. Especially between 70 and 130 m WD 

the terrain is very rough (Badagola et al., 2006). The sediment traps are filled by coarse 

sand and gravely sediment (Balsinha, 2008) and normally the sediment column does not 

exceed 8 m (Badagola et al., 2006). There is a muddy area, surrounded by rocky 

outcrops, just southwards from the Nazaré Canyon. The patch is 4 to 6 m thick (Pombo, 

2004) and sediments have clay percentages around 28 % (Duarte, 2002). In the inner 

shelf, close to the canyon head, fine to very fine sandy sediments are found. 

 

2.1.5. Nazaré Canyon  

The Nazaré Canyon with an axial length of more than 200 km is among the largest 

canyons of the European continental margin (Figure 2.8). It is located between 39º25’N 

and 39º50’N, bounded eastward by the low coastal hills and cliff-coast of the Estremadura 

region, and sloping westward into the 5000 m deep Iberian Abyssal Plain. The most 

accepted theory about the canyon’s tectonic setting states that the incision of the canyon 



2. Regional setting 

 30 

around 39º40’N is largely determined by an E-W trending transpressive faultzone 

affecting the Paleozoic basement and Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary strata of the 

margin, and which forms the seaward continuation of the late Paleozoic NE-SW trending 

Nazaré fault on land (Vanney &amp;amp; Mougenot, 1990). The uplifted and deformed 

Estremadura promontory south of the faultzone delineates the southern boundary of the 

canyon. The lower-lying northern faultblock forms the broad shelf and slope north of the 

canyon. Another theory, however, assumes a more complex interplay between different 

faults forming the main valley of the canyon. According to this theory the faults that 

determine the canyon do not continue on land (Dinis, 2006). 

According to the subdivision of the canyon used by De Stigter et al. (2007b) 

essentially following that of Vanney &amp;amp; Mougenot (1990), the upper part of the Nazaré 

Canyon is a sharp V-shaped valley that is deeply incised into the shelf and steep upper 

slope, and which descends from the shoreline to 2700 m depth over a length of 60 km 

measured along the canyon axis (Figure 2.9, sections f, g, h, i). 

The main valley follows relatively straight sections of a few kilometres long, trending 

alternatingly in NE-SW and NW-SE direction parallel to the dominant structural trends of 

the shelf.  

 

Figure 2.8. Bathymetric map of the Nazaré Canyon and adjacent open slope and shelf (from De Stigter et 
al., 2004). 

 

The Nazaré Canyon forms a canyon system as the upper canyon has one short side-

valley branching off in NE direction from the main valley, known as the Vitória branch. In 

the canyon head, very fine mud covers the walls, whereas sand is present on the canyon 

thalweg below a drape of mud. 



2. Regional setting 

 31

The middle part of the canyon is a broad meandering valley, incised into the middle 

slope and descending from 2700 to 4000 m depth over 50 km. The main valley has 

terraced slopes and a V-shaped axial channel (Figure 2.9, section d).

longitudinal sections A–A1 (dark blue), A–A2 (red, main section) and A–A3 (light green) along the three main 
branches of the canyon, and cross sections a to i (dashed black lines), illustrated in panel b. Colour of each 
section corresponds with colours in panel b. 
b) Sections along and across the three main branches of the Nazaré Canyon. For the main branch of the 
Nazaré Canyon system an along-canyon slope gradient is also shown. Nine cross-canyon sections (a to i in A) 
have been drawn for the Nazaré Canyon. Crossing points between longitudinal and across sections are 
marked with a label that corresponds to the colour of the longitudinal section and number of the cross 
section. 

 

The lower-canyon, located on the lower continental slope, is a flat-floored valley with 

one or two incised axial channels, flanked to the south by the structurally defined Pacheco 

Duarte ridge and to the north by the up to 1 kilometre high sedimentary levee known as 

the Gil Vicente ridge (Figure 2.8). The lower-canyon valley descends very gently from 

4000 to 5000 m depth over a length of 100 km and its flat-bottomed thalweg gradually 

increases in width from about 3 km to over 15 km. The ridges flanking the valley decrease 

in height in westward direction until they end on the abyssal plain. The construction of 



2. Regional setting 

 32 

the northern levee has been attributed to northward deflection of turbiditic sediments 

transported through the canyon by Coriolis forcing (Faugères et al., 1984; Vanney &amp;amp; 

Mougenot, 1990 in De Stigter et al., 2007b). 

 

2.1.6. Oceanographic setting 

Tides and wave climate 

On the Portuguese coast, the dominant tide is semi-diurnal with a period of 12.25 

hours, moving from south to north. In the Sines harbour the tidal amplitude varies from 

3.4 m during spring tides to 0.7 m during neap tides (Instituto Hidrográfico, 1990). 

The Portuguese coastal area is exposed to the highly energetic North Atlantic swells. 

According to Costa et al. (2001), the dominant wave directions are from NW and W 

(97 %), with the SW direction representing only 3 % of the observations. Waves with 

heights of 1-2 m and periods of 5-7 s represent almost half of the observations (49 % 

and 44 %, respectively). During storm events (3 % of the observations) waves are as 

high as 5-6 m with peak periods of 9-13 s. 

Data recorded by the wave-rider buoy off Sines between 1992 and 1999 (Table 2.1) 

fits well to the general data for the Portuguese coast presented above. In northward 

direction from Sines towards Tróia there is an increasing sheltering effect of Cape Espichel 

which reduces the wave energy and deflects the incoming waves from the NW. In the 

northern part of the Tróia peninsula the waves are deflected so much as to arrive from 

SW directions, causing a northwards longshore drift. The same occurs on the coastal arc 

between Trafaria and Cape Espichel where a northwards increase of the sheltering effect 

is caused by Cape Roca. 

In the above dataset collected between 1992 and 1999, the mean significant wave 

height (Hs) was 1.65 m, with a maximum of 7.69 m. The most energetic wave conditions 

(monthly Hs mean &gt; 2.0 m) and the highest numbers of single records corresponding to 

storms (Hs &gt; 5 m) were measured in November, December and January (Miranda, 2006). 

 

Hydrological conditions of the Portuguese margin  

The water column in the study area consists of several water masses (Fiúza et al., 

1998; Garcia et al., 2003). At the surface, below the seasonally varying thermocline, a 

warm (11-15 ºC) and salty (? 36.0 psu) body of Eastern North Atlantic Central Water 



2. Regional setting 

 33

(ENACW) can be distinguished (Figure 2.10). This water mass has a low concentration of 

suspended particles (~8-15 µg/l), although intermediate layers are observed with higher 

turbidity (Hall et al., 2000).

Below the ENACW, between 600 and 1600 m WD, occurs the relatively warm 

(~10 ºC) and saline (&gt; 36.0 psu) Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW); a salinity 

maximum is centred at 1100 m depth. The MOW flows northwards along the western 

Iberian continental slope in a narrow vein of 100 to 150 km width, with a mean current 

velocity of approximately 12 cm s-1. An upper core of MOW closely follows the continental 

slope, whereas a lower core of MOW meanders west and northwestwards (Schönfeld, 

1997 and references therein).  

The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) dominates below the MOW (between 1500 

and 3000 m WD), with cooler (2-6 ºC) and less salty (~35.0 psu) properties. This water 

mass consists of a mix of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water and Labrador Sea Water (Van 

Aken, 2000b). 

The relatively thin (~200 m WD) superficial water layer flowing along the Portuguese 

margin is influenced by fresh water inputs from rivers and by wind stress which are 

variable throughout the year. Vertical movements associated with upwelling and 

downwelling essentially occur within this superficial water layer.

Winters (typically December – January) are characterised by prevailing southerly 

winds often associated with storms, leading to downwelling and offshore Ekman transport 

(Vitorino et al., 2002a). Under these conditions a northward flow of relatively warm water 

occurs over the continental shelf, which is known as the Portugal Coastal Countercurrent 

(PCCC). As a result of the accumulation of water in the coastal area a downward flux 

occurs over the shelf with bottom currents directed offshore (Vitorino et al., 2002b). 

Intense winter storms appear capable of eroding sediments at mid-shelf depths, and in 

combination with an offshore-directed bottom flow this leads to offshore transport of fine-

grained sediments in the form of bottom nepheloid layers (Vitorino et al., 2002a, b). 

During summer northerly winds prevail, leading to development of an upwelling 

regime, which is most active between June and September (Huthnance et al., 2002). 

Although a southward superficial current is formed over the shelf, the northwards current 

over the shelf edge and upper slope continues to exist. The upwelled water is fed by the 

ENACW of either sub-tropical (ENACWst) or sub-polar (ENACWsp) origin, which forms the 

permanent thermocline at water depths below approximately 100 m. Depending on the 

wind strength both types of water can be upwelled. The poleward flowing ENACWst is 

lighter, relatively warmer and saltier than southward flowing ENACWsp and contains less 

nutrients. The ENACWst is formed along the Azores front during winter and then 

contributes to the PCCC. The ENACWsp, which flows below the sub-tropical ENACWst is 

formed in the eastern North Atlantic around 46ºN (Fiúza, 1984; Fiúza et al. 1998; Ríos et 

al., 1992). 

When seasonal coastal upwelling predominates off western Iberia, the upwelled 

water forms a cold and nutrient-rich band of water along the west coast (Figure 2.11a, b, 

c). This water is transported southwards by the Portugal Coastal Current (PCC) in a band 

of about 50 km wide, as documented by satellite infrared images (Figure 2.11a). The 

different upwelling patterns off western Iberia are largely determined by the bathymetry, 

the coastal morphology, and local wind conditions (northerly wind along the west coast). 

Filaments and plumes of cold water with high pigment concentrations are modulated by 

topographic features like submarine ridges and capes (Figure 2.11). Such filaments can 

extend as far as 200 km (e.g. off Lisbon - 39ºN, Cape Roca). Plumes are observed south 

of Cape Espichel and Sines (Figure 2.11b).

2.2. Regional Climate 

The continental Portuguese territory is located at the boundary between the 

subtropical anticyclone zone and the subpolar low-pressure zone (SPLZ). The subtropical 

anticyclone zone (high-pressure zone) is known as the Azores Anticyclone (Azores High) 

in the Atlantic Ocean. This high-pressure cell is neither permanent nor stationary. In 

summer the Azores Anticyclone shifts NW towards the Iberian Peninsula, causing ridging 

across France, northern Germany and the SE United Kingdom (Naya, 1984). During this 

period, the boundary between the Azores High and the SPLZ normally stays north of 

45 ºN and so the Portuguese continental territory is under the influence of subtropical 

anticyclonic air masses which may affect the country for long periods (Brito, 1994). In the 

winter, the Azores High moves SE South of the Azores Islands and the limit between the 

SPLZ and Azores High may shift southward to latitudes around 30 ºN. During this period, 

continental Portugal, especially the northern part, is under influence of the subpolar 

depressions characterised by humid and cold air accompanied by abundant precipitation.  

Apart from the large-scale pressure fields over the NE Atlantic, local factors such as 

the orography, the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the continentality are responsible 

for significant lateral and temporal variation in air temperature and precipitation. For 

instance, the orography change along the country is responsible for the decrease of 

precipitation from north to south, from annual values higher than 3000 mm in the north 

to less than 400 mm in the south. The Tagus valley approximately marks the transition 

between the temperate and humid climate of the northern Portugal and the warm and dry 

climate of the south.

2.3.1. Coastal area 

The coast adjacent to the study area consists of two broad arc segments: Tróia - 

Sines and Trafaria - Espichel, almost homothetic in trend, shape and boundaries. The 

northern boundary of each 

segment is a major estuary 

(Sado and Tagus, respectively). 

Between the Sado Estuary and 

Cape Espichel the coastline is 

determined by the E-W trending 

Arrábida Mountains chain. 

Similarly, the rocky coastline 

north of the Tagus Estuary 

extends westwards until the 

Cape Raso (Figure 2.12). The 

southern boundaries are 

defined by Cape Sines and Cape 

Espichel, respectively. Both 

coastal arcs include a northern 

section with low lying beaches 

and dunes and a central and 

southern section with Mio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs (see Figure 2.13 for illustrations from the 

Tróia – Sines arc). In some places these outcrops can reach 40 m height. Sea-cliffs of 

these areas are mainly composed of detritic sedimentary sequences dating from the 

Miocene (silty-clayey sands, clays and calcareous arenites) and from Pliocene-Pleistocene 

(finesands to coursesands, gravels, clays and ferruginous crusts) (Quevauviller, 1988; 

Marques, 1999; Gomes, 1992 and Gama, 2004). 

 Both arcs have also lagoons in their southern parts: Melides, Santo André and 

Sancha Lagoons in the Tróia-Sines arc and Albufeira Lagoon in the Trafaria-Espichel arc

(Figure 2.12 and 2.13). These lagoons have as common feature a narrow, linear and 

reflective sand barrier which is attached to the mainland at both ends. In the Santo 

André, Melides and Albufeira lagoons an ephemeral tidal inlet is artificially and regularly 

opened to promote water exchange, to prevent eutrophication and to drain the nearby 

alluvial plains which are reclaimed for agriculture and which are silting up by natural 

means (Freitas et al., 2002). 

The Tróia – Sines coastal arc is delimited to the south by Cape Sines, an outcrop of 

sub-volcanic rocks of Late Cretaceous age, which more inland are covered below Cenozoic 

sand and gravel (Figure 2.17). Seismic reflection and field sampling in the adjacent shelf 

indicates that the sub-volcanic massif extends seawards over an area of about 12 x 

3.5 km (Inverno et al., 1993). The emerged part is composed of basic and intermediate 

igneous rocks (gabbros, diorites and syenites) surrounded by a dense field of basic 

igneous dykes (Inverno et al., 1993). 

Between both coastal arcs stands the Arrábida coast, extending between Cape 

Espichel and the Sado River and defined by an E-W trending fault delimiting the uplifted 

Mesozoic Arrábida Mountain chain. This tectonically controlled coastal area is much higher 

compared to the nearby coastal arcs with an altitude of 380 m at the summit of Risco 

Mountain. It is dominated by calcareous rocks and beaches occur mainly as pocket 

beaches in small bays protected against the main swell (e.g. Portinho da Arrábida). 

 

2.3.2. Hydrological basins 

The main fluvial systems debouching on the central Portuguese margin are the Tagus 

(Tejo) River, draining an area of more than 80,000 km2 and with a mean annual 

discharge of 16 x 109 m3 y-1, and the much smaller Sado River, which has an order of 

magnitude lower drainage area and annual discharge (Figure 2.14). 

Fluvial networks have been extensively modified after the 1940s, especially by the 

construction of multiple dams and reservoirs for water storage, energy production and 

flood control, which has dramatically reduced the sediment yield to the coast (Figure 

2.15). Also more sediment has been progressively retained within the drainage area due 

to the changes in land-use. Specifically, reforestation programs and soil conservation 

practices in agriculture have been growing in importance since the last quarter of the 20th 

century. In addition, the mining of sand and shingle from river beds and flood plains for 



2. Regional setting 

 41

construction and navigation has been steadily growing throughout the 20th century, 

enhancing the sediment storage capacity of fluvial systems, and as a result leading to the 

undersaturation of the potential longshore drift and starvation of the coast.

Furthermore, during the present high sea-level stand, estuaries tend to work as 

sediment traps, especially for the coarser bedload sediment, and therefore the sediment 

transported to the adjacent sea consists mostly of fine-grained suspended material. 

In the Plan of the Tagus Hydrographic Basin (Procesl et al., 1999) 2043 dams were 

identified in the Portuguese part of the Tagus basin. Fourteen of these are important 

dams with storage capacity &gt; 10 hm3. Presently the Tagus supplies less than 1/3 of its 

potential solid load to the inner estuary (Ramos &amp;amp; Reis, 2001). According to Procesl et al. 

(1999), under natural conditions the Tagus River has a capacity to transport 1,200,000 m3 

y-1 of sediment through traction and saltation. Between 1956 and 1966 the mean 

sediment transport capacity of the river decreased to 530,000 m3 y-1 and it was estimated 

to be around 350,000 m3 y-1 for the year 2000. 

In 1999 around 800 dams were identified in the Sado Basin (Hidroprojecto et al., 

1999). Most of them (&gt;700) are small dams, together representing around 9 hm3 of water 

storage capacity, whereas 8 are considered to be significant ones, each with a storage 

capacity &gt; 10 hm3. 

 

Tagus (Tejo) Basin 

The Tagus River is the longest river of the Iberian Peninsula with a length of more 

than 1100 km and a drainage area of 80,629 km2 covering an important part of central 

and western Iberia. Approximately 30 % of the drainage area is on Portuguese territory. 

The mean annual discharge of the Tagus is 16 x 109 m3 y-1, with interannual variation 

ranging between 3 x 109 and 23 x 109 m3 y-1 (e.g. Benito et al., 2003). Monthly average 

discharge varies from 0.03 x 109 to 69 x 109 m3 y-1 (Loureiro, 1979; Loureiro &amp;amp; Macedo, 

1986). 

The Tagus drainage basin can be subdivided in four parts, each with distinctive 

morphological and hydrological characteristics, on the basis of different geological setting 

(Figure 2.16): 1) the Iberian Range (at the head); 2) the NE Cenozoic basin (upper 

course); 3) the Hesperian Massif (middle course); and 4) the SW Cenozoic basin (lower 

course). 

The Tagus River head (from its source to Sacedón) is located in the Iberian Range, a 

NW–SE-trending Alpine chain consisting of Mesozoic sedimentary strata (Triassic 

feldspathic sandstones, Jurassic and Cretaceous marine carbonates and subarkosic 

sandstones) (Arribas &amp;amp; Tortosa, 2003). 



2. Regional setting 

 43

The upper course (from Sacedón to Navalmoral) lies embedded in continental 

clastics, carbonates and tabular evaporites of Neogene age. In this segment, the 

northwest watershed of the drainage area is situated in the Central System, a 

mountainous range that consists of a large exposure of granitoids that intrude pre-

Hercynian metamorphic basement. 

The middle course (from Navalmoral to Abrantes) cuts low-grade metamorphic rocks 

(Precambrian greywacke and slates, Cambrian slates and quartzites and associated 

intruding granitoids) from the Central Iberian Zone in the Hesperian Massif. 

The lower course of the Tagus River (from Abrantes to Lisbon) is developed on the 

SW Cenozoic basin which continues into the Sado drainage area (Freire, 1993). The 

tabular arrangement of the Tertiary detrital deposits favours the wandering course of the 

Tagus River, with a wide alluvial plain with meander bars and a well-developed system of 

Quaternary terraces. Estuarine deposits are also present near the river mouth. Head 

streams of tributaries at the north and south also drain Jurassic carbonate and 

metamorphic terranes from the Hesperian Massif, respectively, cropping out at the edges 

of the Neogene basin (Figure 2.16). 

According to Pera &amp;amp; Arribas (2004), most of the sand deposited on the Tagus Estuary 

is derived from the erosion of Mesozoic carbonates and Tertiary to Quaternary detrital 

sediments at the distal margin of the drainage basin. 

The average suspended sediment load discharged by the Tagus into the estuary is 4 

x 105 t y-1 but may reach 1 x 106 t y-1 during years when there are several flood events 

(Vale &amp;amp; Sundby, 1987). In the Tagus Estuary, the SPM concentration is considered to be 

low, with values typically &amp;lt;30 mg l-1 (Câmara et al., 1986), but with a great variability in 

time and space, related to the discharge of the Tagus River and meteorological and tidal 

dynamics in the estuary. Vale (1981) recorded a maximum value of turbidity in the order 

of 500 mg l-1 in the upper estuary during spring tide. Although the tide is important for 

the transport of water, sediments export to the shelf, estimated at 1 – 77 x 106 t y-1, 

appears largely driven by exceptional storms and river floods (Bettencourt et al., 1980; 

Vale, 1981). According to Valente &amp;amp; da Silva (2009), precipitation, river discharge and 

winds, increase the turbid plume issuing from the Tagus Estuary, but the fortnightly cycle 

appears to be superimposed on the large time-scale variability.

Sado Basin and coastal lagoons 

The Sado drainage basin comprises an area of approximately 7,737 km2 (Miranda, 

2007) limited to the north by the Tagus basin, to the east by the Guadiana basin and to 

the south by the Mira basin. To the West there are several creeks which flow directly to 

the sea. 

The Sado River (the main watercourse of the basin) is a small river compared to the 

Tagus River spanning only 180 km from its origin in the Vigia Mountains (230 m high) to 

the point where it flows into the sea. It has an annual mean discharge of 1.2 x 109 m3 y-1 

(Cabeçadas, 1993) with pronounced seasonal variability (peak values in February / March 

and minima in August) and large interannual variations (e.g. Trigo et al., 2004) resulting 

in highly variable suspended sediment loads (Vale, 1990; Vale et al., 1993).  

The water flow within the estuary is mainly controlled by the tide, as fresh water 

inflow from the Sado and a number of smaller rivers is insufficient to have a significant 

influence on circulation (Bettencourt &amp;amp; Ramos, 2003). 

The geology of the Sado Basin is dominated by Paleozoic and Cenozoic deposits 

which occupy 49 and 47 % of the basin surface, respectively (Miranda, 2007). The 

remaining 4 % represent Jurassic limestones, marls, dolomites and dolomitic limestones 

of the Arrábida and Grandola Mountains and some outcrops of post-Hercynian intrusive 

rocks (Figure 2.17) of which the outcrop at Cape Sines is the most relevant to this study. 

Paleozoic outcrops in the Sado Basin can be divided in two main groups: 1) low 

grade metamorphic sediments and 2) igneous rocks and medium to high grade 

metamorphic sediments. According to Pimentel (1997), the first group consists mainly of 

schist and greywacke which are not very resistant to weathering and thus yield mica-rich 

and clayey sediments. The occurrence of quartz veins associated to late periods of schist 

deformation is the main source of clastic quartz. The second group characterised by 

weathering resistant outcrops, comprises felsitic gneisses, rhyodacite porphyry, granular 

basic and ultrabasic rocks and granular acid and intermediate-acid rocks. 

Cenozoic rocks are found throughout the basin especially in the central and coastal 

areas. In general, Tertiary deposits consist of clays, sands, arenites, gravels and 

calcareous rocks / limestones (Figure 2.17). According to Pimentel (1997), these deposits 

were produced by weathering of Paleozoic rocks. Quaternary deposits consist essentially 

of gravel beds and sands occurring in alluvial channels and terraces, dunes and beaches.

3.1. Field sampling and sample preparation 

3.1.1. Cruises and sampling gear 

Surface sediment samples from the continental shelf and upper slope between the 

Tagus River mouth and Cape Sines were collected between 1980 and 1987 during several 

cruises conducted within the framework of Instituto Hidrográfico’s internal project 

SEPLAT. Hundred and seventeen sediment samples were collected from water depths 

between 1 and 572 m (Figure 3.1). These samples, representing approximately the first 

15 cm of the sediment column, were collected using Shipeck, Van Veen and Smith 

McIntyre grabs. 

Sediment samples and other data presented from Portuguese canyons and open 

slopes were recovered during a series of cruises with RV “Pelagia” of the Royal 

Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), conducted in November 2002, March 

2003, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, August/September 2006 and May/June 

2007 (cruises 64PE204, 64PE208, 64PE218, 64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252, 64PE269, 

respectively). Subsequently, stations are referred to by cruise number combined with 

station number (e.g. 204-23). Sampling locations are shown in Figure 3.2 and positions 

are given in Appendix Tables A1.1 and A1.2. Location of samples from the Mondego 

transect are shown in Appendix A2. 

Fifty box-, multi- and piston-cores were studied: 19 from the Nazaré Canyon, 16 from 

the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and 5 from the Cascais Canyon (Figure 3.2, Appendix Table 

A1.3). Ten more multi-cores collected in the open slope away from the canyons were also 

studied (open slope transects). All sediment cores were stored at 4°C for later analysis. 

Loss of surface sediment resulting from impact of the corer on the seabed is considered 

minimal since the oxidized surface sediment layer and intact arborescent foraminifera 

were commonly preserved in the top of the cores (Figure 3.3) (De Stigter et al., 2007b). 

The MUC 8+4 multiple corer developed by Oktopus GmbH was equipped with an 

array of eight 6-cm diameter and four 10-cm diameter polycarbonate coring tubes of 

61 cm length (Figure 3.4a). One of the 10-cm diameter polycarbonate tubes was usually 

replaced by a PVC tube of equal diameter, used for sedimentological analysis. The 



3. Materials and methods 

 50 

standard boxcorer developed by NIOZ is equipped with a cylindrical coring barrel of 30 cm 

diameter and 55 cm length (Figure 3.4b). Upon retrieval a lid closes off the top of the 

coring barrel, allowing recovery of relatively undisturbed cores complete with overlying 

water. 

The NIOZ pistoncorer consists of a steel coring barrel of 6 or 12 m length with lead 

weight of about 1500 kg (Figure 3.4c). The coring barrel had an 11-cm diameter plastic 

liner, a teflon head with core catcher and adjustable piston regulating the pressure inside 

the liner during coring. A trip weight of 100 kg with a smaller size coring barrel was used 

to release the pistoncorer for a free fall at about 3 m above the bottom. 

Mass deposition flux, current dynamics, temperature, salinity and turbidity in the 

near-bottom water layer were measured with three BOBO (BOttom BOundary) benthic 

landers developed by Royal NIOZ (Van Weering et al., 2000) (Figure 3.4d, e). 

 

3.1.2. BOBO landers and sediment traps 

The 4 meter high tripod landers designated as BOBO were each equipped with an 

RDI 1200 kHz ADCP facing downward at 2 m a.b. (above bottom), SeaBird conductivity 

and temperature sensor at 3 m a.b., SeaPoint optical backscatter sensors attached at 1 

and 3 m a.b., and a PPS4/3 sediment trap with its 0.05 m2 opening positioned at 4 m a.b 

(Figure 3.4d, e). 

Instruments were set to measure at 5- or 15-minute intervals. The ADCP collected 

current velocity and acoustic backscatter data in 5-cm vertical intervals. The data 

presented here always refer to a level at 100-cm interval above the bottom. 

Thirteen deployments were made, 5 in the Nazaré Canyon, 7 in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon and 1 on the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau ranging in depth between 343 and 

4975 m and with recording periods of 2 days up to 12 months (Figure 3.2 and Appendix 

Table A1.2). Sediment trap sample length was between 1 and 30 days. Before 

deployment, sediment trap sample bottles (Figure 3.4f) were filled with filtered seawater 

poisoned with mercury (II) chloride (1 mg cm-3) and buffered with borax (2 mg cm-3).

Assessment of sediment trap efficiency 

Sediment traps are the best presently available tools for studying particle 

composition and fluxes to the sea-floor over periods of weeks and years. These devices 

have been in use for several decades and have provided valuable insight into the rates, 

timing and mechanisms of material and energy transfer in the oceans (Asper, 1996 and 

references therein). However, the observation that in sub-aquatic environments, 

horizontal current speeds often exceed the settling velocities of suspended particles by 

several orders of magnitude has raised awareness to the impact that water flow relative 

to a sediment trap can cause on trapping efficiency (for reviews see Knauer &amp;amp; Asper, 

1989; Gardner, 1995). 

Laboratory and field experiments conducted by Gardner (1980a, b) demonstrated 

that above a certain critical flow speed, which depends mainly on trap geometry, the trap 

will underestimate the downward flux. In Gardner’s calibration experiments, cylindrical 

traps proved to give the most reliable estimate of downward fluxes. Further, the most 

important factor controlling the trapping efficiency of cylindrical traps is the 

height/diameter ratio (aspect ratio). Under laboratory conditions cylinders with aspect 

ratio between 2 and 3 appeared to yield accurate measurements of vertical fluxes in flows 

up to 15 cm s-1 (Gardner, 1980b). In the field, Baker et al. (1988), using cylindro-conical 

traps, found that the magnitude and compositional characteristics of the flux collected 

under flow speeds &amp;lt;12 cm s-1 were indistinguishable from those simultaneously recorded 

by drifting traps, used as a reference not biased by water flow. In other field experiments, 

Gardner et al. (1997) found that collecting efficiencies of cylinders of aspect ratio 3 were

not affected under flow speeds less than 22 cm s-1. Taking into account that the traps 

used in this study have a higher aspect ratio (4) than those tested by Gardner et al. 

(1997), the critical current speed may be higher in our case. 

Figure 3.5 illustrates the positive correlation between turbidity measured through 

acoustic backscatter and mass fluxes measured with a PPS4/3 sediment trap. This gives 

confidence in the efficiency of the sediment traps used in the present study in trapping 

sediments under different conditions, both for situations where resuspended materials 

predominate and current speed is as high as 30 cm s-1 (Figure 3.5a), as well as for 

situations where pelagic inputs predominates and current speeds are low (Figure 3.5f).

3.1.3. Sample preparation in the laboratory 

 

Grab samples  

Each shelf sample was homogenised and split in two samples for different analyses: 

1) mineralogical and grain size analyses and 2) elemental analysis. The first set of 

samples was treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 5 %) to remove organic material.  

H2O2 was added stepwise until no more reaction occurred. Subsequently, samples were 

rinsed several times with distilled water to make sure that all the organic matter was 

removed. These organic-matter-free samples and the second set of untreated samples 

were then wet-sieved through a 63 µm sieve in order to normalise all sediments collected 

on the continental shelf to the same grain size fraction. 

 

Trap samples 

After recovery of the lander, the sediment trap samples were sieved over a 1 mm 

sieve to remove swimmers (Figure 3.6a, b), and the &amp;lt;1 mm fraction was subsequently 

split into sub-samples with either a Folsom or NOAA-type high precision splitter (Figure 

3.6c). Particulate matter was extracted by centrifugation at 3500 rpm or filtration on 0.4 

µm polycarbonate filters, and then freeze-dried. Compositional analyses were performed 

on bulk samples, but particle size was determined in samples from which the &gt; 150 µm 

fraction had been removed by wet-sieving. 

 

Core samples 

In the laboratory sediment cores were split, photographed and macroscopically 

investigated for lithological composition and presence of sedimentary or biogenic 

structures. X-radiographs were made of all box- and multi cores and selected piston

cores. Sampling was done with cut-off syringes and by slicing at 0.5- or 1-cm intervals, 

after which samples were freeze-dried. Sediment dry bulk density was determined from 

volume, wet and dry weight and applying a correction for pore-water salt content.

Down-core analyses for trace metals were done in several cores selected on the basis 

of having regular 210Pb profiles. In each one of these cores three samples were analysed: 

a surface sample (0-5 mm, occasionally 10 mm), a mix sample was composed integrating

3.2. Laboratory procedures 

3.2.1. Determination of grain size spectra 

Grain size spectra of fine sediments from the continental shelf/upper slope (Chapters 

4 and 5) and sediment trap samples and surface sediments from submarine canyons and 

open slopes (Chapters 6 and 7) were determined with a laser forward-scattering particle 

sizer. The analyses of the first were carried at the Instituto Hidrográfico with a MALVERN 

MicroP 2000 while the second were done at the Royal NIOZ with a Coulter LS230. The 

sediment was mechanically dispersed by ultrasonication without use of a chemical 

dispergent. Grain size spectra are presented as volume % in logarithmic size classes, and 

volume is calculated from particle diameter assuming spherical particles. 

 

3.2.2. Total organic carbon and CaCO3 

Freeze-dried, homogenised core and sediment trap samples were analysed for total 

carbon (Ctot), total organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen on a Carlo-Erba 1500 elemental 

analyser following the procedure of Verardo et al. (1990) and modified after Lohse et al. 

(1998, 2000). For Corg determination, carbonates (predominantly CaCO3) were removed 

by progressive and controlled acidification with sulphurous acid. Content of organic 

material in bulk sediment was calculated by multiplying Corg with 2.5. CaCO3 content was 

calculated from Ctot and Corg as:

Corg/N ratio was also calculated and used as indicator of marine/terrestrial origin of 

organic matter. 

 

3.2.3. Multi-elemental and 210Pb analysis 

 

Multi-elemental analysis with ICP-MS: shelf surface sediments 

Hundred and six shelf sediment samples were analysed through ICP-MS for total 

concentration of Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, Ti, Mn, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, Cu, As, Th and U. The analysis was 

done in an international accredited laboratory – ACME Analytical Laboratories Ltd – ISO-



3. Materials and methods 

 60 

9002 Accredited Co. According to routine procedure of the laboratory, 0.25 g of sample 

was heated in HNO3-HF-HClO4 to fuming and then evaporated to dryness. The residue 

was dissolved in HCl. The diluted samples were analysed using an ICP-MS. All samples 

were analysed in a single run to reduce instrumental drift-effects. Several samples were 

repeated in the beginning and at the end of the run to assess the amount of drift. 

Accuracy and precision were assessed through analysis of 8 repeats of reference 

material DST6 done voluntary by the laboratory. Unidentified repeats (10 % of the total 

number of samples, according to recommendations of Darnley et al., 1995) and two 

samples of reference material GBW 07309A (China Centre for certified Ref. Mat.) were 

also included among our samples. 

Accuracy calculated from the reference material DST6 was between 90 and 110 % 

for most elements, except for Zn which seems to have been underestimated (88 %). 

Accuracy calculated from the standard reference material GBW 07309A indicated 

underestimation of Cr (67 %), U (87 %) and Ti (82 %). However, only 2 samples were 

considered to calculate the latter accuracy while the former was calculated on the basis of 

8 samples. 

Precision was assessed through relative standard deviation (RSD) and based on 

replicate analyses made voluntarily by the laboratory and 12 replicate samples included in 

our set of samples. According to Huber (1998) in Ribani et al. (2004) values of RSD &amp;lt;

5 % and &amp;lt;20 % are acceptable for major and minor elements, respectively. RSD values 

calculated through the laboratory’s replicate analyses were under the above percentages 

for all elements except Ti, which had a precision of 9 %. RSD values calculated using the 

12 included replicate samples give also percentages below the above limits for all 

elements except again Ti with the same accuracy of 9 %. 

 

Multi-elemental analysis with ICP-MS: canyon and open slope sediments 

The following sample preparation and analysis for the determination of multi-

elemental concentration, Pb stable isotope ratios (206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) and activity of 
210Pb took place at the Royal NIOZ and were carried out under clean-room conditions 

(class 100 laminar flow hood, clean laboratory class 100). All labware was acid-cleaned 

using a Milestone traceClean® device and stored in plastic bags. 

A combined method was used to for the preparation of sediment samples for multi-

elemental, Pb stable isotope ratios and 210Pb analysis. First, 1 ml of 209Po spike solution 

(79.8 mBq g-1 in 1 M ultra-grade HNO3) was added to a teflon bomb. Subsequently, about 



3. Materials and methods 

 61

10 mg of freeze-dried and ground sample was added to the bomb, and digested in a 

microwave in a mix of 1 ml Milli-Q-Element (Millipore) high purity water (18.2 M?), 6 ml 

concentrated ultrapure HNO3 and 0.2 ml concentrated HF (suprapur). Subsequently, 1 ml 

concentrated ultrapure HClO4 was added as an additional digestion step and to ensure 

effective removal of HF during evaporation. The sample solution was evaporated to 

dryness, after which the residue was dissolved again with concentrated ultrapure HNO3 

and diluted with 18.2 M? Milli-Q to 1M HNO3. Finally, scandium, thallium and indium 

(Merck, Certipur, stock solution 1000 mg L-1) were added as internal standards. Elemental 

concentrations (Ca, Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, Cu and U) and stable isotope ratios 

were obtained in separate analytical runs using an Element-2 high resolution double 

focusing ICP-MS (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a teflon microflow 

nebulizer and a double spray chamber to obtain a stable signal. All analyses were 

performed in duplicate. For more information on the determination of the Pb stable 

isotope ratios consult Richter et al. (2009). 

The accuracy of the overall procedure (digestion and analysis) was assessed by 

analysing standard reference material GBW 07309A within every batch of 10 samples. The 

number of batches was 30 (n = 30). The accuracy for most of the analysed elements was 

90 – 110 %. Only Al had an accuracy of 85 % and Zn showed an accuracy of 113 %. 

Major elements (Fe, Ca, Mg) had precisions &amp;lt;10 %, except Al with a precision of 12 % 

and trace metals &amp;lt;20 %. Procedural blanks for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca and Mn generally yielded 

intensities corresponding to less than 1 % of the signal in sediment samples. Intensities 

for Pb and U were &amp;lt;3 %; for Cr &amp;lt;10 % and &amp;lt;15 % for Ni, Zn and Cu. 

 
210Pb analysis with alpha spectrometry 

For 210Pb analysis, the sediment solution with 209Po internal standard, prepared as 

described above, was again evaporated to dryness to remove HNO3. Subsequently, the 

dry residue was dissolved in 5 ml of concentrated HCl (12 M) and the solution was 

heated, after which 50 ml of diluted HCl (0.5 M) and 5 ml of ascorbic acid (20 g / 500 ml) 

were added. Silver plates were then suspended in the teflon bombs with solution during 

16 h at 70 ºC, to collect Po via spontaneous deposition. The activity of 210Pb was 

measured in these plates indirectly via its granddaughter 210Po, with a half-life of 138.4 

days, via ?-spectrometry with Canberra Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) 

detectors.

 Sample preparation and analysis took place at the Royal NIOZ and were carried 

out under clean-room conditions (class 100 laminar flow hood, clean laboratory class 

100). All labware was acid-cleaned using a Milestone traceClean® device and stored in 

plastic bags. 

 

3.2.4. Mineralogy of the fine and clay fractions 

Irradiation of crystalline mineral groups with X-ray produces specific patterns of X-

Ray diffraction (XRD) on the crystal structural planes from which minerals can be 

identified, even in a mixture of minerals (Gomes, 1988). For the present study a total of 

274 surface and trap samples were analysed for bulk mineralogical content and 232 

samples for clay mineralogical contents, by means of XRD analysis. The majority of 

analyses were carried out at the Geosciences Department of the University of Aveiro, and 

a smaller number at the Instituto Hidrográfico in Lisbon. In both laboratories analyses 

were carried out using a Philips PANalytical diffractometer, with CuK? radiation, following 

the same analytical procedure. The main mineral phases present in the samples were 

identified using the database from Brindley &amp;amp; Brown (1980) and MacDiff software’s 

database (Petschick, 2000) (see Figure 3.8 and 3.9). An attempt to quantify relative 

abundance of minerals was also done, on the basis of the percentage approach, which 

means that the sum of all identified phases in a sample is taken as 100 %. Since this is a 

relative quantification the term semi-quantification is used in the presented estimates. For 

semi-quantitative analysis, the peak areas from basal reflections of minerals were 

estimated using MacDiff software (Petschick, 2000) and afterwards weighted by 

empirically estimated factors (Tables 3.1 and 3.2). 

 

Fine fraction 

The term “randomly oriented specimen” will be used to refer to the analysis of bulk 

softly grounded sediment (&amp;lt;63 µm). In this case, sample was not compressed within the 

XRD sample container in order to avoid preferential orientation of crystals with different 

habits, and thus to obtain a more realistic semi-quantification (Gomes, 1988). For 

randomly oriented specimens, scans were run between 0º and 60º 2? as shown in Figure 

3.8 and the main groups of minerals identified and the respective peak used for 

quantification are indicated in Table 3.1.

Clay fraction 

After analysing the fine-fraction mineralogy, the clay fraction was separated by 

sedimentation in a settling column filled with distillated water according to Stoke's law, 

using 1 % sodium hexametaphosphate solution to avoid flocculation (e.g. Rocha, 1993). 

In order to identify minerals in the clay fraction, XRD analysis is most commonly 

done on oriented specimens, since this type of preparation enhances the signals 

originating from the 001 cleavage plane. However, the bias caused by preferential 

orientation of crystals with different habits is not important here since most of the 

minerals present in this fraction are layered silicates. This procedure facilitates recognition 

of individual clay mineral phases (Kahle et al., 2002) and increases the sensitivity of the 

method.

To prepare oriented clay mounts, a small volume of the suspension containing the 

&amp;lt;2 µm fraction was placed on a thin glass plate and air dried. After that, three successive 

XRD scans were performed on the sample: a first scan on the original air dried sample, a 

second scan after saturating the sample with glycerol, and a third scan after heating the 

glycerol-saturated sample to 500 °C for 90 minutes. Differences between successive scans 

are illustrated in Figure 3.9a, b, c. The scans were run between 2º and 20º 2? for the air 

dried aggregates and between 2º and 15º 2? for the other two treatments.  

The clay mineral analysis allowed distinction of four clay mineral groups with 

relatively broad peaks: illite, kaolinite, smectite and chlorite. The characteristic peak sizes

and empirically estimated weighing factors applied to peak area are indicated in Table

four clay mineral groups.

The 5 Å / 10 Å peak intensity ratio of illite was considered to estimate the “octahedral 

character”. According to Esquevin (1969), high ratio values &gt; 0.4 correspond to Al-rich 

illites whereas Fe- and Mg-rich illites have values below 0.15.

Kaolinite crystallinity index was determined as the ratio between the width measured 

at half-height of the 7 Å peak and the height of this peak, measured in air-dried 

specimens and after applying a correction for overlap of chlorite and kaolinite on the 7 Å 

peak. For illite crystallinity, the Kubler (1964) Index was used, determined as the width 

measured at half-height of the 10 Å peak. Well-ordered illite shows symmetrical and 

narrow basal reflections and consequently low values of the Kubler Index.

3.3. Data processing and calculations 

3.3.1. Horizontal sediment fluxes in the bottom boundary layer 

Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) are capable of yielding suspended 

sediment concentrations (SSC) estimates over the depth range ensonified at a high 

temporal and spatial resolution. ADCPs are non-intrusive, as the sediment suspension is 

being monitored at distance. The disadvantage of the acoustic approach is the 

dependence on sediment properties. In particular, irregularities in grain size distribution 

restrict the accuracy of acoustic SSC measurements (Mol, 2003). The ADCP used in the 

presented study collected data in 5-cm vertical intervals; the data presented here always 

refer to a level at 100-cm above the seabed. For the conversion of acoustic data into SSC 

estimates, the first step was to convert CTD profiles of optical backscatter to SSC, using 

filtered suspended matter samples for calibration. Then, optical backscatter values 

obtained by the BOBO lander were calibrated to SSC estimates from nearby CTD casts. 

Finally, the optical backscatter record of the BOBO lander, converted to SCC, was used for 

calibration of the acoustic backscatter. An exponential relationship was found between 

optical and acoustic backscatter from the BOBO lander. Since the influence of variations in 

particle characteristics during the measurement on optical and acoustic quantification of 

SSC is not known, the calculated sediment flux has to be regarded as a rough order of 

magnitude approximation. 

 

3.3.2. Accumulation rates determined in sediment cores 

The analysis of down-core 210Pb activity is an important dating tool on a 100-yr time 

scale, providing a method for calculating recent sediment accumulation rates (SARs) in 

environments where a relatively undisturbed sediment record is preserved. In areas of 

low SARs and relatively intense bioturbation, the method is considered less suitable for 

dating, because it is often not possible to accurately correct for reworking (Carpenter et 

al., 1982). 

In the description of down-core profiles of 210Pb activity three characteristic vertical 

zones are generally observed (e.g. Nittrouer et al., 1979):  



3. Materials and methods 

 69

i) a surface mixed layer (SML), extending to a distance L below the water sediment 

interface, where sediments are actively mixed by physical and biological 

processes;  

ii) a region where 210Pb activities decrease logarithmically with depth in the 

sediment;  

iii) a lower region of background activity, in equilibrium with 226Ra. 

For the present study sediment accumulation rates (SAR) were determined using the 

model of Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation Rate (CF/CS; Appleby &amp;amp; Oldfield, 

1992 in Boer et al., 2006) and the model of Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation 

Rate including a surface mixed layer (SML) on the top (CF/CSSML; Carpenter et al., 1982; 

Boer et al., 2006). 

The first is a one-layered profile consisting of an exponential downward decline in 

excess (or unsupported) 210Pb activity, on top of a background 210Pb (supported 210Pb) 

produced by decay of 222Rn in the sediment. A Constant Flux and Constant Sedimentation 

rate (CF/CS) model is usually applied for dating, which assumes that the SAR remained 

constant and that reworking of sediment has been negligible (Appleby &amp;amp; Oldfield, 1992). 

The down-core total 210Pb activity (A) can be described with the equation: 

 

(sup))(0)( exp AAA
m

xstotm +=
?
?
?

                  (2) 

 

Where: Am is the total 
210Pb activity (mBq g?1 dry sediment) at the cumulative mass 

depth m (g cm?2), A0(xs) is the initial excess 
210Pb activity at the sediment-water interface 

(mBq g?1 dry sediment), ? is the decay constant of 210Pb (0.0311 yr?1), ? is the SAR (g 

cm?2 yr?1) and A(sup) is the supported 
210Pb activity (mBq g?1). 

The CF/CSSML model is a two-layered profile consisting of an upper layer with a slow 

exponential downward decline in excess 210Pb activity and a deeper layer characterised by 

a more rapid exponential downward decline. For these profiles, the usual assumption is 

that diffuse mixing caused by burrowing organisms generates a surface mixed layer 

(SML). The strength of the mixing processes in the SML is measured by the mixing 

coefficient (Db) in units of g
2 cm-4 y-1, assumed constant mixing rate throughout the mixed 

layer. This coefficient is incorporated into the equation for the SML:

The equation for layer 2 is similar to Equation (2), with the difference that A0(xs) is 

replaced by Amix (at mmix), which is the excess 210Pb activity at the bottom of the SML. It is 

assumed that no reworking takes place below the SML, and that the SAR is constant 

through both layers (?(SML)= ?(layer2)). The SAR is calculated from the layer below the SML. 

Linear sedimentation rates are a function of porosity and SAR. As a result of 

sediment compaction, linear sedimentation rate decreases with depth in cores. To 

circumvent this problem of differential compaction, 210Pb activity profiles were plotted 

against cumulative mass depth by intergrading dry bulk density values over depth (Figure 

3.11). This provides SARs that are independent of compaction, which allows for better 

comparison between cores (Boer et al., 2006).

Pre-industrial baseline values were determined in subsurface sediment samples dated 

with 210Pb as approximately 150 years old (cf. section 3.1.3). Baselines were determined 

separately for the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyons (Table 7.1). These EFs compare 

present-day normalised trace metal contents with pre-industrial normalised contents of 

150 years ago (cf. section 3.1.2).  

As shown in Equation (5), Fe was used as the normaliser. Among various proxies for 

potential trace metal carriers, such as Al and Fe for terrigenous aluminosilicates, Ca and 

CaCO3 for pelagic skeletal carbonate, and Corg for organic matter, Fe and Al showed the 

largest number of significant positive correlations with trace metals. However, as Fe had 

the highest accuracy and the strongest correlations to trace metals Fe was chosen for the 

normalisation of trace metals. No indication in the data was found referring secondary 

diagenetic enrichment of trace metals played a significant role. The selection of the 

normaliser is thoroughly discussed in Chapter 7, section 7.2.4. on pg. 195. 

An EF value varying between 0.5 and 1.5 was interpreted to indicate a predominantly 

natural origin for the element in the sediment, while values greater than 1.5 indicate 

enrichment by either natural processes (e.g. contributions from biota) or anthropogenic 

influences. EF values lower than 0.5 can reflect mobilisation and loss of these elements 

relative to the conservative element, or could indicate an overestimation of the baseline 

metal contents (e.g. Zhang, 1995; Mil-Homens et al., 2006).

3.3.4. Inventories and percentages of excess trace metals over the last

The difference between trace metal concentrations in the mix and deep sample (see 

section 3.1.3) corresponds to the excess metal content gathered over the last 150 years 

([trace metalxs]). Finally, inventories of excess trace metals were calculated by multiplying 

excess trace metal concentration with cumulative dry mass of the sediment column (CDM) 

considered in the mix sample:

4.1. Introduction 

4.1.1. Different types of sediments and the importance of their study 

The oceans of the world represent a natural depository for the dissolved and 

particulate products of continental weathering. After being discharged into the ocean by 

rivers, part of the dissolved load precipitates by biological and geochemical processes and 

is deposited on the ocean floor along with detritic sedimentary material. 

Ocean sediments are heterogeneous with regard to their composition, displaying a 

considerable degree of geographical variation. Due to the origin and formation of the 

components various sediment types can be distinguished: lithogenic sediments which are 

transported and dispersed into the ocean as detrital particles, either as terrigenous 

particles (derived from land, which is most frequently the case) or as particles nourished 

by immersed outcrops (having only local importance); biogenic sediments which are 

directly constructed by organisms or are formed by accumulation of loose skeletal 

fragments; authigenic sediments which precipitate directly out of solution as new 

formations, or are a result of changes occurred when the pre-existing particles come into 

contact with the solution (Fütterer, 2006). 

Lithogenic sediments on continental shelves reflect prevailing climatic conditions that 

affect chemical and physical weathering and transport processes, the geology of the 

source areas, and oceanographic processes. Coarse sediments (gravel and sands) are 

carried as bedload over the seabed and are deposited close to the mainland while finer 

particles (silt and clay) are transported in suspension and are therefore dispersed over 

large distances by currents. Part of the suspended matter transported over the shelf may 

settle and form ephemeral or more permanent fine-grained deposits on the shelf 

(Abrantes, 2005). 

Minerals like plagioclases are good indicators of “fresh” lithogenic sediment because 

they are less resistant than most other common rock-forming minerals to weathering 

processes (Meunier, 2005), especially in the marine environment (Rothwell, 1989). Table

4.1 shows the total dissolution time of silica in minerals according to Lasaga (1984). 

Although this study does not refer to the marine environment it clearly illustrates the wide 

range of dissolution rates of various common minerals. 

The provenance of sediments from different source areas with different lithologies 

may be distinguished through the assemblage of minerals present in the fine fraction. 

Especially minerals in the clay-size range are susceptible to erosion and dispersal by 

fluvial and aeolic transport, and transport by seabed currents and gravitational 

movements (Ehrmann et al., 1992). Generally, clay minerals are not very susceptible to 

important mineralogical and chemical transformations during transport and after 

deposition in the marine environment. However, if the transport is over a long distance or 

if the minerals spend enough time in the marine environment, subtle changes do occur 

(referred to as “crystallographic scarring” by Millot, 1964 and Segonzac, 1969). An 

example is the increase of illite 

crystallinity order with increasing 

exposure to the marine environment, 

resulting from incorporation of Al into 

the crystal structure (Nemecz, 1981; 

Millot, 1964; Oliveira et al., 2002).  

Based on these general 

observations, the distribution of fine-

grained material in marine sediments 

and of clay mineral associations which 

characterise these fine fractions have 

been widely used in studies of recent 

sedimentary dynamics, as indicators for 

provenance, dispersal and deposition of fine-grained sediments (e.g. Karlin, 1980; Honjo 

et al., 1982; Zöllmer &amp;amp; Irion, 1993; Berner &amp;amp; Wefer, 1994; Oliveira et al., 2002; Kairyte et 

al., 2005; Morais et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007). 

Studies of the biogenic component in the fine fraction of marine sediments have 

shown the potential use of calcareous nannoplankton and diatoms as tracers of specific 

water masses and as paleoenvironmental tracers (e.g. Findlay &amp;amp; Flores, 2000; Salgueiro 

et al., 2008; Cochran &amp;amp; Neil, 2010).

4.1.2. Different types of sedimentary deposits on the shelf 

Approximately 70 % of the continental shelf surface worldwide is covered with relict 

sediment, i.e. sediment deposited during the last glacial period under conditions different 

from today’s, especially at times when the sea level was comparatively low (Emery, 

1968). The fine-grained constituents of shelf sediments were eluted during the rise of the 

sea level in the Holocene and exported over the edge of the shelf to the adjacent 

continental slope. The remaining sediment, covering large areas of modern shelf seabed, 

consists of relatively coarse sandy material (Milliman et al. 1972; Milliman &amp;amp; Summerhays, 

1975). It is therefore assumed that fine-grained sediments contained in present shelf 

deposits are of relatively recent age. 

Similar to most other continental shelves worldwide (e.g. Emery, 1968), the central 

Portuguese shelf is characterised by the presence of various types of sedimentary 

deposits, which reflect the interplay of different processes (e.g. long-term variations in 

sea level, sediment discharge from rivers, reworking of sediments by tides and currents, 

sheltering from main swell by capes). The fine fraction was chosen to be studied as it is 

the sediment fraction which is common to all shelf deposits. In addition, it is the 

prevailing fraction in sediments of deeper areas like the adjacent submarine canyons and 

open slopes, which are subject of Part III of this thesis. 

4.1.3. Objectives of Chapter 4 

The main objectives of this chapter are:  

1) to describe the bulk and clay mineralogy of the fine fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm) from surface 

sediments collected in the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelves and upper slopes; 

2) to compare results from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf with those from other areas 

of the Portuguese shelf with a different regional setting; 

3) to identify the main sources of fine-grained sediments in the study area, and gain 

insight in prevailing dispersal processes acting on the shelf. 

      

4.2. General composition of surface sediments 

 Surface sediments from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf are dominated by sand-sized 

material. Below 80 m WD (~outer shelf), fine-grained sediments are considerably more 

abundant on the Lisbon and Setúbal shelves compared to other areas of the Portuguese 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 78 

shelf. Gravel occurs in low percentages in this area, contrasting with the adjacent 

Estremadura shelf. According to Dias (1987) the percentage of mica in surface sediments 

of the Lisbon and Setúbal shelves is relatively high not only for the Portuguese shelf but 

also comparing to other shelves around the world. Most of the shelf sediment has bulk 

carbonate contents below 30 % and sediments with higher contents of carbonates 

correspond to sandy deposits of the middle part of the Sines and Setúbal shelves and of 

the outer shelf / upper slope more in general (Figure 2.4). 

 

4.3. Grain size in the fine fraction of surface sediments 

The mean grain size of the fine fraction of surface sediments of the Lisbon-Setúbal-

Sines continental shelf shows no obvious geographic trend in distribution. Relatively 

higher values occur in different parts of the study area such as the upper reaches of the 

Cascais, Lisbon and Setúbal Canyon, off the Sado Estuary and also in the southernmost 

part of the study area close to Cape Sines. The mean grain size values seem therefore to 

have no relationship with water depth or to the type of sedimentary deposits. Mean grain 

size values range from 6.1 to 7.4 µm on the Lisbon shelf and between 4.9 and 7.7 µm 

and 5.0 and 9.8 µm on the Setúbal and Sines shelves, respectively. Modal grain sizes 

span a narrow range of values on the Lisbon shelf (6.5 – 7.8 µm) compared to the 

Setúbal and Sines shelves (4.6 – 11.0 µm and 4.6 – 31.2 µm, respectively). These modal 

grain sizes do not show a relationship with water depth (data not shown). 

On the other hand, contents of clay-sized particles show clear spatial distribution 

patterns (Figure 4.1). Relatively low contents of clay-sized particles (17 to 23 %) are 

found on the Lisbon shelf. In accordance, contents of silt are higher on the Lisbon shelf 

compared to those from the Setúbal and Sines shelves. However, a more reliable 

comparison between different shelf areas is made when sediments from similar 

sedimentary deposits are compared. Figure 4.2a compares the grain size spectra of the 

fine fraction of surface sediments from the Tagus and Sado mud patches (fine fraction &gt; 

90 %). Sediments from the Sado mud patch appear slightly finer-grained than those of 

the Tagus mud patch, with fine fraction modes of, respectively, 8 – 9 µm and 9 – 11 µm 

(Figure 4.2a).

Figure 4.1. Content of clay-sized particles in the fine fraction of surface sediments from the Lisbon-Setúbal-
Sines shelf and upper slope. 

 

The relative proportions of clay and silt in the fine fraction shows considerable spatial 

variation in the area. Paradoxically, the higher percentages of clay-sized material are 

found in deposits with overall low content of fine sediment (&amp;lt;63 µm), whereas low 

percentages of clay-size material occur in deposits rich in fine-grained material (Figures 

4.1 and 4.2b). The reasons for this inverse relationship will be discussed in section 4.6.3. 

 

4.4. Fine-fraction bulk mineralogy 

Lithogenic detrital components of marine sediments, despite all regional variability, 

are composed of only a few common minerals. Next to quartz, which remains largely 

unaltered, even after prolonged weathering, phyllosilicates (most of them clay minerals) 

represent the most common end product of complete weathering of metamorphic and 

igneous rock. Consequently, this group represents the most important mineral constituent 

in sediments, next to quartz and biogenic minerals. To a lesser degree, terrigenous 

detritus contains unweathered minerals like feldspars. In general, the biogenic minerals 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 80 

contributing most to sediment formation are carbonate minerals in the form of calcite, 

Mg-calcite and aragonite, and biogenic opal in the form of amorphous SiO2·nH2O. 

Consequently, the bulk mineralogy of fine fraction shelf surface sediments of the 

Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf is qualitatively monotonous. Although varying in relative 

abundance, only seven different minerals / groups of minerals were identified (Table 4.2): 

Quartz (Qz), Calcite (Cc), Phyllosilicates (Phy), Plagioclases (Plg), K-Feldspars (K-F), 

Aragonite (Arg) and Mg-Calcite (Mg-Cc). 

 

 

4.4.1. Quartz 

Quartz constitutes between 12 and 51 % of the fine sediment fraction of the Lisbon-

Setúbal-Sines shelf (Figure 4.3). On the Lisbon shelf, the highest contents are found at 

shallower water depths, and the lowest contents at the shelfbreak and in the upper 

reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. On the Setúbal shelf the highest contents of 

quartz appear in the northwestern part, almost in connection with areas of high quartz 

contents on the Lisbon shelf, and also in sandy deposits off the Sado Estuary. On the 

Sines shelf quartz contents are highest in sandy deposits of the inner shelf (&amp;lt;50 m WD). 

Figure 4.11a shows the statistical distribution (median, percentiles 25 and 75 and 

extremes) of fine fraction quartz content for different classes of fine sediment content 

(&amp;lt;63 µm). The classes of sedimentary deposits are also the ones indicated in Figure 4.3.

Sedimentary deposits composed of more than 25 % of fine sediment fraction have the 

highest contents of quartz in the fine fraction (Figure 4.11a).

4.4.2. Phyllosilicates 

Concentrations of phyllosilicates between 26 and 32 % are found in the Tagus mud 

patch and even higher contents (&gt; 40 %) are found in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 4.4). 

On the Setúbal shelf three areas show enrichments in phyllosilicates: sediments in the 

outlet of the Sado Estuary (59 %); the Sado mud patch (reaching 40 %) and the upper 

Setúbal Canyon (reaching 39 %). On the Sines shelf, percentages of phyllosilicates tend 

to be lower than 20 % and only on the inner shelf off the central coastal arc contents are 

higher than 25 % (Figure 4.4). 

In general, phyllosilicates seem to accumulate in areas that are relatively sheltered 

from intense wave and current energy, like in submarine canyons, on mud patches off the 

Tagus and Sado rivers and in estuaries. Since these are also the areas where fine-grained 

sediments tend to accumulate, phyllosilicate content in the fine fraction, and content of 

fine fraction in the total sediment appear positively correlated (Figure 4.11b). However, 

higher percentages of phyllosilicates are also found in some sandy samples (FS &amp;lt;10 %) 

located close to phyllosilicate sources (e.g. the outlet of the Sado Estuary and the inner 

shelf off the central coastal arc between Tróia and Sines). 

Despite this positive relationship between phyllosilicate content and the amount of 

fine fraction in shelf deposits, a negative correlation was found between the clay content 

and the amount of fine fraction in the total sediment (Figure 4.2b). These two 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 82 

observations seem not to be in accordance since clay minerals constitute a large portion 

of the family of phyllosilicates. However, a large portion does not mean all. Muscovites 

are phyllosilicates of which the size ranges from 0.4 to 100 µm and they represent an 

important mineral constituent of the samples here presented and can be identified even in 

the bulk mineralogy (cf. Figure 3.8). Therefore, all muscovites contained in the fine 

fraction contribute to the phyllosilicates while only a part of these muscovites (those that 

have a diameter less than 2 µm) are counted as clay fraction. Muscovites in the clay 

fraction are counted as illite since there is no way of differentiating both minerals through 

normal XRD procedures. 

 

4.4.3. Feldspars 

Plagioclase in the fine fraction has a relatively well-defined spatial distribution 

pattern. High concentrations occur on the Lisbon shelf, especially close to the outlet of 

the Tagus Estuary, and extend to the northwest Setúbal shelf (Figure 4.5). High contents 

of plagioclase also occur on the inner Sines shelf (15 – 23 %). In general, the higher 

mean concentrations of plagioclase in the fine fraction are found in deposits with contents 

of fine fraction higher than 25 % (Figure 4.11c). 

In the same way as plagioclase, contents of K-feldspar generally decrease with water 

depth (Figure 4.6). The highest values occur in the sandy deposits of the inner shelf 

especially at the shallowest depths. 

 

4.4.4.Carbonates 

In general, contents of calcite are below 25 % on the Lisbon shelf, and above 25 % 

and up to 62 % on the Setúbal and Sines shelf, except near the shore (Figure 4.7). There 

is no relationship between the content of this biogenic mineral and the amount of fine 

fraction in the sediment. The areas with higher terrigenous input near the outlets of the 

Tagus and Sado estuaries are well highlighted by concentrations of calcite lower than 

25 % (see pink dots in Figure 4.7). 

Aragonite occurs in significant amounts (&gt; 3 %) on the inner and middle Setúbal 

shelf, but it is less common on the Sines shelf, and virtually absent in the sampled area of 

the Lisbon shelf (Figure 4.8). Across the Setúbal and Sines inner shelves there is a 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 83

southward decrease in aragonite content. Aragonite content is clearly inversely related to 

the amount of fine fraction (Figure 4.11f). 

Significant contents of Mg-calcite (&gt; 5 %) only occur on the inner and middle 

shelves. The distribution is rather scattered on the Setúbal and Sines shelves, without 

clear geographical pattern. As for aragonite, Mg-calcite occurs mainly in sandy deposits 

(Figure 4.9). 

The lithogenic against biogenic mineral (L/C) ratio (Phy+Qz+Felds/CC+Mg-Cc+Arg) 

highlights the areas most affected by fresh lithogenic sediment input. The whole Lisbon 

shelf in general shows high values for this ratio (&gt; 3). On the Setúbal and Sines shelves, 

high values (&gt; 3) occur in the Sado mud patch, in the Sado outlet and on the inner shelf 

bordering the central and southern part of the coastal arc between Tróia and Sines 

(Figure 4.10). 

 

4.4.5. Comparison to the adjacent open slope and canyon environments 

The bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments from the Lisbon-

Setúbal-Sines outer shelf and upper slope (100–500 m WD) is quite variable, displaying 

strong along-shelf gradients. Lithogenic/carbonate ratios are comparable on the Sines 

outer shelf (100 - 200 m WD) and upper slope (200 – 500 m WD) (Figure 4.10), with 

ratio ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 and from 0.5 to 1.5, respectively. As shown in Chapter 6, the 

surface sediment layer (0 - 0.5 cm) of two multicores collected from the Sines upper slope 

(280 and 490 m) had comparable L/C ratios (0.9 and 1.1) to those in grab samples from 

the Sines upper slope. 

Further down the Sines open slope, in depths &gt; 1000 m, the L/C ratio increases to 

values between 1.2 and 1.5 as a result of an increase of phyllosilicates and slight 

decrease of calcite relative to upper slope sediments (compare Figure 4.4 and 4.7 with 

Figure 6.10). Surface sediments from the lower Setúbal Canyon (&gt; 2000 m WD) show 

even higher L/C ratios between 1.7 and 2.0 (Figure 6.12a), similar to values found for 

surface sediments from the Lisbon shelf and certain parts of the Setúbal shelf (Figure 

4.10).

4.5. Clay-fraction mineralogy 

Clay minerals are of special importance, not only because they constitute the largest 

portion of fine-grained and non-biogenous sediment, but also because they have the 

special geochemical property of absorbing and easily giving off ions, a property which will 

be further discussed in Chapter 5. Clay minerals are mostly formed by the weathering of 

primary, rock forming aluminous silicates, like feldspar, hornblende and pyroxene, or 

volcanic glass. Kaolinite, chlorite, illite, and smectite, representing the four most important 

groups of clay minerals, are typically formed under very different conditions of 

weathering. Consequently, the analysis of their qualitative and quantitative distribution 

may allow to make inferences on origin and transport, weathering and hydrolysis, and 

therefore on climate conditions of the source region of the clay minerals (Biscaye, 1965; 

Chamley, 1989). 

The mineralogy of the clay fraction of shelf sediments is qualitatively monotonous. 

Only four different groups of minerals were identified yet, their percentages can vary 

significantly (Table 4.3): illite (54 – 80 %), kaolinite (18 – 40 %), smectite (1 – 12 %) 

and chlorite (0 – 3 %).

samples from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf and upper slope.

Kaolinite 30 18 – 40 26 – 32 

Smectite 2 1 – 12 2 – 3 

Chlorite 1 0 – 3 0 – 1 

 

4.5.1. Illite 

Illite is the most abundant clay mineral in ocean sediments. As a typical terrigenous 

mineral, it occurs in distinctly higher concentration in sediments at mid-latitudes of the 

northern oceans, which are surrounded by great land masses. 

Contents of illite in the study area show a southward increase and also some 

enrichment with increasing water depth. Both Tagus and Sado mud patches have 

contents between 61 and 69 % while values over 72 % occur almost exclusively on the 

Sines shelf (Figure 4.12). Excluding deposits with less than 10 % of fine sediments, it 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 90 

seems that contents of illite are inversely related to the amount of fine fraction present in 

shelf deposits (Figure 4.13a). As such, the distribution of illite seems the opposite of that 

of kaolinite, which tends to have higher contents in fine-grained deposits fed by river 

input. 

In the study area the Esquevin Index (EI) varies between 0.24 (Fe-rich illites) and 0.67 

(Al-rich illites). In shallow sandy deposits EI values are higher while in the predominantly fine-

grained deposits of the shelfbreak, the mud patches and the upper canyon reaches values 

tend to be lower, which means that Fe-rich illites predominate. 

The Kubler Index (KI) shows higher values, representing lower crystallinity in deposits 

with higher contents of fine fraction. The highest KI values (lower crystallinity) occur on the 

Lisbon shelf where fine-grained sediments predominate (Figure 4.15).

4.5.2. Kaolinite 

The distribution of kaolinite in marine sediments depends on the intensity of chemical 

weathering in its source region and the essential patterns of eolian and fluvial transport. 

Due to its concentration at equatorial and tropical latitudes, kaolinite is usually referred to 

as the “clay mineral of low latitudes” (Griffin et al., 1968). 

As already mentioned above, the distribution of kaolinite shows opposite trends to 

that of illite, decreasing in southward direction. The highest concentrations are associated 

to the outlets of the Tagus and Sado estuaries. Conspicuously high contents, reaching 

32 % are also found just offshore of the central part of the Tróia – Sines coastal arc 

(Figure 4.16). 

For an easy description on the variation of the kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) the 

author divided the index values in 5 classes according to Figure 4.17. This classification is 

based solely on the data from the present thesis. Kaolinite on the Lisbon shelf is mostly of 

relatively “crystalline” nature (low indexes). On the Setúbal and Sines shelf areas the 

crystallinity is more variable, with KCI values indicating the occurrence of both relatively 

“crystalline” and “very degraded” kaolinites. The latter are found mostly in shallower 

sandy deposits near the shore (Figure 4.13c).  

 

4.5.3. Smectite 

Smectite is generally considered as an indicator of a “volcanic regime” (Griffin et al. 

1968). High smectite concentrations are usually observed in regions of volcanic activity, 

distant from major landmasses so that dilution with terrigenous sediment including other 

clay mineral is low. The low smectite concentration in the North Atlantic is due to 

terrigenous detritus inputs which are rich in illites and chlorites (Fütterer, 2006). 

In the study area smectite concentrations are higher on the Lisbon shelf and in the 

northern part of the Setúbal shelf (Figure 4.18). The highest values (8 – 12 %), however, 

are found just offshore the central part of the coastal arc between Tróia and Sines. 

 

4.5.4.Chlorite 

Worldwide the distribution of chlorite in deep-sea sediments is essentially inversely 

related to the pattern of kaolinite. Although chlorite is distributed relatively 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 94 

homogeneously over the oceans, its highest concentration is measured in the polar 

regions, and therefore chlorite is referred to as the “high latitude mineral” (Griffin et al. 

1968). 

In the study area the spatial distribution of chlorite is a bit scattered with no clear 

trend (Figure 4.19). This may be related to its low abundance (0 – 3 %), on which the 

error associated to the XRD measurements (~1 %) has a relatively large effect. 

Nonetheless, median contents of chlorite tend to decrease with increasing contents of fine 

fraction in shelf deposits (Figure 4.13g). 

 

4.5.5. Comparison to the adjacent open slope and canyon environments 

Kaolinite is a good tracer for the dispersal of fine-grained sediment from the shelf to 

the open slope and canyon environments, since its distribution clearly reflects lithogenic 

sediment input from land, and it is degraded with time in the marine environment. On the 

Sines outer shelf/upper slope, percentages of kaolinite vary between 18 and 29 % (Figure 

4.16), comparable to contents found on the Sines open slope (490 - 3900 m WD) which 

vary between 21 and 27 %. In the middle and lower reaches of Setúbal Canyon (&gt; 

2000 m WD), surface sediments have kaolinite contents that span a narrower range of 

values (26 - 27 %). Although contents of kaolinite show little variation throughout the 

Sines margin the kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) varies considerably. On the outer 

shelf/upper slope the KCI goes from 0.0039 to 0.0160 (from relatively crystalline to more 

degraded kaolinites, respectively) with some tendency to decrease with increasing water 

depth. On the adjacent open slope the crystallinity index reflects a similar variation 

between crystalline to degraded kaolinites (KCI 0.0038 – 0.0180). Finally, kaolinite in 

surface sediments from the lower Setúbal Canyon has relatively high crystallinity (KCI 

0.0025-0.0045).

4.6. Discussion 

4.6.1. The clay mineralogy context of the Lisbon and Setúbal shelves 

Exhaustive data on clay mineral distribution in the world ocean sediments were 

successively provided by Biscaye (1965), Griffin et al. (1968) and Rateev et al. (1969). 

These data, augmented with subsequent information published by different authors, were 

reviewed and discussed by Windom (1976), who proposed average percentage values for 

the four major groups of clay minerals identified in surface deposits of the world main 

ocean basins (Chamley, 1989). Such average values have so far not been published for 

the bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm). 

The relative proportions of the various clay minerals in marine sediments is a 

function of their original source, the climate conditions of the source region, their mode of 

transport to the area of deposition – aeolian or volcanic transport, or transport by means 

of water currents or ice – and finally the route of transportation (Petschick et al., 1996). 

On a global scale, the particular influence which, climate, weathering on the continents, 

wind patterns, riverine transport, and oceanic currents have on the distribution of 

different clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, smectite, and chlorite) is relatively well-defined. 

The assemblage of clay minerals and their proportions in the study area (Table 4.3) 

are in accordance with what Windom (1976) described as typical for the principal clay 

mineral groups in the &amp;lt;2 µm fraction of seabed sediments for the North Atlantic: illite &gt; 

50 %, kaolinite 10 - 20 %, smectite &amp;lt;20 % and chlorite &amp;lt;10 %. This assemblage of 

minerals reflects limited influence of hydrolytic processes, which are more important in 

low-latitude humid climate areas, and the predominance of direct physical rock erosion 

under colder climatic conditions. 

On a regional scale, clay mineralogical variability is less obvious given the relatively 

small geographic area it comprises. When comparing between muddy deposits from 

different parts of the western Iberian margin, some differences in clay mineral 

assemblages are still observed. The clay mineralogy of the Tagus and Sado mud patches 

(Figure 4.20) is different from that of the northern mud patches located on the shelf off 

Porto and Galicia (Figure 4.20). The Douro mud patch is located to the northwest of the 

mouth of the Douro River in water depths of 65–130 m. It is about 8–18 km wide and 

42 km long, and its western boundary is delimited by rocky outcrops. The Galicia mud 

patch is situated further north off the Minho River at a water depth of 110–120 m. It is a

 98 

narrow north-south oriented strip of 50 km long and 2–3 km wide (Dias et al., 2002a). 

The Douro mud patch consists mostly of silty material, whereas the Galicia mud patch is 

constituted of finer grained silty-clayey material at its centre (Dias et al., 2002b and 

Oliveira et al., 2002).

shelf: a) Galicia, Douro (Oliveira et al., 2002); b) Tagus and Sado mud patches. The location of samples 
studied from these mud patches is shown. 

 

In these northern deposits the contents of kaolinite and smectite are lower than 

those found in the Tagus and Sado mud patches (Figure 4.20), whereas contents of illite 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 99

and chlorite are higher than in the southern mud patches. A relative increase of illite and 

chlorite toward more northerly latitude is what would generally be expected according to 

Windom (1976), yet in this case the geology of the river basins draining to those areas is 

the more likely reason for the differences between northern and southern mud patches. 

Low-grade metamorphic rocks (e.g. micaschists) and chloritic shales, and granite, 

potential sources of chlorite and illites, respectively, dominate the watersheds of the 

Douro, Minho and Vigo rivers (Ribeiro et al., 1979), whereas these lithologies are 

uncommon in both the Tagus and Sado basins (see Chapter 2). On the other hand, the 

geology of the Tagus and Sado basins is characterised by abundant outcrops of Tertiary 

sedimentary rocks enriched in kaolinite and smectite (Pimentel, 1997). Although both 

kaolinite and smectite are commonly available in the watersheds of the Tagus and Sado 

rivers, the increase of kaolinite in deposits of the central Portuguese shelf is more evident 

than that of smectite, probably because the latter remains longer in suspension whereas 

kaolinite settles more rapidly. This difference is due to the small size (&amp;lt;1 ?m) of smectite 

crystallites and to their ability to agglomerate into low-density aggregates (Meunier, 

2005). 

 

4.6.2. Bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments of the 

central Portuguese shelf 

In order to study the mineralogical characteristics of the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf in 

a broader, regional context, data on fine-fraction mineralogy obtained in the present 

study were compared with data from the shelf adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon published 

by Oliveira et al. (2007), and data from the Aveiro shelf published by Abrantes (2005). 

The methodology used in the laboratory to analyse the samples was the same in all three 

studies. However, different from the present study, the other two studies considered also 

the accessories minerals (i.e. minerals occurring with a mean concentration &amp;lt;1 % such 

as siderite, opal, haematite, pyrite). To make the data sets comparable, the percentage of 

each mineral from the other areas was recalculated after removing the accessories 

minerals. 

The bulk mineralogy of the fine fraction of surface sediments as described by the 

above authors is qualitatively similar to that found in the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines 

shelves. All the main minerals found in the southern area are also present on the shelf 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 100 

adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon and on the Aveiro shelf (Table 4.4). However, dolomite 

was only identified on the shelf immediately north of the Nazaré Canyon and on the 

Aveiro shelf. This mineral, which occurs in high concentration (&gt; 8 %) in both areas at 

depths greater than 100 m, is considered to be derived from dolomitic rocks outcropping 

in both areas (Abrantes, 2005 and Oliveira et al., 2007). On the other hand, Mg-calcite 

was only identified in the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines area on the inner and middle shelf. 

The remaining minerals are the same in both areas: phyllosilicates, quartz, calcite, K-

feldspars, plagioclase and aragonite. Concentrations of feldspars (plagioclase and K-

feldspars) are higher in the shelf areas adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon (median of 10 % 

for each of both groups of minerals) than on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf (mean of 8 

and 5 %, respectively) and the Aveiro shelf (7 and 6 %, respectively). Conversely, 

phyllosilicates have higher median concentrations in the southern area. Mean 

concentrations of quartz are similar for the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf and the shelf 

adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon (Table 4.4) while values are lower on the Aveiro shelf. 

This is probably a result of dilution by calcite which is extremely high (&gt; 80 %) in some 

parts of the Aveiro shelf where rock outcrops predominate.

The Lithogenic minerals/Carbonates ratio (Qz+Phy+Felds/Cc+Mg-Cc+Dol+Arg) reach 

values of 52 on the Aveiro shelf, 25 on the shelf adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon and only 

12 in the studied area of the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf. It should be noted, however, that 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 101

in the latter area the shallowest sediment samples are more than 10 km away from the 

Tagus outlet. In the northern shelf areas these high ratios (&gt; 6) are achieved in the inner 

shelf (less than 5 km from the coast) and rapidly decrease to constantly lower values 

(&amp;lt;6) in the middle and outer shelf while in the Lisbon shelf values around 12 are still 

found close to the shelfbreak (~30 km from the Tagus Estuary). This dispersal of the L/C 

ratio suggests a more efficient transport of terrigenous sediments from the mainland to 

the shelfbreak in the Lisbon shelf compared to the other northern shelf areas. 

The highest L/C values on the Aveiro shelf are found north from the Ria de Aveiro 

coastal lagoon (Figure 4.21), where they seem to be related to areas of important coastal 

erosion. In this area the highest rates of coastal retreat of the Portuguese coast are 

measured, with values between 3 and 9 m year-1 (Andrade et al., 2006); for the period 

between 1947 e 1958 Oliveira et al. (1982) determined a rate of retreat of 8 m year-1. 

Contents of phyllosilicates are higher on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf than on the 

shelf adjacent to Nazaré Canyon and the Aveiro shelf (Table 4.4), as illustrated by the 

Phy/Qz+Felds ratio (Figure 4.22). This is consistent with the observation that sedimentary 

deposits with fine fraction contents higher than 90 % are more widespread in the 

southern area (Figure 2.2). But even when sedimentary deposits with similar contents of 

fine sediments are compared those of the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf still have higher 

contents of phyllosilicates than the shelves further to the north. Deposits with fine fraction 

contents between 50 and 90 % have average contents of phyllosilicates of 12 % in the 

northern area, compared to 31 % in the southern area. This difference in phyllosilicates 

contents is most likely primarily related to the presence of rivers debouching on the 

southern shelf area, especially the Tagus River, delivering large volumes of fine-grained 

suspended sediment to the shelf. Differences in hydrodynamic regimes of northern and 

southern shelf areas may play an additional role. Whereas the Lisbon, Setúbal and part of 

the Sines shelves are sheltered by the Estremadura mainland from the prevailing swell 

coming from N and NW, favouring the settling of fine-grained material rich in 

phyllosilicates, the northern shelf is directly exposed to the highly energetic swell 

(Magalhães, 2001).

4.6.3. Sources of fine-grained sediment and its deposition on the Lisbon, 

Setúbal and Sines shelves 

 

Significance of the fine fraction in Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf deposits 

The Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf areas display a high variability of sedimentary 

deposits in terms of the dominant grain size. These sedimentary deposits show a general 

along-shelf gradient of decreasing fine fraction content from the Lisbon shelf to the Sines 

shelf, as well as an across-shelf gradient of decreasing grain size from the coast outward 

to deeper water. 

The along-shelf gradient is directly related to the supply of fine-grained material to 

the Lisbon shelf by rivers, and the sheltered position of this area. Given the present high 

sea-level stand, sediment discharged from estuaries to the shelf mainly consists of fine-

grained suspended material (e.g. Magalhães, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2008). From north to 

south, the Tagus River debouches on the Lisbon shelf, the Sado River (a smaller river) 

debouches on the Setúbal shelf, whereas the Sines shelf has no connection to any 

important river. 

The across-shelf gradient is easily explained by grain size sorting across the shelf as 

sediment is transported from the mainland to the deep sea and also by decreasing 

influence of wave energy on the seabed as water depth increases. 

Within the fine fraction of shelf deposits, significant variability is observed in terms of 

mineralogy and grain size distribution (and geochemistry as will be discussed in the next 

chapter) which essentially follow the above-mentioned general patterns. 

Mineralogical characteristics of the fine-grained sediment fraction reflect a general 

increase in sediment maturity from deposits with overall high content of fine sediment to 

deposits poor in fine-grained material: 

• There is a progressive increase of the KI and decrease of the EI (Figures 4.13b, 

c) from sandy deposits (fine-grained sediments &amp;lt;10 %) to mud deposits (fine-

grained sediments &gt; 90 %) which indicates that fresher illites occur in the latter 

deposits. This conclusion results from the fact that the more time the illites 

spend in the marine environment the higher order (lower KIs values) they 

achieve in their crystallographic structure by incorporating K+ (Millot, 1964; 

Nemecz, 1981). This same observation was made by Oliveira et al. (2002) in the 

northern Portuguese shelf. Furthermore, illites enriched in Fe (EI &amp;lt;0.3) are less 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 103

resistant in the marine environment than Al-enriched illites (EI &gt; 0.4) and 

therefore are the first to suffer modifications. Thus, fresh clay contents have 

higher contents of Fe-enriched illites (assuming all original illites for a given area 

have similar contents of Fe); 

•  The kaolinite crystallinity index shows less degraded kaolinites in the muddy 

deposits (Figure 4.13e); 

• Plagioclase contents also indicate less mature sediments in the muddy deposits 

however in this case the relationship is not so obvious in Figures 4.5 and 4.11c 

because, as it will be seen below, high contents of plagioclase are also present in 

some areas of the inner shelf (coarse sediment deposits) as a result of inputs 

from nearby sediment sources. 

Grain size characteristics of the fine-grained sediment fraction also show differences 

according to the overall contents of fine sediments. Higher percentages of clay-sized 

material are found in deposits with overall low content of fine sediment, whereas low 

percentages of clay-size material occur in deposits rich in fine-grained material (Figures 

4.1 and 4.2b). 

Sand deposits have therefore more mature fine fractions and have higher contents of 

clay-size particles while muddy deposits have less mature fine sediments and lower 

contents of clay-size particles. 

The most likely explanation for the relative increase in clay-sized particles within the fine 

fraction towards coarser deposits is that these particles cohesively attach to sand-sized 

particles, making their removal from waves and currents more difficult. Since nowadays 

the hydrodynamic conditions do not allow the deposition of clay-size particles where sand 

deposits occur, clay-size fraction material seem to be mainly relict particles, which were 

deposited during times when sea level was lower. On the other hand, sediments within 

the range of “sortable silt” (10-63 µm) were eluted from these sand deposits during the 

sea-level rise in the Holocene. Mud patches on the shelf and mud deposits found on the 

upper slope have a higher content of particles within the “sortable silt” range (Figure 

4.23). Possibly, these particles include both recent material sourced by present-day 

estuaries as well as relict material removed from the shallower deposits and transported 

offshore during the course of the Holocene sea-level rise.

Identification of fine sediment sources based on mineral distribution 

The mineralogy of the fine fraction reflects the variable input of two main marine 

sediment components: lithogenic material and biogenic carbonate. Generally, the 

importance of biogenic components only increase in areas where lithogenic input (from 

rivers, erosion of the coast, desert dust, etc) is not important. In accordance, the general 

southward increase of calcite on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf indicates a decreasing 

input of lithogenic material from the area off Tagus Estuary towards Cape Sines (Figure 

4.25). The following discussion referring to the identification of fine sediment sources 

based on mineral distribution will focus on each shelf area (Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines) at 

a time. 

 

On the Lisbon shelf (and upper slope), considering sediments from deposits with 

contents of fine sediments &gt; 50 %, plagioclase has a negative correlation with water 

depth (Figure 4.24a). This points to a progressive distance to the sediment source, in this 

case mainly the Tagus Estuary. Plagioclases are good indicators of “fresh” lithogenic 

sediment because, from the mineralogical assemblage found in the bulk mineralogy, they 

are the less resistant minerals to weathering processes (Meunier, 2005), especially in the 

marine conditions (Rothwell, 1989). 

Despite the obvious contributions of kaolinite from the Tagus River to the shelf this 

mineral does not show a negative correlation with water depth as plagioclases (Figure 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 107

4.24b). It seems therefore that in the Lisbon shelf another sediment source is contributing 

as well with sediments enriched in kaolinite.  

In the adjacent coastal area an important well known sediment source to the beach 

system are the sea-cliffs. The Mio-Pliocene deposits outcrop as sea-cliffs throughout the 

entire coastal arc between Traferia and Cape Espichel but only constitute part of the 

beach profile in the southern half of the coastal arc between Fonte da Telha Beach and 

Cape Espichel (Figure 2.12). Between Fonte da Telha Beach and the Albufeira Lagoon, 

cliffs are made of Plio-Pleistocene detritic deposits, have slopes higher than 45º and 

accumulate considerable amounts of sediments as dejection cones at the base of the cliff. 

In contrast, south of the Albufeira Lagoon, Miocene clayey deposits predominate and cliffs 

get slopes around 70º with much smaller cones of dejection (Teixeira, 1990). In 

accordance, this author reports that the Plio-Pleistocene cliffs contribute with more 

sediment to the beach system than the Miocene cliffs as they are less resistant to aerial 

erosion. 

If one assumes the cliffs made up on Plio-Pleistocene deposits have a similar clay 

mineralogy signature to those cliffs with the same age found in the neighbour coastal arc 

between Tróia and Sines (Table 4.5) they may well be an additional source of kaolinites to 

the Lisbon shelf when storms remove sediments from the beach system. Since these 

same deposits are depleted of plagioclase they cannot represent a source of these 

minerals to the shelf.

The relatively high contents of plagioclase and kaolinite on the Lisbon shelf extend to 

the northwestern part of the Setúbal shelf (Figures 4.5 and 4.16) indicating that there 

might be some input of sediments from the Lisbon shelf to the northwestern Setúbal 

shelf. Relatively high contents of quartz on the Lisbon shelf also seem to extend to 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 108 

northwestern Setúbal shelf (Figure 4.3). Jouanneau et al. (1998) also considered the 

possibility of exchange between the two shelf areas based on the distribution of As, Se, 

Ni, and Mo in shelf sediments. In their view the Sado shelf (here referred to as Setúbal 

shelf) forms a specific domain where contributions from the Tagus River can be noticed 

but are of relatively minor importance compared to contributions from the Sado River. 

 

On the Setúbal shelf contents of carbonates are higher than on the Lisbon shelf, 

reflecting a decrease in lithogenic input. However, locally enhanced concentrations of 

plagioclase and kaolinite, highlight certain areas of the Setúbal shelf as terrigenous 

sediment depocentres, for example the Sado mud patch and the upper Setúbal Canyon. 

High contents of calcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite in the fine fraction of sandy deposits 

close to the inlet of the Sado Estuary (maximum values of 22, 13, and 24 %, respectively) 

indicate that terrigenous suspended sediment coming from the Sado Estuary is bypassing 

the sandy deposits of the inner shelf and only deposits on the Sado mud patch. Probably 

the upper Setúbal Canyon also receives some input from the Sado Estuary, although the 

estuarine signal is much weaker here than on the mid-shelf mud patch. This may either 

reflect an absolute decrease in particles reaching the upper canyon or a relative decrease 

due to dilution with particles coming from the shelf south of the canyon which have a 

different mineralogical signature (see Figures 4.5 and 4.7 for plagioclase and calcite, 

respectively). Most conceivably, mixing of material from the two sediment sources 

together creates a new mineralogical signature in the upper Setúbal Canyon. The 

sediment input to the Setúbal Canyon is further discussed in Chapter 6. 

 

On the Sines shelf, in general, lithogenic sediment input appears low and therefore 

carbonates, especially calcite, reach their highest values. There are several areas though 

where lithogenic input can be traced, especially on the inner shelf (Figure 2.25): 

1) The coastal area adjacent to the Sines shelf is characterised by beach-cliff profiles 

alternating with beach-dune profiles. The presence of Plio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs along the 

southern half of the coastal arc is the result of erosion of the coast which, according to 

Marques (1999), can reach coastal retreat rates around 0.5 m year-1. From the 

morphology of the sea-cliff [cf. photos iii) and iv) of Figure 2.13] it appears that the 

erosion of these cliffs is mainly caused by run-off, producing dejection cones at the base 

of the cliffs. Characteristics of the fine-fraction and clay-fraction mineralogy of these sea-



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 109

cliffs are presented in Table 4.5. High contents of phyllosilicates and relatively high 

contents of K-feldspars are found in the fine fraction, and high contents of kaolinite in the 

clay fraction. The beach sediments between Tróia and Sines are characterised by high 

contents of kaolinite in the clay fraction, especially in the central portion of the coastal arc 

(Jesus et al., 2006). According to Freitas et al. (1999) cliff debris contribute with up to 

90 % of the sediments in the beach system. Sea-cliffs are therefore an important 

sediment source for the beach system in this area. The transfer of these sediments to the 

shelf occurs during winter storms, when waves wash sediments off the backshore area of 

the beach. Studies of sediment dynamics in the coastal zone show that storm waves 

cause offshore sediment transport while fair-weather waves and swell return the 

sediments shoreward (e.g. Komar, 1976; Wright &amp;amp; Short, 1984; Lee et al., 1998; Van 

Rijn, 2009). Sand-sized particles are normally not transported deeper than the closure 

depth (the depth beyond which there is no significant seabed changes due to seasonality 

or to storms; it is around 6 and 15 m at Tróia and close to Sines, respectively – 

Quevauviller, 1988) while most of the fine-grained particles are washed from the sands 

and carried off to the inner shelf or even deeper. This is especially true for the southern 

half of the Tróia-Sines coastal arc where sea-cliffs are present and contribute with 

significant amount of fine material to the beach.

Contributions of sediments from the sea-cliffs to the shelf are best tracked by the K-

feldspar contents (Figure 4.26). On the inner shelf concentrations of this mineral reaches 

values higher than those found in the cliff sediments. This apparent enrichment results 

from sorting by the high hydrodynamic energy conditions found on the inner shelf. The 

more easily resuspendable minerals like phyllosilicates are selectively removed to settle in 

calmer areas. In addition to enrichment by winnowing, other sources of K-feldspars may 

contribute to high contents in inner shelf surface sediments, as discussed below. 

 

 
Figure 4.25. Interpolation of lithogenic/carbonates ratio for fine fraction surface sediments using an inverse 
distance weighted technique. 

 

2) The Santo André and Melides lagoons may represent another source of lithogenic 

sediment input to the shelf, even though their connections to the sea are closed during 

most of the year. An artificial inlet is opened every year in order to exchange the water of 

the lagoons. The mineralogy and geochemistry of bottom sediments from the Santo 

André Lagoon was studied by Jesus et al. (2007). The fine fraction of surface sediments 

from this lagoon is characterised by high contents of phyllosilicates (39 – 62 %) and 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 111

quartz (21 – 34 %), while plagioclase contents vary from 2 to 11 %. Sediment input from 

these coastal lagoons may be tracked more clearly by plagioclase contents. Once again as 

a result of hydrodynamic sorting, contents of plagioclase in inner shelf sediments are 

higher than those from the source. 

Jesus et al. (2007) found that the Santo André Lagoon has a specific geochemical 

signature (high contents of Mn and Pb) which can be tracked in the adjacent beach 

system. That study showed that even though the lagoon is opened to the sea only once 

per year it does leave a measurable signature in the sediments of the adjacent shelf. In 

the next chapter this topic will be discussed further.

weighted technique. 

 

3) The Sines sub-volcanic complex represents a third distinct source of lithogenic 

sediments that can be tracked in the southern part of the coastal arc. Part of the complex 

constituting the protruding Cape Sines crops out below sea-level, on the shelf adjacent to 

the cape. Since this massif is made of exotic rocks in comparison to the surrounding 



4. Mineralogy of shelf and upper slope surface sediments 

 112 

geology its imprint is relatively easy to track. In the fine fraction the most obvious mineral 

related to the Sines sub-volcanic complex is plagioclases. This mineral must be derived 

from the massif because the sea-cliffs contain only very low amounts of plagioclase (Table 

4.5). Plagioclase is enriched in the inner shelf (Figure 4.27) and in beach sediments close 

to the cape (Jesus et al., 2007). When studying the heavy mineral fraction of beach 

deposits between Tróia and Sines, Miranda et al. (2007) also found the signature of the 

Cape Sines subvolcanic complex in a marked increase in amphiboles and pyroxenes in the 

southernmost 10 km approaching the cape. Pombo et al. (2004) found a similar 

assemblage rich in amphiboles and pyroxenes in the inner shelf of the same area.

Whereas on the Sines inner shelf lithogenic input from the sea-cliffs, Sines 

subvolcanic massif and the coastal lagoon can be distinguished on the basis of

heavy mineral markers, these different sediment sources can not be distinguished further 

offshore on the middle shelf area below about 100 m WD (Figure 4.25). 

The above inferences on dispersal of inner shelf sediments nourished by the sea-cliffs 

and coastal lagoons are in accordance with current models of sedimentary dynamics for 

this coastal area. According to the SNIRLit (2010) (and references therein) the net 

longshore drift of sediments in the coastal area between Tróia and Sines is directed 

towards the south in most of the coastal stretch. For instance, Silva et al. (2007) reported 

southward longshore drifts in the Comporta Beach (15 km south from Tróia) and Maretec 

(2008) confirmed the southward drift for the southern part of the coastal arc. This last 

study included ADCP current measurements recorded throughout a year (April 2007 – 

April 2008) covering the entire water column above the inner shelf (40-60 m WD). In this 

area mean currents are parallel to the coastline and directed preferentially towards the 

south with current speeds mainly between 10 and 30 cm s-1, reaching 60 cm s-1 at the 

water surface at higher wind speed. Similar results were obtained with MOHID numerical 

model, considering the wind from different directions (Figure 4.28).

Only in the northernmost part of the coastal arc (Tróia Peninsula) where waves are 

refracted northeastward across the Sado submarine delta, net longshore drift of 

sediments is directed towards the north. In addition, during winter storms (representing a 

few days per year) the sediment transported otherwise southwards may undergo 

important redistribution towards the north as the longshore drift of sediments is 

temporarily reversed (Quevauviller, 1987).  

The sediment samples collected in the inner shelf correspond to a sediment column 

of ~15 cm and therefore contains an integrated signal which covers seasonal and 

interannual variability. The high contents of plagioclase in the inner shelf south of Santo 

André Lagoon is possibly related to contributions from the coastal lagoons when these are 

opened to the sea and also as a result of northward transport of sediments from the 

surrounding area of the Sines massif.  

 

In the following chapter elemental concentrations from surface sediments from the 

Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf will be presented. As referred to above, the combination of 

mineralogical data with elemental concentration data will allow a better identification of 

sediment sources and assessment of sediment dispersal.

5.1. Introduction 

The elemental composition of marine sediments is determined primarily by the 

mixture of particulate components that make up the bulk of the sediment. These 

components include lithogenic material derived from continental erosion, their 

composition reflecting the geology of the source area, as well as biogenic material 

produced in the marine environment. Trace elements, generally occurring in very low 

abundance at the Earth’s surface, may become enriched in certain marine deposits, due 

to their high affinity to particulate matter, and under influence of physical sediment 

sorting and diagenetic alteration. In general, enhanced concentrations of trace metals in 

recent surface sediments, especially in the continental shelf environment, reflect 

anthropogenic input of trace metals in addition to input from natural sources. The 

distinction of contributions from both sources and the study of the anthropogenic fraction 

of elements may be relevant not only for assessment of anthropogenic impact in marine 

environment but also to highlight pathways of recent sediment transport. For the latter 

purpose, particle-reactive chemical species which are adsorbed to the surface of particles 

are especially good tracers. Since the majority of anthropogenic contaminants are derived 

from the mainland they may be used to track recent input of terrigenous sediments and 

to identify the main depocentres of recent sediments. The potential of these tracers 

increases as the signatures of the potential sources are better known. 

A common misconception is to interpret environmental impact of trace metal 

contaminants and dynamics of their dispersal and accumulation solely on the basis of total 

concentration within the surface sediment. From this simplistic perspective, deposits with 

the highest concentration are considered to pose the greatest risk to the ecosystem and 

to represent the depocentres of recent sediments. However, the risk posed by trace metal 

contaminants is not merely a function of their concentration in the sediment, but also of 

their mobility and reactivity in the environment, the latter depending on chemical

characteristics of both the contaminant and the sedimentary substrate. Whereas trace 

elements may be loosely bound and bioavailable in one type of sediment, they may be 

tightly bound in another type of sediment (Horowitz, 1991). In addition to that, higher 

contents of trace metals in certain areas may be related to the presence of source-rocks 

which are naturally rich in these elements. In such case inferences on sediment transport 

assuming that trace metal enrichment is due to anthropogenic input will lead to erroneous 

results. 

The distinction of the natural and anthropogenic fraction through bulk concentrations 

is complicated by the unequal distribution of trace metals over different grain size 

fractions and different components of the mineral and organic matrix. For this reason, 

trace metal contents are usually assessed within a defined grain size fraction, and 

normalized against a common major element representative for the natural sediment 

fraction. Such normalization procedures are especially important where samples from 

different sedimentary settings are compared. After normalization, trace metal contents in 

contaminated recent sediments can be compared with contents in older, non-

contaminated sediments from a similar environmental setting. The observed recent excess 

in trace metal content can then be directly interpreted as the anthropogenic input. 

The main goals of the present chapter are: 

1) To determine concentrations of major and trace elements in the fine fraction of 

surface sediments from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf area; 

2) To assess the geographic patterns of trace metal enrichment in the studied shelf 

area; 

3) To infer about sources of trace metals and sediments in order to gain insight into 

the pathways of recent sediment transport in the studied shelf area. 

 

5.2. Spatial distribution and relationships between elements 

Table 5.1 shows the main descriptive statistics of major and trace element 

concentrations in surface sediments of the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelves. Overall, 

mean concentrations of Fe, Al, Ti, Mg, Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, As, Th and U are highest on the 

Lisbon shelf and lowest on the Sines shelf, whereas the reverse pattern is observed for 

Ca, Cr and Ni. Intermediate values are found on the Setúbal shelf. By closer inspection of 

distribution patterns of these elements in the different shelf areas, four groups of

elements with different distribution patterns can be distinguished (Figures 5.1 and 5.2; for 

those elements not shown in these figures consult Appendix 3):  

1) Ca; 

2) Fe, Al, Mg, Ti, Th, U; 

3) Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn;

The lowest concentrations of Ca occur on the Tagus and Sado mud patches, yet on 

the latter contents are slightly higher. Calcium occurs in highest concentrations in the fine 

fraction of inner shelf sandy deposits. Despite these generally high contents of Ca, 

adjacent to the Santo André and Melides lagoons concentrations decrease to 

concentrations similar to those found in the Tagus and Sado mud patches. Concentrations 

of Fe, Al, Mg, Ti, Th and U are relatively low in inner shore sandy deposits, increasing

with water depth, along with the general increase of fine fraction contents towards the 

open slope. Despite the general trend increasing northwards, highest concentrations of 

Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Mn are observed on the inner shelf close the mouths of the Tagus and 

Sado rivers. The highest Cr and Ni contents are associated with inner shelf sandy deposits 

of the Setúbal and Sines shelf. On these inner shelf areas there is a southwards increase 

of both these elements. The groups established according to their distribution patterns 

also appear from Spearman correlation analysis, as schematically represented in Figure 

5.3.

elements in surface sediments from the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf and upper open slope. Note: Ca is not 
represented in the diagram, due to its negative correlation with all other elements except Cr and Ni. 

 

Principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the complete dataset including all 

studied elements and all samples from the shelf and upper open slope reduced the spatial 

variation of the 14 analysed elements to 4 factors, which explain in total 80 % of the data 

variability. 

Factor 1 (42 %) appears to primarily distinguish between elements that prevail in 

sediments of contrasting grain size; Ti, U, Th, Al and Fe with negative loadings on Factor 

1 are most abundant in fine-grained deposits on the Lisbon shelf, whereas Ca, Ni and Cr 

with positive loadings on Factor 1 are most abundant in sandy deposits of the inner Sines 

shelf (Figure 5.4a and 5.5a). 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 124 

Factor 2 (19 %) distinguishes between elements that prevail in nearshore versus 

more offshore areas; Cr and Ni, most abundant in inner shelf sandy deposits, and Pb, As 

and Mn, most abundant in fine-grained deposits near the major river mouths, load 

negatively on Factor 2. Fe, Al and Mg, which have a wider, less confined distribution 

extending toward deeper water load positively on Factor 2 (Figure 5.4a and 5.5b).

Factor 3 (12 %) is determined mostly by negative loadings of Cu and Zn, which have 

higher concentrations in localised fine-grained sediment deposits offshore the major river 

mouths (Figure 5.5c). This factor is interpreted as showing the areas more affected by

anthropogenic input of trace metals. Of these two elements Cu is the one with the highest 

negative score for this factor meaning that it is the one with the better defined spatial 

distribution, with high contents in specific areas and low contents in most of the 

remaining area. As will be shown below, Cu is the least widespread of the trace elements 

showing recent enrichment.  

The formation of Factor 4 (7 %) is not entirely understood. Except Al, all elements 

scoring negatively on Factor 4 (all below 0.5) are trace elements which show 

anthropogenic enrichment (Figure 5.4c). The elements scoring positively are mostly the 

major elements with no evidence for enrichment. 

 

5.2.1. Comparison between shelf and deeper environments 

As discussed above, spatial variability in major and trace elemental concentration in 

sediments of the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf is considerable. However, no significant 

differences are found between elemental concentrations on the Sines outer shelf (100-

200 m WD) and the Sines upper slope (200-500 m WD), except maybe for Pb which 

seems to increase offshore (see Table A4.1 in Appendix A4).  

The surface sediments collected on the Sines slope (1000 – 3900 m WD) have 

consistently higher concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni than the mean concentration 

found in the Sines upper slope (Figure 7.3 – pg. 194 vs. Table A4.1). Lead on the other 

hand has consistently lower concentrations on the Sines open slope than the mean value 

obtained for the upper slope. This difference between Pb and the other trace metals 

points out to different pathways of transport and will be discussed further in Chapter 7. 

 

5.2.2. Selection of a normaliser 

In order to calculate enrichment factors (EFs), trace metal contents were normalised 

using a conservative common element (cf. Chapter 3). Since both common elements Fe 

and Al showed no significant difference of number and level of correlations with trace 

metals (Figure 5.3) and the analysis of both showed a good accuracy (&gt; 97 %), both 

appear suitable for normalising the trace element concentrations. Iron was chosen as 

normaliser in order to make enrichment factors calculated for shelf sediments comparable

to those obtained in Chapter 7 for the adjacent submarine canyons and open slope. For 

the latter there was a more specific reason for the use of Fe as normaliser. 

5.3. Relationships between trace elements and mineralogy 

It is commonly observed that trace metals and grain size show a linear relationship 

as trace elements tend to accumulate in the finer fractions (cf. section 5.1). In the 

present study, however, none of the studied elements shows a significant correlation 

higher than |0.45| with mean grain size, modal grain size or with the percentage of clay-

sized particles (Table 5.2).

The relationship between major and trace elements and bulk mineralogy is also 

summarised in Table 5.2. Phyllosilicates correlate with some trace elements (Cu and Zn) 

and Al and Fe while, as expected, carbonates correlate with Ca. On the other hand, the 

relationship between the various elements and clay mineralogy is less obvious, at least 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 128 

from a chemical point of view (cf. see below). Table 5.3 shows that kaolinite is the clay 

mineral with the highest positive correlations with trace elements while illite shows a 

negative correlation with trace elements. Smectite has some minor correlations with some 

trace elements. 

The adsorptive capacities of the various clay mineral groups for trace elements is 

highly variable, depending on the negative charge on the broken edges of the layered 

sheets that result from the isomorphic substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ in the tetrahedral layer, 

and Mg2+ or Fe2+ for Al3+ in the octahedral layers. In the case of kaolinite, very little 

substitution occurs. Thus, its net negative surface charge, and its potential to adsorb 

cations to external surfaces, is limited. This factor explains its relatively low cation 

exchange capacity (CEC) because the exchange process is limited to external surfaces. In 

contrast, isomorphic substitution can be extensive in the 2:1 smectite clay mineral group, 

particularly within the octahedral layers. As a result they exhibit a relatively high net 

surface charge that promotes cation adsorption. Moreover, smectites tend to exhibit a 

relatively high CEC because the individual sheets are weakly bound together, and cations 

and water can penetrate between the sheets and participate in exchange processes. 

Despite the above, in the study area kaolinite shows better correlation with trace metals 

than smectite. This may be partly related to the narrow range of values observed for 

smectite content (P25 - P75 = 2 - 3 %). In addition, as already seen in Chapter 4, 

kaolinite distribution on the Lisbon and Setúbal shelves appears to reflect input more 

closely than smectite. Since conceivably the rivers are also the main source of trace 

metals, it seems logical that trace metals are carried off the estuaries in association with 

aggregates formed by the more common kaolinites. Coatings of organic matter and Fe 

and Mn hydroxides precipitated on clay particles may further enhance the adsorptive 

capacity of clay minerals (Jenne, 1976).

5.4. Anthropogenic enrichment of trace metals in surface sediments 

5.4.1. Comparison to sediment quality guidelines 

The sediment quality guideline (SQG) of the National Oceanic Atmospheric 

Administration (NOAA), developed to assess biological effects of metal contamination, 

classifies different levels of metal concentration as “Effects Range-Low” (ERL) and “Effects 

Range-Medium” (ERM). These ERL and ERM represent, respectively, the 10th and 50th 

percentiles of the available dataset for different trace metal components (Long et al. 

1995). The ERMs are supposed to represent concentrations above which adverse 

biological effects are expected to be common, whereas ERLs represent concentrations 

below which effects are expected to be rare. Between these values effects are expected 

to happen occasionally. Obviously, this classification is rather arbitrary since it is merely 

based on the statistics of the available data, and chemical concentrations do not directly 

correspond to sediment toxicity (O’Connor &amp;amp; Paul, 2000). 

Concentrations of the trace elements considered in the present study (As, Pb, Zn, Cu, 

Cr and Ni) are found to exceed the ERL value in a considerable number of samples from 

the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf (Table 5.4). Concentrations of Pb, Cr and Ni exceed the 

ERM value in a number of samples in all three shelf areas. Lead, Zn and Cu show a 

southward decrease in the percentage of samples with contents above the ERL (Table 

5.4) whereas Cr shows a southward increase of samples exceeding the ERL and ERM. 

Nickel and As concentrations are above the ERL value in almost all samples, and Ni 

exceeds the ERM in a considerable number of samples, increasing towards the south.

5.4.2. Enrichment factors 

The level of trace metal enrichment in sediments can be assessed through different 

indexes and methods (e.g. Loring &amp;amp; Rantala, 1992). In this study, the enrichment of trace 

metals in surface sediments from the shelf was assessed through enrichment factors 

using Fe as the normaliser (cf. Chapters 3 and 7) and using trace metal concentrations of 

pre-industrial sediment (older than ~150 years) as baseline (cf. Chapter 3). Since a pre-

industrial baseline was not determined for As, enrichment could not be calculated for As. 

Lead, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni are variably enriched throughout the continental shelf and 

upper slope (Figure 5.6 and Table 5.5), locally by a factor 25 in the case of Pb. Zinc and 

Pb show a considerably higher percentage of samples which are significantly enriched (43 

and 88 %, respectively) than Cu, Cr and Ni. Most of the samples not enriched in those 

trace metals occur on the Sines shelf, especially on the outer shelf and upper slope, and 

in the upper Setúbal Canyon. While sediments enriched in Pb extend over most of the 

study area, the area with significant enrichment in Zn appears to be more restricted to 

the Lisbon shelf and a relatively narrow area close to the coast on the Setúbal and Sines 

shelves. The highest EFs of Pb (7 - 25) occur in the Sado and Tagus pro-delta deposits 

while the highest EF of Zn (3 - 12) occur in the Sado pro-delta deposit, along the coastal 

arc between Tróia and Sines and in the Tagus mud patch (Figure 5.6a, b). 

Enrichment of Cu, Cr and Ni appears especially associated with sandy deposits of the 

inner shelves (Table 5.5). From the five trace metals considered Ni and Cr are the ones 

with the lowest percentage of samples enriched (25 and 28 %, respectively). Yet, these 

elements show the highest EFs (22 and 26, respectively) in the inner shelf sandy deposits 

of the Sines shelf. Most likely, however, the baseline used is not appropriately 

representing the fine fraction of these sandy deposits. Thirty percent of the surface 

samples are enriched in Cu, most of which are from sandy inner shelf deposits and only 

few from mud patches on the Lisbon and Setúbal shelves. Among various other areas on 

the inner shelf, high EFs of Cu occur close to the Sado River mouth in the Sado pro-delta 

deposit (Figure 5.6c). 

Enrichment factors of Pb and Zn (and Cu to some extent) decrease with increasing 

water depth, whereas a relationship with water depth is not observed for Cr and Ni 

(Figure 5.6).

5.5. Discussion 

On the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf the elemental geochemistry of the fine-grained 

sediment fraction appears to a large extent determined by the amount of fine fraction. 

The Lisbon shelf is largely covered by fine-grained deposits of the Tagus mud patch, while 

towards the south, on the Setúbal and Sines shelves, deposits rich in fine-grained material 

are less widespread (Figure 2.3, page 22). In accordance, elements typically associated 

with fine-grained sediments (Al, Fe, Ti and U) show a southward decrease in mean 

concentrations (Table 5.1). As a result of the low input of fine-grained lithogenic 

sediments in the southern area, relatively coarse sediments with high contents of shells 

dominate the area. This is in turn expressed in the fine fraction by generally high 

concentrations of Ca. 

Although trace metals are in general mostly associated with lithogenic input, trace 

metal distribution on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf show spatial patterns that differ from 

the distribution of elemental proxies of lithogenic and biogenic material. The differing 

patterns of trace metals and proxies of lithogenic material such as Al indicate that there 

must be other trace metal carriers involved and/or a portion of the contents of trace 

metals cannot be explained by the existing concentrations of metal carriers, and may 

represent anthropogenic enrichment. Considering the spatial distribution pattern of the 

studied trace metals and the correlations among them, two groups with different 

behaviour can be distinguished: i) Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn and ii) Ni, Cr. 

 

5.5.1. Copper, lead, zinc, arsenic and manganese 

The most obvious difference between the distribution patterns of Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mn 

and that of Ni and Cr is that elements from the first group show higher concentrations in 

sediments close to the inlets of estuaries and coastal lagoons (Figure 5.2). This is most 

conceivably related to co-precipitation of these trace elements with Mn and Fe 

(hydr)oxides. The efficiency of Mn oxides as trace metals scavengers in the lower 

estuaries is well documented (e.g. Zwolsman and van Eck, 1999 and reference therein). 

However, the trace metals which are affected by this scavenging process may be different 

from estuary to estuary depending on the prevailing chemical, physical, biological and 

hydrological characteristics of the estuary (Byrd et al., 1990). Cortesão (2002) studied the 

reactivity of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni and Co in the lower Sado Estuary and concluded that Mn co-

 135

precipitation is the main process affecting particulate Co. This author considers however 

that this process may well be critical in the coastal area as well. Unfortunately, Pb, Zn and 

As were not considered in the referred study. 

Within the group made by Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Mn different affinities between 

elements are observed. Zinc and Cu appear more closely related to lithogenic material, as 

represented by Al, Fe and phyllosilicates, than Pb, As and Mn (Tables 5.2 and 5.3). 

Apparently Zn and Cu are less controlled by precipitation of Mn oxides than the former 

trace metals and may be more affected by terrigenous materials and/or organic matter 

forming aggregates with clay minerals. Zinc and Cu accumulation in sediments may to 

some extent also be biologically controlled in relation to primary production. The 

relationship of Cu with primary production is further discussed in Chapter 7, dealing with 

trace metal distribution in sediments of deeper areas of the continental margin. However, 

on the shelf this process seems of less importance as shown by the close relationship of 

Cu and Zn with Al, Fe and phyllosilicates. 

Enhanced concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, As together with Mn are also observed on 

the inner shelf adjacent to the Melides and St. André lagoons. These coastal lagoons are 

naturally closed off from the sea by a sand bar but every spring (March/April) both 

lagoons are artificially opened to promote water exchange with the open sea, with the 

objective of preventing eutrophication. According to Freitas et al. (1999) the artificial 

opening of some SW Portuguese coastal lagoons (Melides, St. André and Albufeira) is a 

common practice since the 18th century. The subsequent closing of the inlet by natural 

processes may take days (Melides), weeks (St. André) or even months (Albufeira) (Freitas 

et al., 2000). Natural overwash of the sand bar used to occur in the past during storms 

and high water levels within the lagoon, but has become less frequent due to increased 

regulation of the maximum levels of inundation of the lagoons. 

While closed off from the open sea, the stagnant waters of the lagoons become 

distinctly stratified, as expressed in vertical gradients in temperature, salinity, turbidity, 

pH and dissolved oxygen. Depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water, observed 

during prolonged periods of stagnation (e.g. Freitas et al., 2000; Cearreta et al., 2002) 

leads to lowering of the redox potential, and as a consequence reduced Fe and Mn are 

released from the bottom sediments to the overlying water. When the lagoon is again 

opened to the sea, precipitation of Mn oxides will occur as water flowing from the lagoon 

mixes with well-oxygenated sea water. In addition, the opening of the bar causes 

localised erosion and remobilization of superficial sediments and organic matter from the 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 136 

bottom of the lagoon, and export to open sea (Freitas et al., 2000). Jesus et al. (2005) 

found high contents of Mn and various trace metals in beach sediments from the area 

adjacent to these lagoons, distinctly higher than in other areas of the coastal arc between 

Tróia and Sines. The high contents of trace metals and Mn in beach and adjacent shelf 

sediments may additionally result from precipitation of Mn oxides as lagoonal water 

percolates through the permeable sand of the bar and emerges on the beach, driven by 

water level differences between lagoon and sea. However, the high contents of 

plagioclase found in the fine fraction of beach and shelf sediments from this area, 

supposedly sourced by the Santo André and Melides lagoons, suggest that indeed the 

opening of these lagoons to the sea has an impact on the composition of beach and shelf 

sediments from the surrounding area. 

Apart from the above-mentioned mechanism enhancing the export of trace metals to 

the shelf and beach system, the St. André Lagoon is by itself rich in Mn, Zn and Pb 

(Freitas et al., 2000; Piedade et al., 2004; Jesus et al., 2007). The relatively small 

drainage basin discharging into the lagoon comprises schists and volcano-sedimentary 

rocks which are relatively rich in the above-mentioned elements (Figure 2.18, pg.47). 

Manganese and Fe were even extracted in the past from the now abandoned Saramaga 

mine (Santos Oliveira et al., 2002). Similar lithologies rich in trace metals are not found in 

the drainage basins discharging to the Melides and Albufeira Lagoons, and as a 

consequence these lagoons are probably less important as trace metal sources to the 

shelf than the St. André Lagoon. 

 

5.5.2. Nickel and chromium 

The correlation between Ni and Cr seems to be very strong, whereas the two 

elements show only a very weak correlation with any of the other studied elements 

(Figure 5.3). Cortesão (2002) reported this same relationship between Cr and Ni for the 

suspended particulate matter from the Sado Estuary (both upper and lower estuary) and 

the adjacent coastal area water. This same strong positive relationship between both 

elements was also found, for instance, in suspended particulate matter of the Scheldt and 

Rhine estuaries (Zwolsman &amp;amp; van Eck, 1999 and van de Meet et al., 1985, respectively) 

and in surface sediments of the Sena and Mondego estuaries (Boust, 1981 and Vale et al., 

1994). All these examples point to a common process of incorporation of these two 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 137

elements in the particulate phase, yet the mechanism involved is not revealed by the data 

here presented. Since the highest values are found in sandy deposits of the inner shelf 

rich in biogenic carbonate it may be that Cr and Ni are enriched by a biological process or 

simply by weathering of some heavy mineral concentrated in the coarser fractions.  

 

5.5.3. Enrichment of trace metals 

The percentage of samples showing significant trace metal enrichment (EF &gt; 1.5) per 

element follows the sequence: Pb (88 %) &gt; Zn (43 %) &gt; Cu (30 %) &gt; Cr (28 %) &gt; Ni 

(25 %). Generally, the enrichment of trace metals tends to decrease with increasing 

water depth, suggesting that the excess of trace metals must be derived from land 

(Figure 5.6 and Table 5.5).  

The areas of the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf most affected by enrichment of trace 

metals include the entire Lisbon shelf, the Sado mud patch and the inner shelf between 

Tróia and Sines. 

Enrichment of Pb and Zn on the Lisbon shelf and the Sado mud patch, and of Cu in 

the latter area points to the nearby Tagus and Sado estuaries as the likely sources of 

enrichment. Indeed, high trace metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota due to 

anthropogenic activities have been reported for both estuaries (e.g. Cotté-Krief et al., 

2000; Caeiro et al., 2005; França et al., 2005). 

On the inner shelf between Tróia and Sines, decreasing levels of enrichment of Pb, 

Zn and Cu in southward direction, along with the prevailing longshore drift of sediments 

towards south (except in the northern most portion) (SNIRLit, 2010 and references 

therein) suggests once more that the Sado Estuary is the most likely source for these 

trace metals. Since enrichment of Cr and Ni on the inner shelf decreases in opposite, 

northward direction, and since these elements are not enriched in the Sado mud patch 

nourished by the Sado Estuary, it seems that these elements are not sourced by the Sado 

Estuary, but rather seem to come from the south. Two different sources of particles may 

explain this enrichment:  

1) The enrichment of Cr and Ni may be due to relatively abundant presence of heavy 

minerals in these sediments nourished by the Sines sub-volcanic complex. In a study of  

the heavy mineral fraction in beach deposits between Tróia and Sines, Miranda et al. 

(2007) also found the signature of sub-volcanic rocks, in the form of an increase in 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 138 

amphiboles and pyroxenes in the southernmost 10 km of the coastal arc. Pombo et al. 

(2004) found this same assemblage in the inner shelf of this same area. If there is indeed 

a natural source of enhanced Cr and Ni contents in sediments of this area, the calculated 

enrichment factor (EFs ~20 in some areas) is very likely too high because the baseline 

value used for the calculation refers to pre-industrial sediments from deeper areas  (see 

Figure 3.2, pg. 52) where heavy minerals are rare. 

2) Another source of Cr and Ni might be the Sines submarine outfall located ~2 km 

northwards from Sines which started to operate in 1978 (Cardoso &amp;amp; Palma, 2007). It 

mainly discharges industrial wastewater from an important industrial complex in the 

vicinity of Sines. The structure reaches to 3.2 km offshore and releases wastewater at 

40 m WD (Maretec, 2008). At the time when the sediment samples were collected 

another outfall in the city of Sines was still operational and discharging in front of Cape 

Sines. Nowadays it is deactivated. Two monitoring studies done in sediments from the 

surroundings of the first outfall (Cardoso &amp;amp; Palma, 2007; Maretec, 2008) showed that 

there is no important enrichment of trace metals in the bulk sediments, which in this case 

are coarse sands. These studies are of limited use, however, to evaluate the possible 

impact of these releases on sediment samples shown in the present study because: i) The 

above-mentioned studies refer to the bulk sediment &amp;lt;2 mm, while the present study is 

considering the fine fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm); ii) Presently, the wastewater discharged by the 

Sines submarine outfall undergoes secondary treatment but possibly the treatment was 

less extensive at the time when the sediment samples here presented were collected 

(1980-1987). This input of trace metals to the inner shelf would have affected the area 

northwards from the submarine outfall especially during storms when the longshore drift 

is reversed to a northward direction. 

From the two hypotheses, the first seems the more likely in view of the observed 

enrichment of heavy minerals in beach and shelf sediments from the southern half of the 

coastal arc, and also in view of the lack of correlations between Cr and Ni and other 

elements (Figure 5.3). 

Since the enrichment of Pb is found to extend over a much wider area of the shelf 

and upper open slope than that of other trace elements, it can be deduced that other 

sources of excess Pb must exist apart from the rivers discharging terrigenous sediments 

to the shelf. Another source of contamination potentially involving the whole studied shelf 

area concerns atmospheric input. This subject will be further discussed in section 7.4.1 of 



5. Trace metals in surface sediments of the shelf and upper slope 

 139

Chapter 7 where stable lead isotope signatures are used to identify potential sources of 

lead in the canyons. 

As mentioned before, the sediment samples from the shelf here presented were 

collected between 1980 and 1987, which implies that they may not represent the present 

state of contamination of the shelf. Present-day shelf sediments could be expected to be 

less contaminated with trace metals, after improvement of industrial and domestic 

effluent treatment and closing of some industrial point sources in both the Tagus and 

Sado estuaries during the past two decades. During this time leaded gasoline was also 

gradually phased out, starting in the early 1990s and completely eliminated only in 1999 

(Roma-Torres et al., 2007). However, Mil-Homens et al. (2009), in a study of trace metal 

accumulation in sediments from the Tagus mud patch during the last 80 years (1920 - 

2000), concluded that sediments dated between 1980 and 2000 show constant 

enrichment values of trace metals, presumably due to the homogenising effect of 

bioturbation in the surface mixed layer. EFs between 1980 and 2000 obtained by these 

authors are indeed very similar to those obtained in the present study for the same area 

(Table 5.6). 

 

 

In addition, the enrichment factors found in grab samples from the outer shelf/upper 

slope (Chapter 5) are comparable to those found in the same area in the top 0.5 cm of 

Table 5.6. Comparison of enrichment factors of Pb, Zn and Cu in sediments of the Tagus mud 

patch, as obtained in the present study for grab samples collected between 1980 and 1988, and 

those obtained by Mil-Homens et al. (2009) in samples collected between 1980 and 2000.

discussed in section 7.2.6 of Chapter 7. 

The good agreement between the two independent studies, as shown in Table 5.6, 

gives reason for confidence that results presented in this Chapter are a good 

representation of the enrichment of trace metals in surface sediments over the last 20 

years.

6.1. Introduction 

Despite of being a major topographic feature of the Portuguese margin, the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon system so far was not studied in detail with regard to modern sediment 

transport and deposition. This is in contrast with the relatively geographically close Nazaré 

Canyon. Recently, studies by Arzola et al. (2008) and Lastras et al. (2009) focused on the 

general morphology and large-scale sedimentary structures of the above canyons, on the 

basis of analysis of seafloor geophysical data. Inferences about late glacial to Holocene 

sedimentation in the middle and lower reaches of the canyons were made, based on the 

analysis of piston-cores. Even more recently García et al. (2010) published a study on 

bioavailable organic matter in suspended aggregates and surface sediments, sediment 

deposition rates and mixing intensities in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. 

This chapter is intended to give more insight into the recent sedimentary processes 

acting in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon system by looking at:  

1) up- and down-canyon horizontal sediment fluxes obtained by near-bottom 

measurements of turbidity and current velocities;  

2) sediment deposition fluxes measured with sediment traps;  

3) sediment accumulation rates measured in cores using 210Pb geochronology;  

4) general composition and grain size of surface sediments and suspended 

particulate matter; 

5) bulk and clay mineralogy of surface sediments and suspended particulate matter. 
  
Data on surface sediments from the Cascais Canyon are presented for comparison 

with the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon system in terms of sediment accumulation rates, general 

composition and mineralogical contents of surface sediments. Comparisons with the 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 144 

Nazaré Canyon will be frequent since a similar approach making use of data collected with 

sediment traps and surface sediment cores was previously applied to this canyon by De 

Stigter et al. (2007b), covering the entire canyon structure. 

 

6.2. Near-bottom hydrodynamics, horizontal sediment flux and mass 

deposition flux 

BOBO (BOttom BOundary) benthic landers were deployed in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon to record current dynamics in the near-bottom water layer, in combination with 

temporal variation of temperature, salinity, turbidity and mass deposition flux. Seven 

deployments were done at different depths along the canyon axis: three were done in the 

Lisbon Canyon (497, 1070 and 1858 m WD), two in the upper Setúbal Canyon (972 and 

1324 m WD), one in the middle canyon (2716 m WD) and one in the lower Setúbal 

Canyon (4402 m WD). One deployment was done on the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau 

(1213 m WD). 

BOBO lander records of near-bed current dynamics show moderately strong currents 

in the entire Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, directed predominantly along the canyon axis and 

typically alternating in up- and down-canyon direction with a semi-diurnal frequency. 

Mean current speeds varied between 6.2 and 12.1 cm s-1 and were generally higher in the 

upper canyon reaches (Table 6.1). 

In the Lisbon Canyon, deployments at 497 and 1070 m WD (stations 269-02 and 

252-34, respectively) were of short duration (7 and 12 days, respectively) and done 

during summer time (May 2007 and September 2006, respectively). For both 

deployments, sharp peaks in turbidity, indicating resuspension of sediment from the 

seabed, occurred when current speed exceeded 20 cm s-1 (Figure 6.1a, b). Whereas 

higher average current speeds and mass deposition fluxes were measured in the 

deployment at 497 m (269-02) (Table 6.1), both deployments displayed a net up-canyon 

SPM transport of around 4000 g m-2 d-1. Figure 6.2 shows the location of the three BOBO 

deployments in the Lisbon Canyon. 

A different sedimentary setting was found in the lower part of the Lisbon Canyon 

during a deployment of 12 months at 1858 m water depth (station 225-03). Peaks of 

current speed above 25 cm s-1 were common and only at these current peaks a clear 

relationship of turbidity and current speed was observed (Figure 6.1c). Although current 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 145

speeds recorded during this deployment were similar to those measured in the upper 

canyon, much lower horizontal and mass deposition fluxes were measured (Table 6.1; 

Figure 6.4). As illustrated in Figure 6.2, there is a clear decrease of horizontal fluxes with 

increasing depth along the canyon axis. 

 

 

Figure 6.3 shows the recorded horizontal fluxes towards different directions for the 

four deployments done in the Setúbal Canyon and the one at the Afonso de Albuquerque

Plateau. In Appendix A5, current direction, current speed and turbidity are shown for each 

deployment. 

As in the Lisbon Canyon, a general down-canyon decrease of horizontal fluxes 

(Figure 6.3a, b, c, d) and mass deposition fluxes (Table 6.1, Figure 6.4) was also 

observed along the axis of the Setúbal Canyon. Considering the entire Setúbal Canyon, a 

net down-canyon horizontal flux was only recorded at 1324 m WD, representing a net flux 

of about 2000 g m-2 d-1 (Table 6.1). The other three deployments displayed negligible 

horizontal net fluxes (&amp;lt;100 g m-2 d-1). Despite this apparent lack of sediment transport, 

especially in the middle and lower canyon, the deepest deployment at 4402 m WD 

recorded relatively high current speeds reaching peaks of 50 cm s-1 (Figure 6.1g). These

peaks in current speed were accompanied by relatively low and stable values of turbidity 

showing no signs of resuspension. Possibly there was little material to resuspend at this 

site, in contrast with the upper canyon where fine mud is always abundantly present. 

Accordingly, sediment deposition rates measured in the sediment trap at 4402 m WD 

were between 0.4 – 1.4 g m-2 d-1, the lowest values measured in the entire canyon and 

comparable to those measured on the adjacent open slope (see below). The strong 

along-canyon alignment of currents and their high speed noticed in this record (Appendix 

5, Figure A5.2) are in agreement with the observation that the canyon thalweg at this 

depth lies confined between steep canyon walls of hundreds of meters high (cf. section 3 

of Figure 2.6c, on pg. 25 of Chapter 2). Arzola et al. (2008) and Lastras et al. (2009) 

reported localised grooving at the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon mouth (4170 m WD) and 

related those with enhancement of turbidity currents as a result of narrowing of the 

canyon by a debris avalanche. 

 

Figure 6.3. Distribution of horizontal sediment fluxes in different directions measured at different 
deployments along the Setúbal Canyon axis (a-d) and on the adjacent open slope of the Afonso de 
Albuquerque Plateau (e). Note the different scales used for plots. 

 

During the 8-day deployment at 1213 m WD on the open slope of the Afonso de 

Albuquerque Plateau (cf. Figure 6.3e) current speed showed a very regular semi-diurnal 

variation with peaks of current speed above 15 cm s-1 occurring almost every cycle.

occurred when current speeds exceeded ~20 cm s-1 (Figure 6.1h). Figure 6.3e indicates 

NW - WNW directed net sediment fluxes in the area, generally along with the poleward 

flow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) along the slope. During this short period 

of deployment mass sediment deposition fluxes between 0.3 and 1.2 g m-2 d-1 were 

recorded. 

 

6.3. Sediment accumulation rates (vs. mass deposition fluxes) 

Sediment accumulation rates (SAR) measured in cores using 210Pb geochronology 

vary from 0.8 to 20.8 g m-2 d-1 in the canyons while on the open slope values range from 

0.5 to 2.7 g m-2 d-1 (Figure 6.4). The relatively lower sediment accumulation rates 

measured on the open slope (and in the lower canyon) are most probably overestimates. 

Since a surface mixed layer could not be distinguished from an unmixed subsurface layer, 

sediment accumulation rates were calculated under the (probably incorrect) assumption 

that bioturbation is negligible. Even so, the above ranges of values indicate preferential 

deposition of sediments in the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons rather than on the 

adjacent open slope. 

Of the six cores in the Lisbon Canyon for which SARs were determined, the highest 

value of 20.8 g m-2 d-1 was measured at ~1100 m water depth while SARs of 15.2 and 

3.9 g m-2 d-1 were measured in other cores collected at 367 and 1856 m WD, respectively. 

In the upper Setúbal Canyon a similar pattern was observed with the highest sediment 

accumulation rate around 1300 m WD; however, comparing both upper canyons, values 

are consistently higher in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.4). Down-stream after the merging 

of the two canyon branches, SARs tend to decrease with depth reaching a value of 

0.8 g m-2 d-1 around 4400 m WD. In the Cascais Canyon there is a regular offshore 

decrease of sediment accumulation rates from 11.0 g m-2 d-1 at 445 m WD down to 1.4 g 

m-2 d-1 at 3900 m WD. 

SARs on the Sines open slope are comparable to those in the slope adjacent to the 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, ranging between 0.5 and 3.1 g m-2 d-1. On the Estremadura and 

Mondego open slopes, located northwards of the above canyon, SARs are generally lower 

than at comparable depths on the Sines open slope. 

By dividing the dry bulk density of the 0-0.5 cm slice of sediment cores by the SAR 

values obtained for the cores, average linear sedimentation rates of 0.39, 0.19, 0.13 and 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 150 

0.06 cm yr.-1 were determined for the upper (Lisbon and Setúbal), middle and lower 

canyon reaches, respectively, and 0.09 cm yr.-1 for the adjacent open slope. Thus, 0.5 cm 

of sediment (the slicing interval for the surface sediment here considered) is equivalent to 

~1.5 - 4 years of accumulation in the upper and middle Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, and to ~6 

- 8 years in the lower canyon and slope regions. 

For both the Lisbon and Setúbal Canyon, sediment deposition fluxes measured in 

traps deployed upstream of 1500 m WD are higher than SARs determined for cores 

collected at corresponding water depths (Figure 6.4). This is most likely due to cumulative 

trapping of resuspended sediment clouds produced during consecutive tidal cycles. On the 

other hand, in the lower-canyon (and conceivably in the middle-canyon) where 

resuspension events are less common, sediment fluxes measured in traps span a range of 

values comparable to sediment accumulation rates obtained in nearby sediment cores. 

 

 

Episodic high sediment fluxes were not observed in the sediment trap time series for 

any of the seven deployments within the canyon, suggesting that sediment gravity flows 

like the ones described for the Nazaré Canyon by De Stigter et al. (2007b) are not 

frequent in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. Over a time span that is comparable to that 

represented by the sediment traps of the present study, these authors observed a 

number of events occurring at various depths along the Nazaré Canyon axis, with 

sediment fluxes 5 to 50 times higher than the average flux for a given deployment.

6.4. General characteristics of surface sediments and suspended 

particulate matter (grain size, general composition and Corg/N ratios) 

6.4.1.  Surface sediments  

Surface sediment cores brought up from the axis of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

consisted of soft muddy sediment with very little coarse material. Reduced dark grey to 

black sediment below a thin oxidized surface layer indicated a high content of organic 

matter. Piston-cores collected from the Lisbon and upper Cascais canyons (252-34 and 

252-36, respectively) consisted also of dark olive grey silty clay, with intercalations of 

medium sand (De Stigter et al., 2004 and 2007a). In a core collected from the lower 

Setúbal Canyon (225-07), a turbiditic sand layer at 15-20 cm depth indicates sporadic 

mass transport of sand-sized material. Multi-cores collected in the slope adjacent to the 

canyon (236-10, 225-20, 225-21) and at the open slope transects consisted of yellowish 

grey carbonate-rich silty clay with a well-developed oxidised layer (De Stigter et al., 2004 

and 2007a). Pteropod shells and living arborescent foraminifera were commonly found on 

the surface (Figure 3.6). 

Surface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal as well as the 

Cascais Canyon have modal grain sizes generally between 8 and 50 µm, and occasionally 

coarser than 50 µm, whereas finer modes less than 8 µm are found in the middle and 

lower reaches of these canyons (Figure 6.5). On the adjacent shelf and upper slope, 

coarser sediments are generally found with modes coarser than 65 µm, and locally at 

depths between 500 and 1500 m even coarser than 150 µm. At greater depths, open 

slope sediments have finer grain size modes below 8 µm. Surface sediments in the Nazaré 

Canyon tend to be slightly coarser than sediments at comparable depth in the other 

canyons, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the Nazaré Canyon where modes 

approach 50 µm. Only in the deepest cores from the canyon, fine grain size modes were 

observed, comparable to those in the lower reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais 

canyons and the lower slope. 

Variation in surface sediment bulk composition is presented in Figure 6.6 for different 

bathymetrical transects (Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons and adjacent slope, Nazaré 

Canyon, Sines, Estremadura and Mondego open slopes). Canyon surface sediments are 

composed of 72 – 87 % non-carbonate lithogenic material, 10 – 25 % carbonate, and 1.4 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 152 

– 5.0 % organic matter while surface samples from the adjacent slope are composed of 

69 – 78 % non-carbonate lithogenic material, 20 – 27 % carbonate and 1.4 – 2.8 % 

organic matter. In both the Lisbon and Cascais canyons the highest contents of lithogenic 

material are found in the canyon head, decreasing down-canyon until around 2000 m 

water depth where contents reach values of 73 and 75 % respectively (Figure 6.6a, c). In 

the upper Setúbal Canyon, contents of non-carbonate lithogenic material are lower and 

also tend to decrease with increasing water depth, reaching values of 73 % already at 

595 m water depth (Figure 6.6b). Below 2000 m water depth, contents of non-carbonate 

lithogenic material show a slight increase with depth in both the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Cascais canyons. Contents of organic matter are higher in the canyon sediments than in 

sediments of the adjacent slope (Figure 6.6d). Along the canyon axis higher 

concentrations of organic matter appear in sediments collected around 500-1300 m WD in 

the Lisbon Canyon and upper Setúbal Canyon, corresponding to the areas with the 

highest sediment accumulation rates, and around 900-1000 m WD in the Cascais Canyon. 

Surface sediments from the Nazaré Canyon have contents of non-carbonate lithogenic 

materials consistently above 80 %. Biogenic silica, which in the present study is included 

in the non-carbonate fraction, presumably contributes very little to the bulk of surface 

sediment and sediment trap samples according to the XRD analysis. However, since most 

of the biogenic silica is amorphous and present in relatively low amounts, XRD analysis is 

not a good method to identify the presence of this mineral.

transects there is a conspicuous maximum in carbonate contents around 1500 m WD and 

also around 500 m WD in the Sines transect, which corresponds to relatively coarse 

winnowed sediments rich in foraminifera. 

 

6.4.2.  Suspended particulate matter (vs. surface sediments) 

Particulate matter collected in sediment traps consisted of silt- to clay-sized material 

with very little coarser material. As an example, grain size analyses of twelve trap samples 

from deployment 218-36 (upper Setúbal Canyon, 1324 m) show volume percentages of 

clay-sized particles between 12 and 17 %, silt between 79 and 84 % and sand between 4 

and 6 %. Figure 6.7 compares grain size spectra of sediment trap samples from 

deployment 218-36 with the grain size spectrum of the underlying surface sediment. The 

latter shows a relatively broad grain size mode around 10 µm, apparently integrating 

fluctuations in grain size of settling material with modes of 5 to 20 µm observed in the 

sediment trap samples.

The bulk composition of suspended particulate matter collected in sediment traps is

deployment, except for deployment 218-36 as discussed below. Clear differences, 

however, were observed between samples collected from different sites within the 

canyon. Suspended particulate matter collected in the sediment trap at 497 m in the 

Lisbon Canyon had the highest contents of lithogenic material and organic matter of all

deployments, and the lowest contents in carbonate. In this canyon, lithogenic contents 

were found to decrease down-canyon whereas carbonate content showed a relative 

increase, probably reflecting a reduction of terrigenous material input. Organic matter 

reached the highest values in the trap deployed at 1070 m WD. In general, the upper 

Setúbal Canyon showed the lowest contents of lithogenic material, and highest contents 

of carbonate, varying from 25 – 27 % at 972 m WD to 24 – 37 % at 1324 m WD. Highest 

contents of organic matter in the Setúbal Canyon were observed in the shallowest 

deployment (5.2 - 5.9 %). In the middle and lower Setúbal Canyon particulate matter 

collected in sediment traps had lithogenic and carbonate contents representing 

intermediate values relative to those of the two upper canyon branches. Organic matter 

increased further down-canyon from 3.6 – 4.9 % at 2716 m WD up to 4.9 – 5.7 % at 

4402 m WD (Figure 6.8g and h).

Figure 6.8. Variation in lithogenic, carbonate and organic matter contents of suspended particulate matter 
collected in sediment traps deployed at various depths along the axis of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and on 
the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau. The concentration of lithogenic material and organic matter is indicated 
within each bar. Numbering of cups and colour codes used in panel f correspond to those used in Figure 6.7.  

 

In Figure 6.9 Corg/N ratio of organic material in sediment trap samples is plotted 

against carbonate content. The two parameters show a distinct negative relationship: 

samples with lowest carbonate content, and hence highest lithogenic content, contain 

organic material with Corg/N ratio around 10 indicative of organic material of mixed marine 

and terrigenous origin. Conversely, samples richest in carbonate, and hence lowest in 

lithogenic material, contain organic matter with low Corg/N ratio around 7, indicative of a 

prevalence of marine organic material. Whereas for most sediment trap deployments the 

samples tend to cluster closely together, the samples from deployment 218-36 show a 

conspicuously wide range of carbonate concentrations and Corg/N ratios, indicating a 

variable supply of terrigenous and marine material. For the entire set of sediment trap 

samples, carbonate content tends to be negatively correlated with mass deposition flux, 

suggesting that carbonate content is predominantly determined by dilution with 

terrigenous sediment rich in lithogenic material. This is not the case, however, for the 

samples of 218-36, where carbonate contents show no relationship with mass flux. This 

fact will be further discussed in section 6.7.1. 

Whereas most sediment trap samples plotted in Figure 6.9 fall within a fairly narrow 

band of Corg/N vs. carbonate values, samples from traps in the lower Setúbal Canyon 

(252-62), the Afonso de Albuquerque Plateau (218-01) and the lower Nazaré Canyon 

(218-55) deviate from this general pattern by having organic matter with higher Corg/N 

ratio for similar carbonate content. 

To illustrate trends in the relative proportion of lithogenic material (assumed to be 

mostly terrigenous) versus carbonate (assumed to be mostly of marine origin) the ratio of 

lithogenic material versus carbonate (L/C ratio) in sediment trap samples and surface 

sediments is plotted in Figure 6.10 against water depth. The high L/C ratio in the head of

the Lisbon and Cascais canyons, and its decrease down-canyon shows this ratio is a good 

indicator for terrigenous sediment input. In accordance, L/C ratios in the open slope 

samples are consistently lower than ratios obtained in the canyon surface samples for a 

given water depth.

Figure 6.9. Corg/N ratio of organic matter in sediment trap samples plotted against carbonate content, for 
sediment traps deployed along the axis of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and also the lower Nazaré Canyon and

branch (USC); green: lower Setúbal Canyon (LSC); grey: lower Nazaré Canyon (NC); orange: Afonso de

Samples collected in the two shallowest traps of the Lisbon Canyon (269-02 and 252-

34, respectively 497 and 1070 m WD) show lower L/C ratios than surface sediment 

samples at the same water depth in the canyon. Surface sediment samples with L/C ratios 

comparable to those of the trap samples are to be found at greater depth down-canyon, 

according to the trendline indicated in Figure 6.10. Assuming that most of the material 

trapped in the near-bottom water has undergone multiple cycles of resuspension from the 

seabed, the similarity of trap samples with down-canyon surface sediments samples 

would suggest temporary up-canyon SPM transport, as supported by observed up-canyon 

water transport illustrated in Figure 6.2. For the deepest sediment trap site in the Lisbon 

Canyon (225-03, 1858 m WD) eleven out of twelve samples have L/C ratios very similar 

to those found in surface sediments collected at comparable water depths. In the upper 

Setúbal Canyon, L/C ratios in sediment trap samples are lower than in surface sediment 

samples from nearby locations. Ratios in trap samples are comparable, however, to the 

ones obtained for surface sediments of the adjacent open slope, pointing out this area as 

a likely source of SPM as mentioned above (when referring to Figure 6.9). Further down-

entire year have ratios spanning a relatively narrow range of values and which are 

comparable to ratios for surface sediments at comparable water depths. Further seawards 

at 4402 m WD (252-62), the one-year series of trap samples shows consistently lower 

ratios (comparable to those of shelf/open slope surface sediments) than those of canyon 

surface sediments collected nearby.

6.5. Bulk mineralogy of surface sediments and mineralogy of &amp;lt;150 µm 

suspended particulate matter 

Lithogenic detrital components of marine sediments, despite all regional variability, 

include only few basic minerals. With the exception of quartz, complete weathering, 

particularly the chemical weathering of metamorphic and igneous rock, leads to the 

formation of phyllosilicates. Consequently, this group represents, apart from quartz and 

biogenic sediments, the most important mineral constituent in sediments. To a lesser 

degree, lithogenic detritus contains unweathered minerals like feldspars. In general, the 

relevant biogenic minerals for sediment formation are only carbonate minerals in the form 

of aragonite, Mg-calcite and calcite, as well as biogenic opal in the form of amorphous 

SiO2·nH2O. 

 

6.5.1.  Bulk mineralogy of surface sediments from canyons and open 

slopes 

Five main minerals/groups of minerals compose the bulk mineralogy of surface 

sediments of the canyons and open slopes: calcite, quartz, phyllosilicates, plagioclase and 

K-feldspars. The bulk mineralogy of the surface sediments from the Lisbon-Setúbal, 

Cascais and Nazaré canyons and open slope is very similar to the assemblage found in 

surface sediments from the shelves adjacent to these areas (Chapter 4), except aragonite 

and Mg-calcite were not identified in surface sediments from the canyons and open slope. 

In the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons there is an obvious relationship between 

bulk mineralogy and water depth. Generally calcite (Cc) and phyllosilicates (Phy) increase 

with water depth whereas quartz (Qz), K-feldspars (Fk) and plagioclase (Plg) follow the 

opposite trend (Figure 6.11). Throughout the Nazaré Canyon the bulk mineralogy of 

surface sediments does not have a clear trend with water depth. It is clear, however, that 

surface sediments in this canyon have an important component of lithogenic material (Cc 

&amp;lt;28 % and Qz &gt; 30 %) except around 5000 m WD where calcite is higher than 30 %, 

and feldspars and quartz are below 4 % and 20 %, respectively (Figure 6.11). With 

regard to the open slope environment each transect has its own pattern with increasing 

water depth. In addition to that, each transect comprises a different range of water 

depths which turns comparison more difficult, especially for the shallower water depths. 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 160 

Nonetheless, one may observe a general trend in the open slope transects characterised 

by an increase in contents of phyllosilicates with water depth while quartz and feldspars 

tend to decrease. These trends are less obvious in the Estremadura transect which covers 

a smaller water depth range than on the other transects. Calcite content clearly increases 

with water depth on the Mondego open slope while on the Sines and Estremadura open 

slopes contents do vary across the open slope yet with no clear relationship with water 

depth.

6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 161

Some differences between different areas of the central Portuguese margin in 

general and between canyon and open slope environments in particular are apparent in 

the mineralogy of surface sediments.  

Trends in contents of various minerals with water depth are very similar between the 

Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons, especially between the Lisbon and Cascais canyons, 

but they are generally different from those observed in the Nazaré Canyon. Whereas in 

the Lisbon and Cascais canyons calcite contents increase from ~15 % around 500 m WD 

to ~40 % at 2000 m WD, calcite contents remain more or less constant ~15 % in the 

Nazaré Canyon even at water depths around 4500 m WD. Only toward the deepest part 

of the canyon contents of calcite appear to increase (Figure 6.11a). In the Setúbal Canyon 

contents of calcite also remain virtually constant until 4500 m WD yet with higher 

contents of 34 – 37 %. Contents of quartz and feldspars tend to be higher in the Nazaré 

Canyon than at equivalent water depths in the southern canyons (Table 6.2 and Figure 

6.11). This is especially clear for quartz which shows a difference in contents all the way 

through the canyons, whereas for feldspars similar contents are observed in the upper 

reaches of the canyons. Contents of phyllosilicates are again similar in the upper reaches 

of the canyons but further down-canyon contents are higher in the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Cascais canyons compared to the Nazaré Canyon. 

Comparing the three open slope areas, the Sines open slope transect has the lowest 

contents of calcite and highest in phyllosilicates for equivalent water depths. These 

contents are in good agreement with those of samples collected from the edges of the 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (Figure 6.11a, c). The Mondego open slope is marked by 

conspicuously higher contents of quartz and feldspars compared to the other two open 

slope transects. The Estremadura open slope has the highest contents of calcite. 

 

Lithogenic minerals versus calcite 

The ratio of lithogenic minerals Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg against calcite (Cc) highlights the 

areas more affected by fresh input of terrigenous lithogenic input in a similar manner as 

the lithogenic/carbonate ratio described in 6.4.2, since normally carbonate contents only 

increase where input of lithogenic material is relatively low. 

In the Lisbon Canyon a pronounced decrease of the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio with 

water depth is observed from the canyon head region down to about 2000 m WD, and a 

similar pattern is seen in the Cascais Canyon (Figure 6.12a). A markedly lower ratio is 

observed in the upper Setúbal Canyon, which remains more or less constant with 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 162 

increasing depth down-canyon. In the Nazaré Canyon the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio is 

generally higher than in the former canyons, and no clear relationship with water depth is 

seen. All three canyons systems have higher values of the Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio in the 

canyon thalweg compared to adjacent open slope areas. 

The Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratios in sediments of the Estremadura and Sines open 

slopes are comparable or lower than those found on the edges and slopes of the canyons. 

The ratio is slightly higher in the Sines open slope transect compared to the Estremadura 

open slope and also to the Mondego open slope below 1500 m WD. 

 

Phyllosilicates / Quartz + Feldspars ratio 

The Phy/Qz+Feld ratio may give insight into the hydrodynamics of a given area since 

phyllosilicates tend to settle in calmer areas compared to quartz and feldspars. It might 

be used as well to track the mineralogical contributions of a given source of sediments. 

In both the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons there is a general increase of the 

Phy/Qz+Feld ratio with increasing water depth (Figure 6.12b). The lowest ratio of ~0.5 

occurs in the Lisbon Canyon around 350 – 450 m WD, whilst it increases to more than 1.0 

around 1100 m WD. In the Nazaré Canyon the ratio remains below 1.0 all the way to the 

lower canyon but around 5000 m WD the ratio doubles to around 2.0. 

In the open slope environment this ratio tends to increase as well with increasing 

water depth (Figure 6.12b). Both in the Sines and Mondego transects the ratio starts with 

very low values of &amp;lt;0.2 on the inner shelf, rapidly increasing to &gt;1.5 at depths around 

1000 m WD on the Sines open slope, whereas on the Mondego open slope a more 

gradual increase with water depth is observed, to values which are lower than on the 

Sines open slope at equivalent depths. Data for the Estremadura open slope are only 

available for depths below 1000 m WD, but here the ratio appears comparable to that 

observed on the Sines open slope. On the slope adjacent to the Nazaré  

Canyon the ratio is somewhat in between vales observed for the Mondego and 

Estremadura open slopes. 

 

Feldspars / Phyllosilicates ratio 

The ratio of feldspars against phyllosilicates may give insight into the maturity of 

sediments. Feldspars are less resistant to weathering than phyllosilicates and the former 

may be precursors of the latter. Since the two mineral groups have very different 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 163

hydraulic characteristics this ratio should preferably only be used for comparison of areas 

with comparable hydrodynamic regimes.  

Through most of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons the Felds/Phy ratio in 

surface sediments gently decreases against water depth. A conspicuously high ratio is 

observed in sediment in the upper reaches of the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.12c). 

In surface sediments from the Nazaré Canyon the ratio is more scattered with no 

clear relationship with water depth. Values are generally higher than those obtained for 

the southern canyons, which indicates a lower maturity of sediments in the Nazaré 

Canyon. 

Ratios for the shelf and open slope as presented in Figure 6.12c seem to indicate a 

general decrease of Felds/Phy ratios from the Mondego to the Sines transect. Differences 

between the northernmost and southernmost transect are most pronounced on the shelf 

and upper slope, decreasing toward greater depths. Around 3500 m WD both transects 

have similar ratios. The other studied areas generally have intermediate values for this 

ratio. On the Mondego open slope there is again an increase of the ratio around 5000 m 

WD.

6.5.2.  Mineralogy of &amp;lt;150 µm suspended particulate matter (vs. surface 

sediments) 

Generally the mineralogy of particulate material collected in sediment traps along 

the canyon axes shows similar trends against water depth to those defined by the surface 

sediments (Figure 6.11 and 6.12). However, as seen for bulk sediment components in 

section 6.4.2, contents of various components may differ systematically between trap 

samples and surface sediments. 

Calcite contents in samples from individual sediment trap deployments commonly 

span relatively narrow ranges and are comparable to values observed in surface 

sediments at similar water depths, for as much as the upper canyon reaches are 

considered. However, in deeper areas of the canyons (~4500 m WD in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon and already at 3000 m WD in the Nazaré Canyon), sediment trap samples have 

higher contents of calcite compared to underlying surface sediments (Figure 6.11a). The 

Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio shows this same trend along both Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré 

canyons being however more obvious in the Nazaré Canyon. 

For phyllosilicates trap samples have normally higher contents than those found in 

underlying surface sediments. On the other hand, for coarser minerals as quartz and 

feldspars trap samples have lower contents compared to surface sediments at equivalent 

water depths. The Phy/Qz+Feld ratio summarises these differences between surface 

sediment and trap samples which can be tracked throughout the entire canyons, 

becoming nevertheless more evident in the lower reaches of the canyons. In the upper 

canyons resuspension processes caused by high bottom currents speeds occur frequently 

(see section 6.2) allowing coarser minerals to be caught in the sediment traps. In the 

deeper areas, however, differences between the mineralogy of suspended particulate 

material and surface sediments become more obvious since resuspension processes do 

not occur as frequently as in the upper canyon and material caught in the traps therefore 

represents mainly the pelagic sedimentation. 

 

6.5.3.  Comparison between surface sediments from the canyons and 

adjacent outer shelf and upper slope 

Surface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons (~350 

– 500 m WD) have similar bulk mineralogy with only slight differences: contents of 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 165

phyllosilicates are higher in the Cascais Canyon and contents of quartz and plagioclase 

tend to be higher in the Lisbon Canyon (Figure 6.11). The Lisbon outer shelf and upper 

slope compared to these canyons has a mean content of phyllosilicates and quartz similar 

to those found in the Cascais Canyon head (38 and 30 %, respectively). The Lisbon 

Canyon head sediments, on the other hand have higher contents of plagioclase and 

quartz than sediments from these two other environments. In fact the 

Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio is also higher in the Lisbon Canyon head (6) compared to the 

Cascais Canyon (4) and also to the outer shelf/upper slope sediments (4). 

Surface sediments from the upper Setúbal Canyon branch have relatively constant 

concentrations of minerals composing the bulk mineralogy. These sediments are 

characterised by Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratios around 2 and the dominant minerals are 

calcite and phyllosilicates (~35 % each). It follows quartz, plagioclase and k-feldspars 

with ~21, 4-6, 3-4 %, respectively (Figure 6.11). The Setúbal outer shelf/upper slope has 

also a mean Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio of 2 with similar contents of calcite and 

phyllosilicates (33 and 23 %, respectively) to those found in the canyon. The Sines outer 

shelf/upper slope has even lower mean contents of phyllosilicates (18 %), higher mean 

contents of calcite (43 %) and a mean Qz+Phy+Fk+Plg/Cc ratio of 1.

6.6.  Clay mineralogy 

6.6.1.  Clay mineralogy of canyon surface sediments 

As in the surface sediments from the Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelves, four groups 

of minerals were identified in the clay fraction of surface sediments: illite (60 – 93 %), 

kaolinite (20 – 38 %), chlorite (0 – 5 %) and smectite (0 – 4 %).  

 

Illite 

As expected for sediments at mid-latitudes of the northern oceans illite is the 

dominant mineral in the clay fraction. For the Setúbal Canyon and lower Cascais Canyon 

as well as for the open slopes and walls and edges of the canyons contents of illite are 

higher than 70 % (Figure 6.13a). Contents of illite lower than 70 % occur throughout the 

Nazaré Canyon and also in the Lisbon Canyon and upper Cascais Canyon. For the 

different transects, contents of illite show no trend with water depth except in the Lisbon 

and Cascais canyons where there is a clear seaward increase of their contents. 

In the southern canyons the Esquevin Index (EI) shows with consistence the 

following sequence across water depths until ~2000 m: Setúbal Canyon (more Al-rich 

illites) &gt; Cascais Canyon &gt; Lisbon Canyon (less Al-rich illites). For the Nazaré Canyon 

values are relatively constant with increasing water depth.  

In the Mondego and Sines transects there is a decrease of the EI with increasing 

water depth until 4000 m WD; from this depth onwards it seems to increase for both 

transects. 

In the southern canyons the Kubler Index (KI) is quite variable compared to the 

Nazaré Canyon where surface sediments have indices which gradually increase seawards. 

In the open slope transects of Sines and Mondego lower KIs occur in the shallowest and 

deepest samples. Across the Estremadura open slope transect the index is quite stable 

with increasing water depth (Figure 6.13c). 

 

Kaolinite 

Contents of kaolinite are generally higher in the Nazaré Canyon (28 – 38 %) than at 

equivalent depths in the southern canyons (22 – 31 %) and open slope areas (21 – 

32 %). In the Setúbal Canyon contents are just slightly higher than those found in the 

studied open slope areas. The percentages of this mineral tend to decrease with 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 168 

increasing water depth for the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. In the Setúbal and Nazaré 

canyons and open slope transects there are no clear trends with increasing water depth 

(Figure 6.13d). 

The kaolinite crystallinity index (KCI) indicates the degree of order of the crystalline 

structure. The higher the value the less ordered the structure is. Referring to the 

classification defined in Chapter 4 (Figure 4.17, on pg. 95), KCI is low (crystalline 

kaolinites) throughout the Setúbal Canyon with no significant variation. Similar to what is 

observed on the Lisbon shelf (Chapter 4), crystalline kaolinites also occur in the upper 

reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons (~300 m WD). At 1000 m WD in both canyons 

a conspicuous increase in the index indicates the presence of semi-degraded and 

degraded kaolinites. Further down-canyon, the KCIs decrease reaching again low values 

(crystalline kaolinites similar to those observed in the upper canyon) at 2000 m WD. From 

this point downwards the KCI stays relatively low only with a slight increase in the Cascais 

Canyon. In general, the Nazaré Canyon has low KCIs (crystalline kaolinites) comparable to 

those observed in the Setúbal Canyon with increments of the index around 400 – 900 m 

and below 3200 m WD. In the walls and slopes of the canyons values are comparable to 

those observed in the thalweg of the canyons. In the open slope environment values are 

more variable but tend to be higher than those from the canyons. Below 1000 m WD 

there is an increment of the index around 1500 m WD for the Sines and Estremadura 

open slopes. This fact will be discussed in section 6.7.3. The Mondego transect has more 

stable values below 1000 m WD than the above transects with a gentle increase of the 

KCI with water depth. 

 

Smectite 

Contents of smectite in surface sediments are low compared to the other clay 

minerals, with values ranging from 0 to 4 %.  Most of the samples have smectite contents 

below 2 % except for the entire Mondego transect and between 900 and 1500 m WD in 

some of the other transects; from the seven transects studied, only in the Setúbal and 

Nazaré canyons and on the Mondego open slope this increase was not detected.  

 

Chlorite 

Chlorite contents span a relatively narrow range of values in surface sediments from 

the studied canyons (&amp;lt;4 %) and open slope areas (&amp;lt;6 %). The Setúbal and Nazaré 

canyons (&amp;lt;2 %) have consistently lower contents of chlorite than the Cascais Canyon.

The Lisbon Canyon shows a wider range of contents. Chlorite contents generally do not 

show a clear trend with water depth. Only in the Lisbon Canyon there is a conspicuous 

increase around 1100 m WD. 

 

6.6.2.  Clay mineralogy of suspended particulate matter 

The clay mineralogy of particulate matter collected in sediment trap shows a wide 

variability and is also generally different from that of the underlying surface sediments 

(Figure 6.13). Generally, smectite and chlorite tend to have higher contents in sediment 

trap samples than surface sediments. 

The only clear trend against water depth is observed for smectite, which in the 

Nazaré Canyon increase with increasing water depth. 

In general, the Esquevin Index in sediment trap samples spans a wide range of 

values with tendency to be higher than in the underlying surface sediments. For the 

Kubler Index one may find the opposite trend in the Nazaré and Lisbon canyons: the 

index tends to be lower in the trap samples compared to underlying sediments. In the 

Setúbal Canyon this is only found in some areas of the canyon. 

For the kaolinite crystallinity index values span a wide range of values and are 

generally higher (less ordered structure) in the trap samples compared to the underlying 

surface sediments. 

 

6.6.3.  Comparison between surface sediments from the canyons and 

adjacent outer shelf and upper slope 

The clay mineralogy of surface sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and 

Cascais canyons (~350 – 500 m WD) is very similar between both canyons. Illite and 

smectite contents are the same in both canyons with 66 and 2 %, respectively. Kaolinite 

has higher contents in the Lisbon Canyon than on the Cascais Canyon (31 and 28 %, 

respectively) while the opposite is true for chlorite (1 and 4 %, respectively). Mean 

concentrations of clay mineralogy from 9 surface sediments collected on the Lisbon outer

shelf/upper slope are very similar to those found in the upper reaches of the canyons with 

slightly higher contents of kaolinites (32 %). 

The upper reaches of the Setúbal Canyon have more mature surface sediments 

compared to the Lisbon and Cascais canyons as seen by its lower kaolinites contents 

(28 %) and higher contents of illite (70 %). Chlorite and smectite compose the remaining 

2 %. Both Setúbal and Sines outer shelves/upper slopes have similar clay compositions to 

the one found in the Setúbal Canyon. The Sines outer shelf/upper slope has slightly 

higher contents of smectite while the northern outer shelf/upper slope has slightly higher 

contents of kaolinite.

6.7. Discussion 

6.7.1.  Recent sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon 

 

Upper-canyon branches: Lisbon Canyon and upper Setúbal Canyon 

Previous work on submarine canyons has established that they may constitute major 

pathways for the transport of sediment (and associated organic matter) from land to the 

deep ocean, depending on the interplay of various factors. Horizontal and mass 

depositional sediment fluxes are important indicators of the effectiveness of submarine 

canyons in capturing sediments and transporting them to deeper areas.  

Relatively high sediment fluxes recorded in sediment traps and in seabed deposits of 

the canyons on the central Portuguese continental margin are clear evidence of the 

dynamic sedimentary environment present within these canyons. SPM concentrations (De 

Stigter et al., in press) and sediment accumulation rates (SAR) in the upper canyon 

reaches are an order of magnitude higher than the ones measured at comparable depths 

on adjacent slope areas (Figure 6.4), and values reported from other parts of the western 

Iberian margin (Faugères et al., 1984; McCave &amp;amp; Hall, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Van 

Weering et al., 2002). 

Sediment accumulation rates (SARs) measured in seabed sediment cores along the 

thalweg of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon show considerable variation with depth. The 

highest values occur between 1100 and 1400 m WD for the Lisbon Canyon and upper 

Setúbal Canyon. The highest sediment deposition fluxes measured in sediment traps from 

the Lisbon Canyon and upper Setúbal Canyon occur around 1100 and 1400 m WD, 

respectively. In the upper canyon reaches mass deposition fluxes estimated using 

sediment traps are consistently higher than SARs determined in the seabed. This is most 

likely due to cumulative trapping of resuspended sediment clouds produced during 

consecutive tidal cycles. In these same areas, De Stigter et al. (2004 and 2007a) detected 

well-developed bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers (BNLs and INLs) around the 

intersections of the canyon floor with the upper (500 m) and lower (1500 m) boundaries 

of the MOW while further down of the 1500 m isobath intermediate and deep waters 

apparently cleared up. The only exception was a bottom nepheloid layer of about 500 m 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 173

thick, observed in May 2004 at 2603 m WD (cruise 64PE225). The interaction of the MOW 

with the canyon seabed seems to favour resuspension of sediments which are potentially 

transported by internal tides cycles. At 500 m and between 1000 and 1500 m WD 

currents reach high speeds allowing cycles of deposition-resuspension.  

Despite the high efficiency of the traps, as indicated in Chapter 3 (pg. 53), the 

comparison between mass deposition flux intercepted by sediment traps and SARs based 

on 210Pb chronologies, as applied above for the upper canyons may raise questions 

because SARs are calculated on a longer time scale (~100 years) with regard to the 

daily/monthly/annual trap experiments here presented. Despite this, the comparison 

between both sets yields consistent information which is in accordance with other 

independent data such as near-bed current speeds. 

 

Deployment 218-36 in the upper Setúbal Canyon, which lasted for around 6 months, 

recorded a considerable temporal variation in composition of the mass deposition flux. 

Different from what was observed in other deployments in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, 

carbonate contents of trap samples of deployment 218-36 show no relationship with mass 

flux. The samples high in carbonate and with low Corg/N ratio (Figure 6.9) thus do not 

represent periods with reduced supply of lithogenic material through the canyon, but may 

reflect enhanced input of sediment from the adjacent open slope. Alternatively, but most 

unlikely as this was not seen in the other deployments, the higher concentrations of 

carbonate found between middle January and middle March 2004 (four samples) may 

represent a change in planktonic community in the water column (calcareous shelled 

groups vs. non-calcareous shelled groups), not necessarily accompanied by a change in 

primary productivity since concentrations of organic carbon did not increase significantly 

in this period (Figure 6.8f). In the upper Setúbal Canyon, surface sediments collected 

from the seabed have higher lithogenic material than particulate matter collected in 

sediment traps at equivalent water depths (by comparing Figure 6.6 with 6.8 and more 

explicitly in Figure 6.10). The mineralogical composition of surface sediments and trap 

sample also shows some differences. Smectite has higher contents in trap samples 

compared to the underlying sediments while the opposite is observed for kaolinite (Figure 

6.13 d, f). Figure 6.10 shows how material collected in traps of two deployments in the 

upper Setúbal Canyon have similar L/C ratios as surface sediments from the adjacent 

open slope. Therefore, most of the material in trap samples collected in the upper Setúbal 

Canyon seems to be derived from the adjacent slope/shelf, probably from the southern 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin

slope/shelf where surface sediments are characterised by low contents of lithogenic 

material (L/C &amp;lt;2, compare Figure 4.11 with 6.12a); low kaolinite contents (&amp;lt;30 %, 

compare Figure 4.16 with 6.13d) and relatively high smectite contents (&gt; 1 %, compare 

Figure 4.18 with 6.13f). On the other hand, surface sediments of the upper Setúbal 

Canyon represent the integrated input of sediment over a longer period of time, with 

contributions from the Setúbal shelf (Sado mud patch or possibly directly from the Sado 

River) north of the canyon, as suggested by similarity in mineralogy in 6.5.3. 

 

From the higher SARs determined for surface sediments, and higher contents of 

lithogenic material and more terrigenous Corg/N signature of organic matter, it appears 

that the Lisbon Canyon receives larger quantities of sediment from the near-shore area 

than the upper Setúbal Canyon. This is in accordance with the proximity of the Lisbon 

Canyon to the Tagus River, a much more important river in terms of annual mean 

discharge than the Sado River which feeds the upper Setúbal Canyon (cf. Chapter 2, pg. 

40). As illustrated in Figure 6.6a, surface sediment from the Lisbon Canyon head shows a 

great similarity in composition with sediments from the Tagus prodelta (described by Alt-

Epping et al., 2007). Most of the L/C ratios obtained for the Lisbon shelf area range 

between 6 and 10 (Figure 4.11), comparable to L/C ratios between 8 and 10 found in 

surface sediments from the head of the Lisbon Canyon. Garcia (1997) reported bottom 

nepheloid layers on the Lisbon shelf directed towards the Lisbon Canyon under influence 

of waves and wind from southwesterly direction. Thus, these bottom nepheloid layers are 

conceivably caused by resuspension of shelf sediments, which can probably reach the 

Lisbon and Cascais canyons during SW storms. However, the conspicuous decrease in L/C 

ratio in surface sediments further down the Lisbon Canyon suggests that, despite the high 

input of terrigenous sediment to the canyon head, there is no substantial down-canyon 

transport of sediments down the canyon. Conceivably, the strong meandering of the 

Lisbon Canyon at water depths between 1000 and 1500 m may form an obstruction to 

down-canyon transport of sediments. In fact the highest SAR measured in the whole 

canyon (20.8 g m-2 d-1) was measured in a piston core (252-34) collected just up-slope 

from where the canyon makes an almost complete 180º bend (Figures 6.2 and 6.4). In 

addition, the highest concentration of organic matter (5 %) is also found in this same 

core (Figure 6.6a) suggesting high input and rapid burial of organic material with little 

time for mineralization. The two BOBO lander deployments located up-slope from this 

meander bend recorded a net up-canyon water flow, and associated up-canyon SPM 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 175

fluxes around 4000 g m-2 d-1 in both deployments. However, surface sediments collected 

from nearby these lander deployments show a higher proportion of material derived from 

the shelf (expressed in e.g. L/C ratio, Felds/Phy ratio, Phy/Qz+Feld ratio) than the 

material collected in the sediment trap deployments. From this it can be inferred that up-

canyon fluxes recorded with BOBO landers are intermittent in nature, and may alternate 

with periods with predominance of down-canyon transport. Obviously, the short duration 

of 7-10 days of the upper canyon deployments is not sufficient to determine whether the 

observed up-canyon flow is an intermittent feature, alternating with down-canyon flow, or 

is representative for the longer term circulation in the canyon. Nevertheless, surface 

sediment characteristics suggest a decrease in down-canyon transport further down the 

Lisbon Canyon, possibly as a result of the morphology of the canyon. In the latter case of 

more or less permanent up-canyon flow, it might be related to local diversion of the 

along-slope flow of Mediterranean Outflow Water as it encounters the canyon. Then, the 

conspicuous maximum in L/C ratio in surface sediments near the head of the Lisbon 

Canyon, and decrease further down-canyon, may in fact reflect the dumping of dredged 

sediments from the Tagus Estuary in the Lisbon Canyon, and subsequent up-canyon 

dispersal by currents. Recent information from the APL (Administração do Porto de Lisboa 

– Administration of the Harbour of Lisbon) shows that 8000 m3 and 7500 m3 of 

contaminated sediments dredged from the Tagus Estuary were discharged in the Lisbon 

Canyon in 2005 and 2007, respectively (Nemus, 2011). The area used has a radius of 200 

m and central point at Longitude 09º 19’ W and Latitude 38º 29’ N (ED50) at around 

400 m of water depth (Figure 6.14). According to the APL this same area has been used 

by other institutions for discharge of sediments (e.g. military institutions which also 

dredge the estuary). The relative impact of these discharges on the natural sedimentary 

system of the Lisbon Canyon may be assessed by comparing the total mass of dumped 

sediment to an order of magnitude estimate of the annual sediment accumulation in the 

canyon thalweg. Taking 38 km for the length of the canyon (Lastras et al., 2009) and 

1 km for maximum width of the thalweg and average sediment accumulation of around 

8.75 g m-2 d-1 (section 6.3) yields an annual sediment accumulation in the Lisbon Canyon 

of around 12 x 1010 g dry weight. Assuming then that 15500 m3 of known discharges of 

2005 and 2007 had a dry bulk density of 1000 kg m-3 yields a total dry mass of dumped 

sediment of 1.55 x 1010 g, which is 12.8 % of the annual sediment accumulation in the 

Lisbon Canyon thalweg and 1.6 % of the annual sediment discharge from the Tagus 

Estuary into the adjacent shelf. 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 176 

Middle and Lower Setúbal Canyon 

Down-slope of the junction of the Lisbon and upper Setúbal Canyon branches mass 

depositional fluxes decrease one order of magnitude from 1 – 5 g m-2 d-1 at 2716 m WD to 

0.3 – 1.4 g m-2 d-1 at 4402 m WD, whereas also SARs measured in surface sediments 

decrease (Figure 6.4). Low values of bottom water turbidity observed during both lander 

deployments in the middle and lower canyon (Figures 6.1f and g), and good 

correspondence between mass deposition fluxes measured in traps and seabed SARs in 

the lower canyon (Figure 6.4) indicate limited resuspension from the seabed and a 

prevalence of sedimentation in this part of the canyon. Therefore, in the middle and lower 

canyon internal tides do not appear to be very effective in transporting sediments in up- 

or down-canyon directions. 

 

 
Figure 6.14. Location of the area used by APL and other institutions to discharge contaminated sediments 
dredged from the Tagus Estuary (marked as a red circle). 

 

Surface sediments from the middle and lower Setúbal Canyon have lithogenic 

contents between 72 – 77 % (2200 – 4400 m WD) comparable or slightly higher than for 

sediments from an equivalent water depth range on the walls and edges of the canyon 

(70 % at 2939 m WD) and on the Sines open slope (72 – 75 %, between 2130 and 

4987 m WD). L/C ratio and contents of kaolinite, which can be used as tracers for coastal 

and riverine inputs of sediments, have contents in surface sediments consistently higher 

in the Setúbal Canyon compared to the canyon edge and Sines open slope for equivalent 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 177

depths (Figures 6.10 and 6.13d). This may indicate that despite the low down-canyon 

transport of sediments from the upper-canyon, the funnel effect of the canyon may be 

enough to differentiate sediments from the canyon thalweg against those occurring in the 

open slope and even in the walls of the canyon. Conceivably, a larger input of lithogenic 

material from the adjacent shelf during winter months, due to increased river discharge 

and higher frequency of storms, may be included in the time-integrated record of seabed 

sediment, but may not be present in the suspended matter collected during comparatively 

shorter intervals sampled with the sediment traps (De Stigter et al., in press). For the 

lower canyon, at 4402 m WD (252-62), the relatively high contents of lithogenic material 

in surface sediments compared to suspended material collected with sediment traps in the 

same area may also result from bioturbation causing the upward mixing of lithogenic-

enriched turbiditic sediment buried at a few centimetres depth below the hemipelagic 

surface layer. 

Low-frequency and high-energy processes like gravity flows are also capable of 

transporting considerable amount of sediments further down-canyon. They seem, 

however, very rare in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. In fact, during the total time of five 

years and six months of BOBO deployments (2002 - 2007) no gravity flows were recorded 

in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. 

Overall, all collected data suggest that sediments are not transported effectively 

down to the lower canyon and rather accumulate in the upper canyon. The only evidence 

of relatively recent mass sediment transport from shallower areas to the lower canyon is a 

turbiditic sand layer, rich in quartz and mica, encountered below superficial mud in the 

lower Setúbal Canyon (225-07, 4445 m WD). According to 210Pb geochronology it seems, 

however, to be related with the Lisbon 1755 earthquake (De Stigter et al., in press). 

Representing the most recent recognisable event of mass transport, it shows that only 

powerful events like a major earthquake are capable of triggering sediment transport 

down to such water depths. 

 

6.7.2.  Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon vs. Nazaré Canyon (and others) 

Despite of its proximity to the coast and to an important river, the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon appears to be characterised by sediment accumulation rates (SAR) and mass 

deposition flux (MDF) one or two orders of magnitude lower than the relatively nearby 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 178 

Nazaré Canyon (Figure 6.15) (De Stigter et al., 2007b). SPM horizontal net fluxes 

estimated through the BOBO lander were also consistently higher in the Nazaré Canyon 

(De Stigter et al., 2007b) for comparable water depths (5600 and 1200 g m-2 d-1 at 343 

and 3010 m WD, respectively; cf. Table 6.1); however, around ~4300 m negligible net 

SPM transport was inferred for both canyons. In terms of SARs the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

seems to be more similar instead to other canyons located at far distances from the main 

sediment source (e.g. Bari Canyon - Turchetto et al., 2007). In accordance, the Cascais 

Canyon which has its multiple heads at the shelfbreak (~175 m WD) has comparable 

SARs to the former canyon (Figure 6.4).

Figure 6.15. Sediment accumulation rates (SAR) measured in the seabed based on 210Pb geochronology and 
mass deposition flux (MDF) measured in sediment traps, plotted against water depth in the Lisbon-Setúbal 
Canyon, Nazaré Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b) and Bari Canyon (Turchetto et al., 2007). Note the change 
of y-scale from Figure 6.4. 

 

It is generally accepted that sediment entering the canyon head from fluvial and/or 

along-shelf/open slope transport sources accumulates in a sediment pile in the upper 

canyon over time, producing a temporary sediment reservoir (Mastbergen &amp;amp; Van den 

Berg, 2003). Failure of this sediment deposit, which may occur due to a number of 

processes, results in low frequency, high-energy, sediment gravity flows rather than 

continuous sedimentation (Arzola et al., 2008). According to observations by De Stigter et 

al. (2007b) in the Nazaré Canyon, internal tides are a major force behind fine-grained 

suspended sediment transport from the canyon head to the middle canyon (2700 – 

4000 m WD), whereas intermittent gravity flows are responsible for down-canyon 

transport from the middle canyon to the lower canyon occurring on a yearly or longer 

timescales. As referred above already, in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon no gravity flow was 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 179

recorded during the total time of five years and six months of deployments while for a 

similar period of time at least three important mass flux events were recorded in the 

Nazaré Canyon. This might suggest that gravity flows in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon are 

not as common as in the Nazaré Canyon, and therefore play a minor role in transporting 

sediment to the middle and lower Setúbal Canyon. 

Surface sediments of the Nazaré Canyon show lithogenic contents consistently above 

80 % down to depths around 5000 m WD (Figure 6.16), and kaolinite contents higher 

than 30 % and Feld/Phy ratios &gt; 0.2 throughout the canyon, indicating effective transport 

of coastal sediments down to the lower canyon, in accordance with the hydrodynamic 

data. In the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons such mineralogical characteristics only 

occur in the upper reaches of the canyons close to the canyon head (Figure 6.16). 

Efficiency of the Nazaré Canyon in transporting sediments down to the lower canyon 

is also reflected in the supply of fresh organic matter to deeper ecosystems (Figure 6.17). 

García et al. (2010) compared organic matter content and its bioavailability in both the 

Nazaré and the Lisbon-Setúbal canyons and concluded that while in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon there are no major differences in Corg contents between the canyon and the 

adjacent slope, contents are considerably higher in the Nazaré Canyon compared to the 

adjacent slope. As shown in Figure 6.17 these differences can also be noticed in the data 

here presented. García et al. (2010) found, however, that quality of organic matter in 

both regions is similar for equivalent depths in the canyon and on the slope, which may 

be interpreted as an indication that lateral transport through the canyons occurs on a time 

scale that is too long to preserve the freshness of the organic material. 

Even so, the fact that sediment accumulation rates determined for the axis of the 

Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons are consistently higher than SARs determined for the 

canyon walls and edges and for the Sines and Estremadura open slopes indicates that, for 

this area of the Portuguese margin, the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and the Cascais Canyon 

act as important depocentres of sediments. This relative importance of canyons as 

depocentres or geomorphological traps of sediments compared to the surrounding slope 

environments was already demonstrated for other submarine canyons: e.g. for the Nazaré 

Canyon (Portuguese margin), Schmidt et al. (2001), Van Weering et al. (2002) and De 

Stigter et al. (2007b); for the Bari Canyon (Adriatic Sea), Turchetto et al. (2007); for the 

Foix Canyon (Catalonia margin), Sanchez-Cabeza et al. (1999).

6.7.3. Open slope of the central Portuguese continental margin 

The Lisbon-Setúbal, Cascais and Nazaré canyons act as natural boundaries dividing 

the central Portuguese margin in different sections of shelf and slope, here referred to as 

the Mondego, Estremadura, Lisbon, Setúbal and Sines shelf and slope, each with its 

specific pattern of sediment distribution.  

From the three studied open slope areas (Mondego, Estremadura and Sines), the 

Sines open slope stands out for its higher SARs and higher contents of non-carbonate 

terrigenous materials (around 70 %) comparing equivalent water depths, while the 

Estremadura shows the lowest SARs and contents of non-carbonate terrigenous materials 

(around 60 %). The Mondego open slope has intermediate features regarding the above 

parameters being nonetheless the closest transect to a main river - Mondego River 

(Figures 6.4 and 6.6e, f, h). The differences between the Sines and Estremadura areas 

can be related to the following: 

1) several studies (e.g. Ortiz &amp;amp; Mix, 1992; Thunell &amp;amp; Sautter, 1992) clearly show that 

maximum fluxes of planktonic foraminifera occur when upwelling is more intense. 

Salgueiro et al. (2008) show lower mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) between 1985 

and 2003 during summer time in the Estremadura margin compared with the SSTs from 

Sines margin (see Figure 2.11 on pg. 36 of Chapter 2). This suggests more intense 

upwelling occurring around the northern area. According to these same authors, higher 

planktonic foraminifera abundance occurs in the Estremadura margin, associated with the 

Cape Roca. This fact does explain higher CaCO3 contents in the northern open slope but 

does not explain however higher SARs measured in the Sines open slope; 

2) the progressive deposition of suspended fine-grained terrigenous material along 

entrained with the MOW along the Portuguese continental slope (Grousset et al., 1988) 

must be higher in the Sines area than in the Estremadura area. This subject will be 

further discussed below. 

  

The imprint of the Mediterranean Outerflow Water 

The high distance from terrigenous sediment supply and winnowing of sediments on 

the upper slope can help to lower SAR and concentrate CaCO3 contained in foram shells in 

the Estremadura open slope. The concentration of CaCO3 may be also partially explained 

by relatively higher productivity of foraminifera in the Estremadura slope. Since no 

important rivers debouch on the coast facing the Sines open slope, it is contrary to 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 183

expectations that sediment accumulation rates and contents of lithogenic material are 

found to be higher on the Sines open slope than on the Estremadura and Mondego open 

slopes. Deposition of sediments entrained with the MOW may help explaining these higher 

SARs and associated higher contents of lithogenic material on the Sines open slope. 

According to McCave &amp;amp; Hall (2002), the strong density gradients at the boundaries of 

the MOW favour internal wave activity and sediment resuspension. Suspended particles 

on the upper slope may be carried along with the poleward flowing MOW, forming a wide 

and permanent intermediate nepheloid layer over the upper slope, as observed on the 

Galician slope by McCave &amp;amp; Hall (2002). Moreover, as observed in south-western Gulf of 

Cadiz, settling of suspended sediment from the MOW may also be found in areas where 

the MOW flows detached from the seafloor, giving rise to the formation of hemipelagites. 

 

Along-margin perspective 

The Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) was clearly recognised in hydrographic 

profiles across the central Portuguese continental margin, as distinct salinity maximum 

between 500 and 1500 m WD (De Stigter et al., 2004 and 2007a, Figure 2.10 on pg. 34). 

Along the Portuguese margin this water mass mixes with other less saline and colder 

waters as shown in Figure 2.10. Bower et al. (2002) show that there is a significant 

amount of mixing of the lower-core MOW around the south-western Iberian Peninsula and 

that a considerable portion of the lower-core water flows into the interior of the ocean 

after crossing the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon as the large-scale orientation of the slope 

changes from north-south to northwest-southeast. 

In the Gulf of Cadiz, Pierce &amp;amp; Stanley (1975) observed that smectite content in SPM 

in the MOW is twice as high as in the overlying surface water and two to four times 

higher than in the underlying surface sediments. The source for this smectite is thought 

to be the Guadalquivir River (Mélières, 1974; Grousset et al., 1988; Schönfeld, 1997).  

Although there are other sources of smectite in the area, the results of the present 

study show that there is a northward regional decrease of smectite contents, within the 

depth interval affected by the MOW flow. Between 1000 and 1500 m WD smectite 

contents in surface sediments decrease from 3.5 % on the Sines open slope, to 2.7 % on 

the Estremadura slope, to 2.1 % on the Mondego slope. Within the canyons, in the same 

depth interval, smectite contents were between 1.6 and 3.2 %. Grousset et al. (1988) 

also observed this general decrease of smectite contents along the Portuguese margin but 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 184 

the percentages obtained in this study are not comparable to those reported here as 

different methodologies were used to quantify clay minerals. 

 

Across-margin perspective 

The across-margin changes in the mineralogy of surface sediments which may be 

related to the MOW include: 

1) Enhanced contents of smectite between 1000 and 1500 m WD (Figure 6.13f); 

2) Decrease of kaolinite’s crystallinity between 1000 and 1500 m WD (Figure 6.13e); 

3) Conspicuous increase of the carbonate contents around 1500 m WD (Figure 6.6e, 

f, h) in the open slope transects. 

The across-margin changes of the clay mineralogy (point 1 and 2) are most 

conspicuous in the Sines and Estremadura open slope transects and in the Lisbon and 

Cascais canyons. The clay mineral signature of MOW seems almost lost or diluted in the 

Mondego transect and neither is it detected in the Nazaré Canyon, probably due to the 

more active down-canyon transport of sediments through this canyon. The reason why it 

is also not detected in the upper Setúbal branch is not clear. It could be due to a change 

of the course of the water mass in this area. Many studies have highlighted the important 

modifications that along-slope currents suffer when they encounter a canyon on their 

path (e.g. Durrieu de Madron, 1994; Puig et al., 2000; Petrenko, 2003). 

Suspended particulate matter of the MOW is not only enriched in smectite but also in 

kaolinite (Grousset et al., 1988). This mineral, however, seems not a suitable tracer for 

this water mass because kaolinite enrichment in sediments from the central Portuguese 

margin may also be derived from other sources such as the Tagus and Sado rivers. 

However, crystallinity index of kaolinite across the open slope transects indicates the 

occurrence of more degraded kaolinites between 1000 and 1500 m WD. These kaolinites 

seem therefore to have a different and more distant source than those predominating at 

different water depths, conceivably transported by the MOW. The occurrence of the 

maximum in smectite contents and kaolinite crystallinity minimum in the 1000-1500 m 

depth interval indicates that SPM carried along the MOW settles in the lower part of the 

MOW.   

Winnowing of surface sediments by enhanced currents associated with the MOW 

appears to be reflected by grain size distribution patterns across the open slope. Whereas 

at water depths below 2000 m surface sediments have relatively uniform grain size 

spectra with mode &amp;lt;8 µm typical for hemipelagic sedimentation (Figure 6.18), sediments 



6. Sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and adjacent margin 

 185

between 500 and 2000 m WD have distinctly coarser modes indicating that pelagic 

sedimentation is not the main process affecting surface sediments. On the upper Sines 

slope, particle size mode at 500 m WD is coarser than at 1500 m WD (Figure 6.18). The 

above suggests that the fine grained sediment fraction is removed from the slope affected 

by the upper MOW and settles near the lower limit of the MOW limit together with 

suspended matter entrained by the MOW from more distant sources. As proposed by 

Schönfeld (1997) the reason for the enhanced sedimentation in the lower MOW core layer 

may be the rapidly decreasing or highly variable water turbulence at this level. This same 

author observed the accumulation of pteropod shells around 1500 m WD on the Sines 

open slope which may explain the conspicuous increase of carbonate contents around this 

depth as seen in the three open slope transects (Figure 6.6) and as indicated before in 

point 3.

As will be shown in the next chapter, on the Sines open slope the highest enrichment 

factors of Pb in surface sediments and highest contents of excess Pb and Zn deposited 

during the last 150 years occur exactly around the lower MOW boundary (Figures 7.10, 

7.12 and 7.13) giving evidence of import of trace elements from an exotic source or 

concentration of these trace elements with a certain mineral fraction.

7.1. Introduction 

Contamination of the marine environment with anthropogenic trace metals has 

strongly increased over the last ~150 years as a result of the exponential growth in the 

world’s population and industrial development. In the last few decades this contamination 

has become an issue of international concern, urging for research on the sources, 

dispersal pathways, and sites of accumulation of these trace metals. Since trace metals 

originating from human activity usually accumulate in sediments together with trace 

metals from natural sources, it is often difficult to quantify the contribution from the 

respective sources (Soto-Jiménez &amp;amp; Páez-Osuna, 2001). The problem is amplified by 

variable loadings of trace elements originating from these two sources, as well as the 

interaction of elements with sediment of variable grain size, mineralogy and organic 

matter content (Soto-Jiménez &amp;amp; Páez-Osuna, 2001). Several granulometric and 

geochemical procedures have been developed to compensate for such influence and to 

allow comparisons between samples with different characteristics. Geochemical 

procedures include normalisation in relation to a conservative element such as Al, Fe, Rb, 

Cs, Sc and Li (e.g. Grant &amp;amp; Middleton, 1990; Loring &amp;amp; Rantala, 1992). 

Even then, knowing only the total concentrations and chemical/mineralogical context 

of trace metals is not strictly sufficient for a precise evaluation of contamination sources. 

In the present study lead stable isotopes are therefore introduced as “fingerprints” of 

environmental pollution, because it is the only trace metal pollutant known to exhibit

Portuguese continental margin 

 188 

significant natural variation in the proportions of its isotopes - 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb 

(Dickin, 1995). The isotopic proportions, usually expressed as isotope ratios, display 

characteristic ranges for different natural Pb ores and are thought to be unaltered by 

smelting and other manufacturing processes (Flegal &amp;amp; Smith, 1995). Therefore, Pb 

isotope “signatures” have been increasingly used by environmental scientists as tracers to 

putatively identify the different natural and industrial contributions of Pb in humans and 

the environment (Sangster et al., 2000).  

Trace metals enter the ocean from sources located on continents via atmospheric 

transport or riverine input. Like many other contaminants, trace metals are removed from 

the sea water by biological and physico-chemical processes, including scavenging by 

suspended particulate organic matter, to become incorporated into sediments on the 

seabed (Boström et al., 1981; Gibbs, 1986). Most of the contaminants discharged by 

rivers, sewers and pipelines are associated with fine-grained particles (Salomons &amp;amp; 

Förstner, 1984), including organic films, colloidal material or plankton cells (Fisher &amp;amp; 

Reinfelder, 1995). Thus, the fate of contaminants introduced to the sea is closely 

associated with the transport and deposition of particulate matter (Gibbs, 1973; Puig et 

al., 1999). 

Submarine canyons are important transport routes for the transfer of particulate 

matter from the coastal ocean to the deep sea. Although most submarine canyons are 

presently sites of sediment accumulation rather than of erosion, some studies show 

intermittent mass transport of sediments down canyons continuing to the present-day 

(e.g. Xu et al., 2002; Palanques et al., 2005; De Stigter et al., 2007b). For the large 

submarine canyons of the central Portuguese margin, which are the subject of the 

present study, present-day intermittent down-canyon transport to depths greater than 

4000 m has been confirmed for the Nazaré Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b). Results 

presented in Chapter 6 indicate that down-canyon transport is less effective in the Lsibon-

Setúbal Canyon, and probably as well in the Cascais Canyon. Mass down-canyon transport 

of sediments seems to occur only infrequently in these canyons, triggered by high energy 

seismic events. The latter two canyons, located close to densely populated and 

industrialized metropolitan areas and heading close to where the Tagus and Sado rivers 

debouch on the shelf, are likely to intercept riverine sediments and associated trace 

metals. By contrast, the Nazaré Canyon has no direct connection to a major river system, 

and is more remote from point sources of anthropogenic pollutants. 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 189

Trace metal contamination has been documented for the Tagus and Sado estuaries 

(e.g. Figuères et al., 1985; Quevauviller, 1988; Cortesão &amp;amp; Vale, 1995; Gil &amp;amp; Vale, 2001; 

Caeiro et al., 2005; França et al., 2005; Vale et al., 2008) and to a lesser extent, the 

adjacent open shelf (e.g. Jouanneau et al., 1998; Cotté-Krief et al., 2000; Mil-Homens et 

al., 2009; Chapter 5). Little attention has been paid to the nearby canyons and deep slope 

environments. Even worldwide, studies involving the dispersal of trace metals through 

canyon systems are scarce. 

The main objectives of the present chapter are to assess: 

1) the geographic patterns of excess trace metals dispersal in three Portuguese 

canyons (Lisbon-Setúbal, Nazaré and Cascais) and open slope; 

2) natural and anthropogenic sources of trace metals in the canyons and open slope 

of the central Portuguese margin, with especial focus on Pb;  

3) the role of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon in channelling transport of anthropogenic 

trace metals to the deep sea. Data from the Nazaré Canyon will be used to establish 

comparisons with the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. The Nazaré Canyon was studied in more 

detail with regard to the dispersal of Pb by Richter et al. (2009). 

The last objective will be approached through the comparison of enrichment factors 

obtained for trap samples and surface sediment cores and by integrating trace metal data 

with observations on near-bottom hydrodynamics and sediment dispersal from the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon (Chapter 6) and the Nazaré Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007b).

7.2. Major, minor and trace element concentrations 

In this section the distribution of eleven elements (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cr, Mn, Ni, 

Cu and U) in surface sediments and sediment trap samples from the central Portuguese 

canyons and open slope will be evaluated and correlated with other relevant sedimentary 

parameters such as grain size, lithogenic content, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and organic 

carbon (Corg) / organic matter. 

Subsequently, the enrichment with anthropogenic trace metals will be assessed, first 

for the most recent sediment deposit included in the top 0.5 cm of sediment cores and for 

sediment trap samples by using enrichment factors, and then for the last 150 years by 

looking at the relative contribution of excess trace metals to total trace metal inventories. 

7.2.1. General characteristics of surface sediments and suspended 

particulate material 

Surface sediments in the canyon thalweg and lower part of the walls comprise mostly 

hemipelagic clayey silt composed of terrigenous lithogenic material (72 - 87 %), calcium 

carbonate (10 - 25 %) and organic matter (1.4 - 5.0 %) (Figure 7.1a, b). Higher up the 

walls and edges of the canyons, surface sediments show lower concentrations of 

lithogenic materials (69 - 78 %) and organic matter (1.4 - 2.8 %) while carbonate 

contents are generally higher (20 - 27 %). True open slope surface sediments have even 

lower contents of lithogenic material (39 - 75 %) and organic matter (0.3 - 1.0 %) and 

higher carbonate contents (24 - 60 %). Canyon surface sediments generally have a modal 

grain size between 8 and 50 µm, while upper slope surface sediments often have modal 

grain size coarser than 50 µm, and sediments from the middle and lower slope have 

modes finer than 8 µm. Surface sediments from the walls and edges of the canyons 

usually have grain sizes within the range of open slope sediments, but may also have 

modal grain sizes between 8 and 50 µm. Generally, modal grain sizes decrease with depth 

down the canyons and on the adjacent open slope, but in the Nazaré Canyon modal grain 

size increases until 4500 m WD (Chapter 6, Figure 6.5 on pg. 152). 

Suspended particulate matter collected in sediment traps along the canyon axes 

consists of clayey silt with minor coarse material (sand-sized particles never exceed 6 % 

of the total content). In general, carbonate contents increase with depth down-canyon, 

probably reflecting a reduction of lithogenic input. Contents of organic material are higher

material plotted against water depth for the Lisbon-Setúbal, Cascais and Nazaré canyons and adjacent canyon 
edges and open slopes. 

 

7.2.2. Major elements Ca, Fe, Al and minor element Mn 

With regard to major elements, the regional distribution of Ca closely matches the 

distribution of CaCO3, with lower contents in canyons (especially in the Nazaré Canyon) 

and higher values on open slopes (Figure 7.2a). Concentrations of Al tend to be higher in 

canyons than on true open slopes (Table 7.1, Figure 7.2b). On the other hand, Fe shows 

more or less uniform mean concentrations for all environments (Table 7.1). Neither in 

canyons or open slopes are consistent trends with water depth observed for Ca, Fe and Al 

contents in surface sediments and trap samples, except that Ca has higher concentrations 

in trap samples from the lower canyons. 

No major differences are found between contents of Mn in canyons and open slopes 

at comparable water depths (Figure 7.2d). Concentrations generally increase with 

increasing water depth both in canyons and slopes, but a conspicuous maximum is 

observed in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon just down-slope from where the upper canyon 

branches merge.

7.2.3. Trace metal concentrations in surface and pre-industrial 

sediments and in suspended particulate material 

Comparison of elemental contents in surface sediments in the three canyons reveals 

higher mean concentrations for most analysed trace metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni) and 

Mn in the Cascais Canyon (Table 7.1). Surface sediments from the Nazaré Canyon display 

the lowest means for Pb, Zn, Cu and Mn and the highest for Al.  

In surface sediments from canyons and open slopes, Pb and Zn concentrations 

generally decrease with increasing water depth (Figure 7.3a, b) while Cr and Cu show the 

inverse trend (Figure 7.3c, d). Nickel does not show any trend with water depth. Trap 

samples along the axes of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyons have concentrations 

comparable to underlying surface sediments, except in lower canyon sites where trap 

samples show consistently higher trace metal contents (Figure 7.3).

Pre-industrial sediments (~1850 AD) were analysed in deep samples from 14 cores 

from the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyons and adjacent open slopes (see the location 

of selected cores in Figure 3.2). Baseline concentrations for the various elements were 

determined separately for the Lisbon-Setúbal area (9 samples) and the Nazaré area (5 

samples), taking the simple average of all deep samples from the respective areas. The 

baseline values thus calculated for the Lisbon-Setúbal system (used also for the Cascais 

and Sines transect) and for the Nazaré system (used also for the Estremadura transect) 

are very similar for most of the analysed elements (Table 7.1).

Surface sediment and sediment trap samples display consistently higher 

concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cu compared to pre-industrial concentrations (average ± 

standard deviation) presented as grey shaded bars in Figure 7.3. Chromium and Ni show 

comparable concentrations in surface sediments and trap samples as in pre-industrial 

sediments. 

 

7.2.4. Selection of a normaliser for calculating enrichment factors 

Temporal or spatial variation in trace metal distribution may to some extent be 

related to variation in supply of major sediment components with which the trace metals 

are associated. To compensate for this effect, normalisation is often applied relative to a 

proxy of the most important carrier. Correlations between trace metal and carrier proxies 

may help in identifying the most suitable carrier proxy to be used as normaliser. Among 

various proxies for potential trace metal carriers, such as Al and Fe for terrigenous 

aluminosilicates, Ca and CaCO3 for pelagic skeletal carbonate, and Corg for organic matter, 

Fe and Al showed the largest number of significant positive correlations with trace metals, 

suggesting that terrigenous aluminosilicates are the dominant trace metal carriers in the 

study area. Spearman correlations calculated for all surface sediment samples (Table 7.2) 

from all the studied canyons and open slopes show positive correlation of Fe with Cr 

(0.78), Cu (0.57), Pb (0.40), Ni and Zn (0.33). Correlations between Al and trace metals 

are less strong than for Fe. Organic carbon is only correlated to Pb (0.44) while CaCO3 

has no positive correlation with any trace metal. Modal grain size only correlates positively 

with Zn (0.46) and negatively with Cu (-0.51). In general, the correlations between trace 

metals and trace metal carrier proxies do not seem to be strong when using the whole 

dataset of surface sediments. This is most conceivably because differences in 

anthropogenic trace metal input to different areas lead to variable trace metal/trace metal 

carrier ratios, disturbing the natural correlation between both. Correlations were therefore 

calculated separately for the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré Canyon systems as shown in 

Tables 7.3 and 7.4, making further distinction between surface sediment and trap 

samples. Indeed these subsets of data yield more significant correlations than the entire 

dataset, but since the results do not differ much in qualitative sense they will not be 

discussed here for the separate datasets.

Normalisation to Corg is only useful when organic matter is relatively homogeneous in 

composition (predominantly of pelagic or terrestrial origin). However, according to our 

Corg/N ratios (Chapter 6, Figure 6.9 on pg. 157), the Corg in the canyon comprises a 

variable mixture of marine and laterally advected terrigenous organic matter. On the 

adjacent slope the Corg is predominantly of marine origin. Apart from that, there are 

differences in degradation state when comparing sediment trap material and surface or 

deep sediments (Figure 7.1a) which makes the use of Corg as normaliser problematic. 

Since analytical results showed a better accuracy for Fe than for Al, and Fe showed 

the strongest correlations to trace metals, Fe was chosen for the normalisation of trace 

metals. Normalisation for Al yielded very similar results, albeit more scattered than for Fe, 

conceivably because of the lower accuracy of Al analyses. We found no indication in our 

data that secondary diagenetic enrichment of trace metals played a significant role. The 

few cores displaying distinct surface enrichment of Fe and Mn (225-22, 204-56, 236-14, 

236-20 for Fe and 236-52, 204-33 for Mn) showed no corresponding enrichment in trace 

metals. 

 

7.2.5. Trace metal concentrations in surface sediment and trap samples 

and NOAA sediment quality guideline 

In all studied canyon systems there were surface sediments and sediment trap 

samples with concentrations of trace metals (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn) exceeding the ERL (effect 

range-low) value, but there were no concentrations above the ERM (effect range-

medium). In almost all analysed samples Ni exceeded the ERL, yet Long et al. (1995) 

argue that sediment guidelines for Ni have low accuracy. 

In the Lisbon-Setúbal, Cascais and Nazaré canyons all analysed trace metals reached 

concentrations above the ERL in one or more samples. There are samples with 

concentrations of Pb above the ERL especially in the upper reaches of the canyons. 

Copper and Cr showed concentrations above the ERL in the walls of the canyons and in 

the lower canyons. For Zn the Cascais Canyon is highlighted since all samples collected 

had concentrations above the ERL. 

On the Sines open slope, Cr, Cu and Zn showed contents exceeding the ERL in all 

samples from below 1000 m WD while Pb had no samples above the ERL. On the 

Estremadura open slope there were no samples with contents of Pb and Cr higher than 

the ERL. For Cu and Zn two samples of the four collected in this area had concentrations 

above the ERL. 

Assessment of trace metal distribution by reference to NOAA guidelines highlights 

samples from all study areas with enhanced trace metal contents. In the southern 

canyons higher concentrations of trace metals were mainly encountered in surface 

sediments from the upper reaches of the canyons. In the northern area enhanced 

concentrations of all the considered trace metals were mostly found in sediment trap 

samples from the lower Nazaré Canyon. 

Interpretations based on sediment quality guidelines must be treated with due 

caution since they do not take regional biotic and environmental variability into account 

nor the specific sediment composition. In the present study they are presented just as a 

preliminary step for the evaluation of trace metal dispersion. 

  

7.2.6. Present-day trace metal enrichment 

 

Lead and Zinc 

In the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons all surface sediment samples show EF 

(Pb) higher than 1.0 (Figure 7.4a). Highest EF (Pb) values above 2.5 are found in the 

upper reaches of these canyons, whereas EF values generally decrease further down-

canyon. The lowest values (EF &amp;lt;1.5) correspond to two samples collected on the open 

slope (225-02 and 225-20, EF = 1.4) and one in the lower part of the canyon (225-07, EF

= 1.3). Zinc enrichment has a largely comparable distribution as Pb though generally with 

lower EF values (Figure 7.4a, b). EF (Zn) values above 1.5 occurred only in the Lisbon 

Canyon. Both Pb and Zn showed highest enrichments in the Lisbon Canyon, followed by 

Cascais and upper Setúbal canyons. 

In the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, EF (Pb) has an offshore logarithmic decrease in both 

canyon branches (r2 = 0.60 and 0.57, respectively) while EF (Zn) only shows it for the 

Setúbal Canyon. Samples collected on the walls and edges of the canyons reveal 

consistently lower EFs than surface samples collected at equivalent water depths along 

the axis of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons. 

EFs in surface sediments of the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons are 

comparable to those from surface sediments from the Lisbon outer shelf and upper slope 

(Chapter 5, Table 5.5 on pg. 133). EFs in surface sediments of the upper Setúbal Canyon, 

however, are higher than the mean values obtained for the Setúbal and Sines upper 

slopes for both Pb and Zn. 

In the Nazaré Canyon, EF (Pb) and EF (Zn) above 1.5 are only found in the upper 

reaches of the canyon, at depths less than 1000 m WD. Lower values are found further 

down the canyon. Canyon surface samples show a slight EF decrease with water depth, 

especially for Pb, whereas open slope values are relatively constant for Zn and do not 

show a consistent pattern with water depth for Pb (Figure 7.4a, b). 

Enrichment factors of Pb and Zn are slightly lower on the walls and edges of the 

canyons than on true open slope transects (Sines and Estremadura) (Figure 7.4a, b). 

Possibly this reflects dilution with pre-industrial sediment, either by hydrodynamic mixing 

or bioturbation. Comparing samples at equivalent water depths, the enrichment factors of 

Pb and Zn are higher in the Sines transect than for the Estremadura transect. 

 

Copper 

In contrast with Pb and Zn, Cu enrichment shows a logarithmic increase with water 

depth (r2 = 0.67) in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and the adjacent slope. For the Cascais 

Canyon EF (Cu) increases with increasing water depth as well but values are consistently 

lower than for the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (Figure 7.4c). Surface sediments from the 

upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons have comparable EFs (Cu) to the mean 

value obtained for the Lisbon outer shelf and upper slope (1.2 each area). Surface 

sediments from the upper Setúbal Canyon have also comparable EFs (Cu) to those found 

on the Setúbal and Sines outer shelves and upper slopes (Table 5.5). 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 201

In the Nazaré Canyon, EFs (Cu) in surface sediments are more or less constant both 

along the canyon thalweg and on the adjacent slope. 

On the open slopes, EFs (Cu) are generally higher near the edges of the canyons 

than on true open slope sediments (Figure 7.4c). No differences in Cu enrichment are 

observed between the Sines and Estremadura transects.

7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central

Chromium and Nickel 

Whereas Pb, Zn and Cu are variably enriched throughout the central Portuguese 

canyons and open slope transects there is little if any evidence for surface enrichment of 

Cr and Ni in any part of the study area (Figure 7.4d, e). 

Within the canyons there are no clear trends in enrichment factors with water depth 

for Cr and Ni, and neither are substantial differences observed in enrichment of these 

elements between the canyons, except that EF (Ni) seem higher in the Cascais Canyon 

compared to the other canyons. On the open slopes, no differences are observed in Cr 

enrichment, but Ni enrichments seem to be higher in the Sines transect. 

EFs of Cr and Ni in sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais 

canyons are comparable to those found in surface sediments from the Lisbon outer 

shelf/upper slope, but EF (Ni) values in the Cascais Canyon are considerably higher than 

those found in the upper slope. Surface sediments from the upper Setúbal Canyon have 

also comparable EFs (Cr and Ni) to those found on the Setúbal and Sines outer 

shelves/upper slopes (Table 5.5). 

 

7.2.7. Excess and total metal inventories over the last 150 years 

Inventories of excess Pb, Zn and Cu in sediments from the canyons range from 

values comparable to, to values two orders of magnitude higher than the ones recorded 

in open slope sediments for equivalent water depth (Figure 7.5, Table 7.5).  

In general, the contributions of excess Pb, Zn and Cu relative to total inventories 

deposited over the last 150 years decrease with increasing water depth for both canyons 

and open slope (Figures 7.6, 7.7, 7.8). The contribution of excess Pb (Pbxs) varies from a 

maximum of 56 and 41 % in the upper Lisbon and Setúbal canyons, respectively, to a 

minimum of 6 % in the lower canyon (4402 m WD). In the Cascais Canyon, percentages 

vary from 53 to 29 % from 953 to 3900 m WD. Sediments from the upper Nazaré Canyon 

have Pbxs percentages between 37 and 42 %, similar to the ones from the upper Setúbal 

canyon (Figure 7.6). In general, percentages of Pbxs are lower in the northern part of the 

study area, adjacent to the Nazaré Canyon and at the Estremadura transect, than in the 

southern part, for equivalent water depths. For example, between 2000 and 3000 m WD 

there is ~12 % more Pbxs in the Sines open slope compared to the Estremadura open 

slope (Figure 7.6).

Percentages of excess Zn (Znxs) are clearly higher in the Lisbon Canyon (51 – 55 %) 

compared to the upper Setúbal Canyon (14 – 20 %). The only core in the Nazaré Canyon 

reliable for Zn, located at 941 m WD, has 21 % of Znxs, comparable to the upper Setúbal 

Canyon values (Figure 7.7, Table 7.5). In the Cascais Canyon a more complete set of Znxs 

percentages was obtained for the whole canyon range from 58 % (953 m WD) down to 

10 % (3914 m WD). Excess Zn on the open slope transects has considerably lower values 

of 15 % (490 m WD) down to 6 % (3900 m WD). Values from the open slopes adjacent 

to the canyons span a wide range of 9 – 36 %. 

Excess Cu (Cuxs) reaches the highest values on the slope around 1000 m WD, 43 % 

in the Lisbon-Setúbal area and 27 % in the Nazaré area (Figure 7.8). At equivalent water 

depth in the canyons, lower values of 22 %, 21 %, 17 % and 6 % are found for the 

Cascais, Lisbon, Nazaré and Setúbal canyons, respectively.

7.3. Discussion 

7.3.1. Distribution patterns of excess trace metal accumulation in 

Portuguese canyons and open slopes 

Contents of major elements Ca, Al and Fe and some trace metals like Cr and Ni in 

surface sediments appear largely similar to contents measured in pre-industrial sediments 

(Figures 7.2 and 7.3), meaning that in terms of bulk composition the sediment has not 

changed over the last 150 years. Pre-industrial concentrations of trace metals, Fe and Al  

are largely similar for the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré Canyon systems (Table 7.1), 

whereas recent surface sediments and suspended particulate matter usually display 

higher concentrations of various trace metals, for some elements appreciably diverging 

between both areas. Surface sediments and suspended particulate matter in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon have higher mean concentrations of Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr and Ni (and Cu, Fe for 

surface sediments only) compared to the Nazaré Canyon (Table 7.1). Regarding only 

surface sediments, the highest mean concentrations for all trace metals are found in the 

Cascais Canyon.  

Percentages of excess trace metal accumulated over the last 150 years in sediment 

deposits are also higher for the southern canyons, especially the Lisbon and Cascais 

canyons (Table 7.5). This is consistent with the proximity of the Lisbon and Cascais 

canyons to densely populated and industrialised areas, and with sediment input from the 

Tagus River, a potential major source of particle-bound pollutants.  

The degree of trace metal enrichment found in sediments from the Lisbon and 

Cascais canyons is comparable or higher to what has been previously published from 

other canyon and slope areas (Figure 7.5), such as the Foix Canyon in the NW 

Mediterranean (Palanques et al., 2008), the Gulf of Lions continental slope in the NW 

Mediterranean (Miralles et al., 2006), and the Kaoping Canyon off Taiwan (Hung &amp;amp; Hsu, 

2004). 

Thus, the canyons of the central Portuguese margin represent different degrees of 

trace metal enrichment, with the upper Cascais and Lisbon canyons being the more 

affected by trace metal contamination, and the Nazaré Canyon the least. This applies not 

only for the most recent sediments but also for sediments deposited over the last 150 

years.

Portuguese continental margin 

 209

On the other hand, comparing trace metals inventories in canyons and adjacent open 

slopes demonstrates that the upper canyons act as trace metal depocentres. Maximum 

excess inventories occur in the upper parts of the canyons between 500 and 1700 m WD 

(Figure 7.5 and Table 7.5), which is where trace metal loadings generally are highest and 

where active sediment depocentres are located (De Stigter et al., 2007b; Oliveira et al., 

2007; Arzola et al., 2008). 

7.3.2. The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon: trace metal enrichment and links to 

sediment input and transport 

 

Contributions from the Tagus and Sado rivers to the canyon 

As seen above the Lisbon and upper Setúbal canyons are hotspots of Pb and Zn 

enrichment relative to the deeper canyon reaches and adjacent open slopes. The Lisbon 

and Setúbal Canyon heads are located close to the mouths of the Tagus and Sado rivers, 

respectively, where high trace metal concentrations in water, sediments and biota due to 

anthropogenic activities have been reported (e.g. Cotté-Krief et al., 2000; Caeiro et al., 

2005; França et al., 2005).  

A gradient of decreasing Pb and Zn enrichment, from the Tagus prodelta (Chapter 5 

and Mil-Homens et al., 2009) to the head of the Lisbon Canyon and then further down, 

strongly suggests that the excess Pb and Zn must be derived from land, with the Tagus 

River appearing as the most important local source. This is supported by observations by 

Jouanneau et al. (1998), who noted a southward gradient in intensity of bottom nepheloid 

layers on part of the Lisbon shelf, and in Pb and Zn concentrations in the underlying 

seabed sediments, from the Tagus River mouth to close the head of Lisbon Canyon. Much 

less sediment and associated trace metals appear to be transferred from the Sado River 

into the upper Setúbal Canyon, judging from the consistently lower enrichment of Pb and 

Zn in the latter canyon, as compared to the Lisbon Canyon, despite the fact that also the 

Sado Estuary is enriched in Pb and Zn. The less effective transfer may be explained by the 

much lower discharge of the Sado River and the greater distance between the river 

mouth and the canyon head. 

Copper on the other hand shows signs of enrichment (EF &gt; 1.5) especially in the 

deeper parts (&gt; 2000 m WD) of both canyons and open slopes. Whereas Pb and Zn 

dispersal thus seem to be largely explained by terrigenous sediment transport from river 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 210 

to canyon, a different mechanism may be involved in the dispersal of Cu. Although the 

significant correlation between Cu and Fe suggests that Cu is partly associated with 

terrigenous sediment, normalisation for Fe reveals another trend of increasing Cu 

enrichment with increasing water depth. Calcium seems to be involved in this other 

mechanism of Cu dispersal, in view of the positive correlation of EF (Cu) with Ca (r2 = 

0.73) in sediment trap samples from deep parts of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon which are 

less affected by resuspention (Figure 7.9). In different marine environments worldwide 

the distribution of Cu has been shown to correlate with major nutrients (Bruland, 1983) 

especially caused by coupled cycling of those nutrients mediated by assimilation and 

recycling by plankton (e.g. Bruland et al., 1991; Löscher, 1999). In agreement with this, 

Caetano &amp;amp; Vale (2003) studying the composition of seston and plankton from the mouth 

of major estuarine systems in Portugal concluded that Cu accumulation in phytoplankton 

is the dominant process determining the distribution of this element in Portuguese coastal 

waters.

Sediment transport along the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

On secular timescale, in the lower Setúbal Canyon, the contribution of excess Pb on 

the total accumulation of Pb (natural and anthropogenic) over the last 150 years is 

conspicuously low, and of the same order as the % Pbxs calculated for equivalent depth 

on the Sines open slope (respectively 6 % and 10 %). This provides further confirmation 

that down-canyon transport of sediments and associated trace metals is not important in 

the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. As observed previously, the most recent event of mass 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 211

transport to the lower canyon, represented by a sandy turbidite layer, dates from before 

the start of the industrial era. In comparison to the low % Pbxs in the lower Setúbal 

Canyon and Sines slope, the 29 % of Pbxs calculated for the lower Cascais Canyon 

appears quite high, and may indicate more efficient transport through the latter canyon, 

or in general a higher fallout of Pb due to greater proximity to land. 

On a decadal timescale, the logarithmic decrease of Pb and Zn EFs and increase of 

EF (Cu) in surface sediments down the course of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon indicate the 

inefficient down-canyon transport of sediments from the upper to the lower canyon. The 

geographic patterns of Cu, Pb and Zn enrichment indicate that most of the particulate 

matter coming from the coastal area and/or adjacent shelf is trapped in the upper 

canyons. In the lower canyon, lower and less variable EFs imply a change in the 

sedimentary setting, with reduced terrigenous input and increasing relative importance of 

pelagic settling as a source of sediments. In agreement, Mn concentrations in surface 

sediments from the canyon and open slope show a slow increase with water depth until 

around 2000 m where a conspicuous increase appears in the surface sediments from the 

canyon (Figure 7.2d). High contents of Mn in surface sediments are related to high 

oxidised states of seabed sediments caused by low sediment accumulation rates and low 

organic matter fluxes (Miller &amp;amp; Orbock, 2007). 

According to the here presented geochemical data, the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon thus 

seems to be characterised by limited down-canyon transport of sediments, and the 

system appears to be rather accumulating sediments and associated trace metals in the 

upper canyon. This is in accordance with data presented in Chapter 6 which show that, 

for this canyon, processes of down-canyon transport are not common on a decadal 

timescale. Down-canyon transport of trace metals to the lower canyon seems certainly 

more effective in the Nazaré Canyon due to its more active mechanisms of down-canyon 

sediment transport by sediment gravity flows (De Stigter et al., 2007b). In fact, the 

enrichment of Pb and Zn in surface sediments from the Nazaré Canyon show a somewhat 

linear down-canyon decrease. This is in accordance with sedimentary material derived 

from the near-shore zone being trapped in the upper canyon and then being effectively 

transported down-canyon with increasing dilution by old sediments with pre-industrial 

trace metal concentrations.

Discharges of contaminated sediments in the Lisbon Canyon 

Recent information from the APL (Administração do Porto de Lisboa – Administration 

of the Harbour of Lisbon) shows that 8000 m3 and 7500 m3 of contaminated sediments 

dredged from the Tagus Estuary were discharged in the Lisbon Canyon in 2005 and 2007, 

respectively (Nemus, 2011). The area used has a radius of 200 m and central point at 

Longitude 09º 19’ W and Latitude 38º 29’ N (ED50) at around 400 m of water depth 

(Figure 6.14). According to the APL this same area has been used by other institutions for 

discharge of sediments (e.g. military institutions which also dredge the estuary). 

Sediments discharged by APL in this area were classified, according to the 

Portuguese law (Portaria nº1450/2007, de 12 de Novembro), as “moderately 

contaminated” (class 3). Table 7.6 shows the range of concentrations for different 

parameters in class 3.

The following is an exercise attempting to compare the input of anthropogenic trace 

metals from these sediment dumpings to the total annual input of anthropogenic trace 

metals in the Lisbon Canyon thalweg. Taking 38 km as the length of the canyon (Lastras 

et al., 2009) and 1 km as maximum width of the thalweg, and average sediment 

accumulation in the thalweg as around 8.75 g m-2 d-1 (Chapter 6, section 6.3, pg. 143) 

with ~35 ug g-1 anthropogenic Pb content (sections 7.2.3 and 7.2.6) yields a deposition of 

4.2 x 106 g of anthropogenic Pb per year. Known discharges of 2005 and 2007, together 

15500 m3 with average dry bulk density of 1000 kg m-3, and considering a class 3 Pb 

contamination of 300 µg g-1 yields a total input of 4.7 x 106 g of dumped Pb. Spread out 

evenly over the Lisbon Canyon thalweg this means that the discharges represent 1.1 

times the present-day annual deposition of anthropogenic Pb in the Lisbon Canyon 

thalweg. That is assuming that the surface enrichment of Pb found in the Lisbon Canyon 

itself is not the result of sediment dumping. 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 213

Concentrations of trace metals found in the Lisbon Canyon at sampling locations 

relatively close to the discharge area (surface sediment and sediment trap samples from 

site 252-34, collected in 2007) only approached class 3 level reported in Table 7.6 for Zn. 

The other analysed trace metals had lower concentrations (Figure 7.3). In addition, 

sediments collected in the same area in 2003 (Costa et al., 2011) had concentrations of 

Pb, Cu, Cr and Ni comparable to those reported in the present study, implying that the 

mentioned discharges did not introduce considerable concentrations of these trace metals 

in the system. Only concentrations of Zn were effectively higher in sediments collected in 

2007 compared to those collected in 2003 for similar water depths (1198 vs. 197 µg g-1, 

respectively). This increase may indeed be related to the discharge of contaminated 

sediments into the Lisbon Canyon between 2005 and 2007. The exercise shown above 

about contributions of Pb in the Lisbon Canyon by the mentioned discharges is most 

certainly an overestimation as surface sediment concentrations of Pb did not increase 

between 2003 and 2007. However, it is possible that other discharges of Pb-contaminated 

sediments had already occurred in the canyon before 2003, before the collection of 

samples analysed by Costa et al. (2011).  

The above exercise, even if very rough, implies that present-day trace metal 

concentrations in surface sediments in the upper Lisbon Canyon may not only originate 

from outflow from the Tagus Estuary and resuspension of sediments from the shelf, but 

may include a considerable contribution from dumping of moderately contaminated 

dredged sediments in the area. This subject certainly needs further investigation as to 

what concerns the type and level of contamination in the discharged sediments and the 

frequency and location of these discharges by other entities than the APL. 

    

7.3.3. Atmospheric lead fallout recorded in Portuguese canyons and 

open slopes  

Marine sediments are assumed to provide good records of atmospheric pollution 

(Miralles et al., 2006). The sampling transects on the Estremadura and Sines open slope 

and sediment traps deployed in the lower reaches of the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon (218-55 and 252-62, respectively, located 104 ± 2 km from the nearest shoreline) 

can be assumed to have only limited influence from rivers. In accordance, surface 

sediments from the open slopes and trap samples from the lower canyon sites show high 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 214 

contents of calcium carbonate (Figure 7.1b). Corg/N ratios for the trap and surface 

sediments are between 6.9 and 8.5 (Chapter 6) which is indicative for organic matter of 

predominantly marine origin. In addition, the 206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio of these traps 

samples falls in the range of that determined for regional surface waters (Richter et al., 

2009). Therefore, one may assume that trace metal fluxes determined from mix samples 

from open slope sediment cores (core interval where 210Pb excess activity was still 

detectable) and from sediment traps, both collected in deep areas where pelagic 

sedimentation dominates, represent mainly atmospheric fluxes of trace metals over the 

last 150 years and at the present-day, respectively. 

Comparison between the open slope transects shows consistently higher contents of 

Pbxs in the Sines transect but no clear patterns for Znxs and Cuxs (Figures 7.6, 7.7, 7.8). 

Sediment cores collected between 2000 and 3000 m WD contain ~12 % higher mean Pbxs 

in the Sines transect (Figure 7.6). The deployments done in the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Nazaré canyons around 4402 and 4975 m WD, respectively, yielded average values of 

excess Pb flux of 0.54 and 0.35 µg cm-2 yr-1, respectively, representing 48 and 36 % of 

the total fluxes of Pb at these sites. Interestingly, the difference in anthropogenic 

contribution between both areas is again 12 %. It seems therefore that atmospheric Pb 

input in both areas was not only different in terms of cumulative flux over the past 150 

years, including the interval when leaded gasoline was in use, but also in terms of 

present-day flux. In fact, after the complete ban on gasoline lead additives (as late as 

1999 in Portugal, Roma-Torres et al., 2007) one may presently notice the influence from 

various industrial activities as sources of Pb, as will be further discussed in the next 

section. 

Our results are consistent with prevailing wind directions and more abundant point 

sources of anthropogenic Pb in the southern part of the study area. Over the second half 

of the last century, input from gasoline lead additives were certainly higher in the 

southern area since it is closer to major cities like Lisbon and Setúbal. In addition, 

atmospheric pollution produced in these cities is unlikely to be transported northwards 

since prevailing regional winds blow from N and NW directions (Freire, 1986; Gomes, 

1992). Even closer to the Sines transect a major industrial agglomeration, which is the 

largest of the entire Iberian Peninsula, is located in the vicinity of Sines. This industrial 

area includes several companies, some operating since the late seventies, which 

represent potential sources of Pb to the environment, namely: Carbogal (produces raw 

material for tyres); Ibera (production of concrete); Kimaxtra (production of cement);

Metalsines (production and handling of metals); Petrogal (oil refinery); Recipneu 

(recycling of tyres) and Repsol polímeros e Repsol (petrochemistry plant). 

The higher level of atmospheric pollution in the Sines area is confirmed by a study of 

biomonitors in northern, central and southern Portuguese cities by Baptista et al. (2008) 

which showed higher accumulations of Pb in biomonitors from Sines.

7.4. Lead stable isotopes (206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb) 

7.4.1. Isotopic evidence for natural and anthropogenic sources of Pb 

 

Estimated isotopic end members 

The entire dataset, obtained for sediment trap and surface sediment samples from 

the central Portuguese margin, predominately suggests binary mixing between one 

component with high [Pb] and low 206Pb/207Pb and a second one with low [Pb] and high 
206Pb/207Pb (Figure 7.10a). These are interpreted to represent anthropogenic pollutant and 

natural sources of lead, respectively. In such a situation, the isotopic composition of the 

pollutant end member can be estimated from the x-axis intercept on a plot vs. the inverse 

of the Pb concentration (Figure 7.10b). This yields 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.143 (1.134 – 

1.149 at 95 % confidence interval) for the entire dataset or 1.150 (1.141 – 1.155) if 

samples from the two deepwater traps are excluded from the regression analysis. 

Conversely, the possible 206Pb/207Pb ratio of the natural end member can be constrained 

from the x-axis intercept on the isotopic ratio vs. concentration plot of 1.232 (1.226 – 

1.240) or 1.228 (1.222 – 1.235). This represents an upper limit, because by definition the 

intercept at 0 µg g-1 Pb extrapolates beyond the isotopic signature of the actual end 

member with an unconstrained but non-zero Pb concentration. 

Lead concentrations display an obvious, albeit slightly scattered, relationship with the 
206Pb/207Pb isotopic ratio (Figure 7.10a). Only one data point from sediment trap site 236-

07 in the upper Nazaré Canyon (1126 m WD) had a distinctly higher Pb concentration 

compared to the remainder of the dataset (169 µg g-1 vs. 24 - 64 µg g-1 for the other 112 

samples) and was omitted for calculation of regression lines. This point could be 

considered as an outlier, although it was replicated by duplicate analysis and this trap site 

was generally characterised by highly variable Pb isotopic ratios and concentrations (cf. 

Figure 7.14b and Figure 7.3a, respectively). 

Further deviations from the overall relationship between Pb concentrations and stable 

isotope ratios are partly systematic; i.e. points from individuals sites fall in distinct parts of 

the diagram. Notably, most trap samples from the lower Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal 

canyons (stations 225-22/4975 m, 218-55/4298 m and 252-62/4402 m WD) plot below 

the overall regression line, i.e. display a relatively low 206Pb/207Pb ratio for a given

concentration. These three trap sites are influenced mostly by pelagic fluxes from the 

overlying water column, with minor, if any, direct down-canyon transport (cf. section 

7.4.3 below); the associated atmospheric lead fallout seems to be characterised by a 

distinct concentration-isotopic signature.

Potential sources of lead in Portuguese canyons 

A three-isotope diagram (206Pb/207Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb) puts isotopic results of the 

present study in context through comparison with potential natural and anthropogenic 

sources (Figure 7.11). As data on Portuguese pollutant lead are unfortunately not 

available, we assume that isotopic signatures from other western European countries are 

broadly representative for the area of the present study. Cumulatively, the well-defined 

overall linear regression through most data points indicates that binary mixing between 

two end members as outlined above can explain most of the Pb isotopic variability 

observed in the present study. End members might obviously be “mixed”, themselves 

reflecting mixing of several sources, or slightly variable along the canyon axes (cf. above) 

or between sediment trap and core top samples (see below). More complex scenarios 

with additional “intermediate” sources along the mixing line also cannot be ruled out.

The estimated 206Pb/207Pb ratio of the anthropogenic end member in canyon 

sediments and particulate material collected in sediment traps (~1.14 – 1.15, cf. above) 

most closely corresponds to fly ashes from waste incinerators. Their Pb isotopic 

composition represents an average signature of industrial lead, as it is derived from 

mixing and burning of a wide range of Pb-containing products (Monna et al., 1997). It is 

remarkably constant both for different European locations and different sampling sites 

(Döring et al., 1997; Monna et al., 1997; Deboudt et al., 1999; Hansmann &amp;amp; Köppel, 

2000) and also close to the average Pb isotopic ratio of all main worldwide Pb ores 

(Sangster et al., 2000).

natural end members in Portuguese canyons (see Figure 7.10 and text); the anthropogenic end member 
corresponds most closely to fly ashes from individual waste incinerators (blue triangles). Data sources: Broken 
Hill ore (Sangster et al., 2000), European leaded petrol (Monna et al., 1997; Hansmann &amp;amp; Köppel, 2000), 
Spanish aerosols (Bollhöfer &amp;amp; Rosman, 2001), Incinerator fly ashes (Döring et al., 1997; Monna et al., 1997; 
Deboudt et al., 1999; Hansmann &amp;amp; Köppel, 2000), S Iberian pyrite belt (Santos Zalduegui et al., 2004 
[average values for four sample populations]), other Spanish ores (Sangster et al., 2000), Saharan dust 
(Grousset et al., 1994, 1995; Abouchami &amp;amp; Zabel, 2003), Upper continental crust (Millot et al., 2004). 

 

In Portugal, leaded gasoline was gradually phased out in the early 1990s but 

completely eliminated only in 1999 (Roma-Torres et al., 2007). Some surface sediment 

samples of the present study integrate Pb input over the last ~10 years (prior to sampling 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 219

in 2002-2007); their Pb isotopic ratios may thus still be affected by this time-transient 

change in pollutant sources (cf. Grousset et al., 1994). Available data (Monna et al., 1997; 

Hansmann &amp;amp; Köppel, 2000) indicate that western European leaded gasoline has 

comparatively unradiogenic (not produced by radioactive decay) Pb isotopic signatures, 

reflecting mixing between Australian Broken Hill ore (Sangster et al., 2000) and other Pb 

ores for production of gasoline lead additives. Considering the 95 % confidence interval 

for 206Pb/207Pb of the pollutant end members, some ongoing contribution from this source 

cannot be ruled out. Yet its current influence appears at most minor, and considerably 

reduced with respect to the late 20th century Spanish urban aerosols (Bollhöfer &amp;amp; Rosman, 

2001). 

Four samples from the lower part of Lisbon Canyon piston-core 204-31 (142 – 

172 cm core depth) have more radiogenic lead isotopic signatures than all present-day 

samples and Pb concentrations of 14.3 ± 1.4 µg g-1, which falls in the range of average 

continental crust (12 – 17 µg g-1, Wedepohl, 1995). Planktonic foraminifera from an 

overlying sample (134 cm) were AMS 14C-dated to 1410 ± 50 yrs., corresponding to 

~1000 AD on a calendar age scale. Several previous studies provided evidence for 

continuous input of anthropogenic Pb since Greek and Roman times, after ~2000 BC (e.g. 

Shotyk et al., 1998; Kylander et al., 2005). However, after the decline of the Roman 

Empire, anthropogenic Pb was strongly reduced at the end of the first millennium AD. 

Thus, the lead isotopic composition of coeval samples from Portuguese canyons will 

provide another estimate for the natural unpolluted end member, conceivably a lower 

limit for 206Pb/207Pb if they include some anthropogenic Pb. These values (206Pb/207Pb = 

1.2050 ± 0.002, 208Pb/206Pb = 2.0546 ± 0.003) are close to the most recent global mean 

estimate (Millot et al., 2004) for weathering products of the upper continental crust 

(206Pb/207Pb = 1.2050, 208Pb/206Pb = 2.0618). 

The Pb isotopic composition of Saharan dust (Grousset et al., 1994, 1995; Abouchami 

&amp;amp; Zabel, 2003) and south Iberian pyrite belt ores (Sangster et al., 2000; Santos Zalduegui 

et al., 2004) falls above the general regression line shown in Figure 7.11. Accordingly, 

these sources are at most of minor importance for most of the Portuguese canyon 

samples.

7.4.2. Comparison of Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyon sediments 

 

Lead isotope variability along and between canyons 

To elucidate differences in natural and anthropogenic lead along the canyon axes 

and between the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyon systems, the 206Pb/207Pb ratio in 

surface sediments is plotted against water depth in Figure 7.12. 

Three trends are obvious from the figure:  

First, samples from the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon display consistently lower 206Pb/207Pb 

ratios than Nazaré Canyon samples, with hardly any overlap in isotopic ratios between the 

two areas. This indicates stronger anthropogenic influence in the southern study area; the 

single exception from this pattern is discussed below.  

Second, along both canyon axes the 206Pb/207Pb ratio generally increases with 

increasing water depth, implying a decreasing anthropogenic lead input from the canyon 

heads, closest to potential source areas, to more offshore areas.  

Third, samples from the shelf and slope adjacent to the canyons commonly exhibit 

higher isotopic ratios than samples from the canyon axes. Yet, in both study areas mean 

isotopic values of canyon vs. shelf/slope sediments slightly overlap within one standard 

deviation, essentially because divergences from the general pattern occur at intermediate 

water depths (see below).

 221

Divergent patterns between canyons and adjacent open shelf and slope are most 

obvious at shallow water depth (&amp;lt;400 m): sediments from the Lisbon, Setúbal and 

Nazaré canyon heads (stations 204-18, 225-01 and 225-41) show by far the lowest 

isotope ratios for the respective areas, whereas distinctly higher ratios occur at 

comparable water depth outside of the canyons (stations 218-57 and 225-02). 

Interestingly, isotope ratios at station 225-02 are much higher than anywhere else in the 

southern study area; this single location displays values comparable to and even towards 

the upper limit of those measured in the Nazaré Canyon area. One may infer that the 

sediment collected at this upper slope location is of an older age, and that recent 

sedimentation is largely bypassing this site (Figure 3.2). 

In contrast to the apparent weak anthropogenic influence detected in these upper 

slope samples, a relatively stronger influence was detected in some of the open slope 

stations at intermediate water depth (1300 – 2500 m), which have isotope ratios 

comparable to those observed inside the canyons. This possibly implies that material 

initially trapped inside the canyon spills over and escapes to the adjacent slope at 

intermediate water depths, as previously suggested for the eastern U.S. continental shelf 

and slope (Biscaye &amp;amp; Anderson, 1994) and northwestern Mediterranean continental 

margin (Puig &amp;amp; Palanques, 1998a). 

At water depths &gt; 4500 m in the Nazaré study area, 206Pb/207Pb ratios in surface 

sediments of the slope are also comparable to those of the Nazaré Canyon thalweg. 

However, as further discussed below in section 7.4.3, different processes may be 

responsible for the relatively minor influence of pollutant lead at both stations. 

 

Quantifying natural and anthropogenic Pb 

As discussed above, Pb isotopic ratios of samples from the central Portuguese 

margin, specifically their position along the mixing line in Figure 7.11, reflect the relative 

importance of natural vs. anthropogenic sources of lead. Assuming binary mixing between 

natural and anthropogenic end members of known and spatially constant lead isotopic 

composition, the percentage of anthropogenic lead (PbA) with respect to total Pb can be 

calculated from the following formula:

?

== *100*100%  



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central

 222 

In the right part of the formula, R represents the ratio 206Pb/207Pb; subscripts A and N 

refer to the derived anthropogenic and natural end members, and subscript S to 

measured values of a given samples. Multiplying measured (bulk) Pb concentrations with 

the relative proportion of PbA yields estimates for the concentration of anthropogenic Pb 

in sediment samples. 

The regression in Figure 7.10b yields a 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.143 (1.134 – 1.149, 

95 % confidence interval) for the anthropogenic end member (see section 7.4.1). Two 

values are proposed for the natural end member: end member N1 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.2050 

± 0.002) is based on the composition of sediments samples from piston core 204-31 

dated as older than 1000 AD, whereas end member N2 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.232 [1.226 – 

1.240, 95 % confidence interval]) is derived from the x-axis intercept in Figure 7.10a. As 

discussed above, these represent lower and upper limits for the natural isotopic signature. 

Consequently, subsequent calculations using either of the two natural end members yield 

lower and upper limits for anthropogenic Pb, presumably bracketing its “true” contribution 

to canyon sediments. Based on natural end member N1, about 20 % (range 10 – 30 %) 

of total lead is of anthropogenic origin in the Nazaré Canyon, vs. 35 % (25 – 45 %) in the 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and the Cascais Canyon. Using end member N2 results in values 

of 45 % (37 – 52 %) and 55 % (48 – 63 %) for the two canyon systems, respectively. 

Uncertainties in these calculations dominantly relate to the possible isotopic range of 

natural and anthropogenic end members and presumably affect all samples equally. In 

absolute terms, they amount to 8 % or less (95 % confidence interval, e.g. 25 ± 8 % 

anthropogenic Pb). The influence of analytical uncertainties is variable and generally 

smaller (± 2.4 % on average) than the above-mentioned end member uncertainty. 

Differences between both study areas are robust, except for the unlikely case of distinctly 

different natural and/or anthropogenic end members for the Nazaré vs. Lisbon-Setúbal + 

Cascais canyon systems. 

Inferred concentrations of natural Pb are relatively constant across the entire study 

area (19 ± 2.6 µg g-1 or 27 ± 3.5 µg g-1 using end members N1 and N2, respectively, n = 

32). In both cases, natural Pb concentrations are slightly elevated compared to average 

upper continental crust (cf. above), which may reflect preferential incorporation of Pb into 

the fine fraction of marine sediments. 

Differences in total (bulk) Pb concentrations thus essentially reflect variable input of 

anthropogenic Pb (Figure 7.13), superimposed on a nearly constant background of natural 

Pb. Spatial variability of anthropogenic Pb retains patterns described above, i.e. higher

 223

concentrations in the Lisbon-Setúbal compared to the Nazaré Canyon and, for both 

canyon systems, generally higher concentrations within canyons compared to the 

adjacent shelf and slope. There is also a general decrease of anthropogenic Pb with 

increasing water depth. In Figure 7.13 data from the Cascais Canyon and open slope 

transects are also presented. The Cascais Canyon has slightly higher concentrations of 

anthropogenic Pb than the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon for equivalent water depths. For the 

open slope transects, concentrations seem to be similar to those found on the walls and 

edges of the canyons at equivalent water depths.

member 1 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.205), c, d) natural end member 2 (206Pb/207Pb = 1.232). 

 

In summary, both Pb isotopic ratios and derived concentrations of anthropogenic 

lead indicate stronger anthropogenic influence in the southern study area. This is 

consistent with sediment supply by major rivers, potentially carrying pollutant material, 

and with proximity of the southern area to heavily populated and industrialised areas. In 

particular, the Tagus River was previously identified as a major source of other pollutants 

metals including Hg, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn (Figueres et al., 1985; Cotté-Krief et al., 2000).

7.4.3. Link with sediment transport processes (sediment trap vs. core 

top sediments) 

Core top samples discussed above yield an integrated signal over annual to decadal 

timescales, whereas particulate material from sediment traps correspond to sampling 

intervals of one day in the upper canyon up to two to four weeks in the middle to lower 

canyon. Comparison of the two sample sets of the present study may yield clues on short-

term depositional processes and their influence on the “final” sedimentary signal. 

In most of the deployments done in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and in the middle 

Nazaré Canyon, 206Pb/207Pb ratios for particulate material from individual sediment trap 

deployments commonly span relatively narrow ranges and are comparable to values 

observed in surface sediments at similar water depths (Figure 7.14). Hence, sediment 

trap data collected in these areas accurately reflect longer-term depositional conditions; 

the cases where this pattern was not found are discussed below. 

For sediment trap samples from the Nazaré Canyon, Richter et al. (2009) noticed a 

conspicuous decrease of 206Pb/207Pb ratios with decreasing mass deposition flux (Figure 

7.15b). This trend was shown by four of the five trap deployments; only the samples of 

deployment 236-07 showed a deviating pattern. Apparently, samples with highest mass 

flux, generally occurring in the upper reaches of the canyon, had the lowest relative 

contribution of anthropogenic Pb, whereas samples with lowest mass fluxes, occurring in 

the lower reaches of the canyon, showed the highest relative contribution of 

anthropogenic Pb. Intuitively, however, one would expect the opposite, with samples 

from the upper canyon, being nearer to source areas of anthropogenic lead on land, to 

have the highest relative contribution of anthropogenic lead. Richter et al. (2009) 

interpreted the lower anthropogenic contribution in the upper canyon samples as 

reflecting dilution of recent particulate material with reworked pre-industrial sediment, 

under influence of the vigorous tidal currents. Further down the canyon, where tidal 

currents are reduced in strength, the effect of dilution with reworked older sediments 

would become less pronounced. 

Sediment trap samples from the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon display a different 

relationship between mass flux and 206Pb/207Pb (Figure 7.15a). Excluding the samples 

from the lower Setúbal Canyon (252-62), there seems to be an opposite trend as 

observed for the Nazaré Canyon. Especially in the Lisbon Canyon  206Pb/207Pb ratios seem 

to increase with decreasing mass flux and increasing depth down-canyon, implying that 



7. Trace metals in surface sediments and suspended particulate material from the central 
Portuguese continental margin 

 225

particulate matter settling in the deeper areas of the canyon contains a relatively lower 

contribution of anthropogenic Pb, which is in agreement with the expected decrease in 

input of terrigenous material with increasing depth down-canyon.

Pelagic fluxes and gravity flows in the lower canyons 

Pronounced differences in 206Pb/207Pb ratios in surface sediments and sediment trap 

particulate material are observed at water depths &gt; 4000 m in both the Lisbon-Setúbal 

and Nazaré canyons (Figure 7.14). 206Pb/207Pb ratios for the deepest traps in both canyons 

(stations 252-62 and 225-22, respectively) showing a relatively wide range of values, are 

distinctly lower than ratios in surface sediments from equivalent water depths. Low mass 

fluxes at these sites (0.37 – 1.38 g m-2 d-1 and 0.09 – 0.23 g m-2 d-1 in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

and Nazaré canyons, respectively, represent pelagic settling from the overlying water 

column. This is supported by closely similar ranges of 206Pb/207Pb ratios in trap particulate 

material and in late 20th century regional surface waters – the latter ranging between 

1.1670 and 1.1850 (Véron et al., 1994; Weiss et al., 2003). The different isotopic 

signature of pelagic material settling in the lower Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré Canyon, 

compared to material collected in sediment traps further up-canyon and accumulated in 

surface sediments, is also expressed in a different relationship between isotopic ratio and 

Pb concentration as illustrated in Figure 7.10. Largely unaffected by contributions of older 

sediment resuspended from the seabed, this pelagic material likely represents the most 

undiluted form of recent Pb input to the open ocean environment.

Lisbon and Setúbal Canyon, respectively. Note inversed logarithmic x-axis for comparison with previous plots 
with water depth on x-axis (mass fluxes generally decrease with increasing water depth). 

 

Surface sediment samples from comparable water depths in the lower Setúbal and 

Nazaré Canyon and adjacent canyon edge (respectively, 225-07, 225-22 and 225-25) 

display distinctly higher 206Pb/207Pb ratios implying lower relative contributions of pollutant 

lead. For the two sites in the canyon axis, the relatively lower contribution of 

anthropogenic lead may be attributed to lateral supply of reworked older sediments. This 

seems to be confirmed by observed higher lithogenic content of canyon axis sediments, 

compared to the material collected in sediment traps (Chapter 6). For station 225-25 

located on the southern edge of the Nazaré Canyon, however, lateral supply of reworked 

sediment can be assumed to be negligible. High carbonate content observed at this 

location (45 % compared to 22 % inside the canyon; see below Figure 7.17b) also implies 

that sediments are derived from vertical settling through the overlying water column 

rather than lateral advection of resuspended canyon sediment rich in lithogenic material.   

Low sediment accumulation rate of 0.1 g m-2 d-1, derived from planktonic foraminiferal 

biostratigraphy in a piston core from the same location (De Stigter et al., 2007b), which is 

similar to mass deposition flux measured in the deepest sediment trap deployment in the 

lower Nazaré Canyon, implies that the sediment layer representing the last 150 years of 

industrial development can only be a few mm thick which makes reworking of pre-

industrial sediment by recent bioturbation very likely. Hence, the relatively high 
206Pb/207Pb in open slope surface sediment may be attributed to biological mixing with 

underlying unpolluted sediments. 

In the canyon thalweg, the long-term accumulation rate of 0.8 g m-2 d-1 in sediment 

core 225-22 (De Stigter et al., 2007b) is almost one order of magnitude higher than mass 

fluxes observed in the trap at the same location. It seems therefore that the surface 

sediment represents not only material derived from pelagic settling, but in addition

 227

material supplied by intermittent sediment gravity flows. A sediment gravity flow event 

was recorded at the shallower trap site 218-55 (4298 m WD); the corresponding sample 

showed a markedly higher mass flux than all other samples from the same deployment 

(46 g m-2 d-1 vs. 0.5 – 2.7 g m-2 d-1). Compared to other samples collected by the same 

trap, material delivered during this sedimentation event was distinctly coarser-grained and 

displayed lower carbonate content. In this respect, it resembles particulate matter 

collected by upper and middle canyon traps, strongly suggesting down-canyon transport 

rather than local slumping from canyon walls (for more information cf. De Stigter et al., 

2007b). 

The 206Pb/207Pb ratio for the sediment trap sample corresponding to the sediment 

gravity flow event is closely similar to the Pb isotopic ratio of surface sediments in the 

lower Nazaré Canyon. It seems therefore that episodic sediment gravity flows dominate 

the integrated sedimentary signal in the lower canyon. It is worth noting that 206Pb/207Pb 

ratio of the trap sample corresponding to the gravity flow event is higher than all samples 

from shallower sites, which is arguably inconsistent with preferential down-canyon 

transport of pollutant lead. Presumably, the gravity flow deposit also incorporates older 

pre-industrial sediments, masking the isotopic signature of pollutant lead. 

The long-term sediment accumulation rate of 0.8 g m-2 d-1 recorded in the lower 

Setúbal Canyon (core 225-07, 4451 m WD) is comparable to mass fluxes observed in the 

trap at the same location (0.4 – 1.4 g m-2 d-1 - Chapter 6 on pg. 150) confirms that 

sediment gravity flows do not significantly contribute to recent sedimentation. The 

distinctly higher 206Pb/207Pb ratio in surface sediments compared to trap samples must 

therefore be explained as a result of biological mixing with underlying unpolluted 

sediments.

8.1. Major pathways of recent terrigenous sediment transport on the 

central Portuguese margin 

On the central Portuguese margin three major submarine canyons connect the 

continental shelf with the abyssal plain: the Lisbon-Setúbal, Cascais and Nazaré canyons. 

Despite their geographic proximity, the composition of surface sediments from the 

canyons reflects different activity of these canyons in channelling sediments to their lower 

reaches and finally to the abyssal plain. The shelf and slope in between and neighbouring 

these submarine canyons also show differences in composition of surface sediments 

giving evidence of different processes driving sediment transport and deposition. 

On the Sines margin lithogenic contents are high (70-75 %), considering that no 

major watercourse is discharging on this area. These high contents of lithogenic material 

are probably related to the progressive deposition of suspended fine-grained terrigenous 

material entrained by the flow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water along the upper 

continental slope (Grousset et al., 1988). Northwards from the Sines margin and after 

interacting with the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon a considerable portion of the lower-core water 

flows into the interior of the ocean (Bower et al., 2002) and therefore the contribution of 

terrigenous material from this water mass to the seabed is much reduced on the 

Estremadura margin and further north (Figure 8.1). 

Compared to the Sines margin, the middle and lower Setúbal Canyon has only 

slightly higher lithogenic content (72-77 %), suggesting that it is mostly accumulating 

sediment from the same source as is supplying sediment to the Sines slope, with minor 

addition of lithogenic material through the Lisbon Canyon and perhaps even less through 

the upper Setúbal Canyon. In comparison to the open slope, the Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Cascais canyons act as natural traps of organic material, specially the upper regions. 

Contents of organic matter above 3 % are only found in the upper canyon branches and 

according to García et al. (2010) only in these shallower areas a considerable portion of 

this organic matter is bioavailable. The mechanisms driving sediment dynamics in this 

canyon system will be further discussed in section 8.3.  

The Estremadura slope has relatively low lithogenic contents (39-67 %), suggesting 

bypassing of terrigenous sediment entering via the shelf and through the Cascais and 



8. Final considerations 

 232 

Nazaré canyons. Terrigenous input to this part of the margin is low for what concerns the 

shelf as testified by the extensive areas of rock outcrops which appear from below a 

discontinous and relatively thin Holocene sediment cover (Badagola et al., 2006). The 

Estremadura margin is, however, an area marked by important events of upwelling 

(Salgueiro et al., 2008) which favour biological productivity in surface water, which in turn 

leads to deposition of carbonate-rich pelagic sediments. 

The Nazaré Canyon is characterised by efficient down-canyon sediment transport and 

therefore contents of lithogenic material in surface sediments are higher than 80 % 

throughout the canyon, even in the lower canyon. Contents of organic matter are also 

high within the canyon, never decreasing below 3 %. However, according to García et al. 

(2007) most of this organic material is relatively degraded and of little use for living 

organisms. Especially in the lower canyon only a minor fraction is of biological interest. It 

is likely that most of the labile material is degraded on the way down. According to De 

Stigter et al. (2007b), particulate matter is mainly transported by tidal currents until the 

middle canyon and then by intermittent gravity flows further down to the lower canyon 

and to the abyssal plain. All together, it may take more than a year for particulate matter 

to travel from the canyon head to the mouth. Whereas the bulk of terrigenous sediments 

will not be much altered on such timescale and will eventually arrive at the abyssal plain, 

degradable organic material may never come that far. 

The slope off Mondego shows variable contents of lithogenic material (49-80 %). 

Most of the slope area below 1000 m WD is characterised by a reduced supply of 

terrigenous sediment and predominance of pelagic sediment supply. The upper slope 

seems to receive a relatively abundant supply of fresh terrigenous sediment, 

characterised by high contents of feldspars, coming from the nearby Mondego River or 

possibly other rivers debouching north from this area (Douro, Minho, Cávado, Lima). Most 

of this terrigenous material seems not to spread to the slope area below 1000 m WD, 

probably as a result of blocking by slope currents. 

Overall, just by considering the distribution of terrigenous material it becomes 

evident that sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by the 

submarine canyons. As already suggested by other authors (e.g. Van Weering et al., 

2002; Oliveira et al., 2007), export of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental 

margin is restricted by slope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-

slope transport. Partitioning of sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin 



8. Final considerations 

 233

may to some extent also be attributed to modifications of along-slope circulation where 

submarine canyons cross the path of slope currents. 

  

8.2. Pathways of recent terrigenous sediment transport in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon and adjacent continental shelf and slope 

8.2.1. Continental shelf and sediment sources from the hinterland 

The sedimentary deposits on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf range from coarse sand 

with less than 10 % of fine-grained material (&amp;lt;63 µm) to mud deposits with more than 

90 % of fine-grained material. On the Setúbal-Sines shelf, sandy deposits prevail and 

muddy sediments are restricted to the northern coast of the Setúbal bay near the 

entrance of the Sado Estuary and to the upper reaches of the Setúbal Canyon. On the 

other hand, the Lisbon shelf is covered by a large expanse of mud deposit which occupies 

almost the entire shelf area, and which is largely fed by sediment supplied by the Tagus 

River. 

Since at the present sea-level stand most of the sediment added to the shelf by 

continental runoff consists of fine-grained material (e.g. Ferreira et al., 2008), one may 

deduce from the location of the fine-grained sediment deposits where on the shelf the 

main foci of recent sediment deposition are located. The mineralogical data presented in 

Chapter 4, specifically with regard to contents of plagioclase and kaolinite, and the 

crystallinity index of illite show that indeed sediments from the Tagus and Sado mud 

patches are fresher in a mineralogical sense than the fine fractions contained in coarser 

sediment deposits. According to Jouanneau et al. (1998) the surface nepheloid layers 

associated with the Tagus and Sado river discharge do not extend far onto the shelf, 

implying that most of the fine-grained riverine sediment input settles on the shelf and 

accumulates in the mud patches close to the river mouths. The distribution of plagioclase 

in shelf sediments, as a tracer of relatively unaltered riverine sediment input, and 

enrichment of trace metals (especially Zn and Cu) associated with industrial activities on 

land, point to the Tagus and Sado rivers as the main contributors of fine-grained 

sediments to the Tagus and Sado mud patches (Figure 8.1).  

In the case of the Tagus mud patch, the erosion of sea-cliffs from the adjacent 

coastal arc between the Fonte da Telha beach and Cape Espichel seems to be an 



8. Final considerations 

 234 

important additional source of fine-grained sediments. As described in Chapter 4, detritus 

produced by sea-cliff erosion first nourishes the adjacent beach system and then reaches 

the adjacent shelf after high-energy storms. Contributions of sediments from the Albufeira 

Lagoon to the shelf certainly exist, but the mineralogical and geochemical signatures of 

the lagoon were not assessed and surface sediments from the shelf did not show a 

distinct signature which could be related to contributions from the lagoon. 

Contributions from sea-cliffs and coastal lagoons are more easily tracked in the Tróia-

Sines coastal arc since terrigenous sediment contributions from other sources are less 

important here and therefore dilution effects are less strong. Sea-cliffs in this coastal 

stretch are an important source of sediments to the beach system (e.g. Quevauviller, 

1987; Freitas et al., 1999) and subsequently to the adjacent shelf after storm waves wash 

the sediment offshore (Figure 8.1). Fine-grained sediment adsorbed to the beach sands is 

transported southward as sediment is carried along with the longshore drift. On the inner 

shelf adjacent to the sea-cliffs the proportion of lithogenic minerals to carbonates is 

markedly enhanced. This ratio reaches the highest values on the inner shelf close to the 

St. André and Melides lagoons. During the few weeks of the year that these lagoons are 

artificially opened to the sea, sediments are exported offshore, imprinting their 

mineralogical and geochemical signatures in the sedimentary deposits of the inner shelf 

(Chapters 4 and 5). Contributions of detritus resulting from the erosion of the Sines sub-

volcanic massif to shelf deposits north of Cape Sines appear to be limited, which is 

explained by the prevailing southward transport along the coastal arc. Substantial 

northward longshore drift occurs only during infrequent southwesterly storms, which 

typically blow no more than 2 days per year (Quevauviller, 1988). 

 

8.2.2. Continental shelf and adjacent slope 

In the present study the Sines continental margin is well represented by surface 

sediment samples collected from water depths between 15 and 4000 m. The 

mineralogical and geochemical data presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 show that on the 

Sines margin four different bathymetric zones can be distinguished: inner + middle shelf 

(&amp;lt;100 m WD); outer shelf + upper slope (100 – 500 m WD); upper slope between 500 

and 2000 m WD and middle to lower slope below 2000 m WD. 



8. Final considerations 

 235

The Sines inner+middle shelf is characterised by the highest contents of terrigenous 

minerals, reflected by L/C ratios &gt; 2.0. Despite the vigorous hydrodynamics of this area, 

contents of phyllosilicates and plagioclase may reach high values of 27 and 25 %, 

respectively, especially close to the source areas of these minerals: sea-cliffs and coastal 

lagoons, respectively. 

On the outer shelf/upper slope reworked shelf sediments predominate, and fresh 

input of terrigenous material from the hinterland is lower compared to the inner+middle 

shelf. This is reflected by lower contents of plagioclase and phyllosilicates in the fine 

sediment fraction, 4 - 7 % and 9 - 17 %, respectively, whereas calcite contents reach the 

highest values of &gt; 50 % and L/C ratios are generally below 1.5. 

The upper slope between 500 and 2000 m WD seems to represent a transition zone 

where terrigenous input increases again (1.5 &amp;lt;L/C &amp;lt;2.0). As discussed in Chapter 6 

(section 6.7.3, pg. 182), modal grain size as well as carbonate content of surface 

sediments decrease from 500 to 1500-2000 m WD. The present study, as well as some 

previous studies (e.g. Schönfeld, 1997), show that fine-grained sediments are removed by 

winnowing from the shallower part of the upper slope which is under the influence of the 

upper Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), and are deposited near the lower MOW limit 

together with suspended material entrained by the MOW from the Alboran Sea (Figure 

8.1). Material from the latter source is characterised by relatively high contents of 

smectite and degraded kaolinite. 

On the middle and lower slope, below 2000 m WD, surface sediments have modal 

grain sizes typical for hemipelagic sedimentation (&amp;lt;8 µm). In this same depth zone, 

contents of phyllosilicates in the fine sediment fraction increase to 38 %. Part of the 

sediments settling in this area may well derive from the MOW, as implied by the relatively 

high contents of kaolinite and smectite in sediments found even as deep as 3900 m WD. 

As observed in the south-western part of the Gulf of Cadiz, input from the MOW may be 

found in areas where the MOW flows detached from the seafloor, as the particles settle 

out from the MOW and accumulate as hemipelagites on the seabed (Bower et al., 2002). 

 

 

 



8. Final considerations 

 236 

8.2.3. The Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons and adjacent shelf 

 

Present-day activity of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons 

The widespread occurrence of bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers in the upper 

reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais Canyon and high sediment fluxes recorded in 

sediment traps and in seabed deposits, are clear evidence of the dynamic sedimentary 

environment present within these canyons. SPM concentrations (De Stigter et al., in 

press) and sediment accumulation rates in the upper canyons are an order of magnitude 

higher than the ones measured at comparable depths on adjacent slope areas, and values 

reported from other parts of the western Iberian margin (Faugères et al., 1984; McCave &amp;amp; 

Hall, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Van Weering et al., 2002). The active sedimentary 

regime of the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon is undoubtedly related in the first place to its 

position, deeply entrenched in the continental shelf with the two canyon heads in the 

proximity of the coast, and thus forming a natural trap for sediments carried along by 

shelf currents. Shallow intermediate nepheloid layers observed in the upper canyon at 

depths corresponding to that of the adjacent shelf, are indications that suspended 

sediment enters the canyon via bottom nepheloid layers detached from the shelf edge 

(De Stigter et al., in press). When crossing the canyon, the nepheloid layers will lose part 

of their suspended sediment load by settling. Resuspension of shelf sediments is likely to 

occur under influence of storm waves, particularly those incident from southwesterly 

direction (Figure 8.1). The Lisbon and Setúbal shelves are sheltered from northwesterly 

storms by the prominent Cape Roca and Cape Espichel, respectively. Internal tidal waves 

generated on the edges of the canyon and propagating over the adjacent shelf may be an 

additional mechanism resuspending shelf sediments around the canyon, analogous to 

what has been observed for the Nazaré Canyon area (Quaresma et al., 2007). Direct 

sediment input from the Tagus and Sado river plumes is probably limited, as indicated by 

previous observations by Jouanneau et al. (1998). These authors observed that surface 

nepheloid layers issuing from the river mouths do not extend far onto the shelf but are 

predominantly deflected to the west following the coast. Sediment transport from the 

rivers to the canyons appears to be mostly indirectly via bottom nepheloid layers formed 

by resuspension of prodelta deposits (Tagus and Sado mud patches). However, the 

dispersal of suspended particulate matter over the shelf off the Tagus and Sado estuaries 

is still basically unknown for typical winter conditions since the study done by Jouanneau 



8. Final considerations 

 237

et al. (1998) refer to particularly dry years (1993-1995), during which the strong increase 

in water discharge normally observed during winter did not occur. Trapped in the upper 

canyon, fine-grained sediments are subject to frequent resuspension and transport by the 

internal tide, as inferred from relatively high loads of SPM in bottom and intermediate 

waters. A depocentre of fine-grained sediments was identified in both the Lisbon and 

upper Setúbal canyon branches between 1100 and 1400 m WD (Figure 8.1). These 

sediment depocentres are marked by a maximum in SAR values in this depth interval and 

by high contents of organic matter in the surface sediment. Discharge of dredged 

estuarine sediments in the Lisbon Canyon has been confirmed to have occurred in 2005 

and 2007 and may help to explain surface sediments characteristics in the upper reaches 

of the canyon, namely, the high contents of organic and lithogenic contents.  

Much lower SPM concentrations (De Stigter et al., in press) and sediment 

accumulation rates observed in the middle and lower canyon, comparable to those of the 

adjacent open slope, suggest that this part of the canyon has a much less active 

sedimentary regime than the upper canyon, and does not receive major input of sediment 

from either the upper canyon or from the adjacent open slope, besides the background 

pelagic input. Lack of down-canyon sediment transport seems to be confirmed by trends 

in particle size and bulk composition of surface sediments of the canyon and adjacent 

slope. A clear enrichment of lithogenic material, on the order of ~10 % above the 

background lithogenic content found further down-canyon and on the adjacent slope, was 

only observed in the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais Canyon. A general lack of 

down-canyon sediment transport was confirmed also by the seaward logarithmic decrease 

of Pb and Zn enrichment. Both elements are mainly associated with terrigenous sediment 

input to this area (Chapter 7). 

This is clearly different from the pattern observed in the Nazaré Canyon, where 

sediment with strong predominance of lithogenic material is observed all along the axis of 

the canyon, contrasting with finer-grained sediment with lower lithogenic content on the 

adjacent slope. 

 

Sediment transport by the internal tide 

The close match between semi-diurnal peaks in current speed and peaks in bottom 

water turbidity, as recorded in the upper Lisbon and Setúbal canyon by the BOBO landers, 

demonstrate the prominent role of tidal currents in resuspending and transporting fine-

grained sediments. The BOBO lander records consistently show resuspension occurring 



8. Final considerations 

 238 

when currents exceed a threshold of 15-25 cm s-1. Critical erosion velocity u* for 

resuspending particles from the seabed, determined experimentally for surface sediments 

from the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, are reported by García et al. (2010). The experimentally 

determined threshold values from the latter authors are in agreement with those derived 

from the BOBO lander records. 

Internal tides, such as observed in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, are clearly an 

important mechanism of sediment transport in many submarine canyons (Shepard et al., 

1979; Gardner, 1989; Petruncio et al., 1998; Durrieu de Madron et al., 1999), 

resuspending sediments especially in narrow upper canyon sections where tidal energy is 

focused, and driving the flow of sediment-laden waters up and down the canyon axis. A 

particular characteristic of tidal currents in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon is the prevalence of 

net up-canyon directed flow, observed in four of the seven sites where currents were 

recorded. Since the strongest currents in all these cases were also directed up-canyon, it 

can be assumed that the prevalent direction of suspended sediment transport was up-

canyon as well. This is in apparent contrast with the Nazaré Canyon, where a net down-

canyon water and sediment transport was observed in a similar observational setup (De 

Stigter et al., 2007b). As a cautionary remark it must be added here that some of the 

records obtained from the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon were only of short duration of 3-

7 days, and thus are not necessarily representative for the longer term current regime. In 

the Nazaré Canyon, reversals in net flow direction were observed in the canyon down to 

depths of 300 m, in response to changes in wind direction and shelf circulation (Tyler et 

al., 2009). Currents in the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon may in a similar manner be 

coupled to variable surface water circulation. 

In the upper canyons mass deposition fluxes estimated using sediment traps are 

consistently higher than SARs determined in the seabed through 210Pb profiles in sediment 

cores. This indicates resuspension of seabed sediments, most certainly as a reflection of 

strong near-bottom current dynamics, and oversampling in the trap after repeated cycles 

of resuspension and deposition.  

Low values of bottom water turbidity observed in BOBO lander deployments in the 

middle and lower canyon, combined with the observation that mass deposition fluxes 

measured in sediment traps and seabed SARs are well comparable, indicate that sediment 

resuspension from the seabed is not as important as in the upper reaches of the canyon, 

and that sedimentation prevails. This seems in agreement with the overall slower bottom 

currents and relatively infrequent resuspension recorded in the middle part of the canyon, 



8. Final considerations 

 239

but the combination of intermittent high current speeds in the lower canyon with low 

turbidity and low deposition flux is puzzling. Possibly the sediment in the lower canyon is 

locally more cohesive or coarser grained, although this is not evident from the one core 

which was collected from that area.  

  

Sediment transport by sediment gravity flows 

Low frequency and high-energy processes like gravity flows are processes capable of 

transporting considerable amounts of sediment further down-canyon. Presently, they 

seem however very rare in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. During the total time of five years 

and six months of BOBO deployments (2002 - 2007) no gravity flows were recorded in 

the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon while for a similar period of time in the Nazaré Canyon at least 

three important mass flux events were recorded (De Stigter et al., 2007b). These mass 

sediment transport processes seem to be also common in other active canyons systems 

like the Monterey Canyon (Xu et al., 2002), the Congo Canyon (Khripounoff et al., 2003) 

and the Palamós Canyon (Palanques et al., 2005). 

That sediment mass transport events reaching the lower canyon are rare is 

confirmed by the overall scarcity of turbidite layers in sediments of late Holocene age 

recovered in cores from the lower canyon (Arzola et al., 2008). The most recent turbidite 

layer encountered in a core from the lower canyon (225-07) was tentatively attributed to 

the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, based on 210Pb geochronology (De Stigter et al., in press). 

The latter turbidite layer contained abundant quartz and micas (De Stigter et al., 

unpublished data), indicating that the sediment was transported from the upper canyon 

reaches, and did not originate from reworking of hemipelagic sediments by a local slope 

failure. It represents the most recent major event, indicating that only powerful events 

like such an earthquake are capable of remobilising and transporting sediment down-

canyon to such water depths. Even though such events may appear rare on the time-

scale represented by short sediment cores and in-situ observation with landers, on 

geological timescales submarine canyons are primarily shaped by the action of mass 

sediment transport processes. The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon is no exception to this as 

shown by data presented by Lastras et al. (2009). Slump scars, giant landslides blocks, 

large scours and sediment waves were observed especially in the canyon mouth area, 

testifying of high energy events occurring in the geologically recent past of the canyon. 

 

 



8. Final considerations 

 240 

The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon as sediment trap 

The data presented in Chapters 6 and 7 and summarised above seem to indicate that 

the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais Canyon presently act as traps for 

fine-grained sediments entrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf and slope, without 

substantial down-canyon dispersal to the middle and lower reaches. From the results here 

presented one may identify two important factors which contribute to the trapping effect 

of the canyon. First an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, which drives 

particles settling in the upper canyon toward the canyon head rather than disperse them 

down-canyon. The cause of the up-canyon flow probably has to be sought in the 

interaction of canyon morphology and present-day circulation patterns along the margin. 

The second factor is the apparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other 

canyon systems are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Canyons known 

for active sediment gravity flows have in common that they head very near-shore, thus 

receiving massive input of sand and silt from longshore transport or riverine input. The 

fast accumulation of incohesive sediment on steep sides of the canyon head leads to 

frequent sediment slides, which may evolve into energetic high-density turbidity currents 

running out towards deeper water. Large scale sediment waves typically encountered in 

the head of active canyons appear indicative of deposition from high energy turbidity 

currents (Smith et al., 2005). Whereas such structures are present in the head of Nazaré 

Canyon (Duarte et al., 2000) they were not noticed in the detailed morphological study of 

the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons by Lastras et al. (2009). Probably the heads of 

these canyons, located at 5, 6 and 22 km, respectively, from the nearest shoreline, are 

too far off the coast to intercept longshore sediment transport. Thus sediment input is 

largely restricted to fine-grained material settling from nepheloid layers passing over the 

upper canyon. In addition, the shelter against northwesterly storms provided by 

prominent coastal capes may limit sediment resuspension on the shelf and hence also 

limit suspended sediment supply to the canyons. This geomorphological setting is in clear 

contrast to the more exposed Nazaré Canyon. The rareness of sediment gravity flows 

flushing the canyon may give fine-grained sediment accumulating in the canyon time to 

compact into cohesive stable deposits, thus further reducing the chance of remobilisation. 

The presence of a sediment-filled thalweg of several hundred meters wide in the upper 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, compared to the strongly incised narrow thalweg in the active 

Nazaré Canyon, may thus reflect the infrequent flushing of the canyon since the last 

glacial sea level lowstand. 



8. Final considerations 

 241

In addition to sediment input from the shelf, a substantial part of sediment trapped 

in the canyon may also be derived from the adjacent slope, and notably from the interval 

between 500 and 1500 m occupied by the northward flowing Mediterranean Outflow 

Water (MOW). The strong density gradients at the boundaries of the MOW are thought to 

favour internal wave activity and sediment resuspension (McCave &amp;amp; Hall, 2002), whereas 

suspended sediment would be carried along-slope by the poleward flow of the water 

mass. From Cape São Vicente, the southernmost point of the Portuguese mainland where 

the MOW turns northward, the MOW flows practically unobstructed along the smooth and 

gently sloping Alentejo margin until the abrupt intersection with the Setúbal Canyon. 

Indications from sedimentology and benthic foraminifera for enhanced hydrodynamic 

energy and lateral sediment transport coinciding with the path of the MOW on the 

southern Portuguese slope have been reported by Schönfeld (1997) and, for what 

concerns sedimentology, were confirmed by the data here presented (Chapter 6, section 

6.7.3, pg. 182). As reported by De Stigter et al. (in press), enhanced SPM concentrations 

noticed within the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon at 500 and 1500 m depth may primarily be due 

to resuspension by focusing of internal tides along the canyon axis, but may conceivably 

also include suspended sediment entering via the MOW from the slope south of the 

canyon. The similarity in bulk sediment characteristics on the open slope and within the 

canyon (especially SPM caught in sediment traps) at this depth seems to be consistent 

with this interpretation (Chapter 6). Sediment accumulation rates in the upper Setúbal 

Canyon, the area potentially affected by lateral sediment input via the MOW, are well 

above the background hemipelagic sedimentation as can be assessed from mass fluxes in 

sediment traps and surface sediments in the lower canyon. However, since sediment 

accumulation on the canyon walls and edges is not constrained by the present data, the 

enhanced rates may also be explained as the result of focusing of sedimentation on the 

canyon thalweg. 

In their function as traps for suspended particulate matter, supplied laterally from the 

adjacent shelf and slope and vertically from the overlying water column, the Lisbon-

Setúbal and Cascais canyons constitute not only depocentres for inert sediment but also 

for biologically active organic material. Accumulation of relatively fresh organic material 

especially in the upper canyon, confirmed by studies of Pusceddu et al. (2010) and García 

et al. (2010), explains the enhanced abundance of benthic foraminifera (Koho et al., 

2008), and macrofauna (Cunha et al., in press) observed in these canyons. Whereas the 

latter studies concerned fauna on soft substrates of the sediment thalweg, abundant

suspension feeding fauna observed with underwater cameras on steep canyon walls is 

likely to be favoured by the continuous flow of particle-rich water driven by the internal 

tide in the canyon.

8.3. Trace metal enrichment in sediments from the central Portuguese 

continental margin 

Contents of major elements Ca, Al and Fe and some trace metals like Cr and Ni in 

surface sediments of central Portuguese canyons and open slopes appear mostly equal to 

contents of these elements in pre-industrial sediments, meaning that in terms of bulk 

composition the sediment has not changed over the last 150 years. Pre-industrial contents 

of trace metals, Fe and Al are largely similar for the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré Canyon 

systems, whereas recent surface sediments and suspended particulate matter usually 

show higher concentrations of trace metals, with somewhat diverging values between 

both areas. Surface sediments and suspended particulate matter in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon have higher mean concentrations of Mn, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cu and Ni compared to the 

Nazaré Canyon. Regarding only surface sediments, the highest mean concentrations for 

all trace metals are found in the Cascais canyon. The assessment of trace metal 

enrichment in present-day sediments on the basis of calculated enrichment factors 

supports the above observations. In both canyon systems, the anthropogenic contribution 

to total inventories of Pb and Zn generally decreases with increasing water depth. 

Different from Pb and Zn, present-day Cu enrichment appears to increase towards deeper 

water where pelagic sedimentation is predominant, suggesting that dispersal of this trace 

metal is at least partially linked with surface water plankton production. 

The assessment of Pb enrichment on the basis of lead stable isotope ratios indicates 

that lead in present-day surface sediments and SPM represents a mixture between 

anthropogenic contaminant lead and an unpolluted “crustal” end member. Pollutant lead 

appears to be mostly derived from industrial sources, whereas the current contribution of 

remnant gasoline lead additives is of minor importance. In accordance with the observed 

stronger enrichment of trace metals in the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons, as 

compared to the Nazaré Canyon, the anthropogenic signature in Pb isotopes appears also 

more pronounced in the southern canyons. Percentages of excess trace metal in the 

sediment column deposited over the last 150 years are also higher for the southern 

canyons, especially the Lisbon and Cascais canyons. The Lisbon Canyon has around 10 to 

15 % more anthropogenic Pb than the Nazaré Canyon for comparable water depths. This 

difference between both areas refers both to present-day sediments (determined through 

Pb stable isotopes) and to sediments deposited over the last 150 years (determined 

through inventories of excess Pb). 



8. Final considerations 

 244 

The consistently higher loading of anthropogenic trace metals in the southern 

canyons is consistent with the proximity of the Lisbon and Cascais canyons to heavily 

populated and industrialised areas, and with sediment input from the Tagus Estuary, a 

potential major source of pollutants particles. The degree of trace metal enrichment found 

in the Lisbon and Cascais canyons is comparable to what has been previously published 

from other canyon and slope areas, such as the Foix Canyon in the NW Mediterranean 

(Palanques et al., 2008), the Gulf of Lions continental slope in the NW Mediterranean 

(Miralles et al., 2006), and the Kaoping Canyon off Taiwan (Hung &amp;amp; Hsu, 2004). 

Focusing on the shelf area adjacent to the southern canyons, trace metal enrichment 

is widespread to the entire studied area of the Lisbon shelf while the Setúbal and Sines 

shelves have areas enriched in trace metals (Sado mud patch and the inner shelf) which 

contrast with others where pre-industrial concentrations where found on surface 

sediments. As mentioned above, the Tagus Estuary is one of the main sources of 

anthropogenic trace metals to the adjacent shelf, but some additional sources of 

anthropogenic input were detected in sediments, in particular the Sado Estuary, the St. 

André and Melides coastal lagoons, atmospheric input and possibly the Sines submarine 

outfalls. As a cautionary remark it must be said that the signal from this last source was 

tentatively identified in sediment samples collected between 1980 and 1988. Nowadays, 

after considerable improvement of wastewater treatment it is unlikely that contributions 

from this source can still be detected. In more recent studies by Cardoso &amp;amp; Palma (2007) 

and Maretec (2008), no trace metal enrichment was detected in sediments surrounding 

the submarine outfall. 

In general, along the last three decades the decrease of contamination in marine 

sediments is expected, given the improvement of new procedures for treatment of 

industrial and domestic effluents and the shutdown of some industries known to discharge 

contaminants into both Tagus and Sado estuaries. The reduction of input of contaminants 

into hydrographic basins and the marine environment should decrease further in the 

future after the implementations required by the EU-Directive 2000/60/EC (of 23 October 

2000), which establishes a framework for the protection of inland surface water, 

transitional water, coastal water and groundwater.

8.4. Conclusions 

 

Pathways of terrigenous sediment transport on the Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf  

• On the basis of the study of the fine fractions of different sedimentary deposits of the 

continental shelf it is safe to say that sand deposits on the shelf comprise mature fine 

fractions enriched in clay-sized particles while mud deposits have fresher fine 

fractions enriched in particles within the “sortable silt” range (10-63 µm). 

• Relatively high contents of terrigenous material are present at the shelfbreak of the 

Lisbon shelf. The transport of this sediment to the shelfbreak may occur not directly 

from river plumes issuing from the Tagus estuary but rather by cycles of 

resuspension and deposition from the Tagus mud patch. 

• The general southward increase of biogenic carbonate content in sediments of the 

Lisbon-Setúbal-Sines shelf indicates a southward decrease of terrigenous input from 

the area off the Tagus Estuary towards Cape Sines. 

• On the Lisbon shelf two important sources nourish the shelf with lithogenic fine 

sediments: the Tagus estuary and the sea-cliffs between Fonte da Telha beach and 

Cape Espichel. The Albufeira coastal lagoon most likely contributes also with 

lithogenic sediments to the shelf, but its contribution could not be detected in the 

mineralogy and geochemistry of surface sediments from the shelf. 

• On the Setúbal shelf contents of lithogenic material are lower than on the Lisbon 

shelf. Enhanced concentrations of mineral indicators of riverine sediment input, 

however, highlight the Sado mud patch and the upper Setúbal Canyon as 

depocentres of terrigenous sediment. Suspended particulate matter coming from the 

Sado Estuary seems to bypass the sandy deposits of the inner shelf. 

• On the Sines shelf, lithogenic sediment input appears generally low, and as a 

consequence the relative content of biogenic carbonate reaches maximum values in 

this area. Several local sources of lithogenic input can be traced, however, on the 

inner shelf: i) the Plio-Pleistocene sea-cliffs present in the southern half of the Troía-

Sines coastal arc; ii) the Santo André and Melides coastal lagoons; iii) the Sines sub-

volcanic complex. 



8. Final considerations 

 246 

• Dispersal patterns of mineralogical and geochemical tracers on the inner shelf 

between Tróia and Sines support a net northward longshore drift of sediments in the 

Tróia Peninsula and southward drift in the rest of the coastal arc. 

 

Recent sediment transport and deposition in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and 

comparisons to other environments of the central Portuguese margin 

• Sediment distribution on the central Portuguese margin is partitioned by submarine 

canyons and export of shelf sediments towards the deeper continental margin is 

restricted by slope currents, except where canyons provide corridors for down-slope 

transport. 

• The Nazaré Canyon is efficient in transporting sediments down to the lower canyon 

while in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and probably in the Cascais Canyon the down-

canyon transport to the lower canyon is very limited, conceivably only triggered by 

high energy events like high-magnitude earthquakes. 

• Sediment accumulation rates in the upper reaches of the Lisbon, Setúbal and Cascais 

Canyon are an order of magnitude higher than rates measured at comparable depths 

on adjacent slope areas and other parts of the western Iberian margin, indicating 

that these submarine canyons act as sediment depocentres. 

• Sediment input to the upper canyon reaches may result from: i) resuspension of shelf 

sediments under influence of storm waves or as a result of internal tidal waves 

generated on the edges of the canyons and propagating over the adjacent shelf, and 

subsequent advection of suspended matter to the canyon in bottom nepheloid layers; 

ii) direct input from turbid plumes issuing from nearby estuaries; iii) in the case of 

the Setúbal upper canyon: resuspension of sediments from the slope south of the 

canyon and entrainment with the Mediterranean Outflow Water flowing across the 

canyon. 

• In middle and lower Setúbal Canyon sediment accumulation rates are comparable to 

those of the adjacent open slope, suggesting that this part of the canyon has a much 

less active sedimentary regime than the upper canyon, and does not receive major 

input of sediment from either the upper canyon or from the adjacent open slope, 

apart from the background pelagic input. 

• In the upper Lisbon and Setúbal canyon, tidal currents have a prominent role in 

resuspending and transporting fine-grained sediments especially when currents 

(measured at one meter above the seabed) exceed the threshold speed of 15-



8. Final considerations 

 247

25 cm s-1. In the middle and lower canyon, on the other hand, there is only limited 

resuspension from the seabed and sedimentation processes prevail. During the 

period covered by this study, a particular characteristic of tidal currents in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon is the prevalence of net up-canyon directed flow. Since the strongest 

currents seem to be also directed up-canyon, it can be assumed that the prevalent 

direction of suspended sediment transport was up-canyon as well. 

• Unlike what is observed in other active canyon systems like the Nazaré Canyon, the 

Monterey Canyon, the Congo Canyon and the Palamós Canyon, low frequency and 

high-energy processes like gravity flows seem to be very rare in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon. The most recent sediment mass transport event detected in the lower 

canyon corresponds to the 1755 earthquake which means that only powerful events 

like such an earthquake are capable of remobilising and transporting sediment down-

canyon to such water depths. 

• The previous two conclusions explain why the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon (and possibly the Cascais Canyon) presently act as traps for fine-grained 

sediments entrained in suspension from the adjacent shelf, without substantial down-

canyon dispersal to the middle and lower reaches. 

 

Trace metal enrichment in the central Portuguese margin 

• Bulk composition and trace metal composition of pre-industrial sediments is largely 

similar for the Lisbon-Setúbal and Nazaré canyons systems. 

• Whereas bulk composition of the sediment has not changed over the last 150 years, 

present-day surface sediments and suspended particulate matter are significantly 

enriched in Pb, Zn and Cu compared to pre-industrial sediments. 

• Sediments in the Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons appear more enriched in trace 

metals than sediments in the Nazaré Canyon, both with regard to trace metal 

concentrations in core top samples as well as to inventories of excess trace metals 

accumulated over the last 150 years. The highest levels of enrichment in Pb, Zn and 

Cu are found in sediment deposits in the upper reaches of the Lisbon and Cascais 

canyons, consistent with their proximity to heavily populated and industrialised areas 

of central Portugal as well as to the Tagus River, a major source of pollutant 

particles. Discharge of dredged contaminated sediments in the Lisbon Canyon 

appears also as a potentially important source of anthropogenic trace metals. 



8. Final considerations 

 248 

• In accordance with the overall higher contents of trace metals in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

and Cascais canyons, the anthropogenic signature in lead isotopes appears also more 

pronounced in the southern area. 

• The role of submarine canyons as trap for particulate material and attached 

pollutants is confirmed by stronger influence of anthropogenic Pb and Zn compared 

to the adjacent open shelf and slope. 

• The dispersal of anthropogenic Pb over the southern area (Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

and adjacent continental shelf) seems to comprise important contributions from 

atmospheric transport. This is not only evident from the isotopic signature of the 

pollutant lead in surface sediments which resembles the signature of incinerator fly 

ashes from industries, but also from the wide spread of Pb enrichment affecting the 

entire study area, even in areas where other trace metals, also enriched in the 

estuaries, show no enrichment. 

• In the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon system considerably high levels of anthropogenic Pb 

and Zn enrichment appear restricted to the upper canyon reaches, decreasing 

exponentially further down-canyon. This indicates inefficient down-canyon transport 

of sediments in this canyon. 

• Trace metal enrichment in general appears widespread on the Lisbon shelf, whereas 

on the Setúbal and Sines shelves the areas enriched in trace metals appear more 

limited in extent, and are bounded by areas where pre-industrial concentrations 

prevail in surface sediments. 

• Considering the spatial distribution of trace metal enrichment on the shelf and upper 

slope from the Tagus estuary to Cape Sines, Pb enrichment is detected in the largest 

area, whereas successively smaller areas are affected by enrichment of, respectively, 

Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni. Generally, enrichment of trace metals tends to decrease with 

increasing water depth suggesting that the excess of trace metals is mostly derived 

from land.

8.5. Proposals for future investigations 

Whereas the present thesis integrates a large amount of pre-existing and newly-

generated data on sediment and trace metal dispersal on the central Portuguese margin, 

new perspectives have emerged that call for further study of particular aspects that 

cannot be resolved with the present data. Suggestions for further studies include the 

following: 

 

• Assessment of the temporal evolution of trace metal contamination through analysis 

of sediment cores with high temporal resolution from areas where fresh sediment 

accumulates, such as the Tagus mud patch or certain areas within the Tagus estuary 

not affected by dredging activities. Such analysis is very relevant to assess if new 

procedures for treatment of industrial and domestic effluents implemented during the 

past 30 years have been effective in reducing trace metal contamination in estuarine 

and shelf environments. Application of the EU-Directive 2000/60/EC (of 23 October 

2000) is expected to lead to new implementations in the near future which should 

affect hydrographic basins in an integrated approach to improve water quality. The 

objective of this Directive is to establish a framework for the protection of inland 

surface water, transitional water, coastal water and groundwater. On the longer run 

the effects of these measures are expected to affect not only the quality of water but 

also the quality of sediments which are known to reflect the overall contamination 

level of a given ecosystem. 

 

• Study of the seasonal and interanual variability of nepheloid layers issuing from the 

Tagus and Sado estuaries and associated dispersal of fine-grained particulate matter 

on the shelf. Six cruises conducted between 1993 and 1995 in the framework of the 

EU projects OMEX (Ocean Margin Exchange) I and II specifically addressed the 

behaviour of nepheloid layers in this area during winter and summer conditions. 

Results concerning the dispersal and deposition of suspended particulate matter 

issuing from the above estuaries were treated in Garcia (1997) and resumed and 

published in Jouanneau et al. (1998). According to these authors, however, the 

reported results refer to particularly dry years (1993-1995), during which the strong 

increase in water discharge normally observed during winter did not occur. No other 

studies comparing winter and summer conditions have since then been carried out, 



8. Final considerations 

 250 

and the composition and dispersal of suspended particulate matter over the shelf off 

the Tagus and Sado estuaries is still basically unknown for typical winter conditions. 

Therefore, the true extent of the influence of these rivers over the adjacent margin 

for what concerns input of particulate matter may have been underestimated so far. 

 

• Exploration of the interaction of the Mediterranean Outflow Water with the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon and adjacent slope, and its effect on the sedimentary dynamics of 

the canyon. Many studies have demonstrated the important modifications of open 

slope circulation where along-slope currents encounter a canyon on their path (e.g. 

Durrieu de Madron, 1994; Puig et al., 2000; Petrenko, 2003). The up-canyon flow 

observed at several locations within the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, which drives particle 

transport toward the canyon head rather than down-canyon, may be related to local 

diversions of the along-slope flow of the Mediterranean Outflow Water as it 

encounters the canyon. Better understanding of this interaction would be crucial to 

comprehend the functioning of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and its poorly-known 

ecosystems. 

 

• Assessment of the extent and environmental impacts of discharge of contaminated 

sediments in the Lisbon Canyon. Information on discharge of contaminated 

sediments in the Lisbon Canyon was obtained only during the final stage of writing of 

this thesis, so that additional information concerning the type and level of 

contamination in the discharged sediments and the frequency and location of these 

discharges by other entities than the APL (Administração do Porto de Lisboa) could 

not be accessed nor further evaluated. This subject is not only important to refine 

some of the conclusions of the present thesis, but the potential impact of discharges 

on canyon ecosystems should also be taken into consideration in view of the role that 

these canyons may play in fostering economically important biological resources.
