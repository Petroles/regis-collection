Abstract 
The Marine Strategic Framework Directive and the Reformed Common Fisheries Policy are 

following the ambitious objective to stop the loss of biodiversity and to make fisheries more 

sustainable. In most cases several fishing practices for one species exist, while in the 

exploitation of deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) and other nektobenthic 

crustacean, exploitation is exclusively reserved to the demersal trawling fleet. Because of the 

environmental impact of demersal trawling especially in deep waters and bycatch proportions 

exceeding ethical and ecological limits alternative fishing practices are needed urgently. In the 

Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde shrimp fisheries developed using semi-floating traps, 

the present work provides information about the feasibility of using such traps in a commonly 

trawling dominated fishery of the deepwater rose shrimp. However the low abundance of the 

specie made experimental conditions unfavorable. More frequent the golden shrimp (Plesionika 

martia), a scavenging specie was caught. A broad range of baits was tested, including 

fluorescent light and proceeded baits such as sardine paste (chum) with promising outcomes for 

future research in this field. 

Keywords: gear substitution; demersal trawling; light, semi-floating traps, crustacean fisheries

Resumo 
Na União Europeia, 88% dos stocks são explorados acima do rendimento máximo sustentável 

e 30% estão fora dos seus limites biológicos de segurança, com alterações que podem ser, em 

alguns casos, irreversíveis. O Comissário Europeu dos Assuntos Marítimos e das Pescas 

resumiu a presente situação com as seguintes palavras: “ O negócio do costume deixou de ser 

uma opção”. 

A tentativa de reforma da Política Comum das Pescas passa pela Diretiva Quadro Estratégia 

Marinha (DQEM). Esta Directiva tem o ambicioso objectivo de impedir a perda de serviços dos 

ecossistemas e biodiversidade nas águas da UE e alcançar o Bom Estado Ambiental em 2020. 

Para o sector das pescas, está definido que até 2020, a captura de todos os stocks deverá estar 

dentro ou abaixo dos níveis de exploração que correspondem ao rendimento máximo 

sustentável e todos os recursos devem ser geridos através de uma abordagem ecossistémica.  

O Bom Estado Ambiental é definido por onze descritores, sendo que o sexto refere o seguinte: 

“a integridade do fundo marinho assegura o funcionamento do ecossistema”, dando uma 

especial atenção à protecção dos habitats bentónicos e ênfase à sua importância para o 

ecossistema. A pesca de arrasto envolve a tecnologia de pesca mais destrutiva, praticada 

geralmente à escala industrial, com elevados impactos na comunidade bentónica e elevadas 

proporções de bycatch que excedem os limites ecológicos e éticos. 

A pesca de arrasto demersal entra em conflito directo com as artes estáticas como palangres, 

armadilhas ou redes, e ocupa maioria das zonas de pesca. Devido a limitação da pesca de arrasto 

nos Açores, está a ser desenvolvida uma pesca com covos semi-flutuantes, com resultados 

promissores. As armadilhas não têm impacto na fauna e flora bentónicas. Para além das razões 

ecológicas e legais, outro factor importante é o benefício sócio-económico para a frota 

polivalente, visto que a poucos postos de trabalho. No entanto, a pesca com armadilhas é uma 

atividade que pode ser desenvolvida em embarcações de menores dimensões, envolvendo 

investimentos menores. A implementação de uma pesca de gamba com armadilhas em Portugal, 

iria proporcionar o aumento da rentabilidade de uma larga comunidade pesqueira que utiliza 

embarcações polivalentes. Assim, o presente trabalho tem como objectivo avaliar a viabilidade 

económica e técnica da pesca de gamba com covos semi-flutuantes.  

O projecto foi desenvolvido em duas áreas a Sul e Sudoeste da costa de Portugal. No total, 

foram executados 35 ensaios, e colocados 3413 covos. A espécie alvo foi captura em quantidade 

reduzida, devido provavelmente à utilização de isco pouco adequado. Os resultados de estudos 

realizados com a gamba indicam que esta espécie é principalmente predadora, alimentando-se 



 

iv 

de presas vivas, mais especificamente de um numero relativamente reduzido de poliquetas 

bentónicas e endobentónicos.  

O camarão mais capturado pelos covos foi o camarão marreco (Plesionika martia). As pescarias 

de crustáceos de profundidade nas Ilhas Canárias, Cabo Verde e Açores, estão também 

concentradas em espécies de Plesionika, mas contrariamente aos estas ilhas atlânticas as 

densidades estimadas são demasiado reduzidas para uma exploração económica viável. 

A enorme pressão sobre a gamba exercida pelo arrasto poderá estar a afectar igualmente outras 

espécies de crustáceos como o camarão marreco, visto que ambos os stocks se sobrepõem na 

mesma extensão batimétrica. Adicionalmente, o camarão marreco é uma espécie tropical que 

na costa portuguesa se encontra no limite Norte da sua distribuição geográfica.  

O trabalho realizado forneceu informação sobre os tipos de isco adequados. Para além do isco 

comum (peixe gordo) foram testados peixe triturado, ração de aquacultura e atratores luminosos 

fluorescentes. O peixe triturado acabou por ser mais eficaz do que o isco comum. A luz também 

produziu capturas significativamente mais elevadas que o isco comum. Este último resultado é 

muito importante e requererá mais investigação no futuro, visto que a utilização de peixe como 

isco permanece um tema crítico e a utilização de luz poderá ser uma das possíveis soluções, 

como substituto do isco tradicional, numa pesca mais sustentável e para espécies com 

estratégias alimentares muito específicas, como a gamba. 

Os crustáceos são o grupo de espécies capturadas mais rentável, tanto de captura selvagem 

como de produção em aquacultura. Infelizmente, são obtidos utilizando práticas de pesca e de 

cultivo que são destrutivas para com o meio ambiente. Os sistemas de aquacultura intensiva, na 

sua maioria instalados em antigas zonas de mangal, resultaram em grandes faixas de terra áridas 

e inférteis. Os impactos da pesca de arrasto demersal não têm o mesmo alcance visual, mas são 

comparáveis a actos de desflorestação. Neste contexto, o desenvolvimento de uma pescaria 

dirigida a camarões de profundidade utilizando artes de pesca de menores impactos, como as 

armadilhas, traria um enorme benefício dos pontos de vista ecológico e sócio-económico.

1. Introduction  
 

In the European Union 88 % percent of stocks are fished beyond Maximum Sustainable Yield 

(MSY) and 30% are outside their biological limits facing irreversible population changes 

(Greenpaper 2009). The commissioner of the EU for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Maria 

Damanaki summed up the situation with the words: “Business as usual is not an option 

anymore”. A derivative of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the Marine Strategy 

Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC). The directive was released with the ambitious aim 

to stop the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity in the EU waters and to establish good 

environmental status (GES) by 2020. For the fisheries sector it is defined that all stocks should 

be harvested at MSY or lower under the ecosystem approach to fisheries. GES is defined by 

eleven descriptors, and descriptor number six reads as follows: “seafloor integrity ensures the 

functioning of the ecosystem” giving a special attention to the protection of benthic habitats 

and emphasizing their importance for the ecosystem. Trawling is the most destructive fisheries 

technology practiced on industrial scale, with high impacts on the benthic community (Hall–

Spencer et al. 2002; Jones 1992) and bycatch proportions exceeding ethical and ecological 

limits (Borges 2001; Kennelly 1995). Traps in contrary have very little direct impact on the 

benthic environment and are highly selective (species and size) towards the species targeted. 

Nevertheless are traps in deepwater shrimp fisheries the exception rather than the rule and 

receive only in recent years more attention due to the motivations of the named directives and 

reformations to substitute damaging fishing gears.   

Crustaceans are the supreme group of marine capture and aquaculture production with over-

average market values and high demand. Unfortunately they are mostly obtained by 

environmental destructive cultivation or fishing practices. The intensive aquaculture systems in 

former mangrove forests in the tropical regions resulted in large dry and unfertile land stripes. 

The impacts of demersal trawl fisheries are more withdrawn from our perception but they are 

very similar and often compared to deforestation (Kaiser 2000; Roberts 2002).  

The deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) (DWS) is a short lived nektobenthic 

decapod living in depth between 20 - 750 m (Tom et al. 1988) with different bathymetric depth 

ranges in the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. A comprehensive review about the 

biology and ecology of the DWS stocks in the Atlantic is available from Sobrino et al. (2005). 

According to this study in the Algarve, the highest abundance can be found between 100 – 300 

m with a positive gradient towards larger carapace length (CL) with greater depth. Lifespan is

expected to be shorter than three years and maturity is reached at 24 mm CL (females) and 20 

mm CL (males). Females carry ovaries throughout the year except between February and April. 

Two spawning seasons are identified, the more important summer peak is followed by a second 

autumn spawning peak involving only younger individuals. Depending on size DWS feeds on 

a large variety of prey ranging from planktonic crustaceans to small cephalopods and fish. 

Sobrino et al. (2005) identified two feeding behaviors, one during the digging phase associated 

with preys living in the benthos (polychaeta, foraminifera, echinoderms) and the hunting phase, 

concentrating on demersal and pelagic animals such as small fish and cephalopods as well as 

other crustaceans. The different feeding behavior support the evidence that the specie is 

performing vertical migrations in 24 h cycles resulting in different catchabilities (by the 

trawlers) at night and day (Sonderblohm 2011). 

The DWS is a specie economically exploited mainly in the Mediterranean and in a small extend 

in the North-East Atlantic along the coast of Portugal to the Gulf of Cadiz. In the Atlantic only 

Spain and Portugal conduct fishing on this specie. Sobrino et al. (2005) proposed on stock for 

the Atlantic population but detailed genetic information is missing. Portugal’s demersal 

trawling fleet is targeting largely the named specie and Norway lobster. In recent years the 

shrimp fishery became more important due to cut offs in the quota of Norway lobster (Nephrops 

norvegicus). In contrary to DWS these stocks are managed at the European level under the 

International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Because the stock was showing signs 

of overfishing, in 2005, a recovery plan for norway lobster (and European hake) was 

implemented (Council Regulation No 2166/2005). During a period of ten years, an annual 

reduction of fishing effort of 10 % is aiming at restoring the stocks in West Galicia and South 

Portugal. Concomitantly the advised TAC is steadily decreasing.  

Nevertheless is the fishing effort of the crustacean trawling fleet alternating between DWS and 

Norway lobster depending on the Norway lobster TAC and abundance of DWS. Because of the 

absence of a TAC for DWS and a series of years with great abundance, the fishery focuses more 

on DWS and became more important in recent years (Fig 1, Table 1).

While the Norway lobster stocks are assessed by the ICES, the DWS assessment is carried out 

at the national level by the Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA). Data comes 

from the official landings and research surveys carried out once a year. According to a virtual 

population analyzes, over a time period of five years (1984 – 1989) the DWS stock of the 

Atlantic was overexploited (Pestana, 1991). Nevertheless this is a resource with short life and 

large fluctuations, dependent on good recruitment and therefore is strongly related to 

environmental conditions. This is supported by a study carried out by Ana Moreira and Borges

(2010) correlating the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NOA), precipitation and sea surface 

temperature (SST) with the landings of DWS and Norway lobster. Even though the results are 

ambiguous a general trend shows that weak upwelling and warmer waters enhance recruitment 

of DWS. On the contrary, Norway lobster abundance is positively correlated with the same 

NOA patterns but with a preference for lower SST and stronger upwelling.  

In conclusion, Sobrino et al. (2005) recommend an effort reduction of 10 – 15% to decrease the 

fishing pressure and gear modifications to respect the Minimum Landing Size (MLS) of 24 mm 

CL in DWS (e.g. square mesh panels with 60 mm mesh width) (Campos et al. 2002). 

The high environmental impacts of deepwater trawling, the indiscriminate catch pattern and the 

high bycatch mortality are putting it under pressure of conservationists, scientist and the public 

media. Because trawling was strongly subsidized during the 1990’s its capacity grew and 

became the mode of production for demersal fisheries (Sumaila 2013). This is shown by the 

value of the landings of different gears. Demersal trawling accounts for 38 % of total value of 

landings in the EU member states (STECF Report 2014). Trawling vessels are catching large 

quantities, relatively to the employment provided (FAO 2005). This makes the activity very 

questionable from a socio-economic point of view, in face of the high value of the demersal 

fish and crustacean stocks, but also due to the policy from the new CFP, that incentives the 

allocation of resources towards fisheries with less impacts on the environment and providing 

more livelihoods to the fishing community: 

“When allocating the fishing opportunities available to them, as referred to in Article 16, 

member states shall use transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, 

social and economic nature. The criteria to be used may include, inter alia, the impact of fishing 

on the environment, the history of compliance, the contribution to the local economy and 

historic catch levels. Within the fishing opportunities allocated to them, member states shall 

endeavour to provide incentives to fishing vessels deploying selective fishing gear or using 

fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact, such as reduced energy consumption or 

habitat damage.” - Article 17, Reformed Common Fisheries Policy 
 

The use of gears with fewer environmental impacts, such as traps, would also add value to the 

catch, because fish or crustacean caught with a trawling net are in general poorer state due to 

the heavy physical impacts during the hauls and on deck processing (Leocádio et al. 2012). In 

terms of ecological impacts, fuel consumption and habitat destruction bottom trawling stands 

out (Table 2).

with list of criteria and related references 

 

The impacts of trawling are mainly studied on shallow water habitats and hard bottoms because 

of the drastic consequences for calcified structures. Deep waters and soft bottoms are a difficult 

study environment with ecosystem characteristics that make them more vulnerable to any kind 

of disturbance (Kaiser 2000). In nature the strongest physical forces are induced by weather 

(e.g. wind) and the turbulence it generates is vertically transported into deeper water layers by 

orbital waves, but with depth the power of the waves gradually disappears. The evolutionary 

history of the organisms in such an environment took place without or with very infrequent 

impacts such as falling material from upper water layers. Besides this, other forms of energy 

are also scarce because of the absence of light. Low metabolic rates, late maturity and slow 

growth rates, make deep sea species more vulnerable to changes in the environment, reducing 

their ability to recover from disturbances (Collie 2000; Johnson 2002; Kaiser 2000). 

Trawling is producing a climate of steady disturbance in this commonly “silent” environment 

with consequences for the abundance, composition and distribution of epi- and endofauna, 

making it less diverse and abundant (Schratzberger 2002). Macroscopic changes also take place 

such as the general trend towards smaller sizes of endofaunal species due to the size-selective 

character of the gear (Queirós 2006). Overall the ecosystem dynamic is dominated and 

controlled by the fishing activity itself. This includes indirect impacts such as food subsidies to 

the scavenging species in form of offshore discarded bycatch, resulting in greater diversity and 

abundance of this community (Kaiser 2000). Another reason for the increased abundance of 

low trophic species is the predator release due to the size selectivity towards maximum sizes. 



 

6 

Besides the physical impact of the otter doors and tickler chains, trawling originates the 

resuspension of benthic sediments in clouds of 3 – 4 m in height and 70 – 200 m wide, 

transporting organic and inorganic matter up to 800 g m-2s-1 in the surrounding areas (Durrieu 

de Madron 2011). The siphons of burrowing species are covered and the oxygenation of the 

sediments is reduced. Deepwater currents are able to transport these clouds and alter the 

sedimentation rates even in bathyal depths (Martín 2008) which makes it difficult to assess the 

total area impacted by a trawl besides the towed area.  

The Portuguese trawl fishery for deep water crustaceans has initiated its activity in 1940’s 

targeting exclusively Norway lobster. In the second half of that century a Portuguese-Spanish 

joint venture initiated the industrial exploration of DWS. At present the Portuguese trawling 

fleet holds licenses for fish and crustacean and comprises 186 vessels, with 26 vessels licensed 

for the capture of Crustacea (Wise et al. 2015). At present this crustacean fleet mainly targets 

norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and DWS. Other deepwater crustacean species, such as 

red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus), giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea) and the scarlet 

shrimp (Aristaeopsis edwardsiana) are also targeted but in relatively small quantities.  

The Portuguese trawling fleet is not allowed to operate inside 6 nautical miles from the baseline. 

The enforcement of this legislation was helped by the introduction of a vessel monitoring 

system (VMS) in 2002 for all Vessels above 15 m. Information from the system concerning the 

position and speed of the vessel is transmitted to shore-based facility every two hours. Using 

the vessel speed as a proxy, it is possible to identify individual trawl hauls. Then, this 

information can be matched with landings and logbook entries. The overall result is a detailed 

mapping of fishing effort allocation (Afonso-Dias 2008).  

The Fishing trips never exceed three days (Afonso-Dias 2008) with average trawling speed of 

3.0 nm/h (Sobrino 1998; Sobrino et al. 2005; Viriato and de Figueiredo 1991). The fishery for 

nektobenthic shrimp and Norway lobster takes place on soft and muddy bottoms between 200 

- 600 m along the South and South-Western Coast of Portugal. Norway lobster, red shrimp, 

scarlet shrimp and giant red shrimp are in the deeper waters (400 – 1000 m), while the DWS is 

between 200 - 400 m (Campos et al. 2002; Sobrino et al. 2005). This depth spectrum is covering 

parts of the outer shelf but mostly the continental slope. Because each fishery is taking place 

predominantly in a certain depth spectrum and during day or night the bycatch composition is 

differing with target specie. The tows targeting Norway lobster are bringing up more deepwater 

species such as silvery pout (Gadiculus argenteus), roughtip grenadier (Nezumia 

sclerorhynchus), and mediterranean slimehead (Hoplostetus mediterraneus) (Monteiro 2001).

While the bycatch from shallower waters during tows for DWS are mainly consist of deep sea 

shark species (Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus pusillus, Etmopterus spinax) conger (Conger 

conger), European hake (Merluccius merluccius), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus and 

Trachuros picturatus) monkfish (Lophius piscatorius) and a variety of cephalopods (Fig. 7) 

(Borges 2001). Only blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is present along the whole depth 

spectrum and consequently is found in both fisheries in enormous quantities (Fig. 7).  

The demersal trawling vessels are obliged by law to land at least 70% of target specie. For the 

crustacean fleet this means only up to 30 % of the quantity caught can be fish. This also 

increases the bycatch problem because the captain would violate the law when retaining fish 

exceeding the 30 % limit. On the other side, trawlers targeting fish can land up to 30 % of 

crustacean species including the closed month of January. Because of the high value of 

crustacean species and the low value of fish in recent years these vessels make full use of the 

regulation. 

Both fisheries use a diamond mesh codend with a mesh width of 55mm for DWS and 70 mm 

for Norway lobster (stretched, diagonal). MLS of 24 mm CL for DWS and 21 mm CL for 

norway lobster are in place, to avoid recruitment overfishing. As said above  gear modifications 

are necessary to respect the of DWS and Norway lobster (e.g. square mesh panels with 60 mm 

mesh width) (Campos et al. 2002).  

While for fish and lobsters there is the possibility to use trammel nets, gillnets, longlines or 

traps, in fisheries for nektobenthic decapods such as DWS and the golden shrimp the option of 

using gears alternative to trawling, is yet very little investigated. Traps are one of the oldest 

hunting gathering techniques, with long traditions in fisheries, available in a huge variety of 

shapes and sizes. But for demersal fisSh and crustacean stocks the common mode of production 

became demersal trawling due to high catch rates (low selectivity) and relatively easy 

application. The expansion of trawling in demersal fisheries pushed traps back, and introduced 

a new level of fishing effort. Consequently nowadays most stocks are either fully or 

overexploited, making viable fisheries with less efficient gears more difficult due to the low 

densities encountered (Chuenpagdee et al. 2003; Myers and Worm 2003).  

The largest crustacean fishery in European waters by value and quantity is for Norway lobster, 

a specie widely distributed over the North East Atlantic from Norway to Morocco as well as in 

the Mediterranean (FAO, Species Fact Sheet).

In terms of landed values it is as important as the traditional demersal finfish species such as 

cod, haddock or pollock. Interestingly a major trapping fleet developed in coexistence with 

trawling due to some specialties of the specie. Because of behavioral reasons large males are 

more vulnerable to traps, this results in a catch with mainly large individuals and in prime 

condition (alive) with a significant higher market value (Fig. 2) (Leocádio et al. 2012). In the 

certification process for Loch Torridon Norway lobster by the Marine Stewardship Council a 

fisherman stated (David 2003):  

“On the economic side, Loch Torridon live Nephrops fetch three and four times the price of 

the same creature netted by a trawler”

demersal towed gears (demersal trawl and beam trawl) from five European Countries (Sweden, France, 

Portugal, Ireland and United Kongdom). The difference in price for demersal trawling (pink) and traps 

(green) is highly significant (paired t-test, p=3x10-4). (STECF 2013) 

 

Creels and traps are common in Lobster fisheries around the world, but the catch of deepwater 

nektobenthic shrimp with pots or creels is less known. During the 1980’s experimental trapping 

was conducted by NOAA to explore deep-water crustaceans (King 1981; Struhsaker 1974). In 

the Atlantic oceanic islands (Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde), where trawling is not 

allowed due to inadequate bottoms (steep and rocky), the local fisherman were forced to use 

alternative fishing methods. Arrasate-López and González (2012) conducted experiments with 

semi-floating traps around the Canary Islands. Between 100 – 1300 m it was possible to catch 

a variety of different species according to their bathymetric extend, with prospecting results for 

an economic exploration of golden shrimp (Plesionika edwardsii). Following the same concept, 



 

9 

Cabo Verde carried out trials with the same outcomes and plans to open a commercial fishery 

targeting golden shrimp with traps (Gonzáles 2012). 

Semi-floating traps have some advantages in comparison to common creels deployed on the 

bottom. The bait stays viable for a longer period because benthic scavengers (i.e. amphipods, 

isopods and equinoderms) are hindered to access the trap. Semi-floating traps are expected to 

lower the catch of other bottom crustacean species with no ability to swim (Norway lobster, 

spider crabs and hermit crabs) and increase the catches of nektobenthic species. A lifted trap 

will be better to capture DWS.  

Critical issues are the use of bait and ghost fishing but in face of the enormous impacts of 

trawling, the damages can be considered minor. More difficult is the substitution of bait. 

Arrasate-López and González (2012) used chub mackerel and other species with high fat 

contents. These are mainly small pelagic fish species due to their availability and low value. 

However, these species also represent prime nourishment for human consumption due to the 

high content of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids. Existing literature about artificial baits is 

very scarce and its efficacy is not yet established, therefore substitution of traditional baits is 

yet not in sight (Archdale 2011).  

1.1 Objective  
Overfishing and damaging fishing gear are responsible for the devastating state of fisheries 

resources in Europe and the world (Pauly et al. 2002). The following work aims to draw out the 

possibilities to use semi-floating traps in a trawling dominated fishery for the DWS in South 

Portugal including a preliminary evaluation of the economic viability of such a fishery.

2. Material and Methods 
 

The absence of information on trap fishing targeting DWS required the investigation of several 

aspects such as, trap design, bait type, soaking time and distance of the traps from the bottom.  

The project was planned in two phases, one developed on the West coast, known to have 

moderate conditions for DWS and the common fishing ground for the specie along the Algarve 

coast. The were divided into two subareas, identified in South Sines (SS) and Sines North (SN) 

and Portimao (PRT) and Faro (FAR) (Fig. 3) 

 

Fig. 3 The sample sites for the trapping experiments (SW &amp;amp;S) with the related areas: Sines North (SN), 

Sines South (SS), Portimão (PRT) and Faro (FAR) 

 

In both cases trawling was undertaken in the vicinity of the trap lines, to estimate DWS 

abundance in the area. The comparison of DWS length distributions between trawl and trap 

catches would also allow the evaluation of the impact of the two gears on the population 

structure. 

It was expected that an improvement in the trap line design could be achieved during phase one 

and that such information could be used in phase two to maximize the catch and obtain 

preliminary information on the economic viability of trap fishing for DWS. 

The experiments were conducted on two commercial fishing vessels. A trawler with 24.9 m 

using a standard codend with 55 mm diagonal mesh with a crew of seven people and a 

polyvalent vessel with 17. 08 m operating the traps, with a crew of six. Both vessels can be

considered as representatives of their class. In the South coast, trawls were also undertaken with 

a fine mesh codend (28 mm), in order to obtain DWS samples not affected by the codend 

selectivity of the commercial net. 

2.1 Trap design  
 

Three different trap types were tested during the experimental part of the project.  

? Type A – A modification of traps used for Norway lobster, but made of lighter material, 

a model designed in cooperation with fisherman experienced in trap fishing of Norway 

lobster; (Fig. 4, a); 

? Type B – Light collapsible traps, originally used in nearshore fisheries of crabs in 

seagrass meadows, hence the structure is very fragile but the ability to fold the traps 

would make it also for smaller vessels to deploy larger numbers of traps (Fig. 4, b); 

? Type C - conic trap type used in the shrimp fisheries in the Canary Islands and the 

Azores (Fig. 4, c).

2.2 Trap line setup 
 

Peak density of DWS is expected between 100 and 300 m, with average size of the individuals 

increasing with depth. To target larger sizes, the trap lines were deployed bellow 200 meters 

(200 – 400 m).  

Because the target species is nektobenthic, the basic design followed the description of a trap 

line to fish for other nektobenhtic shrimp (Arrasate-Lópes et al., 2012), described in (Fig. 5, a). 

To give the traps buoyancy, floaters were installed on the top of the traps (Fig. 5, b). The buoys 

chosen are used on the head rope of trawling nets operating at the same depth and are, therefore, 

resistant to high pressures. At the bottom the traps were attached to the mainline with a piece 

of rope of varying lengths (1, 2, 3 or 4 m). The mainline had built-in lead and concrete blocks 

were tied at regular spaces to guarantee it stayed in contact with the bottom.

2.3 Bait 
 

To identify the optimum of bait or attractant different natural and artificial baits were tested. 

Fatty fish species such as sardine or mackerel were salted. Three new bait types were also tested 

on the South coast, chum (paste of minced sardine) used by recreational fisherman, aquaculture 

fish pellets and fluorescent light sticks.  

Light regulates migratory movements on daily or life cycle basis in deepwater crustaceans 

(Aguzzi 2009). It dictates the daily vertical migrations and consequently also significantly the 

feeding behavior.  

The condition of the bait (signs of consumption=1, no consumption=0) was registered for each 

trap  

2.4 Soaking time 
 

DWS concentrates on the bottom during the day to forage, mainly preying on endobenthic and 

benthic animals. Because of this, the trawl catches are at a peak around noon (Sonderblohm 

2011). It is therefore expected that the feeding activity is highest immediately after returning 

from the pelagic phase, at around sunrise. To test the variation in catchability throughout the 

day, four time frames were tested: 

I. Sunrise 

II. Daytime 

III. Sunset  

IV. Day + Night  

The soaking time varied from 2 to 48 hours. Occasionally longer times happened due to 

difficulties in retrieving the tarps during bad weather. 

  



 

14 

2.5 Density of DWS 
 

The density of the DWS was evaluated using swept method approach, based on the trawl 

catches, in accordance to the FAO guidelines for trawl surveys (Sparre and Venema 1998). The 

estimations were done for each tow and the average for S and SE calculated. The trawled 

distance was calculated based on the registered vessel speed and the trawl duration. The wing 

spread is considered to be the best estimate of the width of the area swept by a trawl because 

the otter boards and bridles are much wider than the net itself and pass on the swirled-up 

organisms into the codend, consequently is the are-swept a function of headrope, length (hr) 

and a conversion factor (X2) correcting for the real net opening multiplied with the towed 

distance (D).  

? = ? ? ?? ? ?2 

The caught biomass of DWS of each tow was simply divided by the area swept to obtain a 

relative abundance index of the specie.  



 

15 

2.6 Statistical analysis 
 

The total number of traps in a particular line were defined by the bottom characteristics, to 

avoid setting the line on rocky sites. The factors being tested (trap type, distance to the bottom 

and bait time) were completely randomized. Fifty randomization schemes were prepared and 

used during the traps deployment, in order to quickly construct the line. For the identification, 

each trap was tagged with a individual number.  

A logistic linear model (response variable presence or absence of the species) was used. The 

continuous variable soaking time was transformed into a two level factor DURATION: short, 

soaking time &amp;lt;12hours, and long, soaking time ? than 12 hours. Other factors considered were 

BAIT TYPE, TRAP TYPE, TIME OF DAY (1=sunrise, 2= sunset, 3=all day and 4= night), REGION 

(SW=Southwest and S=South), AREA (SN, SS, PRT and FAR) and DISTANCE FROM THE 

SEAFLOOR (0, 1 2 and 3 meters). In the case of significant variables, contrast were used to 

compare the levels. 

The consumption of the bait was also classified into one of two categories, consumed (1) and 

not consumed (0). The category consumed includes the fully consumed and half consumed bait. 

A logistic model was applied to compare regions and areas.

3. Results 
The location of the trials are presented in Fig. 6, while the characteristics of the trap and trawl 

essays are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Given the lack of success in catching DWS during 

the first phase of the experiments on the SW coast, and the impossibility of identifying the best 

choice of factors to maximize DWS catches, the completely randomized set up was maintained 

during the trials in the South coast.

The experiments included 35 trap lines in depths between 281 m and 583 m (Table 3). Each 

line consisted of 80 – 150 traps, of which 15 lines were placed in Sines (SN, SS) and 20 in the 

Algarve (FAR, PRT) (Fig. 6). In total, 16 different species were caught consisting of eight 

decapods species, four Osteichthyes, one Chondrithye, one gastropod and two equinoderms 

(Table 6).  

Simultaneously, 45 trawls were conducted during this period, 19 in the Southwest Coast, and 

26 in the Algarve (Table 4).  

In both vessels the species caught were identified, counted and weighted. In the case of the 

trawler this was done on a subsample of the catch, and the numbers and weight of the subsample 

were extrapolated to the total catch. Samples of DWS were taken for each tow to obtain size 

frequencies and weight-length relationship of the population.  

Densities between 0.10 and 0.12 g/m² were observed (Table 5).The densities estimated were 

generally higher in the South and South-West.  

The target specie DWS was caught rarely with the traps. Instead of DWS, the only decapod 

entering the traps in amounts allowing statistical analysis was the golden shrimp, Plesionika 

martia. In particular the PRT area was showing highest catches followed by Faro and 

exceptional catches as well in the South-West.  

To estimate the area affected by traps, sophisticated oceanographic data is necessary, such as 

the intensity and direction of benthic currents in the area (Miller 1990). Moreover, the area of 

attraction is heavily dependent on the ability of the target specie to detect the bait. Neither one 

of these aspects, current information nor olfactory capacity, were available. 

The statistical analysis was only applied to the golden shrimp, and only for the South coast data. 

A total of 1965 traps were included in the analysis, 42 of them with presence of the gold shrimp.  

From the factors considered in the logistic model, only bait type was significant (p.value &amp;lt;

0.001). Bait categories considered were: oily fish (S+C+SC), chum (CH), pellets (AF) and the 

fluorescent light (L) as indicated in (Fig. 7). The four bait levels were compared using contrasts 

(Table 7). 

  



 

22 

Table 7 Contrasts for different baits used during the experimental phase. Cavala and Sardine are 

summarized in the group “oily fish” 

 

The results show that the differences are highest between chum and oily fish. The efficiency of 

the bait, from the most efficient to the least efficient are: 

1. Chum 

2. Fluorescent Light 

3. Pellets 

4. Oily fish 

The scavenger activity was described as well by the condition of the bait after hauling. A total 

of 3321 traps were observed (1112 with sight of bait consumption). The study sites of the SW 

show a higher bait consumption than the South (p-value 0.0216) and Faro less scavenger 

activity than Portimão (p-value-0.0006). The proportion of bait consumption categories in each 

area are presented in Fig.7. 

  

 

Fig. 8 Scavenger activity in the four sampling areas (SN, SS, PRT, FAR). The bait conditions was 

macroscopic evaluated and grouped into intact, half consumed and consumed. 

 



 

23 

Higher rates of bait consumption in the SW coast reflect the capture of more benthic species 

including high numbers of the henslow swimming crab, seastars and seacucumbers.  

The problems encountered regarding the bait and the general low abundance resulted in catches 

below consideration for a viable fishing operation.

4. Discussion 
 

The catch of DWS was more difficult than previously assumed. One reason could be the low 

abundance in the present year, given the fluctuating nature of this resource. This is in agreement 

with the decreasing tendency in the landing since 2011 (Fig 1). From 2011 to 2014, the 

estimated landings were, 1057, 672, 641 and 418 tones, respectively (DGRM, Estatísticas da 

Pesca). During the first 6 months of 2015 the DWS landings were 146 tones, compared with 

158 for the first 6 months of 2014 (DGRM, Data Pescas Difusão). These values suggest that 

2015 will be a year of low DWS catches, assumed to be related with low abundances of the 

resource.  

Some simple calculations of the expected number caught in the traps, based on the DWS 

densities estimated with the trawling and probable trap attraction areas were performed. The 

attraction area was assumed to have a circular shape, in the absence of better information for a 

more sophisticated approach to estimate attraction area, such as current speeds, behavior of 

odor plumes and sensitivity of the DWS to the different baits presented (Aedo and Arancibia 

2003). Assuming the area towed and the corresponding DWS catch, the estimated average 

density of this species was 0.10 and 0.12 g/m2 for the SW and S coast respectively. Considering 

the estimated average individual weight was 11.8 g, the expected numbers caught in the traps, 

based on an attraction area with one meter radius, were between zero to one. The extremely low 

catches obtained with the raps, could therefore be the result of very low densities of the DWS. 

The lifecycle of the species also impacts on trap catchability. DWS is a nectobenthic penaidae 

species, spending part of the day close to the bottom (day time) and scattering to layers above 

the bottom the rest of the day (night time) (Sobrino et al. 2005). DWS is feeding on a variety 

of organism depending on the stage of the daily cycle, but the diet is dominated by a variety of 

small endobenthic organisms (Bergström 2000; Sobrino et al. 2005).  

Other deep water shrimp of the family Pandalidae, that follow the daily migration pattern of 

mesopelagic species, feed on a wider variety of organisms (Fanelli and Cartes 2004). Cartes 

(1993) pointed out that the variation in prey is much smaller in species foraging on benthic 

prey, such as the DWS, than pelagic hunting crustacean species (golden shrimp).  

Fanelli and Cartes (2004) estimated a trophic diversity index for golden shrimp of 3.3 while in 

DWS it varied between 1.04 and 1.5 depending on sex and region (Kapiris 2004). The 

deepwater rose shrimp is focused on Lophogaster typicus, mysids and other amphipods but in 

a much smaller extent, on discarded osteichtthyes and cephalopods. In conclusion, DWS is 



 

25 

mostly preying on a narrow range of benthic invertebrates, rather than scavenging. This may be 

the reason why the golden shrimp was more susceptible to the offered baits and distances to the 

seafloor (1 – 2 m). 

When fishing in areas with high scavenging activity, the possibility of attraction by the bait 

scavengers, rather than the bait itself, needs to be considered. In the study area the presence of 

scavengers in the bait pockets, mainly small amphipods and isopods, was frequent (Fig. 8). This 

situation may justify the capture of a few individuals of DWS. In Kapiris (2004) stomach 

analysis revealed that isopods were the preferred food in “quality and quantity”. The scavenging 

activity of isopods was very high and even after short trials of only a few hours, the bait was 

completely consumed, especially in the South-West (Fig. 8). In some cases, the whole trap was 

covered by a thick layer of small scavengers (amphipods) and in other cases there were just 

bones left in the bait pockets. The accumulation of scavengers around the cages could have 

acted as an indirect bait to DWS. Several studies have proven that an increased scavenger 

activity is typical of trawling dominated marine habitats. (Kaiser 2002; Thrush 2002). 

The golden shrimp Plesionika martia  supports commercial fisheries in the tropical and semi-

tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific at depth between 54 - 649 m (Gonzáles-G. 1986). In Portugal 

(Dore 1987) the distribution of P. martia  ranges between 180 and 680 m and experimental 

work done in the Tyrrhenian Sea indicates peaks of abundance between 300 and 600 m on soft 

benthic substrate (Maiorano 2002; Possenti 2007). Another Pandalidae species, Plesionika 

edwardsii, is targeted by trap fisheries in Atlantic Islands, namely the Canary Islands (Arrasate-

López J and González 2012) and in Cabo Verde (Gonzáles 2012). The traps used correspond to 

one of the models used in this study (type C, conic, semi-floating traps), and the gear 

specifications proposed were also taken in consideration in this work. 

All successful fisheries of this type developed in the absence of trawling or even targeted virgin 

stocks, in the case of the oceanic Atlantic islands due to inexistence of a continental platform. 

Given the results obtained in this study, a trap fishery targeting deep water crustaceans using 

semi-floating traps does not seem to be viable on the Portuguese coast, and this may be the 

result of depilated populations due to intensive fishing. 

For the DWS Sobrino et al. (2005) stated that the specie is at least fully exploited or to some 

extent overfished. Supporting the latter is, the importance of DWS for the Portuguese demersal 

trawling fleet in recent years, with catches rising continuously (Table 1, Fig 1). This is not only 

due to the high abundance of the specie during some years, but also because of limitations set 



 

26 

for the other important target species, the Norway lobster. Consequently, the fishing pressure 

for DWS is increasing and with it the mortality on bycatch species, such as the golden shrimp.  

The results of bait comparison for golden shrimp are very interesting. The exploitation of 

golden shrimp in the Atlantic islands is done exclusively with bait composed of fatty fish 

species. In our study, besides fatty fish, chum (minced sardine) and light sticks were also used. 

Chum showed to be more effective than the fish (Table 5), likely due to a more intense and 

easier to disperse odor. This increases the attraction area of the bait and produces higher catches. 

Nevertheless, bait remains a critical issue in trap fisheries because part of it is composed by 

species that are deviated from human consumption and consequently the possibility of using 

light is of the highest importance.  

Light is used in pelagic long line fisheries for the attraction of squid in several fisheries in the 

South West Atlantic. It was also described as an attractant for the capture of krill and small 

crustaceans for scientific purposes (Kawaguchi 1986). This results show the need of scientific 

studies on the use of light as an attractant in crustacean fisheries. The properties of visual 

pigments in DWS and golden shrimp are unknown but Hiller-Adams (1988) determined the 

visual perception of four deepwater shrimp species (Oplophoridae and Penaedea) with similar 

behavior (daily migrations) and overlapping depth spectrum. The maximum of absorbance was 

determined for all species between 450 – 550 nm (blue to green light). The used light during 

this experiment was yellowish therefore on the limit of perception for the named species. It is 

legitimate to assume that better results would be obtained if light sources were improved. 

Simple laboratory experiments could help define more precise wave lengths to attract DWS or 

golden shrimp.  

Also interesting was the fact that both DWS and golden shrimp, when present, showed up in 

clusters up to 10 in the same trap indicating that the distribution is patchy. A similar pattern 

was observed for other crustaceans such as the squat lobster. Patchy distribution are described 

for other bottom crustaceans such as the Norway lobster (Maynou 1998).  

On the bottom, along the South coast the outflow from the Mediterranean Sea is dominating 

the current regime (Zenk and Armi 1990) while in the South-West the predominant currents are 

directed poleward (Frouin et al. 1990). These currents can force the floating traps to lie too 

close to the bottom or generate spinning or erratic movements that can prevent the animals from 

entering the traps or cause a fleeing behavior. This is also supported by the increased scavenger 

activity around the traps in this regions (Fig. 8) 



 

27 

Recent studies stress the risk of overfishing of fast growing populations even though they are 

considered to be more “robust” (Pinsky 2015). The  

The economic exploitation of pandalidae shrimp with traps in the Canary Islands and the Azores 

and prospecting results in Cape Verde, show that healthy stocks allow a n economically viable 

trapping fleet, but that is not possible in direct competition with demersal trawling. An often 

observed phenomena in fisheries is that intensified fishing practices are decreasing population 

abundance to such a degree that more sustainable gears become less viable or impossible 

(Watson et al 2013).  

To comply with the new Common Fisheries Policy and the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, 

the trawling intensity in Portuguese waters should be questioned facing that one of the two most 

important species, the Norway lobster, is considered bellow biologically safe limits by the ICES 

(Council Regulation No 2166/2005), resulting in decreasing TAC s (10% decrease every year 

form 405 tons in 2005 to 168 tons in 2014, with a slight recovery to 206 tons in 20151) and that 

DWS is facing a consistent decline in recent years. Until now the fishery is only managed by 

input measures (limited licenses and closed season) but the rising importance and life cycle 

traits of short lived species it should be considered to implement some kind of population 

assessment like in fisheries for DWS in the South-Central Mediterrenean to avoid overfishing 

or a collapse (Knittweiss et al. 2013) 

The exploitation of deep water crustaceans with trawling is also relevant for the bycatch 

Campos et al. (2002) and Fonseca et al. (2005) proposed different mesh configuration and 

bycatch reduction devices with little acceptance from the producers. It should be stressed that 

crustacean fisheries provide food catering the high value markets, with little nutritive value and 

at the same cause great environmental damage decreasing the sustainability of other fishing 

gears such as the fixed gears used by the polyvalent fleet. This is the case of hake, caught and 

discarded in large amounts by the crustacean fleet (Borges et al. 2001), while the hake fishery 

with fixed gears was severely limited (Council Regulation No 2166/2005).

5. Conclusion 
 

The system of exploitation and management of fisheries resources has been maintained in the 

present state for decades, with little changes. Policy action is needed to resolve the situation. 

One way could be the implementation of additional areas restricted to trawling and marine 

protected areas, especially outside the six miles limit. This would allow the establishment of 

base line studies to understand the effect of trawling and the setting of reference points. 

Trawling is a technologically simple process, by sweeping the seafloor all organisms living on 

or near the ground are swilled inside the net. All in all the only ecological factor important is to 

know the whereabouts of the species. To use more sustainable passive gears, such as longlines 

or traps, sophisticated knowledge about the animal behavior, nutrition and life cycle 

information are needed. The efficiency of these fisheries depends largely on the knowledge of 

these factors and the resulting métiers are highly specific and consequently very selective 

towards the target species ad sizes. To introduce more sustainable fishing practices, knowledge 

of the ecology and behavior of the target species is required and financial and technical 

assistance for experimental work should be provided.  

Further laboratory experiments and field work are needed, for both species discussed. Video 

observations and current measurements should be incorporated in future experiments to 

determine more precisely the behavior of the traps and target species. Studies on the daily 

migration and feeding cycle of DWS are also important as well as the behavior of the species 

in relation to light.
