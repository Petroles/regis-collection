Abstract 

 

In collaboration with Coopérnico, the first RES Cooperative in Portugal, this work has as one of 

its main goals to understand the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in the future of 

the liberalised energy sector not only across Europe, but particularly in Portugal. Moreover, 

based on the experience shared by several RES Cooperatives, including the closer look at the 

selected four case studies (The Co-operative Energy in the United Kingdom, Ecopower in 

Belgium, EWS in Germany and Som Energia in Spain), this work came up with a set of 

recommendations for any RES Cooperative that intends to become a new electricity supplier in 

its national territory. For instance, the study allows to identify the main reasons why RES 

Cooperatives are becoming a solid alternative solution to the traditional energy companies, the 

main barriers a RES Cooperative faces during its electricity retailing supply process, as well as 

a role of solution that may help to overcome these possible obstacles. 

Based on these findings, and with the aim to transform Coopérnico in the first green electricity 

supplier in Portugal, the work also extends to the full characterisation of the Portuguese 

electricity sector, including the compilation of all the steps and requirements to become a new 

electricity supplier in Portugal.  

Although the Coopérnico’s electricity retailing supply process has already been initiated with 

the assignment of registration of electricity supplier by The Directorate General for Energy and 

Geology (DGEG), the final step will only be given after the Coopérnico’s General Assembly in 

mid-December 2014. Then, it will be discussed and assessed the different options available and 

voted the path to take for the missing process.

Resumo 

 

Em colaboração com a Coopérnico, a primeira cooperativa de energias renováveis em Portugal, 

este trabalho propõe-se a estudar o papel que as cooperativas de energias renováveis podem vir 

a ter no futuro do mercado liberalizado, na Europa e em Portugal. Para além disso, com base na 

análise da experiência partilhada por vários cooperativas europeias de energias renováveis, 

incluindo os quatro casos de estudo seleccionados para este trabalho (The Co-operative Energy 

no Reino Unido a Ecopower na Bélgica, a EWS na Alemanha e a Som Energia na Espanha), 

este trabalho pretende também reunir um conjunto de recomendações para uma cooperativa de 

energias renováveis poder entrar com sucesso no mercado liberalizado de electricidade. Entre os 

vários parâmetros analisados, o estudo permite identificar as principais razões pelas quais as 

cooperativas de energias renováveis estão cada vez mais a tornar-se numa alternativa concreta 

às tradicionais empresas de energia, as principais barreiras que as cooperativas de energias 

renováveis enfrentam no decorrer do seu processo de comercialização de electricidade, bem 

como um leque de possíveis soluções que as podem ajudar a superar estes obstáculos. 

Com base nestes resultados, e com o objectivo de transformar a Coopérnico no primeiro 

comercializador de electricidade verde em Portugal, o trabalho propõe-se igualmente a 

caracterizar o panorama do sector eléctrico português, incluindo a compilação de todos os 

passos e requisitos que uma cooperativa de energias renováveis necessita cumprir para se tornar 

num comercializador de electricidade em Portugal. 

Embora o processo de comercialização de eletricidade da Coopérnico já tenha sido iniciado, 

com a atribuição do registo de comercializador de electricidade pela Direcção-Geral de Energia 

e Geologia (DGEG), o passo final só será dado após Assembleia Geral da Coopérnico que 

ocorrerá em meados de Dezembro de 2014 onde serão avaliadas as diferentes opções possíveis e 

votado o caminho a seguir para o que resta do processo.

Acknowledgements 

 

Well, whilst I write down the final notes of this work, i'm gradually taking conscious that the 

next time i switch off my laptop will be the end of the most important step of my academic 

background so far. Thus, by way of tribute to all those who helped me out achieve this goal, I 

would like to dedicate this page.  

  

I would first like to acknowledge the support of my family, since the moment I was born they 

were always there for me. Without them, none of this would be possible. 

 

Right after, it is time to acknowledge also the support of my friends. From the special support I 

get constantly over 1000 km away, in Girona, to the daily support of the good old friends I 

thank you all guys. By the way, it has been really nice to notice your growing interest for the 

cooperative movement, particularly Coopérnico, as well as the importance to contribute to a 

new energetic paradigm.    

 

Focusing now in the work itself, I would like acknowledge my supervisors for guiding me in 

this project. Besides their contribution throughout the work, I would like also to highlight the 

enthusiam we’ve shared for the purpose behind the work. We truly believe that it will serve the 

community. Furthermore, I would like to thank the people of the Coopérnico and Boa Energia 

for all the support, and having the best working environment that I have ever experienced.   

 

Moreover, I would like to thank to all the RES Cooperatives. Firstly, for their daily and 

meaningful effort to promote the long term sustainable development and the energy transition, 

and secondly for the willingness to help me and share their knowledge and experience with me.  

  

At a time of global recession, my expectations for the future are the best. Yes, I do know there 

will be very ups and downs in my life. However, with respect to the professional career i believe 

I’ve got all the tools to be well succeed. For this I thank FCUL, for the time spent there, 

professors and classmates for the all I’ve learned.  

 

Finally, I would like to thank you dear reader. I hope that in the end of your reading you may 

share the feeling that together we can contribute to a world where clean, renewable energy is the 

established method for powering energy efficient, environmentally friendly, healthy to resilent 

communities. As John said, imagine…

1. Introduction 

Since 1996, several legislative measures have been adopted by the EU members, addressing 

market access, transparency and regulation, consumer protection, supporting interconnection 

capacity between countries, and security of supply, with the aim to liberalise and create 

common rules for the achievement of an European Internal Energy Market (IEM). As a 

consequence of such measures, gradually the barriers and trading obstacles are being eliminated, 

allowing the entry of new electricity suppliers in the markets of EU members and, consequently, 

the possibility to industrial and domestic consumers freely choose the offer that better fits their 

consumption patterns.    

Besides the natural harmonisation of the European energy sector, the environmental issues and 

the social economy are also other main concerns in Europe for this century that has already 

started. Thereby, and intending to speed up the process of energy transition and covering the 

apparent failure in the approximation of tax policies, as well as the reduction of costs and 

energy pricing charged to European end-users, it has risen in some European countries the 

emergence of a new generation of social organisations with new business models based on 

renewable energy sources (RES) and the promotion of a sustainable development. 

Regardin the Portugal’s case, the social discontent by the current European energy paradigm is 

also noticeable, which in late 2013 led to the creation of Coopérnico, the first RES Cooperative 

in the country.  

 

Driven to understand the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in the future of the 

liberalised energy sector not only across Europe, but particularly in Portugal, and be a 

successful guide for any RES Cooperative that aims to get in the national electricity retail 

market, besides the current chapter, this work is divided into five main chapters: 

 

As baseline for the work, chapter 2 characterised the three European directives wishing to 

harmonise and liberalise the European IEM. Nevertheless, the chapter starts with a brief 

historical description about the energy market deregulation worldwide, focusing then in the pre 

and post European electricity market deregulation. 

 

Chapter 3 is dedicated to the evolution of the cooperative movement, particularly of the energy 

Cooperatives. Thus, in here it is studied the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in 

the future of the European energy sector, including the reasons behind the revival of the energy 

cooperatives as well as the main challenges these social enterprises face in the current energy 

model. Finally, it is analysed the need of a new EU energy legislation that protects and 

promotes the growth of RES Cooperatives in the future of EU energy transition.  

 

In chapter 4, it is characterised four different European electricity markets. For each market it 

was chosen a social enterprise that demonstrates that this cooperative phenomenon has been a 

success. The selected examples were: The Co-operative Energy in the United Kingdom, 

Ecopower in Belgium, EWS in Germany  and Som Energia in Spain.  

With the help of these four case studies, and the experience of many other RES Cooperatives 

such as Enerplus, NLD Energie, DE Unie, Enercoop, Zencer, Nosa Enerxía, Greanpeace Energy 

and GoiEner it is possible to identify a set of references and best practices that may help, with 

success, any national RES Cooperative entering in the energy market.

Chapter 5 focus on the evolution of the portuguese electricity system. Besides the overall review 

regarding the legislative framework behind the liberalisation of the portuguese electricity 

market, in this part of the work it is also done a full characterisation of the national electricity 

market, including the current energy companies operating on it. 

Moreover, using the Coopérnico’s process as reference, the chapter compile all the steps and 

necessary requirements for a RES Cooperative that aims to become a new electricity supplier in 

Portugal.  

 

Finally, chapter 6 provides the concluding remarks of the all the previous chapters, including 

the reasons for failure to create an unified, competitive European energy market. Nevertheless, 

this long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has brought a new interest in the 

cooperative model. Thus, besides presenting a review behind the emergence of RES 

Cooperatives, this chapter also indentifies the reasons why these social enterprises are becoming 

a solid alternative solution to the traditional energy companies. 

 

2. Energy Market Deregulation 

2.1. Towards World Energy Market Deregulation 

Since the birth of the European Community, energy has always been considered a key point of 

the political agenda of the region and, consequently, has seen heavy government intervention, 

both through public ownership and regulatory reforms. On the bases of this intervention are 

essential the nature of power supply in the economy and the natural monopoly features of the 

energy sector.  

 

In the past three decades, emerging and developed countries have been through privatisation, 

restructuring and deregulation programs in sectors that historically were regulated monopolies 

and/or state-owned, such as airline transportation, telecommunications, railway, package 

delivery services, among others. Energy is no exception and, over the same period, this sector 

has been going through a time of change worldwide with the implementations of progressive 

reforms. The motivation for the energy market deregulation were driven mostly by economic 

reasons, political ideology on the faith of market forces, distaste for strong unions, the desire to 

attach foreign investment and, since the nineties,  environmental concerns [1]. 

 

Just focusing on energy sector, the first step towards electricity deregulation was made in the 

USA in the late seventies, and just then diffused to the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, 

to the European continent. But what triggered that move?  

The most important of the factors was financial. The oil embargo of the mid-seventies led to 

serious downturns in many countries economies, which by the early eighties were burdened by 

foreign debt, budget shortfalls and inflation. Macroeconomic and fiscal depression forced 

governments to implement economy-wide structural adjustment programs, with the goal of 

reducing public spending and increasing private capital flows into the economy [2].

Historically, the cost of power production declined as utilities1 built ever-larger power plants. 

With the population growth the electricity demand increased requiring more and larger plants, 

which reduced even further the costs as well as increasing the utility rate base. Consumers had 

abundant low-cost electricity; regulators oversaw declining rates, increased electrification and 

economic growth. Meanwhile the utilities and stockholders saw their money grow. Thus, we 

can say this era was a win-win situation for everyone. 

The problem came when the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) cut 

off the oil supply to the world. Rapid increases in the cost of fuel to operate power plants were 

equally translated in the retail power prices. The United States of America (USA) made efforts 

to decouple the electricity system from the world petroleum market through the construction of 

nuclear and coal-fired plants, which are more expensive than simple oil or natural gas-fired 

plants. Consequently, the fixed costs of utility operations increased, further increasing retail 

electricity prices and naturally it led to consumer complaints and the need of new regulatory 

reforms [2]. 

 

By that time, USA were the largest energy market in the world so, as expected, the first move 

towards electricity deregulation was made by the Americans, with the introduction of the Public 

Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978. Briefly, this legislation stated a new class of 

non-utility generators who could build small power plants and co-generation facilities, known as 

qualifying facilities and the entrance of new market players called Independent Power 

Producers. Under PURPA, public utilities were required to buy energy from those power 

producers at a price equal to the “avoided cost” of the utility. The main goal of this law was to 

provide increased conservation of electricity, increased efficiency in the use of public power 

plants and ressources by electric utilities and equitable retail for electric consumers [2][4]. With 

PURPA, the private producer concept has born and a window opportunity for the global energy 

market was open.   

 

The economic consequences of those measures were felt extremely quickly and in the early 

eighties the worldwide discussion on energy markets reform has started. Several emerging and 

developed countries have commenced reform initiates including liberalisation, privatisation, and 

restructuring of the energy supply and distribution industry. In the front row was Chile, setting 

up a wholesale market pool in which power plants would sell their power to retailers, and 

introducing a law in 1982 allowing industrial consumers to choose their retailer and negotiate 

their prices freely [5].  

 

Some years later, the European market reform started with the British experience. The success 

and innovation of the new British market inspired the European Union (EU) energy strategy and 

became the main driver for further developments. 

 

By 1990, United Kingdom (UK) began the restructuring process with the opening of their 

wholesale market to the competition, by unbundling transmission from generation and splitting 

generation into several companies. Retail market were opened up in stages, immediately 

beginning with the largest industrial and commercial users and concluding with the opening of 

its residential market in early 1999. We can say the greatest achievement of the British

 Despite the different definitions and concept about public utility, when we compare the USA and 

European countries, typically a utility provides a commodity or service that is considered essential to the 

ordinary people such water, natural gas or, in this case power. Because utility service is a vital need, it has 

been considered to be in the public interest to regulate its provision [3].

deregulation was their utilities allowing direct access by letting any type of users choose a 

power supplier competitively and pay the utility only for distribution service. Under 

restructuring, utilities may provide combined billing for both the distribution service and for the 

power [6]. The pioneering nature of the changes in the UK, along with the perceived success of 

the reforms meant that the “British model” was often used as an archetype for redesigns of other 

markets, including the modern restructuring of the USA electricity system in 1992 with the first 

Energy Policy Act, which allowed non-utility generators and marketers to compete in the same 

nascent wholesale markets as traditional vertically-integrated utilities [7]. 

 

Along with the UK deregulation, something was happening in the Northern Europe, more 

precisely in Norway, with the established of a non-full privatisation electricity market in 1991. 

The main difference between both markets is that UK deregulation was based on integral 

privatisation while the Norway reform not, meaning that despite the common wholesale market, 

the retail markets have remained national. Later this energy market was extended to incorporate 

Sweden, Denmark and Finland forming the world’s first multi-national electricity market, called 

Nord Pool. [8] 

 

With energy reforms and, consequently, competition spreading through some European 

countries, the EU decided to adopt a pro-competitive framework that would turn the several EU 

member-states' energy markets into a unique single European market, that will be explored in 

the following section. Aiming to achieve a free and open energy sector, since the mid-nineties 

the EU has been continuing releasing some legislative package with common energy directives 

for the EU members. However, and in accordance with the White Paper
2
 and the Green 

Papers
3
, the approach of the EU in terms of restructuring energy markets has a broader 

perspective, which includes besides a developing a more competitive Internal Energy Market 

(IEM), security of supply and sustainability [1].  

  

In conclusion, the eighties and nineties were marked by the formulation and launching of 

several deregulation trends that paved the way for electric utility deregulation as we know 

today. Now that we have an overview about the history of the world energy market 

deregulation, let’s focus on the electricity market deregulation in EU. 

 

2.2. Electricity Market Deregulation in European Union 

Realising that liberalisation and competition would result in internal and external efficiency, 

based on the UK and other European countries’ experiences, and that the benefits would be 

passed on to users and the economy in the form of lower prices and better allocation of costs, 

the European Commission (EC) set up efforts to bring to life the idea of a single energy 

European market. Moreover, the EC published in 1988 its first concrete proposal on that way, 

                                                      
2 According to the glossary of EU legislation, Commission White Papers are documents containing 

proposals for Community action in a specific area. In some cases they follow a Green Paper published to 

launch a consultation process at European level. When a White Paper is favourably received by the 

Council, it can lead to an action programme for the Union in the area concerned. In this particular case, 

the specified White Paper is about “Completion of the Internal Market” (1985) [10]. 

3 The same glossary states Green Papers are documents published by the EC to stimulate discussion on 

given topics at European level. They invite the relevant parties to participate in a consultation process and 

debate on the basis of the proposals they put forward. Green Papers may give rise to legislative 

developments that are then outlined in White Papers. Again, in this particular case, the speficied Green 

Papers are “The Protection of Utility Models in the Single Market”  and “Innovation” (1995) [10].

with the working document entitled “The Internal Energy Market”.  According to this 

document, the EC was committed to create an EU-wide integrated energy market by removal of 

all existing and potential technical and fiscal barriers that difficult the trade of energy products 

within the Community [9].  

 

The document made references to some points towards a common energy policy (Figure 1), 

including the removal of differences between countries, open competition between suppliers at a 

European level, price regulation, environment protection or the connection of EU members' 

energy transportation grids so the European energy system can “work” as a whole [9]. 

 

 

Figure 1. Ideas behind the creation of the internal energy market 

 

To achieve this such desired IEM, it was set four actions [9]: 

 

? Carrying out of the provisions concerning the energy sector in the 1985 White Book;  
? The determined application by the EC of the provisions of Community Law;   
? The attainment of a satisfactory equilibrium energy/environment;  
? Definition of appropriate means, to be selected case by case, in areas specifically related 

to energy policy. 

 

In the light of the first point, the 1985 White Book aims are the removal of technical barriers 

(whether they concern the harmonisation of rules and technical norms between EU members or 

the opening up of public procurement) and the removal of fiscal barriers (notably by the 

approximation of indirect taxation).  

To keep and reinforce the internal market, in particular to ensure freedom of movement, the EC 

suggest a strong competition policy. Therefore, guided by the same outlines in the White Book 

on the internal market the EC defined four sets of instruments, including those which ensure the 

free circulation of goods and services, those in respect of state monopolies of a commercial 

character, the rules of competition and the state aids.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

21 

 

In relation to the environment protection, it was submitted some proposals to reduce emission 

standards for all type of combustion plants. Also, the EC believes that an unified energy market 

is just possible with an harmonisation of safety standards and their applications, though those 

applications could bring effects to the cost of producing and using energy.   

Finally, according to this document, two areas emerge as priorities: energy prices and 

infrastructures.  

The development of energy trade depends on energy prices, costs and tariffs, which vary 

between Member-States (MS). In order to bring transparency to market, the EC intend to submit 

a detailed comparative analysis of energy prices plus conclusions and proposals regarding 

transparency of prices, in particular for large industrial users, an examination of the price 

structure in the MS, including the conditions, costs and pricing principles applied to transfers of 

energy, and in conjunction with the parties concerned, an examination of the cost structures in 

the various energy sectors and assess these cost structures.  

The existence of adequate infrastructure is a cornerstone for the transfer of energy and hence a 

prerequisite with a view to securing flexibility, greater security of supply, and in the final 

analysis a more integrated Community energy market. Despite the considerable networks for 

electricity, natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products, the EC intend to go further in this area 

with the prospect of the IEM, but always in mind that infrastructure operations must satisfy the 

minimum economic and commercial viability criteria and these operations, in which costs are 

importants, should be major factors presupposes that must be encouraged.  

 

Introduced the working document, it is time to understand what is on the roots of the European 

electricity market deregulation.  If the text above is dissected quickly came across the idea that 

there were three considerations behind the paper (Figure 2): 

 

 

Figure 2. The main reasons behind the 1985 White Book 

 

Electricity market opening was originally aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of European 

industry against external industries, particularly Japan and the USA. Inspired by the 

liberalisation experiments all over the world, which are very different in terms of the design and 

organisation of the electricity market, the EC aimed with this document to develop its own 

model to improve efficiency, to create a more competitive energy-producing industry, to ensure 

security of supply and to attract new investors. 

 

Related with the political motives are the economic reasons, in the way European firms are 

competing against other manufacturers or service-providers which operate on the basis of 

different economic factors and inputs. Hopefully, with the free access to energy sources under 

competitive market prices should contribute to the reduction of costs for firms. This reduction 

can thus lead to greater competitiveness of European firms on the international asset markets, as 

long as other countries don’t succeed in reducing their energy costs by even bigger margins. 

 

Finally, there is a reason, of legal nature, which supports the establishment of the IEM once the 

legal instruments available to the EC are no different from those which allow the realisation of 

Europe without frontiers.

By the Article 8a of the EEC Treaty (Single European Act) the single market is defined as: 

 

“…an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services 

and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty “ 

 

Article 8a EEC Treaty   

 

That means, the free flow of merchandise, the free offering of services and the right to set up 

anywhere in the EU are applicable to energy products and services related with them. 

 

Despite the significant efforts made by the EC to promote these guidelines, the truth is that it 

was required an adequate legislative framework that gradually incorporated elements of 

liberalisation and energy activities within the EU members, which came in 1992, with the 

celebration of the Maastricht Treaty (formally, the Treaty on European Union).  

From that moment on, the progress of constructing competitive Europe-wide electricity market 

accelerated very rapidly and after four years of negotiations on energy policy guidelines, the 

decisive breakthrough was achieved with the adoption in 1996 of the Directive 96/92/EC, 

concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity.  

 

Nevertheless, and despite this important mark towards European energy market deregulation, 

the final objective was, and still it’s today, far from being complete, due to the significant 

differences between EU members regarding the energy market development. 

 

The next section explores the obstacles that slowed down the progress of the IEM, particularly 

the establishment of public utilities and natural monopolies within each national energy system, 

which naturally limit competition and create cautious markets. 

 

2.3. European Electricity Market 

In order to better understand the deregulation process it is necessary to analyse how the 

European energy market operates before and after deregulation. 

On the contrary of the other commodities, the energy market has quite unique characteristics 

(Figure 3). Electricity represents a product that cannot be differentiated in terms of quality or 

features, it cannot be stored and its cost is heterogeneous depending mostly on the way it is 

produced. Also, the demand of electricity is highly inelastic and as it has no substitutes, the 

supplier must be sure he can deliver as much electricity as it is required at any given moment. 

Finally, the transmission and distribution of electricity depend on the distance, but also on the 

resistance in the networks. That means, in the case of congested network infrastructures, it is 

possible that inefficient generators located in a particular location could provide cheaper 

electricity than efficient generators in other place.  

Due to all these factors, the energy sector has been organised as a state-owned monopoly in 

most European countries and the liberalisation process can often be quite complex [11].

Figure 3. Characteristics of the electricity 

 

The fact that the electricity sector is considered extremely important for the economic 

development for all other sectors justified  as well the intervention of the government, through 

direct and indirect State subsidies to maintain a stable industry.  

 

Since the adoption in 1996 of the First Directive, and despite the countless directives with 

specific deadlines for the full European market liberalisation, the context is far from the once 

desired integral energy market open to competition. In spite the previously mentioned security 

of supply and the complexity of this commodity, there were also other reasons for failure to 

create an unified, competitive energy market [12]:  

  

? Deliberate government interference motivated by a desire to support the main players in 
each electricity market; 

? Lack of interest by dominant players or governments to build additional transmission 
lines to facilitate cross-border trade; 

? Weak enforcement of EU directives at country level. 

 

Looking back, it is safe to say, the European energy market liberalisation has reached different 

levels as each EU members approached the process in their own way [11]. While a number of 

countries followed the path of liberalisation in order to maintain the community proserity, 

evolution, international competitiveness and economic growth, others have done so only on 

paper and preferred to maintain the government monopoly [13]. 

  

Twenty-five years ago electricity sector was a heavily regulated industry in almost all MS, 

dominated by national or regional, vertically integrated monopolies engaged all the four sectors, 

as generation, transmission, distribution and supply networks (Figure 4). In other words, they 

were the main actors from generation through distribution and supply to final consumers. 

 

 

Figure 4. Fully state-owned energy market 

 

Understanding this situation could not carry on, the EC began to challenge the existence of 

monopolies and exclusive rights, on the grounds that they made the existence of an IEM 

impossible. Nevertheless, at the time there was no realistic chance of getting the agreement of 

all or probably even a qualified majority of EU members to discuss the liberalisation of the 

European energy at the Community level and, for that reason, the EC decided to use the Articles

of the EEC Treaty relating to competition law and the rules on free movement to force MS to 

abandon these monopolies. 

As mentioned above, there were no special provisions on energy policy. Despite various EEC 

Treaties, for instance those relating to approximation of laws, the common commercial policy, 

consumer protection, economic and social cohesion, environment, taxation, and, once again, 

competition, free movement and the internal market, none were applicable to the energy sector 

or provided scope for Community instruments capable of triggering significant effects on its 

administration. 

 

However, by the Article 90, the EEC Treaty stated that [14]: 

 

“undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having 

the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in this 

Treaty, in particular to the rules on competition,  insofar as the application  of such rules does 

not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the  particular tasks assigned to them. The 

development of trade must  not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the 

interests of the Community.” 

 

EEC Treaty, Article 90, Part Three, Title VI, Chapter 1, Section 1 

 

And supported by the ex Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) 

[15]:  

 

“Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or 

in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market  insofar as 

it may affect trade between Member States.” 

 

Such abuse may, in particular, consist in: 

 

(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading 

conditions; 

(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; 

(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent with other trading parties, thereby placing them 

at a competitive disadvantage; 

(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of  

supplementary which, by their nature or according to commercial usage,  have no connection 

with the subject of such contracts.” 

 

TEC, Article 82, Part three, Title VII,  Chapter 1, Section 1 

 

The EC argued that monopoly rights disrespected the EEC Treaty requirements on the free 

movement of goods and establishment. Moreover, the EC further alleged that monopolies were

not even necessary to achieve essential public service objectives and because of that, slowly, EU 

members vertically owned companies’ rights have been successfully challenged. 

 

Thereby, forced by the EC, most EU members started the deregulation of the electricity market 

by adapting the European directives to their own legislation. It must be pointed out that in some 

countries liberalisation of the sector began before the release of the First Directive framework 

and later modified certain aspects of their own laws in order to accommodate certain European 

rules.  

Just focusing on the opening up of the market, each EU country is a special case in itself, even 

though they are all rapidly moving towards total opening.   

 

The best European example is the UK market, followed close by the Noord Pool (Scandinavia 

market). Actually, these markets were the firsts to be fully functional and liberalised as already 

remarked.  

Regarding to the most competitive market in the EU, the level of consumer participation in the 

UK energy supply markets is among the highest of any market in the entire world, where almost 

all users (96%) know that they can change energy suppliers and most (70%) feel confident that 

they know how to do this. 

Although also liberalised, the Noord Pool however is not fully privatised. In fact, public 

ownerships is still dominating the region. A few major power producers have a dominating 

position in their national markets but none has a big share (more than 20%) of the Noord Pool. 

Basically, it shows that the degree of integration increases the level of competition among the 

market players and it is reflected on the high level of consumer participation [1]. 

 

Besides these markets, there is another important market in Europe, the Continental European 

market. Within this market there are several regional groups, which differ in their features. 

Among the EU members that are part of this huge market, the first to be fully liberalised was 

Germany. Germany started the liberalisation process around 1998 with the First Directive of EC 

- promotion of diversification of energy supply, reduction of energy costs and improvement of 

energy efficiency and development of renewable energy sources (RES). As part of the Central 

European model of organisation, in Germany there was never a national electric monopoly 

established under the government. However, though a big number of energy suppliers were 

active on the German electricity market before the deregulation started, the market was not 

highly competitive [13].  

There are also two particular markets that are worth mention: the Italian market and the French 

market.  

In the beginning, France has preferred to follow the minimum steps required by the EU in terms 

of deregulation. Thus, the deregulation process started only in 1999 but the level of state 

protection was still very high, postponing all the process evolution. However, the status of the 

main supplier EDF, which had a market share of 98%, started being challenged around 2004, 

and the French’s electricity market was slowly open to liberalisation [13]. 

The Italian case is quite similar to the French as there is also a main supplier, ENEL, that has 

been ruling the market for a long time, despite the several difference showed by the Italian 

electricity market since the adoption of the First Directive framework, in 1999. For instance, the 

creation of a public company, Gestore della Rete di Transmissione Nazionale, responsible for 

operating and crrying out the required maintenance and development of the national network 

[4].

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Keeping in the same region, Austria’s electricity market was partly opened to liberalisation in 

1999, then the whole market was liberalised in the beginning of the century and a voluntary 

energy spot  market of Austria – EXAA – was established [1]. 

The Benelux countries, Netherlands and Belgium, transposed the First Directive to their laws in 

1998 and 1999, respectively, and at the moment both have an almost 100% fully deregulated 

elecricity system.  

Regarding the Iberian countries, Portugal and Spain, together they set up the common Iberian 

electricity market, MIBEL, in order to open up their market to competition. In the context of the 

markets liberalisation processes, where the activities of the network operators are considered 

natural monopolies and are therefore subjected to economic regulation, the production and 

selling of electricity are open to competition [16].  

 

 

Figure 5. EU’s electricity market deregulation by 2007 [17] 

 

With the adoption of the Second Directive, all EU members opened up their electricity markets 

to competition. By 1st of July 2007, the deadline stated by the document to implement this 

action, only 13 countries had opened their markets to competition.  

Thus, even though most of European consumers are now free to choose their electricity 

supplier, this does not mean that energy markets have been fully deregulated. In fact, only ten 

countries had completed total deregulation by 2007 (Figure 5). But what is preventing the total 

deregulation across Europe? 

 

Basically, there are several types of price controls in place in some national electricity markets 

which hinder pricing and competition. Moreover, certain countries are striving to control their 

domestic energy assets and support their so called national champions [18].  



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

27 

 

The latest Directive (Directive 2009/72/EC) can be the response to these issues. In order to 

Europe finally reach the desired common energy market, the document proposes energy 

companies engaged in both electricity generation and transmission must either sell off their 

entire transmission business, or they may retain ownership rights but will be forced to outsource 

transmission activities to Independent System Operators. The directive also proposes the 

establishment of a joint European energy regulator and that network oversight rules be made 

more uniform.  

  

Summarising the European market structure, the completion of the IEM by 2014, the latest 

published deadline, is far from being achieved. Although national market structures have 

changed in the last decades, only a few countries have a fully deregulated electricity market, 

making the European electricity market quite heterogeneous. 

From one side, UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany had fully (or very close 

to fully) deregulated electricity market, whilst on the other side there are countries, like France, 

Italy, Portugal, with national monopolies and public ownerships. In between there is a range of 

mixed cases, including most of the countries that follow the Central European model 

organisational market. That means, a mix between public and private capital. 

 

2.4. The Internal Electricity Market Directives 

Looking back to European IEM legislation it is possible to identify a pattern of successive 

waves regarding to liberalisation legislation. A new reform package has been introduced every 

six years, after the EC has come to the conclusion that the existing regulatory framework does 

not go far enough towards the IEM. But why is that? 

 

The repeated amendments to the legislation is caused by the continuing failure, reflect of 

differences in EU members’ approaches to the implementation of the directives, and of the 

failure to prevent the established monopolies with regard to market entry, market exit and 

pricing. 

 

 

Figure 6. Evolution of the European Internal Electricity Market Directives 

  

So far, the EU has adopted three different legislation packages (Figure 6), including 

accompanying regulation. The First Directive, adopted in 1996 concerning common rules for 

the establishment of an European IEM was followed by a further electricity directive. The 

Second Directive, adopted in 2003, was a more complex framework having as ultimate goal to 

set up the legal frame for full market liberalisation. Plus, attached to the directive there was a 

regulation named 1228/2003/EC, focused on issues such as the network access for cross-border 

energy trading. The Third Directive, adopted in 2009, was the last framework released. This 

document, also known as the Third Package, amended the existing legislation and supported the

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

28 

 

further opening of the energy markets and established an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy 

Regulators (ACER) by way of a regulation (Regulation(EC) 713/2009).      

 

2.4.1. The First Directive 

The Directive 96/92/EC is known for being the kick starter of the liberalisation in the European 

electricity sector. This set of legislation introduced, for the first time, common rules for the 

organisation of the sector, and established progressive market opening with the submission of  

pioneering measures in all areas of activity (generation, transmission, distribution and supply) 

[19].  

 

Basically the First Directive’s most important issue was the split between competitive sectors, 

as generation and retail supply, from the natural monopoly activities of transmission and 

distribution networks (non-competitive sectors) (Figure 7 and 8).  

 

From: 

 

Figure 7. The European Electricity System pre liberalisation 

 

To: 

 

Figure 8. The European Electricity System post the First Directive 

  

As European electricity vertically integrated firms commonly owned all the four areas of 

activity, the EC introduced some measures to prevent the risk that these companies would use 

their ownership of the network to unfairly give advantage to their generation and/or retail 

supply business, including:  

 

? Introduction of independent entities group, transmission and distribution system 
operators (TSO and DSO, respectively), which would determine and control the access 

to the networks. Moreover, the firms which owned the transmission and/or distribution 

systems would be responsible for operating, ensuring the maintenance of the network in 

a non-discriminatory way, and, if necessary, work as a public utility (Article 7 to 12); 

? Vertical unbundling: Obligation for vertically integrated firms to keep, in their internal 
accounting and management systems, the activities of generation, transmission, 

distribution and retail supply as separated and independent sectors (Articles 13 and 14).   

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

29 

 

With regard to transmission and distribution networks, and to enable generators and suppliers to 

get their power to final consumers there were measures to ensure all competitors would be able 

to get non-discriminatory access to the network. Thus, the First Directive introduced the concept 

of Third-Party Access (TPA), in which each EU member can choose the access to the network 

system among three options (Articles 17 to 19): 

 

? Negotiated TPA: Generators and suppliers had to negotiate with the TSO and DSO for 
the access to the networks; 

? Regulated TPA: Basically, the access to the network has fixed tariffs. The tariffs are 
published by the relevant authorities, and applied to all users of the network; 

? Single buyer: It is defined as the legal entity that gathers all the responsibility regarding 
to the network, including the single administration and running of transmission and 

distribution networks and/or for the centralised purchase and sale of electricity. 

 

Moreover, the access to the network systems can only be refused when there is not enough 

capacity to transport the electricity or when transport would make it impossible to carry out 

public services obligations. 

 

Concerning generation, the document, from Article 4 to 6, stated that EU members must follow 

between two procedures regarding the construction of new power plants: 

 

? Authorisation: With this procedure, anyone can build a power plant whenever and 
wherever they wanted, provided it complied with planning law and its features, 

inclunding the safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the 

environment, energy efficiency, among others;  

? Tendering: The electricity system would continue to be centrally planned. Therefore, 
an official body would set the amount of capacity that need to be built and replaced in 

the country, and the specifications tenders bidders would need to meet.  

 

Regarding to the supply activity, there was changes too. Thus, the First Directive, through 

Article 19, required the EU members to gradually open up their electricity markets. Thus, it was 

introduced, firstly, competition in the wholesale markets (the large consumers), through three 

stages: 

 

? By February 1999, about 26% (40 GWh/year) of the market had to be open; 
? By February 2000, about 28% (20 GWh/year) of the market had to be open; 
? By February 2003, about 1/3 (9 GWG) of the market had to be open.

Figure 9. Main features of the First Directive 

 

Finally, concerning regulation, the document did not provided any appointment regarding, for 

instance, an independent authority, which should be responsible to resolve disputes between 

companies in each sector, nor the verification of the tariffs established by the TSO and DSO. 

Moreover, the document notwithstanding the reduction of monopoly to the network operation, 

did not provided also any jurisdiction over ownership rights. 

 

Although the document established basic rules (Figure 9), which the EU members have to 

incorporate in their legislation,  

 

“Member States shall ensure (…) that (…) electricity undertakings are operated in accordance 

with the principles of this Directive, with a view to achieving a competitive market in 

electricity, and shall not discriminate between these undertakings as regards either rights or 

obligations.“

it also gave a certain degree of freedom for EU members to apply the guidelines since the 

different choices led to equivalent economic results, as well as similar level of opening and 

access to the electricity markets. The First Directive does not impose a single rigid new market 

structure but sets out the minimum conditions under which sector can be developed.   

Thereby, as a result, instead of having an harmonised IEM, as desired by the EEC Treaty, the 

EU members pursued different liberalisation and regulatory strategies, leading then to the 

development of many individual liberalised markets.   

 

Moreover, as expected, over time it became obvious that the introduction of competition and its 

measures (general obligation not to discriminate, to preserve the confidentiality of commercially 

sensitive information, to negotiate in good faith, among others) was not enough to address the 

lack of regulation.   

Adding to the technical and regulatory issues arising from the idea of cross-border trade in an 

European IEM, that simply was not approached, the need for a new framework was evident 

(Figure 10), and in 2003 came out the first amendment to the document. 

 

 

Figure 10. Main issues deriving from the First Directive 

 

2.4.2. The Second Directive 

Due to the circumstances previously stated, the EC was forced to bring forward new legislative 

measures aiming not only to accelerate the market opening, evening then the liberalisation 

among the EU members, but it also reply to the criticisms on network access and regulation, and 

took away the less liberal options presented in the First Directive.   

  

Thereby, the new framework ( Directive 2003/54/EC) established more common rules for the 

four areas of activity (Figure 12), and included some extra contents such as safeguard measures 

or provisions on regulation [20].  

 

Basically, all of the measures stated in this document were intended to provide a framework for 

cross-border trading. In fact, international energy trade assumed a much more important role in 

the Second Directive and promoting construction of interconnectors between national systems 

seemed to become an end in itself, rather than a means, for instance, to enhance security or to 

promote competition (Article 23).

integrated companies were far from decreasing

At the end, with the adoption of this new framework, it was expected the European electricity 

system evolved to (Figure 11): 

  

 

Figure 11. The European Electricity System post the Second Directive 

     

Thus, and starting by generation activity, under the new Directive, the authorisation procedure 

was defined as the standard procedure for new generating capacity (Article 6), even though 

tendering procedure is allowed for certain special cases, like environmental interests, promotion 

of infant new technologies or when it will be necessary to ensure the security of supply (Article 

7). 

Essentially, EU members were required to publish a list of criteria, identified in the previous 

Directive, for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their 

territory.  

 

With regard to transmission and distribution networks, particularly to TPA, the Article 20 of the 

Second Directive withdrawed the Negotiated TPA and the Single Buyer options, remaining then 

the Regulated TPA as the only option available for the future. In addition, the tariffs or at least 

the methodologies underlying their calculations had to be approved by a regulatory authority.  

 

Closely related to the previous point, in the Second Directive the vertical unbundling 

requirements were substantially strengthened. Thus, despite the maintenance of accounting and 

management unbundling measures, the new framework, through Articles 10 and 15, stated that 

TSO and DSO, when part of a vertically integrated undertaking, must be independent at least in 

terms of their legal form, organisation, and decision making from other activities not relating to 

transmission.  

 

According to the same Articles, the document also said that is not required to separate the 

ownership of assets of the transmission system from the vertically integrated undertaking. This 

meant that, although an integrated company could still own a TSO or DSO firm as well as, a 

generation or a retail supply firm, the TSO and the DSO activities had to be carried out by 

legally separate firms.   

At this point, it is possible to conclude that, like the last document, the Second Directive 

remained silent regarding ownership rights. In fact, the EC retains its neutral position. Thus, in 

spite of providing for legal unbundling, it does outline that such separation does not imply the 

transferral of assets from the TSO and DSO. 

 

Regarding to the supply activity, and comparing to the First Directive, which progressively 

opened the market on the basis of the consumption of the final costumers, the new Directive, 

through Article 21, provided a new market opening system:

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

? Until 1st July 2004, the eligible customers specified in the First Directive; 
? From 1st July 2004, at the latest, all non-household customers should be allowed to 

choose their retail suppliers; 

? From 1st July 2007, residential customers should be eligible to access retail supply 
competition.  

 

One of the highlights of the Second Directive concerns to regulation. Aware that a framework in 

line with cross-border energy trading requires the effective regulation of the transmission and 

distribution networks for reasons such as preventing discrimination, excessive pricing or cross-

subsidies, the document, through Article 23, stated that EU members shall designate one or 

more competent bodies with the function of regulatory authorities, which will be wholly 

independent from the interests of the electricity industry.  

These sector regulators were obliged to have a minimum set of standard competences which 

included, among others: 

 

? Ensuring non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the 
market;  

? Monitoring the rules on the management and allocation of interconnection capacity; 
? Setting of mechanisms to deal with congested capacity; 
? The publication of appropriate information by TSOs and DSOs concerning 

interconnectors, grid usage and capacity allocation to interested parties; 

? The effective unbundling of accounts to avoid cross-subsidies between the different 
activities; 

? Monitoring the terms, conditions and tariffs for connecting new producers of electricity 
to guarantee that these are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory; 

? Overall compliance of the TSOs and DSOs with the directive. 

 

Moreover, the document approached the possibility of national regulatory bodies cooperate not 

only with regulatory authorities from other EU country but also with the EC, whether for the 

development of the IEM or to break up dominant companies:  

 

“ National regulatory authorities shall contribute to the development of the internal market and 

of a level playing field by cooperating with each other and with the Commission in a transparent 

manner” 

 

Article 23, Chapter VII 

 

“Member States shall create appropriate and efficient mechanisms for regulation, control and 

transparency so as to avoid any abuse of a dominant position, in particular to the detriment of 

consumers, and any predatory behaviour.” 

 

Article 23, Chapter VII 

 

With regard to this last quote, the EU members shall provide, by 31st July of each year, the EC 

with a report on market dominance, predatory and anti-competitive behaviour. This report shall,

34 

 

in addition, review the changing ownership patterns and any practical measures taken at national 

level to ensure a sufficient variety of market actors or practical measures taken to enhance 

interconnection and competition. 

 

Concerning to the security of supply, the Second Directive went further, and brought some 

safeguard measures, including the introduction of a security plan in case of a sudden crisis in the 

energy market (Article 24). Besides, the document also made reference to monitoring of security 

of supply and the establishment of technical rules: 

 

“EU members shall ensure the monitoring of security of supply issues covering, in particular, 

the   supply/demand balance on the national market, the level of expected future demand and 

envisaged additional capacity being planned or under construction, and the quality and level of 

maintenance of the networks, as well as measures to cover peak demand and to deal with 

shortfalls of one or more suppliers.” 

 

Article 4, Chapter II 

 

The competent authorities shall publish every two years, by 31st July at the latest, a report 

outlining the findings resulting from the monitoring of these issues, as well as any measures 

taken or envisaged to address them and shall forward this report to the EC instantly. 

 

“Member States shall ensure that technical safety criteria are defined and that technical rules 

establishing the minimum technical design and operational requirements for the connection to 

the system of generating installations, distribution systems, directly connected consumers' 

equipment, interconnector circuits and direct lines are developed and made public.” 

 

Article 5, Chapter II

Figure 12. Main features of the Second Directive 

 

According to the Article 27, the Directive also required the EC to play an important role towards 

the creation of the IEM. Thus, the EC must address and report to the European Parliament and 

Council (EPC) outlining the experience gained and progress made in creating the IEM. 

Basically, it should cover the existence of non-discriminatory network access, how effective is 

the regulation, the development of interconnection infrastructure and the security of supply 

situation in the EC, market dominance, concentration in the market and predatory or anti-

competitive behaviour. 

 

Besides that, the Second Directive, through the Article 3, established general rules for the 

organisation of the sector regarding public service obligations and customer protection ( Figure 

13). With the following guidelines, the EC expected to ensure that issues such as social 

exclusion, universal service, security of supply and environmental considerations were taken 

into account by private companies operating in a liberalised market:

? To be in line with EU objectives: EU members must ensure that electricity 
undertakings operate with a view to achieve a competitive, secure, and environmentally 

sustainable market in electricity;  

? Public service obligations: EU members may impose public service obligations on 
electricity undertakings, but such mandate must be clearly defined, transparent, non-

discriminatory, verifiable and shall guarantee equality of access for EU electricity 

companies to national consumers. 

In order to carry on these public service obligations, EU members may introduce the 

implementation of long-term planning, taking into account at all times the possibility of 

TPA to the system; 

? Universal service: EU members must ensure that all household customers enjoy 
universal service. By other words, it is the right to be supplied with electricity of a 

specified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable, and 

transparent prices.  

To ensure the provision of universal service, EU members may appoint a supplier of 

last resort; 

? State aid: To achieve the goals of social and economic cohesion, as well as those of 
security of supply and environmental protection, economic incentives can be granted by 

the EU members, in a non-discriminatory and transparent way, for the maintenance and 

construction of the necessary network infrastructure; 

? Consumer protection: In order to protect final customers and, in particular to ensure 
that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, the Directive 

contains specific measures aiming to allow such customers with the possibility of 

switching suppliers easily while at the same time being protected from disconnection; 

? Potential abuse of public service obligation: EU members may decide not to apply the 
rules on generation or on TPA if the application of those provisions would obstruct the 

performance, in law or in fact, of public service obligations, but only insofar as the 

development of trade is not adversely affected to an extent contrary to the interest of the 

community; 

? Electricity labelling: EU members shall ensure that electricity suppliers specify in or 
with the bills, the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the 

supplier over the preceding year, and information on the environmental impact, in terms 

of at least emissions of CO2;  

? Report the EC: EU members must, upon implementation of this Directive, inform the 
EC of all measures adopted, whether or not such measures require derogation from this 

Directive.

For instance, as stated before, it remained silent regarding the issue of granting monopoly rights. 

Moreover, on breaking up the dominant companies and introduce competition in the markets, it 

was still not explicit. 

It is hard to understand how far the Directive required the EC and the national regulatory 

authorities to break up dominant companies and how far it just asked them to take measures that 

mitigate the effects of their dominance. 

In order to achieve a fully operational and competitive internal market, there are some main 

obstacles, such as issues of access to the network, tarification issues and different degrees of 

liberalisation between EU members.  

Regarding the retail market opening, no mention is made on pricing policy. For instance, there 

is no requirement that tariffs should reflect costs or that firms should not discriminate between 

classes of consumer (e.g. by offering large consumers disproportionately better terms than small 

consumers).The Directive assumes that the operation of the market will prevent such abuses. 

 

Other issue, related to the execution of the Second Directive, is the cross-border trading in 

electricity, which in terms of flow exchanges between EU members, remained organisationally 

and economically difficult, due to: 

 

? The differences in the structure of tariffication systems applied in EU members; 
? There was a risk of ‘pancaking of tariffs’ if all operators of the transit systems charged a 

tariff; 

? Congestion on some borders often led to allocate the interconnection capacity to market 
operators upon unclear and discriminatory rules. 

 

Thus, to overcome such problems (Figure 14), a harmonised EC framework in tariffs for cross-

border energy trades and on the allocation of available interconnection capacities was felt 

necessary.

Organisational and economic difficulties regarding to cross-border electricity trading

General lack of confidence on price formation in the market

Uneven implementation of the unbundling requirements (market concentration and

diversity in implementation by EU members

2.4.3. A new framework: The Third Directive 

Once again, the measures and policies introduced by the EC, through the Second Directive, 

were insufficient to address the full operation and competitive of the IEM. Thus, after intense 

negotiations among EU members and the EC, the latest set of EU laws on energy markets was 

adopted in 2009 [22]. 

 

The provisions of this new framework (Directive 2009/72/EC), known as the Third Directive or 

the Third Package, marked the latest regulatory stage so far in the EU’s efforts to complete the 

IEM, particularly through the set of new measures regarding to security and sustainable of the 

European electricity sector, as well as consumers’ right. 

 

Each Directive had its most significant features, and the Third Directive is no different (Figure 

15). In this case, one of the highlights concerns the unbundling of transmission network 

systems.  

Although the only option available so far was the legal unbundling, with this new Directive the 

EU members could choose between three different models: 

 

? Full ownership unbundling (FOU): This model consists in the full separation between 
the operation of electricity transmission networks from generation and supply activities. 

Under this regime, TSO can no longer be affiliated or be part of an company which is 

also active in those activities. 

According with Article 9, the TSO must has full control of the network. However, in 

this regard, it can also be understood that a person or a company may still be able to 

hold shares in both a network and a supply or generation undertaking as long as these 

shares represent a non-controlling minority interest.  

? The Independent System Operator (ISO): According with the Article 13, in the ISO 
model when the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking, EU 

members may decide not to choose the first model and designate then an ISO, which 

must be subject to approval by the EC. Once appointed, the ISO has to commit to 

complying with a ten year network investment plan agreed upon by a regulatory 

authority. 

The ISO has to be an entity full separated from the vertically integrated undertaking, 

that may not hold any interest in a supply or generation company, and must perform all 

functions of a TSO. 

? The Independent Transmission Operator (ITO): This last model is only applicable in 
EU members where TSO belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking. EU members 

that have already introduced the ISO model or full ownership unbundling models will 

not be able to revert to an ITO model. 

According to Articles 18 and 19, the ITO model preserves integrated supply and 

transmission companies in exchange for obliging such companies to comply with 

additional rules to ensure that the two activities are operated independently, including 

for instance, the managers of TSO cannot have positions of responsibility, interest or 

business relationships, directly or indirectly, with the relevant vertically integrated 

undertaking or the network development and investment decisions taken by an ITO will 

be examined to ensure that they are consistent with relevant EC-wide plans. 

This model can be considered the lowest threshold for network unbundling.  

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

39 

 

At the end, with this Third Directive the EC wanted to make sure that any system model for 

unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between generators, 

suppliers and TSO, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the 

access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should 

not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. 

 

Concerning generation, no new measures are introduced regarding the introduction of 

competition in the electricity generation phase. According to Article 7, the only innovations 

introduced concern the utilisation of RES. Thus, the EU members must take into account the 

contribution of the corresponding generating capacity to meeting the overall EC target of at least 

a 20% share of energy from RES in the EC’s gross final consumption of energy in 2020. 

 

As far as distribution activity is concerned, by the Article 25 a EU member may require the 

DSO, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using 

RES or waste or producing combined heat and power.  

Unlike the transmission network system, the unbundling of the distribution network system 

remained without any modification (legal unbundling). However, the persons responsible for the 

management of the DSO must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity 

undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, 

transmission or supply of electricity. 

Moreover, if the DSO is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the EU members shall 

ensure that the activities of the DSO are monitored by regulatory authorities so that it cannot 

take advantage of its vertical integration to distort competition. In particular, vertically 

integrated DSO shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of 

the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. 

 

Regarding the supply activity, there is no further restructuring with exception for Article 33, 

which referred to the prevention of a disruption in supply. 

 

Keeping in the track of the Second Directive, the regulation was also subject of attention in this 

new framework. 

Whereas the Second Directive acknowledged that the creation of a internal electricity market 

requires the effective regulation of the transmission and distribution networks, it failed to 

separate national regulatory authorities from public entities. Although regulatory authorities 

were required to be complete independent from the interests of the electricity industry, political 

independence was forgotten.  

Concerned about this situation, the Third Directive, through Article 35, required national 

regulatory authorities to be legally distinct and functionally independent from any other public 

or private entity. Besides that, the EU members shall ensure that its staff  and the persons 

responsible for its management do not seek or take direct instructions from any government or 

other public or private entity when carrying out the regulatory tasks. For that purpose, 

regulatory authorities shall be granted budgetary autonomy, legal personality and appropriate 

human and financial resources.  

  

According to Article 37, regulatory authorities as regard to market regulation powers and duties, 

they are responsible for monitoring and intervening in the allocation of interconnection 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

capacity, setting of mechanisms to deal with congested capacity, ensuring compliance of TSO 

and DSO with the rules set forth in the Directive, among others. 

 

Besides that, and concerning about international energy trading, the framework also provided a 

regulatory regime for cross-border issues (Article 38).  

Thereby, regulatory authorities shall closely consult and cooperate with each other, to foster the 

creation of operational arrangements in order to enable an optimal management of the network, 

promote joint electricity exchanges and the allocation of cross-border capacity. 

Moreover they must also coordinate the development of all network codes for the relevant TSOs 

and other market actors, and coordinate the development of the rules governing the management 

of congestion. 

 

At the same the Third Directive was adopted, another document was also accepted by the EU 

members: Regulation(EC) 713/2009 [23]. The main goal of this document was the 

establishment of ACER.  

 

Since the adoption of the First Directive, the lack of coordination at high level has constantly 

undermined the establishment of a truly IEM. Aware of this, in an attempt to reinforce the 

position of regulators at the European level, with the Second Directive it was created an 

independent advisory group, called the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas 

(ERGEG), to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies 

in EU members and the EC. Despite the good work provided by this entity, the reality showed 

that it was insufficient. 

 

Thus, a new entity with clear competences and with power to adopt individual regulatory 

decisions in a number of cases, including the extinction of barriers to cross-border exchanges of 

electricity with a view to achieving the objectives of EC energy policies, was required and the 

response came with the entry of ACER.

41 

 

 

Figure 15. Main features of the Third Directive 

 

Trying to antecipate the future, the Third Directive also included some innovative measures in 

relation to third countries stated in the Article 11. 

Fundamentally, the framework requires non-EU companies to be in line with the EU laws in 

case they wish to acquire a significant share of an EU transmission network. In such 

acquisitions, national regulatory authorities can refuse the certification of a TSO if the relevant 

company does not comply with the unbundling requirements of Article 9, its market entry 

would will not put at risk the security of supply of the EU members and the EC.  

This assessment must be carried out by the very same authority, with the only limitation of 

having to take into account the international agreements between the EU and the respective third 

country.

42 

 

 

The record keeping was another of the innovations of this Third Directive. Thus, and according 

to Article 40, the EU members shall require generator and supply undertakings to keep at the 

disposal of the national authorities, including the national regulatory authority, the national 

competition authorities and the EC, for the fulfilment of their tasks, all data relating to 

operational decisions and trades. The idea behind this Article, is the hope that such requirements 

enable regulators to better assess allegations of market abuse and to study past behaviour of 

market players. 

 

As well as the last Directive, the new framework set general rules for the organisation of the 

sector with a view to achieve a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable electricity 

market (Figure 16). Thus, in order to further consolidate consumer protection, innovation, and 

makes an attempt to merge national systems into one European electricity market, the Article 3 

considered: 

 

? Entrance of foreign electricity suppliers: EU members shall ensure that all customers 
may have their electricity provided by a supplier regardless of the Member State in 

which the supplier is registered. In this regard, EU members shall take all measures 

necessary to ensure that administrative procedures do not discriminate the entrance of 

foreign electricity suppliers. 

? Consumer switching: EU members shall ensure that when a customer wishes to 
change supplier, the change is effected, in a non-discriminatory manner as regards cost, 

effort or time, within three weeks. 

? Definition the concept of vulnerable customer: EU members shall take appropriate 
measures to protect final customers, and shall, in particular, ensure that there are 

adequate safeguards to protect economically vulnerable customers. 

? Promotion of sustainable development: EU members shall implement measures to 
achieve the objectives of social and economic cohesion and environmental protection. 

? Promoting energy efficiency: EU members shall strongly recommend that electricity 
undertakings optimise the use of electricity, for example by providing energy 

management services, developing innovative pricing formulas, or introducing intelligent 

metering systems or smart grids. 

? Providing information to customers: EU members shall ensure the provision of single 
points of contact to provide consumers with all necessary information concerning their 

rights, current legislation and the means of dispute settlement available to them in the 

event of a dispute. 

? Creation of a consumer body: MS shall ensure that an independent mechanism such 
as an energy ombudsman or a consumer body is in place in order to ensure efficient 

treatment of complaints and out of court dispute settlements.

Figure 16. General rules for the organisation of the sector 

 

 

Although the Third Directive set the full ownership separation between the TSO and the 

generation and supply activities for the first time, the framework still allow EU members, 

through the ITO model, to maintain system arrangements where TSOs belong to a vertically 

integrated undertaking,  so uneven implementation of the Directive is expected. 

 

Nevertheless, reviewing the three European Directives (Figure 17), it is safe to say the 

implementation of the successive frameworks has been almost a success towards the creation of 

a fully operational and competitive IEM.  

Obviously, it is hard to get it right the first time. However, looking back, it is possible to note 

that, for instance, the competitive activities have been opened to all customers before finishing 

the restructuring of the electricity industry. Moreover, the institutionalisation of the cooperation 

of national regulatory authorities and the TSOs and DSOs were achieved too in an earlier stage.

2.5. European Energy Mix Outlook 

According to EC reports [24], in 2010 Europe represented 6.5% of the world energy production 

(Table 1). Not a significant value when compared to China (17.5%), USA (13.4%), Middle East 

(12.7%) or even Russia (10.1%), but considerable.

Altough the worldwide mix of primary energy production has been changing significantly over 

the past four decades, there is something that remains the same: coal and petroleum continue to 

be the energy sources most widely used in 2010 with 28.4 % and 31.7 %, respectively (Table 2).

Another important feature regarding worldwide energy is the gross inland consumption (Table 

73). By region, it is notable that the biggest economies, such as China or USA, are the ones with 

greatest needs reaching in 2010 a share of 19.3 % and 17.4 %, respectively. Europe, is third of 

the list, with a 13.4 % share.

As expected, looking to the final worldwide energy consumption (Figure 18), the variable has 

been also increasing and the responsibles are the world’s fastest growing economies for the past 

two decades, China and India [25]. From 1990 to 2010, China’s economy grew by an average of 

10.4 % per year and India’s by 6.4 % per year.    

 

 

Figure 18. Evolution of the world energy consumption, by region ( in Mtoe)  [24] 

 

Europe, as others mature economies, including the USA or Russia, shows an evident slow pace 

of growth in comparison with the emerging economies. Thus, in 2010 the final energy 

consumption can be translated in figure 19. 

 

 

Figure 19. World final energy consumption in 2010 

  

Regarding the world’s electricity generation (Table 4), coal is the predominant energy source 

used. In 2010, coal-fired generation accounted for 40.5 % and natural gas 22 % of overall

worldwide electricity generation, followed closely by RES and Nuclear with 19.4 % and 12.9 

%, respectively.

Although RES have positive environmental and energy security features, most RES 

technologies other than hydroelectricity do not compete economically with fossil fuels, except 

in a few regions or in niche markets. Photovoltaics (PV), for instance, is currently a niche of 

RES, but it can be competitive where electricity prices are especially high, where peak load 

pricing occurs, where government incentives are available, or where infrastructure 

interconnection issues pose large costs. Government policies or incentives often provide support 

for construction of renewable generation facilities [25]. 

 

Overviewed the energetic situation worldwide, it is time to focus in EU between 1900 and 2011. 

Thus, starting by the energy production, it is visible the decreases of energy production in 

Europe over the years (Figure 20). Total primary energy production in the EU has declined 

continuously between 2001 and 2011 by 15 % [26].   

 

 

Figure 20. Evolution of the energy production in EU ( in Mtoe) [24] 

 

Historically, the European mix of primary energy production was dominated by fossil solutions, 

such as coal or natural gas. Not even with the seventies oil crisis the scenario changed, when 

generation from nuclear power increased rapidly. In fact, the situation remained unchanged until 

very recently with the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in the beginning of the nineties, and the 

subsequent amendments to the treaty (Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon). The objectives were clear, 

the principle of sustainable development supported by the use of RES, while protecting the 

environment.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Thus, with these guidelines behind, in 2011 the RES (20.1 %) reached a share similar to coal 

(20.7 %), while the natural gas, despite its falls from year to year, accounted a share of 17.4 %. 

However, the leading place is occupied by nuclear power since the turn of the century, 

registering in 2011 a share of 29 % (Figure 21). 

In the last decade, RES production grew by 63 %, while reductions were recorded in the 

production of all other fuels [26].   

 

 

Figure 21.  Evolution of the EU energy production, by energy source (in Mtoe) [24] 

 

Gross inland consumption, or total energy demand, represents the quantity of energy necessary 

to satisfy inland consumption of a geographical region. Europe, in 2011, the main energy source 

was petroleum with a share of 35.2 % (Figure 22). More distant of this mark were natural gas, 

coal, nuclear and RES with shares of 23.4 %, 16.8 %, 13.8 % and 10 %, respectively.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Exploring the RES share (Figure 23), biomass and renewable wastes take an distinguished 

position with 6.8 % share, followed far behind by hydro, wind power with a share of 1.6 % and 

0.9%, respectively. At the end, comes geothermal and PV power with a share of 0.4 % each. 

 

 

Figure 23. Gross energy consumption, by RES (in 2011) 

 

As shown before, Europe is presenting a slow pace of growth in comparison with the emerging 

economies (Figure 24). In 2011 the oil was ranked in first place (40.3 %) among the EU final 

energy consumption, followed by natural gas (21.9 %), electricity (21.6 %) and RES (7 %).  

 

 

Figure 24. Evolution of the EU final energy consumption, by fuel (in Mtoe) [24] 

 

Further analysis of the final energy consumption in Europe lead to a conclusion: there was a fall 

of 4 % between 2001 and 2011 [26], mainly due to the decrease in the consumption by industry 

( -13 %) and households (-9 %). On the other hand increases were recorded in services (10 %) 

and the transport sector (6 %). These trends reflect a shift from an economy based on the 

industry towards a economy based on services as well as an decrease in energy intensity due to 

energy efficiency gains.

Figure 25. Evolution of the EU final energy consumption, by sector (in Mtoe) [24] 

 

In 2011, EU final energy consumption reached 1 109 Mtoe (Figure 25). A third of this amount 

was consumed by the transport sector (33 %), followed by the industrial sector (26 %), 

households (24.7 %) and services (13 %). 

 

According to Eurostat report, there are several sectors which contribute to the final energy 

consumption in Europe [26]. The most relevant are: Industry, Transport and Residential. With 

regard to the analysis, the study period is the last decade (2001-2011).    

 

 

Figure 26. Evolution of the EU final energy consumption in Industry (in Mtoe) [26] 

 

Thus, in relation to industry (Figure 26), between 2001 and 2011 the sector recorded reductions 

in the consumption of oil (-39 %), coal (-21 %), natural gas (-19 %) and electricity (-4 %). In

contrast, over the same period the consumption of derived heat and RES grew by 53 % and 31 

% correspondingly. 

 

 

Figure 27. Final energy consumption in EU Industry, by energy source (2011)  

 

In 2011, natural gas and electricity each covered 31 % of the energy requirements of EU 

industry, followed by coal (13 %) and oil (11 %). The contribution of RES and derived heat 

were smaller with 7 % and 5 %, respectively (Figure 27). 

 

There are several types of transportations in EU, inclunding by road, air or rail. Within the 

transport sector of the EU, road transport was the most energy consuming mode since there are 

record keeping.  

 

 

Figure 28. Evolution of the EU final energy consumption in Transport (in Mtoe) [26]

In the last decade, significant changes were observed in the fuel mix consumed by the transport 

sector in the EU (Figure 28). From 2001 to 2011, the consumption of motor spirit decreased by 

31 %, while the consumption of all other fuels grew. 

 

 

Figure 29. Final energy consumption in EU Transportation, by energy source (2011) 

 

For instance, gas/diesel oil accounted for 54 % of the total in 2011 compared to 46 % in 2001. 

In contrast, the share of motor spirits dropped to 24 % in 2011 from 38 % in 2001 (Figure 29). 

Kerosenes maintained a share of approximately 14 % in 2011, while biofuels made up 4 % of 

total transport consumption.  

 

 

Figure 30. Evolution of the EU final energy consumption in Households (in Mtoe) [26] 

 

Between 2001 and 2011 total energy consumption by EU households dropped by 9 %. 

According to Figure 30, the energy source with the highest decrease over this period was oil (-

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

39 %), followed by derived heat (-19 %), natural gas (-12 %) and coal (-5 %). In contrast, 

increases were recorded in the consumption of RES (31 %) and electricity (9 %).  

 

 

Figure 31. Final energy consumption in EU Households, by energy source (2011) 

 

In 2011 (Figure 31), natural gas made up 36 % of the total energy consumption by EU 

households, followed by electricity (25 %), RES with the same share as oil (14 %), derived heat 

(7 %) and coal (4 %). 

 

Since the nineties, the installed capacity of EU electricity power plants have been growing 

continuously and in 2011 reached the overall ammount of 920 GW. Considering the last decade, 

it is possible to draw the graph shown in Figure 32.  

 

 

Figure 32. Installed capacity of EU electricity power plants, by type (in MW) [26]  

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

53 

 

According to Figure 32, in 2011 the thermal capacity reached 53% of the total installed 

capacity, much higher than nuclear (14 %), hydro (16 %) or other type of RES (17 %) capacity. 

 

Not counting with hydropower, looking in detail to the RES type it is possible to conclude that 

wind power is responsible for the largest amount of RES share, followed by PV power and 

biomass [24].    

 

 

Figure 33. EU gross electricity generation, by type (in TWh) [24] 

 

With regard to the generation of electricity produced by an electric power plant, in 2011 the EU 

gross electricity generation was 3 268 TWh, a 6 % increase when compared to 2001. It is also 

worth mentioning, that over this period, generation from hydro and other RES grew by 50 % 

and thermal generation by 1 %. On the opposite, nuclear generation dropped by 7 % [26].  

 

According to Figure 33, in 2011 the electricity was generated primarily by nuclear power plants 

with a share of 27.6 %, followed by thermal plants (coal, natural gas and petroleum with a share 

of 25.9 %, 22 % and 2.2 %, respectively). Backing up the EU electricity generation, was the 

RES with a global share of 21.3 %.

54 

 

 

Figure 34. EU gross electricity generation, by RES (2011) 

 

Focusing on the RES share (Figure 34), almost half of the gross electricity was generated by 

hydropower (48 %). The other half was constituted by wind power (26 %), PV power plants (7 

%), biomass and renewable wastes (19 %), and finally, geothermal (1 %).  

 

One of the most famous measures introduced by the EU regarding to environmental protection 

and promotion of RES, was the 2020 climate and energy package. Basically, this package is a 

set of binding legislation which aims to ensure the EU meets its ambitious climate and energy 

targets for 2020. Shortly, these targets, known as the "20-20-20" targets, set three key objectives 

for 2020: 

 

? A 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from 1990 levels; 
? Raising the share of EU energy consumption produced from RES to 20%; 
? A 20% improvement in the EU's energy efficiency. 

 

Focusing on the first two goals, at the moment the results are promising and let a positive signal 

that these targets will be achieved possibly in a couple of years before the established deadline 

(Table 5). For instance, in 2011 EU registered a total share of 13 % in the use of RES [26].

Moreover, regarding to GHG, the following table represents the significant reduction over the 

years [24].

Analysing all the data presented before, it is possible to come up with some conclusions. For 

instance, according to Figure 33, the picture for different electricity generation technologies is 

one of contrasts: the EU appears to have shifted from the recent trend of “RES plus gas” to 

“RES plus coal”. This might be explained by the failure of the CO2 emission market, which was 

expected to ‘tax’ the use of coal for electricity generation purposes.  

 

Table 7. Evolution of the GHGs emissions in Europe 

Million ton CO2 

or equiv. 
1995 2000 2005 2009 2010

Index 1995 100% 98% 101% 91% 93% 

 

In line with this conclusion, and supported by energy and environmental indicators (Table 7), it 

is also rational to come up with the fact that although final energy consumption stagnated, the 

low-carbon generation increased, due to the increase in coal-fired generation. The reason? 

 

It’s simple, and it is mainly due to the policy choices adopted by major EU economies. 

Exploring this idea, it is the result of insignificant carbon price signal, cheap coal, expensive gas 

and reduced demand, combined with low wholesale prices and subsidised RES that has been 

pushing gas out of the market [27]. Moreover, the EU comeback for coal can also be seen as a 

forced escape of the natural gas coming from Russia, due to the latest events in international 

relations between Ukraine and Russia.  

   

Thus, since its qualities as back-up generation are as uncontested, as is its climate advantage 

compared to coal, natural gas-fired power plants play a central role in the future agenda on 

strategic reserve and capacity remuneration mechanisms not only in EU, but worldwide [27].  

 

Helping the situation, there is another interesting aspect related to RES. The RES support 

schemes, introduced in order to achieve the EU’s 20% RES target, are undercutting the CO2 

price (Figure 35). Such an effect increases the costs of the transition to low-carbon electricity, 

while having no impact on the reduction of the emissions. Historic data shows that, increasing 

RES generation was closely accompanied by increase in coal-fired generation [27].

Closely related to the last sentence is the installed capacity, which in the case of RES power 

plants has been growing continuously. A common characteristic of added RES capacities 

throughout the whole period is that they are subsidy driven. However, it is important to prevent 

a possible slowdown of RES growth due to a change in national RES support policies or other 

upcoming event [27]. 

 

3. A call for energy Cooperatives 

3.1. Introduction 

Since ancient times people from different backgrounds join to community solutions, in response 

to social and economic disadvantage and in the interest of the weak social layers, particularly 

the working poor. Basically, what unites them is a shared belief that people, not money, should 

and have to be the key for transformation and progress. Thereby, it doesn’t take very long to this 

common expectations and basis for cooperation that goes beyond individual interests, evolve to 

a cooperative community movement that spreads practically throughout the sectors of our 

society.   

 

The community Cooperatives that are popping up today across the world are the last stage of an 

evolutionary process which has seen the progressive shift of Cooperatives’ aims from specific 

social and professional groups to society as a whole. 

Looking back into the history of the Cooperatives, the early steps of the movement have started 

in the 19th century, when the first Cooperatives emerged within the working class in order to 

offer better opportunities to the workers. Besides its economic role, Cooperatives were also part 

of a broader social movement with political aims of transforming society. At that time, 

Cooperatives were related to special-interest groups. That means, they usually served purposes 

which were not transversal to all society members but specific to a restricted group of people 

[28].  

However, at some point, a new cooperative trend has started to arise. Despite inspired by the 

same ideals and having the same legal forms, they had a different nature in the way they 

provided essential services of interest to all members of a community, not just a part of it [28]. 

Among the first Cooperatives that met the needs of a whole community, the energy 

Cooperatives, which will be subject of analysis ahead, are some of the clearest and most 

significant examples of this trend.         

 

Cooperatives have been addressing the community issues for over 150 years, and the last 

development relevant to the evolution of cooperative movement occurred towards the end of the 

last century with the enlargement of Cooperatives’ aims to embrace society’s benefit. Though 

early Cooperatives were only concerned in granting benefits to their members, the pursuit of the 

public interest was not their objective. In other words, their explicit aim was to benefit members 

through trade with them and the community’s well-being was an unintended consequence. 

However, in the last few decades of the 20th century the well-being of society as a whole made 

its first appearance as an explicit goal for the Cooperative firm. In the new community 

Cooperatives arising today these evolutionary paths intertwine to give birth to a highly complex 

and diversified category of Cooperative organisations [28]. But before proceeding, how can we 

explain to someone what is a Cooperative?

By the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Recommendation No. 193 on the Promotion of 

Cooperatives 2002 a Cooperative is defined as [29]: 

 
“An autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, 

social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned  

and democratically controlled enterprise.” 

 
ILO Recommendation 193, paragraph 2 

 
This definition has been adopted from the International Cooperative Alliance Statement on 

Cooperative Identity 1995, and nowadays is accepted worldwide. The same document states the 

seven principles to which Cooperatives must comply (Figure 36):  

 

 

Figure 36. The seven Cooperative principles  

 

In relation to economic terms, Cooperatives are a distinct kind of business organisation because 

they have a different model of ownership. This means, Cooperatives are enterprises that are 

owned by their users rather than by their investors (as is the case of capitalist corporations) so 

they are simultaneously members and users of the firm and their ownership rights take a very 

specific configuration. Therefore, as democratic and participatory organisations, Cooperatives’ 

net earnings are usually divided equity and equality among the members according to the 

volume of transactions they have realised with the firm, and all voting rights are shared among 

the members according to their relative amount of transactions, or, more simply, on a “one 

member, one vote” basis [30]. 

 

Nowadays, as mentioned above, there are a new community Cooperatives slowly arising. These 

highly complex and diversified model of Cooperative organisations, identified as “social 

enterprises” are emerging where some different types of stakeholders have a strong appeal in 

becoming owners whilst share mutual interests and visions. Among their interests are a 

sustainable development, social inclusion and poverty reduction, and the access to energy as a 

critical issue for development processes, including for eradicating poverty and helping to 

provide basic human needs [31]. In these cases, Cooperatives may enjoy competitive advantages 

through a privileged “win-win” relationship with the key stakeholder groups. Such win-win 

relationship is likely to ensure loyalty of the members and attract other members over time [32].

However, despite the many good Cooperatives examples observed in various fields and regions, 

one may wonder why this joint organisational model is not more widespread? In fact, there are 

some barriers that help to explain why Cooperatives face an unequal and sometimes difficult 

development across Europe (Figure 37).  

The most evident is that, as no organisational model is universal, it’s only in a number of 

situations depending on each context that these models seem adequate, but let’s forget for now 

this topic once it will be explored further ahead in relation to RES Cooperatives. Second, as all 

organisational models, Cooperatives also suffer from economic barriers. These weaknesses are 

often reinforced by “barriers to entry” that disable Cooperatives to take advantage of their 

valences to survive and develop. Third, the development of Cooperatives may be hindered by 

the way in which they are perceived and understood by a number of stakeholders – this refers to 

legitimacy issues [32].  

 

 

Figure 37. Reasons that prevent the Cooperatives’ development 

 

One of the most challenging obstacles faced by Cooperatives is definitely how hard is to gather 

enough funds particularly in capital-intensive markets, such as the RES industry. Commonly, 

non-investor-owned firms are less attractive to investors seeking to maximise the return of their 

investments. Moreover, members can deny the entry of such non-member investors (external 

investors) because they want to protect their common ideals from traditional profit-

maximisation behaviours. For those two reasons, cooperative capital is usually limited to the 

amount raised from the members. This often leads to under-capitalisation, which prevents the 

firm from entering a market that requires a large capital base.  

Nevertheless, two solutions may be found, but both have their cons. First, gathering a very large 

number of members may enable to obtain a sufficient amount of capital. In this case, the 

Cooperative organisation becomes much more difficult to run in a democratic way and can lose 

the ground for its trust-related assets. Second, despite their reluctance, members can eventually 

open the capital to external investors. But in this case, under the pressure of external 

shareholders expecting returns on their investment and decision-making power equal to it, the 

Cooperative may gradually transform and resemble a for-profit firm, thereby invalidating 

certain of its assets [32]. According to studies, the limited access to capital is hindered by some 

factors which industrial economists call “barriers to entry” (Figure 38).

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Figure 38. The biggest challenges that all Cooperatives face 

 

All these obstacles may prevent a new player from entering a market, despite its potential 

competitive advantages. In other words, Cooperatives may be the most efficient solutions in a 

number of cases, but if they do not have access to the market for instance because of the 

existence of a monopoly, due to large economies of scale, or because of an unfavourable 

legislation, such efficiency will remain theoretical and not be converted into market shares [32]. 

 

When a Cooperative decide to gather capital whether through fresh members and external 

investors, a new issue usually comes up…people do not know what a Cooperative is. When 

someone thinks business and economic activity, they spontaneously see the traditional for-profit 

business model. On the other side, when people think about enterprises that have the social or 

environmental needs on the baseline, they see a non-profit or NGO model. Definitely, 

Cooperatives enjoy little legitimacy simply because people, stakeholders, decision-makers do 

not know them. Hence, much of the Cooperatives’ efforts in scaling up their model, or even in 

only surviving, lies in gaining cognitive legitimacy [32]. 

 

3.2. Emergence of energy Cooperatives 

The environmental and economic trends of the last decades are begging the world to urgently 

rethink the current energy systems. Thereby, due to the ever rising concerns over ecological 

sustainability, market volatility, increasing energy prices as well as security of energy supply, 

the world over the last years have been trying to transform the energy system of the past 

towards a more sustainable system of energy supply and production. Slowly the classical 

regime, characterised by highly centralised energy infrastructures, is switching for a different 

and decentralised energy model, and at the grassroots level this has included the establishment 

of “new” types of socio-economic organisations as the revival of energy Cooperatives and other 

forms of local or community based ownership of RE technologies (Figure 39).

Figure 39. Reasons behind the revival of energy cooperatives [31] 

 

Supported by the raising awareness on climate changes and the introduction of RES policies, 

this new generation of energy Cooperatives, commonly known as RES Cooperatives, are 

democratising the energy sector through producing, selling, consuming and, in the particular 

case of this work, energy providing. These organisations can be considered a serious solution to 

overcome the lack of institutions and policy, and the lack of enterprises, organisation and 

human capacity.  

 

Let’s see the several reasons why RES Cooperatives are an alternative solution to the traditional 

and big energy providers (Figure 40). The energy supply at a reasonable price is one of the 

issues of particular concern to most RES Cooperatives. Moreover, through this firms consumers 

can reduce their environmental impact (by relying on RES), strengthen the market for cleaner 

energy and encourage the building of more RES power plants. By becoming a member, the 

citizen is encouraged to active participate in local and national energy policy discussions and 

thus can easily see the implications of their efforts as a contribution to a better environment and 

energy future. Beside that, RES Cooperatives can also promote local development by creating 

green jobs or offering additional services such as microfinance, better infrastructure or technical 

training and assistance on innovative and productive end uses. [31]. Finally they distinguished 

themselves from other market players, in the way mainstream electricity undertakings have no 

incentive in reducing the consumption of their customers, because this would simultaneously 

induce costs and reduce their turnover. RES Cooperatives, on the contrary, are much more 

legitimate in promoting the reduction of consumption, as this is in line with the interests of the 

consumers who are controlling the organisation [32].

Since the boom of alternative energies in the seventies, that big companies control the RES 

market practically in every single countries. However, thanks to recent European liberalisation 

of the electricity market an increasing number of RES Cooperative's movements have emerged 

all over Europe after a historical state monopoly, supported by the dissatisfaction of consumers 

and their desire to have a word to say about their energy’s costs and the origin of their energy. 

Among the pioneers there were EWS in Germany and Ecopower in Belgium [32].  

 

Although RES Cooperatives offer numerous advantages in terms of both economic efficiency 

and citizen involvement, the truth is that they still represent a small share within the European 

RES market. Basically, the RES market could be divided in two parts (Figure 41):  

 

 

Figure 41. The two parts of the RES market 

 

According to the Eurostat energy reports (Figure 42), in terms of production the share of RES 

(biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind and solar energy) in the total production of 

energy in the EU has evolved from 9 to 14% between 2005 and 2012, and from 15 to 24% if we 

only consider electricity (Figure 43).  

 

 

Figure 42. Share of RES in the EU (2005-2012) 

 

A side note for the fact that, for instance, from 2005 to 2009 the proportion of this energy 

produced by RES Cooperatives, however, remains weak although growing: from 1 or 2% in 

Southern and Eastern Europe, to 6% in Belgium and France and an estimate of 15% in 

Scandinavian countries [32]. 

 

Besides production of renewable energy, a related market is that of the supply of the produced 

energy, particularly in the form of electricity. This market is even more difficult to enter for 

RES Cooperatives, as it has only recently been liberalised and is still controlled by a small 

number of powerful energy companies. Plus, the electricity grid is often owned by the historical 

electricity provider in each country. Nevertheless, several RES Cooperatives have started

supplying electricity based on RES, with the goal of increasing their membership and 

controlling a significant part of the supply chain [32]. 

 

 

Figure 43. Share of RES-E in the EU (2005-2012) 

 

It is evident the rising concerns over ecological sustainability and the adoption and promotion of 

the use of “green power” led to an increase of RES share in the total production of energy in the 

EU. Looking to data (Figure 43), particularly between 2009 and 2010, we may guess the falling 

energy consumption of 2009 is also related to a strong policy measures to improve energy 

efficiency. But it if we analyse carefully and remind the news of that time, it is visible on the 

graph the financial and economic crisis effects in the year 2009 pulling down consumption to its 

lowest level. The same way that the increase one year later was due to a combination of severe 

weather conditions, which strongly pushed up demand from the residential sector, and economic 

recovery effects [33]. However, other elements have to be taken into consideration such as a 

growing population. At the same time EU members have set energy efficiency targets for 

buildings and took measures to increase the rate of deep renovations to effectively reduce 

energy demand and create new jobs. The consequences of such acts are visible in the following 

years. 

 

At this moment there are several questions that can be asked:  

 

? Why the visible benefits of these firms are not the springboard for scaling up the energy 
Cooperative movements?  

? Why RES Cooperatives still represent a small share within the European RES market?  

 

Despite the common advantages of the RES Cooperative model in response to consumer 

concerns, as mentioned before there is no universal organisational model. Each country has their 

own national particularities and even if there are some general principles, there certainly are no 

standard patterns among countries. Thus, it is quite reasonable to say that the development of 

the model depends on each context that a cooperative is fixed. 

However there are generic barriers transversal to all of them (Figure 44). The first one is the 

limited access to capital, at least in the start-up phase. For instance, the high costs of RES power 

plants can be an huge obstacle for setting up new RES projects. Second, for producing energy 

based on RES, another critical limitation is the access to locations for new infrastructures. This, 

combined with the amounts of capital required for the development of the projects, clearly

favoured big players and led to the emergence of an oligopoly. This was clearly confirmed in all 

European countries, both for the production and the distribution of RE. 

A third barrier concerns to RES-E distribution. In some countries, such distribution is not 

possible for RES Cooperatives and even where it is allowed, private consumers and 

municipalities remained rather passive when dealing with these organisations. In these cases, 

this enables the firms to exploit their information advantage concerning the profitability of RES 

projects, at the expense of consumers and municipalities, who generally accepted what the big 

companies offered them without realising the more favourable deal they could obtain. In fact, 

there would be many reasons for consumers and municipalities to support the emergence of 

RES Cooperatives but given the low awareness of the current energy situation, the level of 

dissatisfaction was low.  

Intimately related with the previous obstacle, a fourth barrier is the lack of transparent 

information enabling the public authority to compare among different offers. Sometimes the 

RES projects are too small to fall even under the public procurement scheme. Moreover, as 

most municipalities are involved in “inter-municipal partnerships” for the management of 

energy and many other issues, decisions are taken according to the governance mechanisms of 

these partnerships [32]. 

Behind the previously mentioned barriers to entry, the lack of support for this model also 

seemed to result from a lack of awareness of RES as public goods with a high potential of 

involvement of and return to the community. 

 

Figure 44. Generic barriers that RES Cooperatives have to face 

 

According to studies and their own experience (Figure 45), there are four strategies used by 

some RES Cooperatives to establish their model [32]: 

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

64 

 

 

Figure 45. Strategies adopted by RES Cooperatives to overcome these barriers 

 

About the first two strategies, statements “throwing down” the big companies and promoting 

the economic assets of RES Cooperatives are surprisingly scarce, and away of public debates. In 

fact, these firms are mainly focused in promoting on their normative legitimation (better 

environmental and democratic solutions) rather than their pragmatic legitimation (advantages 

comparing to the different stakeholder groups). Fundamentally, the most intensive process 

observed in RES Cooperatives is a quest for cognitive legitimation through the definition of 

their common identity (internal networking) and the establishment of alliances with other 

partners, as governments. Hence, RES Cooperatives tried to have their model known and 

recognised by politicians at different levels. For instance, Ecopower use an individual 

commitment of politicians and other resource-rich stakeholders as cooperative members to 

increase the recognition of the model. RES Cooperatives also enjoyed their role of allies of 

environmental NGOs and simultaneously tried to build a reputation of trustworthy economic 

partners [32]. 

While everything does not depend of RES Cooperatives themselves, the diffusion of their model 

will depend very much on their ability to gather different stakeholders around their project. As 

the power relationships with mainstream businesses seem unfavourable to RES Cooperatives, 

maybe a more dynamic strategy of selective alliances with some of these businesses will be 

necessary to reach a significant share of the market. In any case, the success of the diffusion of 

RES Cooperatives will be a key element to assess to what extent the cooperative model is 

indeed experiencing a renewal in addressing new social and environmental challenges [32]. 

  

In summary, in the field of RES, Cooperatives appear as a solution to the problem of excessive 

power market, provide social and environmental guarantees in a context of asymmetric 

information and seem more committed to encourage the reduction of energy consumption. 

However, RSE Cooperatives also have their limitations, in the context of the energy market, 

which explain their still limited market shares and their difficult development in certain 

contexts. 

 

3.3. The Cooperatives in European Union law 

As energy and sustainable development are likely to be included as two of the main goals in the 

near future of European development agenda, the role of these organisations are set to become 

even more intensive and important in the future of energy markets.   

With the expected growth of RES Cooperatives’ popularity, a natural consequence seems to be 

that they will require some protection through appropriate legislative framework, policy envi-

ronment and enabling conditions, including support measures. These include loan, grant and 

subsidy programmes (including special feed-in tariff rates that encourage community-based or 

cooperatively owned energy development), technical assistance and capacity-building, including

partnership programmes with government agencies that help public authorities at all levels to 

work towards their commitment to “energy for all” [31]. This is in line with the ILO 

Recommendation No. 193 on the Promotion of Cooperatives 2002, which specifically notes:  

 
“Cooperatives should be treated in accordance with national law and practice and on terms no 

less favourable than those accorded to other forms of enterprise and social organisation. 

Governments should introduce support measures, where appropriate, for the activities of 

cooperatives that meet specific social and public policy outcomes, such as employment 

promotion or the development of activities benefiting disadvantaged groups or regions. Such 

measures could include, among others and in so far as possible, tax benefits, loans, grants, 

access to public works programmes, and special procurement provisions. “ 

ILO Recommendation 193, paragraph 7 

 

Thereby, a flexible regulatory environment is essential to promote Cooperatives and in this 

particular case, RSE Cooperatives. Regarding to RES Cooperatives, their promotion can be split 

into three different parts (Figure 46): 

 

 

Figure 46. The three ways to promote RES Cooperatives 

 

Since 2003, time that EC adopted the Regulation on the Statute for the European Cooperative 

Society, which sets the rules for Cooperatives willing to extend their action beyond national 

borders, much have been done but there remain much still to do, starting by the most important 

thing: the release of a standard law that may protect RES Cooperatives. 

 

With the economic crisis of 2009, consumer confidence and levels of trust in business 

drastically fell down, and thus with public attention focused more and more on social and 

ethical performances of enterprises. After years of debates, the EC published in 2011 its long 

awaited new communication: “A renewed EU strategy 2011-2014 for Corporate Social 

Responsibility“. By adopting this communication, the EU officially recognised Cooperatives as 

one the various ways of doing business.  

Soon, their role was empowered when the social entrepreneurship was selected as one of the 

twelve measures announced by the EU to achieve the IEM, as well as the introduction of a short 

term action plan to support the development of social enterprises in its 2011 communications 

“Towards a Single Market Act - twelve levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence” and 

“Creating a favourable climate for social enterprises, key stakeholders in the social economy 

and innovation”. 

 

Aware that these enterprises are active and could be a competitive player, the United Nations 

proclaimed 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives and launched several efforts, 

including the 2012 International Year of Cooperatives Conference in Cyprus, to set the 

cooperative movement in the political agenda. Among the discussed topics, the dialogue 

between cooperatives experts and EU policy markers, the overview of national cooperative 

legislations in Europe and the potential for revision of the European Cooperative Society 

regulation, and how Cooperatives could answer to the current economic crisis stand out.

Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

It was also organised another important conference to discuss the cooperative contributions to 

the EU 2020 strategy. Basically, EU 2020 aims for a “sustainable economy, putting people and 

responsibility first with a sustained fight against exclusion and a transition to a green 

economy”. As they already act in accordance with these principles, Cooperatives could bring 

specific answers and innovative solutions that aim at contributing to the EU 2020 strategy [34].  

 

Meanwhile, and realising that Cooperatives and the cooperative movement should be consulted 

and included in drafting new energy policies or implementing existing ones, Cooperatives 

Europe (CE) had raised, as part of an EU project on RES Cooperatives, to give voice to the 

cooperative business model at European level. The key objectives of this working group are to 

[34]: 

 

? Promote Cooperatives in the European energy agenda and support a decentralised 
energy strategy in the EU; 

? Strengthen visibility at EU level as a respectable agent in the energy and environment 
area and develop a European cooperative energy advocacy strategy with clear targets 

for policy makers; 

? Feed cooperation through joint actions and targeted cooperative networks and events. 

 

For instance, in 2012 the energy working group hosted two big events, both titled “Power to the 

People”. The first was within the EU sustainable energy week and the second was 

at Cooperatives United in Manchester. With these two events, it was pretended to outline the 

benefits of community energy and how community ownership can be increased [34]. 

 

Supported by the previous year recognition, the year 2013 started with good news for the 

cooperative movement when it was announced the EC proposal to integrate sustainability into 

companies’ strategies and activities. After all, this is something that Cooperatives have been 

doing for many years, informing members, citizens and consumers of the impact of their 

activities.  

On 26 June 2013, CE and Rescoop.EU, a project which is seeking to identify all the RE projects 

in Europe and promote RES Cooperatives as the next step forward in the energy transition, 

organised an event in the framework of the EU sustainable energy week entitled “Big energy: 

small energy? The role of cooperation for EU’s energy transition”. This event took place at the 

EC and the programme had included discussion about overcoming key challenges for 

introducing RE, the cooperative way of achieving the EU energy transition, local and regional 

RE partnerships, effects of EU policy on local/regional RE initiatives and the learns from the 

EU’s liberalisation approaches [34]. 

Maybe influenced by this conference, the history says some days after it was made another step 

in the right direction towards a “real recognition” that in Europe there are different ways of 

doing business, particularly Cooperatives enterprises, which equally deserve special attention of 

policy makers, when the EPC adopted by vote a report on the contribution of cooperative model 

during the economic and social crisis, which Europe is still facing today, and a motion for 

resolution on the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan [34]. This motion complies with the 

plurality of business forms, a principle recognised in the funding treaties of the EU, but which 

was barely mentioned in the EC’s texts since the publication of “A renewed EU strategy 2011-

2014 for Corporate Social Responsibility“, two years before.

So far, the year 2014 has been a mix of feelings for RES Cooperatives in particular. Despite the 

EC’s announcement that a group of experts would be created to build up clear recommendations 

on cooperative training and education, financing of Cooperatives, and business development 

support services, they also released the EU 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, 

which at the moment despite the slightly improved guidelines still does not support local efforts 

towards decentralised energy production. This framework pretends to define the EU’s climate 

and energy policies beyond 2020, building on the experience and lessons learnt from the EU 

2020 strategy, and according to the first package draft, the national targets have been eliminated 

and, as expected, the energy savings target will not be taking into account until the EC review 

the effects of the energy efficiency directive [34].  

In response to the document, CE asked for three ambitious binding targets at the EU level on: 

 
? Energy efficiency; 
? RE share; 
? Reduction for greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). 

 

CE believes these binding targets need to be broken down into 28 individual national level 

targets ensuring then an equal approach among EU members, once national binding targets 

drive to policy decisions, give investment signals and clarity on the pathways that need to be 

taken by national industries (Figure 47). Only then it is possible to have a stable long-term 

framework, which promotes new investments into the energy transition, particularly in RES 

Cooperatives, in order to reach Europe’s energy autonomy and affirm its leadership in a 

competitive, green economy.  

 

 

Figure 47. Framework proposed by Cooperatives Europe that may promote new investments into the energy 

transition, particularly in RES Cooperatives 

 

Ideally, a market system can only work when all actors (small, medium and big companies) are 

included and are treated equally. However, the new guidelines keep overlooking the impact that 

RES Cooperatives are having in the energy transition, but also helping to better organise the 

energy demand, stabilise the IEM and reinforce indigenous supply sources. It is then expected 

that these guidelines are interfering with existing national and European laws, such as the 

renewable energy Directive 2009/28/EC, which takes into consideration the interests of local 

and regional RES generators, but it will be too late to Europe recognise and amend the mistakes 

of their recent energy guidelines? 

 

2014 was a year of parliamentary elections in Europe and it has been argued that the EU ought 

to listen its citizens’ discontentment and depending on the results, it could provide, or not, a 

crucial platform for building a stronger parliamentary network of cooperative supporters.  

Despite the result shows the ever increasing euroscepticism, the leadership is still in the hands 

of the two biggest political families (EPP and PES/S&amp;amp;D) followed by ALDE and the Greens, 

respectively (Figure 48). Elected the new EPC it is time to select the new EC president by an 

absolute majority, instead of merely approving her/him, as the previous Treaty stated. The 

choice fell on Jean-Claude Juncker (EPP).

Despite the recent Jean-Claude Juncker nomination for EC president, it is important to 

understand the impacts that this leadership will bring in the law making and definition of EU’s 

priorities for the next five years.   

In the end, Europe needs a new energy vision based on increased energy autonomy through 

RES, diversity of energy players through Cooperatives and citizens as drivers of change. Maybe 

the current Ukraine crisis and the linked energy security issue would encourage EC to ensure a 

more balanced policy framework, which includes all types of existing players, particularly RES 

Cooperatives. 

 

In parallel to the promotion made by international organisms, must be also developed efforts by 

the states of each country and the cooperative movement operating there.  

In general, at this moment it is possible to say the governmental promotional measures can be 

divided into direct promotion of energy Cooperatives and a more general promotion of RES, 

which may indirectly encourage and support the establishment of RES Cooperatives. 

Nevertheless, it is of maximum importance that these promotional measures must provide the 

conditions under which potential members of Cooperatives will be able to give birth to new 

Cooperatives, whose autonomy and democratic nature will be respected according to the 

cooperative principles and values [31]. 

In relation to the promotion by the cooperative movement, strengthening the vertical structure is 

fundamental in enabling RES Cooperatives to reach their full potential in producing sustainable 

energy and creating green jobs [31].  

By forming national or regional networks of RES Cooperatives is half way to reach the 

individual success. This is important with regard not only to capacity-building and knowledge 

transfer, but also to engage in policy and legislative dialogue and conduct public awareness 

campaigns, protecting thus the interests of each RES Cooperative. Financing for energy 

initiatives is also provided by the cooperative movement. Many savings and credit Cooperatives

provide specific loans to improve energy efficiency or to small and medium-sized enterprises 

involved in the energy sector, including RSE Cooperatives. This is an important role, as energy 

generation or distribution can require considerable amounts of investment, and access to finance 

is often a major challenge for RES Cooperatives [31]. However, and despite the advantages of 

such organism, in almost European countries no national federation of Cooperatives exists.  

 

4. Case studies analysis 

4.1. Introduction and Methodology 

In spite of the EU’s efforts in the recent years, the establishment of an IEM is far from being 

concluded. At the moment, across Europe the path through the full liberalisation has reached 

different levels as each MS approached the process in its own way, in accordance to their 

national particularities. However, this long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has 

opened a door for new visions, opportunities and, consequently, new independent energy 

players, in a number of European countries.  

RES Cooperatives are one of the natural outcomes of this transition and, today more than 

yesterday, have the potential to play a big role in response to the 21st century energy challenges 

of energy security and supply, as well as promoting RES. Right now they are shaping a new 

future for the energy market in Europe, giving the chance to the ordinary citizen to own, control 

and benefit from their own power and energy efficiency schemes. This last statement is going to 

be the gateway of this work.     

 

Thus, and inspired by the success of several RES Cooperatives across Europe and with the 

motivation to transform Coopérnico as the first green electricity supplier in Portugal, the main 

goals of this work are to understand the potential role that RES Cooperatives may have in the 

future of the liberalised energy sector not only across Europe, but particularly in Portugal, and 

be a successful guide for any RES Cooperative that aims to get in the national electricity retail 

market. 

Therefore, the first step of this work consists in the characterisation of four different European 

electricity markets (UK, ES, DE, BE), followed by the analysis of the role and experiences that 

each one of the selected case studies has faced in their own electricity supply market:    

 

? The Co-operative Energy, in United Kingdom (UK): The UK has one of the most 
powerful energy markets in Europe. Regarding to the domestic energy supply market, 

the UK has six major energy companies (British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower, Scottish 

Power and SSE) who supply over 98% of domestic customers. Therefore, The Co-

operative Energy was selected with the aim to understand how a RES Cooperative can 

be an alternative in such a competitive market and how did they manage to do it. 

? Som energia, in Spain (ES): Comparing the two energy sectors, it is possible to say the 
Spanish electricity market is quite similar to the Portuguese one, including the 

legislation in force. Moreover, both countries share an organised energy market, 

MIBEL. Because of these reasons is recommended to study the most reputable RES 

Cooperative in the Iberian Peninsula. 

? EWS, in Germany (DE): It is possible to say the EWS is probably one of the most 
respectable entities within the cooperative movement. EWS became an electricity 

supplier even before the liberalisation of the energy markets. Because of its story, 

motivations, business model and structure, as well as the European system where the

RES Cooperative operates, is natural that this RES Cooperative was chosen as a case 

study. 

? Ecopower, in Belgium (BE): A work in which the central theme are the RES 
Cooperatives, it is inevitable not to mention the EcoPower. In fact, this RES 

Cooperative is one of the pioneers of the movement and probably the best example to 

study regarding to electricity supply activity. Moreover, the RES Cooperative is one of 

the founders of the European group RESCoop. 

 

With this study, it is expected a real assessment regarding the possible positive and negative 

effects not only for Coopérnico, but for a RES Cooperative that aims to operate in the 

Portuguese electricity market. 

  

The second step of the work is related to the comparison between the four selected markets with 

the Portuguese case. Moreover, the current situation of the liberalisation in the national 

electricity system, as well as the legislation to which it is adjacent, plus a brief description of the 

current electricity suppliers companies operating in Portugal will be studied.  

 

Furthermore, all the steps and necessary requirements for a energy cooperative to become a new 

electricity supplier in Portugal will be compiled.  

 

4.2. Electricity Sector in the United Kingdom 

4.2.1. An Overview of the British Liberalised Market 

 

Figure 49. United Kingdom and its countries 

 

The British electricity market has four distinct geographical territories (Figure 49): the main 

island divided by Wales in the South, Scotland in the North with England between, plus the 

Northern Ireland in the West of the main island.  

 

As introduced above in chapter one, the UK was the first European country to launch concrete 

and innovative measures that led to the deregulation and liberalisation of its electricity market. 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

71 

 

The success of the initiative was so evident that shortly after it inspired the neighbouring 

European electricity markets to follow and adopt the same line of policies.  

 

It is hard to define the British energy model; however there are some main features that 

characterised the British liberalisation process [36]:  

 

? The creation of a wholesale spot market, as the main price-setting arena for wholesale 
electricity sales; 

? The creation of retail competition, so that all consumers can freely choose their 
electricity supplier; 

? The separation between competitive sectors and non-competitive sectors, including the 
clear corporate separation between the four activities. 

 

Before the nineties’ liberalisation, the generation and transmission in England and Wales were 

responsibility of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB)4, whilst in Scotland and 

Northern Ireland the task was carried out by North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB), 

South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) and Northern Ireland Electricity Board (NIEB), 

respectively. All these companies were nationalised [37]. 

 

Regarding the distribution and supply, whilst in Scotland and Northern Ireland these activities 

were also under control of NSHEB, SSEB and NIEB, in England and Wales they were provided 

by twelve regional Area Electricity Boards (AEB).  

 

Besides the CEGB, the Electricity Act 1957 established also an Electricity Council, which was 

the policy-making body for the Electricity Supply Industry [38]. In England and Wales the 

Electricity Council, established in 1957, played an important coordinating role in the electricity 

system, bringing together directors from the CEGB and AEB. 

 

Before the liberalisation, and concerning the transmission network, there were four electricity 

transmission grids operated independently, by each one of the companies previously 

enumerated: CEGB, NSHEB, SSEB and NIEB [37].  

 

                                                      
4 CEGB’ responsibilities were to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system 
of electricity supply in entire England and Wales, including the production or acquisition of electricity 

and to provide that energy for the AEB’s distribution. It also had power to provide electricity to the 

Scottish Boards or electricity undertakings outside UK [38].

72 

 

 

 

Figure 50. Main features of the pre British liberalisation 

 

Until the late eighties, these nationalised companies fully dominated the British electricity 

sector (Figure 50). Nevertheless, the scenario changed when the British government, led on that 

period by Margaret Thatcher, introduced for the first time some liberalisation, followed by 

reorganisation and privatisation measures, into the electricity system. Basically, it was the kick 

starter for the construction of the British electricity market as it’s known today, and that inspired 

the creation of the European IEM.      

 

Thereby, the first step towards the post British electricity system liberalisation were made still 

in the early eighties, by the 1983 Energy Act, that removed the requirement that only AEB could 

supply electricity [39]. 

The document imposed on the AEB the duty to buy electricity on “fair terms” from a private 

generator or supplier and allow it to use the transmission and distribution system. However, the 

1983 Energy Act had a very limited impact with only a small number of private companies 

entering the market, because of excessive costs of third party access to the CEGB’s national grid 

[40]. 

 

The second wave of new polities came with privatisation measures, whose main challenge was 

to reorganise the sector in order to introduce a real competition among the players. On that time, 

there were some constraints to competition in transmission and distribution networks, once 

these activities were natural monopolies. Thus, it has only been possible to attempt to create real 

market competition in generation and supply activities.

As a result, in the late eighties the preparation for privatisation begun (Electricity Act 1989
5
), 

and between 1990 and 1993, the generating and AEB companies in England and Wales, plus the 

NSHEB, SSEB and NIEB were all sold off [37]. 

For instance, the CEGB’s breakup led to three new generating companies, called Powergen, 

National Power and Nuclear Electric, and a transmission company entitled National Grid. 

Despite all the companies were down as private, with exception of Nuclear Electric that 

remained publicly owned until 1996, they were initially protected from unwanted takeover bids 

by the British government’s Golden Shares scheme. This meant that investors could acquire 

significant shareholdings in electricity companies but would not be able to gain a controlling 

interest [37].  

 

Regarding the Scottish companies, both were privatised as two vertically integrated regulated 

utilities in 1991, free to sell electricity into the English and Welsh market: The Scottish Hydro-

Electric (SHE), which later became Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), and the Scottish 

Power (SP) [36].  

Once there was a strong political opposition in Scotland to the Thatcher privatisation 

programme and the break-up process of the existing companies, SHE and SP remained 

responsible not only for the generation activity, but also for transmission and distribution 

networks. As Scotland was, and is today, characterised by sparsely-populated areas, the British 

government accepted that these companies were also charged of the supply of electricity [36]. 

Finally, in respect to Northern Ireland, it was followed the same model as in Scotland. That 

means, NIEB’s privatisation led also to a new fully vertically integrated company: Northern 

Ireland Electricity (NIE).  

 

Regarding the 12 AEB, they were also privatised and converted into 12 Regional Electricity 

Companies (REC): 1- East Midlands Electricity; 2- Eastern Electricity; 3- London Electricity; 

4- Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board (Manweb); 5- Midlands Electricity; 6- 

Northern Electricity; 7- North Western Electricity Board; 8-  South Eastern Electricity Board; 9- 

South Wales Electricity; 10- South Western Electricity; 11- Southern Electric and 12- Yorkshire 

Electricity (Figure 51).

5 Among the several objectives published in The Electricity Act 1989, the document laid down the 

foundations for the government’s privatisation plans. For instance, the Act introduced a competitive 

market into electricity generation and supply, and a system of independent regulation responsible for 

ensuring an efficient and competitive electricity market and for protecting customer interests [41].

Just like the new generation companies, the 12 REC were protected by the Golden Shares 

scheme [37].  

 

Trying to bring competition into the industry, the two biggest generation companies (National 

Power and Powergen) were allowed to supply electricity directly to larger consumers while the 

RECs were allowed to invest in generating capacity until a certain ammount of power [37].  

Thus, by 1996, National Power and Powergen were required to sell off some of their generating 

capacity. The purchaser was the largest REC, Eastern Electric, despite the company exceeded 

the previous limit of only obtaining 15% of its power from its own generating capacity, and this 

breech of the retail/generating limit was then followed by SP when it acquired the REC Manweb 

[37]. 

In order to promote this requirement and to allow a much greater degree of integration across 

the whole industry, in 1998 the Labour government, that had been elected the previous year, 

decided to allow the generators to buy retail providers as long as they sold off more of their 

generating capacity [37].  

 

At the same time, in 1995, the Golden Shares protection system scheme ran out, and the 

consequence was the immediately take-over of the private companies, especially seven of REC, 

by outside players, particularly American undertakings [36].  

Two years later, in 1997, and taking into account the industry regulator’s concern that REC 

were using their effective regional monopolies on distribution to subsidise their retail activities, 

the companies were required to legally separate their distribution and retail activities, although 

they could still continue to own both operations. 

This decision, and the rising competitive environment in the sector, led that most of the 

American companies sold their interests in Britain, and a new set of European owners took 

control of the electricity sector in UK.  

 

As one of the four elements that characterise the price of electricity charged to the end-user 

customer is the wholesale price charged by the generators, another innovation of the British 

model in order to introduce more competition was the creation of a wholesale spot market in 

1990, Electricity Pool of England and Wales, where the generating companies could sell their 

output energy at changing prices in response to the demands of the REC and any new entrants 

on the supply side [37].  

Simple economic theory dictates that a reduction in supply will force up price and many 

observers suggested that the electricity pool was open to manipulation by the large generators 

[37]. By other words, they could together set the system marginal price for the bulk of the time 

through limiting available generating capacity. In addition, the electricity pool was more than 

often bypassed in favour of longer term bilateral contracts, known as Contract for Differences, 

that hedged the risk of the volatile pool prices.  

A review of the Electricity Pool of England and Wales led to its replacement in March 2001 by 

the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) and four years later, in 2005, due to more 

restructuring of the electricity system, followed with further integration of generating and 

supply, NETA evolved to the British Electricity Transmission and Trading Arrangements 

(BETTA), when Scotland joined into the market for the first time [37].

Since end of 2007, there is a wholesale electricity market operating in Ireland and Northern 

Ireland on an All-Island basis, called Single Electricity Market (SEM). Basically, the SEM was 

designed to provide for the least cost source of electricity generation to meet customer demand 

at any one time across the island, while also maximising long-term sustainability and reliability 

[42]. 

 

The British wholesale market have been evolving, and today, besides BETTA, there are three 

different organised energy markets operating in the country: the first independent power 

exchange created in the UK, at the same time than NETA, called APX Power UK, the 

Intercontinental Exchange [43], and in 2010 it was launched the latest market for UK energy 

contracts, Nasdaq OMX N2EX. From the three organised energy markets, APX Power UK, 

formerly The United Kingdom Power Exchanges -UKPX, is the cornerstone of the UK spot 

market and is used by members on a 24/7 basis for the majority of their within day balancing 

requirements. 

 

Now that is overviewed the main lines of the liberalisation process in the UK to the present, it 

will be also interesting to understand what such measures brought and caused in the industry 

(Figure 52). As any other electricity system, the British one is composed by four sectors (Figure 

53): Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Supply. 

 

Starting by the last activity, the British retail market was opened up in three stages. Firstly, on 

privatisation of the electricity sector in 1990, only industrial customers with consumption 

greater than 1 MW a year were allowed to choose their electricity supplier. Four years later, in 

1994, the open market was extended to customers with a 100 kW annual demand and since 

1999 the British retail market is fully opened to competition, when domestic customers were 

allowed to switch its electricity supplier whenever they want [37]. 

As result, the number of electricity supply companies has increased significantly with new 

companies entering the retail market. The only thing they need to operate is a license to supply 

electricity. Nevertheless, as it will be discussed next, the market is completely dominated by six 

companies, with many of the licensed operators acting as simply agents for these companies.   

 

All of the leading six supply companies are also established in the generation sector, through 

subsidiaries, with significant shares. At the same time, more than 50 new generating companies 

had entered the generation market, through a license agreement. 

 

Whilst in England and Wales, the transmission network system is still responsibility of National 

Grid, due to vertical unbundling in Scotland the transmission network is responsibility of the 

subsidiaries of SP (SP Transmission) and SSE (SSE Transmission). In Northern Ireland the TSO 

is EirGrid, company which purchased SONI (the previous TSO) to NIE [44].   

The TSOs‘ statutory duties, provided under The Electricity Act 1989, The Utilities Act 2000
6
 

and their transmission licenses, are among others the developing and maintaining of an efficient, 

                                                      
6 The Utilities Act 2000 was fundamental in amending the industry structure and regulatory framework. 

The purpose of the document was to advocate market development through integrated regulation of the 

gas and electricity markets, the separation of electricity supply and distribution, and the creation of the 

necessary framework to underpin the introduction of NETA. Moreover, the document also provided 

guidelines to protect the interests of consumers, wherever possible through the promotion of competition.

coordinated and economic transmission system, which facilitate competition in electricity 

generation and supply and protect the environment [41]. 

 

In respect to the distribution sector, in the beginning seven of the 12 REC were acquired by 

American companies, which later sold their shares to European firms. Nevertheless, they were 

always in control of the local monopoly distribution networks in their franchise areas. At the 

moment, there are 15 licensed DSO in the UK, held by 8 companies that will be identified right 

after. Besides the 15 licensed DSO, there are also 7 Independent DSO (IDSO) licenses. 

The REC’ licenses set out a number of public service and other obligations such as ensuring 

continuity and supply, non-discrimination, prohibition of cross-subsidies, price controls and the 

obligation to contract for a specific amount of capacity from non-fossil fuels each year [41]. 

There is another license, referred as second tier licenses, required for those suppliers who wish 

to sell to any customer attached to the distribution networks. RECs can also obtain second tier 

licenses to enable them to compete in distribution networks other than their own.  

SP Energy Networks and SSE Power Distribution hold second tier licenses and can supply 

customers across the UK electricity market, likewise any second tier license holders can supply 

customers in Scotland [41].  

 

The Electricity Act 1989 also introduced a regulatory system headed by a Director General of 

Supply (DGS), responsible for ensuring an efficient and competitive electricity market and for 

protecting customer interests.  

In 1999, the regulatory offices for electricity and gas were merged to create the Office for Gas 

and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).  

Ofgem is governed by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GAEMA) and its powers are 

provided under The Gas Act 1986, The Electricity Act 1989 and The Utilities Act 2000. Ofgem, 

through advocating competition, is focussed on promoting and protecting the interests of gas 

and electricity customers and licensing and monitoring the gas and electricity companies, taking 

action where necessary to ensure compliance [41].  

Northern Ireland has its own regulatory body: The Northern Ireland Authority for Utility 

Regulation (UREGNI), previously known as Ofreg. UREGNI’ duties are similar to Ofgem’, and 

includes the promotion of competition in the electricity industry, the protection of electricity 

and gas consumers, and the arbitrary in disputes between consumer and supplier [45]. 

Regarding the monopoly of transmission and distribution networks, they were subject to 

independent regulation. 

                                                                                                                                                            
A number of the provisions within the Act seek improved regulation through transparency, consistency 

and predictability [41].

Comparing to 1999, the number of generating companies more than duplicated. Despite, more 

than 60 companies own nowadays power stations across the UK, many of these are small power 

producers with relatively low capacity [37]. In fact, the 10 biggest generating companies (RWE 

Npower, E.ON Powergen, SSE, SP, Centrica, British Energy, International Power, Drax Power, 

AES and EDF Energy) own more than 80% of the total UK power capacity.  

The other 20% is responsibility of companies such as Amegni Renewables, Dong Energy, 

Community Windpower, Ecogen, Ecotricity, Eneco, Energy 4-All Cooperative, Enertrag, 

Exxon, among others. 

 

In Great Britain, there are four TSOs: National Grid operating in England and Wales, SSE and 

SP Energy Networks in Scotland and finally, Eirgrid in Northern Ireland. Their job is to 

maintain the flow of generated electricity through to the regional distribution networks, which 

are controlled by eight companies (Figure 54): Electricity North West, Northern Ireland 

Electricity, Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution, Scottish 

Power Energy Networks, UK Power Networks and Western Power Distribution [44]. 

 

Besides the 15 licensed DSO, there are 7 Independent DSO (IDSO) licenses: Energetics 

Electricity Limited, EP Electricity Limited, Harlaxton Energy Networks Limited, Independent 

Power Networks Limited, The Electricity Network Company Limited, UK Power Networks 

(IDNO) Ltd and Utility Assets Limited [44]. 

 

 

Figure 54. DSOs operating in the UK 

 

These transmission and distribution networks are used by the electricity suppliers, which supply 

and sell electricity to customers. Nowadays, there are more than 70 licensed electricity 

companies operating in the British domestic sector [44].

Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Figure 55. Domestic electricity supply market shares, by company [46] 

 

The market is dominated by 6 big companies, Centrica/British Energy, EDF Energy, RWE 

Npower, E.ON Powergen, SP and Scottish and Southern Energy. Besides the Big 6, there are 18 

smaller suppliers, making a total of 24 electricity suppliers operating in the UK. 

 

According to Ofgem’s report [46], in January 2014 the Big 6 market share was between 11% 

and 25% (Figure 55). It is important to highlight the solid growth that smaller suppliers are 

registering. The reasons are several, and include the low level of trust in the bigger companies, 

dissatisfaction by the service provided, easy access to information and rising awareness for a 

new energetic paradigm, besides the obviously monetary savings. Other interpretation may be 

related to the fact that the big 6 energy companies are not competing as hard as they did in the 

past to win customers from each other.  

 

In the category of smaller suppliers, stands out companies as The Co-operative Energy, 

Ecotricity, Good Energy, Utilita, First Utility, Spark Energy, Ovo Energy, Green Energy, Flow 

Energy, Utility Warehouse, among others, which besides collecting a market share around 1% 

are slowly increasing in the number of customers. Of the 18 smaller suppliers currently in the 

domestic market, only four have expanded to around 1/4 million customers, including The Co-

operative Energy. 

The path for these companies, as the following one, is long and tortuous, because there are 

significant barriers that prevent their expansion.  

 

4.2.3. The Co-operative Energy 

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

One of the smaller suppliers that are becoming an alternative to the big 6 energy, is The Co-

operative Energy. Born in 2010, is the only Cooperative supplier in the electricity market, and 

because of its values and mission has been awarded with a couple prizes, including the 

Consumer Action Award at the Which? Award 2011 and the Best Energy Provider Award at the 

Consumer Moneyfacts Awards 2012 [47].  

 

The Co-operative Energy is part of The Midcounties Co-operative, the largest independent co-

operative in the UK with more than 430 000 members [47]. The number of members is updated 

every three years, when the members who don’t trade see their membership canceled.  

Result of the cooperative movement that was established in the beginning of the ninetienth 

century, The Midcounties Co-operative’s history began in the middle of the same century, when 

some people realised that they could achieve far more by acting collectively than they ever 

would alone. 

 

Thus, inspired by the first successful retail cooperative society that was brought to life by the 

Rochdale Pioneers, in 1844, many people decided to copy the model and values of success (, 

that today are followed by every Cooperative), and set up their own local Cooperative stores in 

towns and villages across the UK.  

Years later, some of the Cooperatives combined with others to eventually form The Midcounties 

Co-operative. Among them, are the Swindon in 1853, Gloucester in 1860, Walsall and Chipping 

Norton both in 1866, Oxford in 1872 and Cinderford in 1874. The reasons why they merged are 

simple: partly to increase their purchasing power and partly to compete more effectively against 

the conventional retailers. At the end of the twentieth century, more mergers led to two big 

societies in the Midcounties region: 

 

? Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Cooperative Society (OSG); 
? West Midlands Cooperative Society (WMCS). 

   

In 2005, the members of these two Cooperatives decided to do one last merge, and the result 

was The Midcounties Co-operative. Nowadays, this powerful Cooperative has several business 

groups, including Food, Funeralcare, Travel, Pharmacy, Post Office or Child Care, among 

others. However, only in 2010, the society entered in the Energy business, through the creation 

of The Co-operative Energy [47]. 

 

Focusing in the case study, at the moment The Co-operative Energy covers England, Wales and 

Scotland, i.e., the entire UK. Moreover, they are committed to providing low carbon energy 

with simple tariffs with clear billing. Bu how they will achieve that? 

 

With no shareholders to please, but its members, The Co-operative Energy aims to be Britain’s 

most trusted energy supplier, through [47]: 

 

? Trusted on price: the Cooperative ensures to keep the prices consistently competitive. 
Moreover they aims to keep their tariffs as simple and transparent as possible, made up 

of a monthly fixed charge and a single unit price for energy consumed;

81 

 

? Trusted on fairness: Like all Cooperatives, The Co-operative Energy is ethical in its 
dealing with people and businesses. That means, new customers won't be favoured over 

existing ones and there will be periodical reports regarding the energy costs, how much 

money the Cooperative make and how that profit is shared between members and 

reinvested in new projects.  

? Trusted on service: It is Cooperative’s intentions to keep all their operations in Britain. 
? Trusted on environment: Besides supporting new RES projects across the country, the 

Cooperative aims to keep the carbon content of its electricity below half the national 

average.  

 

Based on these guidelines, two years after its formation and granted the license by the energy 

regulator, in 2013 the Cooperative achieved the mark of 150 000 customers, becoming then an 

seriously alternative to the big 6 energy suppliers. Currently, The Co-operative Energy is the 

electricity supplier of nearly 250 000 customers in the entire country [48].  

This is the result of the creation of a wider range of products to its customers. For instance, the 

Cooperative launched a new version of its competitively priced Pioneer variable tariff. 

Moreover, The Co-operative Energy also now offers a range of fixed-term tariffs to new and 

existing customers, which guarantee prices for one, two and three years. 

 

It is not mandatory to become a member, when a customer chooses The Co-operative Energy as 

its electricity supplier. However, it’s quite easy and cheap to become a member, around € 1, and 

once a member the citizen in return will receive 1 point. Obviously, the member will get more 

points the more he invests in the Cooperative. Then, twice a year it will distributed a profit 

share, based on how many points the member have accumulated [47].  

 

 

Figure 56. The Midcounties Co-operative membership card 

 

A fairly good idea is that, customers of Co-operative Energy become members of The 

Midcounties Co-operative, alongside customers of Midcounties’ other businesses (Figure 56). 

Thus, the member can accumulate points when shop in the cooperative stores or online [47].

82 

 

 

Figure 57. Spain and its autonomous communities 

  

The Kingdom of Spain is a Constitutional monarchy located on the Iberian Peninsula in south-

western Europe, and is composed by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities with 

varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution (Figure 57).  

Despite Spain is organisationally structured, once all autonomous communities have their own 

elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets and resources, the Spanish 

Constitution states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. 

 

Going straight to the point, Spain was one of the first European countries to transpose the First 

Directive. In fact, the Spanish electricity liberalisation process started in late November 1997 

[49]. As the liberalisation progress across Europe was presenting low results, the EU members 

were forced to adopt a new demanding framework (Second Directive), which Spain transposed 

to its legislation in 2007 [50]. In 2012, it was transposed into Spanish national law the last 

document regarding the adoption of the Third Directive [51].        

 

The pre liberalisation period, focusing between 1983 and 1996, was characterised by The 

National Energy Plans (PENs). After the global oil crisis, the Spanish government came up 

with large investments programmes in an attempt to regulate the sector’s financial problems. 

Therefore, in 1983 an agreement was signed between the main companies and the government 

and one year later, the regulation and legal ordering of the Spanish electricity sector was set by 

Law 49/1984. Thus, in 1985, Spain became the first European country to adopt an independent 

system operator when it was formed a state-owned company, Red Electrica de España (REE), 

responsible for the high-voltage transmission assets of all firms in the sector. REE also directed 

the central dispatch of the system [52]. 

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

83 

 

Before the liberalisation, the generation and distribution sectors were linked, by ownership, to 

UNESA7 (a group of companies composed mainly by Endesa (on that period a government-

owned generation company), Iberdrola, Unión Fenosa and Hidcrocantábrico). In the nineties a 

process of concentration occurred leading thus to Endesa’s dominant position with the 

acquisition of Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad and other subsequent asset consolidations. 

As a result, Endesa achieved half of the Spanish generation share and 40% of the distribution 

market. The second group, Iberdrola held a generation quota of 29% and 38% for distribution. 

The third and fourth generators, Unión Fenosa and Hidrocantábrico, had 13% and 6% in 

generation and 15% and 5% in distribution [52].  

On that time, a new phenomenon arose: Self generation. It was facilitated by generous pricing 

provisions for excess power sold to the network. Obviously, there were legal limits to the size of 

self-generation facilities, which qualify for these pricing terms [53]. 

 

In relation to regulation, in 1987 the regime has been organised around The Stable Legal 

Framework, or Marco Legal y Estable (MLE) law. Fundamentally, the MLE worked like price 

cap regulation, establishing then standard costs for all factors of generation that later were used 

to produce tariffs, that generated revenues collected by distribution companies [53]. 

This regulatory regime encouraged efficiency. Since the companies knew what their revenues 

will be under the MLE, they knew that cost reduction will increased profits. 

 

The final phase was in the early nineties, when in end of 1994 the Spanish government enacted 

a new electricity law, known as Law Ordering the National Electricity Sector (LOSEN), which 

intended to increase competition and transparency in the sector, but keeping the positive 

elements of the MLE. The three principal features of LOSEN were the creation of a regulatory 

authority, The National Commission for the Electricity System (CNSE), requiring competitive 

bidding for all new generation and allowing for an “independent system” for those parties who 

seek to bypass the existing national system [53].  

 

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the Spanish electricity sector before the liberalisation 

operated as an integrated system (Figure 58). The transmission network and the short term 

management of the capacity for generation were in the hands of an independent entity, REE. 

The power generation needs for the entire network were defined by the PENs. Distribution, for 

the most part, was the responsibility of the four large vertically integrated companies. These 

companies were also responsible for the supply within certain geographic regions and had the 

exclusive right to do so. These companies were integrated into the sector’s managerial group 

UNESA. Furthermore, there were some small distribution companies that acquired electricity by 

UNESA companies and resold it to the consumers. 

 

                                                      
7 UNESA is a utility association that has traditionally played a substantial role in coordinating the 

activities of the utilities, including coordinated planning, negotiation of fuel purchases with suppliers, 

analysis of economic and financial issues, and research and development. It has represented the utilities 

before national bodies such as the CNSE. Liberalisation of the electricity market required the utilities to 

undertake commercial activities such as fuel purchasing separately. Due to such changes UNESA has 

been required to redefine its activities and change from a corporation to a non-profit association with the 

potential for much broader membership [54].

Figure 58. Main features of the pre Spanish liberalisation 

 

The first step towards the liberalisation of the Spanish electricity market was made in 1997 with 

the approval of the Spanish Electric Power Act 54/19978 [55]. After a decade of reforms, this 

first document provided the basis for the creation of an open wholesale market, the choice of 

suppliers to the largest electricity customers and mandated price decreases to those remaining 

under regulated tariffs.  

During the two following years, further legislation amendments and Royal Decrees have 

widened the choice more quickly to medium-sized consumers, cut regulated prices more deeply 

than originally planned, and encourage greater activity in the wholesale market by lowering 

access tariffs [54]. 

 

Despite the Act 54/1997 established the legal separation between the regulated activities 

(transmission and distribution) and the liberalised activities (generation and supply), given the 

fact that they are natural monopolies, the document kept the possibility to integrate these 

activities in the same group enterprise [54].  

                                                      
8 The Act 54/1997 establishes the basic legal framework for generation, transmission, distribution, and 

sale of electricity. It left behind the public service system approach and provided the basis for the 

liberalisation or privatisation of the Spanish electricity sector [54].

Through this new framework, the regulated activities allowed the regulated TPA to the 

networks, under the conditions established in the regulation and through the payment of an 

access tariff. 

 

Royal Decree-Law 17/2007 modified the previous Act to the stipulations of Second Directive on 

common rules for the IEM. For instance, the document introduced the functional and accounting 

separation of regulated activities.  

Two years later, through the Royal Decree-Law 485/2009, it was introduced measures regarding 

the protection of vulnerable customers, protection of consumers’ fundamental rights and 

promotion of economic and social cohesion, such as the last resort supply concept and the 

additive calculation mechanism used to set last resort tariffs based on the cost of energy, the 

access tariff and an additional cost for commercial management [51].  

 

The latest significant amendment to the original document was done two years ago, through the 

Royal Decree-Law 13/2012. With this new framework, it was granted new powers and 

reinforced duties to CNE on unbundling, consumers’ protection and the approval of 

methodologies concerning transmission and distribution access tariffs in order to create a single 

regulatory authority at national level. Moreover, the document introduced new measures 

regarding the supply activity (vulnerable consumer concept and requirements), appointment and 

certification of TSO and effective separation of the four activities (FOU) [51]. 

 

Since 1998, Spain has a fully competitive generation market. Although in the beginning the four 

largest generation companies represented more than 85% of the total Spanish production, with 

entry of new competitors this share has reduced gradually. 

Iberdrola, Unión Fenosa and Hidrocantábrico were originally privately owned companies. 

Endesa become also private, when in 1998 the government’s remaining shares were sold. 

However, the government retained Golden Shares until 2005. 

All generators are entitled to have access to transmission and distribution networks through an 

authorisation procedure [54]. However, there is another type of generation regime: the special 

one, which is also granted, through an authorisation, to generators with production of equal or 

less than 50 MW, self-generators using cogeneration or other forms of electricity generation 

associated to RES.  

 

In order to provide more competition to the sector, at the same time it was also created an 

wholesale electricity market: MIBEL (formerly OMEL). Basically, this organised market, that 

will be later discussed, allowed generating companies to compete and sell their electricity in a 

centralised pool and/or through bilateral contracts with buyers. 

 

Regarding the transmission activity, in early 1999 the government controlled 60% of REE and 

each of the four main companies held 10%, the maximum permissible share of total capital per 

individual owner. Some months after, the government announced its plan to sell a share of 35% 

to small shareholders and institutional and foreign investors.  

In 2007, the Royal Decree-Law 17/2007 established the single-carrier model with REE as the 

owner of entire transmission network, including the technical and financial management of the 

system [56].

Distribution activity occurs through the utilities operating under a concession granted by the 

autonomous regional authorities or the national government, in the case of distributors serving 

more than one autonomous community.  

The Cooperative model is well disseminated across Spain. Thus, besides the main companies, 

currently there are also a number of independent small DSO across the country. Until 2009, they 

also sold electricity to customers. 

 

The Spanish supply activity took almost 10 years to become fully open to competition. It all 

started in 1998 with largest customers and was extended to domestic customers in 2003. Despite 

the several timetables, at the end all high-voltage consumers (using supply above 1 kW) were 

eligible to choose supplier from 1 July 2000. All other customers were scheduled to be able to 

choose suppliers in 2003 [54]. 

Nowadays, new companies can also enter the retail supply of electricity to liberalised customers 

under authorisation from the appropriate level of government. Approval of the autonomous 

community government is required for regional/local retailing. 

 

Besides CNSE, the independent regulatory commission established in 1994, whose main 

functions are advisory and dispute-related resolution, approval of mergers and acquisition into 

transmission and distribution companies, two new entity were created [56]:  

 

? The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (MIET): assumes policy 
responsibilities for the reforms and it also has the most significant regulatory functions. 

In particular, it is responsible for setting regulated retail tariffs, network access tariffs 

and various charges. Moreover, it authorises new generators and approves transmission 

projects. 

? The National Commission for Energy (CNE): took over the responsibilities for the 
energy sector and the hydrocarbon fuels. Nowadays, the role and functions of this 

regulatory authority were transferred to National Commission for Markets and 

Competition (CNMC), a new entity that was established in 2013. The new authority 

merges the competition body with several sectorial regulators (energy, 

telecommunications, audio-visual, transport and postal), with the aim of guaranteeing, 

preserving and fostering the correct operation, transparency and effective competition in 

all sectors and markets. 

 

Moreover, autonomous communities have competencies in several areas, including the approval 

of  

distribution facilities and other electric facilities “when their use does not affect other regions” 

(for instance, small generation facilities), the concession rights for electricity distribution, and 

development of regulations with respect to connection of supply, and the enforcement of 

regulations with respect to quality of service.  

The autonomous communities also play an important role in supporting the development of 

independent generation, and have the right to put additional charges on the bills of electricity 

customers in their region to recover the costs of such support. 

 

All the previous information can be summarised in Figure 59. As a consequence of such 

measures, nowadays the Spanish electricity system can be represented through Figure 60.

Spanish electricity generation is still dominated by the historical players, Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas 

Natural Fenosa (formerly Unión Fenosa), EDP/Hidrocantábrico and E.ON. Nevertheless, there 

are some other companies, whose market share is registering a significant growing. Companies 

such as Fersa, Zabalgarbi, Alpic Energía España, Gorona de Viento, GDF Suez, ENEL Green 

Power España, Torresol Energy, Eolia, Anselmo León, Barbo Energías Renovables, Acciona or 

Cooperatives, as Som Energia, Enercoop and GoiEner, are taking advantage of the European 

Directives and recent RES policies to increase their significance in the Spanish energy market 

[57].   

  

Whilst there is only one TSO in Spain, REE, the DSOs are usually commercial companies or 

Cooperatives. Currently, there are more than 300 distribution companies operating in Spain, 

including for instance the 5 largest energy companies in Spain, Agri-Energia, Aguas de 

Barbastro Energía, Bassols Energia, Berruerza, Central Electrica Mitjans, Compañia de 

Electricidad del Condado, Dielenor, Dielesur, Alarcon Navarro Empresa Electrica, Alset 

Electrica, Anselmo Leon Distribucion, among many others [57]. 

 

Although Spain has more than 160 active electricity suppliers at present, the most important are 

those that are obliged to supply the vulnerable customers: Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural 

Fenosa, EDP/Hidrocantábrico Energía and E.ON.  

 

 

Figure 61. Evolution of the number of suppliers with a significant volume of customers in the distribution 

areas of the five largest players [58] 

 

As shown in the Figure 61, the suppliers that are not related to the 5 traditional energy 

companies are progressively increasing their share in the free market. According to CNMC’s 

report [58], in 2013, the companies with the highest growth in relative terms in the domestic 

segment were Fenie Energía, Som Energia, Audax Energía, Watium, HolaLuz and Gesternova, 

which are suppliers with no links to any distribution areas.   

In the end of 2013, the retail market had a switching rate of 12%, one of the highest in Europe, 

which means the Spanish customer is more aware than in the past of the options available in the 

market. There are several reasons that may be linked to this high switching rate and the slowly 

increase of small companies’ influence, as the prices billed, consumer dissatisfaction and the 

rising awareness for a new energetic paradigm. Other possible reason is the fact that the 

regulated tariffs are coming to the end, forcing then the consumer to move to the liberalised 

market and choose one of the several suppliers operating in the country.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

89 

 

In spite of this advances, in December 2013 the 5 largest supplier companies still registered 

almost 80% of the total volume of energy supplied in the free market (Figure 62), 97% if 

consider only the domestic sector. 

 

 

Figure 62. Evolution of the market share, by company [58] 

 

Besides Som Energia, there are others Cooperatives actives in the retail market, such as 

GoiEner, Nosa Enerxía S.C.G or Zencer, which also provides green electricity to domestic end-

users, trying then to push the world into a better energetic paradigm. 

 

4.3.3. Som Energia 

 

 

In Spain, the object of study chosen for this work is the Som Energia, which have been 

operating in the country for exactly four years. Looking back at the history of Som Energia, or 

“We are Energy” translated to English, the idea of creating a company that promotes the RES 

and the sustainable development just came up in 2010, when a group of people linked to the 

University of Girona decided to reproduce the formula of success established in other European 

countries, in promoting a new electricity model more citizen-friendly. Under this concept was 

born the Som Energia,  the first renewable energy cooperative in Catalonia and the reality has 

been showing the positive impact that this movement is operating, not only in the region, but in 

the whole Spain [59].  

 

Although the idea was created in the beginning of 2010, only in the end of the same year the 

project is extended to a cooperative model. Right after this event, in September of 2011, they 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

started to provide electricity, based on green energy, and one month later it was built the 

construction of its first RES power plants.  

Besides the main activities (production and supply), it is also Som Energia’ intentions to fight 

the unemployment, through the promotion of green jobs in the local communities where the 

future projects will be installed, and to disseminate a new energy culture in Spain. Nowadays, 

Som Energia also promotes measures for energy saving among their members.  

 

Moreover, and under the promoting of a new energy paradigm, the Cooperative aims to 

introduce an educational and mentality shift [60].  

Thus, Som Energia does not want to be just a provider or producer of green energy. The 

ambition of this cooperative is above all, to build a wide social movement supporting RES and 

the public participation. According to its mission, the human component is very important for 

the success of this project and at the moment, the huge level of commitment of its members has 

been helping to build a community’s awareness for real alternatives. 

    

Resuming the four years of activities, the first year was, mainly, focused on the launch of the 

Cooperative. When this period was overcome, it was second year’s intention to start selling 

green electricity to all partners and producing its own energy. Since last year (2013), the 

expectations are: 

 

? To consolidate the Cooperative’s grow in terms of the evolution within the Spanish 
electricity market; 

? To consolidate the Som Energia electricity price; 
? To reduce the production costs for continuous technological improvements; 
? Development of policies to reduce emissions taxes. 

 

Regarding to its members, since its foundation the number of members of the Cooperative has 

grown from year to year. The journey of Som Energia started with 350 members and one year 

later, end of 2011, the number surpassed the mark of 1000 members. The growth of Som 

Energia has been remarkable, and at the moment, past two years, the Cooperative has nearly 16 

000 members mainly due to the ability of its members to be supplied by 100% renewable 

electricity, at a similar price to last resort electricity supplier, regardless of their place of 

residence. 

 

Unlike The Co-operative Energy, until very recently in Som Energia it was mandatory a 

customer be also a member of the Cooperative. Nevertheless, a person who wants to become a 

member shall pay a one-off returnable deposit of € 100 in the Cooperative's social capital.  

In some countries, the Cooperative´s activities are subsidised by the government, lottery funds 

or other private foundations. However, in Spain, this kind of incentive is not available, and does 

not seems to be in the near future, especially because of the current climate of crisis and 

austerity budgets that the country is facing [61]. That’s why is so important for Som Energia, 

that each customer be a member as well, and understands the concept behind the Cooperative. 

Another difference, comparing to The Co-operative Energy, is that Som Energia does not follow 

the traditional advertising. It is all based on social networks (Twitter or Facebook), instead of 

the British Cooperative, that besides these plataforms, already used for the first time the radio as 

a way to spread its campaigns. Nevertheless, the mouth to mouth dissemination is used by all 

Cooperatives.

Once a member, the citizen can invest in new RES projects (investors can get a return of 

between 3-5% annually and can take out their investment whenever they wish). These projects 

are mainly small-scale projects (owned by all members) to produce energy in the biogas, PV, 

wind and biomass sectors. With these projects, it is Som Energia objective to be able to cover 

fully the energy demands of its members.  

Moreover, in Som Energia, all members can take part in the cooperative working groups 

(commercialisation, diffusion, projects, education, among others) and also be active in the 

several volunteer regional centres distributed all around the country [62].  

Another way to call for its member participation, are through the conferences, debates and 

regular meetings around the country that the Cooperative organises, to engage and raise 

awareness about sustainable energy.  

 

As all other Cooperatives, here the cooperative system is also meant to let all members 

participate and it functions under the principle of one person, one vote.

Figure 63. Germany and its States 

 

Germany is a federal parliamentary republic consisting of 16 constituent states (Bundesländer), 

identified in the Figure 63, which retain limited sovereignty. Because of differences in size and 

population the states are divided as city states (Stadtstaaten), for instance Hamburg, Bremen 

and the capital Berlin, or states with larger territories (Flächenländer).

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

92 

 

From the 16 states, 5 are responsible for regional administrative purposes on federal state level, 

namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony. Currently, 

they are divided in a total of 22 Government Districts (Regierungsbezirke): 

 

? Baden-Württemberg: Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart and Tübingen; 
? Bavaria: Oberbayern, Niederbayern, Oberpfalz, Oberfranken, Mittelfranken, 

Unterfranken and Schwaben; 

? Hesse: Darmstadt,  Gießen and Kassel; 
? North Rhine-Westphalia: Arnsberg, Cologne, Detmold, Düsseldorf and Münster; 
? Saxony: Chemnitz, Dresden and Leipzig. 

 

Within the federal state authority, Regierungsbezirke act as a mid-level agency mostly 

concerned with administrative decisions on a regional level for the 403 affiliated districts 

(Kreise), which are divided between rural districts (Landkreise) and urban districts 

(StadtKreise). Basically, the district can be seen as an intermediate level of administration 

between the Bundesländer and the municipal governments (Gemeinden), which are the lowest 

level of official territorial division in Germany.  

 

At this point, and without further details, it is possible to see that Germany has a quite 

complicated organisational system. However, despite the constitutional system complexity, the 

country has always adopted the internal European electricity market directives on time.  

 

Thus, the beginning of the German liberalisation process was given in end of the last century, 

with the ratification of The National Energy Act of 1998. Basically, this document transposed 

the First Directive at the federal level. When the Second Directive came up, in 2003, all the EU 

members were obligated to adopt the guidelines published in the document. Germany was no 

different, and in 2005 it was enacted a new National Energy Act, that was later amended in 2011 

with the release of the Third Directive two years before [63].  

 

Before the liberalisation, the electricity sector in Germany was organised by a coexistence of 

public,  

private and mixed-economy enterprises, which means there was never a broad government 

monopoly in the sector as practised, for instance, in the UK with the former CEGB. Here, 

instead, the regulation framework as a natural monopoly hence competition was not tolerated 

[63]. But how is that? 

 

To understand how the German electricity sector used to work on that period, it is necessary to 

go back to the time of the First World War. When the war ended it was adopted a system of 

territorial monopolies. Distribution areas were established by demarcation contracts between 

energy supply companies. In this way, the energy supply companies can only operate inside 

their own contractual territories. Later, the system was strengthened when energy supply 

companies started cooperation with municipal utilities [63].  

Municipal utilities in ownership of the municipals received electricity, from that one produced 

by the energy supply company in which they were involved and in doing so, assured the 

marketing of the electricity producing energy supply company. In the meantime the 

municipalities participated via the profits of the larger energy supply companies. Generally

speaking this system, ensured security of supply and profits for energy supply companies and 

municipal utilities [63]. 

 

One year before the liberalisation was set in march, energy supply companies were active at 

municipal, regional or supra-regional level, and classified as “Network Energy Supply Company 

(NESC)”, “Regional Energy Supply Company (RESC)” or “Municipal Utility (MU)” [63]: 

 

? The supra-regional level: In 1997 there were 8 NESCs, which produced almost 80% 
of the country electricity. Moreover, they had been active only in the framework of their 

territorial monopoly. However, whilst some companies (PreussenElektra AG, 

Bayerwerk AG, VEAG) were only active in production and transmission, others NESCs, 

such as RWE, VEW, EnBW, BEWAG and HEW had been active in all the four electricity 

sectors. 

? The regional level: At this level, there were around 80 RESCs with a production share 
of 10%, total took over the electricity from the large NESCs. The RESCs distributed 

electricity whether to end-users or to MUs. 

? The municipal level: There were around 900 MUs supplied end-users in their 
municipalities with electricity, gas, water or district heat. They produced an electricity 

share similar to RESCs.  

 

All energy supply companies were linked via long-term contracts, typically for 20 years. 

Additionally, as a result of capital investments large NESCs financed their subsidiary RESCs. In 

contrast to the RESCs, MUs remained autonomous and were minority capital owners of the 

large NESCs [63].  

 

Thereby, before the liberalisation, and in the framework of the territorial monopoly concept, all 

the four activities were clearly in the hands of the large NESCs (Figure 64). The MUs 

participated in the profits of the NESCs by capital shares. Indeed, the supply to the customers 

was organised mainly by MUs, but the electricity sold to them came from NESCs, delivered 

from the RESCs, and MUs in approximately equal quantities [63].

Figure 64. Main features of the pre German liberalisation 

 

The post liberalisation of the German electricity sector started with the adoption of The National 

Energy Act of 1998
9
 (“Energiewirtschaftsgesetz von 1998”). According to the document, legal 

competition became possible, which means territorial monopolies were abolished. It was only 

enacted the separation of accounts between the transmission activities and production and 

supply. Moreover, it was guaranteed a negotiated TPA to the electricity transport system for 

electricity producers and industrial consumers (Germany was the only EU member to adopt this 

option, instead of regulated access), without any regulatory agency supervision. In fact, the 

regulation of the electricity networks was given over to the NESCs.  

However, the complete and seamless liberalisation process did not lead to competition, but to 

proceedings and market concentration due to mergers and acquisitions [63]. 

 

While the document expected to be approved and adopted, the large NESCs reacted with a 

massive wave of mergers, in order to keep market power, profits and electricity prices as they 

wanted. Thus, the merger process started in 1997 with the merger between Badenwerk and 

Energieversorgung Schwaben (EVS) to the new NESC, called Energie Baden-Würtemberg AG 

(EnBW) and continued later at national and European level.  

Fundamentally, this very early merger process and in particular the seamless liberalisation in 

Germany, due to The National Energy Act of 1998, are indications of the influence of large 

German NESCs within German legislation in accordance with their own expansive market 

strategies [63]. 

 

In 2005, the negotiated TPA was transformed to a regulatory TPA with the release of the new 

National Energy Act. It was also stated in the document, that regulatory entities shall be created 

                                                      
9 According to Energiewirtschaftsgesetz von 1998, the purpose of the Act was to ensure the safe, 

affordable and environmentally acceptable wireline supply of electricity and gas in the public interest. 

Basically, the document approached topics, such as abolition of antitrust exemptions for the energy 

sector, control of prices and conditions, grid access and power transmission and the promotion of RES, in 

order to deal with a new general structure of the German electricity market [64].

and responsible for the legal unbundling of non-competitive areas (transmission and 

distribution) from competitive areas (production and supply) [63]. 

 

With the publishing of the Third Directive in 2009, EU members were invited to adopt more 

common rules. Thus, until March 2011 Germany had to applicate effective unbundling of 

energy production and supply interests from the network, through three basic models, increase 

the transparency of retail markets and introduce more effective regulatory oversight, among 

others. The main features of the post German liberalisation are represented in Figure 65. 

  

In the generation activity, in 2005 there was a reduction of the number of NESCs from 8 to 4 

(REW, E.ON, EnBW and Vanttenfall). Despite, on that period, their electricity market share 

increased, the scenario have been changing with the decommissioning of several nuclear power 

plants, owned by these companies, and the significant expansion of capacity from RES [65].  

The electricity generation market is no longer controlled by the big 4 companies. Nowadays, 

apart from a few other large-generating companies, the electricity generating market consists of 

a large number of independent companies, most importantly public utility companies, that have 

been taking advantage of the RES’ government support schemes to slowly enter in the market 

[66]. All players need an authorisation to build new electricity generation power plants. 

 

Since 2005, the 4 big generating companies are responsible for the transmission networks and 

all are generally obligated to connect power plants on an economically reasonable, non-

discriminatory and transparent basis. When the Third Directive was transposed at a federal 

level, they had to choose among three main unbundling models: FOU, ITO and ISO [67].  

They opted for different models of unbundling. For instance, E.ON and Vanttenfall opted for a 

FOU model. As a consequence, these companies would have to sell their electricity networks, 

leading then to two new TSOs: TenneT (ex-E.ON) and 50Hertz Transmission ( formerly 

Vanttenfal). On the opposite, Amprion (RWE) and TransnetBW (EnBW) opted for a ITO model. 

That means, that under this model the management of the transmission network is done by 

a subsidiary of the parent company.  

Finally, an operating permit by the state regulatory authority and certification by BNetzA are 

required to operate a transmission network.    

 

Characterising the distribution sector, since 2005 the electricity distribution activity are fully 

regulated. While the big 4 companies have managed to acquire shares in many DSOs, whether 

RESCs or MUs, through privatisation efforts in the past, the German distribution market has 

seen a reverse trend in recent years [66].  

In order to provide competition and to ensure the success of the German liberalisation process, 

the BKartA prevented new acquisitions by the 4 NESCs. Nevertheless, the most significant 

“measure” that have been shifting the sector is the will of the local people, which through social 

movements such as Cooperatives are attempting to regain sole control over the DSOs. The most 

famous case is EWS, a small Cooperative that besides producing energy based on RES, also 

distributes the energy produced through the networks it owns. 

Thus, currently the German DSOs are mainly small local entities, largely owned by 

municipalities [68]. The requirements to operate distribution systems in Germany are equivalent 

to those for transmission systems with the exception that DSOs do not need to be certified by 

the BNetzA.

With the introduction of The National Energy Act of 1998, the supply activity was straight away 

opened up to competition. Thus, from then on the German customer was able to switch from 

electricity supplier, despite electricity end-user prices for households were regulated until 1 July 

2007.  

At the moment, any company which aims to be also an electricity supplier, must comply with 

the guidelines on business processes for the supply of electricity to customers 

(Geschäftsprozesse zur Kundenbelieferung mit Elektrizität (GPKE)) published in 2006. 

Since the beginning of the liberalisation efforts in 1998, at least one-third of customers had 

changed electricity supplier. In 2014 this ratio is expected to rise to some 40% or 50%. 

Renewable energy suppliers are particularly benefiting from this trend [66]. 

 

Concerning the regulation, the amendment of 2005 separated the regulation of the transport 

segment and the competition segments (retail and supply of electricity). 

Thus, in order to ensure the correct functioning of the German electricity system, there were 

created several regulatory agencies [63][66]: 

 

? The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA)). This regulatory 
authority is the system responsible for the transport segment, inclunding TSOs, and to 

create the conditions for fair and effective competition on the upstream and downstream 

markets for the supply of electricity. Moreover, until 2007 Bundesnetzagentur was also 

responsible to regulate the authorisations concerning net entering and the cost based of 

net prices, plus unbundlings.  

? State Regulatory Authorities (Landesregulierungsbehörden). This new entities were 
responsible in the same way as the BNetzA concerning electricity transport companies 

with less than 100 000 customers and if their network is within the borders of the 

respective federal state.  

 

Fundamentally, these are the two institutions responsible for the regulation of the electricity 

grids. 

 

Furthermore, there were created some other entities such as the Federal Cartel Office 

(Bundeskartellamt (BKartA)) responsible for merger control and protection of competition. 

Moreover, it is responsible for the operation of another regulatory authority, Market 

Transparency Authority for Electricity and Gas (Markttransparenzstelle Strom und Gas 

(MTS)), in cooperation with the BNetzA. Then, there are the Federal Environment Agency 

(Umweltbundesamt (UBA)), competent for environmental issues and it includes the German 

Emission Trading Authority (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle (DEHSt)), which governs the 

trading of emission certificates under the Kyoto Protocol [66]. 

 

Finally, and to help the liberalisation process, it was established two electricity exchanges 

markets in 2000: Leipzig Power Exchange - LPX and European Power Exchange - EPX. In 

2002, LPX and EPX merged and founded a new organised energy market called European 

Energy Exchange (EEX) covering the spot market, the futures market and the clearing of OTC 

dealings (bilateral contracts).With EEX it was introduced more prices transparency, as well as 

market competition.

Germany is one of the largest European electricity producers. Despite the historical powerful 

companies such as RWE, E.ON, EnBW and Vanttenfal, there are several other firms that are 

taking advantage of the RES to increase their generation market share, such as Enercon, 

Enertrag, GDF Suez, swb AG, Breeze Two Energy, EEW Energy from Waste, MVV Energie, 

Energiekontor, Prokon, ENERTRAG, Société Electrique de l'Our, Envia Therm, EWE AG, 

RheinEnergie, STEAG and Mainova, among others. Besides these large generating companies, 

there are the public utility companies (Stadtwerke Bochum Holding GmbH, Stadtwerke 

Brandenburg an der Havel GmbH, Stadtwerke Düsseldorf AG, Stadtwerke München GmbH, 

Stadtwerke Hannover AG, Stadtwerke Leipzig GmbH or Stadtwerke Flensburg GmbH). All 

these companies, and many others, have power plants with over 10 MW of installed capacity 

[69]. 

 

 

Figure 67. TSOs operating in Germany [70] 

 

At the moment, there are 4 TSOs operating in the country (Figure 67): 50Hertz Transmission, 

Amprion, TenneT and TransnetBW, each of them responsible for one of the four German control 

areas. Fundamentally, their task is to keep control power available to maintain stable and 

reliable supply.  

 

In the distribution activity, currently there are almost 900 electricity distribution companies 

active in the market. The majority are small regional DSOs, called Stadwerke, with fewer than 

100 000 customers [69]. Three quarters of all DSOs in Germany supply fewer than 30 000 

households, which means that they all have a small market share.  

There is in Germany an innovative partnerships between communities, public and private 

organisations, which have enabled localities to take ownership of or participate in the 

governance of their local energy systems and utilities - a phenomenon that has grown 

significantly in recent years.  Thus, driven by the success history of EWS in the past, by the end 

of 2012, 190 German communities had been successful in bidding to run their local electricity 

distribution grid, with at least nine of these being fully owned by EWS.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Finally, in relation to supply, at the moment there are more than 1100 electricity suppliers 

operating in Germany, mostly Stadtwerke due to their public service obligation of electricity 

supply. These utilities have long or medium term delivery contracts with the major electricity 

producers.  

By other words, it is possible to say the Stadtwerke are traditionally responsible for operating 

the local grid networks and distributing energy to local consumers, and therefore have a greater 

and more central role in the governance of their local energy market. Nevertheless, it is to be 

noted that the share of public utilies in overall supply in the electricity sector has continuously 

decreased since 1998 due to the incoming of new suppliers and contract switching. 

 

These new electricity suppliers can be divided in two types: those, whose energy comes fully 

from RES, and those who use conventional energy sources.   

Slowly, the supply companies are spreading their business across the country. Whilst, in 2008, 

the majority of suppliers operated only within one network area, or in maximally four additional 

network areas, nowadays new electricity suppliers operate, on average, within 200 network 

areas, leading then to a number of approximately 72 suppliers for household customers within 

each network. On the opposite, established public utilities are active, on average, within 31 

network areas [65].    

 

While in 2008 the share of the four largest electricity suppliers (E.ON, RWE, EnBW and 

Vattenfall) in the overall household customer segment was still at 50.1%, in 2010, the year 

under review, this share was at 43.8%, and the tendency in the near future is the rate to keep 

falling. It is clear to say, the Stadtwerke and other independent suppliers represent more than 

50% of the domestic market. The reasons are transversal to other European energy markets. 

Among the main causes, it is possible to highlight the environmental concerns, the will of 

change for a new “green” world, the lack of trust in the big energy companies and the prices 

billed. 

However, the people’s desire for a decentralised power is the main reason. Since the early 

nineties, there have been in Germany, a clear movement towards a much more constructive, 

locally-governed infrastructure in which communities may secure their participation and ensure 

transparency, efficiency and the betterment of their neighbourhoods, which soon led to the 

creation of new community companies, as Cooperatives.  

Nowadays, the influence of these social companies is rising over the years, once they serve and 

support the local community and economy. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the retail 

market in the German electricity sector is characterised by a strongly regional structure.  

 

4.4.3. EWS 

 

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

The number of RES Cooperatives in Germany has been growing significantly in recent years, 

registering 100 new cases each year. For instance, at the end of 2013, there were 888 registered 

RES Cooperatives in the country. 

Among the almost 900 social enterprises, it is possible to find one of the pioneers of RES 

movement: ElektrizitätsWerke Schönau (EWS). Its roots are traced in the eighties, right after the 

Chernobyl disaster in 1986, when in the small town of Schönau, a small group’ initiative 

emerged to protest against nuclear energy and promoting alternative ways of energy supply. 

Thus, after many years of protests and debates with the local grid operators and the town 

council, the EWS in 1997 succeeded in buying the grid from the former electricity supplier for 

4.7 million Deutsche Mark [61]. The financing of such high amount of money was only possible 

by a spectacular country wide appeal for funds, which did not only made the purchase possible 

but also showed that when the citizens join together it is possible to achieve good things.  

 

The process was intense and slow, but after many years of struggle EWS could then legally run 

the electricity network of Schönau, and reorganise it in an ecological manner.  

Initially, EWS started to supply Schönau’s community’s, through local RES sources, however 

when the energy market was liberalised, the Cooperative spread its services to households 

across Germany [71].  

 

Regarding its creation, EWS was formed in 1994, as a natural evolution of Netzkauf GbR, a 

citizen group established in 1991, whose plan was to buy the electricity grid themselves. 

Nowadays, EWS is one of the largest eco-electricity providers in Europe, and the largest run by 

citizens. Its aim is simple: to decentralise and democratise the energy supply, putting it at the 

nucleus of a continuously expanding national network of independent power generators utilising 

a range of RES technologies (PV, hydropower, wind power, biomass and cogeneration). 

 

After this first success, EWS expanded and during the following years, grids in nine 

neighbouring villages were bought as well. It allowed EWS to increase the number of 

customers, reaching in the moment to around 150 000 households, commercial establishments 

and industrial firms with green electricity, comparing to the 1 700 customers in the beginning. 

Since the beginning, the EWS’s business model and work has repeatedly garnered prizes. It has 

been leading to a satisfaction not only among members and workers of EWS, but the customers 

are also happy to see that they are contributing to EWS’s vision of sustainable and fair power 

production [72].  

 

Regarding membership, EWS Cooperative gathers 3 400 members. To become a member, a 

person must purchase at least five shares, with the value of € 100 each, and the money will be 

used for the expansion of its grid networks and the establishment of independent RES power 

plants, through EWS Energie GmbH. A side note to say that, it is not mandatory a new 

customer become a member too.  

 

In this moment a pertinent question may arise: Why the number of members is smaller when 

compared to customers? Well, despite its longevity, EWS is only registered as a Cooperative 

since end of 2009 [72]: EWS Netzkauf eG.

As a Cooperative, EWS must face new problems regarding to energy market. In Germany there 

are more than 900 grid operators, also very small ones, like EWS Netze GmbH. For years EU 

has been telling Germany to minimize the number of grid operators, and what it possible to see 

today is a closing in on grid operators more and more by the German regulation agency, the 

BNetzA. 

As a consequence, many small grid operators are giving up, because from a financial 

perspective they are unable to fulfil these requirements [61].  

Will EWS survive to this change in the energy market? Only time may tell. 

 

4.5. Electricity Sector in Belgium 

4.5.1. An Overview of the Belgian Liberalised Market 

 

Figure 68. Belgium and its Regions 

 

Before any further development about the Belgian liberalisation, it is important to clarify that 

the Kingdom of Belgium is a federation of three Regions with three national languages, of 

which Dutch and French are predominant (Figure 68): 

 

? The Flanders, in the north of the country, is subdivided into five provinces and include 
many medieval art cities such as Antwerp, Bruges or Ghent; 

? The Wallonia, in the south, whose main cities are Liege, Namur and Charleroi, is also 
subdivided into five provinces; 

? And the Brussels-Capital Region, which does not contain any province. Basically, is 
only the capital.   

 

 Among the five countries that will be object of study in this work, the Belgian government was 

the one that took more time to liberalise the electricity sector, maybe because of such a complex 

political power, with competencies regarding energy policy, divided between the federal level 

and the three Regions.  

In fact, the start sign for the liberalisation process was given in 1999, one year after the deadline 

set by EC, with the transposition of First Directive at the federal level, but only two years later, 

in 2001, the law of 1999 was further completed and amended by all the Regions between 2000 

and 2004 [73].  

Regarding the remaining two European Directives, just like the first one, they were transposed 

to federal law out of time. For instance, while the Second Directive was transposed into Belgian 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

102 

 

law in middle of 2005 [74], the Third Directive has taken place at federal level by 2012, despite 

the deadline of March 2011 [75].   

With the timeline of the Belgian liberalisation done, it is time to give the big picture of pre 

liberalisation of the Belgian electricity system (Figure 69). 

 

Thus, before 1999 the Belgian generation sector was dominated by Electrabel and the SPE with 

market shares of 91% and 6.5%, respectively. The rest of the market share was divided over a 

number of small autonomous producers and industrial auto producers. 

Both companies also operated the transmission networks through a joint cooperation, called 

CPTE. Through this entity, created in 1995, Electrabel and SPE coordinated and managed their 

activities in both the segment of generation and transmission [73].   

 

Regarding to the distribution activity, the networks were, initally, propriety of the 

municipalities, which meant they had a legal monopoly for the distribution of electricity. 

However, most municipalities transferred the distribution of energy to inter-municipal 

companies, set up by groups of municipalities (, or intercommunales). There were two types of 

intercommunales:  

 

? Pure intercommunales, this means pure public ownership; 
? Mixed intercommunales, in which municipalities joined forces with a private company 

to organise distribution management and investment activities.  

 

The private company working in association with the municipalities was Electrabel, which 

participated for approximately 60%. By other words, the inter-municipal companies were tied 

by agreements to purchase electricity from Electrabel for a period of 15 years. This meant that 

Electrabel was not only the big player in generation and transmission activities, but also had a 

dominant position in the distribution sector [73]. 

 

Just like distribution, the supply activity was also in hands of municipal and pure 

intercommunales companies with shares of 1 % and 12 %, respectively. Concerning the mixed 

intercommunales companies the share was of 49 %. Nevertheless, Electrabel and SPE, through 

CPTE, were responsible for the electricity supply to clients directly connected to the 

transmission network (38 %) [73].

Figure 69. Main features of the pre Belgian liberalisation 

 

The post liberalisation era brought some changes in the four sectors (Figure 70). For instance, 

starting by generation, it was established that electricity generators need to have an authorisation 

before they can start their activities. Nowadays, the generation sector is full liberalised which 

means, besides the two historical major players, Electrabel (GdF-Suez) and SPE-Luminus, a  

few new companies entered in the generation activity, like REW, E.ON, EDF, Enoco, Eni and 

Essent, or some smaller companies such as Aspiravi, Ecopower, Electrabel Green Projects 

Flanders and Electrawinds [73][74]. 

Moreover, the authorisation must be federal for installations with a capacity of 25 MW or 

higher. Below this limit, no generation authorisation is required. Nevertheless, an environmental 

and building permission has to be applied in accordance with regional legislation [75].  

 

As a response to the opening up of the European electricity markets, an organised electricity 

market in Belgium was introduced in the end of 2006: Belgian electricity power exchange 

(Belpex), responsible for the spot market with daily transactions and intraday adjustments, plus 

the Green Certificates Exchange. The Belpex’s daily market is coupled with its neighbours, 

APX in the Netherlands, EPEX Spot in France and Germany, and Nord Pool Spot in the Nordic 

region, while the intraday market is linked only with APX and Nord Pool Spot.  

Belpex, via APX, counts on a strong shareholder structure being composed, among others, by 

two electricity TSOs: ELIA in Belgium and TenneT in the Netherlands.   

Regarding derivatives market, the Belgian power exchanges are provided by ICE-European 

Energy Derivates Exchange (ICE-ENDEX). ICE ENDEX was established in March 2013, 

shortly after the split of energy exchange APX-ENDEX into APX and ENDEX.

According to the Directives, the transmission and distribution networks became a legal 

monopoly. It was also demanded a legal separation and independency between the generation 

and supply activities, and a consequence was the establishment by CPTE of Elia System 

Operator (ELIA) for its network activities, in 2001. Right after, in 2002 ELIA has been chosen 

by the Belgian government as the TSO for the next 20 years.   

However, ELIA has also the license as DSO in the Flanders for networks with voltage between 

26 kV and 70 kV, and is a local TSO in regions of Walonia and Brussels. Right now, in terms of 

ownership, the company is fully unbundled since Electrabel sold its 24% share, partially to a 

cooperative company representing the Belgian municipalities (Publi-T), and partially to the 

market [73].  

 

Regarding distribution networks under 30 kV, the grid is mostly operated by inter-municipal 

companies (mixed intercommunales). Moreover, in line with the European legislation, the 

municipal and inter-municipal companies had to stop their supply. 

 

Concerning the supply activity, four different supply licenses are available in Belgium since 

there are four different authorities governing relationships between supplier and consumer, 

being the competent authority determined by the location and voltage at which the customer is 

connected to the electricity grid [74]: 

 

? License submitted to the federal regulator, for trading electricity and supplying it to 
end-users connected to the transmission grid.  

? License submitted to the regional regulator, depending on the location, for supply 
electricity to end users connected to distribution networks. 

 

Continuing in the supply sector, all companies connected to the federal transmission network 

are free to choose their supplier since a period between 2000 and 2002. Regarding to domestic 

sector, users who are connected to the distribution networks, the Belgian energy market was 

gradually opened [73][76]: 

 

? Flanders: as from 1st January 2003; 
? Wallonia and Brussels: as from 1st January 2007. 

  

Due the liberalisation some changes did occurred in this sector, with the entry of dozens of new 

electricity suppliers and the ending of the municipalities’ role in the supply activity. Thus, the 

eligible customers who were previously operated by the mixed intercommunales and who did 

not select a new supplier were from then on supplied by Electrabel, while the pure 

intercommunales transferred their retail activities to a new company called Luminus [73]. 

 

Regarding national regulatory authorities, the federal regulator is the Commission for the 

Regulation of Electricity and Gas (CREG). It was created in 2000, and its function is to advice 

the Belgian authorities on the structure and operation of the liberalised electricity and gas 

markets, monitors the application and efficiency of relevant laws and regulations, including the 

approval of the tariff proposals submitted by the TSO and DSOs. Nevertheless, with the 

introduction of the federal laws of 2005, CREG’s mission became somewhat reduced in favour

of the Belgian Federal Energy Administration Ministry. Moreover, there are three regional 

energy regulators [74]: 

 

? The Flemish Regulator of the Electricity and Gas market (VREG), responsible for 
regulate the region of Flanders;  

? The Walloon Commission for Energy (CWaPE), responsible for regulate the region of 
Wallonia; 

? The Brussels Regulator for Energy (BRUGEL), responsible for regulate the Brussels-
Capital Region.  

 

In addition to supervising the operation of the electricity market, these institutions also play a 

central role in issuing supply licenses, authorising new power plants, including renewable 

energy, and issuing and managing green power certificates.  

 

The regulators’ competencies in the electricity sector are allocated according to the tension of 

the relevant grids. Thus, for networks with a tension above 70 kV, the CREG regulates the 

entire Belgian territory, while for grids with tension below 70 kV, the regional regulators are 

competent for Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels-Capital, respectively.

4.5.2. Electricity Suppliers Operating in the Belgian Open Market 

Therefore, at the moment the Belgian electricity system can be represented by four big sectors, 

plus the regulators (Figure 71). 

 

Electricity generators are the first players in the chain, and at the moment there are several 

players operating in Belgium, including Electrabel, SPE-Luminus, REW, E.ON, EDF, Enoco, 

Eni and Essent, or some smaller companies such as Aspiravi, Ecopower, Electrabel Green 

Projects Flanders and Electrawinds. 

 

While Belgium has a single TSO, Elia Transmission, in the distribution sector, the case is quite 

different with several DSOs. As there are three Regions, each one has its DSOs. Thus, in 

Belgium, DSOs are ORES, Tecteo (Resa), Régie de Wavre, AIESH, AIEG, IEH, INTEREST, 

INTERMOSANE and PBE in Wallonia, Sibelga in the Brussels-Capital Region and finally, 

Eandis, ELIA and Infrax in Flanders [77].

The customers can be anyone from individuals to major industrial players. Industrial users are 

often directly connected to the high-voltage grid, whereas individual users or SMEs, for 

example, are connected to the distribution system.  

 

 

Figure 71. Belgian Electricity System 

 

With regards to the supply activity, nowadays, the Belgian customers may choose from a range 

of companies. Considering the three Regions, there are more than 20 electricity suppliers in the 

country.  

 

According to VREG [78], there are in the Flanders territory 35 electricity suppliers. Focusing on 

those who have got a market share, they are 29: Electrabel Customer Solutions, EDF Luminus, 

Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power, Essent Belgium, Lampiris, Eneco Belgie, Netbeheerder, Octa+ Energie, 

Ecopower, Elegant, Elektriciteitsbedrijf Merksplas, Belpower International, Watz, Elexys, 

E.ON Belgium, Wase Wind, Elindus, WE Power, Scholt Energy Control, Trevion, Belgian Eco 

Energy, Electrabel, Energie 2030, Powerhouse, Enovos Luxembourg, Axpo Benelux, Delta 

Energy Belgium, Energie der Nederlanden, E.ON Global Comodities.  

In June 2014, the market shares based on the total number of end-users was leaded by Electrabel 

with 44.40%, followed by EDF Luminus and Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power with shares of 20.18% and 

11.84%, respectively (Figure 72). 

Then, there is a group of companies, including Essent (7.63%), Lampiris (5.03%) and Eneco 

(4.34%), with a respectable share in the Flanders market, followed by a third group composed 

by Netbeheerder (2.50%), Octa+ Energie (1.53%), Ecopower (1.23%), Elegant (0.41%), 

Elektriciteitsbedrijf Merksplas (0.30%), Belpower International (0.23%) and Watz (0.14 %). 

All other players had shares below 0.10%.

Figure 72. Flanders Region’s market share, by electricity supplier (in June 2014) 

 

In relation to Brussels-Capital Region, according to BRUGEL the total number of electricity 

suppliers is 16 [79]: Belgian Eco Energy, Belpower International, E.ON Belgium, Electrabel, 

Electrabel Customer Solutions, Elexys, Eneco Belgie, Energie 2030, Lampiris, EDF Luminus, 

Octa+ Energie, Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power, Essent Belgium and Sibelga.  

Here the case is no difference, which means that by the end of 2013, based on the total number 

of end-user, Electrabel Customer Solutions was the number one company with a market share of 

75.10%. Concerning the others players, Lampiris had a market share of 15.11%, while EDF 

Luminus, Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power and Octa+ Energie ended the year with shares of 5.26%, 1.76% and 

1.66%, respectively (Figure 73).  

A side note, to Sibelga (0.54%), Belpower International (0.23%) and Essent Belgium (0.22%), 

all companies that ended 2013 with interesting market shares. The others represent a share of

Finally, according to CWaPE [80], in the end of 2013 there were 10 electricity suppliers 

operating in the Wallonia Region: Belpower international, Electrabel Customer Solutions, EDF 

Luminus, Elexis, Eneco Belgie, Energie 2030, Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power, Essent Belgium, Lampiris and 

Octa+ Energie.    

Looking closely to the market shares (Figure 74), once again Electrabel Customer Solutions 

stood as the electricity supplier with the largest share (51.80%). With half of Electrabel’s share 

(24.90%) was EDF Luminus, while the third place belonged to Lampiris with 11.2%. Right 

after, came Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power and Essent Belgium, each one with a share of 5.4%.

Considering the number of electricity suppliers, the market in Flanders is more developed than 

the others. Indeed, the region was the first to open up its market in the segment of the supply 

back in 2003. However, this does not explain everything. For instance, Flanders have been 

leading not only in innovative measures, as the Flemish Green Power Support Scheme and the 

Flemish Energy Company or even the installation of smart meters, but also in adapting the 

European Directives to the Regional legislation, as the full ownership unbundling on 

distribution level that must be achieved until 2018 [75]. 

   

Despite the insufficient data, concerning the Wallonia and Brussels-Capital markets, which lead 

to a problem for a correct access and analyse of the Belgian electricity market, it is possible to 

come up with a conclusion: there are three big players in the coutry, wherein two of them 

(Electrabel and EDF-Luminus, previously SPE) were operating in the market even before of the 

liberalisation. The third one is Eni Gas &amp;amp; Power. 

Nevertheless, paying attention to the most vibrant market (Flanders), there are some “green” 

companies, inclunding Lampiris or Ecopower, which will be studied in the next section, whose 

market shares are having a sustainable growth over the time, due to a mix of reasons, such as 

their visions of an electricity system based on RES, regional support schemes for smaller RES 

companies or the public awareness and debates for a new energy paradigm.  

 

4.5.3. Ecopower 

 

 

Unlike Lampiris, Ecopower is a social company owned by its members. Founded 23 years ago 

in Belgium, Ecopower is one of the most known RES Cooperatives operating in Europe. As one 

of the first of the new wave of energy Cooperatives, Ecopower is an example for most of the 

Cooperatives all over Europe, due not only for the introduction of several innovative practices 

and an exemplar management of its resources, that have led to a sustainable growth of the 

Cooperative, but for being one of the founders of REScoop, an European Federation of groups 

and Cooperatives of citizens that was legally established under Belgian national law with an 

European scope [61]. The aim of REScoop is to set the bases for a stronger European renewable 

energy cooperative alliance. Thus, this European Federation aims to support and develop RES 

Cooperatives promoting education, information and experience exchange, supporting research 

and the creation of new Cooperatives and helping to overcome financial and banking barriers. 

By other words, REScoop represents its members at the national, regional and, particularly, at 

the European level to create a level playing field for energy Cooperatives [61].  

Among its members, besides Ecopower, are for instance two of the case studies: EWS and Som 

Energia. 

 

Presentations made, it is time to look more closely at Ecopower’s history. It all began in 1991 

when a group of 30 people, from ecological and social movements, came up with the idea of 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

citizen energy production and sometime after, the project was officially recognised as 

Cooperative by the Belgian government. 

 

The years passed and at the turn of the century, something happened. In 1999, the city council 

of Eeklo, a small city near Ghent, decided to start a project for sustainable development. It soon 

became clear that a focus on energy was desirable and the decision was made to build 

windmills. The city’s environmental officer drew up a plan subject to several criteria: the 

windmills should be built at least 250 metres from residential areas and they should not have a 

negative impact on the ecological context of important nature conservation areas. At the end, 

three sites were selected on which windmills could be installed according to the environmental 

and social criteria. As the city owned land on two of the sites, those places were put up for rent. 

Thus, seven companies competed for the right to build and operate the windmills and at the end, 

Ecopower came out as the winner [81]. But how was that possible, to beat private and 

consolidated companies? 

 

In fact, it was a result of an explicit information strategy and campaign – a shared initiative of 

Ecopower and the city – the people of Eeklo were well informed and very supportive of the 

project. Moreover, they were convinced of the windmills’ potential and many have purchased 

shares in Ecopower, shares in what are now ‘their’ windmills.  

This event had such a big impact in Belgium, that the number of members increased, from 47 

members that the Cooperative had in 1999, to around 700 in 2002 and almost 3 000 in the end 

of 2003 [61].  

 

Since then, Ecopower have been invested in more RES projects, including wind power, PV, 

hydropower or biomasss across the country.  

For instance, during this year (2014), Ecopower aims to invest in a factory for wood pellets to 

be used for residential heating. Also, a wind power project with 4 large wind turbines is being 

built in Asse and preparations are made for a few more projects in Beersel (2 wind turbines), 

Bilzen (1 wind turbine), Ghent (1 wind turbine) and Sint-Truiden (3 wind turbines), respectively 

[81]. 

 

However the boom of members happened in 2003, year in which the liberalisation of the 

Belgian energy market occurred. Thus, taking advantage of this event, Ecopower started a new 

activity in its organisational structure: become a green electricity supplier [61]. 

Thanks to this new activity, at the end of 2013 Ecopower reached the 40 000 customers. The 

keys for success are simple: fairest and greenest electricity, and best customer service on the 

market. Moreover Ecopower, unlike the other energy suppliers, besides providing electricity 

also intends to reduce the electricity bill of their customers, through energy efficiency policies.    

 

Besides investing in its own projects, Ecopower also gives every kind of support in projects 

developed by third parties: local groups of citizens, local co-ops, city councils or private 

companies. Actively supporting other RES Cooperatives is an important element of Ecopower's 

philosophy. At the same time Ecopower wants to make people aware about RES energy and 

rational energy use in particular.

Regarding members, at the moment the Cooperative has more than 50 000 members. In the 

Ecopower’s scheme, interested citizens and organisations can buy one or more shares at a price 

of € 250 each. This gives them the right to one vote in the Cooperative’s General Assembly, 

irrespective of the amount of shares that they have. 

Having been granted recognition as a Cooperative, Ecopower is obliged to limit yields on 

shareholders’ investments to a maximum of 6%. This is not necessarily an obstacle, however, as 

it creates some interesting possibilities given that the Cooperative can also pursue less profitable 

projects. The financial surplus will be used for this purpose. In any case, 6% is quite a good rate 

– considering current interests on saving accounts [81].

116 

 

 

Besides the four case studies (The Co-operative Energy, Som Energia, EWS and Ecopower), 

completed the form eight more RES Cooperatives: Enercoop from France, GoiEner S. Coop., 

Nosa Enerxía S. Coop., Zencer S. Coop. and EnerPlus all from Spain, Greenpeace Energy eG 

from Germany and NLD Energie and DE Unie from Netherlands.  

 

Looking to all the answers in question 2, there are two main causes behind the entry of the RES 

Cooperatives in the electricity retail market: market opportunity and the non-existence of an 

environmentally friendly option.  

All the RES Cooperatives share both causes, Ecopower, Som Energia and Greenpeace Energy 

being perhaps the best examples; however there are some that are more inclined to each option, 

than others.  

In relation to the first reason, whilst for instance Enercoop took advantage of the liberalisation 

of the French energy market to bring forth the idea of a decentralised model of power 

production and supply, where consumer is closer to the production, the case of the Co-operative 

Energy is different, despite being also related with market opportunity. As part of the 

Midcounties Co-operative, a social enterprise that was already operating in several markets such 

as the food, funeralcare, pharmacy or post office for instance, the Co-operative Energy was the 

missing piece in the Micounties Co-operative puzzle. Thus, the Co-operative Energy was 

created in 2010 as a result of a market opportunity in the British energy business, based on the 

lack of trust among consumers in the Big 6 energy suppliers.  

Leading the second reason, there is EWS, which became an electricity supplier before the 

liberalisation of the energy markets. The decision of EWS to start supplying electricity was a 

natural consequence of a protest against nuclear power.  As the renounce of the use of nuclear 

energy itself was not enough to build up a new energetic paradigm, the people of Schönau 

decided to demonstrate that a green electricity supply in the village was possible, including a 

new tariff structure, and the only option available at the time was the buy of the electricity grid.    

Relative to NLD Energie and DE Unie, there were a couple of reasons put forward, but the most 

important was the possibility to introduce a truly local company that promoted local 

sustainability. 

  

Concerning RES Cooperatives, whose entry in the electricity retail market is a declared mix of 

both reasons, starting by Greenpeace Energy the liberalisation of the German energy market in 

1998 opened up the possibility to supply customers with green electricity. As at the time there 

was any supplier capable to provide high quality green electricity, Greenpeace e.V. took matters 

and created in autumn 1999 the Greenpeace Energy, a RES Cooperative legally and financially 

independent of the environmental protection organisation. In the next year, Greenpeace Energy 

started supplying customers with clean electricity according to the Greenpeace early idea. 

The Ecopower history is similar to Greenpeace Energy, although the decision to start supplying 

electricity was initiated by its members at the General Assembly in 2003 after the liberalisation 

of the electricity market for private households in Flanders.  

Relative to Som Energia, the Cooperative started in 2010, and shortly after, and in accordance 

with its mission (a new energetic paradigm), the Cooperative identified an opportunity in the 

Spanish electricity market: the promoting of an electricity model based on RES. Thus, it didn’t 

take too long to Som Energia to start supplying green electricity to its members, as well as the 

construction of RES power plants.  

The Som Energia's ideology is shared with four more Spanish Cooperatives: Zencer, Nosa 

Enerxía, EnerPlus and GoiEner. In their own way they all have the will to provide consumers

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

the democratic access to liberalised electricity, supported by 100% green electricity and the 

chance the customer taking control of its own power company, fighting thus the low level of 

trust in the energy companies and the corruption in the Spanish energy business. 

Moreover, in relation to GoiEner, just like several other RES Cooperatives, the Cooperative 

aimed to start its activity as an electricity producer based on RES, and just then spread its 

domains into the electricity retailing. However, due to cut of the feed-in tariffs introduced by the 

Spanish legislation in early 2012, the GoiEner was forced to turn its focus for the electricity 

retailing market.  

 

Although currently all these RES Cooperatives are supplying electricity in their own market, it 

does not mean it was an easy process for them. Besides Ecopower, DE Unie, NLD Energie Som 

Energia, which ranked their process as 5 and 4, respectively, the majority of the RES 

Cooperatives assessed their electricity retailing supply process as hard or very hard. 

 

 

Figure 76. Result of the question 4: “How long did the whole process take?” 

 

No doubt the national legislation, which differs among EU members, matters to the time it takes 

to fulfil the electricity retailing supply process. However, it is not the main factor. Based on the 

experience provided by the RES Cooperatives, the minimum period to start supplying electricity 

is 6 months and may exceed one year depending on the method chosen to operate on the 

organised energy market (Figure 76). 

A side note to the EWS case, which took several years to be concluded. As they started 

supplying electricity before the liberalisation of the German energy market, at that time it was 

required to run the distribution grid in order to supply electricity. The licenses to run the grid are 

still given by the municipalities. In most of the cases the concession is for periods above 15 

years and has to be announced at least 1 year in advance, so at this point it is possible to realise 

the complexity of the EWS’s electricity retailing supply process. Moreover, besides the license 

to run the grid a license to supply was also required.

Figure 77. Result of the question 5: “What was the main barriers the RES Cooperatives had to face during the 

entire process?” 

 

Independently of the time it takes to complete the electricity retailing supply process, there are 

several barriers that the RES Cooperatives had to face during the entire process (Figure 77). 

According to their feedback, it is possible to highlight the legislative complexity, including the 

difficulty to clarify any doubts, as well as the financial issues as the main obstacles to become 

an electricity supplier. 

Nevertheless, for Enercoop and Som Energia the biggest issue was the access to the organised 

energy market. Besides that, for Enercoop the problem number one was the market context.  

 

Based on the RES Cooperatives’ response, a national RES Cooperative shall overcome these 

barriers through several ways. Thus, the best advice that the Cooperative may have at this point 

is to be fully committed to the project, studying and analysing the current national regulations of 

the electricity sector. Moreover, the RES Cooperative shall seek for outside collaborations. 

Working together with different partners (other Cooperatives, social economy organisations, 

public institutions or energy experts) may help overcoming the lack of knowledge and 

experience in the business, as well as any financial issue.  

Finally, it is important to be patient and to have perseverance during the development of the 

electricity retailing supply process.  

 

 

Figure 78. Result of the question 7: “ How many licenses did the RES Cooperatives have to fulfil to operate in 

the national electricity retail market?”

As shown in Figure 78, the number of licenses varies from country, as well as the strategy 

chosen by the RES Cooperative to supply electricity in their national electricity retail market.  

Before the liberalisation of the energy market, the EWS just needed two permissions to start 

supplying electricity: one for running the grid and another one for the supply itself. Still in 

Germany, Greenpeace Energy has a comparable number, three licenses, even though the 

Cooperative started supplying after the liberalisation of the German electricity market.  

In relation to the Spanish RES Cooperatives, the number goes from two to more than five. The 

explanation is maybe related to the method chosen to purchase electricity in the MIBEL, as it 

will be seen right away. 

Looking to the Benelux’s RES Cooperatives, the NLD Energie and DE Unie needed two 

permissions given by the Dutch Authority for Consumers &amp;amp; Market, to operate as an energy 

supplier. For Ecopower, the number of licenses reaches five, and the reason may be related to 

the fact that Belgium is divided in three regions, each one with its own regional energy 

regulator. 

Finally, the Co-operative required to fulfil more than five licenses to start supplying electricity 

in the UK.  

 

 

Figure 79. Result of the question 8: “ When the RES Cooperative started the retailing supply activity, what 

was the method chosen to purchase electricity in the organised electricity market?” 

 

Analysing the 12 RES Cooperatives, from the several options to operate on the organised 

electricity market the chosen method was (Figure 79): To purchase electricity directly on the 

market (Enercoop, Greenpeace Energy, The Co-operative Energy and Zencer). 

Nevertheless, there are also RES Cooperatives, such as DE Unie, Ecopower, EnerPlus and Nosa 

Enerxía, which in the beginning of the supply activity opted for not participate in the energy 

market. Basically, their strategy is to operate as an intermediate company but the billing is made 

by the RES Cooperative. 

Moreover, there are also RES Cooperatives which access the market through a Representative 

Agent, via a BPO agreement (GoiEner, Som Energia and NLD Energie). 

Relative to EWS, the RES Cooperative buys electricity directly from RES producers. This 

method is also used as a complement by the Co-operative Energy.

Figure 80. Result of the question 9: “ What was the total ammount of financial warranties the RES 

Cooperative had to provide in the end of the process?  

 

As the financial issue is one of the biggest barriers a RES Cooperative faces during the process, 

it is worth a closer look (Figure 80). Based on the RES Cooperatives’ feedback, it is possible to 

get the permission for energy retailing and start supplying with less than € 50,000.  

Just focusing on the Spanish RES Cooperatives, as their national legislation is quite similar to 

the Portuguese and it also shares the same organised energy market, it is possible to come up 

with the certainty that a RES Cooperative, that aims to operate in Portugal, just needs € 50,000 

to start offering electricity to Portuguese customers.  

 

 

Figure 81. Result of the question 10: “ What was the consumers’ receptivity to the RES Cooperative entry in 

the eelctricity market?  

 

Notwithstanding it is a lengthy and complex process, the rewards do not take too long to occur. 

According to the RES Cooperatives experience, from the moment that the Cooperative enters in 

the electricity retail market, its offers are seen with good eyes by the consumer (Figure 81). 

Despite Zencer, which ranked the consumer’s receptivity to its offer as three, all the other RES 

Cooperatives rate as four and five the consumer’s acceptance to their entry in the electricity 

retail market.

Figure 82. Result of the question 11: “ What measures did the RES Cooperative take to settle down in such a 

competitive market?” 

 

As any other business, in order to succeed it is important for a new competitor to study and 

analyse the energy market before deciding to operate. However, when the RES Cooperative get 

the permission for electricity retailing, it will be equally important to come up with some 

measures that will allow its offer to be chosen by the consumers. Thus, according to the RES 

Cooperatives experience, the most relevant aspect that stands out is the green and clean 

electricity (Figure 82). Besides this competitive advantage, as the Cooperative does not have the 

same tools as the big energy companies (TV ads and newspapers ads), the local promotion 

through talking face-to-face and the participation in public events, as well as the collaboration 

with other public organisations, such as Cooperatives or social movements, are definitely other 

measures Coopérnico may takes to settle down in the energy market.  

For instance, the NLD Energie has partnerships with other local RES Cooperatives, which act as 

NLD Energie's resellers. 

Moreover, another big advantage introduced by the RES Cooperatives is related to the reduction 

of the electricity consumption of their customers, through energy saving measures. The RES 

Cooperatives have the real concern to reduce the electricity bill of the national consumers, on 

the opposite of the big energy companies.  

 

In relation to question 12, the number of RES Cooperatives for which it is mandatory to a 

customer become a member of the Cooperative is practically equal to those which is not 

required. 

Taking the example of two RES Cooperatives that complemented their answers: GoiEner and 

Som Energia. While in the first case the “YES” is related to a financial support that the RES 

Cooperative needs due to operation in the energy market (deviations), in relation to Som 

Energia it was mandatory a customer to be a member as well in the beginning of the electricity 

retailing. However, nowadays the answer is “NO”, once each member can bring into the 

Cooperative five electricity contracts of friends and/or family.

122 

 

 

Figure 83. Result of the question 13: “What makes the people join the RES Cooperative and participate in the 

green revolution?” 

 

Finally, as important as the measures defined by the Cooperative to strike the electricity market, 

is to understand what leads the consumer to become a member and/or a customer of the RES 

Cooperative. Despite cultural differences between Europeans, considering that the RES 

Cooperatives which participated in this survey are from three different European regions, 

Southern Europe (Portugal and Spain), Central Europe (Germany) and Western Europe 

(Netherlands, Belgium and UK), the motivations that make people join to such green revolution 

are basically the same regardless of the place of origin or traditional culture. 

Thus, as shown in Figure 83, the biggest motivation for the consumer is the Pro-RES approach. 

People are increasingly more aware about what is going on in the world and believe that the use 

of RES is the only possible way out for a new global energetic paradigm. Moreover, the 

consumer believes that this new energetic paradigm should be built on a decentralised model of 

power production and supply, which contributes for the development of the local community 

and economy, and interestingly wants to participate and conduct itself this "green revolution", 

through the governance of their local energy systems and utilities. 

However, there are customers who do not know anything about the mission and vision of the 

RES Cooperative when they choose a new electricity supplier; they just switch due to the lack 

of trust in the big energy companies and the perceived corruption in the energy business. 

Basically, they just switch because there is a new offer in the market and hope to have a good 

service provided with this new entity.

Figure 84. Relation between the number of members and customers, since the RES Cooperative started the

It was plotted on a graph the evolution of the number of members and customers since the 

beginning of the electricity retailing supply activity of the four case studies. As shown in Figure 

84, the possibility to offer electricity has definitely contributed for the prosperity and growth of 

all the four RES Cooperatives which means that, the probability of happening the same with 

Coopérnico is real and is within reach of us all. Therefore, it is possible to confirm that the 

ability to retail electricity can increase the number of members of the Cooperative, and thus 

sharing with more people the RES Cooperative's vision for a new energetic paradigm that 

benefits the society as well as the environment. 

 

5. Portuguese Electricity Market 

5.1. An Overview of the Portuguese Liberalised Market 

Looking back into the evolution of the Portuguese electricity system it all started right after the 

Portuguese revolution, when key Portuguese power companies were nationalised. Aiming to 

have a single undertaking responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution of 

electricity throughout the territory, in 1976 a vertically-integrated monopoly company called 

Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) was created. 

Meanwhile, in 1981 Decree-Law 20/81 referred for the first time the possibility of self-

generation, for entities accessorily producing electricity from RES or using technologies that 

would lead to the reduction of primary energy consumption. In 1986, Decree-Law 149/86 

extended the idea to plants exclusively producing electricity and two years late, the Decree-Law 

189/88 recognised that a faster process was needed and the creation of conditions allowing for 

the economic viability of the small plants. This Decree-Law replaced the previous documents 

and established the rules for independent power production, allowing this production from RES 

and cogeneration [83]. 

Therefore, the Portuguese electricity system before the liberalisation may be represented 

through the figure 85:

Figure 85. Main features of the Portuguese pre liberalisation 

 

Briefly, as it will be discussed in the next section, the liberalisation of the Portuguese electricity 

market started in 1995, through a series of decree laws that anticipated the main principles of 

the First Directive.  

From that moment on, and in line with what was happening elsewhere in the Europe, the current 

Portuguese electricity system is the natural consequence of the successive transposition of the 

European Directives at the national level (Figure 86 and Figure 87).

Thus, and regarding the generation activity, companies may choose between two types of 

authorisations: Ordinary and Special Regime. The main players operating in Portugal are 

basically the same as in Spain: EDP, Iberdrola, Endesa and Galp. 

Aware that Portugal is a country full of natural resources, in the beginning of the century the 

Portuguese government led by José Socrates, introduced aggressive national policies to 

accelerate RES use. Such measures allowed the entry and growth of companies such as 

Acciona, Martifer Solar, dst Renováveis, Generg, Enercon, GE and GDF-Suez or the flowering 

of SMEs, such as Boa Energia, Ikaros-Hemera, Solar Project, FFSolar, Eurosolar, SunEnergy, 

Arménio Carreira Energias Renováveis, PluriEnergia, Enforce, SmartWatt or Catavento, for 

instance.  

 

In Portugal there is only one TSO and DSO: Rede Eléctrica Nacional (REN) and EDP 

Distribuição, respectively. Despite the legal unbundling of the electric transmission network in 

1996, since 2000 the high-voltage grid is owned by REN. 

 

Concerning the supply activity, the industrial sector was the first to be open up to competition, 

between 1999 and 2002. However, the eligibility of the household consumers was only effective 

in 2006, one year ahead the Second Directive’s framework.

In relation to national regulatory authorities, currently there are two entities responsible for 

proper functioning of the Portuguese electricity system: ERSE and DGEG.  

Also, Portugal shares with Spain an organised market, MIBEL, that include a day ahead market, 

located in Spain and managed by OMIE, and a forward and derivatives market, located in 

Portugal and managed by OMIP.  

 

 

Figure 87. Portuguese electricity system 

 

5.2. Evolution of the Legislative Framework behind the Portuguese Liberalised 

Market 

The organisational framework of the National Electricity System (SEN10) was approved in 1995 

(Decrew-Law 182/95 to 185/95) and established the coexistence of an Electricity Public Service 

System (EPSS) and an Independent Electricity System (IES), organised according to a market 

logic. This framework was changed in 1997, in order to fully incorporate the principles of the 

First Directive of the EPC of 19th December [84][85].   

Six years later, the Directive 96/92/EC was amended by a new document, Directive 2003/54/EC 

of the EPC of 26th June. As a consequence of these new guidelines to the establishment of the 

IEM, the framework set up in 1995 and then in 1997, was replaced by some transitional 

frameworks. It took almost three years for the government to approve a new national strategy 

contemplating the liberalisation process and promote competition in the energy market in 

accordance with the Second Directive guidelines. 

 

The signing of the Decree-Law nº 29/2006 [84], from 15th February, sets an electricity sector 

legislative framework articulated and coherent with the EU lines, including the key strategic 

goals approved by the European document released three years before. Thereby, the Decree-

Law established the new organisational and operational principles of the SEN as well as the 

general laws applicable to the exercise of generation, transmission, distribution and supply 

activities, in order to promote an open and competitive market. 

Going deep inside the document, in contrast with the previous regime, the new framework 

established an integrated SEN where the generation and supply activities fall under the regime 

of open competition by assignment of license agreement, and the transmission and distribution

infrastructures related with all the activities stated by the Decree-Law, in the national territory [84][85].

activities are performed by assigning of public service concessions (Figure 88). According to 

the Decree-Law these activities are supposed to be performed taking into account the correct use 

of the resources available and environment protection, including energy efficiency and the 

promotion of RES, plus the no damage to the obligations of public services [84][85].     

 

 

Figure 88. General features about the four sectors of SEN 

 

Regarding the generation activity, there are two types of generators. According to the Articles 

17 and 18 of the Decree-Law nº 29/2006, they are defined as: 

 

? Ordinary Regime Generator (ORG): It is considered all the generation activity that is 
not covered by a special legislation regime for electricity generation (e.g incentives for 

using RES or combined-cycle power plants); 

? Special Regime Generator (SRG): It is considered all the generation activity under a 
special legislation regime in the scope of adopting policies to encourage the generation 

of electricity, including the use of RES or combined-cycle power plants.      

 

There are also differences regarding to commercial relation. While the ORG can sell their 

electricity through the celebration of bilateral contracts both to end-users consumers and 

electricity suppliers, or through the participation in the organised markets, the SRG has 

privileged access regarding the commercialisation of the electricity to the last resort electricity 

supplier, under the conditions laid down in specific legislation. However, both have the right to 

ensure the supply in accordance with the liberalised market.

According to the document, the electricity transmission activity is carried out by exploiting the 

National Transmission Grid (RNT), and must be performed through a regime of exclusivity and 

by assignment of public service concession. This activity is considered legal and patrimonially 

separated from the other activities carried out under the SEN, and hence must ensure the 

independence and transparency of the activity exercise and its relationship with the others 

players acting in the SEN. As the RNT plays a vital role in the SEN, its operation integrates the 

overall technical management of the system ensuring then a good symbioses between the 

generation plants and the distribution activity. Essentially, its role is to ensure the security of 

supply and an integrated and efficient system operation.     

 

There is also another important activity in the SEN: the distribution of electricity. This activity 

is carried out through the operation of the National Distribution Grid (RND), which 

corresponds to the Medium and High-Voltage grid and the Low-Voltage grid. Such as the 

transmission activity, the Medium and High-Voltage grid is also operated through an exclusive 

concession granted by the Portuguese government. In respect to the Low-Voltage grid continues 

to be exploited by municipal concession, and there will be no loss for them if they directly 

explore their networks.  

Once again, this activity is legally separated from the transmission and the other activities not 

related to distribution. However this legal independence is not mandatory when a Low-Voltage 

distributors serves less than 100 000 customers.  

 

Regarding the supply activity, the Decree-Law nº 29/2006 sets the electricity supply activity 

open to competition, subject only to a licensing agreement regime. The electricity supply 

activity involves the buying and selling of electricity to end-user consumers or other agents 

under acquisition modalities that will be reviewed in the following section.  For that, they have 

the right of access to the transmission and distribution grids on payment of regulated tariffs. 

According to the same document, similar to the generation, in this activity there are two types of 

suppliers:  

 

? Ordinary Electricity Supplier; 
? Last Resort Electricity Supplier (LRES). 

 

Basically, by the Article 46 the difference between both is that the last one is subject to 

universal service obligations, ensuring to all consumers who request the meet of their electricity 

needs and are in compliance with applicable legislation for the effect. Also, it is an entity that is 

expected to act while the open market does not operate with full effectiveness and efficiency. 

Meanwhile, the role of LRES is, provisionally, allocated to electricity distributors for the 

duration of their concession. 

 

In the context of consumer protection, the same document defines “universal service” by the 

security of supply in terms of quality and continuity of service and protection regarding to 

tariffs as well as prices, and access to clear information.     

 

Therefore, the consumers may choose, without restrictions, their electricity supplier, not being 

the switch of supplier charged under the contractual point of view. Moreover, in order to 

simplify and make the switch of electricity supplier effective, it was also anticipated the creation

of an independent entity in a legal, organisational and decision-making sense, from the other 

entities in the SEN, called Logistic Operator for Switching Suppliers (OLMC).  

 

Also according to the Decree-Law, the activities of transmission, distribution, LRES and OLMC 

are subject of regulation, without prejudice for the competences of other administrative bodies, 

by the Energy Services Regulatory Authority (ERSE). Besides ERSE, there is another regulator 

called Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG), which responsibility is to 

monitoring the security of supply in collaboration with the concessionaire of the RNT. Both 

regulators have the responsibility to release an annual report concerning the development of the 

electricity sector, to the Portuguese government and EC. 

 

The Decree-Law nº 29/2006, from 15th February, which laid the baselines of the organisation 

and operation of the new electricity sector, refers to complementary legislation a set of 

conclusive norms, namely the procedural legal regimes of the activities of generation, 

transmission, distribution and supply of electricity, as well as the laws governing the activities 

of the logistics operation of switching supplier of electricity.  

Thereby, in the development and implementation of the principles said in the document, the 

Decree-Law nº 172/2006, from 23th August, establish the procedures of license agreement 

assignment for generators (ORG and SRG), as well as public service concession assignment for 

the RNT and RND [84][85]. 

With regard to the electricity supply activity, in 2009 was released the Dispatch nº 9244/2009 

regulating the content of the Article 50 of the amended document (Decree-Law nº 172/2006) 

[84][85]. The dispatch established all electricity supplier had the obligation to publish their 

pricing, using for this purpose the modalities of service and information to customers provided 

in the regulations for Quality of Service of the Electricity Sector, reinforcing thus the necessity 

of electricity suppliers to send to ERSE the following pricing information, as stated in the above 

Article 50: 

 

? The reference table charged or planning to charge, whenever a change occurs 
concerning prices;  

? The prices actually charged (quarterly and annual) with quarterly basis. 

   

The electricity sector is not static and since 2006 it has been in constantly development, 

influenced whether by the recently conditions created through the establishment of the current 

legislative framework and new dynamics caused by the creation of the MIBEL, in the same 

year. 

 

To this observed development in the electricity market, adding the needs for configurations of 

the LRES concept in accordance with the requirements stated by the Directive 2003/54/EC, as 

well as the several agreements signed between the Portuguese government and the Spanish 

government regarding to MIBEL, it was established through the Decree-Law nº 104/2010, from 

29th September, a timetable predicting the extinction of regulated tariffs to end-users customers 

with consumption in VHV11 and HV12, MV13 and SpLV14, from the 1st January 2011 [84][85]. 

                                                      
11 Very High-Voltage (VHV): Voltage between phases whose effective value is greater than 110 kV. 

12 High-Voltage (HV): Voltage between phases whose effective value is greater than 45 kV and less than 
or equal to 110 kV.

According to the Decree-Law, until the end of 31st December 2011, all the costumers should 

now be supplied under the liberalised market. During this period, customers who maintain their 

contracts supply with a LRES will be applied a transitional rate.  

 

At the same year this Decree-Law was released, a complementary document was also published 

focusing in the consumer protection policies. Being the MIBEL’s construction a top priority in 

the political agenda of the region, in order to take a step forward towards the liberalisation of the 

SEN, the Decree-Law nº 138-A/2010, from 28th December, had as the main objective the 

creation of social tariffs for end-users economically vulnerable ensuring then to every customer 

the access to the SEN [84][85].    

 

In tune with the Directive 2009/72/EC, in 20th June 2011 it was made the second amendment of 

the Decree-Law nº29/2006 with the introduction of a new organisational framework of the SEN: 

The Decree-Law nº 78/2011 (Figure 89) [84][85].

than or equal to 45 kV. 

14 Special Low-Voltage (SpLV): LV supply or delivery where contracted power is (i) Mainland Portugal - 
greater than 41.4 kW, (ii) Autonomous Region of the Azores – equal to or greater than 20.7 kW and is 

achieved by way of maximum power at 15 minute intervals, (iii) Autonomous Region of Madeira greater 

62.1 kW).

Figure 89. General features introduced by the Decree-Law nº 78/2011 

 

This document is the Portuguese interpretation of the Third Package and therefore aims to 

reinforce the division between the activities of generation and electricity supply, as well as the 

operation of the transmission gridlines as a way to achieve the establishment of an integrated 

IEM in the EU that allows the implementation of a more effective market competition. Thus, the 

Decree-Law nº 78/2011 suggests [84][85]: 

 

? ERSE to execute a certification procedure to the operator of the RNT, in order to assess 
the conditions of separation of activities; 

? Regarding to distribution activity, it is expected the strengthen of the transparency in the 
legal separation of activities, since the operator of the RND belonging to vertically

integrated company and serve a number of customers exceeding 100 000 shall need to 

develop a compliance program that includes measures taken to exclude discriminatory 

conduct. Moreover, it is established the rules for closed-grids which contemplates the 

possibility of intervention by the ERSE in the analysis and assessment of access tariffs, 

in cases of lack of transparency or fairness. 

 

The Decree-Law nº 78/2011 also empower the role of the regulators, ensuring more 

independence in the exercise of their regulatory functions, including supervision and 

certification. For instance: 

 

? It is strengthened ERSE’s role, namely in the certification of the operator of the RNT, 
promotion of regional markets and coordination of gridlines at European level through a 

cooperation with other regulatory entities, in accordance with the EU legislations.  

 

With regard to consumer protection, the Decree-Law aims to extend its policies relating to this 

field. It is expected the consumers rights are preserved by the introduction of new mechanisms, 

including: 

 

? The reduction of the electricity supplier switching period to lesser than three weeks. The 
consumers are able to achieve the switch without having to pay any termination fees; 

? Complaint management is responsibility of the regulator authorities, namely ERSE and 
DGEG.  

? Creation of a centralised information platform which offers relevant information, 
including the legislation on the protection of electricity consumers and dispute 

resolution mechanisms to protect their rights. 

? Inclusion of the consumer protection policies, in particular the “end-user economically 
vulnerable” concept and its features, stated in the Decree-Law nº 138-A/2010. 

 

Finally, it is expected from the Decree-Law nº 78/2011 to reinforce the rules of RNT and RND 

planning, so Portugal can keep in line with the EU goals of an IEM.  

 

Trying to face the economic crisis that Portugal has been going through, Decree-Law nº 

102/2011, from 30th September, was released with additional measures respecting the consumer 

protection. Thereby, in order to help guaranteeing all consumers the access to basic needs, 

including electricity, it was created the Extraordinary Social Support to the Energy Consumer 

(ASECE).     

 

At the same time this Decree-Law was published, two more documents were announced 

[84][85]:  

 

? Ordinance nº 275-A/2011, from 30th September; 
? Ordinance nº 275-B/2011, from 30th September. 

 

In execution to the previous Decree- Law, the Ordinance nº 275-A/2011 and the Ordinance nº 

275-B/2011 set the discount of the ASECE to be applied to electricity bills of end-users

economically vulnerable and establish all the necessary procedures and conditions to the 

assignment, application, conservation and monitoring of the ASECE, respectively.    

Continuing the process initiated two years before by the Decree-Law nº 104/2010, the Decree-

Law nº 75/2012, from 26th March, established a timetable predicting the extinction of regulated 

tariffs to end-users customers with consumption in StLV15. Regarding to this third amend of the 

Decree-Law nº 29/2006, it will be object of further analysis in the following section.  

 

Right after, it was published in 23th May 2012 the fourth amend (Decree-Law nº 112/2012) 

aiming the participation restriction in the share capital of the RNT and RND operators [84][85].  

 

The fifth and sixth amend to the previous Decree-Law nº 29/2006, arrived in 2012. With the 

Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 and the Decree-Law nº 215-B/2012, from 8th September, as it was 

expected a new adjustment in the organisational framework of the SEN towards the promotion 

of competitiveness, price transparency, as well as the correct functioning and full liberalisation 

of the electricity market (Figure 90) [84][85].

- 41.4 kW or lower, (ii) Autonomous Region of the Azores – 215 kW or lower and is not achieved by way 

of maximum power at 15 minute intervals, (iii) Autonomous Region of Madeira 62.1 kVA or lower.

Figure 90. General features introduced by the Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 and Decree-Law nº 215-B/2012 

 

In order to complete the full integration of the Directive 2009/72/EC, the first sector of the SEN 

to be modified was the generation activity.  

The Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 revealed changes regarding to the types of generators. That 

means, the SRG shall now comprise two models of remuneration: 

 

? The market remuneration regime (subject to market conditions); 
? And the previous special legislation regime. 

   

With respect to the transmission activity, the Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 lay down new rules 

concerning the RNT operator. For this purpose, in addition to the revision of the accreditation 

and review of the certification procedure if the concessionaire of the RNT is controlled by an 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

135 

 

entity belonging to EU, it is also expected now the same procedure if the operator is owned by 

some entity from countries outside the EU. 

 

Still in the transmission activity, the same document clarify and reinforce the requirements on 

independence, and legal separation concerning the RNT operator (full ownership unbundling), 

stated by the Decree-Law nº 112/2012. Therefore, it was suggested an alternative legal 

separation model to the current on provided by the Directive 2009/72/EC, through the figure of 

the ITO whose practicability depends on the application of the concessionaire RNT and 

approval by the Portuguese government. These measures are expected to  give ERSE free access 

in decision and conclusion of such procedures. 

 

Also, it set up mechanisms that allow the Portuguese government to monitor and supervise the 

activities of the RNT operator, that are not directly related to the RNT or the technical 

management of the system, in order to ensure that such activities are carried out independently 

and in harmony with the public interest. 

  

In relation to the RND, the Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 wants to guarantee the independency of 

the RND operator regarding the interests of electricity generation and supply. Thereby, it is 

expected the removal of the risk of discrimination in access to the gridlines and the prevention 

concerning the share of confidential information.  

 

As for the electricity supply activity, the obligation to purchase electricity generated under a 

special regime imposed on the LRES, passes now to be limited as long as the SRG benefit from 

special tariffs or other guaranteed compensation. 

After this period, the SRG will be able to sell their electricity on organized markets or through 

bilateral contracts as the ORG already do, or may sell it to a new regulated supplier called 

Aggregator Market Facilitator (AMF). This new entity, which will be assigned under license 

agreement, will purchase the electricity generated to open market prices, and will act as an 

aggregator of generation. In other words, the AMF has the obligation to purchase electricity for 

generators that wish it. 

 

Focusing on the most significant changes of the Decree-Law nº 215-B/2012, in the present 

Decree-Law was gathered all the legislation related to the SRG, that before was spreaded by 

several documents.  

 

With regard to electricity supply, with the Decree-Law nº 215-B/2012 access and operating 

rules in the open market have been simplified. That means, apart from the LRES and the AMF, 

the electricity supply activity is now open to competition, only subject to prior registration.  

 

Finally, in relation to consumer protection, the Decree-Law nº 215-B/2012 sets the electricity 

supply by LRES, not only to end-users economically vulnerable but also in places where there 

is no electricity suppliers under market regime, as well as in situations where the electricity 

supplier has been forbidden to execute its activity. Besides that, the document also expects 

ERSE to come up with a new centralised platform where consumers can have access to 

information beyond the one demanded in the Decree-Law nº 78/2011, including for instance 

latest legislations and the reference prices of all electricity suppliers.

136 

 

 

In the light of the commitments and objectives behind the Decree-Law nº 75/2012, Decree-Law 

nº 256/2012 adopted a set of measures aiming to prevent the rising trend of the various costs 

which affect, in the medium to long term, the final electricity bill, as well as the continuing 

exponential growth of the tariff deficit. 

Among the several measures aiming the stability of the tariff system, the Decree-Law nº 

256/2012, from 29th November, determines the extension of the extinction period of regulated 

tariffs to end-users customers with consumption in VHV and HV, MV and SpLV, in order to 

guarantee the correct transition to the liberalised market. Therefore, and despite the Decree-Law 

nº 104/2010 predicted all the costumers should now be supplied under the liberalised market, 

until the end of 31st December 2011, the Statement of Correction nº 78/2012 declared that 

LRES must continue to supply electricity to end-users customers with consumption in VHV and 

HV, MV and SpLV, until 31st December 2013. 

 

Furthermore, in the end of 2012, it was released on 21st December the Dispatch nº 16298/2012 

(Figure 91) [84][85]. This document introduced the three fundamental guidelines for DGEG to 

promote the electricity market, without prejudice to the role of ERSE in the transmission of 

information to consumers, including: 

 

? Promotion of all mechanisms and instruments available to consumers, regarding the 
protection of their rights; 

? Adequacy of how information will be spread throughout the different types of 
consumers, with a particular emphasis on communication to economically vulnerable 

end-users; 

? To promote active participation of the citizens during the transition period to the 
liberalised market, in order to exploit every opportunity to reduce electricity bills. 

 

 Thereby, it is also important that the promotion contains information related to:

5.3. Electricity Suppliers Operating in the Portuguese Open Market 

The process of liberalisation of the electricity sector in most of the European states was done 

progressively, and started by including customers with higher consumptions and higher voltage 

levels (VHV and HV). Portugal was no exception, and its electricity market has been 

progressively opened since the adoption of the First Directive framework, in 1996. Ten years 

Decree-Law nº 75/2012: Continuing the process initiated by the
by the Decree-Law nº 104/2010, this third amend of the Decree-Law
nº29/2006 establishes a timetable predicting the extintion of
regulated tariffs to end-users customers with consumption in StLV.

Decree-Law nº 112/2012: The fourth amend of Decree-Law
nº29/2006, was introducted aiming the participation restriction in

the share capital of the RNT and RND operators.

Decree-Laws nº 215-A/2012 and nº 215-B/2012: Fifth and
sixth amend of Decree-Law nº29/2006, that set a new organisational
framework of the SEN as well as an update to the general basis for all
the activities. These documents are the full integration of the Third
Package.

Decree-Law nº 256/2012: Tries to ensure the sustainability of
the SEN. Besides that, the document aims to promote the stability of
the tariff system.

Dispatch nº 16298/2012: The document introduced the three
fundamental guidelines for DGEG to promote the electricity market.

Ordinance nº 83/2013: It was set the value of the fee for
reviewing the application and the effectiveness of the registration for
the exercise of electricity supply activity.

later, in 6th of September 2006, the aims of Second Directive16 of the EPC were anticipated in 

one year, and all consumers in the continental territory of Portugal have been able to choose 

freely their electricity supplier based on the following acquisition modalities: 

 

? Celebration of electricity supply contract with electricity suppliers in the liberalised 
market; 

? Electric power contracting in organised markets or through bilateral contracts, in the 
case of customers with status of a market agent; 

? Celebration of electricity supply contract with last resort electricity suppliers, according 
to legal conditions and established regulatory laws. 

 

With these measures it was expected to increase the competition within the Portuguese 

electricity sector, reflecting in the level of prices and the improvement in the quality of the 

service, which should lead to greater satisfaction on the part of electricity consumers. 

 

The options available for the consumers are vast and different covering whether large 

consumers, industries or small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but in regard to the issue of this 

thesis and topic, the focus will be the domestic market segment.  

 

? Large consumers: Group of clients whose power plants are connected to VHV and HV 
electric networks;  

? Industries: Group of clients whose power plants are connected to medium-Voltage 
(MV) electric networks; 

? SMEs: Group of clients whose facilities are connected to low-voltage (LV) electric 
networks, and the contracted power is higher to 41.4 kW (Special Low Voltage, SpLV); 

? Residential: Group of clients whose facilities are connected to LV electric networks, 
and the contracted power is less or equal to 41,4 kW (Standard Low Voltage, StLV). 

 

Introduced the big picture regarding the liberalisation process towards the Portuguese open 

market, it is time to go into detail and understand the steps made until this moment, pointing 

also the legislative initiatives behind it.  

 

In the context of the realisation of the IEM, the adoption of the Third Directive framework 

(Directive 2009/72/EC) has brought more changes to Energy Portuguese law including the 

amendment of the regulatory legislation of the sector. This directive was also supported by the 

Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which celebrates the agreement 

between the Portuguese government, the European Central Bank (ECB), the EC and the

Thereby, in order to satisfy the above mentioned documents, a timetable was defined by the 

Portuguese government for the progressive extinction of regulated tariffs for end consumers. 

The Decree-Law nº 75/2012, from 26 of March, establish the framework that allowed the 

gradually extinction, by contracted power, of all the regulated tariffs charged to electricity 

customers with consumption in StLV [84][85]. It also introduced transitional regulatory 

mechanisms, that promote for existing customers with regulated tariffs the access to liberalised 

market, and protection measures for end-users economically vulnerable.  

The transitional period starts after the day chosen for the extinction of the regulated tariffs, and 

there will be two transitional periods (Figure 93). 

 

 

Figure 93. Transitional period for the extinction of the regulated tariffs 

 

During this transitional period, applicable to consumers who continue to be supplied by the 

LRES, ERSE will continue to set transitional rates every three months. After this period, all the 

new electricity contracts must follow the laws of the free market. To help consumers on their 

change, the transitional regulatory mechanisms includes also the access to all kind of 

information on the liberalisation process applied to electricity supply, as the different phases of 

extinction of regulated rates and corresponding transitional periods or steps to change electricity 

supplier.  

 

Concerning the second point, among the protection mechanisms stand out the commercial 

relations, the social tariffs, regulated by ERSE, and lower prices for customers economically 

vulnerable. In order to take advantages of these conditions, this type of customer must have a 

deal with last resort electricity suppliers rather than one of the electricity supplier playing in the 

free market. According to Decree-Law n.º 138-A/2010, from 28th of December, economically 

vulnerable consumers are considered to be all those who receive one of the following social 

benefits [84][85]: 

 

? Income support for the elderly;

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

? Social insertion income; 
? Unemployment benefit; 
? 1st tier of family allowance; 
? Disability living allowance. 

 

Basically, the document is the final update of the previous Decree-Law nº 104/2010, from 29th 

of September, which established the end of regulated tariffs to electricity customers with 

consumption in VHV and HV, MV and finally, SpLV17 from the 1st of January 2011[84][85] .  

 

As the Portuguese electricity sector is now a open market and the regulated tariffs will gradually 

come to an end, associated with these changes is the costumer’s responsibility for actively seeks 

for information, regarding to further development of the sector or electricity suppliers’ offers. 

This allows them to understand exactly what these changes imply before changing to a different 

supplier or tariff. But which are the options available in the market? 

 

At present, there are seven players competing in the electricity residential market (Figure 94). 

 

 

Figure 94. Currently electricity supplier companies operating in Portugal  

 

According to ERSE’s last review [86], published on July 2014, the number of customers in the 

open market in June grew by approximately 63% comparing to same month a year ago, 

corresponding thus to 2 904 130 costumers (Figure 95).

Figure 95. Total number of customers in the Portuguese open market [86]  

 

Characterising the liberalised market, is not hard to conclude that the number of customers 

come exclusively from the domestic sector, which represent in June 98% of the total of 

customers (Figure 96). 

 

 

Figure 96. Liberalised market characterisation (number of consumers) [86] 

 

Looking to the different types of consumers in the open market, almost all the large consumers 

(97%), industries (91%) and SMEs (86%) are already in the liberalised market (Figure 97). 

Nevertheless, from the 7 038 customers which remains in the regulated market, 4 793 customers 

are a SME, 2 235 customers are industries and 10 are HV large consumers, represent 14%, 9% 

and 3% of the number of consumers, respectively.   

 

Regarding residential customers, the sector has been growing substantially since 2012 and at the 

moment 47% of the customers are in the liberalised market.

Figure 97. Share in the liberalised market by sector (number of consumers) [86] 

 

The Portuguese liberalised market has been reporting a considerable increase in the number of 

customers, average monthly rate of 4.2%, representing now an annual consumption of 34 806 

GWh (average monthly rate of 1.4%) as shown in Figure 98.    

 

 

Figure 98. Annual consumption (GWh) in the Portuguese open market [86] 

 

Globally, the liberalised market represents almost 79% of the total consumption in the 

Portuguese continental territory in June (Figure 99).

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Figure 99. Share of the liberalised market in the total consumption of Continental Portugal [86] 

 

Looking again to the different types of consumers in the open market, the share of large 

consumers, industries, SMEs and residential customers represent 100%, 97%, 89% and 52% of 

the sector consumption, respectively (Figure 100).    

 

 

Figure 100. Share in the liberalised market by sector ( consumption) [86] 

 

Despite the domestic sector representing almost 100% of the number of clients in the 

Portuguese open market (Figure 96), the industrial customer still represents the biggest share 

regarding to consumption with 39%, followed by the domestic sector (27%), which is growing 

faster (70% comparing to June 2013), and the large consumers (25%). The last place belongs to 

SMEs with 8% of the total consumption in the liberalised market (Figure 101).

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

Figure 101. Liberalised market characterisation ( consumption) [86] 

 

In order to better understand the liberalised market, as well as the process regarding the 

extinction of the regulated tariffs, it is also important to make an brief characterisation of the 

LRES activity. At the moment the number of clients supplied by a LRES are localised in the 

residential sector, with 98% of the total of customers (Figure 102).  

 

 

Figure 102. LRES activity characterisation (number of consumers) [86] 

 

In relation to the others 0.2%, it is expected to get closer and closer to zero as the consequences 

regarding to extinction of regulated tariffs to each sector become gradually effective. Thus, as a 

consequence of this dominant position in the LRES activity, the share of consumption about the 

residential customers is, naturally, above the 90% (Figure 103).

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

147 

 

 

Figure 103. LRES activity characterisation (consumption) [86] 

     

Looking closely to the residential sector (Figure 104), customers with power greater than or 

equal to 10.35 kVA, the date scheduled for the end of the transitional period is 31st December 

2014, and in June, these consumers represent about 12% of total customers still supplied by a 

LRES. The others 88% concern to customers with power less than 10.35 kVA, which transitory 

period ends in 31st December 2015.  

 

 

Figure 104. Characterisation of the residential sector in the LRES activity [86] 

 

Focusing now in the options available for customers (Figures 105 and 106), at the moment, EDP 

is the number one electricity supplier operating in the Portuguese liberalised market in respect 

whether to number of consumers (86%) or consumption (46%).

The designation “Outros” includes electricity suppliers as ENAT, Enforcesco, Audax or Axpo, 

even though these last two do not operate in the residential sector.  

 

 

Figure 106. Share of each electricity supplier in the liberalised market (consumption) [86] 

 

The open market expression of the three major electricity suppliers (EDP Comercial, Endesa 

and Iberdrola) in June represents almost 85% of the electricity supply and about 94% in relation 

to the number of customers. 

 

Analysing each sector, the Large consumers sector’s consumption is led by EDP Comercial 

(30%), followed by Endesa (25%), Iberdrola (17%) and Fortia (14%) as shown in Figure 107.

EDP is also leading the consumption in the Industries sector with a share of 30%, followed 

closely by Iberdrola (29%) and Endesa (27%), making this sector the most competitive of the 

four (Figure 108).   

 

 

Figure 108. Share of each electricity supplier in the Industries sector (consumption) [86] 

 

In the SMEs sector (Figure 109), EDP is once again the leader with a share of 48%. The next 

electricity supplier is Iberdrola with a share of 19%, followed by Endesa (16%) and, Galp Gas 

and Natural Fenosa with 7% each.

Figure 109. Share of each electricity supplier in the SMEs sector (consumption) [86] 

 

As the residential sector is the most important to the issue of this thesis, it is relevant to point 

that the residential customer sector, besides having the greater business concentration, it is the 

one with the smallest share in the liberalised market (only 47% of the customers in the 

liberalised market). Because of that, the sector offers more opportunities to electricity suppliers 

to capture customers who are still in the regulated market.   

 

 

Figure 110. Share of each electricity supplier in the residential sector (consumption) [86] 

 

Analysing the sector (Figure 110), EDP is the current leading electricity supplier, position 

mostly achieved thanks to its historical background as the sole electricity supplier when the 

Portuguese electricity market was regulated. Therefore, it is not strange EDP’s unquestionable 

share of 83%.  That means the space for the others competitors is narrow, making thus the

competition between them tight as the numbers suggest: Iberdrola (5.3%), Endesa (4.5%), Galp 

Energia (4.2%), Gas Natural Fenosa (3%) and the others (0.3%). 

 

With the Portuguese liberalised market characterisation done, it is now time to take a closer 

look to the companies which are operating in the electricity market.  

 

5.3.1. EDP Comercial 

 

 

The EDP Group is among the most powerful and influential European companies acting 

nowadays in the electricity sector and can also be considered one of the largest Portuguese 

economic entities, probably as consequence of its historical background.  

Taking this last note, its roots are traced to the period right after the Portuguese Revolution, 

when the Portuguese government decided to merge all the Portuguese continental companies 

regarding to generation, transmission, distribution and electricity supply into a single one. From 

this nationalisation process, and according to the Decree-Law nº 502/76 EDP – Electricidade de 

Portugal, Empresa Pública was created in 30th July 1976. Three fundamental challenges were 

expected of this new entity, including: 

  

? The electrification of the country; 
? The modernisation and extension of the RNT and RND as well as the planning, 

development and edification of the SEN; 

? Establishment of an unique tariff transversal to all customers; 

 

With these guidelines behind, in the mid-eighties the EDP’s RND covered 97% of the 

continental territory of Portugal and guaranteed around 80% of the LV electricity supply [87]. 

 

In 1986, Portugal joined to EU and since then the country polities are in hands with the EU 

legislation. Therefore, the 1989 revision of the constitution eliminated much of the 

remaining Marxist rhetoric of the original document, abolished the communist-inspired 

"agrarian reform", and laid the groundwork for privatisation of nationalised firms.  

EDP is one of these examples, and in 1991 was transformed in a anonymous company (S.A) 

under the Decree-Law nº 7/91, from 8th January, and in 1994 it was formed the EDP Group 

after a deep restructuring process [87].  

 

Just focusing on the electricity supply activity, the firm is considered the largest electricity 

supplier in the Portuguese open market and on the other side of the border, is among the top five 

players.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

152 

 

Regarding to the Portuguese sector, EDP operates through the name of EDP Comercial while in 

Spain the electricity supply activity is performed by EDP-HC Energía (ex-Hidrocantabrico 

Energia) [87].   

 

Besides its role as EDP Comercial in the open market, the firm also operates as a LRES. 

Thereby, in Portugal EDP, through EDP Serviço Universal, is delegated to supply all customers 

who choose to stay in the regulated market and the electricity needed to ensure the supply of 

these customers is acquired in the market or to SRG18 [87].    

 

5.3.2. Iberdrola 

 

 

Iberdrola is a Spanish multinational electricity company based in Bilbao, Basque Country, and 

is placed right behind Endesa, as the second largest electricity utility company in Spain. The 

firm was formed in April 1991, as a result of the merge between two major private utilities, 

Hidroelectrica España S.A. and Iberduero. The intention behind this joint was to create an 

entity that would be able to hold its own in the coming liberalisation of the EU’s power industry 

[88]. 

 

Iberdrola’s roots are traced in the beginning of the twenty century, when in July 1901 the 

mining engineer Juan Urrutia led a group of entrepreneurs in forming Hidroeléctrica Ibérica in 

Bilbao. Meanwhile, civil engineer José Orbegozo, at the head of another group of Bilbao-based 

entrepreneurs, set up the Sociedad General de Transportes Eléctricos (SGTE) with the intention 

of developing power installations along the international stretch of the river Duero [88].  

 

Right after, in 1907 a third company, Hidroeléctrica Española (Hidrola), was founded with the 

purpose to electrify the cities of Madrid and Valencia.  

 

After some years, SGTE went through a name change, became Saltos de Duero, and five years 

after the end of the Spanish Civil War, in 1944, STGE and Saltos de Duero merged  to form 

Iberduero. 

 

In the early 1990s, the state utility ENDESA, created by the Franco regime in the 1940s, drew 

attention to itself with a series of acquisitions. The Spanish government, worried that the 

spanish's smaller private utilities would be unable to compete in the coming Europe-wide 

market, encouraged ENDESA to swallow one small utility after another. To counterbalance 

ENDESA's growing influence, Hidrola and Iberduero made the decision to merge and the result 

was the creation of Iberdrola [88]. 

 

                                                      
18 According to Decree-Law nº 215-A/2012 the last resort electricity supplier, EDP obligated to purchase 

electricity generated under the Portuguese special regime.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

153 

 

In 1992, the firm started its internationalisation process when established a presence in Latin 

America, including for instance Argentina, Bolivia, Chile or Brazil. Moreover, in this new 

century the firm integrated ScottishPower and Energy East, currently known as Iberdrola USA, 

in its group and become a major multinational company, one the five largest electricity 

companies in the world [88]. 

 

Regarding to Portugal, the first contact was in 1998 when Iberdrola acquired 80% of Empresa 

Eléctrica de Guatemala S.A., in alliance with EDP. Some years after, the two firms partnered 

with the italian group Eni, in a deal to acquire a share in Galp Energia [88]. In relation to 

electricity market, Iberdrola is active in the sector since 2002.  

 

5.3.3. ENAT Electricidade 

 

 

ENAT – Energias Naturais, through ENAT Eletricidade, is also another national firm acting in 

the Portuguese liberalised market.  

Looking back at the history of ENAT, the company was born in the interior of Portugal, more 

exactly in Castelo Branco, and started its activity in the renewable energy market in 2004. At 

the moment, ENAT services are spread all over the national territory, with offices in Lisbon, 

Oporto, Castelo Branco, Viseu, Beja, Algarve, among others regions [89].  

However, pointing to more ambitious goals, in 2012 ENAT saw a window of opportunity in the 

electricity open market, and since November 2013 the firm included in its portfolio the 

electricity supply activity being thus from that moment, one more option to all residential 

customers who are in the electricity liberalised market [89]. 

The first customer to sign ENAT services came right after, in Castro Verde, followed by others 

in Castelo Branco and then all over the country. At the present, ENAT provides is services to 

approximately 2000 customers [90]. 

 

Regarding to ENAT offers, they do not have a retention period, which means the customer may 

quit is deal anytime, without penalty fee. Besides that, and according to its directors, the firm 

differs from the large companies by having a closer customer service and prices more accessible 

[89]. 

 

5.3.4. Endesa 

 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

If EDP is leading the Portuguese electricity market, it is also reasonable to say the largest 

operator in Spain is Endesa. Actually, these firms are fighting for the supremacy of the Iberian 

electricity market.  

 

Endesa’s history is quite similar to EDP once the firm, since the time of its foundation in 1944, 

was linked to the Spanish government. In fact, the firm on that time was 98% owned by 

Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI). INI was the state parent company, which owned all the 

power firms controlled by the Spanish government, including Empresa Nacional Hidro-

Electrica del Ribagorzana (ENHER), General Europea S.A. (GESA), Union Electrica de 

Canarias S.A. (UNELCO), Empresa Nacional Electrica de Cordoba (ENECO) and ENDESA. 

However, the things changed and in 1983, as part of the government general plan to make INI 

more efficient and modernise the country’s institutions in order to prepare the Spanish entry in 

the EC, all the companies under INI control were transferred to ENDESA’s authority. Since this 

reorganisation the firm has enjoyed a phenomenal growth and became the country’s largest 

electricity producer. As a result of a couple more deregulations and changes over the eighties 

and nineties, the company achieved the full privatisation in 1998 [91][92].  

 

Out of majority government control for the first time, the company continued with its 

restructuring plan, which had started in 1999, so that it could compete effectively in a 

deregulated market [91].  

Under this restructuring plan, ENDESA created ENDESA Servicios, ENDESA Generación, and 

ENDESA Distribución to oversee its internal needs, electricity production, and electricity 

distribution, respectively [92]. 

 

In Portugal, the Endesa Energia was the first electricity supplier in the Portuguese open market 

in April 2000. Two years late, ENDESA created Sodesa - Energy Trading SA, an even shared 

joint venture with the Portuguese group Sonae, with the aim of supply electricity and marketing 

services for Portuguese electricity customers in the liberalised market. However, the firm 

abandoned the open market in 2007 due to the unfavourable regulatory framework, and decided 

to come back when ERSE have set new rates for 2009, which the company considered 

attractive. 

Therefore, in January 2009, Endesa began a new step in the Portuguese electricity market when 

they come up with its own electricity supply company: Endesa Energia.  

 

5.3.5. YLCE/Enforcesco 

 

 

Founded as a spin-off of Enforce, Enforcesco S.A. is the most recent electricity supplier in the 

Portuguese electricity market. With is headquarters in Castelo Branco, more specifically in 

Covilhã, Enforcesco came up one year ago with the brand YLCE - Yes, Low-Cost Energy, to

materialize this new company business framework. Therefore, according to João Nuno Serra, 

Enforcesco’s CEO,  through YLCE it is Enforcesco’s main intention to operate, gradually, in 

the European energy market after 2015, period in which the firm plans to have already a solid 

role in the Portuguese open market [93][94]. 

 

Right now the firm has more than 1000 customers, independently of the size and type, and this 

is possible thanks to some advantages intrinsic to a low-cost company, including the low 

operational costs and the use of information and communication technologies optimising then 

all the business and relation process with customer. According to Enforcesco’s CEO, summing 

all elements it results in a lower and attractive price to the final user, comparing to the 

competition [93][94].  

 

5.3.6. Galp Power 

 

 

With three centuries of existence, Galp Energia, through the name of Galp Electricidade, is 

another agent operating in the electricity liberalised market. Despite in 2007, the firm’s efforts 

were the business and industrial customers, particularly those who were already customers, in 

2012 there was an extension of electricity supply to residential customers [95]. 

 

The first historical data of the company is from 26th August 1846. It is on this date that Queen 

Maria II authorised the opening of a competition to lighting the Lisbon by means of hydrogen 

gas, an event that would lead to the establishment of Companhia Lisbonense de Iluminação e 

Gás (CLIG). Two years after, it was lightened the firsts gas-fired lamps in Lisbon and that 

moment can be remembered as the birth of Galp Energia. From that event, it was a click to 

petroleum and natural gas technologies [95]. 

 

Galp Energia was established on 22 April 1999 under the name of GALP - Petróleos e Gás de 

Portugal, SGPS, S.A., resulting of a merger between Petrogal, Portugal's sole refiner and the 

main distributor of oil products, and GDP - Gás de Portugal, the company importing natural gas 

into Portugal and transporting and distributing it domestically [95].  

 

Exploring these companies, Petrogal was formed in 1976 from the merger of four Portuguese 

oil companies: Sonap, Sacor, Cidla and Petrosur, while GDP is the former Sociedade 

Portuguesa de Petroquímicos created in 1957 by Sacor and and CRGE, which are the merger 

between CLIG  and Companhia Gaz de Lisboa [95]. 

  

Currently Galp Energia is the leading integrated company of petroleum products and natural gas 

in Portugal and aims, through Galp Power, to be a solid option in the Portuguese electricity 

market as well.  

 

5.3.7. Gas Natural Fenosa 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

156 

 

 

 

Operating at the moment in 25 countries, Gas Natural Fenosa is the last but not least 

multinational company with activity in the Portuguese liberalised electricity market.  

 

With a background history similar to Galp Energia, under the name of Sociedad Catalana para 

el Alumbrado por Gas (SCAG), Gas Natural Fenosa was the first company to bring light to 

streets and public spaces in Barcelona, thus offering the first public service implemented in the 

city, in 1843 [96].  

 

From 1866, SCAG made a leap beyond the Catalonian territory and began geographical 

expansion throughout Spain with the purchase of some gas factories, as well as beginning to 

build factories of its own. At the end of the century, SCAG also entered into the business of 

thermal electricity and in 1911, hydroelectric power and one year later, the company changed its 

name to Catalana de Gas y Electricidad, S.A. (CGE), in order to incorporate the electricity 

activity in the company strategy [96]. 

 

1963 is the period that one of the greatest milestones in the firm was achieved, when 

CGE introduced petrol in the Spanish energy market, using it as a raw material to replace 

coal. At the end of the decade, Gas Natural S.A., a joint venture between CGE and Exxon, 

began the era of natural gas in Spain, mainly through the establishment of natural gas supply 

contracts with countries of Maghreb, among others events [96]. 

 

In 1987, CGE changed its name to Catalana de Gas S.A (CdG) and sold its conventional 

electricity shares. Five years later, in 1991, CdG merged with Gas Madrid, S.A. and 

absorbed different gas pipeline shares from Repsol, thus integrating the gas sector in Spain. The 

merger led to a new change of company name, becoming Gas Natural SDG [96].  

 

In 1992, Gas Natural SDG started its international expansion with the acquisition of assets in 

Argentina, and the incorporation of Gas Natural BAN. Five years later, it continued advancing 

throughout the South American territory to begin new activities in Brazil, Colombia and 

Mexico.  

The group’s solidity continued to consolidate when in 2002 it expanded into the Italian energy 

market. From then, and with the beginning of activities in Puerto Rico and France, the 

company's international expansion process has been unstoppable up to the point of 

reaching more than 25 countries worldwide, including Australia, South Africa, Oman, the 

Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Belgium and Germany [96]. 

 

One of the great turning points that transformed the group's history was the merger by 

absorption with Unión Fenosa and Unión Fenosa Generación, in 2008, which resulted in 

the first integrated gas and electricity company in Spain, as well as in Latin America: Gas 

Natural Fenosa.

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

157 

 

With the integration of the two companies, the group became even stronger, more efficient and 

more competitive and it is today one of the top 10 leading European firms in the energy 

business [96]. 

 

In Portugal, Gas Natural Fenosa operates in the liberalised electricity market through Unión 

Fenosa Comercial. Basically, Gas Natural Fenosa only took advantage of Unión Fenosa’s 

consolidated deployment in the Portuguese market previously to the company’s acquisition, 

once the firm had been operating as an electricity supplier in the Portuguese market since 2004 

[96].  

 

There are different aspects a consumer must be aware in the time to choose its electricity 

supplier in order to reduce the electricity bill, like the current household energy consumption, 

reliability and the rating of customer service provided by the electricity supplier, or even the 

terms of a contract. However, there are also two important parameters: 

 

? The cost of electricity: tariff rates of each electricity supplier; 
? Environmental impact: the percentage of electricity each electricity supplier generates 

from RES; 

 

Despite the possible advantage of being a social company, these are the two aspects a RES 

Cooperative, as Coopérnico, can use to make the difference in the electricity retailing business.  

 

But what is Coopérnico, its roots and how can a social company enter in this competitive world? 

Thus, with a general description of the Portuguese liberalised market, as well as the main 

players operating in the residential market, it is time to answer to these questions right away. 

 

5.3.8. The incoming of a new player: Coopérnico 

 

 

Inspired by the success model of several European RES Cooperatives, Coopérnico is the first 

RES Cooperative in Portugal and it was founded in late 2013, by a group of 16 people from 

different areas and with different professional backgrounds sharing the vision of a fair and 

responsible renewable energy model that may contributes to a social, environmental and 

sustainable energy future (Figure 111).

Figure 111. Relation between Coopérnico’s commitments, vision and mission 

 

With the clear objective to grow whether in membership and citizen involvement in initiatives 

that promote the sustainable development, the Coopérnico’s business plan, approved in 

December 2013, established a realistic goals for the next five years, including, for instance, the 

expectation to have more than 1500 members by the end of 2017 (Figure 112). 

 

 

Figure 112. Coopérnico objectives for the beginning of each year 

 

Thus, in the context of the process towards the full liberalisation of the Portuguese electricity 

market, Coopérnico aims to be the hub for people and organisations wishing to create a new 

energetic paradigm, mainly through (Figure 113):

Figure 113. Economic activities and organisational structures of Coopérnico 

 

Regarding to the first economic activity, Coopérnico invests through equity interest in solutions 

for decentralised RES generation. These societies may be related, or not, to the Cooperative. At 

present, there are four projects already in activity and two more in development.  

Still in the same branch, Coopérnico also offers services of consulting and advising to potential 

stakeholders in this activity. 

 

In respect to the electricity supply activity, the Cooperative proposes to be able to provide the 

100% electricity supply based on RES to all LV customers (citizens, businesses firms and other 

stakeholders). 

 

Linked to its global strategy, and in addition to their economic activities, Coopérnico has also an 

organisational structure comprised in three pillars. 

 

Therefore, aiming to promote the Cooperative in the national territory, as well as the progressive 

environmental and energy awareness among its citizens, Coopérnico wants to invest in the 

creation and propagation of Regional Centres throughout the country. All these poles will be 

overseen by a central organ, whose functions will be the definition of the requirements needed 

to create new Regional Centres, the monitoring of its creation and development, as well as the 

coordination of all activities executed by Coopérnico’s Regional Centres. Currently is already in 

activity the Regional Centre of Oporto and being in launch phase the Regional Centre of Braga. 

 

Moreover, Coopérnico also proposes to support the use of RES and the promotion of energy 

efficiency tips to the Cooperative members, as well as the development of guidelines regarding 

energy saving measures to be applied for all the establishments where there are or will be 

installed projects.

Figure 114. Five different thematic Working Groups  

 

Finally, Coopérnico intends to create several Working Groups (Figure 114), which may help to 

define action plans and strategies for the success of the Cooperative. These groups will work, 

and be made, with the voluntary participation of Cooperative members. 

 

Thus, in order to follow the developments in the energy sector, identify areas of potential 

interest to Coopérnico and evaluate the respective interest, it is proposed to create an working 

group called “ Scouting, Areas of Activity, Innovation” to address these issues. This working 

group will also focus on the establishment of partnerships with industry or academic 

institutions, to study and developing new RES generation projects. 

 

Adopted a model that combines economic and environmental benefits to social solidarity, 

Coopérnico also assumes the commitment to promote social or educational activities, ensuring 

then the involvement of its own members and partners in these activities, as well as the 

commitment to invest in local development, whenever the Cooperative intends to implement a 

given project. 

 

In order to meet its members and the Portuguese society in general, it is also essential to 

establish a group that manages the Coopérnico’s image, as well as the organisation of the 

Cooperative events, such as General Meeting, newsletters, communications to members or 

promotional campaigns relating to the Cooperative. 

 

It is also expected that another group can be responsible for the development of a manual that 

summarises all the rules of conduct and management of Coopérnico’s activities, such as hiring, 

working members’ remuneration and rules for the holding of General Meeting, among others. 

 

Regarding to “Retailing” working group, it is proposed that this group be responsible for 

monitoring the MIBEL, in order to anticipate future changes in the market development. Thus, 

based on this monitoring, Coopérnico intends to come up with innovative strategic solutions 

that can not only consolidate Coopérnico’s evolution within the MIBEL, but also to protect the 

interests of its members. 

 

All those who purchase at least three titles in capital in the amount of € 60 are accepted as 

members by the board of directors. At the moment, Coopérnico has four different types of 

membership (Figure 115):

Like all others competitors, a RES Cooperative must follow a set of well-defined steps in order 

to become an electricity supplier. Thus, the first step a RES Cooperative must fulfil is the 

development of a standard request demanded by the legal framework for the Portuguese 

electricity sector.

Upon submission of the application (Figure 118), the document is analysed by DGEG and 

automatically accepted, if will not be released any comment within 30 days from the date of 

submission. In case of approval, the elements referred to in Article 46 are automatically enrolled 

in the register of electricity suppliers.  

 

For the assessment and effectiveness of the registration, the RES Cooperative shall pay a fee to 

DGEG, which is defined by the Ordinance nº 83/2013, from 26th February. Thus, by the Article 

2, it is established a fee of € 1,000 and according to the following article the payment shall be 

made within 5 days after the generation of the reference payment, under penalty of application 

be outright rejected. The registration process is explained in Figure 119. 

 

 

Figure 119. Registration process 

 

Submitted and approved the RES Cooperative’s registration, there are several other steps the 

social enterprise must take and fulfil in order to transform the RES Cooperative in a Portuguese 

electricity supplier, including, for instance, the electricity acquisition process. However, to 

exercise the right to buy and sell electricity in the market, the RES Cooperative shall become a 

market agent. 

 

Besides MIBEL overview, the following sections will answer to questions such as:  

 

? Who are the operators acting in the MIBEL and their functions? 
? What are the requirements and procedures to become a market agent? 
?  How many ways the RES Cooperative has to purchase electricity? Which are they? 

 

5.4. Operation of the Iberian Electricity Market 

One of the natural consequences of the First Directive in Southern Europe was the conceiving of 

the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). However, this natural response of the Iberian countries 

was not done overnight. In fact, took almost 10 years to be 100% launched. 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

165 

 

 

Traveling around the history of MIBEL, it all commenced in 1998, period wherein the 

Portuguese and Spanish governments started debates and conducted research studies in order to 

increasingly dismantle the barriers and encourage the establishment of the MIBEL. 

  

According to MIBEL website [97], since then, a number of events took place, including the 

joint of both electrical systems that was formally initiated with the signing of the "Protocol for 

collaboration between the Portuguese and Spanish Administrations for the formation of an 

Iberian Electricity Market", in November 2001. 

In that document, it was established between the two countries the foundations necessary to 

begin cooperation among the many entities with responsibilities in the sector framework 

(administrations, regulators and operators), with a view to harmonising the participation 

conditions of economic agents on MIBEL. 

 

In the context of the XVIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit, in October 2002, the organisational 

model for MIBEL was decided as well as the main objectives for its materialisation, adopting as 

a strategy for its creation an intermediary regional approach of the integration of the Portuguese 

and Spanish markets into a single European market.  

This organisational model is based on the existence of the Iberian Market Operator (OMI), 

owned in even share by both governments, with two poles: 

 

? The Portuguese division, responsible for the management of the derivate markets; 
? The Spanish division, responsible for the management of day and intraday markets.  

 

The same summit also states that the model shall follow a phased building model, based on 

three main pillars (Figure 120): 

 

 

Figure 120. The three main ideas behind the MIBEL organisational model, set by both governments in the 

XVIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit 

 

On year later, at the XIX Portuguese-Spanish Summit, both governments signed a Memorandum 

of Understanding relative to the necessary conditions to complete MIBEL, including a timetable 

predicting all the steps to achieve this Iberian Electricity Market. 

Harmomisation of the economic conditions of participating on the market, through
the convergence of procedures to define fees, competitor transition costs, access
conditions to the interconnections, degree of openess and the formation of OMI.

Harmonisation of legal and regulatory framework of the economic conditions for
participating on MIBEL and of the systems operational procedures.

Establishing a phsysical support plataform for the Iberian regional market,
supported by the development of transport infrastructures and the articulation of
energetic planning and transport networks.

166 

 

Besides the timetable, the signing of an International Agreement was also foreseen, which 

would formalise the creation of MIBEL. This marked the official launch of the integration of the 

Portuguese and Spanish electricity systems.  

 

Thus, it did not took too long to the sign of a document contained a plan for the integration of 

both electricity markets. The “Agreement between the Portuguese Republic and the Kingdom of 

Spain for the Constitution of an Iberian Electrical Energy Market” signed in 2004, consolidated 

the foundations for the construction of a common market, outlining the general development of 

the project, not just at a legislative and regulatory level but also the market’s operational 

solutions, including: 

 

 

Figure 121. General foundations for the construction of a common market, set by both governments in the 

XIX Portuguese-Spanish Summit 

 

Under the terms of this agreement (Figure 121), the launch of MIBEL and the start of the 

integrated working of the two MIBEL divisions should have happened in the same year.  

However, due to some circumstances of political and legal nature the schedule was postponed.  

 

Taking advantage of this postponement, the two governments decided to review the MIBEL 

constitution project, which was formalised with the signing of a new International Agreement 

still in the year 2004, under the scope of the XX Portuguese-Spanish Summit.  

This new agreement covered topic such as (Figure 122): 

Establishment of two divisons

(responsible for the management of the organised markets, before the creation of 
OMI)

OMEL (Spanish division), responsible for 
the management of the day and intraday 

market.

OMIP (Portuguese division), responsible 
for the management of the derivative 

markets.

Reciprocal recognition of agents

If an agent were granted the status of generator, marketer or other, by one country, 
this would imply automatic recognition by the other country, granting equal rights 

and obligations to that agent.

Summit  

 

Thus, the new agreement decided that the launch of MIBEL would take place until 30th June 

2005. 

 

However, the expected difficulties in overcoming the pre-launch period were aggravated once 

again due to political and legal factors that would not permit the official launch of MIBEL in the 

schedule previously foreseen. Among these setbacks were: 

 

? Significant political changes in Portugal, with the election of a new government, which 
only came into power in March 2005; 

? This fact led to the lack of legal developments needed to launch OMIP; 
? Uncertainties in MIBEL’s regulatory framework led to the construction of a “White 

Book” on the electrical sector, and its impact on the organisational and working model 

of MIBEL. 

 

In 2005, at the XXI Portuguese-Spanish Summit, both governments reinforce their commitment 

to building the MIBEL, agreeing that the following steps would be taken, during 2006 (Figure 

123): 

 

Obligates the parties 
to develop the 

legislation needed for

Figure 123. Proposed steps to reinforce the commitment to create the MIBEL, set by both governments in the 

XXI Portuguese-Spanish Summit 

 

In 2006, during the XXII Portuguese-Spanish Summit, the Portuguese and Spanish governments 

reiterated their commitment to expanding the MIBEL (Figure 124). Thus, both governments 

decided to request, from the Energy General Directors, a regulatory compatibility plan, which 

include a common energy contracting model for last resort distributors and retailers of both 

countries, both spot and derivatives, to be executed under the scope of OMI. 

The both governments also decided for 2007: 

 

Figure 124. Governments’ extra requests to reiterated their commitment to create the MIBEL, set by both 

governments in the XXII Portuguese-Spanish Summit  

  

In 2007, in line with the XXII Portuguese-Spanish Summit guidelines, the governments of 

Portugal and Spain, drew out a regulatory compatibility plan based on six core initiatives 

(Figure 125): 

 

To implement the Iberian spot
market, through coordinated
interconnections management
based on market splitting and
explicit auctions as proposed by
the Regulators Committee.

To request from the Regulators
Committee, a review of the
interconnections mechanism
proposal and a proposal for the
power guarantee mechanism,
which respects each countries’
specificities.

The Energy General Directors
should propose the general OMI
organisation and management
principles.

The OMI implementation
model should be detailed,
scheduled and completed by
OMIP and OMIE in conjunction.

Maintain the compulsory
percentage of 10% purchase of
energy by regulated distributors
on OMIP.

Organise in a prudent manner,
the Iberian virtual capacity
auctions.

Figure 125. Main ideas behind the regulatory compatibility plan, set by both governments in the sequence of 

XXII Portuguese-Spanish Summit 

 

At the XXIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit, that took place in 2008, and with a view to speeding 

up the development of the MIBEL, both governments signed the Amendment Agreement of the 

XX Portuguese-Spanish Summit, with the following fundamental points (Figure 126):   

 

Harmonisation of the power guarantee mechanisms, taking into account the specificities of each
system.

Implementation of interconnection management mechanisms based on market splitting and explicit
auctions that optimise the use of interconnections and competition in an Iberian context.

Promote the liberalisation and definition of a tariff convergence plan, through a last resort tariff policy,
the harmonisation and convergence of interruption mechanisms and access tariffs, the creation of a
harmonised mechanism for energy acquisition by last resort retailers and distributer, the convergence
of the role of logistical operators when changing retailer.

Definition of common rules to increase competition on MIBEL and reduce market power (introducing
the concept of a dominant Iberian operator with harmonised limits and restrictions between the two
countries).

Strengthen the communication between System Operators, through the exchange of stakes between
REN and REE and speeding up the strengthening of the interconnections.

Definition of OMI’s general organisation and management principles to be implemented based on two
shareholder holdings, with head offices in Portugal and Spain, that will each hold 50% of the market
managing companies. The two shareholders will be managed by a common Board of Directors.

Figure 126. Main ideas behind the Amendment Agreement of the XX Portuguese-Spanish Summit set by both 

governments in the XXIII Portuguese-Spanish Summit 

 

In 2009, at the XXIV Portuguese-Spanish Summit, both governments agreed the final 

constitution of the OMI, through the integration of both operating organisms and the creation of 

a joint working group to accompany the process. The Portuguese and Spanish governments also 

decided to propose the nomination of Eng. José Carvalho Netto, as OMI Chairman. 

 

In the same year it was also signed the International Treaty, which stated the foundation of the 

company OMIP- Iberian Market Operator SGPS, S.A (Portuguese Holding) was incorporated, 

to which was transmitted all the shares representing OMIP’s share capital.  

 

Two years later, in 2011, the last changes were made in the corporate plan to the definitive 

constitution of the OMI, namely: 

 

? An exchange of shares between the Portuguese (OMIP SGPS) and Spanish (OMEL) 
holdings took place leaving OMIP and OMIE being held in equal parts by these two 

OMI holdings. 

? REN, which had a 90% stake of the Portuguese Holding Company reduced its 
participation to 45% through sales to several agents. In the near future REN´s 

participation will be further reduced to 10% of the OMI capital. 

 

The role of the Regulators Board is detailed.

The principles regarding the setting of last recourse tariffs are agreed upon.

Clarifies some points in relation to the economic management of the interconnection between
Portugal and Spain.

Regarding the supply of competition, establishes the concept of dominant operator and the range of
possible consequences.

Establishment the role of last recourse retailers on OMIP.

Building the foundations for the OMI, based on two management entities with investment stakes,
with head offices in Portugal and Spain and cross stakes of 10% where each company will hold 50 %
of each of the market management companies.

The final important step towards the implementation of the OMI, was done in the end of 2011 

when took place the first meeting of the common Board of Directors of the companies that 

manage the MIBEL: OMIE (spot market) and OMIP (derivatives market). 

 

5.4.1. Operators and Trading Members at MIBEL 

As said before, the MIBEL agreement provides that the current Portuguese and Spanish market 

operators will be merged into a single Iberian market operator that will operate with two 

interconnected centres in Lisbon and Madrid.  

Whilst this does not happen, at the moment MIBEL is operated by three distinct companies: 

 

? OMIE: The Spanish division of the Iberian Energy Market Operator, which is 
responsible for the spot electricity market with daily transactions and intraday 

adjustments (intraday markets), wherein electricity sale (production) and purchase 

programmes are established for the day following that of the trade.  

? OMIP: The Portuguese division of the Iberian Energy Market Operator, that ensures 
the management of the MIBEL futures market in Portugal and is currently a regulated 

market.  
? OMIClear: The Clearing Platform for the Iberian Forward/Derivatives Markets, which 

acts as a clearing house, central counterparty and managing entity of the settlement 

system. Fundamentally, its main activity is that of clearing, registration, risk 

management and the settlement of transactions traded on the OMIP.  

 

In spite of the successive restrictions on participatory interests in the managing companies of 

the market operators, imposed by the transitional period regime, the technical system operation 

of the markets is still assured by the two companies responsible for the management of the 

Iberian transmission networks: REE and REN, respectively.  

It is also important to say, in name of transparency on the business, that none of the five 

previous companies buy nor sell electricity (Figure 127).

Focusing on OMIE, the electricity market where the RES Cooperative aims to participate, 

currently there are four market participants: 

 

? Electricity power producers; 
? Resellers; 
? Qualified direct consumers in the market; 
? Representatives. 

 

In order to operate on the market managed by OMIE, buying and selling electricity, the RES 

Cooperative must comply with several preliminary and complex requirements established in the 

regulations that can be identified in OMIE’s website [98].  

According to OMIE Market Access Guide (OMAG)[99], the first step of the process begins with 

the activation of the local Energy Identification Code (EIC19).  

This activation is carried out through a request submitted to any Local Issuing Office (LIO). In 

the case of Coopérnico, the EIC code is supplied and administered by the Portuguese LIO: 

REN.  

 

However, in order to achieve the EIC code it is important to have initiated the request of the 

status of Market Agent. Why? Because the RES Cooperative must provide the code of Agent in 

OMIE (5 characters). This code of Agent in OMIE will be a constituent part of the local EIC 

code to be issued by REN.   

The allocation of an EIC code to a market participant is broken down into three main steps: 

 

? Submission by the market participant: the RES Cooperative applies to REN for a 
EIC code; 

? Validation and allocation: REN validates the credentials of the RES Cooperative and 
allocates the code; 

? Verification and Integration: REN publishes the allocated EIC code on its LIO web 
page.    

 

There is no financial cost on the activation of the EIC code.  

 

Once the EIC code is obtained, the second step of the process is an electronic procedure (Figure 

128), through which the information required for acquiring the status of market agent is 

provided to OMIE. This electronic process is divided into two phases: 

 

                                                      
19 The EIC code is the easiest and most reliable way to identify the market participants and other entities 

active within the European IEM. The EIC coding scheme is maintained by the European Network of 

Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E).

173 

 

 

Figure 128. General description regarding the two phases of the electronic procedure 

 

As part of the first phase of the electronic process, there is some required extra information 

(written hard copies of additional documents) that must be referred to OMIE: 

 

? Copy of the document issued by the Tax Agency certifying the Tax identification 
Number (VAT or NIF, in Portuguese) of the RES Cooperative or the Representative 

Agent.  

? Copy of the National Identity Card (BI, in Portuguese) of the person signing the request, 
(person included on the form as the entity’s representative, who must have sufficient 

powers for conducting all the acts and signing all the documents required for the 

complete adhesion of the requester, or his clients to the Market).  

 

After activating the EIC code, it is time to go straight to the first phase of the electronic 

procedure (Agent Registration Form). Within the first phase, the RES Cooperative must define 

between two options which one will choose for purchasing electricity in the market: 

 

? Being a Market Agent; 
? Access to the market through a Representative Agent. 

 

As the process is different depending on the option considered, it is important to analyse each 

one independently. 

 

Being a Market Agent: 

 

Thus, after the first phase of the electronic process is carried out (Figure 129): 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

174 

 

 

 

Figure 129. Proceeding between the two phases of the electronic process 

 

The cryptographic card is sent to the attention of the person inside the RES Cooperative that has 

been authorised to carry out the administrative actions, along with elements or information 

required for its use, such as: 

 

? Card reader and the software and information required for its use; 
? An e-mail with the PIN. 

 

Since the information is private, the OMIE’s Market Agent Website in the second phase of the 

electronic process (www.mercado.omie.es), is accessed with help of this cryptographic card to 
confirm the identity of the person and allows safely entering or modifying the associated data. 

 

The set of data required to be entered through this application is the following (Figure 130):

175 

 

After the second phase of the electronic process is completed, there is a set of events that may 

be compiled in the following figure: 

 

 

Figure 131. Proceeding after the second phase of the electronic process 

 

Once all the information received through the electronic forms has been verified and the hard 

copies have also been received and verified, OMIE notify the completion of the process and the 

acquiring of the Market Agent status by the RES Cooperative. 

 

Access to the market through a Representative Agent: 

 

In this case, the process is simpler for the RES Cooperative’s side. Basically, the Representative 

Agent is responsible for the whole process, as it’s explained below. 

 

Therefore, after activating the EIC code, the RES Cooperative only have to indicate in the Agent 

Registration Form that is going to access the Market through a Representative Agent.  

 

Regarding the Representative Agent, it shall provide a paper copy of the authorisation of said 

representation, based on Form V and VII included in OMAG, which consists of the 

accreditation of the granting of sufficient powers so that the applicant company can act as 

representative for the RES Cooperative.   

The Representative Agent is also responsible for sending the written copies of the required 

documentation to OMIE. 

Assessment of the documentation submitted

OMIE accepts the electronic request

Then, it is send an e-mail containing the adhesion contract 

Two copies of the file must be print and each of its pages 
signed

Sending both copies to OMIE for signing

Then, one of the hard copies is returned to Coopérnico 
while the other remains in OMIE’s possession

Nevertheless, this copy is simply another requirement 
within the process for accessing the market

(not “per se” entails obtaining the status as market agent)



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

176 

 

 

Moreover, the Representative Agent shall fill out the different electronic forms to enter the 

information associated with the RES Cooperative. The entire process is carried out through the 

Market Web Agents Data Maintenance application in the OMIE’s Market Agent Website. 

Among the data to be electronically filled out, it is included the RES Cooperative’s bank 

account data that can be represented between two options: 

 

? “In the name and for the account of third parties”: It’s the account used by OMIE to 
pay the RES Cooperative directly; 

? “In its own name and for the account of third parties”: It’s the backup account 
exclusively used in the case that the Representative Agent-RES Cooperative 

relationship is terminated. 

 

Once all the electronic forms have been completed and the required documentation has been 

received at OMIE, the RES Cooperative is registered as a new agent. 

 

In order to operate in OMIE, the RES Cooperative must provide a financial warranty that would 

cover its bids for the next market session, as well as the payment obligations related to the RES 

Cooperative’s energy purchases until they are paid.  

Moreover, the financial warranty depends on the RES Cooperative’s customer portfolio and its 

energy demand forecasting. That means, the RES Cooperative is free to place on the market the 

amount of money that it decides according to its forecasts. However, in case the RES 

Cooperative does not have the minimum financial warranty to cover the bids, its purchases will 

be automatically rejected in the matching process. 

 

In relation to Coopérnico, at the moment the RES Cooperative does not have the appropriate 

human, technical and operational resources and know-how to perform directly in OMIE, but the 

main issue is the estimated financial warranty20: € 550,000.  

This total value of guarantee to be paid is based on the expected customer portfolio (3000 

customers) and their energy demands (9000 MWh), with a maximum expected purchase bid 

price of 70 €/MWh.  

Moreover, it is important to have a minimum amount of working capital. Based on the estimated 

energy demands (9000 MWh), and considering an applicable daily market estimated price of 

55€/MWh, Coopérnico needs to have every month approximately € 41,000 to purchase in 

advance the required energy demand for the next market session.    

As it is possible to identify the amount of financial capital required is unbearable. Even 

considering a loan of € 550,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, the annual cost for 

Coopérnico would be € 27,500 plus the € 41,000 every month. 

  

For the aforementioned reasons, added to the uncertainty regarding the number of customers 

and its energy demands for at least the first two years of operation, the “Access to the market 

through a Representative Agent” option seems the most reasonable choice for now. 

                                                      
20 The amount of payment guarantees was calculated according to the expected energy demand and sales, 

through the simulator available in the public site of OMIE [98].

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

177 

 

 

It is important to underline too, that such uncertainty in the numbers may lead to additional fees 

for the RES Cooperative. For instance, if consumers need more energy than the amount that the 

RES Cooperative buys, the Cooperative has to pay an extra fee for the energy consumed. The 

opposite is also true, if the RES Cooperative’s consumers do not use all the energy bought, the 

Cooperative has also to pay an extra fee. 

Despite the many forecasting solutions available, the energy markets are becoming increasingly 

complex. If even mature companies have trouble to know exactly how much energy they are 

going to need in advance, the scenario for the Coopérnico does not look very encouraging. 

Thus, the RES Cooperative’s access to the market can be done by two types of possible 

agreements with a Representative Agent:  

 

? Via Broker: The RES Cooperative indicates the needs of their customers and these are 
bought by the Broker.  

In this option, the adjustments and settlements are made directly by the Cooperative. 

The Broker is only in charge of buying the desired electricity volume without assuming 

any responsibility. 

? Via Business Process Outsourcing (BPO):  The transactions are undertaken based on 
an "outsourcing" methodology. 

Thus, the Representative Agent assumes not only the responsibility of buying the 

electricity needs of the RES Cooperative’s customers but the settlement of any 

adjustments, on the opposite of the first option.  

 

Obviously, the BPO agreement implies lower margins for the RES Cooperative but ensures the 

outsourcing of the risk of operating in the market. 

 

5.5. Conditions for access the transmission and distribution networks 

Considering the RES Cooperative’s eventual success for accessing to OMIE, the next natural 

step is to take the electricity purchased in the market to its customers. However, as it does not 

own any grid, the RES Cooperative shall also access the transmission and distribution networks, 

including the access to the energy market information system, through license agreements. 

 

5.5.1. Transmission network – REN 

As the RNT is done by REN, under a concession granted by the Portuguese government in the 

form of a public service provided exclusively, the RES Cooperative shall celebrate a license 

agreement with them. 

As a TSO, REN is responsible for the Overall Management of the System (GGS) which 

includes [100]: 

 

? The systemic coordination of infrastructures which make up the SEN, which ensures its 
full and balanced operation and the security and continuity of supply of electrical 

power; 

? The management of Ancillary Services through the operationalization of an Ancillary 
Services Market and the contracting of Ancillary Services following prior approval by 

ERSE;

? Settlement for transactions made within the scope of this activity, including imbalances 

settlement; 

? The reception of information from Market Agents which are members of organised 
markets or which are contracting parties in bilateral contracts, on facts liable to 

influence the regular operation of the market or the setting of prices in accordance with 

Commercial Relation Regulations for the Electricity Sector.  

 

According to the manual of procedures of the GGS [101], available in REN website, the RES 

Cooperative shall obtain the status of Market Agent in order to negotiate electricity through 

bilateral contracts, participate in the organised markets and in the Ancillary Services Market. By 

other words, become Market Agent within the GGS, and thus having the access to the energy 

market information system. 

The elements required for the celebration of the adhesion contract with the REN are: 

 

? The application for registration as a Market Agent (forward to REN). This document 
shall be requested to REN; 

? The access code to the permanent certificate of business registration, plus the 
identification of the Conservatory where it was done; 

? Identification of the persons responsible for the relationship with the GGS, as well as 
their contacts; 

? Required information for the effect of Settlement and Billing; 

 

In relation to the last two points, the procedures and forms can be also found in REN website. 

Moreover, it is also required the authenticated copy of the registration of electricity supplier 

issued by DGEG.  

Delivered the application, there is a set of events that may be compiled in the following figure:

At the same time, it will be generated another document related to the financial warranties, 

whose signature shall be certified by a lawyer or notary. For the purpose of deviations and 

additional costs associated with the GGS, the RES Cooperative must provide a financial 

warranty of € 50,000. Considering a loan of € 50,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, 

the annual cost for Coopérnico would be € 2,500. 

The warranty may increase due to changes in the load profile of any transmission system 

facility, production facility directly connected to the transmission system or that may directly 

influence on the functioning of the transmission system and any distribution or customer 

facilities directly connected to the transmission system. Moreover, the ability to control the 

deviation level, as well as the number of clients supplied by the RES Cooperative may also 

influence the amount of the financial warranty.  

 

5.5.2. Distribution network – EDP Distribuição 

Besides the access to the transmission network (becoming Market Agent within the GGS)[101],  

the RES Cooperative shall also celebrate a license agreement with the DSO operator, EDP 

Distribuição, which integrates general conditions approved by ERSE21, as well as particular 

conditions defined by the DSO.  

Whilst the particular conditions must be requested to the EDP Distribuição, in relation to the 

ERSE conditions they can be found in the Dispatch nº18899/2010 and in EDP Distribuição 

website [102].  

 

It is of outmost importance to understand the impossibility to carry out both agreements with 

REN and EDP Distribuição, simultaneously. That means to complete this final step, it is 

mandatory to have already fulfilled the registration as a Market Agent within the GGS, with the 

celebration of the accession agreement to the energy market information system.  

As in the previous point, in this case the RES Cooperative must be also in possession of the 

registration of electricity supplier issued by DGEG. 

 

Reading carefully the DSO’s particular conditions, it is defined another financial warranty of € 

50,000 that RES Cooperative must provide in order to fulfil the process. Once again, 

considering a loan of € 50,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, the annual cost for 

Coopérnico would be € 2,500. 

 

With all these documents (Figure 133), the RES Cooperative is in conditions to proceed to an 

agreement with EDP Distribuição in order to have access to RND. 

 

                                                      
21 This contract shall apply the rules contained in the legislation, regulations and other documents in 

force, namely: Regulation of network acess, trading regulation, tariff regulation, quality of service 

regulation, RNT and RND regulations, network operation regulations, the contract of adhesion for access 

the system services market, the manual of procedures of the GGS, guide for reading, metering and 

availability of data, and a protocol for exploration (when applicable)

Described and compiled all the steps and necessary requirements for a RES Cooperative to 

become a new electricity supplier in Portugal, it is now time to list the possible cases that the 

Cooperative has on the Figure 134. 

 

 

Figure 134. The different options available for the RES Cooperative to become an electricity supplier  

 

In relation to case 4, the RES Cooperative is just an intermediary of a company that already 

operates in the market. Through conditions well-defined in the contract, the RES Cooperative 

retails electricity in the name of others. However, within this last case there are two available 

options: The billing be, or not to be, made by the Cooperative itself.

As the intention is that the Cooperative logo appears in the electricity bill of the customer, as 

well as in the ERSE’s simulator, the only logical option is the billing be made by the RES 

Cooperative. 

 

 

Figure 135. Advantages and Disadvantages of each Case (*considering loan banks are granted) 

 

In relation to case 1,2 and 3 it was considered an annual operating cost for Coopérnico of € 

46,000 plus the € 41,000 every month to purchase in advance the required energy demand for 

the next market session. The cost of € 46,000 is divided in the annual cost with the ERP 

software platform (~ € 10,000/year) and the annual cost with staff (~ € 36,000/year, considering 

two person fully dedicated to the activity). 

Although at this moment there is the idea of all the necessary requirements to be a supplier of 

electricity in Portugal, in Coopérnico are the members who choose the path to be followed by

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

the Cooperative, regardless of the subject or activity. This time will be no different, which 

means the electricity retailing supply process will be also subject of consideration in short term.  

Thus, based on the advantages and disadvantages of each of the four possible cases (Figure 

135), members must choose the path that they consider to be the best for the Coopérnico’s 

electricity retailing supply process in accordance with their values, beliefs and what they think 

is the best for the future of the Cooperative. 

 

6. Conclusions 

The IEM is an European purpose since the early nineties, however today it is still far from being 

achieved. The end of 2014 is just around the corner, and it’s more than a certainty that the latest 

published deadline for the completion of the IEM will not be met, once again. 

Besides the obvious differences in the EU member’s approaches to the implementation of the 

European directives or the failure to prevent the established monopolies with regard to market 

entry, market exit and pricing, there are also other reasons for failure to create a unified, 

competitive European energy market, such as: 

 

? Deliberate government interference motivated by a desire to support the main players in 
each electricity market; 

? Lack of interest by dominant players or governments to build additional transmission 
lines to facilitate cross-border energy trade; 

? Weak enforcement of EU directives at country level. 

 

This means that somehow, the same economic and political reasons that led to deregulation and 

liberalisation of the European energy market are now preventing the IEM of being fully 

achieved. However, the path is already in its ending, and slowly the EU’s vision is now 

becoming a clear image. 

 

On the other hand, this long and evolutionary process of market liberalisation has also brought 

in the last decades new environmental, social and economic trends that are pushing Europe to 

urgently rethink the current energy system. Thus, supported by the raising awareness on climate 

changes and the introduction of RES policies, market volatility, the increasing energy prices as 

well as security of energy supply, “social enterprises” are emerging as new independent energy 

players, in a number of European countries.  

Believing in the transformation of the energy system of the past towards a decentralised energy 

model, the RES Cooperatives are democratising the energy sector in almost every areas. For 

instance, whilst the EU is just focused in the adoption and promotion of RES generation, in 

relation to the supply activity there are no incentives to the green energy supply yet. As always, 

the RES Cooperatives are already a step forward, and despite the non-existent incentives to fully 

supply customers with green energy, currently the RES Cooperatives, based just on their 

convictions and mission, are already a green option in their national electricity retail market 

supplying those who wish to, with green electricity. 

 

Besides the four case studies (The Co-operative Energy in the UK, EWS in Germany, Som 

Energia in Spain and Ecopower in Belgium), there are much more examples across Europe: 

Enercoop in France, GoiEner, Nosa Enerxía, EnerPlus and Zencer all from Spain, Greenpeace 

Energy in Germany or NLD Energie and DE Unie from Netherlands. 



Renewable Energy Cooperative in Portugal: Electricity retailing supply process 

 

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

183 

 

According with their feedback, the reasons why RES Cooperatives are becoming a solid 

alternative solution to the traditional energy companies are: 

 

? Electricity at reasonable prices and good service provided; 
? Low level of trust in the big energy suppliers; 
? Consumers can reduce their environmental impact (by relying on RES); 
? Contribution for a new energetic paradigm; 
? Bringing energy production and consumption to the local level;  
? Promoting local and economy development; 

 

Moreover, this work came with the conclusion that the two main causes behind the entry of the 

RES Cooperatives in the electricity retail market are the market opportunity and the non-

existence of an option more environmentally friendly that could contribute for a new sustainable 

energy model supported by the RES Cooperatives.  

Based on the experience shared by the RES Cooperatives, the work identified the main barriers 

that a RES Cooperative may face during its electricity retailing supply process, such as: 

 

? Legislative complexity; 
? Financial issues; 
? The difficulty to clarify details related to the legislation and the energy market; 
? Buying electricity in the organised energy market. 

 

Nevertheless, to overcome these possible obstacles it was suggested that in addition to qualities 

such as patience and perseverance, for instance the RES Cooperative shall have a clear 

marketing strategy, besides create partnerships with other entities, whether Cooperatives or 

public institutions, and seek the assistance of experts in the area. 

Finally, this study also came to the conclusion that an electricity retailing supply process is 

usually quite complex, which means that the RES Cooperative will not take less than half a year 

to complete.  However, from the moment the RES Cooperative has its offer in the national 

electricity market the consumer’s receptivity will be very positive, which will simultaneously 

boost the number of members of the Cooperative. 

The costs involved in the process can vary according to the method chosen by the RES 

Cooperative to operate in the organised energy market. Nevertheless, the experience tells that a 

value below € 50,000 will be enough for the RES Cooperative to start the activity of electricity 

retailing in Portugal. 

 

Considering the complexity of each European electricity system with all its particular features, 

including the difference between national legislations, as well as the cultural differences 

between nations, this work tried to assess the role and experiences that each one of the RES 

Cooperatives has faced in their own electricity supply market. Identified the positive and 

negative pratices that may influence the RES Cooperative’s process, at the moment it is possible 

to conclude Coopérnico has all it takes to become the first green electricity supplier in Portugal. 

Moreover, all the steps and requirements demanded by the Portuguese and Iberian legislation 

were compiled, including: 

 

? The registration of electricity supplier issued by DGEG;

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias                                                                                                                                                              

184 

 

? The license agreement with the DSO operator, which integrates general conditions 
approved by ERSE, as well as particular conditions defined by the DSO; 

? The status of Market Agent within the GGS; 
?  The available options to operate on the market managed by OMIE, buying and selling 

electricity. 

 

Based on such information, it was listed four possible cases, including the advantages and 

disadvantages of each one. Nevertheless, all in the end will transform the Coopérnico as the first 

green electricity supplier in Portugal. 

As in any other Cooperative, in Coopérnico the internal democratic control is based on the 

principle of “one person, one vote”. However, more important than the present, is the future and 

the strategy for the year ahead will be decided in the Coopérnico’s General Assembly in the 

mid-December 2014.  

Thus, independently of the voted path to be taken for the missing process, one thing is certain: 

from next year, the name of Coopérnico will appear in the electricity bill of many consumers in 

Portugal.

7. Annex 

Responses to inquiry: 

 

Question 2. 

 

 

? The Co-operative Energy: We entered the domestic energy supply market in 
December 2010. At the time, the United Kingdom had six major energy companies 

(British Gas, EDF, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE) who supplied over 98% of 

domestic customers. However consumer confidence in these companies was incredibly 

low, roughly in line with the banking industry. Customers were disengaged, didn’t 

understand an incredibly complicated market with thousands of different tariffs which 

were almost impossible to compare and had received consistent annual bill increases 

significantly higher than inflation. We entered the market with the intention of creating 

a genuine Co-operative alternative to these six companies, acting in an open and honest 

manner, inviting customers to join as members and have a say in how things are run, 

and heavily promoting the growth of sustainable, green electricity. 

? Enercoop: The core philosophy of Enercoop is to decentralize the energy market. In 
France the nuclear programme, that was established in the 1970’s in response to the oil 

crisis, has strongly biased centralized production, neglecting the opportunities of 

decentralized and RES production. Enercoop wants to change this system. The 

liberalization of the energy market in 2004 enabled new actors to enter and change this 

market. The idea behind the development of regional cooperatives was to bring the 

production and supply of energy back on the local scale and therefore create an 

Enercoop in every region in France, or at a more local scale. The cooperative model 

allows citizens to get involved in the governance and ownership of supply and 

production. This is important according to Julien Noé, Deputy Director of Enercoop: 

“Enercoop believes that the consumer should be closer to the production. This will 

enable consumers to get a better understanding of what kind of product he is consuming 

and how this is produced. People will use it more rationally when they are involved on a 

local scale. They also better understand the goal behind developing energy production 

when they get involved in the decision-making process.” Enercoop primarily operates 

as a supplier, meaning it buys energy from RES producers and sell it to its customers. 

The producers can be member of the cooperative. The production itself is not 

necessarily cooperatively owned, although Enercoop is increasingly investing in the 

field. 

? EWS: The decision of EWS to start supplying electricity was a natural consequence of 
the protest against nuclear power, and subsequent events. As the renounce of the use of 

nuclear energy itself was not enough to build up a new energetic paradigm, right after 

there were some questions that came out. The most important was: Is it possible to save 

energy in a relevant dimension without changing lifestyle?  

The first step was an energy saving competition across the village of Schönau. As it was 

not enough to satisfy the people's needs, the next step was to proof that a green

 Nelson André Galvão Ferreira Dias

electricity supply in the village was possible, including a new tariff structure. As the 

local electricity supplier at the time did not share people's intentions, the citizens 

decided to buy the electricity grid. 

? Greenpeace Energy: The liberalisation of energy markets towards in the late 1990s 
opened up the possibility to supply customers with green electricity. The environmental 

protection organisation Greenpeace e.V. used the opportunity to develop criteria for 

high quality green electricity and, through the campaign “electricity switch”, gathered 

supporters who demanded clean electricity. A public tender showed, however, that no 

supplier was able meet all criteria. Greenpeace e.V. in response took matters into their 

own hands and initiated in autumn 1999 the foundation of the cooperative Greenpeace 

Energy, an entity that is legally and financially independent of the environmental 

protection organisation. Greenpeace Energy started supplying customers with clean 

electricity according to the Greenpeace criteria on January 1st, 2000, and in 2001 

founded the subsidiary Planet energy, which constructs green power plants. 

? NLD Energie: There are a couple of reasons, but being most important is introducing a 
truly local company for promoting local sustainability in a way that helps participating 

local initiatives attaining their sustainable goals. 

? DE Unie: DE Unie (THE Union) was established to operate independently of the 
existing large energy companies. Local parties have different needs than the existing 

large companies. 

? Ecopower: The decision of Ecopower to start supplying electricity was initiated by its 
members at the general assembly in 2003 after the electricity market for private 

households in Flanders was liberalised. Ecopower then applied for a license to supply 

100% green electricity to its members. In 2003 Ecopower only had 2.975 shareholders. 

From then on the number of shareholders started growing rapidly. By 2008 we had 

16.815 members, by 2013 47.419 members. 

? Som Energia: The Cooperative identified an opportunity in the Spanish electricity 
market: the promoting of an democratic and clean energy model, based on RES, at the 

service of the people and that protects the environment. As a consequence, Som Energia 

started to give customers the chance to buy green electricity at a price equivalent to 

conventional electricity.  

? GoiEner: Our first intention was producing and after start into the electricity retail 
market. Spanish laws changed in 2012, just the year we started to think about how to 

start the cooperative. Producing was impossible so we went into the electricity retail 

market. No option. 

? Zencer: To provide consumers with real access to the liberalized electricity market, 
through a democratic formulated and environmentally sustainable. 

? EnerPlus: The fight against corruption and backdoor deals. 
? Nosa Enerxía: The governance their own power company , achieve 100% electricity , 

low level in trust in the big energy companies, seek a sustainable development, social 

empowerment,…

Question 6. 

 

 

? The Co-operative Energy: There is a huge amount of red tape and legislative and 
regulatory complexity that needs to be adhered to prior to being provided a supply 

license and completing Ofgems (the UKs regulator) controlled market entry process. 

We overcame this by recruiting an experience Regulation Manager who, along with our 

Group General Manager, oversaw the entire process to ensure we were fully compliant. 

Moreover, the company had the support of a larger Cooperative, The Midcounties Co-

operative. 

? Enercoop: I don’t know. 
? EWS: Learning from experts, learning by doing and through the anti-nuclear solidarity. 
? Greenpeace Energy: Greenpeace Energy was founded 15 years ago. It is difficult for 

us to answer this question as we didn't work for Greenpeace Energy then. What we 

know ist that Greenpeace Energy worked together with different service providers and 

benefitted from their knowledge and experience. 

? NLD Energie: By talking to knowledgeable people and working patiently on the 
development of the company. 

? DE Unie: Hard work, no sleep and perseverance. 
? Ecopower: Patience and perseverance. 
? Som Energia: Perseverance. 
? GoiEner: We got the know-how thanks to our market agent and the financial issues 

thanks to our cooperativists. And a lot of work made by our volunteers. 

? Zencer: It is difficult to specify in a few words, but the creation of our consumer 
cooperative has been an evolution of my professional experience in the technical field 

and management company. In the end all comes down to full dedication to an exciting 

project, studying and analysing the current regulations of the electricity sector and 

applying all our knowledge and of our partners in the project. Collaboration in a 

Cooperative Project is crucial for proper development. 

? EnerPlus: With help from other Cooperatives. 
? Nosa Enerxía: With the support of people, social economy organisations, public 

institutions and lot of work and dedication.

? The Co-operative Energy: We have found that in the UK the public have welcomed 
the introduction of Co-operative Energy and we have had a huge amount of interest and 

well-wishers. When entering a new industry it is important to get the right mix of senior 

management in the business, containing both experienced professionals from the energy 

industry and also from a co-operative background to ensure that the business is run 

differently to the other players in the industry. Stay true to the co-operative ethics and 

values and there will be a captive audience waiting to join. 

? Enercoop: Make sure there is no other existing offer (market study). Have a strong 
team of people carrying the project. Cooperate with other cooperatives (national and 

European level) to get their input on the process and have a full project behind the idea 

of being an electricity supplier, not just a business model if you want people to join the 

process. 

? EWS: Don’t talk and think too much, just start and convince your neighbours and 
friends to join the movement. Produce clean energy and don’t give your money to 

nuclear industry.  Cooperate with the municipality, have fun while working, believe in 

solidarity and create new ideas. 

? Greenpeace Energy: Do not only sell green energy, try to become a producer as well. 
Build new green power plants. Be an real alternative to the big energy companies and 

involve your cooperative members in the project. 

? NLD Energie: Think it through. We experience it to be a difficult market. You need to 
have a good marketing strategy, because only gaining early adopters is not enough. You 

need to gain scale to be viable as a company. 

? DE Unie: perseverance. 
? Ecopower: Big advantage to have a single cost per kWh because it makes people more 

aware of their energy consumption. People consider the consumption of their own 

sustainable energy more important than a financial return. Finally, there's a good chance 

that the number of shareholders will increase if you start supplying energy. 

? Som Energia: Just start, give same price and great service. 
? GoiEner: If you are going to be a Cooperative for all Portugal, and there are local 

smallest cooperatives, help them to develop. Don´t use a centralized model for retail 

electricity. Share the know-how with other cooperatives in Portugal and share the tools 

for that. We are sharing now the costs of the software platform we are developing with 

the other small cooperatives in Spain.  

? Zencer: Each market is different and the way of being and thinking of the people who 
compose it, so it's tricky to give you some advice about it. First I would advise to get in 

contact with other social economy companies or associations who share with you the 

goals set in your Cooperative (the union makes the strength), this being your natural 

market growth. Social networks play in this sense a great role, which should be 

exploited. Start slowly and retraining, initiating economic activity on a solid financial 

base and management, enabling partners to obtain from the outset the objectives 

promise. Finally, from our cooperative we offer you our support and advice from our 

experience in the electricity market and the beginning of a journey of collaboration 

between both cooperatives, such as your representation as agents in the market, if it is 

of your interest or collaboration on the joint development of projects of renewable 

energy generation. 

? EnerPlus: Just do it. 
? Nosa Enerxía: The cooperative needs to do an action and business plan and try to get a 

minimum of members to hold the project.
