resumo 
 

 

A transferência horizontal de genes permite a adaptação microbiana a nichos 
especiais, dos quais dois bons exemplos são a camada superficial do mar e a 
coluna de água. Os plasmídeos com gama alargada de hospedeiros (BHR), 
responsáveis pelo fluxo de material genético entre cromossomas bacterianos 
(inclusivamente entre microorganismos muito afastados filogeneticamente) têm 
um papel essencial na evolução das comunidades microbianas. Entre eles, os 
plasmídeos pertencendo ao grupo de incompatibilidade IncP-1 têm um 
interesse especial por causa da sua extraordinária flexibilidade na iniciação da 
replicação e da estabilidade na sua manutenção numa ampla gama de 
hospedeiros. Estes elementos genéticos móveis, além de constituírem 
ferramentas úteis na engenharia genética, representam uma grande fonte de 
genes que codificam para características tão significativas como a resistência 
a antibióticos e a degradação de xenobióticos. No entanto, a diversidade nesta 
família de plasmídeos BHR tem sido subestimada até agora: actualmente 
sabe-se da existência de cinco subgrupos divergentes, mas embora alguns 
plamídeos modelo tenham sido estudados ao detalhe, ainda há muito para 
investigar. 
Em trabalhos anteriores na Ria de Aveiro (costa NW de Portugal), foi feita a 
captura exógena de plasmídeos bem como o isolamento de bactérias 
potencialmente hospedeiras de plasmídeos endógenos. Neste trabalho, 
sequências de nucleótidos específicas foram amplificadas mediante reacções 
em cadeia da polimerase para determinar a presença de plasmídeos BHR. Os 
sete plasmídeos IncP-1 detectados, foram em primeiro lugarfilogeneticamente 
estudados. O alinhamento das sequências de nucleótidos de 281 pb que foram 
amplificadas e que correspondem a um fragmento do gene trfA (que codifica 
para uma proteína do início da replicaçao) sugeriu o estabelecimento de dois 
novos clusters situados filogeneticamente em dois subgrupos diferentes de 
IncP-1: IncP-1? e o recentemente descrito IncP-1?. Estes constituem os 
primeiros replicões IncP-1 provenientes de ambientes estuarinos a serem 
detectados e isolados. De seguida, uma comparação e caracterização 
preliminar genética e fenotípica foi realizada com os plasmídeos purificados, 
considerando a descrição já conhecida dos dois plasmídeos arquétipos 
evolutivamente mais próximos, pB10 e pKJK5. Assim, as análises de 
fragmentos de restrição, determinação da inibição do crescimento do 
hospedeiro na presença de mercúrio e ensaios de resistência a diferentes 
antibióticos ajudaram a compreender o elevado interesse que recai nestes 
plasmídeos revelando a diversidade fenotípica e genotípica. Uma completa 
descrição de qualquer destes novos plasmídeos pode ter una enorme 
importância ecológica, evolutiva e biotecnológica, incrementada pela sua 
procedência dum ambiente não clínico. Portanto este trabalho justifica um 
estudo em maior profundidade destes replicões promíscuos.

abstract 

 
The horizontal gene transfer allows microbial adaptation to special niches, from 
which the sea-surface microlayer or the subsurface waters in estuarine 
environments might be good examples. Broad host range plasmids, 
responsible for the reshuffling of genetic material between bacterial 
chromosomes (even amongst distantly related microorganims), play an 
essential role on the evolution and diversity of microbial communities. Among 
them, the incompatibility group IncP-1 plasmids have a special interest due to 
their extraordinary flexibility in the replication initiation and stable maintenance 
in such a wide spectrum of hosts. These mobile genetic elements, in addition to 
the helpful genetic engineering tools they mean, represent a great source of 
potentially useful genes encoding for traits as significant as antibiotic resistance 
or xenobiotic degradation. Nevertheless, the diversity of this family of BHR 
plasmids has been underestimated until recently: it is currently known to have 
five divergent sub-groups, but although some prototype plasmids have been 
studied in great detail, there is still much left to research.  
In previous investigations exogenous plasmid capture was carried out as well 
as putative endogenous plasmid bacterial hosts isolated in the Ria de Aveiro 
lagoon (NW coast of Portugal). In this work, polymerase chain reactions were 
developed to amplify specific nucleotide sequences and determine BHR 
plasmids presence. From a bioinformatical approach, the seven IncP-1 
plasmids detected were firstly phylogenetically studied. The alignment of the 
amplified 281 bp nucleotide sequences corresponding to a fragment of the 
replication initiation protein encoding gene trfA suggested the formation of two 
novel clusters belonging to two different IncP-1 plasmid subgroups: IncP-1? 
and the lately described IncP-1?. Additionally, these represent the first 
estuarine IncP-1 replicons to be detected and isolated. Then a preliminary 
genetic and phenotypic comparison was performed with the purified plasmids, 
by taking into account the known description of the evolutionary closest 
models, pB10 and pKJK5. That way, restriction fragment analysis as well as 
antibiotic and mercury resistance determination assays helped to comprehend 
the high significance falling on the captured plasmids by revealing the genetic 
and phenotypic diversity. A whole description of any of these novel plasmids 
may have a huge ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological importance, 
even more due to its precedence from a non-clinical environment. Therefore 
this work justifies further studies on these promiscuous replicons.

1. Introduction 

1.1 Aquatic environments and microbial communities 

The specific physical habitat or location of a microorganism is its 

microenvironment. There, the fluxes and gradients of required oxidants, reductants, and 

nutrients as well as waste products create a unique niche. However, the microorganisms 

can create their own microenvironments and niches. When microbial growth happens on 

surfaces, such as in freshwater and marine environments, biofilms are formed (Prescott et 

al., 2002b). 

The physical frontier between the ocean and the atmosphere is the sea-surface 

microlayer (SML). This interface between the sea and the air is considered to be the 

around 1mm-top layer of the ocean (the layer of 10-100 µm-top was employed in this 

research). If compared with subsurface water (SSW) it is physical-chemically distinct and 

characteristically enriched with biogenic organic compounds, such as lipids, proteins and 

polysaccharides. That stratification makes the SML stable enough to exist at typical 

oceanic wind conditions (Wurl et al., 2009). The main point is that the SML could be made 

up of gel particles, with similar microbiological and biogeochemical characteristics. Some 

studies showed an enrichment of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) in the SML (Wurl 

et al. 2008). TEPs are normally formed in surface waters from the coagulation of biogenic 

polysaccharides; chiefly those produced by phytoplankton, and are some of the most 

ubiquitous gel particles in the marine environment. They are critical in the formation of 

marine aggregates, acting as the binding matrix or ‘glue’ that holds the aggregate together 

(Verdugo et al., 2004).  

The presence of the surface film and surface tension properties turn the SML into a 

unique habitat. Bacterial communities that are present in the SML are known as the 

bacterioneuston. Surface films also take place on all water bodies, marine, estuarine and 

freshwater, sometimes as visible slicks. The microbial communities established in the 

SSW are less dense and less structured, and constitute what is called the bacterioplancton 

(Cunliffe et al., 2009a). 

The aggregation of bacterial cells seen in some studies (Franklin et al., 2005; 

Cunliffe et al., 2009a) most likely takes place in the SML, with bacterial cells attached to 



7 

 

the TEP-based gel particles reported by Wurl and Holmes (2008). It has been proposed 

that this enrichment on attached biofilm-growing cells is the main cause of the distinct 

properties of bacterioneuston. If, as suggested by Sieburth (1983), the SML is a gelatinous 

film in which prevails biofilm-growing cells, then biological processes that occur in bacterial 

communities and that are favored when bacterial cells are in close proximity, such as 

horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and quorum sensing, could be more frequent. The large 

specific microbiological diversity supposed to occur in this unique ecological niche 

supports a much broader molecular and functional diversities. Therefore, its subsequently 

possible biotechnological value makes its investigation interesting. Nonetheless, studies 

concerning the molecular microbial ecology of the SML started only recently (Cunliffe et 

al., 2009a). 

 

1.2 Bacterial plasmids and their importance in shaping the properties of 

bacterial communities. 

Nowadays there is evidence that plasmids and transposable elements can move 

genetic material between bacterial chromosomes to cause rapid changes in genomes and 

drastically alter phenotypes (Prescott et al., 2002a). The prokaryotic horizontal gene pool 

(HGP), defined as the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their encoded genes 

(Thomas, 2000b), plays a vital and essential role in the evolution and adaptation of 

individual microorganisms and microbial communities by generating genetic variations in 

bacteria (reviewed in Arber, 2000). Like that, the sequencing of complete bacterial 

genomes has clearly shown that a large proportion of their genetic diversity have been 

acquired by HGT and come from distantly related microorganisms. This evidence has 

been derived from nucleotide sequence comparisons as well as from atypical nucleotide 

composition (guanine + cytosine content) of large genomic regions or different patterns of 

codon usage of some genes (Ochman et al., 2000). 

Huge efforts have been carried out to catalogue, characterize, and exploit the 

different aspects of the enormous biodiversity of microorganisms in every natural habitat. 

In contrast, there is an undeveloped understanding of the abundance, distribution and 

molecular diversity of MGEs extant in the HGP occurring in most marine, freshwater, and 

many terrestrial microbial communities (Sobecky, 2002). Probably that is due to the fact 



8 

 

that the importance of the HGT in bacterial persistence, diversity and evolution is less 

widely appreciated (Thomas, 2000b). The first time its significance was accepted match up 

with the moment when multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens emerged, since MGE played 

a primary role in the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and 

allowed bacterial populations to rapidly adapt to a strong selective pressure. Additionally, 

plasmid mediated conjugation is probably one of the most frequent mechanisms of HGT 

(Sota et al., 2008), which explain the particular interest falling on this kind of MGE. 

Because of this reshuffling of genes between bacterial cells, populations and 

communities that makes plasmids remarkably influent in ecological processes, the study of 

plasmid ecology and transfer together with environmental microbiology and microbial 

ecology can provide essential information on plasmid evolution. The evolutionary change 

affects plasmids in the same way as their host bacteria so plasmids have been regarded 

as units of evolution. In addition, retrospective studies offer a means to infer evolutionary 

relationships directly from plasmids isolated from geographically similar or remote 

locations (Sobecky, 2002; Pickup et al., 1996). 

Thus, since plasmids represent a large genetic resource of bacterial diversity, 

research on plasmid distribution, evolutionary relationships, and diversity of plasmids in 

relation to the natural selection pressures is required in order to comprehend the role they 

play in the flow of genetic information in natural bacterial communities (Dahlberg et al., 

1997; Harada et al., 2006). 

Furthermore, the HGT is also manifested in the “plasmids backbones” where 

recombination within homologous regions of closely related plasmids can be noticed. 

Since these regions are responsible for replication, maintenance, and plasmid transfer, 

these recombination events play a key role in increasing or reducing the host range of 

these plasmids. This could be imperative as much with regard to the species which could 

obtain new genetic traits as because it sets the genetic backgrounds from which plasmids 

can purchase new traits (Lipps et al., 2008). 

Most of the actual knowledge of HGT is related to plasmids occurring in bacteria of 

medical and agricultural importance. These plasmids correspond to a limited collection of 

replicons that surely are not representative of the plasmid populations occurring in every 

environment.  



9 

 

Several plasmid types present in strains isolated from clinical environments can be 

also found in environmental samples such as manure slurries or marine sediments; 

however a large part of the plasmids isolated from bacterial strains of natural environments 

contain replication and incompatibility regions unrelated to those of the known groups of 

plasmids traditionally found associated to clinical environments. This justifies further 

evaluation of the prevalence, diversity and evolution of plasmids, especially in nonclinical 

environments (Thomas, 2000b; Sobecky, 2002; Gstalder et al., 2003). 

 

1.3 The study of plasmids and its biotechnological significance 

A vast pool of traits usually associated with plasmids rather than chromosomes 

confer advantages which allow bacterial communities to evolve, adapt to selective 

pressure and colonize certain habitats. Some examples of those traits are mentioned in 

the table I (Thomas, 2000b). These kind of habitats, among which a representative case is 

the SML, due to their extreme characteristics or to the way they bring diverse bacterial 

species together, may represent a good source of new plasmids or of old plasmid 

skeletons carrying new recombined segments. Ecological studies that contribute to a 

deeper knowledge on the distribution of different types of plasmids and their hosts are 

important in defining which environments are better to exploit, avoiding the inconvenient of 

blind extensive screenings. 

The emergence of large multidrug resistance plasmids due to the strong selective 

pressure caused by antimicrobial chemotherapy is threatening to reverse development in 

the treatment of infectious diseases by augmenting human pathogens resistance to 

antimicrobial agents (Tauch et al., 2003; Tennstedt et al., 2005; Schlüter et al., 2007). 

Nevertheless, in addition to the clearly imperative significance of increasing the knowledge 

about resistance genes to clinically relevant antimicrobial drugs, there is also a huge 

interest in further study other kinds of functions carried by plasmids. 

A large number of the xenobiotics that have been introduced to the environment at 

modern society are recalcitrant. Catabolic plasmids and their host strains have an 

enormous environmental and ecological significance due to their potential application for 

environmental biotechnology. Different catabolic pathways may be either chromosomally 

or plasmid-encoded (Sayler et al., 1990). However, ecologically, plasmid-encoded 



10 

 

pathways are beneficial because they provide genetically flexible systems and can be 

maintained in the population and transferred between bacterial species, without the need 

of technological support. 

In addition to the genes that encode the degradation of man-made organic 

compounds, those responsible for the metabolism of naturally occurring pollutants are also 

assumed to be often located on plasmids or other mobile elements (Top et al., 2002).  

Besides, since some accessory genes on these plasmids have no homologues and 

cannot be assigned a function, it is not known yet what phenotypes other than the well-

known resistance and degradation functions may be encoded by certain plasmids (Sen et 

al., 2010). In this context, plasmids seem to be an extraordinary reservoir of molecular 

determinants of diverse functions and the technological potential of this reservoir deserves 

to be exploited. 

Otherwise, plasmids are powerful vectors of recombinant DNA, allowing its spread 

in the environment. Its biotechnological importance in this respect lies in its utility as 

cloning vectors or vehicles of protein expression in different bacterial hosts. A complete 

knowledge of the distribution, maintenance, recombination, and conjugation of BHR 

plasmids is consequently essential to evaluate the risk associated with the release of 

recombinant DNA into the environment (Drönen et al., 1998; Gstalder et al., 2003). 

As a conclusion it could be stated that plasmids may have increasingly important 

biotechnological applications, both respect to the large source of novel traits MGE 

represent and as useful tools in genetic engineering.  Anyway, the first step in researching 

these potential utilities, as referred before, is further studying plasmid characterization, 

diversity and evolution.

1.4 Plasmid biology 

1.4.1 Molecular structure of plasmids 

Plasmids can be considered as being made up of two distinct regions: the 

‘‘backbone” region, which encodes functions involved in replication, transfer, and 



12 

 

Fig 1. Schematical structures of IncP-1 and IncQ plasmids. The white area represents the 

regions for plasmid replication and control; the grey one, those genes involved in plasmid 

transfer (or mobilization); black symbolize the accessory genes (Lipps, 2008). 

maintenance and control of the plasmid; and the ‘‘accessory” region consisting of genes 

that may confer specific beneficial traits to the bacterial host (Thomas, 2000a).  

In any case, plasmids are not at all static genomes, but instead are plastic genetic 

mosaics that have evolved over time through the iterative acquisition of various 

transposons, integrons, gene cassettes, genomic islands and insertion sequences, which 

are almost always associated with accessory genes, placing them in one or two sites 

between essential DNA fragments i.e., between oriV (the origin of vegetative replication), 

and trfA (a  gene for plasmid replication) and/or between the two transfer operons that 

encode mating-pair formation and plasmid transfer trb and tra. Plasmids with almost 

identical backbones can have entirely different accessory genes (Lipps et al., 2008; Sen et 

al., 2010; Schlüter et al., 2007). Another essential gene that should be named is oriT, the 

origin of plasmid transfer. Mob proteins in mobilizable plasmids are necessary to convert 

the plasmids into the transferable form. 

 

 

 

However, plasmids without such functional elements, these accessory elements, 

have also been described (Kamachi et al., 2006). 

In other respects, plasmids are known to have complex recombinational histories. 

Some survival functions depend on just one genetic locus, but most depend on at least 



13 

 

two. The first sorts of modules to emerge would probably have consisted of interdependent 

functions but, at the same time, independent but mutually beneficial functions probably 

became clustered, as reviewed in Thomas (2000a). 

1.4.2 Incompatibility groups and BHR plasmids. 

Plasmid classification has been originally based in a property inherent in them, 

which is in addition a manifestation of relatedness (since it is the sharing of common 

elements related to plasmid control of replication and partition). Incompatibility is the 

inability of two plasmids to be maintained stably in the same cell line (Couturier et al., 

1988). Two plasmids which cannot stay in the same cell belong to the same incompatibility 

group. 

Four of these incompatibility groups are considered to be broad-host-range (BHR) 

plasmids. In spite of the difficulty of determining the host range of a plasmid, as transfer 

can be tested experimentally only between hosts representing a minute fraction of the 

bacterial world, Szpirer and co-workers (1999) proposed, in an attempt to define BHR, that 

plasmids which can transfer and replicate in bacterial species from at least two branches 

of the Proteobacteria should be viewed as BHR plasmids. Then the conjugative IncP, IncN 

and IncW, plasmids and the mobilizable IncQ plasmids are regarded as having BHR 

(Gstalder et al., 2003).  

The role of BHR plasmids is remarkable when speaking about interspecies gene 

exchange since they are most likely the single intermediaries of HGT between distantly 

related bacterial hosts. IncQ plasmids have the broadest host-range of all of them in gram 

negative bacteria, followed of those of the group IncP-1 (based in the Pseudomonas 

classification system). Apart from spreading genes across taxonomically distant species by 

conjugative transfer, BHR plasmids can partially integrate into the recipient chromosome, 

or mobilize non-conjugative vectors with a wider host range (Lipps, 2008). They can also 

retromobilize or retrotransfer i.e., capturing genes or non-self-transmissible plasmids from 

host in which they cannot replicate (Szpirer et al., 1999). All these reasons make research

1.5 The group of IncP-1 plasmids 

The distinctive characteristic of low copy number plasmids belonging to the 

incompatibility group IncP-1 is the central control operon coding for at least three global 

regulators. It gives them flexibility in the replication initiation, multiple stability mechanisms 

and coordinates regulation of all plasmid backbone functions, providing them with 

enormous adaptability and stable maintenance in such a wide spectrum of hosts. This 

ability of replicating and being stably maintained in almost all Gram-negative bacteria as 

well as being transferred by conjugation to Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and eukaryotic 

cell lines justifies the particular interest that fall on IncP-1 plasmids (Adamczyk et al., 2003; 

Waters, 2001; Harada et al., 2006). 

In spite of the high infection transfer rates the IncP-1 plasmids have, horizontal 

transfer is not enough for them to be maintained as genetic parasites, as they are a 

burden to their host, so that they need to carry at least occasionally advantageous traits to 

be maintained in bacterial communities. Consequently, the majority of the IncP-1 plasmids 

have large regions with acquired genes encoding traits which occasionally might augment 

the fitness of the bacterial host (Bergstrom et al., 2000). 

It appears that the IncP-1 backbone can either carry antibiotic-resistance 

determinants or degradative operons but to the best of our knowledge, a plasmid that 

carries both types of genes (antibiotic-resistance and degradative genes) has not yet been 

identified (Schlüter et al., 2003). 

Regardless of the large range of accessory elements among IncP-1 plasmids, they 

may be phylogenetically grouped into a small number of distinct subgroups based on their 

backbone sequences. As a result, during the last years, phylogenetic analysis of the 

281bp-region of the replication gene trfA, as well as a few other essential backbone genes 

regions, has allowed the IncP-1 plasmid group to be classified into five main phylogenetic 

sub-groups: IncP-1?, -?, -?, -? and -? (Sen et al., 2010; Bahl et al., 2009).  

The ? and ? subgroups constitute the two first recognized subgroups and have 

been extensively studied. The ? and ? subgroups were defined only based on a 

phylogenetic analysis of their backbone genes. Later, three IncP-1 ? and one IncP-1 ? 

plasmids were completely sequenced and described (Xia et al., 1998; Vedler et al., 2004; 

Sen et al., 2010; Hill et al., 1992). The presence of a fifth subgroup, ?, was recently 



15 

 

suggested by Bahl (2007) consisting of pEMT3 (from which just a fragment is known) and 

pKJK5 that has been completely sequenced (Gstalder et al., 2003; Top et al., 1995; Bahl 

et al., 2007).  

In the table II some information about the completly sequenced IncP-1 plasmids 

that represent the full known diversity within this 281 bp-region of the trfA gene is shown.

1.5.1 Genetic and phenotypic characterization of IncP-1 plasmids 

Plasmid comparison and characterization has often been studied through 

restriction fragment analyses. There are two important practical aspects to take into 

account: the first one is the quality of the plasmid DNA, because the analysis may be 

impaired by partial digest; the second one is the correct selection of the most suitable 

restriction endonuclease useful to generate appropriate restriction fragment length 

polymorphism (RFLP) patters, which depends on the plasmid sequence. 

Studies concerning the heterologous DNA encoding certain phenotypic traits are of 

limited value for plasmid classification in its strict sense, since identical transposons can 

occur on different nonrelated plasmids. Nevertheless, research on these accessory 

functions is essential to determine the ecological role of plasmids and improve the 

knowledge about its evolution as a consequence of the responses to environmental 

stresses. Consequently, the great importance of heterologous DNA makes it be included in 

the general process for plasmid classification (Tsäpe, 1994; Thomas, 2000b). 

 

1.6 Methodological considerations 

Studies in such specific environments as is the case of the SML suppose to play 

special attention to some difficulties they involve, by establishing singular strategies and 

methodological approaches as appropriate as possible. The sample collection obtained 

may vary accordingly to the sampling method and strategy used and that has to be 

considered. That is the case, for instance, of sampling the SML or the SSW.  

1.6.1 Methods of sample harvest  

The SSW and even more the SML in the natural environment are submitted to 

temporal variations at a given place. This temporal and spatial variability of the samples 

has to be taken into account when analyzing the presence of plasmids in bacteria from 

environments such as surface waters. The quantity of samples should be a compromise 

between statistical requirements and practical considerations; the time between sampling, 

sample processing and analysis should be on the shortest possible way to circumvent 

shifts in the microbial populations and their activity and the number of parameters to be 



19 

 

analyzed should be the highest to increase the impact of spatial and temporal SML 

heterogeneity on the final results. In addition, natural turbulences may disturb the sampling 

work. The objective is to attain the closest biological composition of the sample to the 

original distribution in the SML that can be possible (Agogué et al., 2004; Thomas, 2000b) 

The SML sampling techniques used may be therefore the key issue, since different 

sampling approaches will represent different depths of the SML, thus influencing the 

samples composition collected. Also, some methods may be biased toward specific cell 

types, determining this way the results of the research. Consequently, it is essential to 

carry out a complete comparison of all SML sampling methods utilized, especially when 

using molecular tools to analyze the microbial ecology of these samples (Cunliffe et al., 

2009a). 

The most common samplers are the mesh screens (MS), glass plates (GP), 

hydrophobic (PTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene) and hydrophilic (PC, polycarbonate) 

membranes (Cunliffe et al., 2009b). Employing these methods bacterial community 

structures collected in the SML and in SSW can be compared. However, the question of 

the most suitable method of sampling the SML is far from being answered (Agogué et al., 

2004; Cunliffe et al., 2009b). 

1.6.2 Methods to carry out the plasmid isolation 

The determination of the distribution of plasmids in microbial communities has 

traditionally been carried out with the initial cultivation of bacterial hosts, with or without the 

use of selective media types, for the screening and confirmation of plasmids, which is the 

so called endogenous isolation (Sobecky, 2002). 

On the flipside, the small proportion of bacteria accessible to cultivation techniques 

explains the lack of information on the incidence and abundance of plasmids in the natural 

environment. In addition, culturable bacteria are known to respond to environmental stress 

by the formation of viable but nonculturable cells (Roszack et al., 1987). 

Conventionally numerous procedures employing a variety of cell lysis and 

extraction conditions and different commercial extraction kits have been used in the 

plasmid isolation from culturable bacterial hosts; more recently, methods to isolate 

plasmids independently from the culturability of their original hosts have become available 



20 

 

(Bale et al., 1987). This alternative method, known as exogenous isolation, consists on 

“capturing” plasmids directly from the bacterial community via mating with a selectable 

recipient strain. In its two variations, named bi- and tri-parental isolation, it is required that 

the captured plasmid(s) either be self-transferable or mobilizable and subsequently able to 

replicate and express (selectable) plasmid-encoded genes in the recipient host (Sobecky, 

2002). 

Another way of plasmid detection has been established, the screening of 

environmental DNA. It consists on directly extracting the whole nucleic acids from 

environmental samples, combined with the amplification of specific plasmid sequences, 

which is facilitated by the development of DNA probes and PCR primers targeted to 

conserved plasmid replication and transfer regions (Sobecky, 2002; Thomas, 2000b). 

However this approach was not used in the present study so it won’t be longer explained. 

This allows to improve the knowledge about the plasmid distribution in different places, an 

ecological approach that is, as referred before, essential to focus our research in 

potentially interesting environments where plasmid isolation strategies should be used. 

1.6.3 Phenotypic traits for plasmids isolation. 

One of the most toxic heavy metals that can be found in the environment, both due 

to geological processes and anthropogenic activities, is mercury. Molecular analysis has 

revealed a huge variety of genes encoding resistance to mercury ions which are reported 

to occur on a large range of plasmids belonging to various incompatibility groups, 

contributing that way to bacterial adaptability and reflecting at the same time 

environmental stresses (Smalla et al., 2006).  

Since tetracycline was the first broad spectrum antibiotic with widespread usage in 

the treatment of diseases, resistance to tetracycline rapidly emerged. Presently, at least 17 

different genes conferring tetracycline resistance are known and believed to come from 

many different ecosystems bacterial communities (Thomas, 2000b). 

The known habitual presence of mercury or tetracycline resistance genes in 

plasmids leads to their use as selective markers to detect or capture plasmids from natural 

environments by means of the selective isolation of their bacterial hosts. 



21 

 

Additionally, the frequent correlation between mercury resistance genes and self-

transmissible plasmids, as well as the common genetically link of antibiotic resistance 

genes to heavy-metal resistance genes, adaptation to mercury pollution may lead the 

spreading of antibiotic resistance genes throughout the bacterial community (Rasmussen 

et al., 1998). That adds significance to a deeper study on that kind of plasmids. 



22 

 

2. Objectives 

Knowing that BHR plasmids may be gene carriers that allow bacterial adaptation to 

certain special conditions by carrying resistance, degradative or another kind of genes, it is 

our premise that these genes can have high biotechnological applications and those MGE 

should be consequently explored.  

As referred before, ecological and evolutionary approaches are essential to 

understand plasmid influence on the flow of genetic information in bacterial communities. 

Knowledge on the distribution of different types of plasmids and their hosts is also 

important in defining which environments are more interesting to exploit and have more 

likely attractive results. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon, due to their definite characteristics and 

to their special microbial community, may show an important source of new plasmids or of 

old plasmid skeletons carrying new recombined segments. 

Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the presence of BHR plasmids as 

well as the diversity of IncP-1 plasmid sequences in the plasmids captured from different 

places of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon and evaluate their phylogenetic relationship together 

with well characterized IncP-1 plasmids. 

Another target of this thesis is a preliminary phenotypic and genetic 

characterization of the plasmids obtained in order to discuss and justify further research 

and whole replicons sequencing, both due to potential application in genetic engineering 

as cloning vectors or as vehicles for protein expression and because of the possible 

usefulness that the knowledge about some genes contained into it, like, for example, 

antibiotic or heavy metal resistance genes, may has.

3. Materials and methods 

3.1 Sample characterization  

Samples were collected throughout 2008 and 2009 from three 

contrasting aquatic environments of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, in the 

NW coast of Portugal. These sites were different as for salinity, 

temperature and anthropogenic pressures (run-off from agriculture 

[1.-Costa Nova-CN], port activities [2.-Cais do Sporting-CS] and 

industry [3.-Cais do Chegado-CC]). In each sampling site, glass plate 

method was employed to harvest samples from the SML and a flask 

submerged at a depth of 40 cm was used to gather samples from the 

SSW (Ramos, 2009; Oliveira et al., 2009). 

On one hand, in order to determine the BHR plasmid 

distribution by endogenous isolation, the culturable bacterial fraction 

was analyzed. Right through a previous research investigation 

(Ramos, 2009) the bacterial strains harvested had been cultured and 

isolated, resulting in 402 bacterial isolates, 198 from SML and 204 

from SSW. 

On the other hand, a cultivation-independent approach was carried out by using 

Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and Escherichia coli CV601 as recipient strains to capture 

plasmids by conjugation. The 79 transconjugants obtained (through the selective markers 

ampiciline, tetracycline and mercuric chloride) were confirmed by repetitive extragenic 

palindromic polymerase chain reaction genomic fingerprints method in a preceding work 

(Oliveira et al., 2009) in which also the presence of plasmids belonging to the 

incompatibility groups IncN, IncQ and IncW were tested without any positive result. 

 

3.2 BHR incompatibility group testing 

In this work, the PCR amplification of nucleotide sequences of specific replicons of 

plasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups W, N and Q and to the incP-1 subgroups 

was performed in order to detect the presence of BHR plasmids in the bacterial isolates 



24 

 

representative from SML and SSW. Regarding the transconjugants, PCR amplifications of 

nucleotide sequences of specific replicons was carried out for the incP-1 incompatibility 

sub-groups. 

All PCR reactions were carried out either on a Bio-Rad iCycler Thermal Cycler 

(Bio-Rad) or on a Bio-Rad MyCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). 

The detection of endogenous plasmids by PCR was performed using total DNA 

extracted from the bacterial isolates with the Silica bead DNA extraction Kit (Fermentas, 

K0513) as DNA template. Mixtures of the total DNA of each set of 5 bacterial isolates were 

prepared. After confirming the success of such DNA template dilutions, every mixture was 

employed as one unique sample for the screening procedure. On the other hand, IncP-1 

PCR testing for the 79 transconjugants was carried out. Bacterial suspensions made up by 

dipping a tiny amount of fresh culture into 20 µl of sterile distilled water were employed, in 

this case, as DNA template. 

Three different degenerative consensus primer pairs developed by Bahl and co-

workers (2009) were used for the amplification of the 281 bp homologous fragments from 

the gene trfA (which encode the replication initiation protein) from plasmids belonging to 

different IncP-1 subgroups. Primers, as well as positive controls, are described in tables III 

and IV, respectively. The reaction mixture consisted in: 1x phusion HF Buffer (Promega); 

2,5 mM MgCl2 (Promega); 200 µM dNTP Mix (Bioron); 5% DMSO (Dimethylesulfoxide, 

Analitical Grade - EuroBio); 0,5 µM each primer; 1 U/µl Taq polymerase (Promega); 1 µl of 

template DNA in a 25 µl PCR reaction mixture. The PCR cycle conditions are described in 

table V.  

As for IncQ, IncN and IncW plasmids detection, methodology and primers based 

on these developed by Gotz and co-workers (1996) were used. Every PCR mixture 

contained 1x phusion HF Buffer (Promega); 3,75 mM MgCl2 (Promega); 200 µM dNTP Mix 

(Bioron) for IncQ_oriV and 160 µM for IncN_rep and IncW_oriT; 2 % DMSO 

(Dimethylesulfoxide, Analitical Grade - EuroBio, France); 0,8 µM each primer; 1 U/µl Taq 

polymerase (Promega); 1µl of template DNA up to 25 µl PCR reaction mixtures. Primers, 

positive controls and PCR cycle conditions are described in tables III, IV and V, 

respectively.

3.3 PCR amplification products detection: electrophoresis and dot-blot 

hybridization 

The PCR amplification products corresponding to IncP-1 plasmid specific 

sequences were separated on a 1.5% agarose (Lonza) gel in TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA, 

5Prime) buffer at 80V during 70 minutes. Either GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas) 

or GeneRuler 100bp DNA Ladder Plus, ready-to-use (Fermentas) were loaded in all gels 

as molecular weight markers. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and banding 

patterns were visualized by using a Molecular Imager FXTM system (Bio-Rad 

Laboratories).  

Dot-blot hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled PCR-derived probes from each 

IncQ, IncN and IncW templates, was employed, by using the DIG Nucleic Acid Detection 

Kit (Roche), to carry out the detection of the correspondent PCR amplification products. 

The compositions of all the solutions used in the procedure are described in table VI.

Detailed protocol: 

- The DNA from PCR reactions was denatured by mixing 20 µl of every PCR product with 2 

µl of NaOH 0.5 N and incubating at 50ºC for 5 minutes. 

- 6 µl of standard sodium citrate (SSC) 20 X were added to every sample to neutralize them. 

- The DNA transference to a previously soaked in SSC 20X positively charged nylon transfer 

membrane (Amersham Hybond –N+, GE Heathcare) was performed under vacuum at 50 

mm Hg, by using a VacuGene Pump (VacuGene XL, Pharmacia Biotech) as vacuum 

blotting System.   

- Dot blotted nucleic acid was UV cross-linked to the nylon membrane during 5 minutes. 

- The PersonalHyb hybridization oven (Stratagene) with the pre-heated at the same 

temperature pre-hybridation solution was employed to carry out the pre-hybridization for 2 

hours at 42ºC. 

- The probes (made up through the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit, Roche) were heated at 

68ºC for 10 minutes to allow the DNA to dissociate. 

- The hybridization tubes with the membranes and the hybridization solution (containing each 

one the correspondent probes) were incubated at 42ºC for 16 hours. 

- The membranes were washed several times (twice with wash solution I for 5 minutes at 

room temperature, with wash solution II for 15 minutes at 42ºC and maleic acid buffer for 5 

minutes at 42ºC), blocked (blocking solution for 30 minutes at the room temperature) and 

incubate with the antibody solution (the conjugate DIG-alkaline phosphatase in dissolved in 

blocking solution) for exactly 30 minutes at the room temperature. 

- After washing (maleic acid buffer for 15 minutes at the room temperature) and equilibrating 

(detection buffer for 5 minutes at the room temperature), the membranes were placed on a 

previously prepared tray in a dark environment (without shaking). 

- The chromogenic detection began when the membranes where soaked in the detection 

solution. Revealing lasted two hours and the reaction was stopped with abundant distilled 

water.

3.4 DNA sequencing of PCR products and sequence analysis 

The PCR products obtained from the amplification of the nucleotide sequences 

from specific replicons belonging to the IncP-1incompatibility subgroups were purified with 

a slightly modified JETQUICK PCR Purification Protocol (Genomed). The DNA elution was 

performed by applying 20 µl of sterile distilled water at 65ºC. 

 The purified amplicons were sequenced through the chain termination method 

(Sanger et al., 1977) by the company StabVida. Then, in order to determine their closest 

phylogenetic relatives the BLAST software (Altschul et al., 1997) were used to compare 

the obtained sequences with known sequences. Sequences were aligned with reference 

taxa within the sequence databases using the CLUSTALW2 program (Larkin et al., 2007).  

Finally neighbor-joining trees based on the distance parameter were constructed 

using the PAUP version4.0b10 program (Swofford, 2003). Bootstrap values from 1000 

replicates were also acquired and shown as percentages. 

 

3.5 Plasmid DNA isolation and purification  

With the purpose of further characterizing the detected BHR plasmids, the Qiagen 

plasmid Mini Kit was employed to perform the plasmid DNA purification. Extraction was

carried out following the manufacturers instructions with adaptations described below. The 

compositions of the solutions required in this procedure are described in table VII. 

Detailed protocol: 

- Starter cultures of LB medium (Miller, Merck) containing the appropriate selective markers 

(30 µg/ml for tetracycline and 25 µg/ml for mercury chloride) were inoculated with single 

colonies picked from fresh streaked plates of the transconjugants harboring the detected 

plasmids and incubated overnight at 28°C with shaking of approximately 165 rpm. 

- The bacterial cells from culture volumes of 25 ml were harvested by centrifugation (4500 

rpm, 7 minutes, 4°C). 

- Each pellet was ressuspended with 4 ml of Buffer P1. 

- The lysis of the cells was favored by adding 4 ml of Buffer P2, mixing thoroughly and 

incubating for exactly 5 minutes at room temperature. 

- To neutralize, 4 ml of pre-chilled Buffer P3 were added, starting immediately the incubation 

on ice for at least 15 minutes. 

- Centrifugation (13000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) was carried out twice in order to eliminate 

unwanted cell material. 

- The clear lysate (the supernatant) containing DNA was kept and split into two equal 

fractions to avoid subsequently over-loading the low capacity column.  

- Both fractions of DNA were precipitated by adding 1 volume of room temperature 

isopropanol. 

- Centrifugation at 13000 rpm and 4°C for 30 minutes made unwanted metabolites such as 

proteins and lipopolysaccharides to be removed. At this time, one of the fractions 

corresponding to each sample was used to continue the protocol, while plasmid from the 

second one was kept at 4ºC to be purified afterwards by equilibrating again the same 

column and following this instructions from here on. 

- When no visible liquid could be seen on the DNA pellets, they were redissolved in 100 µl 

dH2O and 1 ml of Buffer QBT was added. 

- The samples were applied to the previously equilibrated with 1 ml Buffer QBT QIAGEN-tip 

20 columns, allowing them to enter the resin by gravity flow. 



30 

 

- The QIAGEN-tips were washed with 4 x 1 ml Buffer QC. 

- The plasmid DNA was eluted by applying 1 ml Buffer QF (pre-heated at 65ºC to increase 

the yield).  

- The eluted DNA was precipitated by adding 0.7 volumes of room-temperature isopropanol. 

- A centrifugation at 13.000 rpm and 4°C for 30 minutes was carried out. 

- DNA pellet was washed with 1 ml room-temperature 70% ethanol and centrifugated again 

at 13.000 rpm and 4ºC for 10 minutes. 

- The pellets obtained were redissolved in 20 µl of TE buffer. 

The success of the plasmid purification was evaluated by loading onto 0.8% agarose 

(Lonza) gel in TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA, 5Prime) buffer at 60V for 200 min. The molecular 

weight marker used was GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas). Gels were stained with 

ethidium bromide and banding patterns were visualized by using a Molecular Imager 

FXTM system (Bio-Rad).

3.6 Restriction analysis 

A preliminary genetic characterization of the captured plasmids was performed by 

carrying out DNA digestions with the endonuclease NotI (#ERO591, Fermentas). The 

enzyme was chosen for the restriction analysis according to the bibliography and the in 

silico analysis made by means of the NEBcutter software (Vincze et al., 2003). 

Additionally, it is known that IncP-1 plasmids are characterized by a high guanine + 

cytosine content. Hence, the use of an endonuclease recognizing DNA regions enriched in 

Table VII. Composition and storage temperature of every solution required to perform the 

plasmid purification. 



32 

 

these nucleotides should give back more enlightening restriction patterns which allow to 

better compare the plasmids with each other. The previously known pKJK5 and pB10 were 

used as controls. 

Firstly the purified plasmid DNA was quantified using a ND-1000 

spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). Digestions were carried out by preparing a 20 µl reaction 

mixture containing 0.05-0.1 mg/µl of plasmid DNA, 0.25U/ µl of NotI, 1 X buffer O 

(Fermentas) and sterile miliQ water and incubating for 16 hours at 37 ºC. The enzymatic 

reactions were stopped by freezing at -20ºC. 

 

 

 

To analyze the resulting restriction profiles 5 µl of every restriction reaction were 

loaded onto 0.8% agarose TAE gels, and ran for 200 minutes at 40 V, using the 

GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas) as molecular weight marker. Ethidium bromide-

stained gels were seen using a Molecular Imager FXTM system (Bio-Rad). 

 

3.7 Electrotransformation of Escherichia coli Top10 with IncP-1 plasmids 

With the aim of improving the DNA quality, the purified plasmids known to encode 

for tetracycline resistance (from the transconjugants 1, 2, 6 and 7) were transferred to 

previously prepared electrocompetent well known bacterial cells (Escherichia coli Top10, 

sensible to tetracycline). The MicroPulser™ Electroporation Apparatus (Bio-Rad) was 

employed to perform a slightly modified electrotransformation procedure based on the 

Catalog Number 165-2100.  

Detailed protocol: 

- Both the electrocompetent cells and a sterile 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) 

were placed on ice. 

Fig 3. Nucleotide sequence recognition site of endonuclease NotI. 



33 

 

- 40 µl of the cell suspension were mixed with 2 µl of pDNA in a pre-chilled microfuge 

tube and incubated on ice for 1 minute.  

- The mixture of cells and DNA were transferred to the bottom of the cold electroporation 

cuvette, which were placed in the right position in the chamber slide.  

- The Ec1 program was chosen and one fast pulse was made. 

- The cuvette was immediately removed from the chamber and 450 µl of SOC medium 

were added without delay. 

- After quickly but gently ressuspending the cells with a Pasteur pipette, the solution was 

cultured at 37ºC for 1h30min with shaking of 200 rpm approximately. 

The success of the procedure was tested by plating in TSA medium (Tryptic Soy 

Broth, Merck; Rose-Bengal Chloranphenicol Agar, Merck) supplemented with 30 µg/ml of 

tetracycline and incubating at 37ºC. 

 

3.8 Antibiotic resistance assays 

The antibiotic resistance patterns of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and Escherichia 

coli Top10 harboring the identified incP-1 plasmids were determined by the agar disk 

diffusion method on Mueller Hinton media (Merck). Susceptibility testing were performed 

for resistance against a panel of 9 antibiotics, including representatives of the most 

common antibiotic resistance traits shown by the previously known IncP-1 plasmids: 

streptomycin (S10), amoxicillin  (AML25), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (AMC30), 

tetracycline (TE10), chloramphenicol (C10), trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT25), 

erythromycin (E15), cephalothin (KF30) and aztreonam (ATM30). The antibiotics disks 

were supplied by the company Oxoid. Escherichia coli 25592 as well as Pseudomonas 

putida KT2442 (original host) or Escherichia coli Top10 (subsequent host) were used as 

controls. 

Detailed protocol: 

- To assure the use of fresh cultures (not more than 24 hours) the antibiotic assay control 

bacterial strain, as well as all the microorganism to test, were cultivated in LA medium 

(Lonka) at 30ºC (for Pseudomonas putida) or 37ºC (for Escherichia coli). 



34 

 

- Cellular suspensions were prepared by dipping single colonies of every fresh culture into 1 

ml of NaCl2 0.9 % comparing the turbidity to the 0.5 of the McFarland scale pattern 

(approximately 1.5x108 CFU/ml). 

- Every microorganism was spread on a Mueller Hinton media (Merck) plate, guaranteeing 

the whole surface covering. 

- The sterile discs were placed on its correspondent positions. 

- Finally the plates were incubated at 30ºC (for Pseudomonas putida) or 37ºC (for 

Escherichia coli) for 24h. 

The diameters of inhibition zones of the Mueller-Hinton media (Merck) were 

afterward measured and the susceptibility/resistance breakpoints defined by the CLSI 

(Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) for Pseudomonas or Escherichia coli (CLSI 2005) 

were considered. 

 

3.9 HgCl2 resistance assay 

In order to find a connection between the presence of the captured plasmids and 

the levels of resistance to mercury ions, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 

determined. With that purpose, the correspondent transconjugants were plated in TSA 

medium (Tryptic Soy Broth, Merck; Rose-Bengal Chloranphenicol Agar, Merck) 

supplemented with increasing HgCl2 (Sigma) concentrations: 25, 100, 200, 400 and 3200 

µg/ml. Each experiment was repeated twice, except that with the highest concentration. 

Pseudomonas putida KT2442, known to be sensible to mercury ions, was used as 

negative control. The lowest concentration that inhibited growth compared with the control 

plate was defined as the MIC of the compound (Rasmussen et al., 1998). 



35 

 

4. Results and discussion 

4.1 BHR plasmid detection and phylogenetic analysis 

 The presence of BHR plasmids in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon from endogenous and 

exogenous origin was examined by means of PCR amplification and subsequently 

checked by electrophoresis or dot-blot hybridization.  

The PCR screening for endogenous BHR-plasmids was performed over 

representative bacterial isolates from SML and SSW environments along the lagoon. 

Electrophoresis were carried out for the detection of the IncP-1 amplifications, while the 

dot blot hybridization method was employed to test out the results of IncN, Q and W PCRs. 

As shown in the figs 4 and 5, no amplification of BHR-plasmid specific sequences was 

detected for any of the samples tested. Hence, these results suggest that no BHR 

plasmids are present in any of the bacterial isolates tested.   

In this work, the 79 putative plasmids obtained from plasmid exogenous capture 

using Pseudomonas putida KT2442 as host were only PCR tested for IncP-1 BHR plasmid 

specific sequences, since in a previous investigation, no incN, Q and W replicons were 

detected (Oliveira et al., 2009). Fig 6 shows the PCR results using the trfA set of primers in 

7 transconjugants. It is possible to see in the correspondent lanes the amplification of a 

DNA fragment of about 281bp. As for the remaining samples and PCR primers sets, no 

amplification was detected. The amplifications obtained for the 7 transconjugants samples 

most possibly correspond to the amplification of a 281bp DNA fragment of the gene trfA 

from IncP-1 ?, ? or ? BHR plasmids. This indicated that such IncP-1 plasmids were present 

in the Ria of Aveiro lagoon due to the specificity of the different primer pairs, respectively.  

From here on, to simplify, the plasmids harbored by transconjugants 1, 2, 6-10 will 

be referred to in the text and tables as 1, 2, 6-10. It might be relevant to consider the 

divergence among these seven plasmids, both regarding the selective marker used to 

capture them and with respect to the origin, that is summarized in table VIII. Four of the 

plasmids (1, 2, 6 and 7) were captured by taking advantage of tetracycline resistance 

phenotypes, whereas the other three (8, 9 and 10) were seized from its resistance to 

mercury ions. While two (1 and 2) came from a sampling site in Ria where the presence of 

harbor facilities and urban effluents determine the selective pressures, Cais do Sporting,

the remaining ones (6, 7-10) emanate from a site highly impacted by the chemical 

industrial plants located in its vicinity, Cais do Chegado (Ramos, 2009). At the same time, 

two plasmids (9 and 10) were collected from the SSW, in contrast to the other five (1, 2, 6-

8), which had their origin in the SML. That suggests wider plasmid diversity both in the 

SML (and in the sampling site influenced by industrial activities, Cais do Chegado.

With the aim of identifying the IncP-1 plasmid subgroup (?, ? or ?) to which each 

amplicon corresponded, the amplified DNA samples were purified and sequenced (Table 

X). Subsequently, every pair of contiguous nucleotide sequences was assembled and the 

resultant fragments were compared with previously known sequences by using the on-line 

software BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). Results suggested that the plasmids 1, 6 and 7 

belonged probably to the IncP-1? subgroup whereas the 2, 8, 9 and 10 seemed to be 

members of the IncP-1? subgroup of plasmids. Putting together all the information known 

up until now (see table IX) it may be suggested that only two pairs of plasmids could be

equal: on one hand no differences were seen yet between plasmids 6 and 7 (furthermore 

the plasmid 1 diverges from them only in the selective pressures received at its original 

environment); on the other hand the plasmids 9 and 10 could be identical, differing from 

the remaining two plasmids (2 and 8) over the origin or/and over the phenotypic trait used 

for its isolation.

Table X. Nucleotide sequences of the seven trfA gene fragments amplified by PCR with the primers trfA (5’ – 3’).

 To further analyze the sequences, multiple alignments of these seven nucleotide 

sequences were performed (Fig 7). It can be noticed that the sequences from plasmids 

placed in the same IncP-1 subgroup are almost identical (with parwise alignment scores of 

99-100), whereas sequences from different subgroups are not so similar (with parwise 

alignment scores of 84-85). That supports the above mentioned relationships between the 

seven captured plasmids. 

 

Also, alignments were carried out together with corresponding nucleotide 

sequences from 20 other incP-1 plasmids that, so far, represent the full known diversity 

within this 281bp-region (Balh et al., 2009). Alignments were performed by the 

CLUSTALW2 program. 

Neighbor-joining trees based on the distance parameter were constructed, from a 

multiple alignment performed with the ClustalX program (Larkin et al., 2007), using the 

PAUP4.0b program (Swofford, 2003). Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were also 

acquired and shown as percentages (see fig 8).

lagoon (Tcj 1, 2, 6-10) in relation to previously described IncP-1 plasmids, based on a multiple

neighbor-joining tree. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates are shown as percentages. The 

distances between the fragments are indicated by the substitutions/site bar.  

 
 



44 

 

  The phylogenetic analysis made was compared with the one presented by Bahl et 

al. (2009) since the same parameters were used. Both unrooted trees are very similar. 

Although a few differences can be seen in some phylogenetic associations with low 

bootstrap values (and therefore without a considerable significance), the greater part of the 

members of the IncP-1 plasmids maintain the same phylogenetic distances.  

By assesing the phylogenetic tree (Fig 8) it was possible to confirm that the trfA 

gene amplificated fragments of the plasmids 2, 8, 9 and 10 belong to the IncP-1? 

subgroup. Additionally, the trfA gene fragments nucleotide sequences 8 and 9 showed to 

be closer philogenetycally than with the other 2 and 10. That does not totally agree with 

the suppositions made before, since the plasmids 9 and 10, which had in common the 

same original environment and were captured by means of the same phenotype, seemed 

to havea high chance that they could be the same plasmid. Therefore, a feasible 

divergence beetween plasmids with the same origin is suggested. Plasmids 8 and 9 differ 

only in the aquatic environment where they were captured (SML vs. SSW), since they 

coexisted with the same selective pressures (industries effluents in Cais do Chegado) and 

both are resistant to mercury ions. The plasmid 2 is the only one among those four which 

was captured by taking advantage of to its tetracycline resistance and in Cais do Sporting 

(harbor and urban effluents).Furthermore, these 4 nucleotide sequences most likely form a 

new cluster, hence revealing to be more different from any other incP-1? gene fragment 

sequences known up till now.  

Regarding the plasmids 1, 6 and 7 (all of them captured from the SML taking 

advantage of its tetracycline resistance), the analysis of the trfA gene fragments 

corroborate that they belong to the IncP-1? subgroup and display a higher similarity 

between plasmids 6 and 7 (which come from Cais do Chegado) than with the other 

captured IncP-1? plasmid, plasmid 1 (captured from Cais do Sporting). That suggests a 

slightly different evolution related to the selective pressure occurring in the samples origin. 

Again, the 3 nucleotide sequences emerge like a new cluster, appearing to diverge both 

from the closest known IncP-1? plasmid, pKJK5, and from the partially described pEMT3. 

 



45 

 

4.2 Plasmid characterization 

With the purpose of further characterizing the captured plasmids a preliminary 

phenotypic and genotypic analysis was carried out. To perform this work, the two closest 

relatives to both clusters of plasmids based on the phylogenetic analysis described above, 

pB10 and pKJK5, were chosen as archetypes for IncP-1? and ? subgroups respectively. 

Initially, the seven plasmids were purified from Pseudomonas putida KT2442, the 

recipient strain used in the exogenous plasmid capture experiments (Oliveira et al., 2009). 

The first key fact to take into account to carry out the plasmid isolation is that IncP-1 

plasmids are present in the host cell in a very low copy number. As a consequence, large 

culture volumes were required to yield significant amounts of plasmid DNA. In addition, 

this family of BHR plasmids is characterized by its enormous size: all the IncP-1 plasmids 

know until now have more than 45 kb. Because of that its electrophoretic mobility in 

comparison with genomic DNA is expected to be very similar, complicating the plasmid 

DNA purity analysis. Anyhow, the success of the plasmid purification can be noticed in the 

fig 9. A subtle difference in the position of both kinds of DNA can be appreciated. 

Additionally, a second DNA conformation in the plasmid 10 is detected, although may be 

considered an artifact from the plasmid purification procedure. 

 

 

Fig 9.  Illustration of the 0,8% agarose gel where every purified plasmid DNA as well as the 

genomic DNA extracted from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (the bacterial host in every cases) 

ran for 200 minutes at 60 V.  



46 

 

Restriction fragment analyses were carried out to compare genetically the isolated 

plasmid DNAs. Different band profiles were obtained through the digestion of each one of 

the seven purified plasmids as well as the two models with the endonuclease NotI. The 

results (figs 10 and 11) allow affirming that six plasmids (1, 2, 6, 7, 8/9, 10) isolated from 

the Ria de Aveiro lagoon are different between each other and between the two fully 

characterized archetypes used.  

In the first place, if both images are compared, the restriction patterns from both 

IncP-1? and IncP-1? plasmid subgroups can be clearly distinguished, which confirm again 

the location of the captured plasmids into the two divergent IncP-1 subgroups that had 

already been proved.   

Analyzing deeply the figure 10 it can be noticed that the restriction profiles of three 

of the captured plasmids (2, 10 and 8 or 9) are visibly different between each other and 

from its closest relative, whereas the plasmids 8 and 9 seem similar by looking at that 

image. That agrees with the phylogenetic analysis, which indicated a higher similarity 

between these two plasmids (8 and 9), despite the two analysis strategies consider 

different characteristics of these DNA molecules: the exact nucleotide sequence of a gene 

fragment and the position of the recognition sites of the endonuclease NotI in the whole 

unknown nucleotide sequence. In addition, plasmids 8 and 9 seems to be the closest to 

the previously described IncP-1? model pB10 attending to the restriction profiles. The 

three plasmids, coming from different environments (the SSW and the SML of the 

estuarine waters of Cais do Chegado in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon in Portugal and activated 

sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany, respectively) are 

resistant to mercury ions (Schlüter et al., 2003),  

By examining the restriction profiles of the plasmids 1, 6 and 7, it can be assured 

that they are undoubtedly different between each other and from the unique fully 

sequenced plasmid of the IncP-1? subgroup. The four plasmids carry resistance to 

tetracycline, while the estuarine origin of the captured plasmids is really different from the 

non-aquatic origin of the model, since the plasmid pKJK5 was isolated from a mixture of 

soil (from an agricultural field in Denmark) and manure (collected from a pig farm in the 

vicinity) (Bahl et al., 2007). Nonetheless, despite the similar or equal origin of the plasmids 

1, 6 and 7 (the SML from Cais do Sporting for the first one and from Cais do Chegado for 



47 

 

the others), the genetic structure of the three IncP-1? captured plasmids are clearly 

different. 

Hence, it is demonstrated that there is an appreciable diversity of IncP-1 plasmids 

in the estuarine environment studied, even among plasmids captured from the same 

environment (whose evolution have been subjected to the same selective pressures).

DNA from the bacterial host without any plasmid (Pseudomonas putida KT2442) with and without 

digestion with the same endonuclease were employed as control.

It can also be perceived when seeing these gels that the plasmid purification of the 

seven plasmids harbored by Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was not perfect, since an 

evident difference in the DNA quality shown in the restriction profiles of the seven captured 

plasmids in comparison with the restriction patterns obtained from the two models can be 

seen. That could be due to some degradation caused by the purification procedure, and/or 

to a slightly contamination of the plasmid DNA with genomic DNA from the bacterial host 

(P.putida). The fact that the plasmid purification of the models (harbored by two different 

Escherichia coli strains) give such ideally purified results leads to the performance of the 

transference of four of the plasmids purified from P.Putida KT2442 (the four that were 

captured from its tetracycline resistance) to E.coli Top10 by electroporation, with the aim of 

improving the yield and the quality of the plasmid DNA. 

Additionally, a phenotypic plasmid characterization was carried out. Firstly, some 

antibiotic resistance assays were done with the seven plasmids harbored by 

Pseudomonas putida KT2442, confirming that the plasmids 1, 2, 6 and 7 encode 

resistance to tetracycline, since the bacterial host without plasmid is susceptible to this 

antibiotic. It was also demonstrated that the plasmids 8, 9 and 10 do not encode 

resistance to this antibiotic. However, further resistance tests were hindered since the host 

showed resistance to the remaining eight antibiotics to be tested. The results of these 

assays are shown in fig 12 and explained in Table XI. 

 Despite that at a first glance these results appear strange (because of the 

antibiotic resistance trait in the bacterial host without plasmid that disappears with the 

presence of a plasmid), the length of the inhibition hales gives low meaning to this result.   

The expression of any phenotypic trait encoded by the bacterial chromosome, like the 

antibiotic resistances, might be decreased due to the presence of a plasmid burden. That 

happens with chloranphenicol and aztreonam resistance when plasmids 2, 6-10 are 

present, with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance because of the occurring of plasmids 1, 

6-10 and with streptomycin in the case of the plasmid 7. 

It also should be noticed that both models are also resistant to tetracycline. That 

results especially interesting with respect to the IncP-1? subgroup, since three of the 

captured plasmids (8-10) are not resistant to this antibiotic.

In order to clarify the results obtained from the first antibiotic resistance assay, a

plasmid 2 encodes for resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The results of the

Additionally, a mercury resistance assay was also performed (results are shown in 

Table XIII). According to Rasmussen (1998), the lowest metal concentration that inhibits 

growth compared with the control plate is defined as the MIC of the compound. Then 

despite the bacterial strains that carry plasmids 8, 9 and 10 are sensible to a concentration 

similar or higher than 400 of HgCl2 µg/ml it can be affirmed that plasmids 8, 9 and 10 

encode resistance to mercury ions. The other plasmids don’t encode this resistance. 

All the captured plasmids which showed resistance to mercury ions belong to the 

IncP-1? subgroup. The model pB10, representing this subgroup in this research, was also 

described to be resistant to mercury ions. Unlike, the remaining member or this subgroup 

within the captured plasmids, the plasmid 2, is sensible to this heavy metal presence.

5. General discussion and conclusions 

 Previous ecological studies, by means of screening of environmental DNA, on the 

incidence of BHR plasmids in the estuarine environment Ria de Aveiro lagoon suggested 

that there may be an interesting presence of BHR plasmids in this special niche. 

Therefore, two approaches were used in preceding investigations to capture these 

promiscuous plasmids: endogenous and exogenous isolations, in which also the presence 

of plasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups IncN, IncQ and IncW were tested 

without any positive result. In this work, the occurrence of IncP plasmids over the bacterial 

isolates representing contrasting environments from the lagoon and the incidence of IncP, 

IncQ, IncN and IncW plasmids over the transconjugants obtained from the same sample 

sites were tested by PCR. That strategy is not absolutely reliable, but has limitations which 

lead to a biased analysis. The fact that the primers are constructed only from previously 

known sequences is the main handicap since that disables the detection of replicons 

without these specific nucleotide series. That way, the inability to find replicons where the 

evolution has pushed any significant change in the target sequences is assumed. 

 No BHR plasmid presence appeared among endogenous bacteria by means of 

the PCR screening. Due to the restrictions of the screening method this doesn’t assure the 

absence of this sort of plasmids among the assayed samples, but just suggests that there 

are not BHR plasmids containing the specific nucleotide sequences employed as targets 

for every incompatibility group tested amongst the cultures related to the endogenous 

isolation approach. The same can be explained regarding to IncQ, IncN and IncW 

plasmids occurring in the samples coming from the exogenous isolation.  

In contrast, seven transconjugants containing IncP-1 plasmids came up as a result 

of exogenous isolation with Pseudomonas putida KT2442 as recipient strain, which proved 

the presence of IncP-1 plasmids in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The importance of this 

comes from that it is the first time that IncP-1 plasmids are isolated from an estuarine 

environment. In addition, that strongly suggests that the special conditions occurring in this 

environment stimulated the flow of MGE, allowing bacterial evolution. 

 The divergence among the seven captured plasmids, both with regard to the 

phenotype trait employed for its selection (tetracycline resistance in the case of the 

plasmids 1, 2, 6 and 7; resistance to mercury ions for 8, 9 and 10) and in connection with 



55 

 

the contrasting environments along the lagoon they were collected from (SML for 1, 2, 6-8 

vs. SSW for 9 and 10; Cais do Sporting for 1 and 2 vs. Cais do Chegado for 6-10), should 

be considered. A wider plasmid diversity might be assumed, therefore, both in the SML 

(where the particular surrounding circumstances are known to favor the HGT) and in the 

sample site Cais do Chegado (where the high pressure made by chemical industrial 

effluents may lead the evolution). 

The seven 281 bp amplicons were purified, sequenced and analyzed to be 

phylogenetically affiliated into its correspondent IncP-1 subgroups. Four plasmids (2, 8, 9 

and 10), coming from the different locations above explained, three of them conferring 

mercury resistance and one tetracycline resistance (2), were confirmed to belong to the 

IncP-1? subgroup. And the other three plasmids (1, 6 and 7), captured from the SML of 

two estuarine environments from its tetracycline resistance, were determined to belong to 

the IncP-1? subgroup.  

Regarding the IncP-1? subgroup, a sub-division into two different phylogenetic 

branches had previously been suggested (Schlüter et al., 2003) by means of multiple 

alignments of several sequences. That divergence was also displayed in the phylogenetic 

tree presented here, which in addition to its general similarity with the neighbor-joining tree 

presented in the work of Bahl and colleagues (2009) adds soundness to the obtained 

phylogeny. This sub-division within this subgroup was not observed among the plasmids 

obtained from the lagoon, but all the four IncP-1? captured plasmids group together in a 

cluster contained in the same branch as the fully described archetype pB10, one of the 

closest relatives. The plasmid pB10 was isolated from a different environment (activated 

sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant in Germany) and was reported (Schlüter 

et al., 2003) to be resistant to tetracycline (like the IncP-1? captured plasmid 2) and to 

mercury ions (like 8, 9 and 10). 

No more than two IncP-1? plasmids have been described up till now and can be 

used to analyze this subgroup. Barely a fragment of one of them (pEMT3) is known, but 

the three IncP-1? captured plasmids are evolutionary closer to the plasmid that has been 

completely sequenced recently (pKJK5). However, the three IncP-1? captured plasmids 

group also together in a cluster. In a really different environment (a mixture of soil and 

manure in Denmark), the model plasmid pKJK5 was captured thanks to the same 

phenotypical trait as the three IncP-1? captured plasmids: the resistance to tetracycline 



56 

 

(Bahl et al., 2007). Plasmids belonging to this subgroup have also been isolated 

exogenously from piggery manure (Binh et al., 2008), showing trfA homologs of 99-100% 

identity to pKJK5, this sturdily indicates the presence of plasmids belonging to the IncP-1?  

subgroup, which clearly diverge from the other IncP-1 subgroups, and increases the 

importance of further research on these plasmid subgroup.   

The originality of the discovery of such two novel clusters supports the significance 

of this work. Therefore, in order to confirm whether both sets of plasmids really differed 

from all the already characterized plasmids, and to check if the captured plasmid were 

different from each other, a genetic and phenotypic comparison was carried out. With that 

purpose the evolutionary closest previously described plasmid models above explained 

(pB10 and pKJK5 for IncP-1? and IncP-1? subgroups respectively) were employed. A 

summary of the results of this preliminary phenotypic plasmid characterization of each one 

of the seven plasmids in comparison to the known characteristics of the models, as well as 

the origins of all of them (mentioning the selective marker used in its isolation) is shown in 

Table XIV. 

The four plasmids confirmed to belong to the IncP-1? plasmid subgroup (2, 8, 9 

and 10) are clearly different from the model pB10, both attending to their phenotypic traits 

(the captured plasmids are resistant either to tetracycline or to mercury ions, while the 

plasmid pB10 is resistant to both) and to the restriction profiles (pB10 has a genetic 

structure clearly divergent from the rest). At the same time one of them (2), the only one 

which was isolated from Cais do Sporting, is which most differs from the remaining three, 

both looking at the restriction profiles and considering the phenotypic characterization (the 

plasmid 2 is the unique one among the members of this cluster which carries resistance to 

tetracycline and to trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole). Maybe the different sampling site 

(and therefore the different selective pressures suffered) is related to the difference in 

phenotype. Although no differences in phenotypic resistance profiles were seen between 

the plasmids 8, 9 and 10 (all the three are resistant to mercury ions), the restriction profiles 

suggests that there are differences in their genetic structures. Nevertheless, while these 

differences are not very clear between the plasmids 8 and 9 (the closest in the 

phylogenetic tree), this divergence is obvious with the plasmid 10, which coming exactly 

from the same sampling site as the plasmid 9, differ clearly from it. 



57 

 

Despite the phenotypic characterization of the captured IncP-1? plasmids (1, 6 and 

7) was similar, the manifest difference of its genetic structures from the unique previously 

fully described plasmid pKJK5 involves a great significance, increased due to the lack of 

knowledge about this IncP-1 plasmid subgroup. Moreover, the restriction profiles proved 

also the divergence among the three.  

So, overall, the detection and preliminary characterization of IncP-1 plasmids in the 

Ria de Aveiro lagoon suggested that this environment encloses high IncP-1 plasmid 

diversity, which indicates that these promiscuous plasmids evolved differently from the 

plasmids known until now, possibly due to the special conditions occurring in that niche. 

The fact that these are the first plasmids captured in estuarine environments may explain 

this divergent evolution. Anyway, it can be concluded that the Ria de Aveiro lagoon might 

provide such interesting niches to study the IncP-1 plasmid evolution along an estuary 

displaying different selective forces. 

Another point that deserves to be emphasized is related to the high probabilities of 

the plasmid 8 and 9 to be the same, since they were captured from the same sampling site 

but different aquatic environment (SML and SSW, respectively), while plasmids coming 

from exactly the same environment, like 6 and 7 or 9 and 10, are clearly different. That 

may suggest that the selective pressures are much more important in the evolution than 

the aquatic environment (SML or SSW). Nonetheless, the low number of captured 

plasmids strongly disables the establishment of any pattern of plasmid characterization 

and distribution according to the ecological niches and the particular conditions occurring 

in each environment. 

Finally, the most significant results obtained in this research are the discovery of at 

least six novel IncP-1 plasmids. As mobile genetic elements with an enormous range of 

bacterial host, the IncP-1 plasmids represent a huge bacterial diversity source and a highly 

useful gene spring, since they carry nucleotide sequences that encode traits that allow 

microbial adaptation to special niches, even more varied due to the extremely different 

bacterial hosts in which they can be maintained. Therefore, the implication of the discovery 

of unknown promiscuous plasmids is due to the really important role they play in the HGT 

(and therefore, in microbial evolution). 



58 

 

The whole description of a novel plasmid may lead to the discovery of unaware 

genes encoding potentially useful traits (since MGE allows bacterial adaptation, they must 

carry genes encoding for phenotypic traits that are beneficial for bacteria, and they might 

be useful for humans too). In addition, the plasmids may be useful as cloning vectors or 

protein expression vehicles in genetic engineering, which only can become possible from a 

complete and exhaustive understanding and familiarity with these entities.
