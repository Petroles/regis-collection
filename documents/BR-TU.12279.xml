FLUORESCENCE STUDY OF SOL-GEL DERIVED PROTEIN 

SILICA HYBRIDS FOR OPTICAL BIOSENSOR APPLICATIONS 

 

Abstract 

 
The encapsulation of enzymes for optically addressed biosensor applications is an 

area of great importance. Firstly there is a need to provide a robust, optical quality host 

in which to incorporate the biomolecule. In principle the host matrix should be “inert” 

(with minimum interaction with the guest enzyme), protective and should retain the 

enzyme within its structure, allowing maximum catalytic activity and free passage of 

the reactants both to and from the enzyme. Materials which are promising in this respect 

are silica glasses made via the sol-gel technique. They are optically transparent, have a 

high porosity and they template around the biomolecule providing a protective host. 

However, the encapsulation process can have adverse effects; the loss of enzymatic 

catalytic activity can happen and the mass transport through the host is not ideal! 

In this work fluorescence techniques were used to monitor the incorporation of an 

enzyme into a sol-gel derived medium. Several additives were used in tuning the 

original sol-gel recipe to improve biocompatibility. Complementary measurements of 

catalytic activity were performed to elucidate the behaviour of the encapsulated protein. 

Molecular diffusion was monitored using labelled proteins and unbound 

fluorescence dye molecules (representative of enzyme substrates) and their interaction 

with and mobility within the host assessed using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy 

and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching observed via confocal microscopy. 

Viscosity (DASPMI) and polarity (Nile red) sensitive fluorescence probes were 

employed to monitor the host matrices. Nile red was also used to label two catalytic 

proteins (cytochrome c and subtilisin Carlsberg), which were incorporated into different 

host media and the dye used to ascertain changes in protein conformation. 

Overall it was found that the hosts became stable after an aging period 

approaching twenty days and that the major influence on the catalytic reaction rates is 

that of host mediated mass transport.

FLUORESCENCE STUDY OF SOL-GEL DERIVED PROTEIN 

SILICA HYBRIDS FOR OPTICAL BIOSENSOR APPLICATIONS 

 
Resumo 

 
A utilização de enzimas para a construção de biosensores ópticos tem evidenciado 

um notável desenvolvimento. Neste contexto, a tecnologia sol-gel, cuja versatilidade é a 

palavra-chave do seu sucesso, tem demonstrado enormes potencialidades. A oclusão de 

enzimas em matrizes de sílica pela técnica sol-gel permite a obtenção de híbridos com 

boas qualidades ópticas e considerável robustez física. Para além disso, a sua porosidade 

permite a difusão dos substratos enzimáticos e produtos de reacção, com retenção da 

enzima constituindo, simultaneamente, um meio protector contra agentes físicos, 

químicos e biológicos. Contudo, o processo tem as suas fragilidades, nomeadamente a 

perda de actividade catalítica devido a desnaturação da enzima, e constrangimentos 

relativamente ao livre-trânsito dos analitos.  

Neste trabalho, foram utilizadas técnicas de fluorescência para seguir a 

incorporação de proteínas em matrizes de sílica pela técnica sol-gel. A receita original 

foi adaptada, utilizando-se aditivos (silanos ou polímeros) para melhorar a 

biocompatibilidade dos híbridos. A difusão molecular foi estudada usando proteínas 

marcadas com sondas fluorescentes e fluoróforos livres, através das técnicas de 

anisotropia de fluorescência resolvida no tempo e recuperação de fluorescência após 

fotobranqueamento, esta última utilizando a microscopia confocal. A polaridade e a 

viscosidade das matrizes foram estudadas utilizando as sondas Nile red e DASPMI, 

através da medição de fluorescência no estado estacionário (fazendo uso da técnica de 

varrimento síncrono de fluorescência), ou resolvida no tempo. A sonda Nile red, por ser 

hidrofóbica e solvatocrómica, foi escolhida para marcação das proteínas e levar a cabo 

estudos de conformação enzimática. Estudos complementares de actividade catalítica, 

foram realizados para caracterizar o comportamento do biocatalisador encapsulado. 

Concluiu-se que as matrizes produzidas utilizando o nosso método, estabilizam ao fim 

de um período de aproximadamente 20 dias e que a taxa de transformação substrato-

produto das proteínas estudadas, é mais influenciada pelas restrições impostas pela 

matriz ao livre-trânsito dos analitos, do que pela desnaturação das biomoléculas.

INTRODUCTION 

 
One of the most promising technologies of the 21st century is nanotechnology; the 

recent breakthroughs in this research area are pushing forward the applications of 

nanomaterials in several scientific areas such as nanomaterials-based biosensors, which 

represents the integration of material science, molecular engineering, chemistry and 

biotechnology [1,2]. A biosensor is a device capable of providing selective quantitative 

or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element, by 

converting a biochemical event into a detectable signal via a transducer and a processor. 

Biosensors are classified according to the transduction element (e.g., electrochemical, 

optical, piezoelectrical or thermal) or the biorecognition principle (e.g., enzymatic, 

immunoaffinity recognition, whole-cell sensor or DNA). The purpose of the biological 

element is to grant selectivity for the analyte of interest  [3-5]. 

At present, commercial biosensors are still expensive and limited in the number of 

targets they can test. The future developments of science and technology will permit the 

fabrication of optical biosensors useful as everyday analytical tools. In the opinion of 

Ligler “biological recognition and signal amplification strategies, nanotechnology for 

geometric control of the biochemistry and signal enhancement, microfluidics for 

automated reagent delivery and reaction control, and emergence of optical elements 

amenable to improved systems integration will play a critical role in this evolution” [6]. 

The four prerequisites of a competitive biosensor to function in a real-world sample 

situation are undoubtedly selectivity, sensitivity, detection limits, and robustness. 

Biosensors have wide applications, including biomarker detection for medical 

diagnostics, pathogen and toxin detection in food and environmental monitoring. Fibre-

 1



optic biosensors use optical fibres as the transduction element, and rely exclusively on 

optical transduction mechanisms for detecting target molecules [7,8]. 

The development of biosensors based on nanostructured sol–gel-derived platforms 

has attracted increased attention in the last three decades and reports on the successful 

entrapment of biomolecules such as proteins, enzymes, antibodies or drugs are 

numerous [9-14]. The term sol refers to a colloidal suspension of solid particles (the 

disperse phase) in a liquid (the continuous phase) that, by condensation, form an 

irregular, non-crystalline, three-dimensional network that occupies the entire volume of 

a vessel – the gel. The gel network is porous and is filled by an interstitial fluid. In 

hydrogels, the fluid phase is water or aqueous solution, in alcogels it is alcoholic 

solution, and in aerogels it is air or other gases [15]. The term colloid was coined by 

Thomas Graham in the 1860s, to classify substances such as gelatine, albumin and 

gums, which, in a solution, would not pass a dialysis membrane [16]. Common 

examples of other types of colloidal dispersions are foam, mayonnaise, fog and mist, 

and the biological cell [17]. 

The sol-gel technique is based on the hydrolysis of liquid precursors with the 

formation of colloidal sols and, after condensation, stable gels. Alkoxides, M(OR)z 

(where M z+ is a metal/semi-metal ion and R is an alkyl group), are the most widespread 

precursors. Among these, silicon alkoxides are very popular, as the materials obtained 

possess good optical properties (transparency), satisfactory mechanical stability, high 

surface area and porosity, chemical inertness as well as photochemical and thermal 

stability. Also, they can be obtained in a variety of formats depending on the mould. As 

the early steps of the sol–gel process occur in liquid phase, it is possible to add almost 

any substance at this stage, and a uniform distribution of the dopant is obtained merely 

by mixing. After the gelation, the guest molecules become entrapped within the solid 

host matrix [18]. The sol-gel immobilisation of biological entities is characterised by 

physical entrapment without any chemical modification of the biomolecule. The silica 

nanocage that forms around the dopant molecule protects it and preserves its 

functionality; the biochemical reaction is basically the same as in aqueous solution, 

except for the fact that it is generally slower, most probably because of mass transport 

limitations [19]. 

The potential applications of sol-gel technology are not restricted to sensing 

devices, they also have been studied in the context of drug delivery, drug targeting, 

tissue engineering, gene transfection, and cell tracking [20-23]. Applications in the 

 2



medical field such as bone implant rely on the fact that sol-gel derived media are 

biocompatible, bioactive and inert [24,25]. The enormous versatility of the sol-gel 

chemistry enables the production of robust hybrids at low temperatures with remarkable 

new material properties that can be used to enhance the stability of a certain 

biomolecule. Chemically engineered surfaces, modification by additives and alcohol-

free routes are some of the strategies that have been reported aiming to produce 

amenable sol-gel hosts [8,26-30]. However, before commercialisation, problems 

inherent to the sol-gel process like stability, response time or repeatability have to be 

resolved [31].  

The sensor area has grown considerably through the design of sol–gel materials 

with enhanced biorecognition. A great effort has been made to understand short and 

long-term interactions between the biorecognition elements and the evolving sol–gel 

matrix. These interactions are essential because they govern the function of the 

entrapped biomolecule [10,32,33]. Also, in the particular case of enzymes, ensuring that 

the substrate and the products of reaction are not sterically hindered from diffusing to or 

from the active site, is fundamental [34,35]. Similarly, the local environment of the 

entrapped biomolecules and the ability of analytes to diffuse through the matrix are two 

basic issues when developing sol–gel-based biosensors [10]. 

The fact that sol-gel hybrids can be transparent, therefore light addressable, 

enables the study of the embedded biomolecule via spectroscopic methods and the 

application of the technology to optical biosensors. The investigation in this area is 

intense, ranging from simple one-enzyme devices to multi-enzyme systems [36-39]. 

Fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used to monitor the sol-gel process, the 

conformation/interactions of proteins in aqueous solution and to determine enzymatic 

activity [40-47]. The use of fluorescence techniques to monitor sol-gel hybrid systems 

seems ideal as it can address both the host matrix and the guest biomolecule, and 

enables the visualisation of molecular diffusion down to single-molecule level [48]. 

Moreover, the use of fluorescent probes with different sensitivities allows the 

discrimination between diverse physical and chemical properties within these micro-

heterogeneous systems. In fact, the information obtained by experiments depends on the 

attributes of the probe, therefore a careful scrutiny of the fluorophore must be done 

before setting up any experiment [49]. For example, the strong solvent-dependency of 

electronic bands (solvatochromism) which is exhibited in particular by molecules 

having large dipole moments can be used to extract information about the solvent 

 3



polarity, out of simple fluorescence measurements [50,51]. This property can further be 

exploited by synchronous fluorescence spectrometry (SFS), a technique that enables 

resolving the broad-band overlapping of conventional fluorescence spectra, which arise 

from their similar molecular structures. Like this, it is possible to discriminate a probe 

within several environments or, conversely, several compounds in a mixture [52]. 

The advantages of fluorescence include extreme sensitivity, specificity, and the 

ability to measure both intensity and lifetime. Time-resolved measurements give 

additional information besides steady-state data and they are especially relevant to in 

vivo sensing because they can be chosen so that light scattering and concentration 

effects become negligible [53]. Supplementary information is given by time-dependant 

anisotropy measurements. From here it is possible to extract information on size, shape, 

flexibility and rotation of molecules, and also information about the properties of the 

medium like viscosity [49]. The dynamics of a system can also be monitored by 

exploiting a phenomenon related to the properties of the fluorophores – photobleaching. 

Although in certain circumstances it can represent a drawback, it can also be an 

advantage for studying the movements of molecules when combined with imaging 

techniques.  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was initially employed 

to study the dynamics of lipids and proteins in living cells but its applications have 

expanded greatly with the development of confocal microscopy [54]. 

  

This thesis demonstrates how fluorescence can be successfully employed to 

monitor the production of a sol-gel derived biosensor. Our investigation followed the 

behaviour of biomolecules in the host, namely protein stability, mobility, and 

microenvironment characteristics, making use of both steady-state and time-resolved 

fluorescence techniques. Taking advantage of the flexibility of sol-gel chemistry, 

optimisation of the sol-gel “recipe” was made in order to make the hosts more amenable 

to the guest biomolecules. Protein-compatible monoliths were produced using the 

polymers polyethylene glycol (PEG 300 D and PEG 20 KD) and Gelrite®, to tune the 

resulting sol-gel composite dipolarity and pore templating, and thus control the flow of 

materials through the matrix [55-57]. The silanes (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane 

(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) or (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane 

(GPTES),  were added to prepare organically modified silica gels with differing 

hydrophobycities and, like that, promote the protein stability [58-61].  The proteins 

horseradish peroxidise (HRP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), subtilisin Carlsberg and 

 4



cytochrome c were encapsulated in inorganic and modified sol-gel derived media, 

acting as model systems of protein-doped sol-gel glasses, as their mechanistic behaviour 

is well documented in literature. Both HRP and cytochrome c are haem containing 

proteins and, although not strictly an enzyme, cytochrome c exhibits catalytic activity 

and was selected as it could be the forerunner for the inclusion of other cytochromes 

and even be part of the building blocks for incorporating an enzyme reaction chain 

within sol-gel derived media. 

The host manufacturing process was observed making use of viscosity 

(DASPMI) and polarity (Nile red) sensitive fluorescent probes, by monitoring their 

emission via steady state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. In addition, 

combining FRAP of FITC-labelled proteins of different sizes (HRP and BSA) in sol-gel 

monoliths with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements (also using Alexa 

Fluor 488), it was shown that lateral and rotational diffusion could be measured. Like 

that, it was possible to relate the molecules’ retention with the size and connectivity of 

the pores in the sol-gel matrix. 

 Nile red was also used to label two catalytically active proteins (cytochrome c 

and subtilisin Carlsberg), which were incorporated into the different host media. 

Motivated by the fact that Nile red’s SFS was previously successfully used to ascertain 

the probe’s distribution between lipoproteins and albumin in blood [62], we used a 

similar approach to ascertain changes in protein conformation, both upon incorporation 

and throughout the sol-gel aging period. Catalytic activity measurements were 

performed in order to correlate the fluorescence data with the embedded proteins’ 

biological activity. 

Measurement of cytochrome c activity was obtained from the oxidation of 2,2-

Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), by 

hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The formation of the ABTS?+ radical cation was monitored 

at 414 nm with time, using absorption spectroscopy. A similar procedure was employed 

in the case of the subtilisin Carlsberg hybrid matrices. However, in this case, the 

catalytic activity was monitored against a substrate of Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methyl 

coumarin (AAF-AMC) and the product formation was monitored at 370 nm. This 

strategy also allowed the influence of choice of substrate to be elucidated, as ABTS?+ 

radical is charged and can revert to its uncharged form. Conversely, AAF-AMC and the 

reaction product AMC (7-amido-4-methyl coumarin) are neutral and formed 

irreversibly. These complementary studies (Nile red SFS and catalytic activity) 

 5



provided an estimation of the influence of protein denaturing (and/or conformational 

change) as well as host mediated effects (diffusional access) on the observed catalytic 

activity. 

In this work fluorescence is employed to monitor the fabrication of a sol-gel 

hybrid protein-containing silica-based biosensor. Although this thesis does not 

encompass the manufacture of a complete sensor (device), it addresses important 

features of any biosensor system: how the biomolecule interacts with its host. 

Therefore, it is believed that the information obtained is relevant in advancing this field 

of study.

THE SOL-GEL METHOD 

 
2.1. Introduction 

 
The initial steps of the sol-gel science go back to the mid-1800, when M. Ebelman 

and T. J. Graham tried to manufacture inorganic ceramic and glass materials using 

tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS). However, to prevent silica gels to break into pieces, a 

long drying period was required (up to one year!). This, of course, reduced the interest 

on the method. For the next hundred years only academic chemists would give attention 

to the sol-gel process, gathering a reasonable amount of descriptive literature, but sparse 

understanding on the physical and chemical principles. Interest in the sol-gel process re-

emerged given the great optimism towards its ability to manufacture glass components 

such as fibres, lenses and mirrors, by direct low-temperature production. Besides this 

very important advantage, others commonly mentioned are the high homogeneity and 

purity of resulting materials and the possibility of greater control of the “glass” forming 

reaction. This allows the formation of materials of high porosity with a large internal 

surface area [1,2]. The word “tailor-made” is often employed to address these special 

features of the sol-gel process, and it is also the key to the success (present and future) 

of this technology. The recent revival of sol-gel method and the growing number of 

laboratories investigating this field during the last few decades is related to the 

requirement to produce new materials to be used in electronics, communication, energy, 

and other high technology fields [3-5]. In the 1990’s Avnir and co-workers succeeded in 

encapsulate biomolecules within silica sol-gel matrices, inaugurating a new era in 

 13



biotechnology-related materials [6,7]. This achievement motivated several other groups 

towards combining advanced materials with biology, producing applications in 

medicine, environmental science, biotechnology, sensors and photonics [8-12]. 

 

 

 

2.2. The sol-gel chemistry 

 
The name sol refers to a suspension of solid (colloidal) particles ranging in size 

from 1 nm to 100 nm, in a liquid. The predominant interaction between these particles 

originates from their surface charge and Van der Waals attractions. The sol comprises 

the precursors, or initial components of the sol-gel reaction. The most common class 

are the silicon alkoxides, with tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) and tetramethylorthosilane 

(TMOS) the most thoroughly studied. Some studies make use of TEOS as it is less toxic 

than TMOS. Alkoxides readily react with water – hydrolysis and two partially 

hydrolysed molecules can bind to each other releasing an alcohol. This reaction is called 

condensation, and if it continues, can form a long random branched polymeric 

molecule. Consequently, the process by which it forms is called polymerisation. When 

the molecule reaches macroscopic proportions and extends to the whole colloidal 

solution, it is said to have achieved the gelation point, signalling the moment when the 

system consists of a combination of solid and fluid phases. The gel point is easy to 

observe and measure qualitatively, but it is difficult to measure analytically, as it 

depends on the temperature, solvent and pH [1,13,14]. 

Most alkoxides and water are not miscible leading to the use of a co-solvent 

such as ethanol. Both hydrolysis and condensation can happen under acidic or basic 

conditions. Acid catalysis favours a relatively slower rate of hydrolysis; the linear 

polymerisation produces long molecules that can entwine resulting in gelation. Base 

catalysis favours a faster rate of hydrolysis giving rise to clusters of polymer chains, 

which behave as discrete species. Gelation occurs by linking of these clusters. With 

silicon alkoxides the pH above which condensation becomes faster than hydrolysis is 

around three [15,16]. Figure 2.1 illustrates the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of 

TEOS precursor molecules in an acid catalysed reaction.

catalysed sol-gel reaction. The condensation reactions release water and ethanol into the solution as the 

SiO2 matrix forms.

After gelation, the reaction continues, as the polymer network is flexible enough 

to move, allowing supplementary condensation. Also, there is still sol present inside the 

pores. As a result, monomers or small polymers can bind to the network, producing 

further changes in its structure and properties. This process is termed aging and is the 

reason why the gel shrinks in the early stages subsequent to gelation. Further shrinkage 

during the drying phase can occur, which involves the deformation of the network and 

transport of liquid through the pores, part of which can evaporate. This forms a product 

called a xerogel. Additional processing to remove further residual solvent may be 

performed and can result in a dense ceramic under conditions of an oxygen atmosphere 

and heat, or even  an aerogel if supercritical extraction (using CO2, for example) is 

done. Aerogels are an interesting class of materials with exceedingly large porosities 

(up to 99%!) and good thermal insulation properties [13,17]. 

 

The versatility of the sol-gel method enables the manufacture of materials with a 

great variety of forms (films, fibres, monoliths, and powders) as shown in figure 2.2. 

Moreover, it allows the incorporation of doping species (proteins, antibodies, drugs, 

particles, dyes, etc) by addition to the sol prior to gelation (figure 2.3).

The resultant materials can be chemically, photochemically and 

electrochemically stable. In addition, their transparency (in the visible spectral region) 

allows their optical characterisation and application in optoelectronic devices [18-28]. 

The combination of inorganic precursors with organoalkoxysilanes is very attractive in 

the sense that the new material can exhibit unique chemical and physical properties, 

which can be tuned for a multiplicity of purposes. This is the field of “organically 

modified silicates” – ORMOSILS with the general formula R-Si-(OR’)3, where R 

represents the functionality and OR’ represents the reactive alkoxide group [18]. The 

organic modification reduces the cross-linking during the polymerisation stage and 

densification is attenuated through the creation of numerous and/or large pores within 

the sol-gel network. Figure 2.4 depicts the organic modification of a silicon alkoxide 

and the ORMOSIL connectivity [17,18,29]. Hybrid materials can also be produced by 

interpenetrating polymer networks and formation of two concurrent organic and 

inorganic phases (possibly chemically bonded to each other). For example, the mixture 

of a silica sol with a solution of a water soluble polymer, such as agar, can produce an 

interpenetrating polymer network (or IPN) composite sol-gel matrix. Finally, organic 

compounds can be simply trapped within the host matrix. Blending more than one 

organic phase has been extensively used, such as combination of biopolymers with 

silica, for incorporation of biomolecules [30-36].

In this work, an adaptation of the acid catalysed production method proposed by 

Hench and West [1] with a TEOS precursor was used. The hydrolysis and 

polycondensation of this alkoxide precursor followed by aging under ambient 

temperature and pressure results in a “sponge-like” network of hydrated amorphous 

silica, with pores ranging from 1 to 10nm in diameter [1]. As previously mentioned, as 

water and silicon alkoxides are immiscible, a co-solvent (e.g. alcohol) is normally used. 

The objective here is the incorporation of biomolecules and alcohol is well known to 

deactivate them [15]. It is therefore important to limit the exposure of any biomolecule 

to ethanol. With this in mind, instead of using a co-solvent, sonication of the initial two-

phase system was performed to promote mixing of the two phases. The release of 

alcohol as a by-product of the hydrolysis is sufficient to promote further 

homogenisation [13]. The use of an acid catalysis was also preferred as the monoliths 

produced possess excellent optical properties. This is obviously desirable if the material 

is intended for application as an optical addressable biosensor. To avoid any adverse 

effects caused by an acidic environment, the biomolecules were added to the sol in a 

second step, in a neutral buffered solution and the concentration of acid kept low 

(&lt;0.01M). Finally, a set of ORMOSIL and IPN matrices were produced to encapsulate 

selected biomolecules. The silane modifiers were (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane 

(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) and (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane 

(GPTES). The chosen polymers were PEG 300 D, PEG 20 KD and Gelrite®. 

 18



2.3. Protein-doped sol-gel systems 

 
The mid-1950’s witnessed the first successful entrapment of enzymes into silica 

sol-gel derived media, with partial retention of their catalytic activity. The importance 

of this achievement was not immediately grasped but, three decades later, Avnir and 

Zink’s research groups restarted investigation on the application of a biological moiety 

into sol-gel derived media. In this framework, the central question is how to stabilise the 

biological component in the artificial environment, while preserving its properties, 

activity and function? Approaches used to immobilise biomolecules, like adsorption 

onto a surface and covalent attachment [37-39], can cause partial loss of activity 

because of steric hindrance as a result of the proximity between neighbouring molecules 

and orientational considerations. Moreover, adsorbed molecules can be easily degraded 

and covalent linkage techniques are often tedious and require several chemical steps. 

Sol-gel encapsulation, given the versatility, inertness and biocompatibility of the 

material, can reduce these problems [40,41]. The term encapsulation means the 

embedding of biomolecules into a sol-gel network — the silica condensation occurs 

surrounding each macromolecule, which can also act as a template. The pores formed in 

this way are in harmony with the molecule they host. If the biomolecule is an enzyme, it 

can retain its catalytic activity, which means that the active site is allowed to adjust its 

conformation inside the “nanocage”. For the system to fulfil its function it is also crucial 

that the enzyme substrates reach the enzyme and that the reaction products are able to 

leave the host. It is also important that the pores are big enough to permit the subtle 

changes in protein structure as it undergoes catalysis. Thus, it is desirable that the 

enzyme is not adsorbed or covalently bonded to the matrix, although some of these 

interactions may occur resulting in diminished catalytic efficiency [15]. 

 

The unique reactivity of enzymes is well suited for application in the discovery 

of new compounds, for example in the synthesis of molecules and molecular 

architectures that are difficult to achieve by traditional synthetic routes. Avnir and 

Frenkel-Mullerand have recently suggested, that confinement within the pore, rather 

than just physically prevent detrimental conformational change can also provide 

chemical protection preserving enzymatic activity, even under extreme pH conditions 

[42]. 

 19



Molecular confinement within silica nanopores can produce high volumetric 

catalyst loadings with an enhancement in the enzymes thermal stability. This fact 

supports the idea that sol-gel encapsulation can mimic the effects of molecular crowding 

and confinement in living cells [43-46]. Moreover, the entrapment of proteins in 

transparent sol-gel silica matrices has enabled the analysis of the longer timescale 

folding intermediates of cytochrome c to be elucidated and thus, redefine the folding 

pathways [47]. This study suggests that the same methodology can be applied to study 

other proteins. 

As previously stressed, silica gels can be produced with a large range of porous 

textures and network structures under different processing conditions, depending on the 

objective of the hybrid material [15,48,49]. Bioencapsulation in mineral/hybrid sol-gel 

hosts has been successfully attempted with a great variety of biological entities 

including numerous proteins, enzymes, antibodies, DNA, phospholipids and even whole 

cells [50]. This helps to explain the reason why investigation into sol-gel hybrid systems 

has progressed dramatically over the past two decades.  

 

 

 

2.4. Enzyme-based optical biosensors 

 
A biosensor is a sensing device in which the outcome of a biochemical process 

provides a measurable response. In other words, a biological transducer undergoes a 

specific biochemical reaction rendering a measurable analyte concentration [51].  In the 

case of optical biosensors after interacting with the analyte a change in the optical 

properties occurs. This information can be transmitted by means of an optical fibre or 

another light propagation process. Bio-optrodes are constructed by immobilising 

biological recognition components into optical fibres and are divided into two main 

categories based on their bioactivity; biocatalysts (enzymes and cells) and bioaffinity 

molecules (antibodies, receptors, and nucleic acids) [52]. 

 

The use of enzymes as the chemical transducer has enabled notable progress in 

the research of optical biosensors and has become indispensable. Many enzymatic 

reactions involve the use of coloured or luminescent substances, either as a substrate or 

 20



product of reaction, which enables their direct detection. Changes in absorbance and 

fluorescence for instance can be directly detected using an optical biosensor. If the 

enzymatic reaction does not involve such substances, optochemical transduction is 

obligatory and indirect detection required [53]. Several enzyme-based optical fibre 

biosensors have been reported, with applications in environmental, clinical, industrial, 

food, pharmaceutical and biotechnological sectors [54,55]. 

 

Enzymes are the most efficient catalysts known. In the living cell, they control 

all metabolic pathways by simply lowering the activation energy necessary for 

reactions, which would otherwise proceed at an exceedingly slow rate. The well-known 

mechanism describing the reversible single-substrate enzyme reaction, proposed in 

1913 by Michaelis and Menten, is described by the scheme [56]: 

 

 

E + S ? ES ? E+P 
 

Figure 2.5. Scheme of the Michaelis-Menten model, valid for one-substrate reversible reactions. In the 

equilibrium expression (E) signifies enzyme, (S) substrate, (ES) Complex enzyme-substrate, and (P) 

products of reaction. 
 

From an analytical point of view, the enzyme’s efficiency is a key feature, as are 

its reaction specificity and substrate selectivity. In fact, an enzyme chooses its substrate, 

selects the precise part of the molecule where to bind and can even differentiate optical 

isomers. All of these attributes allow straightforward catalysis to proceed, without side-

reactions or by-products and with increasing efficiency [57]. Thus, an accurate analysis 

is possible as the enzyme’s substrates (analytes) are selectively converted into species 

that are easy to detect. However, it is known that the use of enzymes in large scale 

technological processes has some drawbacks. Procedures for enzyme recovery are 

usually expensive and, although not consumed by the reaction, they denature with time 

with an associated loss in activity. If used in solution, purification is needed to obtain 

the enzymes after the reaction and, if disposable, environmental consequences have to 

be taken into account. For routine or on-site analysis, the immobilisation of enzymes is 

essential. The main benefit of immobilisation is the ability to separate the enzymes from 

the reaction products, permitting the catalyst to be reused. This leads to greater 

 21



efficiency as the number of reactions can be increased, along with the possibility to 

employ higher substrate concentrations [53,58]. 

 

One major advantage of optical biosensors is that they are very sensitive to low 

analyte concentrations, sometimes reaching the single molecule level if fluorescence is 

used. Some enzymes already contain in their structure chromophoric or fluorescent 

groups that can report on the reaction mechanism. There is however, the possibility of 

labelling the enzyme with chromophoric or fluorescent dyes prior to its incorporation in 

the supportive matrix [59]. Sol-gel glasses are promising materials for optical 

biosensors. Their porosity, robustness, transparency in the UV and visible part of the 

spectrum along with the inherent flexibility of the sol-gel method has allowed the 

encapsulation of a wide range of enzymes.  Nevertheless, major fundamental questions 

relating to this method remain to be optimised, thus explaining why it is still an intense 

area of investigation [52]. In the present work some of those questions will be 

addressed, namely: 

 

1. Kinetics in confining media 

The temporal resolution achieved by the sensor is connected with the kinetics of 

the enzymatic process. More precisely, the efficiency of the binding and transduction 

events, determine how fast a measurement can be done. The Michaelis-Menten 

mechanism has been used to compare the kinetics of encapsulated enzymes with the 

kinetics in aqueous solution. The interpretation of the kinetic parameters is not 

straightforward, because the accessibility of the analytes to the entrapped enzyme 

(largely determined by the pore size and electrostatics) can be limited. Furthermore, the 

silanol content, pH conditions and the hydrophobicity of the matrix can influence the 

enzyme integrity [15,59]. Therefore, the kinetic measurements only do not discern 

between partitioning of the substrate and enzyme activity effects [60]. 

 

2. Microenvironment within the pores 

The composition of the solution inside the pores of a sol-gel matrix is different 

from the bulk solution where the kinetic studies are usually performed, and it varies 

with aging time. Differences in the pH, for example, may affect the enzyme kinetics and 

the reaction mechanism. The external solution’s pH, however, is not necessarily the 

same as inside the pores [42]. Fluorescent probes have been successfully used to 

 22



monitor the sol-gel process, providing valuable information about the polarity of the 

solvent entrapped within the pores [61-64]. However, these probes report only on their 

local environment.  

 

3. Molecular mobility of the encapsulate 

A variety of techniques have been used to address molecular mobility in both 

bulk and sol-gel films, including fluorescence anisotropy, fluorescence correlation 

spectroscopy and single molecule tracking [65-67]. These studies have unravelled a 

number of environments within the sol-gel media, with different microviscosities. It was 

suggested that the mobility of the molecule is inherent to its size, sol-gel preparation 

method and aging time [67].  

 

4. Stability of the encapsulate 

Several studies have reported the enhanced stability of enzymes in sol-gel 

derived media [68-71]. The understanding of enzyme-host interactions seems to be a 

priority in order to improve the reactivity of these biomaterials [72]. Attempts to make 

the sol-gel process more amenable for the encapsulation of biological molecules are 

plenty; they include alcohol-free, IPN and ORMOSIL manufacturing routes, addition of 

glycerol, sugars and other osmolites to alter the protein hydration [73,74].

FLUORESCENCE AND MEASUREMENT 

TECHNIQUES 

 
3.1. Introduction 

 
Fluorescence is the most sensitive and versatile technique to investigate 

molecular interactions within matter and it is used by scientists from different 

disciplines. The past 20 years have witnessed an extraordinary increase in the 

application of fluorescence in several fields of the biological sciences and it is presently 

the leading research tool in biotechnology [1]. Fluorescence techniques have boosted 

new discoveries in biomedical sciences and, reciprocally, these achievements have 

pushed forward fluorescence measurement systems. An example is the sequencing of 

DNA by fluorescence (known since 1987), which enabled the completion of the human 

genome sequence in 2001 [2,3]. This was decisive in the development of new methods 

and applications of fluorescence. Other emerging applications (e.g. analytical 

chemistry) are the result of advances in laser, detector and computer technology. These 

have made it possible, for example, to create lifetime images of samples taking 

advantage of sophisticated microscopy techniques [1,4]. Furthermore, the numerous 

publications on the use fluorescence to study the sol-gel process confirm the adequacy 

of this technique on monitoring sol-gel derived material [5]. 

 

 31



Fluorescent molecules report on their specific microenvironment (polarity, pH, 

hydrogen bonding, electric potential, etc) and their fluorescence properties quite 

frequently show up differences between the bulk and nanoscale local environments 

within each material. Fluorescence is strongly influenced by interfacial interactions, 

providing additional information, for example, on the local structure, confinement or 

microviscosity. The information obtained also depends on the techniques employed to 

measure fluorescence. Furthermore, progress in technology is reducing the cost of 

equipment, thus allowing measurements that would have been  considered exotic or 

impractical [1,4]. 

 

 

 

3.2. Fluorescence 

 
The absorption of ultra-violet or visible light by a molecule can result in the 

formation states of higher energy. Such excited states are very unstable and the 

molecule returns rapidly to the ground state. This can occur with or without the 

emission of light. In the former the energy loss is called radiative and can give rise to 

the phenomenon of luminescence. The latter produces a non-radiative de-excitation. The 

phenomenon of luminescence is formally divided into fluorescence, if the transition is 

between states of the same spin multiplicity, or phosphorescence if the transition is 

between states of different multiplicity. These processes are appropriately illustrated by 

the Jablonski energy diagram, which is depicted in figure 3.1. The absorption of light or 

excitation of a fluorophore is represented by the straight upward arrow from the ground 

electronic single state (S0) to the excited states (S1, S2 etc) [1]. The subscripts 0, 1, 2, 3 

… refer to the energy ranking of the state relative to the ground state (S0). 

Superimposed on these electronic energy levels are a number of vibrational energy 

levels. Triplet states (designated T) are populated via the first excited singlet state and 

involve a change (flip) of spin. The first triplet level located energetically above S0  is 

T1, where the subscript 1 indicates the energy ranking among triplets [6]. As these 

electronic states are quantised the excitation energy, E has to match the energy 

difference between the ground state and the higher energy electronic state. According to 

quantum mechanics, 

 32



?
?

? hc
c

hhE ===      (3.1) 

 

where E is the energy, h is Planck’s constant, c the speed of light, and ? the frequency of 

the incoming photon, and ? the photon wavelength. 

The absorption of a photon occurs on the femtosecond (10-15 seconds) timescale 

and can bring a molecule to high vibrational levels of S1, S2 ... Subsequently this is 

followed by vibrational relaxation of electrons from high energy excited state levels to 

the lowest excited state energy level. This type of de-excitation process usually takes 

place on the sub-picosecond (&lt;10-12 seconds) timescale. Emission of photons from the 

lowest vibrational level of the first excited singlet state back to the ground state, called 

fluorescence, proceeds on the picosecond to nanosecond (10-9 seconds) time range. 

Molecules in S1, after undergoing spin conversion to the triplet state T1 (intersystem 

crossing) emit radiation on a longer time scale (10-6 – 1 second) commonly called 

phosphorescence. There are distinctive rate constants for each process, usually denoted 

as follows: fluorescence emission (kf), internal conversion S1 ? S0 (kic) and intersystem 

crossing (kisc).

is represented as straight upward arrow. Fluorescence and phosphorescence are represented as downward 

arrows. All non-radiative processes are represented by the dotted arrows.

The decay to the ground state, when observed in molecular species, is normally 

measured as a band (fluorescence spectrum) rather than a sharp line, upon steady state 

excitation. This is due to the numerous vibrational energy levels that occur in each 

electronic state, thus producing a wide range of photon emissions. Compared with the 

absorption spectrum, fluorescence emission is an approximate “mirror image” shifted to 

longer wavelengths as result of energy loss in excited state interactions. The shift 

(figure 3.2) is known as the Stokes’ shift, in honour of George Stokes, who is credited 

with the first description of the phenomenon of fluorescence in 1852.

Figure 3.2. Relative positions of absorption and fluorescence spectra. 
 

 

There are three fundamental parameters used in fluorescence spectroscopy: the 

fluorescence spectrum e.g. the emission intensity measured upon steady state excitation; 

the quantum yield (?F), ranging from zero to one, is the ratio between emitted photons 

and absorbed photons (equation 3.2).

In equation 3.2, kf is the rate constant for radiative deactivation S1 ? S0 with emission 

of fluorescence, knr is the rate constant for the overall non-radiative pathways of 

 34



deactivation S1 ? S0. knr is defined such knr = kic + kisc; finally, fluorescence lifetime (?) 

gives the characteristic time that a molecule stays in the excited state S1 before returning 

to the ground state and is given by the time that it takes for the intensity to drop to 1/e of 

its initial value. It is commonly written: 

 

nrf kk +

?       (3.3) 

 

The fluorescence decay with time is described by the function (3.4) where I is the 

fluorescence intensity measured at time t, I0 is the initial intensity observed immediately 

after pulsed excitation and ? is the fluorescence lifetime.

For an ensemble of fluorophores, some will emit soon after the excitation pulse, others 

will emit at times longer than the molecules characteristic lifetime, according to 

statistical physics. The time distribution of emitted photons is the intensity decay (figure 

3.3).

3.3. Excited state-host interactions 
 

Whenever immersed in a medium, the photophysics of a fluorescent probe, 

inevitably reports on the medium’s characteristics through its interaction with the 

surroundings. It is well-known that probe-host interactions are, in most cases, the result 

of: (a) electronic and/ or dipolar relaxation events, expressed as solvatochromic shifts in 

the emission spectra; (b) hydrodynamic factors that arise from the probe mobility 

(translational and/or rotational), expressed by the influence of the viscosity of the host 

medium on the photophysics of the probe, particularly on the nonradiative decay 

processes; and (c) other specific interactions, largely dependent upon the nature of the 

probe and the host medium. 

Solvatochromism is caused by differential solvation of the ground-state and first 

excited-state of the molecule (Franck-Condon excited state with the solvation pattern of 

the ground state). If, with increasing solvent polarity, the ground-state of the molecule is 

better stabilised by the surrounding solvent molecules than the excited-sate, a 

hypsochromic (or blue) shift of the absorption band is observed. If, the excited molecule 

is better stabilised by solvation than the relaxed molecule, a bathochromic (or red) shift 

of the absorption band is observed. The difference between these two states is also 

responsible for the solvent influence on the fluorescence emission. Since the time for 

the excitation event (~10-15 s) is much shorter than the time required for rotational or 

vibrational motions (~10-12 – 10-10 s), the nuclei (of the fluorophore plus the solvation 

shell) do not alter their position during the electronic transition. However, if the lifetime 

of the excitation is long enough, the solvent molecules around the fluorophore reorient 

their dipole moments accordingly, and solvent relaxation takes place. It is from this 

equilibrium excited state that fluorescence occurs. Solvent relaxation has the effect of 

reducing the energy gap between ground and excited states, resulting in a red shift of the 

fluorescence emission. Conversely, there is now a Franck-Condon ground state with a 

solvation pattern of the excited state that slowly (10 to 100 picoseconds) reorganises to 

the equilibrium ground state. It is easily understandable that solvatochromism depends 

on the physico-chemical properties of the fluorophore and solvent molecules. In 

general, dye molecules with a large change in their permanent dipole moments upon 

excitation, display stronger solvatochromic shifts. If after excitation the dipole moment 

increases a positive solvatochromism results. However, a decrease in the solute dipole 

 36



moment upon excitation results in a negative solvatochromism. Furthermore, the ability 

for the solute to create hydrogen bonds with the solvent (either in the ground or excited 

Franck-Condon states) enhances the extent of the solvatochromic shift. Solutes with 

intramolecular charge transfer absorptions are an example of molecules that display this 

particular solvatochromic behaviour and the dye Nile red is among them. Positive 

fluorescence solvatochromism is illustrated by figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4. Schematic representation of positive fluorescence solvatochromism. The non-polar ground 

state D-A absorbs a photon and reaches the locally excited state (D-A)*, which subsequently decays into 

a charge separated state. The solvent will stabilise this charge separated state by aligning its dipoles. The 

more polar the solvent, the greater the stabilising effect will be and the more the excited state will be 

lowered in energy. At the same time the ground state, which is non-polar, will be destabilised. The net 

result of these interactions is a decrease in the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state 

and thus a red shift in emission [7]. 

 

 

Several authors have established that the spectral shifts in the emission spectra (by 

reference to the vapour phase spectrum, ),  caused by local effects produced by 

electronic and dipolar relaxation are adequately described by the following equations

refers to the redistribution of electrons, and the term 

refers to the orientation of dipoles. Like this, it is possible to measure spectral 

shifts in the emission produced by a general solvatochromic effect. In equation 3.6, so 

called Mataga-Lippert equation, ?µ is the difference in the dipole moment of the 

molecule between ground and excited states, R is the cavity radius considering the 

molecule a point dipole at the centre of a spherical cavity, ? is the static dielectric 

costant of the host medium and n its refractive index. A well characterised 

solvatochromic effect has been observed for the dye Nile red in homogeneous media 

[10]. According to these authors the following data were found:

Hydrodynamic effects are generally expressed through viscosity. However, when 

examining molecular interactions, frequently the size of the probe is comparable to the 

size of the surrounding medium molecules. Thus, the molecule under study probes the 

medium as discontinuous. In this case, macroscopic viscosity becomes inaccurate to 

describe any observed effects. In the absence of a proper theory, phenomenological 

approaches have been employed by several authors [4,11]. This effect has been 

addressed in the present work as described in chapter 4 by adopting the concept of an 

“effective viscosity” when studying the fluorescence of 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-

methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI). 

 

Finally, regarding specific interactions an important illustration of this type of 

interaction is the hydrogen bond, also addressed during the course of this work.

3.4. The quenching of fluorescence 

 
Quenching effects have been studied at the fundamental level, but also as a 

source of information about biochemical systems [12,13]. The term quenching refers to 

any process that can result in effective reduction in fluorescence intensity. This can 

happen simply by boosting the non-radiative relaxation pathways from the excited state 

electrons to the ground state. Quenching processes may be either intramolecular or 

intermolecular and can reduce the excited state lifetime as well as the quantum yield of 

the fluorophore. Examples include excited-state reactions, molecular rearrangements, 

energy transfer, ground-state complex formation, and collisional quenching. Dynamic 

quenchers (e.g. O2, acrylamide, I-) reduce fluorescence intensity by collision, due to 

diffusive encounters between the fluorophore and quencher during the lifetime of the 

excited state. Quenchers are usually termed static (e.g. nicotinamide and heavy metals) 

if the fluorophore and quencher form a non-fluorescent complex in the ground state, 

thus reducing the population of excitable molecules [1]. 

Collisional quenching is described using the relation 3.7, called the Stern-

Volmer equation where Io and I are, respectively, the steady-state fluorescence 

intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, [ ]Q  is the quencher concentration 
and kq is the bimolecular quenching constant, ?0 is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the 

absence of quencher, and KD = kq ?0 is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant [4].  In the 

simplest cases the Stern-Volmer plot (where the ratio Io/I is plotted against the quencher 

concentration) gives a straight line with slope equal to KD
 

[ ]Qk
I
I

q 0
0 1 ?+= [ ]QK D+= 1      (3.7) 

 

The bimolecular quenching constant, kq, reflects the efficiency of quenching or the 

accessibility of the fluorophore to the quencher. An important characteristic of 

collisional quenching is that the ratio Io/I is proportional to ?o/?. This happens because 

quenching is an additional competing process that depopulates the excited state [1]. 

Sometimes both collisional and static quenching phenomena can occur simultaneously 

for the same fluorophores. If so, a characteristic upward deviation from linearity is 

observed in the Stern-Volmer plot [1,4]. 

 39



3.5. Time-resolved fluorescence 

 
Time-resolved fluorescence is used to measure the excited state lifetime of a 

fluorophore. The knowledge of decay times can add precious information about rates 

and hence kinetics, where a simple steady-state measurement is insufficient. An 

example is discrimination between dynamic and static quenching; dynamic quenching is 

a rate process acting on the entire excited state population, decreasing the mean decay 

time of the entire population [1,14]. 

There are several methods available for time-resolved fluorescence 

measurements such as: streak camera measurements, fluorescence upconversion, time-

correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), among others. In this work, the chosen 

method was the most widely used, TCSPC, which presents several advantages namely, 

high sensitivity with possibility of detecting very low fluorescence intensities (down to 

the single molecule level), large dynamic range, well defined statistics (Poisson) and 

intuitive data representation in the time domain [15]. 

The underlying principle of TCSPC relies on the concept that the emission 

probability of a single photon after the excitation event is equal to the intensity of 

emission of the ensemble of molecules over time. TCSPC allows measuring the arrival 

time of a fluorescent photon after excitation. After a large number of excitation cycles, a 

histogram of photon arrival times is built up [16,17].  

 

Unless otherwise stated, in the work presented in this thesis, time-resolved 

measurements used a single-photon counting apparatus equipped with a NanoLED 

excitation source emitting at 490 nm (HORIBA, Jobin Yvon, IBH Ltd. Glasgow, 

Scotland). In order to minimise deadtime effects in the electronics, the equipment 

operated in “reverse mode”, i.e. the pulse from the detector providing the START pulse 

and that from the source, providing the STOP pulse. This was necessary because of the 

high repetition rate of the LED used to excite the sample (800 KHz). The fluorescence 

emission was wavelength-selected using a 550 nm cut-off filter and detected with a 

Hamamatsu R2949 photomultiplier. The equipment layout is shown in figure 3.5.

The signal from the PMT was fed via an Ortec 265 constant fraction discriminator to an 

Ortec 567 TAC, housed in an Ortec 4001A NIM bin. The TAC output was built into a 

histogram using an Oxford Instruments PCA3 MCA card in a Pentium III (800 MHz) 

computer running Windows 2000, and data acquisition controlled using DataStation 

software from HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd. 

Very seldom the measured decays can be fitted to a single exponential. But most 

decays are, in fact, multiexponential, as found in the present work. Data analysis was 

performed with IBH DAS6 software and the goodness of fit judged in terms of a ?2 

value and weighted residuals. The decay time data were analysed by using a sum of 

exponentials, employing a nonlinear least-squares reconvolution analysis of the form

3.6. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy 

 
Fluorescence anisotropy has been used since the early 1970’s for monitoring 

molecular reorientation in solution. Improved experimental techniques and scientific 

advances e.g. in life sciences have increased the interest in these studies [16]. 

Fluorescence anisotropy describes the level of polarised emission of a fluorophore when 

excited with plane-polarised light. Following an instantaneous pulse of light, the total 

fluorescence intensity at time t is I (t) = I|| (t) + 2 (t), where I?I || and  are the 

fluorescence intensities parallel and perpendicular to the polarisation of the excitation, 

respectively. The instantaneous emission anisotropy, r (t), at that time is [4]

In practice, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements are performed by 

using linearly polarized light as the excitation source and measuring the fluorescence 

emission decays at polarizations parallel, I||(t), and perpendicular, (t), to that of the 

excitation and include a G factor so that

G corrects for the instrumental response and is the ratio of the sensitivities of the

With the equipment used in the experiments described in this thesis, G was 1. 

Furthermore, the fluorescence anisotropy decay can be related to the rotational mobility 

of a spherical molecule using the expression

where r0 is the anisotropy observed at t = 0 and ?r is the rotational correlation time of the

In the case that the angular range of the rotational motion is limited (hindered rotation), 

the anisotropy will never decay to zero and a residual anisotropy will be observed at 

times comparatively longer than the fluorescence lifetime. The anisotropy is than

“wobble-in-cone” model [4,21] the rotations in anisotropic media of a rod-like 

fluorophore are restricted to a cone. The rotational motions are described by the 

rotational diffusion around an axis perpendicular to the long molecular axis and an 

ordered parameter which is the half–angle of a cone, ?. Rotation beyond this angle is

3.7. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) 

 
Photobleaching is the light-induced irreversible conversion of a fluorescent 

molecule into a non-fluorescent entity. The exact mechanism of photobleaching of 

organic dyes is complex and/or mostly unknown. In many cases, the excited triplet state 

and several intermediates are involved. A common cause of photodamage is the 

oxidation of the dye by singlet oxygen or even water if the experiments are done in 

aqueous solution.  Most fluorophores can repeat the excitation and emission cycle many 

hundreds to thousands of times before the highly reactive excited state molecule is 

photobleached. This ability is dependent upon the molecular structure and the local 

environment. For instance, photobleaching increases with temperature because more 

reaction pathways become activated [22-24].  

 

Experiments with Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) started 

almost 40 years ago to observe the lateral mobility of proteins and lipids in living cells 

[25]. Since then many studies have been successfully done employing the technique as a 

valuable tool to study diffusion in other environments than biological, namely polymer 

solutions and gels [26-28]. In FRAP experiments fluorescent molecules are 

photobleached by a high-power laser beam focused in the region of interest of the 

sample. Immediately after photobleaching an attenuated light beam measures the 

diffusion of fluorescent molecules back into the bleached area from outside the 

irradiation zone. The intensity increases as the number of unbleached probes reaches the 

bleached area and a plot of intensity versus time is then obtained. Figure 3.6 shows a 

typical FRAP curve. FRAP measurements require a microscope to image the sample.

gives a final intensity of F?.

 

Two parameters can be deduced from the graph: 

a) The intensity of fluorescence after recovery in relation to the initial intensity. 

This is known as the mobile fraction, R,  and is defined as 

 

R = (F?-F0) / (F1-F0) x 100    (3.17) 

 

where F1 is the intensity before bleaching, F0 the intensity just after bleaching 

and F? the intensity after full recovery. These regions are shown in figure 3.6. 

 

b)  The rate of mobility or how quickly the molecules diffuse back into the 

bleached area. If a steep curve is found, there is a fast recovery. The mobility is 

expressed as Dt, the diffusion coefficient, which is related to the diffusion time, 

?D. 

 

The diffusion time, ?D can be calculated by finding the time it takes for the fluorescence 

to recover to half of its final value, ?1/2. The half time can be established by fitting the 

recovery data to a curve of the form [29] 

 

CeAtI kt +?= ? )1()(      (3.18) 

 

 45



Where I is the fluorescence intensity, A is the final plateau intensity after recovery 

minus the initial intensity after bleaching i.e. (F? - F0 ), C is F0 and k is a time constant 

(?1/2= ln 2/k). The half time, ?1/2 is related to ?D by a factor ?D which takes into account 

the recovery during the bleaching process. In the case of a circular beam ?D = 0.88 such 

that [25]

As is evident, FRAP provides complementary information to time-resolved 

anisotropy measurements, used to calculate viscosity where rotational diffusion is 

probed instead of translational diffusion. 

 

 

 

3.8. Synchronous Scan Fluorescence Spectroscopy 

 
Synchronous Scan Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SFS) is a methodology 

developed for multicomponent analysis and simple routine based applications by Tuan 

Vo-Dinh, although the idea of synchronous excitation luminescence is attributed to 

Lloyd, 1971 [30]. The applications of the method include the determination of 

polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, qualitative and quantitative analysis (for 

environmental monitoring or drugs screening)[31-37]. 

 

 46



The synchronous fluorescence signal can be understood either as an emission 

spectrum with synchronously scanned excitation wavelength or as an excitation 

spectrum with synchronously scanned emission wavelength [30,38].  The SFS implies 

simultaneously varying both the excitation wavelength (?exc) and the emission 

wavelength (?em) while keeping a constant interval (??) between them. The 

synchronous fluorescence intensity, Is is given by the expression [30] 

 

)()( ??? ?+= exmexcxs EKcdEI     (3.21) 

 

where Ex is the excitation function at the wavelength ?exc, Eem is the emission intensity at 

the wavelength ?em (normal emission spectrum), c is the analyte concentration, d is the 

thickness of the sample and k an experimental constant factor. The maximum intensity 

with the narrowest half-width is obtained when ?? corresponds to the difference 

between the wavelengths of absorption and emission maxima. SFS presents three major 

advantages over conventional fluorescence spectrometry: narrowing of spectral bands, 

simplification of emission spectra and reduction of the spectral range (figure 3.7)  [30].

FLUORESCENT PROBES USED IN THIS STUDY  

 
4.1. Introduction 

 
Fluorescent dyes have an immense range of applications as reporters for structural 

changes in proteins and other molecules, measuring different parameters in micro-

heterogeneous systems or just as tags for analysis and sorting [1]. Choosing the 

appropriate fluorescent probe depends on the system to be monitored as well as 

techniques to be employed. Sensitivity, selectivity, calibration method, labelling 

technique and the fluorescence spectral properties, are certainly important criteria when 

choosing a fluorescent indicator [2]. Biological material is itself fluorescent. In proteins, 

the intrinsic fluorescence is mainly due to the aromatic amino acid residues of 

tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.  The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the 

jellyfish Aequorea victoria contains a built-in chromophore formed by the cyclization 

and oxidation of a sequence of amino acids (Serine – Tyrosine – Glycine). Today, GFP is 

one of the most widely studied and exploited proteins in biochemistry and cell biology 

[3]. 

There are, however, some adversities which make extrinsic labelling preferable to 

the amino acid fluorescence study. First, in terms of time-resolved measurements, the 

photophysics of tryptophan is complicated and the origin of its fluorescence decay is 

 53



ambiguous. Second, most proteins have more than one tryptophan residue, further 

complicating this scenario [4,5]. Also, the fluorescence quantum yield of phenylalanine is 

very low (0.022 in aqueous solution) and, in the case of tyrosine, its fluorescence is often 

quenched by the neighbouring tryptophan residues [1]. In this work, extrinsic labelling 

was preferred, not only because of the mentioned reasons, but also because the proteins 

were monitored encapsulated within sol-gel media where scattered excitation light may 

be problematic.  

 

This chapter focuses on the fluorescent probes utilised, which were chosen on the 

basis of their particular properties to monitor the sol-gel reaction (the sol to gel transition 

and the aging process), to assess interactions between the host and guest molecules, and 

to elucidate conformational changes of the encapsulated proteins. Characterisation of 

both the host environment and guest conformation is important, as the matrix is intended 

to be protective to the enzyme and simultaneously allow access to substrate molecules. 

Only if these conditions are fulfilled can the entrapped biomolecule exercise its catalytic 

function. With this in mind, the probe 7-diethylamino-3,4-benzophenoxazine-2-one (Nile 

red) was selected to monitor both the host polarity and changes in protein conformation 

[6-8]. The dye 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI), was 

chosen to assess the internal host viscosity [9-12]. A preliminary study was performed to 

examine the photophysics of these two probes in homogeneous solution. The outcome is 

discussed in this chapter after a brief introduction to the mechanism by which they 

unravel the dynamics of the hybrid sol-gel systems. 

Fluorescein was chosen to perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 

(FRAP) measurements, and Alexafluor 488 was selected to make a complementary study, 

because of its resistance to photobleaching. The derivative of fluorescein, fluorescein 

isothyocyanate (FITC) and Alexafluor 488 are both well used dyes for protein labelling 

[13-18]. Their photophysical properties are well characterised in the supplier’s manual 

[19] and both of them were utilised according to the protocol provided by the 

manufacturer.

4.2. DASPMI 

 
Stilbenoid dyes are promising in that their photophysical properties are very 

sensitive to solvent viscosity [33]. The dye 4-(4- (dimethylamino)styryl)-N-

methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI) has been commonly used to study cellular processes 

[34,35] and its decay time found to be dependent on viscosity with its multiple 

fluorescence ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer [9,11]. Its properties were also 

exploited to provide an insight into the changes that occur in the sol to gel transition 

[10,36]. 

The fluorescence of DASPMI is complex and has been related to the formation of 

charge transfer states and associated conformational change with possibility of reaching 

the Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) state. The “TICT” model was 

suggested by Lyppert et al. and later pushed forward by Grabowski and co-workers to 

explain the dual fluorescence of the probe 4N,N-dimethylaminobenzonitrile (DMABN) 

in polar solvents.  The model is included in the area of adiabatic photoreactions which 

occur on the hypersurface of the lowest (singlet or triplet) exited state. When this state is 

energetically very close to the ground state, the molecule can twist providing an efficient 

and fast non radiative transition to the ground state [23]. Depending on the motion, these 

molecules require a specific reaction volume in order to take place; the smaller the 

volume required, more easily the reaction occurs (figure 4.1).

intramolecular charge transfer) sate. The typical TICT probe starts from a planar state geometry in the 

Franck-Condon excited state, with partial charge separation. As solvent relaxation occurs, the acceptor 

moiety assists rotating towards a perpendicular conformation with full charge separation between the donor 

and the acceptor. Adapted from [24].  

 55



The surrounding medium strongly influences the degree of the intramolecular 

motion enabling  molecular rotors to be employed as fluorescent probes to characterise it 

in terms of micropolarity and microviscosity [25-28]. The twisting motion in the TICT 

mechanism can be easily hindered at very high viscosity conditions and rotors with 

various rotating moieties can be used as free-volume probes. Free volume effects derive 

from the discontinuous nature of matter which is composed by molecules of diverse sizes 

and shapes. The free space between these molecules provides an extra possibility for 

movement, especially in biological membranes and solvents, which are highly dynamic 

systems. Sometimes, it happens that the microviscosity or effective viscosity probed by a 

molecular rotor is inferior to the bulk viscosity because of free volume effects [24]. 

The emission of DASPMI (figure 4.2), in general, consists of three distinct decay 

times with emission from the planar form (state A in scheme II) and the possible 

consecutive population of other states (B and C) via charge transfer and bond twisting:

Figure 4.2 The fluorescent probe DASPMI and its fluorescent states. 
 

This bond twisting (as the origin of the observed fluorescence) is restricted to single 

bonds, as the energy for a double bond mechanism is prohibitive under normal conditions 

[11] and work investigating the role of twisting in this class of molecule, showing the 

effect of inhibiting certain rotations, has confirmed single bond twisting as the dominant 

 56



mechanism with a lack of isomerism [9]. As solvent viscosity increases the ability to 

rotate is reduced causing a reduction in the non radiative pathways, hence producing an 

increase in the observed fluorescence lifetime.  

 

 

4.2.1. Experimental characterisation of DASPMI 

 
4.2.1.1. Materials and methods 

 

The dye p-DASPMI was purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitogen SA) and 

glycerol from Riedel-de Haën. Fluorescence quantum yields, ?F, in solution were 

determined relative to p-DASPMI in ethanol, reported to be 0.008 by Rettig and Strehmel 

[9]. The optically dilute method was adopted [37], and correction for the spectral 

response of the equipment was also made. Time-resolved measurements were performed 

as described in sections 3.5. and 3.6. The rotational correlation time, ?r, was calculated 

using equation 3.13. 

 

4.2.1.2. Results and discussion 

 

The photophysics of DASPMI was studied in water-glycerol mixtures, containing 

different percentages of glycerol. Such mixtures were considered appropriate models 

because glycerol possesses several OH groups and water is a relevant species in the 

synthesis of the sol-gel hybrids. All emission spectra, obtained upon excitation at 490 nm, 

showed one broad maximum centred at 600 nm and no structure. All decays were found 

to be multiexponential, in agreement with previous work [9,11,33]. Table 4.1 shows the 

results from the analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence data.

Table 4.1. Time-resolved fluorescence decay parameters of DASPMI in glycerol-water mixtures. 

 

According to Rettig et al. [11], the multiple fluorescence emission is related to different 

states: a planar excited state, originating directly from the S0 ? S1 transition, to which 

the lowest lifetime is ascribed (?1); a second emitting state, planar and most probably with 

a significant charge-transfer character (?2); and a third, a twisted intramolecular charge-

transfer excited state (TICT sate), associated with the longest lifetime component (?3). 

Under the experimental conditions of this study, components ?1 and ?2 dominate the 

observed decays. Only minute contributions ascribed to ?3 could be found, with negligible 

physical significance. These results indicate that, most probably, the solvent cage 

surrounding the excited dye molecule may hinder the twisting of the molecule, thus 

precluding the formation of the TICT state. The “rigidity” of the solvent cage is a 

consequence of the hydrogen bonds that occur between the glycerol molecules and 

glycerol-water molecules [38]. This hypothesis is supported by arguments further 

presented in this section, when discussing the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data. 

The average emission lifetime for each sample was obtained from the analysis of the 

respective fluorescence decay, according to equation 3.9. The radiative (kf) and 

nonradiative (knr) rate constants for DASPMI were then obtained from the well-known 

equations

These data show that a significant decrease of knr is observed with the increase in the

n-alcohols [9]. Also, it is of importance to examine the correlation between the medium’s 

viscosity and knr, through the phenomenological (empirical) relationship [40].

This result indicates that the macroscopic viscosity is not appropriate to describe the 

microenvironment probed by DASPMI. In fact the free volume of the solvent mixture 

becomes a relevant parameter and thus the probe senses the solvent as a discontinuous 

medium [40]. This behaviour is understandable since the characteristic dimensions of the 

probe are most probably comparable to the mean free path in the host media. The 

approximate volume of DASPMI, as calculated using Hyperchem 7 software, is 

estimated to be on the order of 240 Å3. A realistic approach to the hydrodynamics of 

DASPMI was obtained from time-resolved anisotropy measurements, performed as 

described in the previous chapter (section 3.4). 

Table 4.3 shows the measured rotational correlation times (?r) and the initial 

anisotropy (r0). The limiting anisotropy (r?) was assumed to be zero throughout. The 

values found for r0 indicate that a significant part of the initial decay is observed. 

However, the fact that the values of ?r are somewhat longer than the fluorescence 

lifetimes (?f) precluded the measurement of the complete r(t) decay function.

and are thought to be more suitable to describe the local environment probed by DASPMI 

in each solution. All values found for VH were substantially higher than the approximate 

volume of DASPMI (~240 Å3). These values show that the probe is associated with 

solvent molecules (either glycerol or water). The positive charge of the dye molecule 

facilitates its interaction with the solvent molecules, thus promoting the “binding of a 

solvent cage” to each DASPMI molecule, which rotates along with the dye.

4.3. Nile red 

 
The term solvatochromism was introduced by Hantzsch (1857-1935) in the 

beginning of the last century to express the phenomenon by which, UV/visible/near-IR 

absorption spectra of molecules were influenced by the surrounding medium, in terms of 

position, intensity, and shape of the absorption bands. The suggestion that solvatochromic 

dyes could be used as visual indicators for solvent polarity was initially made by Brooker 

et al. (from Eastman  Kodak Company) in 1951 [20]. Nonetheless, examples of their 

practical use can be found prior to that date. For example, dyes of the Nile Blue group 

were utilised as indicator standards to the detection and semi-quantitative estimation of 

acids in airplane motor fuels and lubricants [21]. Spectroscopic probes, however, can 

measure not only the polarity of liquids, but also that of solids, glasses and surfaces.  

Nile red (figure 4.4) is a neutral, hydrophobic, and highly solvatochromic dye 

which has been extensively applied to examine the structure, environment, and dynamics 

of biological samples and micro-heterogeneous media. Although nearly insoluble and 

non-fluorescent in water, it has a very high partition coefficient from water to 

hydrophobic solvents, where it fluoresces strongly [8,41-48].

Figure 4.4. Structure of the fluorescent probe Nile red.

 

Nile red shows a positive solvatochromism, meaning that it undergoes a 

bathochromic shift both in absorption and in fluorescence spectrum with increasing 

solvent polarity. The dramatic solvatochromic effect is attributed to the high dipole 

moment of the molecule in the ground state, which is even higher during the excited 

state.  The large shift has been explained through charge separation between the 

 62



diethylamino group which acts as a donor, and the quinoid system which acts as acceptor, 

with the possibility of the formation of a twisted intramolecular charge transfer state 

(TICT) [6,49-51]. Still, two different groups have published theoretical and experimental 

work where the TICT hypothesis is negated; one referring as an evidence the negligible 

effect of viscosity on the photophysical properties of the probe, the other a low value for 

the difference between excited-state and ground-state dipole moments, reported as being 

incompatible with the formation of a TICT sate [52,53]. The fluorescence spectra of Nile 

red in organic solvents, is also suggestive of hydrogen bonding effects. This property is 

visible when probing biphasic or biological systems  [53-58]. 

Nile red has previously been used to monitor the conformation of horseradish 

peroxidase upon incorporation into a silica sol-gel derived host [59]. This was achieved 

by spectral decomposition of the fluorescence, showing that the probe experienced 

different environments within the enzyme, each with a different critical Förster distance 

for energy transfer [60]. This thesis will concentrate on the fact that synchronous scan 

fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) can be used to differentiate between different probes, or 

the same probe in different environments, and employ it with Nile red. In solution the 

band position was found to depend on the polarity and influenced by the effect of 

hydrogen bonding. The combination of Nile red and SFS will be employed to elucidate 

changes in protein conformation, as well as changes within the host during the aging 

process. 

 

 

4.3.1. Experimental characterisation of Nile red 

 
4.3.1.1. Materials and methods 

 

Nile red was from Molecular Probes and the solvents were either from Sigma, 

Aldrich or Fluka. The equipment used to measure Nile red spectra was described in 

chapter 3. The solvatochromic properties were observed by SFS in homogeneous 

solution. 

 

 63



4.3.1.2. Results and discussion 

 

In this study, Nile red solvatochromic properties are reported for a large range of 

solvents, from hexane to THF. Initially three different wavelength offsets were employed, 

as shown in figure 4.4 for three solvents. In a solvent of low polarity, such as hexane, the 

greater offset spectrum is more structured, because of the vibrational features present in 

both the normal absorption and emission spectra [61]. This structure decreases with a 

reduction of the offset between the excitation and emission wavelengths and is lost when 

an offset of 10 nm is used. In higher polarity media, all the spectra at the three different 

offsets exhibit a Gaussian band shape. This is not surprising as the normal absorption and 

emission spectra do not exhibit vibrational structure. It should be noted that the feature 

(small band) situated at 650 nm is present throughout and hence may relate to an artefact 

and thus will be ignored for the purpose of this work.

 64



A compromise offset of 20 nm was chosen for a larger study as it indicates whether the 

spectra possess any vibrational structure, while producing an easily identifiable peak. 

Figure 4.6 shows the spectra of Nile red in various solvents and figure 4.7 is a plot of the 

respective peak wavelength against the solvent dielectric constant. The observed trend is 

in accordance with studies using the Nile red fluorescence emission [62,63]. Therefore, in 

adopting SFS of Nile red with the 20 nm offset, it is possible to obtain an “easy to use 

local polarity sensor”. Figure 4.7 clearly shows a relationship between the peak position 

of the synchronous scan spectrum and the dielectric constant of the solvent used. As 

expected, the behaviour in alcohols (shown by open symbols) is different [53] and a red 

shift is observed for this class of solvents in comparison to the others of similar dielectric 

constant. It is notable that using this technique, small changes in relatively low values of 

dielectric constant produce a relatively large change in spectral position. However, it 

should be noted that a constant wavelength offset is used, as the apparatus does not allow 

the use of a constant energy offset set up. At higher values of dielectric constant (greater 

than 10) smaller peak shifts are observed. In summary, these data provide an expedient 

means by which to detect changes in dielectric constant and to assess the contribution of 

hydrogen bonding in the measured spectral shifts, over a range of polarities pertinent to 

the present system.

In summary, these results show that SFS applied to Nile red solvatochromism is a 

promising strategy to study changes in local polarity, when examining sol-gel derived 

media, as will be shown later. 

 

 

 

4.4. Fluorescein, FITC and Alexa Fluor 488 

 
Fluorescein is the most widely used green fluorescent dye. This is because of its 

large molar absorptivity at the wavelength of the commonly used Argon ion laser (488 

nm spectral line) and its high fluorescence quantum yield. Fluorescein is commercially 

available in many derivatives, such as fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC). It is also 

susceptible to photobleaching which makes it a good probe for carrying out fluorescence 

recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. Alexa Fluor 488 is a similar probe 

in its fluorescence properties and it is also efficiently excited by the 488 laser line of the 

 66



Argon ion laser. It is made by the sulfonation of dyes like rhodamine or fluorescein to 

become charged and hydrophilic. It also has a high quantum yield when coupled to 

proteins [29-32]. The structure of fluorescein, FITC and Alexa Fluor 488 can be seen in 

figure 4.8.

Chapter 5 

 

HYBRID MATRIX MANUFACTURE AND 

CHARACTERISATION 

 
5.1. Introduction 

 
The encapsulation of enzymes in sol-gel-derived media provides a form of 

immobilization (important for reuse, cost, and environmental factors) while allowing 

accessibility so that the enzyme can continue to function as a biocatalyst. This 

procedure can be followed using spectroscopic means and the incorporated protein 

monitored by either making use of intrinsic protein fluorescence or extrinsic probes. 

The latter are advantageous as they can be chosen for their selectivity. Previous work 

has shown that encapsulation within a sol-gel-derived medium can restrict protein 

mobility, although the doping biomolecules can serve as a template for silicate [1-3]. It 

is therefore important to gain an understanding of guest-host interactions to enable the 

encapsulated biomolecule to exhibit its natural form and behaviour. 

Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy [4] and fluorescence recovery after 

photobleaching (FRAP) [5] are appropriate techniques with which to obtain information 

concerning the mobility of the encapsulated biomolecule. FRAP probes the translational 

diffusion, whereas time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements probe 

rotational diffusion. The discrimination between translational and rotational diffusion 

has yielded an insight into protein association in viscous media [6] and, the particular 

combination of FRAP and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements have 

 75



previously been employed, for example, in the study of the rheological properties of cell 

cytoplasm using green fluorescent protein [7]. However, to our knowledge, FRAP has 

been scantily applied to the study of sol-gel-derived media. In this chapter experimental 

results which have helped to clarify the diffusion process within sol-gel derived media 

will be presented, employing these techniques with selected fluorescent probes and 

biomolecules. 

In order to assess molecular mobility within the host two biomolecules, 

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), both labelled with the 

fluorescent probe fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) which has known photobleaching 

properties, were encapsulated in sol-gel matrices. The fluorophore itself was used 

unbound as representative of an enzymatic substrate.  The enzyme HRP was also 

covalently labelled with the highly photostable probe Alexa Fluor 488 (AF) to ascertain, 

both the distribution of the biomolecules and their rotational diffusion within the 

matrices. This was accomplished using a confocal microscope [8,9]. The mobility of the 

biomolecules during the aging process was monitored via fluorescence lifetime, time-

resolved anisotropy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 

measurements [10]. 

Furthermore, adjustment of the original sol-gel recipe was attempted in order to 

obtain a more efficient system where the encapsulated biomolecule could express its 

biological function in full. This resulted in the manufacture of organically modified 

silica matrices (ORMOSILS) and interpenetrating polymer network matrices (IPN), 

achieved through the incorporation of either the silanes (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane 

(APTES), trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) or (glycidyloxypropyl)triethoxysilane 

(GPTES), or  the polymers poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG20k, PEG300) and Gelrite® 

(GR). The chosen silanes have hydrophobic functionalities and were added to promote 

the biocompatibility, as the enhanced hydrophobic character of the matrices should 

preserve the protein folding [11,12].  The polymers were added because of the proven 

capability of pore templating which should help to control the flow of materials through 

the sol-gel composites [3,13]. The effect of these modifiers upon the gelation and aging 

processes was examined via time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence measurements 

of the of the probes 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridiniumiodine (DASPMI) 

and Nile red. DASPMI was used to elucidate changes in viscosity and Nile red to report 

on changes in polarity. 

 76



5.2. Monitoring gelation and initial aging phases 

 
5.2.1. Materials and methods 
 

The matrices were prepared based on the method presented by Flora and Brennan 

[14] in the form of a monolith using a standard 10 mm path length plastic cuvette for a 

mould. The sol was made by mixing 9 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (Aldrich) 

with 3 ml of water containing 0.2 ml of 0.01 M HCl. This mixture was placed in an 

ultrasonic bath for 1 h before being placed in a freezer (-18 °C) for about a month. The 

matrices were produced by taking 2 ml of the sol and mixing it with 2 ml of pH 6, 7 or 8 

phosphate buffer solutions containing the fluorophore DASPMI. No additional silanes 

or polymers were used here, so the monoliths produced are purely inorganic. 

Fluorescence measurements and data analysis were described in chapter 3. 

 

 

5.2.2. Results and Discussion 
 

Since the objective of producing these matrices is the incorporation of proteins, 

buffer solutions with different pH values (pH 6, 7, and 8) were used in order to ascertain 

the effect of this factor on the gelation process (figure 5.1). The emission spectra of 

DASPMI, in all three buffer solutions were identical to the spectrum of DASPMI in 

water, measured under the same instrumental conditions. In fact, all spectra were 

structureless, highly symmetrical, and centred at 600 nm. The pH values were also 

restricted to a range so as not to protonate DASPMI, since this can lead to spectral 

changes [15,16]. Figure 5.1 shows the relative fluorescence intensity of DASPMI as a 

function of time, during the gelation and initial aging processes. The intensity of the 

DASPMI emission (under the same conditions) for different glycerol-water mixtures 

(percent glycerol shown) is indicated as dashed lines. These results show that samples 

produced using higher pHs are more viscous. Moreover, the relative intensity of the 

emission suffers a drastic increase during the gelation process, for pH=7 and pH=8 

solutions.

state emission. Excitation was at 490nm with emission monitored at 600nm. The intensity of DASPMI 

emission (under the same conditions) for different glycerol-water mixtures (% glycerol shown) are 

indicated by the dashed lines. 

 

The observed enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield is in agreement with the 

results obtained with water-glycerol mixtures and also with the work of Strehmel and 

Rettig [17]. These authors have reported a significant increase in fluorescence intensity 

and emission lifetime of o-DASPMI upon an increase in solvent viscosity. More 

recently, Ramadass and Bereiter-Hahn [18] observed a drastic increase in the emission 

lifetimes of o-DASPMI with an increase of solvent viscosity. 

In all subsequent studies pH 7 was adopted in conformity with the requisites of the 

encapsulated biomolecules.

Enzyme Labelling. 

For the first set of measurements, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [CE 1.11.1.7][10] 

from Sigma, MW = 44,000 [19] was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF) and then 

 78



purified following the provided protocol using a Molecular Probes Alexa Fluor 488 

protein labelling kit (A-10235) from Invitrogen S.A. The molecular weight of Alexa 

Fluor 488 is ca.885. Fluorescein (MW 332) was from Sigma-Aldrich. 

In a second phase, HRP and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MW ca.67000) were 

labelled with fluorescein isothiocianate (FITC) (MW = 389.38) and then purified to 

exclude any uncoupled dye, following the provided protocol and using a Fluoro Tag 

FITC conjunction kit (Sigma). The labelling ratio was approximately 1:1. The size of 

FITC is similar to fluorescein which has a radius of 0.54 nm [10], whereas HRP has a 

radius of 1.5 nm and BSA a radius of 3.5 nm [20,21]. Sol–gel derived media to 

incorporate the proteins were produced by taking 2 ml of sol (prepared as described in 

the previous section) and mixing it with 2 ml of buffer solution containing the labelled 

BSA or HRP or fluorophore. The gels were stored in a refrigerator (at 4 °C) and after 

approximately 12 h it was possible to remove them from their moulds (standard 10mm 

pathlength plastic cuvette). They were then rinsed with distilled water and allowed to 

warm up to room temperature before the measurements. 

 

Measurements and Analysis 

Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using the equipment 

mentioned in chapter 3. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of FITC 

labelled biomolecules, were made using a 470 nm laser diode excitation source (PLP-10 

470, Hamamatsu, optical pulse width 90 ps) pulsed at 20MHz and coupled with a 

fluorescence lifetime imaging system (Becker &amp;amp; Hickl TCSPC system using a SPC 830 

card). The laser beam was passed through a prism to spatially separate the 470 nm from 

a weak green laser emission around 500 nm and subsequently coupled into the scanhead 

using a 485 nm dichroic beamsplitter. The fluorescence decays were measured 

sequentially at polarisations parallel and perpendicular to that of the excitation beam. 

The fluorescence was collected through a 525 nm interference filter (50 nm bandpass) 

for 20 s in each polarization in 256 time channels. These measurements were performed 

at the Physics Department, King’s College London. 

Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of Alexa Fluor 488, were 

made using equipment mentioned in chapter 3. For the analysis, the “wobble in cone” 

model was employed and the cone angle ? calculated using equation 3.16, which has 

been successfully applied in polymer systems [22]. The rotational correlation time was 

calculated through the Stokes-Einstein relation expressed in equation 3.13. Theoretical 

 79



calculations of the volumes were obtained from the qualitative structure activity 

relationships (QSAR) computation using Hyperchem 7 software on geometrically 

optimised molecular structures (using a PM3 model for the dyes or AMBER for HRP) 

[23]. 

FRAP measurements of fluorescein in sol-gel medium were performed using an 

inverted confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2) with a x63 water immersion objective 

and 488 nm excitation from an argon ion laser. To obtain FRAP curves, five initial 

intensity images were taken over an area of 288 µm2, at 2 s intervals. The laser power 

was then increased and an area of approximately 1002 µm2 was photobleached. The 

fluorescence recovery of this area was monitored by reducing the laser power and 

recording images every 5 s for 200 s (512 x 512 pixels, 400 Hz line scan rate). 

Regarding the matrices doped with biomolecules (labelled with FITC), confocal 

microscopy was performed using the confocal microscope with a x20 objective 

(numerical aperture NA=0.5), with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit (102 µm) yielding an 

optical section of approximately 2 µm. The excitation source was the same, coupled into 

the scanhead using a RSP500 dichroic beamsplitter. In order to obtain the FRAP 

measurements initial intensity images were taken over an area of 750 µm2 for 1.6 s. The 

laser power was then increased and a spot approximately 40 µm in diameter was 

photobleached for 1.6 s. The fluorescence recovery of this area was monitored by 

reducing the laser power (20% that of the bleach intensity) and recording images every 

1.6 s for about 1 minute. In both cases, the recovery curves obtained were corrected by 

selecting a sample region away from the bleached region of interest and thus obtaining 

fluorescence intensity vs. time curve (control curve) and dividing the raw recovery 

curve by it.  The time taken for the recovery to reach half of the final intensity, ?1/2, was 

calculated from fitting the recovery to a curve of the form expressed in equation 3.18 

using Microcal Origin software. The translational diffusion coefficient Dt was 

calculated from equation 3.19. All FRAP measurements were performed at the Physics 

Department, King’s College London.

5.3.2. Results and discussion 

 
Dye-Enzyme Interaction in solution 

After the coupling reaction and purification, fractions containing the dye-enzyme 

conjugate (AF-HRP) and the uncoupled dye (AF), were obtained. Both steady state and 

time-resolved measurements were performed for both AF-HRP and AF in solution prior 

to incorporation into the sol-gel-derived media. The spectra of the species are shown in 

figure 5.2.

uncoupled AF (dotted line) for comparison. Inset is the structure of AF. 

 

 

On coupling, a slight red shift is observed in both the absorption and fluorescence 

spectra of AF, as shown in table 5.1. The time-resolved data showed a more discernible 

change going from monoexponential decay to biexponential decay for the AF-HRP 

conjugate. Here the difference was the emergence of a small contribution of a shorter-

lived component. The origin of this component may relate to the covalent linkage and 

possibly to the local amino acid residues.

Another difference was noted in the time-resolved anisotropy data; for uncoupled AF, 

as expected, a very fast rotational time (0.25 ns), close to the resolution of our 

equipment, was observed. This is similar to that obtained using equation 3.13 with V 

calculated from the QSAR properties for AF (assuming a viscosity of 0.89 cP and 

temperature of 300 K), which returned 0.30 ns. The anisotropy decay obtained for the 

AF-HRP conjugate required two rotational correlation times to provide an acceptable 

fit. The shorter one we attribute to the dye rotation, while the longer one reflects the 

motion of the whole of the enzyme. A similar trend has been previously reported [24]. 

Our calculation of this rotational time returned a close value of 6.5 ns. As the r? value 

does not go to zero, this implies a small degree of hindrance (cone angle of 74° 

according to equation 3.16), which is not surprising as the AF is covalently bound to the 

enzyme. As the hindrance is small, it is indicative that AF most likely binds to the 

exterior of the protein. To verify this, a quenching study using potassium iodide (KI) 

was performed. The effect of the quencher on the steady-state fluorescence is shown in 

figure 5.3.

Figure 5.3. Change in steady state fluorescence intensities (I) of AF and AF-HRP in solution on addition 

of potassium iodide (KI). The line depicts a simple fit to the Stern-Volmer equation for the AF-HRP data. 
 

The plot shows that at lower quencher concentrations there is little difference between 

the unbound and bound AF. A Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 21.7 M-1 was 

obtained from the slope of the line represented in the figure [25]. At higher 

concentrations of KI there is an upward trend in the data, which may signify the 

presence of processes other than a straightforward dynamic quenching mechanism. This 

is not surprising considering the charged nature of the quencher. However, the 

similarity of the curves at low quencher concentration supports the of the probe attached 

to the exterior of the enzyme. 

 

Diffusion within sol-gel derived media 

Time-resolved anisotropy measurements were performed on the AF-HRP 

conjugate encapsulated into a sol-gel matrix over a period of time in which the sample 

changed from a solid gel to a glassy robust matrix, occupying about 1/8 of the volume 

of the initial gel. Confocal microscopy showed the distribution of the encapsulated 

enzyme within the matrix to be uniform. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy 

measurements were made to provide a means by which to monitor the enzyme’s 

rotational mobility. Figure 5.4 illustrates the change in rotational correlation time, ?r, 

with aging time.

Figure 5.4. Rotational correlation times for AF bound to HRP, both before and after incorporation into a 

sol-gel derived monolith. The open symbols relate to the rotation of the entire enzyme, while the closed 

symbols are ascribed to the probe’s own rotation. 

 

On incorporation there is an initial increase in the rotational correlation time probably 

because of a raised viscosity as the matrix gels. After that, as the pore structure starts to 

form, the value returns close to that of the conjugate in solution. These data indicate 

that, although the matrix network is contracting, the local environment of the enzyme is 

comparatively stable, unlike that encountered in another study [1]. It should be noted 

that a slight decrease in the cone angle was observed, dropping to ca. 53° after 7 days 

and dropping by another few degrees over the remaining period. This may indicate 

slight changes in the enzyme conformation, in agreement with previous studies reported 

by our group [26] or that the enzyme is experiencing a viscosity close to that in solution, 

but with some mobility restriction imposed by the host. Over the same time period the 

fluorescence lifetime data exhibited little variation from the corresponding data in 

solution, thus reinforcing the suitability of this system. 

 

Although the enzyme appears free to rotate within the pore, it is important to 

ascertain if it is also free to relocate within the matrix and importantly, if it is to be 

catalytically active, accessible to its substrate. In order to verify this, FRAP 

measurements using a confocal microscope were performed with fluorescein (Fs) 

incorporated in the same type of sol-gel-derived monolith. FRAP has previously been 

used to characterize sol-gel-produced matrices, where dyes were found to diffuse only if 

 84



the matrices were hydrated [27]. The results from the FRAP measurements are given in 

table 5.2.

From these measurements the translational diffusion coefficient with aging time was 

calculated and is depicted in figure 5.5. In terms of diffusion, this is the inverse of what 

is seen from the rotational information, as shown in figure 5.6.

Figure 5.6. Comparison of the sensed viscosity obtained using FRAP measurements of Fs and anisotropy

An explanation for this is that the rotational diffusion provides information concerning 

the pore environment, while the translation diffusion gives information relating to 

interconnections between pores; the enhancement in viscosity sensed by AF means that 

the network shrinks with time (see figure 5.7). Thus, the two sets of measurements 

(FRAP and time resolved anisotropy) are complementary in following the changes in 

matrix morphology.

Figure 5.7. Depiction of the percentage change in weight of a sol-gel derived matrix with time, when 

kept at 4ºC. 

 

It should be emphasised that we are looking at the average behaviour of many Fs 

molecules. Work at the single molecule level has elucidated that the pore size is 

important on the diffusion within sol-gel derived monoliths, once two different 

components relating to mobility were found; one in gels with a pore diameter of about 3 

nm, and the other in gels with pores of about 22 nm [28,29]. In comparison to that work, 

 86



the diffusion coefficients presented above are several orders of magnitude greater than 

those found for a silica gel with pores ca. 22 nm in diameter and using a larger probe 

molecule. Nevertheless, the rotational diffusion of the enzyme hints that there is no 

significant interaction with the pore. Most probably HRP efficiently templates the pore 

size of its host, hence, the pores inhabited by the biomolecule should be significantly 

larger than its own dimensions [22].  

The photostability of Alexa Fluor 488 limits its usefulness in FRAP 

measurements, where a fluorescein derivative, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 

proved advantageous. Three sol–gel derived hosts were monitored with aging time by 

means of FRAP and fluorescence anisotropy measurements with the aim of examining 

lateral and rotational diffusional of macromolecules, respectively. The samples were 

produced as follows: one monolith containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), a 

second one doped with bovine serum albumine (BSA) labelled with FITC (FITC-BSA) 

and a third one doped with HRP labelled with FITC (FITC-HRP). The FRAP 

measurements are given in figure 5.8. Typical confocal images for the prebleach, bleach 

and one minute after bleaching of each sample are also displayed, as are the relative 

sizes of the dopant molecules.

within the sol-gel derived host are also shown (for clarity only the backbone structure is given). 

 87



Regarding FITC-BSA sample, negligible recovery was observed after bleaching, 

indicating that the pore interconnections were already smaller than the dimensions of 

the protein, one day after encapsulation. Subsequent measurements confirmed that 

rotational motion had, in fact, ceased and that the pore size was at least comparable to 

that of BSA. The corresponding time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements 

showed that the protein was barely able to rotate (figure 5.9).

Figure 5.9. Anisotropy decays for day 2, 9 and 12 days respectively, after making sol-gel for all 3 

samples. 

In the case of FITC-HRP sample, the amount of photobleaching observed was 

comparatively less and a partial recovery in the fluorescence was seen. Ten days later 

the recovery was no longer observed, indicating that the interconnections between the 

pores were probably with a size such as to limit the lateral diffusion of this enzyme. No 

noticeable lateral diffusion was observed after 12 days. Time-resolved fluorescence 

anisotropy results show significant rotational freedom which decreases with time (figure 

5.9). This is in good agreement with prior measurements using Alexa Fluor 488 labelled 

HRP, which showed an average rotation correlation time of 3.2 ns after 12 days, with 

only a minor degree of hindering over a period of over five weeks in the same type of 

matrix. Thus, we reinforce the idea that, although the connections between the pores 

may somewhat hinder lateral diffusion, the matrix does appear to template about the 

enzyme and the pore size must be greater than that of the HRP molecule, although 

smaller than that of BSA.  

Finally, the diffusion of FITC between the pores is relatively free, as can be seen 

in figure 5.8. The full recovery back to 1 indicates that initially there is no significant 

immobile fraction, i.e. it appears to be no adhesion of FITC to the pore walls (the results 

using fluorescein show a similar behaviour). However, an immobile FITC fraction 

appears with time, as indicated by the lack of a full recovery from around day 15. The 

 88



corresponding time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, which initially show a free 

rotation, begin to exhibit r? &gt; 0, indicative of a hindered rotation (figure 5.9). It is worth 

to mention here, that time-resolved anisotropy data of unbound AF (figure 5.6) are 

consistent with this observation which hints to an increase of the pore viscosity with 

time. 

 

In summary, the adopted methodology of combining FRAP and time-resolved 

fluorescence anisotropy measurements allowed the determination of diffusion properties 

of biomolecules entrapped within sol-gel derived hosts. Although the matrix can 

template around an incorporated biomolecule, there is a size limit to this. Only small 

molecules display high mobility and are relatively free to circulate within the matrix, 

while a molecule the size of HRP will be retained within the internal pore structure, as 

summarised in figure 5.10. These are important considerations regarding the use of 

these materials for biosensor applications.

The samples were manufactured as previously stated, using 10 mm polystyrene cuvettes 

(ca. 4.5 ml) by taking 2 ml of sol and adding the modifier, DASPMI (in water) or Nile 

red (in DMSO), and phosphate buffer (pH7, 2 ml). The quantity of each additive was 

the highest possible to preserve good optical quality, that is, 3.75% (v/v) TMPS or 

GTPES, 0.5% (v/v) APTES, 2.5% (v/v) PEG300, 0.04 wt % PEG20k, and 0.02 wt % 

GR. 

 

Fluorescence measurements (steady-state and time-resolved) and data analysis 

were described in chapter 3. 

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 

Discover diffractometer working with CuK?1,2 radiation and equipped with a Goebel 

mirror. The diffraction patterns were collected by detector scan in the range 1-40º 2? at 

angle of incidence 0.5º, using step size of 0.04º and time per step of 1s. The 

measurements were performed on one surface of each of the monoliths prepared as 

described above. 

The textural characterisation of the matrices was done in an analyser from 

Quantachrome Instruments, Nova 4200, on the base of nitrogen adsorption-desorption 

isotherms, at -196 ºC, following the well known BET technique. The samples were 

previously degassed at 160 ºC. These measurements were performed at the Laboratory 

of Catalysis and Materials at Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, under 

the supervision of Professor José Luís Figueiredo.

The study on the gelation and initial aging phases was completed by examining 

the emission of the dye DASPMI in the modified matrices during these processes 

(figure 5.12).

Figure 5.12. Intensity of DASPMI steady state emission during the gelation and initial aging of modified 

samples. Excitation was at 490 nm with emission maxima at 600 nm.  

 

This figure shows that the reaction is more extensive when GR or PEG20k is present. 

GR is a polysaccharide with self-gelling properties composed of glucose, glucoronic 

acid, and rhamnose moieties [30]. It is probable that, when mixed with the sol it favours 

the silica polymerization along its branches, thus explaining the highest intensity of 

DASPMI emission in its presence. The length of the polymer chain is apparently 

important, since figure 5.12 shows that PEG300 has considerably less effect than 

PEG20k in the building of the matrix network. The results are in agreement with the 

work of Shchipunov et al. confirming that polysaccharides and polymers enhance the 

polymerization of the SiO2 network by creation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl 

groups of the macromolecules and the silanol products of TEOS hydrolysis [13,31]. The 

remaining modifiers (APTES, TMPS, and GPTES) do not significantly alter the 

gelation and initial aging rates, as can be seen by comparison between the curves in 

figure 5.12 and the gelation curve at pH 7 in figure 5.1.

5.4.2.2. Long-term monitoring of the aging process 

In order to characterise the sol-gel derived media both DASPMI and Nile red 

were employed. DASPMI was used to elucidate changes in viscosity by monitoring 

changes in its fluorescence emission and lifetime. Nile red should, because of its 

hydrophobic nature, locate at the interface between the bulk oxide material and the 

internal pore structure. Therefore it can report on changes in polarity in this region. 

 

a) Steady state monitoring: DASPMI emission 

The aging process was monitored during a period of over 40 days, in which the 

steady-state emission of DASPMI was measured periodically. Figure 5.13 shows the 

changes observed in the fluorescence intensity of the dye with aging time. Difference 

spectra were calculated using Microcal Origin 7 software by normalising the emission 

spectra at the maximum and subtracting from a reference spectrum taken just after 

gelation (day 0). As the aging progresses, a solvatochromic shift is reported by about 

5% of the excited dye molecules in the TEOS-TMPS and TEOS-APTES samples, 10% 

in TEOS-GPTES, TEOS-PEG20k, and TEOS-GR samples, and 20% in TEOS-PEG300 

samples. This blue shift indicates that a significant fraction (5-20%) of the dye 

molecules probes a slight decrease in the polarity of the host medium, favoured by 

aging. This behaviour is not surprising since the chemical composition of the liquid 

phase changes throughout the aging process. It is expected that not only water (the main 

component), but also some vestigial ethanol may remain in the liquid phase retained in 

the pores, formed as a by-product of the polymerization of the silica network. Moreover, 

the modifiers, a few remaining TEOS monomers, and other possible oligomers add to 

the complexity of the liquid-phase chemical composition.

 94



b) Steady state monitoring: Nile red SFS 

The changes in local polarity were monitored over the same time period by 

making use of Nile red combined with synchronous scan fluorescence spectroscopy 

(SFS). Figure 5.14 shows the Nile red SFS spectra just after gelation of the host media. 

The spectra are shown normalised at each maximum, to emphasise environmental 

changes, expressed by band position. Such methodology was adopted to overcome 

slight increases in the concentration of the entrapped species caused by matrix shrinkage 

over time. It is clear that Nile red is probing a very polar medium (with an “equivalent” 

dielectric constant in the order of 60, according to figure 4.7), most probably influenced 

by the high dielectric constant of the aqueous buffer solution, as expected at this early 

stage of the aging process, when the matrix network is still embedded in the initial 

solvent medium. 

 

 
Figure 5.14. Normalised Nile red SFS data obtained with an offset of 20 nm, in the different host media. 

 

Nile red SFS for each of the hosts was measured at regular intervals over an aging 

period of more than forty days. Figure 5.15 illustrates the shifts in the Nile red 

maximum wavelength for each matrix as the aging progresses. In all cases, with the 

exception of the TMPS containing host, a red shift in the Nile red SFS occurs. It is 

interesting to notice, that the change in the peak wavelength is consistent with matrix 

stabilisation occurring after twenty days. Using the Nile red SFS guide (figure 4.7) it is 

possible to make an estimate that Nile red is in a relatively polar hydrogen bond 

influenced environment (value 60-70), which is unsurprising if it is at the bulk oxide 

pore interface within the sol-gel derived media.

c) Time-resolved measurements: DASPMI lifetime 

The aging process was further examined through extensive fluorescence lifetime 

measurements, as shown in tables 5.3 – 5.9 The following general trends were found: 

(a) all decays can be adjusted to a three-component kinetics, (b) significant scatter in the 

values of the lifetimes can be found up to the 20th day, (c) the aging process appears to 

be more stable after the 20th day, (d) the longer lived component, a minor contribution 

in the early days, becomes more prominent as the aging process develops, and (e) all 

recovered lifetimes (?1, ?2, and ?3) increase with aging time. Moreover, it is generally 

observed that the relative contributions of ?2 and ?3 components become more important 

as the aging progresses.

For the effect of following the trend, the use of an average lifetime is sufficient. 

The outcome is given in figures 5.16 and 5.17. From twenty days onwards all the 

polymer modified hosts (figure 5.16) apparently have equivalent average lifetimes, 

which is indicative that the viscosity sensed by DASPMI is similar within these media. 

This is in contrast to the intensity data for the initial gelation step, thus indicating that 

the main influence of the polymers occurs during the matrix forming phase, after which 

they exhibit similar control. In the case of the silane modified systems there is more of a 

spread in the average lifetimes, showing that limited control can be exerted over the 

viscosity on longer timescales by selecting the appropriate silane. It is worth remember 

that the fluorescence lifetimes obtained are about two orders of magnitude longer than 

those obtained in non viscous solution [17].

5.4.2.3. Matrix characterization at the end of aging  

 

In this section the results obtained on the structural and morphological 

characterization of the matrices are presented. Firstly, figure 5.18 shows the X-ray 

diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples. These data indicate that the silica matrix is 

formed as an amorphous silicate hydrate usually referred to as opal, in all samples 

except the GPTES sample. Most probably the short range disorder of the silica network 

is higher in presence of this modifier as compared to the others thus precluding the 

detection of the opal characteristic peak. These results suggest that, although in presence 

 101



of a diversity of modifiers, the building of the network is mainly controlled by the sol-

gel synthesis of the silica matrix.

The textural characterization of the matrices was done by the application of the 

BET method, which gave isotherms classified as type IV (typical from mesoporous 

materials) with type H2 hysteresis which associated to porous of irregular shape (ink-

bottle-like). Figure 5.19 shows the nitrogen adsorption isotherms (at 77 K) of the porous 

silica matrices.

Table 5.10 lists the following parameters: the specific surface area, SBET, the total 

volume of pores, Vp (calculated at relative pressure P/P0_0.98), and average pore 

diameter, mouth diameter (rm) and pore body diameter (rb) respectively, estimated by the 

Kelvin equation [32]. The BET technique was also applied, for comparison purposes, to 

two additional samples of the matrix without any modifier, e.g., SiO2 samples — one as 

aged as the modified samples and the other a fresher sample (wet gel).

In order to interpret these results it is important to keep in mind that the preparation of 

the matrices involves two major steps, gelation and aging [33]. The first step is 

characterized by extensive and profound chemical and physical changes, namely the 

hydrolysis and the condensation of the silica network. During the aging process, 

polycondensation progresses with concomitant local solubilisation and re-precipitation 

events, thereby causing a significant decrease in porosity and increase in mechanical 

strength. The connectivity of the silica network increases substantially during this step. 

As the syneresis (shrinkage) occurs, an important fraction of liquid is expelled from the 

pores. Comparison between the two SiO2 samples confirms that aging induces a 

decrease in the specific surface area (SBET), in the total volume of the pores (Vp) and 

also in pore size (rm, and rb). Moreover the values found for rm and rb suggest these 

 103



matrices possess tubular/cylindrical pores that tend to shrink with aging as expected. It 

is important to note that the results on the modified matrices, shown in table 5.10, were 

obtained after the aging step, therefore on samples considered to be dry gels. 

Comparison between the values of rm, and rb for SiO2 (aged) and the ensemble of the 

modified samples show the general effect of the modifiers: not only the pores’ size 

increase but the shape of the pores becomes “ink-bottle-like”. Moreover, the specific 

surface area (SBET), and the total volume of the pores (Vp ) tend to increase upon 

addition of the modifier, except for PEG 300 where the opposite effect was 

unexpectedly observed. It is interesting to note that PEG 20k behaves in a similar way 

to the other modifiers. This specific effect observed with PEG 300 is ascribed to a more 

effective interaction of the hydroxyl groups of this polymer with the silica network, as 

compared with the longer chained PEG 20k. 

 

 

5.5. Conclusion 
 

Two fluorescent probes, Nile red and DASPMI were used in monitoring the 

profound changes that occur in sol-gel matrices during the gelation and aging stages. 

The combination of such fluorescent dyes, made it possible to gain an insight into these 

dynamic systems. 

During the gelation process DASPMI exhibited a drastic enhancement in quantum 

yield related to the increasing viscosity through the sol to gel transition, caused by a 

reduction in the non-radiative pathways. During the aging time a high degree of scatter 

was seen, in both the steady-state and time-resolved data, as DASPMI molecules 

encounter a range of different environments before the structure of the media becomes 

more stable. The systems stability is observed from day 20 onward. Changes in the peak 

steady-state emission most probably relate to alterations in the local polarity of the pore 

liquid, while the marked increase in intensity and lifetime values relate to decreased 

nonradiative de-excitation caused by increasing local viscosity. Nile red, in turn, reports 

on the interface between the bulk oxide material and the internal pore structure. The 

SFS data showed an enhancement in the polarity through aging, strongly influenced by 

 104



hydrogen bonding. In both cases the data revealed that, overall, the aging process 

stabilises from day 20 onward. 

Time-resolved measurements of DASPMI, made clear that the viscosity 

enhancement of the pore solvent, does not prevent the formation of the TICT state, 

which is favoured by the aging process. The complementary study on the photophysics 

of DASPMI in glycerol-water mixtures had provided evidence for the coexistence of 

hydrodynamic factors, where hydrogen bonding within the solvent cage inhibited the 

formation of the TICT state in this system. But in sol-gel systems studied, that was not 

the case. 

Complementary FRAP and anisotropy measurements are in agreement and 

furthermore suggest that the “viscosity” increase is primarily related to pore 

interconnections. Making use of these techniques also shows the ability of the hosts to 

retain relatively large biomolecules (while allowing them restricted mobility) and 

allows the free diffusion of smaller molecules.  

Finally, the results obtained from the BET measurements, although not directly 

related to the FRAP and time resolved measurements, nevertheless, corroborate the 

hypothesis present in this section.  

These important considerations are fundamental in the usage of sol-gel hybrid 

media for biosensor applications.

PROTEIN ENCAPSULATION AND CATALYTIC 

ACTIVITY 

 
6.1. Introduction 

 
The previous chapter presented the methods and techniques utilised to monitor 

silica matrices through the sol to gel transition and the aging process. The present 

chapter will focus on assessing the conformational stability and activity of two different 

catalytically active proteins encapsulated within these hosts. Hybrid sol-gel media, with 

either polymers or silanes to moderate the internal pore environment, were produced 

containing subtilisin Carlsberg or cytochrome c. Subtilisin Carlsberg is a member of 

the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases (subtilases) occurring in Archaea, 

Bacteria, Fungi and higher eukariotes [1]. It has been systematically characterised and 

the complete aminoacid sequence of the mature protein is known since 1968 [2]. 

Applications of proteolitic enzymes include drug delivery [3,4], food industry, laundry 

detergents [5] and organic synthesis [6]. C-type cytochromes are found in almost all 

organisms, and are involved in electron transport [7]. In eukariotes, it is synthesised in 

the cytoplasm, but is in the inner-membrane space of the mitochondria organelle that it 

gains its haem moiety.  Its most carefully studied function is as an electron carrier of the 

eukaryotic respiratory chain, but it is also important in both apoptosis and oxidative 

stress. The peroxidase activity of this electron carrier is associated with the iron of the 

haem group  [8]. 

 109



The encapsulated proteins exhibited activity over a forty day period, during which 

host aging occurred. The modifiers were characterised in chapter 5 and their structure is 

presented in figure 5.11.  

The highly solvatochromic dye Nile red was used in conjunction with 

synchronous scan fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) to elucidate changes in the tertiary 

structure of the proteins, upon incorporation into sol–gel derived media. By examining 

this and the catalytic reaction (initial velocity and amount of substrate transformed into 

product) it was possible to ascertain the influence of the different hosts on the catalytic 

rate. It is clear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurred, the major effect 

on the catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host. 

 

 

 

6.2. Encapsulation and activity of subtilisin Carlsberg 

 
6.2.1. Materials and methods 
 

All spectra (absorption and synchronous scan fluorescence) were measured with 

the instruments mentioned in chapter 3. Difference spectra were calculated by 

normalising the spectra and subtracting from the reference spectrum. 

Sols were manufactured as reported in section 5.2.1. Subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 

3.4.21.62) from Sigma, was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pH7 to a 

concentration of 1.5x10-5 M and was labelled with Nile red by continuous stirring at 

room temperature for 2 hours. This gave a molar ratio of 1 dye molecule to 15 

molecules of enzyme. The hybrid hosts were then manufactured using 10 mm 

pathlength polystyrene cuvettes (ca. 4.5 ml volume) by taking 2 ml of sol and adding 

silane or polymer, and 2 ml of the enzyme solution. The modifiers were presented in the 

previous chapter. After combining the selected sol and enzyme solution, the resultant 

gel was stored at 4 ºC between measurements with the top of the cuvette covered. Under 

these conditions an average shrinkage of ca. 40% occurred over the period of the 

experiment.  

 110



Catalytic experiments used the enzyme substrate Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methyl 

coumarin  (AAF-AMC) (Aldrich) and the product formation, amido-4-methyl coumarin 

(AMC) was followed spectrophotometrically [9].  

 

 

6.2.2. Results and discussion 

 
An important aim of the entrapment of biologically active molecules is that the 

host can provide a protective environment for the biomolecules under conditions such 

that their activity is preserved. In the present section the studies on the enzyme 

conformation are reported, through the analysis of the fluorescence spectroscopy of Nile 

Red as the aging of the matrices proceeds.  The enzymatic activity of subtilisin 

Carlsberg incorporated into different sol-gel derived media is also reported. In order to 

provide a reference, the catalytic reaction was also studied in aqueous solution (pH7). 

This reference study was carried out under conditions (i.e. concentration of substrate) 

similar to the study of subtilisin Carlsberg activity when incorporated into the chosen 

matrices. It should be stressed that all the catalytic and spectroscopic measurements 

were done during the period of wet aging. In fact, in chapter 4 it was shown that the 

actual pore size of the wet-gels is such that the enzyme has ample space to rotate, thus 

providing adequate conditions to probe the enzyme’s activity, a major purpose of the 

present work. 

 

6.2.2.1. Catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg in homogeneous solution 

(reference system) 

The reaction mechanism of subtilisin Carlsberg is well established, as serine 

proteases belong to the most comprehensively studied class of proteolytic enzymes [10]. 

The catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg was examined using the substrate Ala-Ala-

Phe-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AAF-AMC) and monitoring the formation of the 

product 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (AMC).  

According to Kamal et al. [9] the enzymatic reaction is described by the following 

mechanism:

In the present work, the activity of subtilisin Carlsberg at various concentrations was 

examined by monitoring the formation of the reaction product, 7-amido-4-methyl 

coumarin (AMC), with a fixed substrate concentration of 1.3x10-4 M, in aqueous 

solution (pH7), as shown in figure 6.2.

6.2.2.2. Catalytic activity of entrapped subtilisin Carlsberg 

The catalytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg in sol-gel derived matrices was 

monitored under experimental conditions equivalent to the ones used in the solution 

study, by cutting a slice of ca. 200 mg of matrix and putting it into a cuvette with 

substrate solution. This means that, in each reaction vessel, a total amount of ca. 0.1 mg 

of enzyme was present.  The low enzyme loading, ca. 0.05 wt%, was deliberate so that 

was always in excess relative to[ AMCAAF ? [ ]SC . From figure 6.3 it is possible to 

 114



estimate the reaction rate, in homogeneous medium, that corresponds to the enzyme 

load used in the matrices in the present case is 5.24x10-5 s-1. 

As previously pointed out, all the catalytic measurements were done during the 

period of wet aging, so that the actual pore size of the wet-gels is such that the enzyme 

has ample space to rotate, thus providing adequate conditions to probe the enzyme’s 

activity. Moreover, it has been shown in the previous chapter that the stabilization of 

these sol-gel matrices occurs only after 20 days. As a result, the activity of subtilisin 

Carlsberg was monitored in wet gels after an aging period of two months. The [ ] 
versus time curves shown in figure 6.4, when compared to the corresponding curves 

measured for the reference system (figure 6.2), indicate that the enzymatic process, 

although occurring, is much slower when subtilisin Carlsberg is entrapped. Moreover 

significant activity occurs only after an “induction period”, of duration quite dependent 

upon the modifier. It is shorter for Gelrite and PEG 20 K and longer for TMPS and 

APTES matrices.

Several approaches have been developed to the study of the kinetics of enzymatic 

reactions when incorporated into complex systems such as living cells or heterogeneous 

media such as nanostructures [12-15]. Considerable attention was paid to enzymatic 

processes that follow the Michaelis – Menten mechanism [14,15] 

 

PSEES k

According to these authors [14] their simulation studies indicate that, under these 

circumstances, k1 shows a time dependence whereas k-1 and k2 are time independent. 

These results confirm that in spatially constrained media k1 is unequivocally affected, 

e.g., k1 becomes time dependent. 

According to Kopelman [16,17] the time dependence of the rate constant can be 

adequately described by the fractal like kinetics: 

 
htktk ?= 0)(   for t??     (6.6) 

 

where k0 is the rate constant in absence of constraints, and h is the fractal dimension. 

 

In the present study, since the enzyme is trapped into the matrix, the accessibility 

of the substrate to the pores that retain the enzyme is somewhat inhibited. Therefore it is 

expected that the access to the enzyme will control the kinetics with obvious time 

dependent effects on k1. Under these circumstances it was assumed that the enzymatic 

process becomes a pseudo–first order process

The table confirms that all values of the rate constant, k0, are significantly lower than 

the corresponding homogeneous value of 5.24x10-5 s-1, as expected. This value was 

obtained from the kinetic data in homogeneous solution, when the enzyme load is 

identical to the load in the matrices. It is also important to notice that negative values of 

the fractal dimension were obtained. This means that the true morphology of the matrix 

is complex, with a variability of patterns at different scales. These results suggest the 

need to develop in future new models and simulations that approach these materials in a 

more realist way, albeit at the expenses of added complexity [18].

6.2.2.3. Enzyme conformation during aging 

The enzyme’s conformation was monitored by analysing the synchronous 

fluorescence scan spectra (SFS) of the extrinsic fluorescent probe Nile red, as explained 

previously. As a preliminary study, subtilisin Carlsberg (SC) was deliberately 

denatured with urea to elucidate the SFS spectrum of Nile red in presence of the 

unfolded species. The enzyme and Nile red were mixed in buffer solution (pH 7) and 

the incubation proceeded for 2 hours with continuous gentle stirring prior to 

measurement (figure 6.6, solid line). Urea was then added to the enzyme solution and, 

after dissolving, the spectrum was re-measured (figure 6.6, dotted line). It is evident 

from figure 6.6, that treatment with urea causes an enhancement of the fluorescence 

intensity at 625 nm. Emission at this wavelength corresponds to Nile red sensing a more 

aqueous (polar) environment, which is attributed to unfolding of the protein. The 

concentration of urea used, 4 M, is not enough to completely denature SC (it retains ca. 

35% relative hydrolysis activity)[19], although a certain degree of unfolding is expected 

due to solvation of the hydrophobic core [20].The synchronous scan fluorescence 

spectra clearly reveal that, after urea treatment, the probe senses a more polar 

environment, with the Nile red band intensity at 625 nm increasing dramatically, 

accompanied by a red shift of 4 nm. The same technique was utilised to monitor the 

conformation of SC encapsulated in the sol-gel modified monoliths.

SC (solid line) and after treatment with urea (dotted line). A massive increase in the intensity along with a 

4 nm red shift of the spectrum after urea treatment should be noted.

After the encapsulation in sol-gel derived media, the SFS technique was used to 

follow changes in the enzyme’s conformation during the aging period. The difference 

spectra were generated by normalising the spectra and subtracting the reference (day 0) 

spectrum using Microcal Origin 7 software (figure 6.8). 

It is assumed throughout that, after encapsulation, Nile red does not leach to any 

appreciable extent from the enzyme and that the enhancement of the band at 630nm is 

attributed to protein unfolding, exposing the probe to a more aqueous environment. This 

happens at the expenses of the band at 600nm. The enhancement in each sample varies 

between 35% and 40%, except for TMPS sample where it reaches 10%, indicating that 

this host is the one that better preserves the enzyme integrity. This then leads to the 

question of what is the meaning of the band at 550nm or lower wavelengths that appears 

in both the APTES and TMPS samples. As Nile red is a very hydrophobic probe, 

changes in its surroundings could force some molecules to relocate to less polar 

positions. Also, the quantum yield of Nile red in non polar environments is higher than 

in polar ones, so the fluorescence intensity of the relocated molecules is relatively 

enhanced. Favourable effect of TMPS addition to silica matrices has previously been 

reported on myoglobin conformation [21]. 

Overall, these results show that the confinement in sol-gel derived media does not 

lead to any significant denaturing of SC; moreover the results suggest a favourable 

effect of TMPS addition on SC conformation.

6.3. Encapsulation and activity of cytochrome c 

 
6.3.1. Materials and methods 

 
Cytochrome c (horse heart, Aldrich) was either used as received or labelled with 

Nile red by taking 0.3 mg of protein in 2 ml of phosphate buffer solution (pH7) and 

incubating with 2 µl of 10-3 M  Nile red solution in dimethylsulfoxide for one hour. The 

cytochrome c activity was obtained from the oxidation of ABTS (2,2-Azino-bis(3-

ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, (from Sigma) by hydrogen 

peroxide (H2O2, 37% Aldrich) [8]. The sol-gel derived media manufacturing process 

was described previously (section 6.2.1). All measurements (described in chapter 3) 

were performed at ambient temperature and taken over a 40 day period to check for 

longer term changes during sol–gel aging.  

 

 

6.3.2. Results and discussion 

 
Activity measurements in aqueous solution served as reference to the 

measurements involving the sol–gel matrices and were performed using differing 

quantities of cytochrome with a fixed substrate concentration. For the studies on the 

sol–gel derived systems, 100 mg of matrix (a slice cut from the monolith) was taken and 

added to a cuvette containing 2 ml of 2.5×10?5 M ABTS and 8 µl H2O2 in buffer 

solution. The absorption spectrum was recorded in the range 250–500 nm, both before 

the addition of the matrix and after the kinetic study was complete. The progress curves 

were built either on the addition of the cytochrome c or protein containing matrix and 

followed the formation of the ABTS?+ radical by monitoring absorption changes at 414 

nm [22]. The peroxidase activity of cytochrome c shows a typical Michaelis–Menten 

kinetics for H2O2 [8].   

 

 

 

 122



6.3.2.1. Catalytic activity of cytochrome c in homogeneous solution (reference 

system) 

The reaction of H2O2 with cytochrome c, produces a highly reactive ferryl-haem 

species, the intermediate compound I which, by reduction with ABTS, regenerates the 

original cytochrome c molecule [8]. In agreement to Deere et al. [23] cytochrome c 

mediates the oxidation of ABTS, with one mole of H2O2 reacting with two moles of 

ABTS, according to equations 6.10 and 6.11. 

 

( ) OHIcompoundOHIIIFeccytochrome 222 +?+   (6.10) 

 

( ) +•+?+ ABTSIIIFeccytochromeABTSIcompound 22   (6.11) 

 

For the catalytic reaction a fixed concentration of H2O2 and ABTS were used, at 

various protein concentrations, in a range similar to that expected in the hosts. The 

formation of the ABTS?+ radical was monitored at 414 nm with time, using absorption 

spectroscopy (figure 6.9). 

 

 

 
Figure 6.9. Catalytic activity in solution, with fixed substrate and H2O2 concentrations and varying 

amounts of cytochrome c. The product formation was monitored at 415 nm. 

 

From these progress curves, the initial rate (v0) of the catalytic reaction was calculated 

by taking the derivative [24]. The values obtained are given in table 6.2 and show that 

the initial rate of the reaction is proportional to the protein concentration. The initial 

 123



reaction rate (v0) was chosen, as determination of other kinetic parameters can be 

problematic in sol-gel derived media [24,25]. The reaction forming the ABTS?+ radical 

is reversible, through a complex mechanism [25], so longer time course measurements 

were precluded. Curve A in figure 6.9, shows an initial rapid increase, followed by a 

decrease (also observed in some of the other kinetic curves) which relates to the 

reversibility of this reaction. It was expected that the results would be obtained in a 

regime where the substrate would be in excess in relation to cytochrome c.

6.3.2.2. Catalytic activity of entrapped cytochrome c 

Comparing the values for the initial velocity from the sol-gel hosts over a period 

of approximately 40 days (figure 6.10), these media exhibit v0 values one to two orders 

of magnitude lower than that seen in the solution data (table 6.2). An example of the 

kinetic curves for the formation of the ABTS?+ radical at various points during the 

aging process, in this case APTES, is given in figure 6.11. This shows that the amount 

of radical formed over the period of the experiment is similar in magnitude to the lower 

concentrations of cytochrome c employed in the solution study. 

There is a general trend for the amount of radical formed during the time of the 

experiment to reduce with aging time. To perform these measurements slices taken from 

a monolith were used rather than powders, and this could partially explain the low v0’s 

obtained. Other explanations that need exploring are unfolding of the protein and its 

accessibility within the host to the substrate. The fact that a charged radical is formed in 

 124



the reaction and that it has to exit the matrix before it is detected spectroscopically is 

also an issue. Considering the whole of the dataset shown in figure 6.10, it is evident 

that there is a trend for the initial velocity to decrease with aging time.

Figure 6.11. Comparison of Nile red difference SFS in cytochrome c with sol-gel aging time when

 126



This was assessed using synchronous scan difference spectra, which were 

generated by normalising the synchronous scan spectra for the different matrices and 

subtracting from the initial spectrum taken after gelation.  

Generally the data in figure 6.11 show that there is a decrease in the main band (in 

the region 600 nm to 620 nm) and relative increases at both shorter (ca. 560 nm and 

below) and longer (ca. 635 nm) wavelengths. The fact that in the region of the dominant 

band the difference spectra exhibit both an increase and decrease along with a cross 

over point is indicative that this band is probably the sum of two or more component 

spectra, with Nile red located in distinct, reasonably polar microenvironments. The 

degree of spectral change appears dependent on the modifying agent. Tentatively the 

longer wavelength increase can indicate an opening of the protein structure exposing the 

probe to an increased polarity. This may relate to some denaturing of the protein (or 

even a small degree of probe leaching), however in comparison to the effect of adding 

urea to cytochrome c in solution (data not shown), the degree of denaturing appears low. 

 It should also be noted that absorption spectra taken at the end of the study period 

showed the presence of the haem Soret band in all of the samples at 407 nm indicating 

the retention of protein within the hosts. This wavelength is close to that we observe in 

solution (408 nm) and indicates that the protein is hydrated [26] and should be 

functional within the hosts. Also the loading used (0.01 wt %) should be low enough to 

avoid protein aggregation, although higher loading on silicate materials can be obtained 

[23]. 

 

 

6.3.2.4. Correlation between spectral and catalytic data 

In order to help explain the results in the previous sections we have explored the 

possibility that there exists a connection between the SFS and initial velocity data. The 

possible factors that we can envisage to explain the catalytic activity data are changes in 

the protein structure and access of the substrate to the protein. The former relates to the 

cytochrome itself, while the latter is more influenced by the host. If it is assumed that 

increases in the SFS 635 nm band and decreases in the 600–615 nm band are assigned 

to unfolding of the protein, it should be possible to use the relative importance of the 

600–615 nm band as a measure of protein conformation changes. We advance this 

hypothesis, as previous studies of cytochrome c in sol-gel derived media, making use of 

 127



circular dichroism, have shown the ability of this protein to unfold and refold within the 

matrix structure [27]. 

Considering the first (just after gelation) and final measurements, then any 

difference between these values should reflect the influence of the host. Table 6.3 shows 

that, overall, the reduction in v0 is significantly higher than the reduction exhibited by 

the 600–615 nm band. This difference is most dramatic for the TMPS modified host, 

which, according to the present hypothesis, means that although this matrix appears 

suitable for retaining the cytochrome c conformation (relatively small changes in SFS – 

figure 6.11), it provides poor accessibility for the cytochrome to react with the ABTS 

and hydrogen peroxide. Both the GTPES and PEG 300 modified hosts show the next 

biggest difference between our two chosen parameters, with the other modified media 

exhibiting similar differences.

is also given to provide an indication of the average decrease per day over the study period. (*)The 

bracketed number was obtained omitting day 1 data points. 

 

When combining all the data, these observations allow us to suggest that the 

Gelrite modified host appears to exhibit the most promising properties probably related 

to the templating properties of this polysaccharide [28]. This approach shows that it is 

possible to make a good comparison, making use of Nile SFS and activity 

measurements, between the modified sol–gel derived media.

6.4. Conclusion 

 
Sol-gel derived hosts, containing either polymers or silanes to moderate the 

internal structure and pore environment, were produced containing subtilisin Carlsberg 

and cytochrome c. 

By examining protein change conformation via Nile red synchronous fluorescence 

spectroscopy (SFS), it appears that no major unfolding of the proteins happens upon 

incorporation. However, during the aging time considered, the protein structure alters 

and this effect is seemingly influenced by the host. For cytochrome c, the sample with 

TMPS gave the most promising results(see table 6.3 that reports the highest decrease in 

the reaction rate!), with Nile red SFS difference spectra showing as much as 8% 

alteration. The opposite effect was obtained with PEG samples with significant changes 

of about 67%. Nile red SFS difference spectra of the samples with subtilisin Carlsberg 

gave very similar results. Apparently TMPS has beneficial influence on the protein 

structure as difference spectra show an alteration of only 10%. All other samples 

showed a difference of about 40%. This could be related to the hydrophobic character of 

the modifier (through the propyl group) and also to a more stable environment through 

aging, as probed by Nile red SFS in TMPS sample without protein. It was shown (figure 

5.15) that the probe reports on a relatively constant polarity, during aging time. 

The incorporated proteins exhibited catalytic activity in all the media over a forty 

day period, in which host aging occurred. The catalytic activity was inferior to that 

exhibited in solution one to two orders of magnitude and diminished with time. Polymer 

doped hosts fare better in terms of catalytic activity, with the best results obtained with 

Gelrite®. This was confirmed with an activity study over a prolonged timescale using 

subtilisin Carlsberg, which also suggest that the substrate may be in default inside the 

matrices pores, thus affecting the reaction kinetics. It is possible that although the bulk 

substrate concentration is in excess relatively to the encapsulated enzyme, the 

concentration inside the pores may not observe this premise, resulting in atypical 

progress curves. Complementary theoretical studies applied to enzymatic Michaelis–

Menten mechanisms confirm that the true morphology of the sol-gel matrix is complex, 

with a variability of patterns at different scales. 

It is clear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurs, the major effect on 

the catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
 

This work supports the use of fluorescence in following the whole of the sol-gel 

manufacturing process for protein encapsulation; the gelation and aging steps, the 

biomolecule incorporation, and protein conformation during aging. It also demonstrates 

that it is possible to retain an enzyme’s catalytic activity for several weeks which is an 

important achievement for use in biosensor applications. 

Even though sol-gel derived media based on producing a pure SiO2 bulk oxide 

matrix have been employed for protein encapsulation, recent research has shown that it 

can be advantageous to modify the reaction procedure to make the resulting host more 

amenable. With this in mind, we focused on manufacturing organically modified silanes 

and polymer doped matrices to host different proteins with catalytic activity. The 

chosen additives not only contribute to template the pores, but also provide 

biocompatibility, by controlling the internal pore environment and/or by modifying the 

waterpool-bulk oxide interface of the host. Cytochrome c and subtilisin Carlsberg were 

successfully incorporated into modified sol–gel derived hosts in absence of major 

structural changes. The protein conformation was indirectly monitored via the use of 

Nile red synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS) a technique that allowed changes in 

micropolarity to be sensed, and thus to follow changes in the integrity of the 

biomolecule structure. This hydrophobic dye probes different environments within the 

protein and does not leach to any appreciable extent into the matrix pores. Combining 

the two sets of data (Nile red SFS and catalytic rates), made it possible to discriminate 

 133



between changes attributed to alterations in the protein conformation and effects from 

the mass transport restrictions ascribed to the aging of the host. The matrices exhibited 

good optical quality thus allowing for the spectroscopic monitoring. 

In general the initial reaction rate becomes about one to two orders of magnitude 

lower upon encapsulation as compared with solution measurements. The access to the 

enzyme appears to become more restricted with aging time, possibly related to closure 

of the pores and decreased interconnectivity. 

The modifiers used in the present work enabled the adjustment of the sol-gel 

reaction to host the enzyme from different standpoints. The polysaccharide Gelrite® 

widens the three-dimensional network at early stages of the sol-gel process and PEG 

allows better diffusion of reactants. The silanes APTES, GPTES and TMPS modulate 

chemically the interior of the pore and do not substantially alter its diameter. Our data 

point to the following: 

• The silane additive TMPS has a more favourable effect on the conformation of 

subtilisin Carlsberg, and GPTES is more beneficial to cytochrome c integrity. 

This can be related with the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the pore 

induced by the modifier. The protein conformation was accessed by monitoring 

Nile red synchronous fluorescence spectra. Regarding the catalytic 

measurements, TMPS and GPTES matrices gave poor results for both proteins. 

It is apparent that, although the structure of the biomolecules is intact, the 

diffusion within TMPS and GPTES hosts is severely affected. 

• Detailed studies on the enzymatic process of subtilisin Carlsberg (Michaelis–

Menten mechanism) in aged matrices confirm that the true morphology of the 

sol-gel matrix is complex, with a variability of patterns at different scales. It is 

clear that, although some unfolding of the proteins occurs, the major effect on 

the catalytic reaction is that of mass transport within the host. 

• Measurements of the catalytic activity, as reflected by the initial velocity, 

showed a reduction during the aging process, in cytochrome c matrices. This 

effect was ascribed mainly to mass transport increased restrictions, as the 

building of the silica matrix progresses. In general, the polymers PEG and 

Gelrite permit better diffusion of reactants inside the sol-gel hosts. The charge of 

the reactants could also be influential; in the present case, the reaction product of 

cytochrome c catalysed reaction is a positively charged radical (ABTS?+) that 

could be delayed or trapped due to the negatively charged walls of the pores.

This is an area in which further effort may provide help in understanding the 

interaction between the different entities introduced in this study. The ideal host 

has to conciliate both the shrinkage resistance during aging and the pore 

hydrophobicity to preserve the protein folding, while permitting the free passage 

of reactants.  

 

The choice of fluorescent probes is of great importance if the system is to be 

monitored via fluorescence techniques. Here we made use of the viscosity and polarity 

sensitive fluorescence probes DASPMI and Nile red respectively, to monitor the host 

gelation and aging processes of the modified matrices. Time-correlated single-photon 

counting fluorescence spectroscopy of DASPMI was used to study the alterations in the 

pore viscosity with aging time. 

The gelation (as probed by DASPMI emission) was found to be a two step 

process, which, by silane or polymer addition slows down by an order of magnitude as 

compared to non-doped media. The main influence of the polymers occurs during the 

matrix forming phase, after which they exhibit similar control. The lifetimes obtained 

for silane-doped hosts showed that these additives exert limited control over the 

viscosity on longer timescales. During aging, the microviscosity increases, but the pore 

environment stabilises only after a period of 20 days. Nile red reported on the polarity 

within the pores via synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS). Overall, the polarity 

increases as aging progresses and the results suggest the occurrence of hydrogen bonds 

at the bulk oxide pore interface. 

The fact that Nile red is not covalently linked with the proteins means that the 

global movements of the biomolecule are difficult to assess. A fixed linkage between 

probe and protein is preferable in elucidating the motion of biomolecules within the 

host, with aging time. This was achieved with the covalent dyes Alexa Fluor 488 and 

fluorescein isothyocyanate (FITC), using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 

experiments (FRAP) and fluorescence lifetime anisotropy measurements. These 

techniques proved complementary in monitoring the dynamics of sol-gel hybrid 

systems, namely the proteins’ rotation and ability to diffuse within the matrix. 

Rotational diffusion is related to the environment inside the pore, while translational 

diffusion is related to the pore interconnections. In terms of the effective viscosity 

sensed by the probes Alexa Fluor and fluorescein, the values correlate with the 

formation and stabilisation of the pore’s structure. It appears from our data, using silica 

 135



monoliths, that the pores retain a liquid phase through aging. However, as the 

interconnections between the pores constrict with time, the effective viscosity increases.  

This methodology enabled us to understand that although the matrix can template 

around an incorporated biomolecule or modifier, there is a size limit to that, and only 

small molecules display high mobility and are relatively free to circulate within the 

host.  

 

This study concentrated on what could be described as the “active part” of the 

biosensor – the interaction of the enzyme and an immobilisation medium. An advance 

would be the fabrication of a flow based system. This could help in the study of the 

catalytic process under well controlled mass flows, to be used in future devices. 

 Also the use of thin films, rather than the use of monoliths, could be 

advantageous for sensing purposes as it reduces the distance that the reactants have to 

diffuse before encountering the entrapped enzyme. A stack of thin films containing 

different sensing moieties would even increase the area of the biosensor and the 

possibility of detecting multiple analytes. 

The ability to include sol-gel hybrids at the end of an optical fibre would be the 

ultimate step towards a functional optical biosensor. In this case, the light from a 

convenient source would travel through the fiber passing through the sol-gel biocatalyst 

sensor. The fluorescence response produced after the biochemical reaction would travel 

through the same fibre to a detector, giving the measure of the concentration of the 

analyte.  

One very challenging group of enzymes to investigate is the cytochrome P450 

superfamily (CYP). CYPs are involved in the synthesis of steroid and bile acids, 

hydroxylation of fatty acids, and elimination of xenobiotics and steroids from the body. 

The interest comes from their role in drug interactions, drug toxicity and creation of 

carcinogenic by-products; the isoform aromatase, for example, is a key enzyme of 

intratumoral production of estrogen in breast cancer. The immobilisation of this system 

is therefore very attractive to analyse drug metabolism. Arrays of multiple CYP 

isoforms could be designed to characterise the different metabolic pathways and predict 

drug-drug interactions. 

A new generation of biosensors can be expected within the next few decades!
