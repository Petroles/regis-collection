Abstract

CONSTITUTIVE MODELING OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS VIA THE MU?LLER-
LIU ENTROPY PRINCIPLE- This work concerns the thermodynamics of electrochemical
systems. Exploiting the principles of constitutive theory, few expedient assumptions, and,
in special, the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, a thermo-electrochemical continuum model
is proposed for electrolyte solutions as well as for the bulk and double layer regions of
an electrochemical system. The influence of ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions on the
mixture dynamics is taken into account through the thermodynamics of polar materials
and balance laws for an electrochemical system are accordingly stated. In addition, phe-
nomenological equations are schemed for a dilute and isotropic electrolyte solution, and
the conditions for local thermodynamic equilibrium of bulk and double layer regions are
investigated. Comparing the residual entropy inequalities obtained for each region of an
electrochemical system, it is shown that some mechanisms develop only in the double
layer, such as the thermal diffusion, thermoelectricity and electrophoresis phenomena. As
a consequence, the local thermodynamic equilibrium state in the double layer requires
stricter conditions than in the bulk. Although the constitutive equations are the simplest
possible, the constitutive models proposed for the double layer and bulk regions are physi-
cally consistent and more comprehensive than the usual models since the emerging equa-
tions do not constrain themselves to equilibrium neither limiting conditions. Therefore, the
thermodynamic description provided in this work may stimulate chemists and chemical
engineers to take advantage of it to study the flow of ions and other chemical species
across cell membranes, ionic mobility in bio and geological media, and processes whose
heat and mass transfers are enhanced by electromagnetic fields.
KEYWORDS: Thermodynamic modeling, Electrochemistry, Mu?ller-Liu entropy, diffusion-
mathematical models, mechanics of continuous media.

RESUMO

MODELAGEM CONSTITUTIVA DE SISTEMAS ELETROQUI?MICOS ATRAVE?S DO
PRINCI?PIO DE ENTROPIA MU?LLER-LIU- Este trabalho descreve a termodina?mica de
sistemas eletroqu??micos. Explorando os princ??pios da teoria constitutiva, algumas hipo?teses
ad hoc e, em especial, o princ??pio de entropia Mu?ller-Liu, modelos termo-eletroqu??micos
sa?o propostos para soluc?o?es eletrol??ticas e para as regio?es de bulk e dupla camada de
um sistema eletroqu??mico. A influe?ncia das interac?o?es ??on-??on e ??on-solvente sobre a

condic?o?es para o equil??brio termodina?mico local do bulk e da dupla camada sa?o investi-
gadas. Comparando-se as desigualdades residuais de entropia obtidas para cada regia?o,
foi demonstrado que alguns processos, tais como os feno?menos de difusa?o te?rmica, ter-
moeletricidade e eletroforese, desenvolvem-se somente na dupla camada. Consequen-
temente, o estado de equil??brio termodina?mico local na dupla camada requer condic?o?es
termodina?micas mais severas do que no bulk. Apesar das equac?o?es constitutivas serem
as mais simples poss??veis, os modelos constitutivos propostos para as regio?es de du-

1 Introduction

Since the mid-19th century, when the first electrochemical experiments were done, the
study of the dynamic behavior of ions in electric-conducting solutions has been one of
the major fields of study in Physical Chemistry. In 1887, van’t Hoff [69] published a work,
reporting deviations in the values of freezing points, boiling points, osmotic pressure, and
vapor pressures for electrolyte solutions. Few months later, Arrhenius [1] suggested that
charged chemical species should be present in electric-conducting solutions, even in the
absence of external electric fields.

From van’t Hoff and Arrhenius’ works, several studies [76] showed that the interi-
onic forces should play an important role in the physico-chemical properties of electrolyte
solutions. This became more evident when the results obtained from conductometric and
amperometric experiments indicated that the nature and concentration of ions change the
conductivity, viscosity, and mass transport of solutions. Since then, many attempts [3]
have been made to derive theories of interionic interaction, being most of them based
on statistical mechanics whose focus relies on the time-averaged spatial distribution of
ions. According to these models, a volume element of the solution is completely filled
with a dielectric continuum, where discrete point charges, regarded as hard spheres, are
immersed. Evidently, these approximations are shortcomings because real ions are not
hard spheres, and the solvent is not a dielectric continuum. However, in the limit of very
dilute solutions, these approximations are acceptable, as Debye and Hu?ckel demonstrated
in reference [18].

In the Debye-Hu?ckel model, thermodynamic properties of the solution are calcu-
lated from the electrostatic interaction energy between an ion, chosen as a reference one,
and all other ions in solution. In order to determine this interaction energy, one consid-
ers that the averaged distribution of ions around the reference ion follows the Boltzmann
distribution law, whereas the relation between the charge density of each ion and the
electrostatic potential is given by the Poisson’s equation. The combination of these two
equations leads to the so-called Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which, in general, is solved
by numerical or series methods. To make further progress, Debye and Hu?ckel focused on
systems where the average electrostatic potential energy is much smaller than the ther-

1



mal one, allowing the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to be linearized and solved analytically.
However, despite the great contribution of the Debye-Hu?ckel model to the development of
a coherent interionic theory, it provides theoretical results that are in good agreement with
experimental data for only very dilute solutions.

In view of the limitations of the Debye-Hu?ckel model, other theoretical models
based on more realistic assumptions have been developed. Some of these models, for
instance, are founded on the use of the unlinearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation [25, 27,
51], the virial expansion of the excess Gibbs energy (Pitzer equation) [52, 53], and the
intermolecular potential theory (McMillan-Mayer theory) [38]. Nevertheless, despite the
impressive success reached by these models, the lack of data about ionic and molecular
radii, dielectric saturation, and electrostriction effects has hindered their application in
more complex systems. Even with the advances in computational molecular dynamics, the
determination of thermodynamic properties of simple electrolyte solutions is frequently a
long and tedious process as it requires several computer cycles per chemical species. As
a result, continuum models for mixtures have become an alternative approach, especially
with the progresses obtained in electrorheological fluids and continuum mixtures models
during the last decades. For instance, Maugin and co-authors [42, 43] developed various
continuum models to study the behavior of polyelectrolytes in non-homogeneous velocity
gradient flows, either in the presence or absence of electric fields. Moreover, several
continuum models have been developed in order to associate the material properties of
electrorheological fluids to measurable macroscopic quantities.

The literature provides numerous works about constitutive modeling of polyelec-
trolytes, ionic polymer-metal composites, and electrorheological fluids with practical ap-
plications in automotive industries, polishing solutions, biomedical devices etc. In refer-
ences [55, 77], phenomenological models of ion transport were given with basis in linear
irreversible thermodynamics. In reference [50], Placidi and co-authors provided a con-
tinuum model for polymer-metal composites, where chemically induced deformations are
described through a distortion field induced by solvated ions. However, although several
continuum models are available for electrolyte mixtures, the most fundamental aspects of
electrolyte dynamics have not been sufficiently explored. Hence, the aim of this work is
to propose a general thermo-electrochemical theory to investigate the diffusive, reactive,
and advective structures of dilute electrolyte solutions. These solutions present close con-
nection with the fields of surface chemistry (the stability of many colloids depends on the
interionic interactions in solution), biochemistry (blood is an ion carrier and changes in the
ions concentrations affect the blood flow), metallurgy (successful electroplating processes
require the control of ions transport in solutions), and geology (soils with high concen-

2



tration of ions flow faster), and differ from the polyelectrolyte ones because they do not
contain ionic or polarizable macromolecules, but only monoatomic or molecular ions of
low molecular weight.

Chapter 2 is devoted to the presentation of the foundations of continuum ther-
modynamics. Particularly, attention is focused on the continuum concept, basic laws of
Physics, and principles of the constitutive theory. Here, the concept of continuum particle
is also differentiated from the classical concept of particles in Chemistry and Physics. In
Chapter 3, the dynamics of reacting ionic mixtures is outlined by emphasizing the rela-
tion between inner structure of the mixture and interionic interactions. In turn, the next
two chapters are dedicated to exploitation of the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle for electro-
chemical systems. In Chapter 4, thermodynamic restrictions on constitutive functions and
their consequences for dilute electrolyte solutions whose constituents present the same
temperature field are shown. In order to assess the implications of this constitutive theory
for electrolyte solutions, some results are compared with those of classical thermostatics.
Finally, in Chapter 5, some comments are addressed to the structure of electrochemi-
cal systems, and continuum models for the double layer and bulk regions are developed.
From these models, transport phenomena in the bulk and double layer are investigated
and compared, and the implications of material equations on the properties of each re-
gion are discussed.

Despite the continuum models proposed are limited to electrochemical systems,
the results presented can be extended to study the flow of ions and other chemical species
across cell membranes, ionic mobility in bio and geological media, and processes whose
heat and mass transfers are enhanced by electromagnetic fields.

2 Foundations of Continuum
Thermodynamics

Continuum thermodynamics is a branch of physical science concerned with deformations
and motions of continuous material media under the influence of mechanical, electro-
magnetic, thermal, and chemical sources. Since mid-1960, the continuum approach for
material bodies has been an important theoretical tool for engineers and applied mathe-
maticians because it provides a very useful and reliable representation for macroscopic
bodies whose characteristic dimensions are much bigger than the molecular ones. On
the other hand, most of the chemists are still not aware of the methods of continuum
thermodynamics as an alternative to traditional thermodynamic theories.

The subsequent sections are destined to present the basic concepts of continuum
thermodynamics whose phenomenology is restricted to the Newtonian space-time,

^ : W ?E ×R , (2.0.1)

where ^ is a frame of reference or observer, E is the three-dimensional Euclidean space ,
and R is the one-dimensional space of real numbers. For a complete overview of the foun-
dations of continuum thermodynamics, the readers are advised to consult the references
[29, 35, 47, 68].

2.1 The continuum concept

On a small scale, an aluminum sheet is a collection of discrete aluminum atoms stacked
on one another in a repetitive lattice. On an even smaller scale, the aluminum atoms
consist of a core of protons and neutrons around which electrons move. Thus, clearly,
matter is not continuous. However, if the continuum concept of matter is accepted, one
ignores the discrete composition of material bodies and assumes that the mass of such
bodies is distributed throughout, so filling the whole space that it occupies. In keeping with
this continuum model, matter may be divided indefinitely into smaller and smaller portions,

5



each of which retains all the physical properties of the original body. Accordingly, physical
quantities, such as energy and velocity, are ascribed to every single point of the region of
space that the body occupies as continuous functions or piecewise continuous functions
of space and time.

In continuum thermodynamics, the mass of a body is a fundamental physical prop-
erty, and it is a priori assigned as a part of the specification of a continuous body. Hence,
consider a finite part P of a body. For all points inside P, the mass density ? is defined by
the limit

? (·) = lim
V?0

m

V
&gt; 0 , (2.1.1)

where m is a non-negative scalar measure, named the mass distribution of P, V is the
volume of P, and ? is independent of the size of P, but depends on position and time.

Moreover, classical continuum thermodynamic theories, also known as local con-
tinuum theories, are based on the fundamental hypothesis that the state of a body at
any material point is influenced only by the infinitesimal neighborhood of that point. This
assumption eliminates the long-range effect of loads on the motion and on the evolution
of the state of the body, as well as ignores the effect of long-range interactions among
physical particles. In fact, this premise is valid for a class of materials where experimen-
tal probes measure the average outcome on some spatial and/or temporal domains over
which non-local variations of fields are small and external applied loads are often very
smooth. But, for another class of materials, such as blood, polymeric substances, solids
with micro-cracks, fluids in a state of turbulence, liquid crystals etc. classical continuum
theories do not give reliable predictions since the individual response of the constituents
of the body becomes important, so that the hypothesis of locality fails.

The departure from local theories begins with polar theories, initially proposed by
the Cosserat brothers in 1909 [15]. According to them, the material points are considered
geometrical points that possess properties similar to rigid particles (micropolar media) or
deformable particles (micromorphic media). These properties are then introduced through
independent degrees of freedom provided by a set of vectors or even by tensors of order
bigger than two, resulting in higher-order polar theories. Nevertheless, this process soon
ceases to be useful because the consequent field equations become increasingly compli-
cated. Conversely, polar theories of the first order (micropolar and micromorphic theories)
are simple enough and have found important applications in a variety of materials as previ-
ously mentioned, although they are not expected to bridge the gap between macroscopic
and atomic physics. For this purpose, it is necessary to construct non-local theories in
which a finite neighborhood of a material point influences the response at that point or

6



even mesoscopic theories, where macroscopic quantities are obtained from a statistical
distribution function.

2.2 Motion of a body

The starting point of continuum thermodynamics is a material body B, which consists of
infinite material points or particles X, considered primitive elements. In order to describe
the presence of a continuum body B in the space, one maps B on a region of the three-
dimensional Euclidean space E,

? : B ?E , (2.2.1)

for some configuration ?. Usually, ? is some particular configuration of B referred to as the
reference configuration, while ?t is the current configuration at time t.

Once the presence of B in the space has been defined, the motion of a material
body may be investigated. In the reference configuration, a referential or material coor-
dinate X is assigned to the particle X. Nonetheless, when a continuum body moves or
deforms with time, the body particles found at positions X in the reference configuration
? occupy new positions x after certain time t. These new positions occupied by the body
particles in the current configuration ?t are denominated spatial coordinates. Then, the
motion ? of a particle can be mathematically described as

? : B? ×R+ ?Bt , (2.2.2)

(X, t) 7? x = ? (X, t) ,

such that ? is invertible,

X = ??1 (x, t) , (2.2.3)

and B? and Bt represent the body B in the configuration ? and ?t, respectively. In other
terms, Equation (2.2.3) implies that, if all positions x in Bt and the motion ? (X, t) are
known, the positions of the particles in the reference configuration can be determined.

Evidently, different observers may measure space-time events in different ways.
However, as this work only deals with the framework of Newtonian mechanics, the distance
and time intervals between events must have the same values in two reference frames
whose relative motion is rigid. That is, let a change of reference frame, ?, from a non-

7



starred observer to a starred observer

? : E ×R+ ?E ×R+ , (2.2.4)

? : (x, t) 7? (x?, t?) ,

such that the observers follow an event in terms of position and time with proper measuring
devices. Of course, they may use different measuring instruments and obtain distinct
results for the same event. But, if one imposes that these observers must use measuring
devices with the same units of measure, they should obtain the same distance and time
lapse between two events under consideration, although the values of the parameters
measured may be different. Mathematically, this is expressed as

x? = Q(t) (x ? xo) + c (t) , (2.2.5)

t? = t + a,

where a ? R+, xo ? E, c (t) is an arbitrary time-dependent vector, and Q(t) ? O (V ),
such that Q(t) is a time-dependent orthogonal transformation and O (V ) is the orthogonal
group on a vector space V .

A change of reference frame defined by Equation (2.2.5) is referred to as a Eu-
clidean transformation, the most general form of a time-dependent rigid transformation
between two reference systems moving relative to each other. Then, in the Newtonian
space-time one says that a physical quantity is objective or form-invariant under a change
of observers given by Equation (2.2.5) if 1

f? (t?) = f (t) , (2.2.6)

f? (t?) = Q(t) f (t) ,

F? (t?) = Q(t) F (t)Q(t)T ,

1 The definition of objectivity of an observable quantity is more general. An observable quantity f is said
to be form-invariant or objective with respect to some class of change of frame, if

f (·?) = Q†f (·) ,

where Q† is an induced linear transformation on the m-th order tensor space of f. If the class of change
of frame is given by Equation (2.2.5), then f is form-invariant or objective in relation to Euclidean trans-

where f (t), f (t), and F (t) are arbitrary scalar, vector, and second-order tensor physical
quantities dependent on time. In other terms, if the physical quantities noted by two differ-
ent observers for the same event are interrelated through the transformation rules (2.2.6),
then they are objective or form-invariant. 2

Besides, one may further restrict the generality of Equation (2.2.5) by imposing
that Q(t) is constant in time and c (t) is linear in time. Then, Equation (2.2.5) is rewritten
as

x? = Q(x ? xo) + yt + co , (2.2.7)

t? = t + a,

where y and co are arbitrary constant vectors in the three-dimensional Euclidean space
E. Equation (2.2.7) is called a Galilean transformation, a subclass of Euclidean transfor-
mations. Accordingly, every movement can be written in a unique way as a composition
of rotation, translation, and uniform motion.

2.3 General balance statements

As a result of the continuum hypothesis, a physical property G assigned to a finite part Pt
of a continuum body Bt, such as energy, linear momentum or entropy, is defined by some
equation analogous to Equation (2.1.1), i.e., as a density per unit mass or area at every
point inside Pt. In addition, any physical property may change with time through three
kinds of mechanisms: the first one, named supply SG, whose actions are transmitted at
a distance from outside of the body, so that the whole volume of B is directly influenced;
the second mechanism, named flux FG, whose actions are transmitted from outside into
the body through its surface; and the last one, named production PG, whose actions occur
inside the body itself. While the first and the last mechanisms are expressed by mass
densities, the second one is given by surface densities. Hence, the time rate of change for
a physical variable G of the body is written as

dG
dt

= SG + FG + PG , (2.3.1)

or, by the transport theorem [35],

2 Hereafter, the adjectives objective and form-invariant will be always used to express objective quantities
with respect to Euclidean transformations.

are equivalent to the sum of individual contributions of all particles contained in a part Pt
of Bt, dv and da are volume and area elements, respectively, v is the barycentric velocity,
and n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary of the region Bt. Furthermore, the
quantities ? , ?? , and ?? are tensor fields of order m, while ?? is a tensor field of order
m + 1. Of course, if ? is a tensor field of order m = 0, the tensor product ? ? v should be
understood as ?v.

Equation (2.3.1) is the general balance equation of a field G in its integral form,
whereas Equation (2.3.2) is the general balance equation valid at a regular point x. Both
equations can be interpreted as asserting that the variation rate of the quantity G in a part
of Bt is affected by the supply and production of G, as well as by the flux FG through the
boundary region ?Pt. Then, if the body is isolated, SG = 0, FG = 0, and PG = 0, such that
G is constant in time and it is said to be conserved.

One can extend the observations above to a surface in a material body, where the
physical quantity experiences a discontinuity. Across this surface, called singular surface,
the general balance equation is

J?? (v · n ?un)K ? J??K · n = 0 , (2.3.3)

where J?K = ?+ ? ?? stands for the jump of ? across the discontinuity surface, un is
the normal velocity or propagation speed of the singular surface, and, for the sake of
convention, n points into the positive-side of the surface. Nonetheless, if un = v · n, then
the surface is termed material surface and Equation (2.3.3) becomes

J??K · n = 0 . (2.3.4)

Physically, material surfaces differ from singular ones because the former are con-
stituted by the same particles of the material body at all times, whereas singular surfaces
do not consist of the same particles of B at all instants t. Some examples of singular
surfaces are the interface between two immiscible liquids, the phase equilibrium between
two fluids, the shock front in supersonic flows, among others.

2.4 Principles of constitutive theory

In continuum mechanics, material characterization is made by the establishment of some
functional relations, called constitutive equations, among the constitutive variables. The
selection of these variables and the restrictions on these equations are based on the prin-
ciples of constitution as well as on the basic laws of mechanics [29, 35, 37, 68]. Therewith,
one can restrict the generality of the constitutive functions and, if possible, to reduce them
to a small number of coefficients whose values can be experimentally measured.

The principles of constitutive theory are:

PRINCIPLE OF CAUSALITY

The principle of causality is intended for the selection of the independent constitutive vari-
ables of a material subjected to certain actions. In a material subjected to mechanical,
thermal, electromagnetic and chemical sources, some observable changes may occur. At
the outset, one can select a set of independent observable changes as the effects pro-
duced inside the body by such sources. Then, this is the set of independent constitutive
variables for a limited class of physical and chemical phenomena in the material. Once the
independent constitutive variables are selected, all other material properties included in
the balance equations are considered dependent constitutive variables, defined from the
set of independent ones. Note that the balance equations also include external supplies,
which are considered known actions. Usually, it is assumed that dependent constitutive
variables are not explicitly dependent on external supplies.

Of course, the decision about including a constitutive variable into the dependent
or independent set is taken in agreement with the physical effects that one intends to eval-
uate. If a given variable at (x, t) can be solved in terms of other variables of the problem,
an explicit functional mapping from the set of independent variables to the dependent one
can be settled. In general, this mapping is not one-to-one, but, for a large class of materi-
als, the relation cause-and-effect is well-established within the domain of the experiment.
Consequently, such relation can be used to distinguish the set of independent constitutive
variables from the set of dependent ones.

For instance, in a material body, thermomechanical effects are produced by mo-
tion and thermal changes. Thus, the thermomechanical independent variables are usually
the temperature, velocity and its gradient, acceleration, and mass density. If the body re-
sponds to electromagnetic stimuli, it may be polarized and/or magnetized, and it even may
conduct electricity. These effects result from redistribution and motion of bound and free
charges and, therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the electric polarization vector,

11



the electric current vector, and the density of free charges as independent variables. Here,
it is worthwhile to point out that different constitutive models can arise for a given material
since the choice of independent and dependent variables is not unique.

PRINCIPLE OF DETERMINISM

The principle of determinism only considers the dependence of the material behavior at
a particle X on particles Y ? B, and past and current events. Accordingly, the future
phenomena concerning the behavior of the body are fully determined and observable
once all past motions of the body are known. As a direct result, quantum mechanical
phenomena are excluded. Complying with this principle, constitutive equations may be
written as

C (X,t) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X) , (2.4.1)

where C denotes an arbitrary constitutive quantity, R is the response functional or con-
stitutive functional of C,?t is the history of ? up to time t, and s ? [0,?) stands for the
time-coordinate pointed from the present time t into the past.

Equation (2.4.1) allows the description of non-local effects as well as memory
effects in B. The argument ?t runs through all instants in the past, from t?? to the present
time t? 0, describing the memory or remembering capacity of a material in relation to ?t.
In turn, the dependence of the response functional on every material point of the body
Y ?B corresponds to non-local effects. Finally, the explicit dependence of R on X means
the inhomogeneity of the material body, that is, the response functional depends on the
particle X. However, if a response functional of B is the same for all X to a given reference
configuration,

C (·, t) = R(?t (Y,t?s)) , (2.4.2)

and B is called a homogeneous body. In other terms, for an inhomogeneous body, the
constitutive quantity is expressed by (2.4.1), while for a homogeneous one, the constitutive
quantity is given by (2.4.2).

PRINCIPLE OF EQUIPRESENCE

This principle assigns equal rights to all response functionals to depend on all independent
constitutive variables. The principle of admissibility together with various approximations
may eliminate the dependence on some of these variables. But, until such is the case,
one should employ the same list of independent constitutive variables in all response
functionals.

12



PRINCIPLE OF MATERIAL OBJECTIVITY

Just as constitutive quantities depend on the material point and time, they are also depen-
dent on the choice of the reference frame,

C (X,t,?) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,?) . (2.4.3)

Nonetheless, the principle of material objectivity imposes that the response functional of
any objective constitutive quantity C must be the same for any two observers related by
(2.2.5),

R? (·) = R(·) . (2.4.4)

Clearly, for any non-objective quantity, such as total energy density, velocity, ac-
celeration, the spin tensor etc., Equation (2.4.4) does not need to hold. As a consequence,
they need to be replaced by objective quantities in the set of constitutive variables, which
can be done by adding, subtracting or associating other non-objective quantities [35].

Besides imposing that constitutive quantities are independent of the observers,
the principle of material objectivity brings other immediate consequences on the response
functionals. For the sake of simplicity, suppose that ?t is a scalar function e.g. temperature
or mass density. Then, one has

R(??t (Y,t
? ?s) ,X,t?) = Q(t)R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) , (2.4.5)

or by recalling Equation (2.2.6)1,

R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t?) = Q(t)R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) . (2.4.6)

Choosing Q(t) = 1 and c (t) = xo, it follows from Equation (2.2.5) that

x? = x , t? = t + a,

for any a ? R+. Therefore, Equation (2.4.6) takes the form

R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t + a) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) , (2.4.7)

whence one concludes that the response functionals cannot depend explicitly on time. For
this reason, the time dependence in (2.4.1) and (2.4.2) has been omitted since the explicit
dependence of R on t would imply the dependence on the choice of the reference frame.

Here, it is worthwhile to remark that the principle of material objectivity should not

13



to be confused with the term objectivity [20]. The term objectivity denotes transformation
properties of given quantities, whereas the principle of material objectivity postulates the
complete independence of the response functional of an objective constitutive quantity on
the reference frame.

PRINCIPLE OF MATERIAL SYMMETRY

Crystallographic orientations of a body give rise to symmetries in material properties,
which must be accounted for in the constitutive functionals. In fact, one should expect
that the response functionals at two different configurations ? and ?

?
should not be identi-

cal, unless the material body presents a particular symmetry that makes it impossible to
distinguish the configurations ? and ?

?
. For example, the material properties of a body

with cubic symmetry must be invariant in relation to rotation of the reference configuration
? by 90 degrees about one of the crystal axes. Referring to the body configuration after
this rotation to as ?

?
, the configurations ? and ?? are said to be materially indistinguishable,

if

R(·) = R? (·) , (2.4.8)

and

? (B) M?? ?? (B) , (2.4.9)

where both configurations are associated through a linear material symmetry transforma-
tion M that preserves the volume of the body with respect to ?. 3 Thus, physically, the
principle of material symmetry indicates that the response functional of C in relation to a
configuration ? of a material body cannot be distinguished from that in a configuration ??,
provided both configurations are related through a material symmetry transformation M.

Of course, there are many linear transformations for a given configuration ? that
satisfy Equation (2.4.9) and imply Equation (2.4.8). One names all of these linear trans-
formations as the material group symmetry, M? (V ). Hence, a material is called solid if
there exists an undistorted configuration ?? , such that the material group symmetry is the
orthogonal group O (V ) or is contained in it:

M? (V ) ?O (V ) . (2.4.10)

In turn, a material is a fluid if there exists any configuration ? and ??, where

3 See Appendix I for more information about groups of symmetry.

14



M? (V ) = U (V ) . (2.4.11)

Therefore, unlike solids, fluids do not present a preferred configuration.
One may indeed particularize the symmetry conditions above to describe the ma-

terial properties of isotropic, anisotropic, and hemitropic bodies. Hereby, one defines:

• An isotropic body is a body whose material group symmetry is either equal to the
unimodular group or equal to the orthogonal group,

M? (V ) = O (V ) , M? (V ) = U (V ) .

Otherwise, any other materials whose material group symmetry is not the orthogonal
group neither the unimodular group are called anisotropic.

• Generally, anisotropic bodies possess material symmetries that can be represented
by directions, lines or planes. In doing so, anisotropic bodies can be defined as
transversely isotropic and orthotropic bodies, among other classes of symmetry. For
instance, if the material symmetry group satisfies the condition

M1? (V ) = {Q?O (V ) | Qn = n} , (2.4.12)

M1? (V ) presents a preferred direction characterized by n and, then, the material is
said to be a transversely isotropic material. Conversely, if the material symmetry
group follows the condition

M2? (V ) =
{
Q?O (V ) | Q(nm ? nm)QT = nm ? nm

}
, (2.4.13)

where nm is a unit vector in the direction m, so M2? (V ) preserves the characteristic
space of nm ?nm. In other terms, M2? (V ) maintains three mutually orthogonal lines
in the directions n1, n2, and n3. A body with this symmetry is named an orthotropic
material.

• A hemitropic body is a body whose material group is the proper orthogonal group
O+ (V ) ,

M? (V ) = O+ (V ) .

A body may possess various types of material symmetries for its different properties. For
example, an isotropic material with respect to stress and strain may not be isotropic with

15



respect to another property e.g. electric polarization and displacement vectors. In addi-
tion, materials may also be subject to other geometrical and internal constraints, such as
rubbery materials, which are incompressible. This is expressed in the constitutive equa-
tions by the additional condition that the local volume remains unchanged.

PRINCIPLE OF LOCALITY

According to this principle, the values of the response functional at X are not affected
appreciably by the values of the independent constitutive variables at distant points from
X. In other words, the principle of locality implies that the greatest contributions to the
constitutive response at a material point are due to its neighborhoods. Mathematically,
the principle of locality may be expressed in two different ways: the first way, named the
hypothesis of smooth neighborhood, describes the spatial dependence of values of ?t
through a Taylor expansion of t about X, and the second one, named the attenuating
neighborhood hypothesis, describes the spatial dependence of ?t by introducing an in-
fluence function that evaluates how much the points in a distant neighborhood influence
the values of ?t at a specific material point. As the hypothesis of smooth neighborhood
is much more common in continuum thermodynamics than the attenuating neighborhood
hypothesis, it is detailed below.

Suppose that the function ?t (Y,t?s) admits Taylor expansions about X = Y for
all t?s with s ? [0,?),

?t (Y,t?s) =?t (X,t?s) +

where ?(i1...im)t (X,t?s) is the m-th order partial derivative of ?t relative to the vector com-
ponents Yi1, . . . ,Yim evaluated on X at time t ? s. If the material point Y is confined in a
small enough neighborhood of X, ?t (Y,t?s) can be approximated by truncating Equation
(2.4.14) at its first-order directional derivative on X in the direction of Y , viz.

?t (Y,t?s) ? ?t (X,t?s) +
3?

i1=1

(Yi1 ?Xi1 ) ?
(i1)
t (X,t?s) . (2.4.15)

16



In this case, one says that the material at X for all t?s satisfies the smooth neighborhood
hypothesis.

In general, it suffices to assume that the response functional depends only on the
history of ? and its first-order gradient. Thus, Equation (2.4.1) becomes

C (X,t) = R
(
?t (X,t?s) ,?

(i1)
t (X,t?s) ,X

)
(i1 = 1, 2, 3) . (2.4.16)

Of course, for non-local materials, where the effect of long-range intermolecular forces
cannot be negligible, Equation (2.4.16) does not hold. In this case, one should introduce
higher-order gradients of ?t. Theories in which the principle of locality is not obeyed are
referred to as non-local continuum theories.

PRINCIPLE OF MEMORY

This principle is considered the counterpart of the principle of locality in the time domain.
For some materials, physical processes that affected them in a distant past are mostly
erased. In other words, these materials possess weak memory, so that the constitutive
variables at a distant past do not appreciably affect the values of the response functional
at present.

In practical terms, it is extremely rare that a material can remember its whole
history whereby was affected since its memory is bounded. Then, instead of using t ? s
with s ? [0,?) as an argument of ?t, one can proceed analogously to the principle of
locality and use a Taylor series to write ?t (Y,t?s) as

?t (Y,t?s) =?t (Y,t) ?s?

t (Y,t) +

(?s)m ?(m)t (Y,t) + . . . ,

where ?(m)t (Y,t) denotes the m-th partial time derivative of ?t evaluated at point Y and
time t. The use of a Taylor series to express the memory effect of a material body is
known as the hypothesis of smooth memory. If the constitutive functionals are sufficiently
smooth, so that the dependence on ?t (Y,t?s) can be replaced by

?t (Y,t?s) ? ?t (Y,t) ?s?
(1)
t (Y,t) +

one says that the material presents smooth memory, and Equation (2.4.1) becomes

(
? (Y,t) ,?

(1)
t (Y,t) , ...,?

(m)
t (Y,t) ,X

)
. (2.4.19)

In this case, the material is called a rate dependent material of degree m with respect to
the variable ?, so that the far past histories of any physical quantity at Y do not affect the
material behavior at X for time t.

Frequently, materials may not present so a smooth memory as to admit a Taylor
expansion of the form (2.4.17). Then, analogously to the attenuating neighborhood hy-
pothesis, one needs to introduce an influence function which takes into account the time
dependence of the functionals in the far past. Such materials are said to present a fading
memory.

PRINCIPLE OF ADMISSIBILITY

This principle states that constitutive equations must be consistent with the second law of
thermodynamics. In fact, since the second law of thermodynamics must be not violated for
all realizable physical processes, one finds that the thermodynamic admissibility imposed
by the entropy inequality severely restricts the form of constitutive equations.

In practical terms, the principle of admissibility helps to eliminate the dependence
on certain constitutive variables. One can reduce the generality of the constitutive rela-
tions relying upon either different formulations of the entropy principle or even variational
methods. For example, in reference [24] the principle of virtual work is employed to deduce
the proper constitutive equations for an elastic dielectric medium under equilibrium con-
ditions. In turn, in references [61, 62] Sieniutycz proposed a variational approach based
on Onsager’s principle for an electrochemical system under a non-stationary quasi-linear
regime. Even though, despite the impressive results obtained in these works, application
of variational methods is not well-posed for non-isolated systems under the influence of
external forces and also for systems where there exists the possibility of several coupling
phenomena, such as in chemical systems [60]. As a matter of fact, it seems that reacting
chemical systems do not obey the same phenomenological formalism of non-chemical
ones. In electrochemical systems, for instance, coupling between chemical reactions and
non-chemical processes are very common, and one should certainly take them into ac-
count. This is a critical point in the development of a constitutive theory for a reacting ionic
mixture, which requires a more comprehensive approach. Under these circumstances, the
use of entropy principles, in particular the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, is more convenient
to restrict the material equations of electrolyte solutions.

18



2.5 Second law of thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics or entropy principle has been one of the main dis-
cussion topics in Thermodynamics. Since the publication of Carnot and Clausius’ works
[8, 9, 10, 11], different enunciates for the entropy principle have been proposed, with most
of them based on the physical notion of temperature [28].

Following the thermodynamics of homogeneous processes approach [56, 57], the
second law of thermodynamics is formally expressed as:

If at a certain instant, a system absorbs heat Q in a thermically homogeneous
way, at that instant, its entropy S will increase at a rate at least equal to the ratio between
the thermal power absorbed and the empirical temperature ? ? R+. Conversely, if at a
moment the entropy S of the system is decreasing in a thermally homogeneous way, at
that moment heat Q will be liberated and the ratio between the modulus of the thermal
power emitted, and the empirical temperature is at least equal to the rate of the entropy S
decrease, viz.

dQ

dt
? ?

dS

dt
.

The statement above is known as the Clausius-Planck inequality and it was pro-
posed by Planck [54] from his observations about Clausius’ work. Clearly, the extension
of this principle to a continuous body B is not straightforward as the temperature, heat,
and entropy depend not only on time, but also on the point x. In addition, a deeper in-
sight into the Clausius-Planck inequality indicates that this assumption has serious short-
comings since it cannot explain many phenomena occurring inside the system [67]. For
this reason, one needs a more general formulation of the entropy principle, such as the
Clausius-Duhem inequality.

The origins of the Clausius-Duhem inequality go back to the works of Eckart [21,
22] and Meixner [39] who were responsible for the development of the first consistent
non-equilibrium theory. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the so-called entropy balance
equation

?? = ?
d?

dt
+ div (?) ??? ? 0 (2.5.1)

plays a central role as it relates the entropy production density, ?, to various irreversible
processes that occur in a system through macroscopic balance laws. In this equation, ? is
the entropy density, ? is the entropy flux vector, and ? is the entropy supply density. More-
over, from Equation (2.3.3), one may also write the entropy jump condition at a singular
surface as

19



J?? (v · n ?un)K ? J?K · n ? 0 . (2.5.2)

Within the theoretical framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes [17],
the entropy production density may be calculated if one makes use of the Gibbs’ relation
that connects, for instance, the rates of change of entropy in each regular point to the rates
of change of energy and composition in an isotropic multi-component fluid. Complying
with this approach, ? is given by the ratio between the heat flux vector h and the empirical
temperature ?, whereas ? is given by the ratio between the energy supply density r and ?,

?? = ?
d?

dt
+ div

(

?

)
??

r

?
? 0 . (2.5.3)

Inequality (2.5.3) is frequently called of Clausius-Duhem inequality because it represents
Duhem’s extrapolation for the Clausius’s formulation of the second law for non-homogeneous
temperature fields.

For a long period, the inequality (2.5.3), whose exploitation method is based on the
works of Coleman and Noll [13, 67, 68], was extensively used in the development of mod-
ern continuum thermodynamics to impose thermodynamic restrictions on the constitutive
responses of a material body. For simple materials, that is, material bodies whose values
of the constitutive quantities at x depend only on the histories of the deformation gradient,
and temperature and its gradient, linear irreversible thermodynamics and modern contin-
uum thermodynamics with the Clausius-Duhem inequality lead to the same practical re-
sults. This is the reason why linear irreversible thermodynamics and the Clausius-Duhem
inequality are still widely employed. Nevertheless, with the development of continuum the-
ories for mixtures, porous media, and other non-simple material bodies, it was realized
that the two main constitutive assumptions adopted by Coleman and Noll,

? =
h

?
, ? =

r

?
,

are not very satisfactory [73]. Moreover, large deviations from linear behavior are observed
for chemical reactions, restricting the application of linear irreversible thermodynamics
to reacting systems. Since then, other formulations to the entropy principle have been
proposed, among which the one most employed was proposed by Mu?ller [44, 47].

According to Mu?ller’s proposition, the behavior of a continuum body must obey
the general entropy balance stated in (2.5.1), where ? and ? are not a priori given con-
stitutive quantities, such as in the Coleman-Noll exploitation method, but rather consti-
tutive functions on which thermodynamic restrictions must be placed. Even though this
approach of the entropy principle is less restrictive than that proposed by Coleman and

20



Noll, its practical application was still very laborious, even for simple and free of external
supplies bodies. Then, Liu [33] suggested to incorporate new auxiliary quantities, termed
of Lagrange multipliers, in the entropy inequality in order to take into account all balance
equations in the exploitation of the entropy inequality. Thanks to its comprehensive scope,
nowadays the Mu?ller-Liu approach to the entropy principle is widely employed to deduce
restrictions on constitutive equations and thermodynamically consistent constitutive laws
in many research fields. Some examples can be found in references [29, 75].

2.6 Quasistatic approximation of electromagnetism

In addition to the basic laws of motion, electrically polarizable material bodies must obey
Maxwell’s laws of electromagnetism. However, while the former are Galilean invariant, i.e.,
the dynamic laws have the same expressions in any frame related to an inertial frame by a
Galilean transformation, the latter are invariant with relation to the Lorentz transformation.
Consequently, in order to obtain a coherent theory for charged/magnetized continuum
bodies, it is necessary to propose either a relativistic formulation for the laws of dynamics
or employ an approximation in which both the basic laws of motion and Maxwell’s laws are
form-invariant in relation to the same transformation.

With a quasistatic approximation, temporal change rates of electromagnetic quan-
tities are so small that only low acoustic frequencies and non-relativistic velocities are
considered [40, 41]. In this case, Maxwell’s equations are form-invariant with respect to
Galilean transformations, and they are given by

where E is the electric field, H is the magnetic field, I is the electric current, D is the
electric displacement vector, P is the electric polarization vector, q is the charge density,
and B is the magnetic flux vector. Following Chu’s formulation [26] of electromagnetism,
the electric field and the magnetic field are regarded as fundamental quantities, whereas
D and B are auxiliary quantities. These quantities are interrelated by

D = ?oE + P , B = µo(H + M) , (2.6.5)

where ?o and µo are respectively the permittivity and the permeability of free space, and
M is the magnetization field.

Equations (2.6.1)–(2.6.4) are analogous to Maxwell’s laws of electrostatics, but
by no means do the above equations result in a static model. In fact, the temporal de-
pendence of quasi-electrostatic fields can be regarded as a secondary effect because
once given the sources of electromagnetic fields at a particular instant, the fields at that
same instant are determined without knowing what their sources were in earlier times.
Therefore, the mathematical problem of finding a quasistatic electric field for a charge dis-
tribution dependent on time is equivalent to the evaluation of a succession of static fields,
each one with a different charge distribution at various instants t.

Furthermore, according to the quasi-electrostatic approximation, E is an irrota-
tional field, and dynamic currents are so small that the magnetic induction is ignorable.
Thus, from Equation (2.6.3), if the charge density is given, both the curl and divergence of
the electric field are specified.

2.7 Theory of continuum mixtures

The first systematic study of non-equilibrium behavior of continuum mixtures was given
by Truesdell [66, 67] in 1957, and later was extended by Kelly [31] by incorporating elec-
tromagnetic fields. According to Truesdell’s view, a continuum mixture is formed by su-
perposing constituents, so that each spatial point is simultaneously occupied by particles
of all constituents. Incidentally, particles in continuum theories do not represent atoms,
molecules, ions or other classical particles, which can be easily labeled, but rather math-
ematical points endowed with physical properties, such as mass density, velocity, electric

22



field, internal energy density etc. Then, in admitting this hypothesis, only mixtures whose
constituents are not macroscopically distinguishable can be accounted for. Examples of
such mixtures, usually termed classical continuum mixtures, are gas and aqueous solu-
tions and other monophasic systems consisting of two or more chemical species.

A further hypothesis assumed by Truesdell refers to the individual character of
each constituent. Accordingly, each constituent behaves as a single fluid and by analogy
one may assign balance laws for the constituents with single pure materials. Here, the
only difference that appears between these balance laws, and those for single fluids is
the fact that the balance laws of mass, linear and angular momenta, and energy are not
conserved, but only their sums as a whole are formally the same as for a single mate-
rial. Hence, it is taken for granted that the motion of a mixture is governed by the same
equations as for a single body. In other words, by this principle, properties of constituents
are taken as primitives and the properties and balances of the mixture are formulated with
basis in the characteristics of pure chemical substances.

There is indeed another kind of continuum mixtures, where constituent particles
are macroscopically identifiable. This kind of mixture, often referred to as multicomponent
mixtures, does not obey all the assumptions made above since constituents are intimately
intermixed only at the microscopic level. For example, soils, porous rock, suspensions of
coal particles in water, packed powders, granular propellants etc. consist of macroscopic
identifiable solid particles surrounded by one or more continuous media or an identifiable
porous matrix through the continua are dispersed. In this work, multicomponent mixtures
will not be considered.

3 Dynamics of Electrochemical
Systems

A number of the fundamental laws of continuum mechanics are expressions of the con-
servation of some physical quantity. These balance laws are applicable to all continua and
result in equations, either in their integral or local forms, that must always be satisfied. On
the other hand, phenomenological aspects of material bodies are brought through consti-
tutive equations that, unlike balance laws, are specific for each body because they reflect
the internal constitution of a material. However, it is impossible to write down one consti-
tutive equation, which is capable of representing a given material over its entire range of
application since many materials behave quite differently under changing levels of load-
ing. Then, perhaps it is better to think of constitutive equations as being representative of
a particular behavior rather than of a particular material. In fact, the usefulness of the con-
stitutive equations is to describe the relationships among the kinematic, mechanical, and
thermal field equations and to permit the formulation of well-posed problems in continuum
thermodynamics. This will be the subject in the next two chapters.

Hereafter, the motion of the mixture and its constituents are given with relation
to an orthonormal frame of reference, and all quantities are given in terms of the current
configuration, that is, physical properties are expressed in terms of the spatial coordinates
x and time t. Moreover, 1 denotes the unit tensor, ?ij is the Kronecker delta, and brackets
and parentheses are used to represent the antisymmetry and the symmetry of second-
order tensors, respectively.

3.1 Kinematics of electrolyte solutions

Let B be a mixture of n constituents Ba, such that a particle of Ba is represented by Xa
with a = 1, . . . ,n, being the index n reserved for solvent. In addition, let a region of
the Euclidean space E in the current configuration be simultaneously occupied by different
constituent particles. Thus, if Xa is the material coordinate in some reference configuration

25



?, the motion x = xa(Xa, t) of a constituent a is a smooth function of space and time, which
relates a particle Xa to a place Xa at the time t in the reference configuration ?.

Each constituent has its own kinematics. The velocity and acceleration of the
constituent a at time t are, respectively,

va ?
?xa(Xa, t)

?t
, aa ?

?2xa(Xa, t)

?t2
. (3.1.1)

Likewise, each Ba has its own mass and, consequently, its positive mass density ?a (x, t)
at each point x and time t. The mass density of the whole mixture ? (x, t) is related to
?a (x, t) by

? ?
n?
a=1

?a . (3.1.2)

At every (x, t), one also defines the mass concentration of Ba as

?a ?
?a
?
, (3.1.3)

whence Equations (3.1.2) and (3.1.3) imply
n?
a=1

?a = 1.

The mean velocity of B is defined by

?v ?
n?
a=1

?ava , (3.1.4)

and the translational diffusion velocity of Ba is

ua = va ? v . (3.1.5)

Thus, it follows from Equations (3.1.2), (3.1.4), and (3.1.5) that
n?
a=1

?aua = 0.

Until now, the kinematics of reacting ionic mixtures obeys the general framework
of classical mixtures set up by Truesdell [67]. However, in contrast with the classical
theories of mixtures, it has long been accepted that the dynamics of electrolyte solutions
depends on the short-range and long-range interactions among the constituent particles
[76]. Following Eringen and Toupin’s ideas [19, 23, 24, 63, 64, 65], the interactions among
the constituent particles are accounted for by considering the electrolyte solution as a
polar elastic dielectric medium. Then, under an applied electric field, which may be due to
an external source and/or generated by dissociated ions in solution, constituent particles
will interact with the electric field, producing extrinsic body couples and extrinsic surface

26



couples. Consequently, to describe accurately the material behavior of such solutions,
it is necessary to use the theoretical framework of polar theories, where the action of
extrinsic body couples and surface body couples caused by electromagnetic fields on the
constituent particles is properly considered.

Thus, polar theories encompass not only the short-range interactions among the
constituent particles as do the classical local ones, but also the long-range interaction
forces. In this sense, electrolyte solutions differ from the classical mixtures because the
behavior of their material points is influenced by all points of the solution independently
of ions concentrations. Then, in order to include the microscopic structure of electrolyte
solutions into the continuum model, new kinematic variables are associated to each point
(x, t) of the mixture [58].

In constrast with the local theories, where the only kinematic vector field is the
velocity v(x, t), polar materials present two independent kinematic vector fields to describe
the translational and rotational motions of the fluid particles. If the mechanics of rigid
bodies is assumed, each constituent particle possesses a spin field sa(x, t) and a local
angular velocity ?a(x, t), which are interrelated by

sa ? Ia?a , (3.1.6)

where Ia is the inertia momentum tensor.
In polar media, the angular velocity of the particle does not coincide with the

angular velocity of the mixture, viz., vorticity w. The angular velocity of a particle in relation
to the fluid vorticity is given by

$a ? ?a ? w , (3.1.7)

where $a represents the angular velocity of the constituent particle relative to the angular
velocity of the region in which it is embedded. Clearly, all definitions extend to the mixture
particle, so one may equally assign to the mixture particles a spin field s, an angular
velocity ?, and an inertia tensor I, which are related to those of the constituents by

?s ?
n?
a=1

?asa , ?? ?
n?
a=1

?a?a , ?I ?
n?
a=1

?aIa . (3.1.8)

Likewise the translational motion, one also defines a rotational diffusion velocity
of the constituent a as

?a ? ?a ?? , (3.1.9)

27



such that
n?
a=1

?a?a = 0.

3.2 Balance laws for continuum mixtures and their

constituents

It is the main purpose of Electrochemistry to investigate the properties of ionic conductors
and of electric circuits containing ionic conductors, as well as the phenomena that occur
during the passage of an electric current through such circuits. These phenomena include
chemical reactions, structural deformations, mass transport, dissipation of energy to name
only a few. Then, modeling the behavior of electrochemical systems in its simplest form
demands the coupling of balance equations of continuum mixture theory and Maxwell´s
equations. Coupling these equations, one can describe the essential phenomena which
occur in electrochemical systems. However, since interactions among the constituent
particles play an important role in the physico-chemical behavior of these systems, one
should use the conceptual basis of the thermodynamics of polar continua to represent
these interactions.

In order to derive the local balance equations, one starts from the general balance
law for the constituents of the mixture,

??a
?t

+ div (?a ? va ? ??a) ??
?
a ??

?
a = 0 , (3.2.1)

which holds at all points of the body except on the singular surfaces. Once defined Equa-
tion (3.2.1), one relates each variable in Equation (3.2.1) to the physical quantities which
must be present in the mass, linear and angular momenta, energy, and entropy balance
equations. The identifications of the variables for each balance are given in Table 2.1,
where ?a is the internal energy density, ?a is the entropy density, ta is the total stress vec-
tor related to the total stress tensor Ta by ta (x, n, t) = Ta (x, t) n, Ca is the total coupling
stress tensor, ha is the heat flux, ?a is the entropy flux let as an unspecified quantity, ba is
the mechanical body force density, qa is the charge density defined by ?aza, being za the
charge per unit mass, Ea and Pa are the electric field and the electric polarization field
acting on the constituent a, respectively, la is the mechanical coupling body force density,
ra is the mechanical energy supply density, ia is the electric current density due to the
diffusive motion, ?a is the entropy supply density let as an unspecified quantity, ca, ma, ?a,
?a and ?a are the mass , linear and angular momenta, energy and entropy productions,
and oo is the position vector of an arbitrary fixed point.

28



3.2.1 Mass balance

Analogously to a single constituent body, flux and supply vanish in the mass balance of
Ba. Nonetheless, as constituents can take part in chemical reactions, a term of mass
production, ca, should be accounted for. For a regular point x, the mass balance for the
a-th constituent of the mixture is

??a
?t

+ div (?ava) ? ca = 0 , (3.2.2)

where the mass production term is related to the velocities of mass conversion, caj and
cja, by [7]

ca =
n?
j=1

(cja ? caj) . (3.2.3)

If the constituent a is converted into the constituent j at a spatial point x, but the species j
is not converted into the constituent a, then caj &gt; 0 and cja = 0. Inversely, if the constituent
j is converted into the species a and the latter is not converted into the former, then cja &gt; 0
and caj = 0. However, since in chemical systems, chemical reactions can proceed in both
directions, caj and cja can be simultaneously positive at x. Thus, while caj and cja are
non-negative quantities because they correspond to the forward and inverse chemical
reactions velocities, respectively, ca may be positive, negative or null.

The introduction of terms relative to the mass conversion rate of a constituent
a into a constituent j is fundamental to associate the nature of electrolytes to ion-ion
interactions, which determine the properties of electrolyte solutions. The degree with
which these interactions affect the properties of the solution depends on the density of the
distribution of ions in solution that, in turn, depends on the nature of the electrolyte, i.e., it
depends on the electrolyte to be a real or potential one.

Potential electrolytes are those, which through chemical reactions with the solvent
molecules, dissociate into ions. Many of the solutions of potential electrolytes contain only
a small concentration of ions and, therefore, the effects of ion-ion interactions are often
overlooked. The behavior of these solutions is predominantly governed by the equilibrium
position of the reaction between the potential electrolyte and the solvent molecules. Thus,
caj and cja are different for the same point of the mixture until the kinetic equilibrium is
reached.

In contrast, real electrolytes originate ions in solution through physical interactions
between ions in the ionic solid and solvent molecules. Usually, real electrolytes are com-
pletely dissolved in water, so that the resulting solution consists of solvent and solvated

29



ions only. For these solutions, the dependence of their properties on concentration is
determined by the strength of the ionic interactions.

The classification of real and potential electrolytes is a modern one [3] that aims
to describe the behavior of electrolytes through their structures and not through their be-
haviors at some particular solvent. Historically, however, the classification was proposed
with basis in a specific solvent, generally water. Weak electrolytes were then those which
produced solutions with low electrical conductivity when dissolved in water, while strong
electrolytes were those which originated high electric-conducting aqueous solutions. The
disadvantage of the older classification consists in the fact of that as soon as a different
solvent is chosen, a strong electrolyte in water can behave as a weak electrolyte in a
non-aqueous solvent and vice-versa.

The mass balance for the mixture is obtained by considering null the sum of mass

production terms over all constituents that take part in reaction,
n?
j=1

n?
a=1

(cja ? caj) = 0.

Consequently, the last equality imposes that chemical reactions do not change the mass
density of the mixture at every spatial point and time. Hence, from Equations (3.1.2) and
(3.2.2), there remains

??

?t
+ div (?v) = 0 , (3.2.4)

or yet

d?

dt
+ ?div (v) = 0 , (3.2.5)

where the material time derivative following the motion of the mixture, d (·) /dt = ? (·) /?t+
v ·?(·), was used.

Similarly, one may also employ the material time derivative following the motion
of the mixture to simplify Equation (3.2.2). In this case, one recalls Equation (3.1.3), and
then Equation (3.2.2) takes the form

?
??a
?t

+ ?a
??

?t
+ div (??ava) ? ca = 0 . (3.2.6)

Thus, with help of the vector identity div (fu) = ?f ·(u) + fdiv (u) and Equation (3.2.5), it
follows that

?
d?a
dt

+ div (ja) ? ca = 0 , (3.2.7)

where ja ? ?a (va ? v) is the diffusive flux of the constituent a.

30



3.2.2 Linear momentum balance

In electrochemical systems, the movement of ions is responsible for the electric-conducting
properties exhibited by the electrolyte solution. This phenomenon implies the existence
of some force whose character is not exclusively electrostatic since ions experience me-
chanical and chemical forces. If the total electric field is called the effective electric field
Eef , then Eef will not necessarily be a solenoidal vector field [59]. In fact, for an electric-
conducting medium, one has div

(
Eef
)

= femf , where femf is the electromotive force and
it represents the ratio between the energy applied by a power supply and the charge car-
ried by a particle in an electric circuit [30]. For electrochemical cells, the electromotive
force is the electric potential difference between the electrodes when the current through
the cell is null (zero current potential).

If all forces acting on an electric-conducting body, with exception of the Lorentz
force, FL = q (E + v × B), which represents the total electromagnetic force on a charged
species, are combined into a single term, FW , one has

qEef =q (E + v × B) + FW (3.2.8)

=qE + I × B + FW ,

where the definition of electric current, I =
n?
a=1

?azava, was used. 1 Besides, for any system

considered under the quasi-electrostatic approximation [40], qE ? I × B and, therefore,
the magnetic contribution to the Lorentz force can be neglected. Thus, it follows that the
effective electric field is given only by qEef = qE + FW .

1 The electric current density I can be written as follows,

I =

n?
a=1

?azava

=

n?
a=1

?azav +

n?
a=1

zaja ,

where the definition of diffusive flux has been used. The second term of the right-hand side of the ex-
pression above is the electric current due to the relative motion of the various components. Defining

i =

n?
a=1

zaja and ia = zaja, the expression for I becomes

I =

n?
a=1

?azav + i .

31



Evidently, the ion-ion interactions are different from ion-solvent interactions. If the
charge carrier constituents were the only ones responsible for the forces that perchance
exist in a mixture, it would not be possible to explain the real behavior of electrolyte so-
lutions. While coulombic forces are responsible for the ion-ion interactions, the Kelvin
polarization force, P · (?E), is the result of the action of the electric field on the dipoles of
water molecules that make up the solvent. In addition, because the medium is continuous,
one can assume a continuous distribution of dipoles given by

? = ?div (P) . (3.2.9)

Hence, on the basis of the quantities given in Table 2.1, the linear momentum
balance equations for the a-th constituent of the mixture and for the mixture as a whole
are, respectively,

??ava
?t

+ div (?ava ? va ?Ta) ??aba ? qaEa ? Pa · (?Ea) ? ma = 0 , (3.2.10)

??v

?t
+ div (?v ? v ?T ) ??b ? qE ? P · (?E) = 0 , (3.2.11)

or

?
dv

dt
? div (T ) ??b ? qE ? P · (?E) = 0 , (3.2.12)

where ?b =
n?
a=1

?aba, qE =
n?
a=1

qaEa, P =
n?
a=1

Pa,
n?
a=1

ma = 0, such that ma represents

the force per unit volume exerted by all other chemical species of the mixture on the con-
stituent a, and the total stress tensor should be interpreted as the sum of the mechanical
and electromagnetic stress tensors.

Moreover,
n?
a=1

(?ava ? va ?Ta) =
n?
a=1

(?ava ? va) ?
n?
a=1

Ta, which with the use of

Equation (3.1.5), becomes
n?
a=1

(?ava ? va ?Ta) =
n?
a=1

(?ava ? v)+
n?
a=1

(?ava ? ua)?
n?
a=1

Ta.

Thus, since ?v =
n?
a=1

?ava and T I =
n?
a=1

Ta, it follows that
n?
a=1

(?ava ? va ?Ta) = ?v ? v ?

T I +
n?
a=1

(?ava ? ua), whence one concludes that the total stress tensor of the mixture is

32



given by T = T I ?
n?
a=1

(?ava ? ua), being T I the constitutive part of the stress tensor of

the mixture.
Equation (3.2.12) also offers the opportunity of introducing an important tensor

of electrodynamics theory. For this purpose, all mechanical contributions of Equation
(3.2.12) are neglected. In addition, the velocity is supposed to be constant, so that its time
derivative is zero. Thus, from Equation (3.2.12), there remains

?div (T ) = qE + P · (?E) . (3.2.13)

Besides, writing down the coulombic force as qE = Ediv (D), Equation (3.2.13) becomes

?div (T ) = Ediv (D) + P · (?E) . (3.2.14)

This expression may be further simplified by making use of the vector identities div (u ? y) =
?u (y) + udiv (y), 1/2?(u · y) = y × rot (u) + ?u (y), ?(u · y) = div [(u · y) 1 ], Equation
(2.6.5)1, and recalling that, according to the quasi-electrostatic approximation, the electric
field is irrotational. Hence,

div (T ) = div

(
1

2
?oE

21 ? P ? E ? E ? E
)
, (3.2.15)

whence one obtains that the electromagnetic contribution for the total stress tensor is
given by P?E + E?E?1/2?oE21 , being the non-symmetric part given by Tij = PiEj, and
the symmetric part, also known as Maxwell stress tensor, given by T(ij) = EiEj?1/2?oE2?ij.

3.2.3 Angular momentum balance

Since the electrolyte is composed of continuous polar bodies in each point of the mixture,
the angular momentum of each constituent is given by the sum of two parts: the angular
momentum at the center of mass with respect to an arbitrary fixed point, oo×?ava, and the
angular momentum of the constituent relative to its center of mass (spin), ?asa. Similarly,
the supply of angular momentum is the sum of the electromagnetic coupling, Pa ×Ea, the
coupling of mechanical forces, ?ala, and the angular momentum with respect to an arbi-
trary fixed point of the forces acting on the center of mass, oo×[?aba + qaEa + Pa · (?Ea)].
In turn, the flux of angular momentum is given by the coupling stress tensor, Ca, and the
cross product between the position vector and the total stress tensor, oo ×Ta. 2 Finally,

2 See Appendix II for more information about properties of skew-symmetric tensors.

33



the production of angular momentum, ?a, is given by the spin production and the angular
momentum production at the mass center.

Then, having defined these quantities, the angular momentum balance equations
for the a-th constituent and for the whole mixture are, respectively,

? (oo ×?ava + ?asa)
?t

+ div [(oo ×?ava + ?asa) ? va ?Ca ? oo ×Ta]? (3.2.16)

oo × [?aba + qaEa + Pa · (?Ea)] ? Pa × Ea ??ala ??a = 0 ,

? (oo ×?v + ?s)
?t

+ div [(oo ×?v + ?s) ? v ?C ? oo ×T ]? (3.2.17)

oo × [?b + qE + P · (?E)] ? P × E ??l = 0 ,

where C =
n?
a=1

Ca ?
n?
a=1

(?asa ? ua), such that the first term of the right-hand side corre-

sponds to the constitutive part of the coupling stress tensor and
n?
a=1

?a = 0.

Equation (3.2.17) may be further simplified to give the balance of spin. Then,
with the definition of the material time derivative following the motion of the mixture, and
div (oo ×T ) = oo × div (T ) + 2t?, one obtains

?
ds

dt
? div (C) + 2t? ? P × E ??l = 0 , (3.2.18)

where t? is the dual vector associated to the skew-symmetric part of the stress tensor.
Hence, from Equation (3.2.18), the total stress tensor T will be symmetric only

if simultaneously, the time derivative of spin is zero, C is a solenoidal field, the electric
field is strong enough to keep aligned P and E, and mechanical coupling stresses are
absent. Consequently, as usual for polar material bodies, the conservation law of angular
momentum cannot be mutually obtained from the conservation law of linear momentum
since not all torques and forces arise from macroscopic body forces.

The antisymmetry of the stress tensor has been closely related to the microscopic
structure of the mixture, in particular, to the torques that act on the electric dipoles of ions.
When an electric field is imposed on an electrolyte solution, either by an external source
or due to the presence of dissociated ions in solution, the polarization equilibrium of the
electric dipoles of the water molecules is affected. Then, the solvent dipoles are rotated
by a torque given by P × E in order to align them to the electric field. The release of this

34



process to a new position of equilibrium dissipates energy, causing a greater friction on
the ion than that expected if the solvent was an unpolarizable viscous fluid. Therefore,
the ionic mobility and conductivity of the solution are changed as a result of the effects
of electrophoresis and relaxation caused, respectively, by the ion-ion interactions and the
viscous drag force on the ion due to the solvent.

3.2.4 Energy balance

For polar continua subject to the influence of mechanical and electromagnetic fields, the
total energy density is composed of the kinetic energy of rotation, 1/2?asa·?a, kinetic energy
of translation, 1/2?av2a, as well the density of internal energy, ?a?a. Likewise, the heat flux
vector encompasses contributions from mechanical and electromagnetic sources, with the
latter being given by the Poyinting vector, Ea × Ha, that represents the directional energy
flux density of an electromagnetic field. Accordingly, the energy supply and the energy
production are also given by both mechanical and electromagnetic contributions, namely:

• The rate of electrical work per unit volume, ia · Ea;

• The rate of energy supplied per unit volume due to the polarization process of the
medium, P?a · Ea;

• The mechanical power due to the translational motion, va·[?aba + qaEa + Pa · (?Ea)],
and the rotational motion, ?a · (Pa × Ea + ?ala);

• The energy supply, ?ara, due to external sources, such as radiation;

• The energy production, ?a, which accounts for the production of energy due to chem-
ical reactions, and translational and rotational motions.

Thus, the local forms of the energy balances for each constituent of the mixture and for
the mixture as a whole are, respectively,

Here, note that the heat flux vector and the internal energy density of the mixture contain
terms due to the translational and rotational motions that cannot be mutually eliminated,
indicating that the translational and rotational motions contribute differently to h and ?.
Similarly, the energy supply density presents contributions from mechanical and elec-
tromagnetic sources as well as from the macroscopic and microscopic structures of the
solution that cannot be canceled too. Thus, mechanical and electromagnetic sources and
macroscopic and microscopic structures of the mixture have different effects on r.

Equation (3.2.20) may be written in an alternative form, if the material time deriva-
tive following the motion of the mixture, and Equations (3.2.5), (3.2.12) and (3.2.18) are
used. Then, Equation (3.2.20) takes the form

?

which is known as the balance of internal energy of the mixture.

36



3.2.5 Entropy balance

The entropy balance reflects the fact that observable thermodynamic processes are irre-
versible. With this in mind, it is postulated that [49] (i) there exists an additive objective
scalar quantity, named entropy density, for each constituent and the mixture as one, (ii)
the entropy density and the entropy flux are constitutive quantities, and (iii) the entropy
production of the whole mixture is a non-negative quantity for all realizable physical pro-
cesses. With these assumptions, the entropy balance for each constituent of the mixture
is given by

??a?a
?t

+ div (?a?ava + ?a) ??a?a ??a?a = 0 , (3.2.22)

whereas the entropy balance for the mixture is

?? =
???

?t
+ div (??v + ?) ??? ? 0 , (3.2.23)

or yet by Equation (2.5.1),

?? = ?
d?

dt
+ div (?) ??? ? 0 ,

where ?? =
n?
a=1

?a?a, ? =
n?
a=1

(?a ??a?aua), ?? =
n?
a=1

?a?a, and ?? =
n?
a=1

?a?a ? 0.

Observe that the entropy production for each constituent, ?a, may take any value, provided
the entropy production of the whole mixture, ?, is a non-negative quantity. This assumption
results in a weak limitation of the entropy principle that is termed Truesdell’s axiom of
dissipation [67].

4 Electrochemical Systems: Interionic
Interactions

The balance equations previously shown are fundamental physical laws that are valid for
all bodies irrespective of their constitution and unalterable within the domain of classical
mechanics. On the other hand, the responses of different material bodies of same geom-
etry subject to identical loads are, in general, different. To take into account the nature
of different materials, a set of constitutive equations must be constructed. These equa-
tions depend on the nature and the range of physical effects desired, and they are based
on certain basic principles and thermodynamic restrictions deduced from the entropy in-
equality. Together with the balance field equations, constitutive equations form a system of
differential equations whose every solution is a thermodynamic process. These solutions,
in turn, are particularized through initial and boundary conditions for certain experimental
conditions. Once this is done, the constitutive theory proposed is ready to be exploited in
several practical applications.

4.1 Interactions among the constituent particles in

electrolyte solutions

The dependence of many properties of electrolyte solutions on concentration is deter-
mined by interionic interactions and ultimately by the mean distance among the ions in
solution. A requirement for studying in detail ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions is to
compute the chemical potential change due to the interactions of the ionic species a with
other ions in solution and the solvent. The latter can be determined by considering the
transfer of an ion from medium 1 of relative permittivity ?1 to medium 2 of relative per-
mittivity ?2. If medium 1 is set up as vacuum, the energy required in this process is the
energy of solvation and it provides a notion about whether ionic species in solution inter-
act with the solvent molecules (Born solvation model). Conversely, analysis of interaction
forces among the ions in solution comes from the calculation of the electrostatic potential

39



produced at a reference ion by the rest of ions in solution (Debye-Hu?ckel model). If one
knows the time-averaged spatial distribution of the ions, one can determine how the other
charges are distributed as a function of distance from the reference ion. Hereby, one of
the fundamental laws of electrostatics, namely, the law of the superposition of potentials,
may be used to set the potential at a point as being the sum of the potentials due to each
of the charges in the assembly [3, 51].

Of course, as any theoretical model, the ideas above present shortcomings, but
both models represented a great advance in the understanding of the behavior of ionic
mixtures. Particularly, the study of interionic interactions allows to understand the de-
parture from ideality in electrolyte solutions, which was shown to be mainly due to the
changes in the nature of interactions among the particles. As the solution becomes more
concentrated, chemical species are closer and long-range as well as short-range interac-
tions become important. In short, coulombic interactions among ions are not sufficient to
describe the dynamics of concentrated solutions, and other types of interactions must be
included e.g. repulsion among the chemical species, ion-dipole interactions, and dipole-
dipole interactions.

As a matter of fact, when the Debye-Hu?ckel model is tested against experimental
results, it is very successful in accounting for the behavior at low concentrations. How-
ever, at moderate and higher concentrations deviations from ideal behavior become more
apparent because other assumptions made by Debye and Hu?ckel also fail, viz. [25]:

• Because interionic forces are treated only in terms of short-range coulombic forces,
the random motion of ions is neglected;

• All electrolytes behave as real electrolytes;

• Ions are considered spherically symmetrical and unpolarisable. This hypothesis is
not valid even for simple ions, such as NO?3 (aq) and SO

2?
4 (aq), which are not spher-

ically symmetrical. Other large ions, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate and many
of those encountered in bio and geological media, certainly are non-spherically sym-
metrical. Likewise, many ions are not unpolarisable and simple ions such as I?(aq)
are indeed highly polarisable;

• The solvent is a structureless dielectric, so that its molecular structure is assumed
not to interfere in the way ions interact with the solvent;

• Electrostriction of ions is ignored. But, because of the intense electric fields near the
ions, they may be deformed;

40



• Ions are spherically distributed around the central ion. This is a crucial part of the
Debye-Hu?ckel model, and even though it has been dealt with by statistical mechan-
ical averaging procedures [27], only spherical symmetry has been assumed. Any
distribution of ions around a spherically symmetrical central ion does not necessar-
ily need to be spherically symmetrical, but on average, all possible arrangements
will correspond to spherical symmetry. Because a charge density corresponds to
an average distribution of ions, so conversion of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to
spherical symmetry is purely formal. However, as was stated above, there is one
important limitation to this when considering large ions. Here, the central ion is non-
spherical and, therefore, a spherically symmetrical distribution of charge around it
may not be possible. Briefly, the Debye-Hu?ckel model is applicable only for a spher-
ical central ion.

An interionic theory under these conditions is obviously limited and other attempts to over-
come these constraints are desirable. One way of coping with these limitations is to em-
ploy the continuum thermodynamics approach by coupling elements of polar theory with
classical continuum mixture theory. With this approach, one shows that it is possible to
account for microscopic interactions with the fluid flow through a skew-symmetric stress
tensor and body couplings.

4.2 Proposed continuum model

It is the purpose of this chapter to discuss the dynamics of aqueous electrolyte solutions.
Such solutions are assumed to be diluted, so the main fluid (water) is much more dom-
inant than all other constituents. As a result, the thermodynamics of the mixture can be
described as that of the main fluid. Under these conditions, one temperature field is re-
quired and the linear and angular momenta of the mixture coincide with those of solvent.
Consequently, only the balances of energy and linear and angular momenta for the whole
mixture are employed.

Moreover, in determining the behavior of electrochemical systems by evaluating
the fields ? (x, t), ?a (x, t), v (x, t), $ (x, t), ? (x, t), and E (x, t), one presumes that most of
the effects revealed by electrochemical systems are accounted for by the dependence on
the mass density and its gradient, concentration and its gradient, velocity and its gradient,
relative local angular velocity, gradient of local angular velocity, temperature and its gradi-
ent, and electric field. In other words, the set of the independent constitutive variables y
is

41



y ?{?,??,?a,??b, v,?v,$,??,?,??, E} (?a,b = 1, ..,n? 1) . (4.2.1)

Nonetheless, as the principle of material objectivity requires that constitutive functions
must be independent of the observers, constitutive functions do not depend on the ve-
locity, and they depend on the velocity gradient only through its symmetric part, called
the stretching tensor, D. Furthermore, $ is also a non-objective quantity, but by using
a linear map (duality map) one can establish a one-to-one correspondence between a
skew-symmetric objective tensor and a non-objective vector. That is, the dependence of
the constitutive functions on $ occurs by a skew-symmetric tensor of type Wij = eijk$k.

One may also exploit the irrotational nature of the quasistatic electric field and
define it in terms of a scalar function. Recalling the Helmholtz theorem, one writes

E ????, (4.2.2)

where ? is the electric potential. In other words, the electric field in quasi-electrostatic
approximation is completely specified only by its scalar source (Gauss law).

With these assumptions, (4.2.1) becomes

y ?{?,??,?a,??b,?,??, E,D,W ,??} (?a,b = 1, ..,n? 1) , (4.2.3)

where E transforms as an objective quantity in the quasi-electrostatic approximation. In-
cidentally, constitutive relations must be formulated for

C ? {ja,ca,T ,C, P,?, h, i,?, ?} (?a = 1, ..,n? 1) , (4.2.4)

which are dependent on the variables (4.2.3). Through the dependence of (4.2.4) on
(4.2.3), one proposes a constitutive class capable of describing the chemical changes
caused by the passage of electric current, and the transport phenomena caused by elec-
trochemical reactions in a viscous fluid. This constitutive class will characterize the ma-
terial response of a mixture of viscous polar fluids with diffusion, chemical reactions, and
conduction of heat and electric current.

Once all relevant constitutive assumptions and balance equations have been es-
tablished, the entropy principle can be exploited. For a physically realizable process of
the mixture investigated, the entropy inequality (2.5.1) must be satisfied subject to the
simultaneous satisfaction of the balance laws (2.6.3), (3.2.5), (3.2.7), (3.2.12), (3.2.18),

42



and (3.2.21). Instead of fulfilling the entropy inequality for independent fields that are con-
strained by the balance laws, one employs the method of Lagrange multipliers proposed
by Liu [33]. According to this approach, the entropy inequality is subtracted from the prod-
ucts of each balance equation with its corresponding Lagrange multiplier, so that it can
be satisfied for unrestricted independent fields. For the mixture investigated, the extended
entropy inequality

holds for any solution {? (x, t) ,?a (x, t) , v (x, t) ,? (x, t) ,? (x, t) , E (x, t)} of the field equa-
tions, where ?o is homogeneous. Here, the quantities ??, ?v, ??a , ??, ??, and ?G rep-
resent the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints placed on the entropy in-
equality by the balance equations. These Lagrange multipliers may be given by constitu-
tive relations too.

In addition to previous constitutive assumptions, some further premises must be
taken into account, most of which are plausible. They are:

• Even though the solvent mass is much bigger than the masses of the other con-
stituents of the mixture (this hypothesis is feasible up to 1.0 × 10?1 mol L?1), the
electrolyte solution may not behave as an ideal dilute solution. If so, interactions
among the constituent particles of the mixture have a great influence on the ther-
modynamic behavior of the solution and, thus, they must be accounted for. In this
chapter, such interactions are considered by assembling concepts of polar and con-
tinuum mixture theories. Consequently, new phenomenological coefficients should
appear in the constitutive model proposed;

• For many materials whose constitutive class does not encompass the time derivative
of temperature, d?/dt, in the set of independent constitutive variables, and the heat
flux is collinear to the entropy flux, then the Lagrange multiplier of energy is the

43



reciprocal of the empirical temperature, ?? = 1/?, also referred to as coldness [73].
This definition was obtained by Mu?ller [45, 46, 47, 48] by assuming the existence of
a special kind of material singular surface, the so-called ideal surface, across which
the entropy jump condition is

J?K · n = J??hK · n = 0 ? J?K = 0 . (4.2.6)

Whenever an ideal wall separates two bodies, the jump condition above is the re-
quirement that the normal component of the entropy flux is continuous. In practical
terms, Mu?ller took for granted that Equation (4.2.6) is necessary to make the tem-
perature measurable through a thermometer. Moreover, as a direct consequence of
the existence of such ideal surfaces between any material body brought into con-
tact with a single body, Equation (4.2.6) always will imply that ?? = 1/?. However,
for many material classes e.g. granular and porous media and multiphase mixtures
exhibiting a single temperature, ideal material surfaces do not exist. In reference
[74], Wilmanski found conditions for which the temperature is continuous across a
material singular surface in a fluid-solid mixture. The first of these conditions allows
no entropy production on the singular surface, and the second one requires either
impermeability of the surface or continuity of the Gibbs energy across the surface.
Indeed, for theories with multiple temperatures, this situation is even worse since the
problem does not have a solution yet. Hence, in view of these considerations, in this
work it is assumed that under sufficiently general conditions, there exists an ideal
surface across which the temperature, and the tangential velocity are continuous,
such that the behavior of the electrochemical system is not affected;

• The definition of ??a can be obtained by taking into account a semipermeable mem-
brane, which separates the reacting ionic mixture and one of its constituents a [36].
Excluding the possibility of tangential velocities at the wall and by assuming that the
temperature is continuous at the membrane, one obtains the following jump expres-
sion,

J?
??a

??
+

1

(va ?unn)

2K = 0 .

The first term on the left-hand side of the expression is named chemical potential,
µ?a , whereas the second one is the kinetic energy of the motion of the constituent a
in relation to the semipermeable wall. Clearly, only the chemical potential is a con-
stitutive quantity, and it is easily related to the Lagrange multiplier of concentration
by µ?a = ???a/??;

44



• The definition of ?? comes from the evaluation of equilibrium conditions for a viscous
heat-conducting fluid, i.e., p = ????/?? [29, 74]. Then, because of the great excess
of solvent mass in relation to the masses of other constituents, the dynamics of
a reacting ionic mixture is nearly the same as for a viscous heat-conducting fluid.
Consequently, one may use the previous definition without loss of generality;

• Since the constitutive properties of a reacting ionic mixture should not depend on
external supplies, it suffices to consider supply-free mixtures. In other terms, the
entropy supply vanishes as long as the linear momentum, spin, and energy sources
are null,

?b = 0 ,?l = 0 ,?r = 0 ? ?? = 0 .

• The mixture is an isotropic medium. However, exceptionally, the degree of polar-
ization of the electrolyte solution and its constituents is completely determined by
a non-linear anisotropic function of type Pi = ?1ijEj + ?

2
ijkEjEk + . . ., where ?

m is
the m-th order electric susceptibility. In general, for weak electric fields, ?m is a
constant characteristic of the dielectric medium, and it depends on the temperature
since thermal agitation tends to oppose the order of electric dipoles induced by E
[59]. Thus, owing to the great excess of solvent mass in relation to the masses of
the other constituents, the dielectric properties of the whole solution are due almost
exclusively to the electric dipoles of water molecules.

Substituting the constitutive relations (4.2.3) and (4.2.4) into inequality (4.2.5) and by per-
forming all required differentiations according to the chain-rule, one obtains

Alternatively, inequality (4.2.7) can be expressed as

46



? = A (y) · Z + B (y) ? 0 , (4.2.8)

where A (y) and B (y) are respectively vector and scalar functions of the variables y listed
in (4.2.3), but not of Z,

Hence, by the principle of local solvability [33, 35] Liu demonstrated that the inequality
(4.2.8) must hold for arbitrary values of y and Z. The necessary and sufficient condition
for this is

A (y) = 0 , B (y) ? 0 . (4.2.10)

In other words, (4.2.10) indicates that the coefficients of Z must vanish, otherwise expres-
sion (4.2.8) could be violated. These arguments lead to the following Liu identities

whence certain thermodynamic relations are expected to be maintained, namely:

1. The thermodynamic potential, ? = ???? ? 1/?P · E, is function of ?, ?a, ?, and E;

2. The Lagrange multipliers of the balance equations of linear momentum, spin, and
Gauss law are zero:

?? = 0 , ?v = 0 , ?G = 0 ;

reduced independence on the list (4.2.3) for the thermodynamic potential ?. Then, with
the aid of the thermodynamic potential ? and the definitions of hydrostatic pressure,

electromagnetic fields are absent, relation (4.2.13) coincides with the Helmholtz relation
of the classical thermostatics. However, the former is more comprehensive than that of
classical thermostatics because it holds for any point of the material body and it is valid
under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions.

Moreover, in view of previous constitutive assumptions presented, one demon-
strates by cross differentiation of the Liu identities (4.2.11)1,3,7,9 that ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ? =
?? (?,?,?a), ?? = ??? (?,?,?a), and ??a = ???a (?,?,?a). One also shows from relation (4.2.13)
and the reduced dependencies above that the integrability conditions for d? are

where P is function only of E, as previously stated.
The second statement is a direct result of identity (4.2.11)11 and it does not de-

serve additional comments. On the other hand, the third statement results from iden-
tity (4.2.12), which suggests the introduction of an extra entropy flux defined by ? =

(4.2.12)1,2,5, the theorem of Cartesian decomposition of tensors was used in order to im-
pose that only the symmetric parts of ?(??), ?(??b), and ?(??) need to vanish. The
proof of this statement can be easily found in reference [35].

With the definition µ?a = ???a/??, the reduced dependence of ??a should be reflected in
µ?a and, then, µ?a = ˆ?µa (?,?,?a). Consequently, since the derivatives above must vanish,
sym (??/???) = 0, sym (??/???b) = 0, ??/?W = 0, ??/??? = 0, sym (??/???) = 0,
??/?E = 0, and ??/?D = 0, the extra entropy flux vector is zero, and ? can be rewritten

Nevertheless, before discussing the consequences of inequality (4.2.16) on the
constitutive quantities listed in (4.2.4), an important concept of chemical thermodynamics
deserves to be presented. The symmetrical of the chemical affinity of a reaction r is

fr =
n?1?
a=1

?arµ?a , (4.2.17)

where ?ar divided by the molecular mass of constituent a is proportional to the corre-
sponding stoichiometric coefficient in the chemical reaction r, and the solvent is regarded
as inert because of its great excess in the mixture. For the sake of convention, ?ar is taken
as positive for the products of a reaction, and negative for the reagents. In addition, in
agreement with Bedford and Bowen’s ideas [2, 5, 7], the mass production of a is the net
rate of mass supply to constituent a resulting from chemical reactions. Mathematically, the
mass production of constituent a is expressed by

ca =
R?
r=1

?ar?r , (4.2.18)

where ?r is the rate of conversion of r, supposing R independent chemical reactions.

Inequality (4.2.19) is the residual entropy production and comprises a necessary
condition to inequality (4.2.5) to be maintained for any solution
{? (x, t) ,?a (x, t) , v (x, t) ,? (x, t) ,? (x, t) , E (x, t)} of the field equations.

4.2.1 Thermodynamic restrictions

The thermodynamic equilibrium state at (x, t) of a reacting ionic mixture is defined as that
thermodynamic state in which the residual entropy production attains the minimum value,
expressly zero. This definition of local thermodynamic equilibrium state does not require
that the quantities ? ? {?r,??,?µ?a, E,??,D} are time independent neither spatially
homogeneous nor null. In other words, this condition asserts that, at a material point, any
local thermo-electromechanical state can be an equilibrium state provided the ? quantities
have appropriate values. As a consequence, ? must satisfy

? : ? ? Y | ? ?{?r,??,?µ?a, E,??,D} (4.2.20)(

where the index E stands for local equilibrium state.
From inequality (4.2.19) and relation (4.2.20), the first-order derivatives of the

residual entropy production in relation to ?µ?a, ??, and ?? result in(
??

and (

Hence, at local equilibrium, there are no diffusive fluxes of species neither flux of heat, nor
coupling stresses. Moreover, for ?r, inequality (4.2.19) and relation (4.2.20) lead to(

??

??r

)????
E

= ?fr = 0 (?r = 1, . . . ,R) , (4.2.24)

where the result above is the known local chemical equilibrium condition. Note that the
local chemical equilibrium does not require local kinetic equilibrium, that is, the mass
concentrations time derivative of the constituents of the mixture may not be null. In fact,
since for non-homogeneous electrochemical systems Equation (2.2.7) holds, one easily
obtains from relations (4.2.17) and (4.2.18),

is zero.

that produces

T = ?p1 ,

and (
??

?E

E

= i = 0 . (4.2.27)

In addition, observe that the necessary conditions to obtain local thermodynamic
equilibrium are different that characterize macroscopic thermodynamic equilibrium, viz. a
state in which all constituents are at rest in relation to one frame of reference and thermo-

52



dynamic quantities, such as temperature gradient, velocity gradient, rate of conversion of
a reaction etc. are time-independent and uniform [47]. On the other hand, one can ob-
tain these conditions from the local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by constructing
appropriate Lyapunov functions through the definition of the entropy flux vector and the
balance equations, as shown in [12].

The constitutive modeling of reacting ionic mixtures proceeds by analyzing the
second restriction invoked by the entropy principle on (4.2.4) to find restrictions on phe-
nomenological parameters. For the sake of simplicity, it is imposed that the microscopic
structure of the system does not influence diffusive fluxes as well as the current flow.
Thus, the influence of local angular motion was considered only on the total stress tensor,
coupling stress tensor, and the heat flux, such as in references [14, 16, 32].

Furthermore, unlike common electrolyte models, the fluxes of heat, mass and
electric current are not given exclusively by their usual sources, but also by the cross
phenomena of thermo-electricity, thermal diffusion, and electrophoresis. Therefore, con-
sidering the representation of isotropic constitutive functions [70, 71, 72], it follows that

Tij = ?p?ij +

where D?ij and ??i,j are respectively the traceless part of D and ??, O (2) denotes the
terms whose order is bigger than one in each constitutive function, and all phenomeno-
logical coefficients are functions of ?, ?, ?a, ??a ·??a, ?? ·??, E · E, ??a ·??, ??a · E,
?? · E, and trD. Note that if the microscopic structure of the mixture had been included
in the conduction current and the diffusive flux, new phenomenological coefficients should
appear in Equations (4.2.28)4,5 whose physical meaning has not been clarified yet.

Despite its inherent simplicity, Equation (4.2.28) is suitable to describe the diffu-
sive and advective structures of electrolyte solutions far from the equilibrium. Nonetheless,
as de Groot and Mazur [17] pointed out, the linear approximation for chemical reactions is
not justifiable, except near an equilibrium state when the chemical affinity holds a recipro-
cal relation with the rate of conversion. Indeed, far from the equilibrium, chemical affinity
is essentially a non-linear function of ?r, and its form varies according to the complexity of

53



the reaction. Actually, the task of determining a phenomenological equation for fr is quite
complicated and unusual in Chemistry. Then, on account of these arguments, chemical
affinity is treated only in general terms without specifying its constitutive nature.

Ca3 , k1, and ?2 stand for diffusion, thermal conductivity, and resistivity coefficients,
respectively. In turn, phenomenological coefficients Ca1 and k3 are characteristic for the
phenomenon of thermal diffusion, k2 and ?1 for the thermoelectric phenomenon, and Ca2
and ?3 for the electrophoretic phenomenon. All these effects mentioned are known as
cross phenomena and they present reciprocal nature in contrast to Fick’s law, Fourier’s
law, and Ohm’s law. Viscous properties of the electrolyte solution are accounted for by
? + 2/3?, ?, ?, ? + 2/3?, ?, ?, and ?, where ? + 2/3? and ? denote respectively the bulk and
shear viscosities of Newtonian fluids, while ?+2/3?, ?, ?, and ? are the rotational viscosities
that arise due to the inner structure of the mixture. An electrolyte solution which presents

54



rotational viscosities constrained by (4.2.30)9,10,13,14 exhibits a resistance to motion bigger
than or equal to that of the viscous fluids under usual flow conditions.

Moreover, if one neglects all phenomena with exception of the chemical reactions
in inequality (4.2.29), one writes

5 Electrochemical Systems: Transport
Phenomena

The study of ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions aims to know whether ions interact dy-
namically with the solvent molecules and other ions in solution. In turn, the study of mass
transport in electrolyte mixtures covers diffusion and conductance of ions, where much of
the basis is phenomenological. As a matter of fact, one may study the mass transport in
electrolyte solutions by focusing on the individual motion of ions, that is, by following ions
trajectories in the electrolyte and the speeds with which they stream around. Nonetheless,
because these ionic movements are of random nature with relation to direction and speed,
it is quite hard to trace individual ions trajectories in the mixture, unless some radioactive
tracer is used.

Conversely, one may investigate the mass transport in electrochemical systems
by tracking the movement of a group of ions in a certain direction, producing a drift or flux.
This point of view is much more interesting than the first one since ionic drift results in
matter transport and flow of charge. Moreover, there is another aspect that justifies the
analysis of ionic drift, instead of the individual motion of ions: if a directional ionic flow
did not occur, the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte of an electrochemical
system would be out of ions to maintain the charge-transfer reactions that happen at these
interfaces. Therefore, the drift of ions is of fundamental significance to the dynamics of an
electrochemical system.

Electrochemistry literature [3, 4] supposes that a flux of ions can arise from three
mechanisms. If there is a difference in the concentration of ions in different regions of
the electrolyte, the resulting concentration gradient produces a flow of ions, and the phe-
nomenon is termed diffusion. If there is a difference in electric potential at various points
in the electrolyte, then the resulting electric field produces a flow of charge in its direction,
and the phenomenon is termed migration or conduction. Finally, if a difference in pressure,
density or even temperature exists in various parts of the electrolyte, then there exists a
fluid flow caused by natural or forced convection whose flow regime may be characterized
by stagnant regions, laminar flow, turbulent flow, among others.

57



Obviously, the relative contributions of diffusion and migration to the flux of a
species differ at a certain instant for different locations in the electrochemical system.
Near the electrode, an electroactive substance is, in general, transported by both pro-
cesses. Differently, far from the electrodic surface, an electroactive substance is carried
by the migrational mechanism, and the diffusion plays a secondary role because the con-
centration gradient is generally small in the bulk phase.

For many electrochemical systems, the mathematical treatments are simplified if
the migrational and convective components to the flux of the electroactive substance are
made negligible. This may be reached if an excess of supporting electrolyte– an electrolyte
solution whose constituents are not electroactive in the range of applied potentials and
whose ionic strength is usually much larger than that of the electroactive substance under
consideration– is added into the solution, and the electrochemical system is kept at rest.
Even so, one needs more physical restrictions on the electrochemical system in order to
obtain a simplified mathematical treatment.

In a more realistic description of electrochemical systems, where the temperature
is not spatially uniform, it seems that the definitions above are not very convenient. In this
case, the theoretical framework provided by the classical electrochemistry literature may
not be comprehensive enough, and a new approach should be used. Such an approach
is provided next.

5.1 Proposed continuum model

The electrochemical system is regarded as an apolar material body formed by two regions:
a region of ionic conduction (bulk) and another that corresponds to an electrically charged
interface (double layer). The former is an isotropic medium whose concentration and
electric potential gradients of species are not significant. Consequently, the concentration
of any species is virtually constant and the basic phenomena involve ion-solvent and ion-
ion interactions. On the other hand, the double layer is an inhomogeneous and anisotropic
medium in relation to the mass, heat and current fluxes, and it comprises the region where
the transfer of electrons between the electrode and the ionic solution takes place. For
the sake of simplicity, the anisotropy of the double layer is treated as a special case of
transverse isotropy, i.e., there is an isotropic plane such that all directions in this plane are
equivalent and all constitutive relations remain unchanged under arbitrary rotations of a
coordinate system in relation to a major axis. Under these conditions, the fluxes of mass,
heat and electric current present a preferred direction that is orthogonal to the isotropic
plane.

58



Furthermore, the separation between the double layer and the bulk is marked by
abrupt changes of the electric potential and species concentrations. Mathematically, these
changes are accounted for through a singular surface that separates the bulk and double
layer. At the singular surface, corresponding jump conditions for balance equations must
be formulated. Nevertheless, the properties of the singular surface are not examined in
this work.

5.1.1 Bulk region

In order to investigate the occurring physical phenomena in the bulk region, the basic
fields– mass density of the mixture, ? (x, t), mass concentration, ?a (x, t), empirical temper-
ature, ? (x, t), electric potential, ? (x, t), and velocity of the mixture, v (x, t)– are evaluated
by regarding the bulk as a heat and electric conducting viscous mixture. Thus, most of its
properties are taken into account through the set of independent constitutive variables

y ?{?,??,?a,?,??,?, v,?v} (a = 1, . . . ,n? 1) . (5.1.1)

However, as the principle of material objectivity requires that constitutive quantities must
not depend on the observer, constitutive functions are independent of velocity, and they
only depend on the gradient of velocity through its symmetric part, represented by the
stretching tensor D. Thus,

C = C? (?,??,?a,?,??,?,D) , (5.1.2)

where C ? {?, ?,T , P,?, h, i}.
The determination of the basic fields proceeds by evaluating the inequality,

? =?

which does not need to hold for arbitrary fields ? (x, t), ?a (x, t), ? (x, t), ? (x, t), and v (x, t),
but rather for those that are solutions of the balance equations considered. Thus, one

59



may take the balance equations as representing constraints on the fields that satisfy the
entropy inequality [33].

In addition to the constitutive assumptions presented in the previous section,
further hypotheses are necessary to guarantee the adequacy of the constitutive model.
These auxiliary hypotheses are valid for both bulk and double layer regions. They are:

• The influence of interactions among the constituent particles on the system dynam-
ics is neglected. In fact, there are many reasons to consider the bulk and double layer
as apolar media and, consequently, overlook these interactions. The first motive is
associated with the experimental difficulties in dealing with some phenomenological
coefficients that appear in the diffusive and electric current fluxes, which have not
been experimentally well-established yet. The second reason concerns the experi-
mental limitations of electrochemical devices in operating with concentrated or mod-
erately concentrated mixtures. In this case, the approximation of ideal dilute solution
is not valid, resulting in the lack of reliable data in the electrochemical literature for
these solutions. Finally, even if the influence of interactions among the constituents
particles on concentrations was taken into account through the activity of ions, the
Debye-Hu?ckel model can no longer be used to relate the activity to the concentration
of ions in non-dilute electrolyte solutions. Hence, if one desires to test the continuum
model here proposed and compare the theoretical values obtained with the experi-
mental ones, one should start with dilute solutions of 1.0 × 10?5 mol L?1–1.0 × 10?3

mol L?1, where the contribution of interactions among species particles on mixture
dynamics can be neglected;

• The Lagrange multiplier for the energy equation is inversely proportional to the tem-
perature,

?? =
1

?
.

This assumption is valid, provided one assumes the existence of an impermeable
ideal wall in electrochemical systems, where the entropy production vanishes, and
the entropy flux and the temperature are continuous;

• Extending the definition of ??a provided in the last chapter to a medium under influ-
ence of quasi-electrostatic fields, ??a may be decomposed into an intrinsic constitu-
tive part, a kinetic part, and an electric potential contribution, viz.

J?
??a

??
+

1

2
(va ?unn)

2 ?za?K = 0 .

The intrinsic part of ??a is the chemical potential of a, µ?a = ???a/??. On the other

60



hand, µa = µ?a ?za? is the electrodynamic potential since the energy state of a con-
stituent carrier of charge in any location of the electrolyte solution clearly depends
on the chemical environment and its own electric nature. Of course, if the chemical
species is not a charge carrier, µa = µ?a;

• The term ca only deals with mass production due to electrodic reactions, i.e., reac-
tions that take place at the electrode surface. Thus, ca = 0 for the bulk, and ca 6= 0
for the double layer;

• As the medium is apolar, angular momentum balance indicates that the stress tensor
is symmetric,

T = TT ,

and P × E and all coupling terms in the balance equations may be neglected. Con-
sequently, the degree of polarization of each region of an electrochemical system is
completely determined by an isotropic function of type P = ??o?1??. Thus, thanks
to the great excess of solvent mass in relation to the masses of other constituents,
the dielectric properties of each region of an electrochemical system are almost ex-
clusively due to the solvent (water).

If the constitutive functions considered in (5.1.2) are introduced into inequality (5.1.3), and
all differentiations are carried out according to the chain rule, the inequality (5.1.3) can be

where A (y) and B (y) respectively are vector and scalar functions of y, and Z is a consti-
tutive variable not listed in (5.1.1). Since the inequality above is linear in

it must hold for arbitrary values of y and Z. The necessary and sufficient condition for this
is

A (y) = 0 , B (y) ? 0 . (5.1.7)

In other terms, (5.1.7) indicates that the coefficients of Z must vanish, otherwise inequality
(5.1.5) could be violated. These arguments lead to the following Liu identities

In obtaining the Equations (5.1.9)1,3, the theorem of Cartesian decomposition of
tensors was employed to impose that only the symmetric parts of ?(??) and ?(??) need
to vanish. Furthermore, in view of the constitutive assumptions previously established, one
shows by cross differentiation of identity (5.1.8) that ? = ?? (?,?a,?), ? = ?? (?,?a,?), ?? =
??? (?,?a,?), and ??a = ???a (?,?a,?,?). From Liu identity (5.1.8) and ? = ???? + ?? ·P/?,
one also demonstrates that the thermodynamic relation

d? =
p

?2
d? +

n?1?
a=1

µad?a ??d? + P ·d
(
??

)
(5.1.11)

holds at every point of the bulk, whether at equilibrium or not. Moreover, from identity
(5.1.8) and relation (5.1.11), one obtains the integrability conditions,

? (p/?2)

as well as the reduced dependence ? = ?? (?,?a,?,??), where P is a function of ?? only.
Using the definitions of Lagrange multipliers ?v and ?G, the extra entropy flux

? = ? ?

where the definition of ??a was employed. However, as the reduced dependence of ??a

64



reflects on µa, one has µa = µ?a (?,?a,?,?), and from Equation (5.1.13), it follows that
sym (??/???) = 0, ??/??b = 0, sym (??/???) = 0, and ??/?D = 0, though ??/?? is
not a null vector. Then, if one imposes that the extra entropy flux is an isotropic vector, ?
is null because there are no scalar generators for an isotropic vector function [70, 71, 72].

Consequently, Equation (5.1.13)4 becomes i = ?
n?1?
a=1

(?µa/??) ja. Applying the electrody-

namic potential definition, the latter can be simplified to the following expression i =
n?1?
a=1

ia,

which implies that the total current in the bulk is given by the algebraic sum of all flows of
charge carrier constituents, also known as faradaic currents.

Recalling ? = 0, the definition of the mass Lagrange multiplier, and ?µa =

(?µa/??)?? + (?µa/??)??, the entropy flux takes the form ? = ??h +
n?1?
a=1

??aja, and

inequality (5.1.10) is rewritten as

? = ?
??
?
· h ?

n?1?
a=1

ja ·?µa + T ·D + p1 ·D ? 0 . (5.1.14)

The left-hand side of expression (5.1.14) is the residual entropy production, a non-negative
quantity for arbitrary values of {?,?a,?µa,?,??,?,D} . Whenever ? takes the zero value,
there is no entropy production, and one says that the point (x, t) is at a thermodynamic
equilibrium state. Necessary conditions for ? = 0 at (x, t) are(

(
?2?

?yB?yB

)????
E

? 0 , (5.1.15)

where yB ?{??,?µa,D}, and the index E stands for the equilibrium state. Expressly, the
heat conduction, the mass transport, and the deformations that occur in the electrolyte
bulk are mechanisms that contribute to the production of residual entropy density.

In exploiting the first-order derivatives of ? with relation to yB, constraints are
imposed on the constitutive quantities. Thus, immediate consequences of (5.1.15)1 are(

Restrictions on constitutive functions also come from the second-order derivatives
of ? with relation to yB. Supposing an isotropic Newtonian fluid and following the theorem
of representation of isotropic functions [70, 71, 72], one writes in component form

Tij = ?p?ij +

where all phenomenological coefficients are material functions PB of type

PB = P?B (?,?a,?,?,?? ·??, trD) . (5.1.20)

Here, one points out that the definition of diffusive flux employed in continuum thermody-
namics does not correspond to that of the classical electrochemistry literature [3, 4, 25]
presented in the beginnings of this chapter. In continuum thermodynamics, the diffusive
motion is the relative motion of the particles of constituents in relation to the barycentric
motion and it is not exclusively due to the concentration gradient, unlike that found by the
classical electrochemistry approach. In fact, only if ?µa = (?µa/??a)??a and jai = Ca1µa,i,
the physical meanings of the diffusive flux in the classical electrochemistry and continuum
thermodynamics approaches would be the same.

Then, considering (5.1.19), the residual entropy inequality becomes

and k2 are phenomenological coefficients related to thermophoresis, and ? and ? + 2/3?
are the shear and bulk viscosities, respectively. Physically, the inequalities above evidence
that the heat flux vector opposes the temperature gradient (Fourier’s law) as well as the
diffusive flux vector being opposed to the gradient of electrodynamic potential. Moreover,
the transport of matter through bulk is also caused by the coupling of heat and mass flows,
and the particles of the electrolyte bulk flow in the direction of the shearing forces.

5.1.2 Double-layer region

It has been long recognized that the introduction of an electrode under potential control
into an electrolyte solution disrupts the bulk solution structure, modifying the interactions
that occur between the ions/molecules in solution and the electrode surface. As a result,
different physical and chemical phenomena arise in the electrochemical system, and a
new constitutive class should be formulated.

In the double layer, one is interested in determining the same basic fields ac-
counted for in the bulk region, but, unlike there, one assumes that the double layer is a
viscous heat and electric conducting mixture with chemical reactions and mass transport
caused by sources different than those in the bulk. Thus, the constitutive response of
double layer depends on

w ?{?,??,?,??,?a,??b,?,??, v,?v} (?a,b = 1, ...,n? 1) . (5.1.23)

where C ? {ja,ca,T ,?, h, P, i,?, ?}.
Principles of constitutive theory require that all variables listed in (5.1.23) are ob-

jective scalars, vectors, and tensors. In addition, all constitutive equations must obey the
principle of material objectivity. Then, C does not depend explicitly on v, and it depends
on ?v only through its symmetric part D, that is,

67



w ?{?,??,?,??,?a,??b,?,??,D} (?a,b = 1, ...,n? 1) . (5.1.24)

According to the method of Lagrange multipliers for exploitation of entropy inequal-
ity [33], there exist Lagrange multipliers ??, ??a , ?v, ??, and ?G that, whenever multiplied
by their corresponding balance laws, they produce an inequality

? =?

which is valid for any solution {? (x, t) ,?a (x, t) ,? (x, t) ,? (x, t) , v (x, t)} of field equations.
After introducing constitutive equations into inequality (5.1.25) and all differentiations are
performed according to the chain rule, the entropy inequality becomes

Analogously to inequality (5.1.5), inequality (5.1.26) can be expressed as

Further conclusions can be drawn from the Liu identities above. Since P is a func-
tion of ?? and ?? depends exclusively on ?, by the cross differentiation of identity (5.1.28),
one proves that ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ?? = ??? (?,?,?a), ??a = ???a (?,?,?a,?), and

? (p/?2)

??

??

??
,

? (p/?2)

??a

,
?µa
??

??a
, (5.1.31)

where (5.1.31) is the integrability condition for the thermodynamic potential ? = ?? ?? +
P/? ·??. Thus, one has the thermodynamic relation

d? =

?2
d? +

n?1?
a=1

µad?a ??d? + P ·d
(
??
?

)
, (5.1.32)

whence ? = ?? (?,?,?a,??).
In turn, from Liu identity (5.1.29), one introduces the extra entropy flux ? = ? ?

n?1?
a=1

??aja ? ??h, where ?v = 0 and ?G = 0 were used. Substituting the expression for the

extra entropy flux into identity (5.1.29) and making use of definition of ??a , it follows that

Moreover, as µa should present the same reduced dependence of ??a , one has from iden-
tity (5.1.33) that sym (??/???) = 0, sym (??/???b) = 0, sym (??/???) = 0, ??/??? =
0, and ??/?D = 0. Consequently, ? = 0, and then the entropy flux can be rewritten as

? = ??h +
n?1?
a=1

??aja or ? = ??h ? ??
n?1?
a=1

µaja. Here, it is worth remembering that, unlike

the total current in the bulk region, i is not exclusively given by partial faradaic currents.
In fact, the total current in the double layer is due to the non-faradaic currents associated
with the charging of the electrical double layer at the electrode-solution interface, and the
faradaic currents corresponding to the reduction or oxidation of some chemical substance.

In view of the above restrictions, one uses ?µa = (?µa/??)??+

(?µa/??)?? + (?µa/??)?? and

(5.1.34)

Inequality (5.1.34) evidences that some phenomena in an electrochemical system, e.g.
electrophoresis, electrodic reactions and Joule’s effect, take place only in the double layer.
Moreover, observe that the gradient of electrodynamic potential is given in terms of ??,
??a, ??, and ??, unlike the bulk. As a consequence, the thermodynamic equilibrium
state at the point (x, t) in the double layer requires a more complex set of conditions than
in the bulk.

In fact, one has the same necessary conditions to ensure ? = 0 at any (x, t) in
the double layer,

whence one concludes that, at the local thermodynamic equilibrium state, the mass flux,
the heat flux and the electric current flux vanish, the reactions are at chemical equilibrium,
and the stress tensor is given by the hydrostatic pressure.

In order to evaluate further constraints on the constitutive quantities listed in (5.1.24),
some restrictions are imposed on the forms of the constitutive relations. If the gradients of
temperature, electrodynamic potential and electric potential and the strains are not very
large, constitutive equations with only first-order terms are suitable for treatment of con-
stitutive responses of the double layer. However, once more, linear constitutive functions
for chemical affinity are only suitable close to chemical equilibrium, otherwise fr presents
a highly non-linear relation to the rate of conversion ?r. In view of these arguments, the
constitutive relation for the chemical affinity of a reaction r is not discussed again.

Under these conditions, one considers the symmetry group M1? (V ), which char-
acterizes transversely isotropic material bodies and next uses the theorem of representa-

and the scalar product n · n has been eliminated because it is equal to a unity. More-
over, observe that the same phenomenological coefficients may be numerically different
in the bulk and double layer (compare Equations (5.1.20) and (5.1.41)) since they are
not constants that depend only on the chemical species or medium under question, but
constitutive functions that suffer the influence of temperature, electric potential, viscosity
among others. Finally, note that the current in the double layer region cannot be split up
into the migrational and diffusive components as usual because the physical meaning of
diffusive and migrational fluxes given in the electrochemistry literature does not coincide
with those of continuum thermodynamics.

The phenomenological equations proposed in (5.1.40) incorporate many cross
phenomena that are impossible to occur in the bulk region, such as thermoelectric and
electrophoretic effects, and thermal diffusion. These effects are due to the coupling of
fields, which interfere in a reciprocal way in the heat, mass and electric current flows.
For example, Ca2 6= 0 and ?3 6= 0, both constrained by the condition (5.1.43)9, evidence
that the gradient of electric potential opposes the electrodynamic potential gradients of
all ions. This thermodynamic condition recalls an important non-equilibrium phenomenon
observed in electrolyte solutions: the development of a diffusion potential. Whenever an
electrolyte is brought into contact with water, a gradient of electrodynamic potential arises
for both the positive and negative ions and, therefore, they start flowing away. Then, be-
cause of the difference of ionic mobilities, there appears to be a tendency for segregation
of cations and anions, so that a gradient of electric potential develops across the interface
that marks the local separation of ions. It is precisely this gradient of electric potential that
inhibits the charge segregation as the accelerated cations face resistance to their motion,
whereas the slower anions are pushed up by the gradient of electric potential. Similar con-
clusions can be obtained for the remaining phenomenological coefficients, where Ca1 6= 0
and k1 6= 0 are related to the thermal diffusion, Ca2 6= 0 and k2 6= 0 to the thermoelectric
phenomenon, and Ca3 6= 0 and k3 6= 0 to the electrophoretic effects.

Although the constitutive nature of the chemical affinity will not be discussed be-
cause of the reasons already presented, one can obtain the spontaneity criterion for elec-
trodic reactions from inequality (5.1.34), as in the expression (4.2.31).

6 Final remarks

A continuum model for electrochemical systems was developed with basis in the principles
of constitutive theory and the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle. The mathematical formulation of
the thermodynamics of electrochemical systems was based on the balance laws of polar
continuum mixtures and the Maxwell’s laws under the quasi-electrostatic approximation.
Some phenomena, such as diffusion, conduction of heat and electricity, deformation, po-
larization, and chemical reactions, including their coupling effects, were emphasized dur-
ing the constitutive modeling. In particular, a thermodynamic model for a dilute electrolyte
solution was introduced. It was shown that contrary to the Debye-Hu?ckel model, where
ions are regarded as non-polarizable hard spheres and deviations from ideality are exclu-
sively due to the ion-ion interactions, the constitutive model here formulated can properly
take into account the effect of electrostriction, the coupling effect in the electrodiffusion
processes, and the ion-solvent interactions.

Constitutive models were also proposed for the bulk and double layer regions of
an electrochemical system. While the material response of both regions was considered
in the simplest way because the intensities of thermo-electromechanical fields are not so
strong, the bulk and double layer were modeled as isotropic and anisotropic media, re-
spectively. In considering the transport phenomena in each region, it was demonstrated
that the concepts of diffusion and conduction flows in the classical electrochemistry litera-
ture do not coincide with those of modern continuum thermodynamics. In fact, according
to continuum thermodynamics approach, one finds that diffusive fluxes are not directly
related to the concentration gradients, but rather they are associated to the motion of a
constituent a relative to the barycentric motion. Moreover, comparison of residual entropy
productions of the bulk and double layer regions showed that some processes occur only
in the double layer, thus resulting in stricter conditions for the local thermodynamic equi-
librium.

In addition, the results presented in this work offered the possibility of discussing
certain fundamental concepts of modern continuum thermodynamics, in special, contin-
uum mixtures theories. The concept of a continuum particle was clearly differentiated
from the classical particles, such as ions, atoms, molecules etc. Basic equations were

77



still modified in order to account properly for interactions among constituents particles,
and physical quantities were analyzed in view of the characteristics of electrochemical
systems. Then, the Kelvin polarization force was assumed to represent ion-solvent inter-
actions, ion-ion interactions were given by coulombic forces, and P×E was related to the
torques that electric dipoles of water molecules suffer due to the action of the electric field.
As a consequence of these intermolecular phenomena, the stress tensor is not symmetric,
affecting linear and angular momenta conservation.

A few comments were indeed addressed to the physical meaning of the Lagrange
multipliers, especially to the energy Lagrange multiplier. Even though, many thermody-
namicists claim that in a good application of the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, the consti-
tutive dependence of any Lagrange multiplier must be reached as a final result of the
entropy inequality, in this work coldness was assumed to be a universal function. While
this hypothesis is subject to criticism, by now, it seems quite hard to provide a constitutive
model for continuum mixtures without accepting that ?? = 1/? as the problem of non-ideal
material surfaces in continuum mixtures does not have a solution yet. Thus, the reliability
of the constitutive model provided here deserves to be investigated as well as whether the
definition ?? = 1/? is appropriate for non-equilibrium systems.

Therefore, with the results obtained in this work, one intends that the Mu?ller-Liu
entropy principle is not viewed as a mathematical method whence one obtains thermody-
namic relations without inquiring whether the results make physical sense or not. On the
condition that concepts of modern continuum thermodynamics are correctly applied, and a
proper formulation for the second law is employed, one can obtain a more comprehensive
thermodynamic theory for non-equilibrium systems without using the Onsager reciprocal
relations.

7 Appendix I

Let U and V be two vector spaces with inner product. A mapping

L(U,V ) = {T : U ? V}

is called a linear transformation T , if for any u, y ? U, and a ? R,

T (u + ay) = T (u) + aT (y) .

If the mapping L(U,V ) is specified by

L(V,V ) = {T : V ? V} ,

where L(V,V ) = L(V ) = V ?V , then the linear transformations T in L(V ) are second-
order tensors.

Hence, Q?L(V ) is an orthogonal transformation, if the inner product of V for all
vectors u, y ? V is preserved:

Qu ·Qy = u · y .

If Q is an orthogonal transformation, thus

1. QT = Q?1,

2. detQ = ±1,

3. |Qv| = |v|,

4. ` (Qv,Qu) = ` (v, u) ? [0, 90o],

and it forms an orthogonal group O (V ). Furthermore, if detQ = 1, so the orthogonal group
is a proper orthogonal group or a rotation group O+ (V ) because its elements represent
rotations.

Now, let a linear transformation T ?L(V ) be, such that

1. |detT | = 1,

79



2. detT = 1.

The set of linear transformations T , which satisfies the first condition above, forms the
unimodular group U (V ) of the vector space, whereas the set of linear transformations T ,
which satisfies the second condition, constitutes the special linear group SL(V ) . Evi-
dently, O (V ) ?U (V ) and O+ (V ) ?SL(V ).

8 Appendix II

Let an arbitrary tensor O = A + B, such that A ? SYM(V ) and B ? SKW (V ). The
cross product of a vector y ? V with A [6, 29] is defined as

y ×A = eijkyiA(jl)ck ? cl ,

whereas y ×B is given by

y ×B = eijkyiB[jl]ck ? cl ,

where ?ijk = eijk is the permutation symbol when the basis ci is orthonormal.
Now, let the divergent of y ×A, which is defined in component form as

div (y ×A) =
(
eijkyiA(jl)

)
,l

=eijkyiA(jl),l + eijkyi,lA(jl) .

Since one has yi,l = ?il, it follows that

div (y ×A) =eijkAji + eijkyiA(jl),l ,

which is reduced to

div (y ×A) =y × div (A)

=eijkyiA(jl),l ,

because eijkAji = 0.
In addition, the divergent of y ×B is also defined in component form as

81



div (y ×B) =
(
eijkyiB[jl]

)
,l

=eijkyiB[jl],l + eijkyi,lB[jl] .

But, if the identity yi,l = ?il is used, the vector identity above reduces to

div (y ×B) =y × div (B) + 2b?

=eijkyiB[jl],l + eijkB[ji] ,

where b?k = 1/2eijkB[ji] is the dual or axial vector associated with the skew-symmetric tensor
B.
