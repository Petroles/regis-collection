Resumo 
 
 

O interesse crescente das membranas inorgânicas deve-se à potencial 
aplicação em novas áreas de investigação e da indústria, e em alternativa a 
operações mais convencionais. Em particular, as membranas de 
titanossilicatos oferecem vantagens importantes sobre as de zeólitos, pois 
podem ser sintetizadas sem agentes estruturantes orgânicos, para evitar a 
calcinação subsequente usualmente responsável por defeitos irreversíveis, 
exibem novas possibilidades de substituição isomórfica da matriz, permitindo 
um ajuste mais fino das propriedades catalíticas e de adsorção, e são capazes 
de separar misturas com base em diferenças de afinidade e tamanho 
molecular (efeito de peneiro). 

     Os objectivos principais deste trabalho foram: i) a caracterização dinâmica 
de membranas do tipo zeolítico sintetizadas no Laboratório Associado 
CICECO, realizando-se experiências de permeação com gases puros e 
misturas; ii) o desenvolvimento e validação de novos modelos para a 
transferência de massa multicomponente através de membranas porosas pela 
abordagem de Maxwell-Stefan, tendo em conta os mecanismos específicos 
encontrados, particularmente a contribuição por difusão superficial; e iii) a 
modelação dos pontos experimentais medidos, bem como dados compilados 
da literatura.  

     De forma a realizar os ensaios de permeação, desenhou-se, montou-se e 
testou-se uma instalação experimental. Para gases puros, os objectivos 
principais foram a medição de permeâncias a temperatura constante, por 
variação da pressão transmembranar ( P? ), e de permeâncias a temperatura 
programada, conduzidas a P?  constante. Seguidamente, calcularam-se as 
selectividades ideais. Em relação a misturas, a determinação de selectividades 
reais requer as fracções molares no permeado e no retido. Na globalidade, 
estudaram-se três suportes diferentes (aço inoxidável e ?? alumina) e 
dezanove membranas de AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5 e zeólito 4A, utilizando-se H2, 
He, N2, CO2, e O2. A primeira avaliação exploratória da qualidade das 
membranas foi feita permeando azoto à temperatura ambiente. Assim, 
permeâncias superiores a 610 ?  mol/m2s.Pa evidenciavam defeitos grosseiros, 
levando-nos a efectuar cristalizações adicionais sobre as primeiras camadas. 
Este procedimento foi implementado com oito membranas. Um trabalho 
experimental mais detalhado foi conduzido com cinco membranas.  

 



      Membranas com curvas permeância-temperatura ( T? ? ) decrescentes 
indicam tipicamente transporte viscoso e de Knudsen, i.e. meso e 
macrodefeitos. Por exemplo, a membrana nº 3 de AM-3 exibiu este 
comportamento com H2, He, N2 e CO2 puros. A contribuição de Knudsen foi 
confirmada pela relação linear encontrada entre as permeâncias e o inverso da 
raiz quadrada da massa molar. O mecanismo viscoso foi também identificado, 
pois as permeâncias eram inversamente proporcionais à viscosidade do gás 
ou, atendendo a equações do tipo de Chapman-Enskog, directamente 
proporcionais a 5.02

k Md  (onde kd  é o diâmetro cinético e M  a massa molar). 

     Um comportamento de permeação distinto observou-se com a membrana 
nº 5 de AM-3. As permeâncias registadas a temperatura programada eram 
aproximadamente constantes para o N2, CO2 e O2, enquanto com o H2 
cresciam significativamente. Conjuntamente elas evidenciam a ocorrência de 
macro, meso e microdefeitos intercristalinos. O transporte gasoso activado 
através dos microporos compensa o impacto diminuidor dos meso e 
macroporos. Ao contrário do N2, CO2 e O2, o pequeno diâmetro do hidrogénio 
torna-lhe possível permear através dos microporos intracristalinos, o que lhe 
adiciona um mecanismo de transferência responsável por esse crescimento.  

     No que respeita à difusão superficial, o sistema CO2/ZSM-5 pode ser 
tomado como um exemplo paradigmático. Uma vez que este zeólito adsorve o 
CO2, as permeâncias diminuem com o crescimento de P? , em virtude de as 
concentrações no sólido aumentarem de forma não linear e tenderem para a 
saturação. Os resultados contrastantes obtidos com azoto realçam ainda mais 
o mecanismo superficial, pois o N2 não é adsorvido e as permeâncias medidas 
são constantes. 

     Globalmente, as selectividades ideais calculadas ( *? ) variam de cerca de 1 
a 4.2. Este parâmetro foi também utilizado para discriminar as melhores 
membranas, uma vez que baixos valores de *?  denotam o escoamento 
viscoso não-selectivo típico de macrodefeitos. Por exemplo, o H2/CO2 na 
membrana nº 3 de AM-3 apresentou 2.46.3* ?=?  para 40–120ºC, enquanto 
que na membrana nº 5 de AM-3 originou 1.36.2* ?=? . Estes resultados 
corroboraram as observações anteriores, segundo as quais a membrana nº 5 
era melhor do que a nº 3. Alguns ensaios foram realizados com membranas 
saturadas com água para aumentar a selectividade: as medições mostraram 
claramente uma melhoria inicial seguida de uma redução consistente de 

*?  
com o aumento da temperatura, devido à remoção das moléculas de água 
responsáveis pela obstrução de alguns poros. Em relação às selectividades 
reais de misturas contendo hidrogénio, devem ser realizadas mais 
experiências e a quantificação do hidrogénio deve ser melhorada.  

     No que concerne à modelação, novos factores termodinâmicos de Maxwell-
Stefan foram derivados para as isotérmicas mono e multicomponente de Nitta, 
Langmuir-Freundlich e Toth, tendo sido testadas com dados de equilíbrio e de 
permeação da literatura. (É importante realçar que só estão publicadas 
equações para Langmuir e Dual-Site Langmuir de componentes puros e 
misturas). O procedimento de validação adoptado foi exigente: i) as 
isotérmicas multicomponente foram previstas a partir das de gás puro; ii) os 
parâmetros de difusão dos componentes puros foram ajustados a dados de 
permeação de cada gás; iii) depois, as difusividades cruzadas de Maxwell-
Stefan foram estimadas pela relação de Vignes; finalmente, v) as novas 
equações foram testadas usando-se estes parâmetros, tendo sido capazes de 
estimar com sucesso fluxos binários.  

     Paralelamente ao enfoque principal do trabalho, derivou-se um novo 
modelo para permuta iónica em materiais microporosos baseado nas 
equações de Maxwell-Stefan. Este foi validado com dados experimentais de 
remoção de Hg2+ e Cd2+ de soluções aquosas usando ETS-4. A sua 
capacidade preditiva foi também avaliada, sendo possível concluir que se 
comporta muito bem. Com efeito, conseguiram-se boas previsões com 
parâmetros optimizados a partir de conjuntos de dados independentes. Este 
comportamento pode ser atribuído aos princípios físicos sólidos da teoria de 
Maxwell-Stefan.

Abstract 

 

The growing interest on inorganic membrane applications is due to their 
potential in new industrial and research fields, and as alternative processes to 
more conventional operations. In particular, titanosilicate membranes offer 
important benefits over the classical zeolite ones, since they may be 
synthesised without organic templates, to avoid the subsequent calcination 
usually responsible for irreversible defects, exhibit novel possibilities of 
isomorphous framework substitution, allowing for fine-tuning catalytic and 
adsorption properties, and are able to separate mixtures based on differences 
in affinity and sieving effect.  

     The main objectives of this work were: i) the dynamic characterization of the 
zeolite type membranes synthesised in our Associated Laboratory CICECO, by 
carrying out permeation experiments with pure gases and mixtures; ii) the 
development and validation of new models for the multicomponent mass 
transport across porous membranes by Maxwell-Stefan approach, taking into 
account the specific mechanisms found, particularly the surface diffusion 
contribution; and iii) modelling the experimental points measured, as well as 
data compiled from literature. 

     In order to carry out the permeation essays, an experimental set-up has 
been designed, assembled, and tested. For pure gases, the main targets were 
the measurement of permeances at constant temperature, by varying the 
transmembrane pressure drop ( P? ), and permeances at programmed 
temperature, by fixing P? . After that, the ideal selectivites were computed. With 
respect to mixtures, the determination of the real selectivities demanded the 
mole fractions in permeate and retentate. In the whole, three distinct supports 
(stainless-steel and ?-alumina) and nineteen membranes of AM-3, ETS-10, 
ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A have been studied, employing H2, He, N2, CO2, and O2. 
The first exploratory evaluation of membrane quality was accomplished by 
permeating nitrogen at room temperature. Accordingly, permeances higher 
than 610 ?  mol/m2s.Pa pointed out rough defects, inducing us to perform 
additional crystallizations over the first layers. This procedure has been 
implemented with eight membranes. The more detailed experimental 
programme was carried out with five membranes. 

      



      Membranes with decreasing permeance-temperature ( T? ? ) curves 
indicate typically transport by Knudsen and viscous flows, i.e. meso and 
macrodefects. For instance, the AM-3 membrane number 3 exhibited such 
behaviour with pure H2, He, N2, and CO2. The Knudsen contribution was 
confirmed by the linear trend found between permeances and the inverse of the 
square root of the molecular weights. The viscous mechanism was also 
identified, since permeances were inversely proportional to gas viscosity or, 
attending to Chapman-Enskog based equations, directly proportional to 

5.02
k Md (where kd  is the kinetic diameter and M  the molecular weight).      

     A dissimilar permeation behaviour observed in this work involved AM-3 
membrane number 5. The registered permeances at programmed temperature 
were approximately constant for N2, CO2 and O2, while for H2 increases 
significantly. In conjunction they evidence the simultaneous incidence of macro, 
meso and intercrystalline microdefects. The activated gaseous transport across 
micropores compensates the lowering impact of meso and macropores. In 
contrast to N2, CO2 and O2, the small hydrogen diameter makes it possible to 
permeate through the intracrystalline micropores, which superimposes an 
additional transfer mechanism responsible for such increasing.  

     With respect to surface diffusion, the CO2/ZSM-5 system may be taken as a 
paradigmatic example. Once this zeolite adsorbs CO2 the permeances 
decrease with increasing P? , because the surface loading concentrations 
increase non-linearly tending to the saturation. The contrasting results obtained 
for nitrogen emphasizes even more this mechanism, since N2 does not adsorb 
and exhibited constant permeances.  

     Globally, the calculated ideal selectivites ( *? ) ranged from ca. 1 to 4.2. This 
parameter was also utilized to discriminate the best membranes, since low 
values denote the non-selective viscous flow typical of macrodefects. For 
instance, H2/CO2 in AM-3 membrane No 3 presented 2.46.3* ?=?  for 40–
120ºC, while in AM-3 No 5 originated 1.36.2* ?=? . These results corroborated 
previous findings that AM-3-5 is better than AM-3-3. Some essays were carried 
out with membranes saturated with water to increase selectivity: the 
measurements clearly showed an initial enhancement followed by a consistent 
reduction with rising temperature, due to the removal of the water molecules 
responsible for the blockage of some pores. With respect to real selectivities of 
hydrogen-containing mixtures, more experiments must be performed, and the 
analytical quantification of hydrogen should be improved.  

     Concerning modelling, new expressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic 
factors were derived for pure and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, 
and Toth isotherms, being tested with equilibrium and permeation data from 
literature. (It is worth noting that only pure and binary classical and dual site 
Langmuir equations are available). The validation procedure adopted was very 
stringent: i) the multicomponent isotherms were predicted from pure gas data; 
ii) the diffusion parameters of pure components were fitted to single permeation 
data; iii) then, the Maxwell-Stefan crossed diffusivities were estimated by the 
Vignes relation; finally, iv) the new equations were tested using these 
parameters, and were able to estimate successfully binary fluxes.  

     In parallel to the main focus of gas permeation, a new Maxwell-Stefan 
based model has been also derived for ion-exchange in microporous materials. 
The model was validated with data for Hg2+ and Cd2+ removal from aqueous 
solution using ETS-4. Its predicting ability has been also analyzed, being 
possible to conclude it performs very successfully. In effect, good predictions 
were accomplished with parameters optimized from independent sets of data. 
Such performance may be attributed to the sound physical principles of 
Maxwell-Stefan theory.

I. Introduction  
 

Nowadays, membrane technology is applied in a variety of industries offering a number of 

important benefits over classical separation processes. For instance, membrane processes 

for gas separation play an increasingly role in reducing the environmental impact and 

energy costs of industrial processes. Moreover, membrane units require a small layout, 

comprising also a low mechanical complexity. 

New application fields have high demands and expectations regarding the thermal 

and chemical stability of membranes. The polymeric ones are the most widely used due to 

their relatively low manufacturing cost, but stability could limit their applications under 

harsh environment. Proper inorganic membranes may be robust under such conditions, 

which allied to high selectivities make them promising alternatives to more conventional 

and/or inefficient processes. 

The synthesis of inorganic membranes is an important research area of the 

Associated Laboratory CICECO (University of Aveiro). For instance, new microporous 

titanosilicates, such as AM-n materials, have been firstly synthesized by CICECO teams. 

Similarly to zeolites, titanosilicates exhibit a well-defined three-dimensional crystalline 

structure with molecular dimensions, being able to separate mixtures based on differences 

in affinity and sieving effect. Furthermore, titanosilicate membranes offer important 

benefits over the classical zeolite ones, including the possibility of synthesis without 

organic templates, which avoids subsequent calcination treatments responsible for 

irreversible defects, and exhibit novel possibilities of isomorphous framework substitution, 

allowing for fine-tuning catalytic and adsorption properties. 



Introduction 

 2 

The performance of a given membrane is primarily associated with its selectivity and 

permeance. In order to obtain a high selective membrane, the separation layer crystals must 

form a continuous thin film, where the intra-crystalline pores are the unique available 

pathways for gas permeation. The synthesis procedure of inorganic membranes is based on 

a cyclic trial and error approach: membranes are prepared and characterized; then, 

preparation conditions are continuously optimised until a good quality membrane is 

obtained. With this information, the ideal preparation conditions to promote an efficient 

intergrowth between crystals may be reached. CICECO owns the relevant equipment to 

carry out a detailed structural and morphological characterization. Beyond this 

characterization, the study of their permeation properties is indispensable. Membrane 

quality should be assessed by measuring permeances of individual gases as well as mixture 

separation factors. Accordingly, this work is focused on the dynamic characterization by 

permeability tests of microporous titanosilicate membranes synthesized by CICECO, in 

order to optimize their synthesis conditions. 

Modelling is fundamental to interpret experimental data, predict the dynamic 

behaviour of any process, optimize its operating conditions, and scale up from laboratory 

to commercial size. Prediction of the separation performance of a given membrane requires 

the knowledge of multicomponent diffusion, adsorption, and structure parameters, which 

may be determined by experimental methods combined with adequate modelling of 

equilibrium and transport phenomena. The Maxwell-Stefan formalism is the most 

advisable and physically sound approach to describe multicomponent diffusion. It is 

exceptionally versatile, being successfully applied in this work to describe permeation as 

well as ion exchange through molecular sieves.   

In the following, the structure of the present thesis will be summarily described. This 

document is divided into eight chapters. In Chapter II, the main fundaments of membrane 

technology are briefly boarder. Firstly, an overview of the main membrane processes, 

advantages and applications are presented; afterward, a more detailed discussion around 

inorganic membranes is provided, detaching microporous zeolite and titanosilicate 

membranes. Finally, some membrane structural and dynamic characterization methods are 

described. This chapter aims a simple elucidation of the main topics covered throughout 

the present work.  



Introduction 

 3 

Chapter III describes mass transport phenomena occurring in microporous 

membranes. The transport mechanisms for single gases in porous media are firstly 

explained and the corresponding equations presented; subsequently, multicomponent mass 

transport relations are derived based on the Maxwell-Stefan equations and on Irreversible 

Thermodynamics theory. This chapter is fundamental for the interpretation of the 

experimental data obtained in this work and compiled from literature, whose results are 

discussed in Chapter VI.  

Chapter IV focuses the modelling of ion exchange with microporous titanosilicates 

based on the Maxwell-Stefan equations. Initially, a brief description of the more classical 

kinetic models and Nernst-Planck equations is presented. Finally, a detailed model based 

on the Maxwell-Stefan equations is derived to describe batch ion exchange process using 

microporous materials. The model is validated using data for metal ions removal from 

aqueous solution using a microporous titanosilicate.  

Chapter V is the experimental section, where the set-up and all procedures adopted 

for the dynamic characterization of membranes are described in detail.  

In Chapter VI, modelling and experimental data are presented and discussed. New 

expressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic factors are derived for pure and 

multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms, being tested with 

equilibrium and permeation data from literature. The permeation measurements in AM-3, 

ETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A membranes, at fixed and programmed temperatures, are 

also given. Data are modelled based on the gas transport mechanisms described in Chapter 

III.  

The major conclusions of this thesis are pointed out in Chapter VII, along with some 

suggestions for future work.

II. Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 
 

1. Introduction 

Membrane technology is becoming a very promising field of separation processes. In 

recent years the development of this technology has being expanding and the number of 

potential applications growing rapidly, mainly owing to the availability of microporous 

membranes. 

A membrane is a semipermeable barrier separating two phases, where mass transfer 

occurs under the action of a driving force (Mulder, 1997; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). In 

membrane processes, a feed mixture is separated into two streams: permeate (which 

permeates the membrane) and retentate (which does not diffuse through membrane). 

Separation takes place owing to the membrane ability to transport one component from the 

feed mixture more readily than the others, due to differences in size, shape or affinity 

(Mulder, 1997).  

Several membrane processes may be distinguished essentially by the driving force 

responsible for permeation (i.e. gradients in pressure, concentration, temperature or 

electrical potential), the physical state of streams, and membrane type. Accordingly, one 

may distinguish microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, gas 

permeation, pervaporation, dialysis, electrodialysis, membrane electrolysis, thermal-

osmosis, and membrane distillation. It is well known that the actual driving force for 

transmembrane transport arises from a gradient in chemical potential (electrical potential 

included), as will be explained in Chapter III. A detailed description of distinct membrane

processes may be found in fundamental texts (Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989; Ho and 

Sirkar, 1992; Mulder, 1997). 

Membrane technology offers a number of important benefits over classical 

separation processes (Mulder, 1997; Koros, 2004; Rand and Dell, 2008). For instance, (i) 

separation can be carried out continuously; (ii) the energy consumption is generally low, a 

highly required quality when presently energy conservation is one of the most important 

priorities for the industry, reducing the environmental impact and energy costs of industrial 

processes – the energy required in some large-scale separations can be one order of 

magnitude lower when membranes are used instead of traditional thermal separations; (iii) 

membranes can be easily combined with other separation processes, giving rise to hybrid 

processes; (iv) separation can be carried out under mild conditions; (v) up-scaling is easy 

and membrane units require a small layout, which makes them attractive for isolated 

applications such as offshore gas-processing platforms; and (vi) membrane properties are 

variable and can be adjusted to the specific requirements of each process. Despite such 

benefits, membrane technology is still under development holding a number of drawbacks, 

such as (i) the possibility of concentration polarization and membrane fouling, which 

reduces the permeation fluxes and change the selectivity of the process, giving rise to a 

frequent need of cleaning; (ii) low lifetime and selectivity; (iii) the up-scaling factor is 

more or less linear; and (iv) the operating temperature and pH conditions may affect the 

membrane structure and must be taken into account. 

Nowadays, membranes are applied in a variety of industries to recover valuable 

products or to reduce unwanted chemicals from exhaust streams. For instance, they may be 

found in petrochemical, food processing, metallurgy, pulp and paper, textile, 

pharmaceutical, automotive, dairy, and biotechnology industry (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; 

Mulder, 1997). Moreover, membrane technology is becoming increasingly important also 

in water treatment for domestic and industrial water supply (Mulder, 1997). In seawater 

desalination, membranes operations are an effective approach for solving the freshwater 

requirements in many regions of the world, at lower costs and minimum environmental 

impact (Bernardo et al., 2009). In other applications, membranes have been combined and 

embodied with chemical or biochemical reactions, where they work as catalysts as well as 

selective barriers to remove one of the products, shifting the chemical equilibrium, or to 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes

selectively remove reaction inhibitors. Membranes can be used to enhance the conversion 

of de-hydrogenations, partial oxidations, isomerisations and esterifications (Caro and 

Noack, 2008), or to remove inhibitory compounds during fermentation processes  (Crespo 

and Carrondo, 1993). For instance, Akamatsu et al. (2009) obtained hydrogen with purity 

up to 99.9% by dehydrogenation of cyclohexane using a hydrogen-selective amorphous 

silica membrane. Caro et al. (2005) investigated the reaction of n-propanol with propionic 

acid using a ZSM-5 water-selective membrane, and obtained an enhancement from 52% to 

92% in the ester yield for infinite reaction time. Kita et al. (2007) found conversions of 

about 100% during esterification of lactic acid with ethanol using hydrophilic ZSM-5 and 

MOR membranes.  

Concerning gas separations, some relevant industrial applications are: (i) H2/N2 and 

H2/hydrocarbon separations in ammonia and petrochemical plants; (ii) separation of N2 

from air; (iii) CO2 and water removal from natural gas; (iv) removal of CO2 from process 

streams to prevent the “greenhouse effect”; (v) removal of volatile organic compounds 

from air or nitrogen streams; (vi) removal of H2S from natural gas, refinery gas, and coal 

gas streams for odor control; and (vii) separation of hydrocarbon isomers in the 

petrochemical industries (e.g., mixtures of alkanes). The oxygen enrichment of air for 

medical purposes is also an important example (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). 

The performance of a given membrane is primarily related with its nature, i.e., its 

material and structure. Membranes can be natural or synthetic; the last ones can be further 

subdivided into organic (polymeric) and inorganic (e.g., alumina, metal and zeolites) 

(Mulder, 1997; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Synthetic membranes may be also classified 

based on their morphology or structure. This is a very pertinent classification since these 

characteristics may determine its application. Accordingly, two classes of membranes are 

distinguished: dense (non-porous) and porous membranes. Following IUPAC 

classification, porous membranes are microporous ( 2p&amp;lt;d nm), mesoporous ( 502 p&amp;lt;&amp;lt;d

nm) or macroporous ( 50p &gt;d nm). Dense membranes are capable of separating molecules 

because of differences in solubility and/or diffusivity, where solubility plays a particularly 

significant role. Porous membranes induce separation by differences in size, shape, or 

affinity between permeating molecules and the material (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Mulder, 

1997). In fact, microporous membranes can discriminate molecules of similar diameters, 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes

polarities and/or molecular weight. In addition, their structures may be tuned in order to 

suit a particular separation. Accordingly, pore size and host-sorbate interactions can be 

adjusted by chemical modifications, such as ion exchange or changing the framework 

composition.  

Concerning its structure, inorganic membranes can be symmetric or asymmetric. 

Symmetric membranes (or isotropic) are composed by a single material with one chemical 

composition and one morphological structure. These structures are usually thick in order to 

obtain mechanical strength, which is a disadvantage for obtaining large fluxes. On the 

other hand, asymmetric membranes (or anisotropic) are composed by two or more 

structural planes with different morphology, consisting generally in a combination of a 

supporting system with large pores and layers with gradually decreasing pore size. In this 

way, thin films and consequently higher permeabilities may be obtained (Burggraaf and 

Cot, 1996; Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). A schematic representation of synthetic membranes 

structures is presented in Figure II.1. 

 

 

Figure II.1 – Schematic representation of synthetic membrane structures. 

 

Membrane systems (support and separation layer) are generally assembled into 

modules (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). Five module architectures can be distinguished, 

namely: tubular, capillary, hollow fibre, plate and frame and spiral-wound modules 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 9 

(Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989). The transport properties of membrane systems are also 

dependent on the architecture of the membrane modules (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996).  

The performance of a given membrane in gas separation is mostly characterized by 

two parameters: selectivity and permeability. The selectivity describes the capacity of a 

given membrane to separate the components of a mixture and quantifies the enrichment of 

the desired product relatively to the feed stream; the permeability is the rate at which the 

molecules permeate through a membrane and determines the membrane productivity. Both 

high selectivity and high permeability are required to obtain good quality and economically 

feasible membranes. Nonetheless, low permeability can be compensated to a certain extent 

by an increase in the membrane surface area. Low selectivity leads to multi-stage 

processes, which in most cases are not economically viable when compared with 

established conventional processes (Rautenbach and Albrecht, 1989). The permeation flux 

of a molecule i  through the membrane is given by the following relation: 

( ) ( )force drivingforce driving, ×?=×
?

P

where iMP ,  is the membrane permeability for species i , ?  is the membrane thickness, and 

??? iMi P ,  is the permeance. In the case of gases at low pressure, the partial pressure 

difference across membrane, ip? , provides the driving force in gas mixture permeation, 

i.e., ipifpifii yPxPppp ?=?=? ,, , where subscripts f  and p  stand for feed and permeate, 

respectively, P  is total pressure, and ix  and iy  are the molar fractions of component i  in 

the retentate and permeate streams. For non-ideal gases, fugacities should be used instead. 

Taking into account previous equations, one obtains:

(Mulder, 1997). A number of factors are responsible for selectivity deviations from the 

corresponding ideal values, such as pressure and temperature conditions or non-ideality 

due to co-existence of molecules in the mixture. Nonetheless, ideal values found in 

literature can be taken as a good starting point for the selection of an appropriate 

membrane material (Koros, 1995; Hsieh, 1996). It is important to refer that separation 

factors are frequently influenced not only by differences in intrinsic diffusivities, but also 

by their adsorption extent. For instance, the presence of an adsorbed compound may hinder 

the diffusion of other molecules, which may reduce strongly the permeability in 

microporous materials. This subject will be discussed in more detail in Chapter III. 

   

2. Inorganic membranes 

New membrane application fields have high demands and expectations regarding its 

thermal stability for high temperature applications, solvent and chemistry stability, 

sterilization ability and biocompactibility (Caro et al., 2000). Although polymeric 

membranes show interesting selectivity in many gas separations, they can, in general, 

hardly operate successfully at harsh conditions. On the other hand, the high thermal and 

chemical stability and resistance to high pressure differences of microporous inorganic 

membranes make them promising materials for new gas separation applications. Moreover, 

the chemical stability of polymeric membrane is also limited with respect to pH and 

organic liquids, whereas inorganic materials can generally be applied at a large pH range 

and in any organic solvent. Also important are their greater lifetime and ease of cleaning, 

especially in high fouling applications (Mulder, 1997).  



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 11 

Many efforts have been made to design new polymers or modify existing materials in 

order to overcome the stability limitations of polymeric membranes (Shao et al., 2009). For 

instance, interesting properties may be found by the synthesis of a block polymer system, 

consisting of microphase separated structures of hard glassy and soft rubbery polymer 

segments (Okamoto et al., 1995; Powell and Qiao, 2006). In this case, gas permeation 

occurs primarily through the flexible chain structure of rubbery segments, which provides 

a good permeability, while glassy polymers offer mechanical support and chemical and 

thermal resistance, especially when formed by high temperature materials such as 

polyimides or polypyrrolones (Powell and Qiao, 2006). Synthesis of organic-inorganic 

hybrid membranes or mixed-matrix membranes is an additional technique to enhance the 

properties of polymeric membranes (Merkel et al., 2002; Bernardo et al., 2009) . The use 

of two materials with different flux and selectivity allows the combination of polymers 

features with the high performance of inorganic materials. However, besides economical 

advantages of mixed-matrix membranes over inorganic ones, their brittleness and 

difficulties for commercial scale manufacture remain important challenges.  

Inorganic membranes can be synthesized from different materials (e.g., ceramic, 

glass, metal and zeolite-type materials). The most studied microporous inorganic 

membranes are amorphous metal oxides and zeolites. The first group has a very limited 

hydrothermal stability, excluding them for gas separation in atmospheres containing steam 

at high temperature. On the other hand, zeolite and related materials (e.g., titanosilicates 

and vanadosilicates) offer much better thermal and hydrothermal stability (Rocha and 

Anderson, 2000). 

At this point, it is convenient to clarify some nomenclature aspects. The terms zeolite 

and molecular sieve are often indistinctly used in literature. It is then straightforward to 

present a convenient classification of molecular sieves as function of their composition, 

which is given in Figure II.2.

2.1 Zeolite membranes  

In recent years, zeolites have attracted increasing interest due to their potential applications 

as separation membranes, catalytic membrane reactors, chemical sensors, electrodes, opto-

electronic devices, or low dielectric constant materials for use as electrical insulators, 

protection or insulation layers (Caro and Noack, 2008).  

Zeolites are three-dimensional microporous crystalline solids with a well defined 

structure of channels and cavities (Breck, 1974; Rocha and Anderson, 2000). These 

materials have a regular framework formed by a three-dimensional combination of SiO4 

and AlO4 tetrahedrons building blocks connected with each other by shared oxygen atoms. 

An isolated SiO4 group contains a charge of -4 while it is neutral in a solid containing an 

O/Si ratio of two, since each oxygen atom is connected with two Si atoms; the AlO4 unit 

charge is -1. Accordingly, the global structure of zeolites carries a negative charge, which 

is neutralized by exchangeable extra-framework cations, generally from groups I and II of 

periodic table. The structural formula of zeolites may be expressed for the crystallographic 

unit cell as:  



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 13 

Mx/n[(AlO2)x(SiO2)y].mH2O  

where M  is a cation of valence n , which balances the negative charge,  m  is the number 
of water molecules in the zeolite, and the sum yx +  is the total number of tetrahedra in the 

unit cell. The channels and cavities of zeolites framework are occupied by the cations and 

water molecules.  

Based on their pore dimensions, zeolites are classified into small, medium, large, and 

ultra-large pore materials (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999; Guisnet and Giilson, 2002; Chao et 

al., 2008). Small pore structures have eight-membered ring pore aperture, medium pore 

structures have 10-membered rings, large pore zeolite have 12-membered rings, and ultra-

large frameworks consist of 14-, 18-, and 20-membered rings. Some examples of zeolite 

structures with different pore dimensions are pictured in Figure II.3 

 

 

Figure II.3 – Classification of zeolites based on pore dimensions. Adapted from Chao et 
al. (2008).  

 

Zeolite materials own a number of advantages over other microporous materials, 

such as pores with uniform molecular dimensions, ion exchange capability and selectivity, 

interesting adsorption properties, relatively easy catalytic activation, possibility to develop 

internal acidity, high thermal stability and high internal surface area (Tavolaro and Drioli, 

1999). Additionally, they can be regenerated using relatively easy and well known 

methods, as thermal, pressure, and related swing adsorption, or ion exchange (Wankat, 

1994). 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes

The molecular sieving action of microporous zeolites, together with their large 

surface areas and controlled host-sorbate interactions, are the primary motivations in 

zeolitic membranes (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). These features allow them to carry out 

separations which are out of reach for common membranes (e.g. separation of isomers or 

compounds with similar diameters, polarities and/or molecular weight) and compete with 

traditional separation methods.  

In order to prepare supported membranes, zeolite crystals need to grow on porous 

substrates to form a continuous film, having the zeolitic pores as the unique available 

pathway for molecules transport (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Zeolite membranes are 

commonly prepared by in situ direct hydrothermal synthesis on porous supports. This 

method involves one step liquid-phase hydrothermal synthesis on the top or inside of 

support pores, which is immersed into a zeolite precursor gel or clear solution, under 

autogenous pressure and at a constant temperature.  

Alternatively, the zeolite layer can be formed in two steps using seed crystals, which 

grow together to form a continuous supported zeolite layer in a subsequent hydrothermal 

synthesis. With this seeding crystallization technique, the nucleation and the crystal growth 

are decoupled allowing a controlled preparation of supported zeolite membranes. In the 

first step, a colloidal suspension of zeolite crystal seeds is prepared in the absence of the 

support. Subsequently, these seeds are deposited on the surface support and brought into 

contact with a solution containing the necessary nutrients for growth. A continuous zeolite 

layer is then formed by a second crystallization step. Since the concentration needed for 

secondary growth is lower than the required for nucleation, further nucleation is strongly 

decreased and almost all crystals growth takes place over the existing crystal seeds. By 

regulating the composition and concentration of the secondary growth solution, the rate 

and direction of crystals growth can be controlled. An oriented zeolite film is advantageous 

because the number of intercrystalline defects is reduced when crystals grow uniformly in 

the same direction. Moreover, higher permeabilities could be expected when crystal 

orientation allows the channels to be aligned with flow direction (Coronas and Santamaria, 

1999). Furthermore, by providing the nutrients from the growth side, membrane thickness 

can be more accurately controlled; in this way, membranes with a thickness of only a few 

hundreds nanometres may be prepared.

 15 

Finally, zeolite layers can also be synthesized by crystallization of an amorphous dry 

gel on the porous support either by a vapour-phase transport method, when the structure-

directing agent (SDA) is in the vapour, or by steam-assisted crystallization with a dry gel 

containing the SDA (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Caro et al., 2000; Caro and Noack, 

2008).  

Undesirable transmembrane pathways larger than the intracrystalline zeolite pores, 

i.e. defects, are frequently formed during membrane synthesis. Larger defects could be 

eliminated by repeated crystallization (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Tavolaro and Drioli, 

1999). A number of researchers have concluded that their membranes prepared in a single 

hydrothermal synthesis had defects because of the lack of connectivity between the 

individual particles, which points out that one synthesis may be not enough to achieve 

sufficient crystal intergrowth. Elimination of small defects may be possible by post-

synthesis processing methods such as chemical vapor deposition of silica, via reaction with 

a silicon alkoxide or other silylation agents. Those treatments involve reduction of the pore 

openings on the external surface of the crystals (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999; Tavolaro 

and Drioli, 1999).  

The synthesis of supported zeolite membranes has been carried out following trial 

and error procedures. The starting point to obtain a new zeolite membrane involves, in 

general, a synthesis gel with a composition similar to that reported for the synthesis of the 

zeolite as individual crystals. Once synthesised, the membrane would be subjected to 

characterization, and, depending on the results obtained, the synthesis would be repeated 

under different preparation conditions: gel composition, synthesis time, method of wetting 

the support, or rotation of the autoclave. It is worth noting that the presence of the support 

introduces a number of new factors which makes synthesis more difficult to reproduce. For 

instance, the mechanism of nucleation changes because the surface of the support provides 

nucleation sites that are not present in homogenous synthesis, and the support itself may 

dissolve in the synthesis gel and change its composition (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999).

2.2 Titanosilicate membranes  

Microporous titanosilicates are novel materials that may broad the scope of application of 

zeolite membranes and thin films to separations, catalytic membrane reactors and sensors. 

The structure of these materials consists of interlinked octahedral and tetrahedral 

frameworks. Similarly to zeolites, titanosilicates exhibit a well-defined three-dimensional 

crystalline structure with molecular dimensions, being able to separate mixtures based on 

differences in affinity and sieving effect (Lin et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1999; 

Rocha and Anderson, 2000). Moreover, they offer important benefits over classical zeolite 

membranes, namely: i) they are generally synthesised in the absence of organic templates, 

avoiding usual subsequent calcination treatments (at nearly 500ºC), which often cause 

irreversible defects and/or loss of active surface groups; ii) they are usually prepared under 

moderate pH conditions (generally, at pH=10–13), reducing chemical attack to the support; 

iii) they exhibit novel possibilities of isomorphous framework substitution, allowing for  

fine-tuning catalytic and adsorption properties; and iv) generally, they have strong 

alkalinity, complementing the acid properties of classic zeolites (Lin et al., 2004). 

AM-3 (Aveiro-Manchester number 3) is a synthetic microporous titanosilicate 

analogue of mineral penkvilksite, with an ideal formula Na4Ti2SiO22.5H2O (Lin et al., 

1997). Its structure consists of SiO4 tetrahedra connected by individual TiO6 octahedra 

forming a three-dimensional framework of 6-ring channels (Lin et al., 2006). In a previous 

work it was shown that AM materials do not adsorb any significant amount of nitrogen but 

they do adsorb water in relatively large amounts (Lin et al., 1997). In addition, AM-3 was 

demonstrated to be stable up to ca. 600 ºC, loosing water and rehydrating reversibly after 

being kept in air for a few hours at room temperature. A detailed morphological 

characterization of AM-3 was first reported by Lin et al. (1997) and later by Rocha and 

Anderson (2000). Figure II.4a shows a scanning electron micrograph of AM-3 crystals. 

ETS-10 (Engelhard Titanosilicate number 10) is a synthetic microporous 

titanosilicate discovered by Kuznicki (1989), with no mineral analogue. Its structure is 

composed by corner sharing SiO4 tetrahedra and TiO4 octahedra, linked by oxygen atoms, 

forming a three-dimensional system of wide 12-membered pores. This material shows a 

disordered structure and has excellent characteristics for diffusion (Rocha and Anderson, 

2000). Moreover, ETS-10 has a remarkable high thermal stability. The structural formula 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 17 

of the ETS-10 basic unit is Si4OTi8O10416-, which is balanced by 16 monovalent cations 

(usually Na+ and K+) (Rocha and Anderson, 2000). A scanning electron micrograph of 

ETS-10 crystals is presented in Figure II.4b. 

 

 

Figure II.4 – Scanning electron micrograph of: a) AM-3 crystals and b) ETS-10 crystals 
(Lin et al., 1997; Pavel et al., 2002).  

 

Only a small number of microporous titanosilicate membranes have been synthesized 

and characterized, mainly reporting on ETS-4 (Braunbarth et al., 2000; Guan et al., 

2001,2002). Accordingly, separations of N2 from CO2, O2, Ar and CH4 as well as 

pervaporation experiments of water/ethanol mixtures have been investigated using this 

material. Preparation of ETS-4 films on porous alumina and titania supports have been also 

described by Yilmaz et al. (2006), however only the crystals orientation was investigated. 

Hetero-epitaxial growth of ETS-10 on ETS-4 has been performed, but no permeation or 

separation results have been published (Jeong et al., 2002). Preparation and 

characterization of ETS-10 membranes were presented for the first time by Lin et al. 

(2004), where pure N2 permeation and water/alcohol pervaporation experiments were 

carried out. Subsequently, permeation of different gases at programmed temperature, and 

propylene/propane separation studies in ETS-10 membranes were reported by Tiscornia et 

al.  (2005,2007). These studies showed ETS-10 is able to separate propylene/propane and 

water/ethanol mixtures with separation factors ranging between 3.8-6.5 and 7-12, 

respectively. Sebastian et al. (2005,2006,2008) reported the synthesis, characterization,

and separation properties of a Ti-Silicate umbite membrane (AM-2) prepared on porous ?-

alumina and TiO2 tubular supports by seeded hydrothermal synthesis; selectivities higher 

than 30 were obtained for H2 separation from N2, CO2 or propane mixtures. Moreover, 

Sebastian et al. (2008) used AM-2 membranes for H2/N2 separation in the presence of 

moisture concluding that, unlike other microporous zeolitic hydrophilic membranes, water 

should not permeate through the intrinsic micropores of the zeolitic material, undergoing 

capillary condensation in the inter-crystalline defects, giving rise to an increase in the 

H2/N2 selectivity. Reported results have revealed the potential of these membranes for real 

applications concerning purification of hydrogen-containing streams, and H2 proton-

exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.  

 

3. Characterization methods 

There is no universal method for characterization of all materials due to the numerous 

characteristics involved and because the wide variety of membrane operating conditions 

influences directly its performance. Frequently, more than one technique is required in a 

detailed examination (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). A combination of well defined 

characterization techniques gives valuable information about membrane morphology, 

which may suggest possible fields of application. In addition, it can serve as a feed-back 

for high quality membrane preparation.  

Two different types of characterization methods can be distinguished for porous 

membranes: structure-related methods, in which the pore size, pore size distribution, top 

layer thickness, surface porosity and crystallinity are determined; and permeation-related 

methods, where the actual separation parameters are investigated. There are a number of 

structural characterization techniques available for porous media, being the following the 

most frequently used for microporous membranes: X-ray diffraction (XRD), which is 

indispensable to identify the crystals formed in the synthesis, and to evaluate their purity; 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM), used to analyse the shape and size of crystals, and 

their distribution on the support, as well as to provide a measurement of membrane 

thickness and a first impression on the existence of inter-crystalline defects; and surface 

analyzing techniques such as electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray Photoelectron 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 19 

Spectroscopy (XPS) or Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), used to measure the 

chemical elements concentration across the membrane. Concerning the permeation-related 

methods, the determination of the gas permeabilities through synthesized materials is 

particularly important because it is the only tool allowing verification of membrane 

compactness and selectivity (Tavolaro and Drioli, 1999). Specific permeation 

measurements, either of single gases or multicomponent mixtures, provide extremely 

useful information on the effective membrane pore structure, and on the existence of inter-

crystalline defects. Moreover, in contrast with structural characterization techniques, the 

whole membrane surface may be investigated. Permeation experiments are often 

complemented by adsorption measurements, which may help to identify and/or distinguish 

the involved permeation mechanisms (Coronas and Santamaria, 1999). With permeation 

results, the ideal preparation conditions to promote an efficient intergrowth between 

crystals can be found. Finally, the permeation of mixtures is the real test to evaluate 

membrane quality to perform a given separation.  

 

4. Hydrogen Purification  

Hydrogen is an alternative clean fuel for future sustainable energy economy. The 

development of “The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform” of the European 

Union (HFPeurope, 2009 ) clearly supports the importance of this subject. Presently, steam 

reforming, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, autothermal reforming, and gasification of 

biomass are the best economically viable options for H2 production (Hsieh, 1996; Fang et 

al., 2008; Rand and Dell, 2008). The downstream processing of the resulting mixtures, 

mainly H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/light-hydrocarbons, can be advantageously accomplished 

by membrane technology (Hsieh, 1996). 

Many techniques are in use or under study for hydrogen separation and purification, 

including PSA, cryogenic separation, catalytic purification and membrane processes. 

Membrane technology for gas separation plays an increasingly vital role owing to their 

well known advantages. Several membrane materials have been used for H2 recovery. Pd 

metal membranes show long-term thermal and mechanical stability, as well as high 

separation factors towards H2; however, Pd and its alloys are extremely expensive, making 



Fundamentals of Membrane Processes 

 20 

this material economically impractical for large-scale applications (Freemantle, 2005; 

Adams and Mickalonis, 2007). In addition, another technical disadvantage of Pd 

membranes is their high sensitivity to chemicals, such as sulphur or even CO (Freemantle, 

2005). Polymeric membranes are the most widely used due to their relatively low 

manufacturing cost, but their chemical and thermal stability limits their application in H2 

purification under harsh conditions. For instance, H2 and CO2 are formed at high 

temperature during the steam reforming process. An efficient separation of the produced 

H2 should occur at the reforming temperature, which is over 450ºC. Unlike polymeric 

membranes, the inorganic ones are robust under such conditions and may exhibit high 

selectivities.  

Amorphous metal oxides membranes have very limited hydrothermal stability, 

excluding them for H2 removal from atmospheres containing steam at high temperature. 

On the other hand, zeolite membranes offer much better thermal and hydrothermal 

stability, but the pore size of most applied materials is not sufficiently narrow for highly 

selective H2 separation. Titanosilicate membranes may become especially competitive for 

industrial applications due to their narrow pore size, promoting an effective size-exclusion 

separation.

III. Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous 
Media 

 

The understanding of mass transport mechanisms is essential for an accurate modelling of 

the permeances. Modelling is fundamental for interpretation of experimental data and as a 

predictive tool. Prediction and correlation of permeation and separation behavior requires 

knowledge on single and multicomponent diffusion, adsorption and structure parameters. 

These parameters may be determined by experimental methods and adequate modelling of 

transport phenomena. This chapter describes mass transport phenomena and adsorption 

equilibrium occurring in microporous membranes. First, transport mechanisms for single 

gases in porous media are briefly explained, and the corresponding equations presented. 

Multicomponent mass transport relations for the flux through microporous membranes are 

subsequently derived based on Irreversible Thermodynamics theory and on the Maxwell-

Stefan equations. Finally, the adsorption equilibrium of pure and multicomponent systems 

is discussed in the last section of the chapter. 

 

1. Single gas permeation 

The transport mechanisms involved in porous media (see Figure III.1) are primarily related 

with pore diameter, pd . Accordingly, viscous flow dominates in macropores ( 50p &gt;d nm), 

where the fluid flows as a whole under a pressure gradient. In mesopores and micropores (

502 p&amp;lt;&amp;lt;d nm and 2p&amp;lt;d nm, respectively), collisions between molecules and pore 

surface are fundamental. When the mean free path, ? , (i.e., the average distance traversed 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 22 

by a molecule between collisions) is comparable or larger than the pore diameter, transport 

falls in Knudsen regime. In small micropores, pore size approaches the molecular 

dimensions and the molecules may not be as free as in Knudsen diffusion, where the effect 

of the potential field of the solid surface is minimal (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996). In this 

case, commonly described as configurational diffusion, molecules may never completely 

escape from the force field of the surface (Xiao and Wei, 1992a) and diffusion becomes an 

activated process. Based on the mode of translational motion of molecules inside the pores, 

two distinct mechanisms may be distinguished here: molecules may retain their gaseous 

state (gas translational or activated gaseous diffusion) or lose their gaseous entity due to 

strong interaction with the solid framework and move as an adsorbed phase (solid vibration 

or surface diffusion) (Xiao and Wei, 1992a).

porous media. Adapted from Krishna (1993). 

 

Several approaches have been proposed in literature to describe surface diffusion 

(Uhlhorn et al., 1992; Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Burggraaf, 1999), including the hopping 

model, by which molecules move over the surface by hopping between adjacent adsorption 

sites (minima in the potential energy field of the pore) (Gilliland et al., 1974; Okazaki et 

al., 1981; Xiao and Wei, 1992a; Krishna, 1993), the hydrodynamic model, in which 

adsorbed molecules are considered as a fluid film, which merely slide along the surface 

(Gilliland et al., 1958; Gilliland et al., 1974), and the random walk model, based on the 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 23 

two-dimensional form of Fick’s first law. Nonetheless, the hopping model is the most 

frequently adopted for modeling surface diffusion in micropores (Krishna, 1990; Xiao and 

Wei, 1992a,b; Krishna, 1993; Bakker et al., 1997; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and 

Baur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004), being adopted as well in this dissertation.  

Similarly to the surface diffusion, the activated transport of gaseous molecules inside 

the pore may be assumed to occur by a sequence of jumps from site to site, restricted by 

the energy barrier imposed by the surface. Several authors report the activated gaseous 

diffusion as an activated process analogous to a Knudsen mechanism, denoting it by 

activated Knudsen diffusion (Bakker et al., 1996; Burggraaf and Cot, 1996; Burggraaf, 

1999; Romero et al., 2004). However, Burggraaf and Cot (1996) present a slightly 

different concept to describe this mechanism. In their description, molecules are assumed 

to move freely between adsorption sites, involving an activated sub-step and a Knudsen 

diffusion step. This situation is reported for a ratio between pore diameter and kinetic 

molecular diameter around two. Moreover, the configurational diffusion regime is reached 

with decreasing pore size, where the remaining gaseous state within the pore is assumed to 

be vanished and only surface diffusion may occur.  

 

1.1 Viscous flow 

In macropores, intermolecular collisions are dominant and the mean free path of diffusion 

species is smaller than the pore diameter. In this case, the molar flux, vJ , under a pressure 

gradient may be described by a Hagen-Poiseuille type-law:

?  is the gas constant, and z  is distance coordinate. The factor ??  is introduced in the 

flux equation to account for geometrical effects of the porous structure, being ?  and ?  the 

porosity and tortuosity, respectively.

It may be noted from equation (III.2) that permeance under viscous flow increases 

with increasing mean pressure, and declines with rising temperature (note that gas 

viscosity also increases with temperature). 

 

1.2 Knudsen diffusion 

Knudsen diffusion prevails in mesopores, where the mean free path of diffusing species is 

close to the pore diameter (Knudsen, 1909). Under this regime, molecule-pore wall 

collisions are important, being responsible for diffusion.  

Knudsen diffusivity, KnD , may be expressed as the product of a geometric factor by a 

characteristic diffusion length and by the velocity of gas molecules (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). 

In this case, the diffusion length is the pore diameter, and the velocity of diffusing 

molecules is given by the kinetic theory of gases. The geometric factor is 3/1  since only 

those molecules moving in the direction under consideration must be taken into account 

(Xiao and Wei, 1992a). Thus,

where D  is the Fick diffusion coefficient, ? is the gradient operator, and c  is the

obtained by combining equation (III.3) with the Fick’s first law (III.4), expressed in terms 

of the pressure gradient, and introducing factor ??  in order to account for structure 

geometrical effects (Burggraaf and Cot, 1996):

1.3 Diffusion in micropores 

As aforementioned, the hopping model will be adopted in the following discussion. Gas 

diffusion in micropores may be explained as an activated process (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). 

In this case, the Fick diffusion coefficient may be expressed as follows: 

?

being g  a geometrical factor, u  the mean velocity of diffusing species, and dl  the 

diffusion length. The exponential term reflects the activated nature of the process and 

expresses the probability of a molecule to have sufficient kinetic energy to surmount an 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 26 

energy barrier, aE . The parameters involved in equation (III.7) are dependent on the pore 

and molecule dimension and thus on the corresponding system.  

Mass transport of single gases is generally described by the Fick’s first law, where a 

concentration gradient is assumed to be the driving force (see equation (III.4)). However, 

the true driving force for diffusion is believed to be the chemical potential gradient 

(Ruthven, 1984), which is most relevant in a microporous system. Accordingly, the 

permeation flux of a single gas in micropores (in the z–direction), in isothermal conditions, 

is more accurately described by: 

z

?=  (III.8)

where B  is the mobility of diffusing gas, q  is its molar concentration in the particle, ?  is 

the particle density, and ?  is the chemical potential. Assuming the gas phase as ideal, i.e., 

PT?? ln0 ?+= , where 0?  is its standard chemical potential, the following relationship 

may be obtained:  

dz

where TBÐ ?=  is a corrected diffusion coefficient equivalent to a Maxwell-Stefan (MS) 
diffusivity (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). Similarly to the 

Maxwell-Stefan formulation, a thermodynamic factor may be defined as qP? lnln ??= , 

and the expression for permeation may be written as: 

dz
dq

??ÐJ ?=  
(III.10)

 

Fick and corrected diffusivities are related by the thermodynamic factor as Ð?D = . 
This relation, known as Darken equation, expresses the concentration dependence of Fick 

diffusivity, involving a generally concentration-independent corrected diffusivity. The 

integration of equation (III.10) is only possible if the relation between q  and P  is known. 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 27 

In the following, its application to activated gaseous diffusion and surface diffusion 

mechanisms will be analyzed. 

 

1.3.1 Activated gaseous diffusion 

In the case of activated gaseous diffusion, the velocity of the molecules in gas phase is 

described by the kinetic theory of gases, similarly to the Knudsen mechanism, the diffusion 

distance may be considered the distance between two adjacent sites of low energy, dl , 

while  the geometrical factor is the probability of a molecule moving in the direction under 

consideration, Z1 , being Z  the number of adjacent sites (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). The 

activation energy, ga,E , is the energy required for molecules to surmount the attractive 

constrictions imposed by the pore structure. As a result, the diffusivity of gaseous 

molecules is given by:

For surface diffusion of adsorbed molecules, the diffusion length corresponds to the 

distance between two adjacent sites, dl , and the geometrical factor represents the 

probability of a molecule moving in the direction under consideration, Z/1 , similarly to 

the activated gaseous diffusion mechanism (Xiao and Wei, 1992a). Additionally, the 

velocity of adsorbed molecules is given by the product of the jump frequency, ( )q? , with 
the jump distance. Hence, Fick diffusivity may be expressed as

In order to determine the thermodynamic factor and thus the flux of adsorbed 

molecules, the isotherm must be known. Based on different concepts and assumptions, a 

number of adsorption models can be found in literature (Do, 1998; Burggraaf, 1999; 

Pakizeh et al., 2007), as will be discussed next in section 2.3.  

The adsorption of gas molecules in microporous membranes occurs frequently in

where the subscripts f  and p  refer to membrane feed and permeate sides conditions, 

respectively.  

As shown by equation (III.21), the dependence of surface permeance on temperature 

is not quite straightforward. Following Burggraaf (1999), assuming 1pL&amp;lt;Pb , a maximum 

in the permeance may be expected when adssa, HE ??&amp;lt;. Similarly, Van de Graaf et al. 

(1998b) analyzed the permeance behavior with temperature and demonstrated that (i) if 

adssa, HE ??&gt; , no solution is found and there is no maximum in the flux as function of 

temperature, being the activated  diffusion dominant over all temperature range; (ii) if 

adssa, HE ??= , a maximum exists only when occupancy approaches zero; in this case the 

flux approaches an asymptotic value at higher temperatures becoming temperature-

independent, and (iii) if adssa, HE ??&amp;lt;, a maximum in the flux can effectively be observed. 

The same conclusions were drawn by Kapteijn et al. (2000b) by calculating the first 

derivative of the permeation flux equation.  

Corrected, or MS, diffusivities have been assumed here to be concentration-

independent; however, sÐ  is generally function of molecular loading (Krishna, 1990; 

Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004). Molecular 

dynamics (MD) simulations have shown this simplification is accurate in a number of 

systems but may considerably fail in others. For instance, Skoulidas and Sholl (2001,2002) 

obtained occupancy-independent diffusivities of He, Ar and Ne in MFI (silicalite and 

ZSM-5 zeolites) while for larger molecules, such as CF4 and SF6, they were found to 

depend on surface occupancy. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations performed by Paschek 

and Krishna (2000) for diffusion of 2-methylhexane in silicalite also exhibit a dependence 

of sÐ  on surface loading. The behavior of MS diffusion coefficient with occupancy has 

been found to diverge concerning the permeating gas and membrane structure. For 

instance, MS diffusivities of several gases through different zeolite structures were shown 

to decrease strongly with increasing loading, following in many systems the relation 

( ) ( )?ÐÐ ?=? 10)( ss , where ( )0sÐ  is the zero-loading diffusivity (Krishna, 1990; Krishna 
and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 2003; Krishna et al., 2004).  



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 31 

At low pressures the Henry’s regime for adsorption is frequently valid. Under these 

conditions, the concentration of adsorbed gas depends linearly on the pressure, i.e., 

KPq =  (III.22)

where K  is the Henry’s constant. As for the case of activated gaseous diffusion, the 
thermodynamic factor is here unity, and thus Fick and corrected diffusion coefficients are 

equal and concentration-independent (Gavalas, 2008). In this case equation (III.10) equals 

the Fick’s first law. The dependence of K  on temperature is also given by a van’t Hoff-
type relation:

As equation (III.25) shows, the permeance-temperature behavior under Henry’s 

regime depends on the relative values of sa,E  and adsH? . The permeance will 

monotonically increase or decrease when the activation energy for diffusion is larger or 

smaller than the heat of adsorption, respectively . 

 

1.4 Gas permeation through microporous membranes 

It is generally found that both surface and activated gaseous diffusion mechanisms 

contribute to the overall mass transport through a microporous membrane.  The degree to 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 32 

which each mechanism contributes to the total permeation depends mainly on the 

adsorption properties of the system, as well as on the conditions of temperature and 

pressure (Dong et al., 2000; Gardner et al., 2002; Zah et al., 2007). Moreover, in real 

membrane systems, Knudsen diffusion and/or viscous flow may be expected to contribute 

to the total permeation flux as well, owing to the presence of defects in the crystalline 

structure. 

The fluxes from different diffusion mechanisms are additive. Accordingly, the total 

permeation flux through microporous membranes may be written as follows:  

 
gsKnvmicroporesdefectstotal JJJJJJJ +++=+=   (III.26)

It is worth noting that the effect of the support must be taken into account in the calculation 

of the effective totalJ , since only a fraction of the total area is available for permeation. This 

obligates to multiply equation (III.26) by a support geometric factor, which is commonly 

associated to its porosity and tortuosity. 

The transport mechanism controlling the permeation process may be discriminated 

from the permeance-temperature behavior, in agreement with the previous discussion. For 

instance, diffusion of non-adsorbable gases in micropores is expected to increase 

monotonically with temperature. However, a minimum in the permeance is frequently 

found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to the presence of defects, since 

permeation flux resulting from both viscous and Knudsen mechanisms decreases with 

increasing temperature. 

The transport of strongly adsorbing molecules at low or moderate temperatures is 

dominated by surface diffusion, while activated gaseous diffusion may prevail at high 

temperatures (van den Broeke et al., 1999b; Zhu et al., 2006; Gavalas, 2008). In this case, 

a maximum followed by a minimum in the permeance could be anticipated (Bakker et al., 

1997; Coronas et al., 1997; Burggraaf et al., 1998; van de Graaf et al., 1998a). At low 

temperatures, permeance increases because the diffusivity of adsorbed molecules is 

enhanced by temperature, even though the surface coverage simultaneously decreases; at a 

given temperature, the decrease in the adsorbed concentration becomes the determining 

factor, so that the overall permeance will start to decrease. At higher temperatures, 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 33 

adsorption could be negligible and permeance would be expected to exponentially 

increase, given the activated nature of diffusion through micropores (Nishiyama et al., 

2001). Once more a minimum in the permeance is commonly observed at lower 

temperatures, which may be attributed to an additional contribution of viscous and/or 

Knudsen mechanisms. 

 

2. Multicomponent Diffusion 

Multicomponent mass transport has been described based on three main approaches, 

namely, the Fickian formalism, the thermodynamics of irreversible processes (IT) theory, 

and the generalized Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations.  

The widely applied Fick’s first law (equation (III.4)) may be generalized to describe 

multicomponent systems (Taylor and Krishna, 1993). However, these diffusivities do not 

have the same physical significance of the binary coefficients since they do not reflect pair 

interactions. Moreover, similarly to single component diffusion, for accurate modeling and 

theoretical understanding of multicomponent diffusion, it is convenient to adopt the more 

fundamental approach based the chemical potential gradients as the true driving force for 

diffusion (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997; Smit and Maesen, 2008). 

Furthermore, in the presence of electrostatic or centrifugal force fields, Fick’s first law 

cannot be properly applied (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). 

As alternative to the generalized Fick’s law, both the irreversible thermodynamics 

and the Maxwell-Stefan models express the diffusion fluxes in terms of chemical potential 

gradients and can include the effect of external force fields into the respective equations.  

 

2.1 Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (IT) 

Transport phenomena occur under the action of driving forces. While irreversible mass and 

heat fluxes take place, local equilibrium may be assumed, and a thermodynamic treatment 

may be valid near equilibrium under steady state conditions (Haase, 1969).  



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 34 

Transport through membranes may be described by thermodynamics of irreversible 

processes. During irreversible processes, under the action of a constant driving force, the 

free energy is continually dissipated and entropy is produced. Such entropy production 

provides a fundamental difference between irreversible and classical thermodynamics, 

where entropy is constant.  

The derivation of the IT model involves three postulates (Bitter, 1991; Mulder, 

1997), namely: 

(1) The rate of entropy production in irreversible processes, ? , is calculated from the 

dissipation function, ? , which always has the form:   

0ii ?==? ? XJT?
i

      (III.27)

where the iJ  are generalized fluxes and iX  the appropriate (conjugate) generalized forces. 

 (2) Close to equilibrium, a linear dependence of the flux and the forces is assumed:

ij XLJ
m

j
i ?

=

where ijL  are the Onsager coefficients.  

(3) Following the Onsager reciprocal relations, the coefficients ijL  are symmetric, 

i.e.: 

jiij LL =  (III.29)

For an isothermal binary system in the absence of any external forces, the driving 

force is the chemical potential gradient, ?? , and thus: 

2121111 ?L?LJ ????=  (III.30)

2221212 ?L?LJ ????=  (III.31)



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 35 

Diffusion flux equations derived from irreversible thermodynamics provide a real 

description for transport through membranes. Besides, the existence of coupling of driving 

forces and/or diffusion fluxes can be evidenced and clearly described (Bitter, 1991; 

Mulder, 1997). However, in this description the membrane is considered as a black box 

and no information is obtained or required about molecules permeation, which may limit 

the applicability of this approach concerning the membrane nature and separation 

mechanisms (Bitter, 1991; Mulder, 1997). 

 

2.2 Maxwell-Stefan Equations  

Maxwell-Stefan formalism is the most widely used approach to describe multicomponent 

diffusion. Although formally equivalent to the IT theory, it is recognized to be the most 

advantageous and preferable alternative (Krishna, 1990; Gardner et al., 2002; Krishna, 

2009).  

MS model was originally developed for description of binary mixtures (Krishna, 

1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997). Accordingly, in order to cause a relative 

motion between the two components of the mixture, a force must be exerted on each 

component. This force on molecule 1 is balanced by the friction between both species, 

which is proportional to their relative velocity, and to the molar fraction of the second 

molecule, 2x . The force balance is then given by:

T

? ?

where 1u  and 2u  are velocities of 1 and 2 , respectively, and 12Ð  is the  Maxwell-Stefan 

diffusivity, which describes the interaction between both components; the term 12ÐT?  

may be interpreted as a drag coefficient between the molecules. Equation (III.32) may be 

combined with the definition of molar flux, i.e. iiti uxcN = , to get:

being tc  the total molar concentration. 

Since friction between different species is explicitly accounted by the Maxwell–

Stefan theory, it may be especially suitable for describing multicomponent mass transport. 

The MS model presented for a binary mixture can thus be extended to a general 

multicomponent system. In this case, generalized MS equations express the balances 

between the chemical potential gradient of species i  and the friction exerted on i  by all 

other species j , according to:

being i?  the activity coefficient of species i  in the mixture, which may be evaluated  by 

thermodynamics models (e.g., the Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC, and UNIFAC models). For 

dense gas mixtures exhibiting deviations to the ideal gas behavior, fugacity coefficient may 

be used instead (Taylor and Krishna, 1993).  

For simplicity, equation (III.34) can be combined with equation (III.35) and 

expressed in 1?n  dimensional matrix form, explicitly written in terms of diffusion fluxes:

By comparison of equation (III.36) with the generalized Fick´s law [ ]( )xDcJ ??= t)( , 
it follows that Fick and Maxwell-Stefan coefficients are related by:  

[ ] [ ] [ ]?= ?1BD  (III.38)

While Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity has a fundamental physical meaning of an inverse 

drag coefficient, Fick diffusivity couples the drag effects with thermodynamic non-ideality 

effects (Krishna, 1993). Hence, MS diffusivity may be more easily interpretable and 

predictable than Fick diffusivity. Besides, because of the strong composition dependence 

of thermodynamic factor, Fick diffusivity may be expected to exhibit strong composition 

dependence as well. For ideal systems it may be easily found that [ ] [ ] 1?= BD . 

The superiority of the MS formalism in terms of physical interpretation of the 

corresponding diffusivities can be extended to the Onsager coefficients ijL  (Krishna, 

2009). Nonetheless, Krishna and Wesselingh (1997) and Skoulidas et al. (2003) have 

shown that the three formalisms are equivalent since the coefficients of each formulation 

can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of any of the other two. 

As aforementioned, several diffusion mechanisms can be distinguished within a 

porous material. In macro- and mesopores, viscous flow and/or Knudsen diffusion may 

occur; in mixtures, bulk or molecular diffusion is an additional mechanism. The Dusty Gas 

Model (DGM) (Jackson, 1977; Krishna, 1993) is the most widely used approach to 

describe combined bulk and Knudsen diffusion. The principle behind the DGM is to 

consider the porous solid as a collection of stationary giant molecules uniformly distributed 

in space. Those dust molecules are considered to be a pseudo-species in the 

multicomponent mixture, corresponding to the ( )1+n th component. By combining this

principle with Maxwell-Stefan formulation, the following n  independent equations may be

where Kni,Ð  is the Knudsen diffusivity, defined as 1n1ni,Kni, ++= xÐÐ , and reflects the 

molecule-wall collisions. In this case, the force exerted on species i  is balanced by the sum 

of the friction forces between molecular species i  and j  (bulk diffusion) together with the 

friction between species i  and the solid (Knudsen diffusion). Under the action of a 

pressure gradient, viscous flow will take place within the pores. Accordingly, the 

contribution from viscous mechanism may be included into the transport equation (Manson 

and del Castillo, 1985; Manson and Lonsdale, 1990; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997):

the partial molar volume of i , and i'?  is the viscous selectivity factor.  

Transport across a composite membrane is a combination of diffusion through both 

the separation top layer and porous support. Because supports are generally macro and/or 

mesoporous, transport across them can be accurately described by equation (III.40), since 

it embodies the various mechanisms present.  

Surface forces are dominant in microporous structures, where molecules never 

escape completely from the surface force field, even at the centre of the pore. By analogy 

with the DGM, diffusion of adsorbed species in micropores may be described assuming the 

surface vacant sites as a ( )1+n th pseudo-species in the multicomponent system. As a 
result, surface diffusion can be described by (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and 

Wesselingh, 1997):

for molecules with equal satq , where p?  and ?  are the matrix density and porosity,

species i  along the surface. The first term on the right-hand side represents the friction 

exerted on species i  by all the other components in the mixture, while the second term

The thermodynamic factors, ij? , are calculated based on the isotherms of each 

component. Extended Langmuir isotherm is one of the most popular adsorption models for 

two-component systems. This model usually provides a good data representation when 

saturation loadings of the two components are close. However, when saturation loadings 

differ significantly, extended Langmuir isotherms may not predict correctly the 

equilibrium data, particularly at high occupancies where adsorption of the component with 

higher saturation loading can prevail (van den Broeke et al., 1999c; Kapteijn et al., 2000a; 

Gavalas, 2008). Dual-site Langmuir (DSL) isotherms have been also adopted in modelling 

permeation of single component and binary mixtures, when two different adsorption sites 

are distinguished (Krishna et al., 1998; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 

2003; Krishna et al., 2004; Gavalas, 2008). Alternatively, a model based on the ideal 

adsorbed solution theory (IAST), developed by Myers and Prausnitz (1965) and Ruthven 

(1984) has been also adopted by several authors (e.g., van den Broeke et al. (1999a), 

Kapteijn et al. (2000a), and Yu et al. (2007)). Similarly to the extended Langmuir 

isotherm, the IAST model can be used to predict multicomponent adsorption equilibrium 

based on single gas-adsorption isotherms only (van den Broeke et al., 1999a; Zhu et al., 

2006; Gavalas, 2008). Kapteijn et al. (2000a) used the IAST model together with extended 

multicomponent diffusion equations to successfully describe the diffusion in mixtures of 

molecules with  different saturation loadings.

Mass transport of multicomponent mixtures may be predicted with Maxwell–Stefan 

equations based only on single components adsorption and diffusion data (van den Broeke 

et al., 1999a; Zhu et al., 2006). However, the individual contribution of each species in the 

mixture may differ significantly from its pure behavior, as, for instance, in the case of 

binary mixtures of a strong and weak adsorbable components. Although stronger 

adsorbates move slower than the weaker ones, their presence within small pores may create 

a barrier to the diffusion of the second ones, and hence hinder their transport across the 

membrane. As a result, an unexpected maximum may appear in the uptake profiles of the 

faster diffusing component (van den Broeke et al., 1999a,b; Yang et al., 1999). 

 

2.3 Adsorption equilibrium  

Several models are available in the literature providing appropriate descriptions for single 

and multicomponent adsorption equilibrium. For instance, Langmuir, Nitta, Freundlich, 

Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms are frequently adopted models. In this section 

their main characteristics and mathematical representation for pure and multicomponent 

systems are presented, along with the temperature dependence of their parameters. 

Langmuir theory has been the most widely used approach to describe equilibrium 

adsorption data in porous materials. This isotherm is a fundamental equation based on 

several basic assumptions, namely: i) adsorption on the surface is localized, i.e. molecules 

are adsorbed at a fixed number of well-defined localized adsorption sites; ii) each site can 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 42 

accommodate only one adsorbate molecule; iii) all sites are energetically equivalent, which 

means that the surface is homogeneous; and iv) there is no interaction between molecules 

adsorbed on neighbouring sites.  

The Langmuir model was developed based on a kinetic principle, assuming that the 

rate of adsorption is equal to the rate of desorption on the surface (Do, 1998). Accordingly, 

equation (III.16) may be obtained, which in the low pressure region reduces to the Henry 

law, and for sufficiently high pressures reaches the saturation capacity characteristic of the 

monolayer coverage. For N-component systems, Langmuir isotherm is:

(III.48)

For thermodynamic consistency of the extended Langmuir equation the saturation capacity 

of all species must be the same (Broughton, 1948). 

The model of Nitta was derived by Nitta et al. (1984), based on statistical 

thermodynamics. This theory provides an extension of the Langmuir isotherm, assuming 

localized monolayer adsorption on the surface and allowing for multi-site adsorption, 

where each molecule may be adsorbed on n  active sites (Do, 1998). The Nitta isotherm is 

given by:

For systems where the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is not as strong as the

In this case, Nitta isotherm reduces to the Langmuir equation when 1N =n . 

Nitta isotherm may be also extended to describe multicomponent systems. When all

(III.52)

Similarly to the single gas isotherm, when all 1iN, =n , equation (III.52) reduces to the 

extended Langmuir equation.  

Adsorbent materials generally exhibit a rather complex pore and surface structure. 

Consequently, fundamental adsorption isotherms, such as the classical Langmuir equation 

or the Nitta isotherm, may not accurately describe equilibrium. Accordingly, a number of 

semi-empirical approaches have been proposed. In the following, the Freundlich, 

Langmuir-Freundlich and Toth isotherm models will be briefly discussed.  

The Freundlich isotherm is one of the most frequently equations used to describe 

equilibria. It may be represented by: 

( ) FnPbq /1F=  (III.53)

Here, Fb  and Fn  are temperature-dependent parameters; Fn  usually lies in the range of 1 to 

5, and the larger this constant is, the more nonlinear sorption becomes. In general, Fb  

decreases with temperature, and Fn  approaches unit at high temperatures. 

Freundlich isotherm may be adopted for energetically heterogeneous surfaces. 

However, it is generally valid only in a narrow range of pressure, since it does not exhibit a 

proper linear behaviour at low pressures and a finite limit for sufficiently high pressures. 

To overcome the restriction of continuous increase in the concentration of adsorbed

molecules, an empirical extension of the Freundlich equation, frequently called Langmuir-

Freundlich isotherm, was proposed by Sips (1948):

where LFb  is the adsorption affinity constant, and LFn  characterises the surface 

heterogeneity. This last parameter is usually greater than unity, and the larger is its value 

the more heterogeneous the system is.  

The temperature dependence of the Langmuir-Freundlich parameters may be 

expressed as follows:

empirical relation:

Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm combines features of both Langmuir and Freundlich 

models. Nonetheless, this isotherm still does not follow the expected linear behaviour at

where Tb  and t  are the Toth isotherm parameters. When 1=t , equation (III.59) reduces to 

the Langmuir equation. Similarly to the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm, this parameter 

characterizes the system heterogeneity. The temperature dependence of Tb  and satq  may be 

equivalent to those of the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm (please see equations (III.55) and 

(III.56)).  Concerning parameter t , the following empirical relation may be assumed: 

( )TTtt /1 oToi ??+=  (III.60)

where ot  is the parameter t  at a reference temperature oT , and T?  is a constant.  

Similarly to the above discussed isotherms, also the Toth equation may be extended 

to multicomponent adsorption systems. A number of different approaches have been 

proposed in the literature for its multicomponent form, as, for instance, (i) that given by 

Jaroniec (1984).

the single component isotherms, is used. It is calculated from the single component 

isotherms as:

being iy  the gas molar fraction of i . The saturation capacities of different species in the 

extended Toth isotherm should also be the same in order to meet the thermodynamic 

consistency (Lamia et al., 2009).  

The ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory is an alternative approach to describe 

multicomponent adsorption equilibrium, in which the adsorbate mixture is treated as a two-

dimensional solution in equilibrium with a gas phase. Several versions of the IAS theory 

have been proposed, such as the Myers and Prausnitz (1965) theory or the LeVan and 

Vermeulen (1981) approach for binary systems. This theory is thermodynamically 

consistent and provides an effective technique for estimating the adsorption equilibrium of 

a gaseous mixture, using uniquely the adsorption isotherms of the pure components.  

The IAS theory of Myers and Prausnitz adopts the fundamental thermodynamic 

equations for liquids to the adsorbed phase. Accordingly, the general equilibrium 

relationship between gaseous and adsorbed phases may be expressed by an equation 

analogous to Raoult’s law for vapour-liquid equilibria:  

( )?= oiii P?Py , for N1,2,...,1 =  
 

(III.65) 

where iy  and i?  are the molar fractions of component i  in the fluid and adsorbed phases, 

respectively, P  is the total pressure and oiP  is the hypothetical pressure of the pure 

component i  that gives the same spreading pressure, ? , as the adsorbed mixture. The 

physical meaning of spreading pressure is analogous to that of a monomolecular film at the 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 47 

gas-liquid interface. Thus ?  defines the lowering of the surface tension at the solid-gas 

interface upon adsorption (Yang, 1987). The spreading pressure may be calculated by the 

Gibbs adsorption isotherm:

The previous set of equations can not be solved analytically. In addition, although 

being widely considered as a simple and convenient tool to calculate multicomponent 

adsorption equilibria, the predictability of IAS theory is limited, which may be primarily 

due to the assumption of treating the adsorbed phase as one thermodynamic entity.   

Different adsorption models may be found in literature to successfully describe 

single and binary sorption in zeolites. Barrer (1978) pointed out that the widely adopted 

Langmuir isotherm is usually suitable for zeolites, due to compensation effects, even for 

more heterogeneous systems. The dual-site Langmuir (DSL) model has also been used to 

describe isotherms that deviate from the conventional Langmuir behaviour, being 

especially suitable for fitting the equilibrium data of branched alkanes on silicalite-1 (Zhu 

et al., 2000). DSL isotherms have been adopted in modelling permeation of single 

component and binary mixtures through zeolite membranes, when two different adsorption 

sites are distinguished (Krishna et al., 1998; Krishna and Paschek, 2000; Krishna and Baur, 

2003; Krishna et al., 2004; Gavalas, 2008).  

Abdul-Rehman et al. (1990) modelled pure and multicomponent equilibrium data for 

the adsorption of the first four n-alkanes on Linde S-115 silicalite using different isotherms 

explicit in partial pressure, namely the loading ratio correlation (Yon and Turnock, 1971), 

Toth isotherm (Jaroniec, 1984), Mathews and Weber (1980) isotherm, and the statistical 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 48 

thermodynamic isotherm of Ruthven (1984). The extended Langmuir equation was found 

to describe the adsorption of ethane, methane, and ethane/methane mixture in silicalite-1, 

even though the saturation capacities of the single components were different. For 

propane/methane mixtures some deviations were found upon predicting mixture adsorption 

with the extended Langmuir equation, being the Toth isotherm the most adequate. Since in 

this case there were no kinks or steps in the mixture adsorption isotherms, which would be 

the case if surface heterogeneity would play a role, the extended Langmuir equation was 

considered a good approximation. According to the authors, the Toth model gives the best 

description for the adsorption of the first four alkanes in silicalite-1, for single components 

and some binary mixtures. 

Rees et al. (1991) established a comparison between the Langmuir and the 

Langmuir-Freundlich models for the description of pure nitrogen, methane, and carbon 

dioxide in silicalite-1. The IAS theory with the Langmuir model for the pure component 

isotherms was used to describe the binary adsorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. A 

good description was found for the total concentration of adsorbed molecules, though the 

IAS predictions for the separation factor deviated significantly from the experimental 

results. A consistent description of the equilibrium adsorption was given by the Nitta 

model.  

Buss and Heuchel (1997) describe the adsorption of binary mixtures of methane and 

tetrafluormethane in silicalite-1 using both the IAS theory, with Toth isotherm for the pure 

components, and the binary model of Nitta. Both models were found to provide a good 

description of the experimental data. The good results obtained were attributed to the high 

surface homogeneity as well as to the channel-like pore geometry of silicalite, where 

interactions between the adsorbate molecules can only occur to a small extent.  

Seidel and Carl (1989) used the Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Toth, and 

Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms for diffusion of phenol and indole from aqueous solution 

in activated carbon. The known simple relationship between surface diffusivity and 

adsorption energy proposed by Gilliland et al. (1974) were related to the isotherm on an 

energetically heterogeneous surface. The loading concentration dependence of surface 

diffusivity was calculated for each isotherm equation. The authors concluded that 



Gas Transport and Adsorption in Porous Media 

 49 

isotherms do have a great influence on kinetics. This point is particularly emphasized in 

this thesis, as it will be discussed in section VI.1.   

Li et al. (2007) tested the capability of the Maxwell-Stefan formulation to predict 

permeation fluxes of CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, and N2/CH4 mixtures across a SAPO-34 

membrane using only data of pure-component adsorption isotherms and diffusivities. The 

authors concluded that for adsorption of pure gases in zeolite structures with cages 

separated by narrow windows, such as SAPO-34, the model based on statistical 

thermodynamics described by Ruthven (1984) may be particularly relevant. The mixture 

thermodynamics was estimated using the IAS theory of Myers and Prausnitz (1965).

IV. Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous 
Titanosilicates 

 

This chapter focuses the modelling of ion exchange in microporous titanosilicates based on 

the Maxwell-Stefan equations. First, a brief overview of the more classical kinetic models 

will be presented. Then, a more detailed description around the Nernst-Planck equations 

will be given. Finally, a detailed model based on the Maxwell-Stefan formulation will be 

developed to describe a batch ion exchange in microporous materials. The model equations 

will be solved numerically in order to fit and predict experimental data from literature. The 

cases studied to validate the proposed model consist in mercury (II) and cadmium (II) 

removal from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate. The capability of 

the proposed model to describe experimental data and its predictive capacity will be 

compared with those of the Nernst-Planck model, given its sound theoretical fundaments. 

To conclude, results obtained with the more frequently applied pseudo first- and pseudo 

second-order kinetic equations will be presented as well.  

 

1. Introduction 

Toxic metals are well known by their toxicology and tendency to accumulate in the living 

organisms and aquatic systems, causing serious diseases and disorders. They are mainly 

discharged into the aquatic system as industrial wastewaters, mainly from metal finishing, 

welding, alloy manufacturing plants, pulp industries and petroleum refining, endangering 

soil and water quality (Inglezakis et al., 2002). Mercury and cadmium are two of the most 



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates 

 52 

toxic non-essential metals present in the environment, even at low concentrations, and their 

persistence in the aquatic systems encourages the development of techniques to remove 

them. Ion exchange is probably one of the most attractive processes, being commonly used 

in industry because of its simple and efficient application. This technique is effective to 

remove even traces from solutions and is particularly useful for treating large volumes of 

dilute solutions (Dabrowski et al., 2004). Natural and synthetic zeolites are gaining 

considerable interest as ion-exchangers because of their high selectivity and capacity 

(Biskup and Subotic, 2004; Ahmed et al., 2006; Trgo et al., 2006a). A number of 

titanosilicates have recently been used as ion exchangers for toxic metals removal. For 

instance, ETS-10 has been shown to have high selectivity for several toxic metals such as 

Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ (Choi et al., 2006; Lv et al., 2007; Camarinha et al., 

2009) and some radiocations (Pavel et al., 2003). Moreover, Bortun et al. (1997) evaluated 

framework and layered titanosilicates for cesium and strontium uptake from contaminated 

groundwater and wastewater; Decaillon et al. (2002) studied the ion exchange selectivity 

of layered titanosilicate AM-4 toward strontium; Koudsi and Dyer (2001) studied a 

synthetic titanosilicate analog of the mineral penkvilsite-2O, i.e. AM-3, for removal of 

Cobalt-60; and Lopes et al. (2007,2009) evaluated the potential of synthetic microporous 

(ETS-4, ETS-10, and AM-2) and layered (AM-4) titanosilicates for decontamination of 

natural waters polluted with low mercury levels. These results induced us to develop in this 

thesis a Maxwell-Stefan formulation for the ion exchange fluxes in microporous 

titanosilicates. 

As stated in Chapter II, microporous titanosilicates are crystalline solids with a well 

defined structure formed by a three-dimensional combination of tetrahedral and octahedral 

building blocks. Each TiO6 octahedron in the titanosilicate global structure carries a -2 

charge, which can be neutralized by extra-framework cations (usually Na+ and K+). These 

compensation species, as well as water molecules or other adsorbed molecules, are located 

in the channels of the structure and can be replaced by others (e.g., Hg2+ and Cd2+). The 

framework anionic sites are typically divalent, which should be particularly useful for the 

exchange of divalent ions.  

Modelling and simulation are useful tools to study and design a chemical plant. It is 

fundamental to be able to predict the dynamic behaviour of any unit, optimize their 



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates 

 53 

operating conditions, and scale up from laboratory to large scale. Such goals may be 

accomplished by computer simulation in order to reduce the number of indispensable 

experiments. The validity of a model is not only the result of a good fitting but also its 

ability to predict the behaviour of a process under operating conditions apart from those 

used to obtain its parameters. Such principle guided the development of our model. 

 

2. Classical Models 

The kinetic performance of an ion exchange process is frequently interpreted by 

semiempirical pseudo first- and second-order equations (Namasivayam and Senthilkumar, 

1998; Ho and McKay, 1999a,b; Reddad et al., 2002; Chiron et al., 2003; Yardim et al., 

2003; Aksu, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Lopes et al., 2007; Lopes et al., 2009)). However, 

such models have no theoretical background, which limits their application and 

extrapolation 

Mass transport in dilute ionic systems can be effectively described by the Nernst-

Planck (NP) equations (Smith and Dranoff, 1964; Chanda and Rempel, 1995; Dolgonosov 

et al., 1995; Patzay, 1995; Rodriguez et al., 1998; Samson and Marchand, 1999; Varshney 

and Pandith, 1999; Rodriguez et al., 2002; Varshney et al., 2003; Valverde et al., 

2004,2005; Cincotti et al., 2006). In an electrolyte solution, the electrical field induced by 

the different mobility of counter ions produces an additional force responsible for the 

transference of ions. The Nernst-Planck Equations account for both concentration and 

electric potential gradients. However, according to this model, the interdiffusion 

coefficients of counter ions are composition-dependent and the ionic interactions (ion-ion, 

ion-solvent, and ion-ion exchanger) are lumped into effective diffusivities (Helfferich, 

1995). Furthermore, Nernst-Planck does not take non-ideality effects and the pressure 

gradient into account (Helfferich, 1995; Wesselingh et al., 1995).  

Some authors represent experimental data with analytical models devised specifically 

for particle diffusion control or film diffusion control under well defined conditions, as for 

instance infinite solution volume or constant diffusion rate and radial diffusion coefficient. 



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates 

 54 

However, such conditions generally never hold in practice (Liberti et al., 1978; Helfferich, 

1995; Trgo et al., 2006a,b). For this reason, such models will be not included in this study. 

 

2.1 Pseudo-first order model 

The pseudo-first order rate equation of Lagergren (1898) is one of the most widely used 

kinetic models to express the ion exchange mechanism. The Lagergren equation was the 

first rate equation for sorption of liquid/solid system based on the solid capacity. It may be 

represented by: 

( )qqk
dt
dq

?= e1  (IV.1)

where 1k  is the rate constant of the first order sorption, eq  is the sorbed solute 

concentration at equilibrium, and q  is the concentration at any time t . Integrating 

equation (IV.1) for 0=t  to tt = , and 0=q  to qq = , and rearranging to get a linear form, 

one obtains:    

( ) ( ) ktqqq ?=? ee lnln  (IV.2)

In order to fit equation (IV.2) to experimental data, the equilibrium sorption capacity, eq , 

must be known. The constant 1k  can be determined by plotting ( )qq ?eln  versus t . The 

parameter ( )eln q  is expected to be equal to the intercept of the ( )qq ?eln  vs t  
representation; however, this is often not the case. 

 

2.2 Pseudo-second order model 

The pseudo-second order rate equation is also based on the sorption capacity of the solid 

and can be written as: 



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates 

 55 

( )2e2 qqkdt
dq

?=  (IV.3)

where  2k  is the rate constant of the second order sorption. Integrating equation (IV.3) for 

the previous boundary conditions, and rearranging in a linear form, it can be expressed as: 

t
qqkq

t

e
2
e2

In this case, 2k  can be determined by plotting qt  versus t . 

 

2.3 Nernst-Planck based model 

Ion exchange is a stoichiometric process in which an ion from a solution is replaced by an 

equivalent amount, in terms of electrical charges, of another ionic species from a solid 

phase. This process may be represented by conventional chemical equilibrium between two 

counter ions (Helfferich, 1995). For the case where the zeolite is initially in B form and the 

counter ion in solution is A, the reaction is: 

BAAB z
A

z
B

z
B

z
A BzAzAzBz +?+  (IV.5)

where Az  and Bz  are the electrochemical valences, and the upper bars identify the solid 

phase.  

An electric field in an electrolyte solution, caused by the different mobilities of 

counter ions, produces an additional force responsible for the transference of ions. In 

contrast to the classical Fick’s law, the Nernst-Planck model does account for the influence 

of this electric field. Hence, the flux of each counter ion in dilute ionic solutions may be 

described by the Nernst-Planck equations (Helfferich, 1995):

ABD  depends on AD , BD , and on the ionic concentration of the zeolite, which varies in the

3. Maxwell-Stefan Formulation 

An alternative approach to describe an ion exchange process deals with the application of 

the Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations, due to their well documented advantages in mass 

transport (Krishna, 1990,1993; Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997) (see detailed description in 

Chapter III). However, in the case of porous structures, such formulation has been 

essentially applied to non-ionic systems, particularly in gas phase (van de Graaf et al., 

1999; Kapteijn et al., 2000a). In the last years, some papers concentrate on the application 

of MS theory to mass transfer in membrane electrolysis process (e.g., van der Stegen 

(1999) and Hogendoorn et al. (2001)) and electrodialysis (Kraaijeveld et al., 1995). The 

MS equations do take into account and distinguish both ion-ion and ion-solid interactions, 

and they have been proved to be more effective in predicting ion exchange than the above 

mentioned Nernst-Planck relationships (Graham and Dranoff, 1982a,b; Pinto and Graham, 

1987; Wesselingh et al., 1995). Furthermore, under the scope of MS formalism, one 

diffusivity coefficient is defined for each pair of components, being dependent on their 

properties only. In addition, these coefficients are only weakly dependent on composition. 

 

3.1 Maxwell-Stefan based model 

In this section, the intraparticle resistance to ion exchange in microporous materials is 

described using the generalized MS equations (e.g., Krishna and Wesselingh (1997)) 

subjected to the following assumptions: i) Surface diffusion is the only transport 

mechanism, since due to the very small pore diameters ions never escape from the force 

field of the matrix co-ions, mainly due to the strong and long range nature of the 

electrostatic interactions. ii) The solid matrix is considered to be a uniform distribution of 

fixed ionic charges corresponding to the ( )1+n th component, through which counter ions 
diffuse. Therefore, 01 =+nu , as in the well known Dusty Gas Model (Jackson, 1977; 

Krishna and Wesselingh, 1997), already described in Chapter III.   

Considering the abovementioned assumptions, the MS transport equation for species 

i  in multicomponent ionic systems is:

Equations (IV.18) and (IV.22) may be combined to eliminate ??  from the generalized MS

described by the following set of equations: 

i) 1?n  Maxwell-Stefan equations for components 1 to 1?n  [equation (IV.18)];  

ii) One reference condition (bootstrap relation):

In the particular case of this study, there are three components with interest: counter 

ions Hg2+ or Cd2+ and Na+, and the solid particle (i.e., fixed charges); solution co-ions are 

neglected due to Donnan effect. Hence, the equations available are: one MS equation 

(equation (IV.18)), the bootstrap relation (equation (IV.23)), and the no current restriction 

(equation (IV.22)). Furthermore, the electrostatic potential gradient obtained from

3.2 Material balances, initial and boundary conditions, and equilibrium isotherms 

The models developed to describe batch ion exchange embody the following hypothesis: i) 

there exist film and intraparticle mass transfer resistances; ii) spherical solid particles; iii) 

perfectly stirred tank; iv) isothermal operation; v) liquid and solid volume changes are 

neglected; (vi) co-ions are excluded from the zeolite particles (Donnan exclusion); (vii) 

effect of competitive ions (e.g. H+) is neglected and (viii) ideal solution. Concerning 

diffusing components, A  is the pollutant to remove from solution, Hg2+ or Cd2+, using the 

ion-exchanger (ETS-4) initially in B – form (Na+).

where fk  is the convective mass transfer coefficient, and A  is the external particle surface 

area. For well established agitated systems, it is possible to estimate fk  using correlations 

which depend generally on the Reynolds, Schmidt and Power numbers,  and on 

geometrical parameters such as the ratio of impeller to tank diameter, the specific geometry 

of the impeller, and the geometry of baffling, if any, used to inhibit vortex formation in the 

vessel. Several correlations and more references may be found elsewhere (Treybal, 1981; 

Misic et al., 1982; Kulov et al., 1983; Miller et al., 1984; Slater, 1991).  

The correlation of Armenante and Kirwan (1989) may be used to estimate the 

convective mass transfer coefficient, at least to predict its order of magnitude, due to its 

simplicity and because it was specifically derived for microparticles in agitated systems:

the Schmidt number. This equation is frequently applied to fix fk  in the model equations 

or, alternatively, to estimate fk  and compare it with the optimized value from 

experimental data (Fernandez and Carta, 1996; Bhattacharya, 2007).  

 

Equilibrium Isotherms 

In order to describe the system behavior, both kinetics and adsorption equilibrium have to 

be simultaneously taken into account. The equilibrium between bulk solution and ion-

exchanger were evaluated in this work using the Freundlich isotherm, given the good 

equilibrium representation achieved. Freundlich isotherm can be represented by:

Here, FK  and Fn  are temperature-dependent parameters; Fn  usually lies in the range of 1 

to 5, and the larger this constant is, the more nonlinear sorption becomes. In general,  FK  

decreases with temperature, and Fn  approaches unit at high temperatures (Do, 1998).   

 

3.3 Solution approach: numerical methods used 

The simultaneous solution of the set of differential and algebraic equations listed above 

gives the concentration of counter ions in the fluid, and their concentration profiles in the 

solid phase as function of position and time. The model has been solved numerically using 

the Method of Lines (Schiesser, 1991) and integrated by the finite-difference approach. For 

that purpose, a program in Matlab has been written to solve the resulting Ordinary 

Differential Equations (ODEs) with 101 grid points and finite-difference approach with 

central differences of second order; forward and backward differences formulas were 

adopted for the first and last nodes, respectively. The average loading per unit particle 

volume (equation (IV.28)) is numerically evaluated using the 1/3 Simpson’s Rule. Ode15s 

has been used to integrate this set of ODEs of the initial-value type. 

The self-diffusion coefficients and the convective mass transfer coefficient are the 

model parameters to fit to the experimental data. Accordingly, a first optimization step was 

performed based on the ‘elimination of linear parameters in nonlinear regression’ 

technique due to Lawton and Sylvestre (1971). With this procedure, a reduction of the 

number of parameters that must be estimated by the iterative procedure is achieved, as well 

as faster convergence attained. Finally, an enhancing optimization involving all parameters 

simultaneously was performed, where the results previously obtained from the above 

mentioned technique were taken as reliable initial guesses.  

 

3.4 Data used to validate MS based model 

The validity of the proposed model was examined using experimental data measured in the 

University of Aveiro, concerning batch experiments where mercury (II) and cadmium (II) 

ions are removed from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate (Ferreira 



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates

et al., 2009; Lopes et al., 2009). Totally, eight experiments are considered, corresponding 

to the conditions listed in Table IV.1 and Table IV.2. In those works the bulk concentration 

of Hg2+ and Cd2+ has been measured along time. Table IV.3 compiles relevant physical 

properties of ETS-4 particles used in the experiments.

4. Discussion 

Results obtained with the MS based model proposed in this work are shown in Figures 

IV.1 and IV.2, plotted in 0)( AA CtC  versus time and ( )tqA  versus time forms, along with 
experimental data. Table IV.4 displays the calculated parameters, namely MS diffusivities 

and film mass transfer coefficient optimized, and the average absolute relative deviations 

( )AARD  found. The figures point out the good agreement between model results and 
experiments of Tables IV.1 and IV.2, confirmed by the low deviations found, 

%49.5=AARD  and %41.6=AARD , respectively, which are well inside the experimental 

accuracy reported (5-8%). The accurate correlation accomplished in the transition from 

steep descent to horizontal branch is noteworthy in both cases, once in liquid-solid sorbent 

processes the elbow of the kinetic curves is frequently most difficult to fit.  

The diffusion coefficients fitted (Table IV.4) are in the order of 1820 1010 ?? ?  m2s-1, 

which are consistent with both the small pore diameters of ETS-4 (0.3-0.4 nm), and the 

strong and long range nature of the electrostatic interactions, following other values in 

literature. For instance, Barrer and Rees (1960) reported self-diffusion coefficients of 

1.14×10-17, 1.96×10-21, and 8.27×10-26 m2s-1 for Na+, K+ and Rb+ in analcite, repectively; 

apparent diffusion coefficients of 17108.1 ?×  and 18100.8 ?×  m2s-1 were obtained by Coker 

and Rees (2005) for Ca2+ and Mg2+ in semi-crystalline zeolite Na-A, respectively; Brooke 

and Rees (1969) reported interdiffusion diffusivities in the range of 1918 1010 ?? ?  m2s-1 for 

the system Na+/K+ in shabazite; and Coker and Rees (1992) reported interdiffusion 

coefficients of 181000.2 ?×  and 181053.6 ?×  m2s-1 for Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/Mg2+ in 

beryllophosphate. Ahmed et al. (2006) published an estimated Cd2+ apparent diffusion 

coefficient of 231084.2 ?× m2s-1 in CaX zeolite, based on an intraparticle diffusion model 

neglecting external diffusion resistances. However, the simulation achieved with such 

coefficient was comparatively poor relatively to that obtained by simply fitting a first-order 

kinetic model to the experimental data.

The MS diffusivities of the pairs Hg2+/fixed ionic charges and Cd2+/fixed ionic 

charges (i.e., AsÐ ) are very close, which could evidence the interaction between each ion 

and titanosilicate fixed ionic charges is similar. Concerning the Na+/fixed ionic charges 

pair, the MS diffusivities ( BsÐ ) obtained for both Hg
2+ and Cd2+ systems are expected to be 

the same, given the binary nature of those coefficients; however, they were shown to differ

by one order of magnitude. Such discrepancy could be ascribed to some model 

assumptions which could be not entirely suitable. For instance, the effect of competition 

between H+ and Hg2+ or Cd2+ towards titanosilicate sorption sites at low pH has not been 

taken into account. Moreover, a relative inaccuracy associated with determination of such 

coefficients is frequently found in literature. For instance, Gebremedhin-Haile et al.  

(2003) published data for diffusion coefficients of Hg2+ in natural and modified zeolites, 

with an associated error of the same magnitude.

The convective mass transfer coefficient fitted were 4.81×10-3 and 1.28×10-3 ms?1, 

while those predicted by Armenante and Kirwan correlation were 2.90×10?3 and 2.20×10?3 

ms?1, for mercury and cadmium uptake calculations, respectively. This is a reliable result 

since some parameters used in the correlation were not entirely appropriate for the specific 

experimental set-up, namely, the power was approximately calculated, and the size of 

ETS-4 particles ( 6p 107.0
?×=d m) is one order of magnitude lower than the inferior limit 

studied by Armenante and Kirwan (range of ( ) 6p 104206 ?×?=d m). 

In Figure IV.3 the normalized concentration of mercury (II) in ETS-4 is graphed as 

function of time and radial position, for Experiment 2 of Table IV.1. Similar behaviour is 

found for the remaining experiments. This plot confirms expected trends, nonetheless it is 

interesting to detach the time evolution of normalized concentration at surface, 

( ) eqAA qRrtq ,; = . As Figure IV.3 illustrates, initial sudden rise of surface concentration is 

so pronounced that it goes through a maximum and than decreases gradually until 

equilibrium is reached. Inside particle, far from surface, monotonous behaviour is found

suddenly from ( ) 0,0 === ? RrtqA  to ( ) ( )0,0 AAA CqRrtq === + , which is the 
concentration in equilibrium with bulk solution. Then, for 0&gt;t , ( )RrtqA =,  would

Figure IV.3 illustrates such behaviour, but the existence of external diffusion smoothes the

The predictive capability of the model proposed in this chapter has been also 

analyzed. With that purpose, the parameters involved ( AsÐ , BsÐ , ABÐ , fk ) were optimized 

using one set of experimental data independently (namely, Exp.4 and Exp.7, for mercury 

and cadmium experiments, respectively). Afterwards the remaining curves were predicted 

with those parameters. The results obtained may be found in Table IV.5, and demonstrate 

the model is able to predict ion exchange behaviour for different experimental conditions. 

Please verify the moderate increments of the AARDs when we go from correlation to 

prediction: %29.621.6 ?=AARD  and %96.670.6 ?=AARD , for Hg2+ and Cd2+ 

removal data, respectively. Figure IV.4 shows the theoretical curves provided by our

model: full lines correspond to the base case of global correlation, whereas dashed lines are 

predictions obtained according to this procedure. As may be observed, fitted and predicted 

curves are very close, being almost superimposed for the Hg2+ system, so corroborating 

fine prediction potential.

In Figure IV.5, a comparison between results obtained with MS and NP based 

models, plotted in 0)( AA CtC  versus time form, is established. Table IV.6 compiles the 

calculated values involved, namely NP self-diffusion coefficients, the mass transfer 

coefficient, and average absolute deviations (AARD) found. Figure IV.5 clearly points out 

the similar fitting capability both models exhibit to represent experimental data, which can 

be confirmed by the similar deviations found.

physical meaning: MS diffusivities characterize the interaction between each pair of 

species in the mixture, including the solid fixed ionic charges, whereas NP self diffusion 

coefficients represent the mobility with which counter ions diffuse in the ion-exchanger. 

Moreover, the calculated convective mass transfer coefficients are almost the same, i.e., 

4.808×10-3 m.s-1 and 4.791×10-3 m.s-1, for Hg2+ removal experiments, and 1.263×10-3 m.s-1 

and 1.286×10-3 m.s-1, for Cd2+ experiments, respectively. This fact emphasizes the good 

modelling results achieved.

The predictive capability of both models may be also compared in Figure IV.7, 

where the MS and NP simulations of three sets of experiments obtained with parameters 

optimized from a distinct fourth experiment are graphed. It is possible to conclude that 

both models perform similarly, as NP and MS predicted curves practically overlap. The 

AARDs of correlations and predictions are compiled in Table IV.5, and evidence both 

models offer good predictions with modest global deviations increments over those 

corresponding to correlation: %29.621.6 ?=MSAARD  and %13.608.6 ?=NPAARD , 

for Hg2+ experiments, and %96.670.6 ?=MSAARD  and %86.679.6 ?=NPAARD , for 

Cd2+ experiments. With respect to the individual AADs  (for each experiment), they are

results are still slightly better. In the whole, under the conditions investigated, both 

approaches can be applied successfully to describe intraparticle ionic transport. Such 

reliable performance must rely on the sound physical principles of the Maxwell-Stefan 

approach and on the theoretically fundamentals of the NP equations for dilute systems. 

 

 

  

Figure IV.6 – Comparison of the prediction ability of the proposed MS based model with 
the NP model for: (a) Hg2+ removal and (b) Cd2+ removal. Full and dashed lines are 
predictions with parameters independently fitted to one set of experimental data alone with 
MS and NP based models, respectively. Experimental conditions: same as Figure IV.1. 

 

Experimental data were also analyzed according to pseudo first- and pseudo second-

order models, for comparison. Table IV.7 compiles the deviations found with MS based 

model, NP based model, pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order models. With respect 

to the pseudo first- and second-order equations, results show they provide poor 

representations of the fluid concentration ( %73.21511.12 ?=AARDs ) although they 

continue to be frequently used in this field, certainly because of their simplicity. 

Figures IV.7 and IV.8 illustrate the distribution of the calculated deviations, for each 

model, over the normalized concentration of mercury and cadmium ions, respectively. A 

superiority of Maxwell-Stefan and Nernst-Planck based models over pseudo first- and 

pseudo second-order models to describe experimental data is clearly notorious, mainly 

over the pseudo first-order model.

These plots show that the deviations corresponding to the Maxwell-Stefan and 

Nernst-Planck models are more uniformly distributed along the predicted concentration 

range. Moreover, the similarity between both models can be confirmed once again. On the 

other hand, deviations found for the second order model are particularly pronounced in the 

range of lower predicted concentration, which are considerably lower than the 

experimental ones. The magnitude of the first-order model deviations is significantly 

higher along the entire range of concentrations (please note the y-axis scale of Figure 

IV.8c, particularly the onset of the figure), being those concentrations systematically 

underestimated.

Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates

5. Final remarks  

In this chapter a model based on the Maxwell-Stefan formulation has been developed to 

describe ion exchange in microporous materials. The MS approach has been adopted due 

to their well documented advantages over Nernst-Planck relationships, particularly because 

it takes account of ion-ion and ion-solid. The model accounts for external (film) and 

intraparticle diffusion control; their parameters are the MS diffusivities of each pair of 

species (counter ions and fixed charges of the particle) and the film mass transfer 

coefficient. 

The model was validated with batch experiments on mercury (II) and cadmium (II) 

removal from aqueous solution using ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate (pore diameters 

between 0.3-0.4 nm). In this case the relevant species are Hg2+ or Cd2+ and Na+ (initially in 

solution and in ETS-4, respectively), and titanosilicate ionic fixed charges. Results 

obtained provide good representations of metal ions concentration in solution and solid 

phase along time. Even the transition from the steep descent to the horizontal branch of 

0AA CC  versus time curve is well represented, precisely where kinetic curves are most 

difficult to fit.  

The predicting ability of the MS based model was analyzed, being possible to 

conclude it exhibits good predictive capacity. In effect, good predictions are accomplished 

with parameters optimized from an independent set of data. Such performance may be 

attributed to the sound physical principles of Maxwell-Stefan theory. 

A comparison between Nernst-Planck and Maxwell-Stefan based models has been 

accomplished. The results obtained reveal that both models provide similar data 

representation, as well as fine predictive capability. The advantageous of the Maxwell-

Stefan description, which arise particularly from taking into account ion-ion and ion-solid 

interactions, are not distinguished in this comparison. Such result can be ascribed to the 

experimental conditions used, namely dilute ionic solutions and binary exchange. 

Although, in principle, it is expected theoretically that these models will behave differently 

in concentrated solutions and in multicomponent systems; Nernst-Planck equations lump 

ionic interactions (ion-ion, ion-solvent, and ion-ion exchanger) into effective diffusivities 

and are not able to take non-ideality effects into account.  



Modelling Ion Exchange in Microporous Titanosilicates 

 76 

A research team at University of Aveiro is carrying out new experiments to study ion 

exchange in more concentrated solutions as well as competition effects with 

multicomponent mixtures and titanosilicates. Accordingly, it will be interesting to validate 

the performance of the proposed MS based model for simultaneous Hg2+ and Cd2+ ion 

exchange, and analyze its behaviour for concentrated solutions, where the Nernst-Planck 

model is expected to fail.

V. Experimental Section 
 

The study of membranes permeation properties is fundamental for their characterization. 

Membrane quality should be assessed by measuring permeances of individual gases as well 

as separation factors of mixtures.  

The permeation of certain molecules, at room temperature, can be used to detect 

rough defects in the membrane structure since over enhanced fluxes denunciate the 

presence of defects. The ideal selectivity, calculated as the ratio between the corresponding 

individual permeances, could give an idea of the membrane quality as well: ideal 

selectivities close to the Knudsen value (equal to the square root of molecular weighs ratio 

inverse) evidence meso-defects since in mesoporous systems Knudsen diffusion is the 

dominant transport mechanism. Moreover, the behaviour of permeation flux with 

temperature or pressure allows the discrimination between the different transport 

mechanisms involved and the subsequent detection of defects. Finally, the separation of 

real mixtures allows a real investigation of the membrane performance.   

In the present work, gases with different molecular dimensions were selected in order 

to study transport through the micropores. For that purpose, an experimental set-up was 

designed, assembled and tested to carry out permeation experiments with single gases and 

mixtures at fixed and programmed temperature, under several transmembrane pressure 

differences. This chapter describes in detail the experimental set-up and procedures 

adopted for the dynamic characterization of membranes.

1. Experimental set-up 

An experimental set-up was designed and assembled in order to carry out single gas 

permeation measurements as well as mixture separations. Figure V.1 shows some pictures 

of the experimental apparatus, which consists essentially of:  

(i) a stainless-steel membrane module (manufactured at the University of Aveiro) used 

to accommodate the membrane (see Figure V.1a);  

(ii) a tubular electric oven (manufactured at the University of Aveiro) coupled with a 

PID temperature controller (TC) (Eurotherm, Type 818) which allows the 

regulation of temperature and heating rate; a double thermocouple (Omega, Type 

K, CASS-IM15U-300-DUAL) is introduced inside the membrane and 

simultaneously connected to the temperature controller and to a data acquisition 

system (see Figure V.1c); 

(iii) three mass flow controllers (MFC) (ALicat, MC-500SCCM-D/5M) used to control 

the mass flow of feed and sweep gases (Figure V.1b);  

(iv) a mass flow meter (MFM) (ALicat, M-500SCCM-D) used to measure the permeate 

flow (see Figure V.1b);  

(v) a back pressure regulator (BPR) (ALicat, PC-100PSIG-D/5P) used to measure and 

regulate the pressure at the retentate side, controlling in this way the 

transmembrane pressure difference (see Figure V.1b);  

(vi) a pressure transducer (PT) (ALicat, P-100PSIG-D), placed before the MFM, to 

measure the permeate pressure (see Figure V.1b); 

(vii) 16 electric solenoid valves (V1–V16) (Mega Control) to open and close the gas 

lines of the experimental set-up; gases are fed to the system and flow through the 

set-up in 1/4” and 1/8” stainless-steel and polypropylene tubing (see Figure V.1b);  

(viii) a gas detector (GD) (Oldham MX 2100), essential to detect any gas leakage when 

inflammable or toxic gases are studied. In this case, a fan is also used to support 

efficient ventilation near the equipments (see Figure V.1c).

(TCD), equipped with two separation capillary columns: a ValcoPLOT Molesieve 

0.5×30 5A column for permanent gases, and a ValcoPLOT HayeSep D 0.5×30 

column for CO2 separation (see Figure V.1d).

A graphical interface was developed using the LabVIEW software (National 

Instruments) in order to exchange information with the experimental set-up, i.e., to 

send/get information to/from the several set-up components. The RS-485 communication 

protocol was used for that purpose. Figures V.2 and V.3 show the LabVIEW user interface 

windows developed in this work.

With this interface, solenoid valves can be opened or closed and the feed flow (and 

composition in the case of binary mixtures) and retentate pressure can be regulated. The 

gas to be tested is selected also acting directly from PC by opening the corresponding 

valves (see Figure V.3). The temperature and heating rate, on the other hand, can be only 

adjusted on the temperature controller. Feed and permeate flow rates, retentate and 

permeate pressures, and temperature are continually recorded and displayed in the 

computer during experiments; the evolution of such parameters is also shown in a 

graphical form (see Figure V.3). All data measured can be collected at the end of the runs 

and saved into a spreadsheet file.  

 

Calibrations 

In order to control the operating conditions directly from the computer, all the measuring 

devices had to be previously calibrated. Concerning the mass flow controllers and mass 

flow meter, a distinct calibration was carried out for each gas. For that purpose, fixed flow 

rates were imposed directly on the MFCs display, where the studied gas was previously 

selected, and the corresponding voltage was registered by the LabVIEW software. This 

procedure was repeated for different flow rates covering all the operating range of the 

equipments. The MFM was calibrated after connecting the feed stream directly to the 

MFM, by fixing several flow rates of each gas directly on a MFC and reading the MFM 

voltage on the computer. The response signal of the pressure and temperature measuring 

devices is independent of the selected gas. Accordingly, BPR and PT calibrations were 

performed using only N2. The BPR was calibrated imposing several N2 flow rates on a 

MFC, and relating the pressure read on the BPR display with the voltage exhibited on the 

computer. A similar procedure was adopted for the PT, which was calibrated with respect 

to the BPR. Finally, the thermocouple was calibrated using the temperature controller as 

reference.  

Table IV.1 compiles the calibration equations for each instrument. As an example, 

calibration data of the MFM for several gases are shown in Figure V.4, together with the 

corresponding correlation lines.

Beyond the measuring devices, also the GC system had to be calibrated in order to 

get the streams composition from the obtained chromatograms. For that purpose, binary 

and ternary mixtures with different compositions, and including all the studied gases, were 

analyzed. The composition of each component was then related with the corresponding 

area of the chromatogram peaks. The chromatograms acquisition and their mathematical 

treatment were carried using the DataApex Clarity software for windows. 

Figure V.5 shows a chromatogram obtained for a binary CO2/N2 mixture, together 

with the resulting peak areas. A graphical representation for CO2 calibration data is 

pictured in Figure V.6 as an example to illustrate the calibration procedure. As shown in 

this figure, the resulting calibration equation and correlation factor are simultaneously 

provided. 

The calibrations for each gas were carried out three times in order to obtain 

reproducible and accurate results, which may be of special importance in the case of H2-

containing mixtures, given the similarity of H2 and He thermal conductivities, since He 

was used as carrier gas for the TCD.

2. Membranes 

In this work, nineteen microporous membranes were studied: nine of AM-3, and five of 

ETS-10. In addition, four ZSM-5 zeolite membranes and a last one of 4A- zeolite were 

also evaluated for comparison. All membranes were synthesized in the Associated 

Laboratory CICECO (Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro) by secondary 

growth procedure on commercial tubular ?-alumina (Inocermic) and stainless-steel (Mott 

Corporation) supports with different pore diameters. The ?-alumina supports were 

symmetric with internal and external diameters of approximately 7 and 10 mm, 

respectively, and were 8 cm long; porous stainless-steel supports had 8 and 10 mm of 

internal and external diameters, respectively, and were 3.5 – 4 cm long. In order to prevent 

by-pass of feed and permeate streams during the permeation measurements, alumina 

supports were subjected to enamelling at both ends, being their permeation length reduced 

to approximately 5.5 cm; 2 cm long non-porous stainless-steel tubes were soldered at the 

end of the stainless-steel porous supports for the same purpose.  

Membranes were synthesized with the crystalline layer on the outside of the tubular 

supports. However, a quantity of crystals could be expected to be formed inside the tubes

as well, since supports were not wrapped during membranes synthesis. Several samples 

were prepared varying the synthesis conditions (including time and number of synthesis).  

The structure and morphology of synthesized titanosilicate membranes have been 

previously investigated at CICECO by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, 

energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray mapping techniques. The main physical 

properties of membranes studied are compiled in Table V.2. Figure V.7 shows a stainless-

steel and an ?-alumina supported membranes together with a schematic representation of 

their structure.

Two methods are frequently used to create the driving force responsible for gas 

permeation: the pressure drop generation method and the Wicke-Kallenback (WK) method 

(Wicke and Kallenbach, 1941). In the first one, the driving force is created by generating a 

total pressure drop across the membrane, either by pressurizing the feed side or evacuating 

the permeate side. In the second method, a sweep gas is used (typically He or Ar) to wash 

the permeate chamber in order to decrease or vanish the partial pressure of the permeating 

species. In this case, the total pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane 

could be zero, eliminating the presence of viscous flow, being the partial pressure 

difference the driving force. Accordingly, the WK method imposes a composition gradient 

through the membrane by the flow of sweep gas in the permeate side. In addition, the 

turbulence created by the sweep gas helps desorption of adsorbed components. Both single 

gas permeation and mixture separation can be performed with this method. Nonetheless, 

sweep gas back-diffusion can occur and the new mixture, formed by permeate and sweep 

streams, has to be further separated for industrial purposes. This method is thus more 

advantageous for mixtures separation experiments, being that of the pressure difference the 

preferable method for single component permeation (Gump et al., 2000; Bernal, 2002).  

 

3.1 Single gas permeation 

Gases 

Single gas permeation experiments were performed with a transmembrane pressure drop 

providing the driving force, and no sweep gas was used. Nitrogen (Praxair, 99.995%), 

helium (Praxair, 99.999%), carbon dioxide (Praxair, 99.95%), hydrogen (Praxair, 

99.995%), and oxygen (Praxair, 99.999%) were the molecules used for single gas 

measurements. 

 

Membrane pre-treatment 

The presence of adsorbed compounds on the titanosilicate pores affects the permeation 

results. ETS-10 and AM-3 crystals are hydrophilic, and therefore water molecules from 

moisture are expected to be adsorbed on their structure. In order to remove the adsorbed 



Experimental Section 

 88 

water and eventually other compounds, a heating and cooling cycle had to be carried out 

up to ca. 200ºC. Single N2 permeance was measured at room temperature before and after 

this thermal treatment to evaluate the effect of adsorbed compounds upon the gas 

permeation. The experimental procedure followed for this purpose is described under the 

next item. During this heating treatment, a continuous He flow (20 cm3(PTN)/min) was 

kept through the membranes in order to facilitate the removal of the desorbed compounds.  

Membranes were not submitted to higher temperatures due to thermal resistance 

limitations of the o-rings used. In fact, at the beginning of the experiments, a membrane 

sealed with silicone o-rings was submitted to 300ºC; however, the o-rings melted and 

damaged the membrane. Subsequently, a material with a higher thermal resistance, and 

holding at the same time sufficient flexibility, was attempted to be found; viton o-rings 

were selected among a few number of options (service temperature around 200ºC).   

The heating and cooling cycle was repeated whenever a different gas was studied, 

and after changing membranes from the module (given their hydrophilic character). 

 

Measurement of nitrogen permeance at room temperature 

Dynamic characterization of new membranes should start by detecting the existence of 

rough defects or cracks by means of single gas permeation runs. Whenever detected, 

membrane preparation conditions will be adjusted until defects elimination. In this work, 

such characterization was accomplished by measuring permeation fluxes of pure N2 at 

room temperature. The arrangement of the experimental set-up used to carry out single gas 

permeation measurements, at fixed temperature and under different transmembrane 

pressure drops, is schematically represented in Figure V.9. 

The membrane was placed inside the stainless-steel module and sealed with viton o-

rings. Sweep gas and retentate sides were kept blocked during the experiments (dead-end 

mode) to promote total permeation of the gas through the membrane. The stainless-steel 

module containing the membrane was placed inside the oven at fixed temperature. The 

flow rate of feed gas was fixed by a MFC and fed to the titanosilicate side of the 

membrane. The permeate side was kept at atmospheric pressure while the transmembrane 



Experimental Section 

 89 

pressure drop was measured with the BPR after reaching equilibrium (stationary state). At 

this moment the permeate flow rate, measured by the MFM, should equal the feed gas flow 

rate, what was always verified. 

 

Figure V.9 – Layout of experimental apparatus for preliminary N2 permeance tests. 

 

During these experiments the temperature was kept at 25 ºC and different feed flow 

rates were imposed. Permeance was then obtained by the slope of the permeation flux 

versus transmembrane pressure difference curve (see equation (II.3)).  

 

Permeation of single gases at programmed temperature (PPT) 

A different test used to evaluate the membrane structure consists in the measurement of 

permeation fluxes of single gases at programmed temperature, with a fixed transmembrane 

pressure drop. From permeation versus temperature curves it is possible to characterize the 

transport mechanisms taking place at a given temperature and, subsequently, to detect 

defects in the crystalline structure of the membrane. The PPT experiments were reported 

for the first time by Bernal et al. (2002), being presented as a fast and reliable tool to 

investigate the characteristics of zeolite membranes. 



Experimental Section 

 90 

Figure V.10 shows the experimental set-up used to carry out PPT measurements. 

Gases with different molecular weights and diameters were studied, namely: N2, H2, He, 

CO2 and O2. 

 

 

Figure V.10 - Layout of experimental apparatus for permeation at programmed 
temperature of single gases. 

 

The feed gas stream, regulated by a MFC, was fed to the membrane module placed 

inside the oven, and a temperature ramp was programmed with a fixed heating rate of 1 

ºC/min. This value is generally sufficient to approach stationary state at each temperature, 

but not excessively small to delay the experiments; moreover, it is the smaller heating rate 

allowed by the temperature controller. The permeate side was kept at atmospheric pressure, 

while transmembrane pressure difference was controlled by the BPR. During these 

experiments the retentate side was no longer blocked. The values of the permeate flow 

measured by the MFM and temperature by the thermocouple were continually registered

 91 

along time by the data acquisition system. Experiments were conducted with different feed 

flows in the temperature range of 25 to 180ºC, for fixed transmembrane pressure drops 

between 20 and 500 kPa. Permeances were obtained by the ratio of permeation fluxes and 

transmembrane pressure difference (see equation (II.3)). 

 

Measurement of single gas permeances at fixed temperatures  

After discriminating the transport mechanisms, membranes with the desired microporous 

structure are distinguished. Some permeation fluxes of defect-free membranes of pure N2, 

H2, He, O2, and CO2 at fixed temperatures were measured for different transmembrane 

pressure drops to determine their permeances and corresponding ideal selectivities. The 

experimental procedure adopted was similar to that for measurement of pure N2 permeance 

at room temperature. However, the results obtained overlapped those from PPT 

experiments, and thus have been canceled. 

 

3.2 Mixture separation 

Even though single gas permeation and ideal selectivities are fundamental to evaluate 

membranes quality, its primary aim is the separation of mixtures. In this work, the 

capability of membranes to perform real separations was examined. Some binary mixtures 

were studied at different temperatures. The separation factors obtained were determined 

and compared with those of single gases.  

In order to quantify the separation of binary mixtures, an on-line gas chromatograph 

(GC) was included on the experimental set-up to analyze the streams composition. The 

arrangement of the experimental apparatus used to perform binary mixture separations is 

schematically represented in Figure V.11.  

 



Experimental Section 

 92 

 

Figure V.11 – Layout of experimental apparatus for mixtures separation. 

 

Similarly to single gas permeation experiments, the membrane was hold inside the 

module, with both ends sealed with viton o-rings, and placed inside the oven to keep the 

operation temperature at the desired value. The feed mixture was generated by mixing two 

pure component streams whose individual flow rates were regulated by two MFC’s. The 

retentate side was opened to carry out the separation. Both feed and permeate sides were 

kept at atmospheric pressure while a sweep gas was used to increase the driving force; the 

permeate partial pressure was manipulated by varying the sweep gas flow rate via the third 

MFC.  

After matching the stationary state, feed, retentate and permeate streams were 

analyzed by the GC. Two manual three-way valves placed on the permeate and retentate 

lines allow one to select the streams direction, i.e., toward the atmosphere or toward the 

GC. A two-position microvolume sample injection valve (VICI) permits the injection of a 

fixed gas volume to the GC columns. In the load position, the selected stream flows 

continually through the sample loop into the atmosphere, while the mobile phase (He) 

flows through to the column. In the injection position, the loop is in line with the column

and the mobile phase injects the content of the loop onto the first column (VP Hayesep D), 

where the CO2, whenever present, is retained. The CO2-free stream is subsequently fed to 

the second column (VP Molesieve), where the remaining permanent gases are separated. 

At this moment, a second two-position valve (VICI) is automatically actuated allowing 

CO2 to by-pass the second column. The separated components flow then to the TCD, 

where the mixture composition is determined. Each analysis was carried out three times.    

The permeance of each component and the corresponding separation factors were 

calculated by equations (II.2) and (II.4), respectively.

VI. Results and Discussion 
 

This chapter presents all experimental and modelling results obtained in this work. 

Concerning modelling, new expressions for Maxwell-Stefan thermodynamic factors were 

derived for pure and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth isotherms. Up 

till now, only relations for Langmuir and dual-site Langmuir have been published, what is 

a strong limitation since many adsorption systems exhibit distinct behaviours. As it will be 

shown it is possible to predict the permeation of binary mixtures through zeolite 

membranes, when equilibrium and diffusivities are known for pure gases.   

With respect to experimental results, the dynamic characterization of the 

microporous membranes is presented, namely: the permeation of single gases and binary 

mixtures in AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A membranes, at fixed and programmed 

temperature and for several transmembrane pressure drops. Modelling results based on the 

transport mechanisms described in Chapter III under the framework of the Maxwell-Stefan 

approach are also presented. 

 

1. New expressions for surface diffusion 

 
New Maxwell-Stefan (MS) thermodynamic factors. The use of different adsorption 

isotherms gives rise to different thermodynamic correction factors (Krishna and 

Wesselingh, 1997). When the MS equations are used to describe the permeation of gas 

mixtures through zeolite membranes, the multicomponent Langmuir isotherm is commonly

 96 

adopted by researchers, as firstly presented by Krishna (1990,1993). More recently, 

thermodynamic correction factors for the dual-site Langmuir model have been also 

considered (Krishna and Baur, 2003). However, it is clear from the literature that these two 

isotherms are not always the most appropriate to describe adsorption in zeolites. Therefore, 

in this work, new expressions for the thermodynamic factors have been developed and 

tested, specifically for the pure and multicomponent isotherms of Nitta, Langmuir-

Freundlich, and Toth, since they are frequently applicable to represent equilibrium in 

zeolites as well as in the design of several engineering applications. The results obtained 

have been compared with those provided by the Langmuir model. The new derived 

expressions are listed in Table VI.1 - equations (VI.1) to VI.7) – whereas the Langmuir 

equations are given in Chapter III - equations (III.18) and (III.45).

The calculation of the thermodynamic correction factors require differentiation of the 

isotherms explicitly written in terms of fugacity or partial pressure (equation (III.43)). 

While Nitta multicomponent isotherm (equation (III.52)) is given directly in terms of 

partial pressure, and the multicomponent Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms 

(equations (III.44) and (III.58)) are easily inverted, the multicomponent Toth isotherm 

(equations (III.61) - (III.63)) is not so straightforward because of the complexity 

introduced by exponent t . In order to overcome such limitation, the isotherm equation in 

fractional loading-form was differentiated with respect to the partial pressures and the 

inverse functions obtained following calculus relations. Hence, taking into account that 

( )jiii pp?? ,=  and ( )jijj pp?? ,= , the following system of differential equations is 
obtained:

Pure and multicomponent isotherms for methane/ethane/silicalite-1 systems. The 

validity of the new equations proposed in Table VI.1 was assessed using experimental data 

taken from literature for the separation of ethane/methane mixtures with a silicalite-1 

membrane (van de Graaf et al., 1999). The isotherms for both methane/silicalite-1 and 

ethane/silicalite-1 systems were obtained by fitting data reported by Zhu et al., (1998) 

whose values are listed in Tables VI.2 and VI.3 for 303, 338, and 373 K.

 In Table VI.4, the parameters for Langmuir, Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth 

isotherms are listed together with the corresponding absolute average relative deviations 

found ( )AARD . It is worth noting that our optimization involved simultaneously the 
experimental data for the three temperatures available, by taking into account the relations 

of Chapter III for the temperature dependence of the intrinsic parameters, i.e. equations 

(III.17), (III.50), (III.55), (III.56), (III.57) and (III.60). The reference temperature was set 

=oT 303 K. This approach was adopted in order to reduce the number of parameters and to 

allow the estimation of equilibrium at different temperatures. In the particular case of the 

Langmuir and Nitta models, the saturation loadings are usually set constant (e.g., Do 

(1998)), although some authors consider their variation too (e.g., van de Graaf et al.,

(1999)). In this work, the satq  temperature dependence was assumed to be similar to those 

of the Langmuir-Freundlich and Toth equations ((III.57); the parameter Nn  of the Nitta 

isotherm was the unique considered ?T independent; for the multicomponent Toth 

expression, an approach similar to that of Lamia et al. (2009) was adopted while taking 

ethaneT tt = .  

It is clear from the small AARDs obtained (1.67 – 2.98%) that all equations are able 

to represent equilibrium data with similar and high accuracies within the ranges of 

temperature and pressure studied. For the reference temperature, Langmuir-Freundlich and 

Toth isotherms are found to practically reduce to the Langmuir model, especially for 

ethane, as the corresponding heterogeneity parameters are nearly unity (see equations 

(III.54)and (III.59)). Similar results were obtained by Abdul-Rehman et al. (1990) and 

Buss and Heuchel (1997), which were attributed to the high surface homogeneity as well 

as the channel-like pore geometry of silicalite-1, where interactions between adsorbate 

molecules can only occur to a small extent.  

The fitted Q  for each adsorption isotherm are analogous, namely 10.797–14.697 

kJ/mol for methane and 26.552–28.323 kJ/mol for ethane, although they do not have to be 

necessarily identical, since for Langmuir LQ  is the isosteric heat of adsorption, while for 

the other isotherms it is only a measure of the adsorption heat.  

Concerning the multicomponent equilibrium for the methane/ethane/silicalite-1 

system, it has been estimated in this work from the pure gas isotherms. Accordingly, the 

parameters from Table VI.4 have been directly substituted in equations (III.44), (III.52), 

(III.58), and (III.63) to get Langmuir, Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Toth models, 

respectively. In Figure VI.1 the equilibrium predictions at 303 K are shown. In the 

calculations the saturation capacity of each component in the binary mixture was fixed 

equal to that of ethane for thermodynamic consistency, following the van de Graaf et al.’s 

approach (van de Graaf et al., 1999).

According to Figure VI.1a, the predicted methane concentration in silicalite-1 

decreases considerably as ethane pressure increases. This is due to competition effects, i.e., 

since ethane is preferentially adsorbed, the amount of available sites for methane 

adsorption is reduced and consequently its surface concentration decreases. In contrast, the 

same behaviour was not observed for ethane (Figure VI.1b), once the presence of methane 

in the binary mixture does not significantly influence its adsorption equilibrium. It is also 

evident from Figure VI.1 that all predicted binary isotherms exhibit a similar trend. 

However, for methane some deviations result from the different equations. For instance, 

Nitta predicts higher concentration values in the solid, while Langmuir provides the 

smaller ones. For ethane adsorption, the extended Nitta equation predicts slightly higher 

loadings while the remaining three perform similarly.

account the experimental data published by van de Graaf et al. (1999), specifically pure 

gas fluxes for several transmembrane pressure drops at 303 and 373 K. The physical 

features of the membrane zeolite and support layers are compiled in Table VI.5.

The single component diffusion parameters of equation (III.15) are soÐ  and sa,E . 

These were optimized for each isotherm by substituting the corresponding thermodynamic 

factors, ? , given in Table VI.1. Such fittings were carried out by solving simultaneously 

the MS equations for the zeolite and support layers, in order to determine their 

corresponding profiles of ?  and pressure. The isotherm equations were used to calculate 

the compositions in the feed/zeolite and zeolite/support interfaces.  

The calculated results are graphed in Figure VI.2 as flux versus pressure, for both 

temperatures studied, and the regressed parameters are compiled in Table VI.6. Figure VI.2 

shows an approximately linear dependence of methane permeation fluxes on pressure, 

while ethane fluxes tend to a maximum (monolayer capacity) at 303 K, due to its stronger 

adsorption strength on the zeolite. All isotherms analysed are able to anticipate this 

saturation limit for sufficiently high pressures. Accordingly, a good fit was found for 

ethane using all of them. On the other hand, only Langmuir and Toth predict the expected 

Henry’s law limit at low pressures. Nonetheless, all isotherms describe accurately the 

methane linear trend, since Nitta and Langmuir-Freundlich almost reduce to the Langmuir 

model (remember that LFn  and t  are nearly unity). It may be also observed that at higher 

temperatures (Figure VI.2b, 373 K) the permeation of methane decreases, while that of 

ethane increases. Such behaviour inclusively makes methane permeation inferior to ethane. 



Results and Discussion 

 105 

Besides, ethane fluxes approach the linear limit, in comparison to 303 K, since its 

adsorption strength decreases with temperature. As previously discussed in Chapter III, the 

permeation flux of adsorbable molecules may show a typical maximum with temperature, 

due to the opposing effects that temperature imparts upon diffusivity and adsorption. 

Moreover, a temperature shift of the maximum may be observed for molecules with 

increasing adsorption strength, as evidenced for instance by results of Bernal et al. (2002) 

for methane, ethane, propane and n-butane in a ZSM-5 membrane. Hence, the decrease of 

methane flux with temperature may reflect the predominance of the decline of the amount 

of adsorbed molecules, whereas for ethane the enhancement on diffusivity still prevails in 

this temperature range.

Prediction of binary methane/ethane permeation in a silicalite-1 membrane. Taking 

into account the estimated binary isotherms and the pure gas diffusivities determined above 

at 303 and 373 K, the membrane separation of a methane/ethane mixture has been totally 

predicted at 273, 303, 338, and 373 K, in order to validate the new expressions provided in 

this work. Our results were compared with the experimental data published by van de 

Graaf et al. (1999) for the silicalite-1 membrane of Table VI.5.  

van de Graaf et al. (1999) performed experiments with different feed compositions 

according to the Wicke-Kallenbach technique, i.e. using a constant flow rate of sweep gas 

(helium) to wash the permeate side. The retentate and permeate sides were well mixed. The 

counterflux of the sweep gas was considered to be very low at the relatively low 

temperatures of the experiments (273-373 K), and therefore neglected in their calculations. 

The authors pointed out that if there was any effect of the sweep gas, it would be lumped in 

the value of the diffusivity calculated from single-component experiments.  

In this work, the prediction of the permeation fluxes was performed without fitting 

any crossed parameters, by just using the estimated multicomponent isotherms and the 

Vignes relation (equation (III.42)) for the calculation of the MS surface pair diffusivities 

( )sijÐ  from the single ones on the solid ( )siÐ . The resistance of the support layer was 
included, and the isotherms were once more utilized to calculate the compositions in the 

feed/zeolite and zeolite/support interfaces. The numerical solution was accomplished by 

solving simultaneously the generalized MS equations for the zeolite and support layers to 

obtain their concentration profiles. The resulting ordinary differential equations were 

integrated using the ode15s function of Matlab. 

The calculated results are plotted in Figures VI.3 and VI.4 along with experimental 

data. Both figures clearly point out the sound predictive capability of the Maxwell-Stefan 

model combined with the thermodynamic factors derived in this work, since no additional 

parameter was introduced. 

In Figure VI.3, the fluxes of methane and ethane are plotted against ethane partial 

pressure at 303 K, and emphasizes that all adsorption models give rise to results in good 

agreement with each other as well as with data points. In this figure, the ethane flux 

increases by increasing its partial pressure, while methane performs inversely. 



Results and Discussion 

 107 

Additionally, it should be noted that fluxes predicted adopting Nitta isotherm are slightly 

higher, while Langmuir equations underestimate them, being such differentiation more 

evident for methane. This behaviour could be anticipated from the binary isotherms shown 

in Figure VI.1, where Nitta equation presents the highest values. Nonetheless, equilibrium 

is still slightly better described by the extended Langmuir and Toth isotherms, although 

Langmuir-Freundlich and Nitta models also perform quite well. These conclusions are in 

good agreement with those published by Abdul-Rehman et al. (1990), where the Toth 

model was found to give the best results for the first four alkanes (C1 – C4) adsorption in 

silicalite-1, for both single component and binary mixtures, being the extended Langmuir 

equation also adequate for ethane, methane, and ethane/methane adsorption.

In Figure VI.4, the permeation fluxes of methane and ethane are plotted against 

temperature for a 1:1 (mol) mixture. These results point out that the binary permeation 

behaviour may be not solely anticipated by single-component results. In fact, in the case of 

two adsorbable gases, the most adsorbed one may permeate preferentially through the

zeolitic pores, hindering the diffusion of the second molecule. Accordingly, the methane 

flux in the binary mixture is smaller. Moreover, as temperature rises, the permeation of 

ethane decreases after 338 K, since its concentration in silicalite-1 diminishes and leaves 

more vacant sites available for methane. As in Figure VI.3, the results calculated with the 

Nitta isotherm overpredict methane behaviour, whereas Langmuir presents systematically 

inferior values.

2. Dynamic characterization of microporous membranes  

 

2.1 Single gas permeation 

During this work nineteen microporous membranes were synthesized by CICECO research 

team, namely nine of titanosilicate AM-3, five of titanosilicate ETS-10, four of zeolite 

ZSM-5, and a last one of zeolite 4A. All of these membranes were firstly characterized by 

measuring N2 permeance at room temperature, in order to investigate the existence of 

rough defects in their crystalline structure. Generally, permeances of small gases through 

microporous membranes higher than 610?  mol/m2s.Pa point out rough deficiencies. If 

gases with kinetic diameters larger than crystal pore size do permeate, the same conclusion 

may be drawn. The average pore diameter of AM-3, ETS-10, ZSM-5, and zeolite 4A are 

0.3, 0.49×0.76, 0.55, and 0.4 nm, respectively, and the kinetic diameter of N2 is 0.346 nm. 

Consequently, N2 permeation flux abnormally high reveal considerable defect density on 

the membrane structure. Even though the pore dimensions of the several materials studied 

are different, only membranes with N2 permeance inferior to 610?  mol/m2s.Pa were 

considered for further detailed characterization. Please note that the kinetic diameter of N2 

is larger than AM-3 pore diameter, and accordingly no permeance should be detected at all. 

However, a perfect microporous membrane is difficult to achieve and macro, meso or even 

microdefects may be always present in real systems. In addition, it is important to note that 

permeance depends on the membrane thickness (please see equation (II.1)), so comparison 

between different membranes should be made with caution. 

Table VI.7 lists N2 permeances at room temperature for all membranes studied.  

According to the above mentioned primary criteria for membranes quality, AM-3-1 

membrane was excluded from the detailed characterization, since its N2 permeance was 

considerably high. Concerning AM-3-3, AM-3-4, and AM-3-5 membranes, their results are 

within the typical permeance range ( 710101 ?×?  mol/m2s.Pa), suggesting good quality 

membranes, i.e. without a significant amount of large defects. Hence, these membranes 

were subjected to subsequent detailed characterization, namely permeation at programmed 

temperature (PPT) experiments using different gases and at several transmembrane

pressure drops. From temperature-permeation curves it is possible to identify the prevailing 

transport mechanisms involved and subsequently detect defects. 

AM-3-7, AM-3-8, AM-3-9, AM-3-10, and AM-3-11 membranes were synthesized 

after characterization of the first four AM-3 membranes. Their N2 permeances were 

measured after a first synthesis and values superior to those of previous three membranes 

were found. Since membranes exhibiting smaller N2 permeances are desired, they were 

submitted to a second synthesis step. After this second crystallization, N2 permeances were 

found to be not significantly reduced, being still larger for AM-3-8, AM-3-9, and AM-3-10 

membranes. This suggests that a second synthesis can result in a membrane of lower 

quality. Similar results were obtained by Lin et al. (2004) for ETS-10 membranes, which 

were attributed to the partial dissolution of the first formed ETS-10 layer, hindering a good 

intergrowth between neighbour crystals. In an attempt to improve the quality of the three 

above cited membranes a third synthesis step is presently in course. 

The nitrogen permeances of the five ETS-10 membranes studied are slightly higher 

than the reference values range ( 610?&gt;  mol/m2s.Pa). Similarly to the last five AM-3 

membranes, ETS-10-4 and ETS-10-5 membranes were subjected to additional 

titanosilicate layers deposition. Concerning ETS-10-4 membrane, after the second 

synthesis its N2 permeance decreased below the detection limit of the experimental set-up, 

and accordingly no additional measurements were possible. On the other hand, the 

permeance of ETS-10-5 membrane was only slightly decreased, and therefore a third 

synthesis was carried out. After this last crystallization step, N2 permeance was found be to 

significantly reduced. Hence, ETS-10-5 membrane was also considered for further 

characterization. 

With respect to the ZSM-5 membranes, only the first one presents an acceptable N2 

permeance, i.e. below 610?  mol/m2s.Pa. In fact, the permeance of ZSM-5-1 membrane was 

considerably small (5.21×10-8 mol/m2s.Pa) indicating probably a noticeable low defects 

density. Despite the well-established characterization of ZSM-5 membranes, this 

membrane was subjected to further permeation tests because of its interesting organophilic 

character, distinct of that of AM-3, ETS-10 and zeolite 4A. Hence, single N2 and CO2 

permeance measurements at two fixed temperatures were carried out.  



Results and Discussion 

 111 

A similar procedure was adopted for testing the zeolite 4A membrane quality, 

resulting in a N2 permeance of 4.30×10-8 mol/m2s.Pa after three crystallization steps. This 

membrane was thus subsequently submitted to experiments at programmed temperature, in 

order to detect the transport mechanism involved in gas transport. However, results are not 

presented since the support started to oxidize.

The N2 permeance of three supports used in membranes synthesis, namely two of ?-

alumina and one of stainless-steel, were measured for comparison (please see Table VI.7 ). 

As expected, their permeance is considerably higher, especially those of ?-alumina because 

of their macroporous structure. It is clear from these values that even for more permeable 

membranes their permeance is significantly reduced after deposition of titanosilicate or 

zeolite separation layers.        

 

Membranes pre-treatment 

Before the dynamic characterization of the membranes, a previous heating and cooling 

cycle was carried out in order to remove adsorbed compounds. Figure VI.5 shows 

permeation fluxes as function of transmembrane pressure drop for both ETS-10-1 and AM-

3-4 membranes, at room temperature, before and after the heating and cooling cycle up to 

around 200ºC. Calculated permeances, corresponding to the slope of the linear fitting to 

experimental data, are indicated in Table VI.8. These figures point out an enhancement of 

N2 permeation fluxes. After the thermal treatment the effective pore size becomes large 

due to the removal of water or other eventually adsorbed molecules, supporting the 

hydrophilic character of both ETS-10 and AM-3 crystals.

ETS-10-3 membrane 

The nitrogen permeance of the ETS-10-3 membrane at room temperature, presented in 

Table VI.7, is clearly outside the typical range ( ?  =1.21×10-6 mol/(m2sPa)), which may 

indicate the presence of a significant amount of mesopores and even of large macro-defects 

on the crystalline structure. Figure VI.6 shows the permeation fluxes of N2 as function of 

the transmembrane pressure drop, at 24 and 55ºC, and the corresponding permeances 

calculated according to equation (II.3). Generally, non-adsorbable gases or gases with 

linear adsorption isotherms (Henry regime) show a linear relation between permeation flux 

and pressure gradient across the membrane and so pressure-independent permeances. In 

contrast, Figure VI.6a evidences a nonlinear dependence of N2 flux on pressure, which 

may be attributed to the contribution of viscous flow mechanism to the total permeation. 

Such contribution is also evidenced by the pressure-dependence of permeance (Figure 

VI.6b), as well as by permeance decline with increasing temperature (see equation (III.2)).  

The main objective of the membranes studied in this work concerns the separation of 

small gases. Since ETS-10-3 membrane presents a considerably amount of macro-defects, 

where non-selective viscous mechanism dominates, this membrane would not be suitable 

for this purpose. Hence, no additional tests were performed with this membrane.

ETS-10-5 membrane 

The N2 permeance of ETS-10-5 membrane after the first synthesis step (Table VI.7) was 

significantly higher than the typical permeance range for micropores ( 66 101010.7 ?? &gt;×  

mol/m2sPa). A permeation at programmed temperature experiment was subsequently 

carried out in order to verify the existence of macro- and/or mesopores. The obtained 

results, presented in Figure VI.7a, evidence the expected decrease of the permeance with 

temperature, confirming the existence of such defects.  

A second crystallization was carried out in order to improve membrane quality. After 

this synthesis, the N2 permeance has decreased ca. three times, which indicates that some 

large defects were probably fixed. However, the decrease in permeance was not as 

pronounced as required, and thus a significant amount of defects still existed in the 

membrane, as supported by the PPT results pictured in Figure VI.7a. Nonetheless, it should 

be emphasized that the permeance decline after the second synthesis is considerably 

smoother for the same transmembrane pressure drop (0.5 bar). 

After a third titanosilicate layer synthesis, a meaningful decrease in permeance was 

finally found, i.e., it dropped two orders of magnitude. Accordingly, most of the larger 

defects presented initially in the ETS-10-4 membrane were possibly eliminated after three 

synthesis. In this case, the PPT results, presented in Figure VI.7b, reveal a distinct

temperature dependence. In the lower temperature range, the permeance decreases owing 

to the Knudsen contribution, and eventually to some residual viscous flow through the 

persisting defects of the titanosilicate layer, while it increases monotonously at higher 

temperatures due to activated diffusion through micropores. This result indicates that the 

quality of the membrane was significantly improved. It should be noted that the last PPT 

run was carried out with a transmembrane pressure drop as high as 5 bar, since for lower 

driving forces the permeation fluxes were not measurable (values below the detection limit 

of the equipment).  

Similar results were obtained by Xu et al. (2005), who employed a multi-stage 

synthesis method for preparation of NaA membranes and found the best quality membrane 

after a three-stage synthesis. Tiscornia et al. (2005) also obtained a higher quality ETS-10 

membrane after a two-step seeded synthesis.

AM-3-3 membrane 

The permeance of He, H2, N2, and CO2 in the AM-3-3 membrane was measured along with 

temperature. Figure VI.8 shows the PPT results for these gases, measured under the same 

transmembrane pressure drop of 1 bar. As may be observed, CO2 and N2 show similar 

permeances of 0.2 – 0.4×10-7 mol/(m2sPa), which are significantly lower than those of He 

and H2 (0.7 – 1.2×10-7 mol/(m2sPa)). It should be noted that the permeation of bulkier N2 

and CO2 molecules may be only attributed to the transport through defects larger than the 

titanosilicate pores, since the kinetic diameters of these gases (0.364 and 0.33 nm, 

respectively) are larger than the AM-3 pore size (0.3 nm). In addition, since H2 and He are 

smaller than the pore diameter, one could expect the permeance of these molecules to be 

governed by activated diffusion and display a clear increase with temperature. However, 

both H2 and He are small molecules capable of high permeation rates through inter-

crystalline defects. Thus, in membranes with significant defect density the effect of 

permeation through defects could overcome activated contribution in the micropores. 

Therefore, the descending pattern of this membrane may be considered a reliable indicator 

of the presence of defects.

Figure VI.9 compares the permeance of He, H2, N2 and CO2 obtained for two distinct 

transmembrane pressure drops: 1 and 2 bar. It is clear that P?  has only a mild effect on 

the permeance, especially for He and H2. However, an increase of the permeance with 

pressure was found for all the gases, corroborating the contribution of viscous flow to the 

total permeation. It is important to note that He and H2 diffusion is less dependent on the 

pressure, since their transport may occur through micropores and defects also, while N2 

and CO2 diffuse uniquely through defects given their kinetic diameters larger than AM-3 

pore size. Accordingly, the contribution from viscous flow is expected to be more 

important for N2 and CO2.   

Figure VI.9a presents two overlapped permeation curves for He at ?P = 2 bar, being 

the first one measured only until 120ºC, while the second one was carried out up to 170ºC, 

and after all the other PPT runs with the remaining gases. The results for the second PPT 

experiment were consistent with those previously obtained and reveal the predominance of 

gas transport through macro and/or meso-defects even for higher temperatures. In addition, 

the membrane is found to be stable during repeated heating and cooling cycles in this 

temperature range.   

The relationship between the permeance of the AM-3-3 membrane and the kinetic 

diameters and molecular weight of the permeating gases is presented in Figure VI.10. This 

figure emphasizes a clear permeance dependence on both properties. Moreover, as 

previously discussed, a pronounced permeance decline may be observed for gases with 

kinetic diameter superior to the AM-3 pore size, reporting at least some molecular sieving 

effect (see Figure VI.10a). Observed results also showed a clear trend of decreasing 

permeance with increasing molecular weight, following the typical behaviour of Knudsen 

diffusion (see Figure VI.10 b and equation (III.6)).

The dominance of the Knudsen mechanism can be further verified in Figure VI.11, 

where the permeance of the four studied gases shows a linear trend with the inverse of the 

square root of the molecular weight (see Figure VI.11a), as expected for this transport 

mechanism (see equation (III.6)). Concerning the viscous flow mechanism, its dependence 

on gas viscosity implies a dependence on both kinetic diameter and molecular weight. 

Following, for instance, the method of Chung et al. (1984) for estimating gas viscosity, 

based on the theory of Chapman and Enskog, such dependence may be described by 
2
k

5.0 dM? ? . It is clear from Figure VI.11b that the permeances roughly follow the inverse 

of the square root of molecular weight multiplied by the corresponding square of kinetic 

diameter, indicating as well some contribution from viscous flow.

Figure VI.12 shows the ideal selectivities of H2/CO2, H2/N2, He/CO2 and He/N2, 

He/H2 and N2/CO2 calculated based on the permeance data for 40, 70, 100, and 120ºC. For 

comparison, the corresponding values calculated from Knudsen diffusion were compiled in 

Table VI.9. It may be observed that ideal selectivities for all binary systems are quite 

similar to those for Knudsen mechanism, which is in total accordance with the previous 

discussion (see Figure VI.11). Moreover, ideal selectivities relative to gases with similar 

kinetic diameter and molecular weight, namely for He/H2 and N2/CO2, are close to unity 

and almost independent of temperature. In contrast, ideal selectivity for gases with more 

distinct kinetic diameters and molecular weight (for H2/CO2, H2/N2, He/CO2 and He/N2) 

are higher, evidencing at least a small contribution from molecular sieving. Moreover, 

these increase slightly with temperature.

Results and Discussion 

 121 

Experimental data for single gas permeation were modelled based on single 

component transport mechanisms described in Chapter III. Transport through macro- and 

meso-defects was described by both Knudsen and viscous flow, while micropore diffusion 

was assumed to occur by activated gaseous mechanism. Previous studies (Lin et al., 1997) 

have revealed that N2 is practically non-adsorbed on AM-3. Since permeation results do 

not evidence the contribution of surface diffusion (i.e. the presence of a minimum followed 

by a maximum in the T? ?  curve), for the remaining gases it was not taken into account. 

Equation (III.26) was adopted to fit the experimental data of Figure VI.8, by taking 

0=s?  as aforementioned. A geometric factor, supg , was included in order to take the 

support effect into account. The membrane geometrical parameters for Knudsen and 

viscous flow mechanisms were considered equal for all gases, since they only depend on 

membrane features. In contrast, for activated diffusion one distinct constant accounting for 

geometrical parameters was fixed for molecules capable to permeate AM-3 pores (H2 and 

He) and another one for molecules larger than AM-3 pore diameter (N2 and CO2). This 

distinction is due to the fact that H2 and He, and N2 and CO2 diffuse through different 

microporous pathways, i.e., AM-3 structural pores and larger intercrystalline micropores.             

Figure VI.13 shows model results together with experimental data. The calculated 

parameters are compiled in Table VI.10. The figure points out the reliable agreement 

between modelling and experimental data, corresponding to %9.5=AARD , being the 

higher deviations found for the lower temperature range. The different contributions of 

each individual transport mechanism for H2 permeation are illustrated in Figure VI.14. As 

may be observed, H2 permeance takes place mainly by Knudsen diffusion, with a minor 

contribution from viscous flow. Besides, as expected from the decreasing trend of 

permeance against temperature, the activated gaseous diffusion is not significant. These 

results are in total agreement with the previous discussion.  

The optimized parameter of the activated diffusion of molecules larger than AM-3 

pore size, i.e. N2 and CO2, is one order of magnitude inferior to that of H2 and He 

(1.719×10-11 versus 2.148×10-10), due to the relative sizes of the molecules and the 

permeated pores. With respect to the activation energies, the small values found for N2 and 

CO2 (1.7 and 4.0 kJ/mol, respectively) in relation to those of H2 and He (13.3 and 11.0

AM-3-4 membrane  

The effect of temperature and pressure on the permeation of the AM-3-4 membrane was 

investigated by measuring the N2 permeation flux for several transmembrane pressure 

drops at 25, 100, and 140 ºC.   

Figure VI.15 presents the obtained N2 fluxes and the corresponding permeances 

along with the transmembrane pressure drop. As may be observed, the N2 permeance 

decreases with increasing temperature, as expected for both Knudsen and viscous 

mechanisms. In addition, it follows a linear pressure-dependence, which is characteristic of 

the viscous flow mechanism (see equation (III.2)). Once more, permeation at programmed 

temperature experiments, under two distinct transmembrane pressure drops (1 and 2 bar), 

were performed in order to identify the prevailing transport mechanisms.  

PPT results, shown in Figure VI.16, are in good agreement with those obtained for 

fixed temperatures, i.e., the N2 permeance decreases over all the temperature range studied, 

being enhanced with the transmembrane pressure difference. Such results denunciate a 

significant amount of macro-defects on the AM-3-4 membrane structure. Accordingly, no 

additional characterization tests were carried out on this membrane, since it is not suitable 

for desired separations.

diameters larger than AM-3 pore size, i.e. N2, CO2, and O2, were found to permeate the 

membrane, indicating the presence of defects larger than AM-3 structural pores. In 

contrast, due to their smaller dimensions, H2 molecules are able to easily diffuse through 

AM-3 pores as well as through larger defects and, accordingly, their permeance is 

considerably higher. 

Figure VI.17 shows an initial plateau in the H2 permeance, followed by a subsequent 

monotonous increase with temperature. This behaviour is frequently found for diffusion of 

small permanent gases through real microporous membranes, and can be explained by the 

simultaneous occurrence of distinct transport mechanisms. At lower temperatures, 

Knudsen and viscous flow through macro and/or meso-defects may prevail, whereas at 

higher temperatures transport occurs via activated gaseous diffusion through micropores. 

Although a significant density of defects may be present, the permeance increase with 

temperature indicates a preponderance of activated permeation through the microporous 

titanosilicate layer and, therefore, a lower concentration of defects may be admitted. Such 

increasing trend is expected to be more pronounced at higher temperatures.  

Concerning N2, CO2 and O2 diffusion, their permeance was found to be less 

dependent on temperature. This may be due to an equilibration between the competitive 

mechanisms discussed above. Given this behaviour, at least some defects are expected to 

be of a size roughly similar to those of N2, CO2 and O2 molecules. However, the activated 

diffusion eventually present in such micro-defects may be not as significant as for H2 

diffusion, and thus not important enough to prevail in the temperature range studied. 

Moreover, based on permeation results for these gases on microporous zeolite-type 

materials, their activation energy for diffusion is expected to be larger than that of H2, and, 

accordingly, higher temperatures are required to allow them to overcome the pore structure 

restrictions. In fact, this behaviour is frequently reported in the literature for permeation 

through microporous membranes. For instance, Aoki et al., (1998) reported N2 and CO2 

permeances unchanged with temperature up to 100ºC through an A-type zeolite membrane. 

Poshusta et al., (1998) presented the permeation results of several gases through a SAPO-

34 membrane and showed N2 and CO2 permeances considerably less temperature-

dependence exhibiting a slight minimum. Bernal (2002) presented almost temperature-

independent results for permeation of H2 through a ZSM-5 membrane, and permeation of 

N2 through MOR and ZSM-5 membranes.  

Figure VI.18 shows the effect of the transmembrane pressure drop on H2 permeation. 

It is clear from this figure that the H2 permeance is only slightly influenced by pressure, 

indicating the presence of some large defects. However, the extent of such defects cannot 

be surely deduced from these results once the P?  values studied are not sufficiently 

different. Nonetheless, experiments for higher fluxes, i.e. for conditions where permeances 

are much superior, could not be carried out due to set-up limitations.

The dependence of permeances on kinetic diameter and molecular weight of 

permeating gases are pictured in Figure VI.19a and VI.19b. As may be observed, in 

general no specific relationships were found between permeances and kinetic diameters or 

molecular weights. However, the permeance of the smaller H2 molecules stills detaches 

from the remaining gases, indication some contribution from molecular sieving effect. The 

permeances of gases larger that AM-3 pores are not greatly dependent on the molecular

size, since the aperture of defects is larger than the size of these molecules. Concerning 

molecular weight, permeances decrease with increasing M , except for the heaviest CO2, 

which permeates faster than O2.  

The dependence of permeation on the molecular weight of diffusing gases was 

further investigated by representing their permeances against the inverse of square root of 

molecular weights (see Figure VI.20). As expected, in this case permeances did not 

perfectly scale with the square root of their molar mass ratios. Besides, a linear dependence 

on the ration between the square of kinetic diameter and the square root of molecular 

weight, as expected for the viscous mechanism, was not found as well. Based in these 

results one may conclude that neither the Knudsen mechanism nor the viscous one may be 

assumed predominant.

decrease of both H2 and CO2 permeances after humidification, probably due to the 

blockage of titanosilicate pores or inter-crystalline pores. This is a totally expectable result 

given the high hydrophilic character of AM-3 crystals. Besides, the activated tendency was 

improved for both gases. This may be due to the blockage of some inter-crystalline defects, 

which could allow an earlier prevalence of activated diffusion for lower temperatures. In 

addition, the removal of water molecules by increasing temperature may be also 

responsible for the remarkable increase of H2 and CO2 permeances for higher 

temperatures.  

The beneficial effect of water in hydrophilic membrane separations has been 

investigated by Sebastian et al. (2008) for the separation of H2 from N2 in the presence of 

moisture using a microporous titanosilicate AM-2 membrane. In their study, a H2O/H2/N2 

mixture was fed to the membrane with a water relative pressure of 0.7, which is high 

enough to ensure capillary condensation of water in inter-crystalline defects. It was found 

that unlike other zeolitic membranes, moisture did not seem to permeate through the 

intrinsic micropores of AM-2 but used the inter-crystalline defects existing in the 

membrane where it was capillary condensed. This gave rise to a tremendous increase of the 

H2/N2 selectivity (from close to 50 to more than 800) in the presence of a sufficient high 

partial pressure of water. However, no significant effect was found when using a 

hydrophilic mordenite membrane, once its micropores are large enough to allow the 

passage of water.

Figure VI.21 – Permeance of H2 and CO2 as function of temperature after AM-3-5 
membrane humidification (same operating conditions as those of PTP runs in Figure 
VI.17); results obtained before humidification are also presented for comparison.  

 

The dependence of ideal selectivities with temperature is illustrated in Figure VI.22. 

By comparison with values of Table VI.9, it is found that ideal selectivities for CO2/O2 and 

N2/CO2 are slightly higher and ideal selectivities for H2/N2 and H2/CO2 are inferior to those 

of the Knudsen diffusion. These results corroborate the presence of some defects in the 

membrane. However, given the higher selectivity values, they may be assumed to be 

present in less extent than for the previously studied membranes. Concerning the 

temperature effect, both N2/CO2, and CO2/O2 ideal selectivities decrease with temperature, 

since CO2 permeance increases faster than that of N2, and O2 increases faster than that of 

CO2. The ideal selectivity of H2/CO2 and H2/N2 show a relatively pronounced increasing 

trend with temperature, given the activated diffusion of H2 through smaller AM-3 

micropores. 

The ideal selectivities for H2/CO2 before and after the membrane humidification are 

compared in Figure VI.22b. This figure clearly points out an expected enhancement in the 

ideal selectivity after humidification. However, such enhancement tends to vanish with 

increasing temperature, because of the removal of water molecules responsible for the 

blockage of some inter-crystalline pores.

Figure VI.22 – Ideal selectivities for several binary systems in the AM-3-5 membrane 
as function of temperature. 

 

It is important to note that although the permeations at programmed temperature 

evidence the better quality of the AM-3-5 membrane in comparison with AM-3-3 

membrane, its permeances are around one order of magnitude superior, which could 

denunciate a higher density of large defects. Such disagreement may be attributed to 

differences of the thickness and pore size distributions. In order to roughly elucidate this 

feature, the ratios between the permeances of both membranes at 40ºC for H2, N2, and CO2 

were calculated. Assuming viscous or Knudsen flow, equations (III.2) and (III.6) show that 

this ratio reduces to ( ) 2133AMp,53AMp,53AM33AM33AM53AM ????????????? ×= dd???? , which for H2, 
N2, and CO2 gives 14, 27, and 21, respectively. These values are close inside the same 

order of magnitude and so the higher permeances in AM-3-5 membrane may be ascribed 

essentially to its thinner thickness. 

Similarly to the AM-3-3 membrane, the permeation data of Figure VI.17 were 

modelled based on the transport mechanisms discussed in Chapter III. Also for this 

membrane, surface diffusion was not taken into account. Figure VI.23 shows the good 

agreement found between modelling and experimental data, corresponding to 

%5.2=AARD .

Figure VI.23 – Modelling and experimental results for permeation of H2, N2, O2, and CO2 
in AM-3-5 membrane ( P?  = 0.2 bar). 

 
 

The contributions of each individual transport mechanism for H2 permeation, 

considering 0s =? , are illustrated in Figure VI.24. As for the previously discussed Figure 

VI.20, a predominance of a particular transport mechanism was not observed. In fact, 

Figure VI.24 evidences an identical contribution of Knudsen and viscous flow to the 

transport through defects. Besides, the activated gaseous diffusion is considerable for the 

total transport, being more important at higher temperatures, as expected. 

Table VI.11 compiles the calculated model parameters. Also in this case, the 

activated diffusion parameter of molecules larger than AM-3 pore size, i.e. N2, CO2, and 

O2, is one order of magnitude inferior to that of H2 (4.916×10-6 versus 1.769×10-5). 

Besides, they are significantly higher than those of the AM-3-3 membrane, corroborating 

the sound contribution of activated diffusion for transport through this membrane. This 

result is also consentaneous with the increasing trend of the T? ?  curves. Likewise AM-

3-3 membrane, the activation energies found for the molecules larger than AM-3 pore size 

(3.0, 4.6, and 5.5 kJ/mol for N2, CO2, and O2, respectively) are smaller than that of H2 

(10.0 kJ/mol), reflecting distinct diffusing pathways. Furthermore, the calculated activation 

energies are very close for both membranes.

The obtained results point out a meaningful H2 transport through AM-3-5 micropores 

and, accordingly, surface diffusion may be expected to occur, particularly at low 

temperatures. Hence, experimental data for H2 were modelled taking this mechanism into 

account also (equation III.26). For this purpose, the parameters corresponding to the 

Knudsen and viscous mechanisms listed in Table VI.11 were fixed, while those for 

diffusion through micropores were fitted to the H2 data. Figure VI.25 illustrates the model 

results together with the contributions of each mechanism. It is clear that the model 

performs quite better as confirmed by the smaller deviation obtained ( )%1.1=AARD . 
Nonetheless, it should be noted that a higher number of parameters was fitted, which also

Table VI.12. As may be noted, the activation energy for diffusion was ca. two times higher 

than that obtained assuming 0s =?  (21.6 and 10.0 kJ/mol, respectively). This is an 

expected result since a superior activation energy increases the permeation sensibility on 

the temperature, being able to interpret the visible acceleration of the curve after 

approximately 80ºC (see Figure VI.25).

ZSM-5-1 Membrane 

Figure VI.26 shows the fluxes of nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the ZSM-5-1 membrane 

as function of transmembrane pressure drop at 30ºC. Results correspond to one 

experimental run. The permeances of both gases at 30ºC and 100ºC are represented in 

Figure VI.27. In Figure VI.26, the flux of nitrogen depends linearly on P?  

[ ])kPa(211.5)smmol( 12 PN i ?×=?? , which means the viscous flow mechanism is absent. 
Therefore, the membrane does not exhibit macropores or other rough defects. In fact, the 

permeation of non-adsorbable gases in micro and mesopores is directly proportional to 

.P?  Such behavior is also evidenced in Figure VI.27a. The permeance of N2 increases 
with temperature, which supports the activated nature of gaseous diffusion in small 

micropores. This result suggests that the transport is not controlled by Knudsen mechanism 

in mesopores, since in this case 
2N

?  would decrease with increasing T .  

In contrast to N2, the flux of CO2 deviates from previous behavior due to adsorption 

effects. As seen in Figure VI.26, the flux deviates clearly from the linear trend expected at 

low P? . Figure VI.27 corroborates this finding as the permeances of CO2 vary with P? , a 
typical result for adsorbable gases. Such trend is more pronounced at lower temperatures, 

since adsorption decreases with increasing temperature. Furthermore, as P?  is raised, 

2CO
? becomes nearly constant because the surface concentration tends toward saturation 

and the surface diffusion stabilizes. It is important to conclude that in this range of 

operation the surface diffusion is more significant than the activated gaseous diffusion, 

while 
2CO

?  decreases with increasing temperature.  

The calculated ideal selectivity, * /NCO 22? , was plotted against P?  at both 

temperatures in Figure VI.27b. * /NCO 22?  decreases with transmembrane pressure drop 

because CO2 permeance decreases whereas that of N2 does not change significantly with 

pressure. Concerning the temperature effect, ideal selectivity shows the expected trend, i.e. 

it decreases with increasing temperature, since the adsorption load is reduced.

The performance of a membrane to separate a given binary mixture could be anticipated by 

knowing its quality. According to the previously discussed results for AM-3, ETS-10, 4A 

zeolite, and ZSM-5 membranes, a significant density of defects was found for most of 

them, which may give rise to non-selective transport. Nonetheless, the contribution of large

defects to permeation seems to be minor for both AM-3-3 and AM-3-5 membranes. 

Therefore, the separation of binary mixtures was carried out in this work using both AM-3-

3 and AM-3-5 membranes. 

Due to the large molecular diameters of N2, CO2, and O2 relative to the pore size of 

AM-3 structure, the separation of these molecules from H2-containing mixtures on AM-3 

membranes is expected to occur based on molecular sieving. Accordingly, for such binary 

mixtures, high separation factors could be ideally predicted. However, due to the presence 

of macro and meso-defects, the desired sieving mechanism is weakened and selectivities 

diminish.    

Permeation of equimolar binary mixtures of H2/CO2, N2/CO2 and H2/N2 were 

measured at three temperatures, while feed and sweep gas (helium) flow rates were fixed. 

Figure VI.28 shows the separation factors for both AM-3-3 and AM-3-5 membranes. They 

are around 1 and 1.6 and do not change significantly with temperature, except for 

H2/CO2/AM-3-5. These results are in accordance with the conclusions drawn from the pure 

gas permeation, being attributed to non-selective transport through large defects, which do 

not allow an efficient separation.  

Concerning AM-3-3 membrane, the separation factors for N2/CO2 are quite similar to 

the corresponding ideal selectivity values (see Figure VI.12), while for H2/CO2 they are 

lower. Also for AM-3-5 membrane, the separation factors for H2-containing mixtures were 

lower than ideal selectivities, whereas for N2/CO2 similar values were found. These results 

may be due to difficulties in the quantification of H2 concentration, since H2 and He 

(reference gas for TCD of the GC) have similar thermal conductivities (0.1706 and 0.1502 

W/(m.K), respectively) and therefore the intensity of the TCD signal is very weak. The H2 

quantification is fundamental for the investigation of membranes capable to separate H2-

containing mixtures. Hence, our research team is presently trying to overcome such 

limitation.

VII. Conclusions and Future Work 
 

Conclusions 

The dynamic characterization of zeolite membranes by gas permeation experiments is an 

indispensible tool for the complete assessment of their quality. After the structural 

characterization, these tests allow us to detect the existence of macro, meso and even 

microdefects in new synthesized membranes. After that, the preparation conditions may be 

continuously optimized to obtain good quality membranes. This has been the motivation 

for this dissertation.  

 In order to carry out permeation essays with pure gases and mixtures, an 

experimental set-up has been designed, assembled, and tested. With relation to pure gases, 

the main targets were the measurement of permeances at constant temperature, by varying 

the transmembrane pressure drop, and permeances at programmed temperature, by fixing 

the driving force. With respect to mixtures, the determination of the components mole 

fractions in the permeate and retentate demanded a GC which has been coupled later. In 

the whole, H2, He, N2, CO2, and O2 have been utilized.  

 In this work, nineteen membranes and three different supports have been studied, 

namely nine of AM-3, five of ETS-10, four of ZSM-5, and one of 4A-zeolite, and two 

supports of ?-alumina, and one of stainless-steel. A first exploratory test with nitrogen at 

room temperature has detected fifteen membranes with rough defects, which induced us to 

perform a second deposition on six of them, and a third crystallization onto the two 

membranes. (The reference criterion for rejection was permeances higher than 610?

mol/m2s.Pa). For instance, the ETS-10 membranes no. 4 and 5 reduced their permeances 

from 4.81×10-6  to less than 1×10-9, and 7.10×10-6  to 2.26×10-8 mol/m2s.Pa, respectively. 

On the contrary, AM-3-8, AM-3-9, and AM-3-10 membranes exhibited an apparently 

contradictory result, since ?  values increased from 2.35×10-7 to 1.30×10-6, 2.96×10-7 to 

9.62×10-7, and 1.22×10-6 to 6.38×10-6 mol/m2s.Pa, respectively, attributed to the partial 

dissolution of the first formed titanosilicate layer, hindering a good intergrowth between 

neighbour crystals.  

 After the above mentioned essays, the most promising AM-3-3, AM-3-4, and AM-

3-5 membranes were elected for further studies. The AM-3-4 membrane has been 

investigated with N2 at different pressure drops at 25, 100 and 140ºC, but the results 

revealed it embodied a significant number of defects. Actually, the permeances at constant 

temperature increased with increasing P? , which denoted viscous flow through 

macropores.  

The experimental observations registered for the AM-3-3 membrane with H2, He, N2, 

and CO2 told that the prevailing transport mechanisms were viscous flow and Knudsen 

diffusion. The T? ?  curves were monotonously decreasing, which is typical of both 

contributions. Furthermore, the dominance of the Knudsen mechanism was verified by the 

linear trend found between permeances and the inverse of the square root of the molecular 

weight. Concerning the viscous flow contribution, its dependence on gas viscosity implies 

a subsequent relationship with kinetic diameter and molecular weight, which for Chapman-

Enskog based equations is 2k
5.0 dM? ? . The measured permeances roughly followed 

5.02
k Md? ? , indicating some contribution from viscous flow, once v?  is inversely 

proportional to viscosity.  

The study of the AM-3-5 membrane with pure H2, N2, CO2, and O2 pointed out it 

contains not only macro and mesodefects, but also intercrystalline micropores. Actually, 

the constant permeances of N2, CO2, and O2 over temperature must rely on the necessary 

existence of an activated diffusion to compensate the lowering viscous and Knudsen 

components. Since the kinetic diameters of N2, CO2, and O2 are larger than the 

intracrystalline pores of AM-3, this proves the membrane have significant intercrystalline 

micropores. The hydrogen permeation exhibited the desired exponential behaviour with

temperature, since its small diameter superimposes the intracrystalline activated diffusion 

which overlaps the negative contribution of viscous and Knudsen fluxes. Modelling 

corroborated this phenomenological conclusion, showing that the last mechanisms were 

equivalent in magnitude and always descent, whereas the activated gaseous diffusion 

increased significantly with increasing temperature.  

The ZSM-5 is known to adsorb CO2. This fact gives rise to a distinct permeating 

behaviour, because the permeances decrease with increasing P?  in view of the fact the 

surface loading concentrations increase non-linearly. These results were found for CO2 in 

ZSM-5-1 membrane, whereas for N2 a constant permeance was measured.     

  The calculated ideal selectivities, whose values ranged from ca. 1 to 4.2, have been 

computed with the individual permeances of the cited gases, allowing us to compare once 

more the AM-3-3 and AM-3-5 membranes. E.g., for the H2/CO2 pair, the AM-3-3 

membrane gave *?  between 3.6 and 4.2 for 40–120 ºC, while for AM-3-5 =?* 2.6-3.1 in 

the same temperature interval. These results were expected in advance, since the 

predominance of the non-selective viscous flow in AM-3-5 penalizes the ideal separation 

factors.  

With respect to the experimental selectivities of the H2-containing mixtures studied, 

they were unfortunately lower than the ideal ones, which has been attributed to difficulties 

in the quantification of the H2. This problem could not be fixed in the short time after the 

upgrade of the installation for multicomponent mixtures.  

In order to increase the selectivities some essays have been carried out with AM-3-5 

saturated with water. The measurements clearly emphasized an expected enhancement 

after humidification (e.g. from 2.6 to 4.6 for H2/CO2/AM-3-5), which vanished with 

increasing temperature, because of the removal of the water molecules responsible for the 

blockage of some pores.  

In this work, modelling has been accomplished on the basis of the generalized 

Maxwell-Stefan (MS) equations, since it is simultaneously the most physically adequate 

and elegant approach to deal with multicomponent mixtures. In fact, new models have 

been derived in this thesis for gas transport across membranes and also for ion-exchange in

microporous zeolite materials. The second application arose naturally in parallel to the 

main focus of the dissertation, since the titanosilicates have been used in our group for the 

removal of toxic metals from aqueous solutions, making available interesting data to 

model.  

The gas transport across porous membranes comprehends essentially five 

contributions: viscous, Knudsen, molecular, activated gaseous and surface diffusions. As 

has been mentioned above, the existence of macro and mesodefects in microporous 

materials denunciate the first two or three mechanisms. Interesting and desire contributions 

are the activated gaseous and surface diffusion. In this topic the knowledge of good 

multicomponent isotherms, whether predicted from pure models or experimentally 

measured, is an essential step. In this work, new expressions were derived for the intrinsic 

MS thermodynamic factors of mono and multicomponent Nitta, Langmuir-Freundlich, and 

Toth isotherms, in order to enlarge the application of the Maxwell-Stefan equations to the 

permeation of very dissimilar systems. In fact, the literature only presents equations for 

pure and binary classical and dual site Langmuir. The new expressions were validated 

using methane and ethane data from different sources for silicalite-1: equilibrium points for 

each gas in crystal, pure component fluxes through membrane, and binary fluxes also. 

From single isotherms, the multicomponent ones have been predicted; using pure 

permeation data the corresponding diffusion parameters have been optimized; finally, 

taking into account the Vignes relation, the crossed MS diffusivities have been computed. 

The new equations proposed here, together with previous parameters from independent 

experiments, have successfully allowed us to estimate the binary fluxes of methane/ethane 

through silicalite-1. It is clear from the procedure described that this validation is 

undoubtedly very stringent. The results obtained pointed out the new models are able to 

represent data for pure substances and predict binary permeation fairly well and reliably. In 

comparison with some better results reported for classical Langmuir, following an 

analogous approach, it should be emphasized our calculations involve four parameters less.  

 In relation to ion exchange, the MS approach has been adopted due to their well 

documented advantages over Nernst-Planck relationships, particularly because it takes 

account of ion-ion and ion-solid interactions. The new model proposed was validated with 

batch experiments on mercury (II) and cadmium (II) removal from aqueous solution using

ETS-4 microporous titanosilicate. The relevant species are Hg2+ or Cd2+ and Na+ (initially 

in solution and in ETS-4, respectively), and titanosilicate ionic fixed charges. Results 

obtained provide good representations of metal ions concentration in solution and solid 

phase along time. Even the transition from the steep descent to the horizontal branch of 

0AA CC  versus time curves are well represented, precisely where kinetic curves are most 

difficult to fit. The predicting ability of our MS based model has been also analyzed, being 

possible to conclude it performs very well. In effect, good predictions are accomplished 

with parameters optimized from independent sets of data. Such performance may be 

attributed to the sound physical principles of Maxwell-Stefan theory. 

 

Future Work 

Some suggestions for future work may be raised. It is important to measure isotherms for 

pure gases and mixtures on titanosilicates due to their importance in the permeation 

phenomenon. After that, one may predict them by molecular simulations and compare 

calculations with experimental data.  With respect to the experimental work, it is important 

to study the permeation of additional gases and mixtures as for instance H2/CH4 due to its 

importance. It is crucial to fix the problem of the quantification of hydrogen in the 

mixtures. Only that will make viable an extension of the experimental programme to wider 

ranges of operating conditions. As for equilibrium, the prediction of permeances of pure 

and mixed gases may be accomplished by molecular dynamics simulations, in order to 

reduce the experimental work load and avoid contact with dangerous molecules. Finally, it 

is important to test the performance of the proposed MS based model for multicomponent 

ion exchange, and analyze its behaviour for concentrated solutions, where the Nernst-

Planck model is expected to fail.
