Mina da Panasqueira; Geoquímica Ambiental; Elementos Potencialmente 
Tóxicos; Geologia Médica; Risco.

A mina da Panasqueira (Sn-W) encontra-se em actividade desde o fi nal do 
século XIX. O tratamento e recuperação do minério explorado deu origem a 
grandes quantidades de materiais rejeitados ricos em sulfuretos, depositados 
em escombreiras e barragens de lamas. A existência de povoações localizadas 
na área envolvente da mina, dependentes do trabalho mineiro, da agricultura 
e da criação de gado, justifi caram a avaliação da extensão da contaminação 
existente na envolvente às escombreiras do Rio e da Barroca Grande.

Este estudo, desenvolvido no contexto da Geologia Médica, tem como principal 
objectivo avaliar os problemas da saúde humana resultantes da contaminação 
de solos, águas, sedimentos de corrente, poeiras e plantas na área que rodeia a 
mina da Panasqueira. A análise pretende estabelecer relações entre o ambiente 
geoquímico e a saúde das populações através do uso de modelos de dispersão 
e técnicas baseadas em GIS, de forma a identifi car correspondências entre a 
distribuição espacial dos elementos potencialmente tóxicos (PTE’s) e doenças 
que possam ocorrer ou que possam ser induzidas pelas condições locais.

Foram efectuados estudos geoquímicos detalhados, tanto na fonte de 
contaminação (escombreiras) como no ambiente circundante de forma a 
compreender o comportamento de alguns elementos potencialmente tóxicos 
e a sua relevância ambiental. O grupo de elementos identifi cado nos solos (Ag, 
As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn; PTE’s) refl ecte a infl uência das escombreiras e barragens 
de lamas potenciados por vários agentes, onde se inclui a dispersão eólica 
das partículas, com a sua consequente deposição nos solos. Os PTE’s e o pH 
mostram uma correlação positiva confi rmando a infl uência do pH na mobilidade 
e disponibilidade dos metais e metalóides.

A avaliação da exposição a metais e metalóides por parte das populações 
que vivem e/ou trabalham na área de estudo, pretende identifi car os agentes 
ambientais que possam ter efeitos secundários adversos na saúde humana. 
De forma a estimar as consequências da contaminação nos habitantes foram 
determinados os teores de As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb e Zn no sangue, 
urina, cabelo e unhas em indivíduos expostos ambientalmente. Os resultados 
obtidos são concordantes com os estudos ambientais, sendo que o Arsénio é 
o elemento com maior relevância. As concentrações de Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb e Zn 
são também signifi cativas, embora que com menor relevância, principalmente 
nas mulheres. Estes resultados confi rmam a necessidade de intervenção por 
parte das entidades competentes, com a implementação de estratégias que 
possam proteger as populações e o ecossistema.

Toda a informação obtida foi integrada com o objectivo de estabelecer uma 
metodologia de avaliação de risco. A combinação dos dados ambientais e 
humanos poderá aumentar o conhecimento sobre o comportamento dos 
elementos tóxicos, o que é essencial para quantifi car o potencial risco na
saúde humana.

Panasqueira mine; Environmental Geochemistry; Potentially Toxic Elements; 
Medical Geology; Risk.

The Panasqueira Sn-W mine, located in Central Portugal, is an active mine. 
The benefi ciation processes at Panasqueira mine have given rise, during a 
long production period, to a large amount of sulfi de-rich wastes, contained in 
several tailings and mud impoundments. Small villages around the mine site are 
present, and the community living in these villages subsists, not only from the 
mining activity, but also from agriculture and cattle breading which justifi es the 
assessment of soil contamination around the Rio and Barroca Grande tailings 
and mud impoundments.

This study, developed on the context of Medical Geology, has as main goal 
to assess human health problems emerging from the contamination of soils, 
waters, stream sediments, dusts and plants on the surroundings of the 
Panasqueira mine. The focus will be placed in the establishment of relationships 
between geochemical environment and the population health through the use of 
dispersion models and GIS based techniques in order to disclose a link between 
spatial distribution of the harmful elements and patterns of the corresponding 
diseases that might occur or will be potentially induce by the local conditions.

Detailed geochemical studies were performed, either in the contamination 
source (tailings) and the surrounding environment, in order to access a better 
understanding of the dynamics inherent to leaching, transport, and accumulation 
of some potential toxic elements in soil and their environmental relevance. The 
metal assemblage identifi ed in soils (Ag-As-Bi-Cd-Cu-W-Zn; PTE’s) refl ects 
the infl uence of the tailings and open impoundments materials, due to several 
agents including the wind dispersion and the subsequent deposition in soils. 
PTE’s and pH presents positive correlation confi rming that heavy metal mobility 
holds a positive correlation with pH therefore affecting their availability.

The assessment of the extent of human exposure to metals in studied populations 
was performed in order to identify the geological agents that might affect their 
health. In order to evaluate the effect of the external contamination on selected 
indexes of internal dose, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb e Zn were determined 
in blood, urine, hair and nail samples from individuals environmentally exposed. 
Results obtained agreed with those reported by environmental studies performed 
in this area, pointing to populations living nearby the mine exposed to metal(loid)
s originated from mining activities. Arsenic was the element with the highest 
increase in exposed populations. The concentration of other elements such as 
Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn was also increased, although at a lesser extent, 
specifi cally in females. These fi ndings confi rm the need for competent authorities 
to act as soon as possible in this area and implement strategies aimed to protect 
exposed populations and the entire ecosystem

All the data was integrated with the objective to establish a methodology of 
risk assessment. The combination of environmental and human biomonitoring 
studies may synergistically increase the knowledge of toxic elements, which is 
essential to assess the potential risks to human health.

1. Introduction

The demand for ore comes from the beginning of mankind, being very important for human 
survival and development. Mining products are vital and indispensable to our modern society 
and contribute signifi cantly to our wealth, being a major economic activity in many developing 
countries (Tauli-Corpuz, 1997; UNEP, 1997; Zobrist and Giger, 2013). Nevertheless mining 
operations, whether in small or large scale, routinely modify the surrounding landscape by 
exposing previously undisturbed earthen materials (Fig. 1.1; Makweba and Ndonde, 1994; 
Zobrist and Giger, 2013). Ore exploitation, extraction and processing activities generate 
substantial amounts of solid and liquid wastes that can have deleterious impacts (UNEP, 
1997; BRGM, 2001; Stumbea, 2013; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013).

Europe has an unquestionable importance in the world economy and mineral extraction plays 
a vital role in the supply, as also in the consumption, of all groups of exploited minerals. 
An European Commission (EU) study evaluated the lower limits of the amount of stored 
waste rock in ten countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) as 4,700 Mt and the processing wastes 
or tailings as 1,200 Mt (BRGM, 2001; Zobrist and Giger, 2013). Mining wastes contain toxic 
chemicals and represent a long-term risk to the surrounding environment and to mankind, 
once they might migrate into human exposure pathways (Kossoff et al., 2012; Stumbea, 2013; 
Caravanos et al., 2013). The extraction of metals from sulfi de minerals results in mine wastes
containing high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE; e.g. As, Cu, Zn, Cd; see 
section 12.1). When these wastes are left in the vicinity of sensitive locations constitute one of 
the greatest threats both for the environment and human health (Moore and Luoma, 1990; 
Boulet and Larocque, 1998; Jung, 2001; Naicker et al., 2003). 

The purposes of environmental analysis are the determination of the background (Bk) and 
natural concentrations of the environment chemicals constituents (background monitoring) 
and the estimation of the harmful pollutants concentration in the environment – pollution 
monitoring (Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). Is important to recognize several parameters: (a)

climatic conditions; (b) geographic and geological framing; (c) existing targets liable to be 
affected – man and his environment; (d) the chemical and mineralogical composition of the 
wastes; (e) the physical properties of the facilities/tailings; (f) the volume and surface occupied 
by wastes; and (g) the waste disposal methods (BRGM, 2001).

Medical geology (MG), an emerging scientifi c scope, studies the impact of geologic 
materials, both in ecosystems and in human health. Some MG studies can be found, related 
with the exposition and associated risk of populations that live in the surrounding of mines 
(environmental exposure). The research on occupational exposure showed that cancer is one 
of the most serious risk, once workers may develop the disease many years after the exposure 
(Stephens and Ahern, 2001). Bunnell (2004), referring to the recommendations of the MG task 
force, states that there is an urgency of detailed studies, as well as their quality improvement 
and connection between geological and medical data. Although MG is still recent, there are 
some pioneer works, especially in mining areas: (a) in Lavrion (Greece), there was established 
the correlation between soil metals content and cancer risk on miners (Karachaliou et al., 
2007); (b) the Iron Quadrangle (Brazil) presented high positive correlation between the As 
results in urine and the As soils content (Matschullat et al., 2000; Figueiredo et al., 2004, 
2007); (c) studies in Almadén (Spain) and Terlingua (USA) indicate that the calcination of Hg 
mine waste may lead to increased Hg concentrations in the human body, especially through 
the ingestion pathway (Gray et al., 2004, 2010); (d) in Baia Mare (Romania) the studies showed 
some correlation between mine dusts and chronic respiratory diseases of the populations 
(Popescu et al., 2003, 2004); (e) in northern Tanzania the studies allowed to conclude that the 
risk of Hg contamination in miners is very high (Straaten, 2000); (f) in south China heavy metal 
(HM) contamination of food crops grown around the Dabaoshan mine posed a great health 
risk to the local population through consumption of rice and vegetables (Zhuang et al., 2009); 
(g) in Korea the populations living on the surroundings of an Au-Ag abandoned mine present 
a probable possibility of about 3 cancer patients by each 1,000 people, a carcinogenic risk 
exceeding the acceptable (Lim et al., 2008); and (h) in a gold mine (China) the farmland topsoil 
is contaminated in different levels (Yang et al., 2013).

Land pollution due to mining activities is a major issue in many countries and Portugal is no 
exception (Santos Oliveira and Ávila, 1995, 2003; Valente and Leal Gomes, 1998; Santos 
Oliveira el al., 2002; Antunes et al., 2002; Pinto et al., 2004; Ávila et al., 2005, 2008a; Bobos 
et al., 2006; Luís et al., 2009; Carvalho et al., 2009, 2012; Gomes et al., 2010; Grangeia et al., 
2011; Candeias et al., 2011a, b; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005, 2013). Portugal holds a rich and 
complex geology, which gives a considerable mineral potential that resulted in a long mining 
history and legacy. 

This thesis, developed on the scope of Medical Geology, is focused in Panasqueira mine 
(W–Sn; central Portugal), a location chosen due to its past and present activity – in labor for 
over 110 years; by the existence of small villages near the mine site, which depend of the land 
and water use (water supply, agriculture, husbandry, fi shing and silviculture) and also by the 
presence of the Zêzere river (Ávila et al., 2008a).

The Panasqueira deposit contains signifi cant amounts of wolframite, arsenopyrite, cassiterite 
and chalcopyrite (Thadeu, 1951) and is considered the biggest W–Sn deposit of the Western 
Europe. The ore deposit of Panasqueira is a classic example of postmagmatic ore classifi ed 
as a hydrothermal mineralization associated to the Hercynian plutonism, with unusually large 
size crystals (Kelly and Rey, 1979; e-Ecorisk, 2007).

The long history of exploitation and ore treatment operations in the Panasqueira mine are 
testifi ed by the presence of huge tailings and other debris. The piles (Rio tailing ~1.2 Mm3; 



5Part I – Approach
1. Introduction

Barroca Grande tailing ~7.0 Mm3) and the open air impoundments (Rio mud dam ~0.7 Mm3; 
Barroca Grande with two mud dams ~1.2 Mm3) are exposed to the atmospheric conditions, 
being altered by chemical, mineralogical, physical and geotechnical causes. On the top of 
the Rio tailing, an arsenopyrite stockpile (~9,400 m3) was deposited and remained exposed 
until June 2006 when was capped with geotextile and layers of clay (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Rio 
tailing is located on the left bank of the Zêzere river, the main watercourse of the area, that 
feeds Castelo de Bode dam (located 90 km downstream Rio tailing), which is the main water 
supplier of Lisbon, where about 1/3 of the Portuguese population lives and works.

Understanding the geochemical processes which control precipitation and dissolution 
of secondary minerals in abandoned sulfi de mines is crucial for the elaboration of models 
which predict the environmental impact of such sites (Gieré et al., 2003). Metals/metalloids 
can be dispersed downstream due to the weathering and erosion processes of the tailings. 
Thus, the extent and degree of HM contamination around the mines varies depending upon 
geochemical characteristics and mineralization of the tailings. High concentrations of HM’s 
can be found in and around abandoned and active mines due to the discharge and dispersion 
of mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops and stream sediments (Lee et al., 2001; 
Jung, 2001; McKenzie and Pulford, 2002; Witte et al., 2004). This will “eventually” lead to 
a loss of biodiversity, amenity, and economic well-being, posing a potential health risk to 
residents in the vicinity of the mining areas (Verner and Ramsey, 1996; Lee et al., 2001; Wong 
et al., 2002; Galán et al., 2003). 

The effect of Panasqueira mining activities and the metals release from acid mine waters to 
water courses is dynamic and actual (e-Ecorisk 2007; Ávila et al., 2008a,b; Ferreira da Silva 
et al., 2013 in section 12.5; Coelho et al., 2013 in section 12.5). Percolation of rain waters is 
responsible by the tailings slag dissolution, resulting in acid mine drainage (AMD). This may 
be a serious threat to the surrounding populations (Barroca and S. Francisco de Assis (SFA); 
Fig. 2.1).

AMD is a well-known international environmental problem related with both ongoing and 
abandoned mining operations. The generation and discharge of AMD with low pH and 
containing high concentrations of dissolved metals and metalloids may seriously disturb the 
water quality. The key to understand mining effects depends directly on understanding the 
processes that produce AMD. Sulfi de waste materials when exposed to air and water, give 
rise to the oxidation of metals, through chemical, electrochemical, and biological reactions, 
forming ferric hydroxides and sulfuric acid and leading to the generation of acid mine 
drainage with high contents of metals and sulfates, related to the sulfi des alteration, and 
whose equilibrium only depends on its solubility (Cohen and Gorman, 1991; Merson, 1992; 
Evangelou and Zhang, 1995; Larocque and Rasmussen, 1998; Soucek et al., 2000; Blowes 
et al., 2003; Nieto et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2013). Additionally erosion of exposed soils, 
extracted mineral ores, tailings, and fi ne material in waste rock piles can result in substantial 
sediment loadings to surface waters and drainage routes.

Soil is not only a part of the ecosystem but also plays a basic role for humans, since the 
survival of mankind is tied to the maintenance of its productivity (Kabata-Pendias and 
Mukherjee, 2007). As a direct result of the mining activities soils are, generally, disturbed over 
considerable areas. Human health and environmental risks from soils generally fall in two 
categories: (1) soil contaminated from chemical spills and residues; and (2) contaminated soil 
resulting from windblown dust (Ettler et al., 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012; Kíbek et al., 2010; Šráek 
et al., 2010; Vítková et al., 2010). Fugitive dust can pose signifi cant environmental problems

at some mines. Tailings in particular can be a potent source of fi ne particulates. The inherent 
toxicity of the dusts depends upon the proximity of environmental receptors and type of ore 
being mined. High levels of As, Pb, and radionuclides in windblown dust usually pose the
greatest risk. 

The soil fi ne fraction is usually enriched in metals, due to the relative large surface area of 
fi ne particles for adsorption and due to metal binding to iron and manganese oxides and to 
organic matter (Rasmussen, 1998; Yukselen and Alpaslan, 2001). The sorption-desorption soils 
characteristics generally take control of the mobility and availability of HM’s (Krishnamurti et 
al., 1999). Heavy metal availability in soils depends on their parameters, being among them the 
soil organic matter (SOM) and pH (Antoniadis et al., 2008). Soil pH was found to play the most 
important role in determining metal speciation, solubility from mineral surfaces, movement 
and bioavailability of metals due to the strong effects on solubility and speciation of metals 
in soils (Mühlbachová et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2010; Zeng et al., 2011). Several laboratory 
experiments have shown that HM mobility and availability have a negative correlation with pH 
(Sukreeyapongse et al., 2002) Also Oliver et al. (1996), Braillier et al. (2006) and Du Laing et 
al. (2007) revealed that metal mobility and availability increases with the decrease of soil pH, 
thus enhancing the uptake of HM’s by plants and thereby posing a threat to human health 
(Zeng et al., 2011).

Human exposure to hazardous elements may have different pathways, through the ingestion 
of plants for human consumption cultivated on the contaminated soils and/or through dusts 
inhalation/ingestion, being especially important in children by the hand-to-mouth practices. 
Soils contaminated with chemical spills and residues at mine sites may pose a direct contact 
risk when misused as fi ll materials, ornamental landscaping, and/or soil supplements. 
According to several authors (Chen et al., 1997; Bosso and Enzweiler, 2008; Douay et al., 
2008a; Roussel et al., 2010; Juhasz et al., 2011; Ettler et al., 2012) the studies dealing with the 
bioavailability and bioaccessibility of metals/metalloids contaminants in highly-polluted soils 
are extremely useful to understand the possible effect on biota, and particularly on human 
health due to the exposure to those contaminants (Bosso and Enzweiler, 2008; Douay et al., 
2008b; Chen et al., 2009; Banza et al., 2009; Roussel et al., 2010; Juhasz et al., 2011; Ettler 
et al., 2012;). 

Exposure to increasing amounts of metals and metalloids in environmental and occupational 
settings is a reality worldwide, though with different contours, affecting a signifi cant number 
of individuals. Most metals and metalloids are very toxic to living organisms and even those 
considered as essential can be toxic when in excess. They can disturb important biochemical 
processes, constituting an important threat for human health. Major health effects include 
development retardation, endocrine disruption, kidney damage, immunological and neurologic 
effects, and several types of cancer (Mudgal et al. 2010). It is useful the identifi cation of the 
potential threats to human health and natural ecosystems (Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). It 
is also essential the quantifi cation of all the types of risks and the determination of the total 
risk of the exposed populations through oral intake, inhalation and dermal contact of metal/
metalloids (USDoE, 2013). Risk assessment is typically a multistep process of identifying, 
defi ning, and characterizing potentially adverse consequences of exposure to hazardous 
materials (USDoE, 2013). According to the Toxic Substances Portal (http://www.atsdr.cdc.
gov/, 2013) Ag, As, Cd, Cu, W and Zn are known to be toxic to humans, being arsenic and 
cadmium classifi ed as human carcinogens. Some studies also considerer that Bi causes 
acute toxicity (WHO, 2013; DACAE, 2007).

1.1. Thesis structure

This thesis is composed by three main parts, described as follows:

Part I – Approach composed by three chapters: (1) Introduction, which outlines the 
investigation; (2) Characterization of the study area, with a complete description of location, 
climate, geomorphology, geological framing, soils, hydrology, fl ora, history and mining activity, 
and environmental impact; and (3) Materials and methods, describing the types of samples, 
sampling collection, preparation and analysis methods applied, and also data analysis 
techniques used.

Part II – Results and discussion includes the scientifi c research articles (published, submitted 
to international referred journals and in progress manuscripts) developed during this PhD 
studies. The analysis, discussion and conclusions are provided as performed in the papers. 

The present study gives special attention to the surroundings of Panasqueira mine geochemical 
environment and inhabitants health (S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca villages) by taking in 
consideration several media samples: superfi cial soils, 15 cm depth soils, superfi cial waters 
and stream sediments, vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters and street dusts, 
as represented in Fig. 1.2. Additionally two other locations were selected considered as not 
affected by the mine pollution (Casegas and Unhais-o-Velho villages; see section 12.2) in order 
to compare the results. A related biological study was conducted on the same populations 
considering blood, urine, nails and hair samples (Coelho, 2013). Using several methods and 
data analysis techniques the results obtained were integrated.

2. Study area

2.1. Location

The study area covers ~32 km2 and includes S. Francisco de Assis, Barroca Grande, Dornelas 
do Zêzere, Barroca and S. Martinho villages (Fig. 2.1). The area was selected aiming to 
determine the environmental impacts and human health risk on the surrounding populations 
of the Panasqueira mine (Sn-W). The Panasqueira mine, active for over 110 years, is located 
in Central Portugal (Castelo Branco and Coimbra districts) approximately 300 km NE from 
Lisbon, 200 km SE from Porto and 35 km W from Fundão (Fig. 2.1a to c). The Panasqueira 
mining concession occupies an area of ~21 km2, being in Barroca Grande village (Table
2.1; Fig. 2.1d) where the mining facilities and offi ces are currently located. In addition Casegas 
(NE from Panasqueira) and Unhais-o-Velho (W of the mine) villages were considered as 
background areas, due to their location (section 12.2) and prevailing wind direction (NW–SE; 
Fig. 2.1e).

Due to the metals price fl uctuation the demography of the Panasqueira mine surrounding 
villages suffered big variations (Table 2.2). During World War II (WWII) more than 11,000 persons 
worked directly for the mining company, a period considered has the “golden years” of
this mine.

2.2. Climate

The annual average temperature is around 12 ºC, ranging from 30 ºC (summer) to 0 ºC 
(winter). The data obtained by the Fundão Meteorological Station between 1958 and 1980 
classifi es the local weather, according to the Köppen Climate Classifi cation System, as a 
temperate wet climate with a long dry and hot summer (http://snirh.pt/, 2010). The mean 
annual rain precipitation is 1,200–1,400 mm, with normal snow fall above the 700 m. The

evapotranspiration is ~1,080 mm (Ávila et al., 2008a). Table 2.3 shows the frequency, mean 
velocity and power fl ux of the wind in Barroca Grande at different heights (Costa, 2004; Costa 
and Estanqueiro, 2006 a,b), and Fig. 2.1e presents the prevailing wind directions on the top 
of Barroca Grande tailing and in a mountain 800 m north of the mine – preferential wind

2.3. Geomorphology

The study area is located between the S. Pedro de Açor, Estrela and Gardunha mountain ranges, 
W from the Cova da Beira central Portuguese depression, 20 km SW from Serra da Estrela, the 
highest mountain of Portugal mainland (1,993 m high). The Panasqueira region presents an 
irregular topography with steep slopes (some with ?40%) characterized by a compact valley 
system combined with several water streams which most of them are dried, except during the
rainfall season.

In particular, the study area ranges in altitude between 350 m (SE of the mine) to 1,083 m (on 
the NW corner of the mining concession), with an average altitude of 700 m (Reis, 1971). 

2.4. Geological framing

Geologically Portugal is divided in two major sets, the Hesperian Massif (HMf) and the 
Epi-Hercynian. The fi rst can be separated in subsections (Fig. 2.1a): (a) the Galicia – Trás-os-
Montes Zone; (b) the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ); (c) the Ossa-Morena Zone; and (d) the South 
Portuguese Zone. The Panasqueira mine is located in the CIZ, one of the most important 
European metalogenic regions.

The geology of the Panasqueira mining area has been studied by numerous authors (e.g. 
Thadeu, 1951; Bloot and De wolf, 1953; Clark, 1964, 1970, 1994; D’Orey, 1967; Marignac, 
1973; Kelly and Rye, 1979; Bussink, 1984; Polya, 1987, 1988, 1989; Polya et al., 2000; 
Foxford et al., 1991; Noronha et al., 1992, 1999; Lourenço, 2002, 2006; Cavey and Gunning, 
2006; e-Ecorisk, 2007; Ávila et al., 2008a). There are also geological data available in several 
unpublished reports requested by the mining companies during the pastyears.

The predominant country rock of the Panasqueira area consists on a folded metasedimentary 
sequence, the Beira Schists formation (BSF), a several thousand meters thick sequence 
of fl ysch-type units primarily composed of graywackes and shales (Pre-Cambrian to 
Carboniferous; Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979; Sousa, 1985; Foxford et al., 1991).

2. The study area

Fig. 2.2. Geological cut of panel 4 of level 2 in Barroca Grande mine where is possible to observe the magmatic 
intrusion (adapted from Thadeu, 1951 and Jaques Ribeiro and Gonçalves, 2013).

This greisened cupola is composed of about 40% of muscovite and 60% of quartz (Bussink, 
1984). The joint systems produced during the HO activities controlled the emplacement of 
this post-tectonic granite batholith, which forms part of the southern fl ank of the Hercynian 
granitic complex from northern Portugal. Authors attribute to this granitic intrusion the main 
source of the mineralized fl uids responsible for the wolframite veins system (Thadeu, 1951; 
Foxford et al. 1991; Polya et al., 2000). According to Kelly and Rye (1979) the morphology 
of the Panasqueira ore veins suggests a primarily dilatational structure formed by the strong 
intrusion pressure of fl uids due to the crystallization of the granite mass and the volatiles
release (Foxford et al., 1991). An older batholith, located E, present an intrusive sin-late 
tectonic and thought to be responsible by the barren quartz lenses, that rarely exceed 1 m in 
length (D’Orey, 1967).

Drilling holes on the lower fl anks of the granite cupola suggest that it may send out several 
sill-like apophyses toward its base, where it ultimately fl ares out into a larger underlying mass 
(Kelly and Rye, 1979). Above the greisened cupola a silica cap takes place (~14 m thick and 
53 x 73 m in plan) with sharp contacts with the schists and the underlying granite, composed 

The Panasqueira district was affected by the Caledonian (CO), Hercynian (HO) and Alpine (AO) 
orogenies. During the CO the BSF was warped into gentle folds with predominant trending 
axes NNE and ENE (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979). During the early compressive stages 
of the HO the same rocks were regionally metamorphosed and compressed, subjected 
to low-grade metamorphism (greenschist facies with chlorite-sericite; late Precambrian to 
Cambrian) and compressed into a series of moderately tight NW trending folds (Kelly and 
Rey, 1979). The strong compression towards the close of the HO is considered responsible for 
the schistosity and the system of faults of the Beira series, near vertical and with NE trending 
foliation (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979). The numerous faults with NE–SW (for example 
the Cebola fault, located NW from the mine, and the 8E fault) and N–S directions existing 
on the Panasqueira mining district are considered as a consequence of the AO (Reis, 1971). 
These are not related with the mineralized veins associated to the previous HO activities. The 
joint system linked to the AO is fi lled with gouge or carbonates and disseminated sulfi des 
(Bloot and De Wolf, 1953; D’Orey, 1967).

The intrusive rocks are an important feature of the Panasqueira mineralization. Although 
no granite crops out the district, in 1948, the underground works exposed a blind granite
greisened cupola (200 m depth) on the Barroca Grande section (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2; Thadeu, 
1951; Clark, 1964; Kelly and Rye, 1979; Bussink, 1984).

mainly of coarse, milky quartz with smaller amounts of muscovite and occasional patches of 
wolframite, arsenopyrite and other trace minerals. This silica cap appears to be a hydrothermal 
fi lling with mineralogy essentially of a submarginal ore, not a magmatic or metasomatic body 
(Kelly and Rye, 1979).

Although the extent of the granite body is still unknown drill hole data suggests that in the 
immediate vicinity of the Barroca Grande mine, the upper granite surface, formed at least by one 
cupola, has approximately 1 km wide, NW trending ridge, sinking SE parallel to the emerging 
spotted argillaceous shales (Hebblethwaite and Antao, 1982; Polya, 1987). The extension of 
the ridge over a distance of at least 5 km is inferred from the surface distribution of contact 
metamorphosed schists (Polya, 1988). This granite, that suffered extensive hydrothermal 
alteration, shows an unbroken crystallization sequence from magmatic, through endoblastic 
(two-mica with K-feldspar mega crystals up to 1 cm or more size), to hydrothermal conditions 
(Clark, 1964). The granite loses is porphyritic texture upward, grading into an equigranular, 
medium-grained greisen, altered to a quartz+muscovite+albite±topaz assemblage with 
accessory wolframite, cassiterite and sulfi des (Polya, 1988). Polya (1988) reported the studies 
of Kelly and Rye (1979) and Bussink (1984) determining high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of around 
0.713, with peraluminous composition and normative corundum, allowing to be classifi ed, 
according to the Chappell and White (1974) terminology, as a S-type granite.

According to Thadeu (1951) and Kelly and Rye (1979) this granite was intruded after the main 
compressive stage of the HO. Clark (1970) dated the Panasqueira granite muscovite, from 
the crosscutting mineralized veins, by the potassium-argon technique, with 289 to 290±10 
millions of years (My), confi rming the HO age of this cupola (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Arthaud 
and Matte (1975) dated the granite, by the Rb–Sr method, with 289±4 My, while the fractures 
episodes of the Beiras region were developed 310–270 My ago (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). 
This conclusions are coherent with the studies performed by Marques et al. (2002), dating the 
faults set, by the K–Ar techniques applied to the muscovite, with 312 My. 

The regional metamorphism converted the thinner sediments in biotite-chlorite shales and 
fi lites and the more arenaceous units in dark, fi ne-grained quartzites. In BSF occurs several 
pods, lenses and small vein masses of white barren quartz without wolframite but with minor 
chalcopyrite, galena and pyrite (Thadeu, 1951; D’orey, 1967; Jaques and Gonçalves, 2013). 
Those were probably sweated out by the time of regional metamorphism. These quartz masses, 
known as “seixo bravo”, are commonly aligned with the vertical foliation being crosscut by the 
later mineralized veins (Thadeu, 1951; Kelly and Rey, 1979).

The basic igneous rock dikes are commonly found on the underground works. The dolerite 
dikes that may occupy the original existent faults, vertical to sub-vertical and striking N–S, 
with lengths up to 1 km and thickness ranging 0.5 to 3 m, being the majority ranging 1 to 1.5 
m. The rock is fi ne to very fi ne grained, with dark grey color, with a sub-concoidal fracture, 
chiefl y composed of labradorite and amphibolitized pyroxene. Thadeu (1951) associated this 
dolerite dikes with the CO decompression stage, once are cut by the mineralized vein system 
and have no infl uence on the mineralization. Later, Thadeu (1977) attributed to these dikes 
a late Hercynian age, once they are undeformed and apparently unaffected by the regional 
metamorphism and yet altered by a metamorphism contact, associated with the granite 
emplacement (Kelly and Rye, 1979).

Before the discovery of the Panasqueira granite cupola a set of thin, commonly greisenized 
aplitic dikes were found (Barbosa, 1944). These acid rocks, younger than the hydrothermal 



15Part I – Approach

ore veins but older than the dolerite dikes, are considered as penecontemporaneous with the 
cupola, due to their mineralogical and textural similarity (Thadeu, 1951).

The emplacement of the Hercynian batholith leads to thermal contact metamorphism, 
producing an aureole of spotting on the schists. According to D’orey (1967) the spots were 
caused by the clotty development of incipient chlorite, biotite, chiastolite and cordierite. Better 
defi ned elliptical spots, composed by biotite and chlorite, are found in the more argillaceous 
shales (see section 12.3). The evidence of contact metamorphism on the spotted argillaceous 
shales veins confi rms the existence of two basic fl ows in the HMf, one earlier and one later 
the Hercynian granitization (Thadeu, 1951; Silva and Baranda, 1997). 

Several authors studied the country rock near the veins and all agree with the tourmalinization, 
with or without sericitization or silifi cation plus apatite and minor sulfi des, on the rock along 
the sides of the veins, as a result of wall rock alteration. This common border of the veins 
near the cupola, ranging from few centimeters to 15 cm thick, rich in tourmaline, gives place 
to more abundant sericite and/or quartz far from the cupola (Thadeu, 1951; Clark, 1964; 
Kelly and Rey, 1979). Also apatite was found in the rock as a result of the wall rock alteration, 
but only appears occasionally (D’Orey, 1967). According to Clark (1964) the mineralization 
is considered to have been the immediate result of the gresenization and silifi cation of the 
parent granite. The veins internal fabric and contact associations indicate the formation of the 
internal material by open-space fi lling, not by replacement processes (Kelly and Rye, 1979). 
The composition of the arsenopyrite, blende and pyrrhotite in the apical zone of the granite 
suggest the intrusion at ~700 ºC under a confi ning pressure of 500–1000 bars (Clark, 1964).

According to the studies developed by Thadeu (1951), confi rmed by Jaques and Gonçalves 
(2013), the study area of the present work is divided in three general geological sets: (a) the 
spotted argillaceous shales; (b) the argillaceous shales and quartzites; and (c) argillaceous 
shales, quartzite and conglomerates (Fig. 2.1).

2.4.1. Panasqueira mineralization

The ore deposit consists on several of near-horizontal hydrothermal quartz veins (Fig. 2.3), 
sharply crosscutting the steep bedding and schistosity of the host rock and the Panasqueira 
granite cupola (Kelly and Rey, 1979), with three main directions: (a) NW–SE direction, and 
dipping 10º SW, locally known as “normal veins”; (b) direction SW–NE dipping 6–9º SE, known 
as the “western veins”; and (c) a less important system, the “fi lões Galo”, dipping 30–50º 
SE and striking SW–NE, located in the east part of Barroca Grande section, connecting the

fl atter economic veins (Kelly and Rey, 1979; Reis, 1971). According to Jones (1937) differential 
strains gave rise to the infl exion being relatively tight; the greater the warping the tighter 
the infl exion, unless the strains were relieved by fracturing. Such fracturing may explain the 
occasional steeper “Galo” system (D’Orey, 1967).

The Panasqueira deposit is estimated with approximately 2500 m in length by a variable 
width of 400 to 2200 m, continuing 500 m in depth (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). Hundreds 
of fl at veins are known, with lengths up to 200 m or reduced to only 2 m, with more or 
less uniform thickness, from millimeters up to 1.5 m (Bussink, 1984) crosscutting the steep 
bedding and foliation of the country rocks (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The economic veins are 
vertically separated by intervals of schists containing numerous unopened and unmineralized 
joints of the same set. These mineralized quartz veins are usually wedge out as “eel-tails” (Fig. 
2.4) sometimes converging to each other or fi nishing as long and straight quartz and mica 
strings (Kelly and Rye, 1979).

A general summary of the deposit formation was described by Breiter (2001): (a) intrusion and 
building of the granite dome causing some intersections where the residual magma intrudes; 
(b) fl uids ascension to the roof from the deeper part of the granite pluton and after into some of 
the non-opened joints – the fl uids greisenized the interior of the granite dome and some of the 
granite sills; and (c) after opening the major number of the fl at joints, fl uids migrated outside 
the granite building the subhorizontal ore veins. The spatial distribution of the mineralized 
veins occurs as traced by Thadeu (1951; Fig. 2.1). Snee et al. (1988) used muscovite selvages 
that occur as vein precipitates, with accurate 40Ar/39Ar age dating techniques. The results 
aged the veins between 296 to 274 My, whereas muscovite of the greisen cupola was aged 
292 My (Foxford et al., 1991).

The paragenesis of the Panasqueira mineralized veins is complex due to four main factors: 
(a) several minerals (i.e. muscovite, quartz and pyrite) were already in the sequence and 
precipitated in a recurrent form; (b) the repetition may be simple, e.g. a hand specimen of 
homogeneous quartz could present a very complex internal form with microscopic inclusions 
of several minerals in different moments; (c) no single mineral or event of the paragenesis is 
completely reliable as a positive time marker; and (d) the large extent, discontinuous access 
and complex geometry of the veins turns diffi cult to establish the physical continuity of a given 
mineral over large distances (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The differences between the paragenetic 
explanations, with different consecutive stages of mineral deposition, might be explained by 
these conditions. Nevertheless, four phases of mineral formation are generally accepted by 
the majority of the authors that studied the deposit. Kelly and Rye (1979) and Correia and 
Naique (1998) described the paragenesis, subscribed by Banks et al. (1999) and Breiter (2001) 
(Table 2.4; Fig. 2.5).

adapted from Kelly and Rye, 1979).

The most economically important phase is the oxide-silicate stage due to the wolframite 
and cassiterite formation. Furthermore, it occurs the formation of almost all quartz (90% of 
the vein matter), muscovite (that locally line the vein walls), tourmaline, topaz and most of 
arsenopyrite, molybdenum, bismuth and the new phosphates recognized in Panasqueira 
mine (Kelly and Rye, 1979). According to Polya (1988) the major elemental chemistry of the 
Barroca Grande section wolframite is uniform, reproducing the uniform chemical composition 
of the ore forming fl uids from the main period. The second stage started by the late pulse 
of arsenopyrite deposition and is characterized by the deposition of pyrite (I), pyrrhotite, 
chalcopyrite (I), sphalerite (I), minor stannite and rare galena. The sphalerite was originally an 
iron-rich (Zn,Fe,Cu,Sn)S solid solution which later exsolved variable amounts of chalcopyrite, 
stannite and pyrrhotite. The sulfi des of this stage were formed both by open-space fi lling 
and by replacement of minerals from the preceding stage (Kelly and Rye, 1979). The third 
stage is characterized by the pyrrhotite alteration, the formation of pyrite, marcasite and, 
mainly siderite. Pyrrhotite shows all forms of pseudomorphism by attack of marcasite and 
pyrite (II). Minor amounts of stannite (II) and galena (II) were formed during this strong siderite 
development period, and noticeable amounts of chalcopyrite. The chalcopyrite (II) differs from 
the material of the main sulfi de stage (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Other minerals also occur in minor 
amounts. During the late carbonate phase the end of the Hercynian mineralized deposition 
is characterized by the formation of carbonates, mostly calcite and dolomite. This last one is 
a combination of crystals with siderite nucleus and fl uorite. Calcite was the latest mineral to 
form in a signifi cant amount. The persistent sulfi de minerals continued to precipitate in small 
quantities during this stage, being several generations recognized in the underground works 
(Kelly and Rye, 1979; Silva and Rebollar, 1997). Thadeu (1951) proposed a division of the 
mineralized areas of the Panasqueira mining site, based on is local geology knowledge, veins 
sets system and major joints (Fig. 2.1d). 

To date sixty fi ve minerals were identifi ed in the Panasqueira deposit, from which around 
twenty are commonly found in underground works (Table 2.5). Many minerals are very rare and 
can only be observed under microscope (e.g. Panasqueirite and Thadeuite).

Kelly and Rey (1979), Reis (1971) and D’Orey (1967), after Thadeu (1951), observed, collected 
and studied, with different techniques, specimens of the ore bearing veins in the Panasqueira 
mine. Their conclusions for the Barroca Grande section are described as follows.

The quartz fi lling (SiO
2
; ~90% of the vein matter) of the mineralized veins is essentially milky 

and dense, presenting euhedra martite on the center vein. Veins with cassiterite present

quartz less milky, being sometimes almost hyaline. Cassiterite (SnO
2
; Fig. 2.6) is typically 

well crystallized and occurs near the top and bottom walls of the veins. Cassiterite euhedra 
is a primary mineral, existing also secondary cassiterite at the upper exploration levels of 
Barroca Grande section, as a result of the stannite breakdown. The cassiterite content in the 
ore-bearing quartz veins tends to increase with depth and towards the greisened cupola. This 
mineral is often associated with minor muscovite crystals, rutile and wolframite.

Fig. 2.7. Panasqueira wolframite: (a) Flat lying white quartz veins along the 
wall of a stope with abundant black crystalline wolframite. The vein is 
approximately one meter wide at its thickness; and (b) detail of wolframite 
crystals in a quartz vein (source: Cavey and Gunning, 2006).

Panasqueira mine (source: http://www.dakotamatrix.com/, 2013).

Wolframite minerals ((Mn,Fe) WO
4
) occur as black blades up to 15 cm long, frequently forming 

radial clusters with several crystals, generally projected from the mica wall in to the quartz 
core (Fig. 2.7). In thicker veins the small wolframite blades are highly corroded by quartz, 
occurring isolated in the inner vein sections. The wolframite vein content is directly related 
to the presence of thick mica selvages close to the wall. If associated with cassiterite, an 
intergrowth of the two minerals is a very common feature. With the exception of quartz and 
siderite, wolframite is not easily replaced or corroded by other minerals. Wolframite is intensely 
fractured, never fi lled with arsenopyrite or pyrrhotite but often by siderite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, 
marcasite and bismuthinite. Nevertheless, it does not present extensive replacement. The 
chemical analysis revealed 12.8–18.9% MnWO

4
, being considered has ferberite.

The most abundant mineral present in the vein system is Arsenopyrite (FeAsS; Fig. 2.8a), 
occurring in both fi ne grained masses and with euhedra crystals, commonly with several 
centimeters long, and usually very fractured and fi lled with chalcopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, 
bismuth, bismuthinite, siderite and minor quartz. Arsenopyrite is earlier than the precipitation

of pyrrhotite and, despite his precipitation, is prior than the crystallization of wolframite. The 
major formation occurred after the deposition of that mineral. The bismuthinite, chalcopyrite 
and sphalerite strongly decompose the arsenopyrite, while wolframite, quartz and siderite just 
slightly destroy the crystals shapes. The native bismuth is contemporaneous with the later 
period of arsenopyrite deposition. Its composition is of 34.90–35.61% As, being richer in As 
than ideal arsenopyrite. 

Chalcopyrite (CuFeS
2
; Fig. 2.8b) is an abundant mineral with a long period of deposition, occurring 

as segregation of emulsion bodies in sphalerite or as massive grains contemporaneous 
with sphalerite and fi lling interstices of earlier minerals. It also occurs in fi lling fractures of 
arsenopyrite, wolframite, cassiterite, and sporadically replaces siderite. Chalcopyrite and 
sphalerite often replace and corrode arsenopyrite. Chalcopyrite also comprises corroded 
residuals of pyrite-marcasite aggregates and replaces muscovite. Is common to fi nd large 
masses of chalcopyrite, with exsolution bodies of pyrrhotite, stannite and sphalerite, fractured 
and fi lled with siderite and pyrite-marcasite. The chalcopyrite free of exsolution bodies 
penetrate the fractures of earlier minerals especially wolframite, arsenopyrite and sphalerite. 
In the veins more distant from the greisen cupola the chalcopyrite grades to isotropic dark 
yellowish to brownish phase.

Sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S; Fig. 2.9a) is 
not a very important mineral in this 
paragenesis. Usually occurs fi lling the 
fractures of wolframite, arsenopyrite 
and earlier minerals in a smaller 
extent than later chalcopyrite and 
siderite. Stannite (Cu

; Fig. 2.9b) 

is a common brownish anisotropic 
mineral under the microscope, 
although is a minor constituent of the 
ore, occurring in exsolution bodies in 
chalcopyrite and sphalerite.

Stibnite (Sb

as blades or acicular crystals

associated with the late minerals

stage of the veins (marcasite, pyrite, carbonates) but being part of the high temperature 
wolframite-cassiterite-quartz group. Small blebs and round grains of rutile (TiO

2
) intergrowth 

with wolframite and cassiterite, being more common in veins far from the greisened cupola. A 
mineral that occurs through all the vein system is pyrrhotite (Fe

1-xS
). Due to instability under the 

new conditions of acidity and temperature, the earlier abundant mineral naturally broke down 
into the more stables pyrite, marcasite, magnetite and occasionally hematite.

Native bismuth (Bi) and Bismuthinite (Bi
2
S

3
) are minor minerals closely associated and well 

distributed over the Panasqueira deposit, forming isolated replacement patches in early 
wolframite and/or arsenopyrite. Bismuth is the fi rst to be formed, and is contemporaneous of 
the later stages of the arsenopyrite deposition. When this sulfoarsenide is deposited starts 
the bismuthinite precipitation, replacing the earlier bismuth. The precipitation of these two 
minerals was completed with the end of the sphalerite formation. Also silver (Ag) and gold (Au) 
occurs, being Ag more common.

21Part I – Approach
2. The study area

Galena (PbS; Fig. 2.10a) is considered a minor mineral in the Barroca Grande section. This 
mineral replaces the chalcopyrite and especially sphalerite, being earlier than siderite. One 
of the most important gangue minerals and the most important carbonate, is siderite (FeCO

3
; 

Fig. 2.10b) once it replaces and corrodes earlier minerals and its deposition followed an 
important period of ore fracturing. It’s a common mineral fi lling the fractures of the wolframite, 
arsenopyrite and sphalerite polish sections. Siderite corrodes arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, 
stannite, bismuth and bismuthinite, showing a selective preference for the replacement of 
pyrrhotite. Acanthite (Ag

2
S) occurs as a primary solid inclusion in siderite, with depositional 

temperatures of about 270 ºC.

pyrite, siderite and other iron oxides, or occurs as a result of reactions of siderite with 
wolframite and cassiterite. Scheelite (CaWO

4
) is considered the result of supergene alteration.

Apatite (Fig. 2.12) generally presents perfect crystals with variable colors occurring in 
the mica halos and in vughs. This mineral corrodes and is corroded by muscovite, being 
pene-contemporaneous with wolframite and cassiterite, but earlier than the later phase of 
arsenopyrite. Calcite and minor ankerite (the late carbonates), along with minor pyrite, were 
the last primary minerals to precipitate. Late calcite occur fi lling fractures in the later quartz or 
coating all the other minerals, including siderite.

2.5. Soils

According to Cardoso et al. (1971) the Leptosols (eutric) are predominant in the study area, 
coexisting with Cambisols (humic). Leptosols show little soil formation processes leading to 
very shallow depth to the hard bedrock. For this reason, these soils are very susceptible of 
erosion, desiccation or waterlogging, especially in regions like Panasqueira with markedly 
topography and severe climatic conditions. Cambisols are characterized by a defi cient layer 
of accumulated clay, humus, soluble salts, or Fe and Al oxides. These types of soils have at 
least 8% clay and a minimum thickness of 15 cm.

According to the Portuguese Soils Map (MAP, 1980a) and the Land Use Map (MAP, 1980b) the 
soils occurring in the study area are mainly classifi ed as a mixture of lithosoils (shallow soils) 
of shale and graywacke along with Mediterranean brown soils from shales and graywackes. 
Due to the irregular topography, with steep slopes between 9 and &gt;25% (some with ?40%) 
the soils are narrow. The natural small thickness of soils and their very gravelly and clayey 
characteristics do not allow a normal agricultural development. On the bottom of the valleys 
the soils are developed mostly on gravel beds of shales and graywackes.

Along the Zêzere river, water streams and villages, the terrain is composed mainly by alluvial 
soils with median texture, with slopes of 0 to 5%, allowing the development of agriculture 
(Corrêa de Sá et al., 1999). 

The acidity of these soils is due to the characteristics of their original materials. Soils developed 
under the infl uence of tailings or acidic waters, show decreasing pH. Their materials include, 
among others, sulfi des typical from the local tailings (e-Ecorisk, 2007).

2.6. Hydrology

The municipality of Covilhã is part of the Zêzere river sub-basin, belonging of the Tejo river 
basin. Zêzere river is the most important water stream in this area. The river starts in Serra da 
Estrela and crosses the SW section of the mining concession (direction ENE–WSW) with the 
Rio tailing on his left bank (Figs. 2.1d and 2.13), fl owing for 200 km to the Tejo river. In Tomar 
municipality the Zêzere river is intercepted by the Castelo de Bode dam, a very important 
water reservoir once is the main supplier of water to the Lisbon metropolitan region, where 
1/3 of the Portuguese population lives.

On the Panasqueira mining concession is possible to identify six small water streams, dry 
during hot periods, all converging to the Casinhas stream (formerly known as Bodelhão 
stream), an affl uent of Zêzere river (Corrêa de Sá et al., 1999). Casinhas stream bypasses 
the south corner of Barroca Grande tailing and fl ow through a valley to the Zêzere river
(Fig. 2.1d).

2.7. Flora

The fl ora of the study area is composed mainly by Pinus pinaster, Eucalyptus globulus Lab., 
Arbutus unedo, Castanea sativa and also by typical Mediterranean heather. The area is not 
favorable for the growth of fl ora, once large areas are occupied by tailings and present hard 
slopes. According to Coelho (2009) the main plants existing in Rio and Barroca Grande 
tailings are: Anarrhinum bellidifolium (L) willd (Fig. 2.14a), Agrostis curtisii kerguélen (Fig. 2.14b), 
Halimium lasianthum subsp.alyssoides (Fig. 2.14c), Conyza sumatrensis sp (Fig. 2.14d), Rumex 
induratus sp (Fig. 2.14e) and Erica australis L. (Fig. 2.14f).

Carla Candeias | 2013

The former company concessionaire of the Panasqueira mine, the Beralt Tin &amp;amp; Wolfram, made 
an agreement, in 1984, with Portucel Company (Portuguese paper manufacturer corporation) 
allowing the exploration of trees on 5.2 km2 of the superfi cial mining area. This agreement 
allowed the management, reforestation and maintenance of the local forested area and also 
the paper production by the Portuguese company, with 1/3 of the profi ts returning to the 
mining corporation.

2.8. History and mining activity

There are evidences that exploration in the Panasqueira area started with the Moors and 
probably the Romans. In Vale da Ermida, Fontes Casinhas and Courelas sections of the mine, 
there are long, ramifi ed and explored underground galleries believed to be ancient. Because 
small piles of rejected wolframite are common is this mines, investigators concluded that the 
exploration was essentially for Tin.

Panasqueira mineralization became recognized with the discovery of a shining heavy black 
specimen on the forested hills. This wolframite piece was sent to Eng. Silva Pinto – a Lisbon 
university mineralogy teacher. By 25 November 1898 it was published the fi rst Portuguese 
Panasqueira mine exploitation permission for the society “Almeida, Silva Pinto &amp;amp; Comandita”. 
During this period the sections of Panasqueira and Rio (formerly known as Cabeço do Pião) 
were only superfi cial explored, having a manual mill plant (Leal, 1945).

Shortly after the beginning of the mining exploitation, in 1901, the concession was bought by 
the Portuguese consortium “Henry Burnay &amp;amp; Companhia, Lda”, who started the underground 
works in Panasqueira and Rio sections. Additionally it was built a mechanical mill plant on 
the Zêzere river left bank (Rio section), once the river provided the water for the mechanical 
works. In November 1909 forty one tones of wolfram were shipped to Lisbon (Leal, 1945).

In 1910 the British company “Wolfram Mining and Smelting Company Limited” acquired 
the Panasqueira mining district, defi ning the Panasqueira mining district with eleven mine 
concessions and 21 km2 (e.g. Rio, Panasqueira, Barroca Grande, Vale da Ermida, and Vale 
das Freiras sections). By 1928 the new company “Beralt Tin Wolfram Limited” enhanced the 
machinery and the underground works. In 1912 it was produced 266.5 t in the Panasqueira 
section and 13.5 t in the Rio sector, both with 65% WO

3
, leading to the Rio section closure 

(Leal, 1945). Between 1915 and 1917 the monthly production was ~30,000 t once the tungsten 
prices rose dramatically with World War I (WWI; 1914–1918). During WWI approximately 800 
workers were on underground works and 1,000 inhabitants from all surrounding parishes 
explored the mountains for “Kilo” – exploitation of superfi cial ore (Fig. 2.15). The end of WWI

works – “Kilo” works (source: Leal, 1945).

lead to the mine closure. For the following years mining works occurred in discontinuous 
periods: (a) 1920 to 1923; and (b) 1924 to 1926 (Leal, 1945).

The exploitation in Barroca Grande, Vale das Freiras, Alvoroso and Corga Seca sections 
started in 1928. By this year in order to do the benefi ciation of all the ore a new equipped mill 
plant was built in Rio sector. An aerial tramway (5.1 km; Fig. 2.16a) was constructed to enable 
the extracted rock transport from the exploration sites to Rio milling plant.

Fig. 2.16. (a) Extracted materials being transported by the rope tramway to the Rio benefi ciation plant, after the 
year 1928 and (b) the Rio mill plant, around 1945 (source: Leal, 1945).

WWII raises the tungsten price radically (1934), leading to the development of underground 
and milling works – Barroca Grande was connected to the Panasqueira section for enhanced 
production. The number of underground workers increased from 750 to 5,790, and others 
5,000 for “Kilo”. The amount of ore shipped reached ~300 t/month, being 1943 the year with 
greater production with a total of 2,520,871 t WO

3
 (Bloot and De Wolf, 1953). During these 

years ~1,000 t/day of rock was extracted from underground works, and the rejected materials 
deposited in Rio tailing (Figs. 2.13 and 2.16b). The eminent end of WWII and the Portuguese 
alliance with England (1944) lead to the prohibition of exploitation and exportation of wolfram, 
resulting on the mine closure (Leal, 1945).

After the end of WWII (1945) the mining exploitation restarted with improved techniques 
since the tungsten price was decreasing. The mechanization of the exploitation and milling 
processes was enhanced allied with the growth of tungsten prices caused by the Korean War 
(1950). Between 1957 and 1965 it occurred a reducing of rates and production. The tin rich 
areas were also explored in an attempt to recover from the low WO

3
 values. The company 

starts storing the ore to be sold during a value growth (Corrêa de Sá et al., 1999; Lourenço, 
2002). The production from 1947 to 2004 was of 94,456 t WO

3
, 4901 t Sn and 28,924 t Cu, 

recovered from more than 27,453,330 t of rock extracted (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The 
amount of rejected materials resulted, consequently, in huge tailings and mud dams (see 
section 2.9).

The new company “Beralt Tin &amp;amp; Wolfram, Ltd” was followed by “Beralt Tin &amp;amp; Wolfram Portugal, 
S.A” (1973), being 20% Portuguese (Banco Nacional Ultramarino), and the mechanization of 
the processes was enhanced, new underground extraction levels were opened and the actual 
mining method was implemented in veins over 20 cm in width – the room and pillar procedure 
(Bussink, 1984; Corrêa de Sá et al., 1999; Lourenço, 2002). This exploitation method is applied 
in rooms of 5 m in width by 2 m in high, and pillars with 11x11m initially and cut in three 
phases until a 3x3 m section (Fig. 2.17; Dinis da Gama et al., 2002). In each shearer operation a 
single vein is explored. Once only 20% of the extracted material have signifi cant ore materials 



26 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach

the benefi ciation process is very important (Martins, 2009). The annual production in 1978 
was 1,450 t WO

3
 (75.5% with very high quality), 62 t cassiterite concentrates (72% Sn), 1,101 

t chalcopyrite concentrates (22% Cu) and variable amounts of silver (Kelly and Rey, 1979). 
Thadeu (1971) reported that in 1970 around 868 g of Ag per ton of chalcopyrite concentrate 
were produced. According to Bussink (1984) until 1984 four levels of extraction existed, 
namely Level 0 (675 m), Level 1 (615 m), Level 2 (562 m) and Level 3 (530 m).

“Minorco SA” mining company (1990) kept the mine closed until 1996. The Canadian company 
“Avocet Ventures” bought the mine and improved the milling processes. Rio facilities were 
transferred to Barroca Grande, where all the exploitation took place and, since 1971, the 
Heavy Media Separation (HMS) operated (Reis, 1971). Rio mill plant was only performing 
a simplifi ed separation on the thinner ore materials received by the aerial ropeway, already 
selected (Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The tramway had the transport capacity of 40 t h-1, using 
100 aluminum containers of 400 kg material loads each. Reis (1971) reported a recovery of 
94.1% WO

3
, 65% Sn and 85% Cu in Rio mill plant, from a total of 158,780 t of benefi ciated 

ore, using 2.5 m3 water (Zêzere river) for each ore ton. In 2005 the price of tungsten rose 
dramatically and subsequently the production rate on the mine was increased (Cavey and 
Gunning, 2006). In October 2007, the mine owner changed once more to “Sojitz Beralt Tin &amp;amp; 
Wolfram (Portugal) SA” and an offi cial video (http://www.portugalindustry.com/, 2013) reports 
355 workers, and over 3,000 km of open fl ow underground galleries.

According to Cavey and Gunning (2006) the actual sampling method for estimating the ore 
distribution is used for several decades and has proved reliable and accurate. The formula is 
applied to the measured area and mine grades are reported in terms of recoverable wolfram 
per horizontal square meter of vein and, subsequently, converted to recoverable wolfram per 
ton of ore. The measuring consists on the portion of the wolframite crystals amount within 
the vein, since the areas of the wolfram are accumulated for a specifi c length of exposed vein 
and recorded along with the length sampled and the average vein thickness (Mendes, 1958).

The actual method used in the mill plant is explained as follows: (a) initial crushing; (b) HMS; 
(c) main crushing; (d) sands cycle; (e) mud cycle; (f) fi nal concentration; and (g) copper cycle 
(Fig. 2.18; Martins, 2009).

Through the years, as stated before, the exploitation and benefi ciation methods had evolved 
leading to different grain sizes and mineralogical compositions through the horizontal and 
vertical axis of the tailing bodies. The different rejected materials are broadly classifi ed as: (a) 
coarse steriles from the mine (&lt;2.5 mm to 3.0 mm); (b) coarse tailings (steriles) from the HMS 
(c) sand (&lt;3.0 mm to &gt;0.5 mm); and (d) mud and slush (&lt;0.5 mm of which 41%&amp;lt;0.025 mm; 
Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; e-Ecorisk, 2004). The fi rst three types are disposed in tailings, 
while the (d) type is discharged in open air impoundments built specifi cally for that propose 
(e-Ecorisk, 2004).

2.9. Environmental impact

The most notorious evidences of the exploitation for the last 110 years are the Panasqueira 
mine tailings: (a) Vale da Ermida – 100,000 m3; Panasqueira – 1,000,000 m3; (c) Rio – 1,200,000 
m3; and (d) Barroca Grande – 7,000,000 m3 (e-Ecorisk, 2004). These last two tailings are 
located inside the study area of this research and disclose an environmental concern.

The Rio tailing (Figs. 2.13, 2.16, 2.19) is located above the left bank of the Zêzere river. As 
stated before it was raised by various means over 9 decades and abandoned since 1996, 
presenting potential dangers. Until the early 60’s the rejected dry fi ne fraction was deposited 
with the coarse materials (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999). This tailing is characterized by 32 
to 36º slopes and shows an average 90 m altitude from bottom to top, although maximum 
values of 200 m are noticed on some tailing points, having an extension of 1,900 m along the 
Zêzere river (Fig. 2.19c). The superfi cial layer (0–10 cm depth) is composed by oxidized coarse

and angular materials (2–12 mm Ø), bigger than Barroca Grande tailing debris, once it was 
subject to less effective milling techniques. Under this depth the percentage of clay materials 
is more signifi cant, increasing the internal cohesion and the capability of retaining humidity 
and percolating waters. Time leads to consolidation and oxidation of the materials in depth 
with consequent increase of resistance, enhanced by the discontinuity of material deposition 
(Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, 2001; e-Ecorisk, 2007).

A seepage collection channel was installed on the bottom of Rio deposit. Even though the 
channel system appears to work, materials have been creped down both by erosion and 
action of the Zêzere river superfi cial waters (Fig. 2.20; Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; e-Ecorisk, 
2007). According to Gilchrist and Mahmoud (1999) during rainfall periods the river is often at 
fl ood stage and much or all of the collection system is inundated by the river. The percentage 
of annual seepage volume collected by the channel system may be surprisingly small, 
generating AMD with pH ranging from 2.5 to 3.0. The same authors detected a potential risk 
for failure, especially on is meridional section. In case of collapse large amounts of rejected 
materials will be released into the river basin, resulting in acid generation with very expensive

and exceedingly diffi cult recovery of the river bed (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, 
2001). Also, Crosby (2001) considers the existence of a great environmental threat due to a 
potential Rio tailing failure, mostly during heavy rainfalls and possible seismic events.

A study conducted by IST (2001b) in Rio tailing considered this location as the main 
environmental hazard of the Panasqueira surroundings. Topographic cuts of the deposit 
determined the tridimensional stability and quantifi ed ~3 Mm3 in volume and ~6 Mt of weight. 
Slopes were considered as stables; nevertheless some sliding might occur in fragile areas 
by infl uence of percolation waters. Drillings holes on the tailing showed materials highly 
compacted with very fi ne particles – about 52%&amp;lt;200 mm, producing internal cohesion and 
humidity retention capability (e-Ecorisk, 2007).

A geochemical and geophysical study of the Rio tailing internal structure and geochemical 
distribution revealed high water content, migration of fi ne particles and low resistivity that 
might be enforced by heavy rainfall and lead to possible sliding of the slopes (Grangeia et al., 
2011). According to Gonçalves (2010) exists high concern with the Rio abandoned structures, 
sliding on the slopes and corrosion. The author points clear signs of negative environmental 
impacts on the area between Barroca Grande and Rio tailings.

On the top of the Rio tailing (very close to the slope edge) an arsenopyrite stockpile (~9,400 
m3; Fig. 2.21) was deposited and remained exposed to the atmospheric conditions until 2006. 
By this year agglomerated rejected material was capped with geotextile and clay layers, as 
proposed by IST (2001a). The stockpile content have concentrations of: (a) Ag = 124 mg kg-1; 
(b) As = 210,000 mg kg-1; (c) Cd = 3,057 mg kg-1; (d) Cu = 1,426 mg kg-1; (e) Fe = 19.8%; (f) 
Mn = 410 mg kg-1; (g) Pb = 1,450 mg kg-1; (h) Sn = 433 mg kg-1; (i) W = 2,989 mg kg-1; and (j) 
Zn = 460 mg kg-1 (e-Ecorisk, 2007). The seepage water collected near this arsenopyrite store 
shows high conductivity and also high concentrations in trace metals, revealing continuous 
leaching instigated from the sulfi des oxidation (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Fig. 2.21 (from June 2013) 
shows sliding slopes on the edge of this stockpile. If disruption occurs the stockpile could be 
transported down the hills directly to the Zêzere river (Ávila, 2007a).

Another important deposit exists inside the study area of this research – Barroca Grande tailing 
(Fig. 2.22) considered as stable although is much bigger than Rio (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 
1999). This pile is adjacent to a small but perennial fl owing stream that drains to the Zêzere 
river, the Casinhas stream, posing a low to moderate threat to the environment due to the short 
distance of Zêzere river and the typically coarse nature of the piles (Crosby, 2001). According 
to Gonçalves (2010) Barroca Grande tailing is the most worrying area since includes the 
entrance of the mine and the milling facilities. This deposit presents hard slopes with no

vegetation, which could stop materials sliding, being more substantial during rainfall season. 
The tailing is mainly composed by quartz, shale and graywacke particles along with some 
granite from the underground works on the greisened cupola. These slags are commonly 
used on the roads construction. The same author considered this use particularly danger 
once the thinner particles present &gt;25% As (Gonçalves, 2010). 

Between 2002 and 2007 the Panasqueira mine was subject to an International study – 
e-Ecorisk project (Contract n.º EVG–CT–2002–00068). The environmental geochemical 
studies revealed the existence of water pollution on the Zêzere river generated by Rio tailing. 
The rainwater runoff at the surface and percolates inside the tailings leaching the materials, 
being the sulfi des (with As, Cu, Pb, Zn, Sb, Bi, ...) the most easily oxidized and producing 
AMD (Fig. 2.20). To prevent the entrance of AMD on the water courses two water treatment 
plants (WTP’s) were constructed in Panasqueira: (a) Barroca Grande (Salgueira WTP) for the 
acid effl uents pumped from inside the mine and mill plant and also the infi ltration waters from 
the bottom of the tailing; and (b) Rio WTP (old and obsolete) used for the tailing percolation 
waters and waters collected on the seepage collection channel. The treatment processes 
starts with the removal of solids (muds) from the acid effl uents being followed by addition of 
calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)

2 
promoting pH increase (from ?3 to ~7) and metal precipitation and 

fl occulation, according to the “Dégramont” system based on the “Ciclator” (Reis, 1971). After 
this actions clean waters are conducted to the ore dressing plant or discharged directly in the 
(a) Casinhas stream or in the (b) Zêzere river (e-Ecorisk, 2007). Dinis da Gama et al. (2002) 
reported a mean fl ow of 810.22 L s-1 water pumped from the inside of the mine to the Salgueira 
WTP in January 2002. The WTP average fl ow ranges from 1,000 m3 h-1 (winter) to 250/300 m3 
h-1 (summer); since the maximum water capacity is of 300 m3 h-1, a signifi cant portion of acid 
waters are conducted directly to the Casinhas stream without any pretreatment during the 
rainfall season (Gonçalves, 2010). Crespo (2006) proposed the construction of a new WTP, 
three times bigger (900 to 1,000 m3 h-1). There were evidences that the Salgueira WTP was 
being renewed in June 2012.



31Part I – Approach
2. The study area

The muds rejected and deposited on the Salgueira WTP and also the muds excluded from the 
ore mill plant are deposited in open air impoundments, to dry and percolate in depth. Once 
the base of these dams is not completely waterproof the impoundments create a signifi cant 
contamination threat to the underground and superfi cial waters and consequently to the 
surrounding soils due to AMD generation (Gonçalves, 2010; Ávila, 2008a). 

In Barroca Grande and Rio tailings three dams exist: (a) one located at middle high of the Rio 
deposit; (b) one deactivated in Barroca Grande pile; and (c) one active also on the Barroca 
Grande tailing. The Rio mud dam (~731,034 m3; e-Ecorisk, 2004) placed near the former 
milling facilities (deactivated since 1996) on the SE area of the tailing, contains typically silt 
and fi ne sand grains with gray color (Fig. 2.23a). According to Crosby (2001) although the 
slimes appear to be loose to well cemented, there are evidences of muds dumped down the 
slope over the tailings.

The two mud dams located in Barroca Grande tailing have ~1,193,885 m3 (e-Ecorisk, 2004), 
being one older and deactivated, located on the left base of the tailing, considered has 
geotectonically stable. The active dam is positioned above the slag materials and is feed with 
~100 t/day (Fig. 2.23b; e-Ecorisk, 2007). 

Table 2.6 shows the contents of samples collected in stream sediments, alluvium, dams and 
soils of Panasqueira area (e-Ecorisk; 2007).

in range from 0.76 to 265.3 for the soil samples, 31.9 to 2,251.1 for Rio mud dam and 30.4 
to 1,783.9 for the Barroca Grande tailing. At this stage should be noted that EI above 1 is 
considered higher than the safe level. Fig. 2.24 identifi es very high EI values at S. Francisco de 
Assis village and also in other areas. The EI results from the alluvium samples range from 2.9 
to 19.4, mainly due to the high concentrations of As, Pb and Cu. These high values might be 
explained by the erosion of the tailing leading to mechanical dispersion. Results show that the 
tailings and mud dams are enriched in metals at levels considered toxic for the ecosystems 
(e-Ecorisk, 2007).

The Rio and Barroca Grande open air impoundments present very high concentrations of As, 
Cd, Cu and Zn, much above the ones established by the Portuguese legislation (Decree-Law 
306/2007 part II). The fact that the sulfi des (arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) present 
in the dams materials are exposed to the atmospheric conditions leads to a continuous 
oxidation and production of secondary minerals like scorodite (FeAsO

oxyhydroxides in the tailing basement. Arsenic can also be removed from the solution and 
precipitate as scorodite. This mineral is the most common iron arsenate associated to arsenic 
deposits as a leaching product. Its presence controls the arsenate levels in waters draining 
As-rich ores. Scorodite formation involves arsenopyrite oxidation at low pH and high iron and 
arsenate activity, and it only dissolves with increasing pH, meaning As contents are kept low 
while solution’s pH is still low (e-Ecorisk, 2007).

The sample collected in the arsenopyrite stockpile from Rio tailing site (As = 210,000
mg kg-1; Cd = 3,057 mg kg-1; Cu = 1,426 mg kg-1; Fe = 19.8%; Mn = 410 mg kg-1; Pb = 
1,450 mg kg-1; and Zn = 460 mg kg-1) showed high concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb 
and Zn. The seepage water (sample 12) collected near the arsenopyrite stockpile showed 
high conductivity and also high concentrations in trace metals, revealing that metals are 
suffering continuous leaching originated from the sulfi des oxidation which is taking place in
those tailings.

The coating (iron precipitate) was collected in the main river nearby water samples 10 and 11. 
The coatings formation were originated by the pH increase, verifi ed when seepage waters, 
with high levels of dissolve iron, mix with the more oxygenated river water (Carpenter et al., 
1975; e-Ecorisk, 2007). Comparing the chemical results of the coating sample (As = 37,000
mg kg-1; Cd = 423 mg kg-1; Cu = 1,626 mg kg-1; Fe = 25.1%; Mn = 712 mg kg-1; Pb = 139
mg kg-1; and Zn = 1,288 mg kg-1) and water sample 6 (Table 2.7) collected nearby, it seems that 
the decrease of heavy metal contents in the water, namely As, Cu and Cd, is associated to the 
coprecipitation with Fe and Mn oxides infl uenced by pH increment (e-Ecorisk, 2007). The same 
authors concluded that the ferruginous crust also reveals high contents of Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd and 
As (As = 40,000 mg kg-1; Cd = 453 mg kg-1; Cu = 3,305 mg kg-1; Fe = 12%; Mn = 572 mg kg-1;

Pb = 319 mg kg-1; and Zn= 663 mg kg-1) and confi rms the transfer of these elements from the 
tailing and mud impoundment. During runoff events, rain water dissolves secondary minerals 
producing strong acid waters. During dry seasons these acid waters evaporate progressively 
and originate effl orescent sulfate salt crusts (jarosite and melanterite (FeSO

4
.7H

2
O)) indicating 

the presence of an extreme acidic environment. The presence of melanterite was observed 
in Rio tailing basement. According to Frau (2000), the precipitation and dissolution of such 
secondary minerals are processes strongly infl uenced by seasonal wetting and drying cycles. 
The melanterite salt crust easily dissolves during rainfall events (e-Ecorisk, 2007).

Ávila et al. (2007a; 2008b) also studied the Panasqueira mining activity infl uence on the 
surrounding environment, and concluded that the stream sediments are good receptors of 
most metals, while the waters are the main responsible for the metal lixiviation, what was 
confi rmed by the high chemical concentrations on samples under the mine infl uence. The 
results showed that the treatment water systems existing in Rio tailing are not effective, once 
there are high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn and some Cd on the Zêzere river.

Ávila et al. (2007b) studied the heavy metals distribution on the stream sediments and alluvium 
on the surrounding of the Panasqueira mine, and concluded, according to Birke and Rauch 
(1993), that the stream sediments refl ect the mean geochemical environmental conditions, 
leading to the identifi cation of geochemical anomalies and the natural enrichments. The stream 
sediments and alluvium samples collected allowed to verify the higher concentrations on the 
sediments than the background levels, with focus to the enrichment of 117x of As, 23x of 
Cd, 22x of Cu, 6x for Zn and 37.5x for W (elements from the tailings lixiviation). In conclusion, 
the authors considered that the slag from the tailings and open air impoundments are the 
main sources of contamination on the surrounding area of the Panasqueira mine, being the 
exploitation and benefi ciation processes the responsible factors for the high concentrations 
of As on the stream sediments.

Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013; see section 12.5) also studied this region, in particular the S. Francisco 
de Assis soils. This analysis allowed to identify a contaminant group of elements associated 
to the mining activities (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn, Y, W and Zn) and the identifi cation of the 
locations that require intervention or remediation. This study also classifi ed As and Zn as the 
variables that present high to very high contamination factors on the S. Francisco de Assis 
soils. A Master thesis by Coelho (2009) that studied the vegetation of the Rio and Barroca 
Grande tailings concluded that the existing plants presented high concentrations of As Cd, 
Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe and Mn, refl ecting their substrate. 

The subsidence of the Panasqueira mine was also studied by Dinis da Gama et al. (2002). 
The authors concluded that is directly related with the presence of main faults and to the 
existence of water. The rotational and translation movements of the blocks are conditioned 
by the number of faults surrounding the blocks, being the ones with over four faults the most 
affected. The abatement of the lower levels, caused by the large open spaces generated 
by the exploration has direct infl uence on the superior levels. The amount of water on the 
underground works also affects positively the subsidence.

Some villages might be directly affected by the present and past mining activities, such as 
S. Jorge da Beira, Barroca, S. Francisco de Assis and Dornelas do Zêzere (section 12.2) were 
the populations are dependent on the agriculture and cattle breeding activities. Coelho et 
al. (2011b) conducted a study with the inhabitants of the S. Francisco de Assis village and 
concluded that the population is experiencing genotoxic and immunotoxic effects originated by

the exposure to environmental contamination resulting from the mining activities, since almost 
all studied biomarkes were signifi cantly altered in exposed population when compared with 
a control population living and working outside the mine. These genotoxic and immunotoxic 
effects may lead to several diseases including cancer. Coelho et al. (2013; in section 12.5) 
also concluded that the populations working and living in the surroundings of Panasqueira 
mine are exposed to several metal(loid)s originated by the mining activities. In this work, it 
was possible to verify that the most important exposure appeared to be to As, particularly in 
individuals exposed through the environment. Exposure to other elements such as Cr, Mn, Ni, 
Pb, Se, and Zn also occurs but not at the same extent (amount of element/time of exposure). 
The results indicate that the environmentally exposed group is more affected, specifi cally 
females, once they presented signifi cantly higher values of the most toxic elements, i.e. As, 
Cr, Mn, and Ni. 



3. Materials and methods

3.1. Samples description and sampling

3.1.1. Soils

Trace elements concentration in soil samples is dependent on the parent rock, physical and 
chemical properties, and also anthropogenic activities. The soil study allows the delineation of 
contaminated areas. According to Alloway (1995), one of the main anthropogenic soil pollution 
sources is the mining industry. Soil contamination has been identifi ed has a major threat to 
the sustainability of the soil resources in Europe by the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection 
(European Comission, 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2009). Thus when the pollution represents risks 
for the environment and/or human health, soil remediation should be undertaken. 

In this study, 122 samples from the upper soil horizon (identifi ed as Soil
0 
– topsoil samples) 

were collected within a soil sample grid of 400 x 400 m (Fig. 2.1d) in order to characterize 
the superfi cial contamination. To evaluate the extent of the contamination in depth, once 
precipitation percolates through soils and may transport soluble HM with the soil solution 
(Brummer, 1986), and simultaneously to attempt the identifi cation of geogenic markers, 116 
soil samples were collected from a depth up to 15 cm (identifi ed as Soil

15
 – subsurface soil 

samples). The different number of samples between topsoil and the subsurface soil samples 
is due to the incipient and lithic soils derived from metasediments substrate, which turned 
impossible to collect six of the 15 cm depth samples.

To establish the local geochemical background 47 soil samples (Bk) were also collected 
outside of the contaminated area (Casegas area; section 12.2). 

On each sample location the superfi cial debris and vegetation were removed, after what 
the samples were collected. Soil samples were preserved in labeled polyethylene bags and 
georeferenced in UTM coordinates with a GPS unit (Fig. 3.1).

3.1.2. Rocks

For a better understanding of the entire set of samples under study also local representative 
rock samples were collected: (a) two argillaceous shales (Sch

 and Sch

2
); (b) one spotted 

argillaceous shale (Sch
sp

); (c) one quartzite (Qz); and (d) one spotted quartzite (Qz

3.1.3. Superfi cial waters and stream sediments

Superfi cial waters and stream sediments are extremely important to study, associated with the 
environment surrounding characteristics, the enhanced description of a polluted area. These 
types of samples also show a good correlation with the parent rock allowing the streams 
characterization.

Surface waters and stream sediments sampling sites were chosen in order to evaluate the 
infl uence of the tailings and AMD on the nearest streams and to distinguish the contamination 
diffusion in the Zêzere river. The samples locations were: (a) Casinhas stream (CS1 to CS8 
and CFB); (b) Barroco stream (B1 to B3); (c) AMD seepage waters from Rio tailing (SP1 to 
SP3) and one sample from the mine adit at Barroca Grande (BG); (d) one sample on Zêzere 
river collected from the Rio tailing (ZZ) and one sample after Casinhas stream confl uence with 
Zêzere river (CFZ); and (e) two local background waters (Bk1 and Bk2) collected before the 
Rio tailing (Fig. 3.2).

To evaluate the seasonal variation of the elements concentrations, both in stream sediments 
and in superfi cial waters, the collection occurred in three stages: (1) April 2006 – samples CS1 
to CS3, SP1 to SP3, Bk1, Bk2, BG, ZZ and CFZ (e-Ecorisk, 2007; presented in section 4); (2) 
October 2010 – rainfall season, samples CS1 to CS8, CFB, B1 to B3, SP1, SP3, BG, ZZ and 
CFZ; and June 2012 – dry season, samples CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS6, CS7, CS8, CFB, B1 
to B3, ZZ and CFZ (last two presented in section 5). The collection of some samples was not 
possible due to the seasonally dried water streams or absence of sediments.

3.1.4. Vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters, street dusts and 
survey forms

To investigate the possible environmental contamination on agricultural and residential soils 
of the surrounding villages due to the mining activities, four sampling media were selected 
– vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters and street dusts. At each house/farm an 
additional questionnaire was fi lled, characterizing the family habits and agricultural customs. 
These media constitute the most important means to assess the impact of the anthropogenic 
activities on the different ecosystems, including the public health of the inhabitants. Vegetables 
and rhizosphere soil samples (Fig. 3.4a) will defi ne the extent of local soil contamination and 
the metals transfer processes from soils to the different parts of the plants, once the root

system of the plants remove nutrients from the soil mineral phases. Waters samples (Fig. 3.4b) 
will defi ne the infl uence of soils and human activities in the quality of potable water, for human 
consumption and for irrigation. Finally, the street dusts samples will allow the quantifi cation of 
the wind transfer of the contaminants from tailings and its infl uence in local soil, vegetables 
and air quality.

The collection procedures adopted for these four media and questionnaire were: (a) plants 
(identifi ed by V; specimens Solanum Tubersum Sava commonly known as potato, Brassica 
Olerácea L. usually known as cabbage, Lactuca sativa generally known as lettuce and 
Phaseolus vulgaris ordinarily known as red beans) collected and stored in polyethylene bags 
– collection conditioned to the availability of each plantation; (b) rhizosphere soils (identifi ed 
by Soil

R
) collected on the vegetables locations and preserved as described in section 3.1.1; (c) 

irrigation waters, applying the same techniques formerly described for the superfi cial waters 
(see section 3.1.3) – public water supply network, wells, small water courses, Zêzere river and 
spring water; (d) street dusts (identifi ed by Dust

S
) collected with small brooms and shovels 

on the streets in front of the backyards/farms where soils, vegetables and waters were taken, 
and stored in polyethylene bags for further analyses; and (e) a survey form to understand 
the families uses and also the agricultural practices (see section 12.4). Table 3.1 describes the 
samples collected on each village – S. Francisco de Assis (Fig. 3.5) and Barroca (Fig. 3.6), both 
located inside the study area; and Casegas (Fig. 3.7) located NE from the study area and 
Unhais-o-Velho (Fig. 3.8) located W from the mine (see section 12.2). These last two villages, 
located outside the infl uence of the mine and the prevailing winds, were selected for results 
comparison with the samples under the mine infl uence.

The general characteristics of the study groups are summarized in Table 3.2. Smoking habits 
groups were established as never/ever smokers, with the former group composed of individuals 
that never smoked and the second one of current and ex-smokers. This was due to the fact 
that the number of ex-smokers was extremely high and the majority of these individuals had 
been heavy smokers (Coelho, 2013; Coelho et al, 2012, 2013).

3.2. Samples preparation and analysis

3.2.1. Soils, stream sediments and street dusts

Once on the laboratory soil (topsoil, subsurface soil, rhizosphere soil and background soil), 
stream sediment (from dry and rainy seasons) and street dusts (from S. Francisco de Assis, 
Barroca, Casegas and Unhais-o-Velho villages) samples were dried in an oven at 40ºC, 
homogenized, sieved (&lt;2 mm) and pulverized to&amp;lt;177 ?m in a mechanical agate mill (Fig. 3.9). 
Additionally stream sediments were sieved&amp;lt;63 ?m for X-ray analysis.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis (ICP-MS)

Soil, stream sediments and street dusts samples were submitted to multi-elemental analysis 
in ACME Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited Lab (Canada; http://acmelab.com/). Splits of 0.5 g were

materials (USGS standards) and duplicate samples in each analytical set. The results were 
within the 95% confi dence limits of the recommended values given for this certifi ed material. 
The relative standard deviation (RSD) was between 5 and 10%.

Selective chemical extraction (SCE) in soil samples

Chemical forms of heavy metals in soils directly infl uence their bioavailability and toxicity 
(Zhou and Sun, 2002; Ma and Rao, 1997; Tessier et al., 1979). Trace metals can be transported 
in the secondary geological environment by different chemical mechanisms (Gibbs, 1973): (a) 
in solution or adsorbed on solids, being readily available in these conditions; (b) in organic 
compounds or metallic hydroxides, for which chemical changes are required before they are 
released; and (c) in the crystal structure of some minerals, where they are generally unavailable 
for the ecosystems.

Many schemes of sequential extraction to assess chemical speciation have been developed. 
In these, samples were sequentially treated with different reagents in order that metals 
with different affi nities for the mineral matrix could be liberated (Gómez-Ariza et al., 
2000; Quevauviller et al., 1994; Meguellati et al., 1983; Rapin and Forstner, 1983; Tessier
et al., 1979).

Two representative samples (A1, A2) characteristic from contaminated zones were used 
for the sequential extraction. The soil samples used in the SCE experiments were air-dried, 
disaggregated, homogenized and sieved. A static approach to the leaching was adopted in 
this study. With the static approach, a sample will undergo sequentially a leaching process 
starting with the weakest to the strongest leach with subsequent analysis of each of the 
leachates by ICP-MS.

The fi ne grained fraction of soil samples was submitted to sequential chemical extraction 
procedure in Activation Laboratories Ltd (ACTLABS, see http://www.actlabs.com), accredited 
under ISO 9001 and 9002. Reagents were applied sequentially to the solid phase of selected 
samples, according to their chemical aggressively. The extractable fractions were obtained

by extraction with different solutions: (a) Fraction 1 (F1) – sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH 5) for 
the extraction of exchangeable cations adsorbed by clay and those soluble in water or in 
slightly acidic conditions and co-precipitated by carbonates (the most labile bonded and 
therefore the most dangerous and bio-available for the environment); (b) Fraction 2 (F2) – cold 
hydroxylamine for extracting amorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn oxides (metals bound 
to Fe and Mn oxides that can be released if conditions change from oxic to anoxic state); (c) 
Fraction 3 (F3) – hot hydroxylamine for the extraction of amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides 
and crystalline Mn oxides; (d) Fraction 4 (F4) – aqua regia, for leach sulfi de species (metals 
which may be released under oxidizing conditions) and clay minerals; (e) Fraction 5 (F5) – four 
acids digestion (or total attack) where metals strongly associated with crystalline structures 
of minerals (such as the remaining silicates) will be decomposed (they are therefore unlikely 
to be released).

For Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, W and Zn an internal check on the results was performed by 
comparing the sum of the 5 fractions from the sequential extraction procedure with the total 
amount obtained after hot mixed-acid attack of the same sample. These calculations can be 
used to validate the results and as inter-laboratory comparison. For all the extractions, the 
total of the trace elements in the different fractions did not exceed ±10% of the bulk sample 
which is accepted as satisfactory (Pickering, 1986; Tessier et al., 1979; Yan et al., 1999). The 
relative extraction ratio was also calculated by dividing the element concentration extracted 
by the individual leaching procedure by the concentration extracted by total attack (TA) as 
suggested by Son and Jung (2011).

X-ray diffraction in soil and sediment samples

A total of 28 topsoil samples (&lt;2 mm fraction) and 10 stream sediments samples (&lt;63 ?m 
fraction) with strategic locations were selected. To identify their mineralogical constituents 
they were submitted to X-ray diffraction at National Laboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG – 
S. Mamede Infesta). The mineralogical composition (including effl orescence) was determined 
using a Philips X’Pert MPD machine equipped with CuK? radiation, graphite monochromator, 
automatic divergence slit and 0.5–receiving slit. A step size of 0.05º 2?, a scan setting of 
2–70º 2? and a 10 s counting time were chosen. 

Soil pH

Numerous studies have established that soil pH have a great effect on metal bioavailability 
(Turner, 1994; McBride et al., 1997; Radojevic and Bashkin, 2006). The pH gives an indication 
of the acidity and alkalinity of the soil. Many chemical reactions are pH dependent and 
knowledge of the pH can enable the prediction of the extent and speed of chemical reaction 
(Reeuwijk, 2002). The procedure adopted was modifi ed from the procedure ISO 10390:1994 
Soil. A suspension of soil was made up in fi ve times its volume of a 0,01 mol/l solution of 
calcium chloride (CaCl

2
) in water. The pH was measured using a calibrated pH–meter.

Soil organic matter (SOM)

SOM plays an important role in determining the fate of inorganic as well as organic compounds 
in natural soils (Schnitzer and Khan, 1972; Stevenson, 1982; Yin et al., 1997; You et al.; 1999). 
SOM can be roughly determined by measuring weight loss after burning. Results are typically 
accurate to 1–2% for soils with over 10% organic matter (Reeuwijk, 2002). The procedure 



46 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach
Carla Candeias | 2013

adopted was modifi ed from Reeuwijk (2002). Approximately 5 g of each sieved sample 
(&lt;2 mm) was placed in a crucible and dried at 105°C for 24 hours. After cooling in a glass 
desiccator their weight was determined in a mass balance (resolution 0.001 g). The difference 
of the weights yields the water content of each soil sample. The crucibles were then placed 
in muffl e furnace at 430°C for 20 hours. After cooling in a glass desiccator the weight of the 
samples was determined in the same mass balance. The difference from the dry state yields 
the soil organic matter content (%).

3.2.2. Rocks

About 1 kg of each rock sample was crushed with a jaw crusher. The samples were reduced 
to 250 g by coning and quartering, followed by drying at 40ºC. After homogenization aliquots 
of 30–50 g of each dried sample were powdered in a mechanical agate mill (Fig. 3.10).

HCl–HF to fuming and taken to dryness. The residue was dissolved in HCl. The solution was 
analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The digestion is only 
partial for some S, Cr and Ba minerals and some oxides of Al and Mn. Volatilization during 
fuming may result in some loss of As, Sb and Au. The detection limits for trace elements were 
as follows: 0.1 mg kg-1 for Ag, Bi, Cd, Cu, La, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Th and W; 0.2 mg kg-1 for Co; 
0.5 mg kg-1 for Te and Tl; 1 mg kg-1 for As, Ba, Cr, Mn, Sc, Se, Sr and Zn; 4 mg kg-1 for V. The 
detection limits for major elements were as follows: 0.001% for Na, P, and Ti; 0.01% for Al, Ca, 
Fe, K, Mg; 0.1 mg kg-1 for S. The accuracy and analytical precision of the analytical method 
were verifi ed against standard reference materials (OREAS 24P) and duplicate samples in 
each analytical set. The results were within the 95% confi dence limits of the recommended 
values for this certifi ed material. Overall analytical precision was ±3% for the major and trace 
elements analyzed.

Mineralogical characterization and petrographic study

The mineralogical identifi cation of the mineral constituents of the rocks is the fi rst step of 
the rock analysis and classifi cation. These studies were carried out by National Laboratory 
of Energy and Geology (LNEG – S. Mamede Infesta). After the macroscopic analysis, thin 
sections of each collected rocks were produced, for observation under the optical microscope 
– Olympus BX51. With this procedure is possible to identify the optical properties of the 
minerals, as isotropy, anisotropy, refraction indices, among others.

On another phase of the study a petrographic investigation was carried out on the collected 
rocks, which identify the different mineralogical phases of each sample. For this procedure 
is used the same microscope referred before and the thin sections produced earlier, allowing 
the observation of the mineralogical composition and texture, alteration occurred and fi nally 
the interpretation and classifi cation of each rock.

Once the report presented by LNEG is in the Portuguese language an overview is summarized 
in section 12.3.

3.2.3. Waters

On the laboratory the preserved 500 mL water samples were fi ltered with a 0.45 ?m Millipore 
membrane fi lter, and 100 mL were acidifi ed with concentrated HNO

 and bottled for analysis of 

dissolved trace elements. The acid will avoid the Fe hydroxide precipitation and the alteration 
of the samples due to the presence of biological organisms (Fig. 3.11).

Surface water samples were analyzed without pre-concentration. For these samples a suite of 
dissolved trace 70 elements was performed on water samples by the ACME Anal. ISO 9002 
Accredited Lab (Canada; http://acmelab.com/) – Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce,

of trace elements in acidifi ed waters were all determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma 
Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Reagent blanks and duplicate samples were inserted into 
each batch for quality control (Ramsey et al., 1987). Depending on the concentration levels,

48 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach
Carla Candeias | 2013

typical uncertainties, including all error sources, are less than 6% for the trace elements, and 
between 2% and 7% for the major anions. 

Major anions

The major anions (Cl-, NO
3
-, and SO

4
2-) were analyzed by Ion Chromatography (IC) method, 

as described by Patinha (1996). It was used a Dionex 2000 SPI chromatograph on the 
Geochemistry Laboratory of the Geosciences Department, in Aveiro University. 

Water samples speciation

Inorganic arsenic is a naturally occurring element present in both superfi cial and groundwaters 
as well as in many animals and plants. The presence of arsenic in natural waters is a matter 
of concern concidering the toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity. The environment 
infl uences the oxidation state of the existing As in waters: (a) As(III) and (b) As(V), being the last 
thermodynamically favored. As(III) has higher toxicity to animals and plants than As(V), since 
has the ability of forming complexes with certain co-enzymes. Consequently the importance 
of the speciation of As is high, in order to understand the biological and geochemical behavior 
of this element (Ferreira and Barros, 2002).

The As(III) and As
total

 were determined by Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV) (Ferreira 
and Barros, 2002), using a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). The method requires 
hydrogen chloride (HCl) 1M as electrolyte support and the presence of Cu(II), as it involves 
the preconcentration of a copper-arsenic intermetallic compound at the mercury electrode. 
The determination of As

total
 involves the reduction of As(V) with thiosulfate and the subsequent 

determination of As(III); As(V) is obtained by difference.

In waters infl uenced by mining activities is especially important the quantifi cation of Fe, as it is 
possibly the major constituent in such waters. Aqueous speciation is sensitive to the absolute 
concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III) as well as the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio. Fe(III) precipitates readily, 
forming hydrous ferric oxide, which adsorbs trace metals. Therefore, the mobility and toxicity 
of metals is controlled by the Fe present in those waters (To et al., 1999).

In this study the Fe(III) concentration is obtained by the difference between the concentrations 
of Fe

total
 and Fe(II), being Fe(II) determined by a colorimetric method and Fe

total
 by another 

method such AEOS–ICP or AAS after reduction of Fe(III). In this work, Fe(III), Fe(II) and Fe
total 

were determined by a colour spectrophotometric-Vis method using FerroZine Iron Reagent. 
The method requires preservation of water samples by fi ltration through a 0.2 micron membrane 
and acidifi cation to pH 1 with HCl (0.4% HCl), and storage in the dark (To et al., 1999).

3.2.4. Vegetables

The vegetables were well washed to remove the soil particles, separated by their constituent 
organs (roots, stem, leafs and fruits, if any), separately weighted, oven dried at 40ºC until a 
constant weight was attained, weighted and milled &amp;lt;177 ?m for chemical analysis (Fig. 3.12).

Inductively coupled plasma-emission spectrometry analysis (ICP-ES)

The fi ne grained fraction of each part of the vegetables was submitted to multi-elemental 
analysis in ACME Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited Lab-Canada. A 0.5 g split was leached in hot

(ICP-ES) for 35 chemical elements. Included in this analytical package were Ag, Al, As, Au, Ba, 
Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sr, Th, Ti,

The accuracy and analytical precision were determined using analyses of reference materials 
(standards C3 and G-2) and duplicate samples in each analytical set. The results were within 
the 95% confi dence limits of the recommended values given for this certifi ed material. The 
relative standard deviation was between 5 and 10%.

3.2.5. Biological samples

Sample collection and the preparation for quantifi cation of total concentration in all fi ve 
matrices were performed as described in Coelho et al. (2013a,b). All samples were coded and 
analysed under blind conditions. This section content was performed by Coelho (2013) and 
Coelho et al. (2012, 2013a,b).

3.2.5.1. Blood samples (B)

Samples were collected by venipuncture in tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic 
acid (EDTA). Samples were transported under refrigeration and kept at approximately 4ºC. 
Blood samples (1-2 g) were added to 2 mL of HNO

3
 in Tefl on vials and digested for 24 h at

100ºC. After cooling, the digested solutions were diluted with deionized water up to
10 mL in polypropylene tubes for elemental analysis. For microwave digestion, an Anton Paar 
Multiwave 3000 oven, equipped with 16 vessels, was used.

3.2.5.2. Urine samples (U)

First morning urine samples (minimum volume 20 mL) were collected in polyethylene sterile 
bottles. Samples were transported under refrigeration (-20ºC) until analysis. Urine samples 
were defrosted 24 h before the analysis, centrifuged for 3 min at 2500 rpm, and diluted up to 
25-fold with 1% v/v HNO3 for elemental analysis. For As speciation in samples preparation

and analysis followed the procedures described by Batista et al. (2011), with some 
alterations in the reagents and instrumentation described in the section “Speciation of As in
urine samples”.

3.2.5.3. Nail samples

Finger (FN) and toe (TN) nail samples were collected with stainless steel scissors and stored 
in polyethylene bags. Samples were transported under refrigeration (-20ºC) until analysis. 
Fingernail and toenail samples were washed thoroughly following a slightly modifi ed version of 
the protocol described by Slotnick et al. (2007). Visible exogenous material was fi rst removed 
using plastic forceps. Samples were then placed in clean glass vials and sonicated for 5min 
using acetone, rinsed with deionised water followed by acetone, sonicated for 10 min with 
deionised water, then rinsed twice with deionised water, ensuring complete submersion of the 
sample during each step. All samples were oven dried at 60ºC overnight. Samples were acid 
digested using closed vessel microwave assisted heating (Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 oven, 
equipped with 16 vessels). Into each vessel 2 mL of HNO

3
 was added to accurately weighed 

samples (200 mg when enough sample) and left to stand for 1 h before sealing the vessels. The 
microwave heating program was: 100% power (1,200 W), 15 min ramp to 170ºC, held for 10 
min, then held for 20 min at room temperature. The pressure in the system was approximately 
200 psi under these conditions. This method resulted in complete sample dissolution. 
The solutions were transferred to plastic tubes and made up to 5 mL with ultrapure water
for analysis.

3.2.5.4. Hair samples (H)

Hair samples were collected with stainless steel scissors and stored in polyethylene bags. 
Samples were transported under refrigeration (-20ºC) until analysis. Samples were washed 
following a slightly modifi ed version of the protocol described by Schrauzer et al. (1992); this 
involved washing the samples four times with 1% Triton X-100, rinsing once with acetone, 
three times with deionised water, and twice more with acetone. Each sample was washed 
for approximately 30 min (total time) and subsequently all the samples were dried in an oven 
at 70 °C for 2 hours. Samples were acid digested using closed vessel microwave assisted 
heating (Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 oven, equipped with 16 vessels). Into each vessel 2 mL 
of HNO

3
 was added to accurately weighed samples (200 mg when enough sample) and left 

to stand for 1h before sealing the vessels. The microwave heating program was: 100% power 
(1200 W), 15 min ramp to 170ºC, held for 10 min, then held for 20 min at room temperature. 
The pressure in the system was approximately 200 psi under these conditions. This method 
resulted in complete sample dissolution. The solutions were transferred to plastic tubes and 
made up to 5 mL with ultrapure water for analysis.

Metal(loid)s in blood, urine, nail and hair samples

The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instruments used were a 
PerkinElmer Elan DRC II, and a Thermo Elemental X Series. A Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300 
and a Thermo Scientifi c iCAP 6300 duo were used for inductively coupled plasma-optical 
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. Before use and between each batch of samples, 
the polyether ether ketone (PEEK) utensils were thoroughly washed with acid and then rinsed 
with deionised water. For analysis of blood samples In and Sc were the chemical elements 
used as internal standards while Ge and Ir were used for urine, hair and nail samples analysis. 
All reagents used were trace analysis grade or better quality. All aqueous solutions were

prepared using ultra-pure water (&gt;18 ? cm-1). It is important to highlight the fact that for some 
of the elements not all the matrices were analysed.

Determination of creatinine

Creatinine adjustment is routinely used in urine analyses to reduce some factors that are not 
related to metal(loid) exposure, such as urine concentration and urine volume (Hinwood et 
al., 2002). Results of urine samples were adjusted and they are reported as ?g g-1 creatinine. 
Creatinine was measured photometrically using the Jaffe reaction (Roche Diagnostics).

Speciation of As in urine samples

Speciation of As in urine samples analyses were carried out with an inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometer (DRC-ICP-MS ELAN DRCII; PerkinElmer, SCIEX, Norwalk, CT, USA) 
operating with high-purity argon (99.999%; Praxaair, Brazil) in standard mode. The sample 
introduction system was composed of a quartz cyclonic spray chamber and a Meinhard® 

nebuliser connected by Tygon® tubes to the ICP-MS’s peristaltic pump (set at 20  rpm). The 
ICP-MS was operated with a platinum sampler and skimmer cones, both purchased from 
Perkin Elmer. Other instrumental settings and operative conditions are reported in Batista 
et al. 2011. A Perkin Elmer model L-200 LC pump, six-port injector (Rheodyne 9725) with 
a PRP-X100 anion-exchange column (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) comprised the LC system. 
Samples were loaded with a syringe into a 100  ?l sample loop. All separations were performed 
at 25 °C, under isocratic conditions.

The mobile phase, prepared daily, was 10  mM/(98% v/v) + MeOH 2% (v/v), at pH 8.5. Analytical 
calibration standards of As species were prepared daily over the range of 0.0–100.0 ?g L-1 for 
the LC-ICP-MS method by suitable serial dilutions of the stock solution in similar extractor 
medium. The fl ow rate was 1.0  mL min-1. The effl uent from the LC column was directly 
connected to the nebuliser with PEEK tubing (1.59  mm o.d.) and a low dead volume PEEK 
connector. Data evaluation was performed using Chromera® software (version 2.1.0.1631) 
supplied with the instrument, and quantifi cation was based on peak area by external 
calibration. The detection limits were: As(III) = 0.1 ?g L-1, As(V) = 0.2 ?g L-1, MMA = 0.1 ?g L-1, 
DMA = 0.2 ?g L-1, AsB = 0.5 ?g L-1.

 for 24 h, rinsed 

fi ve times with Milli-Q water and dried in a class 100 laminar fl ow hood. All operations were 
performed in a class 1000 clean room and the solutions prepared in the laminar fl ow hood 
(class 100 capable). The high-purity de-ionised water (resistivity 8.2  M? cm) used throughout 
the experiment was obtained using a Milli-Q water purifi cation system (Millipore RiOs-DITM, 
Bedford, MA, USA). All reagents used were of analytical-reagent grade.

Stock solutions (100  mL at 100 mg L-1 as As) of the fi ve different As species were prepared and 
stored in amber fl asks at temperatures below 4°C. As(III) (As

Quality control and quality assurance

Quality control and quality assurance for the quantifi cation of total concentration in all fi ve 
matrices was performed as described in Coelho et al. (2013a,b).

Blood analyses were validated using European Union, Institute for Reference Materials and 
Measurements - Certifi ed Reference Materials (CRMs) BCR 634, BCR 635, and BCR 636. 
Recoveries varied between 81 and 83% and the precision of the method (for Cd and Pb) 
was better than 10% coeffi cient of variation. Freeze-dried human urine CRM from National 
Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan, was used in addition to validating the metal 
quantifi cation in urine samples, this material was also analysed during each analytical run 
as a quality control (QC) sample. Results from CRMs were within the reference range for As, 
Pb and Se. As no nail CRMs were available, the methods for digestion and analysis of hair, 
fi ngernail and toenail samples were validated using a human hair CRM - NCS DC 73347a and 
NCS ZC 81002b human hair (NCS Beijing, China). The CRMs were also used as QC standard 
by digesting a portion with each batch of samples and determining the metal concentration 
along with the other digests. Results from CRMs were within the reference range. Other QC 
measures used in the different matrices included the periodic analysis of suitable standards 
to check on instrument drift and short-term stability.

For As speciation analysis this was performed using a standard reference material from the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (SRM 2670a, Toxic Metals in Freeze-
Dried Urine, high level) were analyzed for total and As species. The obtained values were: 
As(V) = 166.3±3.2 ?g L-1, As(III) = 50±2.5 ?g L-1, MMA = 1.7±0.1 ?g L-1, DMA = 1.1±0.1 ?g 
L-1, AsB = 0.7±0.1 ?g L-1 (Sum of arsenic content = 219.8 ?g L-1 and Certifi ed Value for total
As = 220±10 ?g L-1).

3.3. Data analysis

The data obtained from the different medias samples, allied to the knowledge of the study 
area, were analyzed individually and combined, using internationally accepted methods in 
order to establish the associations between the contaminants and the probability of occurring 
human health problems on the studied populations. The results obtained will be compared 
with international and national reference guide values to identify the contaminated sites and 
anomalous risk areas, both for environment and human health.

The obtained geological data and related interpretations will be confronted with biological 
fi gures (Fig. 3.13) allowing to identify human health risk areas and the anomalous standards 
from different sampled media.

The present thesis was developed in line with the doctorate study on Panasqueira surrounding 
populations “Biomonitoring of environmental contamination resulting from mining activities 
on exposed populations”, from Coelho (2013; UP/ICBAS/INSA). Coelho (2013) aimed to 
evaluate the impact of environmental metal(loid)s contamination in populations living nearby 
and working in Panasqueira mine, through a multistage approach that integrated information

obtained with biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility (Coelho, 2013). A combination 
of both works will possibly allow establishing connections between some chronic diseases 
in the considered populations and the contamination resulting from the local mining industry.

3.3.1. Descriptive analysis

The fi rst stage of a descriptive research is generally the univariate analysis. According to 
Reimann et al. (2008), the environmental analysis should start with the application of appropriate 
graphical tools. Histograms are important indicators of the data distribution, along with the 
use of boxplots, showing the median, skewness and outliers. In addition is also important to 
estimate the mean, variance, and further statistical parameters in order to characterize the 
study data (Filzmoser et al., 2009). For these analysis it was used the Statistica Six Sigma 
7.0© software.

3.3.2. Correlations analysis (r)

The Spearman and Pearson coeffi cients are the most common techniques used to evaluate 
the correlation between two variables. The Spearman method is a non-parametric, while the 
Pearson’s is a parametric method that should only be used with a normal distribution. The 
appropriate statistical tools should be used in data analysis (e.g., robust methods if there 
are still outliers). In both correlation techniques the coeffi cients between variables may vary 
between [-1.00, +1.00], with -1.00 representing a perfect negative correlation, +1.00 a perfect 
positive correlation and 0.00 represents de absence of correlation (Davis, 1986).

In order to determine the extent of the relationship between the elements, pH and SOM a 
Pearson’s correlation was performed (Reeuwijk, 2002). For all the data was ascertain their 
normal distribution by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (? = 0.05) and the Q–Q Plots. The non-normal 
data was subjected to a non-parametric test or converted logarithmically to ensure the 
quality of the results. The correlation coeffi cients were computed using IBM SPSS Statistics
20® software.

3.3.3. Principal component analysis (PCA)

PCA is a method that aid in reducing the complexity of large-scale data sets and is currently 
broadly used in environmental impact studies (Perona et al., 1999) by elucidate relations among 
variables and identifying common underlying processes (Davis, 1973, 1986; Wackernagel, 
1998; Webster and Oliver, 1990). In the present study, factorial analysis, PCA, was performed 
allowing reducing the size of the space of the variables (Massart and Kaufman, 1983). The PCA 
main goal is to provide a small number of independent factors (principal components) which 
synthesize the associations between variables, being the referred factors (or PCs) orthogonal 
linear combinations of the variables. The fi rst PC explains the major part of the total variance 
of the data set, and each successive PC explains a smaller part of the remaining variance. 
The different PCs are then related with common processes that affect the variables through 
expert knowledge of the problem in hand. The number of signifi cant principal components 
for interpretation is selected on the basis of the Kaiser criterion with eigenvalue higher than 1 
(Kaiser, 1960) and a total of explained variance equal or higher than 70%.

The PCA results will be discussed ahead (section 6, Paper III) however to explain some other 
data analysis techniques it should be noted that the PCA revealed a strong correlated 
association between the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn elements. This group is controlled by the 
geochemical signature of the Panasqueira sulfi de mineralization and was defi ned has the
PTE group. The PCA analysis was performed using Statistica Six Sigma 7.0® software.

3.3.4. Spatial estimation

Spatial estimation variography provides a description of the spatial pattern of a continuous 
attribute Z (or an indicator variable I

c
), a pollutant concentration of a chemical element (Reis et 

al., 2005) or the anomalous concentration of a metal orebodie with economic interest (Patinha 
et al., 2008; Reis et al., 2004). Given a data set for the variable Z at n locations x

i
, (Z(x

i
), i = 1, 

2,…,n), the sample variogram ?
Z
*(h) (the symbol * in this text will indicate estimates) measures 

the average dissimilarity between data separated by a vector h (Goovaerts, 1999,2008), 

??Z*(h) =  
1

2N(h) i=1
[Z(xi) - Z(xi+h)]

where N(h) is the number of data pairs at a lag of h. For I
c
, the variogram is,

??Ic*(h) =  
1

2N(h) j=1
[Ic(xj) - Ic(xj+h)]

2
N(h)

 [2]

The variogram can be calculated for different directions of h, allowing knowing how the 
variable Z(x), or I

c
(x), varies in several directions of the space.

3.3.5. Ordinary kriging

The main application of geostatistics to soil science has been the estimation and mapping of 
soil attributes in unsampled locations from nearby measured points in sampled areas. Kriging 
is a generic name for a family of spatial least-squares predictors. For the prediction of the 
variable Z at a location x

0
, {Z(x

0
)}, the estimator Z*(x

0
) is defi ned as (Goovaerts ,1999,2008):

?Z*(x0) =  i=1 ? Z(xi)
n

 [3]

where the ?

 [4]

with ?(h) being the theoretical model for the variogram of the variable Z (fi tted to the sample 
variograms) and ? being a Lagrange multiplier.

The software used to create variograms, to model variograms and perform spatial estimation 
based on Ordinary Kriging (including map generation) was Surfer 11.0®.

3.3.6. Estimation of the regional and local geochemical baselines

Environmental geochemical baselines are needed in order to assess the present state of the 
surface environment and provide guidelines and quality standards (Albanese et al., 2007; 
Frattini et al., 2006; Galán et al., 2008; Salminen and Gregorauskiene, 2000; Salminen and 
Tarvainen, 1997). Tidball and Ebens (1976) used the term geochemical baseline in order to 
describe the natural background in areas of a heavy anthropogenic impact. Their defi nition 
was that a baseline encompasses the central 95% of the observed concentrations. In this 
study the geochemical baseline was determined using the Tuckey (1977) paradigm. First it was 
determined the confi dence range, which exclude abnormal values – outliers. The geochemical 
baseline is considered to be the median of the data within the confi dence range. The results 
were positively compared with those obtained with the Tidball and Ebens (1976) method.

3.3.7. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

In order to gauge the relationship between the PTE’s and the independent variables (depth, 
pH and SOM), it was performed a two-way ANOVA test, specifi ed as

Zijk=? + ?i +?j + ?ij + ?ijk [5]

where Z represents the kth observation of the PTE taken at jth depth (j = 1 or 2) and ith soil 
property (i = 1 or 2), ? represents the overall mean estimated, ? represents the depth effect, 
? represents the soil property (pH or SOM), ? represents the interaction between depth and 
the soil property and ? represents the residual error (Zar, 1996; Johnson and Wichern, 1998; 



56 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach
Carla Candeias | 2013

Corwin et al., 2006). Log transformation was applied to the PTE’s in order to obtain normal 
distribution and homogeneous variances (Levene’s test, ? = 0.05) of the data. For the two-way 
analysis of variance samples were classifi ed according to pH values (very acid [3.0, 4.0[, acid 
[4.0, 6.0[ and neutral [6.0, 7.0]) and SOM ([3.6, 10.0[and [10.0, 39.0] in %). It should be noted 
that the established SOM classes were only defi ned for statistical purposes. Once there were 
only two samples with neutral pH the class was not considered in this analysis.

3.3.8. Pollution load index (PLI)

A quantitative approach of the multielement contamination was made based on the PLI 
according the methodology proposed by Tomlinson et al. (1980), by deriving the nth root of 
the n concentration factors (CF

1
×CF

2
×CF

3
×... CF

n
 – where n is the number of metals). The 

concentration factor (CF), defi ned as the ratio between each trace PTE in the soil sample 
and its background value (Galán et al. 2008). On account of the lognormal distribution of 
elements in geological materials (e.g. Reimann et al. 2005; Salminen and Tarvainen 1997), was 
assumed the median (value at the 50th percentile of the background data) as soil geochemical 
baseline for each element, refl ecting natural processes unaffected or diffusely affected by 
human activities.

3.3.9. Enrichment index (EI)

One common approach to estimate metal concentrations is to compute an index that 
averages the accumulation of each metal in each sample. To evaluate the degree of trace 
metal contamination in soils the EI (Ávila et al., 2008a; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Kim et al., 
1998; Lee et al., 1998; Chon et al., 1995; Nishida et al., 1982) was calculated by averaging 
the ratios of the elements concentrations (mg kg-1) to the permissible level (PL). In the study 
of the S. Francisco de Assis village EI on rhizosphere soils, eight elements (As, Cd, Cu, Mn, 
Pb, V, W, Zn) were selected. The PL is the element concentration in the soil, from which crops 
produced are considered as unsafe for human health (As = 20 mg kg-1; Cd = 3 mg kg-1; Cu = 
100 mg kg-1; Mn = 394 mg kg-1; Pb = 85 mg kg-1; V = 50 mg kg-1; W = 1 mg kg-1; Zn = 140 mg 
kg-1; Ferreira, 2004; Reimann and Caritat, 1998; Kloke, 1979). This index is useful to evaluate 
the degree of multiple element contamination. An enrichment index over 1.0 indicates that, 
on average, metal concentrations are above the permissible level, though element enrichment 
may be from anthropogenic inputs or natural geological sources (Nimick and Moore, 1991).

3.3.10. Contamination factor (CF) and modifi ed degree of 
contamination (mC

d
)

This method was proposed by Hakanson (1980) and is based on the calculation, for each 
pollutant, of a contamination factor (CFi). The CFi is the ratio obtained by dividing the mean 
concentration of each metal in the soil (C

i
) by the baseline or background value of the specifi c 

metal (C
b
; Ag = 0.05; As = 22.2; Bi = 0.3; Cd = 0.01; Cu = 28.4; W = 0.35; Zn = 58; Table 3.2; 

Liu et al. 2005):

CFi = Ci / Cb  [6]

3.3.11. Potential ecological risk factor and risk index (PERI)

The potential ecological risk factor is defi ned as the sum of the risk factors (Ei
f
), which 

quantitatively defi nes the potential ecological risk of a contaminant in a sample i.e.:

? ?
i=1 i=1

PERIi= EFi = CFi x TFi
7 7

 [8]

where: PERIi is the potential ecological risk index for each sample (i); EFi is the monomial 
potential ecological risk factor; CFi is the single contamination factor (eq. 6); and TFi is the 
heavy metal toxic-response factor for each selected element. Soils toxic-response factors 
were computed for the seven selected elements according to the toxic factor requirements 
proposed by Hakanson (1980). For this estimation, they were used reference guide values of 
igneous rocks, soils, fresh water and land plants proposed by Reimann and Caritat (1998) and 
the proposed land animal reference values by Bowen (1966). The TFi values obtained were: Zn 
= 1 &amp;lt;Cu = 2 &amp;lt;As = 5 &amp;lt;W = 15 &amp;lt;Bi = 20 &amp;lt;Cd = 30 &amp;lt;Ag = 35. Hakanson (1980) defi ned fi ve

3.3.12. Human health risk assessment

Human health risk assessment calculations were based on the assumption that residents, 
both children and adults, are directly exposed to soils (section 7, Paper IV), street dusts (section 8, 
Paper V; section 9, Paper VI) and waters (section 5, Paper II; section 8, Paper V; section 9, Paper VI) via three 
main pathways (a) ingestion, (b) dermal absorption and (c) inhalation of particles present in 
the air and/or by drinking water (USEPA, 1989, 1996; Linders, 1990; Berg, 1994). Ingestion (a) 
occurs by drinking/eating particles and/or licking contact surfaces (e.g. hands). It is assumed 
that children present a higher particles ingestion rate, due to hand-to-mouth intake. Dermal 
absorption occurs through exposed skin, while inhalation occurs both by mouth and nose 
during breathing. Particles&amp;lt;10 ?m (PM

10
) are the more relevant in this last process, although 

bigger fractions of inhaled particles are, probably, decomposed in the gastrointestinal track. 
These assumptions lead to the conclusion that all contaminants are absorbed, both by 
gastrointestinal tract or the lung (Berg, 1994). Equations 9 to 11 were used to estimate the 
chronic daily intake of each route of exposure considered (USEPA, 1989, 1996, 2001; USDoE, 
2013), supplemented by specifi c quantitative information (Table 3.5).

The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic side effects, for individual PTE’s, were computed 
individually, as toxicity calculation uses different methods (USEPA, 2007). For each element 
and pathway the non-cancer toxic risk was determined by computing the Hazard Quotient 
(HQ, also known as non-cancer risk; Eq. 12) for systemic toxicity (USEPA, 2001). If HQ 
exceeds one indicates that non-carcinogenic effects might occur. To estimate the overall 
developing danger of non-carcinogenic effects it is assumed that toxic risks have additive 
effects. Therefore it is possible to determine the cumulative non-carcinogenic hazard index 
(HI), which corresponds to the sum of HQ for each pathway (Eq. 13; USEPA, 1989; Luo et al., 
2012a). The HI below one indicates that there is no signifi cant risk of non-carcinogenic effects. 
With HI above one there is a probability of occurring non-carcinogenic effects, enhanced with 
the increase of the HI (USEPA, 2001). The toxicity levels, for each element, were taken from 
the risk assessment information system (RAIS; USDoE, 2013). The probability of an individual 
developing any type of cancer over a lifetime, as a result to exposure to the carcinogenic 
hazards, was computed for each pathway as in Eq. 14 (Hu et al., 2011). The carcinogenic 
risk was estimated by the sum of total cancer risk (Eq. 15). A cancer risk below 1E-06 is 
considered insignifi cant, being a result of 1E-06 classifi ed as the carcinogenic target risk. 
If the cancer risk is above 1E-04 is qualifi ed as unacceptable (USEPA, 1989, 2013a; Luo
et al., 2012a).

3.3.13. Total metal in concentration vegetables

The total metal content for each vegetable (TP) was calculated using Eq. 16.

TP = 
(Rdw x Rec) + (Sdw x Sec) + (Ldw x Lec) + (Tdw x Tec)

Rdw + Sdw + Ldw + Tdw   [16]

where: Rdw – Root dry weight; Rec – Root element content; Sdw – Stem dry weight; Sec 
– Stem element content; Ldw – Leaves dry weight; Lec – Leaves element content; Tdw – 
Tubercle dry weight; Tec – Tubercle element content.

3.3.14. Estimated daily intake of heavy metals from vegetables

The estimated daily exposure to metals (EDEM) through vegetables is dependent on metal 
contents in vegetables, daily vegetable consumption, as well as the body weight. The EDEM 
was calculated according to Eq. 18, considering the average daily intake of metals (DIM) 
present in 345 g of vegetables per day for adult residents (Luo et al., 2011a; JECFA,1993); the 
body weight of an adult resident was set to 60 kg in this study.

DIM = daily veg consumption x mean veg metal concentration [17]

EDEM = daily intake of metals (DIM)
body weight    [18]

3.3.15. Calculation of health risk associated with the consumption of 
vegetables

In the study of the inhabitants of the S. Francisco de Assis village, the health risk associated 
with the consumption of vegetables was defi ned as the ratio of the estimated daily intake of 
metals to the reference oral dose (R

f
D) for each metal (Luo et al., 2011a; JECFA, 1993), as in 

equation 19.

Risk index = 
EDEM

RfD  [19]

where R
f
D represents safe levels of exposure by oral intake for a lifetime (JECFA,1993). If 

the risk index is less than 1, no obvious risk is involved. If the risk index is equal to or higher 
than 1, there is a potential health risk, and related interventions and protective measurements 
should be taken. In the present study, metals/metalloids of concern were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and 
Zn, and only the chronic risk R

f
D was considered in the risk assessment (Luo et al., 2011a).

3.3.16. Study population

Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables describing the characteristics of the 
two study groups, namely, controls and environmentally exposed. Quantitative variables 
were summarized by using n (group size), mean and standard deviation (±SD) of the mean. 
Qualitative variables were expressed as percentage values. The departure from normality 
for the analyzed continuous variables was evaluated with the graphical approach as well as 
with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Where the assumption of normality was not met, data 



61Part I – Approach
3. Materials and methods

transformations were applied to normalize the distribution. The effect of exposure on the 
concentration of metals was tested with the independent samples t-test of log-transformed 
data. Associations between two variables were tested by Spearman correlation. The critical 
limit for signifi cance was set at p &amp;lt;0.05. The statistical software used for the analyses was 
IBM© SPSS® Statistics for Windows v.20.

3.3.16.1. Comparison with reference ranges

Data from this study were compared with some reference obtained from samples collected 
from Italian and Swedish healthy volunteers without a detailed description of the environmental 
or occupational exposure therefore are only indicative and may change signifi cantly from 
population to population. Numerous factors such as site of residence, gender, age, diet, 
lifestyle or geochemical environment need to be taken into account when establishing the 
reference ranges for a population (Rodushkin et al., 2000), and any comparison must be 
interpreted carefully. Regarding the Portuguese population, there are few studies that report 
metal(loid)s levels in exposed populations, and they show wide changes in levels within the 
same population in different geographic areas (reviewed in Coelho et al., 2012). Therefore, 
in this study the element concentration obtained for the exposed populations is compared 
with those of the controls, as they were matched for age, gender (only the environmentally 
exposed group), diet, lifestyle, geochemical environment and residence.

3.3.17. Piper diagrams (PD)

The Piper diagram is widely used to study the similarities and differences in the composition 
of waters and to classify them into certain chemical types (Chadha, 1999). As described 
by Karanth (1987) the PD show the essential chemical character of different constituents in 
percentage reacting values, expressed in milligrams equivalent, for each water type. These 
diagrams are computed based on the combination of the major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) 
and major anions (CO

3
-, Cl-, SO

4
2-) from two base triangular diagrams in to a central lozenge 

(Lucena et al., 2004). The diagram shows the relative proportion of the main ions, not their 
absolute concentrations.

3.3.18. Ficklin diagram

In order to interpret variations in drainage water chemistry Plumlee et al. (1992) developed 
one diagram, based on pH and the sum of the base metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Co and Ni. These 
parameters were selected rather than more common metals such as Fe, Al and Mn because 
have proven the most diagnostic in differentiating between different geologic controls (INAP, 
2009; Plumlee et al., 1999).

3.3.19. PHREEQC code and WATEQ4F

PHREEQC code and WATEQ4F are geochemical modeling software based on ion-association 
aqueous model and are capable of describing chemical reactions and transport processes 
in waters, based on equilibrium chemistry of aqueous solutions with minerals, gases, solid 
solutions, exchangers, and sorption surfaces. PHREEQC can be used, among others, as a 
speciation program to calculate saturation indices (SI) and the distribution of aqueous species 
(Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013). Additionally it was applied the WATEQ4F as the thermodynamic

database (Ball and Nordstrom, 1991), which contains the revised arsenic data proposed 
by Nordstrom and Archer (2002). It uses the temperature, pH, Eh, dissolved oxygen and 
alkalinity water parameters, and also the chemical analysis computing the distribution of 
aqueous species, ion activities, and mineral saturation indices that specify the propensity 
of a water to dissolve or precipitate a set of minerals (Drever, 1988; Nordstrom and Munoz, 
1986). The WATEQ4F results are used primarily to examine the tendency of water to reach 
mineral solubility equilibrium as a constraint on interpreting the chemistry of waters. These 
results are a helpful implement used for reaction modeling with the PHREEQC software (Ball 
and Nordstrom, 1991). The saturation index (SI) indicates if a solution is in equilibrium with a 
solid phase or if it is undersaturated or supersaturated in relation to a solid phase. Equilibrium 
is assumed related to 0. If SI is below 0 the solution is undersaturated in relation to the 
corresponding mineral and waters still have the capacity to dissolve that mineral phase. In 
case of SI exceeds 0, then the solution is oversaturated in respect to the mineral and have the 
tendency to precipitate that mineral phase.

Acid mine drainage from the Panasqueira mine and its infl uence on 
Zêzere river (Central Portugal)

Abstract

The main evidences of the mining exploitation and ore treatment operations in Panasqueira are testifi ed 

with the huge tailings, mainly, in Rio and Barroca Grande areas. Mining and benefi ciation processes 

produce metal rich mine wastes. Oxidation of sulfi des from the tailings and fl ow from open air 

impoundments are responsible for the mobilization and migration of metals from the mine wastes into 

the environment. AMD discharged from Rio tailing has a pH around 3 and high metal concentrations. 

In Zêzere river, Fe and As are the most rapidly depleted downstream from AMD once As adsorbs, 

coprecipitate and form compounds with iron oxyhydroxides. The Zêzere river waters are oversaturated 

with kaolinite and goethite, and ferrihydrite can precipitate on stream with a near-neutral pH. At sites 

having low pH the dissolved Fe species in the water, mainly, occur as sulfate complexes due to a high

This research was developed under the scope of the e-Ecorisk (2007) project and it was performed as

These different types of water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The trace metal 
concentrations in the seepage water and water collected in the Casinhas stream are higher 
than the concentrations in the Zêzere river water. Sulfate concentrations cover a range from 4 
to 3,717 mg L-1 and the highest concentrations are associated with waste piles and correlated 
with low pH values (r = -0.98, p &amp;lt;0.05). The TDS values of the seepage waters ranged from 
819 to 2,860 mg L-1. The Casinhas stream waters showed higher values of TDS from 227.5 to 
707.2 mg L-1 than those of the Zêrere river which ranged from 24.1 to 49.4 mg L-1.

plus sulfi de oxidation. Table 4.1 shows that major ions contents tend to increase with the 
decrease of pH, whereas HCO

- and Cl- showed positive correlation with pH, indicating 

the dissolution of minerals related to the host rock composition. Based on these observed 
hydrogeochemical characteristics, along with the major mineral constituents in the rock and 
ores, it is suggested that the seepage waters are related to sulfi de weathering and dissolution 
of secondary minerals whereas the Zêzere river chemical characteristics of the waters are 
mainly controlled by dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals.

Hydrochemical compositions of the water samples were plotted in Piper trilinear diagram (Fig.

The drainage discharges from Rio tailing are typical mine waters and belong to the

of geochemical reactions occurring in the mine wastes and in underlying aquifers results in 
profound changes in the concentrations of the dissolved constituents and in the mineralogy 
and physical properties of the mine waste and aquifer materials. The Casinhas stream and 
seepage waters show low pH and are enriched in sulfate ions but also in some of the major 
and trace elements.

Low-pH conditions promote the dissolution of many metal-bearing solids and the metals 
desorption from solid surfaces. The probable source of sulfate and heavy metals are the 
oxidation of sulfi de minerals, mainly arsenopyrite, but also pyrite and chalcopyrite. These 
acidic waters are displaced into underlying or adjacent geological materials, or it is discharged 
directly to the adjacent surface water fl ow system. The geochemical reactions of these waters

with the gangue minerals result in progressive increases of pH through acid neutralization 
reactions and the attenuation of the concentrations of dissolved metals released from
mine wastes.

According to the Ficklin diagram (Fig. 4.2a) the Panasqueira waters can be separated in four 
groups: (1) high-acid and extreme metal content; (2) acid and high-metal content; (3) near 
neutral and high metal content; and (4) near neutral pH and low metal content.

The fi rst three groups represent the seepage and the Casinhas stream waters, and the 
fourth group includes the Zêzere river samples, collected upstream and downstream the Rio 
tailing. According to Plumlee et al. (1999) the group classifi ed as high acid and extreme metal 
rich are typical of drainage water derived from polymetallic deposits characterized by low 
buffering potential. The most polluted waters are in or close to the mine tailing, where the 
metal dispersion and acidity generation is clearer. Two of the Casinhas stream samples also 
show a high metal content but with a pH value near neutral. On the other hand the waters 
collected in Zêzere river present a near neutral pH and low contents of metals, more evident 
on the upstream samples. The high metal contents and low pH refl ect the infl uence of the 
acidic waters from the tailings and mud impoundments, while the low concentration values 
and neutral pH refl ects the dilution phenomena and the geochemical baselines values of local 
surface waters. The plots of SO

4
2-, As, Al, Fe and Mn concentrations versus pH values (Fig. 4.2b 

to 4.2f) show the same trend of increasing metal content with decreasing pH and refl ects the 
greater amounts of sulfi de minerals and a smaller content of carbonates and other minerals 
that consume acid according to Plumlee et al. (1999).

4.1.2. Water rock interaction

Chemical elements speciation was performed using the PHREEQC code in conjunction with 
the WATEQ4F data base. Figure 4.3 shows the SI of the waters with concern to various specifi ed 
minerals.

The SI calculation of the representative minerals in waters show that seepage waters 
with concern to the silicate minerals (Fig. 4.3a) present a negative saturation index being 
undersaturated in albite, chlorite, halloysite and K mica, presenting a positive saturation 
index and are oversaturated in chalcedony and quartz. The clay minerals (Fig. 4.3b), kaolinite 
and montmorillonite, are undersaturated and most of the sulfates (Fig. 4.3c), alunite, anhydrite 
and gypsum, are nearly in equilibrium state in these waters. Regarding Zêzere river waters, 
according to the calculated SI, they are oversaturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay 
minerals and undersaturated in sulfates.

The seepage waters (SP1, SP2, SP3 and BG) are mainly saturated or near equilibrium 
with respect to alunite KAl

 while the majority of the Casinhas stream and the 

Zêzere river samples are oversaturated in gibbsite Al(OH)

. It is thought that an increase in 

sulfate activity may promote the formation of sulfate minerals (e.g. gypsum, anhydrite and 
alunite) when the aqueous solution is rich in cations such as Ca, Al and K. The association of 
alteration minerals alunite+quartz is formed at pH lower than 3.5, while the kaolinite+alunite 
assemblage develops at pH 4.9 (Perry et al., 1980; Wirsching et al., 1990). The relationships 
between alunite and kaolinite were determined by Wirsching et al. (1990) on the basis of
experimental studies.

The alunite is a reaction product of kaolinite 
with sulfuric acid. According to Inoue 
(1995), the very low pH values observed in 
seepage waters, are related to the sulfi des 
oxidation.

The mineralogical composition of the 
samples collected in Rio site (in the dam 
and in the tailing), reveals the presence 
of arsenopyrite, scorodite, marcasite, 
pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, 
natrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite, 
montmorillonite and montmorillonite–
vermiculite. The mineralogical composition 
of Zêzere river stream sediments revealed 
the presence of mica, quartz, chlorite, 
kaolinite, feldspar and hematite (XRD 
identifi cation). At the base of the Rio tailing 
dam, scorodite (FeAsO

(Fe2+(SO

identifi ed by XRD. Acid mine drainage 
discharged from the Rio tailing (SP1) has a 
pH of 3.0 and high concentrations of trace 
metals (Table 4.1). Also, As concentrations in 
this sample are high (2,140 ?g L-1 As). Iron 
concentration in stream waters decreases 
rapidly downstream with pH rising. Arsenic 
concentration decreases downstream with 
the same pattern of Fe (see sample ZZ – 
Fe = 0.13 mg L-1 and As = 4 ?g L-1). These 
results show that Fe and As are the most 
rapidly depleted elements from AMD and 
indicates that concentrations of Fe and 
As decreases by dilution as well as by the

5. Paper II

Water rock interaction and geochemical processes in superfi cial waters 
and sediments due to tailings impoundments from the Panasqueira 
mine (central Portugal)

Abstract

Seasonal water samples and stream sediments were collected during two different periods (rainy and 

dry seasons) and analyzed for a wide range of major and trace elements, in order to defi ne the present 

hydrochemical situation. Rain waters interacting with the altered sulfi des stored in the tailings generates 

runoff waters with high metal concentrations. The waste material derived from the exploitation enhanced 

acidifi cation and metal-releasing processes, due to the increase in the specifi c surface, which favors the 

oxidation of sulfi de minerals. Acid drainage and high concentrations of metals (Cd, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, As) in 

solution were observed in waters leaching the Panasqueira tailing deposits. In dry seasons, generally the 

acidic waters, enriched in metals, evaporate progressively depositing sulfate effl orescences characteristic 

of acidic environments. The dry period samples have pH slightly higher comparing with the rainy period 

pH, while SO
4

2- and metals concentration are lower. Despite the expected dilution effect that should be 

marked in the wet period samples, that dilution did not occur (at the time of the rainy period sampling) 

due to the easily soluble sulfate minerals dissolution once samples were collected immediately after a 

rainstorm and the leachates had just drained to the river when the sampling occurred.

The distribution of the elements in precipitated mineral helps in the interpretation of aqueous geochemical 

data. Seepage waters have high Al, As, and Si aqueous concentrations in the oxidation zone and the 

precipitation of goethite and gibbsite (SI &gt; 0) in this zone provides a sink for these elements. Aqueous 

concentrations of other minor elements, such as Cu, Zn and Mn may also be attenuated by goethite, 

gibbsite and/or ferrihydrite precipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption processes. Arsenic 

speciation revealed that As(V) dominate arsenic species in these waters. The divalent ions Cd2+ 

and Mn2+ are the dominant species together with the sulfate species of Cd and Mn (CdSO
4

0 and 

MnSO
4

0) presented in the waters. The use of these waters for human consumption and for agriculture 

irrigation represents a risk to humans once they have a potential carcinogenic risk especially due to the

As concentrations. The acid water precipitation is present on the stream sediments, with concentrations 

exceeding the toxicity limits.

5.1.1. Seepage and stream waters geochemistry

The physicochemical data in Table 5.1 presents the data reported to the rainy season. According 
to the results water samples can be divided distinctly into three main groups based on its 
location and also in the pH and electric conductivity (EC) conditions: (Group I) the seepage 
and ZZ waters with 2.6 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;4.9 and 100 &amp;lt;EC &amp;lt;3,232 ?S cm-1; (Group II) Casinhas stream 
samples and CFZ with 5.3 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.8 and 36 &amp;lt;EC &amp;lt;1,730 ?S cm-1; and (Group III) the 
Barroco stream samples with 6.2 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.9 and 49 &amp;lt;EC &amp;lt;82 ?S cm-1. These different types 
of water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The correlations between metals

were observed at the base of the Rio tailings where the more acidic Fe(II)-rich waters are 
found (Ávila et al., 2008a). According to Ávila et al. (2008a), the mineralogical composition 
of the Rio tailing and open air impoundment materials, reveals the presence of arsenopyrite, 
scorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, natrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite 
and montmorillonite (XRD identifi cation) and at the base of the Rio tailings dam, scorodite 
[FeAsO

2
O], melanterite [Fe(SO

4
).7(H

2
O)] and minor amounts of rozenite [Fe(SO

4
).4(H

2
O)] 

and szomolnokite [Fe(SO
4
).(H

2
O)] were observed and identifi ed also by XRD. Many of the 

secondary minerals present (e.g. sulfates) are mainly controlled by the wet–dry cycles related 
to seasonal variations in rainfall since they tend to precipitate during dry periods and easily 
redissolved during rainfall episodes.

The dissolution of these sulfate minerals explain the increasing concentrations in SO
4
2- and 

metals and the lower pH during the rainy period in this Zêzere river location. Another reason 
is that the percentage of annual seepage volume collected by the collection channel system 
is small. However during the rainy season the discharges of this channel are coincident with 
the high fl ows in the local streams and rivers (Fig. 2.20a). As a result, untreated AMD is diluted 
by surface water.

Seasonal variability in chemical composition should be restricted to a dilution effect after 
heavy rain, which allows a decrease in the metal contents of the stream waters. The chemical 
composition of waters also results from the interaction with the host rock and tailings. During 
the rainy season, sample ZZ was collected immediately after an heavy rainfall, with a signifi cant 
amount of seepage water coming from the Rio tailing draining to the river (Fig. 2.20a). On the 
following days the signifi cant river fl ow and oxygenation will contribute for the dilution and to 
a pH increase in the river.

Hydrochemical compositions of the water samples were plotted in a Piper trilinear diagram 
(Piper, 1944). According to the diagram for the rainy season samples (Fig. 5.1a) two groups are 
identifi ed: (a) the Mg2+/Ca2+–SO

4
2- waters associated with the samples collected downstream 

the tailing; and (b) the Na+/Mg2+–HCO
3
- waters located outside the tailing infl uence. Regarding 

the dry season sampling (Fig. 5.1b), Casinhas stream samples, one sample from Barroco stream 
and from Zêzere river are classifi ed as Mg2+/Ca2+–SO

4
2- type.

A classifi cation based on pH and in a metal group concentration was proposed as the Ficklin 
diagram (Plumlee et al., 1992, 1994, 1999), considering that Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn, were 
the major heavy metals found in water samples. According to the Ficklin diagram for the 
rainy season samples (Fig. 5.2) the seepage waters, collected near Rio tailing, are mainly acid/
high metal and high acid/extreme metal content, while the stream waters from Casinhas are 
classifi ed as near-neutral and high-metal. The samples from Barroco stream are near-neutral 
and low-metal content and Zêzere river samples are both low metal. Ficklin diagram resulting 
from the dry season sampling (Fig. 5.3), groups the Casinhas stream samples as near-neutral 
and high-metal waters and Barroco stream and Rio Zêzere samples as near-neutral and 
low-metal content.

According to Plumlee et al. (1999) the samples classifi ed as high acid and extreme metal 
rich are typical of drainage waters derived from polymetallic deposits characterized by 
low buffering potential. The most contaminated waters are in or close to the mine tailings, 
where the metal dispersion and acidity generation is more intense. The effect of interaction 
between the tailings and water is well marked close to the emergence of the waters that

At Barroca Grande, the water is collected, pumped, and neutralized with lime [Ca(OH)

] at 

the Salgueira water treatment plant (WTP) promoting the metal precipitation and fl occulation 
when pH increases. The WTP average fl ow ranges 1,000 m3 h-1 (winter) to 250–300 m3 h-1 

(summer); since the maximum water capacity is of 300 m3 h-1, a signifi cant portion of acid 
waters are conducted directly to the Casinhas stream without any pretreatment during the 
rainfall season (Reis, 1971; Cavey and Gunning, 2006). The highly acidic water from the tailing 
piles fl ows into nearby streams. In the dry period sampling, an intense pH increasing has 
occurred in sample CS4, which is located immediately downstream the Salgueira WTP. This 
sample was collected after the lime neutralization, reason why the pH increased dramatically. 
The mine water fl ows seasonally, with minimal base fl ow conditions during the dry season and 
high fl ow during the rainy season.

refl ecting the greater amounts of sulfi de minerals and the smaller content of carbonates and 
other minerals that consume acid (Plumlee et al.,1999).

According to Nordstrom and Ball (1985) in acid waters there are two distinguish kind of ions 
whose behavior depends on its dissolution characteristics. Ions like As are non-conservative 
because they are rapidly eliminated during transport (see As/pH projection in Fig 5.2c and Fig 
5.3c) mainly due to coprecipitation with Fe oxyhydroxides and also to clay adsorption, while 
SO

2- diagrams.

AMD is controlled by the leaching processes involving sulfi des. Low-pH conditions promote 
the dissolution of many metal bearing minerals and the metals desorption from solid surfaces. 
The hydrochemical features in Panasqueira are dominated by the oxidation of Fe-bearing 
sulfi des minerals, namely arsenopyrite, but also pyrite and chalcopyrite, producing H+, SO

According to Blowes et al. (2003) the geochemical reactions occurring in the mine wastes and 
in underlying aquifers results in intense changes in the concentrations of dissolved constituents 
and in the mineralogy and physical properties of the mine wastes and in the aquifer rocks. 
There is a clear chemical distinction between the different kinds of water in this study: (a)

in both sampling campaign. Sample B2 (dry season) has somehow a signifi cant increase, in 
sulfate ion and trace metals as well as in major ions, which must be studied more deeply to 
understand the geochemical reactions inherent to this behavior. 

Because As is a toxic element and because arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is the main sulfi de rejected 
in Panasqueira mine, As and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation according to the 
methodologies described previously. According to the results (Table 5.3) As and Fe are naturally 
present in seepage waters (rainy period) due to the surface runoff and percolation that are 
responsible for the leaching of the tailing materials and formation of these acid drainage. 
Leaching at the Barroca Grande and Rio tailings sites affects the Casinhas stream and Zêzere 
river hydrochemistry downstream, recorded in the As concentrations of samples CS1 and 
CS2, the nearest ones of the Barroca Grande tailing, and also in sample ZZ located in Zêzere 
river in the Rio tailing basement. Probably, downstream these location the pH and Eh (more 
oxidizing environment) of the river, as well, as microbiological mechanisms, will cause As 
co-precipitation with Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and Mn.

The distribution and mobility of dissolved As species are dependent on the pH and redox 
potential (Eh) conditions. The pH and Eh relationship is very important in understanding As 
immobilization/stabilization on solid phases as well as the distribution of arsenic species 
in water (Wee, 2003). As(V) species are dominant under oxidizing conditions and As(III) is 
thermodynamically stable under mildly reducing conditions. Normally, the Eh values of surface 
water are high, and low in groundwater. Thus, As(V) is more likely to occur in surface waters 
while As(III) tends to occur more frequently in ground waters. As(III) is more mobile because 
is mainly present as a neutral form at the pH of most natural environments (pH &amp;lt;9) so it is 
less strongly adsorbed on mineral surfaces (Korte and Fernando, 1991). Meng et al (2001) 
pointed out that three redox zones can be divided according to the arsenic mobility: (1) an 
adsorption zone at pe &gt; 0 (Eh &gt; 0 mV); (2) a mobilization (transition) zone at -4.0 &amp;lt;pe &amp;lt;0 



82 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach

(-236 mV &amp;lt;Eh &amp;lt;0 mV); and (3) a reductive fi xation zone at pe &amp;lt;-4.0 (Eh &amp;lt;-236 mV). Arsenic 
mobility is greatest in the mobilization zone due to the reduction of ferric oxyhydroxides, main 
adsorbents for arsenic, to ferrous iron and As(V) to As(III). High values of Eh or pe (low electron 
activity) correspond to oxidizing conditions, and waters with low values of Eh or pe (high 
electron activity) correspond to reducing conditions. The high Eh values for the rainy season 
samples correspond to an oxidizing environment being the As dissolved in the arsenate form. 
It must be pointed out that in Barroco stream whose waters are utilized for irrigation, arsenic 
concentration is in all samples below the parametric water values for human consumption 
according to the Portuguese guide values (10 ?g L-1; Decree-Law 306/2007). Regarding to 
the dry period sampling, the Eh values are lower when compared to rainy sampling but they 
are still high and positive, locating these samples in oxidizing conditions. An exception was 
verifi ed for the CS4 sample, with Eh = -116 mV and pH = 9.5. Arsenic content in CS4 increased 
signifi cantly due to the pH increase and an Eh value located in the mobilization zone (-236 mV 
&amp;lt;Eh &amp;lt;0 mV) enhancing arsenic mobility. The B2 water sample, from Barroco stream, is used 
for irrigation by local population and its concentration in the dry season sampling is worrisome 
because this water presents As concentrations above the parametric value permitted by the 
Portuguese legislation (Decree-Law 306/2007). Nevertheless, the toxicity of As depends on its 
oxidation state and reduced forms are the most toxic. However, in this sample As is present 
mainly as As(V) which represent a lower degree of toxicity.

The results also show that Fe(III) is dominant in all samples.

5.2. Water rock interaction

The saturation index (SI) of water samples (determined with the PHREEQC code combined 
with the WATEQ4F database) showed that the Fe-oxides, Fe/Al-hydroxides, aluminosilicates 
and Al-hydrosulfates are the main mineral groups in which waters tend to become more 
supersaturated. These phases are very important since they show a high metal(loid)s adsorption 
capacity. A small number of Ba phases displayed SI &gt; 0 for the majority of the water samples. 
Nevertheless, in some water samples the single As mineral phase supersaturated have Ba in 
its composition [Ba

3
(AsO

4
)
2
].

Understanding the distribution of elements in precipitated mineral phases is important for 
the interpretation of aqueous geochemical data. For instance, aqueous concentrations of Al, 
As, and Si are elevated in the seepage waters in the oxidation zone and the precipitation of 
goethite and gibbsite, both with SI &gt; 0, in this zone provides a sink for these elements. Aqueous 
concentrations of other minor elements, such as Cu, Zn and Mn may also be attenuated by 
goethite, gibbsite and/or ferrihydrite precipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption 
processes. 

According to Ávila et al. (2008a) and Paper I (section 4 of this thesis), the mineralogical 
composition, of the Rio and Barroca Grande impoundments and tailings, reveals the presence 
of arsenopyrite, scorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite, natrojarosite, 
kaolinite, chlorite and montmorillonite. Geochemical calculations suggest that the waters are 
undersaturated with respect to gypsum and calcite and as a result, Ca and SO

4
2- concentrations 

are not limited by the precipitation of gypsum and calcite, being all water samples increased in 
calcium and sulfate. The source of SiO

2
, Ca and metals/metalloids, could be attributed to the 

silicate weathering, calcite dissolution and sulfi de-mineral oxidation. Casinhas stream waters 
are mainly saturated or near equilibrium with respect to alunite KAl

weathering product of aluminosilicates and pyrite. The long transport of the constituents 
forming these minerals and the possible subsequent deposition of alunite was determined
by PREEQC.

When analyzed individually, the water samples from each location does not present a 
signifi cant variation between the proportions of the supersaturated phases. However, the 
seepage waters show a higher capacity for mineral dissolution once, in general, have the 
lowest number of phases with SI &gt; 0 and, on the contrary, Casinhas and Barroco streams 
samples show more predisposition for mineral precipitation.

Comparing the rainy and dry seasons samples from Casinhas and Barroco streams and 
Zêrere river they do not present signifi cant differences in the supersaturated mineral phases 
(Fig. 5.4a,b), being the silicates and oxides the main phases. Carbonates and sulfates show 
minor differences. The fraction of samples supersaturated in sulfates is higher in rainy season 
than in dry season, with increasing conditions for carbonate precipitation, possibly due to the 
pH and alkalinity increase and sulfate concentration decrease. Seepage waters (Fig. 5.4c) show 
a reduced silicate precipitation when compared with the other samples, despite the higher 
mean silica concentrations. Supersaturated phases of sulfates and oxides are dominant in 
these water samples, due to the low pH values and to the high levels of sulfate and Fe.

season; and (c) seepage waters.

Studies carried out in the Panasqueira mine and surrounding area (Paper III in section 6; Coelho et 
al., 2013a – Paper VIII in section 12.5) identifi ed an assemblage of potentially toxic elements to the 
environment and to human health. Environmental studies concluded that the most important 
toxic element present in the environmentally exposed villages is As, revealing in soils and 
street dusts high mean concentrations: (a) 103 mg kg-1 in topsoil; (b) 138 mg kg-1 in rhizosphere 
soil; and (c) 588 mg kg-1 in street dust (Paper VI in section 9 of this thesis). These concentrations 
are much higher than the internationally guide values: (a) 11 mg kg-1 (Ontario soils quality 
guidelines, Ministry of the Environment, 2011); and (b) 20 mg kg-1 (acceptable risk values on 
street dusts proposed by Sezgin et al., 2003). Additionally individuals, especially females, 
from the same environmentally exposed areas apparently experienced a pronounced and 
continuous (past and recent) exposure to As and Mn (Coelho et al., 2013a). On another study 
the mean potential ecological risk (PERI) computed, classifi ed the topsoil of the Panasqueira 
mine as very high polluted, mostly due to the Cd ecological potential risk (Paper IV, section 7 of 
this thesis).

According to the Toxic Substances Portal (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013) As and Cd are 
toxic to humans and classifi ed as human carcinogens (section 12.1 of this thesis). Although 
Mn is an essential nutrient to humans, exposure to high levels of manganese might affect the 
nervous system (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013).

Arsenic speciation performed with PHREEQC code, aid to understand the behavior of As 
species in waters. The distribution of arsenic species [As(III) and As(V)] plotted in Fig. 5.5 shows 
that, markedly, As(V) dominate arsenic species in these water samples. The arsenous acid 
(H

infl uence of the seepages and also 
Casinhas stream samples, although 
these last ones with a smaller but still 
signifi cant infl uence (Fig. 5.6b).

Figure 5.7a, shows that circum-
neutral conditions promotes As(V) 
and As(III) precipitation, leading 
to an As decrease. These results 
are coherent with the procedures 
adopted by the mine company once, 
the acid effl uents are neutralized 
with lime Ca(OH)

 promoting metal 

precipitation and fl occulation when 
pH increases. Arsenic tends to 
precipitate and adsorb with Fe at low 
pH, usually between ~3 and ~7, and 
desorb or dissolve at higher pH. Thus, 
once oxidized, As will be present 
in solution in higher pH waters and 
this was what happened in CS4 dry 
season sample which presents a 
geochemically coherent behavior 
with a pH increase to 9.5 and an As 
release to solution (81 ?g L-1). 

Cadmium and Mn presents as 
dominant species the divalent ions 
(Cd2+ and Mn2+) for both sampling 
periods. The sulfate species of both 
elements (CdSO

0 and MnSO

4
0) are 

the second most relevant species 
and increase its importance as more 
acidic conditions prevail (Fig. 5.7b,c).

The environmental chemistry of 
Mn is largely governed by pH and 
redox conditions; Mn(II) dominates 
at lower pH and redox potential, 
with an increasing proportion of 
colloidal Mn oxyhydroxides above 
pH 5.5 in waters. In waters receiving 
acid mine drainage, dissolved Mn 
concentrations were high, below pH 
3, due to Mn dissolution infl uenced 
by acid mine drainage (WHO, 2004).

The Cd solubility in water is infl uenced 
to a large degree by the acidity of 
the medium. Cadmium oxide and

Cd carbonate, which are relatively insoluble in water. Dissolution of suspended or sediment-
bound Cd may result when there is an increase in acidity (WHO, 2011c). 

The use of these waters for human consumption represents a risk to humans. Sample CS1 
corresponds to a water consumed by the surrounding populations (Fig. 5.8). The Barroco 
stream waters are used for agriculture irrigation by the S. Francisco de Assis inhabitants. 
These samples, collected during the rainy season, showed a carcinogenic risk of 3.93E-04 
(CS1), 6.06E-05 (B1), 1.32E-04 (B2) and 1.84E-04 (B3), especially due to the As concentrations 
(USDoE, 2013). The 1E-06 value is classifi ed as the carcinogenic target risk. If the cancer risk 
is above 1E-04 is qualifi ed as unacceptable (USEPA, 1989, 2013a; Luo et al., 2012a). The dry 
season also shows similar risk values for these selected samples.

CS1 used for consumption 
by the local population.

5.3. Stream sediments geochemistry and mineralogy

In order to assess the dynamics of leaching, transport and accumulation of some selected 
metals and metalloids another sampling media was chosen – the stream sediments.

According to the results presented in Table 5.4 (data related to stream sediments collected 
during the rainy and dry season), it can be observed that the sediments collected under the 
infl uence of seepage waters are acidic and good receptors of the majority of the metals and 
metalloids. The mechanical and chemical dispersion, due to the dynamic of the stream and 
river surface waters, favors the mobilization and the incorporation of metals, namely, Ag, As, 
Cd, Cu, Zn and W, in stream sediments. Anomalous contents of these metals and metalloids 
were found predominantly in Casinhas stream, downstream Barroca Grande tailing and also 
in the main Zêzere river. Results indicate that the mine might be the main source of chemical 
contamination in the area. The irregular decay of these anomalous patterns suggests the 
interference of local hydrological and physiographical factors (expressed by periods of severe 
and wet winters affecting a geomorphologically rugged region) which promote mechanisms 
of fast erosion, transport and accumulation of solid materials, most of which are transported 
in suspension by surface waters.

Comparing the results of Fe and metals concentrations in stream sediments and in waters, it is 
evident the high accumulation level of these elements in stream sediments confi rming that the

water treatment plant located in Salgueira is responsible for iron removal from waters due to its 
precipitation and also through the co-precipitation of As and Cu with Fe, probably adsorbed 
on the stream sediments. The highest W concentration values observed in the sediments of 
Casinhas stream are resistant to weathering and remains as stable phase in sediments. Also 
rolled crystals of cassiterite were observed in the Panasqueira stream sediments.

The mineralogical study of the stream sediments (fraction&amp;lt;63 ?m) from Casinhas and Barroco 
streams, Zêzere river and one sample associated with seepage waters, carried out by XRD 
showed that samples were mainly composed of silicate primary minerals, from the veins and 
host rocks, as quartz, muscovite, albite and tourmaline. In some samples are also present 
phyllosilicate minerals (sepiolite and clinochlore) resulting from the secondary alteration of 
feldspars and phyllosilicates, and also a secondary arsenic mineral, the smolianinovite. It was

also detected the presence of panasqueiraite [CaMg(PO
4
)(OH,F)], a phosphate mineral which 

fi rst description was attributed at the Panasqueira tin-tungsten deposit in Portugal. This rare 
mineral occurs in the veins of the hydrothermal Sn-W deposit in association with fl uorapatite, 
wolfeite, topaz, muscovite, sphalerite, quartz, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, siderite, arsenopyrite, 
chlorite, vivianite, althausite, and thadeuite.

The XRD results clearly forms 3 main groups of stream sediments samples: (Group I) Casinhas 
stream – showed as mineralogical phases, mainly quartz, muscovite, clinochlore and tourmaline 
(schorl and dravite type); (Group II) – the samples collected in the surroundings of the S. 
Francisco de Assis village and the CFZ sample (confl uence of the Casinhas stream and Zêzere 
river); showed as main mineral phases quartz, muscovite, clinochlore and smolianinovite. The 
smolianinovite [(Co,Ni,Mg,Ca)

O)] is a secondary arsenate that results as 

a product of the oxidation of some sulfi de from the primary paragenesis; and (Group III) the 
sample CS4. This last sample is located immediately after the Salgueira WTP and, as stated 
before, was collected after lime addition being this fact, probably, the reason for the different 
and uncorrelated mineralogy determined by the XRD. The CS5 sediment sample, with the 
lowest pH (3.9) also showed some of the lowest concentrations in the elements analyzed.

6. Paper III

Integrated approach to assess the environmental impact of mining 
activities: Part 1 – Multivariate statistical analysis to estimate the 
spatial distribution of soil contamination in the Panasqueira mining 
area (central Portugal)

Abstract

In this study selected geochemical results are presented in order to access a better understanding of 

the dynamics inherent to leaching, transport, and accumulation of some potential toxic elements in soil 

and their environmental relevance.

The principal component analysis revealed the association of the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W, Zn elements 

which are strongly correlated. This group is controlled by the geochemical signature of the Panasqueira 

sulfi de mineralization. The Pollution Load Index presented a mean value of 5 and a minimum of 1 on the 

upper soil horizon (topsoil), revealing pollution on the global area. Results revealed also that signifi cant 

concentrations of As, Bi, Cd and W are linked to the exchangeable and acid-soluble bearing-phases, 

upon which desorption and ion exchange reactions may originate the release of these readily mobile 

phases.

Local wind and hydrological factors are responsible for the elements dispersion. The wind promotes the 

mechanical dispersion of the rejected materials, from the milled waste rocks and the mineral processing 

plant, stored in the open air impoundments from Barroca Grande and Rio, and their deposition on soils 

and waters. Also the As and sulfi de-related heavy metals (such as Cu and Cd) are associated to the 

fi ne materials that are transported in suspension by surface waters or associated to the acidic waters, 

draining these sites and contaminating the local soils. Part of this fraction, especially for As, Cd and 

Cu, is temporally retained in solid phases by precipitation of soluble secondary minerals (through the 

precipitation of hydrated metal sulfates) in warm dry periods, but such minerals are easily dissolved 

during rainy periods.

In this table, also international and national literature reference soil values are presented. 
Casegas was chosen as regional geochemical background, once it was considered out of the 
mining infl uence, located NE upstream the mine location (see section 12.2). The main goal was 
the contents comparison between samples under mining infl uence and samples from a local

The comparative analysis reveals that Ag, As, Bi, Ca, Cd, Cu, P and W maximum values 
in topsoil samples are higher than the concentrations of subsurface soil samples. In 
opposition, elements such as Co, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo and Zn are higher on subsurface soil 
samples. According to the results it is possible to conclude that topsoil samples points to 
the anthropic contamination (geochemical signature of the mineralization), while subsurface 
soils are related to the geogenic features (elements associated to geological formations). The 
comparison of topsoil and subsurface soil samples mean values with the local geochemical 
background values highlighted that As, Bi, Cd and W elements are the most enriched (values 
ranging between 4x to 30x). Arsenic and W mean concentrations obtained for both depths 
are signifi cantly higher than the MVPS values (W: topsoil – 13x and subsurface soil – 4x; As: 
topsoil – 9x and subsurface soil – 7x, see Table 6.1). The mean As values exceeds also the 
EVPS (topsoil – 4x; subsurface soil – As 3x). In particularly the range of As contents in soils 
is larger than for the other elements in topsoil samples. Table 6.1 shows that, in topsoil, the 
variables with highest skewness (values &gt; 3.0) are Bi &gt; Ca &gt; As &gt; Cr &gt; W &gt; P &gt; Cu &gt; Ag &gt; Sb &gt; 
Th &gt; Sc &gt; Cd, while in subsurface soils the variables are Ca &gt; Sb &gt; Cr &gt; Bi &gt; P &gt; Ba &gt; Cd &gt; Sr 
&gt; Mo. The asymmetry observed in the data (Table 6.1) is due to the presence of outliers, which 
can endanger the spatial continuity of the variogram function and produce poor results when 
using parametric techniques like Ordinary Kriging. However, in this study these diffi culties are 
overcome as PCA produces new variables, the PCA components. This method reduces a 
set of observed variables into a smaller set of artifi cial variables called principal components 
(PC). This technique attempts to reveal the correlation structure of the variables allowing 
interpretation of geological and anthropogenic processes affecting the soil geochemical data. 
In order to characterize the studied area PCA was applied. A matrix of 117 (samples) x 30 
(chemical elements) of topsoil samples and a matrix of 113 (samples) x 30 (chemical elements) 
of subsurface soil samples were submitted to PCA. As stated previously, a regular grid (400 
m x 400 m – Fig. 2.1d) was used for soil sampling and some of these samples (5 topsoil and 3 
subsurface soil) were taken over the tailing, for that reason and because tailing material is not 
a soil these samples were removed from the PCA study. 

According to the Kaiser criterion the number of signifi cant principal components with 
eigenvalue higher than 1 were selected (Davis, 1986; Manly, 1994). PCA enabled the extraction 
of fi ve PC’s, for topsoil, explaining 69.09% of the total variance. For subsurface soil also fi ve 
PC’s were defi ned explaining 67.31% of the total variance.

For topsoil samples the fi rst component (PC1) explains 13 [Ga, Cr, V, Sc, Ni, Fe, Al, Ba, Co, 
Th, La, K, Mg] of the 30 variables with 25.03% of the total variance. Axis 2 (PC2) explains 12 
variables [Cu, Cd, Ag, Zn, Sr, Ca, (As), Mn, P, Bi, (W) in opposition to Th – already explained 
in PC1] with a variance of 17.07%. PC3 explains cleary 5 variables [As, Tl, Bi, Ti in opposition 
to Sr (also explained in PC2)] with 12.92% of the total variance. The fourth component (PC4) 
explains 2 variables [K, Ti] already explained in PC1 and PC3 respectively and has 8.00% of 
the total variance. PC5 explains one variable [Se] with 6.07% of the total variance. 

The overview of the most representative variables projections distinguishes the existing 
proximities and oppositions (Cardoso, 1995). Figure 6.1 shows a graphical projection of the 
PCA (topsoil database) of the selected 30 variables coordinates, representing the correlation 
coeffi cients between them, in the different factorial plans (PC1/PC2; PC1/PC3). Four groups 
of variables can be identifi ed in the three factorial plans.

In the fi rst factorial plan (PC1/PC2 – Fig. 6.1a, representing 42.10% of the global information 
of the data set) the selected variables could be separated into three groups. A fi rst group

[Group i – Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, K, La, Mg, Ni, Sc, V] with positive loadings in PC1, reveals an 
association of elements strongly correlated between them [Spearman correlation coeffi cient 
higher than 0.70: Sc/V (r = 0.88), Cr/V (r = 0.80), Cr/Ga (r = 0.80), Al/Ga (r = 0.77), Mg/Ni (r = 
0.77), Fe/Ga (r = 0.75), Co/Ni (r = 0.74), Cr/Fe (r = 0.74), Ga/V (r = 0.74), Al/Cr (r = 0.73) – p 
&amp;lt;0.01] with small variability and represents an association of lithological elements driven by 
local geology. In this group it is possible to separate two sub-sets: one with positive loadings 
in PC1 and negative loadings in PC2 (Al, Cr, Fe, Ga, Tl, Ni, Sc, V variables) and another with 
positive loadings in PC1 and PC2 (Ba, K, Mg, Ni variables). These two sub-sets allow the 
separation between the argillaceous shales and the spotted argillaceous shales (Ba, K, Mg, 
Ni enrichment – see Table 6.2).

The group related to PC2 (group iii – Ag, As, Bi, Ca, Cu, Cd, Mn, P, Sr, W, Zn) reveals elements 
strongly correlated between them and with strong positive skewness (Sk &gt; 3.0, Table 6.1). 
Spearman correlation coeffi cient showed r ? 0.7 (p &amp;lt;0.01) between As/Bi (r = 0.87), Bi/Cu (r = 
0.78), As/Cu (r = 0.77), Bi/W (r = 0.77), Cd/Cu (r = 0.74) and Ag/Cu (r = 0.73).

The second factorial plan (PC1/PC3, representing 37.95% of total variance) is dominated by 
the association of Tl and Ti variables (group iv).

For subsurface soils 5 PC’s were extracted which explain 56.66% of the total variance. The 
fi rst component (PC1) explains 16 variables [Ni, Fe, Ga, Zn, Sc, V, Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Co, K, P, 
Ba, Mo, Ti] of the 30 variables with 27.93% of the total variance. The second component 
(PC2) explains 6 variables [Ca, Cd, Sr, P in opposition to Th and V] with 14.75% variance. The 
third component (PC3) explains 2 variables [W, As, and (Tl already explained also by PC1)] 
in opposition to Ba and Sr and (explained in PC1) with 10.56% variance. PC4 explains one 
variable [Mo] having 7.76% variance and PC5 explains the 2 variables [Mg, Al] with 6.30% 
variance. 

The subsurface soil samples projection of the 30 variables studied on the 2 factorial planes

and paragenesis (As, Co, Cu, Zn – separated by positive scores of axis 2). Axis 2 represents 
the association of [Ca, Cd, P, Sr] (group iii) and group ii (Th) (Fig. 6.2a). Axis 3 is formed by group 
iv (As, Tl, W negative scores). Four other groups were formed: group v (K, Ti) and group vi (Mo) 
on the axis 4 and group vii (Sb) and group viii (Mg) in axis 5. Spearman correlation coeffi cient 
showed strong correlations (r ? 0.7, p &amp;lt;0.01) between Cr/Ga (r = 0.87), K/Ti (r = 0.85), Ti/Tl (r 
= 0.83), As/Bi (r = 0.83), Sc/V (r = 0.82), Cr/V (r = 0.82), Ga/V (r = 0.81), Co/Mn (r = 0.81), K/Tl

n – number of topsoil samples/number of subsurface soil samples; na – not applicable.

In topsoil samples the highest pollution load index was registered in Rio (PLI
mean

 = 14) mostly 
due to the high concentrations of W and Cd in this area that exceed the background value, 
respectively, as much as 245x and 107x. Also the highest concentrations of Bi, Ag and As 
were found in Rio soil samples. Only Zn presents in Barroca Grande soils slightly higher 
concentrations than in Rio samples. The concentration factor (CF) values, determined in Rio, 
were very high mainly due to W (up to 571), Cd (up to 300), Bi (up to 215), Ag (up to 34) and 
As (up to 14). These values are indicative of serious soil pollution. According to these results, 
the Rio area contains very high levels of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTE’s), even if the total 
concentrations are conditioned by the samples locations, for example, As values ranges from 
53 to 3640 mg kg-1, with a mean value of 710 mg kg-1 and a background value of 22 mg kg-1. 
The total abundance of Ag, Bi, Cd and W mean concentrations are 32, 55, 107 and 245x, 



96 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach

respectively, higher than the background value defi ned in Casegas area. Although the CF 
values, determined for Cu (10) and for Zn (3), are signifi cantly lower than the CF’s determined 
for the others elements, both Cu and Zn present results above 1 (Table 6.3).

In Barroca Grande area the PLI results, for topsoil samples, ranges between 2 and 15, with 
a mean value of 7. The CF is also high, especially for Cd (up to 150), W (up to 89), Ag (up 
to 20) and As (up to 15). According to these results Barroca Grande contains very high 
concentrations of Cd, W, Ag and As, being higher than the background levels, respectively, 
47, 30, 5 and 7 times.

Subsurface soils also present higher maximum PLI values in Rio area (up to 15), mostly due to 
the high concentrations of W, which are 42x higher than the background guide value. Also Cd, 
Bi and As present high soil concentrations. Barroca Grande subsurface soil samples present 
a higher mean PLI result (7), and also the CF of Cd (up to 150), Bi (up to 51) and As (up to 13) 
present the higher values. Cadmium, W, Bi and As have the highest concentrations in this 
area, being respectively 32, 17, 9 and 6 times higher than the background values.

6.2. Discussion

One of the main goals of this study is to assess the extent of the soil pollution due to the 
present and past mining activities and erosion of the tailing materials. To determine the spatial 
geochemical structure of the variables defi ned by the PCA experimental variograms were 
constructed and modeled. All variograms were modeled with exponential functions. Table 
6.4 shows the parameters of model function fi tted to the experimental variograms of the 3 
PC’s retained and also for the PLI results for each soil type. The estimation of the spatial 
distribution of each PC and PLI was then achieved by ordinary kriging and the respective 
maps were produced.

Figure 6.3 shows the spatial distribution of the selected factors allowing the identifi cation 
of the geochemical/geological processes within the study area in what concerns to
topsoil samples. 

The high positive score values on PC1 topsoil map (Fig. 6.3a) indicates geochemical anomalies 
correlated to the local geology. Geologically the studied area is divided in two general geological 
units (Fig. 2.1d): the western area (A) contains argillaceous shales, schists and quartzites.

The eastern area (B), due to the infl uence of the contact metamorphism with the granite 
intrusion, is underlain dominantly by argillaceous spotted shales (clorite±biotite±moscovite/
sericite and according some authors cordierite [Mg

]), schists and quartzites 

(Polya, 1989). It is also important to mention that the Beira Schist Formation was subjected 
to lower greenschist grade regional metamorphism during the early compressive stages 
of the Hercynian Orogeny. Polya (1989) established the following paragenetic association 
for regional metamorphism of pelitic series: quartz–albite–chlorite–muscovite–paragonite. 
According to this author the metasediments presents high Al

show higher SiO

According to Table 6.2, the spotted schists are enriched in As, Mg and Mn when compared 
with the argillaceous schists sampled in Casegas (background area). Few mafi c rocks 
(dolerites) were observed, particularly near S. Jorge da Beira (NW–SE subvertical). The rock is 
fi ne grained and micro-porphyritic and chiefl y consists of labradorite [(Ca,Na)(Al,Si)

], and 

amphibolitized pyroxene. Also quartz veins, parallel to the schistosity, are related to the low 
grade of metamorphism (Thadeu, 1951). 

The spatial distribution of topsoil PC2 (positive scores – Fig. 6.3b) reveals a separation of soil 
samples infl uenced by the proximity to pollution sources, and also from past mining activities 
during the WWI and WWII periods (locally named as “Kilo”). This group appears to be controlled 
by the geochemical signature of the sulfi de mineralization, once all the elements present in this 
factor are representative of the paragenesis associated to the different phases. These elements 
still maintain a close relationship in the secondary environment. Silver minerals with a high 
Ag content such as matildite [AgBiS

2
] may be responsible for a great part of the silver present 

in samples. Argentiferous stannite [Cu
2
(Fe,Zn)SnS

4
] will also contribute to the total amount 

of silver present in the chalcopyrite concentrate, as stannite is a common minor constituent. 
Other rare minerals such as canfi eldite [Ag

] and pavonite [(Ag,Cu)(Bi,Pb)

3
S

5
] play also a 

subordinate role as contributors of silver. All these minerals mainly occur in chalcopyrite and 
are extracted with the chalcopyrite concentrate. Minor silver, however, is lost in the sulfi de 
tailings (Wimmers, 1983). This can be explained by the presence of some of the matildite in 
arsenopyrite, which goes into the tailings. According to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013, in section

Rio tailings (D – Fig. 6.3b). The mud dams (in Rio and Barroca Grande) contain high levels of As, 
Cd, Cu and Zn (e-Ecorisk, 2007). According to these authors, the Rio tailing samples contained

Rio dam consists predominantly of quartz, mica, feldspar, illite-vermiculite, arsenopyrite, 
marcasite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite. Other minerals, like scorodite and natrojarosite, 
are also present. The XRD analysis of the active dam sample of Barroca Grande revealed 
the presence of scorodite, arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite [Fe

[KAl

], while the sample from the old dam of Barroca Grande contained quartz, 

pyrite, chalcopyrite, wolframite (ferberite), and scorodite (Ávila et al., 2008b). The sample 
collected in the tailing materials of Barroca Grande consists predominantly of arsenopyrite, 
wolframite (ferberite), quartz and muscovite. The presence of P, Sr and Ca variables in this 
association could represent the infl uence of the late carbonate phase of the paragenesis. 
In this phase is possible to identify calcite [CaCO

]. Other rare 

minerals are fi nd such as thadeuite [(Mg(Ca,Mn)(Mg,Fe,Mn)

related to the hydrothermal weathering and Bloot and Wolf (1953) relates the presence of 
carbonates to diagenesis process. Sousa (1985) refers also the occurrence of phosphatic 
levels, in the conglomeratic sequences.

The association of group iii is essentially anthropogenic and is related to the minerals belonging 
to the primary paragenesis, such as arsenopyrite [FeAsS]; bismuthinite [Bi

], 

rejected during the tungsten separation process and deposition in the tailing and mud dam. 
The interactions water-minerals at the waste dump surface, leads to the generation of acid 
mine drainage with high contents of metals and sulfate, related to the sulfi des alteration. The 
alteration degree of these sulfi des is recorded in the geochemical evolution of the primary 
paragenesis and leads to the emergence of a new mineralogy with neoformation minerals, 
such as scorodite, melanterite, szomolnokite and rozenite. These secondary minerals play an 
important role in the natural retention of oxyanions and divalent cations like Cu, Zn and Pb, 
for example, due to the elements capture by sorption and precipitation and the precipitation 
and dissolution of such secondary minerals are processes strongly infl uenced by seasonal 
wetting and drying cycles. Climate, can be an important instability factor, and in this region 
it is aggressive very hot and dry during summer and very cold, rainy, and windy in the winter. 
Due to these phenomena soils appear to be a good receptor of some of the metals present in 
the primary and also the secondary mineralogy.

Figure 6.4 shows the spatial distribution of the selected factors of subsurface soils allowing the 
identifi cation of the geochemical/geological processes within the study area. Table 6.4 shows 
the parameters of model function fi tted to the experimental variograms of the 4 PC’s retained 
for subsurface soils.

The estimated map of the subsurface soil samples PC1 spatial distribution can be observed 
in Fig. 6.4a. High positive values indicate geochemical anomalies lie within the local geology. 
PC1 mapping allow a better separation between the area related to the argillaceous spotted 
schists (B) and the argillaceous schists (A). In this case As variable represents a mixture

spotted schists and also the infl uence of the Barroca and Rio tailings and mud impoundments 
(see Table 6.2). PC2 spatial distribution identifi es clearly the areas near the tailings and also 
the presence of the dolerite rocks. As observed in topsoil samples the association between 
As and Tl is also clear in subsurface soil samples and identifi es the area with the argillaceous 
spotted schists.

(PLI) mapping for topsoil

estimated on the basis 
of the concentration 
factors of Ag, As, Bi, 
Cd, Cu, W and Zn. (I – 
Barroca Grande; II – S. 
Francisco de Assis; III – 
Rio).

The PLI results clearly point out that soils collected near the waste tailings presents higher 
contamination indices than the soils samples collected in the mine surroundings. In both areas 
(Fig. 6.5) the mine wastes are a mixture of weakly to strongly sulfi dic rock and non-mineralized 
host rock materials.

According to Ávila et al. (2008b) the materials collected in the active and old dam and tailing of 
Barroca Grande and in the Rio tailing and mud impoundment revealed very high concentrations 
of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, V, Mn, W and Zn. The highest PLI values identifi ed near Barroca Grande (I), 
São Francisco de Assis (II) and Rio (III) confi rms that the mechanical and chemical dispersion 
continuously occurs from Barroca Grande and Rio tailings and mud impoundments. Most of

the samples (? 70% total samples) collected in Barroca Grande (I), São Francisco de Assis 
(II) and Rio (III) locations have mean PLI values &gt;7.0, clearly showing a very high degree of 
contamination.

Chemical forms of heavy metals in soils directly infl uence their bioavailability and toxicity 
(Zhou and Sun, 2002; Ma and Rao, 1997; Tessier et al., 1979).Trace metals can be transported 
in the secondary geological environment by different chemical mechanisms (Gibbs, 1973): (a) 
in solution or adsorbed on solids, being readily available in these conditions; (b) in organic 
compounds or metallic hydroxides, for which chemical changes are required before they are 
released; and (c) in the crystal structure of some minerals, where they are generally unavailable 
for the ecosystems.

Two soil samples (A1 and A2 – selected according their PLI spatial distribution) were submitted 
to Sequential Chemical Extraction in order to estimate the distribution of Ag, As, Cd, Cu, 
Fe, Mn, W and Zn among the geochemical bearing phases, which accounts for the relative 
proportions of each trace metal transported by the mechanical and chemical agents. Figure 
6.6 shows the geochemical partitioning of some selected elements in those fractions of each 
sample.

According to the results, As is linked to sulfi des since a considerable proportion is extracted 
by aqua regia (F4 – 66.7 to 68.4%) which refl ects the presence of arsenopyrite in the analyzed 
samples. The amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) are also important 
bearing phases of this element. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very low (0.04 to 
0.05%) however the related As concentrations values (0.4–0.7 mg kg-1) could be considered 
very high. Silver, Cd, Cu and Mn show similar SCE patterns suggesting that these elements 
are linked to amorphous Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides and also to sulfi de or clay minerals (part of 
these elements was extracted with aqua regia). Cadmium was also greatly extracted with 
sodium acetate (10.3 to 13.9% of extraction – 1.9 to 4 mg kg-1 for Cd) indicating that soluble/
exchangeable/carbonate fraction is the preferential sink for Cd. Iron is mostly extracted by

aqua regia (Step 4 – % of extraction ranging from 39.2% to 69.3%), suggesting also the 
presence of sulfi des. However, considerable proportion of this metal (up to 50% in sample 
A1) appears to be also associated to the remaining silicates. It must be pointed out that the 
percentage of extraction associated to amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides 
ranges between 8.3% and 9.4%. The highest percentage of W extraction, related to the 
last two steps of extraction, shows that W is highly resistant to both chemical and physical 
weathering and can be transported long distances from the source areas. The mobility of 
W is intermediate to low in neutral pH water (Rose et al., 1979). The principal ore mineral, 
wolframite, is similar to cassiterite in resistance to chemical weathering but is somewhat less 
resistant than cassiterite to physical weathering. Tungsten minerals are brittle and readily break 
down into fi ne particles that disperse in fi ne-grained sediment. Zinc is mainly associated with 
Amorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn oxides and clays. The results also show also that a 
signifi cant percentage of this element could be released under oxidizing conditions.

The results of the environmental risk assessment according to RAC (Risk Assessment Code) 
show that most of the elements are classifi ed in the low risk category except Cd that posed 
low to medium risk (results of % of extraction ranges from 10 to 13% of extraction associated 
to F1). These soluble/exchange fraction (F1) is a loosely bound phase and liable to change with 
environmental conditions such as pH changes (Xie et al., 2013). However, metals associated 
with F2 are thermodynamically unstable and must be considered as direct effect phases. 
Considering both F1 and F2 results, Ag, Cd, Cu and Zn are classifi ed with very high risk in the 
two analyzed samples, while As are classifi ed wirh medium risk. Tungsten presents no risk 
which is consistent with his strong resistance to chemical weathering.

Integrated approach to assess the environmental impact of mining 
activities: Part 2 – Potential risk of exposure to hazardous materials in 
the Panasqueira mining area (central Portugal)

Abstract

This work was undertaken to determine, mainly, the assessment of soil contamination and the evaluation 

of the ecological and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous materials. The metal assemblage 

identifi ed in soils (Ag–As–Bi–Cd–Cu–W–Zn; PTE’s; Paper III in section 6 of this thesis) refl ects the infl uence 

of the tailings and open impoundments materials, due to several agents including the wind dispersion 

and the subsequent deposition in soils. PTE’s and pH presents positive correlation confi rming that heavy 

metal mobility holds a positive correlation with pH therefore affecting their availability. The contamination 

factor determined has classifi ed 92.6% of soil samples with moderate to ultra-high degree of pollution. 

As for the risk factor for individual element potential pollution factor and potential ecological risk the 

results suggest that As, Cu and Zn presents a low potential ecological risk, W shows a very high risk 

in superfi cial soils (topsoil) and Cd presents very high environmental risk. The spatial distribution of the 

potential ecological risk index (PERI) has classifi ed the topsoil with a very high ecological risk, consistent 

with wind direction. Non-carcinogenic hazard and carcinogenic risk of topsoil from Panasqueira mine 

and surroundings results showed that, for children (1–6 years), Ag, Cd, Cu, W and Zn do not present a 

non-carcinogenic hazard but for As the non-carcinogenic hazard is representing a high health risk. The 

carcinogenic risks, both to children and adult reveals a very high cancer risk mostly due to As ingestion.

7.1.1. Distribution of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn in soil samples

Previous studies (Paper III in section 6 of this thesis), that were carried out in Panasqueira 
area, in order to determine the contents of selected elements in soils samples collected in 
two depths (topsoil and subsurface soil) allowed, through the topsoil concentrations, the 
characterization of the anthropogenic soils contamination due to the presence of tailings and 
open air impoundments, while subsurface soil samples permitted the establishment of the 
local geochemical background. This area is constituted, mainly, by incipient and lithic soils 
derived from a metasediment substrate (cambisols).

Descriptive statistical parameters (mean, median and range) for pH, SOM, Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, 
W and Zn elements are summarized in Table 7.1. These values were compared with Ag, As, Bi, 
Cd, Cu, W and Zn local geochemical background values and also with reference values from 
the literature).

The results concerning the organic matter, point out for topsoil SOM values ranging from 5.7 
to 39.0% (see Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.1 SOM (a)) while subsurface soil SOM values ranges from 3.6 
to 19.5% (see Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.1 SOM (b)). Comparing the topsoil and subsurface soil pH and 
SOM maps (Fig. 7.1) is possible to observe that areas with the highest SOM values are related 
with areas with the lowest pH values.

To evaluate the presence of possible local anomalies the Ag (Fig. 7.1), As, Bi, Cd (Fig. 7.2), Cu, 
W, Zn (Fig. 7.3) mean, median and maximum values observed in topsoil were compared with 
the results obtained for subsurface soil. From the analysis of Table 7.1, it is also possible to 
conclude that Ag, As, Bi, Cu, W, and Zn show highest values of mean, median and maximum 
for topsoil when compared with subsurface soil. The results clearly show that there are higher 
contents in both depth soils when compared with local geochemical background. The behavior 
of the topsoil elements may refl ect the infl uence of the Barroca Grande and Rio tailings and 
open air impoundments, possibly due to wind transport and deposition.

Pearson’s correlation was carried out to determine the relationships between Ag, As, Bi, 
Cd, Cu, W and Zn elements and also with pH and SOM. Topsoil (Table 7.2) presents many 
signifi cant correlation coeffi cients and some with very strong correlations (As/Ag, As/Bi,

&amp;lt;0.01). The strongest correlations registered are between Ag/Cu (0.94), As/Ag (0.90) and Bi/W 
(0.90). There is also a positive correlation, but lower, between PTE’s and pH. Several authors 
claim that heavy metal mobility holds a positive correlation with pH (Yuan and Lavkulich, 1997; 
Hettiarachchi et al., 2003; Antoniadis et al., 2008). pH affects heavy metals availability, being 
the major contributor to the ability of soils for retaining heavy metals in an exchangeable form 
(Zeng et al., 2011). With low SOM the pH values may become relatively more important for the 
partitioning of metals. Most elements are low negatively correlated with SOM. For subsurface 
soil samples the PTE’s correlation also presents some signifi cant coeffi cients, but lower than 
in topsoil. The stronger correlations are between As/Bi (r = 0.75) and Bi/Cu (r = 0.69). At this 
depth, pH is also the most signifi cant soil property, presenting positive correlations with the 
PTE’s excepting for W.

In order to identify which factor is more important in spatial control of the different PTE’s 
concentrations, a two-way ANOVA was performed. In this study two models were formed as 
grouping variables, (a) depth–SOM and (b) depth–pH. The results of the test between subjects 
for the independent variables depth and SOM (Table 7.3) showed that depth accounts for 
signifi cant variations between the group means of: Bi (p = 0.035; ? = 0.050), Cd (p = 0.015; 
? = 0.050) and W (p = 0.009; ? = 0.050). The independent variable SOM show signifi cant 
variations in the concentration of: As (p = 0.021; ? = 0.050), Bi (p = 0.068; ? = 0.075), W (p 
= 0.013; ? = 0.050) and Zn (p = 0.021; ? = 0.050). No signifi cant interaction was highlighted 
between the depth and SOM. In the analysis depth–pH (Table 7.4) the ANOVA test showed 
that there are signifi cant variations with depth for most PTE’s (Ag: p = 0.071, ? = 0.075; As: 
p = 0.027, ? = 0.050; Bi: p = 0.001, ? = 0.050; Cd: p &amp;lt;0.001, ? = 0.050 and W: p &amp;lt;0.001; 
? = 0.050) except for Cu and Zn. The pH variable presented a signifi cant variation for Ag (p 
= 0.031; ? = 0.050), W (p = 0.001; ? = 0.050) and Zn (p &amp;lt;0.001; ? = 0.050). The interaction 
between pH*depth shown no signifi cant variations (p &gt; 0.050), except on the concentration of 
Cu (p = 0.038; ? = 0.050) and Zn (p = 0.065; ? = 0.075). 

7.1.2. Quantitative assessment of soil contamination

In this study, a simplifi ed approach to assess soil contamination based on comparing the 
measured concentrations in the Panasqueira soils with the geochemical baseline values 
for Casegas was adopted. Table 7.5 shows the results of contamination factors (CF) and the 
modifi ed degree of contamination (mC

d
) for the selected elements in topsoil and subsurface 

soils, and also in Casegas soils.

mapping for topsoil (a)

Values were estimated 
on the basis of the 
concentration factors of 
Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and 
Zn. (A – Barroca Grande; 
B – S. Francisco de Assis; 
C – Rio).

According to results the topsoil mean values of the contamination factor of Bi, Cd and W 
present extremely high degree of contamination while Ag and As present high contamination 
factor. The results demonstrated that mC

d
 values vary from the minimum 1.2 to the maximum 

149.9 with a mean value of 10.6. The cumulative frequency distribution put in evidence that 
only 7.4% of the soil samples were classifi ed as nil to low degree of pollution with mC

d 
values 

&lt;2.0, and the remaining soil samples (92.6%) registered moderate to ultra-high degree of 
pollution with mC

d
 values equal or greater than 2.0 (27.9% between 2 ? mC

 &amp;lt;16; 15.6% between 16 ? mC

d
 &amp;lt;32 and 

2.5% between 32 ? mC
d
). The enrichment is more pronounced in topsoil (subsurface soil mC

d
 

values ranged 1.2 to 26.4). Casegas, fi rstly considerer as a not contaminated site, once is out 
of the mine and winds infl uence, showed a maximum mC

d
 value of 13.1, representing a very 

high contamination degree, mostly due to Cd and W contamination factors, probably due to 
geogenic contamination since this is a natural enriched and mineralized zone.

Once calculated the mC
d
 values it is now possible to assess the spatial distribution of the 

modifi ed degree of contamination. The fi rst step is the determination of the spatial structure 
of the new variables, for that the experimental variograms were determined and modeled with 
exponential functions, according to the estimated parameters (topsoil: main direction – 90; C

0
 

– 30; C
1
 – 330; length – 1,200; anisotropy ratio – 1.81 and subsurface soil: main direction – 90; 

C
0
 – 0; C

1
 – 19; length – 900; anisotropy ratio – 2.90). Estimation of the spatial distribution was 

then achieved by ordinary kriging and the respective map produced. In Fig. 7.4 it is possible to 
observe the mC

d
 spatial distribution revealing areas with very high values.

According to Fig. 7.4 the samples collected near the Barroca Grande tailing (A), Rio tailing (B) 
and the mud impoundments stand clearly for the most enriched soils in Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, 
W and Zn (100% of both depths samples from Barroca Grande exceeded for As, Bi, Cd and 
W the baseline values for Portugal, while in Rio only Zn present some samples (25%) lower 
than the guide value). According to Ávila et al. (2008a), the Barroca Grande tailing and open 
impoundments have high As, Cd, Cu, Pb, W, and Zn concentrations (mean content in the

montmorillonite, montmorillonite-vermiculite, and chlorite, and also arsenopyrite, wolframite, 
and natrojarosite. The dams in Barroca Grande may pose a signifi cant potential threat, due to

the fi ne-grained nature of the materials and its location with respect to the Casinhas stream 
that cross S. Francisco de Assis village. The XRD analysis of the impoundment material 
revealed the presence of scorodite, arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite, and muscovite. 
These tailings and impoundment material are metal-enriched at a level, likely to be toxic to 
the ecosystem (Ávila et al., 2008a). The concentrations exceed the values defi ned for the 90th 

percentile of the South Portuguese Zone (As = 157 mg kg-1; Cu = 108 mg kg-1; Ni = 62 mg kg-1; 
Pb = 117 mg kg-1; Zn = 134 mg kg-1) which is indicative of enrichment in trace metals. This Ag–
As–Bi–Cd–Cu–W–Zn association is quite logical and linked to the Panasqueira paragenetic 
association. The highest mC

d
 values identifi ed near Barroca Grande (A), São Francisco de 

Assis (B) and Rio (C) confi rms that the mechanical and chemical dispersion from Barroca 
Grande and Rio tailings and mud impoundments occurs. Most of the samples (90% or higher 
of total samples) collected in Barroca Grande (A), São Francisco de Assis (B) and Rio (C) 
villages shows mC

d
 values &gt;8.0, clearly showing a very high degree of contamination.

7.1.3. Potential ecological risk factor and risk index

The topsoil and subsurface soil samples results for individual element potential pollution factor 
and potential ecological risk are presented in Table 7.6. In both depths, As, Cu and Zn presents 
low potential ecological risk, with mean values&amp;lt;40. W also show a low risk in subsurface soil, 
but a very high risk in topsoil, while Bi shows a moderate risk in depth and a considerable risk 
in topsoil. Ag is classifi ed with a moderate to considerable ecological risk, while Cd presents 
a very high ecological risk in both depths. The topsoil risk factor is ranked as: Cd &gt; W &gt; Bi &gt; 
Ag &gt; As &gt; Cu &gt; Zn while for subsurface soil is ranked as: Cd &gt; Ag &gt; Bi &gt; As &gt; W &gt; Cu &gt; Zn. 
These results suggest a very high environmental risk, especially for Cd.

In order to estimate the global potential ecological risk in the study area, the PERI was 
computed. The median and mean values classify both depths soils with a very high risk (Table 
7.6). The cumulative analysis show that in both depths none of the samples displayed a low 
grade of risk (&lt;150) and only 7.4% of topsoil presented a moderate risk index. PERI classifi ed 
92.6% of topsoil samples as high to very high ecological risk. The same occurs for 61.2% of 
subsurface soil, what should be considered as an extensive problem. Figure 7.5 represents the 
PERI spatial distribution. Topsoil have a wide area classifi ed with a very high ecological risk, 
which is consistent with the wind direction, the water courses and the actual and previous 
exploration and benefi ciation locations (Fig. 7.5a). The subsurface soil also present a very high

with the ones obtained for the individual Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn maps (Fig. 7.1, 7.2 and 
7.3) and the mC

 map (Fig. 7.4), with the same affected areas.

7.1.4. Human health risk assessment

Both non-carcinogenic hazard (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (Risk
pathway

) of Panasqueira mine 
and surroundings topsoil, through the different pathways (ingestion, dermal and inhalation), 
were estimated according to the human health risk assessment model (USDoE, 2013). The 
cumulative hazard index (HI) and total risk (RISK) were also characterized for multi-pathway 
routes in resident population.

For the non-carcinogenic effects it was studied the most conservative exposure condition 
– children (1–6 years old). The soils potentially toxic elements defi ned in this study (Ag, Cd, 
Cu, W and Zn), apart from As, do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard for children in  the 
Panasqueira area (maximum HI

child–Ag,Cd,Cu,W,Zn

percentage of the bioaccessible orally ingested fraction of each metal from soils samples 
(Drexler and Brattin, 2007; Luo et al., 2011b, 2012a). Also additional investigations must be 
made on different sample media, such as vegetables, rhizosphere soils, irrigation and drinking 
waters and street dusts on the local villages under infl uence of mining activities (such as 
S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca) and also in villages considered as blank areas (such 
as Casegas and Unhais-o-Velho). These studies will allow determining the infl uence of the 
Panasqueira mine activities through more than 110 years, on the surrounding populations.

Heavy metal pollution in mine–soil–plant system in S. Francisco de 
Assis – Panasqueira mine (Portugal)

Abstract

The oxidation of sulfi des can result in the mobilization and migration of trace metals/metalloids from the 

mining wastes into the environment, releasing contaminants into the ecosystem. In order to evaluate the 

extent of the environmental contamination impact on agricultural and residential soils due to the mining 

activities it was conducted a geochemical survey in S. Francisco de Assis village. Rhizosphere soil 

samples, vegetables (Solanum Tubersum Sava and Brassica Olerácea L.) which constitute an important 

portion of the inhabitant’s diet, irrigation waters and street dusts were collected in private residences. 

According to the Ontario Guidelines (Ministry of the Environment, 2011), the arsenic contents in the 

rhizosphere soils exceed 20 times the reference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1). The results 

obtained showed that some edible plants frequently used in the region could be enriched in these 

metals/metalloids and may represent a serious hazard if consumed. The potatoes tend to have a 

preferential accumulation in the leaves and roots while in cabbages most elements have a preferential 

accumulation in the roots. An index of the risk for residents, due to ingesting of these metals/metalloids, 

by consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area, was calculated and the result indicates 

that the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village are probably exposed to some potential health risks 

through the intake of arsenic, cadmium and also lead by consuming their vegetables.

8.1. Results and discussion

8.1.1. Rhizosphere soils

The previous study (see section 6 – Paper III) determined the contents of selected elements in 
soils samples, collected in two depths, from superfi cial soil (topsoil, Soil

0
) and from a depth 

of 15 cm (Soil
15

). Topsoil samples allowed the characterization of superfi cial contamination 
coming from the tailings, while subsurface samples makes possible the establishment of the 
local geochemical background. To evaluate the presence of possible local anomalies, the 
mean, median and maximum contents of the rhizosphere soils (Soil

R
) were compared with the 

subsurface soil
 
concentrations obtained.

Table 8.1 presents the median values of pH and SOM in soil samples. The rhizosphere soil (Soil
R
) 

shows a median pH of 6.3 and are classifi ed, according to the United States Department of 
Agriculture (www.nrcs.usda.gov), as slightly acid (6.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.5) while the geogenic soils 
from 15 cm depth (median pH = 4.2) are classifi ed as acidic soils (3.5 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;4.4). The SOM 
present median values of 12.2% in Soil

R
 and 10.2% in Soil

15
, showing that these soils are 

medium organic soils with 10% &amp;lt;SOM &amp;lt;30% (Perrin, 1974).

Soil pH and SOM strongly affect soil functions and plant nutrient availability. Specifi cally, 
pH infl uences chemical solubility and availability of plant essential nutrients, pesticide 
performance, and organic matter decomposition. SOM serves multiple functions in the soil, 
including nutrient storage and soil aggregation (McCauley et al., 2009). 

From the analysis of Table 8.1, it is also possible to conclude that As, Ba, Cu, Mn, Sr, and Zn show 
large variations in mean, median and maximum values. For all these elements, the difference 
between both kinds of samples clearly shows that there are higher contents in Soil

R
 when 

compared with local geochemical background. The behavior of the elements in Soil
R
 may refl ect 

the infl uence of the Barroca Grande tailings and open impoundments, due to wind dispersion
and deposition. 

According to Ávila et al. (2008a), the Barroca Grande tailings and open impoundments have 
high As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sn, W, and Zn concentrations (mean content in the more coarse tailings 
material As = 7,142 mg kg-1; Cd = 56 mg kg-1; Cu = 2,501 mg kg-1; Pb = 172 mg kg-1; Sn = 679 
mg kg-1; W = 5,400 mg kg-1 and Zn = 1,689 mg kg-1 and mean content in the impoundment 
material (rejected from the mill operations) As = 44,252 mg kg-1 ; Cd = 491 mg kg-1; Cu = 4,029 
mg kg-1; Pb = 166 mg kg-1; Sn = 454 mg kg-1; W = 3,380 mg kg-1 and Zn = 3,738 mg kg-1). 
The mineralogy of these tailings was mainly quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, illite–montmorilonite, 
montmorilonite–vermiculite, and chlorite, and also arsenopyrite, wolframite, and natrojarosite 
The dam in Barroca Grande may pose a signifi cant potential threat due to the fi ne-grained 
nature of the materials and its location with respect to the Casinhas stream that cross SFA 
village. The XRD analysis of the impoundment material revealed the presence of scorodite, 
arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite, and muscovite. These tailings and impoundment 
material are metal-enriched at a level likely to be toxic to the ecosystem (Ávila et al., 2008a).

The coexistence of wolframite, cassiterite, sulfi des, carbonates, and silicates is responsible 
for the peculiar behavior in the tailings surface environment. Weathering of sulfi de-rich 
materials results in AMD at the Panasqueira mine. During runoff events, rain water infi ltrates 
the tailings and dissolves secondary minerals, producing strongly acidic water (pH 3.0; Ávila 
et al., 2008a). The low pH keeps the trace elements dissolved and increases remobilization 
and spatial distribution. This scenario leads to the high contents of metals verifi ed in the

village agricultural soils, some of them with acid pH and others near neutral pH (5.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;
6.9). According to McCauley et al. (2009) acid conditions occur in soil having parent material 
high in silica, high levels of sand with low buffering capacities (ability to resist pH change), and 
in regions with high amounts of precipitation. An increase in precipitation causes increased 
leaching of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) and the soil pH is lowered. Acidic soils are 
most commonly found in areas where soils were formed from siliceous parental material, 
forest soils and mining sites containing pyrite (McCauley et al., 2009).

Considering that the sampling area is located in an inhabited village and that the local 
population strongly depends on the use of soil for their subsistence (agriculture, cattle 
breeding and forestry), it is useful to compare the As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, 
Sb, Zn concentrations in soil with the reference values proposed by the Ontario soil quality 
guidelines (Ministry of the Environment, 2011) and also with the national median concentrations 
proposed by Ferreira (2004; Table 8.2).

According to these values, the soils from SFA exceed, for example, for As twenty times the 
Ontario reference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1) and ten times the national median 
concentrations (22 mg kg-1) proposed by Ferreira (2004). The estimated EI values for soils are 
elevated ranging from 1.0 to 12.2 (Fig. 8.1), mainly due to the presence of signifi cant contents of 
As, Cu and also Cd and Pb. Comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that the majority 
of the samples exceed the severe effect level for As and Cu (100% of samples), Cd (50% of 
samples), Pb (53% of samples) and Zn (47% of samples), being deemed ‘‘grossly polluted’’. 

According to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013; in section 12.5) the high levels of As in these soils 
seems to be linked to sulfi des, since a considerable proportion is extracted by aqua regia 
(F4 – 66.7 to 68.4%). This high percentage associated with sulfi des refl ects the presence of 
arsenopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) seems 
to be also important metal bearing-phases. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very

low (0.04 to 0.05%); however, the As concentrations associated with this extraction values 
(0.4–0.7 mg kg-1) may be considered very high. Also according to the same author Cd, Cu 
and Pb show high (and similar) partitioning patterns in the studied soil samples (64.8–74.4%, 
49.5–54.9%, 46.2–56.3% of extraction by hydroxylamine leach cold, respectively), suggesting 
that these may be linked, to some extent, to amorphous Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides. Moreover, 
part of these elements was extracted with aqua regia in both samples, suggesting that these 
elements may also be linked, to some extent, to sulfi de or clay minerals. It was also shown 
that Cd (10.3–13.9% of extraction, 1.9–4 mg kg?1 for Cd) were also extracted to a great extent 
with sodium acetate indicating that the soluble/exchangeable/carbonate fraction is probably 
a preferential sink for Cd. 

These elements (e.g. As, Cd or Pb) are the most toxic for humans, as well as for animals and 
can even lead to death by ingestion in large doses, or over large periods of time. Exposure 
to hazardous elements may have different pathways, being one of them the ingestion of 
vegetables grown on contaminated soils.

8.1.2. Street dusts

Street dust originated from the interaction of solid and liquid materials are produced from 
different sources and deposited on the streets. The composition and quantitication of chemical 
matrix of street dusts are indicators of environmental pollution (Banerjee, 2003). Street dusts 
receives varying inputs of heavy metals from a diversity of mobile or stationary sources 
such as vehicles emissions, industrial plants, power generation plants, oil burning, waste 
incineration, construction and demolition activities as well as resuspension of surrounding 
contaminated soils (Ahmed and Ishiga, 2006; Al-Khashman, 2007; Atiemo et al., 2011). These 
inputs contribute signifi cantly to the pollution of urban environment. This makes the study 
of street dusts important for determining the origin, distribution and level of heavy metal in 
urban surface environments. Elevated levels of heavy metal contents are the result of human 
activities and as a result, the adverse effects of poor environmental conditions on human 
health are most evident in the affected environments.

Exposure to heavy metals in street dusts can occur by means of ingestion trough vegetables 
that grow near streets, inhalation and dermal contact. The adverse effects of heavy metals 
in street dust include respiratory system disorders, nervous system interruptions, endocrine 
system malfunction, immune system suppression and the risk of cancer in later life (Ferreira-
Baptista and De Miguel, 2005).

Most mining and quarrying wastes obtained from grinding of rocks are placed in deposits in 
specifi c locations/regions and can be reused in earthworks and construction, in particular the 
coarser fractions. Typical applications include use in asphalt pavements. In the SFA area, the 
main concern focuses on dust associated with mining operations due to vehicles moving at 
the top of the Barroca Grande tailings deposit to load the coarse rejected materials from the 
mining exploration (Fig. 8.2).

The statistical parameters calculated from the “total” contents of the street dust samples are 
shown in Table 8.3. It was noticed that some elements have a strong positive asymmetry, due 
to the presence of “outliers”, namely, Ag, As, Au, Ca, Cd, Hg, Mo, Na, Pb, S, Sb, Se and Zn 
(with values above 1.5). Most of these elements present mean values signifi cantly higher than 
their median values. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize the most critical elements in 
contamination terms and as potential hazardous elements. For example, As ranging between

62 mg kg-1 and 3,565 mg kg-1; Cd from a minimum of 0.3 mg kg-1 and a maximum of 19.4 
mg kg-1 and Cu between 52 mg kg-1 and 766 mg kg-1, poses a severe danger for the village 
inhabitants affecting their health once these dust lay down in soils, vegetables and animals 
drinking water. 

Once again, it is useful to compare the dust contents with reference values and acceptable 
risk values. For a better understanding of the metals behavior in dust samples, this study only 
focuses on toxic elements Table 8.4 shows, according to Sezgin et al. (2003) the reference 
values range, acceptable risk values, and maximum acceptable values and, for comparison, 
the mean, median and maximum values determined in SFA street dust samples. 

Table 8.4. Reference values range (RVR), acceptable risk values (ARV), maximum acceptable values (MAV) (Sezgin 
et al., 2003) and mean, median and maximum values determined in SFA street dust samples (the

From Table 8.4, it is obvious that the collected dusts, clearly, exceed the reference values 
range, acceptable risk values as also the maximum acceptable values for, at least, As, Cd, Cu 
and Zn. For a better visualization, Fig. 8.3 shows the cartography of the As, Cd and Cu street 
dust contents according to the reference values presented in Table 8.4.

These high contents are caused by a great wind dispersion mechanism in this area (see Table 
2.3). According to these results it would be advisable the close monitoring of dust that are 
carried by the winds from the Barroca Grande tailing and implementing a form of mitigation 
to prevent its deposition in urban areas (in that case in SFA village). Indeed As, by its toxicity, 
may have chronic health effects that may be local or systemic. The lung cancer is regarded 
as the most critical effect that results from inhalation of particles of arsenic (WHO, 2000). 
Cadmium when present in the atmosphere and in food can cause severe kidney problems. 
Moreover the dispersion of Pb existing in dusts, if particles are at an inhaled size, e.g. PM

10 

and PM
2.5

, could be worrying, especially for children, primarily due to blood diseases which 
become frequent when humans are exposed to this element (WHO, 2000).

8.1.3. Waters

In SFA the local population strongly depends on the use water (water supply and agriculture), 
nevertheless most of the inhabitants use the public supply network. In the study area, it was 
chosen to perform the collection of water samples in private wells (UW4, UW6, UW7), another 
sample was collected in a little stream (Barroco; UW5), and for comparison two samples from 
public supply network (UW1, UW8). All of these waters are used for vegetables irrigation  by 
the local population (Table 8.5).

According to the results, the lowest pH values were recorded in samples collected in wells 
(UW4, UW6 and UW7) having a slightly acidic character, according to the parametric values 
set out in the Decree-Law 306/2007 with values between 6.5 and 9.0. The other samples have 
circumneutral pH. The measured values of electric conductivity ranging from 18 to 161 ?S 
cm-1 classifi es these waters with very low mineralization, according to the parametric values 
set out in the Decree-Law 306/2007 with values up to 2,500 ?S cm-1. These samples have 
lower SO

2- and Cl- concentrations but major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease 

of pH. Have also low metal concentrations, sometimes Zn and Mn were present in signifi cant 
concentrations though below the standard parametric values. The concentrations of other 
elements were all legally acceptable. 

Fig. 8.4 shows the samples representation in a Piper’s diagram. Two distinct hydrochemical 
facies were determined: (a) UW1, UW8 from public network supply, UW5 from Barroco stream 
and the well UW6 are Ca2+/Mg2+–HCO

wells have a closer facies to the type Ca2+/Mg2+–Cl-/SO

2- waters.  

Comparing the obtained results from the collected samples with the Portuguese criteria values 
of quality of surface fresh water for human consumption and irrigating waters (Portuguese 
Decree-Law 306/2007), all the analyzed waters in SFA village are in perfect conditions to be 
used by the population.

Nevertheless, and because As is a toxic element and once arsenopyrite is the main sulfi de 
rejected in Panasqueira mine, As and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation 
according to the methodologies described previously. According to the results of Table 8.6, it 
can be stated that As is present only in UW5 sample in the form of As(V), nevertheless below 
the parametric water values for human consumption according to the Portuguese Law. The 
toxicity of As depends on its oxidation state and knowing that its reduced forms are the most 
toxic, it was of extremely importance its determination because it allowed the verifi cation that 
the As in UW5, which is used for irrigation, is present in its oxidized form and hence with a 
lower degree of toxicity. The results also show that Fe(III) is dominant in all samples.

8.1.4. Vegetables

Many heavy metals exist in minute amounts in natural agricultural soil, however when their 
amounts exceed a certain level due to pollutants brought from outside, soil contamination 
occurs and agricultural products become contaminated so the consumption of locally 
produced vegetables may be an important exposure pathway for soil contaminants due to 
agricultural land use. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals can cause deleterious health effects 
in humans. Hence, prediction of metal and metalloid uptake by vegetables from contaminated 
soils is an important part of the Human health risk assessment. 

Given the high contents, of some metals/metalloids, that were recorded in the soils as well as in 
the street dusts and the fact that most inhabitants have a diet rich in vegetables, we attempted 
to study the relationship between the metals/metalloids contents of the rhizosphere soils 
and vegetables. Two species were analyzed, Solanum Tubersum Sava (potato) and Brassica

Olerácea L. (cabbage). For each sample it was calculated the total content of the elements 
according to equation (16, section 3.3), taking into consideration the different parts of each 
vegetable. Trace elements concentrations found in vegetables were summarized in Table 8.7. 
Analysis of the results shows that the concentration of some potential hazardous elements 
ranges from 1–14 mg kg-1 As; 0.1–0.1 mg kg-1 Cd; 4–20 mg kg-1 Cu; 21–270 mg kg-1 Mn, 
0.2–4.2 mg kg-1 Pb and 35–177 mg kg-1 Zn. Data also show that element uptake is different 
in both studied species, the highest concentrations of As, Pb, Zn and Mn accumulation were 
found in cabbages, while potatoes concentrate more Cd and Cu. 

Comparing the obtained results of the metal/metalloids contents in vegetables with the 
guidelines for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO (As = 0.1 mg kg-1; Cd = 0.1 mg kg-1; Cu = 
73 mg kg-1; Pb = 0.2 mg kg-1; Zn = 100 mg kg-1; Mn = 500 mg kg-1; www.codexalimentarius.
org) it is possible to say that As, Cd and Pb contents are above the maximum allowed level for 
vegetables while Cu, Zn and Mn contents are below the guidelines for maximum allowed metals 
in vegetables. On the whole, all vegetables that were studied in this study were contaminated 
by arsenic, cadmium and lead and they are toxic if continually consumed. Consumption of 
heavy metals-contaminated food can seriously deplete some essential nutrients in the body 
causing a decrease in immunological protection, intrauterine growth retardation, impaired 
psycho-social behavior, disabilities associated with malnutrition and a high prevalence of 
upper gastrointestinal cancer (Arora et al., 2008).

Tables 8.8 and 8.9 presents the concentrations distributed by the different components (T – 
tubercles, L – leaves, S – stems and R – Roots) of the two studied species Solanum Tubersum 
Sava and Brassica Olerácea L.

130 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach
Carla Candeias | 2013

The results obtained for the different component of the studied vegetable shows that: (a) for 
potatoes the roots contained maximum As (22 mg kg-1) followed by leaves (13 mg kg-1) and 
tubers (4 mg kg-1) (Table 8.8); (b) for cabbages the roots contained maximum As (52 mg kg-1) 
followed by leaves (3 mg kg-1) (Table 8.9). Despite the edible parts of vegetables, potatoes 
tubers and cabbage leaves have the lowest As contents, these contents are above the 
maximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO guidelines (0.1 mg kg-1; www.
codexalimentarius.org). As for Cd, the higher concentration in potatoes is found in roots (5 mg 
kg-1) and in tubers (0.5 mg kg-1) both above the FAO/WHO guidelines for Cd (0.1 mg kg-1; www.
codexalimentarius.org) and for leaves cabbages Cd have a maximum concentration of 0.4 mg 
kg-1 and for cabbages, the roots also have the highest Cd contents (0.6 mg kg-1), again both 
above the maximum limit considered by the FAO/WHO guidelines (www.codexalimentarius.
org). Due to the high contents of exchangeable Cd in vegetable soils, the Cd in the edible 
parts of vegetables probably came from the root uptake from soils.

Copper is below the maximum limit regarding the FAO/WHO guidelines (73 mg kg-1; www.
codexalimentarius.org) in all parts of the plant of both vegetables, and the same pattern is 
observed for Zn (max limit permissible 100 mg kg-1) in the potatoes but some cabbages 
have concentrations above the permissible limit. Nevertheless Cu reveals a preferential 
accumulation in the leaves and roots in the potatoes and Zn cumulates in the stems, and in 
cabbages Cu prefers to cumulate in roots and Zn also in the roots. 

Metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) are very tightly bound to the soil at high pH and are therefore 
more available at low pH levels than high pH levels. In addition to the effects of pH on nutrient 
availability, individual plants and soil organisms also vary in their tolerance to alkaline and/or 
acid soil conditions. Neutral conditions appear to be best for crop growth. As stated beforre 
in rhizosphere soils discussion, the pH of the sampled soils ranged 5.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.9 which is 
the considered pH range more favorable for micronutrients availability. 

According to equations (17) and (18; section 3.3), an index of the risk for residents, due to the 
ingestion of these metals/metalloids by consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area 
was calculated on the basis of the oral reference dose being 0.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 for As, 0.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 
for Cd, 40 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Cu, 3.5 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Pb, and 300 ?g kg?1 d?1 for Zn (Luo et al., 2011a;
JECFA, 1993).

According to Table 8.10 the risk index, in descending order is Cd &gt; As &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Zn. The 
risk index for Cd, As and Pb was higher than 1, while the risk index for Cu, and Zn was less 
than 1. The result indicates that the inhabitants of SFA village probably are exposed to some 
potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also Pb via consuming their vegetables. 
The accumulation of metals in the edible parts of vegetables could have a direct impact 
on the health of nearby inhabitants, because vegetables produced from gardens are mostly

consumed locally. For Cu and Zn, there is no signifi cant risk from the intake of vegetables. 
According to Luo et al. (2011a), when determining the risk index, it was assumed that the 
intake is equal to the absorbed dose (USEPA, 1989), which may magnify the effect of the 
ingested contaminants to some extent, because part of the heavy metals that were ingested 
maybe egested. From this point of view, it was reasonable that no obvious adverse health 
effects from exposure to the heavy metals could be observed on those living in the village. 

According to Luo et al. (2011a) and comparing the results with other studies (Table 8.11), the 
health risk for adults from consuming vegetables in this region is comparable to, or even 
higher than those associated with the consumption of vegetables from gardens impacted by 
mining, wastewater, irrigation or smelting activities.

For soil-plant system, heavy metal toxicity threshold is the highest permissible content in 
the soil (total or bioavailable concentration) that does not pose any phytotoxic effects or 
heavy metals in the edible parts of the crops does not exceed food hygiene standards (Islam 
et al., 2007). The factors that affect the thresholds of heavy metal toxicity in soil-vegetable 
system include the soil type (soil pH, organic matter content, clay mineral and other soil 
chemical and biochemical properties) and the vegetable species, the transport and heavy 
metal accumulation in each plant. Also the interactions between soils, the plant roots and 
microbes play an important role regarding the heavy metal movement from soil to the edible 
parts of crops (Islam et al., 2007). These are issues that can affect bioavailability and heavy 
metals accumulation in vegetables, subject for a further investigation.

Integration of environmental and biological monitoring in Panasqueira 
mine area, Portugal – the missing link

Abstract

In the absence of information of the health impacts of the environmental and occupational exposure to 

mine contamination, a population-based study was conducted, with the objective/aim of characterizing 

the state of health of the communities affected, in particular the potential geno- and immunotoxic risk of 

that environment.

In order to establish a direct link between the external contamination and the internal dose information 

the environmental and biological monitoring data were integrated. Rhizosphere soils, waters and street 

dusts were analyzed in order to establish the toxic elements concentrations in an environmental exposed 

area and in background area. Internal dose biomarkers included total concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, 

Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn in blood, urine, nail and hair samples from exposed and control individuals. 

Arsenic speciation analyses in urine samples were also performed.

Results from environmental analysis show a high degree of contamination by metals and metalloids 

with the main elements being Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn. Human health risk assessment confi rm 

these results and point to ingestion of As through street dust as a major problem. These conclusions 

were refl ected, to some extent, in the biological analysis where signifi cant results for several elements 

in different matrices, namely total amounts of As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn, were obtained. Arsenic 

presented signifi cant differences in all matrices except hair samples, with speciation analysis in urine 

also showing signifi cant results for all species except AsB.

Together our results show unequivocally a high degree of contamination by metals and metalloids in 

Panasqueira mine area which is revealed in internal dose biomarkers form exposed individuals. They 

confi rm results obtained in previous environmental and biological campaigns carried in this area 

strengthening the need for an urgent intervention of competent authorities in order to decrease the risk 

of exposed populations.

9. Paper VI

9.1. Results and discussion

The results obtained in previous environmental studies performed in the surroundings of the 
Panasqueira mine reported a high degree of contamination by several metal(loid)s (e-Ecorisk, 
2007; Ávila et al., 2008a,b; Grangeia et al., 2011; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013).

The environmental analysis of the topsoil and 15 cm depth soils (subsurface), on a 32 km2 
area surrounding the Panasqueira mine (see Paper III in section 6), identifi ed an assemblage 
of potentially toxic elements (Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn). The potential ecological risk 
index classifi ed 92.6% of topsoil samples with high to very high ecological risk (see Paper 
IV in section 7) These fi ndings were accompanied by biomonitoring studies which found 
higher concentrations of metal(loid)s, specifi cally As, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn in the blood, 
urine, nails and hair of individuals living near or working in the mine (Coelho et al., 2013a, in 
section 12.5, Paper VIII). Additionally results also showed an increase in genotoxic damage and 
immunotoxic effects in these populations (Coelho et al., 2011b, 2012, 2013b).

The present study aims to establish the missing link between the environmental contamination 
by metal(loid)s and the internal dose in the Panasqueira region. For this purpose several 
environmental media and biomarkers of internal dose were analyzed, including topsoil, 
subsurface soil, rhizosphere soil, vegetables, street dusts and superfi cial and irrigation water 
samples, linked to the quantifi cation of several metal(loid)s in blood, urine, nail and hair 
samples. The conjugation of both studies defi ned the elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, 
Pb and Zn as the target of this work.

Most metal(loid)s are very toxic to living organisms and even those considered as essential can 
be toxic when in excess. They can disturb important biochemical processes, constituting an 
important threat for the human health. Major health effects include development retardation, 
endocrine disruption, kidney damage, immunological and neurologic effects, and several 
types of cancer (Mudgal et al., 2010). Certain metal(loid)s are known to induce genotoxicity, 
and are known to originate cancer in a variety of animal species. Based on epidemiological 
data, metal(loid)s like As, Cd. Cr and Ni were classifi ed by IARC as human carcinogens (http://
monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classifi cation/Classifi cationsGroupOrder.pdf).

9.1.1. Environmental monitoring

The environmental studies revealed high As concentrations in rhizosphere soil, topsoil and 
street dusts, both in control and environmental exposure areas (Table 9.1). 

Exposed rhizosphere soil and topsoil present mean concentrations, respectively, 13x and 
9x higher than the Ontario soils quality guidelines (11 mg kg-1; Ministry of the Environment, 
2011). Additionally street dusts showed mean values 29x higher than the acceptable risk 
value (20 mg kg-1) proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). The street dust sample 
collected on the S. Francisco de Assis village main road, located near Barroca Grande tailing, 
presented the maximum concentration of As (3,565 mg kg-1), being 178x higher than the 
acceptable risk. Arsenic concentrations in the study areas are explained once the main mineral 
existing in the Panasqueira deposit is arsenopyrite (FeAsS). Also exist on other minerals 
identifi ed in this area, such as arseniosiderite (Ca

Rhizosphere soil samples reveal mean Cd concentrations slightly below the Ontario soils 
quality guidelines (0.9 mg kg-1; Ministry of the Environment, 2011; Table 9.1). Nevertheless, 
the maximum concentration on agricultural soils is over 3 times the guide value. This value 
might pose a threat to humans once absorbed Cd is excreted very slowly, accumulating 
on the human body. Street dust samples revealed a mean concentration of 4 mg kg-1. The 
maximum value was of 19 mg kg-1, 6x higher than the maximum acceptable value (3 mg 
kg-1) proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). According the WHO (http://www.who.int/, 
2013) Cd exerts toxic effects on the kidney, the skeletal and the respiratory systems, and is 
classifi ed as a human carcinogen, being inhalation on of the main exposure routes.

Another metal existing in high concentrations in street dusts is Cu. The existence of Cu in 
the study area is mainly due to the presence of chalcopyrite (CuFeS

2
; one of the by-products 

of the Panasqueira mine), chalcocite (Cu

) minerals on the Panasqueira mine surrounding area. The Cu mean contents 
in street dusts of environmentally exposed areas is over 5x higher than the acceptable risk 
value proposed by Fabis (1987; Sezgin et al., 2003). Also in rhizosphere soil samples the 
mean concentrations (Table 9.1) exceeds the recommended by the Ministry of the Environment 
(2011). Although low levels of copper are essential for humans, high absorption of Cu can be 
toxic to humans causing, among others, diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and even death 
(http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/, 2013).

Zinc occurs in the Panasqueira mining area mainly due to the existence of sphalerite (zinc 
sulfi de; (Zn,Fe)S; ~67% Zn) and smithsonite (zinc carbonate; ZnCO

3
; ~52% Zn) minerals. 

Once this metal does not occurs freely in the environment it is considered that one of the 
main anthropogenic sources is mining activities (ATSDR, 2005c). Zinc mean concentrations in 
street dusts samples, in the environmentally exposed area, are higher than the acceptable risk 
values. Rhizosphere soils and topsoil do not reveal mean concentrations above the Canadian 
guidelines (Table 9.1). Although zinc is essential to humans, high doses can cause clinical 
symptoms of gastrointestinal distress (http://www.epa.gov/, 2013).

For Mn, like Fe an abundant element in soils, there is no limit on their concentrations. Sezgin 
et al. (2003) determined mean Mn concentrations of 398 mg kg-1 in street dusts, a value 
similar to the ones of this study on control area (397 mg kg-1) and lower than the environmental 
exposed area (469 mg kg-1; Table 9.1). 

Both non-carcinogenic hazard (HQ
child

) and carcinogenic risk (Risk) of the environmentally 
exposed area, through the different pathways (ingestion, dermal and inhalation), were estimated 
according to the human health risk assessment model (USDoE, 2013). The cumulative hazard 
index (HI

child
) and total risk (RISK) were also characterized for multi-pathway routes for resident 

population. Results are presented in Table 9.2.

138 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach
Carla Candeias | 2013

For the non-carcinogenic effects it was studied the most conservative exposure condition 
– children (1-6 years old). The street dusts of the elements selected in this study (Cd, Cr, 
Cu, Pb, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn), apart from As, do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard for 
children in Panasqueira area (maximum HI

child-Ag,Cd,Cu,W,Zn
 ? 8.55E-01 &amp;lt;1.00E+00). Arsenic 

concentrations present in the street dust samples show a non-carcinogenic risk of 2.72E+01 
? HI

child
 (2.75E+01), being ingestion the most signifi cant route of exposure (Table 9.2).

The street dusts carcinogenic risk adjusted both to children and adult was also computed 
for the selected elements (Table 9.2). Also arsenic and ingestion pathway are more signifi cant 
in this analysis. The estimated mean risk of the environmentally exposed area is 1.51E-03. 
This value represents a probability of 2 out of 1,000 persons might develop cancer. Both S. 
Francisco de Assis and Barroca, the environmentally exposed villages selected for this study, 
are located downstream Barroca Grande tailing and next to Rio tailing, respectively (Fig. 9.1) 
what induces this high concentrations of toxic elements in the street dusts.

Fig. 9.1. (a) S. Francisco de Assis village downstream Barroca Grande tailing (7,000,000 m3; active) – the dark 
gray on the top of the tailing are recent depositions of slag materials; and (b) Barroca village, next to Rio 
tailing (1,200,000 m3; abandoned).

The waters risk for the environmentally exposed populations was also estimated. The collected 
waters where selected by inhabitants use on a daily base. The two public tap water samples 
collected in S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca villages showed a reasonable carcinogenic risk 
(4.49E-05 and 1.179E-05, respectively) for As, mostly by ingestion once inhalation and dermal 
risk are absent (&lt;1.00E-07). Although these waters As concentration are below the limits of 
the Portuguese standards (&lt;10 ug L-1; Decrew-Law 306/2007), the USDoE (2013) standards 
consider these waters as above the carcinogenic target risk (1.00E-06). The well water 
samples from both villages ranged from 3.36E-05 to 1.75E-04. The questionnaire performed 
allowed to establish that this last water sample is used for irrigation and also for a small pool 
where children swims seasonally. The street dust sample carcinogenic risk associated with 
this water is of 1.56E-03, representing a probability of ~2 out of 1,000 persons might develop 
cancer by ingested/inhaled particles, due to the high As concentration. Also local spring waters 
were analyzed and presented a carcinogenic risk of 8.30E-05 to 2.02E-05. The streams and 
Zêzere river samples collected are used for vegetables irrigation and occasionally for swim 
by local younger inhabitants: (a) Barroco stream samples in S. Francisco de Assis village; 
and (b) Zêzere river samples in Barroca village. These water samples ranged from 1.30E-04 
to 4.06E-04, being the maximum carcinogenic risk in one Zêzere river sample (i.e. sample 
B11 with 18 ?g L-1 As; Fig. 3.6), corresponding to a 2.19E-04 street dust carcinogenic risk
(84.9 mg kg-1 As).

Results of metal(loid) quantifi cation showed signifi cant differences among groups, for several 
elements, in different matrices (Table 9.3). Some of the elements – As, Cd, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, 
and Pb – presented higher values in exposed groups in all the matrices when compared to 
controls. Among all the elements analyzed As showed signifi cantly different values in three 
different matrices; Cu, Mn and Zn in two; Cd, Mo and Ni in one. No signifi cant differences 
were observed for Cr and Pb.

Carla Candeias | 2013

Results of As quantifi cation showed signifi cant differences in all matrices, except in hair (Table 
9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Results 
obtained for the urine samples are higher than the published reference ranges and within the 
ranges for the rest of the matrices. Arsenic showed strong correlations between matrices 
compatible with the presence of recent (blood and urine) and past (nails and hair) exposure. 
This is in agreement with the results obtained for the environmental samples, where As plays 
a central role in the existent contamination.

Regarding As speciation analysis (Table 9.4) obtained results show that all the species have 
signifi cantly higher concentrations in the exposed group when compared to controls, except 
for arsenobetaine (AsB).

In a toxicological perspective, the speciation of arsenic in urine plays a crucial role in 
understanding the effects of this element on human health. The toxicity of As in humans is 
dependent on its chemical form with both arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] being the most 
toxic, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA) are less toxic, and 
arsenobetaine (AsB), which is mainly found in seafood, being considered non-toxic (Brima et 
al., 2006). There is strong evidence that chronic exposure to inorganic As (iAs) is related with 
several adverse health effects such as skin lesions, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic 
disorders (Fillol et al., 2010). Recently, the existence of more toxic species in urine – DMA(III) 
and MMA(III) – has been suggested by several publications but the existence of such species 
it was also been questioned (Morton and Leese, 2011).

Our results (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) show as previously mentioned all the species having signifi cantly 
higher concentrations in the exposed group (except for AsB) and agree with the results obtained 
for the other matrices (blood, nails and hair). This points to populations being exposed to high 
quantities of iAs which is related to the mining activities in the Panasqueira mine. They also 
agree with the results previously published (Coelho et al., 2011b, 2012, 2013a). Results show 
higher concentrations of all species when compared to results obtained in other studies for 
populations exposed and unexposed to As (Brima et al., 2006; Fillol et al., 2010; Heitland and 
Köster, 2009; Morton and Leese, 2011).

Regarding the effect of gender, our results show that females have higher mean concentrations 
of As

 and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB while males presents highest values in values As(V). 

Berglund et al. (2011) reported that females seemed to be more at risk for toxic metal exposure 
than males, and this founding was confi rmed in our study, where females had signifi cantly 
higher levels of As. Concerning the effect of age, we found older individuals having higher

 and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB concentrations in urine and younger individuals having 
higher As(V) concentrations These differences, besides different patterns of exposure, may 
be due to different toxicokinetic rates, possibly because of the lower proportion of water in 
the organism, lower absorption and excretion rates, and possible nutritional defi ciencies, and 
comorbidities in older individuals.

Finally, the analysis of the effect of smoking showed as smokers have signifi cantly higher 
concentration of As(V) when compared to As

total
 and As(III), DMA, MMA and AsB concentrations.

Fig. 9.3. Urinary AsB, DMA and MMA concentration distribution according to gender, age, smoking habits, fi sh 
consumption, water consumption and agriculture practice, including pesticide usage, for both control 
and environmental groups.

The concentration of urinary As species mainly refl ects recent exposure (some hours to few 
days). In the body inorganic As undergoes enzymatic methylation to MMA(V) and DMA(V), 
which is mainly excreted in urine together with As(III) and As(V) (Heitland and Köster, 2009).

Results of Cd quantifi cation showed signifi cant differences only in hair samples (Table 9.3) with 
the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Results obtained for 
blood samples are higher than the published reference ranges and within the ranges for the

rest of the matrices. This do not show a clear difference in populations exposure to Cd which 
is in agreement with the results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results obtained 
for the environmental samples which show similar levels of Cd in samples from both areas – 
exposed and control.

Regarding of Cu quantifi cation results showed signifi cant differences in blood and toenail 
samples (Table 9.3) with controls presenting higher values when compared to the exposed group. 
Results obtained for the all matrices are within the published reference ranges. This point to 
controls being exposed to high levels of Cu which is in agreement with the results obtained 
in Coelho et al. (2013a) but not on agreement with the results obtained for the environmental 
samples. Nevertheless, one can hypothesize if the fact that exposed populations are exposed 
to high levels of Zn does not interfere with the levels of Cu, as it is widely known that the 
absorption of high levels of Zn suppresses the absorption of Cu and Fe (Fosmire, 1990).

Results of Zn quantifi cation showed signifi cant differences in blood and hair samples (Table 
9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Results 
obtained for blood samples are extremely higher than the published reference ranges, 
fi ngernail samples are slightly higher and the rest of the matrices are within the ranges. This 
point to populations having a continuous exposure to Zn which is in agreement with the 
results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results obtained for the environmental 
samples.

Concerning Cr and Pb quantifi cation results did not show signifi cant differences (Table 9.3) 
between the two groups. Results obtained for Pb in urine samples are higher than the published 
reference ranges and the rest of the matrices for both elements are within the ranges. This 
point to populations not having a clear exposure to Cr and Pb which is in agreement with the 
results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results obtained for the environmental 
samples which show similar levels of these elements in samples from both areas – exposed 
and control.

Results of Mn quantifi cation shows signifi cant differences in blood and toenail samples (Table 
9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. Levels of 
Mn in urine and blood present higher values than the published reference ranges and the 
rest of the matrices are within the ranges. Although Mn is an essential nutrient to humans, 
exposure to high levels of manganese might affect the nervous system (http://www.atsdr.cdc.
gov/, 2013). These results point to populations having a continuous exposure to Mn which 
is not in agreement with the results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a) and with the results 
obtained for the environmental samples which show similar levels of this element in samples 
from both areas – exposed and control.

Results of Mo and Ni quantifi cation show signifi cant differences in blood and hair samples 
(Table 9.3) with the exposed group presenting higher values when compared to controls. 
Results obtained for both elements in blood samples are higher than the published reference 
ranges and the rest of the matrices for elements are within the ranges. These results point 
to populations having a recent exposure to Mo and a not clear exposure to Ni which is in 
agreement with the results obtained in Coelho et al. (2013a). The former is not in agreement 
with the results obtained for the environmental samples which show similar levels of Mo in 
samples from both areas – exposed and control.

10. Conclusions

The mining and benefi ciation processes at Panasqueira mine generates huge quantities of 
arsenic-rich mine wastes responsible for the high levels of metals at the Barroca Grande 
and Rio tailings. Tailings and open air impoundments are the main source of pollution in the 
surrounding area due to the sulfi des oxidation that enhances the mobilization and migration of 
trace metals from the mining wastes into the environment, namely waters, stream sediments, 
soils, vegetables and street dusts. 

A fi rst environmental study performed under the scope of the e-Ecorisk project, allowed a 
fi rst characterization the Zêzere river hidrogeochemistry. The upstream Zêzere river water 
samples (background) are classifi ed as Na-bicarbonate waters; the Casinhas stream and 
seepage waters are considered as Ca2++Mg2+/SO

4
2- type, and the downstream Zêzere river 

waters are classifi ed as mixed Mg2+ and Ca2+ bicarbonate/sulfate waters; being this last two 
associations under the infl uence of the mining activities.

The rainy season water samples are divided into three main groups. The fi rst group gathers 
the seepage and Zêzere river waters (this last sample collected on the base of Rio tailing 
with signifi cant seepage discharge as a consequence of the heavy rainfall), with low pH and 
high electrical conductivity; a second group comprises Casinhas stream and a water sample 
of the confl uence of Casinhas stream and Zêzere river, with higher pH and lower electrical 
conductivity values than the fi rst group; a last group is defi ned with the Barroco stream 
samples, with near neutral pH values and low electrical conductivity. These different types 
of water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The sulfate ion show high positive 
correlations with most metal(loid)s and the positive correlation with Ca possibly, refl ects the 
infl uence of gypsum and calcite dissolution plus sulfi de oxidation. 

In the dry season the pH is slightly higher, while SO
4
2- and metals concentration are lower, 

when compared with rainy period results. These results are due to the fact that rainy season 
samples were collected immediately after a rainstorm and consequently the dissolution of the 
easily soluble sulfate minerals. During the dry season, sulfate effl orescences characteristic 
of acidic environment precipitate as complex mixtures of Fe-Al hydrated sulfates such as 
melanterite and minor amounts of rozenite and szomolnokite. The most contaminated waters 
are in or close to the mine tailings (Rio and Barroca Grande), where the metal dispersion 
and acidity generation is clearer. The pH and Eh relationship is crucial in As immobilization/
stabilization on solid phases. At Barroca Grande, the waters neutralization with lime promotes 
metal precipitation, with Fe oxyhydroxides and to clay adsorption, whit pH increases. When 
promoted by lime the pH increase and Eh values are located in the As mobilization zone, 
the element mobility enhance signifi cantly near the Salgueira WTP. Barroco stream waters 
are used for irrigation. Arsenic concentrations in the rainy period are below the parametric 
water values for human consumption, according to the Portuguese law, but in the dry season 
the results presents higher As concentration, exceeding the permitted values defi ned in the 
Portuguese legislation. Nevertheless, As is present in its oxidized form (H

2
AsO

4
- and HAsO

2-) 

and hence with a lower degree of toxicity.

The computed saturation index disclosed that Fe-oxides, Fe/Al-hydroxides, aluminosilicates 
and Al-hydrosulfates are the main mineral groups in which waters tend to become more 
supersaturated. These phases are very important since they show a high metal(loid)s adsorption 
capacity. Aqueous concentrations may be attenuated by goethite, gibbsite and/or ferrihydrite 



148 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach

precipitation in the oxidation zone through adsorption processes. Geochemical calculations 
suggest that the waters are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and calcite being Ca2+ 
and SO

4
2- in solution. The source of SiO

2
, Ca2+ and metals/metalloids, could be attributed to 

the silicate weathering, calcite dissolution and sulfi de-mineral oxidation. The seepage waters 
show higher capacity for mineral dissolution than Casinhas and Barroco streams samples 
that shows predisposition for mineral precipitation. The divalent (Cd2+ and Mn2+) and sulfate 
species (CdSO

4
0 and MnSO

4
0) are the dominant phases of Cd and Mn in these waters which 

(Barroco stream) are used for agriculture irrigation and for human consumption representing 
a risk to humans with a signifi cant carcinogenic risk especially due to the As concentrations. 

Although the concentrations of the water samples were not extremely high, the stream 
sediments show high concentrations exceeding the toxicity limits. The mechanical and 
chemical dispersion, due to the dynamic of the stream and river surface waters, favors the 
mobilization and the incorporation of metals/metaloids in stream sediments. The irregular 
decay of these anomalous patterns suggests the interference of local hydrological and a 
geomorphologically rugged region which promote mechanisms of fast erosion, transport 
and accumulation of solid materials, most of which are transported in suspension by surface 
waters. Elements like As, W and Fe showed high ratio values calculated between the amounts 
of metals in sediments and in waters. These three elements are the most expressive elements 
related to the ore deposit and their high amounts in sediments prove that they are being 
mobilized out from the tailings impoundments to the water courses. The near-neutral pH 
values of these waters favor the precipitation/adsorption of these metals in sediments.

Once oxidation of the tailing sulfi des may give rise to the mobilization and migration of trace 
metals from the mining wastes into the soils, this sample media was selected and collected 
at two depths – superfi cial (topsoil) and 15 cm depth soil (subsurface), allowing distinguishing 
different sources of contamination, i.e., anthropogenic contamination and natural or geogenic 
contamination. The geochemical background was also determined with the collection of soil 
samples in Casegas area. Topsoil was classifi ed globally has very acid to acid, being the areas 
with the lowest pH soil values related with the highest SOM percentages. The topsoil PCA 
results allowed the identifi cation of the Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn association (potentially 
toxic elements – PTEs), what puts in evidence the infl uence of the rich mine wastes, stored 
in Barroca Grande and Rio tailings and in the open air impoundments. The mechanical 
dispersion due to the wind of the hydrated metal sulfates stored in the Barroca Grande and 
Rio open-air impoundments (that evaporate during warm periods) together with hydrological 
factors, favoring the elements transport and its chemical dispersion contaminating the local 
soils with As and sulfi de-related heavy metals (such as Cu and Cd). The precipitation of soluble 
secondary minerals, temporally retain metals/metalloids in their lattice during warm and dry 
periods, but such minerals are easily dissolved in rainy periods.

Very strong correlations were found between the PTE’s and between PTE’s and pH, being 
strongest in the Ag/Cu, As/Ag and Bi/W correlations. The PTE’s and pH positive correlation, 
confi rms that heavy metal mobility holds a positive association with pH, affecting their 
availability. The ANOVA analysis, displayed signifi cant variations with depth and the majority 
of the PTE’s (Ag, As, Bi, Cd and W) and pH presents a signifi cant variation for Ag, W and 
Zn. Selective chemical extraction demonstrate that the most pollutant fraction in these soil 
consists of metals bounded to sulfi des, but also to amorphous or poorly crystalline iron oxide 
geochemical phases. Nevertheless, As, Cd, Cu, and Zn are also linked to the exchangeable

and acid-soluble bearing-phases, upon which desorption and ion exchange reactions may 
originate the release of these readily mobile phases. 

The estimated pollution load index (PLI) established a local soil quality classifi cation trough 
100% of samples with a moderate to a high degree of contamination. The PLI spatial 
distribution showed that soils are potential toxic elements (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Bi) enriched, 
when compared with local background soils, exceeding, for example, for As 20x the Ontario 
reference value for agricultural soils (11 mg kg-1). 

According to the calculated contamination factor and the modifi ed degree of contamination 
(mC

d
), 92.6% of the soil samples registered moderate to ultra-high degree of pollution. The 

spatial distribution of the mC
d
 reveal areas with a very high degree of contamination, being the 

highest values identifi ed near Barroca Grande, São Francisco de Assis and Rio, confi rming 
the mechanical and chemical dispersion from tailings. 

The estimated potential ecological risk (PERI) classifi es both soil depths with a very high risk. 
In the PERI spatial distribution, topsoil has a wide area classifi ed with a very high ecological 
risk, consistent with wind direction, water courses and actual and previous exploration and 
benefi ciation locations.

The non-carcinogenic hazard effects determined for children (1-6 years old) indicated that 
Ag, Cd, Cu, W and Zn elements do not present a non-carcinogenic hazard in children, while 
for As there is a high risk for non-cancer health effects in children in the villages under the 
infl uence of the Panasqueira mining activities. The carcinogenic risk for both children and 
adult, revealed a very high cancer risk due to As ingestion which may cause several human 
organs cancer through ingestion, and lung and skin cancer through inhalation.

Considering the previous fi ndings is possible to conclude that local populations are probably 
exposed to some potential health risks through dusts inhalation and by waters, soils and 
vegetables ingestion. The metal assemblage identifi ed in the rhizosphere soils collected 
in S. Francisco de Assis village, downstream Barroca Grande tailings deposit, may refl ect 
the infl uence of the tailings and open air impoundments materials, associated with several 
dispersion agents, including wind, leading to deposition in soils, vegetables and superfi cial 
waters. These soils exceed, for example, for As 20x the Ontario reference value for agricultural 
soils (11 mg kg-1) and the estimated values for enrichment index (EI) are high, ranging (1.0 
&amp;lt;EI &amp;lt;12.2) mainly due to the presence of As, Cu and also Cd and Pb. The high levels of 
As in these soils seems to be linked to sulfi des, refl ecting the presence of arsenopyrite in 
soils. The comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that these soils are considered as 
‘‘grossly polluted’’. Also the street dusts collected exceed the reference acceptable risk and 
the maximum acceptable values for As, Cd, Cu and Zn. These contents results from a wind 
dispersion mechanism, with great expression in this area. If particles are at an inhaled size, 
e.g. PM

10
 and PM

2.5
, might be very worrying. Regarding the sampled irrigation waters, some 

have slightly acidic character and others have circumneutral pH, with very low mineralization 
(electric conductivity range from 18 to 161 ?S cm-1) and low SO

4
2- and Cl- concentrations, 

however major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease of pH. Metal and metalloid 
concentrations are also low and, according the Portuguese law, legally acceptable. 

The S. Francisco de Assis vegetables were also contaminated. In one way, for potatoes there 
is a preferential accumulation in the roots and leaves while for the cabbage most elements 
have a preferential accumulation in the roots. Nevertheless As, Cd and Pb concentrations 



150 Modelling the impact of Panasqueira mine in the ecosystems and human health: a multidisciplinary approach

are above the maximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO (www.
codexalimentarius.org), which could be a potential health concern to local residents. The risk 
index for residents determined, due to the ingestion of the metals and metalloids, reveal that 
Cd, As and Pb represents an hazard for the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village, once 
they are probably exposed to some potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and 
also Pb trough the ingesting these metals, by consuming vegetables grown in their yards.

The multidisciplinary approach (environmental and biological) conducted in the environmentally 
exposed villages (S. Francisco de Assis and Barroca) and in control areas (Unhais-o-Velho 
and Casegas) established unequivocally the link between environmental contamination by 
several metal(loid)s and the signifi cant increase in concentrations found for internal dose 
biomarkers from exposed populations when compared to controls. Results of local soils, 
waters and street dusts samples shows that these different media contain high concentrations 
of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and/or Zn when compared with local geochemical background values. 
Results obtained in biomarkers of exposure agree with the environmental studies results, 
pointing to populations living nearby the mine being exposed to metal(loid)s promoted by the 
mining activities. Arsenic was the element with the highest increase in exposed populations. 
Concentration values also indicate populations being recently exposed to As, organic and 
inorganic forms. Results obtained in the other matrices allowed recognizing that the exposure 
is continuous. The concentration of other elements such as Cd, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn 
also increased, although at a lesser extent.

This research highlights the need for competent authorities to get involved in the areas 
identifi ed as highly polluted. Priority should be given to areas where samples are classifi ed 
as requiring reclamation, when they are geographically located in agricultural or urban areas. 
Appropriate environmental laws with adequate monitoring enforcement need to be adopted 
to prevent most of the damage caused in mine surrounding communities. All these measures 
will help to a better protection of the health and safety of workers and inhabitants near and 
those otherwise impacted by historic, current and proposed mines.

10.1. Further studies

Further studies should be performed in order to:

• determine the PM
2.5

 and PM
10

 and also the PTE’s concentrations existing in the
street dusts;

• estimate the metal bioaccessibility in human receptors;

• establish the metals transfer process from soil to the different parts of the plants, understand 
their bioavailability and identify the bioaccumulation patterns based in indicators as 
Biological Absorption Coeffi cient for each element;

• deeper and long-term evaluation of the mining impacts on workers and communities 
health.

This thesis subsection intends to be a small review of the PTE (Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, W and Zn) 
identifi ed in the superfi cial soil samples of the Panasqueira mine.

Arsenic

Arsenic (As; CAS 7440-38-2) is a ubiquitous metalloid occurring naturally in over 245 different 
mineral forms of which approximately 60% are arsenates, 20% sulfi des and sulfosalts and 
the remaining 20% includes arsenides, arsenites, oxides, silicates and elemental arsenic, 
being arsenopyrite the most common As mineral (USEPA, 2000; WHO, 2001a; Sharma and 
Sohn, 2009). This element is classifi ed as a group 1 (carcinogenic to humans; IARC http://
monographs.iarc.fr/, 2013).

Although the ultimate source of arsenic is geological, human activities such as mining, burning 
of fossil fuels, and pesticide applications contaminate both soils and groundwater’s, especially 
under anoxic conditions (Nriagu and Azcue, 1990; Bissen and Frimmel, 2003).  Arsenic is 
widely distributed in the environment, mainly in soil and water, and also in some foods such 
as rice, vegetables, fi sh, shellfi sh, and milk (Beni et al. 2008; Ötles and Çagindi, 2010).

In the environment and in the diet, As can be found in both organic and inorganic forms 
(Ötles and Çagindi, 2010). Methylation of inorganic As is the major metabolism pathway. In 
humans, arsenate (As(V)) is fi rst reduced to arsenite (As(III)), which is itself methylated into 
methylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids (MMA and DMA), most of which is then excreted 
via the renal pathway (Ötles and Çagindi, 2010). Excretion via feces, nails, and hair is minor 
(ATSDR, 2007). Public health organizations consider inorganic As(III), and to a lesser extent 
As(V), to be the most dangerous forms, and the methylated forms to be less harmful (Ötles 
and Çagindi, 2010).

The acute toxicity of arsenic is related to its chemical form and oxidation state (Hughes, 2002). 
Table 12.1 presents the median lethal dose (LD

50
) of several arsenicals in laboratorial animals.

Exposure to arsenic trioxide by ingestion of 70–80 mg has been reported to be fatal for humans 
(Vallee et al., 1960). In adult humans the lethal range of inorganic arsenic is estimated at of 1–3 
mg kg-1 (Ellenhorn, 1997). Recently, median lethal concentration (LC

) values were estimated

as 571, 843, 5.49, and 2.16 ?M for As(V), DMAV, As(III), and DMAIII, respectively, for human cells 
(Naranmandura et al., 2007). This study also showed that dimethylmonothioarsenic (DMMTAV) 
is much more toxic than other pentavelent nonthiolated arsenicals (Naranmandura et al., 
2007). The characteristics of severe acute arsenic toxicity in humans include gastrointestinal 
discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody urine, anuria, shock, convulsions, coma, and death 
(Hughes, 2002).

The earliest reports of As impacts on human health date back to the latter part of the 19th 
century (1887) in Hutchinson’s, when the onset of skin effects (including pigmentation changes, 
hyperkerotosis and skin cancers) were linked to the consumption of arsenic in medicines and 
drinking water (WHO, 2001a). Also individuals exposed to arsenic through medical treatment 
with Fowler’s solution (potassium arsenite), via inhalation at copper smelters (occupational 
exposure) and/or naturally contaminated drinking water developed cancer (Fierz, 1965; 
Lee-Feldstein, 1983,1986; Cebrian et al., 1983; Hughes, 2002). 

In general, there are four recognized stages of arsenicosis (Romero-Schmidt et al. 2001; 
Ötles and Çagindi, 2010): (a) Preclinical The patient shows no symptoms, but arsenic can 
be detected in urine or body tissue samples; (b) Clinical various effects can be observed 
in the skin, being melanosis the most common symptom often observed on the palms, but 
also iskeratosis, a more serious symptom with the hardening of skin into nodules, often on 
palms and soles; (c) Complications clinical symptoms become more pronounced and internal 
organs are affected, such as enlargement of the liver, kidneys, and spleen have been reported; 
and (d) Malignancy Tumors or cancers (carcinoma) affecting skin or other organs, like lung 
or bladder. Tumors due to As inhalation are registered primarily in lungs, whereas by oral 
exposure are initially observed in the skin (Lee-Feldstein, 1983,1986; Cebrian et al., 1983). 
After As entering the body it is distributed through several organs, including the lungs, liver, 
kidney, and skin (Ötles and Çagindi, 2010). Table 12.2 lists type of effects observed in humans 
after chronic exposure to As.

Bismuth

Bismuth (Bi, CAS 7440-69-9) is a naturally occurring metal used to manufacture e.g. solder, 
fi shing anchors and shotgun pellets. Some cosmetics and medications also have bismuth 
in different forms. Recent studies recognize this element as toxic (not a carcinogen). 
Overexposure to bismuth can lead to the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva, known 
as a bismuth line.

Bismuth can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. The most common exposure 
to bismuth is occupational. The consumption of medications and/or cosmetics is also an 



17112. Appendixes

exposure route. Some studies suggests bismuth as substitute in lead ammunition, but a 
bioavailability study of bismuth showed that, like lead, bismuth can be measured in the urine 
and blood of animals (Urgast et al., 2012).

Exposure to Bi might induces nausea, headache, diarrhea, and pain. According to Braun et 
al. (2009), anemia might be promoted by exposure to Bi. This element as also been studied 
as a sperm metabolism redutor (Ghaffari et al., 2011), being Bi nanoparticles considered more 
toxic than the other bismuth compounds (Luo et al., 2012b).    

Cadmium

Cadmium (Cd; CAS 7440-43-9) is a toxic transition metal, widely spread in the biosphere 
in spite of restrictions for its use (Hellström et al., 2007). Cadmium was fi rst discovered in 
1817, as an impurity in zinc carbonate and has been recognized as an occupational health 
hazard for many decades (Järup and Åkesson, 2009). This element is classifi ed as a group 1 
(carcinogenic to humans; IARC http://monographs.iarc.fr/, 2013).

The risks of environmentally exposed populations to Cd were emphasized with the discovery 
of the infamous Itai-itai disease (softening of the bones and kidney failure) induced by intake 
of cadmium-polluted rice (Hagino and Kono, 1955). Agricultural uses of phosphate fertilizers 
and sewage sludge and industrial uses of cadmium have been identifi ed as a major cause of 
widespread dispersion of the metal at trace levels into the general environment and human 
food. Other causes of cadmium dispersion are enhanced natural emission and bioaccumulation 
taking place in certain plants, mammals and fi lter feeder organisms including crustaceans 
and mollusks (Satarug et al., 2003). During the last decade an increasing number of studies 
have found adverse health effects at much lower levels than in the earlier studies (Järup and 
Åkesson, 2009; ATSDR, 1999a).

Food is the most important source of Cd exposure in the general non-smoking population 
(WHO, 1992, 2001).Cadmium is present in virtually all food, but the concentrations vary 
to a great extent, depending on the type of food and the Cd load in the food production 
environment (Olsson et al., 2002). Natural occurrence of Cd in bedrock and soils as well 
as anthropogenic sources of Cd, such as industrial emissions and the application of soil 
amendments (e.g. lime, phosphorous-fertilisers and sewage sludge) to farm land, may lead to 
contamination of soil by Cd and increased uptake by cereal crops, vegetables and root crops 
(McLaughlin and Singh, 1999). Cadmium in soils is known to be more mobile and readily 
absorbed and incorporated into plant tissues compared with lead and mercury (Singh and 
McLaughlin, 1999). The uptake of soil Cd by plants is enhanced by a low pH (WHO, 1992; 
Erikson et al., 1996; Grant et al., 1999). In particular, the Cd concentration in potatoes and 
carrots has been shown susceptible to changes in soil pH during Swedish fi eld conditions 
(Öborn et al., 1995), while salinity, i.e. Cl concentration, is the major factor infl uencing potato 
tuber Cd concentration in other climatic regions (McLaughlin et al., 1997). Thus, a decrease 
of soil pH due to environmental acidifi cation, which is a well-recognized problem in Sweden, 
may further increase the Cd concentration in food stuff (Hellström et al., 2007). While Cd 
levels in potatoes and carrots vary, clearly the contribution to the total dietary Cd intake in 
Sweden is substantial (Grawé et al., 2000). Plants are known to tolerate cadmium well and as 
a result cadmium toxicity in plants occurs at higher concentrations than those causing toxicity 
in human and animals. Indeed, adverse effects of cadmium entering the food chain of some

wild animals have recently been reported. Classic symptoms of cadmium toxicity in bone 
were found in female white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) that feed heavily on willows 
(Sallix glauca; Satarug et al., 2003). The willow has a greater ability to concentrate cadmium 
from soils compared with other plant species of the same areas (Larison et al., 2000). High 
levels of cadmium were found in liver and kidney samples of moose (Alces alces); another 
animal species known to normally eat large quantities of willows (Kim et al., 2000). In early 
studies, seabirds, starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), Japanese quails (Coturnex coturnex) were also 
found to be susceptible to cadmium that entered into their food chain (Gochfeld, 1997).

The upper respiratory tract and lungs are most exposed to cadmium dusts and vapors of 
polluted atmospheres. Acute ingestion targets intestine, liver and kidneys: the latter accumulate 
cadmium and thereby experience serious tubular injury (Martelli et al., 2006). Once absorbed, 
cadmium has a very long half-life, estimated at more than 20 years in humans (Satarug et al., 
2003). This exceptional residence time in the body refl ects that cadmium can be effi ciently 
trapped in the body and that it escapes through detoxifi cation (Martelli et al., 2006).

The human clinical symptoms observed upon cadmium exposure are tightly associated 
with the organ distribution of the metal. Inhalation causes respiratory stress and injures the 
respiratory tract. Emphysema, anosmia and chronic rhinitis have been linked to high cadmium 
concentrations in polluted air. Cadmium has been classifi ed as a human pulmonary carcinogen 
because of the large incidence of lung cancers in occupationally exposed populations 
(Martelli et al., 2006). Cadmium may cause or participate to the onset or propagation of other 
kinds of cancers, but the scarcity of data has not extended the range of human cadmium 
carcinogenicity beyond lung carcinoma (Waalkes, 2003).

Anemia and eosinophilia have been associated with cadmium intoxication, and accumulation 
in kidneys leads to nephropathy and proteinurea (Järup and Åkesson, 2009). Osteomalacia 
and osteoporosis may result from cadmium interference with the formation and maintenance 
of bones. A clear link between water and food pollution by cadmium with recapitulation of 
some of the above symptoms (osteomalacia, bone fractures, proteinurea, pain…) has been 
established for the Itai–Itai disease observed in a mining region of Japan (Martelli et al., 2006).

Copper

Copper (Cu; CAS 7440-50-8) is classifi ed as a group 3 (not classifi able as carcinogenic to 
humans; IARC http://monographs.iarc.fr/, 2013). Cu chemical and physical properties (e.g. 
high thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity, malleability, low corrosion) have made 
it one of the most important metals. Copper have four oxidation states: Cu(O), Cu(I), Cu(II), 
and Cu(III).

In humans, copper is a respiratory irritant. Workers exposed to copper dust report a number 
of symptoms that are suggestive of respiratory irritation, including coughing, sneezing, 
thoracic pain, and runny nose (ATSDR, 2005a). According to Suciu et al. (1981) grinding 
and sieving copper dust workers, anorexia, nausea, and occasional diarrhea were reported. 
Exposure levels ranged from 111 to 434 mg Cu m3 over a 3-year period. It is likely that the 
observed gastrointestinal effects were due to oral exposure to copper. Ingestion probably 
resulted from mucocilliary clearance of copper particles deposited in the nasopharyngeal and 
tracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract (ATSDR, 2005a).

There are numerous reports of acute gastrointestinal effects in humans after ingestion of large 
amounts of copper in drinking water or beverages. The most prevalent effects are nausea and 



17312. Appendixes

vomiting, which typically occur shortly after ingestion and are not persistent. Abdominal pain 
and diarrhea have also been reported, but their incidence is typically much lower than nausea 
and vomiting (ATSDR, 2005a).

Silver

Silver (Ag; CAS 7440-22-4) occurs naturally in several oxidation states. The most common 
are elemental silver (0 oxidation state) and the monovalent silver ion (+1 oxidation state). 
Most of the Ag toxicological studies have investigated these chemical forms of the element. 
Other possible oxidation states of silver are +2 and +3, however, no toxicological studies were 
located that researched the health effects of silver compounds with these oxidation states. 
Most occupational exposures to silver occur through inhalation of silver-containing dusts or 
dermal exposure to photographic compounds (ATSDR, 1999b).

Tungsten

Tungsten (W,  CAS 14040-11-0) is a naturally occurring element found in the earth surface 
rocks, and typically not occur as the free element in nature. Of the more than 20 tungsten-
bearing minerals, some of the commonly used commercial ones include feberite (iron 
tungstate), huebnerite (manganese tungstate), wolframite (iron-manganese tungstate), and 
scheelite (calcium tungstate). Tungsten forms a variety of different compounds, such as 
tungsten trioxide, tungsten carbide, and ammonium paratungstate (ATSDR, 2005b).

Pulmonary fi brosis, memory and sensory defi cits, and increased mortality due to lung cancer 
have been attributed to occupational exposure to dusts generated during the manufacture or 
use of high tensile strength tungsten (hard metal). Acute oral exposure to tungsten does not 
appear to be a particular toxicity concern, based on acute oral LD

50
 values ranging from 240 

to 11,300 mg kg-1 day for several soluble tungsten compounds (ATSDR, 2005b).

Zinc

Zinc (Zn, CAS 7440-66-6) is ubiquitous in the environment and occurs in the earth’s crust 
at an average concentration of about 70 mg kg-1 (Thomas, 1991). Zinc metal is not found 
freely in nature; rather it occurs in the +2 oxidation state primarily as various minerals such as 
sphalerite (zinc sulfi de), smithsonite (zinc carbonate), and zincite (zinc oxide). Fifty-fi ve zinc 
containing minerals are known to exist (USEPA, 2005). The primary anthropogenic sources of 
zinc in the environment are from metal smelters and mining activities (ATSDR, 2005c).

Human studies have investigated the effects of dietary zinc supplementation. High doses 
can cause clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, while low doses primarily affect the 
status of other essential nutrients such as copper and iron (USEPA, 2005; WHO, 2001b).

No adequate experimental evidence has been found to indicate that zinc salts administered 
orally or parenterally are tumorigenic. Defi ciency and supplements of zinc can have an 
infl uence on carcinogenesis, possibly as a result of the infl uence of zinc on cell growth (Rath 
et al., 1991). Zinc has been demonstrated to inhibit the mutagenic action of some genotoxic 
carcinogens (Leonard and Gerber, 1989) but has also been shown to be co-carcinogenic in 
other studies (Wallenius et al., 1979; USEPA, 2005).

 sample shows a very fi ne grained matrix (&lt;1 mm) 

with intensive meteoric alteration and the presence of iron oxides/hydroxides, being classifi ed 
as an argillaceous shale with a very low metamorphic grade. The microscopic observation 
identifi ed the lepidoblastic texture due to the predominance of biotite, sericite and chlorite 
with subparallel basal sections. Also two deformational events were recognized. From Fig. 12.2 
is possible to see darker levels rich in biotite, chlorite, iron oxides/ hydroxides and also ligher 
levels mainly of quartz coexisting with some chlorite and sericite.

lepidoblastic texture with very fi ne grain and cleavage typical from low grade metamorphism 
conditions. Some disperse elliptical nodules occurs with high iron oxide/hydroxide 
concentrations, probably resulting from the pre-existing intense biotite alteration (Fig. 12.3a). 
Sporadically is also possible to observe some lithic fragments, mainly quartz, elongated and 
parallel to the main schistosity (Fig. 12.3b). The general mineralogical composition of this rock 
is muscovite (sericite), quartz, chlorite and biotite. Some detrital particles of tourmaline, and 
hydrated iron oxides are present as accessory minerals.

A sample of spotted argillaceous shale (Sch

) was also collected. The light grey colored 
rock has a very fi ne grained matrix with abundant grey-greenish nodules, clearly identifi ed 
at naked eye. Under the microscope is recognized a porphyroblastic texture, with abundant 
micas nodules – manly chlorite, biotite, muscovite/sericite with some associated iron oxide/
hydroxides, with a extremely thin quartz and sericite aggregate (Fig. 12.4). These nodules are 
responsible for the spots. The mineralogy of this rock sample is mainly sericite, chlorite, 
biotite, quartz, iron oxide/hydroxides and opaque minerals (5 to 10%). 

The rock sample Qz is classifi ed as an impure quartzite, with fi ne grain and dark grey color. 
The microscope analysis shows the abundance of quartz fragments with dimensions from 60 
x 30 ?m to 750 x 370 ?m, in a very fi ne grained matrix, mostly sericitic. Is also observed the 
rough cleavage development with abundant quartz fragments (Fig. 12.5). The mineralogical 
composition of this rock is quartz, plagioclase, ortose, tourmaline and zircon, disposed in

Panasqueira mine
The Panasqueira hydrothermal mineralization, located in central Portugal, is the biggest Sn–W deposit of
the Western Europe. The main evidences of the mining exploitation and ore treatment operations are tes-
tified with huge tailings, mainly, in the Rio and Barroca Grande areas. The mining and beneficiation pro-
cesses, at the site, produces metal rich mine wastes. Oxidation of sulfides tailings and flow from open
impoundments are responsible for the mobilization and migration of metals from the mine wastes into
the environment. Acid mine drainage (AMD) discharged from Rio tailing has a pH around 3 and high
metal concentrations. In Zêzere river, Fe and As are the most rapidly depleted downstream from AMD
once As adsorbs, coprecipitate and form compounds with iron oxyhydroxides. The Zêzere river waters
are oversaturated with respect to kaolinite and goethite and ferrihydrite can precipitate on stream with
a near-neutral pH. At sites having low pH the dissolved Fe species in the water, mainly, occur as sulfate
complexes due to a high SO4 concentration. Melanterite (Fe

2+(SO4)?7(H2O)) and minor amounts of roze-
nite (Fe2+(SO4)?4(H2O)) and szomolnokite (Fe2+(SO4)?(H2O)) were observed on Rio tailing basement.

1. Introduction

Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a well-known international envi-
ronmental problem related with both working and abandoned
mining operations. Large masses of sulfide minerals are exposed
during the mining and milling processes. The generation and dis-
charge of AMD with low pH and containing high concentrations
of dissolved metals may seriously disturb the water quality. The
key to understand mining effects depends directly on understand-
ing the processes that produce AMD. Acidic drainage is caused by
the oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed to atmospheric oxygen.
Although acid drainage is commonly associated with the extrac-
tion and processing of sulfide-bearing metalliferous ore deposits
and sulfide-rich coal, AMD can occur wherever sulfide minerals
are exposed to atmospheric oxygen (Blowes et al., 2003). The oxi-
dation of pyrite is a complex hydrobiogeochemical process that ad-
versely affects the water quality of receiving streams by producing
acid waters with high metal concentrations. Sulfide ore extraction
and processing enhances the rate of pyrite oxidation, increases the
rate of acid production, and can cause severe environmental
damage (Plumlee and Logsdon, 1999; Jambor et al., 2003;
Nordstrom et al., 2007).

The Panasqueira mine was chosen to be studied due to several
factors: (a) it is an active mine; (b) the existence of huge volumes
of tailing piles and mud dams, (c) small villages near the mine site;
(d) the Zêzere river crosses the area, which supply the Castelo de
Bode dam (located 90 km downstream), the main water provider
for Lisbon; and (e) the local population strongly depends on the
use of land and water for their subsistence. The effect of Panasque-
ira mining activities and the metals release from acid mine waters
to water courses is dynamic and actual (e-EcoRisk, 2007; Ávila
et al., 2008; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013; Candeias et al., 2013;
Coelho et al., 2013). Regarding the study presented by Ávila et al.
(2008) and its conclusions, mainly related to the dynamics of
leaching, transport, and accumulation of some selected metals
and metalloids in different media (stream sediments, alluvium,
surface waters, impoundment materials, iron coatings, arsenopy-
rite stockpile material, and ferruginous crust) this study aims to
characterize the heavy metal contamination at Zêzere river taking
into consideration the physico-chemical properties of the waters
sampled on the Zêzere river and along the mine drainage. The main
goal of this geochemical research is (a) to characterize the surface
water chemical changes that occur along the flow path of Zêzere
ugal). J.

2. Site description

The Panasqueira hydrothermal mineralization is the biggest Sn–
W deposit of Western Europe and has been in operation since 1896
to the present date (Smith, 2006; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013). The
mining concession is located geographically in Central Portugal
(Fig. 1), between Gardunha and S. Pedro de Açor mountains, at
approximately 20 km SW of Serra da Estrela, the highest mountain
of mainland Portugal (1993 m). The local topography ranges in alti-
tude from 350 to 1080 m (Reis, 1971), with deep valleys. Climate,
which can be an important instability factor, is aggressive with
hot and dry conditions during the summer and very cold, rainy,
and windy conditions in the winter (Ávila et al., 2008). The mean
annual temperature is 12 ?C, ranging from 0 ?C during the winter
to 30 ?C in the summer (source www.inag.pt). The streams, with
the exception of Zêzere river, are generally dry in the summer
and flooded in the winter. The small villages around the mine have
a historical dependence on soil and water use – drinking water,
agriculture, cattle breeding, fishing and sylviculture.

2.1. Geology and mineralization

According to the paleogeographic and tectonic zoning estab-
lished by Lotze (1945) and Julivert et al. (1974), this deposit is in-
cluded in the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ), where the Sn–W deposits,
such as Panasqueira, are spatially related to the contacts between
the sintectonic muscovite–biotite and the metasedimentary coun-
try rocks. A detailed description of the local geology was presented
in Ávila et al. (2008). The Panasqueira deposit contains mainly,
wolframite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and cassiterite. The
Panasqueira deposit consists on a sequence known as the upper

Precambrian–Cambrian aged Beira-Schist Formation sequence that
consists on a series of stacked, subhorizontal and hydrothermal
quartz veins intruding into the Beira schists. No granite crops out
in the district, but a granite cupola strongly greisenized with
increasingly alteration was penetrated at shallow depths in the
mine (Kelly and Rye, 1979). Thermal metamorphism spatially asso-
ciated with the Hercynian batholith produced a regionally exten-
sive aureole of spotted shales in the schist–graywacke complex.
The paragenesis is complex and 4 stages of mineral formation are
accepted by most of the authors who have studied this deposit:
1st stage, the oxide silicate phase (quartz, wolframite; cassiterite);
2nd phase, the main sulfide phase (pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite,
sphalerite, chalcopyrite); 3rd stage, the pyrrhotite alteration phase
(marcasite, siderite, galena, Pb–Bi–Ag sulfosalts); and 4th stage,
the late carbonate phase (dolomite, calcite) (Noronha et al.,
1992; Correa and Naique, 1998; Corrêa de Sá et al., 1999; Breiter,
2001). At Panasqueira, more than 65 minerals including sulfides,
sulfosalts, oxides, carbonates, silicates, phosphates, and tungstate
minerals, have been identified (Kelly and Rye, 1979).
2.2. Mining activity

The Panasqueira mining concession has been in production for
over 100 years and is one of the largest economic vein deposits
in the world. The first prospecting license was granted in 1895
and the first reference to wolframite mineralization in Panasqueira
mine reportedly dated to 1896. The mine produce wolframite and
cassiterite concentrates, with secondary production of copper
concentrates. Arsenopyrite (the main sulfide) is discarded to the
tailings which contain about 30% of As. During the period
1947–2001, the mine produced about 96,456 t of WO3, 4901 t of
SnO2 and 28,924 t of Cu from more than 27 Mt of rock (Cavey
and Gunning, 2006). The long history of mining and milling
activities are stated by the presence of huge tailings and mud
nd the surface waters sampling sites.

dams. Nowadays offices, underground exploration, milling pro-
cesses, tailing (?7,000,000 m3) and mud dams (?1,193,885 m3 –
one active and one deactivated) are located in Barroca Grande. Un-
til 1996 the underground operations took place in Barroca Grande
and the ore were transported by an aerial rope tramway trough
5.1 km to the concentration plant located in Rio. The milling facil-
ities at Rio, located near Zêzere river (Fig. 1), had the advantage of
local ore deposits and water from the river for milling operations
(Crosby, 2001). The Rio site consists in a large area of tailings, a
seepage collection and treatment system. With a long history of
mining and milling at Rio, a significant volume of tailings materials
was generated (?1,200,000 m3) with an elevation of approxi-
mately 350 m, slopes of about 35? and three main types of materi-
als: coarse grained waste rock composed primarily of schist and
quartz; fine grained mill tailings originating from mill operations
composed by sand, mud, and slush and an pile with arsenopyrite
(9400 m3) separated during mill flotation processing, that re-
mained exposed until June 2006 when was capped with geotextile
and layers of clay (Gilchrist and Mahmoud, 1999; Crosby, 2001; e-
EcoRisk, 2007). The muds and slush were discharged into a pond
that was intentionally created for that purpose. The pond is an
open air impoundment and contains 731,034 m3 of rejected ore
concentrates with high metal levels (Ávila et al., 2008). The piles
and open air impoundments are exposed to the atmospheric con-
ditions for a long time, which affect their chemical, mineralogical,
physical and geotechnical elements. Infiltration of rain water oc-
curs across the tailing area, this water carries the acid products
of sulfides oxidation. To prevent acid drainage, two water treat-
ment plants exist in Panasqueira mine, one in Barroca Grande
and other in Rio, where the acid waters formed are collected,
pumped and treated. Acid effluents are neutralized with lime

Ca(OH)2 which promotes metal precipitation and flocculation
when pH increases. After this treatment clean water is conducted
to the ore dressing plant, or discharged directly in the Zêzere river,
while precipitates are disposed via pipeline in the mud dam (Gil-
christ and Mahmoud, 1999). On the bottom of Rio tailing a channel
system has been installed to collect the seepage, of acid mine
drainage water (AMD), nevertheless during the winter and periods
of heavy rainfall the system easily overload resulting in mixing of
AMD directly with the Zêzere river.

3. Materials and methods

3.1. Field sampling

The surface waters sampling sites (Fig. 1) were chosen to eval-
uate the influence of the tailings and AMD on the nearest streams
and to know the way of the contamination diffusion in the Zêzere
river. They include three samples in Casinhas stream downstream
Barroca Grande tailing (CS1, CS2 and CS3) and one sample from the
mine adit at Barroca Grande (BG). In Rio site, the sampling, include
three AMD seepage waters (SP1, SP2 and SP3) and in the main river
include two local background waters (Bk1 and Bk2), one sample
after Casinhas stream confluence with Zêzere river (CF) and one
sample from Zêzere (ZZ) but downstream of both tailings areas
(Barroca Grande and Rio).

Samples were collected and filtered from each site using a clean
1 L acid-washed polyethylene bottle and stored at 4 ?C until ana-
lyzed. Samples for metal analysis were preserved, with pH reduc-
tion to 2.0 using HNO3, avoiding Fe hydroxide precipitation.
Temperature, pH, and specific conductivity of the surface waters
were recorded at each site.

3.2. Chemical analysis

Surface water samples were analyzed without pre-concentra-
tion. The analyzed elements include major anions (HCO?3 , Cl

?,
NO?3 , and SO

2?
4 ), major cations (Na, K, Mg

2+ and Ca2+), as well a
suite of dissolved trace metals (Ag, Al, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg,
Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Sb, and Zn). Unacidified samples were analyzed using
a Dionex 1000i ion chromatography (IC) Work33 station to deter-
mine the Cl?, NO?3 , and SO

2?
4 concentrations. Anisocratic elution

with a sodium bicarbonate–sodium carbonate eluent was em-
ployed together with a Dionex AS4-SC column. The alkalinity was
determined in situ by volumetric titration on filtered unacidified
samples using H2SO4 acid 0.16 N.

Although standards were prepared containing only the above
anions, other anions would have been detected if present at levels
greater than ?0.1 mg L?1. For concentrated samples, dilution was
required for reliable anion analysis. The concentrations of major
cations and trace elements in acidified waters were determined
using mass inductive plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the LNEG
accredited lab. Reagent blanks and duplicate samples were in-
serted into each batch for quality control (Ramsey et al., 1987).
The geostandards AQUACHECK and EAA 4 were used to check the
validity and reproducibility of the results. Typical uncertainties,
including all error sources, are ?6% for the trace elements, and be-
tween 2% and 7% for the major anions, depending on the concen-
tration levels. The limit of detection for the analyzed trace metals
ranges between 0.05 and 10 mg L?1.
3.3. Mineralogical studies

The mineralogical characterization of samples was performed
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips diffractometer (model
X’Pert). Working conditions were automatic divergence slit, Cu
Ka monochromatic radiation, graphite monochromator, 20 mA
and 40 kV. Samples were run at a speed of 0.05? 2h/min (2–70?).

3.4. Data analysis

Piper diagram (PD): widely used to study the similarities and
differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into
certain chemical types (Chadha, 1999). As described by Karanth
(1987) the PD show the essential chemical character of different
constituents in percentage reacting values, expressed in milligrams
equivalent, for each water type. Some more detailed information of
these plots might be seen in Freeze and Cherry, 1979.

Ficklin diagram: in order to interpret variations in drainage
water chemistry Plumlee et al. (1992) developed one diagram,
based on pH and the sum of the base metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Co
and Ni. These parameters were selected rather than more common
metals such as Fe, Al and Mn because have proven to be the most
diagnostic in differentiating between different geologic controls
(INAP, 2009).

PHREEQC code and WATEQ4F: is a geochemical modeling soft-
ware based on ion-association aqueous model and is capable of
describing chemical reactions and transport processes in waters.
It is based on equilibrium chemistry of aqueous solutions with
minerals, gases, solid solutions, exchangers, and sorption surfaces.
PHREEQC can be used, among others, as a speciation program to
calculate saturation indices (SI) and the distribution of aqueous
species (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). Additionally WATEQ4F is
also a chemical speciation code for waters. It uses the water field
parameters of temperature, pH, Eh, dissolved oxygen and alkalin-
ity, and also the chemical analysis computing the distribution of
aqueous species, ion activities, and mineral saturation indices that
specify the propensity of a water to dissolve or precipitate a set of
minerals (Drever, 1988; Nordstrom and Munoz, 1986). The
WATEQ4F results are used primarily to examine the tendency of
water to reach mineral solubility equilibrium as a constraint on
interpreting the chemistry of waters. These results are a helpful

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Water geochemistry

The results presented in Table 1, show that water samples can be
divided distinctly into three main groups based on its location and
also in the pH and electric conductivity (SC) conditions: the
Casinhas stream samples with 4.3 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;5.7 and 0.35 &amp;lt;SC
&amp;lt;1.09 mS cm?1; the Zêzere river waters with 6.8 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;7.1 and
0.037 &amp;lt;SC &amp;lt;0.076 mS cm?1 and the seepage water with a
2.9 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;3.9 and 1.26 &amp;lt;SC &amp;lt;4.40 mS cm?1. These different types
of water represent distinct hydrogeochemical processes. The trace
metal concentrations in the seepage water and water collected in
the Casinhas stream are higher than the concentration in the Zêzere
water. Sulfate concentrations cover a range from 4 to 3717 mg L?1

and the highest concentrations are associated with waste piles
and correlate with low pH values (r = ?0.98, p &amp;lt;0.05). The TDS val-
ues of the seepage waters ranged from 819 to 2860 mg L?1. The

Afr. Earth Sci. (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2013.10.006
Casinhas stream waters showed higher values of TDS from 227.5
to 707.2 mg L?1 than those of the Zêrere River which ranged from
24.1 to 49.4 mg L?1.

(0.98) and SO2?4 =Zn (0.98). The high positive correlation with Ca,
possibly, reflects the influence of gypsum and calcite dissolution
plus sulfide oxidation. Table 1 shows that major ions contents tend
to increase with the decrease of pH, whereas (HCO?3 and Cl

?

showed positive correlation with pH, indicating the dissolution of
minerals related to the host rock composition. Based on these ob-
served hydrogeochemical characteristics, along with the major
mineral constituents in the rock and ores, it is suggested that the
seepage waters are related to sulfide weathering and dissolution
of secondary minerals whereas the Zêzere river chemical charac-
teristics of the waters are mainly controlled by dissolution of car-
bonate and silicate minerals.

Hydrochemical compositions of the water samples were plotted
in Piper trilinear diagram (Fig. 2). Generally, the seepage and Casi-
nhas stream waters are classified as Mg/Ca – SO4 type waters. The

surface waters collected upstream the Zêzere river are Na-HCO3
type while the downstream Zêzere waters have been classified as
mixed waters between Mg/Ca and CO3/SO4 type.

The drainage discharges from Rio tailing are typical mine
waters and belong to the Ca/Mg-SO4 type. The results show that
these three groups of water have different geochemical evolution-
ary paths during their circulation. The decreasing order of the
abundance of major ions in seepage and Casinhas stream waters
is SO2?4 &gt; Ca

waters have different pattern from the previous ones and amongst
themselves, upstream both tailings the water reveal the following

oxidation of sulfide minerals in mine-waste rock piles and tailings
impoundments generates acidic waters containing high concentra-
tions of SO2?4 , Fe (II), and other metals. According to Blowes et al.
(2003) a sequence of geochemical reactions occurring in the mine
wastes and in underlying aquifers results in profound changes in
the concentrations of dissolved constituents and in the mineralogy
and physical properties of the mine waste and aquifer materials.
The Casinhas stream and seepage waters show low pH and are en-
riched in sulfate ions but also in some of the major and trace
elements.

Low-pH conditions promote the dissolution of many metal-
bearing solids and the metals desorption from solid surfaces. The
probable source of sulfate and heavy metals are the oxidation of
sulfide minerals, mainly arsenopyrite, but also pyrite and chalco-
pyrite. These acidic waters are displaced into underlying or adja-
cent geological materials, or it is discharged directly to the
adjacent surface water flow system. The geochemical reactions of
these waters with the gangue minerals result in progressive in-
creases in pH through acid neutralization reactions and the atten-
uation of the concentrations of dissolved metals released from
mine wastes.

According to the Ficklin diagram (Fig. 3a) the Panasqueira
waters can be separated in four groups: (1) high-acid and extreme
metal content; (2) acid and high-metal content; (3) near neutral
and high metal content; and (4) near neutral pH and low metal
content. The first three groups represent the seepage and the Casi-
nhas stream waters, and the fourth group includes the Zêzere river
samples, collected upstream and downstream the Rio tailing.
According to Plumlee et al. (1999) the group classified as high acid
and extreme metal rich are typical of drainage water derived from
polymetallic deposits characterized by low buffering potential. The
most polluted waters are in or close to the mine tailing, where the
metal dispersion and acidity generation is clearer. Two of the Casi-
nhas stream samples also show a high metal content but with a pH
values near neutral. On the other hand the waters collected in Zêz-
ere river present a near neutral pH and low contents of metals,
more evident on the upstream samples. This high metal contents
and low pH reflect the influence of the acidic waters from the tail-
ings and mud impoundments, while the low concentration values
and neutral pH reflects the dilution phenomena and the geochem-
ical baselines values of local surface waters. The plots of SO4, As, Al,
Fe and Mn concentrations versus pH values (Fig. 3b–f) show the
same trend of increasing metal content with decreasing pH and re-
flects the greater amounts of sulfide minerals and a smaller con-
tent of carbonates and other minerals that consume acid
according to Plumlee et al. (1999).

minerals (Fig. 4b), kaolinite and montmorillonite, are undersatu-
rated and most of the sulfates (Fig. 4c), alunite, anhydrite and gyp-
sum, are nearly in equilibrium state in these waters. Regarding
Zêzere river waters, according to the calculated SI, they are over-
saturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay minerals and
undersaturated in sulfates.

The seepage waters (SP1, SP2, SP3 and BG) are mainly saturated
or near equilibrium with respect to alunite KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6 while
the majority samples of the Casinhas stream and the Zêzere river
are oversaturated in gibbsite Al(OH)3. It is thought that an increase
in sulfate activity may promote the formation of sulfate minerals
(e.g. gypsum, anhydrite and alunite) when the aqueous solution
are rich in cations such as Ca, Al and K. The association of alteration
minerals alunite + quartz is formed at pH lower than 3.5, while the
kaolinite + alunite assemblage develops at pH 4.9 (Perry et al.,
1980 and Wirsching et al., 1990). The relationships between alu-
nite and kaolinite were determined by Wirsching et al. (1990) on
the basis of experimental studies.

The alunite is a reaction product of kaolinite with sulfuric acid.
According to Inoue (1995), the very low pH values observed in
seepage waters, are related to the sulfides oxidation.

The mineralogical composition of samples collected in Rio site
(in the dam and in the tailing), reveals the presence of arsenopy-
rite, scorodite, marcasite, pyrite, mica, quartz, illite, vermiculite,
natrojarosite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite, montmorillonite and mont-
morillonite–vermiculite. The mineralogical composition of Zêzere
river stream sediments revealed the presence of mica, quartz, chlo-
rite, kaolinite, feldspar and hematite (XRD identification). At the base
of the Rio tailings dam, scorodite (FeAsO4?2H2O), melanterite
(Fe2+(SO4)?7(H2O)) and minor amounts of rozenite (Fe2+(SO4)?4(H2O))
and szomolnokite (Fe2+(SO4)?(H2O)) were observed and identified
by XRD. Acid mine drainage discharged from the Rio tailing (SP1)
has a pH of 3.0 and high concentrations of trace metals (Table 1).
Also, As concentrations in these samples are high (2140 lg L?1

As). Iron concentration in stream waters decreases rapidly
downstream with pH rising. Arsenic concentration decreases
downstream with the same pattern of Fe (see sample
ZZ – Fe = 0.13 mg L?1 and As = 4 lg L?1). These results show that
Fe and As are the most rapidly depleted elements from AMD and
indicates that concentrations of Fe and As decreases by dilution
as well as by the formation of precipitate. It is well known that
As adsorbs and/or coprecipitates and forms compounds with ferric
oxyhydroxide (Dove and Rimstidt, 1985).

5. Conclusions

The present study characterizes the Zêzere river hidrogeochem-
istry on the basis of physicochemical properties of waters with dif-
ferent locations regarding the tailings: Zêzere river – two samples
collected upstream both tailings representing the local background
hydrochemistry; two samples collected downstream the tailings;
Casinhas stream – three samples downstream Barroca Grande tail-
ing; seepage waters – three samples collected in Rio tailing base-
ment and affected by acid mine drainage and one sample from
Barroca Grande mine adit. The seepage and Casinhas stream waters
were characterized as (Ca2+ + Mg2+) SO2?4 water type while the up-
stream Zêzere river waters are Na-bicarbonate and the down-
stream Zêzere river waters were classified as being mixed Mg2+

and Ca2+ bicarbonate/sulfate waters. The acid effluents are
neutralized with lime Ca(OH)2 promoting metal precipitation and

flocculation when pH increases. After the treatment clean water
is conducted to the ore dressing plant, or discharged directly in
the Zêzere river.

By means of the USGS geochemical code PHREEQC, speciation
was performed and shows that the seepage waters are undersatu-
rated in most of the silicate minerals and clay minerals and the sul-
fates are nearly in equilibrium state. The Zêzere river waters are
oversaturated in some of the silicate minerals and clay minerals
and are undersaturated in sulfates. The majority of the Casinhas
stream and the Zêzere river waters are oversaturated in gibbsite.
An increase in sulfate activity may promote the formation of sul-
fate minerals when the aqueous solution is rich in cations such
as Ca, Al and K. Acid mine drainage discharged from Rio tailing
has pH around 3 and high metal concentration. It was observed
that Fe and As are the elements where the concentrations quickly
decreases due to adsorption and coprecipitation with ferric oxyhy-
droxides. Melanterite and minor amounts of rozenite and
szomolnokite were observed on Rio tailing basement.

Nevertheless the Zêzere river and the three water reservoir
dams located downstream of the Panasqueira mining area: Cabril
dam (near Panasqueira mine, is one of the biggest Portuguese
dams, high of 136 m, and originates one of the biggest water re-
serves in the country with capacity of 720,000,000 m3), Bouçã
dam (located between the Cabril dam and the Castelo de Bode
dam, has a high of 63 m and a total capacity of 48,400,000 m3)
and Castelo de Bode dam (placed in the limits of Tomar and Abran-
tes districts, is one of the most important Portuguese dams, pre-
senting a high of 115 m and a total capacity of 1,095,000,000 m3,
and is used for water supply of Lisbon city and neighbor districts)
presents, respectively, water with quality compatible with human
consume but not for recreation and sportive proposes or fishing
support life; the Bouçã dam presents water quality compatible
with human consume, recreation and sportive proposes and also
with fishing support life and the Castelo de Bode dam presents
good water quality for all proposes (e-Ecorisk, 2007). In the near
downstream valley area of Panasqueira mine, presently, there are
no aquifer systems or areas with hydrological contamination, nev-
ertheless, a catastrophic spill from the Rio tailing and open air
impoundment, could be a potential danger and a huge hazard for
Zêzere river and the referred water reservoir dams and, obviously,
for the entire environment.

The active Panasqueira mine is a tin–tungsten (Sn–W) mineralization hosted by metasediments with
quartz veins rich in ferberite. The economic exploitation has been focused on wolframite, cassiterite
and chalcopyrite. The mineralization also comprises several sulphides, carbonates and silver sulphosalts.
The mining and beneficiation processes produces arsenic-rich mine wastes laid up in huge tailings and
open air impoundments that are the main source of pollution in the surrounding area, once the oxidation
of sulphides can result in the mobilization and migration of trace metals/metalloids from the mining
wastes into the environment, releasing contaminants into the ecosystem.

A geochemical survey was undertaken, in order to investigate the environmental contamination impact
on agricultural and residential soils in S. Francisco de Assis village due to the mining activities. Rhizo-
sphere samples, vegetables (Solanum tubersum sava and Brassica olerácea L.) which constitute an impor-
tant part of the local human diet), irrigation waters and road dusts were collected in private residences in
S. Francisco de Assis village. According to the Ontario guidelines (Ministry of Environment, 2011), the
Arsenic contents in the rhizosphere soils exceed 20 times the reference value for agricultural soils
(11 mg kg?1). The result obtained showed that some edible plants frequently used in the region could
be enriched in these metals/metalloids and may represent a serious hazard if consumed. The potatoes
tend to have a preferential accumulation in the leaves and roots while in cabbages most elements have
a preferential accumulation in the roots. An index of the risk for residents, due to ingesting of these met-
als/metalloids, by consuming vegetables grown around the sampling area, was calculated and the result
indicates that the inhabitants of S. Francisco de Assis village are probably exposed to some potential
health risks through the intake of arsenic, cadmium and also lead via consuming their vegetables.

1. Introduction

The demand for ore comes from the beginning of the human
existence and this activity plays a key role for human survival
and development. Europe have an unquestionably importance in
the world economy and mineral extraction plays an important role
in the supply as also in the consumption of all groups of explored
minerals. Portugal holds a rich and complex geology, which gives it
a considerable mineral potential, although this sector only contrib-
utes with 1% for the Portuguese Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The main mineral resources in Portugal are copper (Cu), tin (Sn),
tungsten (W), lithium (Li), gold (Au), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb),
uranium (U), coal, raw materials for construction and ornamental
stones. Portugal is a country with a long mining tradition; it had
in the past and still has a strong mining activity. Land pollution
due to mining activities is a major issue in many European coun-
tries and Portugal is not an exception (Santos Oliveira and Ávila,
1995, 2003; Valente and Leal Gomes, 1998; Bobos et al., 2006;
Luís et al., 2009; Santos Oliveira et al., 2002; Ávila et al., 2005,
2008; Salgueiro et al., 2008; Grangeia et al., 2011; Candeias et al.,
2011a,b; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Antunes et al., 2002; Pinto
et al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2009, 2012; Gomes et al., 2010).

The extraction of metals from sulphide minerals usually results
in large amounts of waste materials, tailings, and acid mine drain-
ages, which often contain high concentrations of potentially toxic
elements (PTE – As, Cu, Zn, Cd as an example) (Moore and Luoma,
1990; Boulet and Larocque, 1998; Jung, 2001; Naicker et al., 2003).
Metals/metalloids can be dispersed downstream due to the weath-
ering and erosion process of tailings. Thus, the extent and degree of
heavy metal contamination around the mines varies depending
upon geochemical characteristics and mineralization of tailings.

High concentrations of heavy metals can be found in and around
abandoned and active mines due to the discharge and dispersion
of mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops and stream
sediments (Lee et al., 2001; Jung, 2001; McKenzie and Pulford,
2002; Witte et al., 2004). This will ‘‘eventually’’ lead to a loss of bio-
diversity, amenity, and economic well-being as well as pose a po-
tential health risk to residents in the vicinity of the mining area
(Verner and Ramsey, 1996; Lee et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2002;
Galán et al., 2003).

Soils are very prone to contamination from hydrological sources
and also from atmospheric sources. When soils are the receptor of
tailings drainage coming from metal mining and smelting this
waste disposal causes a major impact, posing serious environmen-
tal concerns. The smelter emissions as well as wind-blown dust
from mine tailings and smelter slag dumps are generally the main
point sources of metal/metalloid (As, Cd, Cr. . .) soil pollution (Ettler
et al., 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012; Kr?íbek et al., 2010; Šrác?ek et al.,
2010; Vítková et al., 2010). Exposure to these hazardous elements
may have different pathways, through the ingestion of vegetables
grown on contaminated soils or through dust inhalation and dust
adhering to plants. According to several authors (Bosso and Enzwe-
iler, 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Douay et al., 2008; Juhasz et al., 2011;
Roussel et al., 2010; Ettler et al., 2012) the studies dealing with the
bioavailability and bioaccessibility of metals/metalloids contami-
nants in highly-polluted soils are extremely useful in understand-
ing the possible effect on biota, and particularly on human health
due to the exposure to those contaminants (Banza et al., 2009;
Roussel et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2007).

In a previous paper from the same authors (Ferreira da Silva
et al., 2013) the environmental contamination impact on S. Fran-
cisco de Assis (SFA) agricultural and residential soils due to the
mining activities has been investigated.

The objectives of this study are: (a) the assessment of the levels
of soil contamination in respect to median concentrations of PTE in
the region; (b) the determination of the associations between the
different PTE and their spatial distribution; (c) the identification
of possible sources of contamination that can explain the spatial
patterns of soil pollution in the SFA area; (d) determine the associ-
ations between the different toxic elements and identify the possi-
ble contamination sources that can explain the risk to the SFA
population by the ingestion of some metals/metalloids by consum-
ing vegetables that grow in their yards located in the mine vicinity.
2. The study area

The Panasqueira mine is located in Central Portugal (Fig. 1a).
Nowadays the economic exploitation is located in Barroca Grande
as well as the beneficiation plant. S. Francisco de Assis is a little vil-
lage, with 16.24 km2 and 692 inhabitants, located downstream the
Barroca Grande tailings deposit and impoundments. The topogra-
phy ranges in altitude from 350 to 1080 m (Reis, 1971), with deep
valleys. The streams are generally dry in the summer and flooded
in the winter.

Climate, which can be an important instability factor, is aggres-
sive in the Panasqueira region, with hot and dry conditions during
the summer and very cold, rainy, and windy conditions in the win-
ter. The mean annual rain precipitation in the region is 1200–
1400 mm; snow fall is frequent, particularly above the altitude of
700 m. The annual mean temperature is ?12 ?C, ranging from
?0 ?C during the winter to about ?30 ?C in summer. The evapo-
transpiration in this region is around 1080 mm (Ávila et al.,
2008). Table 1 shows the wind speed in Barroca Grande at an ele-
vation of 80 m (Costa, 2004; Costa and Estanqueiro, 2006a,b). Re-
sults point out that NNW is the preferential wind direction in the
area (Fig. 1b), and as we know the wind that blows from NW goes

to SE, and that is precisely the direction of S. Francisco de Assis
regarding the Barroca Grande tailing position.

Geology and Mineralization: The Panasqueira ore deposit is a
typical example of a Sn–W hydrothermal mineralization associated
with the Hercynian plutonism. A detailed description of the local
geology was presented in Ávila et al. (2008). The Panasqueira de-
posit consists of a series of stacked, sub-horizontal, hydrothermal
quartz veins intruding into the Beira schists formation of upper
Precambrian–Cambrian age and shales. The paragenesis is com-
plex. Four stages of mineral formation are generally accepted by
most of the authors who have studied this deposit: 1st stage: the
oxide–silicate phase (quartz, wolframite; cassiterite); 2nd stage:
the main sulphide phase (pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphaler-
ite, chalcopyrite); 3rd stage: the pyrrothite alteration phase (mar-
casite, siderite, galena, Pb–Bi–Ag sulphosalts); and 4th stage: the
late carbonate phase (dolomite, calcite) (Breiter, 2001; Corrêa de
Sá et al., 1999; Correa and Naique, 1998; Noronha et al., 1992).
At Panasqueira, more than 65 minerals, including sulphides, sul-
phosalts, oxides, carbonates, silicates, phosphates, and tungstate
minerals, have been identified (Kelly and Rye, 1979). In general,
the most common minerals in addition to quartz are: wolframite,
pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, cassiterite, beryl,
mica, and fluorite. The Panasqueira mine has many rare minerals
that can only be observed microscopically, making it a site of spe-
cific scientific importance.

Mining Activity and Potential Environmental Considerations: the
Panasqueira hydrothermal mineralization is the biggest Sn–W de-
posit of the Western Europe, and has been in operation since 1896
to the present date. The economic exploitation mainly focused on
wolframite, cassiterite, and chalcopyrite, the last two as by-prod-
ucts. On mean the ‘‘tout-venant’’ contains 0.3% WO3; the three final
concentrates contain 75% WO3, 72% SnO2, and 22% Cu together
with significant amounts of silver (Ag). At the present time, exploi-
tation is focused at Barroca Grande. The long history of exploitation
and ore treatment operations are testified by the presence of tail-
ings and other debris (Cavey and Gunning, 2006; Ávila et al.,
2008). Nowadays, the waste rock is still placed in the Barroca
Grande tailings area. The mine wastes were and still are discharged
in a huge tailings pile and in two mud dams, one is old and deac-
tivated, although stabilized in geotechnical terms, while the other
(smaller and disposed over the tailings) is still being fed with ster-
iles (some rich in sulphides, arsenopyrite is the main sulphide
present) obtained from the ore dressing operations. Mining exploi-
tation and ore processing operations left and continue to leave be-
hind huge tailings, being Barroca Grande ?7 Mm3 with two mud
dams ?1.2 Mm3, one of the main tailings deposit in the mine area.
The mining and beneficiation processes at the site produces metal/
metalloid rich mine wastes. According Ávila et al. (2008) the re-
jected materials from the ore processing, containing high concen-
trations of metals, stored in the open-air impoundments are
responsible for the continuous generation of acid drainage. Barroca
Grande impoundment shows high concentrations of As, Cd, Cu and
Zn. The analysis of the fine grained materials existing in the two
Barroca Grande open impoundments reveals the existence of arse-
nopyrite, ferberite, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, natrojarosite,
scorodite and hematite.

These tailings and impoundments are exposed to atmospheric
conditions. Surface runoff and water percolation leach the tailings
and form AMD. The tailings piles at Barroca Grande are adjacent to
the small, but perennially flowing, Casinhas Stream, which drains
to the Zêzere River. The unconfined tailings and open impound-
ments are the main source of pollution in the surrounding area
once the oxidation of sulphides can result in the mobilization
and migration of trace metals from the mining wastes into the
environment, releasing contaminants into the ecosystem. The

posit, will be a major repository for the heavy metals released
being the SFA village the most affected.

ities and to understand the geochemical behaviour of a set of
chemical elements in this mining region, we selected four sam-
pling media (rhizosphere soils, irrigation waters, road dusts and
horticultural plants – Fig. 2). These media constitute the most
important means for the geochemical characterization of the stud-
ied area and also for assessment of the impact of anthropogenic
activities on different ecosystems, including the public health of
the inhabitants. Vegetables and rhizosphere soil samples will de-
fine the extent of soil contamination and the metals transfer pro-
cess from soils to the different parts of the plants once the root
system of the plants remove nutrients from the mineral phases

of the soils. Waters samples will define the influence of soils and
human activities in the quality of potable water, for human con-
sumption and for irrigation. Finally, the road dusts samples allow
quantifying the wind transfer of the contaminants from tailings
and its influence in local soil, vegetables and air quality.

Rhizosphere soil, dusts and vegetables: seventeen rhizosphere soil
samples (RSS) and 14 edible vegetables (VEG), potatoes (Solanum
tubersum sava) and cabbage (Brassica olerácea L.), were collected
(Fig. 2) in polyethylene bags and brought to the laboratory. In this
campaign, thirteen road dusts (RDS) were also collected in the
road, inside the village whenever it was possible in the same place
where soils, vegetables and waters were taken, with a small broom
and stored in polyethylene bags for further analyses. The soil and
dust samples were oven dried, before dry sieving, at a temperature
of 40 ?C, until a constant weight was attained, disaggregated,
passed through a 177 lm aperture plastic sieve and milled for
chemical analysis. The vegetables samples were washed, dried at
a temperature of 40 ?C, disaggregated and finely milled.

Waters: a total of 6 waters samples (UW) were collected in
private houses in S. Francisco de Assis village (Fig. 2). Two of
them were picked from the public water supply network and
the other four from wells used for irrigation. Samples were col-
lected from each selected site using a clean 1-L acid-washed
polyethylene bottle and stored at 4 ?C until analyzed. Values of
pH, electric conductivity (EC), oxidation–reduction potential
(ORP), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and
Salinity (SAL) of the waters were recorded at each site using a
multiparametric probe HI9828 with GPS from HANNA Instru-
ments. Samples were filtered on-site through 0.45-lm Millipore
membrane filters using an all-plastic pressurized filtering
system. The concentrations of HCO3 were determined in situ
by volumetric titration on filtered unacidified samples. Samples
for metal analysis were immediately preserved after collection
in the field, with pH reduction to 2.0 using HNO3, avoiding Fe
hydroxide precipitation. All the water samples were stored at
4 ?C pending further analysis.

3.2. Sample preparation and chemical analysis

Rhizosphere soil, dusts and vegetable samples: the fine grained
fraction of rhizosphere soils dust and vegetables was submitted
to multi-elemental analysis in ACME Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited
Lab-Canada. A 0.5 g split was leached in hot (95 ?C) aqua regia
(HCl–HNO3–H2O) for 1 h. After dilution to 10 ml with demineral-
ized water, the solutions were analyzed by Inductively Coupled
Plasma-Emission Spectrometry (ICP-ES) for 35 chemical elements.
Included in this analytical package were silver (Ag), aluminium
(Al), arsenic (As), gold (Au), barium (Ba), bismuth (Bi), calcium
(Ca), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron
(Fe), gallium (Ga), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), lanthanum (La),
magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), sodium
(Na), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), lead (Pb), sulphur (S), antimony
(Sb), scandium (Sc), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th),
titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), tungsten (W) and zinc (Zn). The accu-
racy and analytical precision were determined using analyses of
reference materials (standards C3 and G-2) and duplicate samples
in each analytical set. The results were within the 95% confidence
limits of the recommended values given for this certified material.
The relative standard deviation was between 5% and 10%.

Soil pH the procedure adopted was modified from ISO
10390:1994 Soil.; the pH was determined with samples in diluted
CaCl2, and measures taken 24 h after.

Soil Organic Matter (SOM): the procedure was adapted from Ree-
uwijk (2002); The SOM was quantified in 5 g dried samples, after
20 h in a 430 ?C muffle.

Mineralogy: the mineral constituents in selected solid media
samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at LNEG. The
mineralogical composition was determined using a Philips X’Pert
MPD machine equipped with Cu Ka radiation, graphite monochro-
mator automatic divergence slit, and 0.5-receiving slit. A step size
of 0.05–2 h, a scan setting of 2–70–2 h, and a 10 s counting time
were chosen.

Waters samples samples were analyzed without pre-concentra-
tion. The analyzed elements include major anions (Cl?, NO?3 , and
SO2?4 ), major cations (Ca, K, Na, and Mg), as well a suite of dissolved
trace elements (Al, As, B, Cd, Cl, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn). Unacidified
samples were analyzed using a Dionex 2000i ion chromatography
and a SPECTRAPHYSICS integrator. The concentrations of major
cations and trace elements in acidified waters were all determined
by mass inductive plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the ACME
Anal. ISO 9002 Accredited Lab-Canada. Reagent blanks and dupli-
cate samples were inserted into each batch for quality control
(Ramsey et al., 1987). Depending on the concentration levels, typ-
ical uncertainties, including all error sources, are less than 6% for
the trace elements, and between 2% and 7% for the major anions.
The limit of detection for the analyzed trace metals is about
0.05–10 mg L?1. In this work As (III) and As (total) were deter-
mined by Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CSV) (Ferreira and Bar-
ros, 2002), using a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). The
method requires hydrogen chloride (HCl) 1 M as electrolyte sup-
port and the presence of Cu (II), as it involves the preconcentration
of a copper–arsenic intermetallic compound at the mercury elec-
trode. The determination of As (T) involves the reduction of As
(V) with thiosulfate and the subsequent determination of As (III);
As (V) is obtained by difference. The Fe (III) concentration is ob-
tained by difference between the concentrations of Fe (T) and Fe
(II), being Fe (II) determined by a colorimetric method and Fe (T)
by another method such AEOS-ICP or AAS after reduction of Fe
(III). In this work, Fe (III), Fe (II) and Fe (T) will be determined by
a colour spectrophotometric-Vis method using FerroZine Iron Re-
agent. The method requires preservation of water samples by fil-
tration through a 0.2 lm membrane and acidification to pH 1
with HCl (0.4%HCl), and storage in the dark (To et al., 1999).

3.3. Data analysis

Enrichment Index one common approach to estimate metal
concentrations is to compute an index that averages the accumula-
tion of each metal in each sample. To evaluate the degree of trace
metal contamination in soils the Enrichment Index (EI) (Ávila et al.,
2008; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Kim et al., 1998; Lee et al.,
1998; Chon et al., 1995; Nishida et al., 1982) was calculated by
averaging the ratios of the elements concentrations (mg kg?1) to
the permissible level (PL). In this study eight elements (As, Cd,
Cu, Mn, Pb, V, W, Zn) were selected to calculate the Ei in each
sample. The PL is the element concentration in the soil, from which
crops produced are considered as unsafe for human health
(As = 20 mg kg?1; Cd = 3 mg kg?1; Cu = 100 mg kg?1; Mn =
394 mg kg?1; Pb = 85 mg kg?1; V = 50 mg kg?1; W = 1 mg kg?1;
Zn = 140 mg.kg?1; Ferreira, 2004; Reimann and De Caritat, 1998;
Kloke, 1979). This index is useful to evaluate the degree of multiple
element contamination. An Enrichment Index over 1.0 indicates
that, on average, metal concentrations are above the permissible
level, though element enrichment may be from anthropogenic
inputs or natural geological sources (Nimick and Moore, 1991).

Total metal concentration in vegetables the total metal content
for each vegetable (TP) was calculated using the following formula:
TP ¼
ðRdw ? RecÞþðSdw ? SecÞþðLdw ? LecÞþðTdw ? TecÞ

Rdw þ Sdw þ Ldw þ Tdw
ð1Þ
where Rdw – Root dry weight; Rec – Root element content; Sdw –
Stem dry weight; Sec – Stem element content; Ldw – Leaves dry
weight; Lec – Leaves element content; Tdw – Tubercle dry weight;
Tec – Tubercle element content.

Estimated daily intake of heavy metals from vegetables: the esti-
mated daily exposure to metals (EDEM) through vegetables is
dependent on metal contents in vegetables, daily vegetable con-
sumption, as well as the body weight. The EDEM was calculated
according the formula.
EDEM ¼
daily intake of metalsðDIMÞ

body weight
ð2Þ
DIM ¼ daily vegetable consumption
? mean vegetable metal concentration ð3Þ
considering the average daily intake of metals present in 345 g of
vegetables per day for adult residents (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA,
1993); the body weight of an adult resident was set to 60 kg in
the present study.

Calculation of health risk: in this study, the health risk associated
with the consumption of vegetables was defined as the ratio of the
estimated daily intake of metals to the reference dose oral (RfDo)
for each metal (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA, 1993), as in the following
equation.
Risk index ¼
EDEM
RfDo

ð4Þ
where RfDo represents safe levels of exposure by oral intake for a
lifetime (JECFA, 1993). If the risk index was less than 1, no obvious
risk is involved. If the risk index was equal to or higher than 1, there
is a potential health risk, and related interventions and protective
measurements should be taken. In the present study, metals/metal-
loids concerned were As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, and only the chronic
risk RfDo was considered in the risk assessments (Luo et al., 2011).

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Geochemical characterization of S. Francisco de Assis village

4.1.1. Rhizosphere soils
Previous study carried out in the area by the same team (Cande-

ias et al., 2012), determined the contents of selected elements in
soils samples, collected in two depths, from superficial soil (A)
and from a depth of 15–20 cm (B). Superficial soil samples allowed
the characterization of superficial contamination coming from the
tailings, while B soil samples makes possible the establishment of
the local geochemical background. To evaluate the presence of pos-
sible local anomalies, the mean, median and maximum contents of
the rhizosphere soils were compared with the results obtained for
the horizon B.

Table 2 presents the median values of pH and SOM in soil sam-
ples. The rhizosphere soils shows a median pH of 6.3 and are clas-
sified according to the United States Department of Agriculture
(www.nrcs.usda.gov) as slightly acid (6.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.5) while the
geogenic soils from horizon B (median pH = 4.2) are classified as
acidic soils (3.5 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;4.4). The SOM present median values of
12.2% in rhizosphere soils and 10.2% in horizon B soils, showing
that these soils are medium organic soils with 10% &amp;lt;SOM &amp;lt;30%
(Perrin, 1974).

Soil pH and SOM strongly affect soil functions and plant nutri-
ent availability. Specifically, pH influences chemical solubility
and availability of plant essential nutrients, pesticide performance,
and organic matter decomposition. SOM serves multiple functions

in the soil, including nutrient storage and soil aggregation
(McCauley et al., 2009).

From the analysis of Table 2, it is also possible to conclude
that As, Ba, Cu, Mn, Sr, and Zn show large variations in mean,
median and maximum values. For all these elements, the
difference between both kinds of samples clearly shows that there
are higher contents in rhizosphere soils when compared with local
geochemical background. The behaviour of the elements in the
rhizosphere soils may reflect the influence of the Barroca Grande
tailings and open impoundments, due to wind dispersion and
deposition.

According to Ávila et al. (2008), the Barroca Grande tailings and
open impoundments have high As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sn, W, and Zn con-
centrations (mean content in the more coarse tailings material
As = 7142 mg kg?1; Cd = 56 mg kg?1; Cu = 2501 mg kg?1; Pb =
172 mg kg?1; Sn = 679 mg kg?1; W = 5400 mg kg?1 and Zn =
1689 mg kg?1 and mean content in the impoundment material
(rejected from the mill operations) As = 44,252 mg kg?1; Cd =
491 mg kg?1; Cu = 4029 mg kg?1; Pb = 166 mg kg?1; Sn = 454 mg

of these tailings is mainly quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, illite–mont-
morilonite, montmorilonite–vermiculite, and chlorite, and also
arsenopyrite, wolframite, and natrojarosite The dam in Barroca
Grande may pose a significant potential threat due to the fine-
grained nature of the materials and its location with respect to
the Casinhas stream that cross SFA village. The XRD analysis of
the impoundment material revealed the presence of scorodite,
arsenopyrite, quartz, sphalerite, hematite, and muscovite. These

tailings and impoundment material are metal-enriched at a level
likely to be toxic to the ecosystem (Ávila et al., 2008).

The coexistence of wolframite, cassiterite, sulphides, carbon-
ates, and silicates is responsible for the peculiar behaviour in the
tailings surface environment. Weathering of sulphide-rich materi-
als results in AMD at the Panasqueira mine. During runoff events,
rain water infiltrates the tailings and dissolves secondary minerals,
producing strongly acidic water (pH 3.0 Ávila et al., 2008). The low
pH keeps the trace elements dissolved and increases remobiliza-
tion and spatial distribution. This scenario leads to the high con-
tents of metals verified in the village agricultural soils, some of
them with acid pH and others near neutral pH (5.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.9).
According to McCauley et al. (2009) acid conditions occur in soil
having parent material high in silica, high levels of sand with low
buffering capacities (ability to resist pH change), and in regions
with high amounts of precipitation. An increase in precipitation
causes increased leaching of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+)
and the soil pH is lowered. Acidic soils are most commonly found
in areas where soils were formed from siliceous parental material,
forest soils, mining sites containing pyrite (McCauley et al., 2009).

Considering that the sampling area is located in an inhabited
village and that the local population strongly depends on the use
of soil for their subsistence (agriculture, cattle breeding and for-
estry), it is useful to compare the As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo,
Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn concentrations in soil with the reference values
proposed by the Ontario Soil Quality Guidelines (Ministry of the
Environment, 2011) and also with the national median concentra-
tions proposed by Ferreira (2004) (Table 3).

According to these values, the soils from SFA exceed, for exam-
ple, for As twenty times the Ontario reference value for agricultural
soils (11 mg kg?1) and 10 times the national median concentra-
tions (22 mg kg?1) proposed by Ferreira (2004). The estimated EI
values for soils are elevated ranging from 1.0 to 12.2 (Fig. 3),
mainly due to the presence of significant contents of As, Cu and
also Cd and Pb. Comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that
the majority of the samples exceed the severe effect level for As
and Cu (100% of samples), Cd (50% of samples), Pb (53% of samples)
and Zn (47% of samples) and so are deemed ‘‘grossly polluted’’.

According to Ferreira da Silva et al. (2013) the high levels of As
in these soils seems to be linked to sulphides, since a considerable
proportion is extracted by aqua regia (F4 – 66.7–68.4%). This high
percentage associated with sulphides reflects the presence of arse-
nopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn
oxyhydroxides (F3) seems to be also important metal bearing-
phases. The percentage of easily mobilized phases is very low
(0.04–0.05%); however, the As concentrations associated with this
extraction values (0.4–0.7 mg kg?1) may be considered very high.
Also according the same author Cd, Cu and Pb show high (and sim-

ments was extracted with aqua regia in both samples, suggesting
that these elements may also be linked, to some extent, to sulphide
or clay minerals. It was also shown that Cd (10.3–13.9% of extrac-
tion, 1.9–4 mg kg?1 for Cd) was also extracted to a great extent
with sodium acetate indicating that the soluble/exchangeable/car-
bonate fraction is probably a preferential sink for Cd.

These elements (As, Cd or Pb, for example) are the most toxic for
humans, as well as for animals and can even lead to death if in-
gested in large doses, or over large periods of time. Exposure to
hazardous elements may have different pathways, being one of
them the ingestion of vegetables grown on contaminated soils.
4.1.2. Road dusts
Road dust originated from the interaction of solid, liquid and

gaseous materials are produced from different sources and depos-
ited on a road. The composition and quantity of chemical matrix of
road dust are indicators of environmental pollution (Banerjee,
2003). Road dust receives varying inputs of heavy metals from
diversity of mobile or stationary sources such as vehicles emis-
sions, industrial plants, power generation plants, oil burning, waste
incineration, construction and demolition activities as well as
resuspension of surrounding contaminated soils (Ahmed and Ishi-
ga, 2006; Al-Khashman, 2007; Atiemo et al., 2011). These inputs
contribute significantly to the pollution of urban environment. This
makes the study of road dust important for determining the origin,
distribution and level of heavy metal in urban surface environ-
ments. Elevated levels of heavy metal contents are the result of hu-
man activities and as a result, the adverse effects of poor
environmental conditions on human health are most evident in
the affected environments.

Exposure to heavy metals in road dust can occur by means of
ingestion through vegetables that grow near roads, inhalation
and dermal contact. The adverse effects of heavy metals in road
dust include respiratory system disorders, nervous system inter-
ruptions, endocrine system malfunction, immune system suppres-
sion and the risk of cancer in later life (Ferreira-Baptista and De
Miguel, 2005).

Most mining and quarrying wastes obtained from grinding of
rocks are placed in deposits in specific locations/regions and can
be reused in earthworks and construction, in particular the coarser
fractions. Typical applications include use in asphalt pavements. In
the SFA area, the main concern focuses on dust associated with
mining operations due to vehicles moving at the top of the Barroca
Grande tailings deposit to load the coarse rejected materials from
the mining exploration (Fig. 4).

The statistical parameters calculated from the ‘‘total’’ contents
of the road dust samples are shown in Table 4.

From Table 4 it was notice that some elements have a strong
positive asymmetry, due to the presence of ‘‘outliers’’, namely,
Ag, As, Au, Ca, Cd, Hg, Mo, Na, Pb, S, Sb, Se and Zn (with values
above 1.5). Most of these elements present mean values signifi-
cantly higher than their median values. Nevertheless, it is impor-
tant to emphasize the most critical elements in contamination
terms and as potential hazardous elements. For example, As rang-
ing between 61.9 mg kg?1 and 3564.9 mg kg?1; Cd from a mini-
mum of 0.3 mg kg?1 and a maximum of 19.4 mg kg?1 and Cu
between 51.6 mg kg?1 and 766.0 mg kg?1, poses a severe danger
for the village inhabitants affecting their health once these dust
lay down in soils, vegetables and animals drinking water.

Once again, it is useful to compare the dust contents with refer-
ence values and acceptable risk values. For a better understanding

of the metals behaviour in dust samples, this study only focuses on
toxic elements. Table 5 shows, according to Sezgin et al. (2003), the
reference values range, acceptable risk values, and maximum
acceptable values and, for comparison, the mean, median and max-
imum value determined in S. Francisco de Assis (SFA) road dust
samples.

From Table 5, it is obvious that the collected dusts, clearly, ex-
ceed the reference values range, acceptable risk values as also the
maximum acceptable values for, at least, As, Cd, Cu and Zn. For a
better visualization, Fig. 5 shows the cartography of the As, Cd
and Cu road dust contents according the reference values presents
in Table 5.

These high contents are caused by a great wind dispersion
mechanism in this area (see Table 1). According to these results

it would be advisable the close monitoring of dust that are carried
by the winds from the Barroca Grande tailing and implementing a
form of mitigation to prevent its deposition in urban areas (in that
case in SFA village). Indeed As, by its toxicity, may have chronic
health effects that may be local or systemic. The lung cancer is re-
garded as the most critical effect that results from inhalation of
particles of Arsenic (WHO, 2000). Cadmium when present in the
atmosphere and in food can cause severe kidney problems. More-
over the dispersion of Pb existing in dust, if particles are at an in-
haled size e.g. PM10 and PM2.5, could be worrying, especially for
children, primarily due to blood diseases which become frequent
when humans are exposed to this element (WHO, 2000).
4.1.3. Waters
In SFA the local population strongly depends on the use of water

(water supply and agriculture), nevertheless most of the inhabit-
ants use the public supply network. In the study area, we chose
to perform the collection of water samples in private wells
(UW4, UW6, UW7) one sample (UW5) was collected in a little
stream (Barroco) and for comparison two samples (UW1, UW8)
from public supply network, all of these waters are used for vege-
tables irrigation (Table 6).

According to the results, the lowest pH values were recorded in
samples collected in wells (UW4, UW6 and UW7) having a slightly
acidic character, according to the parametric values set out in the
Decree-Law 306/2007 with values between 6.5 and 9.0. The other
samples have circumneutral pH. The measured values electric con-
ductivity ranging from 18 to 161 lS cm?1 classifies them as waters
with very low mineralization, according to the parametric values
set out in the Decree-Law 306/2007 with values up to
2500 lS cm?1. These samples have lower SO2?4 and Cl

? concentra-
tions but major ions contents tend to increase with the decrease of
pH. Have also low metal concentrations, sometimes Zn and Mn
were present in significant concentrations though below the stan-
dard parametric values. The concentrations of other elements were
all legally acceptable.

Fig. 6 shows the samples representation in a Piper’s diagram.
Two distinct hydrochemical facies were determined: (a) UW1,
UW8 from public network supply, UW5 from Barroco stream and
the well UW6 are Ca/Mg–HCO3 waters, and (b) UW4 and UW7 col-
lected in private wells have a closer facies to the type Ca/Mg–Cl/
SO4 waters.

Comparing the obtained results from the collected samples
with the Portuguese criteria values of quality of surface fresh water
for human consumption and irrigating waters (Decree-Law 306/
2007), all the analyzed waters in SFA village are in perfect condi-
tions to be used by the population.

Nevertheless, and because As is a toxic element and because
arsenopyrite is the main sulphide rejected in Panasqueira mine,
As and also Fe have been object of chemical speciation according

4.1.4. Vegetables
Many heavy metals exist in minute amounts in natural agricul-

tural soil, however when their amounts exceed a certain level due
to pollutants brought from outside, soil contamination occurs and
agricultural products become contaminated so the consumption of
locally produced vegetables may be an important exposure path-
way for soil contaminants due to agricultural land use. Prolonged
exposure to heavy metals can cause deleterious health effects in
humans. Hence, prediction of metal and metalloid uptake by veg-
etables from contaminated soils is an important part of the Human
health risk assessment.

Given the high contents, of some metals/metalloids, that were
recorded in the soils as well as in the road dusts and the fact that
most inhabitants have a diet rich in vegetables, we attempted to

study the relationship between the metals/metalloids contents of
the rhizosphere soils and vegetables. Two species were analyzed,
S. tubersum sava (potato) and B. olerácea L. (cabbage). For each sam-
ple it was calculated the total content of the elements according to
equation (1), taking into consideration the different parts of each
vegetable. Trace elements concentrations found in vegetables were
summarized in Table 8.

Analysis of the results shows that the concentration of some po-
tential hazardous elements ranges from 0.8–14.4 mg kg?1 for As;
0.1–0.1 mg kg?1 for Cd; 3.7–19.6 mg kg?1 for Cu; 21–
270.2 mg kg?1 Mn, 0.2–4.2 mg kg?1 Pb and 35–176.6 mg kg?1 Zn.
Data also show that element uptake is different in both studied
species, the highest concentrations of As, Pb, Zn and Mn accumula-
tion were found in cabbages, while potatoes concentrate more Cd
and Cu.

Comparing the obtained results of the metal/metalloids con-
tents in vegetables with the guidelines for vegetables proposed
by FAO/WHO (As = 0.1 mg kg?1, Cd = 0.1 mg kg?1, Cu = 73 mg kg?1,
Pb = 0.2 mg kg?1, Zn = 100 mg kg?1, Mn = 500 mg kg?1) it is possi-
ble to say that As, Cd and Pb contents are above the maximum al-
lowed level for vegetables while Cu, Zn and Mn contents are below
the guidelines for maximum allowed metals in vegetables. On the
whole, all vegetables that were studied were contaminated by ar-
senic, cadmium and lead and they are toxic if continually con-
sumed. Consumption of heavy metals-contaminated food can
seriously deplete some essential nutrients in the body causing a
decrease in immunological protection, intrauterine growth retar-
dation, impaired psycho-social behaviour, disabilities associated
with malnutrition and a high prevalence of upper gastrointestinal
cancer (Arora et al., 2008).

Table 9 and 10 presents the concentrations distributed by the
different components (T – tubercles, L – leaves, S – stems and R
– Roots) of the two studied species S. tubersum sava and B. olerácea
L.

The results obtained for the different component of the studied
vegetable shows that: (a) for potatoes the roots contained maxi-
mum As (21.9 mg kg?1) followed by leaves (12.5 mg kg?1) and tu-
bers (3.5 mg kg?1) (Table 9); (b) for cabbages the roots contained
maximum As (52.3 mg kg?1) followed by leaves (2.9 mg kg?1) (Ta-
ble 10). Despite the edible parts of vegetables, potatoes tubers and
cabbage leaves have the lowest As contents, these contents are
above the maximum permitted level for vegetables proposed by
FAO/WHO (2012) guidelines (0.1 mg kg?1). As for Cd, the higher
concentration in potatoes is found in roots (4.66 mg kg?1) and in
tubers (0.52 mg kg?1) both above the FAO/WHO (2012) guidelines
for Cd (0.1 mg kg?1) and for leaves cabbages Cd have a maximum
concentration of 0.43 mg kg?1 and for cabbages, the roots also have
the highest Cd contents (0.56 mg kg?1), again both above the max-
imum limit considered by the FAO/WHO guidelines. Due to the
high contents of exchangeable Cd in vegetable soils, the Cd in the
edible parts of vegetables probably came from the root uptake
from soils.

Copper is below the maximum limit regarding the FAO/WHO,
2012 guidelines (73 mg kg?1) in all parts of the plant of both veg-
etables, and the same pattern is observed for Zn (max limit permis-
sible 100 mg kg?1) in the potatoes but some cabbages have
concentrations above the permissible limit. Nevertheless Cu re-
veals a preferential accumulation in the leaves and roots in the
potatoes and Zn cumulates in the stems, and in cabbages Cu pre-
fers to cumulate in roots and Zn also in the roots.

Metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) are very tightly bound to the soil
at high pH and are therefore more available at low pH levels than
high pH levels. In addition to the effects of pH on nutrient availabil-
ity, individual plants and soil organisms also vary in their tolerance
to alkaline and/or acid soil conditions. Neutral conditions appear to
be best for crop growth. As it stated above in rhizosfere soils dis-
cussion, the pH of the sampled soils ranged 5.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;6.9 which
is the considered pH range more favourable for micronutrients
availability.

According to Eqs. (2) and (3), an index of the risk for residents,
due to the ingestion of these metals/metalloids, by consuming veg-
etables grown around the sampling area was calculated on the ba-
sis of the oral reference dose being 0.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for As,
0.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for Cd, 40 lg kg?1 d?1 for Cu, 3.5 lg kg?1 d?1 for
Pb, and 300 lg kg?1 d?1 for Zn (Luo et al., 2011; JECFA, 1993).

According to Table 11 the risk index, in descending order is
Cd &amp;lt;As &amp;lt;Pb &amp;lt;Cu &amp;lt;Zn, and for Cd, As and Pb is higher than 1, while
the risk indexes for Cu, and Zn were less than 1. The result indi-
cates that the inhabitants of SFA village probably are exposed to
some potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also
Pb via consuming their vegetables. The accumulation of metals in
the edible parts of vegetables could have a direct impact on the
health of nearby inhabitants, because vegetables produced from
gardens are mostly consumed locally. For Cu and Zn, there is no
significant risk from the intake of vegetables. According to Luo

the intake is equal to the absorbed dose (USEPA, 1989), which may
magnify the effect of the ingested contaminants to some extent,
because part of the heavy metals that were ingested maybe egest-
ed. From this point of view, it is reasonable to think that no obvious
adverse health effects from exposure to the heavy metals could be
observed on those living in the village.

According to Luo et al. (2011) and comparing the results with
other studies (Table 12), the health risk for adults from consuming
vegetables in this region is comparable to, or even higher than
those associated with the consumption of vegetables from gardens
impacted by mining, wastewater, irrigation or smelting activities.

For soil–plant system, heavy metal toxicity threshold is the
highest permissible content in the soil (total or bioavailable con-
centration) that does not pose any phytotoxic effects or heavy met-
als in the edible parts of the crops does not exceed food hygiene
standards (Islam et al., 2007). The factors that affect the thresholds
of heavy metal toxicity in soil–vegetable system include the soil
type (soil pH, organic matter content, clay mineral and other soil
chemical and biochemical properties) and the vegetable species,
the transport and heavy metal accumulation in each plant. Also
the interactions between soils, the plant roots and microbes play
an important role regarding the heavy metal movement from soil
to the edible parts of crops (Islam et al., 2007). These are issues that
can affect bioavailability and heavy metals accumulation in vegeta-
bles, subject for a further investigation.

5. Conclusions

The mining and beneficiation process at Panasqueira mine pro-
duces mine wastes that are largely responsible for the high levels
of metals/metalloids at the Barroca Grande tailings, releasing con-
siderable amounts of heavy metals and metalloids in the surround-
ing soils and water. The metal assemblage identified in the
rhizosphere soils collected in S. Francisco de Assis village, down-
stream Barroca Grande tailings deposit, and its behaviour may re-
flect the influence of the tailings and open impoundments
materials, due to several dispersion agents, including the wind,
and deposition in soils, vegetables and animals drinking water as
also in little creeks used for irrigation. These soils exceed, for
example, for As 20 times the Ontario reference value for agricul-
tural soils (11 mg kg?1) and the estimated values for Enrichment

Index are elevated ranging (1.0 &amp;lt;EI &amp;lt;12.2) mainly due to the pres-
ence of As, Cu and also Cd and Pb. The high levels of As in these
soils seems to be linked to sulphides extracted by aqua regia and
this association to sulphides reflects the presence of arsenopyrite
in soils. The comparison to the Ontario guidelines indicates that
these soils are deemed as ‘‘grossly polluted’’. Also the road dusts
analyzed exceed the reference acceptable risk and the maximum
acceptable values for As, Cd, Cu and Zn and these contents results
from a wind dispersion mechanism with a great expression in this
area. If particles are at an inhaled size e.g. PM10 and PM2.5, could be
very worrying. Regarding the sampled waters, some have slightly
acidic character and the others have circumneutral pH, they have
very low mineralization (electric conductivity range from 18 to
161 lS cm?1) and low SO2?4 and Cl

? concentrations but major ions
contents tend to increase with the decrease of pH. Metal and met-
alloid concentrations are also low and, according the Portuguese
law, legally acceptable.

Vegetables grown in the nearby sites were also contaminated,
in one way, for potatoes there is a preferential accumulation in
the roots and leaves while for the cabbage most elements have a
preferential accumulation in the roots and, in another way, As,
Cd and Pb concentrations are above the maximum permitted level
for vegetables proposed by FAO/WHO, which could be a potential
health concern to local residents. The risk index for residents deter-
mined, due to the ingestion of the metals and metalloids, reveal
that Cd, As and Pb represents an hazard for the inhabitants of S.
Francisco de Assis village, once they are probably exposed to some
potential health risks through the intake of As, Cd and also Pb
trough the of ingesting these metals, by consuming vegetables
grown in their yards.

This research requires further studies to establish the metals
transfer process from soil to the different parts of the plants, to
understand their bioavailability and to identify the bioaccumula-
tion patterns based in indicators as Biological Absorption Coeffi-
cient for each element.

Abstract Through the years, mining and beneficiation pro-
cesses produces large amounts of As-rich mine wastes laid
up in huge tailings and open-air impoundments (Barroca
Grande and Rio tailings) that are the main source of pollu-
tion in the surrounding area once they are exposed to the
weathering conditions leading to the formation of AMD and
consequently to the contamination of the surrounding envi-
ronments, in particularly soils. In order to investigate the
environmental contamination impact on S. Francisco de
Assis (village located between the two major impoundments
and tailings) agricultural soils, a geochemical survey was
undertaken to assess toxic metals associations, related levels
and their spatial distribution, and to identify the possible
contamination sources. According to the calculated conta-
mination factor, As and Zn have a very high contamination
factor giving rise to 65.4 % of samples with a moderate to
high pollution degree; 34.6 % have been classified as nil to
very low pollution degree. The contamination factor spatial
distribution put in evidence the fact that As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and
Zn soils contents, downstream Barroca Grande tailing, are
increased when compared with the local Bk soils. The

mechanical dispersion, due to erosion, is the main contam-
ination source. The chemical extraction demonstrates that
the trace metals distribution and accumulation in S.
Francisco de Assis soils is related to sulfides, but also to
amorphous or poorly crystalline iron oxide phases. The
partitioning study allowed understanding the local chemical
elements mobility and precipitation processes, giving rise to
the contamination dispersion model of the study area. The
wind and hydrological factors are responsible for the chem-
ical elements transport mechanisms, the water being the
main transporter medium and soils as one of the possible
retention media.

Introduction

Metal mining processing and smelting have been recognized
as a major contributor to environmental pollution, providing
sources of heavy metals that may lead to the contamination of
the surrounding environment (Adriano 1986; Benvenuti et al.
1995; Gray 1997; Liu et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2007). High
concentrations of heavy metals can be found in and around
abandoned and active mines due to the discharge and disper-
sion of mine waste materials into nearby soils, food crops, and
stream sediments (Lee et al. 2001; Jung 2001; McKenzie and
Pulford 2002; Witte et al. 2004). This will eventually lead to a
loss of biodiversity, amenity, and economic well being, and a
potential health risk to residents in the vicinity of the mining
area may occur (Verner and Ramsey 1996; Lee et al. 2001;
Wong et al. 2002; Galán et al. 2003).

At present, management of contaminated soils is a major
issue, which may have serious consequences. Numerous

chemical compounds, organic and inorganic, are usually
toxic and so it becomes necessary to assess their adverse
impacts on human health and on the environment. Also, the
extent and magnitude of the risk posed by such chemicals,
and what cleanup goals are required for such soils, is a
matter of concern.

Metals (and metalloids) such as arsenic (As), cadmi-
um (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), or mercury (Hg) are
among the most toxic for humans, especially for chil-
dren (as well as for animals), and can even lead to
death if ingested in large doses or over large periods
of time. Exposure to these harmful elements may have
different pathways, either indirect, through the ingestion
of vegetables grown in contaminated soils or direct
ingestion of soil (geophagy; Ellickson et al. 2001).
Geophagy includes dust inhalation and dust ingestion,
fueled by its adherence to hands and plants, which may
reach human’s mouth. This issue leads to exposure to
immobile or weakly mobile metals that otherwise would
not pose any kind of risk to humans or animals.

These complex sets of processes can be illustrated
with the case study of the active Panasqueira mine. The
Panasqueira hydrothermal mineralization, located geo-
graphically in the municipalities of Covilhã and
Fundão (Castelo Branco district, Central Portugal;
Fig. 1a) is the biggest Sn-W deposit of Western
Europe and has been in operation since 1896 to the
present date (Smith 2006).

The paragenesis is complex; nevertheless, four stages of
mineral formation are generally accepted by most of the
authors who have studied this deposit: (1) oxide silicate
phase [quartz, wolframite, and cassiterite]; (2) main sulfide
phase [pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphalerite, AND
chalcopyrite]; (3) pyrrothite alteration phase [marcasite, sid-
erite, galena, and Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts]; (4) late carbonate
phase [dolomite and calcite] (Breiter 2001; Corrêa de Sá et
al. 1999; Correa and Naique 1998; Noronha et al. 1992;
Cavey and Gunning 2006). At Panasqueira, more than 65
minerals including sulfides, sulphosalts, oxides, carbonates,
silicates, phosphates, and tungstates minerals have been
identified (Kelly and Rye 1979).

The mining and beneficiation processes at the site pro-
duces metal-rich mine wastes, being Barroca Grande?
7 Mm3 with two mud dams?1.2 Mm3 (one of these dams
still active while the older one is deactivate) one of the main
deposits in the mine area. According to Ávila et al. (2008),
the rejected materials from the ore processing, containing
high concentrations of metals, are stored in the open-air
impoundments. Barroca Grande impoundment shows high
concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, and Zn (Ávila et al. 2008; e-
Ecorisk 2007). The unconfined tailings and open impound-
ments are the main source of pollution in the surrounding
area once the oxidation of sulfides can result in the

mobilization and migration of trace metals from the mining
wastes into the environment, releasing contaminants into the
ecosystem. The effect of Panasqueira mining activities and
the metals release from acid mine waters to ground waters
and stream sediments is dynamic and actual. Soils, down-
stream Barroca Grande tailing, will be a major repository for
the heavy metals released with the S. Francisco de Assis
village the most affected.

In this paper, the environmental contamination impact
on S. Francisco de Assis (SFA) agricultural and urban
soils due to the mining activities is investigated. The
objectives of the study are (a) to assess the levels of
soil contamination in respect to average concentrations
of toxic metals in the region, (b) to determine the
associations between the different toxic elements and
their spatial distribution, and (c) to identify possible
sources of contamination that can explain the spatial
patterns of soil pollution in the SFA.

Materials and methods

Field sampling

The soil sampling collection was established according the
site-specific characteristics. In the study area, the soil is
mostly an incipient and lithic soil derived from a metasedi-
ments substrate (cambisols), and therefore the depth of
sampling was set to a maximum of 10 cm to guarantee that
all samples could be collected at the same conditions. A
total of 75 soil samples were collected downstream Barroca
Grande tailing (SFA1 to SFA75; Fig. 1b and c) in the
vicinity of SFA. To establish the local geochemical back-
ground, 20 unaffected soil samples (SoBK1 to SoBK20;
Fig. 1b) were also collected outside of the contaminated
area (Casegas area). All samples have been georeferenced
to Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates. Soil samples
were dried at 40 °C in an oven, homogenized and sieved
through a&amp;lt;200 mesh screen in order to prepare them for
chemical analysis.

Sample chemical analysis

The&amp;lt;200 mesh soil fractions were submitted to multiele-
mental analysis in the S. Mamede de Infesta (LNEG)
accredited lab. For trace metal analysis, a 0.5 g split was
leached in hot (95 °C) aqua regia (HCl-HNO3-H2O) for 1 h.
After dilution to 10 ml with water, the solutions were
analyzed for 22 chemical elements by conductive plasma
emission spectrometry (Ag, As, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu,
Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, V, Y, and Zn ) and X-ray (Sn,
W). The detection limits were based on three times the
standard deviation of a blank reagent that was analyzed

ten times. Accuracy and analytical precision were deter-
mined using analyses of reference materials (SO1, SO2,
SO3, SO4, FER1, FER2, FER3, FER4 from Canadian
Centre of Mineral and Energy Technology; PACS-1
from NRS26 CNRC; 2711 from NIST) and duplicate
samples in each analytical set. The results were within
the 95 % confidence limits of the recommended values
given for this certified material. The relative standard
deviation was between 5 and 10 %.

Mineralogical studies

The mineralogical characterization in selected soil samples
included: (1) reflected and light optical microscope identi-
fication and (2) X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips
difractometer (model X’Pert). Working conditions were au-
tomatic divergence slit, Cu K? monochromatic radiation,
graphite monochromator, 20 mA and 40 kV. Samples were
run at a speed of 0.05° 2?/min (2–70°). The mineral

constituents (including efflorescence) were identified by X-
ray diffraction at LNEG.

Selective chemical extraction procedure

The fine-grained fraction (&lt;200 mesh) of two represen-
tative samples (SFA3 and SFA18) was submitted to
sequential chemical extraction (SCE) procedure in
ACTLABS (Ontario, Canada), accredited under ISO
9001 and 9002. Reagents were applied sequentially
according to their chemical aggressivity. The extractable
fractions were obtained by extraction with different sol-
utions: (a) F1—sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH5) for ex-
traction of exchangeable cations adsorbed by clay and
those soluble in water or in slightly acidic conditions
and coprecipitated by carbonates (the most labile bond-
ed and therefore the most dangerous and bioavailable
for the environment); (b) F2—cold hydroxylamine for
extracting amorphous Fe oxides and crystalline Mn
oxides (metals bound to Fe and Mn oxides that can
be released if conditions change from oxic to anoxic
state); (c) F3—hot hydroxylamine for extraction of
amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides and crystalline
Mn oxides; (d) F4—aqua regia, for leach sulfide species
(metals which may be released under oxidizing condi-
tions) and clay minerals; (e) F5—four acids digestion
(or total attack) where metals strongly associated with
crystalline structures of minerals (such as the remaining
silicates) will be decomposed (they are therefore unlike-
ly to be released).

The recovery of the sequential extraction procedure
for Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, W,
and Zn was calculated (Eq. 1) by comparing the sum of
the five fractions from the SCE with the total amount
obtained after hot mixed acid attack of the same sample
as follows:

Recovery %ð Þ¼ F1 þ F2 þ F3 þ F4 þ F5ð Þ=total concentration½ ?? 100

ð1Þ

For all elements, the total of the trace elements in the
different fractions did not exceed ±10 % of the bulk sample
which is accepted as satisfactory (Tessier et al. 1979;
Pickering 1986; Yan et al. 1999).

The relative extraction ratio (RER) was also calculated
(Eq. 2) by the ratio between the element concentration
extracted by the individual leaching (CIL) procedure and
the concentration extracted by total attack (CTA; Son and
Jung 2011) as follow:

Relative extraction ratio %ð Þ

Data analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) and correspondence
analysis (CA) In this study, PCA was performed to decrease
the dimension of the space where variables are projected
(Einax and Soldt 1999; Massart and Kaufman 1983). The
number of significant principal components for interpreta-
tion was selected on the basis of the Kaiser criterion, which
consists of retaining those factors where eigenvalue is
higher than 1 (Davis 1986; Manly 1994) and gives rise to
a total of explained variance equal or higher than 70 %.

Once identified, the contaminant group of elements as-
sociated with ore exploitation and processing, a complete
disjunctive matrix of the data was built classifying each
sample, for each element according to a set of rules. If a
sample value is below the average value of local back-
ground (Casegas soils), the sample is considered clean (the
label of the element contains a C). If the sample is above
literature guideline values for agriculture purposes, it is
considered to require a sort of remediation/reclamation
(the label of the element contains an R). On the other hand,
if sample value is between average local background and
guideline value, it is considered to be in need of interven-
tion, i.e., further investigation is required (the label of the
element contains an I). Regarding guideline values for
Portuguese agricultural soils, Ferreira (2004) established
the following limits: As=30 mgkg?1, Co=40 mgkg?1, Cu=
100 mgkg?1, Ni=75 mgkg?1, and Zn=300 mgkg?1. These
values were used as the lower limit of a soil requiring recla-
mation. For Be (4 mgkg?1), Cd (4 mgkg?1), and Pb (70 mg
kg?1), the limits used were the ones established by the
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME;
1999) guidelines for agriculture soils, even though these limits
do not refer specifically to Portuguese soils. Neither Ferreira
(2004) nor CCME (1999) present guideline values for Y, Sn,
and W, and so only two categories were established for such
elements: inferior or superior to average local background (the
last case being considered as requiring further investigation).
The referred complete disjunctive matrix was then submitted
to a CA. Since CA allows to project variables and samples in
the same factorial space (Greenacre 1984), it is possible to
extract a hierarchy of samples according to their contamina-
tion level. PCA and CA analysis were performed using Andad
(v.7.12) software (Andad 2000).

Spatial estimation In order to produce maps of spatial dis-
tribution of chemical elements concentrations and contami-
nation factors, a variographic study followed by ordinary
kriging (OK) was performed (Goovaerts 1997; Wackernagel
1998). Variograms were constructed and modeled with
geoMS software (geoMS 2000), the estimation, by ordinary
kriging, was also performed with geoMS software. Maps
were produced with ArcGis (v. 9.3) software.

Enrichment index calculation In order to evaluate the degree
of trace metal contamination in soils, an enrichment index
(Nishida et al. 1982; Chon et al. 1995; Kim et al. 1998;
Ferreira da Silva E et al. 2005) was computed by averaging
the ratios of the element concentration (in milligram per
kilogram) to the median values of the background samples.

Contamination factor and modified degree of contamination
This is based on the calculation for each pollutant of a
contamination factor (Cf; Hakanson 1980). Cf (Eq. 3) is
the ratio obtained by dividing the mean concentration of
each metal in the soil (Ci) by the baseline or background
value of the specific metal (Cb; Liu et al. 2005):

Cf¼ Ci=Cb and Cd ¼
X

Cf is defined according to four categories as follows (Liu et
al. 2005): Cf&lt;1—low contamination factor; 1&lt;Cf&amp;lt;3—
moderate contamination factor; 3&lt;Cf&amp;lt;6—considerable
contamination factor; Cf&gt;6—very high contamination
factor.

Abrahim and Parker (2008) presented a modified and
generalized form of the Hakanson (1980) equation for the
calculation of the overall degree of contamination as below
(Eq. 4).

where:n=number of analyzed elements and i=ith element
(or pollutant) and Cf=contamination factor.

For the classification and description of the modified de-
gree of contamination (mCd) in soil, the following gradations
are proposed: mCd&lt;1.5—nil to very low degree of contami-
nation; 1.5&lt;mCd&lt;2—low degree of contamination; 2&lt;mCd
&lt;4—moderate degree of contamination; 4&lt;mCd&lt;8—high
degree of contamination; 8&lt;mCd&lt;16—very high degree of
contamination; 16&lt;mCd&lt;32—extremely high degree of con-
tamination; mCd&gt;32—ultrahigh degree of contamination
(Abrahim and Parker 2008).

Results and discussion

Basic statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics for the aqua regia extracted fraction of
Ag, As, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, P,
Pb, Sb, Sn, V, W, Y, and Zn for both SFA and Casegas soils
are given in Table 1. According to the results, it can be
noticed that SFA shows higher mean values for As, Ag, As,
B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Sn, W, Y, and Zn when
compared to Casegas values (Table 1).

Comparing the results for both areas, there are some
elements that stand out due to differences in its contents.
The maximum value of As is 24 times bigger in SFA soils
than in Casegas soil samples. The same occurs for other
elements, such as: Cd (16.5×), Co (16.9×), Cu (14×), Mn
(37.5×), Sn (15×), and W (42×). Soil samples of SFA are
enriched with As, Cd, Cu, Mn, and Zn by comparison to
reference values for world unpolluted soils (Table 1), while
Casegas soils contain low concentrations of As, Cu, Mn, Pb,
Sb, and Zn. According to Reimann and De Caritat (1998)
and Deschamps et al. (2002), As, Cd, Cu, and Zn mean
concentrations in world unpolluted top soils are 5, 0.3, 25,
and 70 mgkg?1, respectively, while the respective mean
values for soils of the SFA are 118, 2.2, 122, and 388 mg
kg?1. Also, the same elements exceed the mean values
proposed for Portuguese soils (MPS, Table 1), the values
proposed for cambisols (Table 1) and podzols (Table 1;
Ferreira 2004).

PCA analysis and geochemical interpretation

A matrix of 95 (samples)×22 (chemical elements) was
submitted to a PCA giving rise to the extraction of six
principal components which explains 84.81 % of the total
variance (Table 2). The first two factorial planes (Fig. 2)
account for 67.13 % of total variance and explain all varia-
bles with exception of P, associated with the negative PC4
(?0.6166, loading value; see Table 2) and Mo, associated
with the positive semi-axis 6 (0.5810, loading value; see
Table 2).

The plot of the PCA results (Fig. 2) show the position of
the selected 22 variables coordinates, representing the cor-
relation coefficients between them in the different factorial
plans. Four groups of variables can be identified in the two
most important factorial plans.

The first factorial plan (PC1/PC2) contains 57.63 % of the
global information of the dataset. The PC1, which explains
43.38 % (Table 2) of the total variance is associated to Cu, Y,
Co, Mn, Cd, As, Zn, Ni, Be, W, Sn, and Pb (group A).
Correlation coefficients values indicate strong association of
the following pairs: As–W (r=0.83, p&lt;0.05), As–Cu (r=0.84,
p&lt;0.05), Co–Fe (r=0.86, p&lt;0.05), Co–Ni (r=0.88, p&lt;0.05),
Cu–W (r=0.80, p&lt;0.05) and Sn–W (r=0.80, p&lt;0.05), and
also Co–Zn, As–Cd, and Ni–Zn (r=&lt;0.8, p&lt;0.05).

In group A, two subsets of associations are revealed: (a)
one with negative loadings in PC1 and positive loadings in
PC2 (A1—As, Sn, W, Cu, and Y) which seems to be
controlled by the mixed sulfide mineralization since all the
elements summarized by this factor are characteristic of the
sulfide ore chemistry in the area representing the residual
contamination within the study area; (b) other subset exhib-
its negative loadings in PC1 and PC2 (A2—Be, Cd, Co, Mn,
Pb, Zn, and Ni) is identified indicating that the

representative elements of the original paragenesis (such as
wolframite (Fe,Mn)WO4), pyrite (FeS2), pyrrhotite (Fe(1?×)S
(×=0–0.2)), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2),
cassiterite (SnO2), beryl (Be3Al2(Si6O18), mica, and fluorite
(CaF2)) still maintain a close relationship in the secondary
environment. The association As, Sn, and W represents the
oxide–silicate mineral formation phase (quartz, wolframite,
and cassiterite), while the associations Cu and Y, and Be,
Cd, Co, Mn, Pb, Zn represents the main sulfide phase (pyrite,
arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S), and chalcopy-
rite) and the pyrrothite alteration phase [marcasite (FeS2),
siderite (FeCO3), galena (PbS), and Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts].

These associations reflect the strong influence of the Rio
and Barroca tailings and mud dams. According to Ávila et
al. (2008), the Rio tailings samples contain scorodite
(FeAsO4·2H2O), sphalerite, wolframite, quartz, natrojaro-
site (NaFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6), montmorilonite ((Mg,
Ca)O.Al2O3Si5O10.nH2O), vermiculite((Mg,Fe,Al)3(Al,
Si)4O10(OH)2.4H2O), ilite, some silicates like kaolinite
(Al2Si2O5(OH)4), and also sulfate minerals. In contrast, in
the Rio tailings dam, melanterite (Fe2+(SO4).7(H2O)) and
minor amounts of rozenite (Fe2+(SO4).4(H2O)) and szomol-
nokite (Fe2+(SO4).(H2O)) are present. The Rio dam consists
predominantly of quartz, mica, feldspar, illite–vermiculite,
arsenopyrite, marcasite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite.
Other minerals, like scorodite and natrojarosite, are also
present. The DRX analysis of the active dam sample of
Barroca Grande revealed the presence of scorodite, arseno-
pyrite, quartz, sphalerite, heamatite (Fe2O3), and muscovite
(KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2) while the sample from the old
dam of Barroca Grande contained quartz, pyrite, chalcopy-
rite, wolframite (ferberite), and scorodite (Ávila et al. 2008).
The samples collected in the tailing materials of Barroca
Grande consist predominantly of arsenopyrite, wolframite
(ferberite), quartz, and muscovite.

The PC2, which explains 14.25 % of the total vari-
ance, is related with two groups (group B, associated to
the negative scores—Fe-Ba and Nb-V; group C, associa-
ted with the positive scores—Cr). PC2 can be associated
with the dominant lithological unit (brown argilaceous
schists and dark gray siliceous schist interbedded with
rare greywackes). Few mafic rocks (dolerites) were

observed, particularly near S. Jorge da Beira (NW–SE
subvertical).

The second factorial plan (PC1/PC3, representing
52.88 % of total variance) is dominated by the association
of Sb, Ag, and B variables (group D). This plan separates
the main sulfide minerals phases from the sulphosalts.

Level of soil pollution and environmental quality

A simplified approach to risk assessment was adopted in
this study by comparing the measured level of soil contam-
ination in SFA with local geochemical background values
(Table 1). PCA results show that As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni,
Sn, Y, W, and Zn were the elements of most concern.
Table 3 shows the results of Cf and the mCd.

According to the results, the highest Cf values are
recorded for As and Zn (median&gt;6.0), while considerable
Cf values (3&lt;median&amp;lt;6) occur in Cu, Mn, Y, and Sn. The
calculated mCf values range from 1.1 to 26.4 with an aver-
age of 4.0. The cumulative frequency distribution shows
that only 34.6 % of the soil samples were classified as nil
to very low degree of pollution with mCd values 2.0, while
the remaining 65.4 % exhibit moderate to high degree of
pollution (mCd&gt;2.0). Samples SFA 3 and SFA18 show the
highest mCd values (26.4 and 25.8, respectively). As
expected, the Casegas soils are not contaminated or show
evidences of low contamination (mCd=1.1).

In order to assess the spatial distribution of these Cf,
experimental variograms were calculated and modeled
(Table 4). All variograms, modeled by spherical schemes,
show that the nugget effect (C0) is zero.

Estimation of the spatial distribution of As and Cu was
then achieved by OK. The spatial distribution of As (Fig. 3)
reveals zones with very high values. Comparison of the SFA
data with the MPS values (11 mgkg?1; Table 1) and with the
guidelines for agriculture soils in Portugal (30 mgkg?1;
Table 1), reveals that 98.6 and 96.3 % are above these
values. The mapping of Cf of As highlights that 84.2 % of
the study area is classified as high to extremely high
contaminated.

The Cu spatial distribution (Fig. 4) also identify high
concentrations in the study area. Comparing the Cu values

with the MPS (16 mgkg?1; Table 1), 98.9 % of the area is
above the established threshold. Also, when compared with
the guidelines for agriculture soils in Portugal (100 mgkg?1;
Ferreira 2004), percentage decreases to 87.1 %. Similarly to
As, the mapping of Cf related to Cu variable shows that
81.9 % of the study area is classified as high to extremely
high contaminated. For both As and Cu variables, the anom-
alous areas are located along the Casinhas stream, between
Barroca Grande and Rio tailings, in the north area of SFA.

The spatial distribution of mCd values (Fig. 5) indicate
clearly that the highest values occur in soils located near the
Rio tailings (area 1), surrounding the Casinhas stream (area
2), and near the Barroca dam materials (area 3; see Table 5).

It must be emphasized that soils collected downstream
Barroca Grande tailings show marked increases in the mean
concentrations of As (35×), Cd (4×), Cu (4×), Pb (4×), and
Zn (22×), compared with background soils. All these values
exceed the As, Cd, Cu, and Zn allowed levels (Kloke 1979;

Reimann and De Caritat 1998). Also, the W concentrations
are higher than 83 mgkg?1.

These high values are probably related to mechanical
dispersion of tailing materials as a result of erosion.
However, it must be stressed that other mechanisms also
contribute to the secondary dispersion of these metals, such
as: (a) precipitation of hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, or hydrox-
ysulphate phases from aqueous species as pH increases; and
(b) sorption of metals onto neoformed mineral surfaces
(carbonates or Fe and Mn coatings, for example), according
to Nordstrom (1982) and Chapman et al. (1983).

CA analysis and mapping

The first factorial plane of CA explains approximately 44 %
of total inertia of the data. Figure 6a shows that the sequence

of ordinal variables follows the axis 1. In fact, lower mo-
dalities (considered clean) project onto the negative semi-
axis, while greater modalities (requiring reclamation) proj-
ect onto the positive semi-axis. The modalities are disposed
in a parabolic shape (Fig. 6a), showing a clear distribution
along the first axis—Guttman effect. Hence, modalities are
sequenced in an ascending way along this axis, from clean
to requiring reclamation passing through the area of the
graph where samples requiring further investigation are
project. Asymptotically, this axis can be considered as a
proxy of an index of the sample contamination gradient.

Figure 6b presented the projection of the samples in the
same factorial plane of Fig. 6a. Samples show the same
distribution of modalities along the first axis, allowing iden-
tifying which samples are associated with each one of the
variable categories.

In a region where agriculture and cattle breading is, after
mining, the principal economic activity, it is imperative to
cross-reference the contaminant potential and harmful effect
of soils with land use. Figure 7 reveals that samples in need
of intervention and reclamation are disposed preferentially
in urban and agriculture areas. This fuels the need to per-
form availability studies in the most pernicious elements in
what human health is concerned.

Partitioning of metals in selected samples

The mineralogical study of the two selected soil samples
(SFA3 and SFA18—selected according their position in the
projection into the first factorial plane of CA; Fig. 6b) by
XRD showed that they are composed mainly of quartz,
plagioclase, and phylossilicates (biotite, chlorite, muscovite,
illite, and kaolinite). However, some iron oxides (haematite,
goethite, and magnetite/maghemite) and As (arsenopyrite),
Fe (pyrite), Cu (chalcopyrite), Pb (galena), and Zn sulfides
(sphalerite) are also present. Iron and Al sulfates (jarosite,
KFe3+3(OH)6(SO4)2; alunite, KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6) and Fe,
Cu, and Pb sulfates and carbonates (siderite, anglesite, mala-
chite, cerusite) are also present. In some samples, plumbu-
gummite (PbAl3(PO4)2(OH)5.H2O), anidrite (CaSO4),
gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), and halite (NaCl) are also present.

Using SCE, it was possible to estimate the distribution of
Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, and Zn
among the geochemical fractions on selected soil samples
(SFA3 and SFA18), accounting for the relative proportions
of each trace metal transported by the mechanical and
chemical agents. Table 6 shows the geochemical partitio-
ning of some selected elements in those fractions of each
sample.

Iron is mostly extracted by F4 in the selected soil samples
(percent of extraction ranging from 39.2 to 69.3 %), sug-
gesting the presence of sulfides. However, considerable
proportion of this metal (up to 50 % in sample SFA3) seems

to be also associated to the remaining silicates. It must be
pointed out that the percentage of extraction associated to
amorphous and crystalline Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides ranges
between 8.3 and 9.4 %.

Similar results for As distribution patterns were obtained
for the selected soil samples (Table 6). Arsenic seems to be
linked to sulfides, since a considerable proportion is
extracted by aqua regia (F4—66.7 to 68.4 %). This high
percentage associated with sulfides reflects the presence of
arsenopyrite in the samples. Amorphous and crystalline Fe
and Mn oxyhydroxides (F3) seems to be also important
metal-bearing phases. The percentage of easily mobilized
phases is very low (0.04–0.05 %); however, As concentra-
tions associated with this extraction values (0.4–0.7 mg
kg?1) may be considered very high.

Silver, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn show high (and
similar) partitioning patterns in the SFA3 and SFA18 sam-
ples (47.7–54.5, 64.8–74.4, 73.4–80.6, 49.5–54.9, 74.4–
90.6, 42.4–65.9, 46.2–56.3, and 51–81.1 % of extraction
by hydroxylamine leach cold, respectively), suggesting that
these may be linked, to some extent, to amorphous Fe/Mn
oxyhydroxides. Moreover, part of these elements was
extracted with aqua regia in both samples, suggesting that
these elements may also be linked, to some extent, to sulfide
or clay minerals. It was also shown that Cd (10.3–13.9 % of
extraction, 1.9–4 mgkg?1 for Cd) and Zn (1.0–2.8 % of
extraction, 10–74 mgkg?1 for Zn) were also extracted to a
great extent with sodium acetate indicating that the solu-
ble/exchangeable/carbonate fraction is probably a preferen-
tial sink for Cd and Zn.

These SCE results show that the most pollutant fraction
in these soil samples consists of metals bounded to sulfides
(such as arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, and chalcopyrite) and re-
leased under oxidizing conditions in AMD production pro-
cesses. Part of this fraction, especially for As, Cd, Cu, and
Zn, is temporally retained in solid phases by precipitation of
soluble secondary minerals (precipitation of hydrated metal

sulfates) in warm, dry periods. In contrast, such minerals are
easily dissolved in rainy periods.

The highest percentage of Sn extraction is related to the
last step of extraction in samples SFA3 and SFA18. These
phases are highly resistant to both chemical and physical
weathering and can be transported long distances from the
source areas. According to Rose et al. (1979), the mobility
of Sn in natural environments is dependent on low and high
pH. Weathering induces the transport of natural and anthro-
pogenic Sn under acidic and reducing conditions, SnS2 is
insoluble under reducing conditions (Brookins 1988).

These SCE results suggest that local wind and hydrolog-
ical factors give rise to mechanisms of transport responsible
for the dispersion of elements. The mechanical dispersion
fuelled by the wind of hydrated metal sulfates, resulting
from evaporation during warm period and stored in the
open-air impoundments from Barroca Grande and Rio,
induces the accumulation of these materials on solid materi-
als such as soil. Also, these elements could be transported in
suspension by surface waters or by acidic waters draining a
number of sites, contaminating the soils with As and sulfide-
related heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd).

Conclusions

The mining and processing activities at Panasqueira mine
produces arsenic-rich mine wastes that are largely responsi-
ble for the high levels of metals at the Barroca Grande and
Rio tailings. Oxidation of sulfides may give rise to the
mobilization and migration of trace metals from the mining
wastes into the environment, releasing the contaminants to
the ecosystems. The above referred As-rich mine wastes are
the main source of pollution in the surrounding environ-
ment, namely in SFA soils.

The integrated procedure using PCA and CA allowed the
authors to identify the contaminant group of elements associ-
ated to mining activities (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn, Y, W,
and Zn were the elements of most concern) and the identifi-
cation of sites that require intervention or remediation.

On other hand, it was possible to identify the elements that
are responsible for the high degree of contamination and
classify the quality of the local soil based on the estimation
of the modified degree of contamination. According to the
results obtained through a contamination factor determination,
As and Zn are the variables that present very high contamina-
tion factors, leading to the fact that 65.4 % of the S. Francisco
de Assis soil samples exhibit a moderate to high degree of
pollution, and only 34.6 % of the samples were classified as
nil to very low degree of pollution. The spatial distribution of
this contamination factor shows that soils collected down-
stream Barroca Grande contain elements like As, Cd, Cu,
Pb, and Zn, which occur in increased concentrations, when

compared with local Bk soils. The mechanical dispersion, due
to erosion, is the main factor fuelling this phenomenon. The
practical results of this study allow selecting areas where an
eventual remediation procedure may be foreseen. Priority
should be given to areas where samples are classified as
requiring reclamation, when they are geographically located
in agricultural or urban areas.

An approach based on chemical sequential extraction
demonstrates that the distribution/accumulation of trace
metals in the SFA soils is, to a great extent, related to
sulfides, but also to amorphous or poorly crystalline iron
oxide geochemical phases. However, it was also noticed that
a significant proportion of the As, Cd, Cu, and Zn is linked
to exchangeable and acid-soluble species, upon which de-
sorption and ion exchange reactions may originate the re-
lease of these readily mobile phases. These results disclose
the fact that the wind and hydrological factors are fuelling
the chemical elements transport mechanisms. Such factors
are likely to be responsible for dispersion of the above
referred elements, water being the main transporter medium
and soils as one of the possible retention media.

Abstract In the Panasqueira mine area of central

Portugal, some environmental media show higher

metal(loid) concentrations when compared with the

local geochemical background and the values pro-

posed in the literature for these environmental media.

In order to evaluate the effect of the external

contamination on selected indexes of internal dose,

As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, Si,

and Zn were quantified by inductively coupled plasma

mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma

optical emission spectrometry in blood, urine, hair

and nail samples from individuals environmentally

(N = 41) and occupationally exposed (N = 41). A

matched control group (N = 40) was also studied, and

data from the three groups were compared. Results

obtained agreed with those reported by environmental

studies performed in this area, pointing to populations

living nearby and working in the mine being exposed

to metal(loid)s originated from mining activities.

Arsenic was the element with the highest increase in

exposed populations. The concentration of other

elements such as Cr, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, and

Zn was also increased, although at a lesser extent,

specifically in the individuals environmentally

exposed and in females. These findings confirm the

need for competent authorities to act as soon as

possible in this area and implement strategies aimed to

protect exposed populations and the entire ecosystem.

Introduction

Mining is one of the oldest activities in human

civilization and is a vital economic sector for many

countries. It is also one of the most hazardous activities

both in occupational and environmental contexts.

The remarkable increase in exposure to metal(loid)s

in several environmental and occupational settings

represents a worldwide pattern, affecting a significant

number of individuals. Most metal(loid)s have toxic

properties and can represent an important threat for

human health. Major health effects include develop-

ment retardation, endocrine disruption, kidney damage,

immunological and neurologic effects, and several

types of cancer (Mudgal et al. 2010).

Human health status can be monitored by measur-

ing biological indicators (biomarkers), in different

matrices, such as blood, urine, nails, hair, milk, and

saliva. This activity of biological monitoring has the

main purpose of relating the biomarker concentration

to the internal dose and then investigates the possibil-

ity that the extent of exposure is associated with

disease occurrence (Needham et al. 2007).

For decades, scientists have analysed biological

samples such as liver, kidney, brain, blood, and urine

to assess concentrations of trace elements in the human

body (Mehra and Juneja 2005). Information on the

elemental content of these samples is well established,

although most of them need an invasive method for

collection that may limit their use in biomonitoring

studies. Hair and nail samples provide a much less

invasive option and offer a number of advantages,

including the easy sample collection, storage, and

transportation; possible time course of exposure; the

long-term sample stability; and the simple analysis using

inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-

MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical spectrom-

etry (ICP-OES) (He 2011). These techniques are the

most commonly performed, and they are routinely used

for multielemental analysis of biological matrices

(Delves 1988; Caroli et al. 1992; Taylor et al. 2011).

Hair and nails incorporate elements in proportion to

the dietary intakes and exogenous exposure depending

upon various mechanisms, such as protein synthesis

and chemical binding with sulfhydryl groups. These

biological matrixes are useful to investigate exposure

to trace elements and are currently employed in

clinical studies with increasing frequency. As

suggested by Rodushkin and Axelsson (2000), human

hair and nails in trace elements analysis may provide

suitable data that point towards diseases such as

diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and other

cardiovascular diseases.

Panasqueira (40?905700N, 7?4503700W) was studied
between 2002 and 2007 in the scope of an e-EcoRisk

project (e-Ecorisk 2001, 2007). This area was chosen

by the consortium to be an e-EcoRisk test site due to

several factors: (a) it is an active mine; (b) there are

huge tailing piles and mud impoundments; (c) small

villages, S. Jorge da Beira, Panasqueira, Barroca

Grande, and S. Francisco de Assis are located near the

mine site; (d) the Ze?zere River crosses the area and

feeds the Castelo do Bode dam (located 90 km

downstream), the main water supply source for

Lisbon; and (e) the local population strongly depends

on the use of land and water for their subsistence

(water supply, agriculture, cattle breeding, fishing, and

forestry). From the geochemical results obtained in

this project, it was concluded that anomalous distri-

bution of several metals (Ag, Bi, Cu, Cd, Sb, Sn, W,

and Zn) and metalloids (As) in stream sediments and

surface waters from local water streams, and soils

from nearby villages occurs (A?vila et al. 2008;

Salgueiro et al. 2008; Grangeia et al. 2011). Starting

from 2010, the Department of Geosciences, University

of Aveiro (GeoBioTec) together with the National

Laboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG) have been

collecting and analysing different types of samples,

such as road dusts, soils, plants for human consump-

tion, superficial and groundwater’s, and stream sedi-

ments. Results published by Ferreira da Silva et al.

(2013) agree with those from the previous study

reporting extremely high concentrations of metals and

metalloids in all these matrices. According to the

results, the wind and hydrological factors are respon-

sible for the chemical elements transport mechanisms,

the water being the main transporter medium and soils

as one of the possible retention media (Ferreira da

Silva et al. 2013).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate

whether the contamination (environmental and occu-

pational) related to Panasqueira mine activities is

associated with the internal dose of several elements

by quantifying them in blood, urine, hair, and nails by

ICP-MS (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, No, Ni, Pb, and Se) and

Study Area

The Panasqueira mine (Sn-W) is located in Castelo

Branco district, central Portugal—Fig. 1.

The topography of this area is heterogeneous,

characterized by deep valleys and hills ranging from

350 to 1,080 m in altitude (Reis 1971). Streams are

generally dry in summer and flooded in winter.

Although historical data show that Romans worked

the area for tin (Sn), the first prospecting licence was

granted in 1886 (Cavey and Gunning 2006). The

Panasqueira mining concession covers an area of more

than 2,000 ha and since 1928 has been running by

Beralt Tin and Wolfram Lda (Corre?a de Sa? et al. 1999;

D’Orey 1967).

The ore complex paragenesis of Panasqueira contains

several minerals, which the most important are wol-

framite, cassiterite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite,

sphalerite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, siderite, galena,

Pb–Bi–Ag sulphosalts, dolomite, calcite, and siderite.

Until 1996—for approximately 90 years—the rejected

materials were deposited in the Rio tailing and/or in the

open-air impoundment located in the vicinity of Rio

tailing (Fig. 2). The open-air impoundment contains

731,034 m
3

of rejected ore concentrates with high metal

levels. This rejected material is exposed to the atmo-

sphere and rain water, and the oxidized material

generates acidic mine drainage (AMD). Also there are

several slippage zones evident in the Rio tailings,

indicating a risk of collapse. In this scenario, the stocked

material will enter directly into the Ze?zere River (e-

EcoRisk 2007). As previously mentioned Ze?zere River

feeds the Castelo do Bode dam (located 90 km down-

stream from the mine—Fig. 1), the principal water

supply for the Lisbon metropolitan area (where about

one-third of the Portuguese population lives).

Today the mining and beneficiation processes are

carried out exclusively in Barroca Grande. The

rejected materials are deposited in the Barroca Grande

tailing and/or in the open-air impoundment.

The Barroca Grande site includes a huge tail-

ing ([7 Mm3) and two open-air impoundments
(*1,2 Mm3—one of these dams still active while the
older one is deactivated, both placed over the tailing).

These tailings and impoundments are also exposed to

the atmospheric conditions, and surface run-off and

water percolation leaching are observed. The tailing

piles at Barroca Grande are adjacent to the small, but

perennially flowing, Casinhas stream, which drains

also to the Ze?zere River. The Salgueira water treatment

plant receives surface water from the old tailing pond

area, water from the new tailings pond, mine drainage

water, and seepage from the base of the tailings. These

waters are mainly treated with lime. The precipitated

sludge is pumped to the tailings pond while the treated

water is pumped into holding tanks for later use in the

mill or released to the creek channel adjacent to the

plant and discharged into the Ze?zere River.

Materials and methods

Study population

The study population consisted of a total of 122

subjects living in villages near the Panasqueira mine,

in central Portugal (Fig. 2).

The study population consisted of a total of 122

subjects living in the area of the Panasqueira mine.

Forty-one individuals living in villages located in the

vicinity of the mine were classified as environmentally

exposed (16 males and 25 females), 41 male workers

from the Panasqueira mine represented the group of

occupationally exposed, and 40 additional subjects

without environmental and/or occupational exposure

to mining activities, or other known toxic exposure,

were the controls. This latter group included individ-

uals living in non-contaminated areas, working mainly

in administrative offices and matched with the envi-

ronmentally exposed group by age, gender, lifestyle,

and smoking habits (17 males and 23 females). Only

individuals aged over 18 years and living in the same

village for at least 5 years before the study were

selected.

Health conditions, medical history, medication,

diagnostic tests (X-rays, etc.), and lifestyle factors

were assessed by means of questionnaires. Subjects

also provided information about the presence of

specific symptoms related to metal(loid)s exposure

and chronic respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis

and others; drinking and agricultural water source;

agricultural practices, including pesticides usage; diet.

All subjects were fully informed about the procedures

and objectives of this study, and signed an informed

consent form. Approval for this study was obtained

from the Institutional Ethical Board of the Portuguese

National Institute of Health.

The general characteristics of the study groups are

summarized in Table 1. Smoking habits groups were

established as never/ever smokers, with the former

group composed of individuals that never smoked and

the second one of current and ex-smokers. This was

due to the fact that the number of ex-smokers was

extremely high, and the majority of these individuals

had been heavy smokers.

Sample collection

Blood (B) samples were collected by venipuncture in

tubes containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid

(EDTA). First morning, urine (U) samples (minimum

volume: 20 ml) were collected in polyethylene sterile

bottles. Hair (H) and nail (finger, FN, and toe, TN)

samples were collected with stainless steel scissors

and nail clippers and stored in polyethylene bags.

Samples were transported under refrigeration and kept

at approximately ?4 ?C (blood) and –20 ?C (urine,
hair, and nails) until analysis. All samples were coded

and analysed under blind conditions.

Sample preparation and analysis

Blood samples (1–2 g) were added to 2 mL of HNO3
in Teflon vials and digested for 24 h at 100 ?C. After
cooling, the digested solutions were diluted with

deionized water up to 10 mL in polypropylene tubes

for elemental analysis by ICP-MS and ICP-OES. For

analysis of blood samples, In and Sc were the chemical

elements used as internal standards, while Ge and Ir

were used for urine, hair, and nail samples.

Hair and nail samples were washed and digested

following the procedures described by Coelho et al.

(2012). The solutions were transferred to plastic tubes

and made up to 5 mL with ultra-pure water for direct

determination via ICP-MS and ICP-OES. The ICP-MS

instruments used in this study were a PerkinElmer

Elan DRC II and a Thermo Elemental X Series.

A PerkinElmer Optima 5300 and a Thermo Scientific

iCAP 6300 Duo were used for ICP-OES analysis. For

microwave digestion, an Anton Paar Multiwave 3000

oven, equipped with 16 vessels, was used.

Urine samples were defrosted 24 h before the

analysis, centrifuged for 3 min at 2,500 rpm, and

diluted up to 25-fold with 1 % v/v HNO3 for

elemental analysis by ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Results

of urine samples were adjusted, and they are reported

as lg/g creatinine. This procedure (creatinine adjust-
ment) is routinely used to reduce the influence of

factors that are not related to metal(loid) exposure,

such as urine concentration and urine volume (Hin-

wood et al. 2002). Creatinine was measured spectro-

photometrically using the Jaffe reaction (Roche

Diagnostics).

All reagents used were trace analysis grade or better

quality. All aqueous solutions were prepared using

ultra-pure water.

Quality control and quality assurance

Blood analyses were validated using European Union,

Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements—

Certified Reference Materials (CRMs): BCR
?

634,

BCR
?

635, and BCR
?

636. Freeze-dried human urine

CRM from National Institute of Environmental Stud-

ies (NIES), Japan, was used in addition to validating

the metal(loid) quantification in urine samples. This

material was also analysed during each analytical run

as a quality control (QC) sample. As no nail CRM is

currently available, the methods for digestion and

analysis of hair, fingernail, and toenail samples were

validated using a human hair CRM—NCS DC 73347a

and NCS ZC 81002b human hair (NCS Beijing,

China). The CRMs were also used as QC items by

digesting a portion with each batch of samples and

determining the metal(loid) concentration along with

the other digests. Other QC measures used in the

different matrices included the periodic analysis of

suitable standards to check on instrument drift and

short-term stability. Results from all the CRMs were

within their certificated ranges.

Statistical data analysis

A general description of the study population was

performed through univariate analysis. The distribu-

tion within the three study groups of gender, age, and

lifestyle factors potentially influencing the concentra-

tion of metal(loid)s in the biological samples (i.e.

smoking habits, source of drinking water, fish con-

sumption, agricultural practices, and pesticide use)

was evaluated with the chi-square test for categorical

variables and with the analysis of variance (ANOVA)

for continuous variables.

The effect of exposure on the concentration of

metal(loid)s was preliminarily tested with the ANOVA

of log-transformed data. A multiple regression analysis

was performed to estimate the effect of the exposure,

adjusted for actual confounders. All models included

age and smoking habits. Three multiple regression

models were applied for the multivariate analysis,

depending on the characteristics and statistical distri-

bution of variables. Details are given in Table 2.

Associations between two variables were tested by

Spearman correlation. The critical limit for signifi-

cance was set at P \ 0.05. The statistical software
used for the analyses were StataCorp. 2011, Stata

Statistical Software: Release 12, College Station, TX:

StataCorp LP. and SPSS Inc. Released 2004, SPSS for

Windows, Version 13, Chicago, SPSS Inc.

Results

The general characteristics of the study groups are

summarized in Table 1. No significant differences in

age were observed between the three groups.

Gender and smoking habit difference between

groups were mostly due to the fact that the occupa-

tionally exposed group was composed only of males,

the vast majority of whom were smokers. Significant

differences were also found for the frequency of

individuals reporting their involvement in agricultural

practice, while no significant differences were found

for the source of drinking water, quantity of fish

consumed, and pesticide use in the last year.

Results of metal(loid) quantification showed sig-

nificant differences among groups, for several ele-

ments, in different matrices (Table 3).

Some of the elements—As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mg, Mn,

Mo, Ni, and Pb—presented higher values in exposed

groups (environmental and/or occupational) in all the

matrices when compared to controls. Among all the

elements analysed, As, Cr, Mn, and Pb showed

significantly different values in three different matri-

ces; Se in two; and Cd, Cu, Mg, Mo, S and Zn in one.

No significant differences were observed for Fe, Hg,

Ni, and Si in any matrix, while Cu and S presented

significantly lower values in both exposed groups in

blood and hair, respectively.

When comparing these results with reference

ranges of exposure (Table 3), the level of exposure

in our study groups was generally higher, for some

elements in some of the matrices, particularly in blood

and urine samples. Concerning nails and hair samples,

the vast majority of concentrations were within or

relatively close to the reference ranges (except for

Hg).

Results of the multivariable analysis for the effect

of exposure adjusted by age, smoking, and metal-

specific actual confounders, and stratified by gender in

those cases for which a significant effect modification

(excluding the occupationally exposed group) was

found are presented in Table 4.

After taking into account all possible confounding

factors, elements which still presented significantly

higher values in the exposed groups in one or more

biological matrices were As, Cr, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb,

S, Se, and Zn. Copper was the only element showing

significantly lower values in the exposed groups, both

in blood and hair. All significant differences were

obtained in the groups with environmental or both,

environmental and occupational exposure, except for

Cu, Mn and Pb in hair, and Se in blood, which

significantly differed from controls only in the occu-

pationally exposed group. No significant differences

were obtained for Cd, Fe, Hg, and Si. For some of

these elements, the significant differences were only

obtained for one of the genders, namely Cr in toenails

(only in females), Mg in blood (only in females), Mn

in toenails (only in females), Ni in toenails (only in

females), and Zn in blood (only in males).

Table 5 shows the correlations between the con-

centration of the same metal(loid) in different matrices

(only significant results are shown).

Only As, Hg, Mg, Mn, and Pb presented more than

one significant and positive correlation between two or

more matrices, and among these elements, only As and

Hg showed correlations between blood or urine and

fingernails, toenails, or hair. Fingernail and toenail

samples were significantly correlated in all elements

shown but Cd. Significant positive correlations were

also obtained between fingernails and hair for As, Hg,

Mn, and Pb, and between toenails and hair for As, Hg,

and Mg.

The effects of gender, age, and smoking habits on

the levels of metal(loid)s in the different matrices were

also evaluated, and the results are presented in

Table 6.

Concerning gender, the majority of the elements

showed significantly higher values in males in blood

and hair samples (except for Mg in hair, higher in

females), and significantly higher values in females in

urine, fingernails, and toenail. Regarding age, the

effect depended mainly on the matrix. All elements

showed a significant increase in older groups in blood

and urine samples, except Cu in blood, and a

significant decrease with age in fingernails, toenails,

and hair samples, except for Mn in toenails and Fe in

hair. As regards smoking, significantly higher levels

were generally observed in smokers in the different

matrices, except for Hg in hair which was significantly

lower. These results are also shown schematically in

Fig. 3.

Discussion

A high degree of contamination by metal(loid)s was

reported by geochemical campaigns involving various

sample types around the Panasqueira mine (A?vila et al.

2008; Salgueiro et al. 2008; Grangeia et al. 2011).

Moreover, local health statistics report an elevated

number of health complaints, with a significant

number of individuals with cardiac, respiratory, and

urinary diseases, and a high rate of deaths by cancer.

To evaluate the role of environmental contamination

in populations living and working nearby, we carried

out the present study, with the purpose of quantifying

the level of several elements—As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg,

Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, Si, and Zn—in different

biological matrices—blood, urine, finger and toe nails,

and hair.

Blood and urine are still the specimens of choice to

be analysed in biomonitoring studies. The levels of

most elements have been extensively studied in these

matrices, and numerous validated biomarkers of

exposure are available. As regards nails and hair

samples, in recent years, a number of studies using

these matrices have been carried out bringing new and

improved information that can help to quantify

elements in these matrices and validate this approach

to measure exposure in the near future.

In biomonitoring of environmental and occupa-

tional exposure to toxic elements, nails are generally

preferred to hair, as they do not become so easily

contaminated (Button et al. 2009). Further, toenails

may be a more reliable sample than fingernails, since

the latter come into contact with the atmosphere,

metallic objects, and other substances containing trace

elements such as dyes. In contrast, toenails most of the

time are hidden in shoes, and therefore, they have

lower contact with trace elements.

Up to now, few studies have been conducted

comparing the levels of diverse elements in all five

different matrices (He 2011). The information pro-

vided by each of them is rather different as blood and

urine generally reflect recent exposures (days/few

weeks), and hair and nails, particularly toenails, reflect

exposures occurring in the last weeks/months. This

distinction may be not straightforward for some

elements, such as Cd and Pb which accumulate in

the human body for years (half life of 10–12 years)

(Dorne et al. 2011). The combination of results from

all the matrices will allow better characterization of

the exposure.

Taking into account all this information, our results

point to different types of exposure (past/recent) for

different elements in the exposed groups (Table 4). The

group exposed to environmental toxins only apparently

experienced a pronounced and continuous (past and

recent) exposure to As, a moderate but continuous

exposure to Mg, Mn, and Zn, a recent exposure to Mo,

and past exposure to Cr, Ni, and S. Since Mo was only

analysed in blood samples, little can be said about the

timeframe of exposure to this compound. The second

group (occupationally exposed) experienced a contin-

uous exposure to Zn, recent exposure to Se, and long

standing exposure to As, Mn, and Pb.

We also investigated correlations between different

measures of the same element in the four matrices

analysed (Table 5). If exposure occurs continuously,

significant and positive correlations between the

different sample types are expected. As and Hg were

the only metal(loid)s that showed correlations

between matrices compatible with the presence of

recent and past exposure. As expected, significant and

positive correlations between fingernails and toenails

were obtained for most of these elements; significant

correlations between finger/toenails and hair, and

between blood and urine, were achieved for some of

them. It is important to highlight the fact that for some

of the elements, not all the matrices were analysed.

For some of the elements studied, the concentra-

tions reported here for blood and urine were above the

published reference ranges (Table 3). These reference

ranges were obtained from samples collected from

Italian and Swedish healthy volunteers without a

detailed description of the environmental or occupa-

tional exposure of these subjects, and therefore are

only indicative and may change significantly from

population to population. Numerous factors such as

site of residence, gender, age, diet, lifestyle, or

geochemical environment need to be taken into

account when establishing the reference ranges for a

population (Rodushkin and Axelsson 2000), and any

comparison must be interpreted carefully. As regards

the Portuguese population, there are few studies that

report metal(loid) levels in exposed populations, and

they show wide changes in levels within the same

population in different geographic areas (reviewed in

Coelho et al. 2012). Therefore, in this study, we

compared the element concentration obtained for the

exposed populations with those of the controls, as they

were matched for age, gender (only the environmen-

tally exposed group), diet, lifestyle, geochemical

environment, and residence.

Our previous studies at the Panasqueira mine area

(Coelho et al. 2011, 2012) indicated that the exposed

populations were experiencing severe health effects

derived from exposure to the environmental and

occupational contamination resulting from mining

activities; however, a more restricted number of

samples and a lower number of internal dose bio-

markers limited major conclusions and lead us to

design and perform a more complete and robust study.

From the results in Table 3, it can be seen that the

concentrations of As, Cr, Mn, and Pb vary signifi-

cantly among the three groups, with significant

differences in three different media. These results

were influenced by confounding variables such as

gender, age, smoking habits, and factors directly

associated with exposure, such as agriculture practice,

fish consumption, and source of water for consump-

tion. When adjusting for all these variables, some of

the elements were no longer significantly different

between groups (Tables 3 vs. 4).

Modifying factors such as gender, age, socioeconomic

status, and lifestyle factors in exposure and susceptibility

to metal(loid)s have been reported in the literature to play

a role in modulating exposure to metal(loid)s. However,

most of these parameters are often overlooked, and

additional studies needed to be performed in order to fill

gaps. Identification of these gaps provides information on

susceptibility factors which is critical to design guide-

lines for preventive measures (Berglund et al. 2011).

Regarding the effect of gender on the metal(loid) levels in

the different matrices, our results show that females have

higher concentrations of As, Cr, Mg, Mn, and Se in urine,

fingernails, and toenails, while males have higher levels

of Fe, Hg, Mg, Pb, S, and Zn in blood and hair samples.

The only exception was Mg in hair which presented

with significantly higher concentrations in females.

Interestingly, this difference was reported before in

different studies aiming to evaluate the concentration of

several trace elements in hair samples (Quereshi 1982;

Takeuchi et al. 1982; Nowak and Kozlowski 1998;

Chojnacka et al. 2006). The higher levels of Pb in blood

in males are also known and reported in several studies

with non-exposed, environmentally and/or occupation-

ally exposed individuals. Milman et al. (1994) suggested

that the difference in Pb blood levels between females

and males could be explained by the higher content of

haemoglobin in men.

Gender differences in the exposure to toxic metals

are well documented. In a review paper by Vahter

et al. (2007), several references to studies describing

significant differences in internal levels of elements

between males and females were described and

commented. Berglund et al. (2011) reported that

females seemed to be more at risk for toxic metal

exposure than males, and this finding was confirmed in

our study, where females had significantly higher

levels of several genotoxic elements, i.e. As, Cr, and

Mn. Differences between genders can be due to

different patterns of exposure, with one of the genders

being more exposed to certain metal(loid)s, although

the presence of different toxicokinetic mechanisms

between both genders should be taking into account.

Concerning the effect of age, we found older

individuals having higher concentrations in blood and

urine (As, Cu, Mg, and Zn), and younger individuals

having higher concentrations in nails and hair (As, Cr,

Fe, Mg, Mn, and Se). These differences, besides

different patterns of exposure, may be due to different

toxicokinetic rates, possibly because of the lower

proportion of water in the organism, lower absorption,

and excretion rates, and possible nutritional deficien-

cies, and comorbidities in older individuals.

Finally, the analysis of the effect of smoking showed

that smokers have significantly higher concentration of

several elements, although the levels of Hg in hair were

higher in non-smokers. This finding was not expected

since tobacco smoke contains Hg, but a similar result

was previously reported by Chojnacka et al. (2006).

Conclusions

Overall our results agree with those obtained in the

environmental studies performed in Panasqueira mine

area, showing as populations living nearby and

Environ Geochem Health

working in the mine are exposed to several metal(loid)s

originated by mining activities. The most important

exposure seemed to be to As, particularly in individuals

exposed through the environment. Exposure to other

elements such as Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn also occurs

but not at the same extent (amount of element/time of

exposure). Our results indicate that the environmen-

tally exposed group is more affected, specifically

females, as they presented significantly higher values

of the most toxic elements, i.e. As, Cr, Mn, and Ni.

These findings highlight once more the need for the

competent authorities to intervene in this area in order

to prevent that severe health consequences occur in

exposed populations. Not only human populations are

at risk but the entire ecosystem.

Our results show also major effects of host factors

and smoking habits on the levels of metal(loid)s in the

different biological samples analysed, strongly influ-

encing the results obtained. Studies with a higher

number of individuals, analysing all the elements in all

the matrices, need to be performed in order to better

characterize the factors influencing the exposure, the

toxicokinetic processes in the population groups, and

the feasibility of the different biological samples for

exposure assessment.
