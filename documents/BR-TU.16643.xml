ABSTRACT 

As a consequence of the degradation of coastal areas, the use of artificial reefs 

has become an important tool for the enhancement of habitats and biological 

resources. In the northeastern coast of Brazil, artificial reefs in the form of vessels have 

been deployed for recreational diving, with fishing activities being prohibited. The 

present study aimed at reporting the structure and changes in the fish community 

present in three recently deployed vessel reefs (Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus) as well 

as the colonization process on the first two, including a comparison of these three reefs 

with other artificial and natural reefs, at shallow, intermediate and deeper areas, in the 

northeastern coast. For this purpose, monthly dives using visual census were made in all 

the three vessels, from July 2006 to July 2007. Species were categorized according to 

their trophic and spatial category and analyses were made regarding their frequency, 

abundance, diversity and similarity. A total of 87 species were identified in this study. 

The two structurally identical and deeper vessels, Mercurius and Saveiros, showed a 

greater resemblance in their community structures, regarding family composition, 

diversity indices and number of species and individuals, in each trophic guild, than with 

the shallower and smaller vessel, Taurus. Both the trophic and species composition of 

Mercurius and Saveiros became more similar over time through the colonization 

process. Although the three vessel reefs point to a possible stability of the fish 

community, Taurus presents more evidence of regulating interactions amongst species. 

A high similarity, &gt;50%, was found amongst all reefs compared in this study. The results 

obtained showed that the vessel reefs have complete and complex fish communities. 

Because these artificial reefs are creating new habitats and communities, with local 

economic benefits, their use should be encouraged, with the employment of some reefs 

only for diving and others, in a future context, for artisanal fisheries management.

RESUMO 

A degradação dos ecossistemas costeiros por pressões antropogénicas tem 

tornado o uso de recifes artificiais numa ferramenta importante para o aumento de 

habitats marinhos e de recursos biológicos. No nordeste brasileiro os recifes artificiais, 

especialmente em forma de naufrágios, têm sido utilizados para o mergulho recreativo 

devido às boas condições de temperatura e visibilidade da área. Nesses locais, segundo 

uma lei estadual existente desde 2001, a actividade de pesca é completamente proibida. 

Os principais objectivos deste estudo são observar a estrutura da comunidade 

ictiofaunística, e suas possíveis mudanças, presente em três naufrágios afundados em 

Maio de 2006 (Mercurius, Saveiros e Taurus), bem como o processo de colonização, 

para os dois deles, e ainda comparar estes três recifes com outros recifes naturais e 

artificiais, a diferentes profundidades, na costa nordeste do Brasil. Com esse intuito, 

foram realizados mergulhos mensais utilizando censos visuais, de Julho de 2006 a Julho 

de 2007. Devido à estrutura complexa dos naufrágios e ao reduzido tempo de mergulho 

foi utilizada uma combinação de metodologias, incluindo transectos e busca intensiva, 

de forma a observar e contabilizar todas as espécies presentes nos mesmos. As espécies 

foram separadas em categorias com base no seu comportamento trófico (carnívoros, 

omnívoros, piscívoros, planctívoros, herbívoros territoriais, herbívoros móveis, 

predadores de invertebrados sésseis e predadores de invertebrados móveis) e espacial 

(tipo A - espécies que preferem o contacto físico com o recife; B - espécies que nadam à 

volta do recife, estando associados a este por visão e som; C - espécies que se mantêm 

na coluna de água; e D - espécies que utilizam a área ao redor dos recifes), analisando-

se a sua frequência, abundância, diversidade e similaridade. Foi identificado um total de 

87 espécies neste estudo, com 82 para o Mercurius, 68 para o Saveiros e 69 para o 

Taurus. Os dois naufrágios com características mais semelhantes em termos de 

tamanho e profundidade, o Mercurius e o Saveiros, apresentaram uma maior 

semelhança entre si relativamente à composição das famílias de peixes, índices 

biológicos e número de espécies e peixes encontrados em cada categoria trófica, do que 

em relação ao Taurus, naufrágio com um tamanho menor e situado a uma menor 



 

v 

 

profundidade. O Mercurius e o Saveiros também mostraram, através de uma ordenação 

MDS (MultiDimensional Scaling), que a sua composição específica e trófica se tornava 

cada vez mais semelhante ao longo do processo de colonização. Os valores mais 

elevados de diversidade biológica foram encontrados nestes dois naufrágios, com igual 

valor para a diversidade de Shannon (2.83) e reduzida diferença para a equitabilidade de 

Pielou (entre 0.83 e 0.82). O Taurus apresentou os menores valores para os índices 

biológicos, com uma diversidade de 2.61 e equitabilidade de 0.76. Estes valores, 

juntamente com a análise do log da abundância e percentagem de frequência, e do 

número de espécies e peixes observados ao longo dos mergulhos, mostram que apesar 

das comunidades já se apresentarem ricas e tenderem a uma estabilidade, o Taurus 

mostra evidências de processos mais intensos de interacção entre as espécies, 

encontrando-se a sua comunidade ictiofaunística ainda em estruturação. Para as 

análises da colonização foram também utilizadas categorias de distribuição espacial das 

espécies relativamente ao naufrágio, verficando-se diferenças no potencial de 

caracterização e evolução da comunidade entre as diversas categorias e especialmente 

em relação à presença ou não de mergulhadores, uma vez que um dos naufrágios 

comparados estava fechado para mergulho recreativo, servindo como controle. Foi 

encontrada uma forte semelhança (&gt; 50%) entre todos os recifes comparados neste 

estudo pela análise de clusters, utilizando-se a lista de ausência/ presença das espécies. 

Com esses dados, foi feita uma Análise de Correspondência que separou os locais de 

acordo com a sua profundidade, agrupando os rasos num grupo, todos os intermédios, 

incluindo um natural, num segundo grupo e, por último, o recife profundo mais 

afastado. Ainda em relação às análises de cluster, observaram-se diferentes resultados 

de agregação entre os recifes consoante o tipo de dados utilizados (e. g. todas as 

famílias ou só aquelas que mostram certo grau de dependência do recife – 

Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae e Scaridae), 

nas quais o recife intermédio natural se encontrava agrupado aos restantes recifes 

intermédios mas artificiais ou aos recifes naturais mas rasos. Os resultados obtidos 

neste estudo mostram que as comunidades presentes nos naufrágios são características 



 

vi 

 

da costa nordeste do Brasil, tendo presentes todas as famílias mais encontradas em 

outros recifes costeiros. Nesta última comparação, as diferenças observadas 

relativamente aos índices de diversidade foram provavelmente influenciadas pelas 

características estruturais das áreas comparadas e pelas diferenças de metodologia 

utilizada (e.g. o uso de transecto versus censo estacionário, a utilização de ictiotóxico 

como óleo de cravo). Com a falta de estruturas ou relevos mais complexos na 

plataforma continental de Pernambuco, uma vez que esta é essencialmente plana com 

poucas irregularidades até aos 40-50 m, o afundamento de estruturas artificiais 

funciona como um oásis, para o qual são atraídos peixes de áreas adjacentes. Foi 

observado um aumento no número de espécies do local para mais 20 espécies em 

menos de três meses. Pelas análises realizadas com a ausência/presença de espécies foi 

possível obter um cenário temporal das alterações inerentes ao desenvolvimento das 

comunidades de peixes recifais, atribuindo uma maior importância à ecologia das 

espécies do que à dinâmica da comunidade como um todo. Como consequência das 

limitações intrínsecas à comparação de diferentes recifes neste trabalho, resultantes da 

escassez de bibliografia e utilização de recifes artificiais no nordeste brasileiro, foi 

impossível distiguir o verdadeiro factor limitante para a distribuição de algumas 

espécies, i.e., a profundidade ou o tipo de recife. No entanto, apesar da importância 

atribuída à configuração de um recife na estruturação da sua comunidade 

ictiofaunística, este estudo sugere a profundidade como um factor chave neste 

processo, pois as comunidades observadas nos recifes intermédios mostraram-se mais 

semelhantes entre si independentemente da localização geográfica e do tipo de recife. 

Uma vez que os naufrágios criaram novos habitats e comunidades de organismos, 

trazendo benefícios ecológicos e económicos locais, o seu uso na costa pernambucana 

deverá ser encorajado tanto para a criação de locais de mergulho como, num futuro 

próximo, para a gestão de pescas artesanais.

BACKGROUND 

 All the oceans of the world are now affected by human activities which cause 

severe and widespread ecosystem degradation (Scholes et al., 2005). Coastal systems 

are among the most productive and the most highly threatened in the world. With 

nearly 40% of the world population living within 100 kilometers of the coast, these 

systems are experiencing exploitation pressures associated with population growth 

(Agardy &amp;amp; Alder, 2005). As a result, the demands on coastal areas for shipping, waste 

disposal, military and security uses, recreation, aquaculture, and even habitation, are 

increasing and often involve the destruction of coastal forests, wetlands, coral reefs and 

other related habitats (Agardy &amp;amp; Alder, 2005). 

Coral reefs, in tropical coastal areas, are known for their high species diversity 

and endemism (Sale, 1991; Lowe-McConnell, 1999) and are valued for their 

provisioning, regulating and cultural services (McKinney, 1998). Reef ecosystems 

provide values such as tourism, recreation, scientific research and have also great 

importance at the educational, medicinal and pharmaceutical level (Ahmed et al., 2005). 

These goods and services are an important source of income for local populations, with 

coastal tourism and diving as the main income generating activities in some areas (Cesar 

&amp;amp; Chong, 2005). 

One of the most dynamic elements of the coral reef ecosystem is the fish 

community. Its taxonomic richness, diversity in shape and habits, and behavioral and 

inter and intra relationships (Sale, 1991) make fish communities good indicators of the 

marine environment and a very interesting class to study. 

 As a consequence of the degradation of natural reefs, the use of artificial reefs 

has became an important tool for the enhancement of habitats by increasing natural 

production of biological resources (Bohnsack &amp;amp; Sutherland, 1985) in countries that rely 

on marine resources as an essential economic activity (Conceição, 2003).

Artificial Reefs  

Artificial reefs – ARs – can be defined, according to the European Artificial Reef 

Research Network (EARRN), as “a submerged structure placed on the substratum 

(seabed) deliberately, to mimic some characteristics of a natural reef” (Jensen, 1998) 

and that “influence physical, biological, or socio-economic processes related to living 

marine resources” (Sutton &amp;amp; Bushnell, 2007). According to this definition, structures like 

piers and steel jackets of oil/gas production platforms can be considered as secondary 

artificial reefs (Pickering et al., 1998). Other man-made structures also considered as 

artificial reefs are FADs – Fish Aggregating Devices – that have been extensively used, 

worldwide, to attract commercial and recreational pelagic fish species (Workman et al., 

1985). However, in this study, we will only consider bottom structures as artificial reefs.    

Until recently, artificial habitats have been widely associated with the 

establishment of fishing grounds (Nakamura, 1985; Pickering et al., 1998).  However, the 

deployment of ARs now includes several new purposes, such as: ecosystem 

conservation and management, with the prevention of trawling in seagrass meadows 

(Relini &amp;amp; Relini, 1989) and mitigation of environmental impacts in seagrass beds 

(Sánchez-Jerez et al., 2002; Pondella et al., 2006), coral reefs (Abelson, 2006) and kelp 

forests (Deysher et al., 2002; Reed et al., 2006); aquaculture and marine ranching 

(James et al., 2007; Relini et al., 2007); biological enrichment of unproductive areas 

(Stephen &amp;amp; Lindquist, 1989; Walker et al., 2002); and as a possible tool in the 

management and augmentation of the marine ornamental industry (Wilson et al., 

2001). Recreational activities such as SCUBA diving (Milon, 1989; Brock, 1994; Van 

Treeck &amp;amp; Schuhmacher, 1998; Stolk et al., 2007), mostly in the United States and the 

Red Sea, and surfing (Burgess et al., 2003), in Australia and New Zealand, are seen as 

potential circumstances for the use of ARs. These artificial reefs can even act like 

coastline protection and marine sanctuaries (Bortone et al., 1994; Rousseau, 2006), in a 

similar way as natural reefs. 

With so many different functionalities it is easy to foresee the importance of ARs 

and the reason why several groups and organizations linked to the use of structures

have been funded. Among these are recreational and commercial fishing groups, 

recreational diving groups, governments (with both agencies for fisheries management 

and environmental protection), researchers, and community groups (Sutton &amp;amp; Bushnell, 

2007). These stakeholders have been found to have a good perception of the benefits 

(social, economic and environmental) that can result from the deployment of an AR 

(Milon, 1989; Ramos et al., 2007). One frequently used argument for the creation of 

artificial reefs is the positive economic impact in the local communities, through the 

increase in tourism and recreational activities (e.g., Pendleton, 2005). These impacts can 

occur at different levels (local, regional and state) and can be measured in terms of 

employment, sales, income and tax revenue (Milon et al., 2000).  

 In some countries, artificial reefs have been used as important elements of 

integrated plans and are considered to be a good investment with long term economic 

and ecological returns (Santos, 1997). On the other hand, in other countries, especially 

developing ones, in spite of the prospect for good results in terms of environmental 

preservation, research and resource exploitation, and besides the great interest of their 

application for the resolution of coastal conflicts, the use of artificial reefs is still poorly 

understood as an efficient tool by governmental institutions responsible for the 

planning and management of natural marine resources (Alencar et al., 2003).  

 

Artificial Reefs and Diversity 

Artificial reefs provide appropriate substrata for a variety of epibenthic 

organisms including macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes. Because artificial surfaces 

create new habitats, which can differ from natural reefs in the same environmental 

conditions, it is important to carefully evaluate with extreme caution the negative and 

positive impacts of the modification on the identity and number of species within the 

considered area (Connell &amp;amp; Glasby, 1999). Thus, the understanding of the regulating 

mechanisms for the abundance and distribution of the organisms can influence the 

improvement of reef design, as to better mimic natural reef habitats, and if that is 



Introduction

achieved, artificial reefs can help to maintain biodiversity patterns, both locally and 

regionally (Bulleri, 2005). 

Several parameters have been found to influence the diversity of species and 

density of organisms in artificial reefs, such as reef design and complexity (Walsh, 1985; 

Brock &amp;amp; Norris, 1989; Hixon &amp;amp; Beets, 1989), size (Jessee et al., 1985; Anderson et al., 

1989; Jordan et al., 2005), material (Bailey-Brock, 1989; Nelson et al., 1994) and 

surrounding substrate (Chandler et al., 1985; Coll et al., 1998), with some studies 

coming to different conclusions.  

One of the main reasons for the deployment of artificial reefs is the assumed 

limitation of habitat, and its importance as shelter and food source for fish species, and 

this raises the main divergent point regarding the use of ARs, the ‘Attraction versus 

Production’ debate (Bohnsack, 1989). While the attraction hypothesis states that ARs 

simply redistribute fishes without augmenting production, and that the larger densities 

sometimes found in artificial reefs are the result of attraction to a new habitat, (Wilson 

et al., 2001), the production hypothesis relies on the assumption that artificial reefs can 

increase the carrying capacity in a saturated environment and, as a result, enhance the 

abundance of species (Bortone et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 2001). The effect that ARs will 

have in the dynamics of fish communities will depend on their degree of attraction as 

well as the strength of density dependence (Osenberg et al., 2002), with the most 

susceptible species to a possible biomass increase being the ones that present habitat- 

limited population control, reef dependency, demersal and territorial behavior 

(Bohnsack, 1989). 

 

The use of Artificial Reefs 

  Just as reef applications vary, reef materials also differ between countries. The 

most used materials are concrete, followed by natural stone and rock, offshore 

platforms and FADs, tires, stabilized ash, plastic and even old structures like vessels and 

automobiles (Baine, 2001). However, the deliberate use of some of these materials, 

such as platforms, vessels and tires, is one of the most controversial aspects related to 



Introduction 
 

6 

 

the creation of ARs (Baine &amp;amp; Side, 2003). In Europe and Japan, concrete is the preferred 

material, whilst in Australia, Jamaica and the Philippines, tires have been successfully 

used as artificial reefs (Pickering et al., 1998).  

Regarding vessels, several countries are sinking decommissioned ships, as 

artificial reefs, for the enhancement of fisheries, sport angling, diving activities and eco-

tourism (Jones &amp;amp; Welsford, 1997; Baine, 2001; Pendleton, 2005). Vessel-reefs have been 

subject to several studies, such as environmental and structural influences on biological 

communities (Chandler et al., 1985; Sanders Jr. et al., 1985; Bayne &amp;amp; Szmant, 1989; 

Lindquist &amp;amp; Pietrafesa, 1989), fish assemblages (Stephan &amp;amp; Lindquist, 1989; Arena et al., 

2007), social, economic and environmental benefits (Pendleton, 2005; Leeworthy et al., 

2006) and even volunteer programs (Parnell, 2005; REEF, 2007). 

In the Brazilian coast, several states have been deploying artificial reefs from the 

90’s on. Paraná is the state with the largest AR project with more than 2.000 concrete 

structures, including anti-trawling reefs and reefs for fisheries enhancement and 

conservation, followed by São Paulo with the initial deployment, in 1997, of 100 

concrete structures and 30 made of steel, and a posterior enlargement of the project in 

2000, with the immersion of another 160 structures, 100 made of concrete and 60 of 

steel (Alencar et al., 2003). The state of Rio de Janeiro, associated with the largest 

number of AR related scientific publications (e.g., Godoy et al., 2002; Zalmon et al., 

2002; Brotto et al., 2007), has used several materials from tires to concrete structures, 

vessels and old oil tubes (Alencar et al., 2003). In the state of Ceará, a project to aid local 

fisheries and also avoid the proliferation of dengue by redistributing old tires, has 

installed more than 20.000 tires in 35 artificial reefs throughout the coast of the state 

(Conceição, 2003). Another use for artificial reefs in Brazil is recreational diving, with 

vessel reefs being deployed in states such as Espírito Santo and Pernambuco. In the 

former, only one vessel reef (Victory-8B) has been deployed, while in Pernambuco nine 

vessels have been purposefully sunk.  

In Pernambuco, the first vessel deployed as an AR was Marte, in 1998, followed 

by Gonçalo Coelho, two years later. After that, in 2002, three vessels, Servemar X, 



Introduction

Minuano and Lupus, were deployed off the coast off Recife, followed by Servemar I, in 

2004 (Santos &amp;amp; Passavante, 2007). In 2006, three decommissioned ships were donated 

to the AEMPE (Associação de Empresas de Mergulho de Pernambuco), and were sunk in 

May, also in Recife’s coast, with the purpose of creating the Parque de Naufrágios 

Artificiais de Pernambuco (PNAPE) – Pernambuco Artificial Wreck Park (Santos et al., 

2008). 

 

AIMS AND STRUCTURE OF THESIS 

Few studies have been conducted on artificial reefs on the Brazilian coast, with 

even fewer on vessel-like structures, resulting mostly in congress abstracts (Silva et al, 

2003; Miranda et al, 2004; Amaral et al., 2007). This study intends to increase the 

knowledge of fish communities and the biological and colonization processes on 

recently deployed vessel-reefs off Recife, in the northeastern tropical coast of Brazil. 

Recife is the capital city of the state of Pernambuco and it is known as the 

Brazilian capital of shipwreck diving, with more than fifty shipwrecks along the coast. 

The warm temperature and high visibility of the water makes recreational diving an 

important source of income and promotion of Recife coastal habitats attributes. The 

diving facilities together with the existence of a state law 23.394/2001 (Pernambuco, 

2001), which prohibits spear and hook and line fishing in the vicinity of the sunken 

vessels, make the coast of Recife an excellent location for the development of projects 

and studies on biodiversity, colonization, succession, productivity and other artificial 

reef related subjects. 

 A comprehensive study of the effects and benefits of an artificial reef is a long 

and complicated endeavor. It is a multidisciplinary work involving different areas of 

knowledge, from the habitat’s abiotic and biological and ecological characteristics of the 

organisms linked to the reef, to the social and economic aspects of the deployment of 

an artificial reef.  

The aim of this thesis is to quantify and evaluate the changes in the fish 

community that took place during the first year of the deployment of three derelict 



Introduction

vessels in the coast of Recife (PE), Brazil, comparing it with similar natural and artificial 

reefs off the northeast coast of Brazil. The specific aims of this work were divided in 

three main chapters, structured as follows:  

? Chapter 1 lists the fish species associated with three vessel reefs (Mercurius, 

Saveiros and Taurus) and aims to characterize and compare the 

ichthyofaunal communities present on these reefs through quantitative and 

qualitative analyses at frequency, trophic and spatial levels;  

? Chapter 2 studies the ichthyofaunal colonization and succession of two 

similar vessels, Saveiros and Mercurius, with differential usage (i.e. open VS 

closed for recreational diving), by the use of trophic guilds and spatial 

distribution categories. An evaluation of the visual census methodology on 

different spatial categories is also done; 

? Chapter 3 compares the community of reef fishes found in several different 

reefs (shallow, intermediate and deep; natural and artificial) and groups 

species according to their distribution pattern. 

 

The final items of this thesis summarize the major points highlighted in the three 

chapters and discuss the performance of the recently deployed vessel reefs as true 

reefs, at an ecological and trophic level.

CONTEXT OF THE STUDY 

This study was part of a project called PNAPE – Pernambuco  Artificial Wreck 

Park, in which three decommissioned tug boats (Mercurius, Saveiros e Taurus) were 

sunk for commercial and scientific purposes. The project was a cooperation between 

the State Association of Dive Companies and two federal universities in the state of 

Pernambuco (Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco – UFRPE, and Universidade 

Federal de Pernambuco – UFPE). The main objectives were to have an opportunity to 

study the colonization process of these recently deployed structures since the very 

beginning, while simoultaneously promoting the diving tourism industry in Pernambuco, 

by creating new diving alternatives (Santos et al., 2008).  

The project was a multidisciplinary research that included the study of physical 

(currents), chemical (hydrology), geological (morphology and sediments), and biological 

(colonization and succession of benthos and ichthyofauna) characteristics related to the 

vessel reefs. The logistic was made possible due to the support of dive companies, in 

particular Aquáticos which made all the arrangements for the monthly monitoring of 

the three vessels during the two years of the project. 

The data for this study was collected during the first year after the deployment 

of Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus, by a scientific group of post and undergraduate 

students, from two laboratories in the aforementioned universities (LOP – Laboratório 

de Oceanografia Pesqueira in UFRPE, and IMAT – Grupo de Ictiologia Marinha Tropical in 

UFPE), aiming at the study of reef fish communities and their interactions in the vessel 

reefs. 

 

STUDY AREA 

This study was carried out on the coast of Recife (PE) in northeastern Brazil (Fig. 

1). The three vessel reefs sampled were Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros which are 

located at a distance of about 6, for the first, and 7 nautical miles from the port of 

Recife. Taurus (08°04,193’S and 034°45,196’W) is the closest from shore, being located

at a depth of 25 m, whilst Saveiros (08°04,517’S and 034°44,327’W) and Mercurius 

(08°04,725’S and 034°44,022’W) are near the 30 m isobath, being 700 m distant from 

each other. The two deeper vessels are very similar with a total length of 29 m and with 

a vertical relief of about 10 m, with Saveiros open for recreational diving and Mercurius 

closed for any activity other than research dives. Taurus is smaller, with only 26 m total 

length and a vertical relief of about 8 m, which is related to its inclined bow at an angle 

of 25º, rather than its real height (Fig. 2).

The continental shelf of Pernambuco has a reduced width of about 35 km and a 

relatively shallow depth, and is largely flat, from the shore to the continental slope, 

which begins at 50 or 60 m (Manso et al., 2003). 

The northeastern continental shelf presents three distinct regions: a) the internal 

shelf (0 to 20 m), with soft slopes and regular terrain, mainly constituted by quartz sand; 

b) the medium shelf (20 to 40 m), with some irregularities in relief and a predominance 

of sand and gravel with a high percentage of calcium carbonate (&gt;90%); and c) the 

external shelf (from 40 m on) with irregular terrain and predominance of gravel and 



Introduction 
 

11 

 

biodetritic sand and muds, with a large abundance of Halimedas sp. and an amount of 

calcium carbonate superior to 75%  (Cunha, 2004).  

The constancy of the shelf and the influence of the South Equatorial Current 

contribute to the stability of environmental parameters such as salinity, temperature 

and water transparency, creating ideal conditions for the development of algae, 

especially maerl – red coralline algae (Mabesoone et al., 1972 in Cunha, 2004). Also 

associated with these carbonate rich sediments are large quantities of benthic 

foraminifera (Cunha, 2004) that contribute to the bioclastic portion of the substrate. 

These algae, which are one of the main components of the substrate, are usually from 

the genus Lithothamnium and the upper limit of their growth is related to the boundary 

of the terrigenous influence, at 20 m, while the lower is situated from 80 to 100 m deep. 

Green algae from the genus Halimeda, Udotea and Penicillius are also an important 

source for biogenic sediments of the continental shelf (Coutinho, 1976; Pereira et al., 

2007). 

 

SAMPLING METHODOLOGY 

Due to the high visibility of the coastal waters of Recife, its reduced impact on 

the environment and its easy application, the visual census was chosen as the sampling 

methodology for the study of the ichthyofauna. The artificial reefs were monitored 

monthly with SCUBA equipment, from July 2006 to July 2007, with no dives occurring in 

June due to rough sea conditions. As the vessel reefs have a complex topographical 

relief and the dives are limited to 20 minutes, visual census were used with a 

combination of methodologies (Watson &amp;amp; Quinn II, 1997): transect (Brock, 1954; 

Buckley &amp;amp; Hueckel, 1989) and intensive search methods (Bortone &amp;amp; Bonhsack, 1991). 

According to Bortone et al. (1989), when there is a known area and a time limit to do a 

survey, it is advisable to sample the number of fishes by transect of a  pre-determined 

length and width, counting every occurrence on both sides of the diver (Labrosse et al., 

2002).

maximum depths. 

 

Each sampling consisted of a team of four divers who performed the transect 

survey simultaneously, with two divers near the bottom and two at the height of the 

cabin, on the port and starboard sides, at a constant swimming speed. Every fish 

occurring in a 2 m distance on each side of the imaginary line was registered. The 

swimming velocity for the transect was slow, from 6 to 10m/min, and allowed sporadic 

stops to cautiously examine the area (Colvocoresses &amp;amp; Acosta, 2007). Upon finishing the 

transect, an intensive search was performed, in the cabin area, in an effort to minimize 

the underestimation of cryptic species, which is known to be a limitation of visual 

census methodology (Brock, 1982; Hobson, 1980; Kulbicki, 1990). This intensive search 

consisted in taking note of every species observed in the study area. 

Fishes were identified to the species level, according to Carvalho-Filho (1999), 

Humann &amp;amp; DeLoach (2002), and also Fishbase (www.fishbase.org), with data on the 

abundance being also registered. Recent changes in the classification of the Serranidae,

with the restoration of the Epinephelidae as a family, such as proposed by Craig &amp;amp; 

Hastings (2007), were adopted. 

The data were thus collected through visual census, underwater photo and video 

and direct observations by the divers in 44 scuba dives, resulting in a sampling total time 

of 880 min (Table 1). During the dives, observations on behavior and photographic 

records for posterior confirmation of the identification of the species were made with 

the use of a Sony Cybershot DSC–W5 5.0 MP with MPK–WA housing. The vessels were 

sampled on a monthly basis, with the dives always taking place between 10 am and 3 

pm, to maximize sunlight and visibility and to avoid the natural differences of fish 

activity between day and night (Gray et al., 1998; Nagelkerken et al., 2000a; Unsworth 

et al., 2007). 

 

DATA ANALYSES 

 According to the different objectives of the study, the data were treated and 

analyzed using a variety of different techniques and softwares, as described in the 

following three chapters.

CHAPTER 1. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ON VESSEL REEFS OFF THE 
COAST OF RECIFE (PE) - BRAZIL



Chapter 1 

 

16 

INTRODUCTION 

Nearly 40% of the known fish species occur in tropical waters, in association with 

coral reefs (Moyle &amp;amp; Cech, 1996), which are among the world’s most complex marine 

ecosystems, offering endless ecological niches and containing the most colorful and 

diverse fish communities (Sale, 1991; Lowe-McConnell, 1999).  

The centre of reef fish diversity in the Atlantic is the Caribbean (Floeter &amp;amp; 

Gasparini, 2000), with its richness decreasing from tropical to temperate latitudes 

(Ebeling &amp;amp; Hixon, 1991). The reef ichthyofauna of the southwestern Atlantic is one of 

the least known (Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2000) and only recent efforts have been 

undertaken to compile and describe the species and communities occurring in the 

Brazilian coast (Rocha et al., 1998; Floeter et al., 2003) and offshore reefs (Rosa &amp;amp; 

Moura, 1997; Feitoza et al., 2003). Together with those studies, several descriptions of 

new fish species, similar to the Atlantic congeners but endemic to the Brazilian coast, 

have been reported (Moura, 1995; Rocha &amp;amp; Rosa, 1999; Floeter &amp;amp; Gasparini, 2001; 

Moura et al., 2001; Moura &amp;amp; Lindeman, 2007). 

Fishes are important elements in the reef environment, structuring communities 

through processes such as predation, competition and territoriality (Choat &amp;amp; Bellwood, 

1991). As mentioned by Sale (1991), “coral reef fishes are an excellent system to work 

in” due to the mobility, accessibility and temporal and spatial scale of processes they 

undergo added to their diversity of forms, habits and relationships. 

 A guild is a group of species that exploit the same environmental resources in a 

similar way, and one advantage of the use of this concept is that it focuses on sympatric 

species that are involved in a competitive interaction, regardless of their taxonomic 

relationship (Root, 1967). Because the same guild, such as feeding groups, may be 

represented in several different communities, it can be very useful in the comparative 

study of different biotopes or communities (Root, 1967). Similarly to the use of guilds, 

the calculation of biological indices allows for the analysis and comparison, in a 



Chapter 1- Introduction 

17 

systematic way, of different communities, as well as for the evaluation of their evolution 

(Magurran, 2004). 

To evaluate the reef fish community present in the three vessel reefs after a year 

of deployment, the fish assemblages structure was characterized using species 

abundance and frequency of occurrence, trophic guilds and biological indices (species 

diversity and evenness), and were compared amongst them, using other reef areas in 

the northeastern coast of Brazil as reference.

DATA ANALYSIS 

 Diversity Indices 

According to Magurran (2005), community’s diversity should be divided in two 

main components: species richness (number of species) and the distribution of these 

species (relative abundance of each species). Therefore, in this study the following 

indices were calculated: Shannon-Wiener’s diversity (H’) and Pielou’s evenness (J’). 

 

? Shannon-Wiener’s diversity index (H’) 

This index (H’) is frequently used and its value is affected by the community’s 

specific richness and the distribution of the individuals among species (Krebs, 1999). It is 

calculated by the equation: 

?
?

??
S

i

pipiH
1

ln´ , 

with pi as the proportion of individuals of species i. 

 

? Pielou’s evenness (J’) 

Evenness reflects the abundance distribution among every species of the 

community. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, resulting in lower values (approaching 0) if 

a species abundance is much higher than that of the others (Krebs, 1999). Its 

equation is: 

)(ln

'
'

S

H
J ? , 

where H’ is Shannon’s diversity index and S the number of observed species. 

 

For the estimation of the biological components, the number of fish in large 

schools of some frequently occurring species (e.g., Haemulon aurolineatum, H. 

squamipinna, Pempheris schomburgkii) or of species that occurred only occasionally but 

had a large schooling behavior (e. g. more than 200 individuals) were not recorded. This 



Chapter 1- Data Analysis 

 

19 

decision was based on the problems associated with sampling large schools due to their 

geometry, size and species composition (Bortone &amp;amp; Bohnsack, 1991). 

 Frequency and abundance 

To describe and compare the community among sites, frequency of occurrence 

(f.o.) and relative abundance (r.a.) were also determined, using the following equations:

with Ti as the number of transects in which the species i was registered, Tt the 

total number of transects, Ni the number of individuals belonging to species i recorded 

for each vessel reef, and Nt the total number of individuals in that vessel. Species and 

families were analyzed based on pre-determined abundance classes (adapted from 

Feitoza, 2001) (Table 1-1).

Uncommon f.o. = 11-20%    

Rare f.o. &amp;lt;10%  Low abundance r.a. &amp;lt;2% 

 

Trophic Guilds 

Species were trophically classified, based on available literature (Randall, 1967; 

Cervigón et al., 1993; Feitoza, 2001; Dominici-Arosemena &amp;amp; Wolff, 2005; Halpern &amp;amp; 

Floeter, 2008) and following Ferreira et al., (2004), as: Carnivores (C), Mobile 

Invertebrate feeders (MI), Omnivores (O), Piscivores (P), Planktivores (PL), Roving 

Herbivores (RH), Sessile Invertebrate feeders (SI) and Territorial Herbivores (TH).

Analysis 

For the analysis of the diversity indices (H’ and J’) and comparison of the 

frequency classes and abundance of trophic guilds between vessels, the non parametric 

Kruskal-Wallis test was used, after a non normal distribution (Lilliefors test of normality; 

p&lt;0.05) was found for both Taurus and Saveiros. For the comparisons of the diversity 

indices in each vessel reef throughout the study periods, a chi-square test was used. All 

tests had a 95% of Confidence Interval and were computed using BioEstat 3.0 software.

Structure of the fish community  

In this study, 87 species belonging to 41 families and 64 genera (Appendix 1) 

were registered in 44 dives for the three vessel reefs. The most species-rich families in 

the vessel reefs (Figure 1-1, Appendix 1) were: Labridae, with seven to eight species; 

Epinephelidae, varying from three to five species; Haemulidae with five species in the 

three reefs; Lutjanidae with four to five species; and Pomacentridae, with five and three 

species. Carangidae and Scaridae were represented by a maximum of four species, while 

three species each were recorded for Acanthuridae, Pomacanthidae and Gobiidae. The 

other families registered in the study were only represented by one or two species. 

 
Figure 1-1. Number of species by family in each of the vessel reefs (Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus). 

 
 

 Most families were represented by a larger number of species in Mercurius, with 

the exception of the pomacentrids and scarids, which showed higher numbers in Taurus 

(Fig. 1-1). Saveiros showed a family distribution close to Mercurius, except for 

Epinephelidae, Lutjanidae and Carangidae, that had a smaller number of species. In 

Taurus, the distribution of species was different, especially for the serranids, with only 

three species, and for pomacentrids and scarids, with the occurrence of five and four 

species, respectively, having thus a higher number of species than the other two vessel 

reefs. Haemulidae, Acanthuridae and Pomacanthidae were similar regarding the 

number of species in each reef, with five species for the first and three for the latter

two. Gobiids were represented by two species in Taurus and by three species in 

Mercurius and Saveiros (Fig. 1-1).  

 Concerning the resemblance of species, 55 species (63.2%) were common to the 

three vessel reefs (Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros), six species (6.9%) were only found 

in the deeper reefs (Mercurius and Saveiros) and 20 species (22.9%) were recorded in 

only one vessel. Three species (3.4%) were common to the Mercurius (deeper) and 

Taurus (shallower), and another three to Saveiros (deeper) and Taurus (shallower) (Fig. 

1-2; Appendix 1). 

 

Figure 1-2. Percentage of species found among the vessel reefs Mercurius (M), Saveiros (S) and Taurus (T). 

 
 

Regarding the diversity indices (Fig. 1-3), the mean value for H’ was the same for 

Mercurius and Saveiros (2.83), with the latter having a little higher evenness, 0.83, than 

Mercurius (0.82). Taurus had a lower H’ and J’, with 2.61 and 0.76, respectively. Using 

Kruskal-Wallis test, no significant difference was found for Shannon’s diversity between 

vessels (H=4.24, p=0.12) but there was a significant difference for the evenness between 

the two deeper vessels and Taurus with H=11.66 and p&lt;0.05.  

No significant differences were found among the classes of frequency of 

occurrence among vessel reef (Table 1-2), with the exception of “very common species”

the decline observed in frequency percentages did not show the expected shape (as 

shown in Appendix 3) with the frequency patterns being similar in the three vessel reefs, 

with only minor differences between the reefs (Fig. 1-4). Saveiros and Taurus had a 

similar pattern in the frequency of species, with occasional species (28 and 29%) 

followed by the very common (26 and 25%), the common and the rare species with the 

same percentage (17 and 19%) and the uncommon species as the least frequent class 

(12 and 7%, respectively) (Fig. 1-4). For Mercurius, the very common (31%) were 

followed by the occasional (25%) and the rare species (22%), with the common and the 

uncommon being the least frequent species (with 13 and 10%).

 Regarding trophic distribution, a more similar pattern was observed between the 

two deep vessels than with Taurus both for number of species and number of 

individuals (Fig. 1-5 and 1-6).  

For the relative abundance on the number of species (Fig. 1-5), mobile 

invertebrate feeders (26 and 28%), carnivores (24 and 22%) and omnivores (13%) had a 

larger number on Mercurius and Saveiros than in Taurus (25, 18 and 12%, respectively). 

Planktivores and roving herbivores species were more represented in Taurus (15 and

(6%). Piscivores and territorial herbivores had a more similar abundance of species in 

Mercurius and Taurus (10 and 3%) than in Saveiros (9 and 1%) (Fig. 1-5). 

However, when using Kruskal-Wallis test on the number of species, per dive, in 

each trophic guild for the different vessel reefs, the only significant differences found 

were for the territorial herbivores between Mercurius and Taurus, and Saveiros and 

Taurus (H=10.79, p&lt;0.05; H= 10.30, p&lt;0.05).

(MI) and Carnivores (C). 

  

Regarding the relative abundance of the number of individuals (Fig. 1-6), the 

most represented trophic guilds were mobile invertebrate feeders and planktivores for 

the three vessel reefs, with the first group being more abundant in Taurus (43%) than in 

Mercurius and Saveiros (30%), and the planktivores being more abundant in the two 

deeper reefs (37%) than in Taurus (24%). The carnivorous group showed closer values 

for the three vessels, varying from 11% in Mercurius to 15% in Saveiros. The roving 

herbivores and sessile invertebrate feeders also showed low variation between the 

three vessels, being equal to 8, 7 and 6%, and 2, 2 and 1%, for Saveiros, Mercurius and 

Taurus, respectively. The omnivores were more abundant in number of individuals in 

Mercurius (11%) than in the other two vessels, where they accounted for only 4% in

and 1% respectively, than in the deeper vessel (4 and&amp;lt;0,2%). 

The results of Kruskal-Wallis test, on number of individuals, per dive, in each 

trophic group showed significant differences in the omnivores between Mercurius and 

Saveiros (H=6.65, p&lt;0.05) and Mercurius and Taurus (H= 4.61, p&lt;0.05). Regarding the 

territorial herbivores, significant differences were found between Taurus and Mercurius 

(H=18.52, p&lt;0.05), and Taurus and Saveiros (H=8.90, p&lt;0.05).

Fish community of Mercurius  

A total of 72 species were identified for Mercurius, in 16 dives, belonging to 56 

genera and 35 families (Appendix 1). The 10 families represented by three or more 

species in Mercurius (Fig. 1-7) were: Labridae, with eight species; Epinephelidae, with 

five, Haemulidae and Lutjanidae, with five, Carangidae, with four, and Acanthuridae, 

Gobiidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae with three species. Most of 

these families were abundant (&gt;2%), with the exception of Gobiidae and 

Pomacanthidae, with only 0.6 and 1.4% of relative abundance, respectively (Fig. 1-7). 

Four other families, Scaridae, Scianidae, Holocentridae and Pempheridae, represented 

by two or only one species, had an abundant presence in Mercurius with the other 24 

species only accounting for 6.2% of all the vessels’ abundance.  



Chapter 1- Mercurius

During the dives, 5185 individuals were counted in Mercurius, with the exclusion 

of the large schools, more than 200 individuals, of Mulloidichthys martinicus, 

Opistothonema oglinum, Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna.

The 12 more abundant families (Fig. 1-7) accounted for 4759 fishes, which 

represent about 92% of the total number of individuals. The most abundant families 

were: Haemulidae with 649 individuals (13%); Carangidae with 571 (11%) in which 

Decapterus macarellus and Carangoides bartholomaei were responsible for 65% and  

29% of the family abundance; Labridae with 560 fishes (11%), with two of the eight 

species, Bodianus rufus and Thalassoma noronhanum, together accounting for 54% of 

the abundance; Lutjanidae with 505 fishes (10%), with Lutjanus alexandrei and Ocyurus 

chrysurus accounting for 91% of the family and Pomacentridae with 465 individuals 

(?9%) and Chromis multilineata representing 60% of the family. The families Ephippidae 

(9%), Pempheridae (12%) and Scianidae (6%) despite only being represented by one or 

two species had a high abundance due to their schooling behavior, ranging from a few

schomburgkii.  

The serranids, although with a large number of species (6), were responsible for 

only 2% of fish abundance in Mercurius being surpassed by the acanthurids, 5%, and 

scarids, 3%, with three species, and by the holocentrids with one species, Holocentrus 

adscensionis, totaling 3% of the vessel fish abundance (Fig. 1-7).  

 

 
Figure 1-8. Diversity indices Shannon - H’ (?) and evenness - J’ (?) for Mercurius.  

 

It was possible to observe fluctuations in the values of the diversity measures 

obtained for Mercurius (Fig. 1-8). However, no significant differences were found based 

on the chi-square test for the two indices throughout the study (H’: ?
2
=0.30, p=1.00 and 

J’: ?
2
=0.04, p=1.00). Highest values for the Shannon index were registered in the 14

th
 

and 13
th

 dives, 3.16 and 3.15, respectively. The maximum value for evenness, 0.89, was 

recorded on the 13
th

 dive. The minimum values for Shannon and evenness were found 

in the 3
rd

 dive with 2.45 and 0.70, respectively.   

The number of fish and species richness (Fig. 1-9) showed a more varied pattern 

during the first part of the study until the 11

 dive, with the minimum values occurring 

on the 11
th

 dive (163 individuals) for the number of fish and on the 1

abundant presence in Saveiros.  

 
Figure 1-10. Most representative families in number of species and relative abundance for Saveiros. 

Numbers in parenthesis correspond to the number of species per family and the black bars its

In Saveiros, 4270 individuals were counted, not considering the large frequent 

schools of Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna and one of Decapterus 

macarellus, with an estimated 300 individuals. 

Similar to Mercurius, the 12 most abundant families (relative abundance &gt;2%) 

accounted for up to 94% of Saveiros’ total abundance. The most abundant families 

were: Pempheridae (16%) with 685 individuals of only one species, Pempheris 

schomburgkii; Haemulidae with 520 individuals (12%); Labridae with 472 individuals 

(11%), in which Thalassoma noronhanum accounted for 40% of the family abundance; 

Carangidae, 414 individuals (10%), with Decapterus macarellus representing 60% and 

Carangoides bartholomaei 36%, as the two more abundant species of the family and 

Pomacentridae with 330 (8%), with Chromis multilineata and Abudefduf saxatilis being 

responsible for 98% of the family abundance. The lutjanids had nearly 7% of the total 

abundance in Saveiros, 284 individuals, with Lutjanus synagris being the most abundant 

species of the family, followed by Ocyurus chrysurus, with both accounting for 90% of

Odontoscion dentex and Pareques acuminatus had a similar abundance (3.5% each) 

completing the 7% of the Sciaenidae family. The serranids, although being represented 

by four species, accounted for only 5% of the vessel’s total abundance (Fig. 1-10). The 

acanthurids, scarids and holocentrids had a similar pattern to the one found in 

Mercurius with 5, 3 and 2%, respectively, with the most abundant species in the family 

following the same pattern between vessels (e.g. Acanthurus bahianus, Sparisoma 

axillare and Holocentrus adscensionis). The other 23 species of Saveiros accounted for 

only 3.7% of the total fish abundance of the vessel reef. 

 
Figure 1-11 – Diversity indices Shannon - H’ (?) and evenness - J’ (?) for Saveiros. 

  

Although there was some variation in the diversity indices over the course of the 

dives, no significant differences (H’: ?
2
=0.48, p=1.00 and J’: ?

2
=0.03, p=1.00) were found 

in Saveiros (Fig. 1-11). The highest values for the indices were obtained on the 11
th

 dive 

for Shannon (3.18) and on the 14
th

 for Pielou, 0.89. Shannon’s diversity index showed 

the lowest values in the 5
th

 dive (2.17), whereas Pielou’s evenness had the minimum 

value, 0.75, in the 5
th

 and 7
th

 dives. The 5
th

 and 7
th

 dives also achieved the lowest values 

for the number of fishes and species richness, 129 and 141 individuals and 20 and 23 

species respectively (Fig. 1-12). The greatest richness was obtained in the 10
th

 dive, with 

the 9
th

 being the most numerous one. 

Of the total number of species accounted for in this study, five were only found 

in Saveiros, with their frequency varying from uncommon to rare (Table 1-4).

Taurus, despite being located closer to the coast than the other two vessel reefs, 

had a smaller number of dives, 11. During these dives, 68 species were registered  

belonging to 50 genera and 33 families (Appendix 1), of which only nine families were 

characterized by three or more species (Fig. 1-13). Labridae was the most represented 

family with seven species, followed by Haemulidae, Lutjanidae and Pomacentridae, with 

five species each. The scarids were represented by four species with the other five 

families (Acanthuridae, Carangidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and 

Serranidae/Epinephelidae) having only three species. Holocentridae, Sphyraenidae, 

Mullidae and Scianidae, with two species, and Pempheridae, with only one species, 

were also abundant in Taurus.  

During the study period, 3586 individuals were counted in Taurus, with the 

exclusion of large schools of Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna.

The 12 abundant families (relative abundance of more than 2% of the total 

vessel abundance) totaled 92% of the reef abundance, with the other 28 species, 

including scarids and pomacanthids, accounting for the remaining 8% (Fig. 1-13).

Numbers in parenthesis correspond to the number of species per family and the black bars its

The most abundant family in Taurus was Scianidae, with 520 individuals (?15%), 

with Pareques acuminatus being responsible for 74% of the family abundance. The three 

other families that predominate were: Pempheridae (13.5%), represented exclusively by 

Pempheris schomburgkii; Haemulidae with 457 individuals (12.7%) and Labridae with 

349 fishes (10%), with Thalassoma noronhanum and Bodianus rufus being responsible 

for 40% and 20% of the family abundance. Mullids accounted for nearly 8% of Taurus 

abundance, with 384 individuals, being dominated by Mulloidichthys martinicus, 

differently from Mercurius and Saveiros, where Pseudupeneus maculatus had a stronger 

presence. The lutjanids had an abundance of 6.3%, with Lutjanus synagris and Ocyurus 

chrysurus, with nearly 50% and 36%, respectively. The Sphyraenidae family, with 6% of 

total reef abudance, was represented by only one barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda and 

200 estimated southern sennets, Sphyraena picudilla. Holocentrids accounted for 5.5% 

of the total abundance, with Holocentrus adscensionis being responsible for 90% of the

family, just like in Saveiros. The pomacentrids presented more species in Taurus than in 

any other vessel reef, with 164 fishes (4.6%), with 17% of the family being accounted by 

Stegastes fuscus and S. pictus and the remaining mostly by Chromis multilineata and 

Abudefduf saxatilis with 45% and 37% of the family abundance. Acanthuridae and 

Carangidae had 4% of the total abundance in Taurus, with about 150 individuals each. 

As observed in the other two vessels, the serranids, although having a different number 

of species in each vessel, also displayed a low abundance in Taurus, 3%, with most of 

them being Cephalopholis fulva.

Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s evenness (rs=0.66, p=0.03). The highest values for 

diversity and evenness were registered in the 8

respectively. This dive occurred in September, corresponding to the end of the rainy 

season which explains the low visibility, especially in shallower waters, due both to wind 

and rain.

DISCUSSION 

Community structure 

The development and equilibrium of the reef fish community in the vessel reefs 

can be inferred by the presence of all the 10 families typically considered reef families 

(Robertson, 1998; Bellwood &amp;amp; Wainwright, 2002). According to Bellwood &amp;amp; Wainwright 

(2002), these families (i.e. Acanthuridae, Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Carangidae, 

Chaetodontidae, Holocentridae, Labridae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae) can 

be found in any reef, regardless of its biogeographical location or coral richness. 

Aburto-Oropeza &amp;amp; Balart (2001) and Pérez-España et al. (1996), Fariña et al. 

(2005) and McKenna Jr. (1997) observed that the best represented families found in the 

Gulf of California, Venezuela and México, respectively, were: Serranidae (with the 

Epinephelidae included), Labridae, Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae, Haemulidae and 

Scaridae, which is the pattern observed in this study for the most species-rich families. 

Haemulidae and Labridae are known to be abundant families, in terms of species, in the 

northeastern coast of Brazil (Floeter et al., 2001). 

As far as the Brazilian coast and oceanic islands are concerned, the most 

representative families remain almost the same, with a large importance of: the 

Carangidae family in Parcel Manuel Luiz (Rocha &amp;amp; Rosa, 2001), Porto de Galinhas (PE) 

(Engmann, 2006), Tamandaré (PE) (Ferreira et al., 1995), Arraial do Cabo (RJ) (Ferreira et 

al, 2001), Atol das Rocas (RN) (Rosa &amp;amp; Moura, 1997) and Trindade Island (ES) (Gasparini 

&amp;amp; Floeter, 2001); Gobiidae, Serranidae with the Epinephelidae groupers, and 

Muraenidae in Risca do Zumbi (RN) (Feitoza, 2001) and Coast of the Paraíba state 

(Feitoza, 1999; Rocha et al., 1998) with this last family also showing more species in 

Maracajaú (RN) (Feitosa, 2005; Feitosa et al., 2002). In a study made by Floeter et al. 

(2001), on the geographical variation of reef fish communities along the Brazilian coast, 

Muraenidae, Holocentridae and Chaetodontidae were found to be among the 10 most 

representative families. However, this was not the case in the present study, with these 

families represented by two or only one species.  



Chapter 1- Discussion 

37 

Comparing the number of species and families found in the present study with other 

studies carried out nearby, some similarities can be found. In two studies that took 

place in Porto de Galinhas, a beach 70 km south of Recife, Engmann (2006) registered 89 

species belonging to 41 families, while Silva (2006) only found 74 species in 36 families. 

These differences can be a result of different methodologies used. Although both 

studies applied the transect, the first author used SCUBA dives while the second, despite 

using intensive search, relied on snorkeling to sample the area. Even though the number 

of species varied between these two studies, 89 and 74, the results obtained for the 

vessel reefs were close, varying from 68 to 72. In Tamandaré, also in the south of 

Pernambuco, some 100 km from Recife, Ferreira et al. (1995) found 103 species in 43 

families. However, their study site was located between two river mouths, which clearly 

influenced the composition of the recorded species, with some species associated with 

shallow and even brackish waters (e.g., Gerreidae and Hippocampus redi).   

Diversity, Frequency and Abundance 

The diversity indices calculated for the present study were somewhat higher 

than those obtained for other sites along the Brazilian coast. The mean values for 

Shannon’s diversity ranged between 2.61-2.83, with the lowest value for the shallow 

vessel and the highest values for the two deeper vessels which, when compared to the 

values found in Porto de Galinhas, 1.2-2 (Engmann, 2006), Maragogi, 0.8-0.93 and 

Maracajaú, 2.02-2.63 (Feitosa, 2005), and Arquipélago dos Currais, 2.26-2.46 (Pinheiro, 

2005), indicates a much more diverse fish community in the recently deployed vessel 

reefs. Interestingly, the area and height of the reef has been found to influence species 

richness (Molles, 1978) which could be noted in our study with the highest values of 

Shannon’s diversity found in the larger vessel reefs, Mercurius and Saveiros, than in 

Taurus that is smaller both in size and height. Also, the higher diversity observed for the 

deeper reefs can reflect the importance of depth in the fish diversity and abundance as 

it has been previously reported (e.g., Roberts &amp;amp; Ormond, 1987; Pinheiro, 2005) 

The Shannon results from this study also showed that the diversity found in the 

vessel reefs was greater than in two marine protected areas: Parcel Manuel Luiz, 2.31, 



Chapter 1- Discussion 

38 

(Rocha &amp;amp; Rosa, 2001) and Atol das Rocas, 2.08 (Rocha &amp;amp; Moura, 1997). As mentioned by 

Feitoza (2001), this is probably due to two factors: firstly the number of species in an 

oceanic island is smaller than in coastal reefs due to isolation and typically small shallow  

water area (Floeter et al., 2001) and secondly, the complications in the employed 

sampling technique can result in sub or overestimation. The Shannon index value found 

by Feitoza (2001) in Risca do Zumbi, 2.95, was higher than the ones found in this study, 

and this difference is probably related to the type of methodologies used by that 

author, who used stationary point counts with several replicates in different areas, 

resulting in a much longer sampling period and also clove oil to collect the most cryptic 

species. The dimension and variety of sampled environments (e.g., caves and marine 

plateaus), as seen in Feitoza’s study, can also influence the results obtained for a 

determined study area.  

The almost linear decline of the log abundances observed for the three vessels 

reflects, according to Bohnsack &amp;amp; Bannerot (1986), an undisturbed and highly diverse 

community. However, in this study Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s evenness values 

were higher and more stable for Mercurius and Saveiros than for Taurus. This suggests 

two possibilities: a) that the reef fish in Taurus are under a more intense process of 

community regulation, which is reflected in the variability of the number of species and 

individuals in the vessel, or b) Taurus, as one of the most visited new “shipwrecks” in 

the coast of Recife has been subjected to an intense diving tourism (PNAPE, unpubl. 

data) and the divers impact in settling communities can be reflected in the indices and 

in the number of rare and uncommon species of the vessel reef. One example of the 

probable dynamics of the process of regulation of the fish community can be 

ascertained by the non-occurrence of Ophioblennius trinitatis in Taurus. This territorial 

herbivore is abundant both in shallow and intermediate reefs in the northeastern coast 

and in our study area was only present in one of the deep reefs, when logically it should 

be registered in the shallower one. Many factors affect the founding of herbivore 

territory, such as the abundance of competitors for space and for food resources 

(Ceccarelli, 2007). In Taurus, the presence of two species of damselfish, Stegastes pictus 



Chapter 1- Discussion 

39 

and S. fuscus, might be affecting the establishment of a new species, O. trinitatis, due to 

their territorial nature. Nonetheless, other studies have also found larger values for 

diversity and evenness in greater reefs (e.g., Friedlander &amp;amp; Parrish, 1998) and found it to 

be related with different physical and biological characteristics of the sampled habitats. 

One of the universal characteristics of ecological communities is that some 

species are extremely abundant, some are moderately common and the remaining, 

usually the majority, are rare (Magurran, 2005) represented by only a few individuals. In 

this study the results suggest that the communities, despite having good values for 

diversity and evenness, are eventually still adjusting to changes in their ecological 

structure probably caused by predation, competition and recruitment in the new 

deployed reefs. 

Trophic patterns 

The number of species belonging to each trophic group was close in the three 

vessels. However, the abundance of the different trophic guilds showed a distinct 

pattern for omnivores, planktivores, mobile invertebrate feeders and territorial 

herbivores. 

The higher abundance of omnivores found in Mercurius is a direct result of using 

data of medium schools of common species, in this case four events of more than 50 

individuals of Chaetodipterus faber that accounted for more than half of the total 

omnivores in this vessel reef. This might prove that the use of data from large schools of 

frequently found species in the vessels (e.g., Haemulon aurolineatum and H. 

squamipinna) not only can be very biased for the estimation of large number of 

individuals but also masks the importance of much lower abundance species that have, 

nevertheless, an important ecological function in the community’s structure. 

In this study, the planktivores were one of the most abundant groups in the 

vessel reefs, which is in agreement with other studies about vertical relief on artificial 

reefs (e.g., Rilov &amp;amp; Benayahu, 2000; Lindquist &amp;amp; Pietrafesa, 1989; Stephan &amp;amp; Lindquist, 

1989). Arena et al. (2007) found significant differences in the abundance of planktivores 

in vessel reefs and natural reefs. However, in a study at natural reefs in Zumbi, in the 



Chapter 1- Discussion 

40 

northeastern coast of Brazil (Feitoza, 2001), planktivores were also the main trophic 

group.  

The deployment of a vessel in an area with significant currents can cause 

horseshoe vortexes and thus ressuspension or scouring of the sediment on the reef 

bottom (Lindquist &amp;amp; Pietrafesa, 1989), which in turn causes recycling and regeneration 

of nutrients near the reef. As observed in a previous study on phytoplankton in two 

older vessel reefs in Recife, the abundance of these organisms was higher in the area 

around the vessel than in the middle and upper water column (Santos, 2006). This 

probably reflects the preference of these species for gathering in places with higher 

food resources and thus explains the main aggregation of diurnal planktivores (e.g., 

Chromis multilineata, Thalassoma noronhanum, Decapterus macarellus) that remain at 

a depth near the vessel and not near the surface. Several planktivorous species, like 

Chromis, tend to aggregate in mid-water above and/or around the artificial reefs (Jessee 

et al., 1985) which can also be a reflection of the quantity of organisms associated with 

the open sand plains, which according to Hobson &amp;amp; Chess (1986) can be rich and 

abundant and can be exposed by burrowing or feeding habits of species such as 

Dasyatis americana and Pseudupeneus maculatus. 

In this study, although a higher number of planktivorous species were found in 

the shallower vessel, a higher abundance of fish were observed in the deeper reefs, 

Mercurius and Saveiros, which matches the results obtained in a study on artificial reefs 

in the south coast of Brazil (Pinheiro, 2005), in the deep reefs in Marshall Islands 

(Thresher &amp;amp; Colin, 1986) and in coastal reefs in Hawaii (Friedlander &amp;amp; Parrish, 1998). In 

the latter study, the authors found that planktivores had a positive relationship with 

depth, being more abundant along the deep reef slope and that their distribution 

pattern must be related to the abundance of their major prey in deeper waters (Hobson 

&amp;amp; Chess, 1986). This concurs with findings by Santos (2006) in which the values for 

chlorophyll a found in the deeper vessel reef were superior to the ones found in a 

shallower vessel nearer the shore of Recife.  



Chapter 1- Discussion 

41 

Mobile invertebrate feeders are usually, by far, the most important fraction of 

benthic invertebrate predators, being equally important at inshore, midshelf and outer 

shelf reefs (Jones et al., 1991). These animals usually feed on high caloric food 

resources, like crabs and mollusks, which are abundant on hard and soft substratum 

(Harmelin-Vivien, 2002; Jones et al., 1991). As found in a complementary study, a part of 

the PNAPE project (Costa et al., in prep), the sediments on both sides of the Mercurius 

and Saveiros are mainly composed of very coarse to medium sand with some granules. 

This supports the idea of re-suspension and displacement of the bottom material in our 

study area resulting in the exposure of small burrows in the substrate surrounding the 

vessels, which allied to naturally existing small rocks, attract fishes and invertebrates. 

Some fishes use them for shelter and, in some cases, feeding grounds. Examples are 

diurnal planktivores, such as Ptereleotris randalli or Opistognathus aurifrons, and 

carnivorous species like Scorpaena plumieri. The distribution and abundance of benthic 

macroinvertebrates is mostly related with the type of substrate and the frequency and 

intensity of disturbances in the habitat, with stable environments (e.g., tropical waters) 

presenting the most diverse fauna (Sanders Jr., 1968). Regarding the type of substrate, 

in a study conducted in the southernmost state of Brazil, Capítoli &amp;amp; Bemvenuti (2004) 

found the highest diversity of benthic invertebrates in areas of highest substrate 

diversity, with the dominance of sand, gravel and some mud, at depths of 20-30m. Using 

this information, it can be thought that the greatest occurrence of mobile invertebrate 

feeders in the shallower vessel is probably a reflection of the complexity of the 

substrate around the vessel which lodges a great variety of invertebrate (occurring with 

all three vessels) and the intermediate level of disturbance of the substrate by currents 

which is more intense in shallow depths.  

In a study in the Caribbean, Dominici-Arosemena &amp;amp; Wolff (2005) observed that 

mobile invertebrate feeders tended to increase their abundance and diversity from the 

sheltered to the exposed areas, which can be the case in this study for Taurus, as it is 

smaller than the other two vessel reefs, thus originating less available shelter for the 

fishes. However, in the individual species analysis it could be observed that the highest 



Chapter 1- Discussion 

42 

values of mobile invertebrate feeders in Taurus, when comparing with the other two 

vessels, were due to the presence of larger numbers of Haemulon plumieri, H. parra and 

Mulloidichthys martinicus. There may be two main reasons for this: in the two deeper 

vessels enormous schools of H. aurolineatum and/or H. squamipinna that almost cover 

the entire vessels are constantly present while in Taurus the schools are somewhat 

smaller, which can result in a “camouflage” effect of these large schools in species that 

look alike (e.g., Haemulon squamipinna with H. plumieri and H. aurolineatum with M. 

martinicus and H. parra). On the other hand, H. parra and H. plumieri do not school in 

such large numbers as H. aurolineatum and H. squamipinna, probably due to their larger 

sizes, and therefore their numbers are probably not so biased in Taurus as they could be 

in Mercurius or Saveiros. 

Submerged vegetation creates an availability of resources, such as shelter and 

food, affecting the distribution patterns of herbivores, invertebrate feeders and 

omnivores who prey on the associated epifauna (Anderson, 1994; Garpe, 2007). 

Regarding the herbivores, two patterns arose from the comparison between vessel 

reefs: Taurus presented more roving herbivore species than the deeper vessels which in 

turn had a larger number of fishes even when comparing the mean number of 

herbivores per dive; and Taurus showed the same number of territorial herbivorous 

species than another deeper vessel, Mercurius, but a much larger number of individuals.  

The roving herbivores dwell on reefs and migrate during the day to seagrass beds 

for feeding (Ogden &amp;amp; Zieman, 1977). This may allow a larger distribution pattern and 

result in a small dependence on the development of algae and other organisms in which 

they feed on the reef, for they can forage for food in nearby vegetation. On the other 

hand, territorial herbivores remain in their protected area for shelter and feed (Jan et 

al., 2003; Letourneur et al., 1997) and although territory size can vary between species 

and locations (Ceccarelli, 2007) it is logical that the type and abundance of food 

resources will affect the number of these small fishes. The fact that a larger number of 

territorial herbivores were present in Taurus than in the deeper vessels is probably 

related to the more abundant macroalgae coverage and diversity at depths around 20 m 



Chapter 1- Discussion 

43 

than near the 30 m isobath, as shown in a study on the Gaibú, just south of Recife 

(Pereira et al., 2007), meaning that a greater amount of algae is available in Taurus than 

in Mercurius and Saveiros. As the numbers and abundances of roving herbivores were 

somewhat similar in the three vessel reefs, it suggests that food is not as limiting for 

these species as their need for shelter. Dominici-Arosemena &amp;amp; Wolff (2005) found that 

herbivores, like scarids, increased their numbers in sheltered zones which helps to 

explain that one important factor for the regulation of their abundance is their 

dependence for shelter. This can be observed in our study by the larger abundance of 

roving herbivores occurring in Mercurius and Saveiros which have a larger size (29,1 m x 

7,4 m) than Taurus (26 m x 7 m), with size also acting as visual/audio stimulant and 

spatial reference for fish (Anderson et al., 1989; Jessee et al., 1985). 

Several factors have been related to the distribution of fish species on coral reefs 

like substrate complexity, food and shelter availability, presence of currents, etc. 

(Williams, 1991). Reef morphology however seems to be one of the main factors that 

determines the organization of the reef fish communities (Letourneur, 1996) because it 

determines the existence of adequate shelter for some important species. The 

availability of large inner open spaces in the reef, although ideal for some nocturnal 

planktivores species that tend to aggregate (e.g., Pempheris schomburgkii and 

Odontoscion dentex), might constitute a limiting factor for other species that prefer 

more “customized” elements in the reef (e.g., small openings or holes with sizes near 

the fish’s own size) and vessels, concrete pieces and the so-used Reef Balls
®
 are known 

to have a poor surface/area ratio and complexity (Figley, 2003).  

In the present study, some families did not present the expected patterns in 

terms of species number (e.g., muraenidae and gobiidae) probably due to two main 

factors. Muraenids are known to remain hidden in holes and crevices during the day, 

foraging at night (Randall, 1967) and therefore one of the main reasons for the low 

counts of Muraenidae species registered in all three vessel reefs was probably due to 

the lack of appropriate holes for the size of these fishes. This might suggest that shelter 

from predation can be more important than food, in determining the presence and 



Chapter 1- Discussion

abundance of some species (Hixon &amp;amp; Beets, 1989). Supporting these results is the fact 

that the taxonomic lists obtained in several studies in the northeastern coast of Brazil 

(Engmann, 2006; Rocha et al., 1998) report Muraenidae as a species-rich family. The low 

number of gobiidae species in the vessel reefs, and surrounding area was due to the 

type of methodology used. In a previous study carried out in the coast of Paraíba, the 

state just north of Pernambuco where this project took place, Feitoza et al. (2005) 

registered 10 species of gobiids inhabiting intermediate coastal waters and this author 

also found 6 species of this family in intermediate reefs of Zumbi, in the coast of Rio 

Grande do Norte, the state north of Paraíba (Feitoza, 2001). These results show that a 

larger number of gobiids could probably be found in our vessel reefs but were not 

identified as a result of the census techniques employed, as both the studies mentioned 

above used fish anaesthetics to collect and identify specimens.  

Although there were some differences observed, between the vessel reefs and 

other natural reefs in northeastern Brazil, the structure of the artificial reefs fish 

communities was mostly similar to the patterns observed in the natural ones. The main 

differences found (e.g., biological indices values) were probably influenced by the 

structural characteristics of the compared areas and differences regarding the used 

methodologies (e.g., the use of transect versus stationary point counts; the use of clove 

oil). In spite of this, the vessel reefs showed a diverse community, and although 

regulation processes are still taking place, especially in the shallower artificial reef, the 

reefs prove themselves capable of offering shelter and food to most of the typically 

found species in the area.

CHAPTER 2. COLONIZATION AND ECOLOGIC SUCESSION IN TWO 
VESSEL REEFS ON THE COAST OF RECIFE (PE) - BRAZIL



Chapter 2- Introduction 
 

46 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Any newly available patch of habitat is subject to colonization by organisms, 

which are prepared to colonize unoccupied environments (Valiela, 1995). The 

colonization of a reef is the result of the dispersion and settlement of pelagic larvae 

and/or immigration of juveniles and adults (Matthews, 1985; Carr &amp;amp; Hixon, 1997). 

According to Solonski (1985), individuals from suboptimal habitats may move to more 

optimal areas when new habitat or food becomes available, and this type of 

colonization may occur from species living in nearby natural reefs or those without a 

territory. These movements will depend on the diversity and health of the local 

ecosystem and on the populations it shelters, for that will determine the pool of 

available species to colonize the new habitats (Caley &amp;amp; Schluter, 1997; Belyea &amp;amp; 

Lancaster, 1999).  

It has been suggested that inter and intra specific interactions pose as the main 

limits for the coexistence and diversity in natural communities (e.g., MacArthur &amp;amp; 

Levins, 1967). However, it is now accepted that the structure and dynamics of these 

communities is the outcome of both interactions of biotic and environmental factors 

(Menge &amp;amp; Sutherland 1976; Dunson &amp;amp; Travis 1991). Thus, as a consequence of the 

complex interactions among species (e.g competition, predation, facilitation) and 

temporal and spatial stochastic variations (e.g., recruitment), the structure of fish 

communities in different locations cannot be predicted (Doherty, 1991; Hixon, 1991; 

Sale, 1991). According to Munday et al. (2001), different combinations of resource 

overlap, competitive abilities, and competitive outcomes are expected to be found in 

communities where species coexist.  

It is possible to compare artificial reefs relying on the list of species that inhabit 

them, as the presence/absence of certain species might provide an indication of the 

nature of these habitats (Bortone &amp;amp; Bohnsack, 1991). Several reasons, such as the reefs’ 

geometric configuration, the behavioral features and abundance of species present and 

even possible variations between the ability of different observers to see and identify

some species, may determine the chances to register the occurrence of a given species, 

so caution must be taken when using this approach (Harmelin-Vivien et al., 1985; 

Bortone &amp;amp; Bohnsack, 1991), both in sites subject to human interference or not. 

 Tourism is one of the most remarkable socio-economic phenomena of the 

twentieth century, with earnings from international tourism reaching US$ 476 billion 

which is larger than the export value of any other single category of product or service, 

including petroleum products (Neto, 2002). “Diving has become a booming branch of 

the tourism business”, and differently from the general tourism, this activity targets 

small coastal areas in tropical countries, mostly with poorly developed economies (Van 

Treeck &amp;amp; Schuhmacher, 1998). Several studies have been conducted in coral reefs to 

determine the impacts of the diving activity (e.g., Hawkins et al., 1999; Tratalos &amp;amp; 

Austin, 2001; Uyarra &amp;amp; Côté, 2007) with many regarding only the effects on the coral 

community. Although it has been found that coral reefs endure physical contact by 

divers, this impact is reflected in the loss of large massive corals (Hawkins &amp;amp; Roberts, 

1993). Regarding fish communities, however, no significant impact has been found, 

although studies using electronic devices have reported the avoidance reactions of 

several fish species to the presence of divers (e.g., Stanley &amp;amp; Wilson, 1995; Schmidt &amp;amp; 

Gassner, 2006). Nevertheless, in the northeastern coast of Brazil, two studies on the 

impact of marine tourism, both on trampling and diving, have concluded that the main 

factor influencing the fish community was the offer of food by tourists, which could be 

attracting some “opportunistic” species, thereby changing the overall trophic structure 

of the communities (Feitosa, 2005; Engmann, 2006). 

In order to identify the influence of recreational diving on the colonization 

process of reef fish in artificial reefs, two identical vessel reefs, one open to recreational 

dives and the other only to scientific dives done within the framework of the present 

study, were compared after a year of deployment, through the characterization of the 

fish assemblages by the use of trophic guilds and spatial categories. A brief evaluation 

and comparison was made on the visual census methodology used, observing the 

influence of divers’ presence in the studied spatial categories.

METHODS 

Study site  

The data for this study were collected from two vessel reefs, Mercurius and 

Saveiros, located on the coast of Recife (PE) in northeastern Brazil (Fig. 2-1), as 

mentioned earlier (see Study area). The two vessels were chosen for their similarity in 

terms of size and deployment area, sampling similarity (e.g., the number of dives and 

the beginning of the sampling period) and differential usage, with Saveiros open for 

recreational diving and Mercurius only available for research dives.

Data analysis 

To confirm if the sampling period was adequate, a cumulative curve was plotted 

with the number of species registered throughout the dives. According to Begon et al. 

(2006), sampling is considered adequate when the cumulative number of species 

stabilizes. 

For the analyses of colonization, each fish species registered during the dives 

was assigned to a category according to its spatial distribution (adapted from Nakamura, 

1985 and Okubo &amp;amp; Kakimoto, 1991), with: A – species that prefer physical contact with 

the reef; B – species that are associated to the reef by vision and sound; C – species that 

remain in the water column; and D – species that use the area/surroundings of the reef 

(Fig. 2-2). . This allows the study of specific groups that share functional relationships, 

allowing the comparison of similarities of unrelated species.  

To compare differences between the number of species belonging to each 

spatial category, throughout the study period, a chi-square test was used.

Nakamura, 1985 and Okubo &amp;amp; Kakimoto, 1991). 



Chapter 2- Methods  
 

 

50 

 

Species were also assigned a trophic category based on visual observations and 

available literature (Randall, 1967; Feitoza, 2001; Dominici-Arosemena &amp;amp; Wolff, 2005; 

Halpern &amp;amp; Floeter, 2008). The eight trophic groups, following Ferreira et al. (2004), 

were: C – Carnivorous; O – Omnivores; MI – Mobile Invertebrate feeders; P – Piscivores; 

PL – Planktivores; RH – Roving Herbivores; SI – Sessile Invertebrate feeders and TH – 

Territorial Herbivores. Frequency classes were also used with: very common (VC) - 

&gt;80%; common (C) – 51-80%; occasional (O) – 21-50%; uncommon (U) – 11-20% and 

rare (R) with&amp;lt;10% of occurrence. 

Hierarchical cluster analysis, using the Bray-Curtis similarity index (Bloom, 1981) 

based on a presence/absence matrix was used to evaluate the colonization process and 

resemblance between reef fish assemblages. Presence/abundance data was used as it 

confers the same weight to abundant and rare species (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 2001). A non-

metric multidimensional scaling ordination (MDS) was also used to evaluate spatial and 

temporal differences in the communities (Field et al., 1982) between both vessel reefs. 

One-way ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarity) and SIMPER (Similarity Percentage 

Analysis) routine were used to examine the potential differences in the studied 

assemblages among sites and dives and to identify the species responsible for the 

dissimilarity between the obtained groups. All the multivariate analyses were conducted 

using the PRIMER 6? ® software (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 2001).

RESULTS 

From July 2006 to July 2007, a total of 80 species were registered, with 72 for 

Mercurius in sixteen dives and 69 for Saveiros during seventeen surveys (Appendix 4). 

The cumulative curves for the number of species were similar for the two vessels (Fig. 2-

3). In the first dive on July 2006, 27 species were found in Mercurius and 24 in Saveiros. 

For Mercurius, the number of species increased sharply in the first two months of 

sampling, four months after the deployment of the vessel, with a subsequent moderate 

but steady increase from September to March reaching 68 species. From March on, 

there was only the addition of one or two species per dive. For Saveiros, a constant 

increase was registered, from July to February, when the number of species reached 68. 

From March on there was only the addition of one new species until July 2007. From 

September to March, Saveiros had a greater number of recorded species than 

Mercurius, with a difference ranging from 1 to 6 species.  

 

 

Figure 2-3. Cumulative curve of number of species observed in Mercurius and Saveiros. 

 

During the study, a differential increase in the different trophic categories (Fig. 2-

4) was observed. It was possible to distinguish a sharper increase in the number of 

omnivores, carnivores and mobile invertebrate feeders, with a rise varying from eight to 

10 species in each category. The sessile invertebrate feeders, piscivores and planktivores

started with few species (one to three species), and by the 11
th

 month had attained four 

species, for the former group, and an increase of four to six species for the other two. 

The roving herbivores were recorded from the beginning with five and three species, 

and gained two and four species, reaching seven species by the 7
th

 month, for both 

vessels. The territorial herbivores were the last species to appear, with Stegastes pictus 

and Ophioblennius trinitatis in Mercurius and only S. pictus in Saveiros.

pelagic, species (12) than D, substrate related, species (8), while for Saveiros the opposite was 

found, with 10 type D species and only 7 type C species (Appendix 4). The number of species in 

each spatial category, throughout the sampling period, was very similar for the two vessels 

(Table 2-1), with no significant differences between the two (p&gt;0.05). Almost every frequency

For types B or reef associated species, and D or substrate related species there was 

a very abundant spatial group (very common for the first and occasional for the second) 

followed by a second abundant group (occasional and/or common for B and rare for D).  

For group B, the rare and uncommon species were better represented in Saveiros than in 

Mercurius, and common, uncommon and very common species for type D, in both reefs. 

Type A, or reef attached, species were represented very differently in the vessel reefs, 

with uncommon and rare as the more abundant classes followed by very common and 

occasional for Mercurius while for Saveiros, the most abundant classes were occasional 

followed by uncommon and then common and rare with the same number. The 

distribution observed for type C, or pelagic, species was not satisfactory due to the 

absence of very common species, which represented 25-30% of the total number of 

species (Chapter 1) and the lack of a pattern for the frequency classes, showing an almost 

opposite pattern of species frequency classes in the two vessels.

categories in Saveiros. N is the total number of species belonging to each spatial category. 

As expected, not all spatial categories are well represented in every trophic group, 

due to the relation of some feeding habits to predetermined spatial movements. From the

eight trophic groups three (mobile invertebrate feeders – MI, omnivores – O and 

Planktivores – PL) were observed in all spatial categories, one (piscivores – P) in three 

categories, one (roving herbivores – RH) in two categories and two trophic groups (sessile 

invertebrate feeders and territorial herbivores) in only one spatial category (Table 2-2). 

Regarding the remaining trophic group, the carnivores, they were present in all spatial 

groups in Mercurius but in Saveiros, although carnivorous species were observed in type A, 

B and D groups, there was no record of pelagic carnivores.

Based on the qualitative analysis, most species showed a similar colonization 

pattern, with several species that were first registered in one vessel occurring in a brief 

interval, up to two months, in the other one (Appendix 4). From a total of 80 species, only 

13 (16.3%) showed a different pattern in the colonization of Mercurius and Saveiros, with 

the greatest disparity concerning Epinephelus adscensionis and Gnatholepis thompsoni that 

were registered in the 4

 month and 6

 in Saveiros and only in the 15

Mercurius, and Mulloidichthys martinicus that was listed in Mercurius six months before it 

appeared in Saveiros.   

The 2-dimensional MDS, despite the great similarity (&gt;50%) found among every 

sample, distinguishes Mercurius from Saveiros (Figure 2-7). The differences found in the 4
th

 

dive in Mercurius and the 5
th

 and 7
th

 dive of Saveiros were mostly due to the smaller 

number of species observed in those dives, ?22, than in any other which was always 

superior to 24 species. Although the R-statistic generated by the ANOSIM, R = 0.203, 

implied little segregation between the two vessel-reefs, the p-value of &amp;lt;0.05 showed that 

there was a significant difference between Mercurius and Saveiros.  

 

Figure 2-7. The 2 dimensional MDS configuration for the dives (numbers) made in Mercurius (?) and 
Saveiros (?).  

 From the cluster analysis for both vessels (Figure 2-8 and 2-9) it was possible to 

observe the different capacity of each spatial category to describe the dives throughout the 

study period. In the clusters using all species, it can be observed that almost every dive for 

Mercurius and Saveiros showed a similarity of more than 60%, with the exception of dives 

#5 and 7 in Saveiros, for the above mentioned reason. It can also be noted that in both 

vessels, the first four dives are separated from the rest (Figure 2-8 – I, II and Figure 2-9 – III, 

IV).

Type A, reef attached species, presented a similarity of about 50% for most dives in 

both vessels, with the exception of dive #5 in Saveiros. For type C, pelagic species, there was 

a similarity of 20% in Mercurius in all dives and about 15% for Saveiros, without dives #5, 13 

and 14 for the latter (these represented by IX in Figure 2-9). However, for Mercurius, types 

A and C showed a gradual separation between dives while for Saveiros there was a more 

clustered distribution of the dives, showing groups of samples. Type C species showed a 

different pattern for each of the vessel reefs. For Mercurius, it was possible to see a good 

connection between most dives, with 12 dives (75%) with a similarity of about 45%, with a  

similarity among all dives of ?20%. In Saveiros, with a smaller number of C species, the 

difference between clusters was larger with three dives (#12, 13 and 14) showing a 

resemblance of 0% and the similarity for 75% of all dives of only ?25%. For type A, reef 

attached, species there was a somewhat different pattern between vessels, with Mercurius 

showing a gradual separation of the dives, with about 80% of the dives having a similarity of 

?60% and Saveiros presenting the groups in clusters, with a reasonable temporal continuity 

for the dives, with nearly 80% of the samples showing a similarity of ?50%.

The cluster analysis for type D showed an extremely high similarity between many 

of the samples, with Saveiros having more type D species than Mercurius, and both showing 

complete similarity for some of the dives (Figure 2-8 – VII and Figure 2-9 – X). 

Type B species, for Saveiros, distinguished the first dives in one cluster and the last 

dives in another (Figure 2-8 –VII, VIII), with the exception of dives #5 and 7 as mentioned 

above, showing a strong similarity of more than 65% between all dives. For Mercurius, 

despite the similarity of about 70% between every dive, it is possible to see three groups 

(Figure 2-8 – III, IV, V). By comparing the cluster analyses using every species and type B 

species, it is possible to see the resemblance of both plots on the distribution of the dives in 

the study period, with an almost complete match for Saveiros (Figure 2-9 – I, II, III, IV with V, 

VI, VII, VII) and a small difference but with very good similarity between the groups of 

Mercurius (Figure 2-8 – I, II and IV, V).

DISCUSSION 

Species colonization 

The fish colonization in both vessels was similar, with a rapid increase in the first 

months and a more moderate growth in the following months for Mercurius and a 

constant increase throughout the study period for Saveiros. Less than one year after 

deployment, the fish assemblages in both vessels appear to have reached stability 

within a timeframe already observed both in tropical and temperate environments 

(Randall, 1963; Ogden &amp;amp; Ebersole, 1981; Golani &amp;amp; Diamant, 1999; Jardeweski &amp;amp; 

Almeida, 2005; Leitão et al., 2008; ).  

The two vessel reefs presented similar results regarding trophic and spatial 

distribution, with the main difference being found regarding the species present in each 

reef. This agrees with Sherman et al. (2001) who found that different results may be 

obtained for artificial reefs within the same geographical area. 

In a study conducted by Randall (1963) on an artificial reef in the U.S. Virgin 

Islands, the author registered all species arriving on the reef until the 10
th

 month, but 

from then until the 14
th

 month no increase in the number of species was observed, with 

only a change in the number of individuals and a “reduction in the number of small 

fishes and an increase in the larger ones” (Randall, 1963; Ogden &amp;amp; Ebersole, 1981).  

The results from the present study were compared to those of Randall (1963) 

due to their resemblance regarding climatic conditions, as both studies were located in 

tropical areas, and deployment time, with Randall Reef being deployed  in April and our 

vessels in May. Although it was not possible to sample the artificial reefs in the initial 

period of the study, due to bad sea conditions and water visibility, the reefs were 

compared from the third month on. The species encountered in the first months in the 

vessel-reefs were mostly the same, with Holocentrus adscensionis, Pseudupeneus 

maculatus, Ocyurus chrysurus, Chaetodon striatus, Alphestes afer, Halichoeres poeyi, all 

the three species of Acanthuridae, and even Thalassoma noronhanum, the sister species 

of T. bifasciatum (Costagliola et al., 2004) being registered from the beginning of the 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

60 

 

dives, just as described by Randall (1963). Despite the similarity in the pattern observed 

in Randall Reef and our reefs, some species showed a marked difference in the time of 

arrival to the new habitat (e.g., most Halichoeres and Ophioblennius trinitatis).  

The Labridae are an interesting case, with the appearance of H. poeyi, the 

generalist wrasse found both in inshore reefs and seagrass beds (Randall, 1967), in the 

beginning of both studies, which in our case is probably related to its high frequency of 

occurrence and abundance in the northeastern coast of Brazil (Feitoza, 2001; Feitosa, 

2005; Engmann, 2006), where it occurs from shallow to intermediate-deep reefs 

(Feitoza, 1999).  

Another species with the same early arrival, for the same reasons as H. poeyi, 

was the reef-specialist H. brasiliensis, with its sister species H. radiatus (Rocha et al., 

2005) being the last Halichoeres to arrive in Randall Reef. An inverse pattern was 

observed with H. bivittatus and H. maculipinna which were present in Randall Reef from 

the 1
st

 and 2
nd

 month but that only arrived in both our vessel-reefs in the 8
th

 and 6
th

 

months. It is believed that this difference in arrival time is related with the distribution 

of these species and especially in the location of the reef, because Randall Reef is 

situated at depths of around 9 m and our reefs are at a distance of more than 5 nautical 

miles from the coast and at a depth of nearly 30 m. Halichoeres bivittatus was reported 

as having a smaller abundance than other species of the genus Halichoeres in both 

coastal reefs of Pernambuco (Engmann, 2006) and in 15 m deep shipwrecks in Paraíba 

(Feitoza, 1999). Even though it is a generalist species occurring in reef and non-reef 

habitats (Rocha et al., 2005), this species is probably not able to compete with the 

already established H. poeyi and H. brasiliensis, only succeeding after settlement of the 

other Halichoeres species. As shown by Nagelkerken et al. (2000b), the utilization of the 

biotope is very specific to different species and even closely related species seem to 

have a clear spatial separation resulting from avoidance of competition. 

The early presence of H. maculipinna in Randall Reef can be due to the fast 

colonization of their preferred benthic invertebrate prey, polychaetes (Randall, 1967) on 

the artificial reef, which has been shown to begin as soon as two weeks after the 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

61 

 

deployment of concrete modules in a study in Hawaii (Bailey-Brock, 1989), with 

environmental variables (e.g., depth and grain size) affecting polychaete species 

composition (Fukunaga &amp;amp; Bailey-Brock, 2008). In our study, its pair sister species H. 

penrosei (Rocha, 2004) was only observed from the 6
th

 month on, which could be due to 

misidentification in the first dives of juveniles of H. penrosei and of Thalassoma 

noronhanum, which have a great resemblance in their color pattern.  

The late appearance in the deep vessel-reefs of Ophioblennius trinitatis, a hard 

bottom and crevice associated species (Ferreira et al., 1995), and Stegastes pictus, a 

damselfish that usually inhabits cold and deep waters (Ferreira et al., 1998; Feitoza, 

1999), is probably due to their limited mobility and small home range often associated 

with territorial herbivores (Labelle &amp;amp; Nursall, 1985; Osório et al., 2006). However, their 

arrival in the reefs was probably related to the patches of algae existing in the 

substratum, that can provide shelter for many marine invertebrates and small fishes 

(Parrish, 1989) and allow them to forage in unvegetated areas, acting thus as “sheltered 

bases” (Orth et al., 1984). 

Trophic patterns 

From the continuous analyses of the number of species belonging to each of the 

trophic groups, it can be observed that the numbers of mobile invertebrate feeders and 

roving herbivores decrease in total relative abundance as can be expected for these 

species that are usually associated with sand and algae beds and can swim large 

distances, up to several kilometers, to forage (Hobson, 1973). Even so, the number of 

mobile invertebrate feeders increased more than the number of roving herbivores, 

which is probably related to the increase in the number of mobile invertebrate species 

(e.g., shrimps, sea urchins) due to the continuous formation of sand cavities on the base 

of the reef by currents and by the enhancement of the surface area for benthic 

organisms that provide shelter for both fishes and mobile invertebrates (Bohnsack et al., 

1994; Burgess et al., 2003; Figley, 2003).  

The eight species of roving herbivores recorded in this study represent most of 

the known species for the northeastern coast of Brazil, with the pelagic species 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

62 

 

Kyphosus sectatrix, the whole Acanthuridae family and four of the seven species of 

Scaridae (Moura et al., 2001) being present. The scaridae Cryptotomus roseus, Scarus 

trispinosus and Sparisoma amplum had not arrived in the two vessel reefs after one year 

of study. The absence of C. roseus can be explained by its preference for waters deeper 

than 30m (Feitoza, 1999), proved by their lack of occurrence in shallow coastal reefs 

such as Porto de Galinhas – PE (Engmann, 2006), Tamandaré – PE (Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 

2006) and Maragogi – AL (Feitosa, 2005). On the other hand, the lack of S. trispinosus 

and S. amplum is probably time related. This shows that this trophic guild was well 

represented in our study. An interesting observation is that juvenile scarids usually use 

the algae beds, in the vicinity of the vessel reefs as both shelter and feeding grounds 

with these sites acting as nurseries, as has been observed by Ogden &amp;amp; Zieman (1977) in 

St. Croix, Virgin Islands. 

The strong initial presence in the vessel reefs and gradual decrease during the 

course of the study, of both mobile invertebrate feeders and roving herbivores, shows 

that these species probably used the reef and were important in the colonization 

process, having a fundamental role in the energy transfer to the reef. Mobile 

invertebrate feeders, such as haemulids, holocentrids and scianids, are known to be 

important commuters that shelter on/near the reef and forage in the surrounding areas, 

acting as transport agents of nutrients to the reef (Parrish, 1989; Meyer et al., 2000; 

Beets et al., 2003).  

The trophic groups that showed an increase in relative abundance were the 

omnivores and the planktivores. This increment in the number of species was probably 

related to greater food availability in the vessel reefs over time, with both plant and 

animal material for the omnivorous species and with an increase in the biomass of 

phytoplankton available in the water column above the reefs, for the planktivores. Large 

planktivorous feeding aggregations have been associated to the increase of nutrients in 

the vicinity and in reefs, by providing the nutrients that potentially limit the growth of 

macroalgae and also as part of the food web by feeding mobile invertebrates (Bray &amp;amp; 

Miller, 1985). According to Kingsford &amp;amp; MacDiarmid (1988), planktivore biomass can 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

63 

 

also sustain populations of piscivorous fishes. However, in our study the relative 

abundance in the number of piscivorous species decreased over time, but this is 

probably more related to the fact that most of these species (&gt;50%) are pelagic (e.g., 

Carangidae and Scombridae) and their sighting can be considered, most of the times, 

occasional, as reported by Bohnsack &amp;amp; Bannerot (1986). Nevertheless, as pointed out by 

Campos &amp;amp; Gamboa (1989) and Herrera et al. (2002), artificial modules can act as 

aggregation points for pelagic species such as carangids. 

All four species of sessile invertebrate feeders were already present by the 7
th

 

month, with Holancanthus tricolor being the last species to arrive, probably due to the 

fact that it is not very abundant in coastal reefs of the northeastern coast of Brazil, with 

no quantitative data of its presence in the coast of Pernambuco, such as at Porto de 

Galinhas and Tamandaré (Engmann, 2006; Ferreira &amp;amp; Maida, 2006;). However, in a study 

in the coast of Rio Grande no Norte, Feitoza (2001) observed that in every habitat he 

sampled H. tricolor was always the least abundant species of three species of 

Pomacanthids.  

Spatial categories and census detection 

The use of visual census have been proved cost-effective for estimates of 

biodiversity and abundance of reef fish communities (Bohnsack et al., 1999) and has 

been assumed as the best non-destructive method for population assessment (Brock, 

1982) being superior to several other techniques in habitats of great heterogeneity (De 

Girolamo &amp;amp; Mazzoldi, 2001). Nevertheless, the data gathered by this method has to be 

accepted, most of the time, without an independent confirmation through another 

technique (Smith-Vaniz et al., 2006) and several sources of bias have been identified, 

such as observer presence and speed (Lincoln Smith, 1988) and fish behavior (Russell et 

al., 1978; Kulbicki, 1998; Willis et al., 2000). As previously mentioned, visual census 

techniques also tend to underestimate the number and abundance of cryptic species 

(Kulbicki, 1990; Willis, 2001; Ackerman &amp;amp; Bellwood, 2002; Smith-Vaniz et al., 2006) and 

also of nocturnal species, such as Holocentridae and Apogonidae, that tend to remain 

hidden during the day (Kulbicki, 1990), which in our case was inside the cabin and deck, 



Chapter 2- Discussion

making them difficult to detect and count. As a result, we have evaluated the biological 

community by a mixture of visual census methodologies that we found to be suitable for 

the studied reefs in order to reduce the inherent error associated with simple 

techniques. The monthly sampling was proven satisfactory for our methodology, 

allowing us to observe the shaping of the community structure (Brotto et al., 2007) 

throughout the study period.  

In this study, we chose to add another category to the Nakamura classification 

because even though there are some resemblances between type A and type D species, 

we noted that most species were found consistently in one habitat (vessel reef or the 

surrounding area) making it necessary to separate such species for a better analysis.  

  Through the cluster analysis for each vessel it was possible to observe a pattern 

in the distribution of the dives. In an individualist analysis, we saw that clusters of type A 

and type C species indicate a similar pattern regardless of their similarity between dives, 

which is probably related to their behavior pattern at a diver’s approach, with type A 

species hiding in crevices/holes and type C species fleeing the site. This creates a larger 

chance to observe these species, during a sampling dive in a known vessel reef area, 

than type C species that can easily disappear in the water column, returning only after 

the last diver has emerged.  

 The clusters for type C species obtained for both vessels were not very 

satisfactory for the colonization process because although they created groups of dives, 

those dives did not have a temporal continuity. However, an interesting pattern arose 

with Saveiros, open for recreational diving, having not only a smaller number of pelagic 

species but a lower similarity between dives than Mercurius. This shows that although it 

is easier to identify and register pelagic species in non impacted sites such as Mercurius, 

in neither reef is the use of pelagic species as an indicator of the colonization desirable. 

It has been previously reported that several highly mobile pelagic species (e.g., 

Carangidae) can be erroneously enumerated by underwater visual census (Buckley &amp;amp; 

Hueckel, 1985; Kulbicki, 1998) or avoid divers in locations with some degree of 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

65 

 

anthropogenic impact, most usually regarding fishing (Russell, 1977 in Russell et al., 

1978; Guidetti et al., 2008).  

Type A species were consistently more numerous in Saveiros than in Mercurius 

throughout the study period, and even species that were similar to both vessel reefs 

were always registered first in Saveiros, with the exception of Ginglymostoma cirratum 

and some species that arrived at the same time in the reefs. The cluster analysis for this 

group shows a different pattern for each of the studied vessels, even though they 

started with the same number of species. Whilst in Saveiros there was the partitioning 

of the dives in two main clusters, in Mercurius although there were also two clusters, 

there was a more gradual separation of the dives. The fact that there is no temporal 

continuity in either vessel is probably related to the large number of species observed 

only after six months (approximately 50%) and also to the stabilization of the 

community, composed by these species, both with the appearance of new species and 

the restructuring of the old ones. 

In type A species we included: (1) species that use complex spaces in the reef for 

shelter, such as Holocentrus adscensionis, Myripristis jacobus, Pempheris schomburgkii 

and Odontoscion dentex that can be found hiding or aggregating, for the two latter, in 

large enclosed spaces; (2) species like Pareques acuminatus and Apogon americanus 

that hide very well in crevices of the reef (Randall, 1963); (3) species that show a strong 

dependence of the reef such as Amblycirrhitus pinos that rests upon hard substratum 

(Randall, 1967) or Stegastes pictus and Ophioblennius trinitatis that forage in small 

areas; and (4) ambush predators that can remain in the reef for long periods of time, 

such as Epinephelus spp. and Muraenidae, (Heemstra &amp;amp; Randall, 1993; Juanes et al., 

2002). Although these species can often be observed in pre-determined sites in the reef, 

for the first two types, others that are usually in a more exposed location can easily hide 

from view using either the reef structure or benthic cover, mostly for the two latter. This 

presents a whole array of detection possibilities, the outcome of which is not only 

related to the recognition ability of the diver and chosen census methodology, but also 

to the chance that the species is actually there. The fact that some of the species 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

66 

 

included in this category, such as O. trinitatis have a very limited home range (estimated 

forage area is 4 m
2
 (Mendes, 2006)) or S. pictus with an area of approximately 2 m

2
, and 

taking into account that it probably has a similar foraging pattern as its substitute in 

shallow depths S. fuscus (Osório et al., 2006), probably indicates a slower process of 

colonization of the intermediate vessel reefs by these and similar species.  

 Regarding type D species, it was possible to see strong similarities for both 

vessels, with larger number of species and similarities for the dives in Saveiros than in 

Mercurius, and a similar pattern for the two. This type of species is characterized by 

substrate related behaviors, associated with protection, such as burying in the sand, 

digging holes or even hiding themselves in burrows made by other organisms and 

feeding. All species in this group obtain their food by close association with the 

substrate, either by directly foraging for invertebrates or animal/plant material, like 

Pseudupeneus maculatus or Dasyatis americana and gobiids; by preying upon fishes 

venturing too near, like Synodus intermedius or Scorpaena plumieri; or even by hovering 

above their burrows feeding on zooplankton, such as Opistognathus aurifrons and 

Ptereleotris randalli (Randall, 1967; Gasparini et al., 2001). Type D species show the 

greatest cryptic patterns, due to their coloration pattern and escaping means, being the 

least abundant group, with the exception of pelagic species for Saveiros. Also, the 

stronger resemblance between the first dives is explained by the lower number of 

species which suggests the possibility of either a fairly long period for their arrival in the 

vessel reefs or underestimation of the real number of species due to their cryptic habits.   

Many type A and D species are well camouflaged and tend to hide at the 

approach of an observer. According to Kulbicki (1998), in disturbed areas the detection 

of cryptic species (e.g., Serranidae and Synodontidae) tends to increase because fishes 

tend to move and become conspicuous, instead of remaining still and concealed by their 

color and behavior. This finding can be applied to this study with some species, such as 

Synodus intermedius, Epinephelus adscensionis, Amblycirrhitus pinos and Stegastes 

pictus, which were recorded in Saveiros before being observed in Mercurius, an 

undisturbed area with restricted number of divers. This can also, to some extent, justify 



Chapter 2- Discussion 

67 

 

the presence of Scorpaena plumieri and Antennarius multiocellatus, two mimic species 

known for their sedentary nature (Randall, 1967).  

 The major group of species, type B, was the best represented of the fish 

community throughout the study, having not only the greatest similarity but also a good 

temporal aggregation for most dives, in both vessels. These species are linked to the 

reefs but normally do not hide or flee in the presence of divers for which they have been 

considered as “neutral fishes’’ by Kulbicki (1998) who studied the behavior of some 

species in the presence of divers and the implications in terms of bias. He considered 

these fishes to be conspicuous by their shape or color (e.g., acanthurids, chaetodontids 

and scarids) and not affected by the presence of a diver, neither positively in the case of 

“curious fishes” nor negatively by “shy fishes”. By having representatives of most 

trophic guilds, with the exception of piscivores and territorial herbivores, and with a full 

range of frequencies of occurrence, this group has proven to be quite capable of 

showing possible changes in the community structure, especially in artificial sites where 

sampling can be complicated, as in the case of vessel reefs that have a complex 

structure and are located at intermediate depths that do not allow long periods of 

immersion using SCUBA for accurately sampling the whole reef and the surroundings. 

 Regarding the differences between the vessel reefs, this study indicates that the 

impact caused by divers is not perceptible, at least, during the first year of immersion of 

the reefs, for the two communities have a large resemblance in terms of trophic 

categories and overall community structure. It is important to highlight, though, that an 

advanced level of diving skills (e.g., Advanced Open Water Diver in PADI certification) is 

needed to dive in these reefs due to the depth of the sites. This probably influences the 

possible impact that the divers can have, both in benthic and fish communities. 

Although there is no consensus about the difference of impact between inexperienced 

and experienced divers, a greater negative influence of the first in the surrounding area 

has been reported (Schaeffer &amp;amp; Foster, 1998). According to Rouphael &amp;amp; Inglis (1997), the 

chances of a diver to come into contact with reefs is determined by personal attributes, 

such as its technical competence as a diver, the activities he pursues whilst at the diving

site (e.g., photography, exploration) and his awareness of the environmental 

consequences of his actions.  

The main goal of this chapter was to assess the main species in terms of trophic 

group and spatial category, in order to better understand the colonization process in the 

coast of Pernambuco, tropical southwestern Atlantic. As expected, with the lack of 

structural reefs for the enrichment of the continental platform, the deployment of 

vessel reefs can work as oasis in attracting/producing reef fishes, increasing the number 

of species present by at least 20 species in less than three months. By the 

presence/absence analysis we could comprehend the temporal changes inherent to the 

reef community development, allowing a greater focus on the species ecology rather 

than group or quantity dynamics.

CHAPTER 3. COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN DIFFERENT REEFS IN THE 
NORTHEASTERN COAST OF BRAZIL 

 



Chapter 3 

70 

 

INTRODUCTION 

The Brazilian coral reefs have a unique character, which is the relatively low 

diversity of their coral fauna, although they are rich in endemic species, including the 

southernmost reef communities of the Atlantic Ocean. The northeastern coast (between 

5 and 12º S) presents several types of reef structures with coastal isolated bank reefs of 

different shapes and dimensions, forming up to three lines of reefs along the coasts of 

Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco and Alagoas (Leão &amp;amp; Dominguez, 2000).  

The tropical fish fauna of the western Atlantic is distributed from 35° N to 28° S, 

with a considerable part included in Brazilian waters, mostly from below the Amazon 

River mouth at Manuel Luiz Reefs (0°52’S) to Santa Catarina State (27º30’ S) (Ferreira et 

al., 2004; Floeter et al., 2001). Several studies have described the differences in reef fish 

communities along latitudinal gradients in Brazil (e.g., Floeter et al., 2001; Ferreira et al., 

2004; Floeter et al., 2004), using diverse characteristics such as trophic or feeding 

strategies, spatial use and mobility, resulting in the recognition of the northeastern 

coast as a region with a distinct species composition. 

Few, if any, fish families are obligate coral reef dwellers (Bellwood, 1998), with 

many species having a larger distribution associated with hard substrata and even sand 

plains, mangroves and seagrass beds (Lowe-McConnel, 1999). However, the concept of 

the existence of some key reef families is widely accepted. The major taxa that 

constitute this group are the chaetodontid fishes (Chaetodontidae and Pomacanthidae), 

the acanthuroids (Acanthuridae and the Indo-Pacific families Siganidae and Zanclidae) 

and the labroids (Scaridae, Pomacentridae and Labridae) (Choat &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1991).  

Although the evaluation of the performance of an artificial reef should vary 

according to the purpose for which it was built, a comparison of these structures with 

natural reef systems, preferentially undisturbed, in local and regional scales is always 

useful (Carr &amp;amp; Hixon, 1997). According to these authors, this type of comparison can not 

only increase the knowledge on the fish communities present in the area but also 

determine the spatial scales over which artificial structures act to attract reef species.



Chapter 3- Introduction 

71 

 

  To understand the dynamics and resemblance between natural and artificial 

reefs in northeastern Brazil, a comparison was made among different reefs (shallow, 

intermediate and deep; artificial and natural), using reef fish species inventoried in 

several different studies.

DATA ANALYSIS 

Data collection 

For this study the list of species observed, by visual census, in reefs from several 

locations in the northeastern coast of Brazil was assembled from the available literature 

(Table 3-1) and compared to the results obtained by the present study from three 

artificial reef vessels (Taurus, Mercurius and Saveiros). Species sampled in other studies 

by other means than visual census (e.g., clove oil) were not included.

For shallow and/or coastal reefs, depths up to 10 m, Porto de Galinhas - PE, 

Maragogi – AL, Maracajaú – RN and Picãozinho were used (Fig. 3-1). For the deeper 

reefs, &gt; 40 m, the list of species was obtained from a study in the coast of Paraíba 

(Feitoza, 1999). Regarding the intermediate depth reefs, from around 20 to 30 meters 

deep, two geographical zones were used: Recife’s coast with artificial vessel like reefs 

(Fig. 3-2) and Zumbi’s natural reefs from available literature (Fig. 3-1). The eight vessel 

reefs used were: Marte; Pirapama, Servemar X, Vapor de Baixo and Reboque Florida; 

and Mercurius, Saveiros and Taurus, with lists compiled during the current project 

(Table 3-2).

Analyses 

To assess the ecological similarity of fish assemblages among different reefs 

(shallow, intermediate, deep and artificial, natural reefs) lists of species with presence/ 

absence data were used for a hierarchical cluster analysis. The Bray-Curtis similarity and 

group average routine were used for the cluster analysis and a two-way ANOSIM 

(Analysis of Similarity) was conducted to assess possible differences due to the type and 

depth of the studied reefs. To evaluate if there was a difference in the species 

composition between the sites in terms of the typical reef families, a separate analysis 

was run, using only species belonging to the Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, 

Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae families. Two-way ANOSIM and a SIMPER 

(Similarity Percentage Analysis) routines were used to identify differences regarding 

type and depth of reefs and species that most contributed for the differences, 

respectively. All these multivariate analyses were conducted using the PRIMER 6? ® 

software (Clarke &amp;amp; Warwick, 2001). 

To spatially evaluate the differences between reefs, and corresponding groups of 

species that might influence their distribution, a correspondence analysis (CA) was used 



Chapter 3- Data Analysis 

76 

 

on the available data with the Multivariate Statistical Package, MVSP 3.13®. No data 

transformation or species weighting were used due to the data being only presence/ 

absence.  

As the values obtained for the species that mostly contributed for the separation 

of the reefs was rather uneven, with points obtained from the correspondence analysis 

representing from one to more than ten species, a spatial density graph was plotted in 

Surfer 8® software. For this plot, the spatial coordinates and associated number of 

species resulting from the CA were used, and squares of 0.1x0.1 were stipulated where 

the number of species was added as to represent the total of species per square. The 

Kriging gridding method was used to create the grid from which the plot was build, 

using as minimum and maximum values for X and Y the limits of the CA graphic already 

obtained in MVSP 3.13® (Appendix 5).

RESULTS 

From the cluster analysis, using all 196 species, it was possible to separate the 

different reefs types, with all the reefs, except the deeper ones (Fig. 3-3, I), showing a 

similarity of more than 50%. The shallower reefs had a resemblance of more than 60% 

(Fig. 3-3, II). The intermediary reefs, both artificial and natural, were all in the same 

cluster with similarities ranging from 60 to 85% (Fig. 3-3, III).  

Figure 3-3 – Cluster analysis for the 14 compared reef environments, with both artificial (?) and natural 
(?) reefs, using all families: I – deep reef; II – shallow/coastal reefs; III – intermediary reefs. 

 

In the cluster analysis, using only the typical reef families, four groups were 

formed with the deep reefs and Marte (Fig. 3-4, I and II) having a similarity of 58 and 

63%, respectively, and the natural and/or shallow reefs as a third group (Fig. 3-4, III) 

with similarities ranging from 75 to 92%. The other seven artificial reefs formed the 

fourth group (Fig. 3-4, IV), showing a strong similarity of more than 85% between 

elements of the set.

intermediary natural reefs. 

 

The two-way ANOSIM results, for all families and using only typical reef families, 

showed that although both reef type and depth accounted for some of the variations, 

there were no significant differences for either parameter (Table 3-3), with depth 

showing, nevertheless, a greater influence than the type of reef.

Due to the larger number of artificial intermediate depth reefs than natural 

intermediate depth reefs, eight versus one, some important reef associated species, 

only present in the natural reef, obtained a low result in the SIMPER analysis (Appendix 

6). The four species that contributed most were Centropyge aurantonotus, Chaetodon 

ocellatus, Microspathodon chrysurus and Stegastes variabilis, all present only in the 

natural intermediate reef. The three species that were not present in the natural reefs 

but were present in the artificial ones were Chromis jubauna, Halichoeres bivittatus and 

Scarus trispinosus. Stegastes fuscus and Sparisoma amplum, despite being present in 

both natural and artificial reefs, showed a preference for the former, as they were 

present in only three and one vessel reef, respectively.  

The results of the correspondence analysis (Fig. 3-5) showed a spatial pattern of 

the reefs with the configuration of three groupings that corresponded to: the shallow 

and/or coast sites, intermediary reefs, and the deeper reefs. The shallow reef group 

presented a wider distribution than the intermediary reefs, with these last ones being 

plotted more tightly in the negative part of axis 2. The deep natural reef showed the 

largest difference in species composition, both from the shallow and intermediary reefs. 

When plotting the reef sites and species together in the correspondence analysis 

(Fig- 3-6), it was possible to see a distribution pattern for several species which 

supported the division of groups containing characteristic species (Table 3-4).

By the spatial points obtained in the correspondence analysis, it was possible to 

observe that the greatest density of species was positioned in the shallow reef area (Fig. 

3-7, a) and also in zones that aggregated species belonging to shallow and intermediary 

reefs and species belonging to all sites (shallow, intermediate and deep reefs) (Fig. 3-7, 

b and c).  

Species that were found only in shallow and intermediary reefs include 

Anisotremus virginicus and Haemulon squamipinna (Haemulidae), Halichoeres 

brasiliensis and H. penrosei (Labridae), Sparisoma frondosum and Scarus zelindae 

(Scaridae), Diodon holacanthus and D. hystrix (Diodontidae) and the serranids 

Epinephelus adscensionis and Rypticus saponaceus. In this group are also included 

cryptic species such as Pempheris schomburgkii and Odontoscion dentex, the 

omnivorous Abudefduf saxatilis and Canthigaster figueiredoi, the carnivorous 

Gymnothorax funebris and the piscivorous Synodus intermedius. Acanthurus bahianus 

unlike the other two species belonging to the genus, was only found in the shallower

reefs. In this group, 23 of the 41 species were found, at least, in three of the shallow 

reefs and five of the intermediate ones (Fig. 3-7, b). 

Thirty species were present in all reefs, from shallow to deep, with Lutjanidae as 

the most species-rich family, with five species, followed by Haemulidae and Labridae, 

with three species each. Several families had most, or all, of its species in this group, 

such as Acanthuridae, Gobiidae and Pomacanthidae with two of its three species 

present, and Holocentridae and Mullidae with both their species represented in all reef 

environments.  From these 30 species, 22 had a similar distribution patterns, resulting in 

the large spatial density of points in the center of the correspondence analysis (Fig. 3-6 

and Fig. 3-7, c).

DISCUSSION 

When using the species found in all reefs, the cluster and correspondence 

analysis resulted in the separation of three reef groups: the coastal/shallow reefs, the 

intermediary reefs and the deeper reefs. The results suggest that the separation of 

these groups is more related with depth than the type of reef involved. As has been 

previously reported, parameters such as depth, currents and even nearby sea grass or 

algae beds can play an important role in determining the fish community structure 

through their trophic significance (Gladfelter et al., 1980).  

 However, in the cluster analysis using only families with complete association 

with coral reef environments – Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Labridae, 

Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae - it was possible to observe the integration 

of the intermediate natural reef (Zumbi) in the natural reefs group. This may reflect the 

need of some species for intrinsic characteristics of natural reefs (e.g., specific food 

resources). Nevertheless, one of the main constraints of this study was the impossibility 

of comparing natural and artificial reefs in shallow and deep (i.e. &gt; 40m) areas, for the 

only artificial reefs intentionally deployed in the coast of Pernambuco are old vessels, 

with these being sited at intermediate depths. This technical difficulty does not allow a 

complete differentiation between the influences of depth and reef type. 

The associated reef species that most contributed to the differences among 

intermediate depth reefs and that were only found in the natural reefs were two 

chaetodontoid species (Chaetodon ocellatus and Centropyge aurantonotus) and two 

labroid ones (Microspathodon chrysurus and Stegastes variabilis). The absence of these 

species in the vessel reefs is probably related to the non availability of proper habitat, 

for C. aurantonotus and S. variabilis are species known to be associated with great 

topographical complexity (Feitoza, 2001) and M. chrysurus as coral dependent 

(Carpenter, 2002a). Chaetodon ocellatus represents an interesting case as, in other 

studies on vessel reefs (Arena et al., 2007; REEF, 2007), the species is present in recent 

deployed reefs. However, in those two studies, a great proximity between natural and 

vessel reefs sites was observed which can explain the species presence in those new 



Chapter 3- Discussion 

86 

 

vessel reefs and their absence in old vessel reefs off Recife, with more than 100 years, 

such as Pirapama and Vapor de Baixo. The detection of these four species might also 

been affected by the low dive/ sampling effort in the intermediate depth artificial reefs 

in the coast of Recife (880 minutes in 44 dives) versus the time spent at Zumbi 

intermediate depth natural reef (a total of 1832 minutes) or the number of surveys on 

the vessel reefs such as the study by REEF (2007) with 76 dives in a single artificial reef. 

Another important factor to consider is the fact that even in the former natural reefs 

(Feitoza, 2001), the number of individuals of the four above mentioned species was very 

low, varying from one specimen of C. aurantonotus and S. variabilis to 13 specimens of 

M. chrysurus, in a total of 50 visual census.  

Three species, belonging to the considered typical reef families, Halichoeres 

bivittatus, Scarus trispinosus and Chromis jubauna, were found in the vessel reefs but 

not in the intermediate natural reef. The occurrence of C. jubauna in the northeastern 

coast of Brazil has been previously reported by Feitoza (1999, 2001) for depths from 

20 meters on, and one specimen was seen in Taurus in a total of 44 dives of this project. 

This single occurrence reflects the low abundance of this species in the intermediate 

warmer waters of the northeastern coast as opposed to greater abundances in deeper 

cooler water (&gt;60 m) in the same geographic area (Feitoza et al., 2005) or in shallower 

cooler waters of the southeastern coast of Brazil (Moura, 1995; Luiz Jr. et al., 2008). 

Halichoeres bivittatus, present in six of the eight artificial reefs, shows a clear preference 

for vessel reefs, especially as it is a species known to be present in coastal, intermediary 

and deep reefs in the northeastern coast (Feitoza, 1999, 2001; Engmann, 2006;). 

However, it is important to remark that only one natural reef was used in this 

comparison and further analysis prove necessary for the correct understanding of this 

species preferences.  

This difference between intermediate reefs is probably related to the inherent 

differences between natural and artificial reefs, such as design and age of the reef, with 

more resident or reef species being found in natural reefs than in artificial reefs (e.g., 

Thanner et al., 2006), as shown in this study. As pointed out by Moffit et al. (1989), 



Chapter 3- Discussion 

87 

 

structural material and design are important factors in the attraction of resident reef 

species, and it has been suggested that natural reefs have certain advantages that might 

not be present in artificial reef sites (Burchmore et al., 1985). However, one important 

factor to bear in mind is that the compared intermediate reef sites were located in two 

distant areas, separated by nearly 200 nautical miles, and although the northeastern 

coast is influenced by the North Brazil Current (Knoppers et al., 1999), different local 

wind and current regimes may result in different water circulation patterns. This 

difference in oceanographic conditions can have a larger influence in the distribution of 

small and reef resident species (e.g., the six reef families studied), than on a wider 

spectrum of transient and pelagic species, partially explaining the observed discrepancy 

in the resulting clusters using some or all species. However, as mentioned before, the 

results using all species indicate the distinction of three reef groups.  

The first group, corresponding to the shallow and/ or coastal reefs, was 

characterized by the presence of species that are associated with brackish estuaries, like 

the mugilids (Cervignon, 1993), species that prefer shallow coastal marine waters such 

as Anisotremus moricandi, Archosargus rhomboidalis, Eucinostomus spp. and Myrichthys 

ocellatus (Acero &amp;amp; Gárzon, 1982; Carpenter, 2002a; Humann &amp;amp; DeLoach, 2002), and 

resident species of the intertidal environment such as Labrisomus nuchipinnis (Rosa et 

al., 1997; Barreiros et al., 2004). The greatest number and density of representative 

species of these reefs is probably related to the importance of shallow reefs as nurseries 

(Jenkins &amp;amp; Wheatley, 1998; Nagelkerken et al., 2000b; Lecchini, 2003) and protective 

sites with lower abundance of predators (Shulman, 1985; Parrish, 1989; Layman, 2000). 

The second group, containing both natural and artificial reefs, clustered species 

with distinct habits, residence and trophic levels. The four species that were unique to 

intermediary reefs (and present in more than 50% of them) varied from a pelagic, 

transient and mobile invertebrate feeder, Aetobatus narinari, to a benthic and resident 

carnivore, Amblycirrhitus pinos, and two benthic transient omnivores, Acanthostracion 

polygonius and Cantherhines pullus. The distribution of A. narinari is related to its 

behavior. Since it is an active swimmer that can travel long distances (Carpenter, 2002b) 



Chapter 3- Discussion 

88 

 

it is understandable that its occurrence in the reefs is considered rare to uncommon. As 

a pelagic species, it is expected to prefer areas of clear water, not being registered in 

any coastal and/ or shallow reefs. The presence of A. pinos, with a known distribution 

from 5 to 25 m (Debelius, 1997), as restricted to intermediate reefs probably reflects the 

preference of this species for these environments due to the absence of possible 

competitors that are present in the shallower reefs. The large abundance of the 

carnivorous Labrisomus nuchipinnis in shallow reefs of the northeastern coast of Brazil 

(Rosa et al., 1997; Engmann, 2006; Pacheco, 2008) might be limiting the settlement of A. 

pinos in those reefs. As observed by Pacheco (2008) in a study on territorial species in 

the reefs of Tamandaré, south coast of Pernambuco, some territorial species appear to 

only allow the presence, or at least did not display an aggressive behavior towards 

individuals, of another species when there is no overlap of diets. This can help to explain 

the absence of A. pinos in shallow reefs and the low abundance, or even total absence, 

of L. nuchipinnis in intermediate reefs (e.g., Rosa et al.,1997; Feitoza, 2001), as these 

two species might compete for the same resources. Furthermore, predation by L. 

nuchipinnis on several other species as well as agonistic interactions has been observed 

(Mendes, 2006).  

The deeper reef, although having pelagic species typically associated with the 

clear open water environment, such as Acanthocybium solandri, Coryphaena hippurus 

and Thunnus atlanticus in Feitoza (1999) (Carpenter, 2002a; Lessa et al., in press), was 

also characterized by several species that were present both in the intermediate and 

deep reefs. Among these were pelagic species that can be found over reefs, like 

Rachycentron canadum and Elagatis bipinnulata (Debelius, 1997; Carpenter, 2002a), as 

well as species of deep water environments, such as Clepticus brasiliensis and Stegastes 

pictus (Ferreira et al., 1998; Heiser et al., 2000; Halpern &amp;amp; Floeter, 2008). This group was 

always distinct from the other clusters, either using all species or just typical reef 

families, probably as a result of its distinct species composition and also its distance 

from the coast. This deep water environment presents carbonate sand and rubble 

plains, large blocks, and also some vertical walls with small crevices at their base. The 



Chapter 3- Discussion 

89 

 

presence of calcareous algae and some sponges is also frequent (Feitoza, 1999). 

However, the large resemblance between the deep and the natural reefs, in the analysis 

of reef associated species, might prove that even being distant and in an environment 

with different characteristics, the deeper reefs can also function as shallow reefs, posing 

both as shelter and nursery areas for some deep reef species (e.g., Boland &amp;amp; Parrish, 

2005; Brokovich et al., 2007).  

Regarding the number of species that distinguish different reefs, the largest 

densities were found in the shallow reefs (mentioned earlier), for species that 

characterize shallow and intermediary reefs and also for species present in all reefs.  

The waters in the northeastern coast of Brazil show a relatively stable 

temperature throughout the year with values ranging from 26ºC in the winter, to 30ºC in 

the summertime (Medeiros &amp;amp; Araújo Filho, in press). This might explain the large 

distribution of species in the reefs over the continental shelf as a consequence of the 

low temperature gap, as temperature is known to be the major factor influencing 

marine life (Lowe-McConnell, 1999). Environmental stability has also been used to 

explain the rise of diversity, both taxonomic and morphological, on reef fishes from 

shallow tropical seas (Choat &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1991; Bellwood &amp;amp; Wainwright, 2002; Floeter et 

al., 2004). 

Although several studies have highlighted the importance of reef structure on 

structuring the fish community (Luckhurst &amp;amp; Luckhurst, 1978; Gladfelter et al., 1980;), 

this study suggests that depth is a key factor in this process. Although no natural 

intermediate reefs were sampled off Recife’s coast, it can be inferred that the main fish 

source were not the shallow reefs but other natural/ artificial reefs in the area, for the 

composition of the fish fauna on the intermediate depth reefs was somewhat distinct of 

the natural coastal reefs and very similar among the several vessel reefs.

FINAL REMARKS 



 

91 

 

The present work was part of a project which was the first to inventory the reef 

fish species present in three intentionally deployed vessel reefs, in the state of 

Pernambuco, and to study their community structure, diversity as well as the trophic 

and spatial distribution of the species present, including the changes in species 

composition for approximately one year.  

 Community diversity 

By the comparison of the ichthyofaunal communities present in the three 

vessels, it was possible to conclude that these reefs had a fish community typical of 

reefs in the northeastern coast of Brazil, with most of the reef fish families that occur in 

them being also present in the vessel reefs (Chapter 1 and 3). The diversity indices used 

in the present work showed rich and diverse fish communities in all three vessels, with 

more dynamic species regulation processes in the shallower and smaller vessel, 

probably resulting from resources pressure (i.e. limited shelter and/ or food) and even 

anthropological impact, since this last vessel had a higher diving intensity than the 

others (Chapter 1). 

Trophic guilds 

The trophic guilds were very similar for the three vessels, with the main 

differences being found between the smaller/ shallower vessel and the two larger/ 

deeper ones. As previously reported, the main differences were found for a) the 

planktivores, with a greater abundance on the deeper vessel, which is in agreement 

with other studies in the area and on vessel reefs in general; b) mobile invertebrate 

feeders, which, in spite of being more abundant in the shallower vessel, were the 

second most abundant trophic group in the other two deeper reefs; c) omnivores, 

whose greater abundance in the deeper and diver free vessel is an observable effect of 

the presence of medium sized schools (&lt;200 individuals); and d) territorial herbivores 

which showed a larger abundance in the shallower reef, although with much smaller 

values than the ones usually found in natural reefs (Chapter 1).  



 

92 

 

The continuous analysis of the trophic patterns throughout the colonization 

process allowed the identification of important changes in the number of species in 

each trophic guild. The main changes were related to species that were heavily present 

from the beginning of the dives, such as roving herbivores and mobile invertebrate 

feeders, and to those whose numbers increased through time, like the omnivores and 

planktivores (Chapter 2). These results show that some species have a higher 

dependence on the resources offered by the reefs (e.g. territorial herbivores) and that, 

as time passes by, the community fulfills all trophic guilds creating an intertwined web 

of relationships among different species with different needs. Thus, it could be inferred 

that the pioneer species for fish colonization on an artificial reef are those that can 

forage and move large distances from the reef to feed, returning to the reef for shelter. 

Spatial distribution of species 

The use of spatial categories to group the species in the present work had two 

main purposes: to allow comparisons with the distribution patterns and similarities 

found in different fish communities, and to evaluate the visual census methodology as a 

tool to identify the species in the colonization process of an artificial reef. 

The cluster analysis applied to the data on spatial distribution, in the two deeper 

vessels, showed a clear separation between the first dives and the remaining ones, using 

all species and type B species (i.e. species that maintain visual contact with the reef and 

swim around it). This pattern is expected as these species are conspicuous by their color 

and shape and are considered to be “neutral species”. However, this pattern was not 

observed for the pelagic, type C, and reef/ substrate attached species, types A and D, 

which are species known to flee or hide at divers’ approximation. While most pelagic 

species are considered occasional species, type A and D species are usually species that 

exhibit camouflage characteristics, being sometimes very hard to spot (Chapter 2). 

Despite the inadequate temporal scale offered by these three last spatial distributions, 

as the dives in the cluster analysis were mixed, these species could show different 

patterns, in the vessel reef opened for recreational diving and the one closed, providing 

valuable information for posterior studies regarding species presence in artificial reefs. 



 

93 

 

 Sampling limitations 

Many of the analyses in this study were made using species presence/ absence 

data, especially the ones comparing different reefs and sites (Chapter 2 and 3). Such an 

approach was adopted because the main objective of this work was to study the 

evolution of the colonization process and to compare it with other reefs, in relation to 

the number of species in each trophic and spatial category. Although the communities 

studied were still experiencing some species regulating processes (Chapter 1), the work 

concluded that the species composition already resembled the ones found in natural 

reefs (Chapter 3). Another purpose of this study was to evaluate the ecological pattern 

of the colonization process of two recently deployed vessels and to understand the 

available resources the reef offered, based on the differential niche use (Chapter 2). 

One of the main limitations of this study was the presence of large abundances 

of some reef-attached species, like Haemulon aurolineatum and H. squamipinna. The 

massive abundance of Haemulids has already been described for other artificial reefs 

(Randall, 1963; Smith et al., 1979; Wolf et al., 1983, Thanner et al., 2006), so a way to 

better estimate their abundance (e.g. video transects), in the vessel reefs, is clearly 

needed. Another intrinsic limitation of the present work was the existence of only one 

natural reef at intermediate depth, versus eight vessel reefs, and no artificial reef in 

shallow and deeper areas (Chapter 3), which greatly hindered the comparison between 

different types and depths of reefs. Although the pattern found resembles the results 

from other studies on artificial reefs, it was difficult to ascertain which factor, i.e. depth 

or type of reef, had the main influence on the fish assemblages. 

Can Artificial Reefs function as natural reefs? 

The use of artificial reefs to create productive ecosystems in damaged or 

unproductive areas is a commonly used reason for the deployment of several types of 

reefs. As a consequence, much emphasis has been given to the attraction/ production of 

artificial reefs, with many of these efforts being put into work to evaluate the fishing 

potential of these types of structures (Solonski, 1985; Powers et al., 2003; Santos &amp;amp; 

Monteiro, 2007; Whitmarsh et al., 2008). However, in this study, the main purpose was 



 

94 

 

not to evaluate the fishing or productive potential but to observe the possible changes 

in the community composition of the three vessel reefs along the first year, after 

deployment. As such, from the ecological data gathered in relation to trophic and spatial 

groups, the vessel reefs showed typical communities and behavioral patterns found in 

other studies in the northeastern coast of Brazil (e.g. Feitoza, 2001; Engmann, 2006; 

Souza et al., 2007). Even when compared to natural reefs, the artificial vessel reefs 

showed a greater similarity with reefs located in different geographical areas but at 

similar depths, than with reefs located in the same area but at different depths. This 

shows that the regulation processes acting on species composition are similar in both 

natural and artificial reefs.  

Coral-reef fishes strongly associate with features of habitat structure (e.g., Jones 

&amp;amp; Syms, 1998), and two opposed views exist regarding the critical aspects of coral reef 

habitats. Some authors defend the importance of coral cover on fish distribution and 

abundance (e.g., Munday, 2002; Garpe &amp;amp; Öhman, 2003; Jones et al., 2004), while others 

relate abundance and diversity of coral-reef fishes to spatial and temporal variation in 

topographic complexity (e.g., Luckhurst &amp;amp; Luckhurst, 1978; Gratwicke &amp;amp; Speight, 2005), 

arguing that fish communities are more influenced by the existence of multidimensional 

topographical complexity than by the presence of corals in the area (Toller, 2002).  

Even though artificial, coral and rocky reefs provide increased surface area for 

the attachment of primary and secondary producers, it is well known that no artificial 

reef surface can provide even an infinitesimal part of overall surface area available in 

the natural surrounding environment (Bortone et al., 2000). However, that structural 

complexity can be enlarged by sessile invertebrates that attract and support other 

organisms that depend on them, both for food or shelter (Jones et al., 1997). 

Coral reef communities are extremely diverse and variable, and we should not 

expect that the relationships between reef organisms or the dynamics of the system to 

be simple to understand (Szmant-Froelich, 1983). However, knowledge of the nutrient 

cycle can be indicative of the productivity of a reef.  



 

95 

 

While dissolved nutrients and some particulates are taken up by organisms such 

as algae and zooxanthellae, other particulates are mostly trapped by the reef’s filter 

feeding organisms. Planktivorous fish also concentrate particulates and excrete large 

amounts of organic material in their nocturnal shelters (Szmant-Froelich, 1983). 

Similarly, mobile invertebrate feeders, which account for a large proportion of reef fish 

biomass, forage diurnally and nocturnally over large areas (Wolf et al. 1983; Moura &amp;amp; 

Francini-Filho, 2005) and release nutrients onto the reef, which can also enhance coral 

growth (Meyer &amp;amp; Schultz 1985). Mobile invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and even 

other carnivorous and piscivorous species, are all important elements in the nutrient 

cycle of the reef, redistributing nutrients from adjacent habitats, for mobile invertebrate 

feeders and roving herbivores, as well as producing energy and nutrient-rich feces that 

enrich the reef environment and other reef-dependent organism (Choat &amp;amp; Bellwood, 

1991). 

As previously mentioned, in the three vessels reefs it was possible to see all 

types of species, from the ones that migrate to forage in other areas, like roving 

herbivores and mobile invertebrate feeders, to the ones that eat other fishes, such as 

carnivores and piscivores, and even species that take advantage of resources in the 

surrounding environment, such as planktivores. In addition to that, the presence of 

species belonging to all different spatial categories, from pelagic to site-attached 

species, also shows the amount of different resources available in the reefs. 

An artificial reef undergoes a life cycle, which begins with the installation 

process, progresses to a period of maximum colonization effect and then it gradually 

moves into a phase of structural aging, after which the artificial reef reaches a level of 

complexity close to a natural reef (Sato, 1985). Arena et al. (2007), comparing several 

vessel reefs with different ages, concluded that, as time passes by, the fish community 

present in each vessel becomes closer to the ones observed in natural reefs. In the 

present study, however, high similarities were observed between all vessel reefs in the 

same area, regardless of age, which indicates that the colonization process in the 

northeastern coast of Brazil is a rapid event. Even though is has been previously argued 



 

96 

 

that this sudden process may show a “relevant attraction effect to fishes” (Bohnsack &amp;amp; 

Sutherland, 1985), there is no question that the vessel reefs off Recife have self-

regulating and complex communities resembling natural reefs, independently of the 

initial attraction/ aggregation and migration of fishes from  nearby reefs. 

All these results confirm the hypothesis that artificial reefs do support new fish 

assemblages, being able to offer food and shelter, within a structural complexity 

comparable to those found in natural reefs (Bohnsack, 1989; Solonsky, 1985). And no 

matter how attractive an area may be in terms of food supply, it will only be able to 

support large number of fishes if it can offer shelter (Randall, 1963; Ehrlich, 1975) as 

well many other biological requirements, emanating from the biological relationships 

amongst species.  

As a final note, the economic benefits arising from ecotourism and SCUBA diving 

in these vessel reefs can show that, as pointed out by Brock (1994), this may be the 

most economically, as well as ecologically, viable use of an artificial reef. However, 

taking into account the actual exhaustion of natural marine resources worldwide, with 

no exception to the northeastern Brazil, I hope this study may serve as a comparative 

base for, in a future context, studies focused on the productivity of artificial reefs in this 

region.
