Abstract

We describe the diet of Oligosarcus hepsetus, in the Santa Virgínia Unit of the Serra do Mar State Park. The Paraibuna 
and Grande rivers in the basin of the Paraíba do Sul River were sampled monthly from January to December 2004. 
The Alimentary Preference Degree and the frequency of occurrence indices were used to analyze the food items. The 
diets of Oligosarcus hepsetus in the two localities sampled were very similar, and reinforced the importance of the 
streamside forests in establishing and maintaining biotic and abiotic conditions in these environments. The species 
had a carnivorous diet that differed with ontogeny: smaller individuals were principally insectivorous and larger ones 
ichthyophagous.

Keywords: Oligosarcus hepsetus, feeding, Atlantic Forest, Brazil.

Alimentação de Oligosarcus hepsetus (Cuvier, 1829) (Characiformes) no Parque  
Estadual da Serra do Mar - Núcleo Santa Virgínia, São Paulo, Brasil

Resumo

O objetivo do trabalho foi abordar a dieta do peixe cachorro-magro, Oligosarcus hepsetus, no Núcleo Santa Virgínia 
do Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar. O rio Paraibuna e o ribeirão Grande da bacia do rio Paraíba do Sul foram amos-
trados mensalmente de janeiro a dezembro de 2004, sendo utilizados o Grau de Preferência Alimentar e a freqüência 
de ocorrência para as análises dos itens alimentares de Oligosarcus hepsetus. A dieta nos dois locais amostrados foi 
muito similar e ressaltou-se a importância das matas ribeirinhas para o fornecimento e a manutenção das condições 
bióticas e abióticas destes ambientes. A espécie apresentou dieta carnívora com diferenciação ontogenética, sendo que 
os indivíduos menores foram principalmente insetívoros e os maiores ictiófagos.

1. Introduction

Among the innumerable units composing the Leste 
basin in Brazil, the basin of the Paraíba do Sul River 
stands out (Braga, 2004). This isolated basin extends 
over an area of 57,000 km2 including three states in 
southeastern Brazil: São Paulo, Minas Gerais and 
Rio de Janeiro (Hilsdorf et al., 2002). The region has 
changed over time, through the influence of human ac-
tivities carried out with a lack of appropriate conserva-
tion management. This has led to the felling of gallery 
forests, silting, water pollution, and innumerable other 
environmental problems, including those stemming from 
the construction of a number of reservoirs for electrical 
energy generation and/or water storage, among these 
the Paraibuna-Paraitinga and Funil dams (Hilsdorf and 
Petrere Jr., 2002). For these reasons, the state of con-
servation and composition of the ichthyofauna of the 
reservoirs has received some attention (Araújo, 1996; 

Bizerril, 1999; Araújo et al., 2001; Hilsdorf and Petrere, 
2002). However, the smaller affluents that descend the 
slopes of the Serra do Mar and Mantiqueira ranges are 
still little studied (Braga, 2004).

According to Villani et al. (1998), the state of São 
Paulo possesses the largest area of the Atlantic Forest 
and associated coastal ecosystems in the country, rep-
resenting approximately 7% of its original plant cov-
er. A large proportion of these remnants is located in 
state parks, ecological stations, and experimental sta-
tions, which cover more than 3% of the state’s terri-
tory. In the Santa Virgínia Unit of the Serra do Mar 
State Park, some fish species (Brycon opalinus (Cuvier, 
1819), Neoplecostomus microps (Steindachner, 1876) 
and Phalloceros caudimaculatus (Hensel, 1868)) were 
sampled in 1996; nevertheless, the fishes are the least-

60 m. In addition to the nets, sieves, and traps were also 
used. Fish effort was standardized, keeping time and the 
quantity of instruments employed at each point constant. 
The gill nets were submerged from the end of the day up 
to the next morning.

Afterwards, specimens were kept in plastic contain-
ers containing 10% formalin. Each container received a 
label describing date and sample site.

Total length of individuals were measured in cm, 
mass was measured in grams, repletion degree of the 
stomach, fat degree in the visceral cavity. Three catego-
ries, according to a previously established scale, indi-
cated the repletion and fat degrees: 1. empty, 2. half-full, 
and 3. full (Braga, 1990). The frequencies of the reple-
tion degree of the stomach and of the fat degree in the 
visceral cavity were used to characterize the feeding of 
Oligosarcus hepsetus per collection period.

The stomachs with degree 3 (full) were withdrawn 
from the visceral cavity, weighed, and kept in alcohol 
diluted at 70% (Zavala-Camin, 1996). Food items were 
identified with stereomicroscopic up to the lowest taxo-
nomic level reached. To analyze the alimentary items 
found, the Alimentary Preference Degree (APD), was 
used following Braga (1999) in accordance with the for-
mula: APD = Si/N, where Si is the sum of the values 
related to abundance of the food item (i) in the stomachs 
and N, the total number of the stomachs analyzed. The 
estimated value for the Alimentary Preference Degree 
(APD) for each item is indicated by:

APD = 4: the chosen item has absolute preference;
3 ? APD &amp;lt;4: the chosen item has high preference 

degree;
2 ? APD &amp;lt;3: the chosen item is preferential, 

otherwise different items are ingested;
1 ? APD &amp;lt;2: the chosen item is secondary; and
0 &amp;lt;APD &amp;lt;1: the chosen item is occasional.
First, a general analysis of the food items was done, 

and then the Alimentary Preference Degree was analyzed 
for the remaining items, separated into the categories of 
allochthonous and autochthonous.

The method of Frequency of Occurrence (Hyslop, 
1980) was also used, which is the percentage between 
the number of stomachs with preys from a determined 
taxonomic group and the total number of stomachs with 
food. This method was used to characterize the food 
by locality and by total-length class of Oligosarcus 
 hepsetus.

Comparisons of diets between sites (Paraibuna and 
Grande) were made by the non-parametric statistic, 
Spearman rank correlations coefficient-r

s
 (Fritz, 1974; 

Siegel, 1975). Comparisons of diets between autoch-
thonous items and allochthonous items were made by the 
non-parametric statistic, Mann-Whitney U proof (Siegel, 
1975). With the objective of verifying the variation of 
alimentary items as fish and other categories with the 
length of the fish, an analysis was applied using a contin-
gency table (Vanzolini, 1993).

known vertebrates of the Atlantic Forest (Rosa and 
Menezes, 1996).

Fishes with a carnivorous feeding habit increase the 
stability of an ecosystem, being that they act to regulate 
the abundance of prey species (Nikolsky, 1963; Popova, 
1978). Studies of trophic ecology of carnivorous species 
are very useful in monitoring fishery and management 
programs, given that these studies furnish important in-
formation on regulatory mechanisms in populations and 
communities of fishes (Zavala-Camin, 1996).

Fishes of the genus Oligosarcus have a large buc-
cal aperture, permitting the ingestion of whole prey in 
a single bite (Casatti et al., 2001). Most species of this 
genus feed mainly on insects, crustaceans and small 
fish (Lowe-McConnell, 1975). The cachorro-magro, 
Oligosarcus hepsetus, is a small to medium-sized car-
nivore, occurring widely in most of the freshwater eco-
systems in southeastern Brazil. It mainly inhabits shal-
low, densely vegetated microhabitats in small streams or 
along the banks of larger rivers (Araújo et al., 2005).

Notable seasonal changes may occur in the diet of 
fishes according to the area, primarily related to changes 
in composition and availability of food resources, associ-
ated with reproductive pulses and physical and chemical 
changes in the aquatic ecosystems. Diet may also be in-
fluenced by ontogenetic effects, which are generally re-
lated to morphological differences, which lead to chang-
es in the selection and capture of prey species (Nikolsky, 
1963; Wooton, 1992). Furthermore, knowledge of the 
diet of fishes provides essential information for ecologi-
cal research, which also furnishes additional data on the 
entire trophic structure of the ecosystem (Basile-Martins 
et al., 1983).

The objective of the present study was to describe 
the diet of the fish “cachorro-magro,” Oligosarcus 
 hepsetus, in the Santa Virgínia Unit of the Serra do Mar 
State Park.

2. Material and Methods

We established two collection localities within the 
basin of the Paraíba do Sul River: the Paraibuna and 
Grande rivers, both within the Santa Virgínia Unit. 
This Unit covers 16,000 ha in the municipalities of São 
Luiz do Paraitinga, Natividade da Serra, Cunha and 
Ubatuba, located at coordinates 23° 24’ and 23° 17’ S 
and 45° 03’ W. The relief is steeply sloped, with rectilin-
ear valleys and hogbacks with altitudes between 860 and 
1,500 m . The vegetation is dense montane ombrophile 
forest with discontinuous patches of forest in the proc-
ess of regeneration, in addition to areas of abandoned 
eucalyptus plantations with a sub-wood of native plants. 
The climate is humid, subject to the Atlantic Tropical air 
mass (Villani et al., 1998).

A total of 12 samples were made monthly from 
January to December 2004. At each sample point, indi-
viduals were collected using gill nets with mesh sizes of 
1.5; 2.0; 2.5; 3.0; 3.5, and 4.0 cm, measured between ad-
jacent knots (10 m long and 1.5 m high), and totalizing

and in descending order Macrophytes, Crustacean-
Gammaridean, Dipteran pupa, Astyanax sp., Trychoptera 
and Trychopteran larva, each of which represented 2.5% 
of the items found. For the allochthonous items, the 
most important was Insect remains (50%). In  second 
place was Coleoptera (20%), and in decreasing or-
der Arachnida, Dermaptera, Adult Diptera, Gerridae, 
Odonata-Anisoptera, Oligochaeta, Orthoptera and adult 
Trychoptera, each representing 2.5% of the items found. 
In the Paraibuna River, the autochthonous item with the 
highest percentage was Dipteran larva (35%), followed 
by Odonata nymphs (25%). The most commonly oc-
curring allochthonous item was Insect remains (50%), 
closely followed by Coleopteran larva (25%). In the 
Grande River, the most frequent autochthonous items 
were Odonata nymph, Scales and Nematoda, each repre-
senting 15% of the items sampled. The most frequent al-
lochthonous item was Insect remains (50%), closely fol-
lowed by Coleoptera (approximately 25%) (Figure 5).

The Alimentary Preference Degree (APD) showed 
that the most important item was Adult Ephemeroptera 

3. Results

A total of 162 specimens of Oligosarcus hepsetus, 
ranging in length from 8.5 to 25.0 cm, were collected. 
The species was more common in the Grande River than 
in the Paraibuna River (Figure 1).

The distributions of relative frequencies of the reple-
tion degree of the stomach, by collection, indicated that 
in January through August and in December, most of the 
individuals collected had degree 1. At the end of winter 
and in spring, individuals more often had a repletion de-
gree of 2 and 3. This tendency was obvious in the Grande 
River, although not in the Paraibuna River (Figure 2).

The distributions of the relative frequencies of the fat 
degree in the visceral cavity, by collection, showed that 
the highest number of individuals with degree of accumu-
lated fat 3 occurred in October. This was the case in both 
the Paraibuna River and in the Grande River (Figure 3).

Analysis of the frequency of occurrence of the food 
items showed that Insect remains predominated, followed 
by Coleoptera, representing 35% of the items, and Fish 
at 22.5%, followed in decreasing order by Orthoptera, 
Oligochaeta, Hemiptera, Dermaptera, Arachnida and 
Macrophytes, each of which represented 2.5% of the 
items found. In the Paraibuna River, the most impor-
tant item was also Insect remains (50%), followed by 
Coleoptera and Diptera, both representing approximate-
ly 40%. In the Grande River, the most important item 
was Insect remains (approximately 50%), followed by 
Coleoptera and Ephemeroptera, approximately 35% and 
25%, respectively (Figure 4).

A “t” test on the r
s
 0.18 indicates that the correlation 

is not significant (t = 0.75; t
0.05;17 

= 2.11; p &gt; 0.05). Thus 
the diets of the fishes in both sites are quantitatively dif-
ferent.

The U Mann-Whitney proof applied to the ingested 
autochthonous items and allochthonous items, indicates 
that the result is significant (U = 109 &gt; U

0.05;17,14
 = 67); 

therefore, a difference exists in the ingestion of items.
For the autochthonous items, Odonata nymphs was 

the most important (17.5%), followed by Scales (15%),

with a degree of 0.7 (occasional), followed by Insect 
remains. For the prey fish species, Brycon opalinus 
showed an APD equal to 0.5 (occasional), decreas-
ing to Phalloceros caudimaculatus and Astyanax sp., 
equally the least important. All the food items analyzed 
for Alimentary Preference Degree were occasional 
(Figure 6).

When food items were grouped into categories, the 
most important was Insects (nymphs and pupas), with a 
APD of 1.6 (secondary), followed by Adult Insects with 
APD approximately 1.5 (secondary), decreasing to the 
item Sediments, with a value close to zero (occasional) 
(Figure 7).

In the smaller total-length classes (5 to 10 cm), the 
items Fish and Scales were consumed less (35%) than 
were other items (67%). As the total-length classes in-
creased, consumption of Fish also increased, until in the 
largest total-length class (20 to 25 cm), only this item ap-
peared in the food of Oligosarcus hepsetus (Figure 8).

A preference for the item fish with the length in-
crease in O. hepsetus was influenced strongly in the test

(20 to 25 cm).

4. Discussion

According to Nikolsky (1963), the low feeding 
 activity of piscivorous fishes is expected and can be 
explained by the better use and nutritional value of the 
food, which makes it necessary to feed less often. A 
high incidence of empty stomachs of many carnivorous-
ichthyophagous species was also found by Goulding 
(1980), Cruz et al. (1990) and Bennemann et al. (1996). 
Although Oligosarcus hepsetus showed this character-
istic, a large number of individuals had full stomachs in 
spring. This may have occurred because of the increased 
temperature and rainfall, which increase the input of in-
sects and organic matter into the river, thus making larger 
amounts of food items available to the fish, as happened 
with Oligosarcus jenynsii in Lake Caconde, Rio Grande 
do Sul state (Hartz et al., 1996).

Another important fact was the large proportion of 
individuals with degree 3 of accumulated fat in the au-
tumn, when food is scarce. Lowe-McConnell (1964),

Goulding (1980) and Mérona and Mérona (2004) estab-
lished that many species feed less in the dry season and 
consume the fat accumulated during the rainy season. 
Thus, Oligosarcus hepsetus apparently feeds more fre-
quently in the spring and summer, storing a large fat re-
serve that will be used in autumn and winter as a source 
of energy for survival and gonad development. This 
behavior was observed by Bennemann et al. (1996) for 

Acestrorhyncus lacustris, which was actively reproduc-
ing in the area studied (Tibagi River, Paraná state), and 
for which the sequence of events of increased feeding 
activity, fat storage, and then breeding could be estab-
lished.

The richness of food items was very similar be-
tween the two collection localities, although food items 
occurred more frequently in the Paraibuna than in the

Grande River. This difference between the two localities 
can be explained by the larger size and greater vegeta-
tion cover in the Paraibuna River, as well as the lower 
abundance of Oligosarcus hepsetus, which may lessen 
intraspecific competition. This was also observed by 
Alvim and Peret (2004), who concluded that the occur-
rence of autochthonous as much as allochthonous food 

items is dependent on the gallery forest, hence the im-
portance of conserving the riverine forest to maintain 
the ecological balance of a river. From the point of view 
of the biology of the fish, the gallery forest has the fol-
lowing ecological functions: structural protection of the 
habitats, regulation of water flow and discharge, shelter 
and shade, maintenance of water quality, filtration of 
substances that arrive in the river, and providing organic 
matter and substrates for fixation of algae and periphyton 
(Barrella et al., 2001). Lowe-McConnell (1987) observed 
that rivers bordered by native vegetation provide a wide 
variety of food items, mainly insects and higher plants. 
These items are of great importance for the survival and 
ecology of freshwater tropical fishes.

The Alimentary Preference Degree for the items con-
sumed by Oligosarcus hepsetus showed that the items 
were occasional, and when these were grouped, the 
first three items were secondary: Insects (nymphs and 
pupas); Insects (adults) and Fish. This result was con-
firmed by Araújo et al. (2005) in Lajes Reservoir, where 
Oligosarcus hepsetus showed a carnivorous feeding hab-
it, feeding only on insects and fish and varying its diet 
according to the seasons and the zones of the reservoir.

In Oligosarcus hepsetus the difference in feeding 
during ontogeny was evident, in that smaller individuals 
were basically insectivorous and larger ones ichthyopha-
gous. Hahn et al. (2000) found only fish in the stomachs 
of individuals of Acestrorhyncus lacustris over 10 cm 
long in the Itaipu Reservoir. Araújo et al. (2005) ob-
served a similar situation, in which Oligosarcus  hepsetus 
larger than 19 cm fed principally on fish, in contrast to 
smaller individuals which fed principally on insects. 
Similarly, Gealh and Hahn (1998) found for Oligosarcus 
 longirostris in the Segredo Reservoir, that smaller indi-
viduals fed on insects, crustaceans and fish, whereas larg-
er ones (&gt;16 cm) were exclusively piscivorous. Araújo

et al. (2005) reported that larger Oligosarcus hepsetus 
were apparently able to capture higher-quality prey, i.e., 
which was larger, heavier and probably richer in energy. 
The increase in size is related to morphological changes 
(size of buccal aperture and swimming speed) that may 
facilitate catching fish. Ontogenetic changes in feeding 
may also be associated with a decrease in intraspecific 
competition, with smaller individuals feeding preferen-
tially on insects, and larger ones consuming mainly fish 
(Lowe-McConnell, 1987).
