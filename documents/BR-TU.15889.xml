A dispersão de organismos marinhos durante a sua fase larvar é 
determinante para a conectividade entre populações e o 
estabelecimento da complexa biogeografia das espécies marinhas. 
A determinação dos padrões de dispersão tem sido relevante para a 
conservação de espécies, a gestão de stocks de pesca e mesmo 
para a compreensão de processos ecológicos como a extinção e a 
recolonização de populações. As estruturas carbonatadas de 
organismos marinhos representam arquivos de informação 
ambiental. Através da análise geoquímica de estruturas como os 
otólitos de peixe e os estatólitos e conchas de invertebrados é 
possível descobrir as condições físico-químicas ambientais sob as 
quais se desenvolveram estes organismos e reconstruir padrões de 
dispersão e locais de origem de indivíduos. No entanto, a 
incorporação dos elementos químicos por estas estruturas é 
altamente regulado por um conjunto de fatores físico-químicos 
ambientais e biológicos que deverão ser ponderados para uma 
correta utilização de assinaturas geoquímicas como meio de 
identificação geográfica. Com o intuito de investigar como a 
composição química de conchas larvares do mexilhão Mytilus 
galloprovincialis é influenciada por algumas condições ambientais e 
temporais, indivíduos desta espécie foram submetidos a diferentes 
temperaturas, salinidades e concentrações de elementos. Pretendia-
se verificar como difere a incorporação de elementos com os 
diferentes parâmetros de cada fator ambiental e se a mesma é 
influenciada pela idade do indivíduo. Com esse objetivo foram 
cultivadas larvas de M. galloprovincialis por um período de 6 e 14 
dias e criados tratamentos combinados de temperatura (12, 17, 20 e 

25°C) e de salinidade (26, 32 and 37). Foram quantificadas as 
concentrações dos elementos Mg, Mn, Ba, Sr, Cu e Zn pelo rácio de 
Ca através de análise de ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectometry). Paralelamente um outro conjunto de indivíduos 
larvares foi submetido a concentrações de Cu e Zn durante 
aproximadamente 3 dias. Não foi encontrada variabilidade 
significativa nas assinaturas geoquímicas entre as larvas com 6 dias 
e 14 dias de idade, sugerindo uma composição química estável, 
para este período, que não foi afetada pelo desenvolvimento larvar.

Numa outra abordagem, foi detetada a máxima incorporação destes 

elementos a uma temperatura de 17°C e a diferentes combinações 

de temperatura e salinidade, realçando uma interacção entre estes 

fatores. Estes resultados realçam a possível influência da 

temperatura sob a disponibilidade de cada elemento. Outro aspeto a 

ter em conta é o facto de a 17°C serem encontradas as condições 

ótimas para o desenvolvimento larvar, e por isso também da 

secreção da concha carbonatada do mexilhão, existindo uma maior 

incorporação dos elementos do ambiente. A incorporação de Cu, no 

entanto, não mostrou ser significativamente afetada pela temperatura 

nem pela salinidade. Relativamente ao Zn estes efeitos foram apenas 

significativos quando não combinados. Para além disso, e numa 

terceira abordagem, a disponibilidade destes últimos na água, não se 

mostrou determinante para a incorporação dos mesmos nas conchas, 

sugerindo-se um controlo da inclusão por parte de fatores fisiológicos 

do próprio organismo. Os resultados obtidos permitem compreender 

mais detalhadamente a relação que alguns fatores ambientais 

exercem sob a produção de assinaturas químicas em conchas 

larvares desta espécie de mexilhão e poderão contribuir para uma 

melhor interpretação de padrões de conectividade de populações no 

meio marinho.

Larval dispersal is the main cause of connectivity between 

populations and the establishment of the complex biogeography of 

most marine species. The determination of dispersion patterns has 

been relevant to conservation studies of species, management of 

fisheries stocks and even for the understanding of ecological 

processes as the extinction and re-colonization of populations. 

Carbonate structures of marine organisms work as an archive of 

environmental information. Through geochemical analysis of fish 

otoliths, as well as statoliths and shells of invertebrates is possible to 

discover physical and chemical environmental conditions under 

which these organisms developed and trace dispersion patterns and 

natal habitats. However, the incorporation of trace elements in these 

structures is highly regulated by a range of physical and chemical 

environmental factors as well as physiological and biochemical. 

These factors should be considered for an accurate use of 

geochemical signatures as a means of geographical identification. In 

order to investigate how the geochemical composition of larval shells 

from the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis is influenced by 

environmental and temporal conditions, individuals were submitted to 

different temperatures, salinities and  water elemental 

concentrations. The main objective was to understand how the 

elemental incorporation varies with different parameters of each 

environmental factor, and if the same is influenced by age. M. 

galloprovincialis larval were reared during 6 and 14 days under 

combined treatments of temperature (12, 17, 20 and 25° C) and 

salinity (26, 32, and 37). Concentrations of the elements Mg, Mn, Ba, 

Sr, Cu and Zn by the ratio of Ca were analyzed through ICP-MS 

(inductively wound couple plasma-mass spectrometry) analysis.

Simultaneously another set of individuals were submitted to 

different concentrations of Cu and Zn for a period of approximately 

3 days. No significant variability in chemical composition was found 

in larval shells between larval with 6 and 14 days of development, 

suggesting a stable geochemical signature, for this period, and no 

age effect on incorporation. On a second approach, was detected a 

maximum incorporation of these elements at 17° C and at different 

temperature-salinity combinations, suggesting an interaction 

between these factors. These results highlight the possible 

influence of temperature on each element’s availability. Another 

aspect is the fact that at 17° C larval seem to find optimum 

conditions for its development and for carbonate shell secretion, 

having a higher incorporation of the elements from the water. Cu 

incorporation, however, was not significantly affected by 

temperature or salinity. With regard to the Zn these effects were 

significant only when not interacting. Finally, the availability of the 

lastly mentioned elements in the water was not significant for 

elemental concentrations in shells, suggesting that certain 

elements incorporation might be specifically controlled by 

physiological mechanisms of the organism. Results obtained allow 

understanding in more detail the influence some environmental 

factors have on geochemical signature production in mussel larval 

shells of this species and may contribute to a better use of 

elemental fingerprinting in the interpretation of connectivity 

patterns.

1. Introduction  

Carbonate structures, such as otoliths, statoliths, and protoconchs of marine 

organisms work as an archive of chemical and physical environmental variations 

experienced during growth (Vander Putten et al.  2000; Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl, 

2005; Becker et al. 2005). In association with specific environmental conditions non-

calcium water elements are usually incorporated by the newly formed biogenic 

carbonate, leaving an elemental fingerprint (Thorrold et al. 2002; Becker et al. 2005). 

These signatures may be used to relate an isolated individual to its natal origin, 

working as a natural tag (Becker et al.  2005), and to investigate population 

connectivity mediated by larval dispersal by tracing a migration pathway (Fodrie et 

al.  2011). This can highly contribute to the understanding of marine population’s 

dynamics and community structure, species evolution and ecology,  which are of 

major importance in marine resources management (Becker et al.  2007).   

 

Most marine organisms have a bi-phasic life cycle with a pre-settlement 

planktontrophic phase that can last from weeks to months (Becker et al. 2007), 

followed by a post larval phase, including a juvenile and adult stages. With very little 

to non-swimming capacity, larval are transported for several kilometers by ocean 

currents (Becker et al. 2005) contributing to a highly dispersed and connected 

demography among marine species (Becker et al. 2007; DiBacco&amp;amp;Levin, 2000). 

Attention has been given to this factor, and to the effect it has on marine populations 

since the beginning of the century (Hjort, 1914). Currently, it is theorized how marine 

species survival may even depend on this connectivity and how it can influence 

species persistence and local biodiversity maintenance (Thorrold et al. 2007 Frodie et 

al. 2011). Since most of population´s  biogeography and abundance is determined 

during this early life stage, knowing how far larval can be transported and which 

trajectories they take might, for example, help managing commercial relevant fish and 

shellfish invertebrate stocks, as well as contributing to a more effective design of 

marine reserve networks (DiBacco&amp;amp;Levin, 2000; Thorrold et al. 2007), lead to the 

understanding of the spread of invasive species and the processes of extinction and 

recolonization (Becker, et al. 2005; Becker, et al. 2007). Therefore, understanding



 

5 
 

larval dispersal mechanisms, rates and distances is, nowadays, crucial to determine 

MPAs optimal size, location and configuration (Levin, 2006), specially when the 

change of the environmental conditions may induce, in some cases, marine species 

redistribution (Sorte et al. 2013).  

However, studying larval dispersal and therefore coastal population´s 

connectivity patterns has been a challenge (Levin et al.2006). Larvae reduced size and 

sparse concentration, relatively long planktonic periods of most larval and high 

mortality rates are some identified obstacles. Studying methods have included from 

traditional approaches like visual tracking (direct observation) and sampling routines 

(net tows sampling, settlement collectors) (Queiroga et al. 1994; Dibbaco and Levin, 

2000; Levin and Largier, 2003; Thorrold et al., 2007) to more complex such as 

hydrographic, behavior and energetic modeling, physical transport mechanisms and 

tagging techniques based on geochemical composition(Levin, 1990; Levin, 2006).  

The geochemical composition of calcified structures of marine organisms 

based on geographical differences in water chemistry is increasingly being employed 

as a strategic tool to discriminate among source populations and understand 

connectivity patterns (Thorrold 2007; Lopez-Duarte et al. 2012; Carson et al. 2013). 

This natural tagging method follows the idea that physical and chemical conditions 

under which larval grow are recorded into their carbonate parts through its 

geochemical composition (Becker et al. 2005). At different water masses trace 

elements are incorporated in marine organism´s soft and hard tissues creating a 

chemical signature imprinted into mineral structures (Campana, 1999). This trace 

metal/calcium ratio signature can be related back to the location (or locations) where 

it was formed (Campana et al. 1994; Dibacco and Levin, 2000; Thorrold et al. 2002). 

However, an accurate use of elemental fingerprints as larval source identification 

depends on how different environmental conditions experienced at the several 

locations and on how stable are they over time (Thorrold et al. 2002; Becker et al. 

2007) so that consistent spatial variations can be registered in the element 

composition (Zacherl et al. 2003). For instance, more geochemical tag studies have 

been undertaken using estuarine species than using open-coast species,  most 

probably because in the ocean temperature, salinity and water chemistry variations 



 

6 
 

are less substantial (Becker et al 2007; Lopez-Duarte et al 2012; Carson et al. 2013). 

Therefore, the identification of geochemical differences in pelagic larval spawned in 

open coasts and consequently a rigorous determination of spatial and temporal 

scales, are problems still to overcome (Becker et al. 2007; Thorrold et al. 2007).  

 

As it is referred, biogenic carbonate structures “use” chemical elements found 

in the water to build their own composition during development.  However , this 

incorporation is intrinsically related and influenced by a range of environmental and 

biological  factors including temperature, salinity, dissolved ion concentration in 

seawater, oxygen levels, nutrient loads, precipitation rate, ontogenetic characteristics 

and seasonal variations in animal´s physiology (Vander Puten et al. 2000; Zacherel et 

al.2003; Strasser, 2008). Comprehending how each factor can influence chemistry 

signature formation is fundamental to a correct study using elemental fingerprinting 

in larval dispersal studies (Strasser et al. 2008).  

The first geochemical tagging studies ever made with hard tissues were 

applied to fish otoliths (ear-stones), though it was rapidly extended to statoliths and 

prodissoconchs, (larval aragonite shell  segregated during embryonic development) 

(Thorrold et al. 2007). Several are the results successfully achieved in population 

studies using elemental fingerprinting, particularly in fish (Strasser et al. 2008). In 

mollusks, on the other hand, and especially in bivalves, studies developed are yet 

scarce (e.g. Becker et al. 2005, 2007; Carson, 2010a; 2010b). More recently, Fodrie et 

al. 2011 has investigated temporal patterns in two mussel species shells settling in 

one exposed region and one protected bay. Although mussels are commonly used as 

environmental quality indicators due to their wide geographic distribution and 

resistance to a broad range of environmental conditions (Vander Putten et al. 2000), 

very few studies have been carried out on their larval ecology (Strasser et al. 2008).

1.1Geochemical signatures formation 

  

Trace elements in seawater have two major external sources: 1) atmospheric, 

anthropogenic or riverine input and 2) as a result of interactions between seawater 

and the newly formed oceanic basalt crust (Nriagu 1989; Donat &amp;amp; Bruland, 1995). 

Most of these elements are widely found in nature (Schroeder et al. 1966a; 1966b; 

1967) hence its requirement for living organisms basic functioning (e.g. protein 

biological activity which is the case of enzyme cofactors Zn, Cu and Mn) (Singh et al. 

2011). 

 

Carbonate skeletons from hard corals and crustaceans (Finlay et al. 2011), mollusc 

shells and fish otoliths (Campana et al. 1994) are built through the deposition of 

calcium carbonate (CaCO3), its main component (Campana et al. 1994; Campana et al. 

1999). This compound can be found in aquatic systems as dissolved calcium ions are 

gained by the dissolution of minerals and rocks (e.g. silicates and carbonates) and 

carbonate ions are usually introduced by  sources such as carbonate minerals, organic 

matter, atmospheric carbon dioxide and CO2 with volcanic origin (Dietzel et al. 2004). 

Contrarly to other calcified structures, otoliths, statoliths and larval shells do not 

change the composition through growth (Campana et al. 1994). That’s what makes 

these structures such success in paleoclimatic studies as recorders of environmental 

conditions (Carré et al.2006).  

Concerning mussels, through water filtration, the carbonate element is deposited in 

the organism tissues whilst production of specific proteins will form the first 

aragonite-based shell (Gossling, 2004). At the same time, during this mineralization 

process, other elements available in the water are incorporated together with calcium 

that forms the skeletal structure of the animal (Richardson et al. 2001).  

 

In general, bivalve shell segregation starts a few hours after fertilization, during the 

trochophore larval stage, the first of several planktonic stages (Figure 1) (Weiss et al. 

1992). However, several authors (De Aguirre, 1975; Lutz and Kennish, 1992; Ruiz et 

al. 2008) have verified that in mussels this process can actually start under veliger 



 

8 
 

form, which is the second stage.  During this process, a specialized group of 

ectodermal cells, the shell field, from the dorsal region of the embryo, secretes the 

shell gland. Subsequently, the outer mantle cells secrete a second and the outer most 

organic shell layer – the periostracum. In an 

inside-out process, the shell gland everts and 

becomes the larval mantle tissue while the 

periostracum spans the whole surface (Weiss 

et al. 1992; Gosling, 2004). This shell is called 

prodissoconch I and continues enlarging until 

the organism is able to close both valves. The 

production of prodissoconch II then follows 

and lasts until the last and third mobile stage, 

the pediveliger. Once the larval phase finishes 

the juvenile shell is called dissoconch but protoconchs I and II remain integrated into 

juvenile and adult shells as structurally distinguishable components (Weiss et al. 

1992; Ruiz et al. 2008).    

 

1.1.1 Factors influencing elements´ incorporation 

 

Biogenic carbonate composition has been extensively used for paleo-environmental 

studies (Pilkey and Goodell, 1963). Although it is known that trace metal absorption 

is partially controlled by a wide range of environmental, biological and 

physiological/genetic factors, only  recently have we been able to  understand how 

each of these contribute to variability in microchemistry signatures(Strasser et al. 

2008). Physical and chemical parameters such as temperature and salinity have been 

the most investigated factors over the years. 

In fish otoliths and invertebrate statoliths, studies concerning temperature and 

salinity effect are numerous (Fowler et al. 1995; Elsdon and Gillanders, 2002; Martin 

et al. 2004; Martin and Thorrrold, 2005; Zacherl et al., 2003b and Zacherl, 2005). 

Studies using bivalve shells have been growing over the years (e.g. Dodd, 1965; Dodd, 

1967; Lerman, 1965; Lorens and Bender, 1980; Vander Putten, 2000; Lazareth et al., 

2003; Strasser et al. 2008). By studying elemental signatures in larval and juvenile 

Figure 1 - Three day old larvae shells – I – 
protoconch I, II – protoconch II.  Weiss et al. 2002 



 

9 
 

clam shells, Strasser (2008) was able to distinguish effects of temperature, salinity 

and age. It was found that the first two factors significantly influenced shell chemistry 

of the organisms. However, the authors highlighted that other physiological factors 

can create some confusion when interpreting elemental composition in carbonate 

structures.  

1.2 Objectives 

 

Geochemical tags are today undeniably important for larval tracking and general 

marine ecology studies. This dissertation focuses on the larval planktonic shells 

(prodissoconches) of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, an ecological and 

economically relevant species. This study aims to contribute to a better 

comprehension of trace elements´ incorporation in relation to conditions of 

temperature, salinity, age and element´s concentration. The general objective is to 

understand the variability of elemental microchemistry composition of the larval 

shells in order to optimize its use as an elemental fingerprinting technique. For such 

purpose, a set of laboratory experiments were conducted where these organisms 

were submitted to constrained conditions of temperature, salinity, trace metals load 

and time. Effects of these parameters in concentrations of Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, Sr and Zn 

relative to Ca concentration in D-veliger stage shells were analyzed using ICP-MS 

(Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry).  

 

Three approaches were undertaken:  

 

? Firstly, larval were reared for 14 days under the same temperature and 

salinity level. 

? Secondly, mussel larvae were reared under different temperature and salinity 

treatments for 6 days. 

? Thirdly, 26h reared larval were incubated into different concentrations of Cu 

and Zn at 17°C and salinity 32.

1.3 Research questions 

 

Elements Intake  

Being able to travel for several kilometers transported by ocean currents, individual 

larva experience different environmental conditions, such as the ones selected for 

this work. How do these different conditions affect the elemental signature creation 

in mussel prodissoconches is the major question of this thesis. Some of the guiding 

questions throughout this work should be:  

 

- In which proportions are elements being incorporated? 

- In which way are the different temperatures influencing incorporation?  

- Is the increased availability of certain elements in higher salinity waters 

determining the deposition? Or are there other physiological factors 

determining the incorporation? 

- Are there differences related to larval age? 

 

Elements´ availability  

Trace elements are found in aquatic systems abundantly, emerging from different 

known and unknown sources. A second major question is how different 

availabilities in the environment affect metal incorporation rate and consequently 

their contribution for shell-element signatures. 

 

- What is the elements´ incorporation rate according to each added 

concentration?  

- Whilst having more availability is also noticed higher incorporation?  

- How is it found larval development at the different metal concentrations 

treatments?

2. Materials and Methods  

2.1 Larvae rearing  

Temperature and salinity  

Adult Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected from Mira channel in the Ria de 

Aveiro and transported to the lab where they were cleaned and prepared for 

spawning induction.  Mussel individuals were placed in plastic containers with 

artificial seawater. Thermal shock method was the most appropriate one for gamete 

release and several shifts of ~20 minutes of low temperature (3-4°C) and high 

temperature (22-25°C) took place. Both gametes were obtained in different glass 

containers and later passed through 40µm mesh filters and coupled. Fertilized eggs 

were filtered using the previous method and transferred to a new acid leached glass 

container where sub samples of 250?l were collected for counting and estimation of 

the stoking culture. 

 Approximately 16000 trochophore larvae with few hours were placed into 

each of the thirty-six 1 liter acid leached glasses. The larval containers were divided 

among 12 treatments that combine 4 temperatures (12, 17, 20 and 25°C) and 3 

salinities (26, 32 and 37) in a factorial design with 3 replicates per treatment. 

Experiments room was kept at a 17°C temperature so it could be maintained the 

temperature of the third treatment. Water baths were created for three of the 

treatments. Aquarium water heaters were used for the 20 and 25°C treatments while 

for the 12°C treatment a cooler bath system was used. Temperature was continuously 

regulated by tank thermometers. Each larval container was covered with paraffin 

plastic and an air system was installed to provide oxygen to all rearing larvae. 

Artificial seawater was obtained in laboratory by adding sea salt minerals to 

osmosis water (purified water by a reverse osmosis). Salinity was reduced for the 

low-salinity treatment by adding osmosis water and increased for the high-salinity 

treatment by adding artificial seawater. Water was filtered to exclude major 

contaminants and impurities and maintained in 5 liters water jugs for the whole time 

of the experiments. 

Larvae were raised for 6 days under selected conditions except for one 

combination of temperature/salinity -17°C and 32 – where larvae were raised for 14 



 

12 
 

days. Water changes were executed every 3 days by filtering larval individuals with 

40 ?m filter meshes and depositing them in containers with new prepared and 

filtered artificial seawater. Larvae were fed Isochrysis galbana every 3 days, having all 

goblets received 5ml with a larval density of ?20 000/L. Subsamples of 250µl of 

mussel larvae were collected for mortality and growth estimation from each 

container at each water change. Therefore organisms´ development was monitored 

and by the third day of experiment larvae were D-veliger stage and by the sixth, 

velum well developed veliger stage. At the 6th and 14th day (for the 17ºC 32 

treatment) a sample of ? 1000 individuals per replicate were stored in acid leached 

Eppendorf tubes and frozen until sample processing.  

Elemental availability  

Two trace metals, Cu and Zn, were used to compare its incorporation, in larval 

shells, under different environmental concentrations during 60 hours. Approximately, 

14000 larvae with 26h of development were distributed over 18 1l bakers of 3 

treatments of Cu [0; 1; 5] ?g/l and 3 treatments of Zn [0; 5; 10] ?g/l with 3 replicates 

each. Stock solutions were prepared by adding a possible weighed concentration of 

each metal to 1 liter of filtered artificial seawater. Dilutions were made for each 

treatment. Room temperature was kept at 17°C.  

 2.2 Sample preparation  

Water preparation 

Water stock solutions for every salinity and element´s availability treatment 

were analyzed throughout the experiments for chemical composition. Sub samples of 

900?l of each water salinity level (with three replicates each) were preserved with 

100 ?l of Ultrapure 60% nitric acid (HNO?) and stored in acid leached 1,5ml ependorf 

tubes, at every water change, and stored at 4 °C until microchemistry analysis.  

Larval shell preparation 

Larva shell preparation followed Strasser et al. 2008 protocol. Each larva 

sample containing a “pool” of no more than 1000 larval individuals was defrosted and 

cleaned from organic matter. Using Petri plastic dishes, larvae “pools” were soaked in 

a solution of Suprapur hydrogen peroxyde (H?O?) 30% buffered with Suprapur 



 

13 
 

sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 10 minutes to allow organic matter digestion and 

rinsed three times with Mili-Q water for larval shell  decontamination before analysis. 

Using 40?m mesh filters larvae “pools” were filtered and transferred with a 

micropipette to acid leached 1, 5 ml ependorf tubes. Fluid excess was collected using 

a micropipette and 10?l of HNO? 60% was added to each ependorfs to dissolve shells 

for ICP-MS analyses.  

2.3 ICP-MS analysis 

Both water and larval shell samples were analyzed for concentrations of barium (Ba), 

calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr) and zinc 

(Zn) by the Central Analytical Laboratory at the University of Aveiro.  Selected 

elements for this study were already reported in previous studies, developed in 

laboratory, as having an interaction with temperature and salinity (Martin and 

Thorrold, 2005; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Strasser et al.2008) Ba, Mg, Mn and Sr and as 

successful proxies in tagging methods (Carson et al.2013). 

Concentrations were determined with a Thermo X Series Inductively Coupled Plasma 

– Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS), equipped with a Burgener Mira Mist nebulizer, set up 

with a Peltier conical cooled chamber, quartz torch and silver shielded nickel cones, 

coupled to a Cetax ASX-510 auto sampler. Indium (In) and Terbium (Tb) were used as 

internal standards and the CeO/Ce ratio was kept below&amp;lt;2%. The concentrations 

of 48Ca, 24Mg and 88Sr were determined by a Jobin Yvon Activa M Inductively Coupled 

Plasma – Optical Omission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) equipped with a JY-AS500 auto 

sampler and a Burgener Mira Mist nebulizer. 

 

2.4 Statistical analysis   

 Statistical routines were undertaken using software Statistica. Trace elemental 

concentrations of larval shells were standardized and ratios between each element 

and calcium (E: Ca) were calculated for data analysis. All ratio data was log 

normalized to correct for heteroscedasticity (heterogenity in error variance). 

Seawater chemical concentrations were interpreted through a linear regression as 

only the factor salinity was investigated for its effect in the different water 

treatments. Concentrations of trace elements in ratio to the amount of Ca were then 



 

14 
 

submitted to a factorial analysis of variance, factorial ANOVA, to explore the effects of 

temperature and salinity and the factors combined interaction on the incorporation 

of different elements. Tukey´s test was used as a post-hoc test. The effect of Cu and Zn 

concentration in the water under constant temperature (17°C) and salinity (32) was 

also tested with an ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons made using Tukey’s test.  

Finally, the effect of age (6 and 14 day old) on the incorporation of different element: 

Ca at constant temperature (17°C) and salinity (32) was analyzed with a t-test.

3. Results  

3.1 Temperature and Salinity effect 

Water chemical composition 

Seawater chemical composition for all elements varied among the tested salinity 

treatments, following an increasing trend as a function of salinity level (Fig 1). 

Increment was significant for all the seven elements as significant regressions 

confirm (Fig 1; p&lt;0, 05). Zn concentrations in ultrapure Mili-Q water showed high 

concentrations of this metal (4 orders of magnitude higher than in salt water) 

suggesting contamination of deionized water sample. Therefore, those samples were 

not integrated in the analysis.

Larval shells  

By the third day of the current experiment the 25°C treatment showed a larval 

mortality rate of nearly 100% which made this treatment no longer available for the 

study.  

Temperature and salinity treatments showed to have a significant effect in all 

elements incorporation except for Cu (Table 1). Regarding temperature effect on 

concentrations of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca, a common pattern was 

detected where the maximum incorporation is reached at 17C (Figure 2). While at 

12C and 20C treatments incorporations were significantly lower. Although Cu/Ca also 

shows maximum incorporation at 17 C, the concentration was not significantly 

different from the other two temperature treatments.  

Salinity also has a common effect on all the incorporation ratios according to the 

increasing trend observed on the elemental concentrations in the water (Figure 1). As 

salinity level increases element´s availability uniformly increases. 

 

A significant interaction between temperature and salinity factors for all the 

elements, except for Cu and Zn, is visible in Table 1. It was also found a non-

significant interaction effect on Mn/Ca ratios although very close (p=0, 07) from the 

statistic significance level. At each tested temperature it is seen that elemental 

concentration varies in all the salinity treatments.  

Temperature and salinity interaction is distinguishable by a common decreasing 

tendency on shell incorporations at the highest temperature for every salinity level, 

although maximum incorporations occur at different salinity/temperature 

combinations for each element (Figure 4)

3.2 Age effect  

Medium temperature and salinity treatment (17°C/32) was maintained for a total of 

14 days in order to evaluate temporal variation of elements incorporation, to Ca ratio, 

into larval shells. T-test analysis was conducted to compare incorporations between 

the first and the second sampling events (6 and 14 days respectively). There were no 

significant differences on the incorporation ratio between sampling events of any of 

the analyzed elements (Mg/Ca: t=0, 5; p=0,6 ;Mn/Ca: t=0,7;p=0,5;Cu/Ca: t=1,03 

;p=0,3;Zn/Ca: t=2,23 ;p=0,08;Sr/Ca: t=0,49; p= 0,6; Ba/Ca: t=0,6;p=0,5), suggesting no 

ontogenetic variations on the incorporation ratio during this period.

Larval shells 

Larvae reared in this experiment presented some individuals with morphological 

abnormalities by the third day of tests.  Cu and Zn ratios in larval shells were 

quantified for different water concentrations. No statistically significant differences 

were found between the three levels of Cu (p&gt;0, 05) (Table 2). On the other hand, 

Zn/Ca ratios showed to be significantly different according to Zn water concentration. 

Incorporations at the highest concentration decreases significantly (Fig. 6). Post-hoc 

comparisons using Tukey HSD (honestly significance difference) test indicated two 

significantly different groups in Zn treatment (Fig.7).

4. Discussion 

4.1 Temperature and salinity effect 

In this dissertation was investigated how temperature, salinity, elemental availability 

and age can influence variability in geochemical signatures in larval mussel shells. 

Firstly, the effect of temperature, salinity and the interaction of both factors were 

analyzed. It was found that the uptake of all the studied elements (barium, copper, 

magnesium, manganese, strontium and zinc) was affected by temperature and 

salinity and also found an interaction between both factors for most of the elements. 

The incorporation of Cu seemed to be the least affected by temperature, salinity and 

their interaction, while the uptake of Zn and Mn was not significant when considering 

factors´ interaction. 

As expected, elemental incorporations increased with increasing salinity due to a 

higher availability of elements in the water (Figure 3). But when considering 

temperature, we see the highest elemental incorporation at 17°C (Figure 2) and the 

lowest incorporation at lower and higher temperature levels. These results may 

suggest the influence of temperature in element´s availability in the water allowing 

different concentrations of these at different temperature levels. This is also 

supported by the interaction of salinity and temperature where it is seen a maximum 

incorporation for each element at different temperature-salinity treatment pairs 

(Figure 4). On the other hand, although higher temperatures, in general, increase 

growth and reduce pelagic larval duration (Ruiz et al. 2008) also show detrimental 

effects on physiological status and survival over certain thresholds (Sánchez-Lazo 

and Martínez-Pita 2012). Although temperatures around 20C have been reported as 

optimum for mussel larval development (Ruiz et al. 2008; Sánchez-Lazo and 

Martínez-Pita, 2012), a decrease in survival was also observed for temperatures over 

24°C (Sánchez-Lazo and Martínez-Pita 2012), in agreement with our results for the 

25°C treatment where 100% mortality was observed.  

The decrease of elemental incorporation in larval shells at higher temperatures may 

correspond to a physiological response to stress where elemental incorporation may 

occur at a slower rate as larvae metabolism is affected. On the other hand, the 



 

25 
 

decrease incorporations in larval shells at higher temperatures might not be directly 

related with survival or physiological stress but with other mechanisms directly 

related with shell segregation, with an optimum for element incorporation around 

17°C. 

 

Magnesium uptake 

Results show that magnesium uptake in larval shells was significantly influenced by 

tested condition. Mg/Ca show an interaction between temperature and salinity, 

although incorporation increases with salinity there is a general lower incorporation 

at higher temperatures (Figure 4). Studies of bivalve aragonite and calcite larval 

shells haven’t been consistent about the relation of Mg with temperature. Early 

studies with M. edulis (Dodd, 1965; Vander Putten, 2000) found that Mg 

concentrations in calcite shells increased with temperature. Lorens and Bender 

(1980) though, had already theorized that, regarding Mg in Mytilus edulis, the first 

should be regulated by mantle cells during calcite formation but not during aragonite 

formation. Although, more recent results from Strasser 2008 support a weak 

influence of temperature and salinity in Mg levels in both aragonite and calcite shells 

of Mya arenaria, the obtained results in this thesis can support temperature influence 

on Mg incorporation in mussel aragonite shells. 

Manganese and Zinc uptake 

Salinity and temperature seemed to contribute to Mn and Zn concentration variation 

in the larval shells but no interaction was observed between both factors (Figure2 

and 3; Table 1) Elsdon and Gillanders (2003) that obtained no significant effects of 

salinity or temperature in Mn concentrations in laboratory reared fish otoliths 

justified these results by concluding that biological processes should be involved in 

Mn mediation in those structures.  Still, Mn has been used successfully for other 

elemental tagging studies (e.g. Thorrold et al. 2001; Becker et al.2007). 

 

 



 

26 
 

Barium and Strontium uptake 

Significant effect of temperature and salinity was found in both Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca 

concentrations in mussel larval shells. Incorporations followed a decreasing trend as 

a function of temperature and an increasing one with salinity level (Figure 2 and 3). 

Concerning Ba, these results agree with previous studies. Zacherl (2002) found a 

negative correlation between temperature and this element´s incorporation into 

aragonite statoliths of Kalletia kalletii, as well as Bath et al. 2000 in fish otoliths, 

Zacherl et al. 2003b in statoliths and Strasser et al. 2008 in mollusc shells. With 

exception of the last, the above referred studies have also confirmed a positive 

relation of Ba/Ca in calcified structures with Ba/Ca in the seawater (Zumholz, 2007), 

being also in agreement with obtained results in this work. 

Regarding Sr, studies have defended that Sr incorporation in aragonite shells of 

molluscs are dependable on precipitation rate (Takesue and van Geen, 2004), while 

specifically in bivalve shells Sr/Ca ratios are mainly regulated by biological processes 

and not by thermodynamics (Gilikin et al. 2005). 

Copper uptake 

Copper was the element which showed to be the least affected by the tested 

conditions. No significant differences of Cu/Ca ratios were detected in larval shells 

between the different tested temperature and salinity levels. One interpretation for 

this case is that Cu incorporation might be highly regulated by the organisms during 

shell formation due to its high toxicity level (Beiras and Albentosa, 2004; Nadella et 

al.2009). 

 

4.2 Age effect 

Mussel larvae reared to evaluate age effect on elemental incorporations showed no 

significant differences in elemental ratios between the two development stages (6 

and 14 days). This leads to the conclusion that during the first 14 days of larval 

development of Mytilus galloprovincialis there were no significant ontogenetic 

variations of water elemental incorporations and, therefore, geochemical signature 

remained stable during this time. This way, shell chemical signature obtained has a 

higher probability of being a good representative of water chemical composition.  



 

27 
 

These results exclude the possible influence of time in geochemical signature 

variation during the tested period, and confirm elemental fingerprinting as a reliable 

technique to represent original water masses as most of in situ studies incubate 

larvae for a period of 4-7 days. 

On a bigger scale, considering connectivity between populations, elemental 

fingerprinting gains importance if this method can distinguish different water masses 

independently of the development stage of the organism.  

 

4.3 Elemental availability effect 

Copper and zinc concentrations in larval shells, according to current experimental 

results, proved to be the least affected by temperature and salinity. Aiming to 

understand if the incorporation of these elements in aragonite shells varies with 

another environmental factor, elemental availability was tested and mussel larvae 

were submitted to different levels of Cu and Zn. 

Cu/Ca ratios showed no significant variance according to the level of Cu/Ca in the 

environmental water. Concerning Zn/Ca ratios, at higher water concentrations it is 

seen a significant decrease of incorporation in larval shells.   Results may suggest that 

the uptake of these elements it is not controlled by environmental factors but 

intrinsically in the organism.  

Metal toxicity in marine organisms has been reported in several studies and more 

recently in bivalves by Beiras &amp;amp; Albentosa (2004) and Nadella et al. (2009). According 

to the first study, among the tested metal range (including Zn, Co, Hg, Pb and Cd) Cu 

was the second most toxic element and the one with the highest risk factor for two 

species, including Mytilus galloprovincialis. Zn followed as the most toxic metal after 

Cu.  In the second experiment, copper and Zn were considered the most toxic metals 

(compared with Zn, Ni e Cd) on Mytilus trossolus when analysed embryo 

development. 

Biological factors regulating Cu and Zn uptake in aragonite shells may represent a 

physiological response to stress conditions. 



 

28 
 

5. Conclusions  

Interest in elemental fingerprinting as a tool to detect larval dispersal and 

connectivity patterns among populations has been growing due to its successful use 

in the latter years. The present work originated results that contribute to the 

comprehension of how trace elements are incorporated in the larval shells of Mytilus 

galloprovincialis being influenced by temperature, salinity, elemental composition of 

the environment and age of the organisms.  

A significant influence of temperature and salinity, for most of the tested elements, 

and a non significant influence from elemental availability and age are verified. 

Salinity significantly contributes to a higher availability of elements in the water and 

in the shells and its interaction with temperature is also significant for most of the 

elements. Moreover the effect temperature has in larval physiological processes 

regulation such as growth rate, planktonik periods, shell secretion and mortality is 

perhaps the main explanation for such incorporations according to temperature 

levels. Nonetheless, regarding age effect, results validate the importance of elemental 

fingerprinting in origin determination of larvae, in studies with a similar time range, 

as it is supported a consistency in chemical signature according to larval development 

stage. The different availability levels of Cu and Zn in water proved to be not 

significant in chemical signatures formation in larval shells. These were also the less 

variable elements found in shells with the effect of temperature and salinity which 

may reflect that its adherence was strongly regulated by other factors. Biological 

factors are here suggested as it is found in literature studies demonstrating these 

elements toxicity in mussel embryos.  

More knowledge of the different factors conditioning elements uptake in carbonate 

structures is required for a more accurate interpretation and use of geochemical 

signatures in natal habitat identification.
