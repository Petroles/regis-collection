RESUMO 

Titular de uma posição preponderante no sector petrolífero, a Sonangol E.P. (designada daqui 

para frente como “Sonangol” ou “Grupo”) é a maior empresa pública a operar em Angola e 

umas das maiores a operar em África. Esta, detém uma linha de negócios que integra toda a 

cadeia de valor referente ao negócio petrolífero, nomeadamente, desde a extracção de 

petróleo e gás natural, até a sua transformação, distribuição e venda ao consumidor final.  

Com uma carteira de investimentos muito diversificada, o Grupo possui interesses e 

investimentos em outros sectores de actividade, que colocam a empresa no topo das maiores 

em termos de receitas e activos em África.  

Contudo, sendo o principal veículo de desenvolvimento económico-financeiro em Angola, 

fruto dos avultados investimentos que realiza tanto no mercado doméstico como no 

internacional, a Sonangol E.P. depara-se com inúmeros desafios futuros consequentes da 

actual conjuntura macroeconómica vivida no País bem como a recente queda dos preços do 

petróleo.  

Assim, este Trabalho Final de Mestrado tem como objetivo avaliar a Sonangol E.P. e 

determinar o valor intrínseco das suas acções, através de um processo exaustivo de análise do 

Grupo, da indústria e das previsões de crescimento. A avaliação foi realizada pelo método do 

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) que de acordo com a revisão de literatura abordada 

pretende conciliar a teoria e prática de modo a se apurar o valor intrínseco das acções da 

empresa. Como resultado desta avaliação, foi possível concluir que a Sonangol detém um 

valor empresarial (enterprise value) de aproximadamente 15 mil milhões de euros, estando o 

valor intrínseco de cada acção a rondar os 9.23 euros.  

Para finalizar, este trabalho providencia uma base sólida de análise para uma possível venda 

parcial ou total da empresa pelo estado Angolano, assim como para o lançamento de um 

possível IPO (initial public offer).  

Palavras-chave: Avaliação de Empresas, Free Cash-Flow to Firm, Enterprise Value,

ABSTRACT 

With a Key position in the sector of Energies, Sonangol E.P. (hereinafter “Sonangol” or 

“Group”) is the largest state-run oil company operating in Angola, the Africa’s second-largest 

crude producer. Holder of a business line that integrates the entire value chain of oil &amp;amp; gas 

business, since its extraction to its distribution and sale to the final costumer, Sonangol holds 

investments and interests in other sectors (transportation, real estate, education, healthcare, 

etc) which places the company on top of the largest firms in terms of assets and revenues 

operating in Angola. However, as the main driving force of the Angolan economy, Sonangol 

presents large future challenges due to the current macroeconomic situation lived in the 

country as well as the actual fall in oil prices. 

This Master’s Final Work aims to determine the underlying enterprise value of Sonangol, 

through a thorough analysis of the Group and the industry as well as its growth prospects. 

The valuation was based on Free Cash Flow to the Firm methodology, which according to 

the established in the literature review, conciliate the theory and practice to reach the real 

value of Sonangol’s share price. 

With this evaluation it was possible to conclude that Sonangol’s enterprise value is EUR 

15.566bn, being the intrinsic value of each share EUR 9.23. 

Therefore this study provides a solid basis of analysis, for possible sale of the company by 

the Angolan state, as well as turning the Group public through an IPO process (Initial Public 

Offer).

1. INTRODUCITON 

The recent drop in oil prices was reflected in the deterioration of the main economies 

dependent on exports of this commodity. Angola, the second largest oil producer in Africa 

and holder of a very dependent economy on exports of oil was no exception. Therefore, 

Sonangol the national company that manages the hydrocarbon resource exploration in Angola 

whose operational and strategic performance in the past has been outstanding, presents now 

a lot of obstacles. 

The aim of this project is to evaluate Sonangol and determine the intrinsic value of its shares, 

with the aim of proposing a possible sale of the company by the Angolan government. The 

dissertation structure addresses the most relevant issues and a common analysis of equity 

research analysis, providing all the information available and necessary for an accurate and 

plausible result. 

Firstly will be conducted the literature review, where it will systematize the main studies and 

publications relating to methods of business valuation, the advantages that underlie each 

method, as well as their applicability. 

Additionally, will be developed a detailed analysis of Sonangol E.P., in order to know its 

history, as well as its strategy, its portfolio and evolution of its operational performance. 

After that, the macroeconomic and industry outlook will be presented in order to anticipate 

the main trends and prospects of the industry and identify the critical success factors that 

could impact the performance of Sonagol and therefore its intrinsic value. For the industry 

analysis a SWOT and Porter Strengths study will be presented. 

At the end will be developed an economic-financial model based on a Free Cash Flow to the 

Firm method (FCFF), which translate the collected information and assumptions in numbers 

and, ultimately, the price target of Sonangol.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

2.1. Brief Overview 

Value is the defining dimension of measurement in a market economy. People invest in the 

expectation that when they sell, the value of each investment will have grown by a sufficient 

amount above its cost to compensate them for the risk they took. Therefore a company 

valuation is the process of determining the current worth / price of an asset or a company. 

According to Damodaran (2006) the value of any asset is a function of the cash flows 

generated by that asset, the life of the asset, the expected growth in the cash flow, and the 

riskiness associated with them. 

 

In the world of corporate finance, understanding the mechanisms of company valuation is an 

indispensable requirement because “valuing the company and its business units helps identify 

sources of economic value creation and destruction within the company” (Fernández 2007)1. 

The valuation of companies is essential in many business contexts, particularly in active 

portfolio management and investment analysis (Damodaran 2002) where analysts and 

investors seek to identify companies whose shares are being traded below their intrinsic value 

in the hope of generating capital gains; mergers and acquisitions (Fernández 2007) identifying 

the maximum price the buyer is willing to pay, as well as the minimum price the seller is 

willing to receive; corporate finance (Goedhart 2005) it enables CEOs to “focus on long-term 

value creation confident that their stock’s market price will eventually reflect their efforts”2, 

litigation / bankruptcy proceedings (Jonathan Berk and Peter deMarzo 2013) intending to 

calculate the value of company assets to later proceed to its sale and meet commitments to 

creditors and shareholders. 

In light of different valuation outcomes (Koller, Goedhart, &amp;amp; Wessels, 2005) argue that the 

final valuation depends on the subjectivity of the assumptions considered, as well as, the way 

that expectations are managed by the analyst/investor making all valuations biased

(Damodaran 2002). The author stresses the fact that there are no precise valuations, and the 

direction and magnitude of the bias in valuations are directly proportional to who 

pays/required the service and how much it is paid. 

2.2. Valuation Methods 

The existing valuation methods are grouped according to their authors. Fernández (2007) 

basis his valuation on 6 different groups, while Damodaran (2006) basis his valuation on 4 

different groups – i) Discounted Cash-Flow Valuation, ii) Liquidation and Accounting 

Valuation, iii) Relative Valuation and iv) Contingent Claim Valuation.

2.2.1. Discounted Cash Flows – DCF  

Discounted Cash Flow Valuation is a method that estimates the value of any asset by 

discounting back the expected cash flows on that asset at a rate that reflects their riskiness 

(Damodaran 2006). As mentioned by the author an evaluation process measures the intrinsic 

value of an asset and the actual value of a company, and points out that “there are literally 

thousands of discounted cash flow models in existence”3 1e, to work around this, chooses to 

categorize it into three groups: i) Equity Valuation; ii) Firm Valuation; iii) Adjusted Present 

Value (APV) Valuation. 

2.2.1.1. Equity Valuation Models 

In equity valuation models, analysts/investors attempts to assess the company from the 

shareholders perspective where the cash flows are considered belonging to the equity holders 

and discounted at the rate of return required by them (cost of equity).

Edition – University Edition, New York: John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Inc.

In this category it can be found two different models: i) Dividend Discount Model (DDM), in 

which the expected cash flow to the equity is equivalent to the expected shareholders 

dividends in perpetuity; ii) Free cash flow to the equity (FCFE), which are considered all 

cash flows distributed to shareholders, as well as the potentials, i.e. those that the company 

generates, but for some reason chooses not to distribute. 

? Dividend Discount Model (DDM) 

Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a method for valuing the price of a stock for a company 

which pays out dividends, assuming that the price of a stock is equivalent to the sum of all of 

its future dividend payments discounted to the present value. In general, the value of each 

action is given by: 

[1] ????? ????? = ?
?(????????? ??? ?????)? 

(1+??)?

?=?

?=1
 

Various theories and variants of this base model have been developed to include the fact that 

companies distribute an amount of dividends depending on the development stage they are 

in.  

 

In 1962, Gordon developed a model (Gordon Growth Model or Constant Growth Model) 

which states that, for companies with a stable growth and no dividend retain, the value of 

their equity can be represented as a growing perpetuity based on the expected dividend of the 

next period (Foerster and Sapp, 2005), confirming the need to estimate the annual dividends 

in perpetuity. 

[2] ????? ????? = ?
?(????????? ??? ?????)? 

(1+??)?

?=?

?=1
 

In this method still stands out the development of two models that circumvent the limitations 

imposed by the general DDM and Gordon Growth Model. The first model mentioned by 

Damodaran (2006) is a natural extension of Gordon model data which includes two stages of 

growth: i) an initial period where the growth rate is not stable dividend and then ii) stabilizes 

and is expected to remain in perpetuity. 

 



 

5 
 

The second model, made by Fuller and Hsia (1984), is also a two-stage model, but initially 

assumes that the growth rate of the dividend increases linearly until a sustainable growth. 

? Free cash flow to the equity – FCFE 

FCFE values a company’s equity by computing future cash flows to equity and discounting 

them at the expected cost of equity. Traditional CFE represent what is available for 

distribution to shareholders after capital expenditures and net working capital needs have 

been met, as well as, financial obligations (Damodaran, 2002 and 2006). 

[3] Free Cash Flow to Equity = Net Income – Capital Expenditures + Depreciations - ? Non-Cash 

Working Capital + (New Debt Issued – Debt Payments) 

Damodaran (2006) compares DDM with FCFE, renaming the latter “potential dividend 

model”4, it means that if a company was to pay out to its shareholders all its cash flows after 

debt payment and reinvestment needs, both DDM (considering company doesn’t inflate 

dividends by borrowing) and FCFE methods would yield the same value for the company. 

2.2.1.2. Firm Valuation Models 

These models develops another approach to valuation where the entire firm is valued, by 

discounting the cumulated cash flows to all claim holders (shareholders or creditors) in the 

firm by the weighted average cost of capital (the cost of capital approach) (Damodaran, 2006) 

or by adding the marginal impact of debt on value to the unlevered firm value (adjusted 

present value approach) (Kaplan and Ruback, 1995). Within this category of evaluation, the 

main models are the Free Cash Flow to Firm – FCFF and the Economic Value Added – EVA. 

In this project is only referenced the first model that will be used to assess Sonangol. 

? Free Cash Flow to Firm – FCFF 

The FCFF model correspond to the sum of the cash flows that all holders of the company 

(e.g. common and preferred shareholders and creditors) are entitled. 

                                                           
4 Damodaran, A. (2006), Valuation Approaches and Metrics: A Survey of the Theory and Evidence, Stern School of 
Business, New York University 



 

6 
 

Damodaran (2002) defends that the cash flow to the firm can be measured in two ways. One 

is to add up the cash flows to all the different claim holders in the firm. Thus, the cash flows 

to equity investors (which take the form of dividends or stock buybacks) are added to the cash 

flows to debt holders (interest and net debt payments) to arrive at the cash flow to the firm. 

The other approach to estimating cash flow to the firm, which should yield equivalent results, 

is to estimate the cash flow to the firm prior to debt payments but after reinvestment needs 

have been met. 

[4] ???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? (????) = ???? (1 ? ??? ????) ? (??????? ???????????? ?

????????????) ? ?????? ?? ??????? ??????? ??????? 

The difference between capital expenditures and depreciation (net capital expenditures) and 

the increase in noncash working capital represent the reinvestments made by the firm to 

generate future or contemporaneous growth.  

Another way of representing the same equation is to sum up the net capital expenditures and 

the change in working capital, and state that value as a percentage of the after-tax operating 

income. This ratio of reinvestment to after-tax operating income is called the reinvestment 

rate, and the free cash flow to the firm can be written as: 

[5] ???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? (????) = ???? (1 ? ??? ????)–  ??????? ???????????? +

 ????????????? + ???????????? –  ? ??????? ??????? ±  ????? ??? ???? ????? 

Many authors argue that this model can serve multiple purposes. According to Goedhart et al 

(2005a), this model should be used in the evaluation of investment projects and in the 

evaluation of companies with multiple businesses; contrary to Damodaran (2002 and 2006) 

and Fernández (2009) who argue that this model should only be used in the evaluation of 

companies that claim to have a fixed capital structure. 

? Terminal Value or Continuity/Perpetuity Value 

According to Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback (1996), the FCFF Model is the most commonly-used DCF 

approach, on which the value of a leveraged firm can be calculated by discounting the 

unleveraged cash flows to the firm at the firm weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 



 

7 
 

Thus: 

[6] ???? ????? = ? 1??
?????

(1+????)?
+

?????+1/(????????)

(1+????)1
  

Indeed, this formula is composed by two stages: the first is computed the present value of 

cash-flows up to some preselected horizon date (n), which according to Ohlson &amp;amp; Zhang 

(1999) is rarely superior to 15 years; and the second is calculated to the present value of cash-

flows beyond the horizon date referred as the terminal value (TGR represents the terminal 

growth rate). 

? WACC Rate  

As mentioned above, one of the commonly-used discount rate in cash flow calculation 

approaches is the tax-adjusted discount rate or weighted average cost of capital (Kaplan &amp;amp; 

Ruback, 1996)5. According to this “method”, WACC represents a weighted average of the 

after-tax costs of different sources of capital (equity and debt), in which each one is weighted 

by the fraction of the capital structure it represents (Luehrman, 1997). 

 

The weighted average cost of capital – WACC combines the rates of return required by 

shareholders and creditors and is calculated as follows: 

[7] ???? =
?

?+?
?? +

?

?+?
??(1 ? ??);  where Re is the cost of equity and Rd is the cost of debt, 

E is the equity and D the debt, and Tc is the corporate tax rate. 

Indeed, WACC’s main advantage is that it bundles the two sources of capital together in order 

to discount them only once. 

?  WACC variables: 

- Cost of Equity (Re) 

The cost of equity is the rate of return investors require on an equity investment in a firm 

(Damodaran, 2002). The most common theories to measure the cost of equity is the Capital 

Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe 1964), Fama-French Three-Factor Model (Fama e

French, 1992) and the Arbitrage Price Theory (APT) (Ross 1976), being the most used the 

CAPM model which according to Damodaran (2002) is “the risk and return model that has 

been in use the longest and is still the standard in most real world analyses”6. 

 

According to Kaplan and Peterson (1998), the CAPM defines linear relationship between the 

cost of equity and the slope coefficient (beta) in a regression of the company’s equity returns. 

In other words, the CAPM embodied by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Black (1972) 

conclude that the return of an asset is the sum of the risk-free rate and the risk-premium, 

which depends on beta. In order to calculate the expected return one needs the following 

inputs; risk free rate, security’s beta, equity risk premium and country risk premium if 

applicable. 

[8] ???? ?? ?????? = ?? +  ?? (?? ? ??) + CRP 

- Risk Free Interest Rate (Rf) 

In theory, a riskless asset can be defined as one for which the investor knows the expected 

returns with certainty, meaning that there is no default risk or risks associated with 

reinvestment. Damodaran (2008) considers that the only assets that meet these criteria are 

zero-cupon government bonds, without risk of bankruptcy, whose maturity is equal to the 

cash flows being discounted. Another important aspect to note is the fact that the risk-free 

interest rate and the cash flows must be in the same currency, otherwise the assessment may 

be biased by the inflation value. This is particularly severe in economies with high inflation 

rate (Damodaran, 2008). 

- Beta (?)  

Beta is the risk parameter of an individual asset, according to (Fama &amp;amp; French, 2004) “the 

market beta of asset I is the covariance of its return with the market return divided by the 

variance of the market return”7.

Economic Perspectives, 18(3): 25-46

As beta is not directly observed on the market, it has to be estimated, which means developing 

a set of assumptions and methodologies. 

According to Damodaran (2002), the conventional approach to estimating the beta of an 

investment is a regression of returns on the investment against returns on a market index over 

a reasonable time period. In practice there is a tendency to use a stock index, such as for 

example S&amp;amp;P500, as a proxy for the market portfolio, and estimate betas for stocks against 

the index. 

The standard procedure for estimating betas is to regress stock returns against market returns, 

where the slope of the regression corresponds to the beta of the stock and measures the 

riskiness of the stock. 

 

As an alternative to linear regression, may be used the beta of the unlevered beta of industry 

as an operating company – ??, since companies operating in the same industry are exposed 

to similar operational risks (Goedhart et al 2005a). In turn, the beta of a leveraged company 

– ?? can be obtained from its operating beta, using one of the three theories presented in the 

following table: 

Table II - Beta Approaches 

 

- Risk Premium  

The risk premium is a significant input in all the asset pricing models. According to 

Damodaran (2002) the risk premium measures the “extra return” that would be demanded by 

investors for shifting their money from a riskless investment to an average risk investment”. 

In the standard approach to estimating equity risk premiums three basic approaches are used 

– the survey approach, where investors or managers are asked to provide estimates of the 

equity risk premium for the future, the historical return approach, where the premium is based 

upon how well equities have done in the past and the implied approach, where we use future 

Fernández (2003) Damodaran (2002) Goedhart et al (2005ª)

cash flows or observed bond default spreads to estimate the current equity risk premium 

(Damodaran, 2012 and Fernández, 2004). 

The most common approach to estimating the risk premium is to base it on historical data by 

looking to the difference between average returns on stocks and average returns on riskless 

securities over an extended period of history. 

- Cost of Debt (Rd) 

The cost of debt measures the current cost to the firm of borrowing funds to finance projects. 

The simplest scenario for estimating the cost of debt occurs when a firm has long-term bonds. 

The market price of the bond, in conjunction with its cupon and maturity can serve to compute 

a yield which is used as the cost of debt. 

When no rating is available to estimate the cost of debt, Damodaran (2002) suggests checking 

the recent bank borrowing history or estimating a synthetic rating using interest coverage 

ratio. 

2.2.1.3. Adjusted Present Value Model – APV  

The Adjusted Present Value (APV), as developed by Myers (1974), defines the value of a 

levered firm as the value of an otherwise identical but unlevered firm plus the value of any 

“side effects” due to leverage. These side effects often include the tax shield of debt, expected 

bankruptcy costs, and agency costs. The APV provides a powerful framework for analyzing 

a variety of issues in corporate finance, and is especially useful in applications of corporate 

valuation. 

[9]?????????? ????? =  ?
?????

(1+??)?
+  

?????+1 (????)

(1+??)?
?=?
?=1 + ??( ??? ??????) ?  ?? (?????????? ?????) 

According to Luehrman (1997), APV is highly helpful in the valuation of cross-border 

takeovers, although the use of the correct valuation approach depends on the nature of a firm’s 

capital structure (Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback, 1996). Indeed, the APV represents a model which can 

incorporate easily the impact of dividend policy, or even transaction costs in financing, and 

is extraordinarily transparent concerning in adjustments to the discount rate (Myers, 1974). 



 

11 
 

Notwithstanding, the APV concept presents certain handicaps: first of all, the income from 

stocks can be taxed in a different way, when the investor files a personal tax return; in 

addition, analysts usually ignore the use of other financing side effects in order to avoid 

complexity in getting the APV estimation (Luehrman, 1997). 

 

According to Damodaran (2002) there are many authors who believe that adjusted present 

value is a more flexible way of approaching valuation than traditional discounted cash flow 

models. This may be true in a generic sense, but APV valuation in practice has significant 

flaws. The first and most important is that most practitioners who use the adjusted present 

value model ignore expected bankruptcy costs. Adding the tax benefits to unlevered firm 

value to get to the levered firm value makes debt seem like an unmixed blessing. Firm value 

will be overstated, especially at very high debt ratios, where the cost of bankruptcy is clearly 

not zero and, in some instances, the cost of bankruptcy is higher than the tax benefit of debt. 

2.2.2. Relative Valuation  

In discounted cash flow valuation, the objective is to find the value of assets, given their 

cash flow, growth, and risk characteristics. In relative valuation, the objective is to value 

assets, based on how similar assets are currently priced in the market. 

To compare the values of “similar” assets in the market, it needs to standardize the values in 

some way. They can be standardized relative to the earnings they generate, to the book value 

or replacement value of the assets themselves, or to the revenues that they generate 

(Damodaran, 2002). 

Damodaran (2002) argued that evaluations based on multiple i) require fewer assumptions, 

so they become more rapid than the DCF valuations; ii) are simpler to present to clients; iii) 

reflect the state of the market, given that assess the relative value of assets rather than its 

intrinsic value. 

Kaplan and Ruback (1995) add that the relative valuation presents better performance than 

the DCF valuation, as it incorporates the market expectations of the future cash flows and 



 

12 
 

interest rates. However, these authors found that the absence of similar companies can be a 

counter of this method. 

Damodaran (2002) also added that the facility associated with this method may result in an 

inconsistent estimate because critical variables such as the level of risk, growth and cash flow 

potential, can be ignored. In addition, this author also emphasizes the ease of manipulation of 

some multiple (via the lack of transparency relative to the underlying assumptions) and the 

fact that market context is directly reflected in the evaluation, which can cause the (sub) or 

overestimate. 

 

Therefore, Fernández (2002) defended that multiples are useful in a second stage of the 

valuation: after performing the valuation using another method, a comparison with the 

multiples of comparable firms enables analysts to gage the valuation performed and identify 

differences between the firms valued and the firms it is compared with.

2.2.3. Contingent Claim Valuation 

Contingent claim valuation, most commonly known as option theory, “uses option pricing 

models to measure the value of assets that share option characteristics” (Damoradan, 2006). 

For Luehrman (1997) “Option Pricing methods are most adequate to be used when valuing 

opportunities”8. For some companies (e.g. new technologies or fast-growing markets) 

opportunities are their most valuable “asset”. Option valuation is used to decide whether or 

not to make a decision, having in mind the specific circumstances involved. This flexibility 

that options give are of great value and its impact on a company’s valuation is not considered 

in the methodologies explained before. The most widely used option pricing models are the

binomial and the Black-Scholes model. However, due to the complexity of these models and 

given the fact that they will not be applied on Sonangol’s valuation due to the lack of 

information, no further analysis will be presented. 

2.2.4. Asset Based Valuation  

In the asset-based approach, primary emphasis is placed on the fair market value of the assets 

and liabilities of a business (Damodaran, 2006). As a result, this approach uses three methods 

that consider the value of individual assets and liabilities. The first is the Liquidation Value, 

where the company's value is determined by the sum of recipes developed with the liquidation 

of its assets. The second one is the Replacement Cost in the company's value and represents 

the full costs that the company would have to replace all of its assets. The latest model is the 

book value, where it is considered that the company's value corresponds to the book value of 

its assets. 

 

Considering that there are several accounting standards (e.g. GAAP and IFRS), comparability 

between companies from different sectors and countries may be called into question as well 

as the ease with which some companies accounting purposes manipulate cash flows and thus 

the value of the company.

3. COMPANY PRESENTATION 

Established in 1976 Sonangol – (“Sociedade Nacional de Combustíveis de Angola, E.P.”) is 

an integrated oil and gas Angolan state-owned company whose mission is the management 

of hydrocarbon resource exploration in the country while maintaining its ongoing 

commitment to the development and growth of Angola. Despite having the government as 

the sole shareholder, Sonangol has always been governed as a private company and is under 

strict performance standards to ensure efficiency and productivity. 

 

Sonangol's activities include exploration, development, marketing, production, transportation 

and refining of hydrocarbons and its derivatives. Those activities can be performed 

independently or in association with other companies - national or foreign. As the 

concessionaire, in 2014 Sonangol held stakes in 17 of the 26 blocks explored in Angola, 

reaching an average daily production of 1.6mn barrels of oil and 1.2mn bcm’s per year of dry 

natural gas. The Group holds 18 subsidiaries and exports oil and its derivatives mainly to 16 

countries, namely: Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Japan, India, Italy, Netherland, 

Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, USA, Uruguay and Taiwan. 

As the country's main investment vehicle, Sonangol owns a diversified portfolio of 

investments both in domestic and international market, operating at this point in several other 

industries beyond the Energy Industry, namely: air services, telecommunications services, 

financial services, real estate, medical and medicines services, education and training 

services. 

 

Sonangol E.P. is based in Luanda, Angola with additional offices in Brazzaville, Congo; 

Hong Kong; Houston, Texas; London, United Kingdom; and Singapore.

3.1 Business Portfolio 

Sonangol’s business model consists of five primary business segments: 

Table IV - Sonangol Business Portfolio 

3.2 Strategy and Future Goals 

The Angolan government is targeting a daily average production of 1.8mn barrels (bbl) of oil 

in 2015. This is an increase of 10% relative to the growth rate foreseen in the General State 

Budget (OGE). Meanwhile, Sonangol E.P. plans to spend USD 8.8bn on exploration in the 

next decade, targeting an output of 2mn barrels per day (b/d) by 2017. China will lend USD 

2bn to Sonangol to aid in the expansion of oil and gas projects. The financing agreement will 

last for 10 years, and the first project that will benefit from the fund will be the 200,000 b/d 

SonaRef oil refinery in Lobito. 

 

Sonangol is planning to launch a bidding round for exploration of 12 new offshore oil blocks 

in 2015. Sonangol can sit back confidently and watch its international oil company operated 

projects begin to haul in impressive returns. Through careful placing of JV contracts, the firm 

benefits from the most up-to-date exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) techniques, and the 

group’s reserves and profits look set to grow organically, without the need for any policy 

change or acquisition moves. The announcement that Angola is now China’s largest supplier 

of oil is encouraging news for Sonangol. Meanwhile, JVs will lead to the transfer of know-

how, technical equipment and financial backing, benefiting production levels. Amid strong

relations with China, Beijing stands to benefit, while Angola’s membership of OPEC should 

bring significant technological and financial benefits, as well as increasing the government 

and Sonangol’s influence in international energy markets. 

- Angola LNG 

Regarding the natural gas sector, Angola LNG project is a JV of the major producers in the 

country including Sonangol, Chevron, BP, Eni and Total. Angola LNG plant has a processing 

capacity of 7.2n cubic meters (bcm) per annum and it is now under a massive reconstruction 

to fix design defects and corrosion of almost-new equipment. Officially, the plant will remain 

closed until mid-2015. However, extension of the closure could reportedly extend into 2016, 

depending on the scale of the renovation work. 

- Discoveries and Surveys 

Italian oil and gas company Eni has encountered a new deep-water oil discovery offshore in 

Angola with an estimated capacity to produce 300mn bbl of oil.  

The Spain's Repsol will provide Sonangol with the tools for a seismic survey of the oil 

reserves in the so-called pre-salt layer. Under the terms of an agreement signed between the 

two companies, Sonangol's engineers will have the right to use the advanced technology 

designed by Repsol, to use it to survey oil reserves in the pre-salt layer.  

3.3. Operational Performance 

Analyzing the historical financial statements of Sonangol, it was possible to draw briefly the 

company's performance in terms of operational profit, debt capacity and realized investment 

as referenced below. 

- Turnover  

Until an alternative fuel source becomes readily available, oil will be in high demand allowing 

vertically integrated oil companies to generate astronomical revenues. In addition, the oil and 

gas production is capital intensive, especially when fuel costs are high. Given that, on the last 



 

17 
 

three years of analysis, Sonangol E.P. presented a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) 

of 3.6% in the Total Turnover. The fiscal year (“FY”) of 2014 Sonangol recorded a total 

Turnover of approx. EUR 28.6bn, a decrease of 4.4% compared to the FY2013 due to the 

declining of oil prices registered on last quarter of the year as well as the decrease of 2.56% 

in the total production. 

Sonangol’s Net Income in 2014 was approx. EUR 1.1bn, a decrease of 49% comparing to the 

previous year.  

- EBITDA  

Regarding EBITDA, in FY2014 the company totaled EUR 4.9bn compared to EUR 5.2bn in 

FY2013, a decrease of 5.6%. This decrease influenced by the serious “crise” recorder in oil 

prices, resulted in an EBITDA margin of 17.1% in FY2014, strengthening the company’s 

EBITDA with a CAGR of 2.3%.  

 

Analyzing EBITDA margins by business segment it is possible to highlight that upstream 

segment was the largest contributor to the positive EBITDA margin with approx. 16%, 

followed by the Downstream and Midstream segment with EBITDA margin of 3.7% and 

0.4% respectively. 

It should be noted that Sonangol is the market leader in the downstream segment in Angola, 

because it is the only company responsible for the distribution of O&amp;amp;G products to the final 

customer. In what concerns to the upstream segment, Sonangol holds approx. 44% market 

share being the market leader in Angola.  

- Investments 

In terms of investment, in FY2014 the company comprised 88% of its investments in mining 

activity (research, development and exploration) and 12% in other financial investments (real 

estate projects and financial markets, more specifically energy funds) accounting for a total 

amount of EUR 14bn. This value had presented an increase of approx. 16% compared to 

FY2013 where the company recorded an investment amount of EUR 12bn. 

 



 

18 
 

It is notable that until the year 2014 Sonangol E.P. had about 80 participations in other 

companies. Highlighting the most important, it is to point out the majority stake in 8 banks 

(4 in Angola and 2 in Portugal) making it quite accessible the company’s recourse to bank 

credit. The net value of the investment in subsidiaries in 2014 was approx. of EUR 4.4bn. 

- Leverage  

Following the investments growth recorded in 2014 the company increased its debt to approx. 

EUR 12bn, an increase of 30% regarding FY2013 with approx. EUR 9.9bn. Nearly 82% of 

the Sonangol’s debt was from long-term debt and the remaining 18% short-term debt. The 

Sonangol’s current debt ratio for FY2014 was 29.5%. The net debt value presented in FY2014 

was c. EUR 7.2bn and the Leverage ratio was 1.47x (Net Debt to EBITDA). 

- Financial Structure  

Analyzing Sonangol’s Financial Structure it is possible to highlight that the company has 

been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. Most of this funding was resorted to long 

term debt (Debt Structure of 30%), reducing the treasury cash pressure. The financial strength 

seems ensured, because it has 36% more Equity than the Total Debt subscribed. Sonangol 

presented in FY2014 a positive Working Capital value, showing that the company is in 

equilibrium in the short term, once the current assets are sufficient to pay current liabilities. 

The company has a financial solvency ratio of 1.36x a high value that proves the financial 

soundness of Sonangol. 

- Treasury 

In 2014 Sonangol E.P., permanent capital only covered 87% of the value of fixed assets, with 

the remaining 13% being financed by short-term debt. It is aware that this situation only 

occurred in the FY2014, and despite this, the company achieved a positive net treasury value 

of EUR 3.4bn. It is noteworthy that despite this problem of financial structure, Sonangol has 

access to short-term credit and generate sufficient cash to support the interests.

4. INDUSTRY AND MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW 

On this chapter it will be analysed the macroeconomic scenario in countries9 where Sonangol 

EP concentrates its activities mainly through exports, using as main sources statistical data of 

the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Business Monitor International 

(BMI). 

4.1 Macroeconomic Outlook 

? Angola  

Angola’s economy is strongly dependent on hydrocarbons, with oil comprising 38% of GDP, 

more than 70% of fiscal revenues and more than 90% of merchandise export earnings. This 

has served the nation well during periods of rising commodity prices but could again become 

a handicap, especially after oil output begins to decline from 2014 onwards. 

Economic diversification is proceeding but at a slow pace. Angola thus experienced a sharp 

slowdown in 2009, followed by a strong rebound in 2010 and 2011. The currency is heavily 

managed against the US dollar, which creates a structural rigidity that reduces the ability of 

the economy to respond to macroeconomic shocks and makes it difficult for local producers 

to compete with cheap imports. 

Despite falling oil prices, headline economic growth in Angola will continue to be supported 

by the non-oil economy and it is predictable that real GDP growth will expand by 4.50% in 

2015 and 3.90% in 2016, driven by capital-intensive industries such as energy, construction 

and transport.

? China  

As the largest economic partner of Angola and the largest customer of Sonangol representing 

approx. 47% of the Group exports, has recently present alarming indications. Analysts predict

that economic growth in China will continue to fall in 2015, with GDP growth estimated to 

be between 6.0%-7.0%. Rather than experiencing an abrupt crash, the economy is slowly 

downshifting from high to medium growth. By category, manufacturing activities seemed to 

lose steam whereas the service sector held up well.  

A confluence of growth headwinds led to the slowdown: first, persistent external uncertainty, 

arising from the imbalanced recovery in advanced countries, continued to weighed on China’s 

exports; second, the enforcement of the new budget law has led to fiscal consolidation at the 

local government level and thereby depressed aggregate demand; third, the recently 

implemented easing measures, including two interest rate cuts and two RRR cuts. Deflation 

risk is on the rise. Moreover, a number of factors could exacerbate the price stability, 

including the potential burst of property bubble, the over-capacity in certain industries, the 

high debt level of the corporate sector and the ageing of population. Given the size of the 

Chinese economy in absolute terms, this slowdown is natural, and unlike after previous 

slowdowns, a significant rebound in growth should not be expected.

? India  

India the second largest Sonangol’s client, comprises 13% of its exports. The outlook for 

India is for economic strengthening through higher infrastructure spending, increased fiscal 

devolution to states, and continued reform to financial and monetary policy. The government 

underscored its intention to move steadily to tackle politically difficult structural issues that 

have stalled investment and limited economic performance in recent years. Growth in the 

gross domestic product is expected to accelerate to 7.4% in FY2015 on improved 

performance in both industry and services as policy addresses structural bottlenecks and 

external demand improves. In 2014 India recorded a GDP growth of 7.1%, with industry 

growing 5.8%. In macroeconomic terms India has excellent indicators, with this beneficial 

way for business Sonangol.

? Canada 

Canada is the third largest customer of the Group comprising c. 6.0% of its exports of crude. 

Despite the financial and economic strength of the country the macroeconomic forecast for 

this country is not the most favourable. The negative effects of the oil shock on Canada’s 

economy are expected to have a more immediate effect than previously estimated. The impact 

on household spending, terms of trade and investment, particularly in the oil and gas sector 

are already becoming apparent. As for the external sector the bank of Canada has estimated 

that Canada’s term of trade will fall 9.0% by the end of 2015 as a result of suppressed oil 

export values. Meanwhile, figures for GDP 2015 showed that it is expected an increase of 

2.16%.

? Spain 

Comprising c. 6.0% of Sonangol’s exports, a robust growth is projected in Spain over the 

next two years, driven by very supportive financial conditions, as well as the depreciation of 

the euro, lower oil prices and strengthening trading partner growth. Renewed consumer 

confidence and increasing fixed investment drove the economy to record its largest expansion 

since 2007, consolidating the country’s place as one of the fastest growing economies in the 

Eurozone. Meanwhile, figures for GDP 2015 showed that it is expected an increase of 2.5%. 

? South Africa and Taiwan  

Both countries share approximately 5% of Sonangol’s exports. Regarding South Africa GDP 

growth is expected to pick up marginally in 2015. The continued recovery in the mining and 

manufacturing sectors after the strike-affected first half of 2014 should support growth to 

some extent. However, infrastructure bottlenecks (mainly electricity), subdued private sector 

fixed investment and muted growth in consumer and government consumption spending

means that a meaningful acceleration is not on the cards. Therefore it is expected a growth of 

2.00% in GDP in FY2015. 

In the other hand, Taiwan’s economy slowed slightly in the first quarter of 2015, growing 

3.4% over the same period of the previous year. However the slowdown came largely on the 

back of falling government spending’s. Moreover, recent data paint a hazy picture of the 

economy with exports recorded the largest drop in over a year and the manufacturing fell into 

contractionary territory for the first time since 2013. The GDP expected for 2015 is presents 

an increase of 3.81%.

? Other Countries 

Sonangol holds commercial and economic links with many other countries in Europe and 

Americas whose exports to these countries does not weigh more than 3%. (Appendix 2). 

Economic growth in the EU remains sluggish, however the fall in crude oil prices are should 

provide a welcome boost to growth. Regarding Americas, with especial attention to the Latin 

America the grow will be low in 2015 and 2016, mainly influenced by the financial volatility 

in China, the impact of lower commodity prices and internal economic and political problems 

in prioritizing and speeding up fixed capital investments and productivity.  

4.2 Industry Overview 

? Energy Market Overview 

After colossal growth in 2011, the global market fell in to marginal decline in 2012 followed 

by weak growth in 2013. Due to a huge fall in oil prices beginning in late 2014, 2015 has 

seen a dramatic decline within the market followed by very weak growth for the remainder 

of the forecast period (Appendix.9)

On November 27th 2014, OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) failed 

to reach an agreement over the curbing of production of oil which in turn sent prices tumbling. 

This has had such an effect due to the fact that OPEC controls approximately 40% of the 

global market. The market is dictated partly by supply and demand and energy is very closely 

related to economic activity. There are a number of factors that have played a part in the oil 

price slump. The poor global economic performance as well increased efficiency and 

alternative energy sources has led to reduced demand plus with OPEC deciding not to curb 

production, there is almost a surplus of oil. To add to this, the US has become the world's 

largest producer of oil and has no need for the level of imports as it previously had in the past. 

Finally, Gulf oil producers have decided not to reduce production to restore price to what is 

classed as normal today. 

  

The global oil and gas market generated in 2014 a total revenue of USD 3,073.4bn, 

representing a CAGR of 6.7% between 2010 and 2014. In comparison, the European and 

Asia-Pacific markets grown with CAGRs of 3.8% and 8% respectively, over the same period, 

to reach respective values of USD 689.5bn and 

USD 1,065.8bn in 2014. Market consumption 

volume is forecast to increase with a CAGR of 

1.2% between 2010-2014, to reach a total of 

46,792.5 million barrels equivalent (BOE) in 

2014. The market's volume is expected to rise to 49,097.2 million barrels equivalent (BOE) 

by the end of 2019, representing a CAGR of 1% for the 2014-2019 period. 

Crude oil sales had the highest volume in the global oil and gas market in 2014, with total 

sales of 29,632.9 million barrels, equivalent to 63.3% of the market's overall volume. In 

comparison, sales of natural gas reached a volume of 17,159.7 million barrels equivalent 

(BOE) in 2014, equating to 36.7% of the market total.

The performance of the market is forecast to 

decline, CAGR of -6.5% for the five-year period 

2014 - 2019, which is expected to drive the market 

to a value of USD 2,196.7bn by the end of 2019. 

Comparatively, the European and Asia-Pacific 

markets will decline with CARCs of -7% and -

7.2% respectively, over the same period, to reach 

respective values of USD479bn and USD734.7bn. 

 

? Angola  

The outlook for Angola's oil sector remains broadly positive, with highly prospective offshore 

acreage and a number of major projects under development. However, sustained lower oil 

prices pose downside risk to production growth post-2020, as rapid natural decline rates and 

a slowdown in investment combine to undercut output levels. Gas production will remain 

limited throughout 10-year forecast period due to low domestic consumption, unfavorable 

pricing dynamics and demand constraints in key export markets. 

? Central and Eastern Europe  

Russia will remain the dominant force in all areas of oil and gas in the Central and Eastern 

European region over the next 10 years despite sanctions and weak oil prices. The bulk of 

both oil and gas production growth will come from Caspian countries and head to China. It 

is expected that the refining sector would struggle, with only Turkey and Turkmenistan 

expected to build new facilities, though significant investments will go into modernization 

across the region.

5.2. PORTER’S FIVE FORCES 

 

The analysis of Porter’s five forces is discussed in detail in Appendix 8. 

Strengths Weakness 

? Control of all key hydrocarbons interests; 
? Unrivalled access to exploration acreage; 
? Substantial production upside potential; 
? International oil companies provide much project 

funding; 
? National market leader in the upstream and 

downstream segments; 
? Sonangol has a number of subsidiaries and retail 

brands which provide the company with 
diversified revenue portfolio rather than simply 
relying on its energy business; 

? Positive and consolidate working capital, where 
current assets cover short-term obligations; 

? Integrated business operations enable the 
company to respond more effectively to changes 
in the business environment; 

? Strong capacity to invest in training, equipment 
and new technologies; 

? Strong operational and profit margins; 

? Limited financial or operational freedom; 
? Cost and efficiency disadvantages; 
? Lack of geographic diversification; 
? High costs in the refining of crude oil, and 

importing the same refined oil due to low 
refining capacity in Angola; 

? No developed alternative energy products to the 
extent that it could and continue to rely on oil as 
its main business segment, which is not a 
sustainable strategy; 

? Little diversified funding sources; 
? The permanent capital only cover 87% of the 

value of fixed assets, putting pressure on the 
treasury, requiring short-term debt to 

compensate it.  

Opportunities Threats 

? Substantial output growth as a result of 

international firms’ investment; 
? Considerable untapped gas export potential; 
? Large areas of unexplored territory; 
? Easy access to credit, as holds majority stakes in 

8 Banks; 
? Expansion through several acquisitions will 

improve its asset position and strengthen its top-
line growth; 

? Potential of becoming a market leader in many 
alternative fuel and energy markets if it can 
invest in research and reposition is strategy. 
These markets opportunities include wind, solar 
and hydrogen; 

? Significant opportunity to meet increasing 
demands for energy in many development 

? Delays to LNG exports; 
? Substantial additional costs; 
? Local political unrest; 
? Changes in national and international energy 

policy; 
? Strong dependence on China, since China 

purchase 43% of Sonangol’s oil; 
? Currency fluctuations with AOA/USD, USD/EUR 

and USD/YUAN; 
? Economic pressure, especially in terms of 

volatile oil prices around the world, furthering 
the need to focus on the migration to alternative 
fuel for its energy solutions; 

? Exploratory drilling risks and environmental 
issues may be a threat if the company does not 
formalize its corporate social responsibility and 
put it at the forefront of its strategy, including 
revising workplace safety issues in order to 
reduce refinery explosions, oil leaks and spills, 
pipeline corrosions and other environmental

6. EVALUATION 

6.1 Methodology 

To assess the value of Sonangol EP two different valuation methods were used: Free Cash 

Flow to the Firm (FCFF) and Multiples valuation. The first, as explained in the Literature 

Review, is a Discounted Cash-Flow (DCF) based method, while the latter involves relative 

valuation. 

This methodology besides being the most widely used by investors and managers in the 

evaluation of companies is also the most appropriate to evaluate the Sonangol EP, given the 

firm’s current capital structure of approximately 40% debt. At the beginning the idea was to 

evaluate Sonangol in separate by the SOTP (Sum of the Parts) methodology, considering the 

company’s different business units. However, due to lack of available information about the 

different companies that comprise the Sonangol’s business lines, the option was considered 

to evaluate the company as a whole. 

Relative to the time horizon of the projections was set an explicit period of five years. For the 

projection of the value in perpetuity was assumed a growth rate (g) of 0.7%. All cash-flows 

will be determined in Euros. 

6.2 Assumptions 

To determine the value of Sonangol E.P. was defined a set of assumptions about the projection 

of FCFF and the discount rate, which will be presented below. 

6.2.1 Operational Assumptions 

? Revenues 

The initial approaches in the estimation of Sonangol’s revenues was based on two reports 

from BMI “Angola Oil and Gas report Q2 2015”, EIA “Annual Energy Outlook 2015 with 

projections to 2040” as well as the macroeconomic data designed to Angola by the 

International Monetary Fund. The BMI report discloses a wide range of data concerning the 

current Energy Sector in Angola, highlighting in particular the evolution of production, 

competitiveness and exports of oil and natural gas derivatives. On the other hand the report 



 

27 
 

based on EIA has been used to analyze the evolution of the Energy Sector in the world. 

Alongside, it’s was important to forecast the consumption of the refined petroleum products 

in the world specifically in the OPEC countries.  

Furthermore, given Sonangol’s EP long-term strategies, the investments in capital 

expenditures (CAPEX) and the crude oil contango10 market situation, the expected growth 

rate for sales are not very promising at the moment compared to previous years. According 

to the study performed, it was found that negative growth rates are forecasted in the short-

run, with an ongoing average growth rate of -5% in revenues for the years of 2015/16. For 

the remaining periods, a higher growth rate is forecasted mainly influenced by the growth of 

the exports of dry natural gas in Angola as well as the inauguration of the new Lobito’s 

refinery that will have the capacity to refine c. 200.000 barrels of oil per day. However, 

opposing to the slowdown of Angola’s GDP growth and the industry’s growth decline, the 

current forecasting model expects a CAGR of c. 7% up to the year 2020.

? Operating Costs 

Regarding the operational costs, Sonangol EP 

doesn’t dispose segmented information by 

business units which resulted the importance 

of taking into consideration additional 

assumptions. It was found that, in the 

historical period, the variable costs (cost of sales, cost of supplies and external services, 

provisions and impairment losses and other costs) accounted for approx. 88% of the total 

costs of Sonangol’s expenditures.  

 

Thereby, the operational costs have been estimated based on a percentage of Sonangol’s total 

revenues, assuming an average representation similar to the registered between the 

FY2012/14 (Table XIV).  

? EBITDA Margin  

Despite all the adverse highlighted conditions with oil market prices registered in the last 

quarter of FY2014, Sonangol has managed to present a historical average of 16% growth over 

the last three years. 

For the forecast period, it is awaited that Sonangol achieves a CAGR of approx. 6.9%, which 

is a positive outcome given the actual macroeconomic “panorama” lived in Angola and in the 

Energy Sector. 

6.2.2. Investment in Fixed Assets and Depreciation 

Between FY2013 and FY2014, investment in Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) ranged between 

EUR 5.769bn and EUR 2.958bn. In this period, on average, capex amounted to 15% of 

revenues. 

To estimate the value of capex it was considered the following assumptions: 

Items Assumptions Value 

Cost of Sales % of Sales 18.5%

Selling and Administrative Expenses % of Sales 54.3%

Provisions and Impairment Losses % of Sales 27.0%

Personnel Costs % of Sales 3.60%

29 
 

I. Forecast the value of tangible and intangible net assets using the average rate of the 

last three years, resulting their values as a function of Sonangol’s total turnover. It 

was found a ratio of c. 19% for tangible assets and c. 0.7% for intangible assets.  

It was decided to adopt a more conservative approach, considering until the end of 

the planned period the same growth rate recorded. 

II. Estimate the value of depreciations and amortizations (D&amp;amp;A) using the average rate 

of the last three years, resulting their values depending on the value of Fixed Assets 

in the previous period.  

III. CAPEX was calculated with the following formula: 

[10] CAPEX = (Net Fixed Assetst  – Net Fixed Assets??1) + (Amortizations?  + Depreciations?) 

Table XV - Sonangol's CAPEX Forecast (EUR Million) 

 

6.2.3. Investments in Working Capital  

For the purposes of free cash flow and 

Sonangol’s valuation, the calculation of the 

investments in working capital was based on 

historical data and the company's 

management practices. 

6.2.4 Cost of Equity 

Concluded the analysis of the variables that will impact on estimates of cash flows from 

Sonangol and its financing structure, it is essential to determine the cost of equity. As noted 

in the literature review, methodology, the cost of equity was calculated based on the Capital 

Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), taking into account the following assumptions:

? Risk Free  

As its name implies, a risk-free assets should not be associated with any risk of bankruptcy 

or reinvestment. However, as Sonangol EP is a company that operates in an emerging market, 

additional assumptions must be considered. In many emerging markets, the local currency is 

volatile, both in terms of what it buys of developed market currencies (exchange rates) and 

in its own purchasing power (inflation). In some emerging market economies, the exchange 

rate for foreign currencies is fixed, creating the illusion of stability, but there are significant 

shifts every time the currency is revalued or devalued. 

Therefore, it was decided to convert the currency of analysis from AOA to EUR, using an 

annual exchange rate provided by the Angolan Central Bank. 

 Currently the financial markets consider in a European level that the German Government 

bonds are close to be considered without risk. Thus, it was considered a risk-free rate of 

0.78% according to the yield on German 10-year bonds on Sep 8 of 201511. 

? Beta 

In order to compute the beta of the capital of Sonangol EP it was first estimated the average 

unlevered beta for comparable firms. For Sonangol oil and gas segment, it was used the 

average unlevered beta for integrated oil and gas companies listed globally using the 

argument that oil and gas are commodities that are bought and sold on a world market. For 

the non-core segment it was used the unlevered beta estimated by looking at only emerging 

market comparable firms (including real estate, air transportation, education, telecom and 

healthcare facilities firms), since it is very likely that those companies are far more 

discretionary in emerging markets than in developed markets (and that emerging market firms 

should therefore have higher betas than developed market firms).  

After this, it was used the debt to equity ratio and marginal tax rate for Sonangol to estimate 

the levered beta for the firm. (Appendix 12)

bonds/government-bonds/germany/. Accessed September 8, 2015.

? Market Risk Premium 

Typically, investment banks, consultants and international organizations estimate that in 

countries with mature capital markets as is the case of the US and Germany, the risk premium 

is between 4.5% and 5.5 % (Koller, Goedhart and Wessels, 2005).  

In the case of Angola an emerging market, is expected that 

investors require an additional return for investing in 

domestic companies. Thus, the equity risk premium 

(Damodaran, 2009)12 shall be determined as follows:  

[11]?????? ???? ???????=???? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? 

??????+??????? ???? ??????? 

To calculate the risk premium of Sonangol EP was used the methodology of default risk 

spreads. To this end, the German risk premium (5.81% on an Aaa rating, according to ratings 

agency Moody's) was added the product of a default spread of 300 basis points associated 

with the Moody's rating for Angola (Ba2). Thus, we obtained a total risk premium of 10.31%, 

which is associated with a premium country risk 4.50%.  

? Cost of Equity 

Considering the inputs described above, the cost of equity corresponds to 25.11%, constant 

over definite period and in perpetuity. 

6.2.5 Cost of Debt  

Usually it may be hard to observe a cost of debt for an emerging market company, since these 

companies often do not have publicly traded bonds. Therefore the cost of the debt was 

estimated using a default spread. 

[13] Cost of debt = Risk-free Rate + Default SpreadCountry + Default SpreadCompany

To compute the cost of debt it was estimated the interest coverage ratio using information 

from Sonangol’s financial statements, and a synthetic rating based on the interest coverage 

ratio13. It was added the default spreads based on these rating to the country default spreads 

for Angola to obtain pre-tax cost of debt. The cost of debt for Sonangol is 4.78% (Appendix 

11).

6.2.7 FCFF 

After applying all assumptions, the value of Sonangol E.P. was estimated at EUR 15.566 

billion euros, with EUR 7.151bn corresponding to the continuing value (perpetuity period) 

and 8.416bn to the amount of time horizon (explicit period).

7. VALUATION RESULT 

After the calculation of the Sonangol Enterprise Value through the sum of the present values 

of explicit and perpetual periods, it was estimated the Firm Value of the company. In order 

to compute the Firm Value of the company it was added the value of non-operating assets 

including financial investments, investments in subsidiaries and the amounts in cash and cash 

equivalents. 

Subsequently the company’s Equity Value was obtained by removing from the Firm Value 

the Sonangol’s financial liabilities, particularly with financial debt and provisions. 

Table XX - Sonangol E.P. Valuation Result (EUR Million) 

 

The intrinsic value of each share of Sonangol obtained in the evaluation was €9.23. It is 

important to mention that the value obtained wasn’t precise due to the valuation based in the 

determined economic and sector assumptions. Furthermore, a sensibility analysis will then 

be performed to allow greater certainty estimations with a wide range of values in which the 

given price can take. 

8. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

The company valuation was based on the assumptions which may not verify in the near future. 

Therefore, consequently, the price target obtained may not correspond to the intrinsic value 

of the shares. In this sense it is crucial to assess the level of exposure of the Enterprise Value 

of Sonangol in conjunction to the relevant impact variables in the share price. 

Furthermore, recognizing the current instability in the markets, It has been considered the 

possibility of deviation occurrence from the given assumptions stated in the base scenario.

 In this context a sensitivity analysis was carried to the most significant macroeconomic and 

operational variables in a Ceteris Paribus basis (Appendix 14). In terms of operational 

assumptions, the EBITDA margin is the variable with the greatest impact on the price target 

of Sonangol. A variation of the EBITDA margin of 2 p.p. compared to the base scenario 

represents a positive or negative impact of 31.5% and 30.2% in the price of the Sonangol 

shares. Continuously, the second most sensitive variable is the WACC rate. A 2% variation 

in WACC rate generates a negative impact of 20.9%in the price of the company shares. The 

following table describes the impact on the stock price of Sonangol against a joint variation 

of perpetual growth rate (g) as well as WACC rate. 

Table XXI - Cross Sensitivity Analysis Between WACC and g Rate 

 

The sensitivity analysis solidly confirms the results obtained from the Sonangol’s valuation. 

The relative valuation of Sonangol and its comparable companies (Peer Group) utilizing the 

multiples EV/EBITDA and P/E has permitted to succeed the successful conclusions.

9. CONCLUSION 

The company’s valuation is not an exact science due to being greatly dependent on the set 

assumptions. Against a backdrop of economic/financial instability as well as the current 

volatility of the markets, the uncertainty is greater. To mitigate the constraints, this 

Dissertation seeks to bring together the best practices of business valuation, combining a solid 

theoretical knowledge with the different market perspectives to assess Sonangol E.P. 

valuation.  

Sonangol is a reference company in the O&amp;amp;G sector in Angola, as well as in Africa, being 

actively monitoring the market and historically evidenced a careful management in the face 

of adversity that has felt in recent years. Since Sonangol's strategy is to increase revenues at 

national level by increasing the sales of refined products and at internationally level through 

the increase of exports of oil and dry natural gas, it is expected to sustainable and continued 

growth in the coming years, albeit with strong threats and uncertainties surrounding the 

sector. 

The current drop in oil prices alongside the recent macroeconomic difficulties encountered in 

Angola, presents great challenges in which may arise in the Sonangol’s near future. This may 

lead into reducing and strictly controlling all policies regarding expenses, investments and 

leverage. 

Therefore, despite the inability to determine the value of the company by the STOP method, 

the intrinsic value calculated for Sonangol was €9.23. The sensitivity analysis performed in 

the main valuation assumptions alongside with the market multiples of Sonangol which are 

lower than the average of peers (EV / EBITDA 3.17x) corroborate the evidence that there is 

a possibility of growth, presenting itself as an attractive investment opportunity for investors. 

To conclude, this dissertation can be useful to study and measure a potential Sonangol 

privatization. Therefore, turning into a dispersion of capital, the company can further 

optimize its strategic objectives as well as relieving the pressure on the Angolan state of 

running and funding a very complex company.

Appendix 7 – Sonangol Pnl Summary 

 

 

Appendix 8 – Sonangol E.P. Industry Analysis Using Porters Five Forces Result 

The competitive force in the industry was evaluated by employing Porter’s Five Forces 

Model. Porter’s model measures competitive force through the means of; barriers to entry, 

bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of substitutes, and degree 

of rivalry. These forces are used to measure opportunity with respect to the Integrated Oil and 

Gas environment Sonangol E.P. engages in. 

 

Barriers to Entry: High 

The threat of new businesses emerging within the integrated petroleum industry is quite high 

for several reasons. First of all, Sonangol E.P. is state-owned company, the only 

concessionaire of oil and gas in Angola and the only company in the industry capable of 

bringing the final product to the costumer. In addition start up costs for a new company would 

be astronomical. A new start-up company would have to have the finances or access to 

finances in order to compete with the “supermajors” such as Sonangol, Chevron, BP, Total, 

etc.

The integrated petroleum companies have a competitive advantage concerning; technical 

expertise for exploration and extraction of oil and gas, financial advantage of cash flow to 

operations, and investment-grade credit rankings. Investment grade rankings are necessary 

for financing debt. To conclude,, the integrated petroleum industry is highly capital intensive. 

Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Medium 

Suppliers to vertically integrated industries include services from companies such as 

Schlumberger and Halliburton for technical hardware. Since there is a limited amount of 

suppliers who provide technical equipment and the demand for technical supplies is high, 

means the suppliers wield some leverage regarding technical hardware and support. 

Bargaining Power of Buyers: Low 

Buyers of oil and gas products range from individual users to large corporations and 

governments. With the demand of fuel products extremely high at a current global 

consumption rate of 30 billion barrels of crude annually, and the price of fuel being driven by 

market factors oil industries have little control of demonstrates that customers have little 

bargaining power when it comes to the price of fuel. Until there is a proven fuel substitute, 

customers will continue to pay for the high cost of oil. In addition, as refining costs increase, 

oil companies can to pass these rising costs on to consumers who demand it. 

Threat of Substitutes: Low 

As of yet, there are very few substitutes for oil. Although technology is moving extremely 

fast in the area of renewable energy, no ready replacement for oil has been discovered as of 

yet. Bio-fuel is offering some competition to the traditional means of energy, however, bio-

fuel, so far at the least is no real threat to the oil market or industry. Consequently, there is no 

immediate threat of substitution. 

Degree of Rivalry: Medium 

The vertically integrated oil and gas industry has many competitors which are spread out 

domestically, and internationally implying a high degree of rivalry. The degree of rivalry is 

medium and not high since most of the companies already have a specific market to sell to, 

and really do not have a definitive method to differentiate oil or brand name from competitors, 



 

47 
 

other than brand loyalty and price. Oil companies try to differentiate and market their oil with 

additives, however, these benefits are difficult to quantify by the customer and thus render 

little advantage. Until peak oil is a major concern, the degree of rivalry will be medium. 

Five Forces Summary 

The oil and gas industry is an attractive business opportunity. At this moment in time, and for 

the next decade as the world demands energy via crude oil, the vertically integrated oil 

companies will be able to meet the demand. With the barriers to entry and substitution risk 

remaining high there is little room in the near future for the threat of competition or 

substitution. The vertically integrated oil companies are in the best position to profit in the 

future as oil becomes scarcer. In the future, as oil becomes in short supply, the integrated 

companies will be in the best position to profit. Furthermore, the integrated companies can 

purchase the assets of smaller distressed oil companies as they deplete their reserves, and 

struggle to find new oil. As Sonangol E.P. business model is discussed, it will become clear 

that Sonangol, is in a nice position to gain advantage in relation to their competition.
