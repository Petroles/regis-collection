Abstract

During three consecutive years, monthly samples of zooplankton were taken in the lacustrine (dam) zone of Jurumirim 
(São Paulo, Brazil). The seasonal effect on basic limnological features (thermal regime, oxygen distribution, phyto-
plankton biomass, etc.) was also examined. The influence of the seasonality on the fluctuation of the zooplankton 
composition and abundance was not clearly detected (low degree of recurrent patterns). Rotifers (32 taxa) were the 
most abundant organisms during almost the entire study period with some seasonal alternations in the maximum 
abundance peaks of the main taxa (Conochilus unicornis, Keratella americana, K. cochlearis and Hexarthra spp.), 
except for Polyarthra (mainly P. vulgaris). Only occasionally copepods were numerically dominant. Higher copepod 
abundance was positively associated to periods of increase in the water retention time. Among the Copepoda (10 taxa) 
the calanoids (mainly Notodiaptomus iheringi) were more abundant, especially in warmer periods. Conversely, cyclo-
poids had higher abundance in autumn and winter. The species Thermocyclops minutus and T. decipiens co-occurred, 
but the first attained higher abundance. Some evidence of co-existence strategies between both species are consid-
ered. Cladocera (17 taxa) was never numerically dominant and the main taxa (Bosmina spp., Ceriodaphnia spp. and 
Diaphanosoma spp.) occurred almost the whole study period and did not present a seasonal pattern of fluctuation. 
Diaphanosoma (mainly D. birgei) attained the highest abundance among cladocerans. Most organisms were always 
found at the surface, but they also occupy the whole water column, even in periods of stratified conditions and low 
oxygen concentration in the bottom layers. Among the main zooplanktonic taxa, only Hexarthra avoids deep layers. 
An exceptionally high concentration of Copepoda nauplii on the surface was influenced by low transparency, high 
concentration of phytoplankton at this layer and low oxygen concentration at the bottom. In periods of higher reten-
tion timevariability there was a more heterogeneous distribution of the zooplankton in the water column. The increase 
in the retention time seems also to favor the copepod development. Finally, some inter-decade changes are considered 
on the basis of zooplankton assemblage structure observations.

Keywords: tropical reservoir, fluctuation, Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera.

Flutuações do zooplâncton na represa de Jurumirim  
(São Paulo, Brasil): um estudo de três anos

Resumo

Durante três anos consecutivos, foram feitas amostragens mensais do zooplâncton na zona lacustre (barragem) do 
reservatório de Jurumirim. Os efeitos da sazonalidade nas características limnológicas básicas (regime térmico, dis-
tribuição do oxigênio, biomassa fitoplanctônica, etc.) também foram examinados. Um padrão de flutuação da com-
posição zooplanctônica e da sua abundância não foi claramente detectado (baixo grau de recorrência interanual). Os 
rotíferos foram os organismos mais abundantes durante a maior parte do tempo, com alterações nos picos de abundân-
cia dos principais táxons (Conochilus unicornis, Keratella americana, K. cochlearis e Hexarthra spp.), exceto para 
Polyarthra (principalmente P. vulgaris). Apenas ocasionalmente, os copépodes foram numericamente dominantes, 
estando esse fato relacionado a períodos de aumento no tempo de residência da água. Entre os Copepoda (10 táxons), 
os calanóides (principalmente Notodiaptomus iheringi) foram mais abundantes, especialmente em períodos mais 
quentes. Por outro lado, os ciclopóides foram mais abundantes no outono e no inverno. As espécies Thermocyclops

minutus e T. decipiens coocorreram, mas a primeira alcançou maior abundância. Algumas estratégias de coexistência 
entre ambas as espécies são consideradas. Cladocera (17 táxons) nunca foi dominante numericamente e os principais 
gêneros (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia e Diaphanosoma) ocorreram durante quase todo o período de estudo e não apresen-
taram um padrão sazonal de flutuação. Diaphanosoma birgei foi o táxon mais abundante entre os cladóceros. Embora 
a maioria dos organismos ocupasse toda a coluna d’água, mesmo em períodos de estratificação térmica e baixas con-
centrações de oxigênio no fundo, foram sempre mais abundantes na superfície. Entre os principais táxons zooplanc-
tônicos, apenas Hexarthra evitou camadas profundas. A alta concentração de náuplios de Copepoda na superfície 
foi influenciada pela baixa transparência, alta concentração do fitoplâncton nesta camada e baixa concentração de 
oxigênio no fundo. Nos períodos de maior variabilidade do tempo de retenção, houve uma distribuição mais hetero-
gênea do zooplâncton na coluna d’água. O aumento de tempo de retenção também favorece o desenvolvimento dos 
copépodes. Finalmente, algumas considerações sobre as mudanças entre-décadas são feitas, baseadas em observações 
da estrutura da assembléia zooplanctônica.

1. Introduction

All temporal changes that occur in ecosystems are 
complex and may be responsible for cyclic patterns of 
variation. Different periods of time, such as days or 
years, are reflected in the organism. If the individual 
lifetime is short, in relation to environmental changes, 
oscillations or fluctuations of the population density are 
expected. If individual life is long, or if the considered 
period is too short, the environmental modifications af-
fect only the activities, rhythms and behavior, such as in 
feeding and spatial distribution. This last kind of change 
does not influence the total number of individuals in the 
population (Margalef, 1974).

The continuous replacement of species is one of the 
most remarkable characteristics of the plankton com-
munities, being the theme of several classical studies 
(Hutchinson, 1967; Edmondson and Litt, 1982). The 
period of time along a seasonal cycle determines con-
spicuous modifications in the community structure, and 
a real ecological succession with changes in the species 
composition is expected. Such modifications overlap 
brief fluctuations and rhythms, partly due to great altera-
tions in the environment among the seasons, and also due 
to the briefness of the life of the organisms (Hutchinson, 
1967; Margalef, 1974).

The search for patterns that explain plankton perio-
dicity has been exhaustive, resulting in a huge literature 
and generating theoretical models especially applied 
to the phytoplankton dynamics in temperate regions 
(Reynolds, 1984). In the case of zooplankton, studies 
still do not have a synthesis character, and generally the 
factors that interfere in the temporal dynamics of the 
populations have been analyzed individually.

According to Talling and Lemoalle (1998), despite 
some comprehensive studies in individual sites, more 
generalized approaches focusing on time-variability in 
the tropics are scanty. For zooplankton, these authors 
pointed out that even in environments with a well-de-
fined stratification-mixing cycle (e.g. Lake Titicaca), the 
changes in populations do not seem to be closely related 
to thermal regime, showing much irregularity in pat-
terns.

More recently, new hypotheses have been posited 
to try to explain temporal variation patterns in plankton 
communities, such as the intermediate disturbance hy-
pothesis (Flöder and Sommer, 2000), originally devel-
oped to explain the high diversity of coral reefs and trop-
ical forests (Connell, 1978). Most of these studies are 
related to phytoplankton assemblages (Reynolds, 1993), 
and few are related to zooplankton. Keppeler and Hardy 
(2004) concluded that the structure of tropical zooplank-
ton communities under the influence of intermediate per-
turbations (e.g. water level fluctuation) has a disturbed 
successional development, according to the level of the 
established diversity.

In artificial reservoirs, climatological forces (pre-
cipitation, wind, solar radiation and temperature), and 
other proper mechanisms produced by the system opera-
tion (residence time, water discharge, level fluctuations, 
advection currents), lead to complex hydrodynamic pat-
terns interfering in the spatial distribution and temporal 
sequence of the plankton organisms (Tundisi, 1990). 
The man-induced variations in reservoirs can directly af-
fect zooplankton and some population responses are not 
clearly discriminated from seasonal influence (Geraldes 
and Boavida, 2005). Besides the physical parameters, 
biotic interactions such as fish predation affecting zoo-
plankton fluctuation has also been intensively discussed 
(Urabe, 1990; Soares and Hayashi, 2005).

Recently new approaches have been used in studies 
of the zooplankton of reservoirs in the State of São Paulo 
(southern Brazil), such as the responses to episodic ver-
tical mixing promoted by the impact of subtropical cold 
fronts (Tundisi et al., 2004) and the influence of long 
term degradation processes (biomass versus trophic con-
ditions) (Sendacz et al., 2006).

For certain reservoirs, such as the ones used for wa-
ter supply, the understanding of zooplankton seasonality 
can be an important factor to be considered for quality 
management purposes (García et al., 2002). 

In Jurumirim reservoir, considered in the present 
study, several limnological investigations have been 



Three-year study of zooplankton in reservoir

It has an area of 484 km2, and its maximum and mean 
depths are of 40 and 12.9 m, respectively.

During the study period the less warm months (mini-
mum average air temperature of 10 °C) were August 
1993 and July 1994. The maximum monthly aver-
age temperature (30 °C) occurred in November 1993, 
February and December 1994, and January 1995. The 
mean annual precipitation for the three-year study was 
1,658 mm (Jurumirim reservoir Meteorological Station) 
with the concentration of the rains in summer periods. 
The winter is characterized as the dry period.

Additional limnological and climatological informa-
tion of the reservoir during the study period is provided 
by Henry et al. (2006).

3. Material and Methods

The fieldwork was carried out monthly (morning 
periods) in the lacustrine-dam zone (approximate local 
depth of 30 m) of the Jurumirim reservoir along three 
consecutive years - from July, 1992 to July, 1995. There 
is no vegetation influence in this area, being representa-
tive of a real pelagic condition. For qualitative analyses 
zooplankton samples were collected using vertical net 
hauls, and the quantitative ones through water filtration 
(300 L) by a motor pump at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m, 
since as it is a deep reservoir stratified in spring and sum-
mer, it was expected to observe differences between the 
water layers. For all samples a conical net of 50 µm of 
mesh size was used. Samples were fixed and preserved 
in 4% formaldehyde, and are deposited in the freshwater 
invertebrate collection at the Department of Zoology of 
the State University of São Paulo (campus of Botucatu). 

undertaken over recent years. In terms of temporal dy-
namics, the monthly variation of the thermal regime and 
stability, oxygen deficit (Henry 1992, 1993a) and prima-
ry production by phytoplankton (Henry, 1993b; Henry 
et al., 2006); the influence of hydrological seasonality on 
seston sedimentation and transport (Henry and Maricato, 
1996); the space-temporal variation of phytoplankton 
(Henry et al., 1998), zooplankton (Nogueira, 2001), 
and physical-chemical variables (Nogueira et al., 1999), 
have all been analyzed. Shorter periods of time have also 
been considered for zooplankton studies in Jurumirim: 
short term (weekly) variability in rainy and dry periods 
(Panarelli et al., 2001) and vertical migration in nictem-
eral cycles (Nogueira and Panarelli, 1997). Some inter-
decade information (70’s and 80’s) on the composition 
and abundance of zooplankton has also been provided 
(Sampaio et al., 2002). 

There is no comprehensive theory explaining the 
seasonal changes or successional trends for the zoo-
plankton community in tropical and subtropical environ-
ments. Thus the present work, carried out in Jurumirim 
reservoir, intended to verify the occurrence of recurrent 
temporal patterns (along three consecutive years) for the 
zooplankton assemblages. It aimed to contribute for a 
better understanding of the factors influencing the com-
petitive ability of the different species.

2. Study Area

Jurumirim is the first of a series of eleven reservoirs 
built in the Paranapanema River, since the 50’s, for elec-
tric generation. The dam is located at 23° 12’ 17” S and 
49° 13’ 19” W, in São Paulo State (Brazil) (Figure 1).

4. Results

4.1. Limnological variables

Figure 2 shows monthly fluctuations of the theoreti-
cal water retention time. The minimum value (181 days) 
was recorded for February/93 and the maximum for 
December/93 (576 days). The average theoretical water 
retention time (RT) for Jurumirim reservoir during the 
study period was 258 days. Despite the strong seasonal 
precipitation regime in this region, no clear pattern of 
variation was observed for the water retention time. 
However, relatively low values were estimated every 
summer (February/March, 1993; February/March, 1994; 
January/February, 1995). Higher variability occurred 
over the first period of study (1992 and 1993) but for 
1994, the RT remained very high (above 464 days), ex-
cept for the mid-summer months. After February 1995, 
the values were around 350 days.

Chlorophyll values (water column mean) were gen-
erally low (between 1 and 4 µg.L–1) during the whole 
study period (Figure 2). An increasing tendency was 
observed in autumn/winter, and also in certain summer 
months (December, 1993 and January, 1994). 

Water transparency ranged from 1.37 m (April,1993) 
to 5.16 m (January, 1995) (Figure 3). In general, an in-
creasing transparency was observed in summer periods. 
Nevertheless, a high transparency was also found in June 
and July, 1994.

For the quantitative analysis the zooplankton was count-
ed using sub samples. A minimum of 200 individuals 
was considered in each sample or the total sample was 
analyzed. 

For representation purposes, it was considered the 
abundance in the euphotic zone for the most representa-
tive zooplankton species (abundance and occurrence). 
The graphs illustrating total zooplankton, cladocerans, 
rotifers and copepods considered the six different stud-
ied depths, showing the maximum and minimum densi-
ties, standard deviation and mean values.

In order to identify the influence of the environment 
on the zooplankton dynamics, the following limnological 
variables were analyzed: Secchi disk transparency, water 
temperature (surface and bottom) (Toho Dentam ther-
mistor), chlorophyll-a (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m) (cold 
acetone extraction) and dissolved oxygen analysis (0, 5, 
10, 15, 20 and 25 m) (Winkler method) (Golterman et al., 
1978). The theoretical water retention time (Straškraba 
et al., 1993) was estimated using data of water discharge 
at the dam (monthly mean) and the reservoir volume pro-
vided by the electric company. Data on phytoplankton 
primary production, rain precipitation and other limno-
logical variables were simultaneously obtained and ana-
lyzed (Henry et al., 2006).

Analyses searching for statistical relation among 
the studied variables (e.g. Pearson correlation, PCA and 
CCA) were performed, but did not produce significant 
results in terms of correlation. Anyhow some correla-
tions are mentioned in the discussion.

Three-year study of zooplankton in reservoir

5Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009

Sars, 1886 have also been considered in this study, but its 
taxonomical status has not yet been confirmed (Elmoor-
Loureiro, 1997).

Figure 6 shows that the vertical distribution of the 
zooplankton organisms was more heterogeneous in the 
first period of study until February, 1994. From this 
month on, the distribution became much more homoge-
neous. This figure also shows the monthly fluctuation of 
abundance (mean water column values), which varied 
from 2,180 ind.m–3 (November, 1993) to 132,423 ind.m–3 
(April, 1993).

Considering the relative abundance among the groups 
(Figure 7), Rotifera dominated during most of the study 
period, reaching more than 90% of the organisms (e.g. 
in September, 1992). The only period when Copepoda 
(considering all the development stages) prevailed was 
in autumn (58% of total zooplankton in May, 1994 and 
48% in May, 1995). Cladocera was never numerically 
dominant and their higher proportion was observed in the 
spring, 1994 and early summer, 1995, reaching the maxi-
mum of 25% of the total organisms (January, 1995).

Figures 8 and 9 show the fluctuation of the abun-
dance of Rotifera and Cladocera, respectively. Due to 
their dominance, the rotifers had the same variation pat-
tern seen for total zooplankton, with relatively higher 
values and also more heterogeneous vertical distribution 
in the first study period. Their mean abundance varied 
from 972 ind.m–3 (November, 1993) to 79,660 ind.m–3 
(August, 1992). The abundance of rotifers varied very 
irregularly during almost the whole study period.

The cladocerans did not show a clear pattern of 
temporal fluctuation, but a small decrease of the popu-

Fluctuations of surface and bottom temperature at 
the sampling station showed a tendency to isothermic 
conditions during the autumn/winter and great differ-
ences in the water column during spring/summer peri-
ods (Figure 4). The lowest temperature was observed in 
August, 1994 (16.9 °C - bottom), and the maximum in 
January, 1993 (26.7 °C - surface). The average of water 
temperature at the surface and the bottom was, respec-
tively, 22.3 and 19.9 °C.

A clear seasonal pattern of variation was observed 
for the dissolved oxygen concentrations (Figure 5). 
Lower mean values for the water column occurred in 
summer, with the minimum of 6 mg.L–1 in March, 1993, 
and higher values in winter, with the maximum mean 
value of 9 mg.L–1 in August, 1992 and August, 1994. The 
oxygen range among depths followed the same tempo-
ral pattern with higher amplitude in summer (the highest 
in March, 1993) and lower in the winter (the lowest in 
August,1992).

5. Zooplankton Assemblages

In this study 79 different taxa were identified in the 
zooplankton samples from Jurumirim reservoir (Table 1). 
Higher richness was observed among the rotifers, with 
32 taxa distributed in 25 genera. Cladocera was repre-
sented by 17 taxa (11 genera), Copepoda with 3 species 
of Calanoida (2 genera) and 7 of Cyclopoida (4 genera), 
one genus of Poecilostomatoida and one unidentified 
Harpacticoida. Protozoa, represented by 11 different taxa 
(9 genera), and 7 other zoological groups with episodic 
occurrence, have not been considered in the quantitative 
analysis (Table 1). The taxon C. cornuta cf. intermedia

lations seems to occur in winter/spring (Figure 8). The 
lowest abundance was registered in November, 1993 
(61 ind.m–3). The maximum peaks (water column mean) 
were observed in autumn, 1993 (April) and spring, 1994 
(October) with 7,317 and 6,238 ind.m–3, respectively.

Figure 10 shows the temporal fluctuation of 
Calanoida and Cyclopoida copepods. Higher abundance 
of organisms was observed in winter, and lower in sum-
mer or late spring/summer. A homogeneous vertical dis-

tribution was observed either in winter or summer and 
a higher variation occurred in the autumn/winter, being 
the highest in April, 1993, despite no thermal stratifica-
tion occurring in these periods. For the calanoids there 
was no clear temporal pattern of abundance fluctuation, 
but the highest vertical variability was also observed in 
April, 1993, in the early autumn period.

Considering the mean values for the water column, 
the calanoids were dominant in relation to cyclopoids,

the nauplii represented more than 50% in all months, and 
several times more than 80% of the organisms. A small 
decrease seems to occur in autumn-winter periods. Adults 
remained in low density most of the time, reaching a max-
imum of 20% only once. For Calanoida, there was a lower 

especially in late spring and summer. Conversely, a high-
er proportion of cyclopoid was observed in the winter 
(July, 1992, June, 1993 and July, 1995).

The contribution of nauplii in the relative abundance 
of copepods (Figure 11) is noticeable, but for cyclopoids,

mum abundance in spring 1994, with 128,000 ind.m–3 
(surface). Hexartha spp. showed a maximum density 
in summer, around 60,000 to 70,000 ind.m–3 (February, 
1993 and 1994) and their distribution seems to be nega-
tively affected by depth. Higher abundance of Keratella 
(K. americana Carlin, 1943 and K. cochlearis (Gosse, 
1851)) occurred in the winter (around 70,000 ind.m–3 
August, 1992) and spring (around 50,000 ind.m–3 
October, 1993). A relatively low seasonal fluctuation of 
Polyarthra (mainly P. vulgaris) was observed and maxi-

proportion of nauplii and a higher one of copepodids and 
also a different temporal pattern, with the tendency of 
higher larvae abundance in summer. The maximum pro-
portion of adults (50%) occurred in September, 1993.

The temporal fluctuation of the dominant zooplank-
ton taxa is shown in Figures 12 and 13. Certain alterna-
tion of the maximum abundance peaks among the main 
Rotifera species was observed, especially during periods 
of high abundances (Figure 11a). Conochilus, mainly rep-
resented by C. unicornis Rousselet, 1892, reached maxi-

11Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009

The abundance fluctuation (surface and bottom) 
of the three main genera of Cladocera is shown in 
Figure 12b. Diaphanosoma, mainly represented by 
D. birgei Korineck, 1981, predominated the whole year 
with maximum peaks of abundance (above 5,000 ind.m–3) 
in April, 1993 and January, 1995. Some of the peaks of 

mum values of abundance (around 30,000 ind.m–3) were 
registered in winter (August, 1992) as well as in summer 
(December, 1992). Occasionally, at relatively low rotifer 
densities (winter, 1994 and 1995), there was a coexist-
ence of the main species, showed by intermediate peaks 
in abundance.

Figure 11. Monthly variation of the relative abundance (mean values of the water column) of adults, copepodids and nauplii 
of a) calanoids b) and cyclopoids in Jurumirim Reservoir between July/92 and July/95.

extremely high abundance values on the surface, espe-
cially in colder periods, and in November, 1994, a peak 
in the bottom (2,100 ind.m–3) was also registered.

Cyclopoids were not as abundant as calanoids, and 
the main taxa were: Thermocyclops decipiens (Kiefer, 
1929), T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) and Mesocyclops spp. 
(Figure 13). The genus Mesocyclops was represented by 
M. longisetus (Thiébaud, 1914), M. kieferi (van de Velde, 
1984), and M. meridianus Kiefer, 1926. In previous stud-
ies of the Jurumirim reservoir, the latter had been errone-
ously identified as M. brasilianus Kiefer, 1933 (Henry 
and Nogueira, 1999; Nogueira, 2001). Small abundances 

Ceriodaphnia (C.  cornuta cornuta Sars, 1886, C.  cornuta 
rigaudi Sars, 1886 and C.  silvestrii Daday, 1902), al-
though in smaller abundance, coincided with the ones of 
Diaphanosoma. Bosminidae were represented mostly by 
Bosmina  hagmanni Stingelin, 1904, occurring through-
out the sampling period but always in low abundance 
(&lt;1,500 ind.m–3). The other genus of Bosminidade, 
Bosminopsis deitersi Richard, 1895, rarely  occurred.

The Calanoida main species, Notodiaptomus  iheringi 
Wright, 1935 and Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars, 
1901), generally had alternating peaks of their maximum 
abundance (adult stage) (Figure 13). A. furcatus reached

Three-year study of zooplankton in reservoir

Both species also occupy the whole water column but, 
comparing surface and bottom data of the first 22 studied 
months, it is noticeable that T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) 
remained in high abundance in deeper layers. 

6. Discussion

6.1. General limnological aspects 

Jurumirim is a limnologically well-known reservoir 
(see Henry and Nogueira, 1999 for a synthesis), large and 

of Mesocyclops were observed in summer periods. In 
June, 1995, T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) reached its 
maximum abundance, around 1,620 ind.m–3 (surface). 
Both Thermocyclops species co-occurred during all the 
sampling period, but coincident in major abundance 
peaks were not observed and T.  minutus (Lowndes, 1934) 
reached higher abundance. For T.  decipiens (Kiefer, 
1929), the maximum abundance was registered in late 
summer, early autumn of 1993 (around 600 ind.m–3) and 
for T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) in winter, 1992 (around

spatially complex with distinct longitudinal and lateral 
compartments (Henry and Maricatto, 1996; Henry et al. 
1998; Nogueira et al., 1999). Another important feature 
of the reservoir is the association of its upper zone (70 to 
80 km far from the dam) to a group of adjacent ecosys-
tems (marginal lagoons and riverine mouths), which has 
a great importance in the biogeophysical processes and 
supports a high biological diversity (e.g. Carvalho and 
Silva, 1999; Henry, 2003). 

The lacustrine zone of the reservoir, near to the dam, 
can be classified as oligotrophic (Henry et al., 1998; 
Nogueira et al., 1999) and warm monomictic system 
(Henry, 1993a) with a hypolimnetic oxygen deficit at the 
end of the stratified period (late summer) (Henry, 1992).

The temporal fluctuation of the Jurumirim reservoir 
limnological characteristics is mainly influenced by vari-
ation in the rains and water retention time (Henry et al., 
2006). The variation of the precipitation along the an-
nual cycle is well defined, with rains concentrated in late 
spring and summer. During the study period this seasonal 
pattern was very clear. The water retention time (RT) in 
Jurumirim is high with the annual mean between 400 to 
600 days (Nogueira et al., 2005). However, variation in 
total water discharge and as a consequence in the RT is 
not clearly defined, because it depends on the market de-
mand for electricity and level control of the downstream 
reservoirs.

During the study period the RT varied irregularly, but 
with a certain decrease in the rainy periods (summer). The 
minimum RT that was estimated during the study period, 
181 days, is still long enough to affirm that Jurumirim, at 
least the large region near the dam, is a typical lacustrine 
environment. This condition is quite different from other 
reservoirs in the basin, such as Salto Grande and Canoas 
I and II, where the mean RT is less than 2, 7 and 5 days, 
respectively (Nogueira et al., 2005).

The influence of the seasonal rains on the studied re-
gion of the reservoir is not immediate, due to the perma-
nently high RT. Evidence of this fact is given by the wa-
ter transparency pattern. Higher transparency is observed 
in summer, the period of more intensive rains as said be-
fore. That is because, as shown by Henry and Maricatto 
(1996), the sedimentation of most of the alloctonous ma-
terial brought by rains occurs in the upper zones of the 
reservoir, where a conspicuous decrease in transparency 
(pulse effect) occurs in the rainy period (Nogueira et al., 
1999). The material that remains suspended, mostly fine 
mineral particles, will only be detected in the dam zone 
after a certain time, maybe two or three months depend-
ing on the outflow management.

Most values of chlorophyll (mean for the water 
column) at the dam zone of Jurumirim reservoir were 
around or even lower than 2 µg.L–1. The oligotrophic 
condition of this ecosystem and low availability of pri-
mary trophic resources is certainly an important factor 
interfering in the competitive processes among the zoo-
plankton species.

Oxygen variation followed the well-marked pat-
tern of temperature/circulation of the Reservoir (Henry, 
1993a). The high oxygenation of the water mass in 
winter is related to the increase in the mixture rate be-
tween the surface and the bottom layers, in addition to 
the temperature decrease. The concentration of dissolved 
oxygen only reached low values in the bottom, during 
summer. Another factor that may also be associated to 
the oxygen dynamics is the phytoplankton development, 
as an increasing tendency of the chlorophyll values in 
autumn and winter was observed. A similar pattern was 
detected by Henry et al. (2006) when analyzing phy-
toplankton primary productivity data. The authors dis-
cussed the results in relation to nutrient concentration 
and Z

MIX
 ratios. 

Statistical analysis (Pearson correlation) showed a 
positive correlation between chlorophyll and RT (e.g. 
1994 data), and between transparency and RT. In the 
case of oxygen, there was an inverse tendency with the 
temperature range (amplitude of variation) in the water 
column. However, as the correlation analysis correlation 
scores were very low, the results were not presented. A 
PCA analysis (20 limnological variables) undertaken by 
Henry et al. (2006), for the same sampling period, re-
vealed that the main factors influencing the variability 
among months were nutrient concentrations and the Z

 ratio. 

6.2. Zooplankton composition and seasonal fluctuation

Changes in temperature might act as a trigger of 
seasonal processes, influencing the zooplankton directly 
(e.g. metabolic rates) or indirectly (e.g. modifications of 
the phytoplankton structure). In temperate lakes there is 
a noticeable decrease on zooplankton density in winter 
and increase and appearance of new species in other peri-
ods. However, this pattern is not so clear in tropical lakes 
(Arcifa et al., 1992), where factors such as precipitation 
regime and light penetration can be more important for 
seasonal dynamics (Rái and Hill, 1981). In Lake Paranoá, 
an artificial reservoir in Brasília (DF), it was observed a 
lower zooplankton density in the rainy period, and also an 
alternation on the seasonal occurrence of certain popula-
tions of microcrustaceans, with Thermocyclops decipiens 
(Kiefer, 1929) being more abundant in the rainy season 
and Bosmina longirostris (O. F. Müller, 1785) (Cladocera) 
in the dry period (Pinto-Coelho, 1987).

In Jurumirim, rotifers were the most abundant or-
ganisms of zooplankton during almost the entire stud-
ied period. These small animals react faster than other 
zoological groups of freshwater zooplankton to changes 
in water conditions, due to their short development cy-
cle (r-strategists), being considered as the group with 
more sensibility to the physical and chemical changes 
that occur in the environment (Gannon and Stemberger, 
1978; Infante, 1982). They can also develop numerous 
populations using low quality food resources, such as 
organic detritus (Mangas and Garcia, 1991). The op-
portunistic strategy of rotifers was reported by Nogueira 



Three-year study of zooplankton in reservoir

15Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009

and Matsumura-Tundisi (1996), who studied a seasonal 
cycle in a very different kind of reservoir, a small and 
shallow one (Monjolinho reservoir, São Carlos - SP). 
The authors observed that the succession in plankton as-
semblages was very influenced by physical forces. The 
combination of strong winds, high precipitation and low 
water retention time (late spring and beginning of sum-
mer) results in an absolute dominance of rotifers and fila-
mentous diatoms in the plankton.

As a general rule the rotifers dominate zooplankton 
in Brazilian natural or artificial inland waters (Rocha 
et al., 1995; Nogueira, 2001; Sendacz and Monteiro 
Junior, 2003). But it is important to consider that in terms 
of total zooplankton biomass, they can have only a minor 
contribution (Matsumura-Tundisi et al., 1989).

The main taxa of Rotifera in Jurumirim were 
Conochilus, mainly C. unicornis Rousselet, 1892 in 
spring, Hexartha spp. in summer, Keratella americana 
Carlin, 1943 and K. cochlearis, especially in summer and 
Polyarthra, mainly P. vulgaris Carlin, 1943, in all seasons.

Rotifers were not dominant only during a few months 
of the study period, when copepods were numerically 
more abundant. Higher copepod abundance was associ-
ated to periods of increase in the water retention time, 
as seen between fall and spring of 1994. This could be 
related to the fact that these organisms have longer and 
more complex biological cycle (k-strategists), requiring 
higher environmental physical stability.

The species richness of Copepoda found in the 
present study was similar to that of the mouth of the 
Paranapanema river into the Jurumirim reservoir, includ-
ing two marginal lakes, (3 Calanoida and 6 Cyclopoida 
taxa) (Casanova and Henry, 2004). A compilation of 
different studies shows that Copepoda (Calanoida and 
Cyclopoida of the plankton) in Jurumirim, including the 
downstream stretch, is represented by 12 taxa (Panarelli 
et al., 2003). 

Calanoida was more abundant in Jurumirim, in rela-
tion to Cyclopoida, most of the time. Tundisi et al. (1990) 
studying the eutrophic Barra Bonita Reservoir, detected 
the dominance of Cyclopoida among Copepoda, sug-
gesting that this group is more resistant to the decrease 
in the water quality. 

In our study the abundance of Calanoida was es-
pecially high in late spring and summer. Conversely, a 
higher proportion of Cyclopoida was observed in au-
tumn and winter. 

An analysis of spatial patterns (longitudinal) and 
zooplankton distribution in Jurumirim revealed that 
the proportion of Calanoida increases towards the dam 
(Panarelli et al., 2003), showing that they are better suc-
ceeded in more lacustrine conditions. The authors also 
observed that Calanoida relative abundance, in relation to 
Cyclopoida, was higher in the rainy period. Abundance 
peaks of the large Calanoida Argyrodiaptomus furcatus 
(Sars, 1901) were related to higher temperatures and 
rains in the Lobo Reservoir (SP) (Rocha et al., 1995), 

and to oligotrophic regions in the Furnas Reservoir 
(Corgosinho and Pinto-Coelho, 2006).

A higher abundance of nauplii, in relation to copepo-
dids and adults, was observed for Cyclopoida. In the case 
of Calanoida there was a high proportion of juveniles. 
These facts may indicate the occurrence of a high rate of 
mortality during the cyclopoids larval phases.

According to Rocha et al. (1995) and Silva and 
Matsumura-Tundisi (2005) the trophic state of a lake or res-
ervoir seems to determine what species of Thermocyclops 
will be found. In oligotrophic waters T. minutus (Lowndes, 
1934) is more frequent while in eutrophic waters it is re-
placed by T. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929). In mesotrophic 
lakes both species would be found together or in a sea-
sonally alternating pattern. Pinto-Coelho (1987), studying 
Lake (reservoir) Paranoá (Brasília, DF) had already con-
sidered that T. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929) had a higher capa-
bility to grow in more eutrophic conditions, represented 
in that case by the introduction of allocthonous material 
during the rainy period. 

The co-occurrence of T. minutus (Lowndes, 1934) and 
T. decipiens (Kiefer, 1929), with T. minutus reaching high-
er abundance, could confirm the transitional state between 
oligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic condition of Jurumirim 
as proposed by Nogueira et al. (2002). Coincidence in ma-
jor abundance peaks of these species was not observed, 
indicating a temporal segregation between them. As ob-
served by Panarelli et al. (2001), T. minutus (Lowndes, 
1934) was more abundant in the dry period. 

A spatial segregation, among depths, in the same 
period, was also considered as a strategy of coexistence 
for these species by Nogueira and Panarelli (1997), in a 
study of zooplankton vertical migration in Jurumirim.

It is interesting to note that in the 70’s T.  decipiens 
(Kiefer, 1929) was found to be the most frequent Cyclopoid 
in the reservoirs of Paranapanema (Sampaio et al., 2002).

Cladocera was never numerically dominant and the 
main taxa, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia and Diaphanosoma, 
occurred in almost the whole study period and did not 
present a seasonal pattern of fluctuation. Diaphanosoma 
(mainly D. birgei Korineck, 1981) reached the highest 
abundance.

The composition of Copepoda and Cladocera is 
similar to the ones found in material previously sam-
pled in Jurumirim (Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., 
2002; Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003) indicat-
ing that there was little change in the plankton micro-
crustaceans from the 70’s to 90’s. However, samples 
collected more recently in Jurumirim show that the zoo-
plankton has experienced fast and pronounced modifica-
tions in structure, especially for copepod assemblages. 
The calanoids Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars, 1901) 
and Notodiaptomus conifer (Sars, 1901), two species 
of major importance in the past (Sampaio et al., 2002; 
Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003) nowadays are 
rare (A. furcatus (Sars, 1901)) or seem to have become re-
gionally extinct (N. conifer (Sars, 1901)) (Nogueira et al., 
in prep.). Data of this study as well the one of Nogueira 



Sartori, LP. et al.

16 Braz. J. Biol., 69(1): 1-18, 2009

(2001), show that these species were firstly replaced by 
N. iheringi Wright, 1935 and presently N. c.f. henseni 
Dahl, 1894 is the dominant calanoid (Nogueira et al., in 
preparation). Güntzel (2000) also observed the substitu-
tion of A.  furcatus (Sars, 1901) by N. iheringi Wright, 
1935 in Nova Avanhangava reservoir (Tietê River, São 
Paulo) as a consequence of the eutrophication process in 
the last two decades.

6.3. Zooplankton vertical distribution

Despite the permanently high values, the variabil-
ity of the water retention time in Jurumirim may have 
a certain influence on the zooplankton assemblages. 
Higher variability in the vertical distribution of the total 
zooplankton that occurred during the first 20 months of 
study can be related with higher variability in the water 
retention time in the same period. Nogueira and Panarelli 
(1997) had already observed that the behavior of zoo-
plankton vertical migration toward the surface during the 
night is more distinctive in winter, when RT is higher. 

The seasonal stratification regime of Jurumirim 
reservoir and its effects on the limnological conditions 
seems not to be an imperative factor controlling the ver-
tical distribution of the zooplankton organisms, as most 
species could be found in the bottom layer during all 
seasons.

For copepods, homogeneous distributions in the wa-
ter column were observed even in periods of the year 
with great differences between surface and bottom tem-
peratures (e.g. January-February, 1995 for cyclopoids, 
and February, 1995 for calanoids). The most heterogene-
ous distribution occurred in autumn, April, 1993, espe-
cially due to the nauplii concentrations on the surface 
(about 73,000 ind.m–3 for Cyclopoida and 21,000 ind.m–3 
for Calanoida). In this case a combination of factors cer-
tainly had a strong influence determining this distribu-
tional pattern. The transparency was the lowest one con-
sidering the three year period (less than 1.5 m) and there 
was a high concentration of phytoplankton on the surface 
(6.46 µg.L–1 of chlorophyll). Thus, the animal distribu-
tion on this occasion was possibly associated to the feed-
ing resources distribution. It is also important to consider 
that at this time of the year, the end of thermal strati-
fication period, there was still a relatively low oxygen 
concentration in the bottom layer (less than 5 mg.L–1), 
despite the relatively low difference in the surface-bot-
tom temperature (c.a. 2 °C in 30 m depth). This could be 
an additional factor limiting a deeper distribution of the 
zooplankton organisms. 

Rotifers were more abundant at the surface. However, 
they can occupy the whole water column. Conochilus, for 
instance, had several peaks of abundance in the bottom 
(up to 40,000 ind.m3), which suggests that the conditions 
in the hypolimnion do not limit the distribution of this 
genus, mainly represented by C. unicornis Rousselet, 
1892. Among the main taxa of rotifers in Jurumirim, the 
only one that avoids the bottom layer is Hexarthra.

Cladocera were also found in higher abundance at 
the surface, but the main taxa were always found in the 
bottom as well and, in the case of Diaphanosoma, oc-
casionally in relatively high abundance.

7. Conclusions
Seasonal effects on the limnological features of the 

Jurumirim reservoir (e.g. thermal regime, oxygen distribu-
tion, phytoplankton biomass) were verified by this study. 
However, the influence of seasonality on the fluctuation of 
the zooplankton composition and abundance was not clear. 
Rotifers were the most abundant organisms with certain 
seasonal alternation in the abundance peaks of the main 
taxa (Conochilus unicornis Rousselet, 1892, Keratella 
americana Carlin, 1943, K. cochlearis (Gosse, 1851) and 
Hexarthra spp.), except for Polyarthra (mainly P. vulgaris 
Carlin, 1943). Only occasionally copepods (including all 
developmental stages) were numerically dominant. Higher 
copepod abundance was positively associated to periods 
of increasing water retention time. Among the Copepoda, 
calanoids (mainly N. iheringi Wright, 1935) were more 
abundant, especially in warmer periods. Conversely, cy-
clopoids had higher abundance in autumn and winter. The 
species Thermocyclops minutus (Lowndes, 1934) and T. 
decipiens (Kiefer, 1929) co-occurred, but the first attained 
higher abundance, which indicates the oligo-mesotrophic 
condition of the reservoir. Cladocera was never numeri-
cally dominant and the main taxa (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia 
and Diaphanosoma) occurred during almost the whole 
study period and did not present a seasonal pattern of fluc-
tuation. Diaphanosoma (mainly D. birgei Korineck, 1981) 
attained the highest abundance. Most organisms were al-
ways found at the surface, but they also occupy the whole 
water column, even in periods of stratified conditions – 
low oxygen concentration in the bottom. Among the main 
zooplanktonic taxa, only Hexarthra avoided deeper layers. 
An exceptionally high concentration of Copepoda nauplii 
on the surface was influenced by low transparency, high 
concentration of phytoplankton in this layer and low oxy-
gen concentration at the bottom. Despite the permanently 
high values (more than 180 days), the variability of the 
water retention time (RT) in Jurumirim may have a cer-
tain influence on the zooplankton. In periods of higher RT 
variability, there was a more heterogeneous distribution of 
zooplankton in the water column. The increase in RT also 
seems to favour copepod development.
