ABSTRACT
The effect of unilateral eyestalk ablation on ovarian histology of Farfantepenaeus paulensis after spawn-
ing was evaluated in the present study. Wild females were captured in deep-sea waters of southern Brazil
(27

o 
S) and randomly divided in two groups: unilaterally eyestalk ablated and unablated (intact) females.

A total of six eyestalk ablated and five unablated females were sampled after spawning in separated tanks.
Morphological variables were recorded and ovaries were histologically evaluated according to oocyte
type and diameter. In the ovarian tissue of unablated females, basophilic oocytes (48.8 ± 18.7 µm) were
dominant (99.7 ± 0.6%), with presence significantly lower in the ablated females (93.5 ± 13.8%).
Larger acidophilic oocytes (114.9 ± 16.9 µm), with yolk granules in the cytoplasm, were detected only
in the ovaries of ablated females. The significantly higher occurrence of atretic oocytes (4.8 ± 10.3%) is
another distinguishable feature in the ovaries of ablated females compared with the unablated ones.
The presence of advanced yolky oocytes in ablated females just a few hours after spawning, may indi-
cate the effect of eyestalk ablation on the precocious rematuration of the ovary. The higher number of
atretic oocytes in the ovary of ablated females could be relevant to their reproductive performance, as
they represent a percentage of oocytes that were not released in the spawning process. The present
results of the histology of the ovaries reveal the existence of substantial differences in the cell arrange-
ment of ablated and unablated females after spawning. The results also demonstrate the effects of
unilateral eyestalk ablation in the reproductive cycle of F. paulensis under laboratory conditions.

RESUMO
O presente estudo avalia o efeito da ablação do pedúnculo ocular na histologia gonadal de Farfantepenaeus
paulensis após a desova. Fêmeas selvagens foram capturadas em águas profundas na região sul do Brasil
(27

o 
S), sendo divididas aleatoriamente em dois grupos: com ablação unilateral do pedúnculo ocular e sem

ablação (intactas). Um total de seis fêmeas sem pedúnculo e cinco intactas foram amostradas após suas
desovas individualizadas. Após avaliação dos parâmetros morfológicos, os ovários foram histologicamente
analisados quanto ao tipo e diâmetro dos ovócitos. Nos ovários das fêmeas intactas, os ovócitos basófilos
(48,8 ± 18,7 µm) foram dominantes (99,7 ± 0,6%), sendo sua presença significativamente inferior
(93,5 ± 13,8%) em fêmeas sem pedúnculo. Ovócitos acidófilos de maior tamanho (114,9 ± 16,9 µm),
com citoplasma granuloso, foram observados apenas nos ovários das fêmeas sem pedúnculo. A ocorrência
elevada de ovócitos em atresia (4,8 ± 10,3%) foi outra característica dos ovários das fêmeas sem pedúnculo,
quando comparados aos das fêmeas não-abladas. A presença de ovócitos em desenvolvimento mais avançado
em fêmeas sem pedúnculo, algumas horas após a desova, parece indicar o efeito da ablação do pedúnculo
ocular na maturação precoce dos ovários. A alta incidência de ovócitos atrésicos em fêmeas sem pedúnculo
pode ser relevante para seu desempenho reprodutivo, já que representam uma porcentagem de ovócitos
não liberados no momento da desova. Pode-se concluir que a histologia dos ovários permite revelar
diferenças significativas no arranjo celular de fêmeas sem pedúnculo e intactas. Os resultados demonstram
o efeito da ablação do pedúnculo ocular no desempenho reprodutivo de F. paulensis em laboratório.

Introduction

Unilateral eyestalk ablation is the commonest tech-
nique and the most effective way to induce the ova-
rian maturation and spawning of many species of
penaeid shrimp in captivity (BROWDY, 1992). With
this technique, the endocrine system is directly af-
fected by reducing the inhibitory control over repro-
duction (DALL et al., 1990). Although faster matura-
tion and a decrease in the latency period between
spawnings are commonly observed, conflicting re-
sults have been reported about the effect of the eye-
stalk ablation on spawning quality (BEARD and
WICKINS, 1980; EMMERSON, 1980; BROWDY and
SAMOCHA, 1985; TAN-FERMIN, 1991). Histological
analysis in the ovaries of ablated and unablated fe-
males showed significant differences in the size and
type of oocytes (VOGT; QUINITIO; PASCUAL, 1989; TAN-
FERMIN, 1991) as well as in the frequency of atretic
cells (KELEMEC and SMITH, 1984), which have been
associated with reproductive performance.

Although the ovarian histology of wild
Farfantepenaeus paulensis has been described pre-
viously (WORSMANN et al., 1971; WORSMANN and
SESSO, 1977) and eyestalk ablation has been success-
fully applied in broodstock from various sources
(MARCHIORI and BOFF, 1983; MARCHIORI and CAVALLI,
1993; CAVALLI; SCARDUA; WASIELESKY, 1997; PEIXOTO
et al., 2002), no information on ovarian histology of
eyestalk ablated females is currently available. In the
present study, we evaluated whether unilateral eye-
stalk ablation affects the ovarian histological char-
acteristics and oocyte type in recently spawned
F. paulensis females.

Material and Methods

Female sampling

Wild females of F. paulensis were captured in
deep-sea waters from southern Brazil (27o

 
S) and

maintained in maturation tanks (5,000 L) under stan-
dardized environmental conditions (CAVALLI;
SCARDUA; WASIELESKY, 1997). After one week of ac-

climation, the animals were randomly isolated in two
groups: (1) unablated (intact) females and (2) unilat-
erally ablated females by cutting and cauterizing eye-
stalk. Maturation tanks were daily inspected and any
female with ripe ovaries was transferred to separate
200 L spawning tanks filled with 90 L of sea water.
Only completely spawned females were selected in
the next morning, otherwise they were returned to
the maturation tank. A total of five unablated and
six ablated females were sampled for histological ova-
rian analysis. After the measurements of carapace
length (distance from the postorbital margin to the
mid-dorsal posterior edge of the carapace, CL), body
length (distance between the tip of the rostrum and
tip of the telson, BL).

A comparative study of the ovarian histology of
eyestalk ablated and unablated F. paulensis and body
wet weight (BW), the ovary was dissected and weighted
(OW). The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was calculated
as a percentage of the OW relative to the BW.

Ovarian histology and data analysis

Middle portions of the ovaries (2-3 mm) were
fixed in Davidson solution for 24 h, embedded in
paraffin, sectioned (6 mm) and stained with hema-
toxylin-eosin (BELL and LIGHTNER, 1988). Images of
histological sections (100x) were captured by video
with a camera (CSC-730, color NTSC) connected
to a microscope (Nikon SC). Ten randomly digitized
images from different fields of each ovary were ana-
lyzed using the software ImageTool version 2.0 for
Windows (The University of Texas Health Science
Center in San Antonio, USA).

The oocytes were categorized according to the
histological features described by WORSMANN et al.
(1971). The frequency of each oocyte type and de-
generating oocyte (atresia) was taken as a percent-
age of the total number of oocytes counted in each
field. The largest diameter of 30 oocytes or the total
number available per category was measured in each
image. Only oocytes showing nuclei sectioned ap-
proximately at the equatorial plane were measured.

B. Inst. Pesca, São Paulo, 28(1): 71 - 76, 2002

Student t-test was used to detect differences, in
the analyzed characteristics, between unablated and
ablated females at the 5% significance level. Prior to
the analysis, percentage data (e.g. GSI and frequency
of oocytes) were arcsine transformed, but only origi-
nal values are presented.

Results

There were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) in
CL, BL, BW, OW or GSI between unablated and
ablated females (Table 1). However, histological
analysis of the ovaries revealed significant differences
(P&lt;0.05) in the frequency of oocytes and occurrence
of atresia between the two groups (Table 2).

In the ovarian tissue of unablated females, baso-
philic oocytes (BO) represented nearly 100% of the
cell population (Table 2; Figure 1A). These oocytes
had a nucleus larger than the cytoplasm size and sev-

eral nucleoli dispersed in the interior (Figure 1C).
The cell diameter ranged from 25 to 100 µm with
smaller oocytes lying in the center of the ovarian lobe.
Despite the predominance of BO in the ovaries of
ablated females, their presence was significantly
lower than among unablated spawners (Table 2).

Acidophilic oocytes with yolk granules (YO) in
the cytoplasm were detected in the periphery of the
ovarian lobe of ablated females (Figure 1B), but these
oocytes were not observed in the ovaries of unablated
ones. The nucleoli of the YO are organized on the
periphery of the nucleus. A considerable increase in
cytoplasm is observed, with cell diameter ranging
from 100 to 220 µm (Figure 1C).

The significantly high occurrence of atretic oo-
cytes (AO) in the eyestalk ablated females is another
distinguishable feature in the cell arrangement of the
ovaries of the females of the two groups (Figure 1B).

Discussion

Histological techniques have been widely applied
to describe the ovarian maturation process of sev-
eral penaeids (KI N G, 1948; T A N-F E R M I N  and
PUDADERA, 1989; TAN-FERMIN, 1991; MEDINA et al.,
1996; QUINTERO and GARCIA, 1998), including F.
paulensis (WORSMANN et al., 1971; WORSMANN and
SESSO, 1977). Despite some discrepancies on the
nomenclature of the three basic oocyte types de-
scribed in these studies, their results generally
agree that basophilic oocytes are observed through-
out ovarian development though they are predomi-
nant in the immature and spent (after spawning)

stages. Yolky acidophilic oocytes occur during
intermediary development and acidophilic oo-
cytes with cortical rods are only found in the
pre-spawning stage.

In our study, the presence of advanced yolky oo-
cytes (YO) in the ovaries of ablated females just a
few hours after spawning may indicate a relatively
faster rate of ovarian maturation in these females.
Furthermore, the frequency of BO was comparatively
lower in the ovaries of ablated females, which is prob-
ably the result of the development of a certain num-
ber of BO into YO. In accordance, VOGT; QUINITIO;
PASCUAL (1989) reported that an ablated Penaeus
monodon female exhibited oocytes in all stages of

maturation 2h after spawning, while the unablated
ones contained only immature oocytes. These find-
ings were later confirmed by TAN-FERMIN (1991),
w h o  a l s o  c o n c l u d e d  t h a t  t h e  p r e c o c i o u s
rematuration of the ovary soon after spawning was
a direct result of eyestalk ablation.

The endocrinological processes controlling
gonad maturation in penaeids is not yet fully
understood, but eyestalk ablation presumably
accelerates this process as it reduces the synthesis
and release of the gonadal inhibitory hormone
(GIH) from the neurosecretory complex located
in the eyestalk (DALL et al., 1990; B R O W D Y ,
1992). KULKARNI and NAGABHUSHANAM (1980) found
that during spawning eyestalk unablated
Parapenaeopsis hardwickii females had compara-
tively higher GIH levels which could retard the next
cycle of ovarian maturation. In contrast, the eyestalk
ablated ones were able to start a new maturation cycle
immediately as they had a lower concentration of GIH
in the hemolymph. This hypothesis is in line with the
histological features of ovaries of eyestalk unablated
and ablated F. paulensis observed in the present study.

Atretic oocytes have been reported in various
stages of reabsorption in the ovary of unablated
p e n a e i d s  a f t e r  s p a w n i n g  ( K I N G ,  1 9 4 8 ;
MARTOSUBROTO, 1974; QUINTERO and GARCIA,
1 9 9 8 ) ,  i n c l u d i n g  F.  p a u l e n s i s  s t u d i e d  b y
WORSMANN et al. (1971). The reabsorption of ma-
ture oocytes in the ovary (atresia) could have a
significant effect on the reproductive performance,
as they represent oocytes that were not released in
the spawning process (KING, 1948). Nevertheless,
the effects of eyestalk ablation either on the inci-
dence of atretic oocytes (TAN-FERMIN, 1991;
K E L E M E C  and SM I T H , 1984, VO G T ; Q U I N I T I O ;
PASCUAL, 1989) or on the number of eggs released
(EMMERSON, 1980; BROWDY And SAMOCHA, 1985)
are still conflicting. According to our results, the
higher frequency of atretic oocytes suggests that
eyestalk ablated F. paulensis females may have a
decrease in the number of eggs released per spawn-
ing. However, further studies correlating ovarian

histology and spawning events must be undertaken,
in order to have conclusive results.

 The present results of the histology of the ova-
ries reveal the existence of substantial differences
in the cell arrangement of eyestalk ablated and
unablated females after spawning. The results also
clearly demonstrate the effects of unilateral eyestalk
ablation in the reproductive cycle of F. paulensis
under laboratory conditions. Eyestalk ablation of
F. paulensis females remains necessary in commer-
cial hatcheries, aiming to produce large amounts
of nauplii, due to the faster maturation and
higher spawning frequency (PE I X O T O et al.,
1998). However, it might be advantageous to col-
lect the first spawns of wild females as soon as
they are captured, since this probably maximize
the production cycle of the broodstock.
