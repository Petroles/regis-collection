Introduction

The versatility of polyurethane chemistry
permits the production of a great variety of mate-
rials such as flexible foams, rigid foams, films
and molded devices, among others, depending on
the initial ingredients used in the synthesis [1].
Flexible polyurethane foams are one of the most
important classes of cellular plastic and can be
applied in the fabrication of a wide range of mate-
rials for different uses such as foam mattresses,
pillows, furniture, etc. [2]. 

When adding a filler to a polymer to form
a conjugated biphasic material, the properties of
the final material will be intermediate between
those of the two components. The tension applied
to the polymeric matrix will be transferred in part
to the disperse phase, the filler, since it presents
properties superior to the pure polymer [3].
Efficient reinforcement is achieved by interac-
tions of the constituents of the biphasic material

[4-5] via mechanisms of adhesion, which could
be: adsorption, chemical bonding and mechanical
adhesion. Chemical bonding is the most efficient
form of adhesion and occurs with the application
of coupling agents on the surface of the filler,
which serves as a bridge between the polymer
and the reinforcement. In mechanical adhesion,
the polymer fills in the grooves of the filler; this
adhesion tends to be low unless there is a large
number of recesses on the surface of the filler [6]. 

Several types of materials exist that can be
used as filler.  Among the inorganic materials uti-
lized as filler, notable ones include: calcium car-
bonate, aluminum hydroxide, silica, titanium
dioxide and talc [6]. Some of the organic materi-
als more commonly used are carbon black [7] and
natural fibers [8-9]. 

In flexible polyurethane foams, the fillers
promote an increase in density and resistance to
compression. However, they reduce the resiliency
and contribute to the increase in permanent defor-

Abstract: One filler often utilized in flexible polyurethane foams is calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
because it is non-abrasiveness, non-toxicity and facilitated pigmentation. However, it is observed that
the excess of commercial CaCO3 utilized in industry possibly causing permanent deformations and
damaging the quality of the final product. The effect of different concentrations of commercial CaCO3,
in flexible foams, was studied. Different concentrations of CaCO3 were used for the synthesis of flex-
ible polyurethane foams, which were submitted to morphological and thermal analyses to verify the
alterations provoked by the progressive introduction of this filler.

mation. In addition, properties such as tear strength,
for example, are significantly affected by the intro-
duction of filler [10]. Accordingly, it is necessary to
know the end-use of the material in order to use the
correct concentration in the polymer matrix, obtain-
ing a product of reliable quality. In spite of the
polyurethane industry widely using calcium carbon-
ate as a filler, generally the quantity used is defined
randomly. In the businesses visited in the region of
Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais State - Brazil, no
data was available on the influence of this filler on
the foam, nor was there any methodology to define
the ideal quantity of calcium carbonate that should
be added without causing damage to the mechanical
properties of the final product. 

Thus the proposal of the present work was to
analyze the morphological, mechanical and thermal
behavior when various concentrations of commer-
cial calcium carbonate were introduced into the
polymer matrix using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) microanalysis and thermal analysis.

Experimental

Preparation of flexible foams
For the fabrication of the flexible foams,

the following components were used: polyether
polyol Voranol 4730N (100.00 pph = parts per
hundred parts of polyol) and TDI Voranate T-80
(50.00 pph) purchased from Dow Chemical; the
silicone surfactant PDMS/POE (0.60 pph) from
General Electric; amine Aricat AA 805 purchased
from Arinos (0.16 pph) and stannous dioctoate II
(Liocat 29, Miracema-Nuodex, 0.30 pph) were
used as catalysts in the polymerization and
expansion reactions [11-12]; distilled water (3.00
pph); and commercial calcium carbonate (1, 9,
15, 21 and 30 pph) obtained from the mattress
manufacturing industries in the region of Belo
Horizonte. The stoichiometry of the formulation
used in industry was adjusted for the lab-scale
fabrication of foams. The isocyanate index used
was 132. A Fisatom model 710 shaft stirring
device (power: 25W, rotation: 25-200 rpm) was
used for stirring. 

Polyol and the filler were placed in a dis-
posable plastic receptacle, and the mixture was

stirred until complete homogenization. Next, the
amine, surfactant and water were added. The mix-
ture was submitted to mechanical stirring for 60
seconds.  Shortly after the catalyst was added and
the mixture was stirred again for 30 seconds. After
introducing the isocyanate, the mixture was sub-
mitted to 6 seconds of stirring and then poured into
a cubical cardboard box (7cm x 7cm x 7cm). The
foams were left to cure for seven days.

Flexible foams analyses
For the instrumental analyses, the follow-

ing instruments were used: SEM – Jeol JSM-840;
microanalysis (EDS) – Jeol-8900 electron probe
microanalyzer; thermogravimetric analysis (TG)
– Netzsch STA 409EP.

SEM — The samples were cut into little
pieces (0.5cmx0.5cmx0.5cm) using scissors.
Next they were covered with a fine layer of gold
to permit observation in SEM since the samples
were not conductors. The samples were analyzed
under magnifications of 50, 150 and 500x. 

EDS — The samples of calcium carbonate
were covered with a thin layer of carbon and ana-
lyzed under with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV
and a current of 20 nA. 

TG — alumina crucible; dynamic atmos-
phere of air; 100 mL.min-1 gas flow; heating rate
of 10ºC min-1; heating range of 25-950ºC. The
sample masses were approximately 12 mg. 

Results and discussion

Morphological analysis  of commercial calcium
carbonate

When a filler is introduced into a poly-
meric material, the ideal is that it has regular gran-
ulometry and that its particles are sufficiently
small to enable good distribution in the matrix [7].
Figure 1 presents the image obtained in the scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) of commercial
calcium carbonate at a magnification of 500x. 

In the image obtained, it was observed that
the calcium carbonate presented irregular, hetero-
geneous and coarse granulometry. The calcium
carbonate, used in the present work, showed a
large polydispersion in granulometric analysis
with sieves of defined particle sizes. The particle

size varied between 200 and 250 mesh. This filler
is used in the mattress industry without any pre-
treatment because it is a residue generated in the
fabrication of lime and sold to the manufacturers
at reduced prices. The calcium carbonate was also
submitted to a qualitative X-ray energy dispersive
spectrum (EDS, Figure 2), where it was possible
to detect the various elements of its constitution. It
is worth noting that to improve the foam quality,
granulometry aside, the ideal is to utilize a chemi-
cally pure material that does not contain sub-
stances that could react with the matrix, leading to
the degradation of the material.

Morphological analysis  of flexible foams
Figure 3 presents the image (SEM) of the

flexible foams containing calcium carbonate and
its transversal section. 

It is observed that the calcium carbonate
added is agglomerated in some points in the poly-
mer matrix and not evenly distributed homoge-
neously, as is required to promote an efficient rein-
forcement [5,13]. This result was expected since
the filler utilized presented polydispersion in gran-
ulometry. A low interaction of the filler used and

the polymeric matrix was further verified by
microscopy, which probably contributed to the
deformations observed further (Figure 4). The use
of excessive quantities of filler causes enrichment,
it also is responsible for damage to the matrix [14],
causing the foam to lose its characteristic polyhe-
dral morphology. The arrows show the worsening
morphology as higher concentrations are added.

Thermal analysis
According to the TG curves, the

polyurethane presents typical decomposition in
two stages between 200 and 600oC, generating a
final residue of 1.73%. The commercial calcium
carbonate decomposes between 600 and 800oC,
losing CO2 and generating CaO with a final residue
of ~62.68%. This high value of the residue means
that the commercial calcium carbonate, probably,
contains inert compounds like CaO, SiO2, Al2O3,
etc, compatible with the EDS analysis.

The flexible foams containing commer-
cial calcium carbonate as a filler were also sub-
mitted to thermal analysis. Figure 5 presents the
TG curves of the foams with carbonate in vary-
ing concentrations and also the TG curve of the
foam without calcium carbonate. 

By means of the residues obtained in the
TG curves it was verified that the filler is not
homogenously distributed throughout the foam
since the residue percentage obtained did not cor-
respond to the concentration of carbonate added in
the sample preparation. This observation agrees
with the verifications done in the morphological
analysis of foams with calcium carbonate.
Nevertheless a shift in decomposition temperature
of the flexible foams to lower values was seen

with an increase in calcium carbonate concentra-
tion. The foams with carbonate present three
stages of decomposition, two of which are attrib-
uted to the loss of organic material and the third
step is attributed to the decomposition of calcium
carbonate. Figures 6a, b and c display a linear
dependency of the quantity of mass lost in the 1st,
2nd and 3rd stages of decomposition of the com-
posites on the concentration of filler (CaCO3).

The quantities of mass lost in the 1st and 2nd

stages diminished with an increase in the concen-
tration of CaCO3. As the concentration of filler did
not greatly influence the decomposition of
polyurethane, a directly proportional relation
between the mass lost and the concentration of filler
was expected. The analysis of pure polyurethane
showed that 97.8% of its mass was lost in the first
two stages of decomposition (Table 1).  

Using an approximation of the rule of
mixing and substituting the volumetric fraction
for the mass fraction [5, 15-16] yields:

carbonate.

CP = MP x MMF + RP x RMF (1)  

where:
CP is the property of the composite;
MP is the property of the matrix;
MMF is the mass fraction of the matrix in the
composite;
RP is the property of reinforcement; and 
RMF is the mass fraction of the reinforcement in
the composite.

It is emphasized that the mass fraction was
utilized preferentially because the mass losses and
release of heat are more directly related to the
quantities of mass utilized in the analyses than their

respective volumes. Since there was no mass loss
of the filler because these stages occurred at tem-
peratures below its decomposition temperature,
one can consider this loss to be zero, and using
equation (1) yields: CP1% = 97.84 x 0.99 = 96.86%
for foam with 1% filler.  Substituting the other con-
centrations, one obtains the mass losses in these
two stages for the foams with different concentra-
tions of commercial calcium carbonate (Table 1).

30 68.48 72.39

‡The quantity of calcium carbonate is expressed in
g per 100 parts polyol.

The values calculated for the mass loss in
the first stage of decomposition considered the
hypothesis of having only weak interactions
between the filler and the matrix, proportional to
the mechanical adhesion. On comparing the exper-
imental and calculated values, it can be observed
that the proximity of the experimental values to the
calculated ones confirms the initial hypothesis. The
decomposition of the filler was the primary event
in the third stage (Figure 6c). Thus the first term of
the equation was considered null. Table 2 presents
the calculated and observed mass losses in the third
stage for all of the flexible foams with varying con-
centrations of calcium carbonate.

The difference generated between the cal-
culated and observed values in the third stage are
due to the dispersion of the filler in the polymer.
For performing the calculations with Equation 1,
the concentrations of calcium carbonate that
must be aggregated in the polymer matrix were
considered. However, as observed previously in
the morphological and thermogravimetric analy-
ses, the filler did not disperse well in the matrix
but formed agglomerates, which influenced the
results obtained in Table 2.

Conclusions

The calcium carbonate did not disperse well
in the matrix since it has variation in particle size
and presents interactions that tend to form agglom-
erates, making it so that there is not a distribution
of force between the carbonate and the matrix dur-
ing the utilization of the flexible foam.

espumas flexíveis de poliuretano contendo carbonato de cálcio comercial.

Resumo: Uma das cargas mais utilizadas na fabricação de espumas flexíveis de poliuretano é o car-
bonato de cálcio (CaCO3) por ser não abrasivo, não tóxico e de fácil pigmentação. Contudo, é obser-
vado que o excesso de CaCO3 comercial usado nas indústrias causa deformações permanentes, o que
prejudica a qualidade do produto final. No presente trabalho é proposto o estudo do efeito da concen-
tração de CaCO3 comercial na fabricação de espumas flexíveis de poliuretano. Foram utilizadas difer-
entes concentrações de CaCO3 na síntese das espumas, as quais foram submetidas à análises térmica e
morfológica, afim de verificar as alterações provocadas pela introdução progressiva da carga.

Although the flexible polyurethane foam
factories use calcium carbonate as a filler, the intro-
duction of high quantities of this compound corrob-
orates with the increase in hysteresis values, leading
to a loss in quality. Nevertheless, an increase in the
dimensional stability was observed with an increase
in calcium carbonate concentration. 

The thermal stability of flexible polyure-
thane foams is altered with an increase in calcium
carbonate concentration; this fact is related to the
reduction of polyurethane in the flexible foam.
