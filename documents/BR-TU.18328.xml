Abstract 

Electroactive polymer composites are interesting materials for advance technological 

applications due to the possibility to combine the electroactive properties of the polymer 

matrix with a large variety of fillers that allow tailored responses for specific 

applications. 

The best all-around electroactive polymers are poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its 

copolymers which allied with the properties of porous zeolite materials, with tailored 

shape, size and Si/Al ratio, among others, leads to the possibility of development of 

promising PVDF/zeolite composites. 

In this way, a study of the structural, thermal and electrical properties of PVDF 

composites prepared with different framework zeolite types (LTL, LTA, FAU and 

MFI), different polymer solvents (DMF, DMSO, TEP) and different zeolite (NaY) 

concentrations (4, 16, 24 and 32 wt %) was performed. 

Further, the dielectric response, electrical conductivity and electric modulus of the 

composites were investigated as a function of NaYzeolite content. The zeolite influence 

on the electroactive ?-phase crystallization of PVDF was explored, as well as the effect 

of clay layered structure (Montmorillonite, Kaolinite and Laponite) on the electroactive 

?-phase nucleation and on the optical transparency of the composite. 

It was found that the obtained composites showed an electrical response dependence on 

the pore structure and chemical content of the inorganic host. The dielectric response of 

the composites is directly related to the Si/Al ratio, leading zeolites with lower Si/Al 

ratios to larger dielectric responses and encapsulation efficiencies in the composites. It 

was also found that the zeolite content strongly influences the macroscopic response of 

dielectric response, which increases for increasing filler content. The dielectric constant 

at room temperature reaches values larger than 1000 for the 32 wt.% composite at 1 kHz 

what is mainly attributed to restricted ion mobility and interfacial polarization effects 

due to the zeolite inclusion, leading also to high dielectric losses. For the higher zeolite 

concentrations the composite d.c. electrical conductivity is characterized by two 

conducting regimes separated by a concentration independent breaking voltage of 4 V, 

which is associated to an intrazeolite charge transport.

Dielectric relaxation studies show that the main relaxation process (?-relaxation) of the 

amorphous phase of the polymer matrix is not affected by the presence of the zeolite 

and, in a similar way, the zeolite low temperature relaxation is not significantly affected 

by the polymer phase. On the other hand, the electric modulus formalism reveals 

significant contributions of the fillers to the electrical permittivity and conductivity of 

the composites. The presence of the zeolite particles increases a.c. conductivity and the 

Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars contribution that is predominant at low frequencies with 

respect to the ohmic contribution to permittivity. 

The ability of zeolites to induce the eletroactive ?-phase nucleation of PVDF is directly 

dependent on the Si/Al ratio and zeolite content; however it only occurs when the 

composite is melted at temperatures below 200 ºC. The complete ?-phase crystallization 

of the polymer crystalline phase occurs for a filler content of 16 wt% of LTA or FAU 

zeolite structure. 

The even higher surface interaction of clays when exfoliated leads to the same 

phenomenon with an amount of 0.50 % of Montmorillonite clay content. The 

electroactivity of the material has been proven by measuring the piezoelectric d33 

response of the material, which presents a value of ?7 pC/N, lower than for ?-PVDF 

obtained by mechanical stretching but still among the largest coefficients obtained for 

polymers. Further, the optical transmittance in the visible range is strongly enhanced 

with respect to the transmittance of the pure polymer. 

The development, characterization and physical-chemical understanding of these 

PVDF/zeolite and PVDF/clay composites resulted in suitable materials for applications 

in diverse areas including battery separator membranes and biomedical applications.

Resumo 

Os compósitos poliméricos electroativos são materiais muito interessantes para 

aplicações tecnológicas devido à possibilidade de combinar as propriedades 

electroativas da matriz polimérica com uma larga variedade de materiais que deste 

modo permitem a manipulação das suas respostas para as fazer adequadas a aplicações 

específicas. 

De entre os poucos polímeros electroativos, as melhores respostas são obtidas no 

poli(fluoreto de vinilideno) (PVDF) e nos seus copolímeros que, aliados às propriedades 

dos materiais porosos de zeólitos, com forma, tamanho e razão Si/Al modificáveis, entre 

outras características, leva à possibilidade de desenvolver compósitos promissores de 

PVDF/zeólitos. 

Deste modo, foi efetuado um estudo das propriedades estruturais, térmicas e elétricas 

dos compósitos de PVDF preparados com diferentes tipos de zeólitos (LTL, LTA, FAU 

e MFI), diferentes solventes do polímero (DMF, DMSO, TEP) e diferentes 

concentrações de zeólito (NaY) (4, 16, 24 e 32 % em peso). 

Foi ainda investigada a resposta dielétrica, condutividade eléctrica e modulo elétrico dos 

compósitos em função da concentração do zeólito NaY. A influência do zeólito na 

cristalização da fase electroativa ? do PVDF foi explorada, bem como o efeito da 

estrutura lamelar das argilas (Montmorillonite, Kaolinite e Laponite) na nucleação da 

fase-? e na transparência ótica do compósito. 

Descobriu-se que os compósitos obtidos exibiam uma resposta elétrica dependente da 

estrutura porosa e da composição química dos compostos inorgânicos encapsulados. A 

resposta dielétrica dos compósitos está diretamente relacionada com a razão Si/Al, 

levando a que os zeólitos com uma baixa razão Si/Al apresentem elevadas respostas 

dielétricas e maior eficiência de encapsulamento no compósito. Foi também descoberto 

que o teor de zeólito influencia fortemente a resposta dielétrica macroscópica, 

aumentando com a concentração de zeólitos no compósito. A constante dielétrica à 

temperatura ambiente atinge valores superiores a 1000 para o compósito com 32 % em 

peso de NaY a 1kHz, o que é atribuído principalmente à mobilidade iónica restrita e a 

efeitos de polarização interfacial devido à inclusão de zeólito, levando também a 

grandes perdas dielétricas. Para concentrações de zeólito elevada, a condutividade 



viii Ana Catarina Lopes 

elétrica d.c. do compósito é caracterizada por dois regimes de condutividade separados 

por um potencial de disrupção de 4 V, independente da concentração, que está 

associado ao transporte de carga intrazeólito. 

Estudos de relaxação dielétrica mostram que o processo de relaxação ? da fase amorfa 

da matriz polimérica não é afetada pela presença do zeólito e, de um modo semelhante, 

a relaxação de baixa temperatura do zeólito não é afetada significativamente pela 

presença da fase polimérica. Por outro lado, o formalismo do modulo elétrico revela 

contributos relevantes das inclusões para a permitividade elétrica e condutividade dos 

compósitos. A presença das partículas de zeólito aumenta a condutividade a.c. e a 

contribuição Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars que predomina a baixas frequências 

relativamente à contribuição ohmica para a permitividade. 

A capacidade dos zeólitos induzirem a nucleação da fase eletroativa ? do PVDF 

depende diretamente da razão Si/Al e da quantidade de zeólito; contudo, apenas se 

verifica quando o compósito é fundido a temperaturas inferiores a 200 ºC. A 

cristalização completa em fase ? pode ocorrer para uma concentração de 16% das 

estruturas de zeólito LTA ou FAU. 

A ainda maior superfície de interacção das argilas, quando exfoliadas, resulta no mesmo 

fenómeno com uma concentração de 0.5% de argila Montmorillonite. A eletroatividade 

do material foi comprovada através da medição da resposta piezoelétrica d33 do 

material, que apresenta um valor de –7 pC/N, mais baixo do que o de ?-PVDF obtido 

por estiramento mecânico mas ainda entre os maiores coeficientes piezoelétricos obtidos 

para polímeros. Mais ainda, a transmitância ótica na gama visível é fortemente 

melhorada relativamente à transmitância do polímero puro. 

O desenvolvimento, caracterização e compreensão físico-química destes compósitos 

PVDF/zeólito e PVDF/argila resultou em materiais adequados para aplicações em áreas 

diversas que incluem membranas para baterias e aplicações biomédicas.

1.1. Electroactive polymers 

Electroactive polymers are one of the most interesting classes of polymers used as smart 

materials. Its ability to respond to an electrical stimulation with large displacement 

makes them appropriate for the use in an increasing number of applications including 

sensors, actuators, energy harvesting and as biomaterials in the biomedical field, among 

others [1, 2] Piezo, pyro and ferroelectricity are three of its more important properties. 

Piezoelectricity consists on the variation of the polarization of the material when 

mechanically stressed or on the development of a mechanical strain when an electric 

field is applied. Pyroelectricity consists on the variation of the polarization of the 

material as a response to a variation of temperature. Finally ferroelectricity corresponds 

to the characteristic of the material of having stable polarization that can be hysterically 

switched by an electric field [3].  

Although the piezoelectric and pyroelectric coefficients of polymers are generally lower 

than those of ceramic and single crystals, polymer and polymer based composites have 

advantages for specific applications related to their low permittivity, low thermal 

conductivity, softness and flexibility, good impedance matching to air and water and 

relatively low cost.  

Among the few polymers presenting piezo, pyro or ferroelectricity, such as Nylon–11 

[4], PLLA [5] and PLGA [6], Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers 

have the best all-around electroactive properties, being therefore the polymer of choice 

for an increasing number of applications [7, 8]. 

 

 

1.2. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) 

This semi-crystalline polymer shows a complex structure and can present five distinct 

crystalline phases related to different chain conformations designed as all trans (TTT) 

planar zigzag for the ?-phase, TGTG´ (trans-gauche-trans-gauche) for the ? and ? 

phases and T3GT3G´ for ? and ? phases [7]. Figure 1.1 shows the chain conformation of 

the most investigated phases of PVDF used for applications: ?, ? and ?-phases. 

 



Chapter 1

Figure 1.1 Schematic representation of the chain conformation for the ?, ? and ? phases of PVDF. 

 

Many of the interesting properties of PVDF, in particular those related with its use as 

sensor or actuator, are related to the strong electrical dipole moment of the PVDF 

monomer unit (5-8x10
-30

 C?m) which is due to the electronegativity of fluorine atoms as 

compared to those of hydrogen and carbon atoms [9-10]. In this way, each chain 

possesses a dipole moment perpendicular to the polymer chain. The monomer units and 

therefore the dipolar moments are then packed in a morphology which can show an 

overall dipolar contribution per unit cell as in the polar ?, ? and ? phases. The ?-phase is 

the one with the highest dipolar moment per unit cell (8x10
-30
C?m) when compared to 

the ? and ? phases [11]. The ? and ? phases are non-polar due to antiparallel packing of 

the dipoles within the unit cell [12]. Since the ? and ? phases are the most electrically 

active phases, their promotion within the material is an on-going pursuit [13] due to the 

strong interest in application areas such as sensors, actuators, batteries, filters, chemical 

warfare protection, magnetoelectric, and, more recently, in the biomedical field [14-17]. 

The ?-phase is the most easily and commonly obtained by melt and crystallization at 

room temperature. It presentssuitable mechanical properties and chemical degradation 

resistance [7].  

The ?-phase is the one that presents the best piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric 

properties[7] and is most commonly obtained by mechanical stretching of the ?-phase 

[9], or from solution crystallization at temperatures below 70 
o
C [17], however, in this 



Introduction 

 Ana Catarina Lopes 5 

case,it presents very fragile mechanical properties. PVDF ?-phase can also be 

obtainedfrom melt under specific conditions such as high pressure [18], external electric 

field [16] and  ultra-fast cooling [19]; or by the addition of nucleating fillers such as 

BaTiO3 [20], clay [21], hydrated ionic salt [22], PMMA [23], TiO2 [24] or nanoparticles 

such as ferrite [24], palladium [25] or gold [26]. Also the development of PVDF 

copolymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE), Figure 

1.2., has allowed to obtain the material in the electroactive phase [27], once the addition 

of the third fluoride in the TrFE monomer unit with a large steric hindrance, favors the 

all-trans conformation and induces the ferroelectric ?-phase independently of the used 

processing method: melt or solution casting. This situation occurs when the VDF 

content is between 50 and 80 % [28], corresponding also to the ferroelectric behavior of 

the copolymer. 

 

 

Figure 1.2 Schematic representation of the P(VDF-TrFE) 

 

The ?-phase is also piezoelectric but this effect is weaker when compared to ?-phase 

PVDF due the presence of a gauche bond every fourth repeat  C-C units [29]. 

Similarly to what happens with the ?-phase, the ?-phase of PVDF is difficult to obtain 

excepting through melt crystallization at high temperatures and at very slow cooling 

rates, with an ? or ? to ? solid state phase transformation by annealing at temperatures 

close to melt temperature [30] or with the addition of fillers [29].

1.3. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites 

Despite the interesting electroactive and mechanical properties of PVDF, ideal for the 

demands of novel technological applications that includes flexible, simple fabricated 

and easy shaped smart materials, this polymer still present a much low piezoelectric 

response when compared with materials such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and 

barium BaTiO3 [31]. In order to bring added value and to improve its performance, the 

combination of PVDF polymer with suitable fillers has been pursued. 

For improving the electroactive response of PVDF, materials displaying high 

piezoelectricity and ferroelectric properties have been incorporated in the polymer. 

Simultaneously, the combination of the polymer matrix with the filler, either due to the 

high dielectric constant of the filler or by surface effects and matrix-filler interactions 

leads to the increase of dielectric properties that, in turn, improves the energy density of 

the composite when compared to the neat polymer. When compared to the conventional 

dielectric materials, such as ceramics and single crystals, polymer composites present 

high mechanical flexibility and ability to be molded on the desired shapes [32].  

PZT, a ceramic with high piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant and low 

dielectric and mechanical loses was added to PVDF polymer and the results shows a 

composite with an increase of almost 10 times in the dielectric constant when compared 

with the pure polymer [33]. Results obtained with the introduction of other ceramics 

such as BaTiO3 as well as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) point in the same 

direction [34, 35]. Further, BaTiO3 can stimulate the nucleation of the electroactive 

phase of PVDF, reaching ?-phase fractions up to 82% [20]. However, despite the 

increase of dielectric constant, the ceramic loading deteriorates the mechanical qualities 

of the composite and prevents its use in many technological applications.  

Metal nanoparticles have been also introduced in the polymer matrix. The metal 

introduction causes an increase of the dielectric constant due the interfacial polarization 

phenomena due to collective oscillation of nanoparticles electrons called surface 

plasmon resonances (SPR). This effect is detected even for small loadings of 

nanoparticles by an increase of many orders of magnitude of the optical absorption 

spectra of the materials, that in turn is dependent on polymer and nanoparticle types, as 

well as nanoparticles size, shape, distribution and orientation [36, 37]. In this way, the 

introduction of Ag nanoparticles in PVDF lead to an increase of the dielectric constant 



Introduction 

 Ana Catarina Lopes 7 

from 7 up to 26 with a particle loading of only 0.020 wt% [38] and up to 120 with a 

particle loading of 20 vol % [39]. Despite Ag being the metal nanoparticle with the 

most intensive resonance absorption in the visible region due to the favourable 

frequency dependence of the dielectric constant [40], other metals exhibit similar 

behaviour. Silver nanoparticles also play an important role in the nucleation of the 

electroactive phase of PVDF. The electrostatic interactions between the negative surface 

charges of the Ag nanoparticles and the dipolar groups of the polymer chains leads to 

the direct formation of the electroactive PVDF ?-phase from solvent casting and melt 

crystallization. The efficiency of this crystallization is dependent from the particle size 

and concentration and elimination of processing steps such as mechanical stretching or 

annealing makes these composites ideal for applications in flexible electronics and 

microfabrication [41]. Other particles present similar effect on the PVDF electroactive 

phase cristallization. This is the case of magnetoelectric ferrite nanoparticles, such as 

COFe2O4, NiFe2O4 and NiZnFe2O4 [42]. Also in these cases it is shown that the static 

electric interaction between the negative zeta potential of the magnetic particles and the 

dipole moments of the polymer chain is the responsible for the electroactive phase 

nucleation [43]. Furthermore, these composites present magnetoelectric effect that 

allows applications in the area of sensors and actuators [44]. 

Carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) have also been added 

to PVDF and used for mechanical reinforcement and increasing the electrical 

conductivity. The studies show that permittivity, electrical conductivity and thermal 

conductivity increases with increasing of carbon and MWNT content and that this filler 

also acts as a nucleation agent that induces the enhancing ?-phase crystals formation in 

PVDF [45]. 

Among the large variety of materials used as fillers for PVDF are also found the 

alluminosilicates. They have been traditionally used to increase the mechanical 

performance and thermal stability of polymers [46, 47], but nowadays, the incorporation 

of aluminosilicates leads to new application areas due to their tailoring properties: high 

surface area, ion exchange capacity, different shape and size and the capacity of 

molecule encapsulation in the 3D structure.They result from the combination of oxygen 

with silicon and aluminium originating a wide range of chains, rings, layers and three-

dimentional arrays. Thus, despite all aluminosilicates share the same basic chemical 

composition, the different arrangement of atoms and molecules leads to structures with 



Chapter 1

also different physical properties. Nowadays, natural or synthetic, there exist a large 

number of different aluminosilicates among which stand out clays, zeolites and 

mesoporous aluminosilicates due to their several applications. 

 

 

1.4. Aluminosilicates 

 

1.4.1. Layered aluminosilicates 

Clays are layered aluminosilicated formed by the arrangement of two different sheets: 

one consists on tetrahedral SiO4 units, where each Si atom shares one of its O atoms 

with a second sheet which in turn consists on aluminiun in octahedral co-ordination 

represented as AlO6. There are two different sheets structures. The 1:1 structure consists 

on an octahedral sheet, that is held to other sheet by hydrogen bonding that holds the 

sheets tightly together, fact that stops the insertion of water molecules or ions between 

the sheets and hinders the expansion of the material when it is wet [48] (Figure 1.3 a). 

On the other hand, on the 2:1 structure, one AlO6 octahedral sheet is sandwiched 

between two AlO4 tetrahedral sheets by covalent bonding. This layer structure can 

present an expanding (Figure 1.3 b) or non-expanding lattice (Figure 1.3 c). In some 

clay, there is a considerable substitution of aluminum by silicon that can go up to 15 %. 

Further, magnesium and iron can also substitute aluminum in the octahedral sheet. 

These substitutions create an overall negative charge on the layers that is balanced by 

water molecules and ions such as K
+
, Ca

2+
 and Mg

2+
, providing the layered 

aluminosilicates of  ion exchange capacity [48, 49]. Water and ions hold layers together 

by relatively weak forces, allowing the water and other polar molecules to enter 

between the unit layers what, in turn, causes the expansion of the lattice [50]. On the 

other hand, in some clays the interlayer cation is potassium, which size, charge and 

coordination number allows it to fit snugly in the hexagonal rings of oxygens of the two 

adjacent silica tetrahedral sheets. This fact results in a strong interlocking ionic bond, 

keeping the layers together and precluding water molecules to occupy the interlayer 

position[49].

The use of clays is transversal to many areas. It can be used as a geopolymer material in 

the production of geopolymer brick due its significant impact on the strength of the 

material [51] as well as in cosmetic treatments as a therapeutic option for facial 

rejuvenation [52]. Clays have been extensively used in the area of drilling muds [53] 

and foundry muds as well as for paper coating with the aim to control paper surface 

morphology, optical and physical properties as well as printing properties [54]. The use 

of clays has also been extensive in the area of catalysis, playing a central role in the 

processing of crude oil in the mid-twentieth century [55] and later on catalytic cracking 

of heavy oil [56]. Nowadays, clays are being used as catalysts in the green synthesis of 

chemicals and also for the removal of pollutants. This large interest for catalysis 

application arises because clays present inherent features in composition and structures 

that results in large surface areas, swelling, ion exchange and active broken-edge bonds. 

Furthermore, besides the characteristics of their framework, clays can be modified 

according to the intended application. The ions within the interlayer space can be 

exchanged with active components for catalysis purposes [57], functional nanoparticles 

can be incorpored into or onto clay structures [58] and clays can be used as a catalysis 

supports [59]. For catalysis applications also synthetic clays can be used since their 

formulations and structure can be designed and controlled depending on and the  

preparation conditions [60].

1.4.2. Three-dimensional aluminosilicates 

Different fromthe clay layered structure, zeolites consist on three-dimensional 

framework structures (Figure 1.4) formed by the combination of TO4 tetrahedra (T = Si, 

Al) linked to each other by sharing all the oxygen atoms, forming uniform and 

molecular-sized pores and channels. In a silica structure all T of the TO4 tetrahedra 

corresponds to Si atoms and the solid is uncharged. However, when a silicon atom is 

replaced by an aluminum atom, the electronic relationship between (SiO2)2 and 

[AlSiO4]
- 
leads the framework to become negatively charged and requires the balance of 

an extra-framework cations within the structure to ensure overall framework neutrality 

[61]. This variation from a pure-silica zeolite to a low-silica zeolite transforms an 

hydrophobic, acid stable and no ion exchange capacity material into an hydrophilic, acid 

soluble and high ion exchange capacity one [62]. 

 

Figure 1.4 Different zeolite type structures [63] 

 

Zeolites and their well-organized system of pores and cavities, with a very high surface 

area and pore volume, are an ideal matrix for hosting nanosized particles and small 

molecules. However, this is dependent on the pore diameter of the zeolite largest 

channel entrance, which in turn is dependent on the smallest number of O or T atoms 

that limits it [64]. In this way, conventionally, channel sizesare classified in ultra large, 

large, medium or small pore material when they are formed by &gt;12, 12, 10 or 8 member 

rings, respectively, resulting in diameter variations between 5 and 20    [64]. 



Introduction 

 Ana Catarina Lopes 11 

Present everyday on household detergents with the aim of reducing water hardness by 

partial removal of calcium and magnesium ions [65], zeolites are increasingly used 

mainly due to their suitable characteristics for gas storage and separation and catalysis. 

The characteristics of zeolites makes them interesting for the area of gas storage since 

the high pressures and liquefaction processes can be avoided, allowing easier 

transportation and storage [66]. This situation includes the storage of hydrogen [67] as 

well as the absorption of CO2, CH4, N2O and N2 [68]. The absorbance capacity of gases 

is related to the zeolite structure modifications and the chemical nature of ions present 

in the zeolite structure. Ion-exchange allows controlling the diameter of the cages and 

channels by the modification of valence state and the size of the exchangeable cations, 

which in turn controls the available void space and the accessibility of molecules to the 

internal cavity [67]. The absorption capacity of zeolites is also a function of the physical 

properties of the gases, which includes their polarizability, the dipole moments and 

quadrupole moments as well as the specific adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. These 

different interaction allows not only the control of accumulation and storage of gases in 

the zeolites but also their separation [69].  

 In this sense, the separation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) produced 

during the anaerobic treatment of biomassa and natural gas is required and many studies 

with different zeolites have already focused on this fact [70]. 

 

1.4.3. Other aluminossilicate structures 

Despite the interesting properties of zeolites, the presence of micropores in their 

structure imposes intracrystalline diffusion limitations, that includes the obstruction to 

the use of bulky molecules on catalytic reactions and the reduction of process rates [71]. 

To solve this problem, mesoporous aluminosilicates have attracted much attention in 

relation with macromolecules [72]. These materials with a mesoporous structure show a 

relatively low acidity, hydrothermal stability and ion exchange capacity, limiting their 

use in catalytic reactions. These facts can be attributed to the amorphous nature of the 

pore wall present in most mesoporous aluminosilicates, since the preparation conditions 

required to generate mesoporosity do not generally favor the formation of a crystalline 

aluminosilicate framework [61]. However, some recent studies shows that it is possible 



Chapter 1 

12 Ana Catarina Lopes 

to achieve crystalline mesoporous aluminosilicates allowing the combination of the 

advantages of zeolites and mesoporous materials [72]. 

Other possibilities include hierarchiral zeolites (Figure1.5), consisting on materials with 

multiple levels of porosity, that combine the microporosity and acidity of zeolites with 

the easier accessibility of mesoporous materials [71]. They can be prepared by direct 

synthesis when secondary templates are added [73], inducing mesoporosity, or by post-

synthesis treatment, that result on a partial destruction of the crystals [74].  

 

Figure 1.5 Schematic illustration of zeolite and a hierarchically nanoporous zeolite 

 

Diverse studies demonstrated an improved of catalysis performance associated with the 

enhanced of mass transport obtained with hierarchical porous materials such as ZSM-5 

[75, 76] and hierarchical porous materials obtained from FAU, LTA [77]and MFI [78] 

type zeolites, among others. Finally, “two-dimentional zeolites” area also being 

developed, consisting on zeolite materials composed by layers with one-two unit cell (2-

3 nm) thickness [79, 80]. The first 2D zeolite was MCM-22 [81], but since there other 

layered zeolites were obtained, such as FER [82], SOD [83] and MFI [84]. An example 

of layered arrangement on a “two-dimensional zeolite” structure is illustrated in Figure 

1.6. Large pore zeolites with more than12 rings, ideal for large molecules catalyses that 

were limited to its one-dimensional system, can now improve significantly its 

performance if synthesized on the 2D structure.  



Introduction 

 Ana Catarina Lopes 13 

 

Figure 1.6 Example illustration of layer arrangement on a “two-dimensional zeolites” [85] 

 

On this kind of zeolites the absorption and catalyses occurs mainly on the materials 

surface and not in their pores. They exhibit a much large surface area when compared to 

mesoporous materials and their large and well organized external surface of thermally 

stable zeolitic crystals makes acid centres accessible to large molecules that, 

simultaneously, will be sterically limited by the channel entrances of conventional 

zeolites [80, 86]. 

 

 

1.5. Polymer/aluminosilicate composites 

As previously mentioned, there are several physical and structural features of 

aluminosilicates such as their excellent chemical and thermal stability that can be 

exploited for the production of composites. 

The area of polymer/aluminosilicates composites has been growing since the first 

polymer composite was created on Toyota Central Research laboratories with the 

production of a nylon 6/clay composite with enhanced physical properties 

comparatively to the pure polymer, what includes the increase of tensile strength, 

modulus and heat distortion temperature without loss of impact strength [87]. Since 

there many different polymers and clays have been investigated, being determined that 

the clays exfoliation is crucial for the improvement of the physical properties of the 

composites. Exfoliation, in turn, depends on the way in which composites are prepared, 

by situ polarization or by melt compounding, and from the kind of clays pretreatment, 

organically or no organically modified clays [50, 88], that is performed with the aim to 

compatibilize the hydrophilic surface of the clay with the hydrophobic polymer matrix 



Chapter 1

[89]. A graphical representation of the possible structures of polymer/clay composites is 

represented in Figure 1.7. 

 

 

Figure 1.7 Scheme of possible structure of polymer clay composite. 

 

Exfoliation leads to a high contact between the two phases of the composite, resulting 

on the improvement of materials barrier properties since the permeating molecules have 

to wiggle around the impermeable particles introduced in the polymer, increasing the 

resistance to the gas molecules penetration. Barrier properties increase was tested in a 

wide range of polymers including epoxies [90], siloxanes [91], polyureas [92] and PVA 

[93]. Thermal stability and flame resistance of polymers also increase in polymer/clay 

composites. In these cases, clay acts as a barrier for mass transport of volatile products 

released during the degradation process. The addition of a small amount of clay is 

enough to induce a significant decrease in the peak heat release rate, as well as in the 

mass loss rate during combustion [50, 94]. In this way, polymer/clay compositesare 

very useful in a variety of industrial applications from automotive [95, 96], construction 

[97] and aerospace [98] to food packaging [99] and textiles [100]. 

Polymer/aluminosilicate composites have extended their application range to other 

areas, including sensors, biomedical and membrane areas.  

Aluminosilicates have been used to improve the performance of polymer sensors, as 

well as being used themselves as the sensing medium [101]. Their absorptivity, high-

surface area, presence of mobile ions, catalytic activity and porosity make them 

attractive candidates for numerous applications as chemical sensors [102]. Many

examples can be found for pollutants in drinking water or toxic [103] and flammable 

gases [104], however, despite the large body of research literature on 

polymer/aluminosilicate environmental sensors, few practical, commercial systems  

have emerged to date, being  selectivity the primary limitation [104]. 

Polymer/aluminosilicate based sensors can also be useful as biosensors for the 

measurement of toxins in agricultural commodities, human food and animal feed 

thereby helping on avoiding toxic and carcinogenic effects on human and animal health. 

Polymer/aluminosilicate biosensors can additionally detect important bioparameters 

such as urea and glucose in humans [105]. In this area of biomedical applications, there 

is growing interest in zeolites, for their use in drug delivery [106], as carriers of low 

molecular bioactive substances and macromolecules for in-cell chemistry [107], as MRI 

contrast agents [108], hemostatic materials [109], cell culture [110], osteo-regeneration 

[111]and most recently as a vehicle to store and release Nitric oxide, a molecule that has 

long been established as a signalling material to promote the relaxation of smooth 

muscle cells [112].  

Polymer based aluminosilicates composites can also bring an added value in the area of 

cell culture and tissue engineering [113]. These materials consist in an innovative 

approach in regenerative medicine due to their biocompatibility and cation exchange 

ability. In addition to that, these composites can be transparent, flexible and elastic. 

They can be prepared into various shapes, such as thin films, rods, spheres and hollow 

tubes and are being used in many in vivo or in vitro applications [113-114]. Relatively 

to 3D aluminosilicate structures, although it is well known that zeolites have interesting 

effects on bone structure such as its ability to stimulate bone formation and inhibition of 

bone loss [115] is easily observable in the literature the lack of studies regarding the 

exploitation of these properties of zeolites in polymer composites, which could take 

advantage of the unique features of biocompatible polymers [116]. 

Finally, polymer/aluminosilicates composites have also been used in the development of 

membranes. Polymer and polymer composite separator electrolytes membranes have 

attracted considerable attention in recent years due the specific characteristic of 

polymers such as electronic insulation, minimal electrolyte (ionic) resistance, 

compatibility with electrodes, mechanical and dimensional stability, among others, that 

are being improved with the introduction of specific aluminosilicates [117].

There are many studies on conventional membranes for the separation of gases, ions, 

solutes or water, nevertheless such membranes have micro voids or free volumes of 

broad size originating a lower perm-selective nature. This problem can be solved with 

the use of ordered polymers [118]. The performance of the membrane can be further 

improved by the addition of aluminosilicates that will benefit the mechanical and 

structural properties of the resulting composites [119]. Additionally zeolites can 

enhanced the membrane selectivity by increasing transport of solvent molecules and 

excluding sterically the larger solutes [120].This controls the transfer by the polymeric 

membrane combined with the catalytic properties of zeolite, making possible to obtain 

polymer catalytic membrane reactors [121], and to combine two distinct functions 

(reaction and separation). Due to its crystalline nature, aluminosilicates with their 

excellent hydrothermal stability and chemical resistance to withstand the conditions of a 

reaction environment can substantially improve the features of the pure polymeric 

catalytic membrane reactors [122].

1.6. Objectives 

Once enumerated the interesting characteristics and application potential of 

polymer/aluminosilicate composites, the main objective of this work is the development 

of new polymer composites suitable for advanced applications in areas such as sensor 

and actuators and energy storage. These composites will be produced and the origin of 

the effects investigated. In particular, the main scientific objectives of the project will 

be: 

1. Develop new composites based on electroactive polymers with different porous 

structures of zeolites and clays. 

2. Get a deeper knowledge of the physical origin of the dielectric, mechanical, 

thermal and electromechanical properties of the composites. 

3. Obtain a relationship between the structural and microscopic properties of the 

materials, processing conditions and their macroscopic response. 

4. Determine the applicability of these new materials. 

 

Also relevant objective of the project is to produce and create know-how in materials 

with large technological impact with the possibility of rapid technology transfer. In this 

way, the implementation of these materials into old products with improved properties 

or the development of new products will be possible.

1.7. Structure and methodology 

The present work is divided intoeight chapters that intend to provide a comprehensive 

and logic report of the progress achieved during this investigation.Sixof these chapters 

are based on published scientific papers on the development of composites of PVDF 

with different porous structures of three dimensional(zeolites) and two 

dimensional(clays) aluminosilicates. 

In Chapter 1 it is presented the state of the art on PVDF polymer, aluminosilicates and 

their composites. 

The next three chapters, report on the influence of several parameters on the 

morphology of the composites, their electrical, therma, optical and mechanical 

properties, as well as in the polymer electroactive ?-phase crystallization. The studied 

parameters include the three dimensional aluminosilicate(zeolite) shape, size and Si/Al 

rate, by the use of zeolite framework types LTL, LTA, FAU and MFI (Chapter 2), the 

polymer solvent (Chapter 3) and the NaY zeolite content (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 

complete this investigation with a deep study of the electrical response of PVDF/NaY 

composites. 

Chapter 6 reports on the study of PVDF composites with a two dimensional layered 

structure (clays), what results in a higher surface contact area between the filler and the 

polymer. Electrical, optical and the crystallization process were investigated, mainly 

focused on PVDF/Montmorillonite clay composites. 

Chapter 7 summarizes some results on on-going PVDF/aluminosilicates composites 

application developments. Finally, Chapter 8 presents the overall conclusions and the 

suggestions for the future work.

Influence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  

29 Ana Catarina Lopes 

 

2.1. Introdution 

The combination of polymers with a large variety of fillers has been used to tailor the  

macroscopic response of materials towards specific goals for applications [1, 2]. 

Poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, has been widely used for advanced technological 

applications due to its pyro- and piezoelectric properties [3], that makes it suitable for 

sensors and actuators, among others [4]. Among the different fillers that can be 

incorporated into PVDF in order to tailor mechanical, thermal and electrical response of 

the material, are the zeolites, particles with a a rigid three-dimensional framework of 

tetrahedral       
   and       

   primary building units, forming channels and cavities 

with sizes in the range of molecular dimensions. Zeolites can entrap molecules allowing 

their diffusion, adsorption and reaction within the channel system [5]. In addition to 

well defined pores of precise and uniform size, zeolite structures generally show an 

excess of negative charge that is compensated by cations which exist within the cages 

and channels.  These characteristics have lead zeolites to be used in applications such as 

catalytic cracking [6], drug delivery systems [7], membranes [8], gas sensors [9], host-

guest antenna material [10], etc. 

With respect to the investigation on PVDF/zeolite composites, it has been mainly 

focused on the development of filtration or ionic conductivity membranes for fuel cell 

applications [11]. However, it has been shown that the presence of NaY zeolite with a 

faujasite structure on the PVDF matrix gives origin to many others yet unexplored 

possibilities. For example, the presence of NaY in the polymer matrix induces the 

crystallization of the polymer in one of its electroactive phases [12], avoiding additional 

processing steps as stretching or application of high electric fields in order to obtain the 

electroactive phase and allowing therefore miniaturization and incorporation into 

microelectronic systems. Further, it was also shown that the inclusion of zeolite fillers 

also modifies the electrical behaviour of the composite [13, 14]. The dielectric constant 

increases with respect to the pure polymer, fact that is dependent on the number of 

cations in the zeolite structure as well as from the molecules encapsulated in the zeolite 

cavities [13] as well as on the zeolite content [14]. In addition, the overall electrical 

conductivity of the composites is also increased due to intrazeolite charge transport [12, 

14]. Due to these developments and the large application potential of PVDF/zeolite 

composites, it is necessary to investigate the effect of different zeolites structures with 



Chapter 2

varying Si/Al ratio, cavity size and shape in order to evaluate the main zeolite 

parameters influencing composite macroscopic response. In the present work, zeolites 

Y, L, A and ZSM-5 were synthesized and used for the production of PVDF composites 

in order to better understand the effect of different zeolite structures on the electrical 

response and thermal stability of the composites, as well as their influence in the 

nucleation of the electroactive phase of PVDF. In this way, this research is relevant as, 

together with a fundamental knowledge on these PVDF/zeolite systems, will allow to 

better tailor materials properties for specific applications. 

 

2.2. Experimental 

Zeolite Y was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of Na2SiO3 (Aldrich) and 0.1 g of Al(O-i-

Pr)3 (Aldrich) in 20 g of distilled water. The crystallization was carried out at 95 
o
C for 

24 h. Zeolite A was prepared as follows: 0.5 g of Al (Aldrich) was dissolved in alkaline 

solution of 1 g NaOH and 10 g of distilled water. Subsequently, 1g of SiO2 dissolved in 

a solution of 1g of NaOH and 10g of distilled water was added. The obtained gel was 

homogenized and heated at 90 
o
C for 24 h. The initial batch for the synthesis of zeolite 

L was prepared by dissolving 1.5 g of Al2(SO4)2 (Aldrich) in a solution of 3.61 g of 

KOH and 35 g of distilled water and adding 9.05 g of SiO2 (Ludox) and 15.5 g distilled 

water. The resulted gel was homogenized for 24 h and the synthesis was carried out at 

180 
o
C for 72 h.. Nanosized ZSM-5 was prepared by mixing under vigorous stirring of 

8.5 g TPAOH (Aldrich, 1M in H2O), 5 g TEOS (Aldrich) and 5.18 g distilled water. The 

synthesis was carried out at 114 
o
C for 144 h. Micron-sized silicalite-1 was prepared 

following the above mentioned procedure but the amount of the water was increased to 

8 g and the synthesis was performed at 150 
o
C for 120 h. All syntheses were carried out 

under static conditions in Teflon-lined stain steel autoclaves. After fast cooling with 

flowing H2O, the samples were filtered and washed with distilled water and dried.  

The structural characteristics, dimensions and Si/Al ratios of the prepared zeolites are 

presented in Table 2.1.

The synthesized zeolites were used for the production of PVDF/zeolite composite films 

with an average thickness of 50 ?m. The composite films were prepared from a 4 mL 

N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution with 1,0 g of PVDF power (Solef 1010) and a 

suspension of zeolites for a final zeolite concentration within the composite of 16% 

weight. For obtain a homogeneous mixture, this suspension was placed in an ultrasound 

bath for 4 h and then PVDF powder (Solef 1010 from Solvay, Belgium) was added and 

dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer. Finally, the composites were melted at 

190ºC and recrystallized at room temperature. 

With respect to the zeolite and composites characterization, the general structure of the 

PVDF/zeolite composites was observed by powder X-ray diffraction (data not shown).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the crystalline fraction of 

the polymer within the composites and its melting characteristics. It was performed in 

samples of ~6 mg in a Mettler Toledo DSC 823 apparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere 

at a heating rate of 10 ? 0.2 ºC.min

. 

The thermal degradation of the composite films was studied by thermogravimetric 

analyses (TGA) performed in ~ 4.0± 0.1 mg samples with a STD Q600 DETA 

instrument. A high purity nitrogen (99.99% minimum purity) atmosphere with a flow 

rate of 20 mL/min was used. During the experiments, the samples were subjected to a 

heating rate of 10 ± 0.2 °C/min between 25 and 800 ºC. 

The capacity and tan ?, dielectric loss, of the samples were measured with an automatic 

Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter at room temperature in a home-built sample 

holder. A signal of 1 V was applied for frequencies in the range between 100 Hz to 1 

MHz. Circular Au electrodes of 2,5 ± 0.1  mm radius were coated by magnetron 

sputtering on both sides of each sample. From the obtained data and and the geometry 

of the sample, the real, ?’, and imaginary, ?”, parts of the dielectric function as well as 

the a.c. conductivity were obtained.

2.3. Results and Discussion 

 

2.3.1. Microstructural Features 

SEM images of the synthesized zeolite particles are shown in Figure 2.1 (a-d) where the 

different geometries and sizes are observed. The main characteristic of the zeolites are 

summarized in Table 2.1. The zeolite with the most specific geometry is the L zeolite: 

whereas all other zeolites show a three dimensional structure, the L zeolite present 

crystals with a parallel one-dimensional channel system [15]. 

The surface SEM images of the different polymer/zeolite composites are represented in 

Figures 2.1 (e-h). Similarly to the neat PVDF, the composites show a spherulitic 

microstructure, however its size and shape vary with the different zeolites. The 

spherulites of Y, ZSM-5 and A composites are well defined, being the spherulites of Y 

composites smaller when compared with those of A composite. On the other hand, the 

composites obtained from L do not show a well defined spherulite structure.

PVDF/Y, PVDF/A, PVDF/L and PVDF/ZSM-5 composites 

 

The spherulite size reflects the crystallization kinetics of the polymer from the melt, the 

spherulite size being determined both by the nucleation ability of the fillers and by the 

growth rate of the spherulites. Zeolites Y and L acted as the most effective nucleation 

agents increasing the number of nucleation points, resulting therefore in smaller

spherulites due to limited space for non-perturbed growth [16, 17]. On the other hand 

the zeolites A and the ZSM-5 gave origin to composites with big and well defined 

spherulites close to the ones obtained for PVDF [18] (Figure 2.1). The average surface 

area of the used zeolites increases in the following order: LTL &gt; MFI &gt; LTA &gt; FAU 

[19, 20]. In this context, the zeolites with the lowest and highest surface area acted as 

the most effective nucleation agents and no direct relationship between surface area and 

nucleation efficiency is obtained. On the other hand, zeolite L is the only sample that 

has 1D porous system and K
+
 charge compensation cations and zeolites L and Y are 

also the ones with  12-ring openings which can contribute to the more facile cation 

movement and possible interaction with the polymer. Furthermore, the pore system of 

zeolite L is composed of straight channels and the one of zeolite Y is built of cages that 

can also influence the mobility of the charge compensation cations. An important factor 

influencing nucleation is the Si/Al ratio, as for the zeolites L, A and  Y with Si/Al 

rations between 1 and 3 show that higher Si content contributes to smaller spherulites. 

Nevertheless, the sample ZSM-5 built only by SiO4 tetrahedra and therefore with no 

compensating cations showed the lowest influence in PVDF crystallization kinetics. In 

this way, it can be concluded that large pores with narrow distribution together with the 

nature of the charge compensation cations favor higher nucleation efficiency and 

therefore smaller spherulites. 

 

2.3.2. Polymer phase quantification 

The presence of fillers within the PVDF matrix can serve as crystallization directors to 

promote the crystallization of specific phases of the polymer [21-23]. The crystallization 

of PVDF in an electroactive phase in the presence of layered aluminosilicates has been 

reported [21, 23]. In a similar way. it was also demonstrated that the three-dimensional 

aluminosilicate NaY also induces the crystallization of the ?-phase of PVDF [12]. FTIR 

measurements were performed on the prepared composites in order to evaluate the 

crystalline phase of the polymer (Figure 2.2 (a)) as specific vibration bands allow to 

identify the presence of the crystalline ?-phase of PVDF (bands at 764, 796, 1149 and 

1383 cm
-1

) and the crystalline ? and/or ?-phases of PVDF (bands at 510, 512, 833, 838, 

840, 883 and 884 cm
-1

). In the last case, there is a superposition of some bands due to 

the close chain conformation for both crystalline phases of the polymer and careful 

attention is required for the quantification of the phases [24]. In order to distinguish 



Influence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  

35 Ana Catarina Lopes 

among the electroactive ? and ? phases only not overlapping bands have to be used, 

such as the bands at 445, 467 and 1275 cm
-1

 which are just characteristic of the ?-phase, 

and the ones at 431, 812 and 1234 cm
-1

 which are characteristic bands of the ?-phase 

[24]. 

The relative ? or ? phase content can be calculated applying equation 2.1, following the 

method described in [25-27] and assuming that the crystalline phase of the polymer is 

either in the ? or ? phase, with no or small traces of ? phase:

value of K? is 0.365 and the value of K? is 0.150 µm
-1 

[24]. The polymer phase contents 

for the different composites are shown in Table 2.2.  

Figure 2.2 (a) and Table 2.2 show that the composites prepared with Y and A zeolites 

crystallize completely in the electroactive ?-phase for this zeolite concentration: all the 

bands characteristic of the ?-phase, 764, 796, 1149 and 1383 cm
-1

, disappear and the 

characteristic bands of the ?-phase, 812 and 1234 cm
-1

, are present. On the other hand, 

the nucleation efficiency of the electroactive phase of the ZSM-5 zeolite is strongly 

reduced with respect to the Y and A zeolites and  the L zeolite crystallizes in the non-

polar ?-phase typical of PVDF when crystallized under similar conditions [25]. These 

results show that the existence of aluminum atoms and, as a consequence, the existence 

of negative charges on the zeolite surface is important for the nucleation of the 

electroactive phase. The presence of negative surface charges in the fillers has been 

proposed as the main mechanism responsible for the nucleation of the electroactive 

phase of the polymer [21, 28] and it is also confirmed for the zeolite structures. It is to 

notice that the lower surface interaction between L zeolite and PVDF matrix due to its 

one-dimensional structure prevents the nucleation on the ?-phase since polymer contact 

with the charged surfaces within the zeolite only occur at the ends of the L zeolite 

particles. The existence of O-H bonds at the acid sites allows partial crystallization of 

the polymer in the ?-phase when the ZSM-5 zeolite is present, but the absence of cations

on its structure is responsible for the lower efficiency of this zeolite in  the 

crystallization of the electroactive phase.

Figure 2.2 FTIR-ATR spectra (a) and DSC thermograms (b) of ?-PVDF and the different PVDF/zeolite 

composites. 

 

The XRD patterns can be correlated with FTIR-ATR spectra and confirm the previous 

results: the zeolites ZSM-5 and L with a reduced or no electroactive phase nucleation 

effect on the polymer  show generally lower diffraction intensity when compared with 

the zeolites Y and A that favored the ?-phase formation (data not shown).  

As previously indicated, the introduction of the zeolite fillers modify both the 

crystallization kinetics, as observed by the variations in the spherulite size, and the 

crystalline phase of the polymer. It is interesting in this context then to evaluate whether 

there is also an influence in the degree of crystallinity, and this fact will further strongly 

influence the electromenchanical and electrical response of the materials. Figure 2.2 (b) 

shows the DSC scans for neat PVDF as well as for the PVDF/zeolite composites.  

Comparing with neat ?-PVDF, the A and Y zeolite composites show a shift on the 

melting temperature to higher temperatures associated to the higher thermal stability  of 

the ?-phase present on these composites [18]. On the other hand, the ZSM-5 and L 

zeolite composites show a wider melting peak with some lower temperature features 

with respect to the main peak due to ill crystallized parts of the polymer related to the 

presence of the weaker interacting zeolites and to the presence of both phases in the 

case of the ZSM-5 zeolite. In both cases the main melting peak corresponds to to ?-

phase polymer.

J/g, is the melting enthalpy for a 100% crystalline sample of pure PVDF [3, 24]. 

It is shown that the presence of zeolites does not change significantly the degree of 

crystallinity of PVDF. The Y zeolite is the one that has a large effect on the reduction of 

the degree of crystallinity of the polymer associated to the larger nucleation effect that 

affects crystallization kinetics in a way that results in a larger number of simultaneously 

smaller spherulites which can lead to defective structures and lower crystallinity [16, 

17].

2.3.3. Thermal stability and interfacial interactions 

The influence of zeolites on the modification of the crystallization phase of the polymer 

indicates strong polymer-zeolite interactions. Further, the zeolite ability for molecule 

encapsulation in its chanels and cavities can also affect the composite electrical 

behavior. In this way, thermogravimetric analyses are relevant to further study these 

issues. Figure 2.3 shows the weight loss of pristine ?-PVDF and the different 

composites measured at 10ºC/min. The weight loss of the composites films as a function 

of temperature can be divided into two main steps. The most significant loss occurs at 



Chapter 2 

38 Ana Catarina Lopes 

temperatures between 400 and 500 ºC and it is associated to the polymer degradation, a 

well described process characterized by carbon-hydrogen bond scission [29]. The onset 

temperature of this degradation process shows a slight increase in the composites, 

indicating that the presence of zeolites provides a stabilization of the polymer. 

The mass loss at lower temperatures, between 0 and 400ºC (Figure 2.3, inset) is 

detected only in the composites films, indicating a relationship with the presence of the 

zeolite fillers. This loss is related to the release of water and solvent molecules from the 

zeolite cavities [30] and shows larger values for the composites prepared with Y and A 

zeolite, followed by the ones prepared with L and ZSM-5. 

The framework aluminum ratio is directly related to the adsorption capacity of water in 

the zeolites cavities. The water vapor physically adsorbs on the tetrahedrally 

coordinated aluminum and its associated cations as           bonds are nearly 

homopolar and hydrophobic [31, 32]. The Y and A zeolites have a higher trend for 

molecule encapsulation since they are the ones with the lower Si/Al ratio. On the 

contrary, ZSM-5 zeolite, being composed exclusively by Si, shows the lowest capacity 

for polar molecule encapsulation [32], including water and solvent molecules.

Influence of zeolite structure and che mistry on the electrical and crystallization response  

39 Ana Catarina Lopes 

2.3.4. Electrical Response 

It has been demonstrated that the introduction of zeolites on polymers in general and in 

PVDF in particular influences the dielectric response of the composites [13, 14]. In this 

study, the composites were prepared with zeolites with varying pore size, shape and 

Si/Al ratio in order to assess their relative relevance in modifying the electrical response 

of the material. Figure 2.4 (a) shows the frequency dependent dielectric constant for the 

neat polymer and for the four composites. The frequency dependence is similar for the 

composites and for the pure polymer, with the dielectric constant decreasing with 

increasing frequency [33], however, the values are higher for the composites, excepting 

for the PVDF/ZSM-5 one which shows dielectric constant values similar to the polymer 

matrix. This increase of the dielectric constant with the zeolite introduction is ascribed 

to two main factors. First, the existence of cations in the zeolite cavities leads to a 

confined movement of charges into the zeolite cavities and to an interfacial polarization 

effects in the zeolite-polymer interface [34]. The cations, that compensate the charge of 

the zeolite framework can become free to move through the zeolite cavities and 

channels when the applied electric field is enough to overcome that electrostatic force. 

However, the movement of the cations is blocked by the polymer surrounding the 

zeolites, reducing the conductivity and creating an induced dipole moment, which in 

turn gives rise to higher dielectric constant [13]. Further, the water and solvent molecule 

encapsulation within the zeolite cavities also contributes to the dielectric response. 

These polar molecules can rotate towards the dielectric field direction and contribute to 

the increase of dielectric constant [30, 35] 

This interpretation is supported by the dielectric behavior of the composite prepared 

with the ZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 2.4) , which does not content aluminous atoms and 

therefore has no charge compensation cations in the cavities. Furthermore, the structure 

of ZSM-5 is hydrophobic  and does not capture solvent and water molecules, when 

compared with aluminium containing zeolites. This fact is further supported by the 

above discussed TGA results (Figure 2.3). Due to these characteristics, the ZSM-5 

zeolite does not contribute to the increase of composite dielectric constant, which 

confirms the proposed mechanism for the increase of the dielectric response. 

On the contrary, zeolite A is the one that shows the lowest Si/Al ratio and so (Table 

2.1), the largest amount of cations in its cavities. This zeolite is also, together with Y 

zeolite, able to capture a significant amount of water and solvent molecules (Figure 2.3).

40 Ana Catarina Lopes 

The zeolites L and Y have a similar Si/Al ratio but different electrical response due to 

the different cavity geometry. The results show that the one dimensional channel system 

of L zeolite promotes the increase of dielectric constant, probably due to a increased 

cooperativity and alignment of the induced dipoles along the structure. On the other 

hand, since this increase of the dielectric constant is due to interfacial polarization, the 

smaller size of the L zeolite particle implies a larger contact area between zeolites and 

polymer that also contributes to a more significant effect of the dielectric constant. The 

relevance of the surface area for the increase of the dielectric constant is further 

confirmed by comparing the obtained dielectric results for the Y zeolite with the ones 

obtained in [12] with the same zeolite but with a smaller size. Specifically, dielectric 

constant of 11 and 46 are obtained at 1 kHz for average zeolite sizes of 2,2 and 0,45 ?m 

respectively for 16% wt composites

Figure 2.4 Real (a) and imaginary parts (b) of the dielectric function and electrical conductivity (c) as a 

function of the frequency for neat PVDF and the different composites. 

 

Composites also show an increase of the imaginary part of the dielectric function due 

the increase of ionic conductivity caused by the movement of charges within the zeolite 

structure as well as from interfacial effects (Figure 2.4 b). This fact is better reflected in 

the behavior of the a.c. conductivity, obtained from the dielectric measurements 

applying             and      
   

  
 (Figure 2.4 (c) ). The a.c. conductivity shows 

the same frequency dependent as the polymer but the value is (less than one order of 

magnitude) higher due to the larger number of ionic charge carriers provided by the 

zeolites. It is to notice at this point the the L zeolite shows K cations instead of Na as 

the other zeolites, fact that does not seem to have such a large effect in the electrical 

response. The effect of cation type for a given zeolite structure on the electrical 

response of the composites should nevertheless be also systematically addressed.

2.4. Conclusion 

This work discloses the influence of zeolites L, A, Y and ZSM-5 on the structural, 

thermal and electrical properties of PVDF. Zeolites Y and A shoe the ability to nucleate 

the electroactive phase of the polymer due to stronger electrostatic interactions related 

to larger cation content. Further, the channel microstructure also plays an important role 

as the L zeolite is not able to nucleate the ?-phase of the polymer due to a reduced lower 

interaction area with the polymer. The solvent and water encapsulation ability is directly 

related with the Si/Al ratio and so is the dielectric response of the material: lower Si/Al 

ratios promote larger dielectric constants and encapsulation efficiencies. Again, this 

response can be additionally refined by the dimensionality of the pore system. Thus, 

zeolite L containing 1D channels shows superior performance than the 3D pore system 

of zeolite Y.

Influence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  47 

3.1. Introduction 

Polymers are used in a wide variety of applications like structural parts, tissues, 

packaging, medical drugs, communications and many others [1, 2]. However, the need 

to improve their functional properties without substantial modifications of the 

characteristic polymer properties [3] lead to the incorporation of fillers within the 

polymer matrix, yielding polymer composites. Among functional polymers for 

advanced applications, one of the most interesting ones is poly(vinylidene fluoride) 

(PVDF) due to properties like ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity [4, 5] 

together with flexibility, biocompatibility, a good thermal  and chemical resistance [6, 

7]. These properties make PVDF interesting for application in the areas of sensor and 

actuator. PVDF is a semi-crystalline polymer that can be in four crystalline phases: ?, ?, 

? and ?. Each one of them can be obtained by varying processing conditions [8, 9]. For 

sensor and actuator applications, ?-phase of PVDF is typically obtained by the 

stretching of ?-phase PVDF [10], which is the polymorph obtained in the conventional 

extrusion processes. The ?-phase provides the larger piezoelectric and dielectric 

response of the pure polymer [11]. PVDF has been widely used in the production of 

composites by the incorporation of different fillers. In particular, PVDF/ceramic 

composites have been used in order to improve dielectric and piezoelectric response of 

the material [11, 12], PVDF/ferrites in order to achieve magnetic or magnetoelectric 

response [13, 14], PVDF/clay composites, in order to tailor phase content and improve 

optical transparency [15, 16], and PVDF/zeolite composites for modify the overall 

electrical response [17], among others.  

In particular, zeolite composites show large potential to modify composite response due 

both to their surface chemistry, large surface area and intrinsic porous microstructure 

[18] allowing to further encapsulate specific molecules within the zeolite cavities [19-

21]. The zeolites are crystalline hydrated aluminosilicates of alkali metals and earth 

alkali metals like sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. with the empirical 

formula M2/nO.Al2O3.xSiO2yH2O [22], where M represents the compensating cation with 

valence n, x is a number from 2 to 10 and y is a number from 2 to 7. They are formed 

by tetrahedron unit structures, with the [AlO4]
-5

 tetrahedron presented in [SiO4]

structure carrying the negative charge excess. This negative charge should be 

compensated by cations which exist within the cages and channels [23-25]. The cations, 



Chapter 3 

48 Ana Catarina Lopes 

together with water molecules, form hydration spheres and compensate the structure. 

The ionic exchange performed with cations allows to change the zeolite physical and 

chemistry properties such as thermal stability, adsorption capacity and amount and 

strength of acidic sites, among others [26]. The zeolite Y belonging to the faujasite 

(FAU) family is the one selected for the present work due to previous results where 

dielectric response of the PVDF/zeolite composites was improved using ionic 

exchanged NaY zeolite [17]. This zeolite is formed by a three dimensional structure 

with twelve silicon or aluminium atoms [27], yielding cavities that allows the 

incorporation of many different molecules. Some studies have been performed with 

zeolites within different polymer in order to improve their physical and chemical 

properties [28]. Zeolites have been used to improve the conductivity of polyaniline 

(PANI) [28], for gas separation applications on polymer membranes [29, 30]], 

heterogeneous catalysis [31, 32], proton exchange membranes for fuel-cells [32, 33] and 

for controlled drug release applications [33]. Zeolites are also being used to modify the 

phase and electrical response of PVDF [17, 34]. It was shown that the presence of 

cations in the zeolites cavities, induce an increase of the dielectric and conductivity 

response of the polymer due to restrict ionic motions and to an interfacial polarization 

effects [17], useful for a wide range of applications. In these studies it was also 

confirmed the encapsulation of water and/or solvent molecules within the zeolite 

cavities, contributing to the overall increase in the dielectric response of the composites. 

The PVDF composites were prepared by solvent casting, which implies contact of the 

zeolite with the polymer solution that can be encapsulated in the zeolite microporous 

structure and therefore affect the electrical properties of the zeolites. Solvents like N,N-

dimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide 

(DMSO), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 

tetramethylurea (TMU), triethylphosphate (TEP), and trimethylphosphate (TMP) are 

considered good solvents for PVDF [8] allowing the solvent casting of PVDF. Among 

these solvents, DMSO, DMF and TEP present distinct values of dielectric constant, 

providing a good set of materials for the main objective and novelty of the present 

investigation: analyze the effect of the different solvent on the processing of PVDF and 

PVDF/zeolite composites and analyze qualitatively and quantitatively the encapsulation 

of the solvents within the zeolite structure and their contribution to the overall electrical 

response of the composites. 



Influence of solvent properties on the electrical response of PV DF/NaY composites 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  49 

Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/NaY composite films studied in this work are based in a 

microporous material. Porous materials are classified according to their porous size in 

microporous (? 2 nm), mesoporous (2 ? 50 nm) and macroporous (&gt; 50 nm) materials 

[35]. Y zeolite is frequently chosen as a host to encapsulate compounds because of its 

large supercages (1.18 nm) with smaller pore opening (0.74 nm) suitable to 

accommodate the compounds [32]. All solvents used in this work have sizes smaller 

than the channels of the zeolite and can be entrapped into the zeolite (Table 3.1).

3.2.2. Preparation of ?-PVDF and ?-PVDF/NaY composite films 

The ?-PVDF and ?-PVDF/NaY films were prepared by solvent casting [17]. For the 

preparation of the ?-PVDF films, 1.0 g of PVDF was mixed with 4 mL of solvent 

(DMF, TEP or DMSO) during 1 h at 100 rpm and spread into a glass. For the 

production of ?-PVDF/NaY composite films, 16 % weight of zeolite were added to 4 

mL of solvent (DMF, TEP or DMSO) and placed in ultrasound bath during 6 h for 

homogenization. After that, 1 g of PVDF was added and mixed during 1 h at 100 rpm 

before spreading it into a glass. After these steps, films were melted in an oven kept at a 

controlled temperature for 10 min. The oven temperatures were 210, 256 and 230 ºC for 

the films prepared with DMF, TEP and DMSO, respectively. In this way, the difference 

between the boiling point of the solvent and the temperature at which the film is melted 

is maintained. These conditions guarantee the isothermal crystallization of PVDF. 

Finally, the films were removed from the oven and cooled down at room temperature. 

The thickness of the films was around 40-50 µm. 

 

3.2.3. Characterization 

Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were collected with a LEICA Cambridge S360 

Scanning Microscope. Prior to the analysis, the samples were coated with gold using a 

Fisons Instruments SC502 sputter coater. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

(FTIR) measurements were performed at room temperature using a Spectrum 100 

Perkin-Elmer apparatus in ATR mode over a range of 650–4000 cm
-1

 with a resolution 

of 4 cm
-1

. 32 scans were performed in each sample. Measurements of the ?’, real part of 

the dielectric function, and tan ?, dielectric loss, were performed at room temperature in 

a home-built sample holder with an automatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter. 

The signal of 0.5 V was applied for several frequencies in the range 100 Hz to 1 MHz. 

The samples were coated by sputtering with circular Au electrodes of 5 mm diameter 

onto both sides of the sample. The characteristic volume I–V curves were measured at 

room temperature with a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage source in a voltage range 

from -10 to 10 V. The thermal stability of the composite films as well as the pure 

polymer was studied with a Pyris1TGA from Perkin-Elmer. The atmosphere used was 

high purity nitrogen (99.99% minimum purity) with a flow rate of 20 mL.min

sample holders were 70 ?L crucibles of alumina oxide, in which approximately 3 mg 

sample was placed. The samples were heated between 25 and 450 ºC at 10 ºC.min

3.3. Results and discussion 

As observed in Figure 3.1, all samples show the typical spherulitic structure 

characteristic of neat ?-PVDF [35]. The effect of the solvent is the same for pristine 

polymer and composite samples: a reduction of the average size of the spherulites and a 

more imperfect microstructure is observed for TEP and DMSO in comparison to DMF, 

the most used solvent for PVDF. A further reduction of the spherulite size is observed 

for each composite samples with respect to its pure polymer sample counterpart, due to 

the influence of the zeolite in the crystallization process of the matrix [34, 36]. Further, 

no large agglomerated are observed in the composite samples, leading to the conclusion 

that the zeolite are well dispersed within the polymer matrix in all samples.

The neat PVDF films crystallize in the apolar ?-phase, as reported on the literature [10], 

and confirmed by FTIR (Figure 3.2). FTIR was also used to determine the crystalline 

phase of the polymer within the composite films, as electroactive phase nucleation has 

been observed in similar systems [16, 34]. The absorption bands obtained at 764 (CF2

correspond to the zeolite NaY band, (Si-O-Si) and confirms their presence in the 

structure [37]. In this way, it was confirmed that the polymer crystallizes in ?-phase 

independently of the solvent used in both neat polymer and composite films.

Figure 3.2 FTIR spectra for polymer and composite samples with different solvents. 

 

As reported before, NaY zeolite has been studied in PVDF composites due to its 

capacity to influence the dielectric response of the polymer [17]. The variations of the 

real part of the dielectric constant, ??, with frequency for the polymer and composites 

films are presented in Figure 3.3 (a). It is shown that preparation of neat polymer film 

with different solvents does not influence the dielectric constant of the film indicating 

that the solvents are effectively removed during the fusion stage in the preparation of 

the polymer films. The composites films show, on the other hand, higher values of 

dielectric constant when compared with the pure polymer films [17, 38] but also quite 

different when compared to the films prepared from the different solvents. The values of 

the dielectric constant at a frequency of 1 kHz are presented in Figure 3.4. The observed 

increase of the dielectric constant in the composites with respect to the pristine polymer

samples is due to the motion of ions inside the zeolite framework. The existence of 

polymer around it blocks the porous cavities and limits the ions mobility, which results 

in an increase of the dielectric constant. There are contributions to this increase by the 

interfacial polarization between the zeolite structure and the polymer, (Maxwell-

Wagner-Sillars polarization [17, 38]. It is nevertheless observed (Figure 3.3 (a)) that the 

solvent uses strongly influences the dielectric response of the composites films 

(especially at low frequencies). Composites with DMF and DMSO have the highest 

dielectric constant values, while the one with TEP shows the lowest values. Comparing 

these values with the dielectric constant of the pure solvents it is verified that the 

solvent with the larger dielectric constant (Table 3.1) lead to higher dielectric response 

of composites. 

This effect can be explained by two different phenomena. The presence of organic 

molecules inside the zeolite cages can drastically modify the distribution of intra zeolite 

cations [39], changing the activation energy and the Coulomb attraction between the 

cations and zeolite framework and, consequently, the confined mobility partly 

responsible for the dielectric constant increase. On the other hand, the motion of polar 

molecules on the presence of an electrical field leads, directly, to an increase of 

dielectric constant values [40]. 

The dielectric loss, tan ?, as a function of frequency for all the prepared samples are 

represented in Figure 3.3 (b). Its value is calculated from tan ?=?’’/?’, where ?’ is the 

real part of the dielectric permittivity ?’’is the frequency dependence of the imaginary 

part of the dielectric permittivity. Similarly to dielectric constant values, the films of 

neat polymer prepared with different solvents does not present significant variations. 

However, the presence of NaY zeolite on the polymer matrix increases, for all cases, the 

dielectric losses of the composites [17, 38]. This increase is particularly large for 

composites prepared with DMSO and DMF solvents, while TEP present the lower 

values of dielectric losses.

The influence of the solvents on the dielectric losses indicates an increase of the zeolite 

cations mobility and, consequently, on the composites conductivity. For better 

understanding this influence, both a.c and d.c conductivities were studied. The a.c. 

conductivity of all the samples is represented in Figure 3.5 (a) as was calculated from

small d.c. component below ~1 kHz. The a.c. conductivity increases with the frequency,

what is associated to a higher mobility of the ions present in the zeolite and it is to be 

understood in the scope of the Dyre model [41]. Comparing the different samples, it can 

be observed that the a.c. conductivity of the neat polymer (Figure 3.5 (b)) is very similar 

independently of the solvent used. On the other hand, the solvent molecules presence 

can change the a.c. conductivity of the composites by more than one order of 

magnitude, especially at the lower frequencies. The composites prepared with DMSO 

shows highest a.c. conductivity, followed by DMF and TEP, what indicates that the 

solvents with the higher dielectric constant (and lower molecular weight) contribute 

more for ion transport.

Measurements of d.c. conductivity were performed for PVDF/NaY composite films. 

The introduction of NaY zeolite within the PVDF matrix induces two changes on the 

behavior of the electrical conductivity [38]. First, there is an increase on the 

conductivity values of the composites when compared with the neat polymer. Further, 

the conductivity behavior is divided into two regimes. The first regime is linear and the 

conductivity value is lower than the conductivity values of the second regime. The 

second one is also linear, but with higher values of conductivity. The intersection 

voltage separating these two regimes of the I-V curves is called “break voltage” [42]. 

This voltage is enough to reach the activation energy associated to the motion of the 

cations, i.e., is strong enough to break the interaction between ions and the zeolite 

framework and so they becomes free to move into zeolite cavities, increasing the 

conductivity of the composites. Since the “breaking voltage” just depends on the nature

of the charge-balancing cations and the zeolite structure, the presence of different 

amounts of NaY does not affect its value when samples with different zeolite 

percentage are prepared with the same solvent [38]. However, the presence of some 

molecules as water or solvents can act as a support for cation mobility and so decreases 

the potential barrier for ionic mobility [39]. This fact occurs due to a covalent 

interaction of solvent molecules with the protons and sodium ions of zeolite [43]. In this 

way, the different molecular compositions of the encapsulated solvents originate 

different effects on the conductivity of the sample, as confirmed by the results presented 

in Figure 3.5. This figure reveals the large influence of the molecules entrapped on the 

zeolite in the sample conductivity. TEP, the solvent with the lower dielectric constant, is 

the one leading to composites with the smaller conductivity. Higher values are obtained 

for DMF and DMSO samples. Besides this, the nature and strength of interaction 

between the cations and zeolite structure is affected, what gives rise to a change in the 

“breaking voltage” value. The “breaking voltage” for the samples prepared with DMF is 

~ 4V, while the “breaking voltage” of the samples prepared with DMSO, solvent with 

the higher polarity among the ones used, is ~ 2V. Apparently, the presence of polar 

molecules decreases the activation energy of the conductivity process, and so, the 

voltage needed for the beginning of the second conductivity regime is lower. The 

composite prepared with TEP, on the contrary to other two, does not present a double 

regime and the conductivity value is much lower when is compared to the other 

composites. This fact is ascribed to the higher value of “breaking voltage” of this 

composite. Due to the lower dielectric constant of TEP, it does not support cation 

mobility and therefore a higher activation energy is needed for the initiation of the 

second conductivity process. Consequently, the “breaking voltage” of this composite is 

higher than 10 V and so only the first linear regime of conductivity is observed.  

Finally, thermogravimetric analysis was performed on both neat polymer samples and 

the corresponding composite films, in order to investigate the possible encapsulation of 

the solvent within the zeolite structure that would explain the aforementioned effects. 

Thermogravimetric measurements do not show any difference in the neat polymer 

samples, just the results for neat PVDF prepared with DMSO solvent is represented 

since the other two are overlapping. On the other hand, the composite films show 

different thermal-response according to the solvents used. As shown in Figure 3.6, 

composites films have a common mass loss step between 50 and 100 ºC, that

corresponds to water loss present on zeolite cavities, and a second mass loss step at 

higher temperatures, corresponding to solvent loss, which occurs at different 

temperatures depending on the solvent used for the preparation of the composites. Since 

the second step of mass loss can just be seen in the composites and not in the neat 

polymeric films and occurs at different temperatures on the different composites, the 

experiment demonstrates that solvent was encapsulated in zeolite structure and explains 

the observed differences in the overall electrical response of the composites. The 

composite with TEP solvent has the temperature of second step higher when is 

compared to DMF and DMSO composites films. This behaviour is due to the different 

boiling points of solvents (Table 3.1) and also to the different interactions between the 

solvents and the zeolite framework.

3.4. Conclusion 

Highly flexible PVDF/NaY composite films were prepared by solvent casting with three 

different solvents: DMF, DMSO and TEP. All the samples maintain the non-polar ?-

phase and the typical spherulitic structure of PVDF and the presence of NaY cause a 

decrease of the spherulitic size. The presence of NaY also induces an increase of the 

dielectric constant in all composites when compared with pure ?-PVDF due to confined 

mobility of sodium cations on zeolite structure. The dielectric constant of the solvent 

used also influences the dielectric and conductivity response of the composite films, 

since its molecules are encapsulated into the zeolite cavities. Solvent molecules change 

the distribution of intra zeolite cations and so the activation energy and the Coulomb 

attraction between cations and zeolite framework. On the other hand, the solvent polar 

molecules are oriented on the presence of an electrical field. Due these facts, higher 

dielectric constant solvent leads to a higher dielectric constant response composite. The 

composite prepared with DMSO present the higher dielectric constant followed by 

DMF and TEP. Two regimes on I-V curve are observed for DMF and DMSO 

composites, however, the last one presents a lower “breaking voltage” value. The 

second regime on TEP composites is not observed probably due the too higher 

“breaking voltage” value observed.

Electrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  65 

4.1. Introduction 

Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a semi-crystalline polymer with the largest piezo 

and ferroelectric responses among polymers [1]. The piezoelectric ability of the material 

to convert mechanical into electrical energy and vice versa allows important 

applications in the areas of sensors and actuators [2]. The electroactive properties of the 

material are intimately related to the presence of some of the crystalline phases of 

PVDF, in particular, the ?- and the ?-phases. The ?-phase can be obtain by mechanical 

stretching of the ?-phase (non-polar phase), by applying a strong poling electrical field 

or by crystallizing from solution with either dimethylformamide (DMF) or 

dimethylacetamide (DMA) at temperatures below 70 ºC [3, 4]. The later method results, 

nevertheless, in highly porous and fragile films [5]. On the other hand, the 

crystallization or annealing at temperatures close to the melting temperature of PVDF 

promotes the development of the ?-phase [6]. 

Together to these processing strategies, the nucleation of both electroactive phases, ? or 

?-phases, can be also achieved by micro and nanoparticle inclusions in the polymer 

matrix [7-9]. This strategy shows several advantages with respect to the aforementioned 

ones: a) new functionalities can be added to the polymer, such as magnetoelectric [10] 

and electro-optical responses [11], among others; b) it does not imply further processing 

steps such as stretching or the application of high electric fields; c) it allows the 

preparation of thin and thick samples and samples with different shapes and formats by 

techniques such as spin-coating [12], electrospinning [13], dip-coatig, etc and d) it 

facilitates integration into micro and nanodevices [14]. 

Nanoclays, layered alumina-silicates that consist on very thin layers usually bounded to 

together with counter-ions [15], are one of the most recent and interesting nanoparticles 

used for this purpose [9, 11, 16]. In this case, the nucleation of the electroactive phase of 

PVDF is also strongly affected by the processing conditions, such as the processing 

temperature [11]. In this way, when the PVDF/clay composite is prepared from the melt 

at 200 ºC it crystallizes in the ?-phase, whereas the ?-phase is obtained when the 

composite is crystallized from temperatures below 200 ºC [11]. Considering that this 

effect is associated to surface interactions between the nanofillers and the polymer, it is 

interesting to investigate whether the effect will occur in PVDF composites with 

particles that share similar physical and chemical surface properties than the clays, such

as zeolites. Further, whereas clays show a layered crystalline structure with a swelling 

and shrinking behaviour as water is absorbed or removed [17], zeolites show a rigid 

three-dimensional framework of tetrahedral SiO4 and AlO4 primary building units, 

forming channels and cavities with sizes in the range of molecular dimensions [18]. 

This intricate channel structure makes them an interesting material for shape selectivity 

and, differently from the clays, foreign molecules can move freely in and out the zeolite 

pores without affecting the zeolite framework. Furthermore, zeolites can be used to 

produce stable materials with respect to heat, steam and chemical attacks, making them 

suitable for a wide range of applications [19]. 

It has been proven that PVDF/Y zeolite composites prepared from the melt at 210 ºC 

originate highly flexible films with increased dielectric response, being the PVDF/NaY 

the one with the most interesting dielectric properties [20]. The dielectric constant of 

these composites increases with respect to the pure polymer and depends on Si/Al ratio 

and zeolite content. An increase on the composite electrical conductivity is also 

observed associated to an intrazeolite charge transport. However, the crystallization of 

PVDF polymer occurs on ?-phase [20, 21]. The present work shows the novel, 

important and interesting fact that the processing temperature influences the 

crystallization phase of the polymer, leading to PVDF/NaY zeolite composites with the 

polymer in one of its electroactive phases. Further, the electroactive phase is obtained 

without the need of a stretching process, which allows easier processing of the material 

and fabrication of devices. In this way, the combination of the electroactivity of the 

polymer matrix and the cage structure of the zeolites results in composites with large

Electrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  67 

4.2. Experimental 

Composite films of PVDF and NaY zeolite with zeolite concentrations of 4, 16, 24 and 

32 wt% and with a thickness of ~ 50 µm were prepared by spreading a solution of 

PVDF (Solef 1010 from Solvay, Belgium) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, Merck) 

solvent on a glass slide. Previously, the zeolite was dried at 120 ºC for 2 h added to 4 

mL of DMF and placed in an ultrasound bath for 4 h. 1 g of PVDF in powder form was 

added to this suspension and dissolved with the help of a magnetic stirrer (JPSelecta, 

Agimatic-E). After being melted at 190 ºC or at 210 ºC for 10 min, the film was 

removed from the oven and cooled down at room temperature. 

The NaY zeolites used for the preparation of the composites were obtained from Zeolyst 

International (Conshohocken, PA 19428-2240 USA) with the following characteristics 

(CBV 100): Si/Al ratio: 2.83; Nominal Cation Form: Sodium; Na2O weight: 13%; Unit 

cell size: 24.65 A; Surface Area: 900 m
2
/g. 

The microstructure of the composite matrix and the dispersion of the NaY zeolite was 

analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) surface images taken from the top 

side of the as prepared samples with a JEOL JSM-5410 scanning microscope. The 

samples were previously coated with a thin gold layer using a sputter coater (Polaron, 

model SC502). 

The phase of the polymer within the composite samples was analysed by Fourier 

Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Spectrum 100, Attenuate Total Reflectance 

mode) in the range between 650 and 4000 cm
?1

, on 32 scans. The error associated to the 

phase content evaluation is ± 2%. 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed in samples of ~6 mg on a 

Mettler Toledo DSC 823 apparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 

? 0.2 ºC/min. The error associated to the evaluation of the transition temperature, 

calculated after three replicas from different parts of the sample, is ± 1%. 

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed in approx. 4± 0.01 mg samples 

with a STD Q600 DETA instrument. The atmosphere used was high purity nitrogen 

(99.99% minimum purity) with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. During the experiments, the 

samples were subjected to a heating rate of 10 ± 0.2 °C/min between 25 and 800 ºC. 

The samples of PVDF/NaY 4% and 32% were also subjected to different heating rates

of 5 ± 0.1, 10 ± 0.2, 20 ± 0.4 and 30 ± 0.5ºC/min, between 25 and 800 ºC, in order to 

evaluate the degradation kinetics of the process. The large span of heating rated allow a 

proper determination of the activation energy of the process. The error associated to the 

evaluation of the TGA parameters, such as activation energy, calculated after three 

replicas from different parts of the sample, is ± 2%. 

The dielectric constant was calculated from the values of capacity and tan ? obtained 

with a an automatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter at room temperature in a 

home-built sample holder. A signal of 1 V was applied for a range of frequencies 

between 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Circular Au electrodes of 2,5 ± 0.1  mm radius were coated 

by magnetron sputtering on both sides of each sample. The associated error to the 

determination of the dielectric response calculated after three replicas from different 

parts of the sample is is 2%. 

Characteristic I-V curves were measured at room temperature with a Keithley 6487 

picoammeter/voltage source at a voltage range from -10 to 10 V.  

 

 

4.3. Results and Discussion 

The production of PVDF composites by solution casting and melting is a common 

procedure, and the melting temperature is typically performed at 210ºC, temperature 

that ensues the melting of polymer and the complete solvent removal [23]. Due to 

previous investigation indicating the importance of the processing temperature in 

PVDF/clay composites [11], composites of PVDF with 4, 16, 24 and 32 wt% of NaY 

were prepared by solvent casting and melting at 190 ºC (PVDF/NaY190ºC) and 210 ºC 

(PVDF/NaY210ºC) previous to crystallization at room temperature. 

 

a) Microstructural features 

Figure 4.1 shows SEM images of the PVDF/NaY composites. The spherulitic structure 

characteristic of the neat ?-PVDF [24] is observed for the 4% and 16 wt% composite 

samples. Further, a good dispersion of the zeolite filler is observed in the SEM images 

(Figure 4.1), which is corroborated by the electrical, thermal and FTIR measurements 

from different part of the samples. The decreasing size of the spherulites with increasing 



Electrical and thermal behavior of ?-phase PVDF/NaY zeolite composites 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  69 

filler content indicates that the filler act as nucleation agent during the crystallization 

process, as observed in other composites systems [10]. Increasing zeolite content in the 

polymer matrix above 16% leads to the formation of large zeolite agglomerates and a 

disruption of the polymer microstructure. The effect of the crystallization temperature 

can be observed by comparison of Figure 4.1 (b) and (d), corresponding to the 16 wt% 

sample crystallized after melting at 190 and 210 ºC, respectively. In both cases a good 

dispersion of the filler is observed, as well as the characteristic spherulitic 

microstructure. On the other hand, the samples melted at lower temperatures show 

smaller spherulites, indicating the influence of melting temperature on the polymer 

composites crystallization.

Variation in the nucleation kinetics can lead to variations in the crystalline phase of the 

polymer [23]. In order to understand this possible effect in the composites, the 

crystalline phase of the polymer composites was investigated by FTIR-ATR. The ?-

phase of PVDF is characterized by a wide range of bands [25], including the ones at 

764, 796, 1149 and 1383 cm
-1

. The identification of the crystalline phase has to be 

performed carefully, as some bands are similar for different crystalline phases [26]. This 

is particularly important in the case of the electroactive ? and ? phases, where the bands 

at 510, 512, 833, 838, 840, 883 and 884 cm
-1

 are superposition of ? and ? phases [27]. 

Therefore, these bands, often used for the identification of the phases, do not really 

allow to clearly identifying the specific electroactive phase of the polymer. Bands with 

no superposition from different phases are the ones at 445 and 467 cm
-1

, characteristics 

of the ? phase and the ones at 431, 812 and 1234 cm
-1
, characteristics from the ?-phase 

[27]. 

Figure 4.2 shows the FTIR-ATR spectra for the PVDF/NaY190ºC composites with 4, 16, 

24 and 32 wt% and for the PVDF/NaY210ºC composite 16%. According to FTIR bands in 

the range from 700 to 1500 cm
-1
, the characteristic bands from ? and ?-phases are 

identified [25,27-29]. The spectra of the PVDF/NaY190ºC and PVDF/NaY210ºC 

composites with 16%wt is particularly interesting: the spectra of the composite 

PVDF/NaY210ºC present the bands at 764 and 976 cm
-1
, identifying just the nonpolar ?-

phase [25]; on the other hand, when the same composite is prepared by melting at the 

temperatures of 190ºC, PVDF/NaY190ºC, the bands characteristics of from the ?-phase 

disappear and the ones at 812, 833 and 838 cm
-1 
appear, identifying the ?-phase.

Figure 4.2 FTIR-ATR spectra of PVDF/NaY composite with different NaY filler contents and obtain 

after melting at different temperatures. 

 

Analyzing the spectra for the PVDF/NaY190ºC composites with 4, 16, 24 and 32 wt% 

(Figure 4.2) a relationship between ?-phase and NaY content on the composite can be 

obtained. For the composite with NaY 4 wt%, the characteristic bands of the ?-phase, 

764 and 976 cm
-1

 suffer a decrease with respect to the ones obtained for the pure 

polymer, but they only disappear for the composites with a higher NaY content, where 

the polymer crystallizes practically in the ?-phase. The quantification of ?-phase content 

is performed by the application of the method presented in [3, 30]. Assuming that the 

crystalline phase of the polymer is either in the ? and/or ? phases (i.e. no ?-phase is 

present), the ? phase content will be given by equation 4.1:

c) Thermal properties 

The composite samples were also studied by DSC scans (Figure 4.3). The main 

conclusion is the shift of the melting temperature to higher temperatures as corresponds 

to the higher thermal stability of the ?-phase in comparison to the ?-phase [4, 23]. 

Again, it is interesting to notice the difference in the melting temperature of the 

composites with 16 wt% NaY crystallized after melting at the different temperatures: 

whereas the melting behavior of the PVDF/NaY210ºC samples is the same as for the ?-

phase sample, the PVDF/NaY190ºCshows the higher thermal stability of the electroactive 

phase. The degree of crystallinity of the polymer does not suffer significant variations 

with increasing zeolite content, remaining in the order of ~48%.

Figure 4.3 DSC thermograms under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10ºC/min for ?-PVDF and 

the PVDF/NaY composites with different amounts of NaY zeolite. 

 

In order to understand the zeolite-polymer interactions and whether the zeolite can 

effectively encaged molecules which could be affect the electrical response of the 

composites, dynamic thermogravimetric analyses were performed. Figure 4.4 shows the 

weight loss of?-PVDF and the composite films as a function of temperature, measured 

at 10
o
C/min. The comparison of the TGA results was made with ?-phase from PVDF 

due to the impossibility to obtain the total ?-phase crystallization for the neat polymer. 

Figure 4.4 shows that the thermal degradation in the composites occurs in several steps, 

being the one above 400 ºC the most relevant one and corresponds to the main 

degradation of PVDF. One of the most distinct features is the loss of mass below 400 ºC 

that is not present in the pure ?-PVDF and that increases as the zeolite content 

increases. In the range of temperature at 50-400 ºC, the TGA curves show the existence 

of two stages of mass loss. The first stage takes place at 50-200 ºC and corresponds to a 

mass loss of about 10 % for the composite with the larger zeolite content and is related 

to water and solvent molecules entrapped in zeolite framework during the preparation of 

composites. The second stage at 200-400 ºC corresponds to a mass loss around   3 %. 

As previously mentioned, the three-dimensional zeolite framework forms channels and 

cavities with sizes in the range of molecules, which can, be occupied by molecules [31-

33] or affect thermal degradation of the polymer through catalytic effects [34, 35], 



Chapter 4 

74 Ana Catarina Lopes 

leading to a shift of the main degradation process and therefore to the residues observed 

at a given temperature. However, PVDF polymer presents a high thermal stability [36]. 

The main degradation process identified is associated to a carbon-hydrogen bond 

scission, that always primarily occurs due the lower bond strength energy of C-H 

compared to C-F bond (410 and 460 KJ/mol, respectively) [37]. The onset temperature 

of this degradation process increases with increasing NaY content indicating that it 

provides more stability to the polymer phase.

Figure 4.4 (b) shows also a relationship between the mass loss of composite and the 

temperature at which it was melted during its preparation. Two important facts are 

observed: the mass loss at temperatures below 400 ºC is lower for the PVDF/NaY210ºC 

composites and the thermal stability they provide to the polymer seems to be higher. 

These facts strongly indicate that the interactions between polymer and zeolite structure, 

leading to the crystallization in the electroactive phase, are changed due to the thermal 

history previous to crystallization.

Figure 4.5 TGA results obtained for the PVDF/NaY 4% at different heating rates (a) and plots of the 

logarithm of the heating rate vs reciprocal temperature during the PVDF/NaY 4% degradation at various 

conversion levels (b). All linear fittings with R &gt; 0.996. 

 

The main thermal degradation process can be quantitatively characterized by the 

activation energy (Eact) determined by the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) method [38, 39]. 

In this case the kinetic parameters were obtained by applying multiple heating rates and, 

from the TGA degradation plots, the temperature is estimated for a specific conversion 

level. Figure 4.5 (a) represents the plot for various heating rates for the PVDF/NaY 4 

wt% composite. As expected, Tonset is shifted to higher temperatures with increasing 

heating rate, shifting from 451 ºC to 513 ºC for a heating rate of 5ºC/min and 30ºC/min, 

respectively. Figure 4.5 (b) shows the corresponding plot of the logarithms of the 

heating rates against the inverse of the absolute temperatures, which originates a straight 

line whose slop is proportional to the activation energy. Comparing the activation 

energies of ?-PVDF with the ones obtained for the different composites (Figure 4.6), it 

can be observed that the one with 4 wt% of NaY shows a similar kinetic parameter that 

neat ?-PVDF. On the other hand, the composite with the highest filler concentration, 

PVDF/NaY 32 wt%, the activation energy increases strongly. This indicates stronger 

chemical or physical bond between the filler and the matrix, since higher activation 

energies are associated to reactions of the macromolecules with small molecules and/or 

radicals existing in polymers [40]. Probably, the microporous zeolite structure is 

blocked due to the cracking process and does not allow the polymer to diffuse more 

efficiently inside the zeolite. The initial polymer cracking probably occurs at the acid 

sites located on the external surface of the zeolite crystals or at the pore openings. This 

(b) (a) 



Chapter 4 

76 Ana Catarina Lopes 

cracking produces smaller molecules, which are able to diffuse inside the zeolite and 

transformed in coke due to the presence of Brønsted acid sites, leading to obstruction of 

the microporous structure [41, 42].

d) Electrical response 

The existence of cations as well as polar molecules into the zeolite cages can affect the 

electrical behavior of composites. In this way, measurements of dielectric response have 

been performed for the composites of PVDF/NaY190ºC with different NaY zeolite 

content. 

Figure 4.7 shows that the variation of ?’ as a function of frequency for the composites 

present a similar behavior than for the pure polymer. All the composites present a 

decrease in ?’ with increasing frequency, however, the overall values of the dielectric 

constant are higher for the composites as compared with the pure polymer and increase 

with increasing zeolite content, reaching values above 1000 for the composite with 32 

wt% of NaY zeolite. This effect is associated to restricted ionic motions and to 

interfacial polarization effects in the zeolite cavity and in the zeolite- polymer interface 

[43], caused by a confined mobility of the cations presented in the zeolite structure.

Under an electric field, the cations can overcome the negative electrostatic attraction 

and become free to move along the channels of the zeolite structure. However, and 

contrary to what happen on pure zeolite, since the zeolite nanoparticles in composite are 

surrounded by a polymer matrix, the ionic mobility of the ions is blocked which reduces 

the effect of conductivity and allows the creation of an induced dipole moment which 

results in high values of dielectric constant [20]. Despite the interfacial polarization be 

the main responsible factor for the increase of dielectric response, some others factors 

will contribute to the variations of the dielectric response, as the presence of water 

molecules and/or solvent or the crystalline phase of the polymer. In this way, the 

mobility of polar molecules such as water or DMF inside the zeolite cavities can also 

further contribute to the increase of ?’ values. In this way, samples prepared at 190 ºC 

showing larger water or solvent losses show higher values of the dielectric constant and 

the dielectric losses, due to the nature of the contribution to the dielectric response, 

being accompanied by high dielectric losses as presented in Figure 4.8.

Figure 4.8 Real part of the dielectric constant (a) (b) and dielectric loss (c) (d) as a function of the 

frequency for the composites 

 

The variation of the dielectric response on the samples obtained after the different 

crystallization temperatures can be observed by comparing the dielectric response of the 

composites with 16 wt% and 32 wt% of NaY melted at 210 ºC and 190 ºC. Figure 4.8 

shows the comparison between the variation on the real part of the dielectric constant 

(a) (b) and dielectric loss (c) (d) as a function of the frequency for both composites. It is 

observed that the melting of the material at different temperatures influences its 

dielectric behavior. The PVDF/NaY190ºC compositespresent higher values of ?’ when 

compared with the PVDF/NaY210ºC composites. This fact can be explained by the 

different crystallization phase presented by these materials. Polymer chain of PVDF on 

the ?-phase presents a lower dipole moment when compared with the ?-phase, which 

translates in higher interactions with the zeolite structure and with the surrounding 

molecules. On the other hand, these results can also be associated to a more effective

encapsulation of water molecules in the zeolite supercages when the sample is melted at 

lower temperatures, as confirmed by TGA (Figure 4.4).  

High values of dielectric losses indicate presence of ionic conductivity. In this way, it is 

important the study the d.c. and a.c conductivity in order to further understand this 

phenomenon. 

The a.c. conductivity was obtained from the dielectric measurements applying      

       and is represented in Figure 4.9 (c). An increase of 7 orders of magnitude is 

observed on the low frequency side of the a.c. conductivity by increasing zeolite 

content. A linear frequency dependence can be observed in Figure 4.9 (c). The increase 

of conductivity with frequency is associated to the higher mobility of the ions present in 

the zeolites and is to be understood in the scope of the Dyre model [44]. In the same 

way, the increase of zeolite content is associated to an increase of ions content, which 

explains the higher conductivity.

non-linear characteristics. The conductivity behavior of the composite can be divided in 

two different regimes. The first one goes up to a voltage value around 4 V, it is linear 

and similar to the one obtained for pure ?-PVDF. However, for higher voltages, a 

stronger increase of the conductivity is observed. This voltage value is known as 

“breaking voltage” and is defined as the voltage of the intersection of the two regimes 

(a) (b) (c)

of the I-V curves [45]. This value is the same for all the composites prepared at different 

percentages, although the conductivity of the composites is being higher for higher NaY 

zeolite contents. This fact is explained by a mechanism of intrazeolite charge transport: 

the applied voltage after the “breaking voltage” is strong enough to break the interaction 

between ions and the zeolite framework, that gain mobility and facilitates the 

intracrystalline charge migration. So, the needed voltage to release the ions depends 

only on the nature of the charge-balancing cations and the zeolite structure, which 

explains the similar value of “breaking voltage” for all the composites. However, after 

this point, the electrical conductivity of composites is significantly affected by zeolite 

percentage, since a higher percentage means a larger number of cations, what is 

translated in higher ionic conductivity, further, increasing filler concentration also leads 

to zeolite agglomerates leading to intra zeolite charge transport and increasing 

conductivity. This effect is particularly relevant for concentrations above 16%. Taking 

into account the slope of the I-V plot for the higher conductivity regime of the different 

samples, it is concluded that the electrical conductivity increases up to 7 orders of 

magnitude by increasing zeolite content (Figure 4.9 (a) and (b)). Since the water is a 

medium for ion transport, its content into zeolite cavities also affects the conductivity of 

composite. Water content and electrical conductivity are higher therefore by increasing 

zeolite content. The comparison of I-V curves of PVDF/NaY190ºC and PVDF/NaY210ºC 

composites with 16% NaY identify this fact (Figure 4.9). It is shown that the melting 

temperature does not affect the form of the I-V curve. The composite PVDF/NaY190ºC, 

similarly to PVDF/NaY210ºC, increases its conductivity when compared with the pure ?-

PVDF, and also the linear regime is replaced by a double regime behavior. However, 

the conductivity values are quite different. It can be observed that the conductivity of 

PVDF/NaY190ºC is one order of magnitude higher than the one of PVDF/NaY210ºC, the 

breaking voltage still being the same in both cases (~ 4 V), as it just depends on the 

nature of the charge-balancing cation and the zeolite structure [45]. Finally, it is 

important to notice the large different in the electrical properties of the PVDF-zeolite 

composites as compared to the PVDF-clay counterparts [26], despite both fillers being 

able to nucleate the electroactive phase of PVDF, being both the dielectric constant and 

electrical conductivity much larger for the zeolite composites due to both water and ion 

content.

4.4. Conclusion 

Composite films of PVDF with NaY zeolite were successfully prepared by solvent 

casting, melting and recrystallization. It was demonstrated that the melting temperature 

can affect the PVDF crystallization phase. In this way, the composites prepared after 

melting at 190ºC crystallize in the ?-phase, while the ones prepared after melting at 

210ºC crystallize in the ?-phase. The composites show a higher thermal stability and the 

presence of water molecules encapsulated in the zeolite structure. Both effects are 

dependent on zeolite content and composite preparation temperature. The presence of 

ions to stabilize the zeolites structure causes an increase of dielectric response of the 

composite due to the confined mobility into the zeolites cavities and to interfacial 

effects. The presence of these ions in zeolites is also responsible for the existence of 

non-linear I-V curves with two regimes separated by the break voltage in which a strong 

increase of conductivity takes place due to the resale of the ion-zeolite interaction. The 

presence of trapped water molecules as well as the electroactive phase of the polymer 

contribute to the increase of the values of both the dielectric constant and the 

conductivity.

Dielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  89 

5.1. Introduction 

Electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride)/zeolite composites are interesting materials for 

advanced applications due to the electroactive properties of the polymer matrix [1, 2] 

and the characteristics of the nanoporous zeolite structures which allow tailoring optical, 

magnetic and electric properties by suitable synthesis strategies and the possibility to 

host specific guest molecules within the framework [3-6]. Poly(vinylidene fluoride), 

PVDF, shows excellent mechanical properties, high thermal and chemical stability and 

the strongest piezo-, pyro and ferroelectric responses among polymers [2], allowing a 

variety of technological applications such as sensors and actuators. This semi-crystalline 

polymer is also known for its polymorphism. It can be  obtained in polar (?, ? and ?) 

and non-polar (?) phases by the variation of crystallization conditions [7], which 

include control of crystallization temperature [8],  mechanical stretching [9] or the 

introduction of specific fillers [10-12]. 

The dielectric response of PVDF is one of the key parameters for applications. Neat 

PVDF shows a dielectric constant between 6 and 12 at room temperature, depending of 

the polymorph, and two main relaxation processes. The first relaxation process is 

known as the ?-relaxation. It occurs at low temperatures and it is associated to 

cooperative segmental motions within the main chains of the amorphous regions during 

the glass transition of the polymer. The second relaxation, known as the ?-relaxation, 

appears at higher temperatures and it is associated to molecular motions within the 

crystalline fraction of the polymer [13-16] or in the crystal-amorphous interphase 

region, [17]. It has been shown that poling the electroactive phase of PVDF, an 

important step for using the material for sensor applications, does not affect the 

relaxation temperatures of PVDF, the ?-relaxation appearing around -35 ºC and the ?-

relaxation above 40ºC, at 1Hz [18]. 

Zeolites are microporous crystalline aluminosilicates formed by the coordination of 

? ? ?4

SiO  and ? ? ?5

AlO  with oxygen atoms bonding neighboring tetrahedral [19]. Their 

uniform and molecular-sized pores makes them interesting for catalysis [20], adsorption 

[21] and ion exchange [22] applications. Together with these applications with the 

zeolites in powder form, these materials have been used separation membranes and 

membrane reactors in the form of films [23]. The dielectric properties of zeolites are 

influenced by several factors, such as the nature of the cations, their size and charge, the 

lattice structure and the degree of hydration [24].  



Chapter 5 

90 Ana Catarina Lopes 

One of the most interesting and used zeolite structures is the NaY-zeolite. It shows 

interesting electrical properties ascribed to two main processes: a low-temperature 

process associated to local motions (dielectric relaxation) and a high-temperature 

process associated to translational motions (diffusion/conductivity) [25]. At low 

frequency, the dielectric relaxation process is assigned to a Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars 

process that is shifted to higher frequency as temperature increases. The latter relaxation 

at the highest frequencies, is ascribed to the local motions of cations in the ?-cage 

and/or rotational fluctuations of water molecules [26, 27]. However, the large mobility 

of the exchangeable cations (local polarization in the supercages and long-range 

migration over larger distances) results in a high electrical ionic conductivity [25, 26]. 

The influence of zeolite content in the dielectric relaxation and electrical conductivity of 

zeolite-polymer composites has been scarcely reported. In particular, it has been shown 

that ionic relaxation dominates the ac conductivity behavior of zeolite – conductive 

polymer composites [28, 29]. 

Previous studies on PVDF-zeolites composites demonstrate that the presence of NaY 

zeolite in the PVDF matrix induces an increase of the room temperature dielectric 

response of the polymer associated to confined ion mobility in the zeolite cavities and to 

a Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization [30]. Further, the presence of NaY zeolite can 

also induce the ?-phase crystallization of the polymer, leading to piezoelectric 

composites [31]. In this way, PVDF/zeolite composites appear as a very promising set 

of materials with a wide range of potential applications. The electrical behavior of these 

materials is critical for the development of applications and therefore deserved a deep 

investigation in order to to assess the effect of nanoparticle contents and polymer-zeolite 

interactions on the ion and dipole mobility.  

In the present work, PVDF/ NaY zeolite composite films with different NaY zeolite 

contents were prepared by solvent casting. The microstructure and crystalline phase 

were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy  and Fourier transform infrared 

spectroscopy, respectively. The dielectric relaxation spectrum and electrical 

conductivity behavior were evaluated and the the electric modulus formalism was 

applied at high temperatures in order get insight on the origin of the electrical response 

of the composite.

5.2. Experimental 

 

5.2.1. Sample preparation 

Composite films of PVDF (Solef 1010) with different NaY zeolite contents were 

prepared by solvent casting [30]. The zeolite was obtained from Zeolyst International 

(Conshohocken, PA 19428-2240 USA) in powder form with the following 

characteristics (CBV 100): Si/Al ratio = 2.83 with 7.76 % of sodium content (which 

corresponds to 47.2 sodium for unit cell) and a specific surface area of 787 m
2
/g.  

 The zeolite was dried at 120 ºC for 2h and added to N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) 

solvent. The suspension was then placed in an ultrasound bath for 4 h for 

homogenization. After this period, 1 g of PVDF polymer was added to the zeolite 

suspension and dissolved under magnetic stirring. Finally, the material was spread on a 

glass slide and the solvent was evaporated in an oven at 190ºC for 10 min (at this 

temperature the polymer is in the liquid state). In this way, homogeneous composite 

films with a thickness of ~ 50 µm were prepared with different zeolite contents (wt/wt 

%): 0 (PVDF), 4 (PVDF/NaY4% ) and 16 % (PVDF/NaY16%). 

 

5.2.2. Characterization 

Samples were coated with gold using a sputter coating and their morphology was 

observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model JSM-6300, JEOL) with an 

accelerating voltage of 10 kV.  

Infrared measurements (FTIR) were performed at room temperature in a Perkin-Elmer 

Spectrum 100 apparatus in ATR mode from 4000 to 650 cm
-1

. FTIR spectra were 

collected with 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm
-1

.  

Dielectric measurements were carried out using an impedance analyzer Alpha-S. The 

temperature control was assured by a Quatro Cryosystem from Novocontrol GmbH. 

Circular gold electrodes (10 mm diameter) were deposited onto both sides of each 

sample, to form a parallel plate capacitor, by sputtering with a Polaron Coater SC502 

under an Argon atmosphere. The sample cell with active head dielectric converter was 

mounted on a cryostat (BDS 1100) and exposed to a heated gas stream evaporated from 

a liquid nitrogen Deward. The isothermal experiments were performed from ?120 ºC to

5.3. Results and discussion 

 

5.3.1. Microstructure and PVDF crystalline phase in the composites 

The microstructure of the composites was analyzed by SEM in order to evaluate of the 

dispersion of the zeolite filler into the PVDF matrix.  SEM images of composite films 

with different zeolite contents (Figures 5.1 (a) to 5.1 (c)) show the good dispersion of 

the zeolite particles in the polymer matrix, larger zeolite clusters just appearing for the 

highest filler contents. It is also shown that the size of the PVDF spherulites decrease 

with increasing zeolite content and the spherulite contours can be hardly distinguished 

in the film with16 wt% zeolite.

Dielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  93 

 

Crystallization of PVDF in the ?-phase in the composites containing NaY zeolite fillers 

is identified by the presence of the characteristic vibration bands at 766, 812, 833, 838 

and 883 cm
-1

 in the FTIR spectra (Figure 5.1(d)) while the absorption bands at 765, 795, 

855 and 976 cm
-1

 demonstrate that pure PVDF subjected to the same thermal treatment 

(melting at 190 ºC) crystallizes in the ?-phase [32, 33]. Interactions between the dipolar 

moments of PVDF and the negatively charged NaY zeolite surfaces induce 

preferentially the trans- conformation of PVDF monomer units characteristic of the ?-

phase. However, this process only occurs when the sample is melted at temperatures 

below 200 ºC, the melting at temperatures above 200 ºC inducing the crystallization of 

the polymer in the apolar ?-phase [31]. A similar feature was previously observed in 

PVDF composites with clays fillers [12].  

 

5.3.2. Overall dielectric response 

The dielectric relaxation results of zeolite [25, 27], as well as PVDF polymer [34, 35] 

have been already studied, however, the molecular motions and structural relaxations in 

the composites have not been reported previously.

the zeolites (?´= 13 at 14 MHz [36, 37]) and the polymer (?´= 7).  This increase of the 

dielectric constant is larger for the highest zeolite content. Figure 5.2 also shows the 

exponential increase of the dielectric constant for temperatures above 60 ºC for both 

pure polymer and composites, indicative of the high temperature conductivity. It is to 

notice the use of different ordinate scales in Figure 5.2 (c).

The imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity (Figure 5.3) allows a more clear 

definition of the different relaxation processes that take place in the composite films. 

PVDF spectrum shows the low-temperature ?-relaxation [34], above -50ºC, related to 

the cooperative segmental motions of the amorphous regions that is associated to the 

glass transition. At temperatures above the main relaxation, ?’’ rapidly increases with

increasing temperature or decreasing frequency, a behavior characteristic of the ohmic 

contribution to permittivity. Nevertheless, the simultaneous increase of ?’ indicates that 

a significant contribution of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) effect must be 

considered in this region. This contribution is related to the accumulation of electric 

charges in the discontinuity surfaces between amorphous and crystalline phases 

producing macroscopic dipoles. The relaxation associated to the molecular motions 

within the crystalline region (that can be detected in dynamic-mechanical experiments 

[16]) of the material should appear at  temperatures above 60ºC, however it cannot be 

seen in the dielectric measurements due to the overlap of the conductivity and 

interfacial polarization phenomena at these temperatures [34, 35]. In the composites 

(Figures 5.3 (b) and (c)), the presence of the zeolite particles add a low-temperature 

relaxation process, appearing between -100 and -50 ºC,  that can be observed in the 

amplification shown in Figure 5.3 (d). We will call it hereafter ? relaxation. The origin 

of the dielectric relaxation process of zeolites has been ascribed to the distribution of 

extra-framework cations and their migration among various available sites of the 

zeolites [24]. In addition, it should be also contributions of water molecules inherent to 

the zeolite filler (for 16% wt of zeolite, the water percentage in the composite is 7%) 

[30, 38]). In this way, considering the relaxation processes of zeolites reported in a 

previous study [27], the relaxation peak represented in Figure 5.3 (b), (c) and (d) is 

assigned to the rotation of water molecules with eventual contributions in the case of the 

composite of encapsulated polar solvent in the sodalite cages and to the movements of 

the Na
+
 ions in the supercages. 

 

Finally, the high temperature side of the dielectric spectrum of the composites is largely 

modified with respect to pure PVDF. The presence of charged particles introduces new 

discontinuity surfaces and thus new contributions to interfacial polarization. The 

detailed analysis of the relaxations will be separated in two sections, one dedicated to 

the low-temperature processes, mainly of dipolar origin, and the other one to the high 

temperature MWS processes.

5.3.3. Low temperature relaxation processes 

A more evident representation of this relaxation zone can be observed in Figure 5.4 in 

which the temperature scale has been expanded in the low-temperature region, showing 

the overlapping of the main relaxation of PVDF and the zeolite ?-relaxation. Figure 5.4 

(a) and (b), in addition to show more clearly the ?-relaxation from -65 to 10 ºC, also 

allows to detect a small relaxation between -85 and -45ºC [39, 40] that is assigned to a 

local mobility of the amorphous phase of the polymer, identified as the ?-relaxation 

[16]. In Figures 5.4 (c) and 5.4 (d) it is confirmed the presence of the zeolite relaxation. 

At 100 Hz, for a temperature of -80ºC, the aforementioned ? relaxation associated to the 

rotational fluctuations of water molecules and movements of the NaY
+
 in the sodalite 

cages is observed and a shift of the relaxation to higher frequencies occurs as the 

temperature increases. The increase of temperature also allows the visualization (Figure 

5.4 (c)) of another relaxation for low frequencies, which is related to a Maxwel-

Wagner-Sillars polarization on the polymer and zeolite interface. The introduction of 

higher zeolite contents (Figure 5.4 (d)) leads to a masking of this relaxation and the ?-

relaxation of PVDF due to conductivity effects.

Dielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  97 

In Figure 5.5 the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity is represented for all the 

samples at 0.1 Hz, 1 KHz and 100 KHz. The appearance of the ? relaxation of the NaY 

zeolite is observed in the composites. At low frequency, the increase of space charge 

phenomena prevents the visualization of the ?-relaxation characteristic of the polymer 

when the zeolite content increases. The increase of frequency reduces this contribution 

and therefore it is possible the visualization of the ?-relaxation even for higher NaY 

zeolite contents. At first sight it seems that the presence of the zeolite particles nearly 

has no effect on the ?-relaxation of PVDF (Figure 5.5). To further characterize this 

issue, the relaxation dynamics was analyzed in the scope of the Vogel-Fulcher-

Tammann (VTF) formalism [41]:

where ? is the relaxation time, VFTHE  is the VFT energy, Bk  is the Boltzmann constant 

and 0T  is the critical temperature at which molecular motions become infinitely slow 

[13-15]. From the obtained VTF fitting parameters for the ?-relaxation it is also possible 

to estimate the fragility parameter [42]:

where m is an indication of the steepness of the variation of the material properties 

(viscosity, relaxation time, …) as Tg is reached. A high m value defines a fragile 

material whereas a strong material is characterized by small m values [43].  

The m (T

transition temperature (T

) where the relaxation time is equal to 100 s.

The ?-relaxation observed for neat PVDF and PVDF/NaY4% composite films could be 

analyzed in this way (Figure 5.6 (a)), however, the masking of this relaxation in the 

PVDF/NaY16% sample due the overlapping of the conductivity contributions prevents 

accurate fitting for this sample. The fitting parameters for the first cited samples are

It is observed that the zeolite content does not significantly affect the segmental motions 

of the polymeric matrix. The presence of the zeolite particles do not restrict the 

cooperative motions of the amorphous polymer chains in spite of the changes induced in 

the crystalline phase of PVDF. The amorphous phase is expected to be situated between 

the crystalline lamellae but it seems that its conformational mobility is not really 

affected by changes in crystal structure.  

 

The same procedure was followed to analyze the influence of the presence of the 

polymer matrix on the zeolite ?-relaxation observed between -100ºC and -40ºC.  The 

Arrhenius diagram corresponding to this relaxation and the VFT fitting parameters 

obtained for PVDF/NaY4% and PVDF/NaY16% composite samples are shown in Figure 

5.6 (b) and Table 5.2, respectively.

The VFT energy values of this relaxation are of the same order of magnitude of the ones 

obtained for the isolated zeolite [25, 44], being this around 0.5 eV. This demonstrates 

that this relaxation is mainly due to the zeolite and it is not a consequence of the

polymer/zeolite interaction. The high values of the VFT energy indicate the movements 

of Na+ ions in the framework zeolites [24]. On the other hand, despite the position of 

the ? relaxation in temperature and frequency axis being similar for the two composites, 

there is a slight change in curvature in the Arrhenius diagram with increasing filler 

content (Figure 5.6 (b)) that is to be ascribed to interactions with the polymer matrix.    

 

5.3.4. High temperature relaxation processes 

Together with the relaxations of dipolar origin that occurs at temperatures in the range 

and below the glass transition of the polymer matrix, the mobility of the space charges 

at higher temperatures contribute to the dielectric relaxation spectrum of the composite. 

Previous studies show that both PVDF and zeolites show ionic conduction and MWS 

processes and new effects arise in the composite due to the formation of new interfaces 

between polymer matrix and the zeolite. The analysis of these processes is favored by 

presenting the relaxation spectrum in the ac conductivity or dielectric modulus 

formalisms.  The conductivity can be calculated from the permittivity through:

The frequency dependence of ?’ for PVDF and composite films with 4 and 16 % of 

zeolites is presented in Figure 5.7 for several temperatures. The conductivity of neat 

PVDF can be divided into two different regimes. The first one, for low frequencies, is 

mainly dominated by the dc conductivity and it is detected by the low-frequency plateau 

shown in the plot. The second regime, for higher frequencies, is characterized by a 

frequency dependent conductivity, what evidences the ac conductivity with MWS 

contributions and dipolar relaxation modes at still higher frequencies. The analysis of 

Figure 5.7 also reveals the effect that zeolite causes on the conductivity of the material. 



Dielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  101 

It can be observed the disappearance of the low-frequency plateau on the plot, since the 

conductivity immediately increases at low values of frequency and a linear behavior is 

observed with the logarithm frequency. This fact reveals that the contribution of NaY 

zeolite is mainly on the ac conductivity. As it will be shown below, the MWS 

contributions becomes predominant on the dc conductivity contribution to permittivity.

The evaluation of the dependence of the conductivity with temperature at different 

frequencies was performed with the help of the Dyre model. This model considers the 

dc conductivity as a thermally activated process, characterized by an apparent activation 

energy lower than that of the ac models. The Dyre model (random free energy barrier 

model or symmetric model) for the ac conduction on disordered solids is given by [45]:

where B is a pre-exponential factor or attempt frequency, Ea the activation energy of the 

process, T is temperature and    is the Boltzmann constant. 

Figure 5.8 represents the logarithm of the conductivity as a function of reciprocal 

temperature at different frequencies for the pure polymer and the composite films with 4

represented in Figure 5.9.

Figure 5.9 Evolution of the activation energy for the different samples, pure PVDF polymer sample and 

polymer/zeolite composites, obtained after fittings with the Dyre model. 

 

The activation energy decreases with increasing frequency for the pure polymer and 

PVDF/NaY4%. The sample of PVDF/NaY16% keeps almost constant values of the 

activation energy independently of the frequency. Furthermore, the introduction of NaY 

strongly reduces the activation energy when compared with the pure polymer and 

decreases for increasing zeolite content due to the presence of the MWS relaxation 

process and electric charge transport [29]. 

 

Pure ohmic contributions, characterized by the rapid increase of ?’’ with decreasing 

frequency according to

 while ?’ is constant, produce in the modulus 

formalism a Debye-like relaxation process whose relaxation time increases with 

increasing dc conductivity. Further, the MWS process is seen both in the permittivity 

and the dielectric modulus formalisms as a narrow relaxation peak, the relaxation time 

scaling with the reciprocal of the sum of the conductivities of the two phases that create 

the interface polarization [24]. 

In the context of ionic conductors, the complex electric modulus is often applied. This 

modulus formalism suppresses the signal intensity associated to the electrode

for the determination of charge carrier parameters such as conductivity relaxation time

?  to the data obtained for the pure polymer and composites is represented in 

Figure 5.10. In the case of PVDF the different isotherms overlap on a single master 

curve in the lower frequency side while the half-width of the peak decreases with 

increasing temperatures due to deviations in the high frequency side of the peak. In 

composites, in addition of the peak observed in PVDF, another peak appears at high 

frequencies.  

 

The electric field relaxation due to motions of charge carriers is generally well 

described by the empirical Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function [49, 50]:

where 
M

?  and ? are the conductivity relaxation time and the Kohlrauch exponent, 

respectively. The smaller the value of ?, the large the deviation of the relaxation with 

respect to a Debye-type relaxation (?=1). 

Values of the Kohlrauch exponential parameter ? of the KWW function were 

approximately estimated by means of [51]:

1 4.1??                                                           (5.9) 

where w  is the peak’s full width at half maximum. 

For the pure polymer (Figure 5.10 (a)), the value of ? is practically constant from 0.57 

at 60ºC to 0.63 at 150ºC and the asymmetric form of the curve plots for different 

temperatures is associated to an also asymmetric distribution of the relaxation times, 

what evidence that the dielectric relaxation process deviates from the pure Debye 

behavior. 

The relaxation peak for the pure polymer (Figure 5.10 (a)) occurs at low frequency.  

This represents the range of frequencies in which charge carriers can move over a long 

distance, i.e., charge carriers can perform successful hopping to a neighboring site [52]. 



Dielectric relaxation, ac conductivity and electric modulus in PVDF/NaY  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  105 

In the composites with 4 % wt of NaY zeolites, the peak at lower frequencies is 

coincident with the one of pure PVDF and the value of the ? parameter is the same that 

was obtained for pure polymer. On the other hand, the peak present at higher 

frequencies represents a new contribution to interfacial polarization arising in the 

interfaces between zeolite particles and polymer matrix. Since the relaxation time of the 

MWS process scales with the reciprocal of conductivity, the higher conductivity of 

zeolites due to cations located in different sites of the framework leads the peak to 

appear at higher frequencies (lower relaxation times) than in pure PVDF.

5.4. Conclusion 

Structural and dielectric properties of PVDF/zeolite composite changes significantly 

with respect to pure PVDF. Good dispersion of NaY zeolite particles was assessed by 

SEM, although some clustering was observed in the composite with the highest 

nanoparticle content. The introduction of the zeolite particles nucleates the 

crystallization of PVDF in the electroactive ? phase and modifies the spherulite size. 

Broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy shows two regions in the relaxation map 

of the composites, the low-temperature one dominated by dipolar relaxations both in 

PVDF and in the zeolite particles, with small influence of one phase on the behavior of 

the other. The high temperature side of the spectrum is dominated by ionic conductivity 

and interfacial polarization. The presence of the zeolite particles introduce new 

discontinuity surfaces and increases the MWS contribution that is predominant at low 

frequencies with respect to ohmic contribution to permittivity as detected in the ac 

conductivity plots while producing a specific MWS relaxation process due to polymer-

zeolite interfaces.

Nucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  113 

6.1. Introduction 

The mixing of polymers and clays has been widely investigated in recent years mainly 

due the mechanical reinforcement effect of the latter. The main goal has been to replace 

traditional fibre reinforced composites due to improved strength and stiffness stability, 

thermal and barrier properties and flame retardant behaviour of the clay composites[1-

3]. One interesting polymer for composites production is poly(vinylidene fluoride), 

PVDF, due to its remarkable electroative properties and therefore its suitability for 

sensor and actuator applications. Furthermore, PVDF films present high flexibility, high 

mechanical resistance, dimensional stability, lightness, moldability, low cost production 

and low mechanical and acoustic impedance [4]. Depending on the processing 

conditions PVDF, with a chemical formula (CH2-CF2)n, can crystallise in at least four 

different phases: ?, ?, ? and ? [5, 6]. The ?-phase, that has an alternating s-trans and s-

gauche C-C bonds, is the most stable when the material is cooled from the melt and 

therefore the most commonly obtained [5]. The ?-phase, with all C-C bonds in the s-

trans conformation (TTTT), is the one that presents the best electroactive piezoelectric 

and pyroelectric properties and is commonly obtained by mechanical stretching of the 

?-phase [7] or by the addition of selected nanoparticles [8, 9]. The ?-phase is, as the ?-

phase, electrically active. However, due the presence of a g-gauche bond every fourth 

repeat units of C-C band (T3GT3  ), this effect if weaker when compared with ?-phase. 

?-phase can be obtained by crystallization from the melt or solution casting at 

temperatures near the melt temperature of the ?-phase. The ? ? solid state phase 

transformation also can occur by annealing at temperatures close to melt temperature 

[10]. 

In the last years, the literature reports some studies where organically modified clays 

show the ability to induce, by melt intercalation or solution casting, the crystallization 

of the electroactive ?-phase of PVDF [11-14] and, in a few studies, the induction of a 

crystalline ?-phase [14, 15].
 

The distribution, intercalation and exfoliation of organically modified silicates prepared 

from Cloisite and Montmorillonite clays has been investigated and it is concluded that 

the trend of PVDF to crystallize in the ?-phase is higher in organically modified clays 

when compared with unmodified clays [11]. In all cases, the full ?-phase crystallization 

is obtained by inclusion of an amount of clay higher than 1.5 wt%.[16]. The full ?-phase 

crystallization of PVDF has also been achieved for lower clay contents, of the order of

0.025 %, by an improved method; however, this method implies a very high 

consumption of material [13]. In general, the toughness of composites, the melting and 

crystallization temperature and also the crystallization rate increases with the 

introduction of nanoparticles and, conversely, the crystallinity of the composites 

decreases [16-18]. 

On the other hand, a few number of more recent studies indicate that the ?-phase of 

PVDF is nucleated in the presence of the organoclays. It was demonstrated that when 

the composite samples are subjected to a slow cooling  from the melt, the presence of 

the organoclays induce the crystallization of a mixture of ?-phase and ?-phase, the ?-

phase being predominant for organoclay concentrations above 1.5 wt% [15]. On the 

other hand, when the sample is subjected to a melt-quenched-annealing process, the 

composites crystallize in a mixture of ?- and ?-crystals [15]. Finally, a recent study 

concluded that though the melt-crystallization at hight supercooling  the ?-phase is also 

obtained for an organoclay content up to 0.1%, in contrast to cold-crystallized samples, 

where organoclays addition results in ?-phase PVDF [14]. 

Some of the results presented in the above mentioned articles are contradictory, which 

result from the confusion generated on the identification of the ?- and ?-phase. Due to 

the s-trans conformation (TTTT) of the ?-phase of PVDF and the (T3GT3  ) 

conformation of the ?-phase of the polymer, their characteristic FTIR bands and X-ray 

diffraction bands typically used for the identification of the phases either coincide or are 

very close to each other, making difficult to distinguish it. Based on literature results, 

the analysis of Table 6.1 allows to precisely identifying the FTIR absorption bands of 

the crystalline phases of PVDF. 

From Table 6.1 it is important to notice that most of the bands typically used for the 

identification of the electroactive ?- and ?-phases of the polymer, in particular those at 

510, 512, 833, 838, 840, 883 and 884 cm
-1

 (shadow in Table 6.1) are actually 

superposition of  ?- and ?-phase absorption bands, when both phases exist. On the other 

hand, just the peaks at 445 and 467 cm
-1

 are characteristic absorption bands of the ?-

phase without superposition with other absorptions and just the absorption bands at 431, 

812 and 1234 cm
-1

 are characteristic of the ?-phase without superposition with 

absorptions from other phases [19-22].  

Further, in the previous articles reporting on the nucleation of the electroactive phase of 

the polymer by clays, the piezoelectric response and optical properties of the material

has never been discussed, which are the key issues for the use of the material in sensor 

and actuator applications.

In the present work, the main problems that exist in the processing of electroactive 

PVDF through the nucleation with clays are addressed. It is shown that it is possible to 

prepare PVDF/clay composite in the ?-phase with low clay contents, without any 

organic treatment and with a low consumption of material. Moreover, the material 

presents increased transmittance in the visible range, making it appropriate for optical 

applications. It is also shown that the material can be poled and the d33 piezoelectric 

coefficient has been measured as a function of the clay and the ?-phase contents. A 

systematic study of the isothermal crystallization kinetics of PVDF with unmodified 

clays with the main goal of elucidating the influence of clay content in the 

crystallization kinetics and therefore in the nucleation of the electroactive ?-phase of 

PVDF was also performed. Finally, it is shown that different clays can be used in order 

to achieve the electroactive polymer phase.

6.2. Experimental 

PVDF/clay composites with an average thickness of 50 µm were prepared by spreading 

a solution of 1.0 g of PVDF powder (Solef 1010) with a suspension of montmorillonite 

K10 (Aldrich) in 4 mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) in a glass slide. Previously, 

the suspension of montmorillonite and DMF was homogenized by placing it in an 

ultrasound bath for 4h before the polymer was added and dissolved with a magnetic 

stirrer. After this process the composite is typically melted at 210ºC and recrystallised to 

room temperature [23]. Since the clay can suffer structural modifications at this 

temperatures [24, 25], six films with a clay concentration of 0.50 wt% were prepared at 

temperatures between 170 ºC and 220 ºC in order to study the effect of the polymer 

melting temperature during composite preparation. The effect of clay concentration on 

the electroactive phase content was further studied in films with 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 

wt% of montmorillonite. The effect of different clay structures was studied by 

incorporating an amount of 0.50 % of kaolinite (from North of Portugal) and laponite 

(Laport Industries Ltd) into the polymer matrix by the same procedure explained 

above.Finally, a systematic study of the isothermal crystallization kinetics of PVDF 

with montmorillonite clay was performed. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using a FEI Nova 200 NanoSEM 

with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV in order to evaluate the morphology and 

microestructure of the clay and the composite. 

The crystalline phase of PVDF on the composites was determined by Fourier 

Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in the ATR mode (Spectrum 100, 

Attenuated Total Reflectance mode) in the range between 650 and 4000 cm
?1

, on 32 

scans. 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in a X’Pert Pro-MPD advanced 

diffractometer equipped with Cu K? radiation operated at 50 kV and 40 mA in order to 

study the polymer phase and clay behaviour. 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed in a Mettler Toledo DSC 823 

apparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10?0.2ºC.min
-1

 in order to 

evaluate the crystalline fraction of the polymer and the influence of the clay on the 

melting behaviour. 



Nucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  117 

In order evaluate the piezoelectric response of the samples, films were first subjected to  

a Corona discharge under previously optimized conditions of 70 ºC of temperature 

inside a home-made chamber under an electric field of 30 kV and a constant current of 

15 µA during 75 minutes. Still under the application of the field, the films were cooled 

down to 30ºC. The piezoelectric d33 response was measured with a Wide Range d33-

meter (Model 8000, APC Int Ltd). 

The complex dielectric constant as a function of frequency was measured between 100 

Hz and 1 MHz with anautomatic Quadtech 1929 Precision LCR meter, after thermal 

deposition of gold electrodes on the sample.  

Measurements of optical transmittance were performed with an optical 

spectrophotometer Shimatzu UV-3101PC in the range of 400 to 700 nm. 

Dynamic mechanical analysis was performed with a DMA 8000 Perkin-Elmer set-up in 

the composites with different clay types and a clay concentration of 0.5 %. The 

measurements were performed at room temperature with a frequency scan from 0.01 to 

10 Hz. 

Crystallization kinetics was studies by polarized optical microscopy (POM). An optical 

microscope with a polarized light (Leica DM 2500M) provided with a Leica DFC-295 

camera was used to obtain images during the crystallization of the composites. In a 

Linkam LTS 350 hot plate, the samples were first melted at 190 ºC in order to remove 

the thermal story of the samples and then were cooled down to different temperatures, at 

a rate of 30 ºC/s. In this way, samples with 0.25% of clays were crystallized at 150, 155 

and 160 ºC and samples with 0.10% and 0.50 % were isothermally crystallized at 160 

ºC. It is to notice that the crystallization temperature is far from the degradation 

temperature of both polymer and fillers. With the aim to simulate the preparation 

conditions of ?-phase films, samples with 0.25% of clay were melted and crystallized 

also isothermally at room temperature after fast cooling from the melt. Crystallization of 

each sample initiates therefore at different times and is from there that crystallization 

time began to be counted.

6.3. Results and Discussion 

 

6.3.1. Effect of the melting temperature  

PVDF films are usually prepared by solution cast and melting at a range of temperatures 

higher than 200ºC [17], which corresponds to the temperature of clays interlayer water 

elimination and therefore a temperature range in which structural modifications can 

occur.[24, 25] Due this fact, it becomes important to study the influence of the melting 

temperature in the final properties of the composites, as the polymer/clay interfacial 

interaction will be modified during the crystallisation of the polymer matrix. 

In order to study this effect, composites of PVDF with 0.5 %wt of montmorillonite were 

melted at different temperatures and cooled to room temperature. Figure 6.1 shows 

FTIR-ATR patterns of the samples prepared after melting at different temperatures.

Figure 6.1 FTIR-ATR spectra of PVDF/clay composite melted at different temperatures 

 

It can be concluded from Figure 6.1 that the melting temperature affects the crystalline

 of the FTIR spectra have been 

identified to correspond to the ?-, ? and ?-phases of the polymer (Table 6.1) [26] and 

can be used for this purpose. 



Nucleation of ?-phase and enhancement of optical transparency in PVDF/clay  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  119 

As previously mentioned, the proximity or even the superposition of FTIR absorption 

bands of the ?- and ?-phase of PVDF led to a large number of contradictions in the 

phase identification of composites. However, the analysis of the FTIR spectra in parallel 

with Table 6.1 and with the support of recent studies [14, 15] allows to conclude that 

composites of PVDF with clays melted at a temperature not exceeding 200ºC fully 

crystallize in the ?-phase. In particular, Figure 6.1 shows a strong decrease of the 764, 

976, 1149 and 1383 cm
-1

 bands, characteristics from the ?-phase with respect to the 

composites prepared after melting at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the peaks 

at 812, 833, 838 and 1234 cm
-1
, characteristics of the ?-phase, suffer a strong increase. 

No representative amount of ?-PVDF is identified in the samples as no characteristic 

peaks identified just with this phase suffer any modification with the processing 

temperature (Table 6.1), as it is proved to occur when this phase is nucleated in other 

clay composites [14, 15]. 

The relative amount ?-phase (F(?)) present in the samples and shown in Table 6.2 was 

calculated applying a previously developed method (equation 6.1) for the quantification 

of the polymer phase content [7, 27, 28], assuming that the crystalline phase content of 

the polymer is either in the ? or ?-phase [20], with no or small traces of ?-phase: 

 

                                      (6.1) 

 

Here, A? and A? represent the absorbencies at 766 and 833 cm

, which correspond to the 

?- and the ?-phase material; K?and K?are the absorption coefficients at the respective 

wave numbers and X? and X? the degree of crystallinity of each phase. The value of K? is 

0.365 and the value of K? is 0.150 µm
-1 

[20].
 

When the melting of the composite occurs at temperatures above 210ºC, the polymer 

recrystallizes in the ?-phase and this tendency increases for higher temperatures. On the 

other hand, when the material is melted at temperatures below 200ºC, it tends to 

crystallize in the ?-phase (Table 6.2). It should be stressed that this fact does not occur 

in the absence of the clays, when the polymer always crystallises in the ?-phase 

independently of the previous melting temperature of the material.

The nucleation of the electroactive ?-phase is due to an interaction between the 

negatively charged delaminated clays and the dipolar moments of the PVDF. This ion-

dipole interaction tends to order the PVDF monomers in a preferentially  trans 

conformation inducing therefore the crystallization of the ?- or ?-phases [15]. The 

stabilization of either ? or ?-phase is not understood and depends on factors such as 

cooling rate and surface modification of the clays [14, 15]. 

On the other hand, by increasing meting temperature, the reduction of the interlayer 

spacing of the clays at temperatures above 200 ºC due the elimination of interlayer 

water [25] prevents the exfoliation of montmorillonite which in turn reduces the contact 

area between the negatively charged delaminated clays and the dipolar moments of 

PVDF, preventing its crystallization of the electroactive phases. The interlayer water 

elimination and the collapse of the interlayer distance is confirmed by the disappearance 

of the d(001) diffraction peak [29], attributed to the interlayer distance, at 2? ~ 9º, in the 

XRD patterns for samples prepared at temperatures above the 200ºC (Figure 6.2 (a)) 

and (b)), inset).

On the other hand, as observed in Figure 6.3, the montmorillonite microstructure 

changes for the different composite prepared after melting at different temperatures. For 

the samples prepared at lower temperatures (Figure 6.3 (a) and (b)), platelets of some 

nanometric layers are well separated one another and dispersed in different directions 

along the continuous polymer matrix. In this situation, there is a larger interaction area 

between these clay platelets of montmorillonite and the polymer (Figure 6.3(b)), the 

polymer microstructure growing from the clay layers. On the other hand, when the 

polymer is melted at temperatures above 200ºC, the clays create larger micrometer size 

clusters due to the interlayer structural variations. This fact reduces the interaction area 

between the clays and the polymer matrix and do not promote the crystallization of the 

electroactive phase. 

The composites in the ?- and ?-phases show also different optical transmittance to the 

visible light. Measurements of optical transmittance are presented in Figure 6.4, 

demonstrating that for melting temperatures equal or less than 200 ºC the transmittance 

in the visible region of the composite is much higher than for the melting temperatures 

above it. This fact is attributed to the variations of the clay microstructure and its 

dispersion in the polymer matrix, as well as its influence, as it will be shown later, on 

the degree of crystallinity of the polymer. As observed in Figure 6.3, for processing 

temperatures below 200 ºC the dispersion of the clays is better achieved, as well as the 

wetting by the polymer. Further, the clay is dispersed in the form of small platelets of 

some clay nanometric layers. These factors imply a better optical transmittance than the 

larger clay grains not so well dispersed and with worst interaction with the polymer 

matrix obtained for the samples melted at higher temperatures, that create defective 

microstructure e.g. voids and cracks (Figure 6.3 (c) and (d)).

Figure 6.4 Optical transmittance in the visible range of PVDF/ montmorillonite composites after 

processing at different melting temperatures. 

 

Figure 6.4 also shows that the transmittance of the films is higher as the melting 

temperature approaches 200ºC. Thus, it seems to be an ideal melting temperature for 

obtaining highly transparent piezoelectric composites.  

 

 

6.3.2. Functionally graded electroactive composites  

The relationship between the processing temperature and the polymer phase after 

recrystalisation allows the production of samples with different electroactive phase 

content and transmittance along the films, with potential application as functionally 

graded materials in electrical, optical and electrooptical areas [30, 31]. This effect can 

be achieved by exposing different parts of the film to different temperatures. In this 

way, a film of 14 cm was exposed to a temperature gradient from ~210 to 180 ºC along 

its length and the optical transmittance and phase content were determined at different 

points 2 cm apart along the film (the points were numbered 1 to 6, from the higher to 

the lower temperature side). The results are presented in Figure 6.5.

6.3.3. Effect of the clay content 

The effect of relative amount of clay in the electroactive phase content of the composite 

was evaluated by preparing samples with 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 %wt of montmorillonite 

within the polymer matrix and by melting the composites at 200ºC. FTIR results reveal 

that the ?-phase content is also dependent on the clay content (Figure 6.6).

The introduction of  0.10 wt% of montmorillonite does not affect the crystalline phase 

of the polymer, crystallizing mainly in the nonelectroactive ?-phase. However, when 

0.25 wt% of montmorillonite is introduced there is a decrease of the 764, 976, 1149 and 

1383 cm
-1

 peaks, characteristics of the ?-phase and a corresponding appearance of the 

812, 833-838 and 1234 cm
-1

 peaks, assigned to the ?-phase [7]. The increase of 

montmorillonite concentration induces even further the nucleation of the ?-phase. For a 

percentage of 0.50 wt%, the ?-phase completely disappears and the ?-phase is further 

enhanced, at a maximum value of ~ 90%. Table 6.4 also shows the degree of 

crystallinity of the polymer composites as measured by DSC (Figure 6.7) and calculated 

by Equation 6.2: 

 

    
   

     
                                                           (6.2) 

 

where     represents the melting enthalpy of the composite and       (taken as 104,6 

J/g) [20] is the melting enthalpy for a 100% crystalline sample of pure PVDF. 

It is observed that the degree of crystallinity is affected by the amount of clay present in 

the composite. The composite shows a decrease of the degree of crystallinity when the 

clay, for small clay concentrations, acts as a defect in the polymer structure, with no 

capability of nucleation of the electroactive phase. Further, by increasing clay content 

the clay seeds act as nucleating agents of the ?-phase and the degree of crystallinity 

increases.

The aforementioned behaviour is supported by the shape of the DSC scans (Figure 6.7) 

obtained for the first heating runs obtained for composites with different amount of 

montmorillonite. The samples with 0.10 %wt of clay maintain the melting peak at the 

same temperature as the ?-phase of PVDF, with a shoulder associated to the presence of 

defects in the films due to the introduction of clays. As the amount of clay is increased, 

the melting peak is shifted to higher temperatures. When the clay reaches a 0.50%wt 

concentration, the peak is at 178ºC what corresponds to the melting of the ?-phase 

crystals [10].
 

 

Finally, the crystallization of the samples in the ?-phase is further demonstrated by their 

piezoelectric d33 response (Table 6.4). It is noteworthy to mention that the piezoelectric 

coefficients, despite being lower than for the ?-phase of the polymer, they are still 

among the largest obtained for polymers, are in the range suitable for application and 

are obtained avoiding the stretching process necessary to prepare ?-PVDF, which 

hinders many applications involving microfabrications techniques [32].
 
The lower 

piezoelectric response of ?-PVDF with respect to ?-PVDF mainly relies in the different 

chain conformations, with more dipolar moments for unit cell contributing to the 

electroactive response in the all-trans chain conformation of ?-PVDF. Finally, there is 

also a contribution of the microstructure to the reduction of the electroactive response: 

in the present case, films crystallize in a spherulitic microstructure with random 

orientation of the polymer chains, conversely to the stretched films that show 

preferential chain and crystallite orientation [33]. Finally, the values for the real and 

imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are similar to the ones obtained for ?-PVDF 

[5] (Table 6.4). 

 

6.3.4. Effect of the different clays 

In order to further evaluate the origin of the crystallization of the ?-phase of PVDF by 

clays, composites of clays with different structures were prepared for a given clay 

content: montmorillonite, laponite and kaolinite. Montmorillonite is an expanding clay 

with a structure type of 2:1. When exfoliated, it creates plates with a thickness of 1 nm 

and a diameter ranging from 50 to 500 nm. Laponite has the same 2:1 clay structure 



Chapter 6 

128 Ana Catarina Lopes 

type of montmorillonite, but it shows mesoporosity resulting from interparticle 

aggregates and can create platelets of 1nm of thickness but with a smaller diameter than 

monmorillonite (~30 nm) [34]. Kaolinite present a 1:1 clay structure type, it has a basal 

spacing fixed at 0.72 nm and, unlike the aforementioned clays, is unable to absorb water 

into the interlayer position. All the samples were prepared by solvent cast at a 

concentration of 0.5 %wt and melted at 200ºC. The results obtained by FTIR are 

presented in Figure 6.8.

Figure 6.8 a) FTIR-ATR spectra of composites of PVDF with 0.5%wt of montmorillonite, laponite and 

kaolinite clays and b) the corresponding optical transmittance spectra in the visible region. 

Figure 6.8 (a) shows that the ?-phase content is more pronounced in montmorillonite 

samples, followed by laponite and finally by kaolinite. The piezoelectric ?-phase 

content, as calculated by equation 6.1, for the different clays are 96 % for 

montmorillonite samples, 80 % for laponite samples and finally 73 % for kaolinite 

composites. The evolution of the phase content for the different clays can be explained 

by the expanding effect observed in the two first clays that is not observed in kaolinite. 

The interparticle aggregates observed on laponite also difficult, on the other hand, its 

exfoliation and is responsible for the lower ?-phase content when compared with the 

montmorillonite. As on the case of montmorillonite, the melting of these composite 

samples at temperatures above 200ºC, prevents the crystallization of the ?-phase. Figure 

6.8 (b) shows the transmittance of the different samples, which also increases for these 

clays with respect to pure PVDF. The highest transmittance is obtained for the 

composite with laponite, followed by montmorillonite and kaolinite. These results can 

be related to the different degree of crystallinity of the polymer within the composites, 

i.e., the higher the degree of crystallinity of the composites, the higher is the 

transmittance. This fact is confirmed by the degree of crystallinity obtained by DSC: 

(a) (b)

laponite, the clay giving origin to the most transparent composite, is also the one with 

the highest degree of crystallinity (59%), followed by montmorillonite (51%) and 

kaolinite (46%). 

The different interaction between the clays and the polymer matrix, leading to the 

different electroactive phase content and transparency is also supported by the 

dynamical mechanical measurements  performed for the three types of composites with 

0.5% of clay. The results are represented in Figure 6.9. The higher elastic modulus is 

observed for composites when prepared with montmorillonite and laponite, but a lower 

elastic modulus than PVDF is observed when the kaolinite is present. This fact can be 

explained by the larger expanding effect observed on montmorillonite and laponite, that 

allows larger interaction areas between the polymer and the layers of the clays and 

prevents the composite deformation. On the other hand, the kaolinite is not an 

expanding clay so, the contact area between this clay and the polymer is smaller, 

representing therefore a defect that acts as a rupture zone and facilitates the 

deformation.

6.3.5. Spherulite growth andCrystallization kinetics 

Spherulite growth 

In order to study the influence of clays in the kinetic of isothermal crystallization of 

composite, a systematic study have been performed. 

The morphology of crystallization was observed by POM and analyzed by considering 

the spherulite growth as a function of the time at various crystallization temperatures. 

The images of the composites with 0.25% of Montmorillonite (PVDF/MMT0.25%) 

crystallized at 160 ºC during different crystallization times are shown in Figure 6.10. 

   

Figure 6.10 Images of the spherulitic growth for the PVDF/MMT0.25% samples crystallized at 160 ºC at 

different crystallization times: 32 s (a), 98 s (b) and 152 s (c). 

Figure 6.10 shows, as expected, that the spherulite size increases with increasing time. 

On initial time (Figure 6.10 (a)), it is observed that the spherulites are similar in size 

and, prior to impinging upon one another, they appear circular, indicating a spherical 

isotropic three dimensional shape [35]. It is also observed multiple crystallization 

nuclei. For intermediate times (Figure 6.10 (b)), spherulites are fairly big and perfectly 

growth with the Maltese-cross clearly observed, indicating the polymer crystallization 

in the ?-phase of PVDF [14, 36]. On the other hand, it can be observed that some fillers 

are pushed away by spherulites as these growth. Furthermore, comparing the three 

pictures of Figure 6.10 (b), it is confirmed that the size of the spherulites increases with 

time and that the number of spherulites does not vary significantly over time.

Figure 6.11 Images of the spherulitic growth for PVDF/MMT composites at 92 s crystallization time at 

160 ºC with MMT wt% of 0.10 (a), 0.25 (b) and 0.50 (c). 

 

Figure 6.11 shows the spherulite microstructure as a function of MMT concentration 

after 92 s crystallization time for semi crystalline PVDF with MMT loadings of 0.10%, 

0.25% and 0.50% (Figure 6.11 (a) to (c)) crystallized at 160ºC. All the samples show 

spherulites with a compact and well-defined microstructure and the Maltese-cross 

texture typical of ?-PVDF [23]. The samples with 0.50 % clay content are the ones with 

the largest number of spherulites, while the samples with 0.10% and 0.25% clay content 

show nearly the same number of spherulites. The increase of crystallization nucleus 

with increasing clay content can be attributed to crystallization around the clay surface, 

the filler acting as nucleation agents. 

The results of Figures 6.10 and 6.11 evidence the influence of the present of clays and 

the clay content in the polymer crystallization. It is further important to evaluate the 

effect of crystallization temperature for a given filler content. Figure 6.12 shows the 

images of PVDF/MMT0.25% after complete isothermal crystallization at the temperatures 

of 160 ºC, 155 ºC, 150 ºC and room temperature. It is observed that decreasing 

crystallization temperature increases the number of crystallization sites of the PVDF 

polymer similarly to the neat PVDF polymer [37]. As demonstrated by Figure 6.12, the 

presence of MMT leads increasing PVDF nucleation sites and and crystallization.

The spherulites therefore become smaller with decreasing crystallization temperature, 

loosing also the definition of their borders. On the other hand, the characteristic 

Maltese-cross is also not observed. 

POM pictures of PVDF/MMTroom temperature at different times during the crystallization 

process are represented on Figure 6.13. A much faster spherulite growth with a higher 

number of spherulites is observed when compared to the previously described 

crystallization situations. Not only the number of spherulites, but also the spherulite 

type is different, as they show an irregular shape with no clear-cut boundary and with 

the absence of the Maltese-cross and birefringence. The full crystallization occurs in 

less than 5 seconds. It is to notice that after these conditions the ?-phase of PVDF is 

obtained, as concluded above.

As a conclusion, the addition of MMT fillers increases the number of spherulites, but 

the spherulite size decreases with increasing MMT concentration for a given 

crystallization time and temperature when compared with pristine PVDF [23]. These 

facts confirm that the MMT fillers act as heterogeneous nucleation agents. 

The crystallization behavior was quantified by determining the spherulitic growth rates 

by measuring the radius of the spherulites as a function of time at the different 

crystallization temperatures. Typical relationships of spherulite radius versus time at 

different crystallization temperatures for the PVDF/MMT0.25% composite are illustrated 

in Figure 6.14. The radius of the spherulites increases linearly with time and the 

crystallization rate decreases with increasing crystallization temperature. As on neat 

PVDF [23], the total crystallization is faster achieved for lower crystallization 

temperatures. In Figure 6.14, for the lowest isothermal crystallization temperature, 

T=150 ºC, the spherulite size is small and the crystallization behavior is faster. For 

highest crystallization temperatures, 160 ºC, the crystallization is slower and the 

spherulite size is larger.

growth of the ? phase spherulites lower. The introduction of clays in PVDF leads to a 

significant reduction of spherulitic growth rate, which is similar for the different clay 

contents. It can be interpreted thus, that the crystallization process is shifted to lower 

kinetics. This fact is not fully responsible for the nucleation of the ?-phase of PVDF as 

?-PVDF is obtained when the samples crystallize isothermally close to the melting 

temperature (Figures 6.10 to 6.12), but favors the formation of the ?-phase of PVDF at 

lower temperature crystallization or under non-isothermal crystallization conditions 

processing conditions.

Figure 6.15 Spherulitic growth of ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF and composites with 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 % of MMT 

fillers with a crystallization temperature of 160 ºC. 

 

For same crystallization temperature (T=160ºC), it is thus evident that the interfacial 

interaction between MMT fillers and PVDF is responsible for the differences in growth 

rate observed in Figures 6.14 and 6.15. This result is related to the higher number of 

nucleus found in the PVDF/MMT composites (Figure 6.11). 

Keeping all other parameters unchanged, a higher number of nuclei implies smaller 

spherulites [38]. The appearance of germ nuclei in the polymer system is governed by 

primary nucleation phenomena and after the primary nuclei is established the spherulite 

growth rate is determined by surface nucleation and subsequent crystal growth [39].

Crystallization kinetics 

The overall isothermal crystallization kinetics of polymers is determined by the 

nucleation rate and growth rates [40] and is commonly analyzed within the Avrami 

theory, as represented by equation 6.3 [40-42]: 

)exp(1
n

t
KtX ???                                           (6.3) 

Here, n  is a constant that depends on the type of nucleation and growth, its value ranges 

between 1 and 4 and is related to the different crystallization mechanisms [40, 41]. K  is 

the crystallization rate constant involving both nucleation and growth rate parameters 

under isothermal conditions. tX  and t  are the relative crystallinity and the 

crystallization time, respectively. 

From images similar to the ones presented in Figures 6.10 or 6.11 obtained by POM at 

regular time intervals during the crystallization process, the time, t , evolution of the 

crystallized fraction ? ?tX  of the material was calculated from the evolution of

where the numerator represents the crystallized area at a given time and the 

denominator is the total area of the fully crystallized material [37].  

In Figure 6.16 are represented the relative crystallinity determined by equation 6.4 as a 

function of time for PVDF and PVDF/MMT0.25% crystallized at different temperatures. 

All curves show the typical sigmoidal shape of the isothermal crystallization behavior 

[23]. Furthermore, the initial slope decreases with increasing crystallization temperature 

independently of the presence of MMT fillers in PVDF, indicating a progressively 

slower crystallization rate.

Figure 6.16 Crystallization isotherms for different crystallization temperature of ??PVDF and 

PVDF/MMT composites with 0.25 % MMT filler content. 

Figure 6.16 shows that the characteristic sigmoid isotherms shift to the right (higher 

times) with increasing isothermal crystallization temperature, which is in agreement 

with the results of Figure 6.14. The comparison between neat PVDF and the composites 

show that the introduction of clays induces a faster increase of the relative crystallinity, 

despite the slower grow rate of the spherulites shown in Figure 6.15, which is the 

ascribed to the larger number of growing sperulites, i.e, to the nucleation effect of the 

filler. 

The relative crystallinity as a function of time for PVDF/MMT samples with different 

filler concentrations crystallized at T=160 ºC is represented in Figure 6.17. The 

characteristic sigmoid isotherms are observed for all composites, with no significant 

variation between the samples with 0.10% and 0.25% clay content. However, when the 

clay content increases to 0.50%, the relative crystallization is faster. Despite the 

spherulitic grow rate being similar for all the composites with different clay content 

(Figure 6.15), the presence of a larger amount of clay induces a higher number of 

nucleation points, accelerating therefore the total crystallization of the sample. 

These facts confirm that MMT fillers in the PVDF matrix act as nucleating agent 

increasing the number of growing spherulites while leading a slower spherulite growth, 

more similar to the one of the ?-phase growth rate (Figure 6.15).

Each of the curves in Figure 6.18 shows an initial linear portion and then a subsequent 

trend to level off. This deviation is to be attributed to the secondary crystallization 

caused by the spherulite impingement [44], i.e, the crystallization of interfibrillar 

polymer structures, which have been rejected and trapped between growing spherulites.

In table 6.5, the n  values for neat PVDF range from 2.36 to 2.60 and those for 

PVDF/MMT0.25% from 2.04 to 2.64 at different crystallization temperatures, indicating 

three-dimensional growth by a thermal nucleation mechanism during primary 

crystallization [39]. 

For the same crystallization temperature (T=160ºC), the   value decreases with 

increasing of MMT filler concentration, indicating that the MMT filler acts as 

nucleation agents during primary crystallization process. 

The values of the crystallization rate constant, K , for all samples decrease with 

increasing crystallization temperature. The incorporation of MMT fillers significantly 

increased the crystallization rate constant, K , confirming that MMT fillers act as 

nucleating agents and overcoming therefore the effect of slower spherulite growth 

(Figure 6.15) due to confined growth geometry and clay-polymer interactions due to the 

presence of the fillers. 

The higher rate of crystallization of the PVDF with MMT fillers is observed through the 

lower values of 
2

1
t . This fact have been also observed in PVDF/ferrite nanoparticles 

composites, in which also nucleation of one of the electroactive phases of the polymer 

occur [37].  

The activation energy of the crystallization process can be obtained by applying the 

Arrhenius equation to the overall crystallization rate constant, K , which contains 

contributions from both nucleation and growth rate:

The activation energy for ?-PVDF and PVDF/MMT0.25% is 524 and 546 kJ/mol, 

respectively. The value of the crystallization activation energy is in the same order of 

previous investigations [47] and combine results of the above two competing effects of 

nucleation and restriction of the movement of polymer chains [48]. 

Figure 6.19 represent the schematic illustration of a possible mechanism of the initial 

spherulite growth for the PVDF/MMT systems adapted from [49].

The MMT fillers influence the nucleation of the spherulites and its growth, which also 

depend on crystallization temperature. The large surface area of MMT filler decreases 

overall crystallization time of the PVDF polymer due to the increase of the nucleation 

efficiency of the filler, but also decreases spherulite growth rate. For lower MMT 

concentration, the larger number of nucleus is due of the exfoliation of the MMT fillers. 

 

 

Figure 6.19 Schematic illustration of spherulite growth for PVDF/MMT composites for low MMT 

contents. Adapted from [49] 

 

For PVDF/MMT composites crystallized at temperatures higher than 155 °C, the 

material crystallizes in a co-existence of ?- and ?-crystalline phases. With incorporation 

of MMT fillers in PVDF matrix, it is observed a lowering of spherulitic growth rate, 

characteristics of ?-phase. Therefore it is observed that the ?-spherulites grown directly 

from the melt correlating the presence of the MMT fillers with the nucleation of the ?-

phase of the polymer [50, 51]. Therefore, the slowing of the spherulitic growth rate due 

to the presence of the clays and determined by the clay-polymer interactions, is 

responsible by the promotion of the ? crystalline phase of PVDF in the composites.

6.4. Conclusion 

This work shows that electroactive PVDF composites can be directly obtained through 

suitable doping with clays by a processing technique that allows easy integration in 

microtechnological processes. The obtained electroactive phase is the polymer ?-phase 

with a d33 of -7 pC/N. Further, clay content improves very significantly the optical 

transparency in the visible range. This results also shows that functional graded 

electrical and optical properties can be obtained along the polymer length. Finally, the 

slowing of the spherulitic growth rate by the presence of the clays, determined through 

the clay-polymer interaction is also responsible for the promotion of the ?-crystalline 

phase of PVDF in the composites.

Polymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  147 

7.1. Introduction 

The development of PVDF/aluminosilicate composites with high dielectric constant 

and/or conductivity [1-3], high transparency and piezoelectric response [4], that can be 

controlled by the variation of type, size, shape [2] and amount of aluminosilicates, result 

in the possibility of applications as micromechanical systems fabrication as well as in 

the development of sensors and actuators [4]. 

Further, based on the materials developed in this work, applications in different areas 

have emerged. That is the case of the development of PVDF/aluminosilicates 

composites for the use as battery separator membranes and for biomedical applications. 

For these applications was further important to control the microstructure of the 

composite, either by achieving porous structures of by preparing microfiber membranes. 

In a similar way some membranes were obtained from a co-polymer from PVDF, in 

particular poly(vinylidene fluoride-Trifluoroethylene), P(VDF-TrFE), due to its specific 

pore architecture

7.2. PVDF/aluminosilicate composites used as battery 

separator membranes 

The lithium battery industry represents the largest segment of the industry of portable 

batteries for computers, cell phones and cameras. However these batteries still have 

some aspects to improve, in particular related to the high reactivity of the lithium with 

the components of the electrolyte. One solution to this problem could be the use of 

polymer electrolytes. 

PVDF-TrFE/NaY zeolites porous membranes with different zeolite contents were 

prepared for lithium ion battery applications [6]. The zeolite inclusion changes the pore 

size, porosity and uptake of membranes and the tortuosity decreases with increasing 

zeolite content indicating that ionic transport is now supported by a better pore 

connectivity. The membranes are thermally stable above 100 ºC and the inclusion of the 

fillers improves the mechanical strength of the membranes. In addition, the zeolite 

particles form a conducting pathway in the polymeric matrix for high zeolite contents, 

improving the ionic conductivity of the porous membranes, which reaches a maximum 

value of 2.33*10
-6

 S/cm at room temperature for the P(VDF-TrFE) membrane with 16 

wt%  zeolite content. The overall stability of the porous membrane determined by cyclic 

voltammetry is appropriate for the intended applications with no electrochemical 

oxidation occurring at potentials lower than 3.0 V. These results shows that the P(VDF-

TrFE)/NaY porous membranes have adequate electrochemical stability, thermal, 

mechanical and electrical properties for being used as  battery separators in lithium ion 

batteries [7].Similar results were obtained for P(VDF-TrFE)/Montmorillonite clay 

porous membranes [8]

7.3. PVDF/aluminosilicate composites used for 

biomedical applications 

Novel materials are continuously developed with the objective of being used in 

biomedical applications. Among these, polymer based materials have confirmed to be a 

good biomaterials choice in tissue engineering applications, smart prostheses and 

sensors and controlled drug delivery, among others [9, 10]. In particular the inclusion of 

zeolites allows increasing functional properties and controlled drug release [11]. 

 

7.3.1. Cell growth membrane 

The potential of electroactive polymers has been recognized for biomedical 

applications. Due to its ability to convert mechanical, thermal or magnetic signals into 

electrical ones, electroactive polymers can be used as smart scaffolds to stimulate cell 

growth and compatibility [12]. Once fillers introduction into the polymer matrix can 

modify biomaterial-cell interaction and/or create novel bioactivity or even suppression 

of biocompatibility [13, 14], composites based on poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, 

have been evaluated with respect to their biological response. Cell viability and 

proliferation were performed in vitro both with Mesenchymal Stem Cells differentiated 

to osteoblasts and Human Fibroblast Foreskin [15]. In-vivo tests were also performed 

using six week-old C57Bl/6 mice. It was concluded that zeolite and clay composites are 

biocompatible materials promoting cell response and not showing in vivo pro-

inflammatory effects, which renders both of them attractive for biological applications 

and tissue engineering, opening interesting perspectives to development of scaffolds 

from these composites[15].

incorporation upon incubation with different neat polymer or composites: ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF/CoFe2O4 (40 

wt%), ?-PVDF, ?-PVDF/(PbZr0,53Ti0,47)O3 (10 wt%), ?-PVDF/NaY (32 wt%), ?-PVDF/CNT (5 wt%), ?-

PVDF/Agnanoparticles (0.005 and 0.020 wt%) and ?-PVDF/MMT (4 wt%) 



Polymer/aluminosilicate composites based applications  

 Ana Catarina Lopes  151 

On the other hand, cell/biomaterial surface interactions, influenced by surface chemistry 

and topology, has become increasingly important in the development of new scaffolds 

for a variety of biomedical applications [16, 17]. One of the most efficient ways to 

increase the surface area of composites consist on the production of microfibers by 

electrospinning [18]. This technique consists on the application of a high electric 

voltage to a droplet of polymeric solution between the needle and the ground 

collector.In vitro assays with PVDF and PVDF composite films and fibers where 

performed to test the viability of the attached MC3T3-E1 cells [19]. The results shows 

that for the first 72 h the PVDF samples do not inhibit the cells adhesion and promote 

cell proliferation [19]. So, these PVDF composite renders attractive for biological and 

biomedical applications, such as drug delivery [20, 21], cell culture [22, 23] and 

antibacterial agent [24, 25], among others.

7.3.2. Controlled drug release 

P(VDF-TrFE)/zeolite composites show interesting features for drug delivery 

applications due to the different microstructures and phases of the polymer, its 

biocompatibility and chemical stability, together with the induced activity of the zeolite, 

[5, 7, 15]. A drug release system for ibuprofen based on macroporous poly(vinylidene 

fluoride-trifuoroethylene)/zeolite membranes produced by isothermal crystallization 

from solution in N,N-dimethylformamide was prepared. Pore architecture, consisting in 

interconnected spherical pores, is obtained in which surface the zeolite are placed. The 

release rate of the drug is dependent on the zeolite content, being slower as higher is the 

zeolite percentage on membrane. For all the cases the release rate decreases with time.

Conclusions and future work 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  159 

8.1. Conclusions 

Electroactive polymer composites are extensively developed in order to approach 

materials properties to specific applications. This work was devoted to the development 

of poly(vinylidene fluorite)/aluminosilicate composites due to the strong electroactivity 

of the polymer matrix, being the main representative of the family of polymers with the 

largest piezo- and ferroelectric response, and to the versatility of the aluminoslicate 

fillers, allowing suitable modifications in shape, size and Si/Al ratio, among others, for 

achieving specific applications demands. 

In this way, PVDF/zeolite composites were successfully prepared by solvent casting 

and melt crystallization. A study of the structural, thermal and electrical properties of 

the PVDF composites prepared with different framework zeolite types (LTL, LTA, 

FAU and MFI), different polymer solvents (DMF, DMSO, TEP) and different zeolite 

(NaY) concentrations (4, 16, 24 and 32 wt.%) was performed.  

A good distribution of the fillers was obtained in all films that maintain the spherulitic 

structure of neat PVDF as well as its mechanical properties. Further, the degradation 

temperature of PVDF is not significantly affected by the inclusion of the fillers It was 

verified that zeolite introduction affects the electrical properties of the polymer and the 

polymer phase crystallization. The presence of ions stabilizing the zeolite structure 

causes an increase of the dielectric response of the composite due to its confined 

mobility into the zeolites cavities and to interfacial effects associated to Maxwell-

Wagner-Sillers polarization. These ions are also responsible for the presence of non-

linear I-V curves where two regimes are identified separated by a break voltage at 

which a strong increase of the electrical conductivity takes place. Zeolites structures 

with lower Si/Al ratios are associated to higher number of ions, resulting in a higher 

dielectric and electrical response.  

The dielectric relaxation of the composites shows a low temperature region dominated 

by dipolar relaxations of the PVDF and relaxations ascribed to the zeolites, while the 

high temperature side of the spectrum is dominated by ionic conductivity. The presence 

of zeolite particles induces new discontinuity surfaces and increases the Maxwell-

Wagner-Sillers contribution. 

Zeolites with low Si/Al ratios show the ability to completely nucleate the electroactive 

phase of the polymer due to strong electrostatic interactions related to the cation

content. A filler content of 16 wt.% is enough to obtain the complete nucleation of the 

?-phase of PVDF. A similar effect occurs with montmorillonite clay introduction but 

just 0.50 wt.% clay content is enough to completely crystallize the polymer in the 

electroactive ?-phase. The study was completed with kaolinite and laponite clays.  

The negatively charged delaminated clays and zeolite structures interact with the dipolar 

moments of PVDF polymer. This ion-dipole interaction induces the arrangement of the 

PVDF monomers in a preferentially trans conformation that result in the ?-phase 

conformation. This effect is limited to preparation conditions including polymer melting 

temperatures below 200 ºC. Further, the optical transmittance of the PVDF/clay 

composites in the visible spectral region is higher than for the neat polymer. In this way, 

the control of temperature throughout the sample allows the production of graded 

electroactive and optical composites. The crystallization rate of the polymer decreases 

with the present of the clay. This fact, ascribed to the strong interfacial electrostatic 

interactions is also related to the crystallization of PVDF in the electroactive ?-phase. 

Furthermore, these composites have been also produced in the form of porous and 

fibrous membranes which extends the application range of the developed materials. 

Finally, the developed polymer based composites have been applied in the areas of 

battery membranes and biomedical applications and present high potential for the 

development of sensors and actuators. 

  



Conclusions and future work 

 Ana Catarina Lopes  161 

8.2. Future work 

PVDF/zeolite and PVDF/clay composites revealed to be promising materials for 

technological applications. In this way, it is interesting to study their upscale production 

in order to obtain similar electrical and optical properties by, e.g., extrusion processes, 

avoiding the use of solvents. 

In a similar way, the upscaling of the porous membranes has to be studied.  

Further investigation has to be devoted to the effect of the variation of the ion type used 

to stabilize the zeolite/clay in the electrical and optical properties of the composites. 

Finally, molecules can be encapsulated in the  zeolite pores to further tailor composite 

response to specific applications. 

Finally, materials can be readily used for the development of environmental and bio 

sensors that have to be fully characterize with respect to their performance.
