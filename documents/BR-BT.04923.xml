Abstract
This study investigates the influence of ethanol (C2H5OH) on the auto-ignition behavior of a standard gasoline fuel. The base fuel was a mixture of hydrocarbons, or naphthas normally used for blending a gasoline: catalytically cracked naphtha, straight-run naphtha, reformates and alkylates, so that many different classes of hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes and also a significant amount of toluene as an aromatic compound, were present in the fuel. Two approaches were taken to assess the influence of ethanol doping on this fuel's auto-ignition behavior) Ignition delay times of mixtures of stoichiometric fuel/ethanol blends with air were measured in a rapid compression machine (RCM), in a temperature range between 700K a 1.000K and a pressure range between 10 e 15bar. Multiple measurements were performed for different levels of ethanol doping. Numerical auto-ignition simulations based on a homogeneous reactor model with detailed chemical kinetics, were performed. The experimental data was compared to the simulation results. The results showed that, while the measured and computed ignition delay times consistently show a systematic deviation (experimental delay times are slower than simulations), the simulations qualitatively predict the experimentally observed effects of ethanol doping. These effects included a retarding effect on auto-ignition at lower temperatures, which became less pronounced at higher temperature ranges (900K-1.000K). Also, in a temperature range (650K-830K) the base fuel displayed almost no change of ignition delay with temperature; this range vanished when ethanol was added to the fuel. The observations indicate that, while the base fuel behavior is not entirely described quantitatively by the mechanism used in the simulations, the ethanol-induced modification of ignition behavior relative to the base fuel is well defined.

Resumo
Este estudo investiga a influência do etanol (C2H5OH) no comportamento da autoignição em um combustível de gasolina padrão. O combustível básico era uma mistura de hidrocarbonetos, ou naftas, normalmente utilizados na mistura da gasolina: nafta cataliticamente craqueada, nafta de destilação direta, reformada e alquilada, de modo que várias classes de hidrocarbonetos (alcanos, cicloalcanos e também uma quantidade significativa de tolueno como um composto aromático, estiveram presentes no combustível. Duas abordagens foram realizadas para avaliar a influência de dosagem do álcool no comportamento da autoignição deste combustível). Os tempos de atraso da ignição em misturas de combustível estequio-métrica e etanol, misturados com o ar, foram medidos em uma máquina de compressão rápida (MCR), em uma faixa de temperatura entre 700K a 1.000K e uma faixa de pressão entre 10 e 15bar. Várias medições foram realizadas para níveis de dosagem diferentes de etanol. Simulações numéricas de autoignição baseadas em um modelo de reator homogêneo com cinética química detalhada, foram executados. Os dados experimentais foram comparados com os resultados das simulações. Embora os resultados mostrem que os tempos de atraso da ignição, tanto medidos como simulados, mostraram, consistentemente, um desvio sistemático (os tempos de atraso experimentais são mais lentos do que as simulações), as simulações qualitativamente preveem os efeitos experimentalmente observados de dosagem de etanol. Esses efeitos incluíram um efeito de retardamento da autoignição em temperaturas mais baixas e que se tornou menos pronunciada com uma escala de temperatura maior (900K-1.000K). Além disso, em uma escala de temperatura (650K-830K) o combustível de base exibiu quase nenhuma mudança de atraso da ignição com a temperatura, este intervalo desapareceu quando o etanol foi adicionado ao combustível. As observações indicam que, embora o comportamento do combustível de base não esteja totalmente descrito quantitativamente pelo mecanismo utilizado nas simulações, a modificação de comportamento da ignição induzida pelo etanol em relação ao combustível de base está bem definida.

Resumen
Este estudio investiga la influencia del etanol (C2H5OH) en el comportamiento de la auto-ignición de un estandard de combustibles para gasolina. El combustible de base era una mezcla de hidrocarburos o naftas, utilizados normalmente en la mezcla de la gasolina: nafta craqueada catalíticamente, nafta de primera destilación, reformada y alquilada, por lo que las diferentes clases de hidrocarburos (alcanos, ciclo-alcanos y también una importante cantidad de tolueno como un compuesto aromático, estuvieron presentes en el combustible. Dos métodos fueron realizados para evaluar la influencia de la dosis de alcohol en el comportamiento de la auto-ignición del combustible) los tiempos de atrasos de ignición en una mezcla estequiométrica de combustible y etanol mezclado con el aire, se midieron en una máquina de compresión rápida (MCR) en un rango de temperatura de 700K a 1.000K y una presión entre 10 e 15bar 10 y 15bar. Se realizaron diversas mediciones de los niveles de dosis diferentes de etanol. Las simulaciones numéricas de la auto-ignición sobre la base de un modelo de reactor homogéneo con la cinética química detallada, fueron realizados. Los datos experimentales se comparan con los resultados de las simulaciones. Aunque los resultados demuestran que los tiempos de atrasos de ignición cuanto las medidas y simulados, mostraron un desvío consistente (los tiempos de atrasos experimentales son más lentos que el de simulaciones), las simulaciones cualitativamente predicen los efectos observados experimentalmente de la dosis de etanol. Estos efectos incluyen otro efecto de demora en la auto-ignición de las temperaturas más bajas y fueron menos fuertes con un rango de temperatura más alta (900K-1.000K). Por otra parte, en una gama de temperatura (650K-830K) el combustible de base mostró casi ningún cambio en el atraso de la ignición con la temperatura, este rango desapareció cuando se anadió
etanol al combustible. Las observaciones indican que aunque el comportamiento del combustible de base no está plenamente descrito cuantitativamente por el mecanismo utilizado en las simulaciones, la modificación de la conducta de ignición inducida por el etanol en el combustible de base está bien definida.

Introduction
Two important long-term trends in engine technology are clearly identifiable today: the quest for lighter, smaller gasoline engines with ever increasing power density, and the urge to use new fuel types in these engines, especially, either entirely or partially bio-mass based fuels. However, the high pressure and temperature levels in these engines tend to favor self-ignition and its associated phenomena like engine knock and premature combustion. Consequently, questions of fuel auto-ignition characteristics, especially those doped with novel, bio-mass based components become important.
The new engine development and the identification and use of new fuel sources can be improved and rendered more efficient if simulation tools are available. These allow the behavior of engines operating on a given fuel type to be predicted. The availability of predictive tools helps to shorten development times of new engines or fuel concepts, supports the identification and evaluation of possible new engine concepts and can improve the potential of existing concepts.
The basis of a systematic prediction of fuel auto-ignition and combustion behavior is a detailed reaction mechanism which contemplates all the chemical reactions that can occur in a fuel/oxidizer mixture. Furthermore, it must consider the numerical parameters that describe the velocity of these reactions as a function of temperature and pressure.
For many "conventionally" used fuels or fuel components (e.g., alkanes, mixtures of alkanes, toluene, alcohols and ethers), such mechanisms are readily available. Experimental data are also available that allow the validity of these mechanisms to be check, at least within certain ranges of temperature, pressure and stoichiometry. Review articles by Simmie (2003) and, more recently, by Barrin-Leclerc (2008) give an overview of the available mechanisms and their range of applicability.
However, the existing mechanisms typically have been designed only for pure components, and not for mixtures of various components. This can be critical, since cross-reactions between different fuel components or their decomposition products can heavily influence the fuel's auto-ignition behavior. Such cross reactions are, however, not included in mechanisms designed to describe only one component. Recently, systematic research has been directed towards developing mechanisms for multi-component fuels, especially fuels including bio-mass based components like ethanol and MTBE (Ogura et al., 2007) mainly because of their octane-number enhancing effect (Curran et al., 1996) Mechanisms for pure ethanol have also been published, e.g., (Marinov et al., 1999). For existing mechanisms to apply to complex fuel mixtures, they have to be extended, and their new performance validated against experimental data. This validation is mostly based on auto-ignition delay times. Experimental methods to characterize autoignition behavior include shock tubes (Fieweger et al., 1997), Rapid Compression Machines (RCMs) (Würmel etal., 2007), (Affleck et al., 1968) and flow reactors (Dagaut et al., 1996).
Various groups of RCMs have been used to investigate the self-ignition behavior of fuel/air mixtures and several fuels have already been studied in this way. However, for many years most studies investigated one-component fuels only or simple mixtures of isooctane, n-heptane (primary reference fuels, PRF).
This study measured and made numerical simulations to develop and test a chemical reaction mechanism to describe blends of a "standard" fossil fuel with ethanol. A rapid compression machine (RCM) was used to determine ignition delay times of fuel blends doped with varying amounts of ethanol.
Experimental data of different naphtas are presented, the estimation procedure for the interaction factors is discussed
and calculated versus experimental data are shown. The investigation was based on numerical simulations of auto-ignition in conjunction with experiments in a rapid compression machine. The methodology used the simulations to investigate how added ethanol affected the base fuel auto-ignition behavior. Experiments in parallel to the simulations checked the trends predicted by the simulations in some representative conditions (pressure and temperature). In condition ranges where the simulations agreed with the experiment, the simulated chemical reaction mechanism can be regarded as valid; in other ranges, improvements were made to the reaction mechanisms.
Experiment and computations
Experimental setup and procedure
Experiments to measure ignition delay times of ethanol/ fuel mixtures used the Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) facility at the Institut für Technische Thermodynamik (ITT).
The facility (sketched in figure 1) features an apparatus for the rapid, near adiabatic compression of a fuel/air premixture under well-defined conditions. The compression is performed in an engine-like cylinder-piston arrangement: the fuel/air mixture is trapped in a cylinder at well-defined initial conditions (temperature, pressure and chemical conditions), and then the piston is driven into the cylinder, thereby compressing the gas volume in a near-adiabatic fashion.
However, when reaching top dead center, the piston is blocked from performing any further motion by a dedicated lever. This machine simulates one single engine compression stroke with far better controlled conditions than in a real engine.

As table 1 indicates, the machine compression times are quite short, so the compression process itself is nearly adiabatic. After compression, however, considerable heat loss from the hot gas to the colder cylinder walls will occur. The machine is equipped with a piezo-electric pressure transducer (Kistler 6061B) that records the transient pressure trace in the machine. The whole apparatus is held at a constant, adjustable temperature by a thermostat. A large container acts as a fuel reservoir in which the desired fuel/air mixture is prepared and stored for later use. At each RCM "shot", the RCM-cylinder is first evacuated to a sub 4mbar pressure; then, the desired amount (pressure) of fuel/air mixture is admitted into the cylinder through a magnetic valve. The pre-compression pressure is recorded by a precise pressure manometer (MKS baratron). During the actual compression, the gauge is protected from exceedingly high pressures by a cut-off valve. The machine also records the transient piston motion during the compression. The pressure and piston motion data of each test are digitized and stored on a computer, along with data describing the "shot" initial and boundary conditions (initial volume, temperature, pressure and chemical composition) for further analysis.
Data evaluation
In figure 2, a typical RCM compression process is shown as a time history of the in-cylinder pressure and volume. Initially, at t = 0, the piston is at bottom dead centre, with a large volume and low pressure. Near 0.04s, the compression starts and the volume gradually decreases until, around 0.05s, top dead centre is reached, the piston is blocked and the volume remains constant. The compression also increases the gas temperature, even if no reaction of the fuel/air mixture is yet present. After compression has finished, the pressure first decreases slightly due to heat loss. After 0.115s, the pressure suddenly increases very rapidly; this is due the cylinder load undergoing combustion. The time between the end of the compression and the beginning of the combustion is due to the ignition delay of the fuel/air mixture.

From the pressure curve recorded in a rapid compression experiment, an ignition delay time tign can be derived as the time span between the start of the combustion-induced pressure rise (labeled "t" in Figure 3) and the end of the compression (t ). This ignition delay time has to be attributed to a certain temperature and pressure at which the ignition occurs. As Figure 3 shows, the pressure, and therefore also the temperature, in the RCM combustion chamber vary considerably during the ignition process.
There are several ways to assign a pressure to the ignition event. The pressure right after compression (pmax) could be chosen. However, this pressure is valid only for a short time span immediately after the compression, when chemical reactions are just about to commence or have not yet started at all. Therefore it hardly represents the conditions during the actual ignition process. A more representative pressure is the so-called "effective" pressure peff, which can be defined by

This definition takes into account that the chemical reaction occurs some time after the end of compression, and therefore "feels" the lower, post-compression pressure, which is peff on average.
Another choice is to use the chamber pressure pend immediately before the combustion-induced pressure rise. This choice is based on the notion that the ignition delay time in an unstable varying pressure and temperature system is determined mainly by the low-pressure / low-temperature period. This is shown in figure 4, where the figure 2 process is depicted in a 1.000k/i, pressure diagram. The diagram features iso-lines (broken, labeled lines) of computed ignition delay time (represented by the decadic logarithm of tign/s) as a
function of pressure and temperature. The black curve shows the post-compression phase of figure 2. Immediately after compression (corresponding to 0s in the time scale in figure 4, there are relatively high temperatures (1.000k/T«1.1) and pressures (p«15bar), with a corresponding small ignition delay time of about 10’1-7s=0.02s. Then, the pressure and the temperature decay (due to heat losses to the cylinder walls), and the system moves to the lower-right direction in the diagram. Immediately before the final, combustion-induced pressure rise (0.065s after end of compression), a state with a longer ignition delay of about 0.06s is reached. The time scale in the diagram shows that, although the ignition process starts in conditions with an ignition delay time of about 0.02s (10-1.7s), the pre-combustion reactions occur in more than 70% of the total time in low-temperature, low-pressure regions where the ignition delay time equals or exceeds 0.05s, i.e., more than twice the initial value.

The black, solid curve shows the post-compression RCM process of Figure 2, with the time scale starting at the end of compression (corresponding to Os), and ending immediately before the onset of combustion after 0.065s.

Based on this observation, pend and the corresponding temperature Tend were used in this work. The latter was calculated from the measured pressure pend using the isentropic relation for an ideal gas
where p1, T1 are the initial pressure and temperature, resp., before the compression, cp is the (temperature and composition-dependent) specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and R is the (composition-dependent) specific gas constant.
Numerical simulations
Numerical simulations of auto-ignition in gasoline/etha-nol mixtures were performed with a homogeneous reactor model. The simulation starts at defined initial conditions (pressure p, temperature T, chemical composition x). Then, the system develops under the influence of chemical reactions in an isobaric, adiabatic system, undergoing ignition, and finally combustion. The governing equations used in the simulations are given in Maas etal. (1988). The chemical source term evaluation was based on a detailed reaction mechanism, composed of 9.300 elementary reaction steps of ~1.100 species. This mechanism is based on the primary reference fuel (PRF) mechanism of Westbrook etal. (2002), with additional reactions included to describe the influence of toluene (a major component of the base fuel) (Andrae et al., 2007).

A series of simulations was performed, with the initial conditions (pressure, temperature and chemical composition) set according to the experiments. Ignition delay times were extracted from the simulated time-histories of the species CO, which is formed in the late ignition-pre-combustion phase. The location with the steepest slope of the CO(t) curve is searched, and then the intersection of the local tangent to this curve with the time axis is used as the ignition delay time. The mixture specified in table was used as the base fuel.
Results
Numerical results
The Arrhenius diagram figure 5 shows the computed ignition delay times of stoichiometric fuel/ethanol/air mixtures at 12bar as a function of temperature. The curves are for various volume ethanol fractions in the fuel mixture, as indicated by the curve labels. The value 1 corresponds to pure ethanol, and 0 to pure base fuel. While the base fuel features a nonlinear relation between inverse temperature and ignition delay, pure ethanol shows a nearly linear behavior. For temperatures below about 950K, the addition of ethanol generally increases the ignition delay time. Above this temperature, the converse effect is observed, with ethanol slightly accelerating ignition; however, this effect is much weaker than the deceleration at lower temperatures. In the temperature range (between 900 and 1.000K), ethanol addition has only a very weak effect on auto-ignition delay. Figure 6 shows ignition delay times as a function of the ethanol mass fraction in the fuel, for various temperatures. Ignition delay is a slightly nonlinear function of the ethanol volume fraction. It is, again, seen how the effect of ethanol addition varies with temperature: for the studied base fuel, ethanol addition significantly decelerates ignition below about 900K, behaves nearly neutral between about 900K and 1.000K and slightly accelerates ignition above 1.000K.
Comparison of experimental and simulated ignition delay times
As an important step towards extending the mechanism to also include cross reactions between the base fuel components (especially, the olefins, aromatics and alcohol), com
puted ignition delay times are compared to ignition delay times measured in the RCM. Special attention is needed to check the ability of the mechanism to predict the influence of ethanol on the ignition delay.
In figure 7, simulated and experimental ignition delays of stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures are plotted vs. temperature in an Arrhenius-diagram. Data are shown for pure base fuel (green lines and circles for simulation/experiment, respectively), and for a mixture of base fuel and 20 vol% ethanol (black line/symbols). All simulated data are for 12bar, and the experimental data were collected from a pressure range between 10bar and 14bar.
For the pure base fuel, the simulations show a slight ignition delay flattening in temperatures below about 830K. The measured data display slightly larger ignition delays than the simulated data; however, they follow the same trend of a very weak dependence of ignition delay below 800K. The slight discrepancy in the ignition delay absolute values is not surprising as the base fuel is already a quite complex mixture of various classes of hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, olefines, arenes). While the mechanism contains reactions including each base fuel compound as species, it is not possible to also include all cross reactions between these compounds. This is subject of future work.
For the longer ignition delay times (those more than 0.2 s), the assumption of an isentropic system (used to compute the temperature TenA from pressure pend) will become less fulfilled due to the gas heat loss to the cylinder walls.
The data comparison for the base fuel/ethanol mixture shows that here too the simulated ignition delays are consistently smaller than the measured delays. However, the ignition delay increase relative to the pure base fuel is described quite well. The influence of ethanol becomes weaker at higher temperatures (~&gt; 900K). Also, the "flattening" of the ignition delay vs. temperature curve below 830K, clearly identifiable for the pure base fuel in both simulation and experiment, is far less pronounced when ethanol is mixed to the fuel. Another characteristic found in the simulations, namely the increasingly weaker effect of ethanol on ignition delay as higher temperatures (~900K) are approached, is, at least qualitatively, also found in the experimental data.

Conclusions
This work studied the influence of ethanol doping on the ignition delay time of a multi-component gasoline fuel, consisting of alkanes, olefines and aromatic compounds, both numerically and by measurements in a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM).
The simulations used an existing reaction mechanism (Toluene Reference Mechanism, based on the LLNL primary reference fuel mechanism); this mechanism contains the investigated fuels compounds, but is not "tuned" to also include possible cross reactions between the individual fuel compounds. The experimentally observed ignition delay times are consistently somewhat larger than the simulated ignition delays. However reasonable qualitative correlation was found with respect to the ethanol doping effect on ignition delay: For temperatures below 900K, ethanol retards the ignition delay. For temperatures between 900K and 1.000K, the effect of ethanol is much weaker. The simulations furthermore predict that at higher temperatures, ethanol even slightly accelerates ignition. This latter effect has not been checked in experiments, since data for temperatures higher than 1.000K (and ignition delays below about 5ms) are hard to access.

Los puntos son los datos experimentales para las presiones que van desde 10 hasta 14bar; os resultados de la si-mulación se refieren a 12bar.
A temperature range (650K—830K) is found where the base fuel displays almost no change of ignition delay with temperature; this range vanishes when ethanol is added to the fuel. The observations indicate that, while the base fuel behavior is not entirely described quantitatively by the me
chanism used for the simulations, the ethanol-induced modification of ignition behavior relative to the base fuel is described well.
