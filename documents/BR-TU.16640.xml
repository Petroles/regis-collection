ABSTRACT
This paper presents the integration of micropaleontological (palynology and foraminifera) and isotopic 
(87Sr/86Sr) analysis of a selected interval from the well 2-TG-96-RS, drilled on the onshore portion of the 
Pelotas Basin, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. A total of eight samples of the section between 140.20 and 73.50 m in 
depth was selected for palynological analysis, revealing diversified and abundant palynomorph associations. 
Species of spores, pollen grains and dinoflagellate cysts are the most common palynomorphs found. Planktic 
and benthic calcareous foraminifera were recovered from the lowest two levels of the section (140.20 and 
134.30 m). Based on the stratigraphic range of the species of dinoflagellate cysts and sporomorphs, a span 
age from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene is assigned. The relative age obtained from the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in 
shells of calcareous foraminifers indicates a Late Miocene (Messinian) correspondence, corroborating the 
biostratigraphic positioning performed with palynomorphs. Paleoenvironmental interpretations based on the 
quantitative distribution of organic components (palynomorphs, phytoclasts and amorphous organic matter) 
throughout the section and on foraminiferal associations indicate a shallow marine depositional environment 
for the section. Two palynologicals intervals were recognized based on palynofacies analysis, related to 
middle to outer shelf (140.20 to 128.90 m) and inner shelf (115.75 to 73.50 m) conditions.

Key words: Micropaleontology, Biostratigraphy, Neogene, Pelotas Basin.

INTRODUCTION

The Pelotas Basin is situated in the southernmost 
portion of the Brazilian continental margin and was 
developed as a result of the Gondwana break-up, 
which originated the South Atlantic Ocean. The 
stratigraphical evolution of this basin has been 

intensively studied in recent years (Fontana 1990, 
Villwock and Tomazelli 1995, Castillo et al. 2009, 
Contreras et al. 2010, Stica et al. 2014).

Additionally, several paleontological studies 
have been published, mainly focused on taxonomic 
and paleoenvironmental analysis of foraminifera 
(e.g., Closs 1967, 1970, Thiesen 1977) and 
ostracods (e.g., Sanguinetti 1980, Carreño et al.

1997) as well as certain biostratigraphic studies 
based on foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils 
(Gomide 1989, Anjos and Carreño 2004, Coimbra 
et al. 2009, Guerra et al. 2012). Few palynological 
contribuitions have been made in pre-Quaternary 
deposits of this basin (Arai et al. 2006, Premaor 
et al. 2010, Silva et al. 2011, Fischer et al. 2013). 
These papers represent recent investigations from 
subsurface sampling, focusing on age assignments 
and paleoenvironmental analysis. Dinoflagellate 
cysts and spore-pollen taxa are the most common 
palynomorphs recorded by those authors. 
However, a palynostratigraphical framework of 
this basin is still needed.

A general biostratigraphic analysis on the 
Cenozoic strata of the Pelotas Basin was presented 
by Anjos-Zerfass et al. (2008), which also included 
87Sr/86Sr isotopes data, as a tool for chronostra-
tigraphic purposes. The use of a strontium isotopes 
stratigraphic framework is a significant resource 
to calibrate the dates obtained by biostratigraphy, 
improving the integrated stratigraphic framework 
of the basin.

This paper presents the results of high-resolution 
biostratigraphical analysis based on microfossils 
(palynology and foraminifera) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios for 
a Neogene section of this basin, in samples from well 
2-TG-96-RS, drilled by the Companhia de Pesquisa 
de Recursos Minerais (CPRM). Additionally, a 
palynofacies characterization is presented, as a guide 
to the paleoenvironmental interpretations.

GEOLOGICAL AND 

PALEONTOLOGICAL SETTING

GEOLOGY

The Pelotas Basin, located on the South America 
continental margin between 28°40’ S and 34° S (Fig. 
1a, b), is bounded to the North by the Florianópolis 
High in Brazil and to the South by the Polonio 
High in Uruguay (Kowsmann et al. 1974). The 
Florianópolis High, of volcanic origin, is related 
to the South Atlantic superplume, that was active 

during the Cretaceous. The Polonio High is an 
older feature of the Precambrian Uruguayan Shield 
basement. Similar to other Brazilian Eastern 
Margin basins, the Pelotas Basin resulted from the 
Gondwana break-up and South Atlantic opening 
since the Aptian (Ojeda 1981, Asmus and Baisch 
1983, Conceição et al. 1988, Chang et al. 1992, 
Cainelli and Mohriak 1999).

The basin area is approximately 210.000 km2, 
of which 40.000 km2 is onshore. Although the 
entire section includes sedimentary rocks from the 
Aptian to the Holocene, on the onshore portion 
of the basin only deposits of the Quaternary out 
cropping (Fig. 1a, b). The maximum thickness of 
the total sedimentary section reaches 12.000 m 
(Fontana 1994).

Since the opening of the South Atlantic, the 
Pelotas Basin received clastic sedimentation as 
a result of the denudation of adjacent highlands 
(Villwock 1984). Sucessive sea-level cycles 
caused the accumulation of a clastic wedge, which 
was affected only by incipient post-depositional 
deformation, represented by tilted blocks with 
strata dipping seaward (Villwock 1984). In general, 
the entire stratigraphic succession includes a basic 
transgressive and an upper regressive interval, from 
the Aptian to Holocene strata (Bueno et al. 2007).

The studied interval is part of the major 
Paleocene-Holocene regressive supercycle that is 
composed of proximal siltstones and sandstones 
assigned to the Cidreira Formation, as well as 
distal mudstones with some intercalated turbiditic 
sandstones of the Imbé Formation (Dias et al. 
1994, Bueno et al. 2007). The Cidreira Formation 
deposits prograde into the basin, merging with the 
Imbé Formation sediments, which were deposited 
in more distal portions.

PALEONTOLOGY

Contributions derived from benthic foraminifera 
and ostracods of the pre-Quaternary sucession are

interpretations (e.g., Koutsoukos 1982, Carreño et 
al. 1999, Ceolin et al. 2011). Simões et al. (2008) 
presented a taxonomy review of brachiopods 
recorded from some Neogene deposits of the 
onshore portion. Biostratigraphic data is mainly 
obtained through the study of planktic foraminifera 
and calcareous nanofossils (Koutsoukos 1982, 
Gomide 1989, Anjos and Carreño 2004, Coimbra et 
al. 2009). Most biostratigraphic information of the 
Neogene deposits comes from boreholes, drilled in 
the onshore portion of the basin.

Quaternary deposits reveal a varied fossil 
content, including vertebrates and microfossils, 
such as foraminifera, palynomorphs and diatoms 
(e.g., Closs 1970, Lopes et al. 2010, Macedo et al. 
2010, Hermany et al. 2013). Palynological analysis 
has provided paleoclimate interpretations and 
paleoenvironmental reconstructions for Quaternary 
deposits, mainly focusing on the marine influence 
on the coastal plain of the state of Rio Grande do 
Sul (Bauermann et al. 2009).

Palynological studies from the pre-Quaternary 
section (Arai et al. 2006, Premaor et al. 2010, Silva 
et al. 2011, Fischer et al. 2013) represent a new 
stage of systematic work developed in recent years. 
Palynological associations of Late Cretaceous 
(Arai et al. 2006, Premaor et al. 2010), Paleogene 
(Fischer et al. 2013) and Miocene/Pleistocene 
(Silva et al. 2011) ages were presented. Abundant 
and diversified assemblages of spore-pollen taxa 
and dinoflagellate cysts, in addition to foraminiferal 
linings, scolecodonts, and algae species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The well 2-TG-96-RS was drilled by the CPRM 
on the onshore portion of the Pelotas Basin 
(29°46’12”S/50°05’02”W) (Fig. 1a, b). The 
sedimentary section related to the sampled interval 
(73.50 to 140.20 m of depth) consists of 66.7 m of 
mudstones, with intercalations of siltstones rich in 
pelecypods fragments (Ostrea sp. and Anomalocardia 
spp.) (Fig. 1c). Eight samples were collected from 

this interval (Fig. 1c), from which palynological 
data were derived. Foraminiferal specimens were 
only recovered from two basal levels (134.30 m and 
140.20 m). 87Sr/86Sr isotope data was obtained from 
benthic foraminifera shells recorded at 134.30 m of 
depth (Fig. 1c).

PALYNOLOGY

Palynological samples were prepared at the 
Laboratório de Palinologia “Marleni Marques-Toigo”, 
Departamento de Paleontologia e Estratigrafia in the 
Instituto de Geociências at Universidade Federal do 
Rio Grande do Sul (LPMMT/IG/UFRGS), following 
the conventional method for pre-Quaternary ma-
terial described by Wood et al. (1996), employing 
hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. Final residues 
were obtainned by sieving; from wich slides were 
mounted using the fraction between 20 and 250 
µm. Fucsina pigment was added to some residues 
to facilitate taxonomic identification. A total of 
56 slides was prepared, which are stored in the 
LPMMT/IG/UFRGS collection under the code 
“MP-P” (Fig. 1d). Taxonomical analyses was per-
formed using an microscope Olympus BX-61, with 
phase contrast and fluorescence light (mercury).

Quantitative data and the ensuing palynofacies 
analysis were obtained by counting at least 400 
particles from each sample which enabled the 
generation of graphs exhibiting variation in 
composition of particulate organic matter along the 
studied section. Quantitative results were processed 
with Tilia and Tiliagraph softwares (Grimm 1987, 
1990). All organic particles were identified and 
classified in the following categories: continental 
palynomorphs (pteridophyte and bryophyte spores, 
gymnosperm pollen, angiosperm pollen, fungi, 
freshwater algae) and marine (dinoflagellate cysts, 
foraminiferal linings); phytoclasts (opaque and 
translucent phytoclasts, cuticles) and amorphous 
organic matter. The cuticles are represented 
separately within the translucent phytoclasts due to 
their abundance in certain levels.

FORAMINIFERA AND STRONTIUM RATIO (87Sr/86Sr)

An aliquot of 60 g of sediments per sample was 
prepa red following the conventional micropale-
ontological techniques for calcareous microfossils 
(Thomas and Murney 1985). Foraminiferal shells 
from 125 and 250 µm were hand-picked under an 
Olympus SZ1145 stereomicroscope. Taxonomic 
determinations were also supported by employing 
a scanning electronic microscope JEOL JSM 5800 
at the Centro de Microscopia Eletrônica - UFRGS.

Well-preserved specimens of the benthic fora-
minifera species Nonionella atlantica, Nonionoides 
grateloupii and Hanzawaia boueana from two 
samples (134.30 m and 140.20 m) were separated 
and ultrasonically cleaned with ultrapure water 
(Milli-Q) to remove particles adhered to the shells. 
Strontium ratio (87Sr/86Sr) analyses were performed 
using these selected foraminifera, at the Laboratório 
de Geologia Isotópica (IG/UFRGS). Isotopic ratios 
were measured in static mode with a VG Sector 54 
multi-collector mass spectrometer. An average of 
120 ratios was collected with a 1-volt 88Sr beam. 
Strontium ratios were normalized to 87Sr/86Sr = 
0.1194. Measurements are considered for the NBS-
987 standard 87Sr/86Sr = 0.710250 ± 0.000007. The 
standard curve used for the age assessment was 
derived from the database compiled by McArthur 
et al. (2001) and McArthur and Howarth (2004).

RESULTS

MICROPALEONTOLOGICAL CONTENT

Most of the samples presented palynological 
associations composed mainly of dinoflagellate 
cysts and foraminiferal linnings. Twelve species of 
dinoflagellate cyst belonging to seven genera were 
identified, as well as eight species of pteridophyte 
spores, twelve taxa of gymnosperm and angiosperm 
pollen grains, besides specimens assigned to 
fungi, acritarch, green algae, foraminifera linings 
and scolecodonts. The taxonomic list and the 
stratigraphical distribution of palynomorphs and 
foraminifera (benthic and planktic) are presented 
in Table I and Figure 2. Selected taxa of 
palynomorphs are illustrated in Figure 3.

The amorphous organic matter dominated the 
palynological assemblages, whereas phytoclasts 
and palynomorphs were subordinate, but phyto-
clasts is very well represented at all levels (Fig. 4). 
Terrestrial palynomorphs represented by spores and 
pollen grans were present in all levels, varying from 
5% to 40% of the total assemblage. Well preserved 
angiosperm pollen grains comprise specimens 
of Chenopodiaceae, Compositae, Asteraceae 
and Onagraceae. Gymnosperm pollen grains 
reached a maximum of 40%, while dinoflagellate 
cysts reached up 45% of the assemblage. The 
latter were mainly represented by species of

Selenopemphix, Tuberculodinium, Lejeunecysta 
and Trinovantedinum. Unidentified spiral forms 
of foraminiferal linings reached up 25% of the 
association (Fig. 4).

Planktic foraminifera were recorded in only 
one sample, at the base of the studied section 
(140.20 m), where eight species were identified: 
Globigerina apertura, Globigerina bulloides, 
Globigerina falconensis, Globigerinoides trilobus, 
Globigerinoides immaturus, Globigerinoides 
sacculifer, Globigerinoides obliquus and Orbulina 
suturalis. Benthic foraminifera specimens were 
recorded in two levels (134.30 m and 140.20 m), 
and are represented by 20 species, belonging to 
17 genera (Fig. 2). Specimens of foraminifera are 
illustred in Figure 5.

Counting of benthic foramifera specimens by 
families (Cassidulinidae, Cibicididae, Elphidiidae, 
Eponididae, Gavelinellidae, Hauerinidae, Nonionidae, 
Polymorphinidae and Vaginulinidae), revealed two 
dis tinct intervals. The basal sample (140.20 m) was 
charac terized by a high proportion of specimens of two 
families: Cibicididae (33.70%) and Gavellinielidae 
(32.30%). All other families presented low number of 
specimens at the 134.30 m sample (Fig. 6a).

Most of the foraminifera shells from well 2-TG-
96-RS were affected by partial dissolution. As a 
result, only one sample (at 134.30 m) contained well 
preserved specimens suitable for 87Sr/86Sr analysis. 
The age assignment obtained from this sample 
indicates an age of 6.05 Ma, that corresponds to the 
Late Miocene (Messinian) (Fig. 6b).

DISCUSSION

BIOSTRATIGRAPHY

The age of the studied section was mainly based 
on the previously known stratigraphic ranges of 
palynomorphs and planktic foraminifera (Fig. 
7 and 8). Ranges of dinoflagellate cysts were 
compiled from Head (1993), Williams et al. 
(2004), Powell and Brinkhuis (2004) and in the 
computer data base TAXON (R.L. Ravn, personal 

communication 2003). Stratigraphical distribution 
of terrestrial palynomorphs was derived from Regali 
et al. (1974a, b), Lima and Angulo (1990), Pinto 
and Regali (1990) and Garcia et al. (2008) (Fig. 7), 
while those used for planktonic foraminifera were 
based on Kennett and Srinivasan (1983) and Bolli 
and Saunders (1985) (Fig. 8); geochronology was 
calibrated according to Gradstein et al. (2012).

According to Williams et al. (2004), in the 
Northern hemisphere the first appearance of 
Trinovantedinium glorianum (Fig. 3j) (134.30 m and 
128.90 m) occurs at the top of the Serravalian stage 
(Middle/Late Miocene), whereas Selenopemphix 
armageddonensis (Fig. 3h) (140.20 m-128.90 m) 
is known from Late Miocene (Fig. 7). Quadrina ? 
condita (Fig. 3g) (140.20 m, 134.30 and 128.90 m) 
has been recorded from Middle to Late Miocene 
(Kurita and Obuse 2003) and Capillicysta fusca (Fig. 
3k) (128.90 and 113.60 m) has its last occurrence 
(LO) in the Early Pliocene (Head 1993) (Fig. 7).

The species of sporomorphs Cyatheacidites 
annulatus, Multiareolites formosus and 
Retistephanocolpites gracilis were used in the 
zonal scheme established for the Meso- and 
Cenozoic Brazilian basins (Regali et al. 1974a, b). 
M. formosus (Fig. 3e) (128.90 m) presents its LO 
in the Late Miocene, and has been recognized in 
Miocene deposits throughout the Brazilian margin 
(Regali et al. 1974a, b) (Fig. 7). C. annulatus 
(Fig. 3c) (113.60 m) has been used as a marker 
in the Brazilian marginal and interior basin for 
the interval between the Early Miocene and the 
Pliocene (Regali et al. 1974a, b, Lima and Angulo 
1990, Pinto and Regali 1990, Garcia et al. 2008); 
(Fig. 7). R. gracilis was recovered from deposits 
dated from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene (Fig. 
3d) (113.60 m and 73.50 m) (Regali et al. 1974a, b, 
Lima and Angulo 1990, Garcia et al. 2008) (Fig. 7).

The palynological content of samples collected 
between 140.20 m and 128.90 m indicated a 
Late Miocene age, due to the occurrence of the 
dinoflagellate cysts species T. glorianum and

S. armageddonensis and Q. ? condita (acritarch). 
This assignment is reinforced by the occurence 
of pollen grains attributed to M. formosus (Fig. 
7). The simultaneous records of C. annulatus and 
R. gracilis, associated with the LO of C. fusca at 
113.60 m, indicate that the samples between 115.75 
and 73.50 m are related to the Early Pliocene 
(Fig. 7). Based on this evidence, the samples 
analyzed from the well 2-TG-96-RS are considered 
to be from the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene in 
age (Fig. 6b and 8).

Based on the zonal schemes of Kennett and 
Srinivasan (1983) and Bolli and Saunders (1985), 
planktonic foraminifera recovered from the well 
2-TG-96-RS indicates an age range from the Late 
Miocene to Early Pliocene, taking into account 
the concurrent presence of Globoturborotalita 
apertura (Fig. 5a, b) (Zone N16-N21 of Blow 
1969) and Globigerinoides obliquus (Fig. 5g, 

h) (Zone N8 – N19 of Blow 1969) (Fig. 8). 
According to Chaisson and Pearson (1997), G. 
apertura ranges from 11.19 to 1.64 Ma (Zone N14 
to lower Zone N22).

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATION

The paleoenvironmental interpretation of the 
studied interval is based on the integration of 
lithological and micropaleontological data, 
especially particulate organic matter (Fig. 4). 
The presence of foraminifera only in the lowest 
section indicates a shallowing a the environment. 
However, the continuous presence of pelecypods 
(Fig. 1c) and dinoflagellate cysts in the entire 
interval studied herein, indicates marine conditions 
throughout the study interval.

The section was subdivided into two intervals 
mainly based on the ratio between marine

and continental elements (sporomorphs), which 
shows inversely proportional distributions (Fig. 4). 
Counting was carried out to identify the organic 
matter compositional trend for each sample, changes 
in the relative abundance of certain particulate 
organic matter and palynomorph groups are linked 
to sea-level changes.

INTERVAL 1 (140.20 m–128.90 m) – LATE MIOCENE

In this interval (four samples), marine palynomorphs 
occur in high proportions (Fig. 4). Dinofl agellate 
cysts are dominant, up to 60% of the assemblage (at 
137.90 m). The percentage of this group decreases 
downward but maintains a frequency close to 35% 
(Fig. 4). Foraminiferal linings present peaks of 
abundance at 137.90 m (15%) and 128.90 m (25%).

Spores represent 20% of the palynomorphs 
assemblages at 140.20 m, and about 15% at 137.90 
m, 128.90 m and 134.30 m (Fig. 4). Gymnosperms 
pollen grains are absent in the basal sample, but occur 
in all overlying levels, varying from 5% to 20% 
of relative frequency (Fig. 4). Angiosperm pollen 
and fungal elements rarely occur, representing &amp;lt;
15% of the palynomorphs assemblage at 140.20 
m. Fresh water algae (Botryococcus) is very rare 
throughout the section, presenting less than 5% of 
the assemblage (Fig. 4).

Translucent phytoclasts occur only in the 
sample at 128.90 m (40%), including cuticles which 
have frequency from 5% to 15% upward in the 
section (Fig. 4). Opaque phytoclasts and amorphous 
organic matter are the predominant constituents of 
the particulate organic matter. Opaque phytoclasts 
are the most abundant particulate organic matter of 
terrestrial origin, while cuticles, spores, pollen and 
fungi occur subordinately (Fig. 4).

The abundance of partially degraded woody 
tissue (opaque phytoclast, translucent phytoclast 
and cuticles), which dominate the particulate 
organic matter, indicates fresh water input. Spores, 
pollen (angiosperm and gymnosperm) and fungal 
elements occur with low relative abundance

and diversity. Furthermore, these elements are 
generally poorly preserved, limiting a satisfactory 
taxonomic assess. Poor preservation and the 
low abundance of the terrestrial palynomorphs 
indicate a long distance between the depositional 
site and the source area.

The predominance of marine palynomorphs 
(dinofl agellate cysts and foraminiferal linings) 
and the high percentage of amorphous organic 
matter denote a marine depositional environment 
for this interval. Among the dinofl agellate cysts, 
predominance of gonyaulacoid forms (e.g., 
Nematosphaeropsis) suggests neritic environments 
(Edwards and Andrle 1992, Matsuoka 1992).

The benthic foraminifera assemblage is 
typical of nearshore environments (Yassini 
and Jones 1995, Scott et al. 2001). Most of the 
identifi ed species are commonly found in recent 
coastal environments of the Brazilian margin 

(e.g., Closs and Barberena 1962, Semensatto-Jr 
and Dias-Brito 2004, Vilela et al. 2004, Burone 
and Pires-Vanin 2006). However, the presence of 
deeper dwelling forms such as the Cassidulina and 
Globocassidulina, together with the planktonic 
foraminifera probably indicates middle to outer 
neritic environments.

INTERVAL 2 (115.75 m–73.50m) – EARLY PLIOCENE

This interval comprise four samples and is charac-
terized by an increase in continental particulate 
organic matter. Terrestrial palynomorphs consist 
mainly of bisaccate pollen (Podocarpaceae), which 
make up about 40% of sporomorphs in most samples. 
Angiosperm pollen grains belong to the families 
Asteraceae, Chenopodiaceae and Aquifoliaceae. 
Terrestrial palynomorphs are more frequent in this 
interval than in the underlying one. Spores present 
percentages between 9% and 40%, angiosperm

pollen 5%, gymnosperm pollen between 15% and 
40% and fungi between 15% and 35%.

Dinoflagellate cysts represent from 5% to 25% 
of total palynomorphs, and are mainly composed 
of Lejeunecysta, Selenopemphix, Tuberculodinium 
and Polykrikos, which characterize an inner neritic 
environment (Wrenn and Kokinos 1986, Stover et 
al. 1996). Foraminiferal linings are locally recorded 
(&amp;lt;5% at 113.60 m) (Fig. 4).

All the samples in this section present high 
percentages of opaque phytoclasts and amorphous 
organic matter. Translucent phytoclasts (30% - 45%) 
and cuticle (15% - 60%) are very well represented 
(Fig. 4). The high frequencies of well preserved 
translucent phytoclasts including cuticles indicate 
short distance and non-turbulent transport from 
the continental source. The increase of continental 
palynomorphs is indicative of a strong fresh water 
input, probably in response to coastline progradation.

Reworked palynomorphs of Paleozoic 
and Mezosoic ages were assigned to genera 
Lunatisporites sp. (137.90 m), Vittatina sp. (78.00 
m), Vittatina subsaccata Samoilovich 1963 (134.30 
m), Limitisporites rectus Leschik 1956 (113.60 m) 
and Murospora florida (Balme) Pocock 1961 (115.75 
m, 113.60 m, 73.50 m). The latter is known from 
Upper Jurassic to Early Cretaceous deposits (Pocock 
1961 and Burger 1996). All other specimens are very 
common in Gondwana Basins Permian deposits. 
With respect to the ocurences in Brazil, the pollen 
grains are recorded from Permiam biozones of the 
Paraná Basin (Souza and Marques-Toigo 2005). The 
occurrence of the Lunatisporites sp., Vittatina sp., 
Vittatina subsaccata, Limitisporites rectus suggest 
that the Paraná Basin Permian strata served as a 
source for the analyzed sediments.

The absence of foraminifera in the upper part of 
the section can be related to an upward shallowing 
in the section. On the other hand, the location of 
the well 2-TG-96-RS leads to the assumption that 
the complete dissolution of calcareous bioclasts is 
due to rain water infiltration. According to Morad 

et al. (2000), widespread areas of the continental 
shelf can be exposed by regressive events and, as 
a result, an increase in the recharging zones can 
occur and provide the input of precipitation.

CONCLUSIONS

This study presents biostratigraphic and paleo-
environmental interpretations based on Miocene 
and Pliocene palynomorph and foraminiferal 
associations from well samples. Additionally, 
an age assignment based on strontium isotopes 
(87Sr/86Sr) is presented. This data constitutes an 
integrated approach to study the Neogene deposits 
in the Pelotas Basin.

The palynological associations, recovered 
from the onshore well 2-TG-96-RS, indicate an 
age range from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. 
The proposed palynological interpretation is 
corroborated by the 87Sr/86Sr isotopes data, which 
provided an age of 6.05 Ma for the sample at 
134.30 m, corresponding to the Messinian stage. 
Furthemore, the planktonic foraminifera recovered 
from the lowermost sample indicates an age range 
from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene, supporting 
the age assignment based on dinoflagellate cysts.

Based on the palynological content, the 
studied section was subdivided into two intervals. 
Comparing these intervals, the decrease in 
frequency of dinoflagellate cysts and the absence 
of foraminiferal linings in the upper interval 
suggest deposition in more proximal conditions, 
in nearshore environments with a nearby fresh 
water influx. The major input of continental 
palynomorphs and woody tissue (opaque 
phytoclast, translucent phytoclast) corroborates 
with this interpretation. The section shows a 
gradual upward shallowing, probably related to 
the depositional environment.

The results obtained represent a contribution 
to the knowledge of the stratigraphic and 
paleoenvironmental evolution of pre-Quaternary 
coastal plain deposits from the Pelotas Basin.

The studied section was deposited on top 
of Gondwana rocks, and can be considerd the 
oldest marine transgression recorded in the area. 
A shallowing upward trend is demonstrated in 
the section characterizing a marginal marine 
environment that was subsequently subjected to 
fresh water input during the Early Pliocene.

Paleozoic and Mesozoic palynomorphs were 
found in the upper portion of the studied interval 
and are interpreted to have been reworked from 
nearshore outcrops Gondwana strata. These pre-
Cenozoic deposits compose the paleorelief of the 
neighboring northern portions of the coastal plain 
of the Pelotas Basin in the Neogene.

RESUMO

Este trabalho apresenta a integração da análise micropa-
leontológica (palinologia e foraminíferos) e de isótopos 
(razão 87Sr/86Sr) de um intervalo selecionado do poço 
2-TG-96-RS, perfurado na porção onshore da Bacia 
de Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. Um total de 
oito amostras da seção entre 140,20 e 73,50 m de 
profundidade foi selecionado para análise palinológica, 
revelando associações de palinomorfos abundantes 
e diversificados. Espécies de esporos, grãos de 
pólen, cistos de dinoflagelados são os palinomorfos 
mais comuns encontrados. Foraminíferos calcáreos 
bentônicos e planctônicos foram recuperados dos dois 
níveis mais inferiores da seção (140,20 e 134,30 m). 
Com base na amplitude estratigráfica de espécies de 

cistos de dinoflagelados e esporomorfos, um intervalo 
de idade entre o Mioceno Superior e o Plioceno Inferior 
é atribuído. A idade relativa obtida a partir da razão 
87Sr/86Sr em carapaças de foraminíferos calcários indica 
correspondência no Mioceno Final (Messiniano), 
corroborando o posicionamento bioestratigráfico realizado 
com palinomorfos. Interpretações paleoambientais 
basea das na distribuição quantitativa dos componentes 
orgânicos (palinomorfos, fitoclastos e matéria orgânica 
amorfa) ao longo da seção e na associação de foraminíferos 
indicam ambiente marinho raso para a seção. Dois 
intervalos palinológicos foram reconhecidos com base 
na análise de palinofácies, relacionados a condições de 
plataforma média a externa (140,20 a 128,90 m) e de 
plataforma interna (115,75 a 73,50 m).
