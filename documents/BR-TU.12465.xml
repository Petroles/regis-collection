Abstract 

Osteomyelitis is a frequent complication of diabetic foot ulcers and/or diabetic foot 

infection. It is defined as an infection of bone tissue and it is an aggravated condition in 

diabetic patient due to their poor blood flow and elevated blood glucose levels, which can 

increase biofilm formation. In general, osteomyelitis cannot be eradicated merely by 

intravenous administration of antibiotics. A successful treatment will include a combination 

of surgical procedures, usually surgical debridement of dead infected tissue and local 

antibiotic therapy. Non-degradable delivery devices are currently used for local antibiotic 

administration. The poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) is widely used to develop 

gentamicin-loaded beads that are implanted on the local of infection. Even though these 

beads are routinely used to treat osteomyelitis, they present several disadvantages, including 

the requirement for a second surgery to remove the beads after treatment. Hence, the use of 

biodegradable devices for antibiotic delivery in osteomyelitis is a very attractive alternative. 

The poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) is an enzymatically biodegradable polymer that 

does not produce acidic degradation products. In the current thesis, the suitability of PTMC 

to function as an antibiotic delivery device for the local treatment of osteomyelitis was 

explored. Gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads were produced and their release kinetics was 

assessed. The inhibition of biofilm formation was also evaluated for these beads and 

compared with the commercially available PMMA Septopal® beads. Additionally, the 

glucose influence in biofilm growth was also studied, namely medium with and without 2.6 

g/L concentration of glucose was used to grow the biofilm The results showed that the mass 

of biofilm (Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus) increased when glucose was 

present in the culture medium, which may explain the difficulties that are observed in the 

treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. The antibiotic release profile and inhibition of 

biofilm formation by the PTMC beads was found to be similar to the PMMA beads. 

Therefore, PTMC seems a promising biodegradable carrier to be used in the local treatment 

of osteomyelitis.

Resumo 

A osteomielite é uma complicação frequente em úlceras e/ou infeção do pé diabético. 

É definida como uma infecção do tecido ósseo, agravada em pacientes diabéticos devido ao 

baixo fluxo sanguíneo e elevado nível de glucose no sangue, o que pode contribuir para a 

formação de biofilme. Em geral, a osteomielite não pode ser erradicada meramente com 

administração intravenosa de antibióticos. Um tratamento bem-sucedido inclui uma 

combinação de procedimentos cirúrgicos, geralmente remoção cirúrgica do tecido infectado 

e morto, seguido de terapia antibiótica local. Dispositivos de administração não-

biodegradáveis são actualmente utilizados para a administração de antibióticos no local 

infectado. O poli (metacrilato de metilo) (PMMA) é amplamente utilizado para desenvolver 

sistemas de libertação controlada de antibióticos, e estes são implantados no local infetado. 

Embora as partículas de PMMA sejam utilizadas com frequência no tratamento da 

osteomielite, estas apresentam várias desvantagens, incluindo a exigência de uma segunda 

cirurgia para as remover, após o tratamento. A utilização de dispositivos biodegradáveis para 

a libertação de antibióticos no tratamento da osteomielite é uma alternativa muito atraente. O 

poli (carbonato de trimetileno) (PTMC) é um polímero enzimaticamente biodegradável que 

não produz produtos de degradação ácidos. No presente trabalho foi explorada a adequação 

de PTMC para funcionar como um dispositivo de administração de antibiótico para o 

tratamento local da osteomielite. Foram produzidas partículas de PTMC carregadas com 

gentamicina e a cinética de libertação do antibiótico foi avaliada. Adicionalmente, a inibição 

da formação de biofilme foi estudada e comparada com as partículas de PMMA Septopal® 

comercialmente disponíveis. Além disso, a influência da glucose no crescimento de biofilme 

também fez parte deste estudo e por conseguinte, desenvolveu-se um biofilme em meio sem 

e com glucose com uma concentração de 2.6 g/L Os resultados mostraram que a massa de 

biofilme (Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus) aumentou na presença de glucose 

no meio de cultura, o que pode explicar a dificuldade observada no tratamento da 

osteomielite do pé diabético. O perfil de libertação do antibiótico e a inibição da formação de 

biofilme para as partículas de PTMC foi semelhante ao encontrado para as partículas de

PMMA. Nesse sentido, as partículas de PTMC parecem ser um transportador biodegradável 

promissor no tratamento local de osteomielite.

Scope 

Diabetic foot osteomyelitis treatment includes surgical removal of the infected bone 

and tissue, followed by implantation of an antibiotic delivery system that is able to provide 

high local antibiotic concentration for an extended period of time. 

PTMC is a biodegradable polymer that presents promising characteristics in the 

treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis as an alternative to the currently used PMMA 

Septopal® beads. 

The goal of this work is to evaluate the suitability of PTMC as an antibiotic delivery 

device to treat diabetic foot osteomyelitis and compare it to the commercially available 

option, namely the abovementioned PMMA Septopal® beads.  

Pursuing this goal, PTMC beads will be created with the same size and gentamicin 

content as the PMMA Septopal® ones and the gentamicin release profiles from both these 

beads will be assessed during 14 days. 

A biofilm model for diabetic foot ulcers using clinically isolated bacterial strains will 

be developed and the glucose influence in the biofilm growth will also be evaluated, given 

that diabetic patients have elevated blood glucose levels.  

At last, the anti-biofilm efficacy will be established for both gentamicin carriers 

through the use of the biofilm model.

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 

Diabetes is known for its complications, it increases the risk for many serious health 

problems. Diabetic foot infections are one of the most common problems in diabetic patients 

and they are responsible for most of amputation cases in these patients.  

1.1. DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS – AETIOLOGY AND PRECIPITATING FACTORS 

A diabetic foot ulcer is a thick wound located below the ankle in a diabetic patient. It 

commonly appears in pressure points such as plantar surfaces, metatarsal heads, heels and big 

toe. This wound is characterized by a loss of epithelium that extends through the dermis 

reaching deeper tissues. Chronic ulcers fail to progress through an orderly and timely sequence 

of repair, and so heal slowly [1]. 

Foot ulcers are the most common cause of diabetes associated hospital admissions and 

the lifetime incidence of foot ulceration is around 25 %. This condition is responsible for 85 % 

of major amputations in diabetic patients [2]. These patients have a 30-fold higher risk of lower 

limb amputation due to infection, as compared with patients without diabetes [3]. 

Furthermore, diabetic foot ulcers are associate with a negative psychological and social 

effect on the patients namely increased family tensions, reduced social activities, limited 

employment and financial burden [1].  

Around half of all foot wounds will become infected during therapy which decreases the 

quality of life and contribute to a high morbidity and premature mortality among the diabetic 

patients [1].  



 

2 

Multiple causes contribute to diabetic foot ulceration, predominantly peripheral 

neuropathy and ischemia from peripheral vascular disease [4].  

The peripheral neuropathy is present in more than 80 % of diabetic patients with foot 

disease, as a consequence of the metabolic disorders [5]. Neuropathy affects peripheral 

sensation, innervation of the small muscles of the foot and fine vasomotor control of the pedal 

circulation. The motor neuropathy is characterized by the alteration of the distribution of forces 

during walking leading to a reactive thickening of skin at sites of abnormal overload. 

Following, ischemic necrosis of tissues beneath the callus causes the breakdown of the skin and 

subcutaneous tissue, consequently forming a neuropathic ulcer (Figure 1) [6].  

Diabetic patients are twice more prone to have a peripheral arterial disease, which is also 

a key risk factor for lower extremity amputation [7]. 

Macrovascular (atherosclerosis) and microvascular disease might cause the foot tissues 

to become ischemic. The ischemic foot loses its protective sweeting, is dry, red, thin with 

dystrophic nails and susceptible to the pressure from a shoe or even an adjacent toe leading to 

the appearance of an ischemic ulcer (Figure 2) [6].

(Taken from [7]). 

Figure 1. Neuropathic ulcer in a 

typical position, i.e. under second 
metatarsal head and surrounded by 

callus (Taken from [6]). 



 

3 

Neuroischemia is the combined effect of diabetic neuropathy and ischaemia, by virtue of 

macrovascular disease and in some cases, microvascular dysfunction impair perfusion in a 

diabetic foot and a neuroischemic ulcer is formed (Figure 3) [7].  

The initial injury to provoke an ulcer, can be caused by acute mechanical or thermal 

trauma when continuous or repetitive mechanical 

stress is applied [6]. 

Impaired wound healing is a major factor that 

contributes to the augment of chronic foot ulceration 

and amputation. Diabetic patients have functional 

changes in the microcirculation and in cellular 

activity, the expression of the various growth factors 

and cytokines that are normally involved in tissue 

repair and wound healing. A normal process of 

wound healing entails a complex interplay between connective tissue formation, cellular 

activity and growth factor activation; however these physiological processes are altered in these 

patients thus preventing the ulcer to heal [8].  

Nosocomial infection rate has been reported to increase 2.7-fold when glucose blood 

levels are above 220 mg/dL. Diabetes mellitus has been linked to the development of these 

infections [9]. 

Elevated blood glucose causes endogenous glycation leading to cellular dysfunction in 

soft tissues and decreases cellular and humeral immune response [8].  

Polymicrobial infections dominate diabetic foot infections and the diversity of bacterial 

populations in chronic wounds appears to be important to the chronicity of wounds. The biofilm 

mode of growth of the infecting organism represents another obstacle to heal a chronic wound 

[2].  

Figure 3. Neuroischemic ulcer (Taken 
from [7]). 



 

4 

Previous studies reported that biofilm formation in vitro increases with increasing 

glucose concentrations through the accessory gene regulator (agr) pathway [8]. Cellular 

environment containing glucose and at a low pH has been found to increase biofilm formation 

resulting from the decreased agr expression [10]. 

Even though the reported data suggests that biofilm formation increases in the presence 

of higher glucose concentration, only few concentrations were studied in the hyperglycemic 

range of 100 to 500 mg/dL and additional information about the dose response of biofilm 

formation to glucose levels in the clinically relevant range of 20 to 300 mg/dL, is still 

uncovered. The severity of anomalous glucose levels, affecting microbe pathogenicity is 

important to know specially when dealing with diabetic patients with an infected wound [8].  

1.2. CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS 

A classification of foot ulcers is important in the selection of comparable populations for 

urgently needed multicenter trials. In this respect, two international working parties are trying to 

define a system that describes individual ulcers to develop a classification for audit and 

research. Even though there is no commonly accepted method for classification or description 

of foot ulcers yet [6]. 

Early and assertive diagnostic aids in the development of a proper management plan and 

can be crucial in preventing the formation of a chronical wound. There are some systems of 

ulcer classification based on a variety of physical findings such as size, depth, appearance and 

location. The classification system of Wagner Ulcer (Table 1) is the most well-known being 

based on wound depth and the extent of tissue necrosis.

Table 1. Wagner Ulcer classification system (Taken from [3]). 

Grade Lesion 

1 Superficial diabetic ulcer 

2 

Ulcer extension involving ligament, tendon, 

joint capsule, or fascia with no abscess or 

osteomyelitis 

3 Deep ulcer with abscess or osteomyelitis 

4 Gangrene to portion of forefoot 

5 Extensive gangrene of foot 

The major drawback of the Wagner’s classification is the fact that it does not consider 

the presence of ischemia or infection.  

The University of Texas proposed a different classification addressing the ulcer depth 

and presence of infection and ischemia (Table 2). With increasing grade and stage of the 

wound, the difficulty to heal increases and vascular repair or amputation might be needed [4].

1.3. CLASSIFICATION OF INFECTION 

When an ulcer is formed, interior tissues are exposed to bacterial colonization, which 

can lead to an infection and this infection can further reach deeper tissues [11].  

An infected ulcer must be diagnosed clinically when purulent secretions are present or at 

least 2 of the cardinal manifestations of inflammation are observed. An early diagnose and 

curing of the infection often contributes to healing of the ulcer [12]. 

Once an infection is installed, it typically takes the form of cellulitis, deep-skin and soft-

tissue infections, acute osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis. 

Cellulitis is defined as an acute infection of the skin involving the subcutaneous tissues. 

Clinically it is characterized by erythema (&gt;2cm in diameter) in association with purulent 

discharge, with or without lymphangitis. The diagnostic is generally based on the morphologic 

features of the lesion and the clinical setting. If drainage or an open wound is present, most 

probably there is an infection. The infection may be caused by indigenous flora colonizing skin 

and appendages as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, or by a wide variety of 

exogenous bacteria [13,14]. 

Skin and soft-tissue infections are defined as a suppurative microbial invasion of the 

epidermis and subcutaneous tissues that induce either a local or systemic host response. This 

type of infections are characterized by induration, erythema, warmth and pain or tenderness and 

range from mild self-limiting furunculosis to life threatening necrotizing fasciitis [15, 16].  

Osteomyelitis (OM) derivate from Greek words: osteon, myelos and itis and it refers to 

the infection of the bone and bone marrow. Even though bone is normally resistant to bacterial 

colonization, some events as trauma, surgery or prosthesis may disrupt the bone and lead to an 

infection [17]. 

Diagnosing osteomyelitis in a diabetic patient with a foot infections is difficult, 

therefore it is frequently missed and underdiagnosed [5]. Undiagnosed and untreated OM often 



 

7 

leads to limb amputation; the risk for amputation in acute diabetic infections is four times 

higher with OM than with soft tissue infection alone. Furthermore, the presence of OM requires 

a longer duration of antibiotic therapy and a longer duration of hospital stay, thereby raising the 

hospitalization costs [18]. 

OM can be found in 15 % of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, and in 20 % of patients 

with diabetic foot infections. The risk of developing OM is higher at the presence of ulcers 

larger than 2 cm
2
 or a diabetic foot ulcer with exposed bone or joint [18]. Although efforts have 

been made to reduce incidence and consequences of OM, there is still a large proportion of the 

world population suffering from chronic OM, due to a vast increase in reconstructive orthopedic 

procedures and higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, together with longer life-expectancies 

[19].  

The most common sites of OM are in the forefoot (90 %) followed by the midfoot (5 %) 

and hindfoot (5 %). The bones usually more involved are the weight-bearing bones of the foot, 

particularly to what it is referred as the ‘tripod of the foot’ that includes the first metatarsal 

head, fifth metatarsal head, and the calcaneum [18]. 

Histologically, OM is characterized by the 

presence of leukocytes or inflammatory cells, such as 

lymphocytes and plasma cells, and by the presence of 

bone necrosis (Figure 4).  

An inadequate treatment of the acute phase 

permits OM to persist and become chronic or 

“dormant” for a considerable period of time, only to 

manifest again at a later stage [19]. 

OM can be classified according to duration (acute or chronic), pathogenesis (trauma, 

contiguous spread, hematogenous, surgical), site, extent or type of patient. Although several 

classifications of OM have been described by different authors, the classification of Cierny and 

Figure 4. Infected ulceration and osteomyelitis 

(Taken from [39]). 



 

8 

Mader is one of the most widely used. Under this system, OM is classified according to the 

anatomic involvement of the infected bone, in four types [20]:  

Type 1 – Medullary OM, infection confined to the medullary cavity of the bone; 

Type 2 – Superficial OM, involves only the cortical bone and often originates from a 

direct inoculation or a contagious focus infection; 

Type 3 – Localized OM, the infectious process does not involve the entire bone 

diameter; 

Type 4 – Diffuse OM, involves the entire thickness of the bone characterized for loss of 

stability. 

OM of the foot is a very serious and common problem in diabetic patient and a high 

index of clinical suspicion is required for diagnosis [5]. 

1.4. OSTEOMYELITIS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 

The pathophysiology of chronic OM is multifactorial beginning with the spread of 

bacteria that can reach the bone by hematogenous seeding, followed by direct inoculation, or 

airborne contamination [21]. Whatever the route of access, bacteria must be able to 

subsequently adhere to components of the bone matrix in order to start the infection [22]. 

The most common pathogens responsible for OM are the Staphylococcus species, 

followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. S. aureus is the main causative 

strain of chronic bacterial OM and around 90 % cases of OM associated with implants are 

caused by S. epidermidis [22]. 

Superficial fungal skin infections are common in diabetic patients, contributing to the 

entry of bacteria through macerated or broken skin. Furthermore, these patients have a high rate 



 

9 

of nasal and skin colonization with S. aureus, who is more likely to be present on the skin and 

take advantage of any disruptions [5]. 

S. aureus is known for its capacity to bind fibrinogen which can provide an explanation 

for this microorganism ability to survive in body fluids. Bacteria clump together and are 

covered in a layer of fibrinogen, hence protected from the host defense mechanisms and 

antibiotics [22].  

Diabetic foot infections are mostly polymicrobial with mixed gram-positive and gram-

negative bacteria, of both aerobic and anaerobic types [21].  

Once bacteria are in contact with the bone and/or implant it may use different 

mechanisms to facilitate cell-cell and/or cell-implant adhesion. Bacteria become sessile, reduce 

their metabolic rate, and produce a biofilm that protects them from antimicrobials, opsonization 

and phagocytosis [21].  

Biofilm is defined as a multistage process in which microbial cells adhere to a surface or 

to the surface of other organisms (initial reversible attachment), with subsequent production of 

an extracellular matrix that contains polysaccharides, proteins and DNA (extracellular 

polymeric substance – EPS) [2]. Cells embedded in this matrix, also referred to as ‘slime’, 

communicate with each other and show a coordinated group behavior. The biofilm cells are 

phenotypically and physiologically different from non-adhered (planktonic) cells. One of their 

typical properties is the increased resistance to antimicrobial agents [23].  

An estimated 65-80 % of all infections is thought to be biofilm-related, being the 

biofilm formation often considered as the underlying reason why the treatment with 

antimicrobial agents fails [23] since the embedded organisms are extensively protected by their 

slimy layer [19]. 

The protective mechanism found in a biofilm appears to be distinct from the 

mechanisms responsible for conventional antibiotic resistance, making biofilm bacteria 800-

fold less susceptible to antibiotics than the planktonic ones [19].

1.5. TREATMENT OF OSTEOMYELITIS 

In the early 1900s, around 20 % of patients suffering from OM died, while the survivors 

remained with significant morbidity. Nowadays, the mortality and morbidity of these patients is 

lower due to surgical treatment together with prolonged antibiotic treatment [24].  

A successful treatment of OM in the diabetic foot is a combination of antibiotic therapy 

and surgical procedures. A surgical intervention is almost always required due to the impaired 

blood supply of the affected regions and the low ability of the host immune system to clear 

infections [21]. The procedure includes surgical debridement, drainage of pus, excision of the 

osteomyelitic bone and/or minor amputations. Debridement is essential and is often the first 

factor in the elimination of an infection [24].  

In addition, stabilization of the foot is also an important factor in the surgical 

management, since debridement often causes a large dead space that needs to be managed 

effectively to prevent the infection to resurge. The dead space management includes closed 

irrigation systems, local soft tissue flaps, vascularized free flaps, as a variety of methods for 

local antibiotic delivery [21].  

Chronic OM cannot be eradicated alone by intravenous administration of antibiotics, 

since the infected necrotic focus in the bone, is usually surrounded by sclerotic avascular bone, 

which is almost unreachable using systemic antibiotics. Also, the necrotic bone is a suitable 

substrate for biofilm formation, reducing the antibiotic sensitivity of the infecting pathogens 

and making the infection difficult to treat [25]. 

Local delivery of antibiotics is a novel therapeutic procedure in chronic OM, allowing 

high antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection without systemic antibiotic toxicity [24], 

[19]. 

Antibiotics incorporated in local delivery systems have shown broad and sufficient 

antibacterial efficacy. The requirements of these antibiotics are that they must be heat stable and 

hydrophilic [21]. Aminoglycosides in general, mainly gentamicin, are preferred antibiotics from 



 

11 

bacteriological and physico chemical point of view. Nevertheless, the increasing gentamicin 

resistance of staphylococci in bone infections requires the use of a different antibiotic. 

Vancomycin is the antibiotic used as last resort for the treatment of clinically resistant 

bacteria, like methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [26].  

LOCAL ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY  

Gentamicin-loaded bone cement beads were first created by Klemm in 1979 and these 

were used to fill the dead space after debridement of dead bone with a successful cure rate of 

91,4% in more than 100 patients [21]. 

Systemic therapy has been left behind due to the numerous advantages achieved with 

the use of antibiotic-loaded beads. These beads are placed by a simple procedure and usually 

performed at time of the initial debridement of chronic OM or open fracture [21].  

Currently, the standard procedure of OM treatment includes the traditional systemic 

antibiotic regimes associated with implant removal and/or tissue debridement, and bone void 

fillers absorbed with antibiotics, antibiotic-infused collagen sponges, or antibiotic-loaded bone 

cement [27]. Drawbacks of these systems are the fact that they require a second surgery for 

removal [21] and/or, they lack in controlled pharmaceutical release strategies needed for an 

effective local dosing and duration. Low and short antibiotic release can boost the development 

of antibiotic resistance and persistence infection [27]. 

In order to achieve the therapeutic drug concentrations in the infected area, high 

systemic doses are needed which can further worsen toxic side effects. Nonetheless, normal 

doses of systemic antibiotics may not be enough to breach the glycocalyx of the biofilm 

produced by the infecting bacteria [28]. 

The selection of the appropriate antibiotic has to be made by understanding the 

microbiology of bone and soft tissue infections [28]. Antimicrobial agents used in local delivery 

systems should present specific features such as available solid dosage form; wide bacterial 



 

12 

spectrum; bactericidal potency low concentrations; elution from carrier in high concentrations 

for prolonged periods; low/no risk of allergy or delayed hypersensitivity; low influence on the 

mechanical properties of the carrier; and low drug serum protein binding [24], [27]. 

Furthermore, an ideal local antibiotic device system must provide reliable pathogen 

killing via immediate burst release within the first 24 hour period after administration, followed 

by sustained drug release above the tissue bed’s minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 

address the remaining microbial threat [27].  

Several antibiotic–releasing systems are currently marketed as bone void fillers, they 

release antibiotic over short periods of time  and may degrade quickly [27].  

Even though the ideal local antibiotic delivery system has not been discovered yet, a 

selection of very promising materials is currently in place. Table 1 lists the most successful 

carriers for the release of antibiotics according to the dosage prescribed [28].

1.6. NON-BIODEGRADABLE ANTIBIOTIC DELIVERY SYSTEMS: PMMA BASED 

The poly(methyl methacrylate) (IUPAC name) also designated as PMMA is a non-

biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. It is a synthetic homopolymer of methyl 

methacrylate monomer (MMA) (Figure 5), classified as hard, rigid, but brittle material, with a 

glass transition temperature of 105 °C [29].  

 

 

 

 

The PMMA polymer is considered hydrophobic although it can become slightly 

hydrophilic when in contact with water as indicated by a decrease in the contact angle and a 

pronounced contact angle hysteresis. It is currently accepted as a non-toxic polymer with a very 

good toxicological safety record in biomedical applications and without references to severe 

adverse effects [29]. 

PMMA was first used by Charnley in 1958 to anchor joint replacements; it is commonly 

called bone cement and it is often used in orthopedics [19]. This polymer has the ability to 

successfully consolidate implants in bone in a handler and host-friendly manner, with limited 

adverse and rare allergic reactions [19]. 

Since 1970, PMMA has been used as a local delivery system of antibiotics in two 

different ways, namely as antibiotic-loaded bone cement applied in joint replacements and 

chains of antibiotic-loaded beads for musculoskeletal infections [29]. 

Figure 5. Chemical structure of the repeating unit of  poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer (Taken 

from [29]). 



 

15 

The first applications of PMMA as a particulate carrier material were on the 

development of nanoparticles for vaccination purposes and on beads to fill defects related to 

surgical resection of chronic OM [29].  

Antibiotics most commonly used have been the aminoglycosides; gentamicin or 

tobramycin. Even though its use as a drug particulate carrier system has been somehow 

neglected due to the fact that it is (bio)inert and non-biodegradable, this polymer is still an 

eligible candidate as biomedical material because of its biocompatibility [29].  

The selection of the antibiotic to be used in PMMA must be carefully considered since it 

has to present chemical and heat stability, since PMMA polymerization often reaches 80°C, and 

it has also to be able to diffuse through the pores of the polymer providing a local concentration 

that exceeds the MIC for the infecting organisms [30]. Additionally, the antibiotic must be 

available in the powder form since liquid antibiotics weaken the cement matrix and finally, it 

has to be water-soluble and hydrophilic to potentiate the release [19]. 

Gentamicin sulfate is the antibiotic most commonly used; it is an excellent additive to 

PMMA due to its broad spectrum of action, bactericidal properties, low rate of primarily 

resistant pathogens and good thermostability. Vancomycin and tobramycin are also eligible 

options, they are both water soluble and available in powder form [21]. Nevertheless the use of 

vancomycin in non-biodegradable carriers is limited, especially in bone cement applications 

because it shows poor release due to the antibiotic high molecular weight [26]. 

Antibiotic release from bone cement will depend on how the body fluid is capable of 

reaching the regions of the cement matrix. In the first hours or days after implantation it is 

observed a burst release, since the antibiotic at the cement surface is easily available. The 

dissolution fluid penetrates the bone cement dissolving the antibiotic within superficial regions, 

while the interior usually remains unreached [30]. Often, only 10 % of the total amount of 

antibiotic incorporated is released from bone cement [19].  



 

16 

1.7. PMMA CARRIERS TO TREAT OSTEOMYELITIS 

PMMA can be used in the treatment of OM as chains of beads or spacers [19].  

Beads of PMMA can be used for all kinds of chronic OM and are commercially 

available as chains of gentamicin-loaded PMMA spheres (Septopal®) or handmade from 

commercially available antibiotic-loaded bone cement [19].  

Although PMMA beads are frequently used for OM, they are not specialized in the 

therapy of resistant infections, presenting restrictions mainly regarding the use of various 

antibiotics [19]. Septopal® beads demonstrate a good antibiotic release due to a porous cement 

matrix and the addition of glycin yielding gentamicin tissue levels above MIC for non-resistant 

bacterial strains, for 30 days. These beads are routinely used to treat OM with no regard about 

the infecting bacterial strains that are present or their sensitivity to gentamicin. The augmenting 

of gentamicin-resistant staphylococci related with the use of PMMA beads has been raising 

concerns about the choice of such therapeutics. Another disadvantage of PMMA beads is the 

fact that they can provide a substratum for bacterial colonization, mainly because the amount of 

antibiotic release decreases over time thus becoming ineffective [19].  

The major drawback of PMMA beads is the need for a second surgical procedure to 

remove the beads after treatment, since the polymer is non-biodegradable [21], [25]. 

Additionally, the beads do not release all of their antibiotic content, reportedly after 2 weeks in 

situ, only 20-70 % of the total amount of gentamicin loaded is released and the concentration of 

the antibiotic drops considerably afterwards [25].  

The PMMA spacers are a temporary implant to maintain the joint space and soft-tissue 

tension, besides being used in joint replacement infections. They decrease the morbidity and the 

implantation of a new prosthesis, during the second surgery, is less complicated. for the patient 

[19]. 



 

17 

The spacer can be modified by using commercially available mould kits. This enables 

the clinicians to alter the antibiotic composition and dosage according to the size of the implant 

[19].  

The advantages of this method are the immediate treatment of the source of infection, 

reaching high antibiotic levels locally; maintenance of joint mobility; limitation of scar 

formation; absence of soft tissue contraction and easy re-implantation [31]. However, the 

antibiotic sustained release from the spacers is lower when compared to the beads, due to their 

lower surface area [19]. 

The use of low-dose antibiotic bone cement for handmade spacers or beads results in a 

sub-therapeutic antibiotic release that can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. 

On the other hand, the addition of more than 10 % of antibiotic in PMMA weakens significantly 

the weight-baring carrier and the toxicity risk increases when the overall antibiotic loading is 

too high [32]. Furthermore, unpredictable release rates are expected when there is an uneven 

distribution of the antibiotic and a variable surface area [19]. 

BIODEGRADABLE ANTIBIOTIC DELIVERY SYSTEMS: PTMC BASED  

The use of biodegradable devices as antibiotic carriers to treat OM is very appealing 

since these carriers are able to fulfill the dead space result ing from the surgical debridement 

and, more importantly, they release all their entire antibiotic content and a second surgical 

removal after treatment is not required [26], [19]. 

The most frequently investigated biodegradable antibiotic carriers are the poly(lactic 

acid) (PLA) and/or poly(glycolic acid) (PGA). However, the use of these polymers as bone 

implants are controversial due to the bone resorption, that can occur as a result of a decrease in 

pH while the polymer degrades [26]. Further, some studies have reported an inflammatory 

foreign-body reaction, related with PLA and PGA implants [25]. Therefore, these polymers are 

not ideal for the local treatment of bone infections. Carriers that do not produce acidic 



 

18 

degradation products are highly preferable. This requirement is satisfied with the biodegradable 

poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) [26]. 

PTMC (Figure 6) is a resorbable, amorphous and flexible polymer with a glass transition 

temperature of approximately -17 °C. Also, it degrades in water, CO2 and propanediol, and it is 

a relatively new polymer in biomedical applications [26], [33]. 

 

Figure 6. Chemical structure of poly(trimethylene carbonate) (Taken from [34]). 

The degradation of PTMC in vitro at pH 7 and 37 °C is quite low compared to the in 

vivo degradation, thus suggesting enzymatic involvement [25, 26]. In fact, enzymes play an 

important role in the in vivo degradation which can be simulated in vitro by the use of a lipase 

solution. PTMC hardly degrades in vitro without the presence of lipase and it is known also to 

be susceptible to cholesterol esterase [26], [35].  

PTMC degrades enzymatically in a uniform manner by surface erosion providing 

sustained high antibiotic release rates [25]. Enzymatic surface erosion by cholesterol esterase 

and superoxide anion radicals, mediated by macrophages, was only recently reported and 

PTMC appears to degrade completely in bone and assist in promoting bone regeneration [19], 

[25]. 

In vitro data suggests that molecular weight of PTMC can be adjusted to control the 

release rate of various antibiotics with an ideal and sustained, zero order release profile [19]. 

The in vivo degradation behavior of PTMC seems to be molecular weight dependent, as 

the degradation has been found to occur faster in PTMC with higher molecular weights [26], 

[35],[36]. This result can be due to the greater hydrophilicity of the lower molecular weight 



 

19 

after aqueous conditioning, which might induce conformational changes on the enzyme when 

absorbed at PTMC interface, reducing its activity [35].  

Another possible explanation is the oxidation of PTMC as the primary in vivo 

degradation mechanism. Oxidative degradation occurs as a frustrated phagocytosis when 

macrophages attach to the material surface and secrete reactive oxygen species. Among these, 

superoxide anion is believed to be responsible for the in vivo oxidative degradation of PTMC. 

The third explanation proposed is the fact that macrophages preferentially attach to, or are more 

active on, PTMC with molecular weights greater than 100 Kg/mol [35]. 

In short, PTMC appears to be a promising biodegradable carrier in the local treatment of 

OM presenting good biocompatibility and the ability to degrade in a uniform manner potentially 

releasing all its antibiotic content. Finally, due to its surface erosion, PTMC is not expected to 

limit the release of high molecular weight drugs [25, 26].

Chapter 2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. MICROORGANISMS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS 

Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococusfarcalis, Staphylococcus 

epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus isolated from diabetic patients with OM (Bio Trading 

Benelux B. V., Mijdrecht) were cryopreserved on beads (-80 ºC). Each of these species was 

smeared on blood agar plates and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 ºC. After incubation the 

plates were stored in the fridge at 4 ºC for a maximum of two months. For each experiment, a 

colony was inoculated in 10 mL of tryptone soya broth (TSB; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) or in 

nutrient broth (NB; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated for 24 h at 37 ºC. After incubation 

the absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 600 nm using a Spectroinic 20 Genesys 

spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments, Beun, DeRonde, Abcoude). Pre-cultures were 

diluted to an absorbance value of 0.1 which corresponds to 1x10
8
 bacteria/mL. 

S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (purchased from ATCC, UK and used as received) was 

streaked on a blood agar plate and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h. After incubation the plate was 

stored at 4 ºC. For indirect bacterial inhibition assay one colony was inoculated in 10 mL of 

TSB culture medium and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h. 

2.2. SEPTOPAL® 

Antibiotic–loaded poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) beads are commercially available 

under the name of Septopal (Biomet Europe, Darmstadt, Germany) and were kindly provided 

by the University Medical Centre of Groningen (The Netherlands). 



 

22 

Each Septopal bead contains 2.8 mg of gentamicin sulfate (corresponding to 1.7 mg of 

gentamicin base). The gentamicin release profile of Septopal beads was determined and they 

were used for anti-biofilm efficacy test. 

2.3. GENTAMICIN LOADED PTMC BEADS 

High purity, polymerization grade 1,3 – trimethylene carbonate was purchased from 

Medisse (Medisse BV, Ede, The Netherlands) and was used to prepare poly(trimethylene 

carbonate) (PTMC) polymer with MW 556 g/mol and Mn 439 g/mol.  

PTMC polymer, 1 g, was dissolved in 38 mL of tetrahydrofuran (purchased from Merck, 

Darmstadt, Germany, used as received) under magnetic stirring at 250 rpm for 24 h. 

Septopal PMMA bead contains 2.8 mg of gentamicin sulfate, the weight of one PTMC 

bead is approximately 52 mg which corresponds to 5 % of gentamicin content in each bead.  

To the dissolved polymer 0.055 g of gentamicin sulfate (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, 

St. Louis, USA) was added, in order to create PTMC beads with the same gentamicin content as 

PMMA beads. After gentamicin addition the solution was mixed for 5 min in ultrasonic bath 

followed by magnetic stirring for 24 h. 

The solution containing the antibiotic dispersion was precipitated into 400 mL of 

anhydrous hexane (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 

USA, used as received). Once PTMC and gentamicin sulfate 

do not dissolve in hexane, this induces precipitation of the 

polymer - through which gentamicin is homogeneously 

distributed. The composite was then collected and dried under 

vacuum at room temperature in a Heraus oven (Jott. Wilten- 

Utrecht N.V.) 

Figure 7. Stainless steel molds 

used to prepare PTMC beads. 



 

23 

PTMC beads with dispersed antibiotic particles incorporated were prepared by 

compression-molded at 70 ºC, using a stainless steel molds (see Figure 7) and a laboratory press 

(Carver Inc., Wabash, IN, USA). From this procedure were created 10 PTMC beads loaded 

with 5 % of gentamicin. 

PTMC beads with 7.5 % of gentamicin and without antibiotic were also made following 

the previous procedure. 

2.4. RELEASE OF GENTAMICIN 

Enzymes seem to play an important role in in vivo degradation of PTMC which can be 

simulated in vitro by the use of a lipase solution. Cholesterol esterase is one of the enzymes 

responsible for in vivo degradation.  

Gentamicin release was determined at 37 ºC in lipase solution from 

Thermomyceslanuginosus (EC 3.1.1.3., minimum 100.0 units/g, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, 

used as received) and in cholesterol esterase from porcine pancreas (minimum 30.9 units/mg, 

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, diluted to a final concentration of 1 U/mL).  

Gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads (n=3) were immersed in 5 mL of lipase or cholesterol 

esterase solution and incubated at 37 ºC under 150 rpm stirring (shaker incubator Innova 4000, 

New Brunswick scientific) for 2 weeks. Liquid samples of 1mL were taken every 24 h and then 

stored at 4 ºC before analysis. After taking the sample the entire solution medium was replaced. 

This procedure was done to 5 % and 7.5 % gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads in lipase solution.  

The release of PTMC beads 7.5 % gentamicin loaded was also performed in cholesterol 

esterase solution in order to compare to the release in lipase solution.  

For comparison, the gentamicin release from PMMA (n=3) was determined in 

potassium phosphate buffer (PBS).  



 

24 

Gentamicin concentrations in lipase or cholesterol esterase solution could not be 

determined spectrophotometrically due to interference of the enzyme. An indirect 

bacterialinhibition assay was used to determine gentamicin concentrations in these samples. The 

same process was used to determine gentamicin release from PMMA beads. 

Pre-culture of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 was incubated for 24 h, this species is highly 

sensitive to gentamicin. The pre-culture was smeared on nine TSB agar plates with a cotton 

swab.  

Gentamicin stock solution with a concentration of 5 mg/mL was made out of 0.005 g of 

gentamicin diluted in 10 mL of PBS. The stock solution was diluted 10 times for a solution with 

500 µg/mL gentamicin concentration. This last solution was diluted 2 times to obtain a solution 

with 250 µg/mL gentamicin concentration and this was sequentially repeated until a 

concentration of 2 µg/mL. From each known gentamicin concentration solutions 15 µgL was 

dropped on TSB agar plates, and the plates were incubated for 24 h. The antibiotic inhibits 

bacteria growth during incubation which resulted in zones of inhibition. The areas of the 

inhibition were clear around the position of the samples droplets, the diameter was measured in 

two perpendicular directions and a calibration curve was made. 

The previous procedure was repeated with the samples taken from PTMC in lipase and 

cholesterol esterase solution, also for PMMA beads in PBS. Gentamicin concentration in each 

sample was deduced by comparison with the inhibition zones corresponding to the known 

gentamicin concentrations and using the calibration curve. 

2.5. MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION AND GROWTH CURVES 

Gentamicin sensitivity of each clinically isolated strains was evaluated with Etest® 

(purchased from bioMérieux, USA, used as received). 



 

25 

In 5 TSB agar plates each diluted pre-culture (24 h of incubation at 37 ºC) was smeared 

and the Etest was then placed in the middle of each plate. The plates were incubated for 24 h 

and MIC value was measured afterwards. 

The species S. aureus, E. cloacae, S. epidermidis were sensitive to gentamicin (MIC-

value below 4 µg/mL) and therefore selected to be used throughout this work.  

In this study, it was also our intention to test the influence of glucose on biofilm growth 

since diabetic patients have elevated blood glucose levels.  

Nutrient broth glucose free medium (10 mL) was used for pre-culture of each selected 

species and after 24 h of incubation they were seeded in NB agar plates and in NB agar plates 

with 2.6 g/L of glucose, a clinically relevant concentration. New Etest was performed to test if 

gentamicin sensitivity of this species was affected by the presence of glucose. 

Growth curves of planktonic bacteria were created to assess the glucose influence on 

bacterial growth. Pre-cultures of the 3 species were made in 10 mL of NB medium for 24 h of 

incubation.  

In sterile containers (Greiner, NL), 500 µL of each pre-culture was added to 22.5 mL of 

NB medium and NB medium with 2.6 g/L of glucose. The solutions were stored in the stirring 

incubator (Shaker incubator Innova 4000, New Brunswick scientific, 37 ºC, 150 rpm) and the 

absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 600 nm in spectrophotometer (Spectronic 

Instruments, Beun, DeRonde, Abcoude) at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 23, 25, 26, 27 h. 

2.6. BIOFILM GROWTH 

After testing the glucose influence on planktonic bacteria this effect was tested in 

biofilm growth.  

In 96-well plates with flat bottom (microtest tissue culture plate, Becton Dickinson 

Labware, USA), 200 µL of diluted pre-cultures were seeded and incubated at 37 ºC for 1 h. 



 

26 

Wells were washed with buffer and 200 µL of NB medium with 2.6 g/L glucose and without 

glucose was added. Plates were incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h and 48 h (medium was refreshed 

after 24 h). The medium was removed and the wells were gently washed 3 times with 200 µL of 

PBS. Each well was stained with 200 µL of 1 % crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. 

After staining, the plates were gently rinsed 3 times with demineralized water. Quantitative 

analysis of biofilm formation was performed by adding 200 µL of ethanol/acetone (80:20) to 

solubilize the crystal violet. The absorbance of this solution was measured using a FLUOstar 

Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) at a wavelength of 575 nm. 

The absorbance is proportional to the amount of crystal violet, which is directly proportional to 

the amount of biofilm growth in each well. This procedure was done to 24 and 48 h plates. 

Crystal violet stains the living and dead bacterial and also the slime of the biofilm, to 

measure only the living bacteria present in the biofilm, a metabolic activity assay (MTT 

staining) was performed after 24 and 48 h. After seeding 200 µL of pre-cultures for 1 h in the 

96-well plate the supernatant was removed from the wells and these were washed with 200 µL 

of PBS. Biofilms were stained with 200 µL of MTT solution for 1 h at 37 ºC in the dark. MTT 

solution was previously made with 10mL of PBS, 0.005 g of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-

yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, Sigma Aldrich St. Louis, USA), 0.100 g glucose 

monohydrate (purchased from Merck, Darmstadt) and 100 µL of menadione. The wells were 

washed with 200 µL of demineralized water and MTT was solubilized in 200 µL of acid 

isopropanol (5 %, 1 M, purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, used as received). The 

absorbance was measured using a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, 

Offenburg, Germany) at the wavelength of 575 nm. 

2.7. BIOFILM MODEL 

A biofilm model was developed to evaluate gentamicin concentration necessary to 

prevent biofilm growth and to treat the biofilm. Also, the influence of glucose on gentamicin 

sensitivity was studied. 



 

27 

S. epidermidis has a MIC value in NB medium lower than the value that is possible to 

measure in Etest. Also, the MTT or crystal violet stain results from the biofilm growth of this 

species were inconclusive so we did not proceed with this strain to further develop the biofilm 

model. Therefore, the biofilm model was developed with S. aureus and E. cloacae. 

2.7.1. PREVENT BIOFILM 

For the prevention of biofilm growth, 1 mL of pre-cultures of S. aureus and E. cloacae 

were seeded for 1 h at 37 ºC in 6-well plates with flat bottom (culture multiwell plate, Sigma-

Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).  

A gentamicin stock solution of 1000 µg/mL was previously made with 0.02 g of 

gentamicin and 20 mL of NB medium with 2.6 g/L glucose and without glucose, this solution 

was diluted to make solutions with the concentration of 5 and 10 µg/mL. 

Pre-cultures were removed from the wells and gentamicin solutions (with and without 

glucose) were added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 24 h. For the control wells 

only medium with and without glucose was added. After incubation, the number of bacteria in 

the biofilm was determined by CFU counts (serial dilutions and plate counting). Gentamicin 

solutions were removed from these wells and they were gently washed with 2 mL of PBS, then 

1 mL of PBS was added and the bottom of the wells were scraped with a cell scraper. From the 

wells 400 µL of solution was removed, stored in Eppendorf´s and diluted according to Figure 8. 



 

28 

2.7.2. BIOFILMS TREATMENT 

Gentamicin solutions of 500 µg/mL and 1000 µg/mL in NB medium with and without 

glucose were made using a previously prepared stock solution. Diluted pre-cultures were seeded 

in 6-well plates for 1 h (37 ºC), medium with and without glucose was added and then plates 

were incubated. After 24 h of biofilm growth, the medium was removed and gentamicin 

solutions were added for a 24 h treatment.  

The treatment was also performed for a 48 h old biofilm, so the medium from these 

plates was refreshed after 24 h and the same procedure described above was made. Control 

wells containing only medium with and without glucose were used. 

The number of bacteria was determined by CFU count with the same dilution scheme as 

the one illustrated in Figure 8.

2.8. ANTI-BIOFILM EFFICACY 

After establishing the biofilm model, the anti-biofilm efficacy was evaluated. The 

prevention and treatment of biofilm were tested once again, but the gentamicin solutions were 

replaced with gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads and Septopal PMMA beads. 

2.8.1. PREVENTION OF BIOFILM GROWTH 

For the prevention of biofilm growth model, we used gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads 

and PTMC beads with no gentamicin content, were used as control.  

The results of the release profile of loaded PTMC beads in cholesterol esterase, showed 

that one bead releases 585 µg of gentamicin in cholesterol esterase solution. In order to have a 

gentamicin concentration of 7.5 µg/mL approximately, 226.5 µL of cholesterol esterase was 

added to 78 mL of NB medium with and without glucose in sterile bottles. After 24 h of stirring 

incubation (37 ºC, 150 rpm), the content of the bottles was removed and stored at 4 ºC for 

further use. 

In 12-well plates with flat bottom (culture multi-well plate, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 

USA) pre-cultures were seeded for 1 h. After removing the pre-cultures 2 mL of previously 

stored solutions were added to each well and plates were incubated for 24 h.  

Biofilm was scraped from the bottom of the wells and the number of bacteria was 

determined by CFU count as previously described and confocal laser scanning microscopy 

images were taken. 

2.8.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILMS 

After 1 h of incubation of pre-cultures in 12-well plates, 1 gentamicin-loaded PTMC 

bead was placed in the well and 2 mL of cholesterol esterase solution (1 U/mL) in NB medium 

with and without glucose (2.6 g/L) was added. The same procedure was made with PMMA 



 

30 

beads, although cholesterol esterase solution was replaced by NB medium with and without 

glucose.  

After 24 h and 48 h of treatment, the biofilm was scraped from the bottom of the wells 

and the number of bacteria was determined by CFU count as previously described. 

2.9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

Due to time restrictions and limited availability of materials for the development of the 

current work, only the gentamicin release profiles from PTMC and PMMA beads were 

determined in triplicate. 

A confidence level of 95 % interval was applied for statistical significance and student's 

t-test for independent samples was used.

Chapter 3. Results and Discussion 

 

In this chapter the results are presented and discussed, namely the gentamicin release 

profile from PMMA Septopal® beads and its comparison with the release profile of the 

produced PTMC beads, with different gentamicin concentrations and erosion mediums. 

The results related to the biofilm model developed are also provided, for the treatment 

and prevention of biofilm formation with different gentamicin concentrations and at last, the 

anti-biofilm efficacy using the PTMC and PMMA beads for treatment and prevention of 

biofilm formation.  

3.1. RELEASE PROFILE FROM PTMC VERSUS PMMA BEADS 

PMMA beads constitute an effective drug delivery system for local antibiotic therapy in 

bone infection. However, after high initial gentamicin concentration release at the site of 

infection (approximately 2 weeks), this concentration drops considerably. Therefore, the 

efficacy of gentamicin is observed immediately after implantation of the beads [25]. 

PTMC degrades very slowly by hydrolysis in vitro, however in vivo the degradation of 

PTMC subcutaneously implanted was found to be very fast. This difference suggests that 

enzymes are involved in the degradation process [25]. PTMC is well-known for its 

susceptibility to lipase and cholesterol [33]. 

Previous studies attempted to mimic the in vivo enzymatic degradation of PTMC using 

lipase solutions. In the presence of lipase, PTMC degrades by surface erosion which is 



 

33 

accompanied by a high rate of antibiotic release and has been found to be similar to the 

observed for Septopal® PMMA beads [26]. 

PTMC beads containing 5 wt% gentamicin were made and immersed in lipase solution, 

the release profile (Figure 9) shows a lower gentamicin release when compared with PMMA 

Septopal® beads (immersed in PBS). 

Gentamicin release from PMMA beads are consequently higher than from PTMC beads 

with the same initial gentamicin content. However, the differences observed were not 

statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). PMMA beads show a burst release, namely within the first 24 

h about 30 % is released and this gradually increases to 85 % after 2 weeks. 

In order to reach a similar gentamicin release from the two types of beads, new PTMC 

beads were made with higher gentamicin contents (7.5 wt% instead of 5 wt%). In this case, the 

release profile achieved for PTMC was found to be very close to the PMMA release (Figure 

10), although the gentamicin content in PTMC is higher than in PMMA Septopal®. 

Figure 9. Cumulative gentamicin release from PTMC beads (containing 5 wt % gentamicin) in lipase 

solution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent assays ± 
standard deviation. 



 

34 

Cholesterol esterase is one of the enzymes that has been implicated in the in vivo 

degradation of PTMC [35]. In the Figure 11, a comparison between the release profile of 

gentamicin from PTMC beads (7.5 wt% gentamicin) immersed in lipase solution and immersed 

in cholesterol esterase solution is provided.

solution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent assays ± 

standard deviation. 

 



 

35 

PTMC beads show higher gentamicin release in the presence of lipase solution than in 

cholesterol esterase. Even though, the lipase solution used is much more concentrated (100 U/g) 

compared to the cholesterol esterase solution (30.9 U/mg – which is approximately the same 

concentration that can be found in human blood). PTMC beads should have been made with a 

new adjusted gentamicin concentration to reach a higher release profile in the presence of 

cholesterol esterase. 

Gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads in cholesterol esterase showed a lower release than 

PMMA beads (Figure 12). Gentamicin concentration should be adjusted once again, so we 

could have an antibiotic release from PTMC similar to the one observed from PMMA.

The mode of enzymatic surface erosion by cholesterol esterase and superoxide anion 

radicals, mediated by macrophages, was only recently discovered and PTMC appears to fully 

degrade in bone and assist in promoting bone regeneration [19]. 

The in vivo degradation of PTMC appears to be molecular weight dependent. Previous 

studies have showed that the polymer with greater molecular weight degrades faster in vivo than 

the lower molecular weight. A possible explanation is that a greater hydrophilicity of the lower 

molecular weight surface after aqueous conditioning, alters the conformation of the enzyme 

when absorbed, thus reducing its activity [35].  

In the present work, only one molecular weight for PTMC (556 g/mol) was used, 

nevertheless it would have been interesting to use different molecular weights with different 

degradation rates to evaluate different release profiles for the produced beads. However, due to 

time restrictions and materials availability restrictions this was not possible. 

For drug delivery applications, surface erosion is desirable since it provides controllable 

and sustained high drug release [26]. In this study, PTMC surface eroding was not tested as it 

was not part of our goal. However, the beads could have been weighed before and after release,

esterase solution and PMMA beads in PBS buffer. Results correspond to the average of 3 independent 

assays ± standard deviation.

also scanning electron micrographs could have been taken before and after incubation in 

enzymatic solution to evaluate surface topographies [26]. 

3.2. CLINICALLY ISOLATED STRAINS 

In the current study, 5 different isolated strains from diabetic patients were available. An 

Epsilometer test (Etest®) was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of each strain to gentamicin. 

The strains selected to be further used were the ones with the lowest MIC values and are 

presented in Table 4. 

Table 4. Minimum inhibitory concentration values (µg/mL) for Staphylococcus .aureus and 

Enterobacter cloacae in NB medium without and with the addition of 2.6 g/L of glucose.

The test was performed in medium without and with glucose to assess the glucose effect 

on the sensitivity of each strain to gentamicin. It was possible to conclude that the presence of 

glucose decreases the sensitivity of all strains to gentamicin, which can explain the difficulty 

observed in the treatment of an infection by these strains in diabetic patients exhibiting elevated 

blood glucose levels [9].  

The glucose influence on the biofilm mass and its effect on gentamicin sensitivity has 

also been assessed. 

Growth curves for the selected strains are presented in Figure 13 enabling the 

visualization of the glucose impact in planktonic bacteria.

According to Figure 13, both strains grow faster and to a higher cell density in the 

medium containing glucose. 

3.3. BIOFILM GROWTH 

Biofilm bacteria are phenotypically different from planktonic cells of the same species, 

therefore their response to the environment is different [37].

After selecting the strains and observing the growth of their planktonic bacteria in 

medium with and without glucose, the biofilm behavior of these strains was studied.  

It is known that the biofilm mass increases with increasing glucose concentrations 

through the accessory gene regulatory (agr) pathway. However, few concentrations that span 

the hyperglycemic range of 100 – 500 mg/dL have been studied and no additional details 

regarding the dose response of biofilm formation to glucose levels in the clinically relevant 

range of 20 – 300 mg/dL have been reported [9]. 

Throughout the present study, only one concentration of glucose 260 mg/dL, between 

the relevant range was tested.  

Two different stains were used to evaluate biofilm growth, namely crystal violet staining 

(stains the entire biofilm) and MTT staining (stains only metabolic active and thus living 

bacteria). Both species formed more biofilm when glucose was added to the medium (Figure 

14).

Since the biofilm mass increases in the presence of glucose, it would be important to 

evaluate the response to different concentrations of glucose and the response of a multi-species 

biofilm to these concentrations. It is important to notice that a mono-species biofilm was used in 

the current study. 

Diabetic foot infections are predominantly polymicrobial, the diversity of bacterial 

populations in chronic wounds may be an important contributor to the chronicity of wounds and 

the biofilm mode of growth of the infecting organisms appears to have a great influence on 

chronic wound healing process [2]. Bacterial species interact extensively with each other and 

these interactions determine the structure development of multi-species biofilms [38]. 

Therefore, the reaction to glucose and the response to the prevention and treatment of a multi-

species biofilm would be different from a mono-species one. 

3.3.1. PREVENTION OF BIOFILM GROWTH 

Biofilm prevention was performed with two gentamicin concentrations (5 and 10 

µg/mL) in the presence and without glucose. Strains were seeded for 1 h and immediately after, 

gentamicin was added starting the prevention treatment.

Figure 15 indicates a higher number of cells in the presence of glucose. Nevertheless, 

this number is lower when the gentamicin concentration used is higher, as expected.  

The control (without gentamicin) was used to test the gentamicin effect on the biofilm 

growth. For E. cloacae a reduction in the number of cells was observed, namely from 8.5 to 4.3 

without glucose and from 8.9 to 4.7 with glucose, when 5 µg/mL of gentamicin was added. The 

same outcome was obtained with the higher gentamicin concentration and for S. aureus. A 

reduction with the addition of 5 µg/mL of gentamicin was found from 8.6 to 5.4 without 

glucose and 8.8 to 7.7 with glucose. 

3.3.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILMS 

Biofilms were grown for 24 and 48 h and were further treated with two different 

gentamicin concentrations, 500 and 1000 µg/mL.

was present.

3.4. ANTI-BIOFILM EFFICACY 

A biofilm model was developed by testing the glucose addition and different gentamicin 

concentrations effects. The results were used to design an anti-biofilm strategy to prevent and 

treat the biofilm, using the gentamicin-loaded PTMC beads previously produced and degraded 

in cholesterol esterase. 

3.4.1. PREVENT BIOFILM GROWTH 

The release profile of gentamicin from PTMC loaded beads in cholesterol esterase 

solution showed a release of approximately 100 µg/mL. The beads were kept in a cholesterol 

esterase solution (78 mL) until a final release gentamicin concentration of approximately 7.5 

µg/mL was reached. The elution media of the beads was used to prevent biofilm growth for 24 

h and was applied after 1 h of pre-culture seeded (Figure 18).

A reduced number of cells was observed in the presence of gentamicin compared with 

the control (elution media of PTMC bead without gentamicin). The same trend was observed 

when glucose was added to the medium, namely the biofilm mass was higher. 

Confocal images were taken (Figure 19) only for S. aureus, in order to have a clearer 

result of the gentamicin effect and glucose influence on the biofilm growth.

The glucose presence in the medium increases biofilm mass and the number of living 

cells is visibly higher (Figure 19 A). When gentamicin is added to the medium there is a 

reduction in the number of cells, even though this was not so pronounced when glucose was 

present. The strain recognizes the hostile environment and forms clusters in an attempt to 

protect itself from the antibiotic (Figure 19 B).  

3.4.2. TREATMENT OF BIOFILM 

Biofilm treatment with PTMC loaded beads was compared wit h PMMA Septopal® 

beads and S. aureus was the only strain tested. The treatment was performed for 24 h and 48 h.  

In these experiments, the beads were used directly to treat the biofilm. These were 

placed in the wells where the biofilm was grown, together with the cholesterol esterase 

degradation solution (in the cases where PTMC beads were used). 

After 24 h of treatment (Figure 20), the results suggest that PMMA beads are more 

efficient in the biofilm treatment, being more evident in the situation where no glucose was 

added to the medium. 



 

49 

The treatment proceed for another 24 h (Figure 21) and in this case, PTMC completely 

eradicated the biofilm when glucose was not present, thus appearing to be more effective than 

PMMA Septopal® beads.

In the presence of glucose, the treatment with both beads was similar. However, this was 

not tested in the assays designed for studying the biofilm prevention. The glucose effect, 

augmenting biofilm mass, was notable once again. 

The glucose influence on the biofilm growth was only tested in vitro and the culture 

medium used did not include many of the dissolved proteins or antibacterial peptides that are 

commonly present in the human blood and extracellular fluids [9]. This is a limitation of this 

study since it is not known yet, the effect of this environment on the findings herein reported. 

Moreover, most of the biofilm experiments were not performed in triplicate due to time 

restrictions and therefore, no statistical analyses could be done. 

Furthermore, in vivo the treatment with the beads would take approximately 2 weeks. 

However, in this model the beads were only tested for 2 days at most, so the anti-biofilm 

efficacy is expected to be increased by prolonging the treatment period.  

In this study, we used two different bacterial strains, the Gram-positive cocci S. aureus 

and the Gram-negative rods E. cloacae. From the results gathered, it was possible to observe

that comparing with E. cloacae, the S. aureus biofilm is more affected with the presence of 

glucose and that this strain is more sensitive to gentamicin. 

PTMC and PMMA Septopal® beads surface was not analyzed after the experiments. 

However, in the future it would be interesting to study the interaction between biofilm and the 

beads.

Chapter 4. Conclusions and Future Perspectives 

In the current work, gentamicin loaded PTMC beads were made with the same size as 

PMMA Septopal® beads. The release profile of both beads was compared and this release was 

optimized for the PTMC beads by adjusting the gentamicin content so their release would 

match the one found in the PMMA beads.  

The release profile for PTMC beads was studied in the presence of concentrated lipase 

solution mimicking the in vivo release, as well as in the presence of cholesterol esterase an 

enzyme involved in the degradation of PTMC and that can be found in the human body. 

PTMC holds a great potential to be used as a drug delivery device due to its surface 

eroding degradation that allows the release of small and large compounds. The polymer also 

permits the combination of antibiotics which is not possible with the PMMA Septopal® beads. 

Diabetic patients have high blood glucose level which seems to increase the 

pathogenicity of infecting microbes through a greater biofilm formation. This study also aimed 

to evaluate the biofilm response to a specific glucose concentration. It was possible to conclude 

that the mass of the biofilm increased when 2.6 g/L of glucose was added to the culture medium 

although, in the future, it would be important to test this response to different glucose 

concentrations and in different growth media to extend the conclusions herein drawn. The 

comparison between the biofilm mass when grown in a normal glucose level and at a high 

glucose level should also be pursued. 

The biofilm model developed showed that S. aureus and E. cloacae biofilm mass 

increased when glucose was added to the culture medium, resulting in reduced gentamicin 

sensitivity. This fact contributes to the difficulty in treating the diabetic foot osteomyelitis.

A similar release profile and biofilm inhibition between PTMC beads and PMMA 

Septopal® was possible to achieve, hence the former polymer seems a very promising 

biodegradable carrier for the in situ treatment of osteomyelitis.
