Abstract 

 

Soil apparent electrical conductivity is being considerably used as a surrogate measure for soil 

properties and hydraulic parameters. In this study, measurements of electrical conductivity were 

accomplished with Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and EM38 to develop the multiple 

datasets for defining spatiotemporal moisture content changes and also estimating the hydraulic 

properties of unsaturated soil under natural conditions and water injection test in two different 

sites.  

The First study was conducted at the campus of University of Lisbon in a location where had a 

loam soil, low permeability and high water retention capacity and the second site was a sandy 

soil with high permeability and low water retention capacity located in the east of Lisbon. 

Appropriate relationships were derived based on the determination of the experimental curve ? 

vs. S by in-situ investigation to convert the electrical conductivity maps inferred from ERT and 

Em38 data to moisture content distribution images. In addition, the subsurface temperature 

variations during the experiment was measured and the effect of temperature variations over 

ERT images were removed by assuming 2% change in electrical resistivity per°C change in 

temperature. 

To estimate the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil, flow simulations were firstly developed 

based on Richards’ equation and the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of van 

Genuchten parametric models. Afterward, Uncoupled and coupled hydrogeophysical approaches 

were used in order to constrain the van Genuchten parameters.

Resumo 

 

A condutividade eléctrica tem sido frequentemente usada na investigação das propriedades e de 

parâmetros hidráulicos do solo. Neste estudo, foram realizadas medições de condutividade 

eléctrica usando a tomografia eléctrica (ERT) e o instrumento EM38, para a construção de uma 

base de dados a utilizar na avaliação das variações espacial e temporal das propriedades 

hidráulicas da camada não saturada do solo, em condições naturais e sujeito a um teste de 

injecção. Os estudos foram realizados em dois locais distintos. 

 

O primeiro estudo foi realizado no Campus da Universidade de Lisboa, num terreno argiloso, 

com baixa permeabilidade e com uma elevada capacidade de retenção de água. O segundo 

estudo foi realizado num local com um solo arenoso, com permeabilidade elevada e fraca 

capacidade de retenção de água, localizado a leste de Lisboa. A partir dos modelos calculados 

dos dados de ERT e EM38, e de resultados laboratoriais de amostras colhidas nos locais, foram 

obtidas relações experimentais entre a resistividade e o conteúdo de água no solo. Estas relações 

foram posteriormente usadas para a conversão dos modelos ERT e EM38 em mapas de conteúdo 

de água. A temperatura em profundidade foi também medida durante a realização dos perfis. 

Estes valores foram usados para corrigir os dados de ERT, assumindo uma variação de 2% no 

valor da resistividade pela variação da temperatura, de 1º Celsius. 

 

Foram realizadas simulações de fluxo de água, baseadas na equação de Richard, considerando os 

parâmetros de van Genuchten para a representação da retenção de condutividade hidráulica do 

solo, com  o objectivo de obter estimativas das propriedades hidráulicas da camada não saturada 

do solo.

1.1. Introduction 

 

The importance of soil characterization in the top 1-2 meters is widely recognized as a key 

parameter in agriculture and is critical in determining crop productivity through its impact on 

germination and growth of the plants. Development of the means to monitor soil moisture 

spatiotemporally in agricultural fields is very important for effective soil moisture management. 

Moreover, hydraulic conductivity is an important soil property when determining the potential 

for water movement in topsoil and in spite of its importance; soil hydraulic conductivity remains 

one of the most difficult of soil properties to assess and laboratory methods have limitations due 

to the size of the samples and usually in-situ methods are required to estimate hydraulic 

conductivity. Recent researches have shown that geophysical surveys using non-invasive and 

cost-effective methods are a viable alternative to direct and invasive measurements techniques 

for hydrologic characterization. Direct methods are based on drilling and cause major 

disturbance to the natural conditions. In addition, direct measurements by sample collection 

cannot be repeated over time on the same place, while hydrologic characterization of topsoil 

requires a repetition of data collection from a specified field site. Moreover, direct measurements 

do not usually cover a large area allowing only localized investigation which might cause 

uncertainty in hydrologic characterization of unsaturated zone. Geophysical methods, 

particularly ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) (e.g. 

Binley et al., 2001, 2002a, 2002b; Cassiani et al., 2004; Binley and Kemna, 2005; Looms et al. 

2008a, 2008b) and also Electromagnetic methods (EM) (e.g. McNeill 1986; Williams and Hoey, 

1987; Kachanoski et al. 1988; Brevik and Fenton, 2002; Hezarjaribi and Sourell, 2007; 

Triantafilis and Santos, 2009, 2010) have been widely used to investigate the unsaturated zone.  

Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by ERT and EM methods is a surrogate 

measure for soil properties and can be correlated with soil properties such as cation exchange 

capacity (e.g. Triantafilis et al. 2009), depth to bedrock and soil texture (e.g. Zhu et al., 2010), 

clay content and salinity (e.g. Corwin and Lesch, 2005) or moisture content (e.g. Binley et al., 

2001)  by empirical or semiempirical relationships (e.g. Archie, 1942) or established in-situ 

relationships (e.g. Binley et al., 2002a). Consequently, resistivity changes interpretation might be 

complicated unless variation in resistivity is dominated by one of these parameters.

Time-lapse geophysical monitoring is also a powerful tool to estimate those hydrologic variables 

that are time dependent such as water movement or hydraulic conductivity (e.g. Deiana et al., 

2007). The major aim of time-lapse monitoring is to identify changes in resistivity at selected 

locations at different times accurately. This method is widely used to track tracer migration (e.g. 

Daily et al., 1992; Kemna et al., 2002; Slater and Sandberg, 2000, Singha and Gorelick, 2006; 

Vanderborght et al., 2005) monitor infiltration (e.g. Barker and Moore, 1998; Binley et al., 

2002a; French and Binley, 2004; Dienna et al. 2007; Looms et al. 2008a, 2008b), underground 

steam injection (Ramirez et al., 1993); trichloroethylene remediation (Daily and Ramirez, 1995) 

and environmental studies to monitor the remediation and migration of contaminants (Hayley et 

al., 2009; LaBrecque et al., 1996a; Shima et al., 1996).  

Selecting appropriate method and devise and designing a suitable configuration depends on 

several factors such as the depth of investigation, required accuracy and the site specification. 

Many researchers (e.g. van Overmeeren et al., 1997; Huisman et al., 2001, 2002; Cassiani et al., 

2006) could successfully monitor the unsaturated zone by ground surface geophysical 

measurements where the depth of investigation was not deeper than a few meters below ground. 

As pointed out by Binley and Kemna, (2005) and discussed in Dienna et al. (2007), ground 

surface geophysical measurements is easier to achieve rather than borehole geophysical 

measurements which requires purpose-drilled boreholes and good contact between electrodes 

and formations and also requires less sophisticated data acquisition. Processing techniques are 

usually less time consuming and complex; however, ground surface geophysical measurements 

is rarely applied to the study of vadose-zone processes deeper than a few meters because of the 

limited sensitivity at depth.  

In this study, measurements of ECa was accomplished by ground surface ERT and multi-height 

EM38 under natural condition and forced infiltration experiment to provide an insight into 

spatiotemporal soil moisture distribution and estimate hydrological parameters particularly 

hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soil. We also investigated the EM38 quality and precision 

in monitoring ECa changes in comparison with ERT images.

1.2. Thesis aim and objectives 

The main aim of this thesis is to explore the potential of ERT and EM38 for soil moisture 

determination and hydraulic conductivity estimation in unsaturated zone.  To achieve the main 

aim, the key thesis objectives were to: 

1. Two filed sites with different soil texture were selected to conduct geophysical 

measurements in topsoil. The first field site is a loam soil with low permeability and high 

water retention capacity while the second study was conducted in a deep Arenosol soil 

with high permeability and a low water retention capacity. 

 

2. A capacitance sensor was used to monitor moisture content variations during the 

experiment in order to control the geophysical approach. 

 
3. Studies of moisture content soil distribution in topsoil and water movement under forced-

infiltration experiment were conducted using time-lapse ground surface ERT and multi 

height EM38. 

 

4. In-situ relationships were derived based on the determination of the ECa and moisture 

content to convert the ECa changes to moisture content changes. 

 
5. The subsurface temperature variations during the water–injection test were measured by 

using suitably placed sensors and the effect of the temperature variations over ERT 

images was removed. 

 
6. Unsaturated flow model were simulated in order to estimate the hydraulic conductivity 

and constrain the hydrological model through a comparison of flow simulations with 

time-lapse geophysical images. 

 
7. The mass loss, centre-of-mass vertical motion and vertical spread of geophysical images 

were evaluated using moment analysis. 

 
8. A 1D coupled geoelectric-infiltration model was developed in order to estimate hydraulic 

conductivity.

2.2. Site description 

2.2.1. Campus of University of Lisbon 
A field site with 20m length and 2m width was established to conduct the experiment on a 2m 

unsaturated soil. A tipping bucket rain gauge (Young Model 52202) was installed to measure the 

amount of precipitation over the period of experiment. The evaporation data was also collected 

from a nearby station to take in account for moisture content simulation. Transpiration amount 

was negligible in the field site.The study was carried out from September 2010 to August 2011. 

The mean maximum and minimum temperatures during the experiment period are shown in Fig. 

2.3. In winter, the temperature occasionally dropped as low as 5 °C. The coldest month was 

January with monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 14 °C and 9 °C. In 

summer, the temperature never exceeded 36 °C. The hottest month was Augusts with monthly 

mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 28 °C and 18°C. The monthly total rainfall and 

evaporation during the experiment are shown in Fig. 2.4.  December had the highest monthly 

total rainfall with 294.5 mm (Figure 2.4) and an average of 17 rainy days. June and July were 



9 
 

almost without rainfall. The maximum total evaporation was observed in June with a total 

amounting to 101.9 mm. December had the lowest total evaporation.

3. Materials and Methods 

Studies of water movement in the unsaturated sandstone were conducted using ground surface 

ERT and EM methods. We discuss the following aspects: 1) ERT and EM methods in 

monitoring of unsaturated zone, 2) inversion process, 3) unsaturated flow simulation, 4) moment 

analysis, 5) soil test methods, 6) field sensors for soil moisture measurement and 7) temperature 

influence in ERT and EM data. 

 

3.1.  EM methods 
EM sensors typically integrate the below-ground response to interrogate electromagnetic fields, 

and if the depth response function of the probe is known, the potential exists to invert the 

integrated response to give a depth profile of the driving soil attribute (for example electrical 

conductivity). The EM technique was initially introduced for measuring and mapping soil 

salinity (Halvorson and Rhoades, 1974; McNeill, 1986; Wollenhaupt et al., 1986) and was 

extended to quantifying and mapping soil moisture content. The relationship between soil 

moisture content and ECa has been established by many investigators (e.g. Sheets and 

Hendrickx, 1995; Hanson and Kaita, 1997; Reedy and Scanlon, 2003; Brevik et al., 2006; 

Hezarjaribi and Sourell, 2007). Hossain, (2008) presented a comprehensive review of EM 

sensors in water content estimation. Different methods were used to calibrate the EM sensors 

against water content. For instance Kachanoski et al. (1988) developed the relationship between 

ECa and moisture content, in a non-saline soil with low concentrations of dissolved electrolytes 

and found that the ECa explained 96% of the spatial variation in the soil moisture (surface to 0.5 

m depth) in a 1.8-ha study area. However, they did not find any significant relationship between 

ECa and moisture content at depths below 0.5 m. Hanson and Kaita, (1997) conducted an 

experiment to observe the response of moisture content in soils of three salinity levels. The R2 

values for the horizontal dipole orientation were 0.81, 0.89, 0.92 for low, medium and high 

salinity level, respectively, and for the vertical dipole orientation were 0.76, 0.94 and 0.95. The 

EM38 was calibrated against neutron probe-based estimates of moisture content. Sherlock and 

McDonnell, (2003) found a good relationship (R2 = 0.70) between ECa and gravimetrically 

determined moisture content from soil samples taken at a depth of 0.2 m. The same relationship 

was observed by Brevik et al., (2006).

3.1.1.The EM38 

The EM38 is a widely-used electromagnetic instrument for soil characterization developed by 

Geonics Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). It comprises two electrical coils, one a transmitter (Tx) and the 

other a receiver (Rx), placed 1 meter apart in a wooden frame (Fig.3.1). The transmitter coil is 

excited with a sinusoidal current at a frequency of 14.6 kHz that creates a time-varying 

magnetic field in the vicinity of the coil and when activated, the time-varying magnetic field 

induces eddy currents in the soil. The magnitude of the eddy currents is proportional to the 

electrical conductivity of the soil in that layer of the soil (Fig.3.2). Each current loop generates a 

secondary magnetic field proportional to the value of the current flowing within the loop. A 

fraction of the secondary magnetic field from each loop is intercepted by the receiver coil of the 

instrument; the sum of these signals is amplified and formed into an output voltage. The process 

of electromagnetic induction results in a secondary magnetic field which is 90º out of phase 

with the primary field. The sensor coil is designed to measure this out-of-phase component, 

hence the notion of quadrature (Hossain, 2008). At low induction numbers, the apparent 

conductivity ?  in the vicinity of the transmitter coil is determined by the ratio of the 

magnitudes of the out-of-phase secondary to primary magnetic fields using the following 

equation (McNeill, 1980): 

 

?
?? ?                                                                                                                        (3.1) 

where   is the ratio of the out-of-phase secondary to primary magnetic fields, 
(Subscript ‘Q’ denotes quadrature, that is, 90° out of phase) 

? = apparent electrical conductivity 

 ?= 2?f (f = frequency in Hz) 

? = permeability of free space = 4? *  kg m/s2.A2 

s = distance between transmitter and sensing coils or inter-coil spacing and is equal to 1 m in 

EM38 

A = area of the (transmitter) coil

spatial structure of the primary magnetic field during the peak current phase within the transmitter coil and that of 

the secondary magnetic fields generated in response eddy currents generated in the conductive medium. In this 

vertical dipole mode of operation, the primary field lines shown (HP) have cylindrical symmetry around the vertical 

axis (Lamb et al. 2005) 

 

In cylindrical coordinates, the axial and radial components of the primary magnetic field in the 

vicinity of a magnetic dipole are given respectively by (Wait, 1982): 

 

?

    /    /                                                                                     (3.2)

?    /                                                                                                          (3.3) 
 

where,  is the axial component of the magnetic field  

 is the radial component of the magnetic field 

z is the axial distance, along the axis of the field symmetry, from the coil 

r is the radial distance, perpendicular to the axis of field symmetry, from the coil 

A is the area of the (transmitter) coil 

The approximation in (Equation 3.1) holds for both horizontal as well as vertical dipole modes 

(McNeill, 1980).  

A key assumption in understanding the nature of the integrated response of the surface 

measurement of EM instruments like the EM38 is that individual, below ground ‘current loops’ 

are not influenced by others nearby (McNeill, 1980). Consequently, the net secondary magnetic 

field at the receiver is the sum of the independent secondary magnetic fields from each of the 

individual current loops. This gives rise to the notional depth-response of the EM sensor 

according to the relative contributions of secondary magnetic fields arising from different depths 

directly below the sensor. For vertical and horizontal dipole configurations (McNeill, 1980), 

these contributions are given respectively as: 

 

?   /                                                                                                                   (3.4) 
?   /                                                                                                            (3.5)  
 

Here z is the ratio of axial distance below the sensor, and s is inter-coil spacing (1 m). Both of 

these expressions, shown graphically in Figure 3.3(a), are developed from the notion that the 

sensor is placed, regardless of vertical or horizontal dipole mode of operation, on the surface of a 

conductive half-layer, whereby there is no conductive medium above the surface (z &gt; 0) and a 

conductive medium below the surface (z &amp;lt;0) (Hossain, 2008). The exact amplitude and phase of 

the secondary field will differ from those of the primary field as a result of soil properties (e.g. 

clay content, moisture content and salinity), spacing of the coils and their orientation, frequency, 

and distance from the soil surface (Hendrickx et al., 2002). Although Equations 3.4 and 3.5 



17 
 

imply no limit to the penetration depth of EM38, the ‘effective’ measurement depth of operation 

is accepted as 1.5 m and 0.75 m as 70% of the integrated response generated from those depths 

for vertical and horizontal dipole operations respectively (McNeill, 1980). Rhoades and Corwin, 

(1981), on the other hand report that the EM38 is primarily responsive to a depth of 1.2 m 

compared to other depths. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the effective measurement depths 

of EM38 is accepted as being appropriate to agriculture as the depths represent the root zone area 

(Corwin and Lesch, 2005). 

 

3.1.2. Cumulative response of a multilayered earth 
The secondary magnetic field measured at the receiver is the sum of the independent magnetic 

fields from each individual induced current loop. The relative contribution to the secondary 

magnetic field, measured at the receiver, due to the homogeneous material within a thin 

horizontal layer at a depth z was estimated in Equation 3.4 and 3.5 and shown in Fig.3.3a. Then 

the relative contribution to the secondary magnetic field from all material below a depth z can be 

expressed by the cumulative function RH,V (for horizontal or vertical coplanar transmitter–

receiver dipole configurations) as defined by McNeill, (1980): 

 

?
?

                                                                                                                  (3.6) 

 

Taking into account these definitions, the response of an M-layer earth is calculated adding the 

contribution from each layer independently, weighted accordingly to its conductivity and depth 

as: 

 

? ? ? ?                                                    (3.7) 

 

The sum is extended from layer 2 up to layer M-1. ?i represents the conductivity of the ith layer 

and zi is the depth of the ith layer divided by intercoil spacing. The expressions for the functions 

R(Z) are (McNeill, 1980): 

 

  /                                                                                                                      (3.8) 



18 
 

                                                                                                      (3.9) 

  

where Z is the depth z divided by intercoil spacing s. The use of the cumulative function in 

layered-earth models is mainly determined by the low induction number condition that, in a 

homogeneous half-space, happens when the ratio of the transmitter–receiver separation to the 

skin depth is much lesser than 1(McNeill, 1980).

3.1.3. Inversion algorithm 
The nonlinear smoothness-constrained inversion algorithm given in Sasaki (1989) has been 

adopted in this work. Relevant aspects of this algorithm application will be given here (See 

Sasaki (1989) for full description of this algorithm). The earth model used in the inversion 

process consists of a number of blocks whose distribution and size depend on the locations and 

number of intercoil spacing used in data acquisition. A forward modeling subroutine, based on 

the cumulative response explained in 3.1.2 is used to calculate the apparent conductivity 

response of the model. The optimization equations are represented as follows (Sasaki, 1989):

? ? ?                                                                                           (3.10) 

 

where ?p is the vector containing the corrections applicable to the parameters (block 

conductivities, ?j) of an initial model, ?d is the vector of the differences between calculated and 

observed apparent conductivity (y). J is the Jacobian matrix whose elements are given by:  

 
 

?                                                                                                                                      (3.11) 
 

The diagonal matrix W describes the accuracy of the measured data and includes the reciprocals 

of the data variances. The superscript T denotes the transpose operation. The quantity ? is a 

Lagrange multiplier (damping factor, sensu stricto) that controls the amplitude of the parameter 

corrections and whose best value is empirically determined. The elements of the matrix C are the 

coefficients of the values of the roughness in each parameter, which is defined in terms of the 

four neighbors (north, south, east and west), as: 

 

? ? ? ? ? ?                                                                                     (3.12) 

 

that is, the elements of C are -4, 1 or 0. An iterative process allows obtaining the final model, 

with its response fitting the data set in a least square sense. The misfit between data and model 

response is given by: 

 
?  ?                                                                                                                           (3.13) 

 

where N represents the number of data points (Santos, 2004). 

 

3.2. ERT 

3.2.1. Basic resistivity theory 

ERT is the method for calculation of the subsurface resistivity distribution from multiple 

electrical resistance measurements made using a quadrapole arrangement of electrodes (Fig.3.4). 

The electrodes are placed either on the ground surface or in the borehole and a 2-D or 3-D image 



20 
 

of the resistivity can be achieved by varying the location and spacing of the electrodes. The 

fundamental physical law used in resistivity surveys is Ohm’s Law that governs the flow of 

current in the ground. Different quadrapole arrangements of electrodes are used in order to 

images resistivity distribution.  In practically all surveys, the potential difference between two 

points (normally on the ground surface) is measured (Fig.3.4). The potential difference is then 

given by: 

?                                                                                                                                  (3.14) 

?                                                                                                                            (3.15) 
K is a geometric factor that depends on the arrangement of the four electrodes. The calculated 

resistivity value is an apparent resistivity value that is the resistivity of a homogeneous ground 

that will give the same resistance value for the same electrode arrangement. The relationship 

between the apparent resistivity and the true resistivity is a complex relationship and need to be 

achieved using inversion theory (will be briefly discussed 3.2.4) to determine the true subsurface 

resistivity from the apparent resistivity. Figure 3.5 shows the most common arrays used in 

resistivity surveys together with their geometric factors. In our study, we performed 2-D imaging 

surveys using Wenner, Schlumberger and dipole-dipole arrays. Among the characteristics of an 

array usually the depth of investigation, the sensitivity of the array to vertical and horizontal 

changes in the subsurface resistivity and the signal strength are the most important to consider. 

Loke (2001) presented a comprehensive study of different arrays weaknesses and strengths. The 

Wenner array is relatively sensitive to vertical changes in the subsurface resistivity below the 

center of the array. However, it is less sensitive to horizontal changes in the subsurface 

resistivity. In general, the Wenner array is good in resolving vertical changes (i.e. horizontal 

structures), but relatively poor in detecting horizontal changes (i.e. narrow vertical structures). 

The Wenner array has a moderate depth of investigation. The signal strength is inversely 

proportional to the geometric factor used to calculate the apparent resistivity value for the array. 

Among the common arrays, the Wenner array has the strongest signal strength. This can be an 

important factor if the survey is carried in areas with high background noise. In contrast, the 

dipole-dipole array is very sensitive to horizontal changes in resistivity, but relatively insensitive 

to vertical changes in the resistivity. That means that it is good in mapping vertical structures, 



21 
 

such as dykes and cavities, but relatively poor in mapping horizontal structures such as sills or 

sedimentary layers and also this array has the very small signal strength for large values of the 

“n” factor. The voltage is inversely proportional to the cube of the “n” factor. The Schlumberger 

array is moderately sensitive to both horizontal and vertical structures. In areas where both types 

of geological structures are expected, this array might be a good compromise between the 

Wenner and the dipole-dipole array.

3.2.2. 4 point light 10W 

4 point light 10W is a resistivity meters from Lippman company for geoelectric resistivity 

sounding and induced polarization measurement. The devise is high power, very low cost 

induced polarization earth resistivity meter in a small package (Fig.3.6) and covers Schlumberger 

soundings up to AB/2 = 1km. It is suitable for mapping, monitoring and laboratory works. 

Geotest software is a software package (Fig.3.7) for remote controlling of 4 point light 10W in 

combination with active boxes (Fig.3.8) for geoelectric tomography using multi-electrodes 

(Fig.3.9). Two electrodes serve as current emitting electrodes and are usually named A and B. 

Two other electrodes (M and N) measure the potential difference (Fig.3.7).

? ? ?                                                                                                                (3.17)

The following relation also exists between kernel function and raised kernel function:  

? ? ? ?                                                                                                 (3.18) 

where H(?) is raised kernel function. 

The ERT surveys were carried out using Schlumberger electrode configuration in forced-

infiltration experiment for development of 1D coupled geoelectric-infiltration and therefore, 

numerical solution for this array will be discussed here briefly which will be used in chapter 6. 

For Schlumberger electrode configuration using Equation (3.16) we have: 

?
?

? ? ? ?                                                                                                      (3.19) 

where s is half the current electrode spacing. 

An explicit expression for the resistivity transform can be obtained by applying Hankel's 

inversion (see Watson, 1966) of the Fourier-Bessel integral to the expression of the apparent 

resistivity in the Schlumberger arrangement given by: 



26 
 

 

? ?

? ? ?                                                                                              (3.20) 

New variables are introduced defined by: 

?                                                                                           (3.21) 

Substituting (3.21) in (3.20) we have: 

? ?
?
?                                                                                               (3.22) 

This is a convolution integral relating the input ?  to the output T(y). In the frequency domain 

the input-output relationship given by (3.22) takes the simple algebraic form since that the ?  and 

T functions belong to a linear system (Robinson, 1967): 

F (f) = Gs (f) Hs (f)                                                                                                                  (3.23) 

where   F(f)              T(y); Gs (f)            ?   

Hs(f) = Frequency characteristic of the resistivity filter, or simply the filter characteristic.  

The symbol             denotes a Fourier transform pair. 

To determine the filter characteristic, following partial resistivity function for the Schlumberger 

system was chosen whose exact resistivity transform was known (Koefoed, 1968).  

 

 ?                                                                                      (3.24) 

                                                                                       (3.25) 

Their Fourier transforms are then found by numerical integration, and the modulus Q(f) and 

phase ?(f) of the quotient F/G determine H. For a given sampling interval ?x the Nyquist 

frequency is fN = 1/(2?x) , and the corresponding sinc-response function is given by: 
 ? ?                                                                               (3.26) 

 



27 
 

The apparent resistivity ?  in the sampling points xi = i?x is then given approximately by: 

? ?       ? ?                                                                        (3.27) 
where  and are chosen so that the filter coefficients with smaller or larger indices can be 

neglected. As the expression of the apparent resistivity function is complicated, the Fourier 

transform of the T(y) functions were first determined and the Fourier transform of the apparent 

resistivity functions were then obtained from it by the application of (3.23) (Ghosh, 1971). 

Fourier transform of the T(y) functions were estimated in Johansen, (1975). Apart from the 

sampling frequency there are two factors affecting the accuracy: the tails of the filter must be cut 

off at some point, and the coefficients can only be calculated with a limited precision. The 

analysis of the asymptotic behavior (demonstrated in Johansen, 1975) indicates that j= (-100) – 

(40) fulfills the expectations. The filter coefficients corresponding to a sampling frequency of 10 

points per decade were calculated in Johansen, (1975) and the actual precision of the filter was 

also tested and proved in the same way as suggested by Ghosh, (1971). 

 

3.2.4. 1D resistivity inversion  

Let the m-dimensional vector p (pl, p2... pn) stand for the m = 2N-1 resistivities and thicknesses 

(?1, dl, ... , ?N) i.e. 

                                                                                          (3.29) 

                                                                                    (3.30) 

And  

                                                            (3.31)

Let Yi be the measured values of ?app at abscissas ?i, i= 1, ... , n. Let us assume that the logarithm 

of Yi has a normal distribution for each abscissa ?i with standard deviation independent of i 

(Johansen, 1977). Our problem is to minimize: 

 

?                                                                                     (3.32) 



28 
 

with respect to xj = In Pj,  j = 1, ... , m. 

From the trial-and-error procedure we have a starting model x which is hopefully not too far 

from the optimum solution x0 which minimizes Q. Expanding in  in a Taylor series around x 

and discarding all terms of order higher than the first we get : 

?     ?                                                          (3.33) 
 and its partial derivatives with respect to (Pj) are calculated by the linear filter method 

(Johansen,  I975) discussed in 3.2.3 . The connection to the partial derivatives involved here is 

established by: 

                                                                                                                  (3.34) 
Minimization of (3.34) determines a correction vector ? . The process is repeated with x set to x 

+ ?  until there is no further decrease in Q, that is when x = xo. 

 

3.2.5. 2D Resistivity forward modeling and inversion 

The inversion of resistivity data will be carried out using RES2DINV. RES2DINV is a computer 

program that will automatically determine a two dimensional (2-D) resistivity model for the 

subsurface for the data obtained from electrical imaging surveys (Griffiths and Barker, 1993). 

This program is designed to invert large data sets collected with a system with a large number of 

electrodes. The 2-D model used by the inversion program, which consists of a number of 

rectangular blocks, is shown in Figure 3.10. The arrangement of the blocks is loosely tied to the 

distribution of the data points in the pseudosection. The distribution and size of the blocks is 

automatically generated by the program using the distribution of the data points as a rough guide. 

The depth of the bottom row of blocks is set to be approximately equal to the equivalent depth of 

investigation (Edwards, 1977) of the data points with the largest electrode spacing. The survey is 

usually carried out with a system where the electrodes are arranged along a line with a constant 

spacing between adjacent electrodes. A forward modeling subroutine is used to calculate the 

apparent resistivity values, and a non-linear least-squares optimization technique is used for the 



29 
 

inversion routine (deGroot-Hedlin and Constable, 1990; Loke and Barker, 1996). The program 

supports both the finite-difference and finite-element forward modeling techniques and covers 

Wenner, pole-pole, dipole-dipole, pole-dipole, Wenner-Schlumberger and equatorial dipole-

dipole (rectangular) arrays. In addition to these common arrays, the program even supports non-

conventional arrays with an almost unlimited number of possible electrode configurations (Loke, 

2001)

3.3.Time-lapse Inversion 

The major aim of time-lapse inversion is to identify changes in resistivity at selected locations at 

different times accurately. Independent data inversions can be carried out separately and changes 

in ERT images with time can be obtained by simply subtraction of pixel-by-pixel values from a 

background image, but in most cases, changes over time do not guarantee that the differences in 

resistivity values are only due to actual changes in the subsurface resistivity without taking the 

reference model and priori information into account Deiana et al. (2007). Different time-lapse 

inversion techniques are proposed to achieve accurate images of electrical conductivity 



30 
 

variations. The ratio method, the difference inversion and the cross-model regularization are 

commonly used in time-lapse inversion methods.  

The ratio method was proposed by Daily et al. (1992). In this method, ratios of initial and 

subsequent datasets are inverted to highlight the areas of resistivity changes. This method has 

been widely used to monitor resistivity changes (e.g. Binley et al., 2002b). Presenting a 

quantitative resistivity change estimates are difficult for interpretation of petrophysical models, 

but this approach can give a qualitative indication where resistivity changes are occurring 

(Hayley et al. 2011) 

LaBrecque and Yang, (2001) proposed the difference inversion method. This method minimizes 

the misfit between the difference in two datasets and the difference between two model 

responses and smoothness is imposed directly on the time-lapse model change. This approach 

has been used for instance by Kemna et al. (2002) for tracer test monitoring and by Diena et al. 

(2007) for characterization of vadose zone via water injection. 

The crossmodel regularization assumes that the material changes can be ignored during data 

collection and therefore a time-invariant static model is used in this method. The inversion result 

of an initial dataset is used as a reference model for the inversion of subsequent datasets (Loke, 

1999; Oldenborger et al., 2007) in this approach. This method minimizes the changes in the EC 

image that are not supported by data through adding a constraint that the second inversion result 

should be similar to the first. Both crossmodel inversion and difference inversion require an 

independent inversion of the first dataset. Therefore, artifacts in the initial independent inversion 

will introduce artifacts into the time-lapse inversion. Moreover, LaBrecque et al. (1996b) noticed 

that the initial dataset collected with permanently installed electrodes was the nosiest, thus, using 

these methods will cause serious consequence if the initial dataset includes considerable level of 

noise. 

Hayley et al. (2011) presented a comprehensive comparison of the above mentioned methods 

using the results of two examples. The authors found out that the ratio method is very sensitive to 

noise. They also reported the difficulties they had with crossmodel regularization to not 

introduce anomalies into the difference image due to differences in the resolution of the 

background structure between the two inversions and necessity of heavy regularization to 



31 
 

overcome this weakness. They found that the difference inversion approach produces the best 

resolution of time-lapse changes among the commonly used approach and less susceptible to 

noise than the ratio method and crossmodel regularization. They mentioned that a careful 

selection of inversion parameters in the first inversion should be taken to resolve the background 

structure and avoid introducing artifacts into the difference inversion. 

Kim et al. (2009) defined a subsurface structure and the entire monitoring data in the space–time 

domain to obtain a four-dimensional space–time model using just one inversion process. They 

developed a new least-squares inversion algorithm that allows for the subsurface properties to 

continuously change in time. They introduced the regularizations not only in the space domain 

but also in time, resulting in reduced inversion artifacts and improved stability of the inverse 

problem. The algorithm was designed to provide reasonable subsurface images even if changes 

in the subsurface properties during the data acquisition cannot be ignored.  

 

3.4.Electrical conductivity of Soils 

Electric current flows in earth materials at shallow depths through two main methods namely 

electronic conduction and electrolytic conduction. In electronic conduction, the current flow is 

via free electrons, such as in metals while, in electrolytic conduction, the current flow is via the 

movement of ions in groundwater. In our study for soil characterization, electrolytic conduction 

is the main mechanism. Sedimentary rocks usually have resistivity range from 10 to about 10000 

?.m, with most values below 1000 ?.m. Unconsolidated sediments generally have lower 

resistivity values than sedimentary rocks; with values ranging from about 10 to less than 1000 

?.m. Clayey soil normally has a lower resistivity value than sandy soil. However, the overlaps in 

the resistivity values of the different classes of soils are usually expected. This is because the 

resistivity of a particular rock or soil sample depends on a number of factors such as the porosity, 

the degree of water saturation and the concentration of dissolved salts.  

The widely used relationship between resistivity and soil moisture is expressed as (Archie, 1942) 

                                                                                                                    (3.35) 



32 
 

where a, m, and n are petrophysical constants that are characteristic of the porous medium,  is  

the resistivity of the porous medium,  is the pore-water resistivity, ? is the porosity, and S is 

saturation, which is the ratio of the water content and porosity. During an infiltration event, the 

moisture content of a geological medium is generally the only factor that undergoes dramatic 

changes, and the changes in resistivity can be related to changes in moisture content.  

 

3.5.  Hydrologic Model 

3.5.1. Governing Flow Equation  
Richards’ equation is used to describe variably saturated flow in porous media. Three-

dimensional Richards’ equation can be expressed as: 

                                          (3.36) 

where h [L] is pressure head, z [L] is elevation, ? is volumetric moisture,  and  are 

the horizontal and vertical unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [L/T] respectively as a function of 

pressure head. The system is isotropic if . Equation (3.36) must be supplemented 

with relevant constitutive models linking h, ? and K.  

 

3.5.2. The Unsaturated Soil Hydraulic Properties 
The unsaturated soil hydraulic properties, ?(h) and K(h), in (3.36) are in general highly nonlinear 

functions of the pressure head. Five different analytical models for the hydraulic properties were 

proposed by Brooks and Corey, (1964); van Genuchten, (1980); Vogel and Císlerová, (1988); 

Kosugi, (1995) and Durner, (1994) and commonly used in flow simulations. We assume here 

that the retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be represented by the parametric 

models of van Genuchten, (1980) who used the statistical pore-size distribution model of 

Mualem, (1976) to obtain a predictive equation for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 

function in terms of soil water retention parameters:

Where ?s is the saturated water content, ?r is the residual water content, defined as the water 

content for which the gradient ?  becomes zero, ? and n are empirical parameters and Ks is 

the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Simunek et al, 2006). Therefore, to achieve an infiltration 

model, all five van Genuchten´s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) must be first estimated. These 

parameters were estimated by using the Rosetta software (Schaap et al. 2001). Rosetta 

implements pedotransfer functions based on artificial neural networks which predict water 

retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity from soil textural data and bulk density. In 

addition, we also used mini disk infiltrometer to evaluate these parameters in our study in the 

field.

The Richards’ equation can be solved based on either h- or ?- form of the Richards equation to 

describe flow in a variably saturated soil. (e.g. Davis and Neuman, 1983; Huyakorn et al., 1983, 

1989; Hills et al., 1989; Kool and Van Genuchten, 1991; Kirkland et al., 1992). A limitation of 

the ? -based formulation is that this form cannot be used to describe flow in the saturated zone, 

and flow in layered soils is also not easily simulated. The h-based formulation of (3.39) is 

considered to be more useful for practical problems involving flow in layered or spatially 

heterogeneous soils, as well as for variably saturated flow problems. Unfortunately, simulation 

of infiltration using the h-based formulation also often faces difficulties in conserving mass. 

(Haung et al. 1995) 



34 
 

In this study, h-based formulation was used to develop a 1d coupled geoelectric-infiltration 

model for unsaturated hydraulic parameters characterization and we briefly discuss how to 

numerically solve Equation (3.39) using h-based formulation by finite difference approach. 

The water content, ? in Equation (3.39) is dependent on the pressure head, h. Therefore  term 

can be expressed as  . The  term is equal to c(h) and is the water capacity (1/m). Let 

retention and hydraulic conductivity functions can be represented by (3.37) and (3.38). 

Therefore, c(h) can be expressed by: 

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.40) 

 

we added 10-20 to the function to aid in the numerical solution, which can be sensitive to values 

of c(h) = 0.  

Using the definition of total head, H = z+h, and applying    term to equation (3.39), we get 

the flowing expression of 1d Richards’ equation: 

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.41) 

The ordinary finite difference was applied to get following equation: 

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.42) 

where Kim is the mean conductivity between the grid points at zi and zi-1, and Kip is the mean 

conductivity between the grid points at zi+1 and zi .We should estimate an average of the values 

of Ki-1 and Ki for Kim and Ki and Ki+1 for Kip, to calculate flow from Darcy's law between zi-1 and 

zi. The arithmetic means, Kim = (Ki-1+Ki)/2 and Kip = (Ki+Ki+1)/2 were used in this approach. 

Because of the time-stepping method we use here, all the other variables, ci and Ki, are taken

from the values of hij and j and j+1 time levels are only given to the pressure head. In a truly 

implicit solution, j time level solution would all be taken from the j+1 time level.  The only way 

to numerically solve (3.42) is to repeatedly calculate the time step, each time recalculating the 

values of ci and Ki with the updated values of hij+1 until solution converges to a fixed limit 

(Barker and Scott, 1998). The tridiagonal system of equations away from the boundaries may be 

rearranged to:   

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.43) 

where rzz = ?t/?z2 and rz = ?t/?z.  

We will assume that the bottom boundary at z0 is a constant pressure head, h0, therefore for 

bottom boundary, the equation is expressed by:  

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.44) 

 

The infiltration flow at the upper boundary condition requires special treatment. We consider that 

the mean flow between two grid points zi and zi+1. Since, the space steps, ?z, are uniform; we 

center qi+1/2 halfway between. In order to put the infiltration, qinf, at the soil surface, the 

coordinate system was shifts up by ?z/2 (Barker and Scott, 1998). This does not change the 

finite difference equations, but changes our interpretation of where they solve. 

 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.45) 

The Mass Balance equation above shows how this approach works. We replace only the flow 

between znp-1 and znp-2 with Darcy's law, leaving the soil surface flow, qinf, intact. Therefore after   

proper substitutions into equation (3.43) for the top boundary, we get the following equation:

All flows are positive upwards in our coordinate system, so the infiltration flow, qinf, must be 

negative during rain and positive for evaporation.  

As was discussed, the head-based approach used in this study, is known to produce mass balance 

errors. In other words, the change in water content does not match the net inflow. Celia et al. 

(1987) and Celia et al. (1990) proposed a mass-conservative numerical scheme to solve the 

mixed-form Richards equation: 

                                                                                                                                                  (3.47) 

 

The modified Picard method solves the mixed-q/h-form of Richards’ equation. The mixed form 

of the Richards equation was thought to maintain the mass conservative property inherent in the 

?-based equation, while providing solutions in terms of the pressure head, h.  

 

3.5.4. HYDRUS Package 
HYDRUS is a general software package for simulating water, heat, and solute movement in two- 

and three- dimensional variably saturated media (Simunek et al., 2006). The software package 

consists of the computation computer program, and the interactive graphics-based user interface. 

The HYDRUS program numerically solves the Richards equation for saturated unsaturated water 

flow and the convection-dispersion equation for heat and solute transport. The Galerkin finite 

element method (Neuman, 1975; Zienkiewicz, 1977; Pinder and Gray, 1977) with linear basis 

functions is used to obtain a solution of the flow in equation (3.36) subject to the imposed initial 

and boundary conditions. The HYDRUS code uses the mass conservative method proposed by 

Celia et al. (1990).

3.5.5.  Mini disk infiltrometer 
Mini disk infiltrometers are being considerably used for in-situ measurement of the unsaturated 

hydraulic properties of soil. These data are commonly used to evaluate the saturated and 

unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Simunek and van Genuchten, (1996) discussed on how to 

estimate parameters in van Genuchten’s model of the unsaturated soil-hydraulic properties from 

observed cumulative infiltration data during transient water flow. They showed that the 

infiltration data measured at only a constant tension does not yield enough information to 

estimate more than 2 parameters. They also showed how information could improve the 

uniqueness of the solution. Simunek and van Genuchten, (1997) continued their study with 

considering several different scenarios with using different additional information and concluded 

that the best practical scenario is to estimate the parameters in van Genuchten’s model from the 

cumulative infiltration curve measured at several consecutive tensions applied to the soil surface, 

in conjunction with knowledge of the initial and final water content. We used the DISC computer 

software (developed by Simunek and Van Genuchten, 2000) for analyzing the cumulative 

infiltration curve. A Marquardt-Levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm is used in this 

software for inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties from measured transient cumulative 

infiltration and related data. 

 

3.6. Moment analysis 

2D spatial moments were calculated from the resistivity images according to 

                                                                                              (3.48) 

The zeroth, first and second spatial moments correspond to i + j + k = 0, 1, and 2, respectively. 

?  is the water content changes based on the resistivity changes estimation (inferred from time-

lapse ERT images), where the background water content has been removed.  is the volume of 

interest (For a full description of moment analysis, see e.g. Ye et al., 2005). 

In moment analysis, the mass of the system and location of the center of mass and how the mass 

spread at consecutive times is quantified. The zeroth moment, M00, is the mass in the system. 

The first moment, M01 normalized by the mass, defines the vertical center of mass and finally 



38 
 

the spread of the mass about its centre is related to the second spatial moment. For instance, the 

vertical spread of water in flow direction is defined using following equation: 

                                                                                                                        (3.49) 
 

3.7. Soil test 

Soil texture test is a qualitative classification tool to determine the Particle-size distribution 

(PSD) for soils. The texture of the soil depends on the relative sizes and shapes of the particles, 

and the distribution of those sizes. The classes are separated by the relative proportions of sand, 

silt and clay using grading sieves. The class is then used to determine the soils responses to 

environmental and management conditions and also crop suitability. Based on the textures the 

soil can be divided into two coarse (sand and gravel) and fine (silt and clay) grained soils groups. 

The particle-size separation was carried out in two following steps: 

 
3.7.1.  Sieve Analysis 

 
Standard set of sieves are used to divide sand into classes, and to separate sand fractions from silt 

and clay fractions in the soil. The silt and clay fractions cannot be distinguished from one 

another by sieve analysis. For soil sieving analysis, following steps were performed:  

 

1. The soil samples were mixed with water and then were washed trough the sieves 0.063 

mm. The retained soils on the sieves were collected and oven-dried for sieving analysis. 

2. All pieces of visible organic matter from the soil sample were removed. 

3. Approximately 50 g of each soil sample was weighted and the exact weight (Ws) was 

recorded. 

4. The sieves, with the largest mesh on the top by successively finer meshes beneath were 

placed. Samples were then poured into top sieve. The samples were shaken for 15 

minutes using a shaker. 

5. Residues from each sieve were carefully collected for weighing.  

 

 



39 
 

3.7.2.  Malvern Particle Size Analyzer 
 

To determine the ‘clay to silt ratio’, the fraction of the soil passing through the last (0.063 mm) 

sieve was analyzed using laser granulometer Malvern Particle Size Analyzer MS2000 after 

deflocculating with 30% sodium hexametaphosphate. The principle of operation consists in 

measuring the size of particles using the diffraction and diffusion of a laser beam. These particles 

scatter light at an angle that is inversely proportional to their size. The angular intensity of the 

scattered light is then measured by a series of photosensitive detectors. The map of scattering 

intensity versus angle is the primary source of information used to calculate the particle size.  

 

3.8. Soil moisture measurement  

Methods of soil moisture determination are classified into direct and indirect methods (Muñoz-

Carpena, 2004).  

 

3.8.1. Direct methods 
In direct methods, the weight of a soil sample is measured before and after oven drying. The 

removal of moisture from a soil sample in this process is commonly referred as gravimetric 

moisture content (kg/kg). Measurement of soil bulk density then enables the gravimetric 

moisture content to be converted to volumetric moisture content which is expressed as a volume 

of water in a volume of undisturbed soil (m3/m3) (Hossain, 2008). 

 

3.8.2.  Indirect methods 
Indirect measurement methods are based on the estimation of physical and chemical properties 

of a soil such as electrical conductivity, heat capacity, dielectric constant, hydrogen content or 

magnetic susceptibility that ultimately relates to soil moisture content (Hossain, 2008). 

In this study, a capacitance sensor from Sentek Company was used to monitor moisture content 

variations during the experiment in order to control the geophysical approach. The capacitance 

technique for soil moisture determination involves the measurement of the soil dielectric 

constant by measuring the capacitance between two electrodes of a probe placed into the soil 

profile. The dielectric constant is a measure of the capacity of a non-conducting material to 

transmit electromagnetic waves or pulses. The theory of the capacitance technique was described 

by Dean et al. (1987) and Whalley et al. (1992). The capacitance change of the soil-water-air 



40 
 

matrix is mainly governed by the soil moisture content as the dielectric constant of water is 81, 

much higher than that of other soil components i.e. soil minerals and soil air valued of 2-5 and 1 

respectively (Evett and Steiner, 1995; Muñoz-Carpena, 2004). Therefore, the measurement of the 

dielectric constant of a soil is primarily determined by the volumetric soil moisture content. 

 

3.9. Temperature Changes 

The goal of this experiment is to monitor electrical resistivity changes due to variations in the 

water content in the unsaturated zone. In order to accomplish this, all other transient factors that 

affect the soil must be accounted for. Temperature has a strong influence on the electrical 

conductivity of the subsurface (Sen and Goode, 1992; Waxman and Thomas, 1974). Rein et al. 

(2004) studied the effect of temperature, soil moisture, and temporal variation of the ambient 

ionic concentration on tracer tests, and concluded that even diurnal temperature variations can 

have a relatively large effect. Yet in most time-lapse studies, the influence of temperature 

variations has not been accounted for. Several attempts have clearly accounted for subsurface 

temperature variation in resistivity map (e.g. Hauck, 2002; Michot et al., 2003; Hayley et al., 

2007; Hayley et al., 2009). It is common practice in electrical geophysics to assume a linear 

variation in resistivity with temperature over the typical range of temperatures encountered in 

shallow surveys (Musgrave and Binley, 2011).  Schön, (2004) for instance proposed a 2.5% 

change in electrical resistivity per °C change in temperature. Hayley et al. (2007) using a variety 

of near surface materials found out that the slope of the low temperature linear model is quite 

consistent and a value between 1.8% and 2.2% change in electrical resistivity per ºC change in 

temperature can be used if no other information is available.

4. Study of EM38 and ERT methods at the Campus of University of Lisbon 

Study of the EM38 sensor and ERT were conducted in the campus of university on a loam soil 

with low permeability and high water retention capacity under natural condition and forced-

infiltration experiment in order to monitor moisture content changes and hydraulic conductivity 

estimation. This chapter investigates the result of the EM38 and ERT data to detect and describe 

the soil moisture content. In addition, the ability of the EM38 and ERT methods in hydraulic 

conductivity estimation are evaluated using the flow simulations and EM38 and ERT images 

comparison. 

 

4.1. Soil Test 

Four soil cores down to a depth of approximately 1.5-2m were extracted along the profile in 3 

and 6m in 2-Dec 2010, 9m in 21-Apr 2011 and 12m in 20-June 2011. These cores were 

sectioned into 0.2 m lengths and prepared for laboratory analysis of physical properties namely 

particle density, bulk density, texture and gravimetric moisture content. The texture of extracted 

soil samples from 6 and 9 meters are shown in Fig.4.1 and Fig.4.2. the method discussed in 3.7 

were used to determine soil texture. The particle size distribution analysis of all four boreholes 

indicates a fairly homogeneous soil with Loam texture class composed of 30-50%, 40-50% and 

15-25% concentration of sand, silt and clay respectively. The analysis of the third and fourth 

boreholes in 9 and 12 m shows a slightly greater sand concentration and lower amount of clay 

and silt contents than the first and second borehole. The average concentration of sand, silt and 

clay in the first and second borehole is about 35.5%, 45% and 19.5% respectively while in the 

third and fourth borehole is 41%, 43.5% and 15.5% respectively. Moreover, particle densities for 

the second, fifth and last samples of each core were measured by pycnometer in the lab. The 

estimated particle density was 2.65 with 0.03 tolerances. Bulk density measured using clod 

method was 1.72 with 0.05 tolerances. Therefore, the average porosity is about 35%.

4.2. Geophysical monitoring 

The evolution of the moisture distribution were monitored by the ground surface ERT and multi-

height EM38 surveys since 28-Oct 2010 until 20-Jun 2011. Geophysical surveys were repeated 

weekly. If the equipment were available, ERT and EM38 were collected at the same day. Fig.4.3 

shows a view of geophysical acquisition at field site.

4.2.1. Geoeletrical monitoring  
In this experiment a 2D ground surface ERT survey was performed. Wenner, Schlumberger and 

Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations were employed using 4 point light 10W devise. 

Expansion and electrode spacing were 14.25m and 0.75 respectively. A total of 57, 81 and 153 

measurements were made for each dataset respectively using Wenner, Schlumberger and Dipole-

Dipole electrode configurations. The first ERT dataset in 28-Oct 2010 was inverted so as to 

generate background images. Fig 4.4 presents the results of background image. The modeling 

results indicate smooth resistivity variations along the profile. Greater resistivity values are seen 



45 
 

on the right side of the models where the soil texture analysis indicates lower clay content 

concentration. While there is a high similarity between models generated using Wenner and 

Schlumberger electrode configurations, using a Dipole-Dipole electrode configuration resulted in 

a model that showed greater resistivity values along the profile and a slightly different pattern of 

resistivity.  

In the next step, the time-lapse ERT data was inverted by RES2DINVx32 ver. 3.71. This version 

was developed based on Kim et al. (2009) method. Effect of change in temperature with respect 

to background dataset was removed from all ERT data by applying a value of 2% change per 

degree before inversion. Fig. 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 show the results of resistivity inversions in terms of 

percentage resistivity changes with respect to background obtained using Wenner, Schlumberger 

and Dipole-Dipole electrode configurations respectively in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr and 20- 

Jun 2011. It is worth mentioning that, the first dataset (4-Nov 2010) were collected with four 

days delay after three days continuous rain with amount of 75, 60 and 10 mm respectively. The 

second dataset (11-Feb 2011) were collected by two weeks delay after the last rain, the third 

shown dataset were surveyed immediately after the rain and finally the last shown dataset were 

collected in dry season. The decrease of resistivity during the rain period is clearly visible in the 

first and third shown models in Fig.4.5-7 (a, c). In contrast, there is no remarkable change in the 

second dataset in Fig.4.5-6 (b) and finally last model shown in Fig.4.5-7 (d) show a considerable 

resistivity increase in dry season. A comparison of the obtained models using different electrode 

configurations show  an obvious similarity between Wenner and Schlumberger electrode 

configurations results, while Dipole-Dipole electrode configuration show a greater change with 

more scatter distribution. We also observed the same level of discrepancy in other dataset (not 

shown here) with Wenner and Schlumberger electrode configurations. The observed noise level 

of data collected using Dipole-Dipole electrode configuration in this study was significantly 

greater than others.

4.2.2. The EM38 
 

EM38 measurements were made in the vertical (EM38v) and horizontal (EM38h) modes of 

operation with 0.75m separation along the profile. Consequently 20 points were measured in 

each survey. Given the operating frequency of the EM38 (i.e. 14.5 kHz) and coil spacing (1.0 m), 

the theoretical depth of exploration is 1.5 and 0.75m respectively for EM38V and EM38h when 

the instrument is placed on the ground. To facilitate multi-height EM38 measurement, a 

specially-designed polymer-plastic ladder (Fig.4.3) was constructed at heights corresponding to 

0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 m. EM38 measurements were collected in both vertical and horizontal in 

mentioned heights. Fig.4.8 shows the apparent soil electrical conductivity (mS/m) data collected 

in 28-Oct 2010 using EM38 in vertical and horizontal modes of operation. Joint inversion of 

multi-height EM38 measurements was carried out using the algorithm proposed by Santos, 

(2004). The data of each survey was inverted considering a same initial five- layer earth model. 

The first four layers were initialized with the same depth of 0.3m and electrical conductivity of 

15, 20, 25 and 35 mS/m respectively from the ground surface. The electrical conductivity of the 

last layer was selected to be 50 mS/m. These values were estimated based on the apparent soil 

electrical conductivity values collected by EM38 and the resistivity model obtained in previous 

section. Fig 4.9 (a-c) shows the inverted models of the first EM38 dataset measured in 28-Oct 

2010. These models were generated using all 8 dataset shown in Fig.4.8 by applying the 1-D 

laterally constrained inversion and using different values of damping factor. Each model was 

obtained after 15 iterations. Fig.4.9a was obtained using a small damping factor of ?= 0.3 which 

corresponds to a less constrained inversion. The response of this model with total misfit of 

4.85% shows a robust model with significant lateral changes along the profile. The background 

resistivity value of this model is about 35 ohm.m which is reasonably consistent with the 

geoelectrical model. Fig.4.9b was obtained using damping factor value of 3. The resistivity 

changes along the profile are smoother than the first model, but the lateral changes are still 

obvious in this model. The misfit error is slightly greater than the first model with 5.18%. Finally 

the last model using ? = 30 is shown in Fig.4.9c. This high damping factor (k) forces the 

calculation of a solution with a significant degree of smoothness for a more uniform model. The 

model shows very smooth changes along the profile and there is a substantial disagreement 

between model obtained using ? = 30 with the geoelectrical model response in section 4.2.1 and 



50 
 

soil texture test results. The total misfit is 7.67% which is greater than the first and second 

models. 

All EM38 dataset collected during one year, were inverted through the same procedure using 

damping factor values of 0.3,3 and 30 (not shown here). The models then were analyzed and 

compared with resistivity model produced in section 4.2.1. We figured out that when ? = 3 the 

models well reflect the resistivity changes in our study. Although, small values of ? yield better 

fit, the lateral changes were exaggerated and artificial anomalies were produced in many cases. 

Furthermore, after finding the suitable value for damping factor, we inverted all EM38 datasets 

using vertical and horizontal modes of operation on the ground and 0.3m height level where 

shows the significant changes in raw data along the profile. Our analysis indicates that using only 

these data slightly improves the models and reduces the total misfit. Fig.4.9d shows the obtained 

model using the ground surface and 0.3m height data with a damping factor of 3. Therefore, for 

further investigation we used the models which were obtained using vertical and horizontal 

modes of operation of the ground surface and 0.3m height level by applying a damping factor of 

3 and 15 iterations. An investigation of EM38 background model in Fig.4.9d shows smooth 

resistivity changes along the profile with the average resistivity of 30 ohm.m. The model shows a 

very good consistency with ERT images in resistivity changes along the profile. Higher 

resistivity values are seen in the right and left upper zone of the profile. Afterward, independent 

EM38 datasets inversions were carried out separately. Obtained model were changed by 

subtracting pixel-by-pixel values from a background image. The effect of the temperature change 

with respect to background in 28-Oct 2010 was removed from EM38 data before inversion. 

Fig.4.10 (a-e) show the results of multi-height EM38 data inversions in terms of percentage 

resistivity changes with regard to background in 4 and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- Jun 

2011. The EM38 data in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb and 20- Jun 2011 (Fig.4.10a, c, d) were collected 

right before ERT surveys in these days. Although there is some difference between trends of 

resistivity changes inferred from EM38 and ERT images, pattern of results are reasonably 

similar. Both EM38 and ERT results show a decrease during the rain period in 4-Nov 2010 and a 

significant increase in 20- Jun 2011 in dry season. The second dataset (25-Nov 2010) were 

collected after 12 days of continuous rain amounting to170 mm. The model obtained in 25-Nov 

2010 shows the greatest resistivity changes during the experiment with an average of 20%

decrease with regard to background. The maximum increase (about 20%) in both ERT andEM38 

images are seen in dry season in 20 Jun 2011 as expected.

4.3. In-situ resistivity and saturation relationship 

To determine changes in soil moisture from ERT images, we did not assume the validity of 

Archie’s law. In fact, we established an in-situ approach based on ? vs. S changes by plotting the 

inverted value of resistivity of the extracted sample as a function of the saturation. The plot 

allowed us to obtain an empirical relationship between ? and S from the best match of the 

experimental data. To achieve this objective, we used the ERT images collected right before 

sampling and then the inverted resistivity values of related pixels were extracted and plotted as a 

function of saturation (Fig.4.11, a-c) to find out the best match of resistivity-moisture content 

changes. The obtained relationship is given by the following equation:  

                                                                                                           (4.1a) 

                                                                                                              (4.1b) 

                                                                                                              (4.1c) 

where S is the degree of saturation and ,  and  are the resistivity of the porous 

medium in relevant degree of saturation obtained using Wenner, Schlumberger and Dipole-

Dipole electrode configurations respectively. The resistivity and saturation shows a strong 

relationship in all electrode configurations in this study. The same procedure was applied to 

determine changes in soil moisture from EM38 images. The resistivity- saturation changes were 

plotted in Fig.4.11 (d). Resistivity and saturation shows weaker relationship in comparison with 

ERT images and expressed by:  

                                                                                                          (4.1d)

4.4. Soil moisture measurement using capacitance sensor 

Two Sentek PVC access tubes were fitted immediately after digging two holes in x=6 and x=9 

meters. Access tubes were pushed down the hole to the depth of 2 m for the measuring probes. 

Tubes were fitted well to the soil to prevent vertical leaking of surface water around the tube and 

to minimize air gaps. One capacitance sensor was used and data was collected every 0.1 m in 

depth along the access tubes. Soil moisture measurements were started in 16- Dec, 2010 and 

were repeated weekly until March, 2011 for four months.  

Before readings, the sensor was normalized to air and water. Afterwards, volumetric soil water 

content was estimated by following equation: 

 

                                                                                                                       (4.2) 

 

where  is the volumetric soil moisture content measured by the capacitance sensor and SF is 

scaled frequency and is generated by comparing the probe response in the access tube in the soil 

to the probe responses in air and water (Sentek, 2001; Hossain, 2008). Coefficient A, exponent B 

and constant C were selected from Senetek calibration for loam soil and are equal to 0.013, 1 and 

0.326 respectively. 

Volumetric soil moisture content variations relative to a background measured in 16- Dec 2010 

for each of the tubes is illustrated at various depth levels in Figures 4.12 and 4.13. Each figure 

shows the volumetric soil moisture content variations in 23- Dec 2010, 7 and 28 Jan, 22-Feb and 

4- Mar 2011. In 16- Dec, 23- Dec 2010 and 7-Jan, 2011, data were measured in a period of 

intermittent moderate to heavy rainfall, while data obtained in 28-Jan and 22- Feb, 2011 were 

measured during the sporadic rainfall. Finally last dataset in 4- Mar 2011 were measured two 

weeks after the last rain. An investigation of the both tube access results indicates that the 

moisture content decreased significantly in 4-Mar, 2011 as expected. Furthermore, each of the 

tube access shows visible decrease in 28-Jan and 22-Feb. No significant variations are seen in 

29-Dec 2010 and 7-Jan 2011. Moreover, the observed variations in the first tube access are not 

consistent with the second tube access. The moisture content variations hardly exceeded 10% 

during the experiment. The most remarkable moisture changes are seen in the first 50 cm of 

topsoil during the data collection. To present a closer inspection of the quality of the moisture 

data obtained with capacitance sensor, the weekly moisture content changes in one month from 



58 
 

each of the access tubes were shown in Fig.4.14 and.4.15. The results were then compared to 

moisture content changes inferred from resistivity models in the same place. Fig.4.16 and 4.17 

were calculated from resistivity data near the first and second access tubes respectively. Fig.4.14 

and 4.15 show a very scattered and noisy moisture content variation during one month, while 

moisture content changes inferred from the resistivity model show a smooth change with depth. 

Considering daily rainfall data, trends observed in moisture content variations inferred from 

resistivity models are more consistent with our expectation. For instance, the data obtained in 14-

Jan, 2011 were collected 8 days after the last rainfall, while the data in 23-Dec, 2010 were 

collected immediately after continuous heavy rain started in 18-Dec, 2010. Therefore the 

maximum increase and decrease in moisture in shallower zone are expected in 23-Dec, 2010 and 

14-Jan, 2011 respectively. We also compared moisture content inferred from resistivity models 

with those collected by the capacitance sensor for all other days (not shown here). We observed 

that the relative moisture content data obtained by the capacitance sensor are not reliable for a 

quantitative investigation. More importantly, such data cannot be used as a reference to control 

geophysical responses in our study. These data might be used for a qualitative comparison of 

moisture content over the long time.  Therefore, we stopped measuring moisture content by the 

capacitance sensor and we did not use these data in section 4.3 to convert resistivity changes to 

moisture content changes. It is worth mentioning that we only used one capacitance sensor 

bought from Sentek Company in this experiment. Therefore to measure the moisture content 

along the access tube, we manually moved the sensor inside the access tube in order to measure 

moisture content in different depths. It would be one of the sourced of inaccuracy in our study.

4.5. Moisture content maps 

Fig. 4-18 to 4-22 illustrate moisture content distribution computed by converting ERT images 

using equation 4.1, respectively for 28-Oct and 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr, and 20- Jun 2011. 

Maps of moisture distribution clearly show how the moisture content of the unsaturated zone 

changes during the experiment. The moisture content changed from an average of 28-32% in 

November to 22-27% in June. The right zone of the profile shows lower moisture content and 

greater variation during the experiment. Moisture distribution maps obtained using Wenner and 

Schlumberger configurations are consistent as expected, but the estimated moisture content using 

Dipole-Dipole is slightly lower than Wenner and Schlumberger configurations in the right side 

of the profile. Fig. 4.23a to Fig.4.23f show moisture distribution maps inferred from EM38 

images in 28-Oct, 4-Nov and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- Jun 2011 respectively. An 

investigation of calculated maps in Fig. 4.23(a-f) indicates that the highest and lowest moisture 

content levels are seen in November and June respectively. The maps inferred from EM38 

images displays slightly greater moisture content and less lateral changes along the profile in 

comparison with ERT images, yet the results are acceptably consistent. The spatiotemporal 

moisture content changes barely exceeded 10% during the experiment which indicates that the 

soil is semi-pervious and relatively homogeneous. The analysis of four soil cores taken in 2 Dec, 

2010, 20-Apr and 20-June 2011 for moisture content are consistent with moisture content 

distribution maps inferred from EM38 and ERT images.

4.6. Geophysical and hydrological parameters 

Many researchers that (e.g. Binley et al. 2002a; Looms et al. 2008a, 2008b; Dienna et al. 2007) 

have shown that how geophysical monitoring could be applied for estimating hydraulic 

conductivity and constraining the hydrological model. EM38 images and also ERT images 

obtained using Wenner and Schlumberger electrode configurations were used in this study in 

order to estimate hydraulic conductivity.  
 

4.6.1. Unsaturated flow modeling  
Unsaturated flow model was built by a finite-element formulation using Hydrus 2D. Van 

Genuchten equations were applied as retention and hydraulic conductivity functions in this 

model. As mentioned in section 3.5.2, van Genuchten´s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) for all 

samples were estimated by Rosetta software based on the particle size distributions and bulk 

density. The ranges of van Genuchten´s parameters of soil samples are presented in table.4.1a. 

We simplified the soil texture of the profile to two scenarios. A homogeneous soil was 

considered first, assuming uniform hydraulic parameters throughout the investigated area (table 

4.1b). Close inspection of grain size analyses from core sampling (discussed in section 4.1) and 

the obtained geophysical models indicated that the subsurface may be roughly subdivided into 

two soil zones with slightly different hydraulic characteristics. Therefore we divided the soil to 

two zones, the left side from 0-7.5 m and right side from 7.5-15 m. Estimated van Genuchten´s 

parameters for each zone are given in table 4.1(c).Van Genuchten’s equations along with 

estimated values were used as input for unsaturated flow simulation. Each simulation was 

initiated separately by using the moisture content images inferred from ERT (Wenner and 

Schlumberger electrode configurations) and EM38 background images. Simulating the moisture 

content distribution, we used the same grid as the one used in EM38 and ERT inversions so as to 

make it possible to compare geophysical responses with flow simulations and evaluate the 

hydraulic conductivity. The upper and bottom boundaries of the soil were simulated by 

implementing atmospheric and free drainage boundary conditions respectively. The evaporation 

and precipitation data during the experiment were collected and used in these simulations. The 

simulations were carried out for 238 days during 28-Oct 2010 to 20-Jun 2011 time period.

4.6.2. Estimating and constraining the hydrological parameters by geophysical data 
To evaluate whether individual hydrologic models represent the field conditions, the geophysical 

response and simulating flow were compared using a misfit value: 

 

                                                                             (4.3) 

 

Where is the simulated moisture content and is the moisture content inferred from ERT or 

EM38 images and N is the number of pixels of models. We compare the geophysical response 

and simulating flow based on the smallest misfit. The first ten time-lapse data sets collected by 

ERT and EM38 were used in this evaluation. 

Fig. 4.24, 4.26 and 4.28 presents a comparative illustration of the misfit error of simulating flow 

using estimated van Genuchten’s parameters for homogeneous soil (presented in table.4.1b) and 

ERT and EM38 images. Among van Genuchten’s parameters, the saturated hydraulic 

conductivity plays the most important role in dynamics of the vadose zone and in particular, it 

controls the speed of water infiltration (looms et al., 2008). Therefore we fixed all others 

Genuchten’s parameters so as to make them the same as those shown in table.4.1b. Afterwards, 

several new simulations were carried out by changing saturated hydraulic conductivity values to 

find the smallest misfit on the basis of the moisture content distribution. Percent of mass 

recovery of ERT and EM38 images in monitoring moisture content were also calculated and 

plotted in Fig. 4.25, 4.27 and 4.29 in order to provide a better quantitative comparison of 

geophysical model and simulating flow for hydraulic conductivity estimation. An investigation 

of ERT results in Fig.4.24 to Fig.4.27 shows good consistency between Wenner and 

Schlumberger electrode configurations results. The results of the misfit errors and present mass 



69 
 

indicate that hydraulic conductivity value of 4.5 cm/day can reasonably reproduce the moisture 

content distribution during the experiment. Greater values of hydraulic conductivity yield higher 

misfit error and underestimate mass recovery, while lower hydraulic conductivity overestimates 

mass recovery of the moisture content distribution and increases misfit error. The results of 

EM38 images are shown in Fig 4.28 and 4.29. An investigation of the misfit errors and present 

mass indicate that the hydraulic conductivity of 8 cm/day can better reproduce the moisture 

content distribution during the experiment. Lower hydraulic conductivities largely overestimate 

mass recovery and show greater misfit errors. On the other hand, greater hydraulic conductivities 

underestimate mass recovery and also yield greater misfit errors. Hydraulic conductivity 

estimated using EM38 images is two times greater than that estimated by ERT images, yet all 

results constrained hydraulic conductibility to be in 1-10 cm/day range. We also calculated the 

misfit error and mass recovery of ERT images in comparison with simulating flow using 2-layers 

soil and estimated van Genuchten’s parameters in table 4.1c. The misfit error and mass recovery 

of ERT images in comparison with simulating model are shown in Fig 4.30 and 4.31 with ? =1. 

We only presented ERT images inferred from Schlumberger electrode configuration since the 

results of ERT images inferred from Wenner electrode configuration are very similar. Several 

new simulations were carried out using multiple values for hydraulic conductivity reported in 

Table 4.1c. The goal was to find the smallest misfit and best mass recovery. Results indicate that 

smallest misfit and best mass recovery are achieved by a 2-layer model with hydraulic 

conductivity of 4 and 5.3 cm/day among our flow simulations. Comparing misfit error obtained 

using ERT images; we found that 2-layers soil (Fig 4.32b) reproduced moisture content 

distribution slightly better than homogenous soil (Fig 4.32a) did. We also analyzed different 

scenarios for 2 layers soil such as greater hydraulic conductivity for the left zone rather than the 

right zone or greater differences between the hydraulic conductivity of the left and right zone 

(e.g. see Fig. 4.32c, d). Our investigation indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of soil slightly 

increases along the profile from the left to the right side. We did the same procedure for EM38 

images to see whether yield better fit with 2-layer soil model. Different from ERT images, EM38 

images did not better match to 2-layer soil model.  

In Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34, the moisture-content simulations in 4-Nov 2010, 11-Feb, 21-Apr and 

20- Jun 2011 were presented so as to better visualize moisture-content distribution. A 

homogenous and a 2-layer soil with Van Genuchten parameters defined in table.4.1b and 4.1c 



70 
 

were used to produce Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34 respectively. The goal was to helps compare 

moisture-content distribution inferred from ERT images with flow simulations that shows the 

most similarity among simulations.  

An investigation of Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34 in comparison with Fig.4.18 to Fig.4.22 show an 

acceptable estimation of moisture content values along the profile during the period of the 

experiment. This finding indicated that the estimated hydraulic conductivity acceptably 

reproduce the water movement. The moisture content distribution maps inferred from ERT 

images are to some extent different from flow simulations shown in Fig.4.33 and Fig.4.34. This 

is not surprising because our simulations limited to only homogenous and 2-layer soil scenarios 

while a significant degree of heterogeneity had been observed in the soil texture analysis. This 

disparity is not the only source of disagreement of flow simulations and ERT images, the lateral 

water movement, the inversion process of ERT data and the noise level in the ERT images 

(particularly in background ERT image) might explain this level of discrepancy. Yet, the flow 

simulations using 2-layer soil with higher hydraulic conductivity in right side of the profile better 

matches with ERT images. 

In Fig.4.35, moisture-content simulations in 4-Nov and 25-Nov 2010, 20-Jan, 11-Feb and 20- 

Jun 2011 were presented. A homogenous soil with Van Genuchten parameters defined in 

table.4.1b and hydraulic conductivity of 8 cm/min was selected in order to compare the results 

with EM38 images. A comparison of Fig. 4.35 with Fig.4.23 indicate that the water movement is 

well reproduced using a saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 8 cm/min, but the moisture 

content distribution inferred from EM38 images is relatively different from flow simulations due 

to the above-mentioned reasons discussed for ERT images. In addition, lower inherent accuracy 

of EM38 in comparison with ERT surveys and the absences of time-lapse inversion process for 

EM38 data contributed to creation of the discrepancy mentioned in these comparisons.

4.7. Water Injection Test 

A small circular hole with total volume of 2512 cm3 was drilled to conduct an artificial water 

injection test. The hole was filled by tap water with electrical conductivity of 110 ms/m once per 

day. The evolution of the injected water was monitored by symmetrical ERT surveys using a 

pole-pole array in four directions in order to monitor lateral water movement. A total of 80 

electrodes were installed and connected to 80 active boxes to monitor water movement in four 

directions. The expansion of each profile was the same and equal to 6.05m. 20 electrodes with 

the electrode positions of X= 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.15, 3.25, 3.35, 3.45, 3.55, 

3.80, 4.05, 4.55, 5.05 and 6.05m were used in each profile. The borehole was located in the 

middle of the all four profiles in X=3-3.05m. Smaller electrode separations were selected near 

borehole (10 cm) for a higher resolution near the borehole and were subsequently increased to 

25, 50 and finally 100 cm at the both sides of the profile. A total of 190 measurements were 

taken for each image. The total time required for each acquisition was about 15 minutes. 

ERT data was collected in each profile twice per day for a week starting in 21-Sep 2011. Data 

collection was done in early morning immediately after water injection and in the afternoon, 

when the borehole was almost empty of water. We collected two backgrounds for each profile, 

one with empty borehole and one immediately after filling the borehole for the first time. 

Considering similarities between profiles, we only show and discuss the results of the first 

profile. The background model (collected with filled borehole) is shown in Fig.4.36. The 

modeling result shows relatively high resistivity values (higher than 150 ?.m) in very shallow 

zone (less than 30 cm) and low resistivity with average value of 20 ?.m in deeper zone along the 

profile. 

The inversion of the time-lapse ERT data was carried out using RES2DINVx32 ver. 3.71. To 

better present resistivity changes near the borehole, we only used the data in the range of x=2.5-

3.5 meter with the maximum depth of 1.5m for time-lapse inversion process. Fig. 4.37 shows the 

results of the resistivity inversions for the first profile with data collected immediately after 

filling the borehole, in terms of percentage resistivity changes with regard to background.  

 Fig.4.37 shows the resistivity decrease around the borehole over the period of time to some 

extent. Unfortunately, we were not able to draw out a quantitative model of resistivity changes in 

order to trace the water movement. A number of factors resulted in this undesired outcome for 

the experiment:  



80 
 

1- The volume of borehole and consequently the amount of injected water were not enough 

to trace the water movement. 

2- The electrical conductivity of the injected water (110 ms/m) was not significantly greater 

than the average electrical conductivity of the soil (50 ms/m) to trace the water movement 

based on the electrical conductivity contrast. Of course, applying a saline tracer could 

aim at monitoring water movement more effectively, but it might distort the field site for 

further investigation under the natural condition. 

3- The high level of moisture content before the water injection test was the main reason of 

the low electrical conductivity of soil. Although the experiment was conducted in driest 

period of the year, the soil was still too wet for such experiment. 

4- We should have designed and installed a device to refill the borehole automatically to 

keep the injected water in the ground level. The present of air gap (as a high resistivity 

anomaly) distorted ERT images near the borehole considerably.  

5- The electrical conductivity of the most important zone of the experiment (x=2.5-3.5m and 

z=0-20cm) in four directions were dramatically influenced by electrical conductivity of 

40 electrodes connected to the ground. The observed data in this zone was noisy and the 

obtained model was also very unstable in inversion process. 

6- Due to lack of security, it was impossible to leave the equipment in the field to collect 

dense dataset for a better monitoring of resistivity changes. 

7- The period of ERT monitoring was not long enough to trace water movement. In fact we 

had overestimated the hydraulic conductivity when designed the experiment.

4.8.Conclusions: 

The results of our experiment, where the moisture content distribution was monitored using 

ERT and EM38, allow for the following conclusions: 

 

1. Both EM38 and ground surface ERT methods were capable of imaging changes in bulk 

resistivity in order to map seasonal moisture content distribution. The study of soil 

indicated that the soil moisture content hardly fall below 20% in dry season. We only 

observed lower values of moisture content in very shallow zone in summer. In contrast, 

the soil moisture content reached 30% during the rain period.  

 

2. The experiment conducted at the campus of university of Lisbon proves that the soil is 

semi-pervious sediment. The spatiotemporal moisture content change during the 

experiment barely exceeds 10%. Our calculations using ERT and EM38 images constrain 

the range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity to be in 1-10 (cm/day). The low contrast 

of the electrical conductivity between the excess moisture content and soil and also 

insufficient temporal variation changes under natural condition in this study added to the 

complication of using the ground surface ERT and EM38 to present an accurate 

quantitative model in order to estimate hydraulic conductivity. Constraining and 

estimating of hydraulic variables in unsaturated soil usually requires very dense 

monitoring of geophysical data under a designed-infiltration. In addition, a tracer with 

large electrical conductivity contrast might be needed to better visualize how tracer sinks.  

 

3. Based on comparison of outcomes obtained using EM38 and those from ERT, EM38 

proved to be acceptably capable in monitoring moisture content changes and water 

movement in shallow zone. EM38 has the advantage of being less expensive, much 

faster, and easier to use in data collection in comparison with the ERT method. 

Furthermore, EM38can cover a larger area in regional investigation. Paying special 

attention to both data collection and inversion is greatly important in order to achieve a 

quantitative model.    

 



84 
 

4. A careful consideration of inverse problem should be taken into account to avoid the 

effects of overparameterization and smoothing from regularization that can impact the 

quantitative estimates of hydrogeologic parameter values using geophysical data. Several 

time-lapse inversion algorithms were developed in geoelectrical modeling in order to 

obtain a quantitative model of subsurface. In this study, the method proposed by Kim 

(2009) was used to invert ERT data. This method introduces the regularizations not only 

in the space domain but also in time to reduce inversion artifacts and improve stability of 

the inverse problem even if changes in the subsurface properties during the data 

acquisition cannot be ignored. Different methods mentioned in section 3.3 were used and 

compared (not shown here) in this research and we found that the space-time 

parameterization method yields better results and is more user-friendly among those 

methods.  

 

5. Applying the established in-situ relationship for conversion of electrical conductivity to 

moisture content has the advantage of using an approach same as ERT and EM38 images 

to calibrate field data which aims to reduce heterogeneity in moisture content distribution 

mapping. In contrast, the degree of saturation of extracted sample was limited and did not 

cover 0-1 range which made impossible to achieve a more accurate relationship. 

Moreover, localizing and estimating of the electrical conductivity of the related samples 

based on the obtained inverted model is another source of uncertainty in an established 

in-situ relationship. Using Archie’s law instead of the established in-situ relationship for 

conversion of the electrical conductivity to moisture content would considerably 

overestimate moisture content estimation in this study. 

 

6. In spite of the reported poor resolution of ERT images in mass recovery in many 

publications, the obtained results in this study shows a very good mass recovery at 

simulating the moisture excess with respect to background. This is probably because of 

using in-situ resistivity-saturation relationship which reduces the disagreement. In 

addition, the low degree of moisture content variations made the mass recovery 

calculation more realistic.  

 



85 
 

7. Neglecting temporal fluctuations in temperature when using electrical conductivity 

images to monitor the moisture content distribution leads to errors when a quantitative 

estimate of moisture content is required. Many studies have tried to convert ERT images 

to moisture content maps however, if this is to be meaningful, then temperature variations 

within the image must be accounted for (Hayley et al. 2007).  The temperature data 

shows 12°c variations during the experiment. Such a variation significantly affects ERT 

and EM38 images and is required to be modified for a quantitative model.

Investigation of the EM38 and ERT methods in monitoring moisture content changes and 

hydraulic conductivity estimation on a deep Arenosol soil with high permeability and a low 

water retention capacity was conducted in the Campanhia das Lezirias – Samorra Correia under 

natural condition and forced-infiltration experiment. This chapter investigates the result of the 

EM38 and ERT surveys in soil moisture content monitoring and hydraulic conductivity 

estimation. A synthetic test was also performed in order to identify errors associated with the 

ERT method and inversion process. 

 

5.1. Field Site Selection 

To select a new suitable field site for the study, several 2D ground surface ERT surveys were 

carried out. The goal was to find a fairly homogeneous soil, based on resistivity changes along 

the profiles. Among several ERT images obtained in Samora- Correia, the ERT model shown in 

Fig.5.1 shows the minimum lateral changes. An investigation of this model indicates a very 

resistive topsoil in the first two meter with smooth lateral resistivity variations along the profile 

particularly between x=7.5m and x=27.5m (marked by red rectangular). Decrease of resistivity 

by depth is clearly visible in this model where it falls below 10 ?.m in the deeper zone. The 

sharp decrease of resistivity is related to groundwater level in field area. We repeated ERT 

survey in the same profile between x=7.5m and x=27.5m where shows the minimum lateral 

changes (Fig.5.2) to more accurately investigate the lateral resistivity changes. Two soil cores 

were taken to a depth of approximately 2m to analyze particle size distribution. We found 

supportive evidence that the selected profile shown in Fig.5.2 is suitable to conduct our study in 

this zone. Therefore further investigation was carried out in this profile.

5.2. Soil Test 

A total of eight soil cores down to a depth of approximately 1.8-2.5 m were extracted along the 

profile since 17th Oct 2011 until 16th Oct 2012 (Fig.5.3). These cores were sectioned into 0.2 m 

lengths (Fig.5.4) and prepared for laboratory analysis of soil physical properties namely particle 

density, bulk density, texture and gravimetric water content. The particle size distribution 

analyses of two cores along the profile were shown in Fig.5.5 and Fig.5.6. The particle size 

distribution analysis indicated a sand texture class with less than five percent clay and silt, on 

average. The observed average particle density and bulk density were 2.65 and 1.66 respectively 

and the porosity value was equal to 37%. As the average particle density and bulk density 

exhibited a low degree of variation along the field site, the site was considered homogeneous and 

the porosity was fixed at 37%.

5.3. Geophysical monitoring 

The evolution of the moisture content distribution was monitored by the ground surface ERT 

surveys since 17th Oct 2011 until 16th Oct 2012 under the natural conditions (Fig.5.7). 

Geophysical surveys were repeated monthly. The possibility of using EM38 and borehole ERT 

were also examined in this study.

connections. The devise is connected to laptop and all necessary setting and data collection is programmed by 

Geotest software.  

 

5.3.1. Geoeletrical monitoring  
2D ground surface ERT survey was performed using Schlumberger electrode configurations and 

using 4 point light 10W devise with maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of 10 m and 

electrode spacing of 0.5 m (40 electrodes). A total of 361 measurements were done for each 

dataset. All data were inverted using RES2DINV with two iterations. Effect of change in 



93 
 

temperature with respect to background dataset was removed from all ERT data by applying a 

value of 2% change per degree before inversion. The models obtained from inversion of data 

collected in Dec-2011, Jan, March, May, Jun and Aug-2012 were shown in Fig.5.8a to Fig.8f 

respectively. The inversion images obtained during the experiment period show very resistive 

topsoil in the first 2 meters followed by a sharp fall in resistivity in deeper zone. This pattern of 

change in resistivity is attributed to the groundwater level and sharp moisture content variations 

in the transition zone. Comparisons of the successive models clearly show a fall in groundwater 

level during the Dec, 2011-Aug, 2012 time period. The highest level of the groundwater is seen 

in Dec-2011, while lowest groundwater level is seen in Aug-2012. The unsaturated zone shows a 

smooth resistivity change during the experiment. The analysis of soil samples collected during 

the experiment indicates that the groundwater level varies in 2.6-3.6 meter range. The highest 

groundwater level was 2.6 meter seen in Dec-2011 and the lowest was slightly deeper than 3.6 

meters seen in Aug-2012. Relative seasonal groundwater level changes inferred from ERT 

images are acceptably consistent with sampling results. Nevertheless ERT images overestimated 

the width of the transition zone and consequently overestimated the groundwater level.

5.3.2.  In-situ resistivity and saturation relationship 
To determine changes in soil moisture from ERT images, we did not again assume the validity of 

Archie’s law in this study. We repeated the same procedure explained in 4.3 and established an 

in-situ approach based on ? vs. S changes. The obtained relationship (Fig.5.9) is given by the 

following equation:  

?                                                                                                                      (5.1) 

Where S is the degree of saturation and ? is the resistivity of the porous medium in relevant 

degree of saturation. Equation (5.1) was used to convert resistivity changes to moisture content 

changes.

5.3.3. Moisture content maps 
Fig.5.10 shows the moisture content distribution map in 17-Jan 2012 inferred from ERT images 

by using equation (5.1). This dataset was collected with 1 day delay after about 10mm rainfall. 

An investigation of this maps show a dry unsaturated zone in the first 2 meter with less than 8% 

moisture content. In deeper zone, a very sharp moisture content rise from 8% to more than 25%

is seen. This rise is related to the groundwater influence in this zone. The data collected in 17-Jan 

2012, was selected as background for time-lapse inversion since the dataset collected in Dec-

2011 was very noisy and unsuitable to be used as background. Fig.5.11 (a-f) show the inversion 

results, in terms of percentage desaturation which obtained from converting differences of ERT 

images with regard to background by using equation (5.1). An investigation of Fig.5.11 reveals 

the influence of the seasonal groundwater level fall in ERT images in deeper zone. ERT image 

obtained in Aug (Fig.5.11f) shows the maximum level of desaturation with more than 25% with 

respect to background in depths that are over 2 m. The moisture content changes in this zone are 

mainly influenced by seasonal rainfall. In contrary, the resistivity changes and consequently the 

moisture content variations in unsaturated zone (less than 1.5-2m) are mainly influenced by daily 

rainfall due to the fast infiltration in high-permeability sediments. Unfortunately the monthly 

ERT images could not aim at monitoring the water movement in unsaturated zone in order to 

estimate and constrain hydrologic parameters. We also examined whether we could map 

moisture changes under natural condition with daily ERT monitoring. For instance, ERT images 

shown in Fig.5.11 (b, c and d) were modeled by inverting data collected in 6, 7 and 8-Apr 2012 

after the rainfall. Our investigations indicated that the very fast water movement in the 

unsaturated zone makes ERT images application complicated under the natural condition. 

Imaging water movement in high-permeability sediments under natural conditions requires a 

very dense data set collection during and after a heavy rain. Since the field site was not in Lisbon 

and arrangements were required to book a car and access to the field site, it was not possible to 

find access to the field site at the right time. Neither was it possible to leave the monitoring 

equipment at the site, mainly due to security reasons. Therefore we designed a forced infiltration 

experiment for soil characterization. The details of the forced infiltration experiment will be 

shown and discussed in section 5.4.

5.3.4. Borehole ERT 
Resolution of ground surface ERT imaging decreases with depth. Cross borehole ERT usually 

provides a more uniform vertical model resolution particularly when detailed information and 

quantitative model are required. Electrodes are usually installed in four or more boreholes to 

monitor 3d spatial resistivity image. Also, it is possible to use mixed surface and borehole 

electrodes for better resolution as long as all electrodes are in the same plane. In this study we 

tried to use borehole ERT in order to collect more accurate data to achieve a better quantitative 

model for hydraulic conductivity estimation. 

 

5.3.4.1. Borehole ERT devise   

We built a borehole tool in the lab and used 4 point light 10W devise and active boxes to monitor 

resistivity images in the field. 18 stainless steel nails were used as electrodes. They were 

soldered to cables then taped to a PVC pipe every 10 cm (Fig.5.12a). The tube was then installed 

in an augured hole (Fig.5.12b). To ensure a good contact between the electrode and the 

surrounding material, we filled the hole using dried sand by using a funnel and a long tube. In 

that way we could ensure that the dry sand was filled from the bottom and did not create cavities. 

We also shacked the PVC tube with the electrodes while backfilling to ensure a good packing. 

To survey mixed surface and borehole ERT, we firstly connected all 18 cables (electrode) to the 

active boxes (Fig.5.12c) and checked the contact resistance. Unfortunately, despite all efforts 

made on this device, the contact resistance of the electrodes connection was not good enough for 

borehole resistivity images. The dryness of the soil as well as the loose packing of sand grains in 

the field were the most important reasons that resulted in a less than satisfactory outcome.

5.3.5. The EM38 
EM38 measurements were made in the vertical (EM38v) and horizontal (EM38h) modes of 

operation with 0.5m separation along the profile and consequently 40 points were measured in 

each survey. To facilitate multi-height EM38 measurement, the ladder was again used and EM38 

measurements were also collected in both vertical and horizontal in 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 m heights. 

The ECa data collected in Dec-2011 is shown in Fig.5.13. The data indicate very low electrical 

conductivity (less than 10 ms/m) in both vertical and horizontal modes and all four heights. 

These values indicated a very dry soil along the profile as expected.  

Joint inversion of multi-height EM38 measurements was carried out using the algorithm 

proposed by Santos, (2004). The data of each survey were inverted considering initial five- layer 



100 
 

earth model. The first four layers were initialized with the same depth of 0.3m and electrical 

conductivity of 2, 3, 4 and 5 mS/m respectively from the ground surface. The electrical 

conductivity of the last layer was selected to be 7 mS/m. These values were estimated based on 

the resistivity model obtained in previous section and also data shown in Fig.5.13. The inverted 

models of the EM38 data are presented in Fig.5.14a. The model was obtained using all 8 dataset 

shown in Fig.5.13 by applying the 1-D laterally constrained inversion and using damping factor 

of ? = 3 and 15 iterations. The inverted model indicates high resistivity topsoil along the profile 

in the first 0.5 m followed by a sharp vertical resistivity fall with depth increment. The total 

misfit error of the model is about 21%. We changed the electrical conductivity of layers in initial 

model and also damping factor frequently to see whether it can improves the misfit error. We 

could not achieve significant improvement in inversion process and there was a clear 

disagreement in models in comparison with ERT images and soil samples moisture content. 

Again we changed the initial models, but this time by increasing the depth of investigation to 2.8 

m (the underground water level). The reasons for increasing of depth of investigation to be more 

than 1.5 m were that the average of the electrical conductivity collected in vertical mode on the 

ground and 0.3 m height was about 8ms/s which is considerably greater than the expected 

electrical conductivity of the first 1.5 m with a very dry soil. Therefore, the influence of 

transition zone and groundwater on data was obvious to us and of course is not unexpected a 

deeper penetration of electromagnetic induction where the subsoil is not conductive. The 

inverted model was obtained using a damping factor of 3, 15 iterations and a 5 layers initial 

models with depth of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.8 and electrical conductivity of 2, 4, 6 and 15 ms/m 

respectively. The electrical conductivity of the last layer (deeper than 2.8 m) was selected to be 

50 ms/m. The new model contains considerably less total misfit error (about 13%). An 

investigation of the obtained image (shown in Fig.5.14b) is in a fairly good agreement with ERT 

image in Fig 5.8a. We repeated EM38 data collection in Jan and Feb, 2012 and we made the 

same procedure of data modeling (not shown here). Our investigation show that EM38 cannot 

effectively aims at monitoring resistivity changes in unsaturated sandy soil under natural 

conditions to present a quantitative model in order to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity 

and we stopped collecting EM38 data because:  



101 
 

1- As was mentioned in section 5.3.3, imaging water movement in high-permeability 

sediments under natural conditions requires a dense data set collection during and after a 

heavy rain when a significant moisture changes are expected which was not possible to 

achieve it. 

2- A very dry unsaturated soil is not an ideal media for EM38 investigation when a 

quantitative and temporal study is required. Low values of electrical conductivity (less 

than 9 ms/m) are very sensitive to noise. The main effective noise source is setting and 

maintaining EM38 in Zero. It is necessary that this Zero be accurately achieved and 

obtained. Such an error would be negligible over the usual range of conductive soils, but 

it was significant in our study.  

3- The great contrast of the electrical conductivity of groundwater has strong influence in 

EM38 images in the unsaturated zone with very dry sandy soil which make it 

complicated to draw out lateral and vertical moisture variation in unsaturated zone.

inversion algorithm with 2-D smoothness constraints using a damping factor of 3 and 15 iterations. Initial five layers 

models were selected by a) depth of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 meters from the ground surface with electrical conductivity of 

2, 3, 4 and 5 mS/m respectively and electrical conductivity of 7 mS/m was selected for the last layer. b) depth of 1, 

1.5, 2, 2.8 and electrical conductivity of 2, 4, 6 and 15 ms/m respectively. The electrical conductivity of the last 

layer (deeper than 2.8 m) was selected to be 50 ms/m.

5.4. Water injection test  
An artificial water-injection experiment was carried out at a rate of 8.96 cm/h over a 12.6 by 2.1 

m2 area of the field site, using drippers spaced every 30 cm over the surface (294 drippers) for 

about 3 hours (Fig. 5.15a). Therefore, about 0.71 m3 of water was injected during the 

experiment. The pressure compensating drippers with drip rate of 8 liters per hour (Fig. 5.15b) 

were used for all 294 drippers in this experiment to guarantees uniform water distribution along 

the entire lines. The water supplied from a nearby groundwater access to a water tank (Fig. 

5.15c) and was distributed to the drippers by using a pump to ensure constant flow during the 

experiment. A water flow meter was connected to the system to verify a constant flow rate of 

water and also measured the final amount of injected water.

5.4.1. Temperature Sensor installation 
14 soil temperature sensors were installed in 2 boreholes at depths of 0.1 m, 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 0.7 m, 

0.9, 1.1 and 1.3 m. The sensors monitored temperature changes minutely during the experiment. 

Fig.5.16 illustrates changes in temperature of the first borehole during injection of water at the 

experiment. The temperature graphs for sensors in depths over 30 cm in Fig.5.16b show that the 

temperature decreased sharply at the beginning of the water injection and followed by a gradual 

rise as water injection went on. Sensors with less than 30 cm but more than 10 cm show 



105 
 

increasing trends during the water injection. Fig. 5.16a represents variation in temperature during 

the experiment for five days. The first two sensors in depth of 10 and 30cm are mainly 

influenced by the daily climate temperature changes, while, the temperature sensors in depths 

over 30 cm show a gradual decrease after the water injection which is mainly influenced by the 

water injection experiment. Pattern of changes in temperature of the second borehole (not shown 

here) show a similar results. The effect of the temperature changes were removed from the all 

ERT data by applying a value of 2% change per degree.

5.4.2. Geophysical monitoring 
The evolution of the injected water was monitored by ERT surveys. A 2D ground surface ERT 

survey using Schlumberger electrode configuration, with maximum current electrode (AB/2) 

expansion of 5.85m and electrode spacing of 0.30 m was performed on this experiment.  A total 

of 361 measurements were taken for each image. The total time required for each acquisition was 

about 22 minutes and 149 data sets were obtained during the water-injection and also three data 

sets were collected before the experiment to use as a background ERT image. The water 

injection test was started at 10h30 in 16-Oct, 2012. ERT surveys were started by water injection 

and continued until 20-Oct, 2012. Smaller electrode separation was used in this experiment in 

comparison with the previous section to allow a more detailed and dense lateral vertical data 

collection in first 1.5 meter. It aims to better visualize and monitor resistivity changes in 

unsaturated zone and also eliminate the groundwater influence in ERT images for a better focus 

on the unsaturated zone. The simpler bottom boundary conditions for flow simulations is also 

expected when the simulations are carried out in unsaturated zone far from the groundwater, 

otherwise the details information from the groundwater level variation is required for an 

acceptable flow simulation.    

All 3 background ERT data sets were inverted and the more stable and less noisy model was 

selected for further investigation in time-lapse inversion. The background model is shown in 

Fig.5.17. The modeling result shows a resistive media along the profile which indicate the soil 

was very dry before the water-injection (as discussed in section 5.3.1.). 

 Fig.5.18 show the results of the resistivity inversions, in terms of percentage water content 

changes which obtained from converting differences of ERT images with regard to background 

by using equation (5.1). We presented all ERT images collected during the water injection 

(Fig.5.18a to Fig.5.18h) until 2 hours after the water injection (Fig.5.18i to Fig5.18m) and some 

selected images from 17-Oct (the day after water injection) at 00h30, 4h50 and 18h40 in Fig.5.18 

(n, o and p), at 18h00 from 18-Oct in Fig.5.18 (q), at 17h20 from 19-Oct in Fig.5.18(r) and 

18h12 from 20-Oct in Fig.5.18 (s). Two iterations were only used to invert all data in this study 

since the greater number of iterations caused misleading anomalies in some time-lapse images.   

Fig.5.18 (a-h) shows clearly the infiltrating water front into the unsaturated zone shortly after the 

injection. Focusing on the first eight subsequent images, sharp water content changes during 180 

minutes indicates that the sediments are highly permeable and the infiltration process is very fast

5.4.3. Moment Analysis 
 

2D spatial moments were calculated from the resistivity images according to the description of 

moment analysis discussed in 3.6. We only used the first 8 ERT images which were collected 

during the water injection. We also used the inverted resistivity data in x=2.5-9.5m range in this 

calculation to avoid the extrapolation effect of the ERT inversion model in moment analysis. 

The results of these analyses are plotted in Fig.5.19 (a-c). The percent mass calculated using 

equation (3.48) after removing the mass from the background (Fig.5.19a) shows a poor 

resolution at simulating the amount of injected water. The mass error is fairly steady over the 

experiment with a gradual decrease from 23% to 19.5%. As pointed out by many authors (see 

e.g. Looms et al., 2008; Binley et al., 2002b; Singha and Gorelick, 2005) the poor sensitivity of 

ERT method (particularly ground surface ERT) in imaging water content amount might be 

explained by the lateral water movement out of the measurement area in 2D survey, the inversion 

process, the noise level in the background resistivity image and the use of inadequate 

petrophysical relationships. Although, we used in-situ resistivity and saturation relationship to 

reduce this disagreement; however, the methods still suffers from the mass error balance.  

To estimate the centre-of-mass vertical motion, the first moment, M01 was calculated using 

(3.48) and then normalized by the mass of the system. The centre-of-mass vertical motion is 

shown in Fig.5.19b. The ERT-estimated of centre-of-mass vertical motion indicates clearly the 

very fast infiltration and vertical downward migration. The centre of mass moved approximately 

55 cm from the injection source over 180 minutes. The centre of mass is in preference to other 

measures, such as the position of the tracer front, because (a) it has a physical basis, and (b) will 

be sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity of the sandstone for gravity dominated flow. The 

vertical spread of water tracer was also calculated by using equation (3.49) and plotted in 

Fig.5.19c. The graph shows a fairly monotonic trend of increasing in the vertical spread over the 

experiment as water migrates downward. The vertical spread of the excess water content show a 

greater scatter comparing the first moment. It is not unexpected due to the high sensitivity of the 

second moment computation to noisy data sets and smoothness optimization method used in 

inversion process.

5.4.4. Unsaturated flow modeling  
Unsaturated flow models were built using finite-element formulation. Hydrus 2D was used to 

simulate unsaturated flow. Van Genuchten equations were applied as retention and hydraulic 

conductivity functions in this model. Two different methods were used in this study to estimate 

all five van Genuchten parameters. At first, these parameters were estimated by Rosetta software 

based on the particle size distributions and bulk density. The obtained values are given in table 

5.1(a).  

In addition, to estimate van Genuchten’s parameters we used a mini disk infiltrometer in ten 

points along the profile. At each point, the same consecutive tensions at -6, -4 and -2 were 

applied to the soil. One sample from each point was also taken before the experiment to measure 

the initial water content in lab. Due to the very fast infiltration of sandy soil, it was impossible to 

take a sample to measure final water content. Therefore we fixed the saturated water content to 

be 0.37 to constrain the retention curve during the optimization. The cumulative infiltrations for 

two examples of mini disk infiltrometer data sets were plotted in Fig.5.20 as a function of time. 

These data were used as input for DISK software to estimate van Genuchten’s parameters. The 

obtained values in the inversion process are shown in table 5.1(b and c) for the first and second 

cumulative infiltrations shown in Fig.5.20. The minimum and maximum estimated hydraulic 

conductivity using mini disk infltrometer data along the profile were 0.01, 0.12 cm/min 

respectively. Afterward, van Genuchten’s equations with the estimated values in table 5.1 were 

used as input to the unsaturated flow simulation. Initial conditions were developed based on the 

water content of samples which were taken just before the water injection. Regarding all above-

mentioned evidences, a homogenous soil was selected for simulations. The bottom boundary of 

the soil column was simulated by implementing a free drainage boundary condition. The 

simulations were carried out for 180 minutes and the evaporation was neglected in all 

simulations. Three simulations were obtained using van Genuchten’s parameters estimations 

shown in table 5.1. The first, second and third simulation shown in Fig.5.21 present the 

calculated centre-of-mass vertical motion of the simulating flow based on van Genuchten’s 

parameters in table 5.1a, b and c respectively. The simulations derived from the cumulative 

infiltrations, show a much slower infiltration in comparison with ERT images. This is not 

unexpected in coarse texture, since mini disk underestimates hydraulic conductivity by failing to 

incorporate to macropores.

5.4.5. Estimating and constraining the hydrological parameters by geophysical data 
The centre-of-mass vertical motions of simulated flow model in section 5.4.4 (Fig.5.21) were 

compared to the centre-of-mass vertical motions of ERT images calculated in section 5.4.3 and 

were shown in Fig.5.22. A comparison of the centre-of-mass vertical motion graphs shows that 

the water trace sinks faster in the graph, derived from ERT images. As discussed in 3.6.2 how 

the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil plays the most important role among van 

Genuchten’s parameters, we fixed all others van Genuchten’s parameters to be the same values 

of the table 5.1(a) and then several new simulations were carried out by changing saturated 

hydraulic conductivity value to find the best match on the basis of the sinking process of the 

water during the water-injection experiment. Several values of saturated hydraulic conductivity 

from ROSETTA database range for sand (Table.5.2) were used for new simulations.   

The results of the centre-of-mass vertical motions shown in Fig. 5.23 indicate that a hydraulic 

conductivity value of 0.65 cm/min can well reproduce the centre of mass vertical motion of 

tracer during the period of measurements. The vertical spread of the excess water content (with 

respect to background) resulting from simulating models was also plotted in Fig 5.24 in order to 

provide a better comparison of the simulated models and ERT images. The scatter pattern of

vertical spread inferred from ERT images make this comparison complicated; however a 

hydraulic conductivity value of 1cm/min can better reproduce the vertical spread of tracer during 

the period of measurements. 

In addition, in order to analyze the influence of other Van Genuchten´s parameters in our case 

study, we fixed hydraulic conductivity value to be 0.65 cm/min and several new simulations 

were carried out by changing  , ? and n and then were compared with the first moment analysis 

inferred from ERT images. We used the Rosetta range of Van Genuchten´s parameters for sands 

in Table.5.2. We fixed the saturated water content to be 37% and constrained the residual water 

content not to exceed from 4% based on the observed water contents of the extracted samples. 

We found that although changing theses parameters in mentioned range influenced the simulated 

model significantly, it is still insignificant comparing to the importance of the hydraulic 

conductivity role in dynamics of the unsaturated sandstone. To better visualize the influence of 

these changes in our simulations, the maximum deviation of centre-of-mass vertical motions 

by  , ? and n changes were shown in Fig.5.25. 

The vertical water movement simulations were shown in Fig.5.26 to provide a mean to better 

visualize the water movement in unsaturated zone in order to compare the flow simulations with 

results inferred from ERT images. A homogenous soil using Van Genuchten’s parameters listed 

in table5.1a and saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 0.65 cm/min were used in this 

simulation. The water distribution inferred from ERT images (Fig.5.18 a-h) is to some extent 

different with flow simulations shown in Fig.5.26 (particularly near the borders); however the 

vertical water movement is consistent. The results indicates that the estimated hydraulic 

conductivity well reproduce the water movement. The observed discrepancy between ERT and 

simulated model is not surprising due to simplification of our simulations to homogenous soil, 

while based on findings summarized in section 5.2 we knew that the soil texture is not fully 

uniform along the profile. In addition, the water injection test always contains some unexpected 

errors (e.g. damaged pressure compensating dripper) which make water injection during the 

experiment not to be ideally uniform. Also, the inversion process and the presence of the noise in 

ERT data are other factor that may contribute to observed disparities between the ERT and 

simulated model.

5.4.6. Synthetic Test 
Synthetic numerical experiment was performed to examine how the ERT method could 

inherently alter the spatial moment analysis results and thereby influence the resulting of 

hydrologic parameters characterization. Forward hydrologic simulation of water movement 

during the water injection was performed. The van Genukhten parameters listed in Table 5.1a 

with Ks equal to 0.65 were used in this synthetic test. Afterward, the development of water 

infiltration was inverted to electrical resistivity maps using equation 5.1. The electrical resistivity 

maps were then used as input for a forward model calculation using the RES2DMOD program. 

We used the same measurement configuration as used in the field. The forward models obtained 

with RES2DMOD program were subsequently used as input for inversion. 5% random errors 

were added to the synthetic data and the forward models were then inverted using RES2DINV. 

Finally, the inverted models were used to calculate spatial moment analysis. The inversion of the 

synthetic data were carried out using independent inversion, the crossmodel regularization and 

4D space–time methods (discussed in 3-3) in order to provide an insight into different inversion 

method resulting in spatial moment analyzes. The same discretization was used for all inversion 

process as well as simulated model. The synthetic test was designed only to be used as a means 

to identify errors associated with the ERT method and inversion process and therefore cannot be 

compared with the moment analysis results conducted on the real data.  

The estimated values of mass, centre of mass vertical motion and vertical spread based on the 

simulation of water movement and the synthetic data are shown in Fig. 5.27, 5.28 and 5.29 

respectively. (I) in Fig.5.27 to 5-29 show the spatial moment analyzes inferred from the 

simulated model and (II), (III) and (IV) were inferred from the synthetic data inverted by 

independent inversion, the crossmodel regularization and 4-D space–time methods respectively. 

Fig.5.27, illustrates that the water tracer mass is overpredicted by the ERT method. All inversion 

methods used in the synthetic test overestimated the mass in system; however, the 4-D space–

time model yielded a better resolution in mass recovery particularly at the beginning of the 

experiment.  

The centre of mass vertical motion was shown in Fig.5.28. The centre of mass vertical motion 

inferred from the synthetic test is ahead of the simulated model. There is a significant difference 

between the 4-D space–time model and two other inverted models at the beginning in Fig.5.28. 

Although the centre of mass vertical motion inferred from the 4-D space–time model was also 



123 
 

overpredicted, the estimated values are nonetheless quite close to the true value (difference 

?20%).  On the other hand, the vertical spread is more difficult to determine correctly. Fig. 5.29 

shows a drastic difference between the values inferred from the synthetic test and simulated 

model. This result is not surprising, since the ERT data were inverted using a smoothness 

optimization method which spreads the water tracer location more widely over the area of 

interest. 

The results of synthetic test indicates a great difference between the spatial moment analyzes 

inferred from 4-D space–time model and two others inversion models at the beginning of the 

experiment. Although, in all inversion methods a coarser vertical discretization was used near the 

electrodes to increase the sensitivity, the water tracer is a small target at the beginning to capture 

properly in inversion process. The large contrast between the electrical conductivity of injected 

water and background also make the inversion process more difficult to recover the sharp 

anomaly accurately. The 4-D space–time model did a better job and the result of this method is 

very close to simulated model. As the water tracer penetrated deeper and became more dispersed, 

the results of other inversion methods become more similar and stable and ERT method is more 

successful in capturing the water movement and therefore the centre of mass vertical motion and 

the vertical spread were estimated more accurately.  

The synthetic test results and moment analyze calculations indicate that the determination of the 

centre of mass vertical motion is fairly robust when the water tracer penetrated to deeper zone 

(with the less than 20% difference between synthetic test and simulated model). In contrary, 

predicting the vertical spread of the water tracer is more troublesome. The high sensitivity of the 

second moment analysis computation due to inversion process and noisy dataset in borehole 

ERT survey were also reported by e.g. Binley et al. (2002b), Singha and Gorelick, (2005) and 

Looms et al. (2008).   

The first and second moment computations of field ERT data show also a drastic distortion at the 

beginning in comparison with the synthetic test. Apart from the inversion effect, the influence of 

electrodes at near surface and also water injection might have intensified this contrast between 

field data and synthetic test.

5.5. Conclusions: 

The results of our experiment in Samora-Correia, where the infiltration process was monitored 

under natural condition and also forced infiltration experiment using ERT and EM38 allow to 

the following conclusions: 

 
 

1. The moisture content variations in unsaturated sandstone and consequently the resistivity 

changes are mainly influenced by daily rainfall due to the fast infiltration in high-

permeability sediments. The both ERT and EM38 are capable to present qualitative maps 

of moisture content distribution; however the fast infiltration in unsaturated sandstone, 

make it impractical to monitor water movement under natural condition to estimate and 

constrain hydrologic parameters. In addition, we found it very difficult to work with 

EM38 over a dry sandy soil due to the reasons discussed in 5.3.5. 

 

2. The water injection test conducted at the Samorra Correia proves that fast infiltration in 

permeable sediments can be monitored by ground surface ERT successfully. The large 

contrast between the electrical conductivity of injected water and soil in this study 

simplified using the ground surface ERT to monitor unsaturated sandstone and was not 

essential to apply a saline tracer which might cause gravitational sinking of the tracer 

during the experiment and requires more complicated interpretation.  

 

3. In spite of poor resolution of ERT images to reproduce the precise water tracer mass, 

moment analysis aimed at constraining the hydrological model. The first and second 

moment analysis in this study constrains the range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity 

to be in 0.5-1.2 (cm/min). Moreover, the investigation of the influence of van 

Genuchten’s parameters in unsaturated flowing simulation confirms again the importance 

of the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation among van Genuchten’s parameters. 

Since the synthetic test indicates that ERT method and inversion effects could 

dramatically overestimate and distorts the vertical spread in this experiment, the first 

moment is a more reliable tool to constrain the hydraulic conductivity.  On the other 

hand, the first moment also was slightly overestimated by ERT method, therefore the 



127 
 

range of 0.5-0.7 cm/min could be a more accurate estimation for hydraulic conductivity 

in this study. 

 

4. The synthetic test shows that the 4-D space-time inversion model is significantly more 

successful in mapping resistivity changes in this experiment. We also found that the 4-D 

space-time method is more user-friendly among methods discussed in section 3-3. It was 

very difficult to apply the crossmodel regularization on our data due to the presence of 

noise in initial data sets. In addition, the synthetic test in this study shows how ERT 

method and inversion process inherently changes the shape and magnitude of the water 

tracer. The correct estimation of the hydrologic parameters depends highly on how well 

the vertical changes in electrical resistivity are captured by the ERT method. Therefore, 

the survey design, i.e., electrode spacing, measurement configuration, the inversion 

algorithm and the electrodes contacts should be optimized in order to improve the vertical 

resolution. This is one of many factors that could have an impact on the results. 

 

5. The temperature data shows more than 5°c variations during the water injection that 

affects significantly (about 10%) in ERT images and is highly required to be modified for 

a quantitative model.  

 
6. Using Archie’s law instead of the established in-situ relationship for conversion of the 

electrical conductivity to moisture content will considerably underestimates moisture

6.1. Introduction 

ERT images are increasingly being converted to hydrological models to estimates of water 

content or solute mass using petrophysical relationships. The converted images can then be used 

for the estimation of soil hydraulic and transport properties. This method is referred to as 

uncoupled hydrogeophysical inversion (Ferre et al., 2009). In fact in uncoupled hydro-

geophysical inversion, ERT data first are inverted and then converted to soil hydraulic and 

transport properties. This method was used in previous chapters to estimate hydraulic 

parameters. As discussed in chapter four and five and was also demonstrated in the synthetic test 

in chapter 5, the inversion procedures may propagate measurement errors and uncertainties 

related to parameter resolution that arise during the independent inversion of the geophysical 

data to the hydrologic analysis. Geophysical inverse procedures commonly require the use of 

prior information (e.g. a smoothness constraint) to stabilize inversion problems (e.g. Menke, 

1984). It has been recognized that this regularization may not reflect the hydrologic conditions 

and can limit the value of hydraulic property estimates derived from geophysical observations. 

Temporal inversion techniques as we used can effectively reducing the inversion uncertainty by 

interpreting multiple images simultaneously. However, time-lapse inversion still relies on an 

independent ERT inversion step to infer hydrologic states. We also showed in the synthetic test 

in 5.4.6 that even time-lapse inversion can lead to uncertain estimates of soil hydraulic 

properties.    

In contrary, in the coupled approach, geophysical measurements are directly used in the 

hydrological model by coupling a forward model of the geophysical measurements with a 

hydrological model. The parameters of the hydrological model (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) are 

changed until the closest match is obtained between simulated model and observed data. The link 

between these simulated hydrological properties (e.g. soil water content) and the geophysical 

properties required for the modeling of the geophysical measurements (e.g. bulk electrical 

conductivity) is provided by appropriate local-scale petrophysical relationships (Hinnel et al., 

2010). The distinguishing factor in the coupled inversion strategy is that, for any observed 

geophysical data set, we couple a hydrologic and geophysical model to represent the forward 

model in the optimization. In practice, this is achieved through a straightforward process where 

an initial set of hydraulic parameters is proposed and a forward hydrologic is run using these 

parameter values. The model predicted hydrologic states (e.g. water content) are converted to 



130 
 

geophysical properties using petrophysical relations. The hydraulic properties are optimized to 

minimize the difference between predicted and measured geophysical observations. Coupled 

model does not require a geophysical inversion step, thereby avoiding geophysical resolution 

problems due to inversion artifact. Rather, all of the data are considered in a single process 

technique by coupling the hydrologic model and the geophysical models. In summary, because 

coupled inversion interprets the geophysical data in the context of the proposed hydrologic 

model, it provides a better test of the consistency of the proposed hydrologic model with the 

geophysical observations. Flowcharts of uncoupled (a) and coupled (b) integration of 

geophysical and hydrological analysis are outlined in Fig.6.1.

6.2. 1D coupled hydrogeoelectrical model 

In this study, we used the 2D surface ERT data collected under forced-infiltration with a constant 

flux rate (discussed in section 5.4.2) to apply the coupled hydrogeoelectrical approach to ERT 

and inflow data for the estimation of topsoil hydraulic properties. We will present and discuss 

here the results of five Vertical Electric Sounding (VES) data from 2D ERT datasets with the 

largest depth of investigation. In Fig.2, we highlighted selected VES by a black rectangle. The 

deepest VES is in the middle of electrodes spread (Marked with “M”) includes 19 measurements 

with minimum and maximum current electrode (AB/2) expansion of 0.45 m and 5.85m 

respectively. The first left and right side of M (Marked with “L1” and “R1” respectively) include 

18 measurements with maximum AB/2 of 5.55m. Finally the second left and right side of M 

(Marked with “L2” and “R2” respectively) include 17 measurements with maximum AB/2 of 

5.25m.

The specific problem we consider is the use of VES data to monitor the water movement over a 

homogenous soil during 1D infiltration medium with uniform initial pressure head. As discussed 

in 5.4.2, the ERT data consisted of a time series of measurements during and after the water 

injection test. We used the first eight time-lapse ERT data which were measured during the water 

injection for our investigations.  

The coupled hydrogeoelectrical model requires two forward models: a hydrologic model and a 

geoelectrical model and also a petrophysical relation.  

6.2.1. 1D hydrologic model  

The hydrologic model enables the simulation of water movement with depth and time based on a 

numerical solution of Richards’equation. To develop a simplified 1D model of unsaturated flow, 

h-based formulation of equation 3.39 was used as discussed in 3.5.3. We used van Genuchten 

equations (3.37 and 3.38) to obtain a predictive equation for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 

function in terms of soil water retention parameters. The time step (?t) and space step (?z) in all 

simulations were selected to be 1 second and 1 cm respectively. The infiltrations models were 

tested against HYDRUS 1d software to evaluate the results. The results were consistent with 

HYDRUS 1d (not shown here). The mass errors in our simulations were less than 2%.     

6.2.2. 1D resistivity forward modeling  

In the forward modeling problem, the subsurface resistivity distribution is specified and the 

purpose is to calculate the apparent resistivity that would be measured by a survey over such a 

structure (Loke, 2004). For the 1-D case, where the subsurface is restricted to a number of 

horizontal layers, the linear filter method discussed in 3.2.3 is commonly used. The subroutine 

developed by Santos et al. (1997) based on the filter method was used to calculate the apparent 

resistivity. 

6.2.3. Petrophysical Relation 

The hydrologic and electrical conductivity models are linked by the dependence of the soil 

electrical conductivity on the soil water content. Equation 5.1 was used in order to convert soil 

water content to bulk resistivity. 

 



134 
 

6.3. Solution of the Analytical Model 

First, a hydrological model was developed. To achieve an infiltration model, all five van 

Genuchten´s parameters (?r, ?s, ?, n, and Ks) must be estimated. We fixed ?r and ?s to be 0.37 

and 0.03 based on the results discussed in 5.2.  ?, n and Ks parameters range were extracted from 

ROSETTA database range for sandstone listed in Table.6.1. The parameter ranges were then 

sampled using a Latin hypercube method (LHS). This method works like a constrained Monte 

Carlo sampling approach (McKay et al., 1979). Each parameter range is subdivided into M 

equally probable intervals. For each interval, one value is selected at random and subsequently 

paired at random with similarly determined values of the remaining parameters, resulting in M 

independent realizations. All parameters were assumed to be uniformly distributed within the 

specified intervals. A public domain software Latin hypercube sampling tool was used 

(http://www.mathepi.com/epitools/lhs/nrpage.html). In this study, the hydraulic parameters were 

assumed to be uncorrelated.  

Afterward, a forward resistivity model was coupled to each hydrological model using 

Equation.5.1. This allows the simulation of soil water content can be converted into simulated 

resistivity distributions. The simulated resistivity images were then used as input for resistivity 

forward modeling to calculate ERT data. The simulated data were finally compared with the 

field ERT data using following equation:  

 

                                                                                    (6.1) 
where ?r is the average relative data error of the transfer resistances and is equal to 0.08 (Looms 

et al., 2008)

135 
 

6.4. Results 

1000 parameter sets were sampled using LHS. Flow and transport simulations were then run for 

each parameter set using the same initial and boundary conditions. A homogenous soil was 

selected for all simulations. The bottom boundary of the soil column was simulated by 

implementing a free drainage boundary condition. The upper boundary condition was a specified 

flux of 1.792 cm h?1 corresponding to 20% of the applied irrigation. This value was estimated 

from the mass error calculated using moment analysis in 5.4.3. The simulations were carried out 

for 180 minutes and the evaporation was neglected in all simulations. 

To evaluate whether the unsaturated hydraulic parameters are constrained by the data, we plotted 

the misfit value (calculated from Equation.6.1) as a function of parameter values Ks, n and ? in 

Fig.6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 respectively. Each figure has five sections which are related to the misfit 

values of different VES datasets. a, b, c, d and e in each figure presents the results of misfit 

values obtained using L2, L1, M, R1 and R2 datasets respectively. Only the 100 realizations with 

the lowest misfit are included in the figures for illustration purpose. The parameter ranges of the 

realizations with the lower misfit values are highlighted with red arrows in all figures and were 

also listed in table.6.1. By comparing the extent of the range of each parameter with the a priori 

range of the selected parameter and by evaluating whether the dots with low misfit values are 

clustered at certain parameter ranges, it becomes clear whether the data can reduce the 

uncertainty of the hydraulic parameters investigated.  

Fig.6.3 and 6.4 indicate that the parameter ranges of Ks and n are constrained compared with the 

a priori range. Values of Ks in Fig 6.3 (expect 6.3b) centered around 0.80 cm min?1, appear to 

result in slightly lower misfits between the simulated and ERT model and the misfit plots exhibit 

a clustering at this intermediate Ks value. The results of L2, M, R1 and R2 are acceptably 

consistent while L1 exhibits a wider range. The estimated range of Ks shows a very good 

consistency with the results in chapter 5. Values of n in Fig.6.4 (expect 6.3d) are also constrained 

in range of 2-3.6. The results of L2, L1, M and R2 are to some extent consistent, but R1 shows a 

wider range.  

In contrary, Fig.6.5 show that the parameter ? is not constrained by the ERT data, since the range 

of the lower misfit realizations is almost identical to the a priori range in most of ERT datasets 

and the dots do not exhibit any structure.

6.5. Conclusions 

We have developed a coupled hydrogeoelectrical inversion framework in order to estimate three 

van Genuchten parameters (?, n and Ks) from electrical resistances and inflow measurements 

obtained during constant head infiltration. The collected data were used in a forward manner to 

evaluate a series of plausible hydrologic models. By avoiding the use of geophysical inversion 

tools, uncertainties connected with inversion, such as artifacts and subjective constraints (e.g. 

regularization choice) were eliminated. The results showed that the joint interpretation of inflow 

and resistance measurements provide reasonably good constraints on the estimation of Ks and n.  

Mass balance considerations in simulated model revealed that water was being diverted away 

from the measurement area; however, the consistency of the water loss during the infiltration led 

us to adopt an effective average infiltration rate of 20% the applied irrigation. We feel confident 

that this assumption is valid, but one could consider estimating the effective infiltration in future 

analyses to minimize this uncertainty. It is not the only source of uncertainty in our study. The 

proposed methodology still required assumptions regarding choice of petrophysical relationships, 

soil structure, investigated parameter ranges, misfit functions and data error levels. All these 

variables are connected with uncertainty and represent subjective considerations that may 

influence the obtained results markedly.

7.1. Conclusions 

 

The key finding of this research was that the apparent electrical conductivity data produced by 

ERT and EM38 can be used to measure soil moisture and estimate hydrological properties of 

unsaturated zone. These methods can efficiently develop the dense datasets for describing spatial 

soil properties variability.  

The results of this study show that the EM38 is a useful tool for soil moisture measurement and 

hence potentially useful in agricultural industry. EM38 proved to be capable in mapping 

moisture content variation in shallow zone where the soil is not very dry. A very dry soil is not 

an ideal target when a quantitative and temporal study is required due to the strong influence of 

noise in low values of electrical conductivity. EM38 has the advantage of being less expensive, 

much faster, and easier to use in data collection in comparison with the ERT method. 

Furthermore, EM38 can cover a larger area in regional investigation. Paying special attention to 

both data collection and inversion is greatly important in order to achieve a quantitative model.  

The ground surface ERT study in Samorra Correia proves that fast infiltration in permeable 

sediments can be monitored successfully by ERT surveys. ERT method also yielded an 

acceptable quantitative model at the campus of University of Lisbon in a location where had a 

loam soil with low permeability and high water retention capacity. The results of ERT surveys 

show a better resolution in mapping the spatiotemporal resistivity changes in comparison with 

EM38 where a quantitative model is required.   

1D coupled hydrogeoelectrical model developed in this study showed that the data collected 

provided information enough to constrain the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, and the van 

Genuchten parameter n, while it was not possible to constrain the parameter ?. Using additional 

geophysical data such as GPR and EM38 might aim at better constraining the van Genuchten 

parameters. Additional information, such as pressure measurements and correlation of the van 

Genuchten parameters could be also incorporated to constrain the hydrologic model. 

 

 

 



146 
 

Our study on inversion effects in soil characterization reveals the importance of a careful 

consideration of inverse problem to avoid the effects of overparameterization and smoothing 

from regularization. Our investigation in both study areas demonstrates that the 4-D space-time 

method proposed by Kim et al. (2009) could results in a more accurate model with lower 

artefacts; however the synthetic test indicates that even the 4-D space-time method still changes 

the shape of the model. Extending the use of coupled hydrological and geophysical models in 

hydrology investigation can be significantly reducing the uncertainty by avoiding the 

uncertainties connected with inversion. 

Assumptions in both study areas regarding the conceptual geologic model, including the 1D or 

2D flow assumption, the homogonous soil setup and the assumed constant petrophysical 

parameters. Most of these assumptions were made to simplify the conceptual model and 

minimize the number of free parameters.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



147 
 

7.2. Recommendations 

This study was confined to two small study areas with nearly uniform soil, to minimize the 

influence of factors other than soil moisture on EM38 and ERT data. While the results of the 

study are positive, extension of the study to different areas with a range of soil types is required 

to evaluate and generalize the results. 

 

Further recommendations include: 

To our knowledge no attempt has been made to develop time-lapse inversions in EMI field. The 

absence of time-lapse inversion of EM38 data made the results unstable and noisy in this study 

where independent inversion of dataset was carried out and resistivity variation maps were 

achieved by subtraction of pixel-by-pixel values from a background image. Developing a time-

lapse inversion algorithm for EM38 data will be a concrete step for expansion of EM38 use in 

soil characterization where a dense multiple dataset is required. 

In this study, the hydraulic parameters were assumed to be uncorrelated. In future work, it would 

be of benefit to include correlation between parameters to constrain the parameter ranges. 

Considering the parameters correlation allows a more efficient sampling of the parameter space 

by constraining less free parameters. In addition, all analysis was based on the key assumption 

that the hydrologic model could be expressed using the van Genuchten parameterization. These 

models may not be the best in the study areas where we were working. Attempts should therefore 

be made to test additional parameterization approaches to evaluate our research. 

The 1D coupled hydrogeoelectrical model developed in this study was used to constrain three 

parameters (Ks, n and ?) of Van Genukhten parameters. The coupled approach can be used to 

evaluate whether or not the approach can aim at constraining r and s where information of 

these parameters is not available. Since the result of the coupled model is positive, extension of 

the coupled approach to integrating EM38 and hydrologic model is recommended. In addition, 

this coupled model was limited to 1d approach. In order better to describe the hydraulic 

properties of the subsurface, 2D extension of this program for both EM38 and ERT methods can 

be achieved using 2D forward geophysical and hydrological models.

Resumo Alargado 

A caracterização hidrológica dos primeiros 1-2 metros do solo, é amplamente reconhecida 

como sendo crucial em agricultura. A condutividade hidráulica é uma propriedade do solo 

que determina a capacidade de movimentação da água neste meio e, embora se reconheça a 

sua grande importância continua a ser um dos parâmetros mais difíceis de estimar.As técnicas 

laboratoriais têm limitações devido ao tamanho da amostra e ao facto das condições 

laboratoriais não serem as mesmas que no terreno, havendo preferência pelas técnicas de 

medição in-situ. Assim, o desenvolvimento de métodos de monitorização espaço-temporal do 

conteúdo em água no solo é muito importante para o controlo daquele parâmetro. 

Investigações recentes mostraram que os métodos de geofísica aplicada são uma alternativa 

económica, e com a vantagem de serem métodos não evasivos, para a caracterização 

hidrológica do solo. Os métodos directos, baseado em furos, provocam alterações nas 

condições naturais do terreno.  Acresce que as medições usando métodos directos não podem 

ser repetidas no tempo e no mesmo local, embora a caracterização hidrológica do solo exija 

essa repetição. A monitorização geofísica, usando métodos 4D (espaço-tempo) é uma 

ferramenta poderosa que pode ser usada para adquirir dados que permitam a estimativa das 

variáveis hidrológicas que dependem do tempo, como a condutividade hidráulica. 

Neste estudo, utilizaram-se medidas da condutividade eléctrica obtidas através de tomografia 

eléctrica e da aplicação do equipamento EM38 para a construção de uma base de dados, com 

o objectivo de estudar as variações espaço-temporais do conteúdo em água e, também, 

estimar as propriedades hidráulicas de um solo não saturado. Este estudo foi realizado em 

dois locais distintos: um em condições naturais e um outro em situação de injecção de água. 

O primeiro estudo foi realizado no Campus da Universidade de Lisboa, num local em que o 

terreno é predominantemente argiloso, com permeabilidade baixa e grande capacidade de 

retenção de água. O segundo estudo foi realizado em Samora Correia (a Leste de Lisboa) 

num local de solo arenoso com permeabilidade elevada e com fraca capacidade de retenção 

de água. As variações de temperatura do solo foram medidas durante as experiências e o 

efeito da variação da condutividade com a temperatura foi avaliado em ambos os conjuntos 

de dados adquiridos (EM38 e resistividade), assumindo uma variação da resistividade de 2%  

por cada grau Celsius de variação da temperatura. 

A estimativa das propriedades hidráulicas do solo não saturado foi feita com base em 

simulações de fluxo de água. Os modelos hidrológicos utilizados permitem a simulação do 



158 
 

movimento da água em profundidade e em função do tempo com base na solução numérica 

da equação de Richard. Assumiu-se que a capacidade de retenção da água e a condutividade 

são bem representadas pelos parâmetros de van Genuchten (1980).  A equação de Richard foi 

utilizada para o desenvolvimento de um modelo 1D, utilizando um passo temporal de 1 s e 

espacial de 1 cm. Os resultados do modelo foram comparados com os do programa HYDRUS 

1D com o objectivo de validar o modelo, tendo-se observado que os resultados são 

consistentes com os calculados pelo HYDRUS. Os erros associados às estimativas da massa 

de água são, aproximadamente de 2%. Para as simulações do movimento de água em meio  

2D utilizou-se o programa HYDRUS. 

O cálculo dos parâmetros de Genuchten foi feito utilizando-se duas aproximações.Na 

primeira, sem os constrangimentos dos dados geofísicos e,na segunda usando esses 

constrangimentos. No primeiro caso os dados geofísicos foram invertidos e os modelos 

obtidos usados na estimativa dos parâmetros hidrológicos utilizando-se as relações empíricas  

(determinadas in-situ) entre a resitividade e o conteúdo em água (? vs. S). Esta aproximação 

foi usada considerando um modelo 2D. A inversão,  utilizando todos os dados recolhidos na 

experiência de monitorização, foi realizada usando-se técnicas de inversão conhecidas por 

“time-lapse”, com o objectivo de reduzir as incertezas. Mais especificamente, foram usados 

os seguintes métodos: o método da razão (ratio method), das diferenças (difference inversion 

method), model cruzado (cross model) e a inversão 4D. Os modelos de resistividade (ERT) e 

EM38 foram então usados para o cálculo do conteúdo em água usando-se as relações entre a 

resistividade (condutividade) e o conteúdo em água, previamente estabelecidas para cada 

local.Utilizou-se o método da análise dos momentos, aplicado aos modelos geofísicos, para 

se calcularem as condutividades hidráulicas. Neste método procura-se quantificar a massa do 

sistema, a localização do centro demassa e o modo como a massa se desloca no tempo. 

Comparando os resultados do método dos momentos com os obtidos das simulações de 

infiltração, foi possívelobter uma estimativa da condutividade hidráulica. 

O estudo relizado no campus da Universidade de Lisboa, usando o primeiro método mostrou 

que ambos os conjuntos de dados geofísicos (EM38 e ERT) conseguiram detectar variações 

da resistividade do solo representativas da variação sazonal do conteúdo de água. Os 

resultados indicaram que o conteúdo em água, mesmo no verão, dificilmente diminui abaixo 

de 20%. Apenas se observaram valor baixos de conteúdo em água em zonas muito 

superficiais do terreno e durante o verão.Durante o período chuvoso, o conteúdo em água 

atinge valores de 30%. Os resultados mostram que o solo no campus é semi-permeável. A 



159 
 

variação espaço-temporal do conteúdo de água é da ordem de 10%. Os cálculos realizados 

usando os dados de EM38 e ERT sugerem que a condutividade hidráulica deverá ser da 

ordem de 1-10 cm/dia. Neste local, os resultados obtidos com o EM38 são compatíveis com 

os obtidos pelaresistividade (ERT). 

Na segunda zona de estudo (em Samora Correia), os resultados mostraram que as variações 

do conteúdo em água e, consequentemente, da resistividade.São fundamentalmente 

condicionadas pela precipitação diária devido à rápida infiltração e elevada permeabilidade 

hidráulica dos sedimentos arenosos. Os dados de ERT e de EM38 são capazes de mostrar de 

modo qualitativo a distribuição do conteúdo em água. Ambos os métodos são capazes de 

detectar variações na distribuição do conteúdo em água, no entanto, a rápida infiltração na 

zona não saturada, torna impraticável a monitorização para a estimativa e constrangimento 

dos parâmetros hidrológicos do movimento da água em condições naturais. Adicionalmente, 

verificou-se ser muito difícil trabalhar com o EM38 em solo arenoso e seco.  Assim, 

desenhou-se e levou-se a efeito uma experiência de injecção controlada de água. Nestas 

condições foi possível monitorizar a rápida infiltração usando o méodo da resistividade. O 

método do momento constrangiu o intervalo dos valores da condutividade hidráulica saturada 

entre 0.5 e 1.2 cm/min. 

Foi realizado um estudo numérico com o objectivo de verificar até que ponto a inversão (não 

contrangida) de dados de resistividade pode alterar a análise do método dos momentos e 

influenciar a estimativa dos parâmetros hidrológicos. Os resultados deste teste mostram que 

há uma influência significativa da inversão. Contudo, foi possível verificar que a inversão 4D 

apresenta resultados satisfatórios. 

No segundo método utilizado neste estudo, os dados geofísicos foram usados directamente no 

modelo hidrológico. Nesta aproximação os parâmetros hidrológicos foram alterados até se 

obter concordância entre os dados experimentais e as respostas do modelo. Desenvolveu-se 

um modelo 1D com o objectivo de determinar os três parâmetros de van Genuchten (?, n and 

Ks)a partir da resistividade eléctricae da água infiltrada. Os dados adquiridos em Samora 

Correia, no teste de injecção deágua foram então utilizados na avaliação de um conjunto de 

modelos hidrológicos prováveis. Dado que não se utilizou nenhuma inversão de dados 

geofísicos, as incertezas devido ao processo de inversão, tais como artefactos matemáticos e 

constrangimento subjectivos foram eliminados. Os resultados obtidos da aplicação deste 

método, revelaram-se constrangimentos razoáveis na estimativa de Ks e n. Os valores obtidos

mostram uma boa coerência com os obtidos com a aplicação do primeirométodo assumindo 

modelos 2D.
