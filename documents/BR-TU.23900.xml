ABSTRACT 

Production of hydrocarbons is a high-risk business. The uncertainties inherent to production 

are related to the uncertainties in the physical state of the reservoir and external variables. 

Reservoir uncertainty can be reduced as new production and dynamic data become available. 4D 

seismic technology has been used in the petroleum industry because the integration of geophysics 

and engineering information increases the predictive capability of reservoir simulations. 

However, there are technical issues to be addressed before starting a 4D seismic project. Several 

geophysical studies use the chance of success concept to identify the favorable cases; evaluating 

the seismic survey and the magnitude of seismic changes. From the engineering point of view, it 

is important to evaluate the impact of new information on field operations and the consequent 

monetary benefit. The estimation of 4D seismic data chance of success before its acquisition is a 

challenge. Therefore, the thesis presents a methodology to estimate the chance of success of a 4D 

seismic project from the reservoir engineering perspective. The methodology was developed in 

three phases. The first phase shows that water saturation error can measure the improvement on 

the fluid behavior understanding due to 4D seismic data. Moreover, it shows that the time for 4D 

seismic data acquisition affects its value. The second phase presents the methodology to estimate 

the best time to acquire 4D seismic data. The best time estimation is determined by evaluating 

time for water breakthrough and the water saturation error curves. Finally, the chance of success 

methodology is presented. The methodology is simple and an iterative process. It is divided in six 

steps, in which some of them are well established in the literature. The thesis incorporates the 

date of 4D seismic data acquisition in the process and assesses the chance of success through the 

variation in the economic benefit caused by the reservoir uncertainties. The methodology was 

applied to a synthetic reservoir model, showing a procedure to estimate the expected value of 

information and the probability of success.

RESUMO 

A produção de hidrocarbonetos é um negócio que envolve muitos riscos. As incertezas inerentes 

à produção estão relacionadas às incertezas no estado físico do reservatório e variáveis externas. 

A incerteza do reservatório pode ser reduzida conforme dados de produção e dinâmicos são 

adquiridos. A sísmica 4D (S4D) tem sido utilizada na indústria de petróleo, pois a integração de 

informação geofísica e de engenharia aumenta a capacidade preditiva da simulação de 

reservatórios. Entretanto, há questões técnicas que devem ser avaliadas antes de se iniciar um 

projeto de S4D. Vários estudos geofísicos usam o conceito de chance de sucesso para identificar 

os casos favoráveis onde são avaliados o levantamento sísmico e a magnitude das mudanças 

sísmicas. Porém, do ponto de vista de engenharia é importante avaliar o impacto da nova 

informação na operação do campo e o consequente benefício financeiro. A estimativa da chance 

de sucesso de um projeto de S4D é um desafio. Portanto, este trabalho apresenta uma 

metodologia que estima a chance de sucesso sob a perspectiva da engenharia de reservatórios. A 

metodologia foi desenvolvida em três fases. A primeira fase mostra que o erro de saturação de 

água pode ser utilizado para medir a melhora no entendimento da movimentação de fluidos no 

reservatório devido à aquisição da S4D. Além disso, mostra que o momento em que a sísmica 4D 

é adquirida impacta no valor da informação. Na segunda fase a metodologia para determinar o 

melhor momento para a aquisição da S4D é apresentada. O melhor momento é determinado 

avaliando o tempo para a chegada de água nos poços e as curvas de erro de saturação. Por fim, a 

metodologia para a estimativa da chance de sucesso é apresentada. A metodologia é um processo 

iterativo simples. A metodologia é composta por seis etapas, no qual algumas são bem 

estabelecidas na literatura. A tese incorpora a data que aquisição da sísmica 4D no processo e 

avalia a chance de sucesso por meio da variação do beneficio econômico ocasionado pelas 

incertezas do reservatório. A metodologia foi aplicada para um caso sintético para ilustrar o 

procedimento do cálculo do valor da informação e da probabilidade de sucesso.

1. INTRODUCTION 

4D seismic is increasingly being used as qualitative and quantitative description of the 

reservoir behavior for management and decisions making purposes. 4D seismic refers to 

repeating seismic acquisition over time. It provides unique information regarding the dynamic 

properties variations (such as pressure and saturation changes) due to production.  

4D seismic is used to constrain or update a model of the reservoir, to locate undrained oil, 

to optimize well planning and minimize the effect of unexpected events, such as an early 

breakthrough of injected fluids. Knowledge of reservoir connectivity, flow barriers, or bypassed 

hydrocarbons is the kind of information that is expected from 4D seismic data (Waggoner, 1998 

and Kawar et al., 2003).  

Such knowledge helps to optimize reservoir investment decisions and increases the average 

recovery. Due to the actual complexity of the reservoirs, the current average recovery is about 

35%. 4D seismic is an important contribution to increase the recovery factor (Oldenziel, 2003).  

Statoil states that 4D seismic contributes to reach the ambition of increasing the oil 

recovery rate to 60% on the Norwegian shelf. A permanent seismic tool will be used to increase 

the recovery rate; 700 kilometers of seismic cables will be installed on the seabed on the Snorre 

and Grane fields in the North Sea (Statoil, 2014). 

Regarding the Brazilian oil fields, 4D seismic has an important role in the Marlim field 

management. The integration of 4D seismic and production data provided a more realistic 

reservoir model and assisted the optimization of well planning: two wells were canceled, five 

new wells were drilled and many wells were repositioned. The total oil production increased 

4.76% and the production per well increased 24%. Most of the improvement can be attributed to 

the 4D seismic interpretation (Johann et al., 2009). 

Several published cases show that 4D seismic can improve reservoir management and 

increase production efficiency. The following fields can be mentioned: Marlim Sul in Campos 

Basin; Gulfaks in the North Sea; Oseberg, Heidrun and Ekofisk in Norway (Thedy et al., 2007; 

Roste et al., 2006; Sando et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2010).

However, the use of 4D seismic data to monitor carbonate reservoirs in the published 

literature is limited. The time-lapse monitoring in carbonate reservoir is a challenge, because the 

acoustic response is highly variable and there is some debate about the applicability of 

Gassmann’s equation (Chen et al., 2008; Guimarães, 2013). 

4D seismic can be used with commercial advantage in reservoir monitoring; but it is 

necessary to identify the favorable cases before starting a project. Many of the existing 

approaches focus on the geophysical issues of comparing two 3D images. The main objective is 

to verify if it will be possible to detect changes in the seismic response. Without a meaningful 

time-lapse change, there is no useful information derived from 4D seismic processing 

(Waggoner, 1998). 

Behrens et al. (2001) present the key elements of a successful 4D seismic project: 

feasibility, acquisition, processing and interpretation. Feasibility analysis is performed to evaluate 

seismic data ability to identify changes in the reservoir during production. It comprises two 

factors: detectability and repeatability.  

Detectability is the amount of change in the elastic properties of the reservoir associated 

with production. The detectability is determined by evaluating the following characteristics: 

? Reservoir: depth, net pressure, bubble point, temperature, thickness of the reservoir zone 

to be monitored; 

? Rock: dry bulk modulus and porosity; 

? Fluid: gas oil ratio, salinity, fluid saturation change, fluid compressibility contrast; 

? Seismic: dominant seismic frequency, average resolution, image quality, fluid contact 

visibility, travel time change, impedance change. 

 

The repeatability is a measure of similarity of the seismic response between two or more 

seismic surveys. The optimal 4D seismic imaging requires seismic acquisition and processing to 

be “repeatable” from survey to survey, so that differences between time-lapse images can be 

“trusted”.  

Enhanced acquisition repeatability includes using the same acquisition method for each 

survey, accurate source and receiver positioning, shooting seismic lines in the same direction and 

using the same bin spacing and offset (Lumley, 1998).  



3 
 

Unwanted differences in the amplitude and timing of seismic reflections can be created by 

differences in seismic acquisition and processing. In order to interpret amplitude and time 

differences created by the changes in the reservoir properties it is necessary to minimize these 

effects.  

Some of the acquisition effects on 4D seismic data are reduced by minimized streamer 

cable feather, improved design of ocean-bottom and land positioning methods, and installation of 

permanently emplaced receiver arrays. Regarding to the processing phase, the goal is to obtain 

excellent 3D seismic images for each data set, and simultaneously optimize time-lapse 

repeatability in regions of no subsurface change (Behrens et al.,2001 and Lumley, 2001). 

Interpretation of 4D seismic data can be subdivided into qualitative and quantitative. 

Qualitative interpretation recognizes where changes detected by seismic are happening, but only 

infers the significance of those changes. Quantitative interpretation attempts to quantify those 

changes in seismic properties to reservoir properties. 

From the moment that 4D seismic is considered feasible in the geophysical approach, it is 

necessary to evaluate whether the acquisition of new information will be useful for field 

management. 

Two are the benefits that 4D seismic data can bring to the field management. It mitigates 

the risk and increases the economic value of the project. The combination of 4D seismic and well 

data enormously reduces reservoir uncertainty; however, the information increases the economic 

value only if it influences decisions (Pickering, 2003 and Kawar, 2003).  

Marques (2012) presents a method to quantify the risk mitigation. The risk is associated 

with the net present value variability. The variability is measured using the standard deviation. 

The value of information (VOI) quantifies the increase in the economic value of the project. 

The value of 4D seismic data is simpler to determine after data acquisition, because the impact on 

field operations is known. The VOI estimation before data acquisition is more complex due to the 

many possibilities that can come from the process; it may require several simplifications to make 

the process viable.  

The literature does not distinguish between the terminologies used to define the value of 

information calculated before or after data acquisition. Thus, the thesis considers that the value 

calculated after and before data acquisition are termed: value of information (VOI) and expected 



4 
 

value of information (EVOI), respectively. The inclusion of the word expected is necessary 

because the value calculated is a weighted measure.  

The expected value of 4D seismic data depends on four factors presented in Figure 1.1. 

These factors should be included in the EVOI analysis and are described as follows: 

(1) Date of acquisition: the amount of useful information that can be obtained is related to the 

reservoir fluid flow which is variable over the production period; 

(2) Impact on field management: the provided information should impact on field operations 

and generate more monetary benefit than the cost of its acquisition; 

(3) Reservoir uncertainties: if there is a high level of confidence in the reservoir 

characterization, there is no need of additional costs due to the acquisition of new 

information; 

(4) Other source of data: several potential sources of information can improve the decision 

making process and reduce the reservoir uncertainty.

The first feasibility analysis of a 4D seismic project shall be assessed during the field 

development phase, due to the high costs involved in the acquisition and processing of 4D 

seismic data (seabed or towed streamer acquisition). 

A 4D seismic project is approved if: the reservoir under analysis is feasible from the 

geophysical perspective, the new information mitigates the risk of the project and/or the impact 

on the reservoir management increases the economic return.

The thesis aims to quantify the increase in the economic return due to the acquisition of 4D 

seismic data and determine the chance that the quantified value is higher than the costs of 

acquisition and processing.  

The EVOI and the probability density function of the increase on the net present value are 

calculated to incorporate the economic aspect. The methodology to determine the EVOI shall 

consider all aspects mentioned in Figure 1.1, however the literature does not present a method 

that considers the “date of acquisition” aspect. Thus, the thesis also improved the EVOI 

methodology by estimating the best time to acquire 4D seismic data. 

1.1. Motivation 

Currently, the average recovery is quite low due to the complexity of the reservoirs. 

Advances in technologies are continuously occurring at several fronts to assist in increasing the 

production of hydrocarbons. 4D seismic emerged as an important tool because it captures the 

dynamic behavior of the reservoir and aids reservoir management. 

Besides of the many successful reported cases, the feasibility of the acquisition of new 

information must be evaluated. There are two main motivations for conducting a feasibility study. 

First, to determine whether the 4D signal generated by production effects in the reservoir is 

detectable. Second, to assess the impact on field management and the impact on the risk of the 

project. 

There are several methods that assess the feasibility from the geophysical perspective, such 

as the ones presented by Lumley (1998) and Blonk et al. (1998). From the engineering 

perspective, the evaluation is performed by comparing the EVOI with the acquisition and 

processing costs.  

However, the existing methods to calculate the EVOI do not consider the “date of 

acquisition” aspect. Another important issue is that the EVOI is a weighted value. It does not 

show the variability of the increase on the economic return caused by the reservoir uncertainties.  

Due to the importance of assessing the feasibility of a new 4D seismic project, the thesis 

presents a methodology to estimate the chance of success from the reservoir engineering 

perspective. The methodology includes the “date of acquisition” aspect into the process and 



6 
 

determines the probability of the increase on the economic return be higher than the acquisition 

costs. 

1.2. Objectives 

The objective of the thesis is to develop a methodology to estimate the chance of success of 

a 4D seismic project before the information acquisition. The methodology determines the chance 

of success for the first acquisition of 4D seismic data and uses a probabilistic approach of the 

economic benefit to assist the decision maker. Moreover, the methodology is applied to a 

synthetic reservoir model in order to test it in a case with known reservoir. 

1.3. Premises 

The following assumptions are made in order to apply the proposed methodology to 

estimate the chance of success of a 4D seismic project: 

• Pressure and saturation data without noise can be successfully obtained from 4D seismic. 

Several studies present methods to map and quantify these changes using different seismic 

attributes (Tura and Lumley, 1999; Rojas, 2008; Landro, 2001, Trani et al., 2011 and 

Davolio, 2013); 

• All reservoir model uncertainties are identified and quantified; 

• The chance of success estimation considers the first acquisition of 4D seismic data.  

1.4. Outline of the Thesis  

The chance of success methodology is developed in three phases. The first phase evaluates 

the impact of 4D seismic data on the history match process in comparison to the use of only 

production data. Chapter 2 discusses the improvement on predicting the production behavior 

when 4D seismic data is used and evaluates the impact of the date of acquisition on the value of 

4D seismic project.  

The second phase develops a methodology to estimate the date of acquisition in which the 

value of 4D seismic data is maximum. Chapter 3 describes the proposed methodology and its 

application to a synthetic reservoir model. 



7 
 

The last phase develops the methodology to estimate the chance of success. A variety of 

disciplines are involved: uncertainty and risk analysis, selection of representative models and 

production strategy optimization. The methodology incorporates the process presented in 

Chapter 3 and evaluates the number of reservoir model scenarios used to calculate the EVOI.  

Chapter 4 describes the methodology to estimate the chance of success and presents the 

results of its application to a synthetic case. The last chapter presents the conclusions and 

suggestions for future work.

2. IMPACT OF 4D SEISMIC DATA IN THE HISTORY 

MATCHING PROCESS 

2.1. Introduction 

With the advent of 4D seismic surveys in the early 1980`s, the oil industry began using this 

technology as an indirect tool for monitoring fluid flow (Fahimuddin, 2010). Assuming that 4D 

seismic signals can be interpreted in terms of reservoir properties, the large amounts of data are 

integrated with production and other data available to improve the reservoir simulation model. 

Constraining the reservoir model to the historical data is referred to as history matching. 

The objective is to obtain a better match between the observed data and reservoir simulation 

results by iteratively perturbing the uncertain model parameters. The reservoir model has to 

correspond to the historical behavior of the actual reservoir, before one may trust production 

forecasts and handle accordingly.  

Reservoir management is a complex task that heavily depends on the reservoir simulation 

model. A reservoir simulation model is used to analyze the behavior of the reservoir and to 

forecast future behavior. Constraining the model to all available information raises confidence in 

its forecasting capabilities.  

The combination of 4D seismic data (high lateral resolution) with well data (high vertical 

resolution) enormously reduces uncertainty and increases the accuracy of the production forecast 

(Stephen et al., 2006). Reservoir management benefits from the reservoir model improvement 

because decisions can be made to increase the economic return of the project, such as well 

optimization, identification of remaining oil and drilling potential areas. 

Time lapse seismic is available in a qualitative and quantitative form in a number of North 

Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Campos Basin fields (Johnston et al., 2000; Thedy et al. 2007; Roste 

and Husby, 2006; Smith et al., 2010). The integration of 4D seismic data has been made with 

different history matching methodologies.  

Stephen (2006) presents an automatic history matching method based on an integrated 

workflow. The method uses a quasi-global stochastic method for choosing new models based on 

calculated misfits between observed and predicted data.  



10 
 

Fahimuddin (2010) performed 4D seismic history matching of a sector model based on 

North Sea reservoir in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework. The work of Roggero et 

al. (2012) focused on the advance parametrization technique to constrain fine scale geo-statistical 

model by means of gradual deformation method in the framework of history matching of the 

Girassol field. 

A model conditioned to 4D seismic data has an improved accuracy of the production 

forecast. Thus, this Chapter evaluates the improvement on the accuracy of the production forecast 

by including 4D seismic data into the history matching process. Moreover, discuss the utility of 

4D seismic regarding to the date of seismic acquisition. 

2.2. Objective 

Chapter 02 aims to: (1) compare the improvement of the reservoir model obtained using 

only production data and using production data along with 4D seismic data in the history 

matching process (2) evaluate the impact of the date of 4D seismic acquisition on the value of 

time lapse data. 

2.3. Assumptions  

In order to perform the study some simplifications and assumptions are made: 

• The model used is synthetic and simple, representing a specific part of the field, in order to 

make the analysis simpler;  

• Eight simulation models are used: base model, base model history matched using two, four 

and six years of production data; base model history matched using two, four and six years 

of production data along with seismic data and the reference model (true earth model); 

• The base model is not history matched. It is known that such model gets closer to the 

reference model as long as the history matching process is done using production data; 

• Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic. Water saturation 

and pressure maps are generated from the reference model simulation; 

• The time for acquiring and processing the 4D seismic information is not considered in the 

process. 



11 
 

• The study is performed after the information acquisition to evaluate the impact of the 

resulting data; 

• It is known that the history matching process is a non-unique process. However, the 

analysis is performed in a deterministic manner to make the analysis simpler. 

2.4. Methodology 

The study is divided into two cases and the evaluation of both is based on the mismatch in 

the output of the reference reservoir model and the history matched models. The description of 

each case is as follows: 

(1) Case 1: comparison of the results obtained from the history matched models using only 

production data and using production data along with seismic data acquired at four years of 

production; 

(2) Case 2: comparison of the results obtained from the history matched models using only 

production data and using production data along with seismic data at two, four and six 

years of production. 

 

In order to evaluate how seismic can improve the initial simulation model, pressure and 

saturation differences are analyzed by generating error maps and calculating the mismatch 

between the simulated models. 

2.4.1. History Matching Methodology 

History match is one of the most important activities during petroleum reservoirs 

development and management. Matched models are fundamental to ensure reliable forecasts, and 

give an idea of the level of understanding of the geological models. The history match process 

consists in changing uncertain field simulation model attributes, respecting its uncertainty limits, 

to match the historical data (Netto et al., 2003). 

The history match process aims to improve the reservoir model quality. When performed 

only with production data, the main objective is to minimize the difference of production data 

(well pressure, oil, water and gas rate) between observed and simulated data. When performed 



12 
 

with seismic data, the objective includes the reduction in the differences of reservoir saturation 

and pressure maps.  

The literature presents some methodologies for history matching using seismic data. The 

conditioning may be introduced at different levels corresponding to where the mismatch between 

simulated and measured data is evaluated.  

An illustration of the different mismatch levels is shown in Figure 2.1 the levels are: 

amplitude, elastic parameters and fluid changes domain. Methodologies that evaluate the 

mismatch in the amplitude and elastic domain are presented by Stephen et al. (2006) and 

Fahimuddin (2010).  

 

 

Figure 2.1. Different levels of 4D seismic integration (Skjervheim, 2007). 

 

The present study integrates seismic data in the fluid changes domain, as presented by 

Machado (2010). The methodology for history matching is shown in Figure 2.2. Real seismic 



13 
 

data is not acquired; the saturation and pressure maps are generated from the reference model 

simulation.  

The process remains the same for history matching using only production data, except that 

water and pressure saturation maps are not included. In both cases, wells are controlled by liquid 

rate (computed from the reference model) and the parameters to be matched are the water rate 

and well pressure. It is considered that once the liquid rate is informed and the water rate is 

matched, the oil rate is matched as a consequence.

14 
 

The assisted history matching is performed in three steps: data acquisition (historical and 

simulated data), parameterization and optimization. The parameterization phase stands out for its 

importance in the process and requires more dedication of the professional involved. The 

parameterization steps are: 

? Reservoir Zoning: the reservoir is divided into regions according to the type of information 

available. When seismic data is used, two types of regions are considered: attribute regions 

and parameter regions.  

 

A parameter region is the reservoir simulation region where the error is measured and its 

value is incorporated into the objective function. Attribute regions are those where changes 

in the reservoir model attributes are made in the process. These regions are determined 

from the analysis of differences in saturation and pressure maps and streamline 

information;  

 

? Objective Function (FO): the FO is a quantitative evaluation of the history matching. It 

measures the mismatch between simulated and observed data. The FO used is

,                                                                                                                (2.1) 

where, wP and wM are the production and maps objective function weights, respectively. To

                                                                                    (2.3) 

are used. 

 



15 
 

When the process uses production and seismic data, the global function (FO) includes 

production (FOP) and maps (FOM) objective function, otherwise only FOP is considered. 

 

In Equation 2.2, m and n represent the number of wells and parameters to be adjusted, wi 

and wj are the well and the parameters weights, ?j is the parameter measured error. 

 

In Equation 2.3, nRS and nRP are the number of parameter regions in the saturation and 

pressure error maps, w
RS

 e w
RP

 are the saturation and the pressure parameter region 

weights, ?i is the error measured in each parameter region; 

 

? Critical Attributes Definition: because of the model simplicity the sensitivity analyses is not 

performed. The parameters to be adjusted are the absolute permeability and heterogeneities 

characteristics. 

 

After the parameterization phase, the search for a combination of attributes that minimizes 

the error measured can be done through optimization methods. In the present study, the local 

search algorithm is used; because the history matching is performed to a reservoir specific region 

and with few parameters. The method uses the algorithm developed by Leitão e Schiozer (1998) 

and Schiozer (1999) which is based on sequences of exploratory and linear search within a 

discretized solution space. 

2.4.2. Error Map 

The error map defines the parameter and the attribute regions. It also analyzes the reservoir 

model quality. The error map is generated from the water saturation differences between the 

reference model data and the history matched models data to each simulation grid cell, in 

accordance with

values are not considered in the definition of the parameter and attribute regions. 

2.4.3. Error Function 

The error curve over a production period is given by an error function, defined as the 

quantity that represents the mismatch between real data (reference model) and the simulated data 

(models studied). The error function used to evaluate the water saturation and pressure maps 

mismatch is defined as

2.5. Application 

The base reservoir simulation model and reference model were built by Risso (2007) and 

modified by Machado (2010). They consist of a five-spot configuration and are structurally 

represented by a horizontal top at -1000 m, discretized with a 45x45x1 grid in the x, y and z 

directions, respectively, with a dimension of 40 m in the three orthogonal directions, totaling 

2025 blocks.  

The reservoir permeability (k) and porosity (?) of the models are: 

• Base model: k = 500mD, ??= 20%; 

• Reference model: k = 200 mD, except the channel with high permeability (1000 mD) and 

the impermeable barriers, ? = 20%. 

 

The model permeability maps are shown in Figure 2.3.

The reservoir hydrocarbon fluid is light oil with a viscosity equal to 0.78 cP in the initial 

reservoir conditions (static pressure equal to 98 kgf/cm² and temperature equal to 50 °C). The 

initial solubility ratio is equal to 83 m³/m³ and there is no water-oil contact. The Black Oil fluid 

model is used. The production wells are constrained by the liquid rate and the injector well is 

constrained by the water rate.

Production data and water saturation maps from the history matched models considering 4 

years of historical data were compared. This is a production period in which production data 

itself indicates the existence of a high permeability channel, however the spatial distribution of 

heterogeneities is better defined with seismic data.

Figures 2.6 to 2.17 show the production results obtained for the base and history matched 

models. Predictions were obtained after history matching with and without 4D seismic data, to 

evaluate the impact of time lapse seismic information.

The base model simulation results showed higher values of oil production than the 

historical data values and a delay on the time for breakthrough at the production well PROD3 

(Figures 2.8 and 2.12). Also the reservoir pressure is higher than the historical data, these are

explained by the non-identification of a high permeability channel and barriers by the initial 

model (Figures 2.14 to 2.17). 

Water breakthrough was observed at production well PROD3 during the period considered. 

The information allowed a good water rate match at production well PROD3 for the history 

matched model using only production data. However, water rate forecast was not accurate for 

production wells PROD 2 and PROD 4. 

The integration of 4D seismic data with production data increased the accuracy in the 

production forecasts; especially in the prediction of time to breakthrough for the remaining 

production wells. The oil rate forecast also presented more accurate results. 

An important contribution of 4D seismic data is to better capture the fluid flow behavior 

during production. Such can be seen by evaluating the water saturation error curves presented in 

Figure 2.18 and the water saturation maps at different production periods from the history 

matched models presented in Figure 2.19.

The water saturation error increases up to a peak and then decreases over the production 

period, since at the beginning of production there is low fluid flow movement and at the end of 

production the reservoir is almost totally flooded (Figure 2.18).  

The water saturation error curve obtained from history matched model using only 

production data presented higher values than the curve obtained from the base model. Even 

though production data enabled the identification of the high permeability channel existence, its 

position and shape are more difficult to determine without spatial data. 

The water saturation error decreases significantly when 4D seismic data is used in the 

history matching process. Seismic data contributed to better characterize the spatial distribution 

of heterogeneities in the field and consequently the fluid flow movement (Figure 2.19).

Combined with reservoir modeling, time-lapse seismic monitoring enables reservoir 

engineers to improve reservoir characterization and to reduce uncertainty in production forecasts. 

The quantification of uncertainty reduction can be performed using the emulator technique.  

The emulator was applied to the same synthetic reservoir model in order to quantify the 

uncertainty reduction due to production data over different production periods. The description of 

the methodology used and results obtained were published in Ferreira et al. (2014a) and are 

presented in Appendix A.  

The emulator was not applied considering 4D seismic data because the main objective of 

the thesis is to quantify the chance of success based on the EVOI. If the emulator was used, the 

EMV (expected monetary value) would contain errors inherent to the emulator development. 

Even if small error values were obtained for the EMV with and without information, this would 

result in higher errors in the EVOI result. 

2.6.3. Case 2 

Case 2 evaluates the production results and water saturation errors from the history 

matched models with and without 4D seismic data. The time lapse data was acquired at 2, 4 and 6 

years of production. The assessment of the results obtained is divided according to the type of 

data considered: production data analysis and water saturation map analysis.  

Production Data Analysis 

Production well data were analyzed to evaluate the history data mismatch between history 

matched models and historical data and the prediction accuracy. The water rate of the history 

matched models using only production date are presented in Figures 2.20 to 2.23, while using 4D 

seismic data in Figures 2.24 to 2.27.  

The pressure results of the history matched models using only production date are 

presented in Figures 2.28 to 2.31, while using 4D seismic data in Figures 2.32 to 2.35.

Evaluating the prediction period, 4D seismic data improves water breakthrough prediction 

for the production wells PROD2 and PROD3 considering two years of historical data 

(Figures 2.25 and 2.26). The improvement in the production forecast is achieved for the history 

matched models using production data when breakthrough occurs; this occurs for production well

PROD3 with four years of historical data (Figure 2.22). At this moment, seismic value decreases 

because production data itself shows that the base model is inadequate. 

After four years of production, history matching can be started with the calibration of 

production well PROD3. However, as production data provides information at a specific 

reservoir location several alternatives could explain this early breakthrough, such as: high 

permeability channel, higher permeability of the reservoir near the production well and fractures. 

The quantity of data used in history matching increases with six years of production. The 

production behavior is more accurate for the history matched models using only production data, 

even though the barriers were not identified in the process. The increase in the amount of 

available information impacts on the value of 4D seismic data. Other source of data can be used 

to identify and characterize the uncertain reservoir heterogeneities. 

The prediction of the bottom-hole pressure is accurate for most of history matched models. 

The results obtained for the models history matched with two years of production were lower 

than the historical data. As the reservoir isn’t compartmentalized, pressure is not a critical issue. 

 

Dynamic Data Analysis 

Another value derived from the integration of 4DS with production data is the improvement 

on the simulation model quality, generating more accurate pressure and saturation information. 

The improvement on the dynamic data from the history matched models were evaluated by 

computing the water saturation and pressure error curves over the production period 

The water saturation error curves are presented in Figures 2.36 and 2.37 while the pressure 

error curves are shown in Figures 2.38 and 2.39.

Besides the history matched models with more than four years of only production data 

presented good prediction results, water saturation error is higher than obtained by the base 

model. This occurs because well data do not capture the fluid flow behavior during production, 

making it difficult to identify the correct position and shape of the high permeability channel. 

When 4D seismic data is used, water saturation error decreases significantly for the history 

matched model with two years of historical data. This shows the importance of using 4D seismic; 

it provides unique information regarding the properties of the reservoir between and beyond the

wells. Figures 2.38 and 39 show that the main quality improvement due to 4D seismic data is 

related to water saturation, since for both history match methods the pressure error decreased.  

The improvement on the simulation model quality can also be seen in Figure 2.40. It shows 

the difference of the water saturation maps between: (1) reference and base model, (2) reference 

and history matched model using only production data up two years and (3) reference and history 

matched model using production data and 4D seismic data acquired at two years.  

Errors lower than 20% of the highest values were dismissed. The errors obtained over the 

production period decrease significantly when 4D seismic data is used.

Acquisition Period Analysis 

Production and dynamic data analysis showed that 4D seismic improved production 

forecasts and captured the fluid flow behavior even for two years of historical data. The history 

matched models considering the acquisition at four and six years of production showed better 

results. However, history matched models using only production data with more than four years 

of historical data also improved the production forecast. 

The main value derived from the integration of 4D seismic with production data lies on the 

improvement of the simulation model quality. History matched models with 4D seismic data 

decreased the water saturation errors for all production periods analyzed. The understanding of 

the reservoir fluid flow movement assists the decision maker to improve the production strategy 

and increase the NPV as a consequence. 

The evaluation of the date for 4D seismic data acquisition must consider the economic 

impact of the new information in the reservoir management. The revenue percentage to be 

obtained from oil was calculated for the reference model to illustrate how 4D seismic value is 

related to the production strategy flexibility. The results obtained are presented Figure 2.41.

At four years of production there is approximately 50% of the revenue to be obtained with 

the remaining oil. Thus, the improvement of the production strategy at this moment can increase 

the NPV since there is a significant amount of remaining oil in the reservoir. 

However, at eight years of production changes in production strategy are limited, having 

only 20% of the revenue to be obtained. Thus, the utility of seismic data acquired at this period 

decreases significantly.  

The production period in which the acquisition of 4D seismic data has the highest impact 

was determined based on the production, dynamic and the simple economic analysis. The 

acquisition period is between 2 and 4 years of production to the case studied. In summary: 

? The history matched model using 4D seismic data acquired at two years of production 

presented an improvement on the prediction capability; 

? After four years of production an improvement on the prediction capability is also 

presented by the history matched model using only production data, because water 

breakthrough had occurred; 

? The history matched models using only production data for all historical periods analyzed 

decreased water saturation maps quality; 

? The history matched models using production data and 4D seismic data for all historical 

periods analyzed increased water saturation maps quality; 

? If the production strategy was flexible, it would be possible to implement operational 

changes related to water breakthrough prediction. Between two and four years of 

production there is a range of approximately 75% to 50% of remaining revenue. 

2.7. Conclusions 

The use of production data for history matching did not identify the barriers and some 

channel characteristics such as, angle and width. The history matching performed with four years 

of production data improved the production forecast. However, the prediction of the movement of 

fluid flow decreased significantly, because the water saturation errors increased at least 105%.  

The acquisition of 4D seismic data at 4 years of production improved the production 

forecast and reduced the water saturation errors at least 76%. However, at this production period 

the water breakthrough had occurred. The water breakthrough occurrence reduces the impact on 



43 
 

the reservoir management. Thus, it is an important factor that affects the value of 4D seismic 

data. 

The acquisition of 4D seismic data at an early production stage improves the reservoir 

model. The history matching using 4D seismic data acquired at two years of production provided 

better production forecast than using only production data, especially for the water rate at 

production wells PROD 2, 3 and 4.  

The water saturation errors decreased at least 38%. The reduction on the water saturation 

errors shows that the reservoir model better predicts the fluid flow behavior. However, it was not 

possible to identify the exact moment of water breakthrough at production well PROD 3.  

The period of highest impact for 4D seismic acquisition is between 2 and 4 years of 

production. It would be possible to predict the water breakthrough at production wells and 

consequently make decisions that would delay the breakthrough. Also, the revenue to be obtained 

from oil decreases significantly at later times. There would be only 20% of remaining revenue to 

be obtained after eight years of production. 

The water saturation error curve quantifies the quality of the dynamic data from a reservoir 

simulation model. It also provides important information about the possibility of remaining oil 

areas.

3. ESTIMATION OF THE BEST PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR 

4D SEISMIC DATA ACQUISITION  

3.1. Introduction 

Chapter 2 showed that the date for 4D seismic acquisition affects the value of 4D seismic 

data. If seismic data identifies changes in reservoir properties in the initial production phase, the 

project return increases through improvements in production strategy. On the other hand, if these 

changes are identified too late, the flexibility in decision making is reduced; consequently, few 

changes can be made in the production strategy.  

Also, the availability of other source of data reduces reservoir uncertainties and improves 

field development. Thus, the utility of 4D seismic is related to the period for 4D seismic data 

acquisition and, if done at the appropriate time, this tool has positive impacts on field 

management. 

The analysis of the improvement on the production data and dynamic data forecast, 

presented in Chapter 02, assumed that the true earth model was known. However, this is not what 

happens in practice.  

The estimation of the value of 4D seismic data shall be determined before its acquisition. 

Therefore, the best period for 4D seismic acquisition shall be identified without knowing the 

reference model. 

The estimation of the period for 4D seismic acquisition is a challenge task, because it is a 

problem of decision making under uncertainty. The acquisition of 4D seismic data in different 

production periods impacts the reservoir management in different manners.  

Thus, the present Chapter describes a methodology to estimate the best production period 

for 4D seismic acquisition. The evaluation process is simple and the methodology is divided in 

three steps: uncertainty analysis; production data analysis and water saturation error analysis.  

The proposed methodology is applied to a simple and synthetic reservoir model is order to 

exemplify the process. The results obtained are also shown in the present Chapter. The 

methodology will be incorporated in the chance of success methodology that is presented in 

Chapter 4.  



46 
 

3.2. Objective 

The objective is to describe the methodology that estimates the best production period for 

4D seismic data acquisition considering the reservoir uncertainties and to present its application 

to a simple synthetic reservoir model. 

3.3. Assumptions  

The following assumptions are adopted: 

? The model used is synthetic and simple. It represents a specific part of the field in order to 

make the analysis simpler;  

? The reservoir model uncertainties are properly quantified; 

? Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic without noise. 

3.4. Proposed Methodology 

The proposed methodology comprises four stages; as described in the following sections. 

3.4.1. Uncertainty Analysis 

The base deterministic reservoir model is a simulation model constructed with the most 

probable values of all input values. The base model is analyzed in order to define the reservoir 

uncertainties. Depending on the amount of uncertainties, a sensitivity analysis can be performed 

to identify the most critical attributes to be considered in the process.  

The critical attributes must be combined through a statistical technique, among the existing 

ones: derivation tree, Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube. Depending on the number of uncertain 

attributes the use of derivation tree leads to a high number of scenarios. Monte Carlo is a tradition 

technique to sample randomly within the range of the input distribution. However, a high number 

of iterations are needed to sample enough quantities to accurately represent the input distribution. 

Latin Hypercube sampling is designed to accurately recreate the input distribution through 

sampling in less iteration when compared to Monte Carlo method. The key is stratification of the 

input probability distributions.  



47 
 

Stratification divides the cumulative probability curve into equal intervals. A sample is 

randomly taken from each interval of the input distribution. The technique being used during 

Latin Hypercube sampling is “sampling without replacement”. The number of stratifications of 

the cumulative distribution is equal to the number of iterations performed (University of Oslo, 

2005). 

As more efficient sampling method, Latin Hypercube is used in the methodology to 

estimate the best time for 4D seismic acquisition. The scenarios generated are then simulated 

using commercial simulation software to obtain the production outputs.  

3.4.2. Production Data Analysis 

Chapter 2 showed that production data itself can reduce the reservoir uncertainties and 

improve the production forecast. Time for breakthrough has indicated to be an important 

parameter. It increases the production data capability to identify the reservoir heterogeneities and 

to improve the knowledge of the geological framework.  

The acquisition of 4D seismic data before water breakthrough occurs improves the 

production well operational parameters. Decisions can be made in order to delay the 

breakthrough and increase the oil production rate as a consequence.  

4D seismic data gives information about the evolution in space and time of the fluid 

distributions inside the reservoir. Thus, the value of 4D seismic data increases when its 

acquisition is made at a moment in which production data does not provide a good 

characterization of the reservoir. 

Therefore, water rate of each production well for all scenarios must be evaluated. The 

probability of water breakthrough occurrence at different production periods shall be determined. 

The acquisition period is determined based on these probabilities, depending on the decision 

maker risk aversion. 

3.4.3. Dynamic Data Analysis 

The best time for 4D seismic acquisition is the one that only 4D seismic data is able to 

identify that the base model does not represent the true earth model and there is enough time to 

make decision changes in field operations.  



48 
 

The calculation of the water saturation error between each scenario and the base model is 

necessary to estimate the best period for 4D seismic acquisition. The water saturation error curve 

over a production period is given by an error function.  

The error function is defined as the quantity that represents the mismatch between the 

reservoir simulation scenario and the base model water saturation maps; each scenario is 

considered as a true earth model. The error function used is defined as  

? ??

where Ng is the number of grid cells, X is the property analyzed (water saturation); Xi

 are the base and scenario model data, and ? is the error. 

The water saturation error graph shows, for each possible scenario, if there is significant 

information about the reservoir fluid flow to identify that the model considered (base model) is 

different from the true earth model.  

The information is considered perfect, thus the acquisition of information identifies the true 

earth model represented by each scenario. It is known that in practice history matching would be 

performed and the resulting reservoir model would be closer to the true earth model.  

The normalized water saturation error graph is used to identify the moment in which the 

water saturation is highest and assists the estimation of the acquisition period. This period shall 

be between the moment in which there is enough water saturation error and enough time to 

implement actions that improve the reservoir management. 

3.4.4. Acquisition Period Estimation 

The results obtained in production and dynamic analyses are evaluated. An upper limit for 

4D seismic acquisition is the one that the probability of water breakthrough occurs at any 



49 
 

production wells is high. The definition of the probability value depends on the decision maker 

risk aversion. The lower limit is the one that there is enough water saturation error between the 

base model and the true earth model to identify that the base model is incorrect. 

3.5. Application 

The methodology to estimate the best time for 4D seismic acquisition is applied to a 

synthetic model. The reservoir model description and the reservoir uncertainties are presented in 

the next sections.

3.6.2. Production Data Analysis 

The date for 4D seismic acquisition is limited to the time for water breakthrough for non-

mature reservoirs. The date for water breakthrough at each production well for each scenario was 

determined. The water rate for each production well is presented in Figures 3.8 to 3.11. 

It can be seen that time for BT is highly variable. The probability of water breakthrough at 

different production periods was determined. Water breakthrough is one of the parameters 

analyzed to estimate the acquisition period and the estimation is based on BT probabilities, 

depending on the decision maker risk aversion.  

The probabilities were computed by quantifying the number of scenarios in which the BT 

occurred in any production well at a specific production period. The values obtained are:  

? Before four years of production: 1 scenario, 0.5% of probability; 

? Before six years of production: 11 scenarios, 5.5% of probability. 

? Before eight years of production: 94 scenarios, 47% of probability. 

 

The reduction of the uncertainty of the breakthrough prediction is one of 4DS utility in non-

mature fields. Decisions can be made in order to delay the breakthrough and increase the oil 

production rate as a consequence.  



54 
 

In the case studied, the production strategy is not flexible and only well operational changes 

can be made to increase field profitability. Assuming that 47% of BT probability is a high level 

of risk, eight years of production would be the limiting to acquire seismic data.

3.6.3. Dynamic Data Analysis 

The water saturation error curve was obtained by comparing the water saturation map from 

the base model and the water saturation map from each scenario; these curves are presented in 

Figure 3.12.  

The graph shows, for each possible scenario, if there is significant water saturation error to 

identify that the base model is different from the true earth model. It can be seen that there are 

scenarios with fluid distributions highly different from the base model and scenarios that are 

geologically similar resulting in low error values. 

The water saturation curves were normalized to identify the appropriate acquisition period. 

The normalized curve identifies the moment in which the water saturation error is highest and are 

presented in Figure 3.13. 

It was considered that 70% of the highest error value would be enough for the true earth 

model identification. Figure 3.14 shows a histogram of production time in which normalized 

water saturation error is equal 70%. It can be seen that the highest number of scenarios occurs at 

five years of production.

58 
 

3.6.4. Acquisition Period Estimation 

The period for the first 4D seismic data acquisition is between five and eight years of 

production, based on the production and the dynamic data analysis. The period was determined 

considering a non-mature reservoir without production strategy flexibility.  

The inferior limit, five years, is the minimum time at which variations in the reservoir 

dynamic properties occurred. The superior limit, eight years, indicates the time at which there is a 

high probability of breakthrough. The production period obtained is different from the one 

presented in Chapter 2. Such can be justified by the neglected barriers in the scenarios. 

3.7. Conclusions 

The proposed methodology to estimate the best time for 4D seismic data acquisition 

incorporates common routines used in the industry, such as uncertainty analysis, and it adds a 

new procedure through the dynamic data analysis. 

Two are the main factors that define the acquisition period: the water breakthrough and the 

water saturation error. The acquisition of 4D seismic data shall be before water breakthrough. 

The identification of the water flow path improves the well operational parameters and 

consequently increases the project economic return.  

The appropriate acquisition period is also limited to the time at which 4D seismic data 

identifies that the base model does not represent the true earth model. The time is defined by 

considering that 70% of the maximum normalized water saturation error is sufficient to identify 

the true earth model. 

The acquisition period obtained for the synthetic reservoir model is between five and eight 

years of production. Such period is different from the one presented in Chapter 2 because the 

barriers were neglected. At five years, the normalized water saturation error is equal 70% for 

most of the scenarios and at eight years there is 47% of probability of water breakthrough.

4. METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE THE CHANCE OF 

SUCCESS OF A 4D SEISMIC PROJECT  

4.1. Introduction 

A 4D seismic project is considered successful from the reservoir engineering perspective 

when 4D seismic data mitigates the risk and/or increases the economic value of the project. 

Measuring and, especially, predicting the economic impact of new information is complex; 

within such setting the value of information (VOI) concept rises as an important decision-making 

tool.  

It is simpler to quantify 4D seismic data value after the data acquisition. A deterministic 

value is calculated by quantifying the impact that the new information had in the field 

management. Even though the quantification is simpler, it is difficult to define the decisions that 

would have been taken if no information had been acquired.  

In contrast, the quantification of the EVOI before the data acquisition is more complex and 

must consider the reservoir model uncertainties and the uncertainty in future information (Dunn, 

1992; Gerhardt and Haldorsen, 1989).  

Currently the concept of EVOI is widespread over the oil and gas literature. The EVOI 

must take into account the potential benefits. Waggoner (2002) listed and discussed some of the 

most beneficial and common impacts of 4D seismic acquisition in reservoir management: 

? Avoid poor well placement: 4D results can prevent poor well placement by assessing the 

state of the reservoir at a planned well location. The value of the 4D information saves the 

cost of an unnecessary well; 

? Optimize placement of new wells: when 4D results are used to plan a new well location, it 

is possible to optimize the placement of that well; 

? Locate undrained reservoir compartments: when 4D data indicates no reservoir change in 

areas expected to be in production, it is likely that those areas of the reservoir are isolated 

compartments. By locating the compartment, 4D data quantifies the lost reserves and allow 

placement of a well to access it. 



60 
 

? Identify drained areas/fluid fronts: it is possible to anticipate early breakthrough, potentially 

in time to adjust field production rates to prevent breakthrough from occurring. 4D seismic 

information is also important for locating new wells away from fluid fronts to extend the 

plateau and accelerate production; 

? Reduce uncertainty in reservoir models: reservoir models always contain a degree of 

uncertainty, but 4D results can reduce that. With less uncertainty, there is less risk in many 

reservoir development and production decisions, which could result in accepting rather than 

rejecting an economically viable project. 

 

Decision trees, developed as a concept in the 1960’s, have gradually become the most 

widely accepted tool in the petroleum industry to assess the value of information (Ballin et al., 

2005). Decision tree models have been used to quantify the economic impact of seismic imaging 

on reservoir management (Waggoner, 2002) and the key to their successful use is to frame the 

problem, understand key sensitivities and keep it simple. 

A widely used method to determine the VOI calculates the difference between expected 

monetary value with and without information for possible scenarios through a decision tree. The 

main differences observed in the literature lies on how the impact of information acquisition is 

considered in the decision tree, the integration of uncertainty in the process and the estimation of 

reliability of information. 

Waggoner (2002) considered the impact of 4D seismic data acquisition in two different 

ways: 4D information can (1) increase the net present value and (2) increase the chance of 

success. The increase on the net present value is included in the decision tree by using a larger 

value of oil production in the branch considering the information gathering.  

Ballin et al. (2005) evaluated the impact of 4D seismic data in the compartmentalization 

risk, the decision is related to drill/recomplete a well or not. The main value comes from 

changing the probability of the well’s economic failure. The uncertainty is included in the process 

by combining regional database with reserve uncertainty to estimate the risk of well failure.  

Coopersmith and Cunningham (2002) and Bratvold et al. (2009) include the concept of 

imperfect information by incorporating the Bayes’ theorem in the analysis. Pinto et al (2011) also 

presented a method to quantify the monetary value of imperfect information provided by time-

lapse seismic data acquisition. The proposed method is a simple application of real option 



61 
 

analysis in which the value of perfect information is obtained and then the value of imperfect 

information is determined using a transfer factor.  

The method presented by Pinto et al. (2011) generates a group of possible scenarios along 

with all possible production strategies for the reservoir. The scenarios generation considered only 

three variables: production, cost and oil price. The expected value without information is 

determined by weighting the net present value obtained from the scenarios using the base 

production strategy.  

4D seismic data identifies the state of nature, therefore a specific production strategy is 

considered. The expected value with information is determined by weighting the net present 

value obtained from the scenarios using the specific production strategy. The value of perfect 

information is the difference between the expected values with and without information. 

A transfer factor is used to compute the value of imperfect information. It represents a 

learning measure and indicates how effective the information is in reducing the uncertainty in the 

decision making process. The transfer factor is determined through a regression model derived 

from the technical scoring criteria introduced by Lumley et al. (1997). 

The EVOI assessment of 4D seismic data is complex and requires several simplifications to 

make the process viable. However, it should consider the four aspects mentioned in Chapter 1: 

 

? Date of acquisition: Chapter 2 discussed the impact that the date of 4D seismic acquisition 

has on the value of 4D seismic data. In summary, the acquisition cannot be too early 

because seismic data may not identify variations in the reservoir dynamic properties, or too 

late because major changes may no longer be detected and the flexibility in decision 

making is reduced; i.e., few changes can be made in the production strategy; 

? Impact on field management: for a 4D seismic project to be considered an economic 

success, the provided information should impact field operations and should generate more 

monetary benefit than its acquisition cost; 

? Reservoir uncertainties: the reservoir model used to assist the decision making process is 

developed under several physical uncertainties. Thus, the VOI should be assessed under 

uncertainty. The term Expected Value of Information (EVOI) should be used in this 

context; 



62 
 

? Other source of data: there are several potential sources of information that can improve the 

decision making process and can reduce the reservoir uncertainty. 

 

A methodology to determine the EVOI that considers all aspects mentioned above is 

needed. The present chapter describes a methodology that estimates the EVOI considering the 

“date of acquisition” aspect. The methodology also incorporates a probabilistic approach in the 

estimation of the chance of success.  

The chance of success methodology is applicable to projects in the development phase. The 

evaluation is performed considering the best production period to acquire 4D seismic data. If the 

result obtained does not indicate that 4D seismic data would improve the economic return of the 

project, the use of continuous acquisition also would not be viable. 

4.2. Objective 

The objective of the present Chapter is to describe the methodology that estimates the 

chance of success of a 4D seismic project before having 4D seismic data. The methodology uses 

the concept of EVOI and incorporates the methodology described in Chapter 2. Moreover, 

present its application to a synthetic reservoir model in order to test the methodology in a case 

with known answer. 

4.3. Assumptions 

The following assumptions are made: 

? Pressure and saturation data are successfully obtained from 4D seismic data; 

? 4D seismic data is considered as perfect information; 

? All reservoir model uncertainties are identified and quantified. 

4.4. Theoretical Concepts 

The process comprises several methodologies used in reservoir engineering which are 

described in the next sections. 



63 
 

4.4.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis 

Uncertainty is related to the lack of knowledge about reservoir properties, economics or 

technology. The uncertain attributes affect the decision-making during reservoir management. 

The uncertainty and risk analysis involve: identifying the reservoir uncertain attributes, 

generating scenarios through statistical combination, running the numerical simulation and 

determining the risk curve. 

A team of geologists, geophysicists and engineers is responsible for the definition of the 

uncertain attributes. The uncertainty concerning the attributes value can be expressed in terms of 

probabilistic distributions; and each attribute can be discretized into uncertainty levels according 

to its probability density function (pdf). Usually three uncertainty levels are considered for each 

attribute: probable, optimistic and pessimistic (Steagall, 2001). 

Depending on the quantity of uncertain attributes; it is necessary to perform a sensibility 

analysis, because not all uncertain attributes generate risk to a project (Becerra, 2011). Thus, the 

quantity of uncertain attributes can be reduced as soon as an uncertainty generates low or none 

variation in the reservoir simulation outputs.  

The model is evaluated at lower and upper bounds of each uncertainty in turns. The results 

are traditionally displayed in a tornado plot, also known as Pareto. This type of plot helps the 

identification of the variables that have the most impact. 

The critical attributes must be combined to generate scenarios that represent the reservoir 

uncertainty. Statistical techniques such as, derivation tree, Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube are 

used. Among these techniques, the results obtained using the Latin Hypercube are more accurate 

(Risso et al., 2011). 

The Latin Hypercube Technique is characterized by the division of the uncertainties range 

into sub-regions, and the sample is realized in each region. The trials number in each region is 

defined proportionally to the probability of the specific region and each model probability of 

occurrence is defined by 1/N, where N is the total number of trials. 

The risk curve that quantifies the project risk is obtained from the simulation results of the 

generated scenarios. The curve relates the objective function of each model to a cumulative 

probability of occurrence. An example of objective function is the net present value (NPV). 



64 
 

4.4.2. Representative Models 

It is inefficient to estimate the 4D seismic chance of success considering all scenarios in the 

process. The number of scenarios generated in the uncertainty and risk analysis is high. Thus, 

representative models (RM) (that represent the reservoir uncertainties behavior) become 

necessary to guarantee a reliable analysis,  

According to Ligero et al. (2005), the selection of representative models consists of 

choosing, among the simulated reservoir scenarios, the ones that better represent the variability of 

the attributes and the variability of the objective function. For this, cross plots of the objective 

function (NPV in the current study) and simulated production results (BHP and oil rate, for 

example) are obtained.  

Reservoir models are chosen close to the scenarios considered as P10, P50 and P90. The 

percentile P90 means that there is a 90% probability of obtaining higher values than those 

associated with the index P90. The number of representative models depends on: (1) reliability 

needed, (2) objective of the analysis needed, and (3) variability of the objective function and the 

uncertain attributes. 

4.4.3. Water Saturation Error Analysis 

The concept of water saturation error and its use to evaluate the quality of a reservoir model 

considered as base model is presented in the section 3.4.3 in Chapter 3. The saturation error curve 

over a production period is used to identify if scenarios present a reservoir fluid flow movement 

different from that expected. If the water saturation error is low, the impact of 4D seismic 

information on the identification of the true earth model decreases.  

4.4.4. Economic Analysis.  

A parameter used in the economic evaluation of oil and gas projects is the Net Present 

Value (NPV). NPV is the discounted value of investment cash inflows minus the discounted 

value of its cash outflows. An investment should have a net present value greater than zero to be 

adequately profitable. The NPV is expressed as 



65 
 

     ?
   

(   )  
 
   ,                                                                                                                                            (4.1) 

where, CF is the cash flow, i is the production period interval, t is the time related to the interval 

considered, r is the discount rate and N is the number of intervals considered. 

Another important economic concept is the Expected Monetary Value (EMV). It is defined 

as the total of the outcomes multiplied by the corresponding probability of occurrence associated 

with a decision. The EMV is determined by 

    ?        
 
   ,                                                                                                                                         (4.2) 

where, N is the number of possible scenarios, j represent a specific scenario and P is the 

probability of occurrence. 

4.4.5. Value of Information 

The estimation of the expected value of information (EVOI) is an important tool used in the 

decision making process. The risk level can be high in the field development phase, depending on 

the reservoir uncertainties. The acquisition of new information can increase the project’s 

economic return due to the reduction of uncertainty and to the impact on reservoir management.  

Bratvold et al. (2009) commented that the fundamental question for any information 

gathering process is whether the likely improvement in decision-making is worth the cost of the 

information. The EVOI technique is designed to answer this question. 

The methodology used to estimate the EVOI is based on Ligero et al. (2005), which 

integrates the decision tree analysis, risk analysis, uncertainty probabilistic approach and the 

production strategy optimization into the process. As the EVOI methodology is assessed under 

uncertainty and uses a probabilistic approach, the term Expected Value of Information (EVOI) is 

used. If the decision maker is risk neutral, EVOI is obtained by  

EVOI=EMVwith information - EMVwithout information .                                                                                 (4.3) 

The change of the EMV is linked to the impact on the field management due to the 

acquisition of new information. Moreover, if the decision maker makes the same decision no 



66 
 

matter how the test results, then EVOI is equal to zero and the acquisition of new information is 

worthless. 

The EMVwithout information is determined by applying a fixed production strategy, which 

maximizes the EMV, to all representative models. It is assumed that the base model production 

strategy maximizes the expected monetary value (EMV). It is represented by 

                       ? (                           )
   
   ,                                                              (4.4) 

where, P is the probability of the representative model, NRM is the number of representative 

models. 

The EMVwith information is determined by applying a specific production strategy developed 

for each representative model. It is represented by 

                    ? (               )
   
     ,                                                                                   (4.5) 

where, s is the specific production strategy for each representative model. 

Even when the economic parameter EVOI does not indicate that the acquisition of new 

information can improve the project economic return, the impact on the project risk should be 

evaluated. 

According to Marques et al. (2013), the concept of risk varies depending on the decision 

makers’ profile and objective of the study. The standard deviation normalized by the EMV is 

used to quantify the risk; however this concept was not applied in the thesis. 

4.5. Proposed Methodology 

The proposed methodology follows the process described in Figure 4.1. The process 

comprises six stages in which two of them (highlighted in red) are the main contributions of the 

thesis.  

 



67 
 

 

Figure 4.1. Methodology to estimate the 4D seismic chance of success. 

4.5.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis 

This first stage defines the reservoir model uncertainty parameters. Using a statistical 

procedure to combine these uncertainties, all possible scenarios are generated and the base model 

is chosen (usually the scenario with a probability of occurrence of 50%). 

The production strategy is optimized considering only the base model to determine the base 

production strategy. With an economic analysis the NPV of each scenario is determined 

considering the base production strategy.  

The range of NPV obtained indicates the projects risk level. The decision maker risk profile 

defines if the NPV range represents high risk or not. If the project is considered high risk, the 

acquisition of 4D seismic data would reduce the risk and improve reservoir management, so the 



68 
 

estimation process proceeds. For low risk, the decision maker can decide to not acquire 4D 

seismic data. 

4.5.2. Representative Models Definition 

The many possible scenarios make the selection of representative models necessary. The 

chance of success estimation includes the evaluation of the impact on the reservoir management 

through the strategy optimization. Thus, it would be time consuming to analyze all possible 

scenarios.  

The selection of the representative models is done by plotting the main objective function 

(e.g. NPV) against the secondary objective function (e.g. RF, Np) and choosing scenarios that 

represent both values variation. The minimum number of representative models must be the one 

in which there is no significant variation on the EVOI result (Schiozer et al., 2004; Costa &amp;amp; 

Schiozer, 2008). 

4.5.3. Acquisition Period Estimation (Engineering Perspective) 

The utility of 4D seismic data varies depending on the date of 4D seismic data acquisition. 

The importance of estimating the best time to acquire 4D seismic data was described in Chapter 2 

and the methodology to determine the acquisition period was presented in Chapter 3.  

The chance of success methodology provides a first estimative of the economic benefits 

due to 4D seismic data, thus the evaluation is performed considering the best period for 4D 

seismic data acquisition. The period is such that there is significant variation in the dynamic 

properties and there is enough time to impact on the reservoir management. 

The information that comes from 4D seismic data is evaluated in terms of water saturation 

map. A production period is considered the best for 4D seismic data acquisition when it is 

possible to identify that the base reservoir model does not represent the true earth model and 

enables to anticipate the breakthrough at production wells.  

The best production period estimation is done at the development phase and it is assumed 

that the period is suitable from the geophysical perspective. 



69 
 

4.5.4. Strategy Optimization 

The production strategy of each representative model is optimized from the moment of data 

acquisition and processing to quantify the economic impact of the acquired 4D seismic data. The 

information is considered perfect, thus 4D seismic data identifies the true earth model represented 

by the representative models.  

The objective of the optimization process is to improve the production strategy and increase 

the objective function until a predefined criterion is obtained. Net Present Value (NPV) is the 

objective function considered in this study. 

4.5.5. Chance of Success (COS) Analysis 

The net present values of each representative model obtained applying the base production 

strategy and the specific production strategy are compared. The increment on the NPV is the 

economic benefit due the information acquisition.  

In general the impact on the reservoir management is measured by quantifying the expected 

value of information (EVOI). However, the EVOI is a mean value and does not show the 

variability of the economic impact on the project.  

Thus, the chance of success methodology introduces a new way to analyze the increase on 

the economic value of the project due to new data. The production strategy optimization of each 

representative model provides the increase of the NPV and its probability of occurrence, a 

probability density curve is then calculated. It shows the variability of the economic impact and 

the probability that the increase on the NPV is higher than the cost of data acquisition and 

processing.  

4.5.6. Decision Maker Evaluation 

Based on the data provided in the chance of success analysis stage, the decision maker may 

take the following actions: 

? End the process: the decision maker decides to acquire or to not acquire 4D seismic data; 

? Continue the analysis: the decision maker decides to continue the process. Three are the 

possibilities: (1) to improve the evaluation accuracy by selecting more representative 



70 
 

models, (2) to evaluate a different acquisition period or (3) to improve the strategy 

optimization procedure. 

4.6. Application 

The chance of success methodology was applied to a synthetic model. The reservoir model 

description and uncertainties are presented in the next sections. 

4.6.1. Reservoir Model Description 

The reservoir model was generated with information from three exploratory wells 

according to a prior geological and structural interpretation. The reservoir model presents two 

facies: Facie 1 corresponds to a sandstone type rock and Facie 2 corresponds to a shaly sandstone 

type. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 show the reservoir model properties and PVT table, respectively. 

Figure 4.2 shows the relative permeability curves for the oil and water phases for both facies and 

Figure 4.3 presents the porosity, permeability, NTG and facies for the third layer.

The reservoir production strategy was defined by optimizing the base model. The reservoir 

model was simulated in a black oil commercial simulator (IMEX 2010) for 30 years of 

production with a start date at 01/01/2008. The production strategy consists of fourteen 

production wells and ten water injector wells. Figure 4.4 shows the base production strategy. 

Production wells were completed in layers one to four and the injector wells were 

completed in layers five to nine. The well and group production constrains are presented in

4.6.2. Reservoir Model Uncertainties 

The reservoir model uncertainties definition and quantification is done in the developing 

phase, so there are many associated uncertainties. The uncertain attributes of the reservoir model 

under analysis were divided into two groups: discrete attributes and map attributes. 

The discrete uncertain attributes were divided into six levels and are presented in Table 4.4; 

while the maps attributes are: (1) permeability map; (2) porosity map; (3) NTG map and (4) 

facies distribution. Five hundred maps of each map type (1, 2, 3 and 4) were generated using the 

Petrel Software.

4.7. Results 

The results obtained for each methodology stage applied to the synthetic reservoir model 

are presented in the next sections. 

4.7.1. Uncertainty and Risk Analysis 

Due to the many uncertainty attribute levels, the Latin Hypercube was used to generate 500 

scenarios. All attributes have a uniform distribution. The field production results from all 

scenarios and from the base model are presented in Figures 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7. The base model is 

one combination of all uncertainties.

The NPV was calculated using the UNIPAR-MEC software and the base model production 

strategy was applied to each scenario. The price context and the costs are presented in Table 4.5. 

Although the production costs vary with oil prices, this was not considered to keep it simple. The 



76 
 

risk curve obtained is shown in Figure 4.8 along with the values of NPV for the representative 

models. 

At the end of the uncertainty and risk analysis stage, the decision maker decides whether to 

continue or to end the process based on the risk curve. The risk level indicates if the acquisition 

of new information is necessary to reduce the reservoir uncertainties.  

In the case studied, the NPV has a variation of approximately US$ 3 billion. The NPV 

variation was considered a high value confirming the need for more information. Thus, the 

process to estimate the chance of success continues.

4.7.2. Representative Models Selection 

In the case studied the acquisition of 4D seismic data shows which of the possible scenarios 

represents the true earth model. The chance of success is related to the impact on the reservoir 

management after the acquisition of the information. 

As it would be time-consuming to estimate the impact of 4DS acquisition for all possible 

scenarios for a specific production period, it is necessary to select simulation models that 

represent the reservoir uncertainties variation. 

The representative models were chosen based on production data (RF, Np and Wp) versus 

economic data (NPV) cross plots. The selection of the representative models can be done several 

times, with the objective to improve the EVOI accuracy (Figure 4.1). Each loop is called a stage, 

the number of stages is such that the difference between the EVOI calculated from consecutive 

stages is less than 5%.  

In the current study, the representative models selection was done in four stages. The 

production and economic results of all representative models are presented in Table 4.6.

where PRMr is the probability of the representative model r, NSCNr is the number of scenarios that 

has the lowest “distance” value (d) with respect to the representative model RMr and TSCN is the 

total number of scenarios. 

“Distance” is a comparison between the production and economic results from each 

scenario to each representative model. The distance is calculated by

representative model (RMr) under analysis. 

A schematic example is presented in Table 4.7. The total number of representative models 

is equal to three and the total number of scenarios (TSCN) is equal to ten.

The probability of each representative model is calculated using Equation 4.6: 

? Representative model RM1: PRM1 = (NSCN1 /TSCN) = 0.3; 

? Representative model RM2: PRM2 = (NSCN2 /TSCN) = 0.4; 

? Representative model RM3: PRM3 = (NSCN3 /TSCN) = 0.3; 

4.7.2.1 Stage 1 

Three reservoir models were selected: base model, pessimistic model and optimistic model. 

The pessimistic and optimistic models were selected based on the NPV of all scenarios. The main 

objective was to verify if the increase on the NPV values, due to information acquisition, for the 

extreme models would be the maximum that could be obtained.  

The pessimistic and optimistic models are called RM2 and RM5, respectively. The 

production and economic results are presented in Table 4.6, the probability of each representative 

model is shown in Table 4.8 and the cross plots are presented in Figures 4.9 to 4.12.

Stage 4 is the last stage, because the difference in EVOI obtained in Stage 04 and Stage 03 

is less than 5%. The representative models selected were: base model, RM1, RM2, RM3, RM4, 

RM5, RM6, RM7, RM8, RM9, RM10 and RM11. The probability of each representative model 

is shown in Table 4.11 and the cross plots are presented in Figures 4.20 to 4.23.

4.7.3. Acquisition Period Estimation 

The ability of seismic data to identify heterogeneities and to improve reservoir modeling 

varies over the production period. The relationship between the reservoir fluid flow and 4D 

seismic data capacity to improve the reservoir model was described in Chapter 2. A first 

estimative of the best time for 4D seismic acquisition was obtained applying the methodology 

described in Chapter 3. 

4.7.3.1. Dynamic Data Analysis 

The water saturation error was obtained by comparing the water saturation map from each 

scenario with the water saturation map from the base model. The comparison is made with the 

base model because the production strategy applied to each scenario is the same as the base 

model production strategy. 

The water saturation curves and the normalized curves were computed using Equation 3.1 

and 3.2. The graphs obtained are shown in Figures 4.24 and 4.25. The black curves are the 

representative models considered in Stage 04. 

 

 

Figure 4.24. Water saturation error. 



90 
 

 

Figure 4.25. Normalized water saturation error. 

 

Figure 4.24 shows if there will be a significant difference between the fluid flow to identify 

whether the model considered (base model) is incorrect (that is, different from the true earth 

model).  

In practice a history matching process would be performed and the resulting reservoir 

model would be closer to the true earth model. In this work, as the information is considered 

perfect, the acquisition of information allows to identify the true earth model represented by each 

scenario.  

There are scenarios in which reservoir characteristics are similar to the base model resulting 

in low errors and, on the other hand, scenarios highly different from the base model resulting in 

high errors. 

Figure 4.24 also shows that in the initial production phase the errors values are not 

significant. This occurs due to the low fluid flow and indicates the absence of significant 

uncertainties, such as a secondary reservoir.  

However, at the end of production there are high values of water saturation errors. The high 

value indicates the existence of remaining oil areas. The identification of remaining oil areas is 

more difficult to be obtained with other sources of data than 4D seismic data. 



91 
 

In Figure 4.25, the normalized water saturation error identifies when the difference between 

the base model and each scenario is highest (normalized error equal to one). A first estimative of 

the period to acquire 4D seismic data would be at 70% of the normalized water saturation error.  

Figure 4.26 shows the histogram of normalized errors at five years of production. The error 

is between 60 and 95%, indicating that the water saturation difference between the scenarios and 

the base model may be enough to identify that the base model does not represent the true earth 

model.

4.7.3.2. Production Data Analysis 

The second factor to be analyzed is the time for breakthrough. Figure 4.27 shows a 

histogram of breakthrough time. The production wells of all scenarios were considered.  

Figure 4.28 shows the cumulative distribution of BT: with five years of production, the 

breakthrough had occurred to approximately 55% of the production wells.

4.7.3.3. Acquisition Period Estimation 

A first estimate of the acquisition period is before five years of production. The acquisition 

period was estimated based on: (1) the fluid flow differences between the base model and the 

reservoir scenarios and (2) the time for breakthrough. 

Within this period, the benefits provided by the acquisition of new information depend on 

the production strategy optimization. The chance of success of 4D seismic data was estimated for 

five years of production. Such period indicates some potential to mitigate the development risk.  

4.7.4. Production Strategy Optimization 

The acquisition of new information at the production period defined in the previous step 

impacts the production strategy. The identification of the true earth model represented by each 

scenario improves the reservoir management from the moment that information is obtained. 

The time to process 4D seismic data was not considered because the case analyzed is 

synthetic. Thus, the optimization was performed after five years of production.  

The objective function was the NPV and the costs considered in the analysis are presented 

in Table 4.5. The optimization considered the following actions: 

 

? Drilling of a new well (addition or replacement): consists of stopping production or 

injection wells and drilling a new well to replace it. The drilling of one new well was 

considered due to the high number of production and injection wells; 

? Production or injection wells recompletion: shutting off one or more production or injection 

periods; 

? Production constraints changing: variations on the water cut and maximum surface oil rate 

values in order to improve the production efficiency. 

 

Appendix C presents the description of the production strategy improvement for the 

representative models RM1 and RM2. It describes the well control constrains, the objective 

functions that were evaluated and the results obtained for each action. The same procedure was 

used to optimize the production strategy from RM3 to RM11. 



94 
 

Figures 4.29 to 4.39 show the final production strategy with the position of the new well 

drilled after five years of production for all representative models.  

Table 4.12 shows the water cut considered in the optimized production strategy for the 

representative models RM1 and RM5 and maximum surface oil rate considered for RM1.  

The water cut considered in the production strategy for the representative models RM2 to 

RM4 and RM6 to RM11 is equal 0.95. The maximum surface oil rate was not included in the 

production strategy of the representative models RM2 to RM11. 

Table 4.13 presents the economic and production results obtained with the optimized 

production strategy. The index ?NPV represents the difference between the NPV using the base 

production strategy and the NPV using the specific production strategy for each model. 

The ?NPV from the base model is equal to zero; in such case if the information identifies 

that the base model represents the true earth model the same production strategy would be used in 

the reservoir management. The results obtained for the remaining representative models vary 

considerably.

An important issue that commonly occurs in practice is that when defining the optimal 

production strategy for a representative model, the optimized production strategy also improves 

the base model economic return. This issue shows that the base production strategy was not the 

optimal and the process to estimate the chance of success must be restarted.

The reservoir scenarios must be generated again considering the optimal base production 

strategy and consequently the following methodology steps. The process of regenerating the 

reservoir scenarios considering a new base model production strategy occurred in the current 

study.  

However, sections 4.6.1 and 4.6 showed the results obtained considering the optimal base 

production strategy. The initial base model production strategy description and production data 

results from the corresponding scenarios are presented in Appendix B. 

4.7.5. Chance of Success  

The expected value of information and the cumulative probability of the increase on the 

economic return were determined to estimate the chance of success.  

4.7.5.1. Expected Value of Information 

A decision tree was used to represent the decision process of whether or not acquire 4D 

seismic data to estimate the EVOI.  

In the decision tree, the branch called “Do not acquire 4DS” represents all possible 

outcomes if no information is acquired. In such case, it is assumed that the base model production 

strategy maximizes the expected monetary value (EMV).  

Thus, the production strategy applied to obtain all possible outcomes considers the 

production strategy of the base model, as shown in Equation 4.4. If the true earth model is not 

represented by the base model, but instead, by any of the representative models, the opportunity 

of improving the production strategy is lost.  

The branch called “Acquire 4DS” represents a decision node. In such case, the decision 

maker chooses after the information gathering which strategy to use in the reservoir management.  

The possible outcomes were determined by applying the production strategy specifically 

designed for each possible scenario as shown in Equation 4.5. The improvement in the 

production strategy indicates the impact of new information on reservoir management. 

The decision tree for the four stages of representative models selection are presented in 

Figures 4.40 to 4.43. The EVOI obtained for Stage 1 is much lower than the EVOI obtained using 

more representative models. Stage 01 was performed as a test to verify if the increment on the 



102 
 

NPV for the extreme models would be the maximum possible values. The verification is done in 

the Section 4.7.5.2. 

The difference in the EVOI values between Stages 2 and 3 is equal 19% and the difference 

between Stage 3 and 4 is equal 4%. There is a variation on the EVOI as more representative 

models are added to the process. It was assumed that the maximum difference between the stages 

was 5%, in order to obtain an accurate EVOI.  

The EVOI is equal to US$28.9 million for the acquisition of information at five years of 

production,. The EVOI obtained was compared to the VOI considering the true earth model. The 

true earth model is known because the methodology was applied to a synthetic reservoir model.  

The VOI obtained was equal to US$25.5 million. The VOI was determined by comparing 

the NPV applying the base production strategy and the NPV applying a production strategy that 

maximizes the economic results for the true earth model. The number of representative models 

used to calculate the EVOI provided an accurate value. 

Usually the EVOI is compared to the cost of 4D seismic data acquisition and processing to 

define whether or not acquire the information. It was considered that the cost of 4D seismic data 

is equal to US$30 million, with the reference date at 01/01/2008.  

However, the EVOI is a weighted measure. It does not show the variation on the NPV 

increase due to the information acquisition. Thus, a new method of evaluation that considers the 

NPV increase variation was designed and is presented in the Section 4.7.5.2.

4.7.5.2. Increase on the Economic Return 

The evaluation of the increase on the economic return is performed through the cumulative 

probability of the increment on the NPV. The probability distribution curve is determined using 

inverse cumulative probability and associated ?NPV values for the representative models. It 

identifies the minimum and maximum possible increase on the economic return that the 

acquisition of new information would provide.  

The cumulative probability curve was determined for Stages 1 to 4 and is presented in 

Figure  4.44. Comparing all stages, there is a high variation on the values of ?NPV for a specific 

probability value. The more representative models are used, the more accurate is the cumulative 

probability curve.

Stage 1 was performed as a test to verify if the increment on the NPV for the extreme 

models would be the maximum possible values. However, Stages 2, 3 and 4 showed the existence 

of representative models with higher values of ?NPV. It was not possible to define a correlation 

between the representative models and the increase on the economic return. 

Figure 4.44 shows that another Stage should be evaluated, because there is a high variation 

in the probability density curves. However, it was assumed that Stage 4 can be used to evaluate 

the chance of success, because the variation on the EVOI was lower than 5%.  

Evaluating Stage 4 curve, the probability of the increase on the NPV to be higher than 4D 

seismic acquisition and processing costs is equal to 44%. Such information better supports the 

decision maker on whether or not acquire 4D seismic data. The decision depends on the risk 

aversion of the decision maker. 

4.7.6. Decision Maker Evaluation 

Based on the data provided by the chance of success analysis, the decision maker can 

choose the following actions: 

? End the evaluation process: 

o Acquire 4D seismic data; 

o Do not acquire 4D seismic data. 

? Continue the evaluation process: 

o Select more representative models to improve the estimation accuracy;  

o Evaluate a different acquisition period; 

o Improve optimization process. 

 

In the current study, the EVOI is lower than the acquisition and processing costs and the 

probability that the increase on the economic return is equal 44%. If the decision maker is risk 

neutral and the minimum probability acceptance is equal 50%, it could be decided not to acquire 

4D seismic data.  

Moreover, production data itself could reduce the reservoir uncertainties at the beginning of 

production. The production results for all scenarios (Figures 4.5 to 4.7) shows that Np and BHP 

results could be used to reduce reservoir uncertainty. 



107 
 

However, the benefit of risk mitigation was not considered and it can justify the acquisition 

of new information. Furthermore, other the existence of unknown unknowns can increase the 

EVOI and the economic return.  

4.8. Conclusions 

Determine the chance of success of a 4D seismic project before the information acquisition 

is necessary to support the decision maker on whether or not acquire new data. A methodology is 

proposed to determine a first estimative and it is applicable to fields in the development phase.  

The methodology is simple and is divided into six steps. Some of the procedures used in the 

methodology are well established in the literature, such as the decision tree technique and value 

of information calculation. Three are the main contributions provided by the thesis: 

 

? The chance of success analysis is performed at the best time for 4D seismic acquisition. If 

the result obtained at such period does not indicate that 4D seismic data can improve the 

economic return of the project, the use of continuous acquisition also would not be viable. 

The methodology to determine the best time to acquire 4D seismic data is described in 

Chapter 3 and it is incorporated to the chance of success methodology; 

? The chance of success is determined by calculating the probability of the increase on the 

economic return to be higher than the acquisition and processing costs. The use of only 

EVOI does not show the variation in the increase on the economic return and does not 

determine the probability of success; 

? It is an iterative process in which the evaluation can be performed to different production 

periods and the accuracy of the results can be increased with the selection of more 

representative models. 

 

The number of representative models is an important step in the methodology. The more 

representative models are selected the more accurate are the results obtained. The selection can 

be done in stages until the variation of EVOI between the stages is less than 5%. However, 

further studies are necessary to determine the minimum number of representative models in order 

to obtain an accurate cumulative probability curve 



108 
 

The methodology was applied to a synthetic reservoir model in order to test its 

applicability. The chance of success was determined considering the acquisition at five years of 

production.  

The selection of representative models was performed in four stages. The variation on the 

EVOI due to the number of representative models considered could be verified.  

The EVOI obtained is equal US$28.9 million and it is similar to the VOI calculated 

considering the true earth model that is US$25.5 million.  

A better way to evaluate the chance of success is to obtain the cumulative probability curve 

of the increase on the economic return. The probability of success is equal 44% to the case 

studied, considering the acquisition and processing costs equal to US$ 30 million,.  

The EVOI and probability obtained are low because approximately 98% of the 

representative models have a recovery factor of more than 50% and there is low flexibility on the 

production strategy improvement.  

The main benefit of 4D seismic data relies on identifying the remaining oil areas. However, 

other factors that influence on the results obtained should be considered. There are many 

influence factors that can increase or decrease the value of information.  

The quantification of such factors should be subject of further studies. The EVOI can be 

increased due to the existence of unknown uncertainties and the existence of future uncertainties, 

such as oil price. The EVOI can be reduced because 4D seismic data is imperfect information and 

other sources of data can reduce the reservoir uncertainties. 

  



109 
 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

The present thesis describes the development of a methodology to estimate the chance of 

success of a 4D seismic project from the reservoir engineering perspective. The methodology was 

developed in three phases, each one described in Chapters 2 to 4. 

Chapter 2 evaluated the impact of 4D seismic data in the history matching process. 4D 

seismic data improved the production forecast and most importantly improved the fluid behavior 

understanding for all production periods analyzed.  

Although production data itself improved the production forecast when breakthrough 

occurs, the water saturation error increased at least 105% while the use of 4D seismic data 

reduced the error at least 76%. 

The water saturation error quantifies the improvement on the reservoir model dynamic data. 

Moreover, it identifies which scenarios have a fluid flow different from the base model and the 

existence of remaining oil areas. 

The time for 4D seismic data acquisition affects the value of 4D seismic data. The best 

period for the information acquisition was between 2 and 4 years of production, for the case 

studied in Chapter 2. 

At such period, it is possible to predict the water breakthrough occurrence and consequently 

make decisions that could delay it. There is enough water saturation error to identify that the base 

model is incorrect and the revenue to be obtained from oil is between 70% and 45%. 

As Chapter 2 showed the importance of the acquisition period on the 4D seismic value, 

Chapter 3 treated this task in a more practical condition. It was developed a methodology to 

obtain a first estimative of the best time for 4D seismic data. The estimative of the best time is 

determined by evaluating the production and dynamic data of all possible scenarios. 

The production data analysis evaluates the time for water breakthrough at production wells. 

The acquisition of 4D seismic data shall be before water breakthrough occurs because decisions 

can be made in order to delay the breakthrough and increase the oil production rate as a 

consequence. 

The dynamic data analysis evaluates the water saturation error curves. The acquisition 

period shall be at the moment in which only 4D seismic data identifies that the base model does 



110 
 

not represent the true earth model and there is enough time to make decision changes. It is 

considered that a normalized water saturation error equal 70% is sufficient to the true earth model 

identification. 

Chapter 3 presented a general methodology to estimate the chance of success of 4D seismic 

data acquisition. It was designed to perform the evaluation before the data acquisition and at the 

field development phase.  

The methodology is simple and iterative process. It is dived in six steps in which some of 

them are well established in the literature. The optimization of production strategy is the most 

time-consuming step. Three are the main contributions provided by the thesis:  

 

? The analysis is performed at the best time for 4D seismic acquisition;  

? In general, the decision of whether or not acquire 4D seismic data is based on the EVOI. 

However, the EVOI is a weighted measure. It does not show the variation in the increase on 

the economic return and does not determine the probability of success. Thus, the 

probability of the increase on the economic return to be higher than the acquisition and 

processing costs is determined; 

? It is an iterative process in which the evaluation can be performed to different production 

periods and the accuracy of the results can be increased with the selection of more 

representative models. 

 

The number of representative models used in the methodology affects the EVOI and the 

probability of success results. The representative models selection can be done in stages until the 

variation of EVOI between the stages is less than 5% and there is no variation on the probability 

density curve. 

The methodology was successfully applied to a synthetic reservoir model. The chance of 

success was determined considering the acquisition at five years of production. There is no 

correlation between the representative models and the increase on the economic return due to 

information acquisition. 

The EVOI obtained is equal US$28.9 million and it is similar to the VOI calculated 

considering the true earth model that is US$25.5 million. The probability of success is equal 

44%, considering the acquisition and processing costs equal to US$ 30 million.  



111 
 

The EVOI and probability obtained are low because approximately 98% of the 

representative models have a recovery factor of more than 50% and there is low flexibility on the 

production strategy improvement. The main benefit of 4D seismic data relies on identifying the 

remaining oil areas  

Determine chance of success of a 4D seismic project is important to support the decision 

maker in the industry daily routine. The methodology presented in the thesis was developed 

considering important assumptions that affect the final results. Below is a list of 

recommendations for future work: 

 

? Quantify the impact of the existence of unknown uncertainties, the fact that information is 

not perfect and the capacity of other source of data to reduce the reservoir uncertainties; 

? Evaluate the impact of the number of representative models on the cumulative probability 

curve and define the minimum number to obtain an accurate value; 

? Incorporate the risk mitigation benefit into the valuation of the information.

APPENDIX A: USE OF EMULATOR METHODOLOGY FOR 

UNCERTAINTY REDUCTION QUANTIFICATION 

Abstract 

In petroleum engineering, simulation models are used in the reservoir performance 

prediction and in the decision making process. These models are complex systems, typically 

characterized by a vast number of input parameters. Usually the physical state of the reservoir is 

highly uncertain, and thus the appropriate parameters of the input choices. The uncertainty 

analysis often proceeds by first calibrating the simulator against observed production history and 

then using the calibrated model to forecast future well production. Most models go through a 

series of iterations before being judged to give an adequate representation of the physical system. 

This can be a difficult task since the input space to be searched may be high dimensional, the 

collection of outputs to be matched may be very large, and each single evaluation may take a 

long time. As the uncertainty analysis is complex and time consuming; in this appendix, a 

stochastic representation of the computer model was constructed, called an emulator, to quantify 

the reduction in the parameter input space due to production data over different production 

periods. The emulator methodology represents a powerful and general tool in the analysis of 

complex physical models such as reservoir simulators. Such emulation techniques have been 

successfully applied across a large number of scientific disciplines. The emulator methodology 

was applied to evaluate the production data capacity to identify uncertain reservoir physical 

features over the production period for a synthetic reservoir simulation model. The synthetic 

model was built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. In the case studied, 

thousands of realizations were required to identify certain physical reservoir features. This 

justifies the use of emulation and shows the importance of this technique for the identification of 

regions of feasible input parameters. Moreover, the impact on the input space reduction due to 

different production periods was determined. The emulator methodology used assists in carrying 

out tasks that require computationally expensive objective function evaluation, such as 

identifying regions of feasible input parameters; making predictions for future behavior of the 

physical system and investigating the reservoir behavior.

Introduction 

Reservoir simulators are important and widely-used in reservoir management. It is used in 

the reservoir performance prediction and in the decision making process. These simulators are 

computer implementations of high-dimensional mathematical models for reservoirs, where the 

model inputs are physical parameters and the outputs are observable characteristics such as well 

pressure measurements, fluid production and so forth. The uncertainties are always present in the 

reservoir characterization process, thus the input parameters are usually uncertain so is the 

simulator output.  

The procedure to calibrate the reservoir simulation model is called history matching. Based 

on observed data, the set of possible input choices for the reservoir model is identified. Two 

different procedures can be used to perform the history match process: the deterministic and the 

probabilistic approach. 

The deterministic approach involves running the initial simulation model with different 

input values to obtain one simulation model between many probable matches to the field data. 

According to Elrafie et al. (2009), the conventional procedure does not handle the uncertainty of 

all model variables and the possibility to identify and carry forward a set of multiple history 

match model scenarios to predictive forecasting. 

In a probabilistic approach, in which several reservoir model scenarios are considered, the 

uncertainty analysis procedure is used in the process. Identifying the input parameters for which 

the simulation outputs match the observed data, can be a difficult task because the input space to 

be searched may be high dimensional, the collection of outputs to be matched may be very large, 

and each single evaluation may take a long time. 

To deal with the large number of iterations and high computational resources commonly 

encountered in the probabilistic approach, proxy models are used. Zubarev (2009) define proxy 

models as a mathematically defined function that replicates the simulation model output for 

selected input parameters. Several papers show the use of different proxy-modeling algorithms in 

the history matching process (Cullick, 2006; Junker et al., 2006 and Slotte and Smorgrav, 2008). 

As the history match process and uncertainty reduction quantification is complex and time 

consuming; the current appendix shows the workflow used to quantify the reduction in the 

parameter input space due to production data over different production periods. The workflow 



121 
 

comprises the construction of a proxy model called an emulator. The emulator technique was 

applied to a synthetic reservoir simulation model, built to represent a region of an injector and 

related producers. 

The emulator represents a powerful and general tool in the analysis of complex physical 

models such as reservoir simulators. Such emulation techniques have been successfully applied in 

reservoir simulation problems, as seen in Cumming &amp;amp; Goldstein (2009), and references therein. 

Objective 

Describe a workflow to evaluate the production data capacity to identify uncertain reservoir 

physical features over the production period using the emulation technique. Moreover, show the 

application for a synthetic reservoir simulation model built to represent a region of an injector 

and related producers. 

Proposed Methodology 

The workflow used to construct the emulator is presented. It is important to highlight that a 

synthetic reservoir model is used. There is no historical data available in the process, thus the 

production data considered as historical data derived from a hypothetical reality selected from 

possible scenarios. These scenarios were obtained through an uncertainty analysis performed on 

the initial reservoir simulation model. 

The workflow was designed to quantify the simulation reservoir model uncertainty 

reduction due to production data. The objective was to identify the inputs of a reservoir 

simulation model, within a possible input parameter space, whose outputs match to the 

hypothetical historical production data. The workflow used is shown in Figure  A1. Each stage is 

described as follows.

Input and Output Parameter Definition 

In reservoir simulation, uncertain inputs are physical parameters determined through an 

uncertainty analysis performed on the base model. The outputs of the model are observable 

characteristics such as well-bottom-hole pressure, water rate at production wells and water 

saturation maps. The input variable selection depends on the underlying problem and knowledge 

of the engineer. 

The physical state of the reservoir uncertainty varies due to the amount of information 

available and production period. As in the current study, the analysis is being performed in the 

field development phase; the uncertainty of the appropriate choices of the input parameters for 

the reservoir model is high. 



123 
 

Input Data Set Sampling 

The input data set sampling is an important stage in creating an adequate emulator. 

Different sampling methods exist and have been applied in reservoir simulations. The Latin 

Hypercube Design (LHD) is efficient and was selected as a sampling method to this work. 

Scenarios were generated based on the input parameter space and sampled using the LHD. The 

selected scenarios were simulated using commercial simulation software to obtain the production 

outputs. The sampled input parameters and resulting simulation outputs were used to construct 

the emulator. 

Emulator Estimation 

The emulator is an approximation of the existing numerical reservoir model. It should be 

able to replicate the response of a simulated model. The general structure to develop the emulator 

was based on Cumming &amp;amp; Goldstein (2009) and Vernon et al. (2013) and is as follows. 

The simulator is represented by a vector function, taking inputs x which represent the 

vector of reservoir input parameters, and return the output parameter f(x). The output parameter 

f(x) intends to represent the real physical system output y. The field observed outputs is 

represented by z, as field observation is susceptible to measurement errors, the difference 

between z and y is represented by 

z=y+e,                                                                                                                                                       (A1) 

 

where e is the vector of random observational errors, taken to be independent of y. If f(x) was a 

perfect representation of the system, then an input vector x* only would be accepted as 

representing the system if f(x*) = y. In practice, however, the simulation reservoir model f 

simplifies the physics and approximates the solution of the resulting equations. Therefore, the 

structural discrepancy is represented by 

y=f(x*)+?,                                                                                                                                                 (A2) 

 



124 
 

where ? is the random structural discrepancy vector and is independent of f(x*). Combining 

Equation A1 and Equation A2 the input parameters x* is acceptable if it is probabilistically 

consistent with the relation 

z=f(x*)+?+e,                                                                                                                               (A3) 

 

The objective is to identify all choices of x* which would give acceptable fits to available 

production data or to identify a wide range of elements x* belonging to the input parameter space 

X(z). If the input parameter space was low dimensional, and the function was very fast to 

evaluate, then it would be possible to estimate X(z) by evaluating the function in the entire space 

and identify the collection of all x* choices consistent with Equation A3. However, for a 

reservoir simulation model it is infeasible to evaluate the simulator at enough choices to search 

the input space exhaustively. Therefore, a representation of the output uncertainty at each input 

choice must be constructed. This representation is termed an emulator. 

The emulator both suggests an approximation to the function and also contains an 

assessment of the likely magnitude of the error of the approximation. The form for emulation of 

output component   ? is 

  ?( )  ?        ( )    ( ),                                                                                                      (A4) 

 

where x are the input variables, i is the output being emulated, j is the number of function 

elements, B = {?ij} are unknown scalars, gij are known deterministic functions of x and ui(x) 

express local variation with constant variance. In this work multiple linear regression was used to 

determine B, gij and ui; therefore the following assumptions must be satisfied: 

 

• Linearity: expected value of u(x) must be equal zero, E(u)=0; 

• Homoscedasticity and Independence of Errors: Var(u) = ?² and Cov(ui,uj) = 0. 



125 
 

Emulator Diagnostics 

Emulator diagnostics is the process of assessing an emulator’s prediction accuracy and 

quality. The response values predicted by the emulator must comprise the results of the full 

numerical simulation for the input dataset. Moreover, two measures were evaluated. The first is 

the squared multiple correlation (R²); according to Rice (1995) this coefficient is used as a crude 

measure of the strength of a relationship and the second measure is the standard error (?) which 

offers a first handle on how well the fitted equation fits the sample data. These measures are 

     
   

   
 and                                                                                                                       (A5) 

 

  ?
   

   
                                                                                                                                    (A6) 

 

where RSS is the residual sum of squares obtained by calculating the square difference between 

the fitted and observed value; RYY is the total sum of squares obtained by calculating the square 

difference between the fitted and mean observed value; n is the number of data points and p is the 

number of parameters to be estimated (ZUBAREV,, 2005). 

Rice (1995) comments that, it is necessary to evaluate the residuals to assess the quality of 

the fit. Plots of the residuals versus the fitted values were used to find failures of assumptions. 

Ideally the residual should show no relation to the x values, and the plot should look like a 

horizontal blur.  

Implausibility Analysis 

The implausibility analysis is performed to obtain the input parameters whose outputs 

match the hypothetical historical data. The hypothetical historical data is derived from a 

hypothetical reality selected from all possible scenarios generated in the uncertainty analysis; 

moreover these inputs are obtained to improve the emulator reliability and to evaluate the 

uncertainty reduction at the end of the process. 



126 
 

The range of input parameters that are member of X(z) is determined through the 

implausibility value calculation (I). For each set of input parameters an emulator output   ?( ) is 

obtained; with this data the implausibility value is 

  
 ( )  

(      ? ( ) )
 

   [ ? ( )]                
,                                                                                                           (A7) 

 

where zi is the hypothetical historical output value, E[  ?( )] is the emulator output expected value 

and    [ ? ( )]                     are the variances of the emulator output value, structural 

discrepancy (?) and observational errors (e) respectively. 

Large values of   
 ( ) suggest that it is implausible that x ?  X(z). As for each vector of 

inputs x there are many implausibility values, one for each output, the implausibilities are then 

combined. The implausibility value I(x) for a vector of inputs x is considered as being the 

maximum value among all Ii(x) obtained.  

The input parameters x that satisfy x ?  X(z) are called non-implausible parameters, since in 

the next iteration the same input may be found to be no longer plausible. If the emulator is not 

accurate enough or X(z) does not enable a better understanding of the reservoir’s physical 

features, more simulation runs are designed within the ‘non-implausible’ regions in the input 

space and the emulation analysis is repeated iteratively; each iteration is called a Wave 

(Cumming &amp;amp; Goldstein, 2009; Vernon et al., 2013) 

The maximum acceptable implausibility value cutoff determines whether an input 

parameter vector (x) is viewed as non-implausible or not. This value can be defined based on 

various considerations as discussed in Vernon et al. (2013), but often the cutoff used is equal to 

the critical value of some appropriate distribution, for example the standard normal distribution. 

Non-Implausible Inputs Evaluation 

The ‘non-implausible’ input parameters obtained at the end of the process represent the 

input parameters of the reservoir simulation model, whose outputs match to the hypothetical 

historical production data. These parameters are evaluated to identify how much production data 

improved the reservoir model understanding.  



127 
 

While carrying out these analysis considering different production periods, it is possible to 

evaluate the impact of the production period over the reservoir uncertainty reduction. 

Results 

It is shown the application of the workflow described in the previous topic to a synthetic 

reservoir model built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. The uncertainty 

reduction was quantified considering two different production periods: the first at an early stage 

of production (1000 days) and the second at an intermediate stage of production (3500 days). 

Base Model 

The reservoir simulation model designed in the field development phase is called base 

model. In this study the base model consists of a five-spot configuration and is structurally 

represented by a horizontal top at -1000 m, discretized with a 45 x 45 x 1 grid in the x, y and z 

directions, respectively, with a dimension of 40 m in the three directions, totaling 2025 blocks. A 

light oil and Black Oil fluid model was used and presents a constant permeability equal to 

500 mD and a constant porosity equal to 20%. The model takes approximately 10 seconds to be 

simulated. The base model were built by Risso (2007) and modified by Machado (2010). The 

permeability map is presented in Figure  A2.

Seventeen production output parameters were selected to evaluate the impact of production 

data acquisition in the reservoir model uncertainty reduction. The definition of each is as follows: 

? f1(x) to f4(x): production well 01 to 04 bottom-hole pressure (BHP); 

? f5(x): injector well bottom-hole pressure (BHP); 

? f6(x) to f9(x): production well 01 to 04 water rate; 

? f10(x) to f13(x): production well 01 to 04 time to breakthrough (BT). 

Input Data Set Sampling 

The selection of the first input data sampling was obtained through the Latin Hypercube 

sampling method. Two hundred vectors of inputs x, from the initial input space, were sampled 

generating 200 scenarios. The probability distribution of all uncertainties was considered 

uniform. Figure  A4 shows two dimensional projections of the locations of the 200 input vectors 

used. 

 



130 
 

 
Figure A.4. First set of input data values, generated from a LHD of size 200. 

 

The generated scenarios were simulated to obtain the production outputs f(x). The sampled 

input parameters and resulted simulation outputs were used to estimate the emulator in the first 

iteration (Wave 1). The initial input space is reduced at the end of the Wave 1 analysis due to the 

imposition of the implausibility cutoff; the new input space then consists of the non-implausible 

input parameters: those whose outputs may match the hypothetical historical data. 

In order to improve the emulators’ quality and reduce even more the input space, a new 

data sample is obtained using the LHD from the non-implausible input space derived from the 

Wave 1 analysis. The Wave 2 analysis consists of estimating new emulators using this new Wave 

2 data sample. The quantity of iterations (Waves) depends on the emulator quality needed, 

reduction in the input parameter space, computational and time resources. 



131 
 

Emulator Estimation and Diagnostic 

To estimate the emulator some assumption were adopted: 

 

? As the study is performed with hypothetical historical data, no measurement errors are 

considered. Therefore, in this study the observational error is equal to zero; 

? There is no structural discrepancy between the simulator and real physical system output, 

thus, ? is equal to zero. 

 

Three interactions (Wave 1, 2 and 3) were needed to obtain the non-implausible input space 

X(z) for each of the production period analyzed. For the period of production equal 1000 days, 

the output f10(x) to f13(x) were not used, since there is no water breakthrough at the production 

wells up to this period. Moreover, in both cases for Wave 1 analysis only BHP outputs were 

emulated; the water rate linear models obtained were not judged to be accurate enough based on 

their diagnostics. 

Implausibility Analysis 

To determine the ‘non-implausible’ inputs a hypothetical reality was selected from the 

initial input space. The hypothetical reality used has a high permeability channel; its position and 

permeability values are shown in Figure  A5 and its input values are presented in Table A2.

kc channel permeability 2000.5 mD 

k reservoir permeability 274.7 mD 

 

Each vector from the input parameter space is evaluated to determine if the output 

parameter obtained using the emulator may match the hypothetical reality output. This evaluation 

is performed by analyzing the implausibility value obtained. In the case studied the maximum 

implausibility value cutoff was chose to be equal to the 99% critical value of the corresponding 

standard normal distribution, and hence set to 2.576. 

A vector from the initial input parameter space is considered non-implausible if the 

implausibility value is less than the cutoff using the emulators obtained in Wave 1, 2 and 3 

analyses. Table A3 shows the reduction in the parameter space as the implausibility analysis is 



133 
 

performed over the three waves. The results obtained show the importance of using an emulator 

in the uncertainty quantification reduction. The volume of input parameter space considered non-

implausible was found to be a small proportion of the original input space.

Non-Implausible Inputs Evaluation 

To obtain a significant number of non-implausible input parameters an initial space of 

8e+08 vectors were used. The input space considered non-implausible after all Waves analyses 

for the production periods equal to 1000 and 3500 days is shown in Figures A6 and A7, 

respectively. 

Each square shows the relation between the corresponding variables; the colors are related 

to how close the emulator output obtained using a certain input parameter value match the 

hypothetical output value. Red and pink colors represent values closer and not so close, 

respectively, to the hypothetical output value. 

At an early stage of production, Figure A6, it was possible to identify with high accuracy 

the field permeability. The range of x and y channel position was narrowed, but channel length 

values equal to zero was possible to obtain. Zero values to channel length indicate no channel 

exists. It was not possible to obtain significant information about the channel permeability, angle 

and width at this stage.

Figure A.7. Non-implausible inputs for period of production equal 3500 days. 

 

For an intermediate production period, Figure A7, a significant uncertainty reduction is 

obtained using production data. In addition to the field permeability, x and y channel position are 

close to the hypothetical reality values. It was possible to better understand the channel length, 

however no significant information was obtained about the channel permeability and width, 

perhaps suggesting a limit to the amount of information that can be obtained from this production 

data (or that more waves could be required). 

The uncertainty reduction can also be seen in Figures A8, to A19. The cumulative oil 

production, bottom-hole pressure and water rate for the production wells are presented for the 



136 
 

initial input data set (red lines), scenarios obtained after the uncertainty reduction at 1000 (green 

lines) and 3500 (cyan lines) days, with the reality model shown as a single dark blue line. The 

production data results were obtained by simulating the scenarios using a simulation software. 

There is a significant uncertainty reduction using production data up to 1000 days for most 

of the wells, however for production well 03 there are still high uncertainty. The uncertainty at 

production well 03 was reduced using production data up to 3500 days. Note the strong 

agreement for several outputs between the cyan lines and the dark blue line of the reality model, 

implying that we have found many locations in input space that are consistent with the observed 

data. The agreement at late times also implies that we could make accurate predictions of the 

future behavior of the reality model based solely on the data at 1000 and 3500 days.

Conclusions 

A workflow to determine the input parameters whose output values match to historical data 

using emulation techniques was presented. The workflow was successfully applied to a five-spot 

synthetic case that was built to represent a region of an injector and related producers. The 

uncertainty reduction of a reservoir model due to new information acquisition for different 

production periods was quantified. The field production data used was obtained by considering a 

hypothetical reality among all possible scenarios, since the analysis was performed at the 

development stage and used a synthetic model. Two periods of production were evaluated: at an 

early production stage (1000 days) and at an intermediate production stage (3500 days). 

The results obtained showed the importance of using emulators in the uncertainty reduction 

quantification and history matching process. The number of input parameters considered non-

implausible was a small set of the initial input space. At an early stage it was possible to reduce 

the uncertainty by identifying the hypothetical real field permeability and identifying possible 

values for channel positioning. However, other important physical features were not identified, 

such as the channel permeability, width and length. At an intermediate stage, the uncertainty 



143 
 

reduction was higher. However, still some important physical features that impact on production 

prediction, such as channel permeability and width were not identified; therefore, further steps of 

this research will test the application of the emulation technique with seismic 4D  data to reduce 

uncertainty.

APPENDIX B: DESCRIPTION OF THE INITIAL BASE MODEL 

PRODUCTION STRATEGY 

Chapter 4 mentioned that the process to generate the reservoir scenarios needed to be 

performed again. It occurred because in the phase of production strategy improvement it was 

found out that the optimal production strategy of the representative model improved the 

economic results from the base model. The reservoir scenarios were generated again considering 

the optimal base production strategy and used in the following chance of success methodology 

steps. The appendix shows the initial base model production strategy description and production 

data results from the corresponding scenarios. 

Initial Base Model Production Strategy Description 

The geological and structure of the reservoir model is the same presented in the Item 4.6.1. 

The initial production strategy used consists of eleven production wells and eight water injector 

wells. Figure B1 shows a 3D view of the reservoir base model with the injector and production 

wells.

Uncertainty and Risk Analysis 

The reservoir model uncertainty considered was the same presented in the Item 4.6.2. 

Discrete Latin Hypercube was used to generate 500 scenarios. It was considered that all attributes 

have a uniform distribution. The field production results for all scenarios and base model are 

presented in Figures B2 to B4. The curves pattern remained the same; however the range of the 

cumulative oil production and reservoir pressure presented lower values to the initial production 

strategy.

Economic Results Comparison 

The comparison between the production economic results from the base model using the 

initial production strategy and the optimal one is presented in Table B1. There was an increase of 

21.2% in the NPV and 7.7% of oil production; thus the chance of success methodology presented 

in Chapter 4 used the base model optimal production strategy.

APPENDIX C: DESCRIPTION OF THE OPTIMIZATION 

PROCESS  

Introduction 

This item presents the strategy optimization process executed to the representative models 

RM1 and RM2 after five years of production. The production of the reservoir presents some 

constraints related to the platform size and reservoir properties. The constraints considered in the 

reservoir simulation model are: 

 

? Production well minimum bottom-hole pressure (BHP): 215 kgf/cm²; 

? Production well maximum bottom-hole pressure (BHP): 350 kgf/cm²; 

? Platform maximum total production liquid rate (STL): 23.000 m³/day; 

? Platform maximum total injector water rate (STL): 23.000 m³/day. 

 

The optimization process considered the following actions due to the high number of 

production and injector wells: 

 

? Drilling of a one new production or injector well; 

? Maximum surface oil rate limitation; 

? Water rate control. 

 

The performance indicator that defines the best production strategy is the NPV, however 

other indicators were verified: 

 

? Cumulative Oil Production (Np); 

? Recovery Factor (RF); 

? Cumulative Water Production (Wp). 



152 
 

RM1 Strategy Optimization 

The performance indicators obtained using the base production strategy are presented in 

Table C1. The RM1 model quality map (total oil per unit area) was evaluated to identify possible 

drill positions to new production or injector well. The quality maps obtained after 30 years of 

production from Layers 1 and 6 are presented in Figures C1 and C2.

Test 01 presented the highest value of NPV and RF; thus, the tests related to the reservoir 

management were performed considering a new production well in position 01 (Test 01). The 

production wells water and oil rate of Test 01 model are presented in Figures C4 and C5, 

respectively.

Figure C.5. Test 01 RM1 model production wells water rate. 

 

The reservoir management tests were performed using the software CMOST® to combine 

all the possibilities. The tests performed considered: 

 

? A limitation on the oil production to extend the production plateau period and increase 

the efficiency of the production wells. The limit values were defined for each 

production well based on the results presented in Figure B3; 

? The water cut variation for the production wells with highest water rate presented in 

Figure B4. 

 

The values of maximum surface oil rate tested are presented in Table C4.The water cut 

variation was tested to the production wells: PROD 01, PROD 02, PROD 03, PROD 09, PROD 

10, PROD 12, PROD 14 and PROD 15; the values used are equal to 0.85 and 0.90.

The results of the water cut values and maximum surface oil rate that maximize the NPV

production wells the inclusion of a limit on the surface oil rate does not improve the performance 

results; in these cases no value of STO is shown in Table C5. 

The comparison between the results obtained to the RM1 model using the base production 

strategy and the optimized strategy are presented in Table C6. There was an increase in US$ 49.2 

million due to the production strategy optimization.

Test 02 presented the highest value of NPV and RF; thus, the tests related to the reservoir 

management were performed considering a new production well in position 02 (Test 02). The 

production wells water and oil rate of Test 02 model are presented in Figure C9  and C10, 

respectively. 

The reservoir management tests were performed using the software CMOST® to combine 

all the possibilities, using the same consideration presented in the RM1 model optimization. 

The values of maximum surface oil rate tested are presented in Table C10. The water cut 

variation was tested to the production wells: PROD 02, PROD 03, PROD 05, PROD 07, PROD 

09, PROD 11, PROD 13, PROD 14 and PROD 15; the values used are equal to 0.85 and 0.90. A 

total number of 230 tests were performed by CMOST®, however the results obtained did not 

increased the performance indicators. 

Test 02 was considered the optimized production strategy. The comparison between the 

results obtained to the RM2 model using the base production strategy and the optimized strategy 

are presented in Table C11. There was an increase in US$ 20.7 million due to the production 

strategy optimization.
