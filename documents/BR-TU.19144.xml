RESUMO 

A presente dissertação consiste na apresentação de 3 artigos, envolvendo estudos 

básicos de geração e caracterização de micro e nanobolhas, e aplicação na flotação de 

óleo emulsificado em solução aquosa (salina). Nanobolhas (D32 = 150 - 250 nm) foram 

geradas por uma bomba centrífuga multifásica (Nikuni KTMD20N) e válvula agulha 

em uma coluna de reciclo, em pressões de operação variadas e diferentes tensões 

interfaciais ar/líquido. As nanobolhas foram resistentes ao cisalhamento causado no 

rotor da bomba e a altas pressões de operação, atingindo a maior concentração numérica 

(4,1 x 109 nanobolhas mL-1) na pressão de operação de 5 bar e tensão interfacial de 49 

mN m-1 (holdup de ar = 6,8%). Em escala de bancada, emulsões oleosas (petróleo cru) 

em água salina foram floculadas utilizando uma poliacrilamida catiônica em pH 7. As 

melhores remoções de óleo foram obtidas na flotação com micro e nanobolhas 

utilizando uma pressão de saturação de 5 bar e 5 mg L-1 de Dismulgan. A flotação 

seguiu um modelo cinético de primeira ordem, com k de 1,3 e 1,8 min-1 para Psat de 3,5 

e 5 bar, respectivamente. A injeção de nanobolhas em uma etapa de condicionamento 

após a floculação aumentou a eficiência geral da separação em até 11%. A separação 

com nanobolhas isoladas mostrou uma eficiência de remoção de óleo de 75 e 90%, com 

e sem NaCl (30 g L-1). Foi estudado o processo de floculação em linha e flotação em 

coluna para o tratamento de emulsões oleosas contendo 70-400 mg L-1 (turbidez = 70-

226 NTU) de óleo (petróleo cru) e salinidade (30 e 100 g L-1 NaCl). A floculação foi 

realizada com uma poliacrilamida catiônica, em dois Reatores Geradores de Flocos 

(RGF®), com estágios de mistura rápida e lenta (perda de carga = 0,9 a 3,5 bar). A 

flotação foi realizada em duas colunas (1,5 e 2,5 m), com microbolhas (5-80 ?m) e 

nanobolhas (50-300 nm de diâmetro, 108 nanobolhas mL-1) geradas por uma bomba 

centrífuga multifásica e uma válvula agulha. A maior eficiência foi obtida com a coluna 

mais alta,  em uma taxa de aplicação de 10 m h-1, reduzindo o teor de óleo residual para 

4 mg L-1 e turbidez para 7 NTU. Em alta taxa de aplicação superficial (27,5 m h-1), as 

concentrações de óleo residuais ficaram abaixo do padrão de emissão para plataformas 

marítimas (EPA - 29 mg L-1), atingindo 18 mg L-1.

ABSTRACT 

The present dissertation consists in the presentation of 3 articles, involving basic studies 

on the generation and characterization of micro and nanobubbles, and application in 

flotation of emulsified oil in aqueous solution (saline). Nanobubbles (D32 = 150-250 

nm) were generated by a centrifugal multiphase pump (Nikuni KTMD20N) and a 

needle valve in a recycle column, at various operating pressures and different air/liquid 

interfacial tensions. The nanobubbles were resistant to shear caused in the pump 

impellers and to high operating pressures, reaching the highest numerical concentration 

(4.1 x 109 nanobubbles mL-1) at the operating pressure of 5 bar and interfacial tension of 

49 mN m-1 (air holdup = 6.8%). On the bench scale, oily emulsions (crude oil) in saline 

water were flocculated using a cationic polyacrylamide at pH 7. The best oil removals 

were obtained in flotation with micro and nanobubbles using a saturation pressure of 5 

bar and 5 mg L-1 of Dismulgan. The flotation followed a first-order kinetic model, with 

k of 1.3 and 1.8 min-1 for Psat of 3.5 and 5 bar, respectively. Injection of nanobubbles 

in a conditioning stage after the flocculation increased the overall separation efficiency 

by up to 11%. Separation with isolated nanobubbles showed an oil removal efficiency 

of 75 and 90%, with and without NaCl (30 g L-1). The in-line flocculation and column 

flotation process for the treatment of oily emulsions containing 70-400 mg L-1 (turbidity 

= 70-226 NTU) of oil (crude oil) and salinity (30 and 100 g L- NaCl) was studied. The 

flocculation was performed with a cationic polyacrylamide in two Flocs Generator 

Reactors (FGR®), with fast and slow mixing stages (load loss = 0.9 to 3.5 bar). The 

flotation was carried out in two columns (1.5 and 2.5 m), with microbubbles (5-80 ?m) 

and nanobubbles (50-300 nm in diameter, 108 nanobubbles mL-1) generated by a 

centrifugal multiphase pump and a needle valve. The highest efficiency was obtained 

with the highest column, with a hydraulic loading of 10 m h-1, reducing the residual oil 

content to 4 mg L-1 and turbidity to 7 NTU. At high hydraulic loading (27.5 m h -1), the 

residual oil concentrations were below the emission standard for offshore platforms 

(EPA - 29 mg L-1), reaching 18 mg L-1.

1 INTRODUÇÃO 

 

Nanobolhas (NBs) são cavidades gasosas com tamanho de diâmetro na escala 

nanométrica (1–1000 nm). Ocorrem como unidades altamente estáveis, dispersas em 

meio líquido (bulk NBs), ou adsorvidas em superfícies sólidas (NBs interfaciais ou 

superficiais), e não apresentam movimento de ascensão típico de microbolhas (MBs; 1-

100 µm) e bolhas macrométricas (~100 µm-2 mm). Devido a peculiaridades nas suas 

propriedades físicas, químicas e físico-químicas, o potencial de aplicação das NBs em 

diversos processos vem sendo intensamente pesquisado por diversos autores nos 

últimos anos, incluindo a flotação mineral e a flotação avançada de poluentes aquosos.  

As principais propriedades das NBs são a alta estabilidade, longevidade e rápida adesão 

em superfícies e partículas coloidais hidrofóbicas. Estas características têm ampliado o 

número de aplicações na medicina, na limpeza de superfícies, na indústria da 

mineração, em sistemas de geração de energia, na agricultura, na aceleração do 

metabolismo em espécies animais e vegetais, na composição de concretos pozolânicos, 

na remoção de poluentes e outras áreas diversas (Agarwal et al., 2011; Azevedo et al., 

2016; Cavalli et al., 2015; Ebina et al., 2013; Khoshroo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2008; Liu 

et al., 2012; Lukianova-Hleb et al., 2014; Lukianova-Hleb et al., 2012; Oshita &amp;amp; Liu, 

2013).  

As principais aplicações das NBs na área ambiental (flotação de poluentes aquosos e 

tratamento de efluentes) incluem a remoção de precipitados coloidais e nanopartículas 

(orgânicas e inorgânicas) por flotação assistida por NBs ou por NBs isoladas (processo 

de “flutuação” – separação de partículas coloidais pela diminuição da densidade dos 

agregados) (Amaral Filho et al., 2016; Etchepare et al., 2017; Calgaroto et al., 2016), 

limpeza de superfícies sólidas (Liu e Craig, 2009; Zhu et al., 2016), defouling e/ou 

prevenção de fouling de membranas de tratamento de águas e efluentes ou da indústria 

química e alimentícia (Wu et al., 2008; Ghadimkhani et al., 2016), aeração de sistemas 

aeróbios e no crescimento de micro-organismos específicos utilizados no tratamento de 

efluentes e/ou remediação de áreas degradadas (Temesgen et al., 2017), e a remediação 

de ambientes aquáticos degradados (Hu e Xia, 2018). 

Embora o potencial tecnológico da utilização de NBs seja enorme, ainda são muito 

poucas as aplicações dessas tecnologias em escala real, principalmente nas áreas de 



14 

 

 

engenharia, estando ainda limitadas ao setor acadêmico, em fase de pesquisa e 

desenvolvimento de tecnologias para transferência ao setor produtivo e de serviços. 

Maiores investigações na geração e aplicações sustentáveis dessas bolhas nanométricas 

são necessárias para viabilização de produtos tecnológicos na área de tratamento e reúso 

de águas e efluentes líquidos. 

Diversos processos geram efluentes contaminados com óleos, como na extração de 

petróleo (água produzida) e indústrias que utilizam derivados de combustíveis fósseis 

(gasolina, diesel, óleo BPF etc.). Há ainda águas oleosas oriundas da lavagem de pisos, 

tanques e peças, processos de usinagem, entre outros. Na forma emulsificada, o 

diâmetro de gotas de óleo está, frequentemente, abaixo de 50 ?m. Sua separação por 

processos gravitacionais é difícil devido à estabilidade do sistema, sendo geralmente 

utilizados os processos físico-químicos auxiliados por agentes desestabilizantes (Da 

Rosa, 2002). O tratamento de efluentes oleosos em plataformas marítimas apresenta 

dificuldades técnicas devido às limitações de área física, peso dos equipamentos e o 

tempo de residência da água produzida a bordo, que geralmente não ultrapassa 15 min 

(Gabardo, 2007). Neste contexto, existe a necessidade de desenvolver e aprimorar 

processos de tratamento com alta taxa de processamento para este efluente, 

especialmente em unidades compactas, que ocupem áreas reduzidas nas plataformas. 

A flotação por ar dissolvido (FAD) (Rodrigues e Rubio, 2007) é um método físico-

químico de separação extensamente empregado no tratamento de águas e de efluentes 

oleosos emulsificados (Santander et al., 2011; Santo et al., 2012). A distribuição de 

tamanho de bolhas e gotas de óleo desempenha um papel fundamental na eficiência de 

flotação. As bolhas pequenas (micro e nanobolhas) apresentam grandes áreas 

superficiais, que são bastante úteis na agregação e separação das gotículas (Santander, 

Rodrigues, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2011; Saththasivam, Loganathan, &amp;amp; Sarp, 2016). Em células de 

flotação, o aumento da relação altura/diâmetro (H/D) proporciona uma maior 

probabilidade de colisão, adesão e arraste dos agregados (Yanatos et al., 1988). Desta 

maneira, a utilização de colunas como células de separação constitui uma alternativa 

tecnológica bastante promissora no tratamento de efluentes em alta taxa de aplicação 

superficial (m h-1) (Rubio e Zaneti, 2009; Zaneti et al., 2012; 2011).

empresa Hidrocicle.   

2.1 ARTIGO I – NANOBOLHAS: GERAÇÃO UTILIZANDO UMA BOMBA 

MULTIFÁSICA, PROPRIEDADES E CARACTERÍSTICAS NA 

FLOTAÇÃO  

 

A partir de referências de literatura que reportam as vantagens das NBs geradas por 

cavitação hidrodinâmica, por sistemas consistidos de bombas centrífugas e constritores 

de fluxo do tipo tubos de venturi adaptados (cavitation tube), na recuperação de 

partículas minerais em processos de flotação em coluna  (Ahmadi et al., 2014; Fan et 

al., 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2010d; Sobhy, 2013; Sobhy &amp;amp; Tao, 2013), foi desenvolvido 

um estudo conceitual de geração de NBs em regime contínuo (recirculação de água), 

utilizando um sistema composto por bomba centrífuga e constritor de fluxo tipo válvula 

agulha, avaliando a concentração numérica de NBs por unidade de líquido e seu 

tamanho médio, buscando atingir uma condição ótima de geração de NBs em alta taxa. 

Foi utilizado um equipamento com a técnica Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA, 

ZetaView®, Particle Metrix, Alemanha), que permite a quantificação das NBs em 

sistemas líquidos (número de NBs mL-1) e a sua caracterização físico-química com 

medidas de tamanho e potencial zeta. Foram avaliados parâmetros envolvidos na 

geração de NBs por cavitação hidrodinâmica (pressão de saturação e tensão interfacial 

do líquido). 

2.2 ARTIGO II – SEPARAÇÃO DE PETRÓLEO EMULSIFICADO EM ÁGUA 

SALINA POR FLOTAÇÃO POR AR DISSOLVIDO COM MICRO E 

NANOBOLHAS 

Neste artigo foi investigado o efeito das NBs na remoção de petróleo emulsificado em 

água salina, em escala de bancada. A descoberta da geração de NBs no processo de 



18 

 

 

FAD e um processo de separação das NBs e MBs (Calgaroto et al., 2014), e da remoção 

de precipitados coloidais de amina (Calgaroto et al., 2016) como antecedentes técnicos 

da pesquisa sobre nanobolhas no LTM motivaram a investigação dos seus efeitos nos 

processos de flotação para o tratamento de efluentes diversos, com poluentes-alvo 

orgânicos ou inorgânicos. 

Este artigo avaliou os parâmetros concentração de reagente floculante (poliacrilamida 

catiônica - Dismulgan) e pressão de saturação, na FAD aplicada na remoção de petróleo 

emulsificado. Foi obtida uma melhora na eficiência de separação quando os flocos 

oleosos foram condicionados com NBs previamente à injeção de bolhas maiores. Ainda, 

as NBs isoladas mostraram-se capazes de separar petróleo emulsificado. Os parâmetros 

de resposta foram o teor de óleo residual, eficiência de remoção e cinética de flotação.  

Os resultados são explicados em termos de fenômenos interfaciais, que fazem com que 

as NBs auxiliem na agregação das gotículas de óleo (hidrofóbicas), diminuam sua 

densidade e aumentem a probabilidade de captura por outras bolhas.  

2.3 ARTIGO III – SEPARAÇÃO DE PETRÓLEO EMULSIFICADO EM 

ÁGUA SALINA POR FLOTAÇÃO POR AR DISSOLVIDO COM MICRO 

E NANOBOLHAS GERADAS POR BOMBA CENTRÍFUGA 

Este estudo abrange os conhecimentos desenvolvidos nos trabalhos anteriores, 

aplicando micro e nanobolhas geradas por uma bomba centrífuga multifásica na 

separação de óleo (petróleo) emulsificado por floculação em linha e flotação em coluna 

Foi desenvolvido um sistema de floculação em linha e flotação em coluna, com alta taxa 

de aplicação superficial (TAS &gt; 10 m h-1), para o tratamento de emulsões oleosas 

sintéticas contendo petróleo bruto (água produzida simulada). A floculação em linha foi 

realizada em um floculador hidráulico serpentinado do tipo Reator Gerador de Flocos 

(RGF®), produto de uma patente desenvolvida no LTM, e foi constituído de etapas de 

mistura rápida e lenta. Esta tecnologia permite a formação de flocos aerados, consistidos 

de gotículas de óleo com bolhas (NBs e MBs) aderidas/aprisionadas. Bolhas foram 

geradas por cavitação hidrodinâmica, utilizando uma bomba centrífuga multifásica e um 

constritor de fluxo tipo válvula agulha, no modelo do Artigo I. A coluna de flotação 

teve altura variável entre 1,5 e 2,5 m.

ABSTRACT 

The importance of nanobubbles is now widely known, particularly their applications 

and potential in mineral processing. The actual challenge is to generate a high 

concentration of bubbles (number per water volume) in a sustainable manner at high 

flow rates. The main objective of this work was to develop a new method for generating 

highly-loaded nanobubbles aqueous solutions by hydrodynamic cavitation using a 

centrifugal multiphase pump (CMP) and a needle valve. Nanobubbles (150-200 nm) 

were formed, at 22°C, with the pump and a recycle column, at various operating 

pressures and air/liquid surface tension. Nanobubbles were resistant to shearing caused 

by pump impellers and to high operating pressures (up to 5 bar) throughout several 

bubble generation cycles. The size of the nanobubbles remained constant, and their 

numeric concentration increased as a function of these cycles, reaching equilibrium after 

29 cycles; this was dependent on pump pressure and the surface tension of the solution. 

The highest concentration (4 x 109 nanobubbles mL-1) was obtained at 5 bar and 49 mN 

m-1 surface tension (air holdup = 6.8% and D32 of microbubbles in the range between 

62 – 70 µm). These phenomena can be explained by Henry's Law and the lower energy 

required for bubble formation when the interfacial tension (air / water) decreases and 

when the differential pressure in the cavitation zone increases. The mean diameter and 

concentration of these nanobubbles did not vary significantly over a period of two 

months, demonstrating the high stability of these concentrated nanobubbles. It is 

concluded that the procedure has great potential in future applications in ore flotation 

and wastewater treatment and reuse.

3.1 INTRODUCTION 

The generation, characterization and application of nanobubbles (NBs) are fast-growing 

research areas. This interest is mainly attributed to important peculiarities of their 

physical, chemical and physicochemical properties. Their technological potential in 

several areas is now recognized, including advanced flotation to remove aqueous 

pollutants and enhance mineral fines values (Ahmadi et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2010a; Fan, 

Zhao, &amp;amp; Tao, 2012; FAN et al., 2010; Sobhy &amp;amp; Tao, 2013).  

The main properties of NBs are their high stability, longevity and rapid adhesion onto 

hydrophobic surfaces. These features have expanded their applications in medicine, 

surface cleaning, mining, energy systems, agriculture, acceleration of metabolism in 

animal and plant species, removal of pollutants and other areas (Agarwal et al., 2011; 

Cavalli et al., 2015; Ebina et al., 2013, US20070286795, 2007, 8945353, 2015; G. Liu 

et al., 2008; S. Liu et al., 2012; Lukianova-Hleb et al., 2014, 2012; Oh, Han, &amp;amp; Kim, 

2015; Polman, 2013). 

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these NBs in the separation of amine 

and sulfate precipitates by dissolved air flotation (DAF) (Amaral Filho et al., 2016; 

Calgaroto et al., 2016). However, more research studies of the procedures for 

quantification and effective generation (higher concentration) are needed, as well as a 

better understanding of their interfacial (air/liquid, solid/liquid, air/air2) and structural 

properties (mainly stability mechanisms).  

The DAF process is a conventional method for treating liquid effluents bearing low 

solids content utilizing microbubbles (MBs – 30-70 µm diameters) and bubbles 

nucleation after passing a flow constrictor (Rafael Teixeira Rodrigues &amp;amp; Rubio, 2007; J. 

Rubio, Carissimi, &amp;amp; Rosa, 2007). The bubbles generation is based on a production of an 

air-saturated water (so called dead-end saturation) whereby the compressed air is 

injected into a pressurized vessel and water flows in counter-current through the vessel, 

dissolving away part of the air (Edzwald &amp;amp; Haarhoff, 2011). An upcoming alternative is 

called open-end saturation, where a centrifugal multiphase pump (CMP) is used for air 

saturation and bubbles generation by hydrodynamic cavitation (André Azevedo, 

Etchepare, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2017; C. H. Lee, An, Kim, Ahn, &amp;amp; Cho, 2007; Pioltine &amp;amp; Reali, 

2011; R. N. Zaneti, Etchepare, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2013). Herein, the atmospheric air is 

continuously injected into the low-pressure suction side of a special CMP, where the 



23 

 

 

shearing effect caused by the pump impellers breaks the air into small bubbles and, as 

the water flows through the system, the high operating pressure and large interfacial 

area of the bubbles enhance the dissolution of air into the water. 

It was recently reported that in the DAF process using saturator vessels, MBs and NBs 

are generated together (Calgaroto et al., 2014a) and a bubble separation technique was 

developed (Calgaroto et al., 2015b). Azevedo et al. (2016) studied the generation of 

NBs in a bench system which consisted of a saturator vessel and a needle valve and 

quantified the concentration of NBs as a function of saturation pressure and liquid 

surface tension. 

This study is a continuation of a series focusing on the generation as highly loaded NBs 

aqueous dispersions, characterization, interfacial properties and stability/lifetime. This 

study was addressed to develop a method of generation and dispersion of air NBs in 

aqueous medium via hydrodynamic cavitation. A CMP was employed to generate air 

NBs and MBs in a semi-continuous system. Air NBs were characterized in terms of 

size, size distribution, concentration and stability, and the effects of generation cycles, 

air/liquid superficial tension, pump operational pressure and air injection were 

evaluated. Gas dispersion parameters as MBs size and air holdup were measured and 

calculated, respectively, at various operational conditions.  

3.2 EXPERIMENTAL 

Materials 

Deionized (DI) water at room temperature (22°C ± 1) with a conductivity of 3 µS•cm-1, 

a surface tension of 72.5 ± 0.1 mN m-1 and pH 5.5 was used to prepare NBs aqueous 

dispersions. DI water was obtained by ultrapurification of tap water with a reverse-

osmosis cartridge and modules of ion-exchange resins and activated carbon. 

A sulfochromic solution was used to remove any organic compounds from all glass 

materials, then rinsing with abundant DI water. NaOH and HCl solutions from Vetec® 

(Rio de Janeiro - RJ, Brazil) were used for pH adjustments. 

?-Terpineol (supplied by Química Maragno; Turvo – SC, Brazil) (CH3 – C6H9 – (OH) – 

C3H5.), a 154 g mol
-1 molecular weight commercial terpene alcohol, was used to reduce 

the water surface tension. 

Methods 



24 

 

 

3.2.1 Nanobubbles generation system 

Bubbles were generated in a semi-continuous system with a recycle column associated 

with a CMP as illustrated in Figure 1. The column, made of acrylic resin, had an 

internal diameter of 10 cm and 240 cm height. The main components of the bubble 

generation system were the stainless steel CMP (Nikuni, KTM20ND) and a needle 

valve with fine adjustment (Parker, N800, 1/2”). Atmospheric air was injected into the 

pump by vacuum pressure at a controlled flow with the aid of an air rotameter and 

sheared by pump impellers, resulting in an air/liquid mixture. The multiphasic flow was 

subjected to various operating pressures to dissolve air in water in a pressure tank 

(stainless steel); the saturated water was forced through the needle valve and injected 

into the base of the column for bubble generation.  

The NBs generation system was operated by recirculation of a fixed volume of 40 L of 

DI water (or ?-Terpineol solution) at a flow rate of 1,000 L h-1. The superficial liquid 

velocity in the column was 0.035 m s-1, and the residence time in the system was 

approximately 2.1 min. A PVC feed-water tank was equipped with a heat exchanger 

(cooling coil in stainless steel), and the water temperature in the system was controlled 

and adjusted to 22°C by circulation of refrigerated fluid (Maqtermo®, LS 03 AR 

CF/220/GE).  

Before the tests, the equipment was cleaned by circulating the sulfochromic acid 

solution for 5 min, followed by DI water rinsing for 10 min (three times). In the last 

cleaning procedure, the water conductivity and particle concentration were measured to 

ensure the absence of ions (maximum conductivity of 3 µS.cm-1) and nanoparticles 

(below the detection limit of the NTA analysis – see description in the next item, 105 

particles.mL-1).

3.2.2 Nanobubbles characterization  

Concentration, mean size and size distribution of NBs were measured in a nanoparticle 

tracking analysis (NTA) instrument (ZetaView®, Particle Metrix, Germany) at room 



26 

 

 

temperature. ZetaView® is equipped with a built-in cell and a laser diffraction 

microscope with a video camera (CCD) to capture the motion of particles/bubbles. 

The NTA technique explores light scattering and Brownian motion to obtain 

distribution size data for nanoparticles. A laser beam (525 nm) passes through the 

nanoparticles and is scattered, resulting in a compressed beam with a reduced profile 

and high power density. The suspended particles in the path of this beam scatter light 

are, visualized with the objective lens of the microscope. Then, a video camera captures 

particles within the field of the cell view.  

ZetaView (version 8.02.30.02) records a video file of individual particles and 

simultaneously identifies and tracks the center of each particle frame by frame. The 

software determines the average distance moved by each particle in the x and y 

directions to determine the particle diffusion coefficient (Dt). The sample temperature 

(T) and solvent viscosity are measured and calculated, respectively, and the sphere-

equivalent hydrodynamic diameter (d) of the bubbles can be measured using the Stokes-

Einstein equation (Eq. 1).  

 ?? =

3???
                                                                                              (1) 

Because the optical field of view is fixed and the depth of the illuminating beam is 

approximately 10 µm, the scattering volume can be estimated. By counting the bubbles 

within the field of view, it is possible to extrapolate this figure to an equivalent 

estimated value for concentration in terms of bubbles per mL.  

For sample conditioning, a bubble separation procedure was conducted exploiting the 

fact that MBs rise and collapse at the liquid surface, while NBs remain in suspension for 

long periods (Calgaroto et al., 2015b). The samples containing NBs dispersions were 

carefully injected into the NTA cell using a sterile glass syringe (5 mL capacity) until 

the liquid reached the tip of the nozzle.  

The obtained values of mean size, size distribution and number of NBs are the 

arithmetically calculated values for three measurements of each sample. The range of 

particle size measurement is from 10 nm to 3 µm, and the particle concentration vary 

from 105 to 1010 particles per mL.  



27 

 

 

3.2.3 Effect of operating pressure and water surface tension on NBs size and 

concentration 

The NBs concentration and size were investigated in triplicate tests at different 

operating pressures (2.5 – 5 bar) and surface tension values. The air/water surface 

tension was modified with a 100 mgL-1 ?-Terpineol solution. The surface tension was 

determined at room temperature on a Kruss® tensiometer (Model 8451) using the 

DuNouy static method with a platinum ring. 

3.2.4 Effect of NBs generation cycles on NBs size and concentration 

Trials were conducted by recirculating water in the system up to 3 h to assess the effect 

of the continuous generation cycles of NBs. Each cycle corresponds to one residence 

time, equivalent to the total water volume pumped through the column overcoming the 

storage capacity of the system (40 L). Thus, samples were collected at various time 

intervals to determine size and concentration of NBs. Two different experiments were 

performed for each CMP operating with and without air injection) and surface tension.  

3.2.5 Microbubbles and air holdup measurements 

The MBs size distribution was measured using the LTM B-Sizer technique (R. T. 

Rodrigues &amp;amp; Rubio, 2003). This technique basically consists of MBs sampling within 

the flotation column (central spine) using a steel sampler tube. These samples were 

displayed in the glass horizontal display of a "cuvette cell", and digital images were 

obtained with the aid of a digital camera coupled to a microscope.  

Captured images were processed using MATLAB® image analysis software. To analyze 

images generated from the LTM-BSizer and data generation (D32 calculation 

technique), a MATLAB? version 5.3.0.10183 (R11) script was used. For each result 

obtained, 30 images were analyzed.  

At low surface tensions, when the concentration of MBs is high the bubbles overlap 

each other in the “cuvette cell”, making difficult the sampling somewhat by the 

software; this increased the standard deviation of the D32 readings. To avoid this issue,  

a large number of images were considered and after qualitative analysis, the best ones 

were worked out with the software. 

The air holdup (volume fraction of air bubbles in the water column) was calculated by 

measuring the pressure difference (?p) between two points of the column filled with 



28 

 

 

water and bubbles using two hydrostatic pressure sensors (Pressure Transmitter SP98, 

Sitron®) calibrated to a pressure range from 0 to 0.15 bar and positioned in the column 

with 80 cm between them (Figure 1). A ?P0 (blank) was first measured using DI water 

without generating bubbles, so the decrease in the hydrostatic pressure after bubbles  

generation corresponds to the fraction of air bubbles injected in the system and the 

following equation 2 (Matiolo, Testa, Yianatos, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2011) was used to calculate 

the air holdup.

where

3.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Figures 2 and 3 show the effect of generation cycles on the average diameter of NBs 

which remained almost constant along the cycles, between 200 and 250 nm with a size 

distribution of 50-400 nm, indicating a low degree of NBs coalescence in this pump.

saturation pressures. Liquid flow rate = 1000 L h-1; air/liquid ratio = 7.5%; ?-[Terpineol] = 100 mg

The effect of operating pressure and the number of generation cycles on the 

concentration of NBs is shown in Figures 4 and 5. Herein, the NBs showed to be 

resistant to the shearing effect of the pump impellers and to high pressure during the 

several generation cycles (and air-saturation in water), increasing the concentration with 

the operating pressure and cycles. These results are close to those reported by Rodrigues 

and Rubio (2003) during MBs generation, explained by the Henry´s Law. Thus, with 

increasing pressure, more air is dissolved; consequently, more cavities are formed, and 

more bubbles are generated when flow is depressurized through the needle valve. The 

increase in pressure upstream of the constriction device (needle valve) results in a 

higher-energy dissipation rate and a higher collapse pressure (Gogate and Pandit, 2000). 

Thus, an optimum inlet pressure should be ensured at a constant flow rate.  

The highest NBs concentration in DI water (72.5 mN m-1 surface tension) was obtained 

after 29 cycles (61 min), with values reaching 1.5 x 108 NBs mL-1 at a Psat of 4-5 bar. 

Then, the concentration of NBs remained constant. This is due to an equilibrium 

condition, between the air dissolved in water (at a supersaturated condition) and the 

NBs formed and stabilized in solution. Under this condition, the air available for NBs

generation is completely diffused into the cavities and gas nuclei available; after this 

critical period, the generation of NBs ceased. 

Figures 12 and 13 also show that the concentration of NBs in ?-terpineol (50 mN m-1 

the air/liquid interfacial tension) was approximately 25 times higher than that obtained 

using DI water, reaching a maximum value of 4 x 109 NBs mL-1 after 29 cycles with a 

Psat of 5 bar. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in the generation of MBs 

(Rodrigues and Rubio, 2003) and is explained in terms of the minimum energy required 

for bubble formation (T. Takahashi, Miyahara, &amp;amp; Mochizuki, 1979), which is lower 

when reducing the surface tension (Equation 3).

where ? is the surface tension of the liquid, and Po is the atmospheric pressure. 

The enhancement of the number of NBs in the presence of surfactant may also be 

attributed to interfacial phenomena. According to Klassen and Mokrousov, (1963), Wu, 

(1969) and Zhou, (1996), the stabilization of cavities and gas nuclei after the adsorption 

of surfactant at the air/liquid interface provides mechanical strength to resist pressure 

fluctuations. The presence of surfactants also reduces the intensity of bubble bursts as 

reported by Gogate and Pandit (2001).

Table 1 summarizes data on the effect of the operating pressure on NBs formation with 

a multiphase pump.  Results show that contrary to the NBs generation by 

depressurization of air-saturated water from saturator vessel in a needle valve (A. 

Azevedo et al., 2016), the concentration of NBs is directly proportional to saturation 

pressure (Psat).  

In air-in water-saturators-flow constrictors, interactions occurred between MBs and NBs 

leading to coalescence and/or entrapment highly reducing the concentration of NBs.

These bubble interactions do not appear to occur while the continuous generation of 

NBs by CMP. Here, the use of operating pressures &gt; 3 bar resulted in a higher 

population of NBs and MBs, the latter evidenced in photographs of bubbles in Figure 16 

and by the air holdup values (Figure 17). 

Additional mechanisms to enhance the ratio of NBs / MBs by hydrodynamic cavitation 

in CMP´s appear to be the following: 

i. Hydrodynamic cavitation by mechanical agitation. The movement of the 

pump impellers and the pressure distribution in the vane region create high 

and low pressure areas in the periphery and inner impellers. This results in 

pressure gradients and formation of cavities in the low pressure zones 

(Brennen, 1995; Grainer-Allen, 1970; Zhou, Xu, Finch, Masliyah, &amp;amp; Chow, 

2009); 

ii. Hydrodynamic cavitation by axial flow shearing. The liquid flow (or gas-

liquid mixture) is split (divided) into several spiral rotating vortexes, moving 

along a special chamber and the discharge piping from the pump. This 

rotational movement is maintained until the kinetic energy is depleted, 

producing an intense shear through respective centrifugal forces, triggering 

nucleation and gas bubble formation by pressure fluctuation (Brennen, 1994, 

1995; Hua, Falcone, Teodoriu, &amp;amp; Morrison, 2012);  

iii. Hydrodynamic cavitation through depressurized flow constriction. When the 

supersaturated liquid is forced through the needle valve, the pressure is 

reduced below the vapor pressure of the liquid, and cavities consequently 

form and partially collapse when the pressure values  reset at the device

Finch, Hu, &amp;amp; Rao, 1997; Zhou et al., 2009).  

These mechanisms explain some results found here, showing that the concentration of 

NBs increases when the pump is operated without injection of air (Figures 6 and 7) 

Under these conditions, the number of formed NBs was obviously lower than the values 

observed with air injection inside the pump. The main reason for this behavior is the 

difference in the quantity of air dissolved under these conditions (supersaturation x 

ambient pressure). The number of NBs is higher when the generated cavities are 

stabilized by diffusion of more dissolved air into these cavities (Zhou et al., 2009).

In summary, by utilizing these three phase pumps, all generation phenomena occurred 

simultaneously, resulting in the formation of highly loaded NBs aqueous dispersions. 

This information is important because the concentration of NBs formed by different 

techniques are scarce in the literature, especially at high flow rates (if published!). 

Liu et al. (2013) reported a value of 1.97 x 108 NBs mL-1,  Oh et al. (2015) 2.8 x 108 

NBs mL-1; and Ohgaki et al. (2010) 1.9 x 1013 NBs mL-1. Yet, in the work of Liu et al. 

(2013), the method of generation of NBs was not described; in the work of Oh et al. 

(2015) the gas phase was hydrogen in gasoline in a gas-liquid dispersion and the 

bubbles formed after passing a membrane module. Ohgaki et al. (2010) used scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM) to measure the concentration of NBs, but the size 

distribution of NBs was not published. This technique is considered an indirect and 

imprecise, which may lead to measurements with little consistency. The reported values 

are about 100 thousand-fold higher than those reported in the present work! 

Figure 9 shows the concentration of NBs and the air holdup values as a function of the 

operating pressure for the same number of generation cycles. The results showed that 

the air holdup values, and number of MBs follow the same tendency of increase 

observed for the concentration of NBs. The highest holdup value observed (6.8%) was 

obtained at 4-5 bar, where the concentration of NBs was close to 4 x 109 NBs mL-1 (see 

also the photographs of the MBs in Figure 8). The D32 of the air MBs formed were 

constant in the range between 62-70 ?m, similarly to those values obtained by 

Rodrigues (2004), who employed a multiphase pump (Edur®) for the MBs generation.

surface tension = 50 ± 1 mN.m-1. 

 

The existence of Bulk NBs and their stability when dispersed in aqueous solutions are 

being fully studied, constitutes an exciting research theme, with many authors 

discussing the theories and mechanisms to explain their peculiar properties (A. Azevedo 

et al., 2016; S. Liu et al., 2013; Seddon, Lohse, Ducker, &amp;amp; Craig, 2012; Ushikubo et al., 

2010; Weijs, Seddon, &amp;amp; Lohse, 2012; Zhang &amp;amp; Seddon, 2016). Figures 10 and 11 show 

data on the evolution of D32 and concentration of NBs over 60 days. The results 

validated the high stability and longevity observed by many authors, for these bubbles 

when dispersed in water. Hence, not only the size but also the number of NBs showed 

small variations during the full storage period. These results are consistent with results 

obtained by other authors, showing that NBs are stable for days or even months (Oh et 

al., 2015; Ohgaki et al., 2010; Ushikubo et al., 2010). The D32 values of the NBs 

generated in an ?-terpineol solution were slightly lower than those for NBs generated in 

DI water, probably by repulsion interfacial forces which might lead to some coalescence 

during storage. 

Moreover, in air-saturated /microsolid-free liquids, as in the present work, these NBs 

are remarkably stable probably due to (among others) the following phenomena: i. 

Absence or minimum rising rate of ascent of NBs; ii. Balance of double layer repulsive 

Pressure, bar

and hydrophobic attractive forces; iii. The degree of metastability achieved as a function 

of the high concentration of NBs, which prevents the diffusive flow of gas molecules 

from inside the NBs to the liquid (Creux, Lachaise, Graciaa, &amp;amp; Beattie, 2007; Henry, 

Parkinson, Ralston, &amp;amp; Craig, 2008; Seddon et al., 2012; Weijs et al., 2012).

3.4 FINAL REMARKS 

Although residence times in multiphase pumps generally are lower than that using 

saturation vessels, the mechanism of hydrodynamic cavitation operating in the various 

zones of the pump allowed to form higher NBs concentrations compared with the 

results obtained with saturator vessel (A. Azevedo et al., 2016).  

Advantages for sustainable bubbles generation with CMP include:  

i. Higher volumetric efficiency, providing a large mass of air per unit volume 

of recirculation;  

ii. Elimination of saturation chambers and; 

iii. Air may be supplied from the atmosphere rather than by an air compression 

unit (Ross, Smith, &amp;amp; Valentine, 2000).  

It is believed that these kinds of pumps (Edur, 2017; Hellbender, 2017, Nikuni, 2017), 

with special suction chambers for air injection and cavitation, have a high potential for 

generating MBs and NBs and for future applications, at high flow-rates. Main areas are:

In mineral flotation the NBs are believed to improve the aggregation and 

hydrophobization of solids and enhance the recovery of organic and inorganic particles. 

More, a new generation of DAF units may be possible maximising the formation and/or 

injection of the NBs. Figures 12 and 13 depict some alternatives for “multi-bubble”

3.5 CONCLUSIONS 

The results suggest that centrifugal multiphase pumps (CMP) have a great potential for 

bulk nanobubbles generation at high rate, reaching a maximum nanobubbles 

concentration (4.1 x109 nanobubbles mL-1) after approximately 29 operation cycles 

(residence time = 2.1 min). This optimum condition was obtained at 4-5 bar and low 

liquid/air surface tension (49 mN m-1). The bulk nanobubbles dispersions were stable 

for over 60 days, with no decrease in nanobubbles concentration and mean size, proving 

the high stability and longevity of these bubbles aqueous dispersions. Nanobubbles 

were resistant to the shearing effect of the pump impellers and to the high pressure 

during the several generation cycles. Yet, the air holdup reached 6.8% operating at 5 bar 

in a ?-terpineol solution (surface tension = 49 mN m-1). It is believed that the results 

will broaden the applications of the CMP for bubble generation in flotation either in 



41 

 

 

mineral processing or in the environmental area, and/or in many other technological 

areas exploring the physicochemical properties and features of nanobubbles.

Abstract 

This work investigates the separation of emulsified crude oil in saline water (30 g L-1 

NaCl) with microbubbles (MBs, D32 = 30-40 µm) and nanobubbles (NBs, D32 = 150-

350 nm). Bubbles were generated simultaneously by the depressurization of air-

saturated water through a flow constrictor (needle valve). The emulsified oil, after 

gravity separation of the "free" oil, was flocculated with a cationic polyacrylamide 

(Dismulgan) at pH 7 and removed by: i. Flotation with MBs and NBs; ii. “Floatation” 

by NBs; and iii. Flotation with MBs and NBs following floc conditioning by NBs. The 

best oil removal (&gt; 99% efficiency) was obtained at 5 bar and 5 mg L-1 of Dismulgan, 

reducing the oil content (feed concentration = 334-484 mg L-1 ) in the treated water to &amp;lt;

1 mg L-1. Furthermore, the use of low saturation pressure (Psat = 3.5 bar), resulted in a 

treated water with oil concentrations lower than 29 mg L-1 (EPA standards for offshore 

discharge). Best results were obtained at a low energy for bubble formation, followed 

by efficient precipitation and nucleation, at a fairly low air/feed emulsified oil 

interfacial tension (55 mN m-1). The flotation was very fast and followed a first-order 

model, with a flotation kinetic constant of 1.3 and 1.8 min-1 for Psat of 3.5 and 5 bar, 

respectively. The injection of isolated NBs (3x108 NBs mL-1), in a conditioning stage 

after flocculation (with 1 and 3 mg L-1 Dismulgan) increased the hydrophobicity of the 

aggregates, improved the adhesion between bubbles and oily flocs and the overall 

efficiency of the flotation process from 73 to 84%, and from 92 to 95%, respectively. 

“Floatation” (simply flocs rising with isolated NBs) resulted in oil removal efficiencies 

of 75 and 90% with and without NaCl (30 g L-1). It is believed that the NBs entrap and 

adhere inside the flocculated oil droplets, forming aerated oily flocs, which 

subsequently assist the MBs in the flotation process. This finding appears to have 

potential in improving oil separation by flotation.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 

Flotation is extensively employed in the removal of emulsified oils from aqueous 

dispersions, after destabilization by flocculation. The size distribution of bubbles and oil 

droplets plays a key role in flotation efficiency. Small bubbles are preferred because of 

their large surface areas, which are shown to be very useful in the aggregation of 

droplets (Santander et al., 2011; Saththasivam et al., 2016). Conversely, larger bubbles 

tend to rise rapidly, which results in lower collision efficiency. The adhesion between 

bubble and oil droplet is another key factor for flotation efficiency. The formation of 

stable bubble-droplets aggregates depends on a number of factors, such as the ratio of 

bubble / droplet size, their numeric concentration, salinity, oil viscosity, fluid velocity 

and turbulence. Among these factors, the gas dispersion parameters are considered the 

most important in oil-water separation (Rawlins, 2009).   

Produced water is wastewater generated in petroleum prospecting that is composed of a 

mixture of water from wells and process water (Gabardo, Platte, Araujo, &amp;amp; Pulgatti, 

2011; NSC, 2002; Veil, Puder, Elcock, &amp;amp; Redweik, 2004). Flotation is usually applied 

in its treatment at offshore platforms (Fakhru’l-Razi et al., 2009), and the effluent 

should meet the emission limit (EPA Oil and Gas Effluent Guidelines (EPA, 1979)) of 

29 mg L-1 total oil concentration average for monthly and 42 mg L-1 for daily maximum 

for offshore disposal. 

Recent studies have found that in dissolved air flotation (DAF) microbubbles (MBs) 

and nanobubbles (NBs) are formed (A. Azevedo et al., 2016; Calgaroto et al., 2014a). 

The generation and applications of NBs are an emerging and fast-growing research area 

because of their physical, chemical and physicochemical properties. 

Reports and news about flotation with NBs to remove pollutants from waters and 

wastewaters are scarce. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of these fine 

bubbles in solid-liquid separation and mineral treatment (Calgaroto et al., 2016; Fan et 

al., 2010a, 2010b, 2010c; FAN et al., 2010). Recently, the removal of amine and sulfate 

precipitates from aqueous solutions using isolated NBs (F-NBs) and DAF assisted by 

NBs were studied (Amaral Filho, Azevedo, Etchepare, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2016; Calgaroto et al., 

2016). The DAF assisted by NBs consists in the injection of an aqueous dispersion of 



45 

 

 

NBs in a conditioning stage (with or without flocculants) promoting aggregation and 

hydrophobization of the particles to be removed.  

It is believed that NBs may play an important role in the aggregation and stabilization of 

these aggregates (flocs) by adhering to and/or entraining inside (entrapment) the flocs, 

generating capillary bridges between oil droplets, and improving their hydrophobicity 

and the probability of adhesion with MBs (Calgaroto, Azevedo, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2015b; 

Calgaroto et al., 2016). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of NBs on various 

multi-bubble flotation configurations: MBs and NBs, DAF assisted by NBs, and 

“floatation” (flotation without lifting power) with isolated NBs (F-NBs), on the removal 

of emulsified oil after destabilization / flocculation at the bench level.  

 

4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

4.2.1 Synthetic produced water 

Ultrapure (DI) water at room temperature (22°C ± 1) with a conductivity of 3 ?S cm-1, a 

surface tension of 72.5 ± 0.1 mN m-1 and pH 5.5 was used to prepare the synthetic 

produced water. DI water was obtained by ultrapurification of tap water with a reverse 

osmosis cartridge and modules of ion-exchange resins and activated carbon. 

 

The petroleum (crude oil) used in this study was supplied by a local oil refinery 

(REFAP, Petrobras, southern Brazil). This oil was characterized in terms of its 

physicochemical and interfacial properties (Table 2).

API Grade (ºAPI) 23 

Viscosity, 25º C (cP) 42 

Superficial tension (oil/water), 25º C (mN m-1) 28 

 

The brine solution for synthetic produced water was made by dissolving 30 g L-1 of 

NaCl (99.5%, Vetec®, Brazil) into 1 L of DI water. Then, 1.6 g of crude oil was slowly 

dripped into the brine solution for emulsification with an Ultra Turrax mixer (IKA, 

24,000 rpm, 10 min). The emulsion was left to stand in an acrylic column for 1h for the 

separation of the free oil phase to obtain a well stabilized oil-in-water emulsion. 



46 

 

 

Solutions of 0.1 M NaOH (Vetec®, Brazil) were prepared for pH adjustment in the 

destabilization/flocculation stage. 

The destabilization and flocculation of the emulsion was conducted using Dismulgan 

V3377 (Clariant®, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) (1 to 10 mg L-1), a flocculation polymer 

(polyacrylamide) widely used on offshore petroleum platforms.  

4.2.2 Flocculation-flotation studies for oil/water separation 

The experiments were performed using the system shown in Figure 1, which consisted 

of: i. saturator vessel made of acrylic (1) for bubble generation (2.5 L, h = 400 mm, 

diameter = 110 mm, equipped with a manometer and a needle valve); ii. a glass column 

(2) for the separation of MBs (2 L, h = 250 mm, diameter = 100 mm) using the 

technique described by Calgaroto et al. (Calgaroto et al., 2015b, 2014b); and iii. a glass 

column (3)  for the flocculation and flotation stages (2.5 L, h = 330 mm, diameter = 100 

mm) and a mechanical stirrer Fisatom® brand (model 713D). 

The glass column (2) had one input receiving the depressurized flow (MBs and NBs) 

from the saturator vessel and one output connected to the glass column (3), to inject the 

isolated NBs. With flotation by MBs and NBs together, the glass column (2) was not 

employed.  

Figure 14 shows a schematic representation of the bench system for generation and 

treatment of oily emulsion by flocculation-flotation with MBs and NBs.

Turrax emulsifier for oil in water mixture.  

 

4.2.3 Flotation with MBs and NBs  

The bubbles formed by depressurization and hydrodynamic cavitation of the flow of air 

saturated water through the needle valve were injected directly into the glass column (3) 

(without separation of MBs and NBs). To perform the tests, a volume of 800 mL o f the 

oily emulsion was transferred to the glass column (3). Flocculation was performed using 

rapid mixing stages (1 min, G = 2,400 s-1), followed by slow mixing (5 min, G = 30 s-1) 

by the use of the mechanical agitator.  

The effect of the saturation pressure (Psat) on the oil removal was observed between 2.5 

and 6 bar by injecting compressed air and adjusting the relief valve in the saturator 

vessel over 30 min. Flotation was performed with 200 mL of bubble suspension into the 

flotation cell, corresponding to a recycle ratio of 25%.  

Aliquots of 100 mL were collected for oil concentration analysis after 1 h of separation 

of the free oil phase, and from the clarified liquid (treated water) after 5 min of flotation. 

All experimental assays were performed in triplicate and the results were analyzed in 

terms of oil removal efficiency (%), according to Equation 1. 

Efficiency (%) = 100 -

(1)  

where, Cf  is the final oil concentration; F is the dilution factor (1.2) corresponding to 

the volume (200 mL) of saturated water injected; C0 is the initial oil concentration. 

The air/oil ratio (Equation 2) was calculated using the theoretical calculation of air 

saturation in water (Henry's Law) and the volume of precipitated air per liter of water 

for different values of Psat calculated by Rodrigues and Rubio (R. T. Rodrigues &amp;amp; 

Rubio, 2003) using a saturation efficiency of 95% in the saturator vessel.

where Coil is the initial oil concentration (mg L

saturated water used (200 mL). 



48 

 

 

The effect of Psat on flotation kinetics was evaluated at a Psat of 3.5 and 5 bar. Treated 

water samples were collected at different flotation times (0 – 300 s) for measuring 

residual oil concentration. The results were expressed in terms of the percentage of oil 

removal (Equation 1) and flotation kinetic parameter data was adjusted to the first-order 

flotation model (Zuñiga, 1935). The flotation kinetic constant k was obtained using 

Equation 3. 

ln (
R?

R?-R
) = kt                                                                                                                           

(3) 

The García-Zuñiga kinetic model of flotation is given by Equation 4. 

R = R?(1-e-kt)                                                                                                                         

(4) 

Where, R is the calculated oil removal (experimental) (%); R? is the removal of oil 

under stationary conditions (theoretical, at t = 300 s) (%); k is the kinetic constant (s-1); t 

is the flotation time (s). 

4.2.4 Flotation assisted by NBs 

The conditioning of the oily flocs with a NBs suspension ahead of flotation was 

evaluated. Two different concentrations of Dismulgan (1 and 3 mg L-1) were employed. 

After flocculation, 800 mL of NBs suspension were added to 800 mL of oily flocs 

suspension for the conditioning of the flocs for 5 min at slow mixing (G = 30 s-1). 

Finally, flotation was done by depressurizing 400 mL of air saturated water in Psat = 5 

bar. Blank experiments were conducted by adding pure deionized water instead of NBs 

suspension in the conditioning stage. All experimental arrays were performed in 

triplicate and the results of oil removal efficiency were obtained using Equation 1. 

4.2.5 Flotation with isolated NBs (F-NBs) 

For the F-NBs, the MBs separation procedure (A. Azevedo et al., 2016; Calgaroto et al., 

2014a) was done in the glass column (2)  and 200 mL of NBs suspension was placed 

into the flotation column. The F-NBs was evaluated with and without the addition of 

NaCl (30 g L-1) in the oily emulsion. Blank experiments were conducted with pure 

deionized water instead of NBs suspension for flotation. All results corresponded to 

triplicate tests and the oil removal efficiencies were obtained using Equation 1. 



49 

 

 

4.2.6 Microscopy imaging 

Optical microphotographs were taken of the different stages of oily emulsion separation by 

flocculation-flotation. An optical microscope Olympus®, model BX41 was employed with  

an objective magnification of 1000X coupled to a high-performance digital microscope 

camera, Olympus DP73 (17.28 megapixel resolution).  

Samples of 100 mL were collected for analysis as follows: i. Oily emulsion, after free 

phase separation; ii. Oily flocs after 5 min of flocculation with Dismulgan; iii. Treated 

water after 5 min of flotation. One drop of each sample was used for visualization under 

the microscope. 

4.2.7 Oil concentration analysis 

The oil concentration in the emulsions and in the treated effluent was determined with 

an oil analyzer (Horiba®, model OCMA-350, Japan). Measurements were based on the 

energy absorption in the infrared spectrum at the wavelength range of 3.5 - 3.6 ?m. 

Thus, the amount of energy absorbed in this range is assumed to be directly proportional 

to the oil concentration of the sample. For the extraction of the oil contained in the 

sample, the solvent poly-trichlorofluoroethylene (S-316, Horiba®) was used. 

4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

4.3.1 Flotation with MBs and NBs  

Figure 15 shows the effect of the Dismulgan concentration on emulsified oil removal 

efficiency by flotation with MBs and NBs. The results showed that oil removal 

increases as a function of the concentration of Dismulgan, and the best treatment 

conditions was obtained with 5 mg L-1. At this reagent concentration, the removal 

efficiency was almost complete (&gt;99%), yielding a residual oil concentration of 1 mg L-

1.  

The role of coagulant-flocculating agents in the destabilization of oil-in-water emulsions 

to promote the coalescence of oil droplets is well discussed in the literature and the 

mechanisms involved are based on van der Waals and hydrophobic forces (Bensadok, 

Belkacem, &amp;amp; Nezzal, 2007; El-Gohary, Tawfik, &amp;amp; Mahmoud, 2010; Karhu, 

Kuokkanen, Kuokkanen, &amp;amp; Rämö, 2012; Tansel &amp;amp; Pascual, 2011; Zouboulis &amp;amp; 

Avranas, 2000). Figure 16 shows microphotographs obtained from the oily emulsion

(after separation of the free oil phase), the flocs formed with Dismulgan and the treated 

water after flotation. 

 

Figure 15. Flocculation-flotation for oil removal with MBs and NBs as a function of Dismulgan 

concentration. Conditions: initial [oil] = 337-484 mg L-1; [NaCl] = 30 g L-1; pH 7; Saturation 

pressure = 5 bar; Saturation time = 30 min; Flotation time = 5 min. The error bars correspond to 

the standard deviation of triplicate tests. 

 

Oil droplets with a diameter greater than 20 ?m are considered available for flotation 

(Moosai &amp;amp; Dawe, 2003), however those of finer sizes (&lt;10 ?m) may not become 

coalesced on the flocs due to Brownian motion (Atarah, 2011). Consequently, this 

process is less efficient if the residence time is low. Therefore, a similar emulsion 

generation technique employed by Santander et al. (Santander et al., 2011) was applied, 

reporting an oil droplet size with a mean Sauter diameter (D32) of 15 ?m, and oil 

droplets with diameter smaller than 10 ?m (Figure 3). Thus, the destabilization of the 

emulsified oil droplets with 5 mg L-1 of Dismulgan and the application of MBs and NBs 

allowed good collision and adhesion of these bubbles to the flocs, reducing the oil 

content to a final concentration of 1 mg L-1 in the treated water.

[Dismulgan] = 5 mg L-1; Psat = 5 bar; Saturation time = 30 min; Recycle rate =  25%; Flotation 

time = 5 min. 

 

 

The effect of Psat on oil removal efficiency is shown in Figure 17. The best results were 

obtained with saturation pressures of 5 and 6 bar, with removal efficiencies &gt; 99% and a 

mean residual oil concentration of less than 2 mg L-1. It was also observed that the non-

flocculated oil droplets did not float properly, leading to an unsatisfactory oil removal 

efficiency (&lt;70% and a residual concentration &gt;100 mg L-1).  

More, in terms of residual oil concentration and practical aspects, the results showed 

that with a Psat of 3.5 bar the removal efficiency was about 93%. As shown in Table 3 

and Figure 18, the residual oil concentration obtained was below the EPA Oil and Gas 

Effluent Guidelines (EPA, 1979) for monthly average emission limit for offshore waters 

(29 mg L-1), proving the potential of the flotation process with MBs and NBs with low 

saturation pressures (meaning less energy consumption).

Figure 19 shows the flotation kinetics at saturation pressures of 3.5 and 5 bar. The best results 

were obtained at higher saturation pressures. This fact may be explained in terms of the higher air / 

oil ratio (higher collision efficiency) obtained with 5 bar (0.06 mL mg-1) compared to 3.5 bar (0.04 

mL mg-1). The flotation with both saturation pressures was relatively fast, with stabilization of the 

oil removal efficiency after 3 min. This flotation followed a first-order model with a flotation 

kinetic constant of 1.3 and 1.8 min-1 for Psat of 3.5 and 5 bar, respectively. Table 4 summarizes 

the experimental and calculated oil removal data and corresponding correlation coefficients.

4.3.2 Flotation assisted by NBs  

Figure 20 and Table 5 show the results of flotation assisted by NBs. It was observed 

that, in comparison to the flotation process, the inclusion of the floc conditioning step 

with NBs promoted an improvement in the overall oil removal. The NBs appear to 

interact with the (hydrophobic) oil droplets, aggregating them and forming aerated 

precipitates, a phenomena already reported in literature (Attard, 2003; Calgaroto et al., 

2015b, 2016; Hampton &amp;amp; Nguyen, 2009; Schubert, 2005).  

Mishchuk (Mishchuk, 2005) carried out a theoretical analysis on the attractive forces in 

a particulate system in the presence of NBs and concluded that these ultra-fine bubbles 

adhered to the particles, reducing the local density of the solid-liquid interface. They 

also modify the absolute value of van der Waals forces, improving the degree of 

aggregation by increasing the attraction between these particles. Moreover, the study by 

Stöckelhuber et al. (Klaus Werner Stöckelhuber, Boryan Radoev, Andreas Wenger, &amp;amp; 

Schulze†, 2003) demonstrated that NBs cause the rupture of the liquid film between a 

bubble and a hydrophobic surface without the introduction of a hydrophobic force 

mechanism. These authors have found that the repulsive DLVO forces in this liquid 

film are overlaid by waves of capillary forces that deform the surface of this film. These 

mechanisms may explain the results where the NBs facilitated the adhesion between 

bubbles and oily flocs, increasing the overall efficiency of the flotation process.

4.3.3 Floatation with isolated NBs (F-NBs) 

Figure 21 shows the results of the floatation conducted with isolated NBs (F-NBs). The 

residual oil concentrations in the treated water were 34 mg L-1 (without  NaCl) and 80 

mg L-1 (with NaCl 30 g L-1), and oil removal efficiency reached an equilibrium (90% 

and 75%, respectively), after 10 min of flotation. The results indicated that the NBs 

contribute to the rising of these aggregates. The NBs, once adhered, occluded and/or 

entrapped them at the solid/liquid interface, decreasing the relative density of these flo cs 

and also increased their hydrophobicity.  

Yet, these results indicate a slightly lower oil removal efficiency of floatation with 

isolated NBs with NaCl 30g L-1 rather than a solution without salt. These results are 

probably due to the lower concentration of NBs obtained under these conditions (7.1 x 

107 NBs mL-1, Psat = 2.5 bar) when compared to NBs formed in DI water (3.3 x 108 

NBs mL-1; Psat = 2.5 bar), which validates and reinforces the role of NBs in the 

separation of these oily aggregates. The F-NBs has already been observed in previous 

studies of this research group, in the flotation of amine precipitate (Calgaroto et al., 

2016) and ferric hydroxide (R. Etchepare, Azevedo, Calgaroto, &amp;amp; Rubio, 2017). 

However, this seems to be the first report in the literature of flocculation / NBs 

floatation for the treatment of emulsified oil.

Saturation pressure = 2.5 bar; Saturation time = 30 min; Recycle rate = 25%. The initial oil 

corresponds to the oil concentration after the phase separation step. The error bars correspond to 

the standard deviation of the triplicate tests. 

 

4.4  CONCLUSION 

Flocculation with 5 mg L-1 of Dismulgan at pH 7, followed by flotation (Psat of 5 bar) 

with MBs and NBs showed an oil removal efficiency higher than 99%, yielding a 

residual oil content of 1 mg L-1. The use of a Psat of 3.5 bar gave a treated water with a 

residual oil concentration lower than the emission limit (29 mg L-1) of oily produced 

water on offshore oil platforms. The flotation followed a first-order model with a kinetic 

constant of 1.3 and 1.8 min-1 at Psat of 3.5 and 5 bar, respectively. A NBs conditioning 

stage after the flocculation with 1 mg L-1 of Dismulgan resulted in an increase in 

flotation efficiency from 73 to 84%. Floatation of the oily flocs with isolated NBs 

resulted in oil removal efficiencies of up to 90%. The results clearly demonstrated the 

high potential and the role of NBs in the overall oil removal efficiency in the treatment 

of these wastewaters.

Abstract 

The flocculation-column flotation with hydraulic loading (HL &gt;10 m h-1) was studied 

for the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions containing 70 – 400 mg L-1 (turbidity = 70 - 

226 NTU) of oil and salinity (30 and 100 g L-1). A polyacrylamide (Dismulgan - 20 mg 

L-1)  flocculated the oil droplets, using two floc generator reactor (FGR®), with rapid 

and slow mixing stages (head loss = 0.9 to 3.5 bar). Flotation was conducted in two 

cells (1.5 and 2.5 m) with microbubbles (MBs, 5-80 µm) and nanobubbles (NBs, 50 -

300 nm diameter, concentration of 108 NBs mL-1). Bubbles were formed using a 

centrifugal multiphase pump, with optimized parameters and a needle valve. The results 

showed higher efficiency with the taller column reducing the residual oil content to 4 

mg L-1 and turbidity to 7 NTU. At high HL (27.5 m h-1), the residual oil concentrations 

were below the standard emission (29 mg L-1), reaching to 18 mg L-1. The best results 

were obtained with high concentration of NBs (apart from the bigger bubbles). 

Mechanisms involved appear to be attachment and entrapment of the NBs onto and 

inside the flocs. Thus, the aggregates were readily captured, by bigger bubbles (mostly 

MBs) aiding shear withstanding. Advantages are the small footprint of the cells, low 

residence time and high processing rate.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 

Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a solid-liquid separation method widely employed in 

emulsified oily wastewater treatment (Al-Shamrani, James, &amp;amp; Xiao, 2002a, 2002b; J 

Rubio, Souza, &amp;amp; Smith, 2002; Santander et al., 2011; Santo et al., 2012; Saththasivam et 

al., 2016; Zouboulis &amp;amp; Avranas, 2000). The process consists of the rapid 

depressurization of air-saturated water from pressurized tanks for the generation of 

bubbles and subsequent solid/liquid and/or liquid/liquid separation. Recently (A. 

Azevedo et al., 2016; Calgaroto et al., 2014a), the presence of the nanobubbles (NBs) in 

DAF operation was discovered, a fact unknown for years. The role of these NBs in 

flotation, together with microbubbles (MBs) is being studied extensively by our 

research group (Amaral Filho et al., 2016; Azevedo et al., 2017; Calgaroto et al., 2016, 

2015, Etchepare et al., 2017a, 2017b). 

An upcoming and promising alternative for the saturation of air in water in DAF 

applications is open-end saturation (A. Azevedo et al., 2017; Ramiro Etchepare, 2016; 

C. H. Lee et al., 2007; Pioltine &amp;amp; Reali, 2011), so-called flotation with a multiphase 

pump (F-MP), in which air is continuously injected into the low-pressure suction side of 

a special centrifugal multiphase pump (CMP). This unit provides efficient air 

dissolution into the liquid, and a high generation of MBs (30-100 µm) and NBs (100-

850 nm) is attained due to the depressurization of the multiphase flow, the 

hydrodynamic cavitation caused by the flow constrictor and by the shearing effects 

inside the pump chamber impellers.  

Etchepare et al. (2017c) investigated the generation of NBs by a CMP and its operating 

parameters to obtain a high concentration of these bubbles in the F-MP (approximately 

4 x 109 NBs mL-1 at 5 bar). These authors reported that the mechanisms of 

hydrodynamic cavitation inside the pump chamber and downstream of the flow 

constrictors are responsible for a high concentration of NBs in these systems. This 

technique was compared to other methods of NBs generation (Azevedo et al., 2016; Liu 

et al., 2012; Ushikubo et al., 2010; Calgaroto et al., 2014; Azevedo et al., 2017; 

Calgaroto et al., 2016, 2015).  

Recent studies of emulsified oil removal by flotation at bench scale (R. Etchepare, 

Oliveira, Azevedo, et al., 2017; Ramiro Etchepare, 2016) showed an increase in the oil 

removal by conditioning oily aggregates (flocs) with NBs, followed by flotation with 



62 

 

 

MBs. The authors discussed the role of NBs in the oil floatation phenomena, after the 

entrapment of NBs into flocs and a reduction of their relative density. Other studies 

have also demonstrated that NBs improve the aggregation of colloids and fine particles 

and increase the contact angle at the solid/liquid/air interface, which increases the 

probability of flotation due to an improvement in bubble-particle adhesion mechanism 

and stability of these aggregates (Fan et al., 2013).  

Most of the technologies available for petroleum produced water (PW) treatment, such 

as membrane filtration, centrifugation, biological treatment, among others, present 

many limitations regarding operational costs, high footprint (low hydraulic loadings - 

HL) and low efficiency (Fakhru’l-Razi et al., 2009). The most conventional PW 

treatment in offshore platforms consists of a gravimetric separation stage 

(hydrocyclone) followed by flotation (Zheng et al., 2016). The treated effluent must 

meet the emission limit standards determined by many  agencies, namely the EPA 

Effluent Guideline for Oil and Gas extraction (CFR 40.435). For offshore water 

disposal the limit is about 29 mg L-1 of oil for a monthly average and 42 mg L-1 for a 

daily maximum. The PW treatment on offshore platforms presents technical challenges 

due to the limitations of available area, equipment weight and low residence time, 

which usually does not exceed 15 min (Gabardo et al., 2011). Thus, there is a need to 

develop and improve treatment processes with high processing rates, especially in 

compact units that occupy reduced areas (low-footprint).  

Carissimi and Rubio (2005a) developed a helical coiled hydraulic flocculator, a so-

called Flocs Generator Reactor (FGR®). This type of flocculator has been used in 

aerated floc formation by the injection of air bubbles upstream of the reactor and 

presents high processing rates, requires low residence times and a small foot-print area 

for instalation (Carissimi &amp;amp; Rubio, 2005b). Aerated flocs are structures composed of 

flocs and bubbles which are farly light and rapidly rise in flotation systems (Carissimi &amp;amp; 

Rubio, 2005b; Da Rosa &amp;amp; Rubio, 2005; Oliveira &amp;amp; Rubio, 2012; Rafael Teixeira 

Rodrigues &amp;amp; Rubio, 2007). Another important feature of these structures is the high 

shear resistance during turbulent conditions. It is believed that NBs generated at a high 

rate by the CMP may play an important role in aerated floc resistance due to capillary 

forces inside these structures. 



63 

 

 

Column flotation technologies appear as alternatives for high rate DAF utilities in 

offshore platforms. Zaneti et al. (2012, 2011) studied flocculation-column flotation with 

a multiphase pump for the treatment and reuse of vehicle wash wastewater (high 

suspended solids concentrations) and reported the use of HL higher than 20 m h-1. The 

main advantages of column flotation for wastewater treatment are its high throughput 

and flux pattern (plug flow), which allows better contact between bubbles and particles 

and requires lower residence times leading to higher HL (Jorge Rubio &amp;amp; Zaneti, 2009).  

Filippov et al. (2000) reported that by increasing the relation of height/diameter of the 

column in precipitate flotation, the turbulence caused by liquid flow and bubble rising 

movement may be reduced, thereby improving flotation efficiency. 

In this work, MBs and NBs were generated by a CMP feed column with bubbles for oil 

removal in a semi-continuous pilot rig. This process utilized flocculation in a FGR® and 

column flotation for the separation of the oily flocs. The objectives of the study were to 

evaluate the generation of bubbles in a multiphase pump and the influence of operating 

parameters (reagent concentration, column height and hydraulic loading) on oil removal 

efficiency.   

5.2 EXPERIMENTAL  

5.2.1 Materials 

The petroleum (crude oil) was supplied by a local oil refinery (REFAP, Petrobras, 

southern Brazil) and characterized in terms of its physicochemical and interfacial 

properties (Table 6).  

For the generation of the oil-in-water emulsion, tap water and industrial salt (iodine free 

NaCl, Mossoró®, Brazil) were employed.

A commercial cationic polyacrylamide (Dismulgan V3377, Clariant®) was employed 

for oil emulsion destabilization and flocculation after adjusting medium pH at 7 with a 

solution of NaOH 1 % w/w (Vetec®,
 Brazil). 

Oil concentration analyses were performed by spectrometry using a Horiba OCMA-350 

device. Tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4, Sigma Aldrich
®) was used for the extraction of the 

oil from the samples and hydrochloric acid (HCl 5% v/v, Dinâmica Química®) was used 

for pH adjustment. Anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2(SO)4; Sigma Aldrich
®) was 

employed to remove residual humidity from the organic phase. 

Methods 

5.2.2 Oil-in-water emulsion generation system  

The oily emulsion generation system (Figure 22) was composed of: i. A tap water feed 

tank. ii. A helical high-pressure pump (Netzsch, NEMO®); iii. A dosing piston pump 

(OMEL® DMP-02) for inline oil injection; iv. A flow constrictor (needle valve) with 

manometers upstream and downstream of the pipe, and v. An oily emulsion storage tank 

(1 m3) with a centrifugal pump for mixing the salt (Schneider® BCR 2000).  

The process consisted of the injection of crude oil at high pressure through the 

depressurizing needle valve, followed by a pressure drop (12 bar) and high shear caused 

by the passage of the oily-water mixture through the flux constrictor. This procedure 

allowed the formation of a stable oily emulsion with oil contents ranging from 60 to 450 

mg L-1. According to Santander et al. (2011) the oil droplet volumetric mean diameter 

(D32) is inversely proportional to the pressure drop, and the application of 12 bar 

resulted in oil droplets with a D32 of 10 - 15 µm. NaCl (30 to 100 g L
-1) was added into 

the oil wastewater storage tank and dissolved by recirculation with a centrifugal pump.  

Feed oil concentrations (&amp;lt;200 mg.L-1) were obtained by diluting the oily emulsion with 

tap water (1:1).

5.2.3  Bubble generation  

The bubble generation unit consisted of a CMP (Schneider® ME-1315 or ME-1420), 

operating with a pressure of 4 bar and liquid flow varying between 1 and 3 m3 h-1. The 

injection (air/liquid ratio 7.5%) was controlled by an air rotameter (ASA®) positioned in 

the suction line of the CMP, with a vacuum meter gauge (FabrePrimar®). A PVC 

pressure vessel (external diameter = 110 mm, height = 0.95 m), with a pressure gauge 

(NuovaFima®) was employed to relieve the excess air and increase the air in water 

saturation and dissolution time to about 27 s. A needle-type valve was used as a flow 

constrictor for hydrodynamic cavitation and the formation of MBs (5 – 80 µm) and NBs 

(50 – 300 nm). The liquid flow was measured by a liquid rotameter (AppliTech®) 

positioned downstream of the pressure vessel.  

5.2.4  Flocculation  

The flocculation unit was composed of two flocculation units-FGR® (details in Table 2) 

that use the kinetic energy of the liquid flow along the helical tubular reactors. The 

system was composed of a rapid mixing stage (low residence time and high velocity 



66 

 

 

gradient - G) for dispersion of the flocculant and NaOH, and a slow mixing stage (high 

residence time and reduced G) for the formation of stable flocs. 

Bubbles generated upstream of the reactor, adhere to and entrap aggregates, forming 

large aerated flocs with low density. These flocs floated very rapidly (high flotation 

kinetics), similarl to the results published by Oliveira and Rubio (2012). The head loss 

in the system was measured by manometers which were positioned in the inlet and 

outlet of the reactor. Reactants (flocculation polymer and NaOH) were injected by two 

diaphragm-dosing pumps (EXATTA®) located downstream of bubble injection.  

The effect of the flocculation reagent (Dismulgan V 3377) on oil removal by flotation 

was studied in the range of 5 – 30 mg L-1 in duplicate tests. 

5.2.5 Flotation  

The flotation column had a variable height (1.5 and 2.5 m) and a square section with 33 

cm edges (Table 7). The treated water outlet was positioned in the lower third part of 

the column and the sludge removed from the top of the column was disposed of in a 

drying bed that consisted of alternating layers of gravel, coarse and fine sands 

amounting 0.5 m3 the total volume.  

Table 7. Design and operation parameters of the flocculation-flotation units for oily

flotation with CMP are shown in Figures 23 and 24.

where, Cf  is the final oil concentration and C0 is the initial oil concentration.

5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

5.3.1 Effect of the flocculant concentration  

Figure 25 shows the effect of the Dismulgan concentration on oil removal and turbidity 

reduction efficiencies, using a flotation column 1.5 m in height. Best results were 

obtained with a flocculant concentration of 20 mg L-1, wherein the mean residual 

turbidity and oil concentration were 17 NTU and 20 mg L-1, respectively.  

These results are similar to those obtained by Santander et al. (2011), in our research 

group, who flocculated the crude oil emulsion (oil feed &amp;lt;200 mg L-1) with 10 mg L-1 of 

Dismulgan and 3 mg L-1 of a non-ionic polymer (Polyvinyl acetate - PVA) as 

flocculants. In that work, the flocs were then removed from water by a modified "jet" 

flotation process at a high HL (24.7 m h-1), resulting in residual oil contents between 20 

and 30 mg L-1 in the treated water.

Dismulgan concentration on the residual oil and turbidity. Conditions:  pH 7; liquid 

flow = 1 m³ h-1; air/liquid ratio = 7.5% v/v; flotation column height = 1.5 m; HL = 10 m 

h-1; pump pressure = 4 bar; [oil feed] = 400 – 570 mg L-1.  

 

 

5.3.2 Effect of flotation column height 

Figure 26 shows the results obtained with different flotation column heights. Increasing 

from 1.5 m to 2.5 m resulted in higher oil removal efficiency at the same process 

conditions. This effect proved to be more relevant in the treatment of oily emulsions 

with higher initial oil feed (above 200 mg L-1), where the mean residual oil 

concentrations were reduced from 17 mg L-1 to 4 mg L-1, comparing the two column 

heights at a HL of 10 m h-1.

flotation column height. Conditions: pH 7; [Dismulgan] = 20 mg L-1; air/liquid ratio = 

7.5%; HL = 10 m h-1; pump pressure = 4 bar. 

 

Similar results were obtained by da Da Rosa (2002) for emulsified crude oil removal  in 

flotation columns;  higher oil separation efficiency was obtained with taller columns. 

The author explains the results in terms of less overflow of the oily flocs towards the 

treated water outlet, located in the bottom of the column 4.2 m height. 

Filippov et al. (2000) showed that the limiting factor for metal-organic precipitate 

flotation in a column is the level of aggregate stability under the turbulence created by 

the rising bubbles. The hydrodynamic conditions in a 75 mm diameter pilot column 

were optimized by using different bubble spargers to control the air hold up, the gas 

flow rate and the feed flow rate in the column. This led to less turbulence and less 

entrainment of the floating particles. In a tall flotation column, this aggregate breakage 

under turbulence, would certainly be reduced compared to a short cell. 

These results can also be related to studies on column flotation for ore beneficiation. 

Yianatos et al. (1988) observed an improvement in mineral recovery efficiency by 

increasing the column height/diameter (H/D), due to the longer fluid and particle 

residence time in the system that provides a higher probability of collision, adhesion 

and flotation of particle-bubble aggregates.

In this work, with respect to cell design, if the H/D relation increased from 4 to 6.7 for 

the taller column, better oil removal efficiencies were obtained. 

Therefore, results obtained in this work appear to indicate that increasing the distance 

between the floated sludge collection zone and the outlet of treated water is responsible 

for the improvement in the efficiency of oil-water separation, due to reduced drag of 

flocs. 

Table 8 presents the oil concentration and turbidity values of the emulsion and the 

treated effluent, obtained in each experiment assayed, with a 2.5 m column height and 

an HL of 10 m h-1. Additional experiments with higher NaCl concentrations (100 g L-1) 

were conducted.  Excellent separation was obtained, attaining oil contents of 1 mg L-1 in 

the treated water (&gt;99% efficiency). Residual turbidity may be related to the salinity 

that ranged from 30 to 100 g L-1.

5.3.3 Effect of Hydraulic Loading 

Figure 27 shows the results for the different HL studied. Discharge limits of these 

substances in produced water emanating from offshore petroleum plants are usually 



72 

 

 

regulated at a monthly average of 29-34 mg L-1 with a daily maximum of 39-42 mg L-1 

(Rawlins, 2009). Oil and gas production plants in the northeast Atlantic are required to 

meet the 30 mg L-1 oil and grease discharge standards set by Oslo Paris Convention 

(OSPAR) (Atarah, 2011). Herein, residual oil concentration values obtained were below 

the emission standards set by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for Oil 

and Gas Extraction (monthly average = 29 mg L-1) (EPA, 1979) with all the HL lower 

than 27.5 m h-1. 

At HL lower than 18 m h-1, the treated effluent reached a residual oil content less than 

10 mg L-1. Filippov et al. (2000) evaluated the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on 

the stability of colloidal precipitate flotation on the process of column flotation 

(diameter = 75 mm). It was found that with high HL, the breakage of the precipitates by 

shearing forces may occur. Yet, the author showed that decreasing the residence time by 

increasing the superficial velocity of the liquid, these flocs (broken) are more easily 

drawn, decreasing the efficiency of solid/liquid separation. These effects may be related 

to the flotation of oily flocs, explaining the decrease on separation efficiency at high 

HL. The good results obtained with high HL on oil removal appears to be due to the 

high flotation kinetics and the shear resistance of the aerated oily flocs formed in the 

flocculation step.

1; air/liquid ratio = 7.5%; flotation column height = 2.5 m; pump pressure = 4 bar. [Oil 

feed] = 64 – 545 mg L-1 

 

The FGR® presented head-loss (Hf) values from 0.9 to 3.5 kgf cm-2, measured from the 

pressure difference on gauges positioned upstream and downstream of the reactor. Da 

Rosa and Rubio (2005) evaluated different hydraulic flocculators in oily emulsion 

treatment by flocculation-flotation and found that the results obtained do not depend on 

the geometrics of the reactor, but on the Hf provided in the system, obtaining lower oil 

concentrations in the treated water (10-15 mg L-1) when the Hf reached values between 

0.5 and 1.0 kgf cm-2. For higher values of Hf, the oil concentration has not decreased 

significantly.  

5.4 FINAL REMARKS  

The flotation process has been used for many years in the treatment of oily liquid 

effluents (removal of oil and water reuse). In these applications, the reported size and 

size distribution of bubbles have been 40-100 ?m. Yet, the contribution of NBs has been 

ignored and unknown (until recently) to most engineers, researchers and flotation 

professionals, due to the absence and / or lack of knowledge of analytical techniques 

capable of characterizing and identifying NBs. 

Thus, by taking advantage of the upcoming nanotechnology and the development of 

more advanced particle / bubble analysis techniques, our research group was able to 

evaluate the generation of NBs and understand some properties that improve flotation 

efficiency. Notably, the discovery that hydrodynamic cavitation using centrifugal 

multiphase pumps CMP generates a high concentration of these NBs (A. Azevedo et al., 

2017; R. Etchepare, Oliveira, Nicknig, et al., 2017). 

This flocculation-column flotation process, using RGF® for aerated floc formation and 

CMP for MBs and NBs generation, appears to present a great potential for oily 

wastewater treatment. Future applications for pollutant removal at high rates may be 

possible where small areas are required for equipment installation, namely, for 

industrial emulsified oils such as petroleum produced waters from offshore platforms.  

The advantages of this proposed process are:   



74 

 

 

iv. Efficient generation of bubbles with wide size distributions and a high 

concentration  - MBs with a size distribution of 5-80 µm and air hold up in the 

range of 3 - 6 %;  and NBs sizing between 50 -300 nm and a concentration of 

about 109 NBs mL-1 (R. Etchepare, Oliveira, Nicknig, et al., 2017; Ramiro 

Etchepare, 2016); 

v. Continuous generation of oil-bubble clusters (aerated flocs) in the FGR® –floc 

generator reactor; 

vi. A highly efficient separation process with high rates, obtaining low oil contents 

in the treated water; 

vii. Small foot-print area for equipment installation. 

Regarding mechanisms involved, it is believed that NBs entrapped into flocs exert a 

strong bridging force, assisting oil droplet entrapment allowing the action of 

hydrophobic forces. These structures have a strong shear resistance and low density, 

avoiding the breakage and dragging the oil towards the treated water outlet.  

5.5 CONCLUSIONS 

Excellent results removing emulsified crude oil to levels below EPA Standard 

Emissions for offshore disposal (29 mg L-1) were obtained at pilot scale, at high 

hydraulic loading (27.5 m h-1) by flocculation-column flotation with micro and 

nanobubbles. The bubbles were generated by a novel hydrodynamic cavitation method 

using a centrifugal multiphase pump and flocculation was conducted in a FGR®. Two 

sizes of column flotation units were employed (1.5, 2.5 m tall). Best results (high oil 

removal and low residual oil content in the treated water) were attained at a hydraulic 

loading of 10 m h-1 with a flotation column 2.5 m in height, yielding treated water with 

an oil content&amp;lt;5 mg L-1. Results validated the role of the nanobubbles assisting the 

separation process and maximizing the plant treatment capacity. Further advantages are 

the low footprint required and the high efficiency of the pumps generating the 

nanobubbles (4 x 109 NB mL-1; D32 = 150-300 nm). The whole process appears to have 

great potential in the treatment of oily wastewaters.

Este artigo descreve o panorama e evolução da pesquisa de geração e aplicações de 

nanobolhas. Um histórico resumido da pesquisa e desenvolvimento sobre nanobolhas é 

apresentado, assim como o resumo dos efeitos e aplicações nas áreas mineral e 

ambiental. Foram relatadas a pesquisa em nanotecnologia, as produções e descobertas 

científicas e produtos tecnológicos desenvolvidos no LTM (depósito de patente, 

equipamentos para geração e caracterização de dispersões de nanobolhas, sistema piloto 

para FAD com nanobolhas). Foi realizada uma análise sobre o panorama das 

necessidades da pesquisa sobre nanobolhas, visando à transferência da tecnologia para a 

indústria e mercado. 

7 CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

O processo de flotação vem sendo empregado há mais de 100 anos no tratamento de 

minérios (recuperação de espécies minerais de valor) e de efluentes líquidos (remoção 

de poluentes e reuso de água). A diferença nestas aplicações está no tamanho e 

distribuição de tamanho de bolhas gerada; macrobolhas (0,6-2 mm) na flotação de 

minérios e microbolhas (40-100 µm) na flotação (separação) de poluentes (partículas, 

coloides, gotículas). Entretanto, a contribuição das NBs ainda é desconhecida da 

maioria dos engenheiros, pesquisadores e profissionais da área de flotação. Este fato se 

deve principalmente pela ausência e/ou desconhecimento de técnicas analíticas capazes 

de caracterizar e identificar as NBs, até então.  

Nas últimas décadas, houve um avanço significativo da nanotecnologia e o 

desenvolvimento de técnicas de análise de partículas/bolhas mais avançadas, permitiu 

uma melhor compreensão das propriedades destas bolhas. Nos últimos anos, os estudos 

envolvendo a aplicação das NBs no processo de flotação avançaram de forma crescente, 

especialmente no setor mineral e na área ambiental. Com as recentes pesquisas 

publicadas, os efeitos das interações de NBs com sistemas minerais e de nano e micro 

poluentes (orgânicos e inorgânicos) já são conhecidos e comprovados. 

Neste sentido, o desenvolvimento de uma técnica de aplicação de NBs na separação de 

efluentes oleosos emulsificados em alta taxa de aplicação superficial foi uma das 

principais contribuições desta dissertação. Os resultados obtidos apresentaram uma 

maior eficiência do tratamento de óleo em relação aos equipamentos de flotação 

convencionalmente utilizados, e concluiu-se que é possível ampliar a capacidade de 



78 

 

 

tratamento de águas oleosas em plataformas marítimas utilizando uma ampla 

distribuição do tamanho de bolhas geradas por bomba centrífuga multifásica, reduzindo 

o tempo de residência do tratamento e o espaço ocupado pelo sistema de floculação em 

linha e flotação em coluna. 

A flotação com NBs (em conjunto com as MBs ou não) foi bem-sucedida na remoção 

de óleo emulsificado, em escala de bancada e em nível piloto. Os resultados obtidos 

estimulam a utilização destas bolhas no desenvolvimento e aprimoramento de técnicas e 

tecnologias na remoção de dispersões/emulsões oleosas e outros tipos de poluentes; 

entre eles: 

i. Na mineração na remoção de reagentes “coletores” de flotação de minérios 

(xantatos e derivados, aminas, ácidos graxos e íons diversos); 

ii. Na petroquímica e na extração de petróleo no controle da emissão e 

reinjeção de águas produzidas; 

iii. No setor de industrial e de mitigação da poluição aquosa urbana, no 

tratamento de águas de lavagem de carros, caminhões, ônibus, aviões, 

maquinaria industrial pesada; 

iv. Tratamento e remoção de águas contendo micro-poluentes orgânicos 

(emergentes) como fármacos residuais, desreguladores endócrinos, vírus, 

bactérias, entre outros. 

v. Na remoção de nanopartículas residuais em águas e efluentes, pelo processo 

de agregação e flutuação por NBs, isoladas ou em conjunto com MBs 

vi. No clareamento e descontaminação de corpos hídricos (in situ), por meio da 

redução da turbidez, separação sólido/líquido e líquido/líquido, e remoção de 

matéria orgânica pelo aumento da atividade microbiológica.  

vii. No aprimoramento de processos de transferência gasosa, como em processos 

oxidativos por ozonização e no desenvolvimento de culturas de algas 

(aumento da absorção de CO2) 

viii. Na flotação (separação) em sistemas de cultivos de microalgas. 

Assim, a pesquisa e inovação no processo de flotação continuam nos setores 

acadêmicos e produtivos, buscando processos de tratamento de águas e efluentes mais 

eficientes, tanto técnica como economicamente.

8 CONCLUSÕES 

Os resultados obtidos permitem estabelecer as seguintes conclusões: 

1. A floculação com 5 mg L-1de Dismulgan em pH 7, seguida por flotação (Psat = 

5 bar) com MBs e NBs apresentou uma eficiência de remoção de óleo maior que 

99%, com um teor de óleo residual de 1 mg L-1. O uso de uma Psat = 3,5 bar 

resultou em uma água tratada com teor de óleo residual dentro da legislação para 

descarte offshore (29 mg L-1). 

2. A flotação de óleo emulsificado com MBs e NBs seguiu uma constante cinética 

com modelo de primeira ordem, com valores de 1,3 e 1,8 min-1 para Psat = 3,5 e 

Psat = 5, respectivamente. 

3. O condicionamento da emulsão oleosa com NBs após a etapa de floculação com 

1 mg L-1 de Dismulgan aumentou a eficiência da flotação de 73 para 84%.  

4. “Flutuação” de flocos oleosos com NBs isoladas resultou numa remoção de 

90%. 

5. As NBs geradas por despressurização e cavitação hidrodinâmica em uma bomba 

centrífuga multifásica (BCM) atingiram uma concentração máxima (4,1 x 109 

NBs mL-1) após aproximadamente 29 ciclos de geração (tempo de residência = 

2,1 min) 

6. As melhores condições de geração de NBs por BCM foram obtidas na pressão 

de operação de 4-5 bar, e uma baixa tensão superficial líquido/ar (49 mN m-1) 

7. A dispersão de NBs gerada por BCM demonstrou-se estável por mais de 60 dias, 

sem decréscimo na concentração ou alteração de tamanho, provando a 

estabilidade e longevidade dessas bolhas em dispersões aquosas. 

8. As NBs foram resistentes às altas pressões e forças de cisalhamento exercidas no 

rotor da bomba durante os diversos ciclos de geração. 

9. A remoção de óleo emulsificado pelo processo de floculação em linha e flotação 

em coluna com MBs e NBs geradas por bomba centrífuga multifásica 

demonstrou ser eficiente em uma grande faixa de taxa de aplicação superficial  

com a concentração de 20 mg L-1 de Dismulgan 

10. Os melhores resultados foram obtidos com uma coluna de flotação de 2,5 m e 

uma taxa de aplicação de 10 m hr-1, resultando em uma água tratada com teor de 

óleo menor que 5 mg L-1. 



80 

 

 

11. Em uma taxa de aplicação superficial bastante elevada (27,5 m hr-1), a água 

tratada apresentou teor de óleo compatível com a legislação de emissão offshore, 

sugerindo a aplicação deste processo como alternativa para tratamento de águas 

produzidas em plataformas marítimas. 

9 SUGESTÕES DE TRABALHOS FUTUROS 

A pesquisa de geração de NBs deve continuar a fim de se obter métodos cada vez mais 

eficientes e sustentáveis de geração de dispersões aquosas de NBs, em alta taxa 

(concentração numérica e volumétrica de NBs) e baixo gasto energético, explorando os 

mecanismos de despressurização de corrente líquida saturada em gás, cavitação 

hidrodinâmica e cisalhamento de massa líquida contendo gases dissolvidos. Além de se 

obter condições de geração de NBs modificadas (carregadas positiva ou negativamente), 

para possibilitar um aumento do campo de pesquisa nas aplicações de NBs. 

Os recentes estudos desenvolvidos no LTM comprovam os efeitos das nanobolhas no 

aumento da eficiência de remoção de poluentes aquosos. Em nível piloto (contínuo), 

ainda não foram reportados estudos no meio científico de processos com a injeção de 

NBs isoladas para condicionamento e/ou “flutuação”. Estudos futuros podem avaliar a 

injeção de bolhas de tamanhos variados na flotação (sistema multibolhas) usando 

bombas multifásicas geradoras de bolhas, de forma que sejam testadas e validadas de 

maneira contínua e com diferentes tipos de águas de processo, visando à transferência 

de tecnologia do setor acadêmico ao mercado e indústria. A Figura 28 apresenta um 

exemplo deste futuro fluxograma proposto.
