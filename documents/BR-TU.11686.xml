ABSTRACT

The income of small-scale fisheries of two urban reservoirs in Brazil: Represa Billings (127 km2) located in 
the metropolitan region of São Paulo, the capital city of the state of São Paulo and Lago Paranoá (38 km2) 
located in Brasília (DF), the capital city of Brazil were calculated and compared. Both fisheries are mainly 
based on the alien Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (more than 80% of the total catch). Although these 
reservoirs are nearly 900 km apart, their native fish fauna belong to the Upper Paraná Province. The 
Represa Billings fishers have, on average, a daily profit of R$ 15.8 (U$ 8.4 mostly employing gill nets) 
and Lago Paranoá fishers R$ 46.6 (U$ 24.9, mostly employing cast nets), which is a statistically significant 
difference (P &amp;lt;0.001). The profit of the fisheries is explained by the factor “reservoir” and covariate “days 
of fishing”. Due to the increasing violence in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, the Represa Billings 
fishery is vanishing.

Keywords: small-scale fisheries, financial analysis, Represa Billings, Lago Paranoá, Brazil.

RESUMO

Avaliação da renda dos pescadores de pequena escala em dois reservatórios 
urbanos brasileiros: Represa Billings (SP) e Lago Paranoá (DF)

Neste artigo, foi calculada e comparada a renda média de pescadores de pequena escala, que operam em 
dois reservatórios urbanos no Brasil: na Represa Billings (127 km2), localizada na região metropolitana da 
cidade de São Paulo, e no Lago Paranoá (38 km2), localizado em Brasília (DF). Ambas as pescarias são 
baseadas em espécies exóticas, principalmente a Tilápia do Nilo, Oreochromis niloticus (mais de 80% das 
capturas). Os pescadores da Represa Billings têm um ganho médio diário de R$ 17,75 (U$ 8,4), empregando 
principalmente a rede-de-espera. Os pescadores do Lago Paranoá têm um ganho médio diário de R$ 46,58 
(U$ 24,9), empregando principalmente a tarrafa. A renda dos pescadores de Brasília é estatisticamente 
superior à dos pescadores de São Paulo (P &amp;lt;0.01). O lucro dessas pescarias é explicado pela natureza 
do reservatório (Paranoá ou Billings) e pelos dias de pesca. Devido ao aumento da violência na região 
metropolitana de São Paulo, as pescarias na Represa Billings estão desaparecendo.

INTRODUCTION

Small-scale fisheries are common in inland 
waters (rivers, lakes and reservoirs). Reservoirs 
are man-made lakes with the primary purpose 

of storing water for power generation, flood 
control and water supply among others. Reservoir 
construction markedly modifies the original 
aquatic ecosystem interfering with all life forms. 
Dams obstruct the water flow causing permanent

flooding upriver and increasing water residence 
time. Sediment transport processes are replaced by 
sediment deposition. The new ecosystem has been 
considered intermediate between a river and a lake 
(Margalef, 1983; Tundisi, 1986). 

Environmental changes resulting from a dam 
lead to considerable modifications in the structure 
of aquatic communities, originally adapted to the 
lotic habitat. The reservoir community results from 
the restructuring of the original river community 
mainly by local extinction and abundance 
alterations of most populations (Araújo-Lima et 
al., 1995). The species that persist are those able to 
reproduce and feed in the new ecosystem (Fernando 
&amp;amp; Holcik, 1991) or in adjacent ecosystems such 
as an upstream floodplain (Agostinho, 1994). In 
Brazil, native and alien species from other river 
basins and from other continents constitute the fish 
fauna of large reservoirs (Agostinho, 1994; 1996; 
1997; Agostinho et al., 2000; Welcomme, 1988). 

In many Brazilian areas, small-scale fisheries 
are the only source of protein for the poor (McGrath 
et al., 1993; Cerdeira et al., 2000), including urban 
areas with water bodies large enough to maintain 
harvestable fish populations, such as the reservoirs 
of Represa Billings in the city of São Paulo, Lago 
Pampulha, in Belo Horizonte and Lago Paranoá, in 
Brasília (Petrere, 1995). 

The small-scale fisheries of Represa Billings 
(Paraná river basin) were described by Minte-
Vera &amp;amp; Petrere (2000) based on a year round 
study (February/1996 to January/1997). The 
main species, which was caught, was the alien 
Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (81.4% of the 
total landings in weight, 147,593.5 kg), followed 
by lambari Astyanax eugenmanniorum (13%), 
common carp Cyprinus carpio (2.4%), traira 
Hoplias aff. malabaricus (2.1%) and the saguirú 
Cyphocarax modestus (1.1%). Other species 
also landed such as bagre (catfish) Rhamdia sp, 
cascudo (armoured catfish) Hypostomus sp, acará 
Geophagus brasiliensis, Congo tilapia Tilapia 
rendalli. Its fish fauna belongs to the Upper Paraná 
Province (Bonetto, 1986), comparatively well 
studied in its middle and final stretches (Bonetto, 
1986; Barrela &amp;amp; Petrere, 1994; Barrella &amp;amp; Petrere, 
2003; Beaumord &amp;amp; Petrere, 1994; Agostinho &amp;amp; 
Julio, 1996; Britsk et al., 1999). Minte-Vera (1997) 
estimated the fish production of Represa Billings 
at 63 kg ha-1 year-1. This value is quite high when 

compared to other reservoirs of the Paraná basin, 
like Itaipú (11.6 kg ha-1 year-1; Petrere, 1996), and 
low when compared to the Brazilian Northeastern 
dams (from 18 to 667 kg ha-1 year-1; Petrere, 1995). 

In Lago Paranoá, the cast net and gill net small-
scale fisheries have been prohibited since 1966. The 
only legal fishery was the recreational hook-and-
line fishery. The prohibition had no biological basis 
since the catches were almost exclusively of alien 
species such as tilapias and carps, and was most 
likely related to a security concern in the capital 
city during the military government. Albeit being 
an illegal activity, there were at least 100 families 
living exclusively from the Lago Paranoá’s fisheries 
in the Federal District in 1985, where the city of 
Brasília is. According to the most experienced 
fishers, the annual production was around 200 t 
of fish in 1985 (48.08 kg ha-1 year-1). The landings 
were totally consumed in the satellite towns around 
Brasília and the supply was below the demand. 
Fishers sold the fish to bar owners and middlemen 
or directly to consumers in street markets (Dornelles 
&amp;amp; Dias Neto, 1985; Walter, 2000). 

Through snowball type interviews, Walter 
(2000) estimated that there were 55 active fishers 
in 1999 in Lago Paranoá all coming from the 
poorest neighborhood around the Federal District 
of Brasília. The annual catch was estimated at 
39 kg ha-1 yr-1, consisting mainly of Nile tilapia 
Oreochromis niloticus (84.9% of the 62.5 t total 
catch), followed by the common carp Cyprinus 
carpio (11.1%) and 4.1% of other species. Its fish 
fauna also belongs to the Upper Paraná Province 
(Ribeiro, 1994), although it has been less studied. 
The monthly income from the activity was on 
average U$ 238.7, but very variable among fishers 
(s = U$ 171.8, n = 22). In addition, each fisher 
hired three other people indirectly. Only 39.6% of 
the fishers were exclusively in fishery activities, 
a small percentage when compared to the fishers 
of the Represa Billings, but large when taking 
into consideration that the fishery was illegal, 
unregulated and unreported at that time.

The Represa Billings and Lago Paranoá are 
both located in large metropolitan cities, subject to 
pollution, conflicts concerning water use, disordered 
occupation of its basin, etc. Nevertheless the small-
scale fisheries in these reservoirs supply the needs 
of the poor and are important sources of income 
and cheap protein. In both reservoirs, the main 



819SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS

Braz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006

captured species is the Nile tilapia. In the Represa 
Billings the fish is sold filleted to middlemen while 
in Lago Paranoá, it is sold raw and is mainly for 
the consumers. In addition, in Lago Paranoá the 
travel distances are shorter than in Represa Billings 
allowing for the use of non-motorized canoes. 
These aspects of fishing are likely to have an impact 
on the fisher’s profit from both reservoirs. In this 
paper, we carried out a comparative analysis to 
highlight the factors that are important in defining 
the income in both reservoirs.

Financial data are not typically collected in a 
systematic way in small-scale fisheries. Although 
these fisheries are complex bio-socio-economic 
systems, most of the attention is always given to 
biological data, mainly due to the training of fishery 
biologists (Hilborn, 1985). Here we have calculated 
the costs, incomes and profits from two small-scale 
fisheries and use these data in a financial analysis 
in order to compare the two reservoirs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study areas 

Represa Billings 
Represa Billings is located in the 

metropolitan region of São Paulo (23° 42’ and 23° 
45’’ S, 46° 27’ and 46° 22’’ W), in the headstreams 
of the Tietê River, the main left bank tributary of 
the Paraná River in São Paulo state. It has an area 
of 127 km2 and a total volume of 1228.7 x 106 m3. 
It is divided into two compartments separated by 
a barrier (Pedreira with 112 km2 and Rio Grande 
with 15 km2). The mean depth is 10 m and the 
perimeter is about 900 km (Rocha, 1984). The 
average water residence time (AWRT) ranges 
between 50 to 100 days (CETESB, 1996). The 
reservoir was constructed with the purpose of 
storing water for hydropower generation for the 
city of São Paulo. The construction began in 
1925 but only in 1950 was the reservoir prepared 
to reach its maximum quota (Macedo, 1992). A 
complex system of pumps, levees and dams let 
the water flow from the Tietê and Pinheiros rivers, 
which cross the city of São Paulo, to be reversed 
to the upstream Billings reservoir and further up 
to the Rio das Pedras reservoir. From there, the 
waters fall 740 m to the Henri Borden generator 
(880 MW, Abreu, 1990) into the city of Cubatão 

at sea level, in the foothills of Serra do Mar 
(Rocha, 1984). 

Represa Billings has a long history of species 
which started in 1948 with the introduction of the 
common carp Cyprinus carpio (Rocha, 1984). In 
1953, the Congo tilapia (or black tilapia as it is 
locally known) T. rendalli was introduced there (and 
for the first time in Brazil, Rocha et al., 1985). This 
species quickly proliferated, becoming dominant. 
According to the local fishers, the Congo tilapia 
started to decline in 1984, when the Nile tilapia 
Oreochromis niloticus started to appear in the 
landings. There were also attempts of introducing 
native migratory species, without success (Minte-
Vera, 1997). The present ichthyofauna is dominated 
by the alien Nile tilapia and followed by some 
native species, (Costa, 1998; Costa et al., 1998) 
several of which are a target for the fishers (Minte-
Vera &amp;amp; Petrere, 2000).

The professional fisheries in the Billings 
reservoir mainly consist of cast nets and gill nets 
in motor canoes made of wood or aluminum with 
engines from 2 to 30 HP, crewed by one or two 
fishers. The gill net may be used actively in a fishery 
locally known as batida (beating) where the fishers 
beat the water surface with a bamboo stick to guide 
the Nile tilapias towards the net (Minte-Vera &amp;amp; 
Petrere, 2000). The tilapias are also caught with 
cast nets. The lambari (Astyanax eigenmaniorum, 
A. bimaculatus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), traíra 
(Hoplias aff. malabaricus) and sagüiru (Cyphocarax 
modestus) are caught with passive gill nets. Gill 
nets are set mainly overnight. Most of the fishers 
maintain an informal commitment of exclusivity 
with the middlemen (Minte-Vera et al., 1997). Nile 
tilapia catches are higher in areas close to Pedreira 
Pumping Station (Minte-Vera, 1997). Besides 
professional fishing, a sport called ravine fishing is 
also practiced by thousands of recreational fishers.

Lago Paranoá 
Lago Paranoá is located in the urban district 

of Brasília (15° 48’ S and 47° 50’ W), the capital 
city of Brazil. The reservoir was filled in 1959, 
when Brasília was being built. At that time, the 
construction of the reservoir was finished having 
the aims of increasing the relative air humidity, 
generating hydroelectric power, making a recreation 
area and a fish nursery, improving the landscape 
and disposing of sewage and rainwater (França et 



820 PETRERE JR., M., WALTER, T. and MINTE-VERA, C. V.

Braz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006

al., 1964). Its hydrographic system belongs to the 
Paraná river basin and it receives the waters from 
River Paranoá, 5 main perennial tributaries and 21 
small streams feed it. The reservoir area is 38 km2, 
with a volume of 498 x 106 m3, a mean depth of 
13 m, a maximum depth of 40 m, and an AWRT 
of 299 days (Starling, 1998). Lago Paranoá’s 
hydrographic basin has 1,046 km2 and in 1986 
its main uses were as a preservation area (41%), 
indefinite occupation (19%), urban occupation 
(18%), agriculture and livestock (8%), small farms 
(7%) and water surface (4%, Silva et al., 1998). 
In spite of having a large preserved area, it joins 
a population of 500,000 inhabitants in its margins 
and sub-basins (mainly Riacho Fundo, Gama and 
Torto), who substantially contribute to pollution 
(Silva et al., 1998).

In 1979, the Company of Water and Sewage 
of Brasília CAESB observed that phosphorous was 
the main limiting nutrient to the eutrophication 
process of the lake that was accelerated by 
receiving non-treated or inadequately treated 
sewage. Aiming to improve the water quality of the 
reservoir, two sewage treatment plants were built: 
ETE SUL that started operating in 1993 and ETE 
NORTE in 1994. After three years, Lago Paranoá 
showed signs of recovery (Starling, 1998). The 
health hazards posed by the consumption of the 
fish were evaluated in a multi-agency study in 1997 
(ISDF/CAESB/UnB/IBGE, 1997). Heavy metal, 
organochlorine compounds and fecal coliform 
analyses were carried out in all fish species from the 
Lago Paranoá in several places, including the ones 
close to sewage discharges and the concentrations 
were all below the detection level. 

Since the construction of the reservoir, several 
fish species were introduced in order to stock the 
reservoir and enhance the small-scale and recrea-
tional fisheries. Fish surveys done since 1959 have 
found viable populations of native and alien species 
with the dominance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis 
niloticus), common carp, Congo tilapia (Tilapia 
rendalli), lambari (Astianax sp), acará (Geophagus 
brasiliensis), sagüirú (Steindachnerina insculpta), 
traíra (Hoplias aff. Malabaricus), tucunaré (Cichla 
sp), (Dornelles &amp;amp; Dias-Neto, 1985; Grando, 
1989; Starling, 1989; 1998; Lazzaro et al., 1998; 
Lebourges-Dhaussy et al., 1998). 

The professional fisheries in Lago Paranoá 
mainly consist of cast nets and gill nets in rowing 

canoes, crewed by individuals or pairs of fishers. 
Fishers sometimes make their own equipment 
in order to reduce costs. The fishers come from 
different satellite-towns around Brasília. Some 
of these are outside the DF state, located in the 
state of Goiás. The landing places are scattered 
along the reservoir shores, however it is possible 
to determine four main areas of concentration of 
fishers: Vila da Telebrasília (an area which has 
illegally been invaded since 1956), Vila Paranoá 
(satellite-town close to the dam); around ETE SUL, 
used by fishers coming from the satellite town of 
Ceilândia) and around ETE NORTE. In 1999 there 
were 70 registered legal professional fishers. There 
is also a large number of sport fishers, mainly using 
hooks and lines. 

Data collection
Data were collected using closed question-

naires, containing personal information (name, 
sex, age, education, non-fisheries income, number 
of residents in the dwelling, number of dependents, 
fishing experience in years), costs related to the 
fishing activity and to commercialization. The 
questionnaires were based on current methodology 
in social sciences successfully applied by IBAMA/
DNOCS/GTZ (1992) in small-scale fisheries in 
NE Brazilian “açudes”, where a fisher is initially 
interviewed and he/she is asked to introduce the 
scientist to another fisher, who takes her/him to 
another and so on, until all the available fishers are 
interviewed. This procedure is known as snowball. 
Two surveys were conducted in each reservoir, one 
in the rainy season and another in the dry season. 
In Represa Billings, the surveys took place on 
October 15 to 16, 1999 and July 15, 2000 and in 
Lago Paranoá, on October 10 to 29, 1999 and on 
July 26 to 30, 2000. 

In addition to the interviews, a data collection 
system was implemented in order to obtain daily 
landing information. The system was in place 
from 15 October, 1999 to 15 January, 2000 and 
from 15 July, 2000 to 15 November, 2000 in 
both reservoirs. In Lago Paranoá, 17 fishers were 
included in the daily landing data collection and 12 
in Represa Billings. The fishers were asked about 
the catch by species, equipment and craft used, 
and effort in hours. The information was used to 
estimate the fisher’s income to detect the main 
species, the equipment type and quantity, as well 



821SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS

as the amount of fuel used for the boats (in Billings 
reservoir). Moreover, the prices of the equipment 
and boats were obtained from sellers and fishers.

Data analysis 
After the surveys, data were stored in a 

database to calculate descriptive statistics. The 
formulae used for the computation of fisher’s 
income, costs and profits, closely follows Ceregato 
and Petrere (2003). 

We tested the hypothesis of equality of the 
mean profit per fisher for the two reservoirs using 
a two-tail t-test (Zar, 1996). The power of the test 
was also computed (Zar, 1996). We used a multiple 
regression analysis (Chatterjee &amp;amp; Price, 1991) 
to identify and quantify the social factors that 
influence the profitability of the fisheries. 

Firstly, a list of some continuous or discrete 
(dummy) Xji variables that may be important in 
generating the profit for the ith fisher (i = 1,2,…,f) 
were included in a multiple regression linear 
model:

RESULTS

Situation of the fisheries
The small-scale fishery in Represa Billings is 

in a process of disarray. In 1997, there were 100 
active fishers (Minte-Vera et al., 1997). In October, 
1999, 52 fishers were interviewed, and only nine 
claimed they were still fishing in the reservoir. 
The others abandoned the activity or moved to 
Barra Bonita reservoir downstream (? 300 km). 
During the week, they fish in Barra Bonita and at 
weekends, return to the Represa Billings to stay 
with their families. The situation was so serious 
that the middlemen also moved down to Barra 
Bonita and the restaurants around Represa Billings 
sold fish which came from Barra Bonita. In the 
Colônia community (where there were six active 

fishers) the middleman reduced his visits from five 
to three times a week. The disarray was caused by 
an increase in the violence in the metropolitan area 
of São Paulo, mainly in the poor outskirts. The 
former largest fishing spot of Pedeira (Minte-Vera, 
1997) is close to the Grajaú slum, a very violent 
area. We were told about the occurrence of armed 
robbery of fishers in canoes in order to steal the 
engines, resulting in the murder of one fisher. The 
nine active fishers moved to less productive fishing 
spots in areas close to their residences, affecting 
their profits negatively. 

In the second survey in July 2000, the situation 
had become even worse. From the nine original 
fishers, only three were still active. The middlemen 
stopped buying fish and one of the fishers sold the 
fish straight to the consumers. The fish was being 
sold cheaper than in the previous survey (R$ 2.80 
a kilo of tilapia filet, instead of R$ 3.00). However, 
one of the three fishers started to sell it close to his 
residence for R$ 4.00 the kilo. 

In Lago Paranoá, there were only 6 active 
fishers in November 1999. This situation was 
mainly due to the activity still being illegal and the 
prohibition being efficiently enforced by the police 
(Walter, 2000). In February 2000, the professional 
fishery with cast nets was legalized. In spite of this, 
in July, 2000 there were only 11 active fishers, 
mainly because of the occurrence of a very cold 
winter (Walter, 2000). Some of the interviewed 
fishers continued to fish illegally with gill nets: 
four fished exclusively with gill nets, four fished 
exclusively with cast nets and three with both types 
of equipment. 

Socioeconomic aspects of the fishers 
Among 29 fishers interviewed, just 3 were 

female, all in Represa Billings. The age varied 
between 22 and 68 years, with an average of 
42.5 years (n = 29, s = 12.7), and 27.6% are 
illiterate. From the interviewees, 62.1% were 
married. However, Minte-Vera et al. (1997) and 
Walter (2000) point out that in both reservoirs it is 
common that the fishers do not differentiate between 
marriage and cohabitation. In several situations, 
there could be more residents in the dwelling than 
just the fishers and their dependents, since some 
may not have enough financial autonomy to live in 
separate houses.

Fishing
The small-scale fisheries in both reservoirs 

are mainly based on Nile tilapia. However, in the 
Represa Billings the fishers also capture lambaris 
and sagüirus. In both reservoirs, fishers use active 
(batida) and passive gill nets and cast nets. Fishers 
work alone or in pairs in small canoes. When in 
pairs, fishers share expenses or hire an assistant 
paying a fixed salary or 30% of the catch. Some 
fishers have their children, husbands or wives as 
crew, concentrating the income inside the family. 
However, the main family participation is in the 
fish processing and commercialization, with 31% 
of the relatives helping in both processes.

On average, the fishers of Represa Billings 
fish for 4.5 days a week (s = 1.5) and those at 
Lago Paranoá’s fish for 5.4 days a week (s = 0.8). 
Extrapolating this information for a year, the 
reservoirs are not statistically different (Represa 
Billings: mean = 234.6, n = 12, s = 75.4; Lago 
Paranoá: mean = 279.1, n = 17, s = 41.0, t = 1.89, 
P &gt; 0.05). The experience of the fishers in years 
can be one of the factors that explain differences 
in the profit. The average years of experience of 
Lago Paranoá’s fishers is 28 (n = 17, s = 14.2 years) 
and significantly higher than that of the Represa 
Billings which is 17.8 years (n = 12, s = 8.6, t = 2.21, 
0.01 &amp;lt;P &amp;lt;0.05). Aiming to assess whether fishing 
is sufficient in order to maintain the fisher and the 
family, two other factors are important: whether the 
families have another source of income and if there 
is a period with no harvests (entressafra). Among 
the 29 interviewees, 13 families have another 
source of income besides fishing. On average, 
these fishers have an “extra” income of R$ 410.9 
(s = R$ 352.5), ranging between R$ 136.00 and 

R$ 1500.00. Minte-Vera (1997) and Walter (2000) 
did not observe an entressafra in either reservoir. 

Costs 
The costs of fishing mainly result from 

expenses with canoes and the engine, fishing 
equipment and its maintenance and fuel. In the 
Represa Billings, the boats are built of wood or 
aluminum, with an average length of 5.4 m, which 
are more expensive but last more (Table 1). In 
Lago Paranoá, the boats are exclusively made of 
plywood, with an average length of 3.8 m which 
are less expensive and durable (Table 1). In Represa 
Billings, the canoes of all but one fisher are powered 
by an engine and in Lago Paranoá none of the 
canoes have engines. The main cost of the engine is 
its acquisition and fuel, which in general is bought 
from the middlemen. During the data collection 
period, the average monthly exchange rate was 
1 U$ = R$ 1.9695 in October/1999, R$ 1.9299 in 
November/1999, R$ 1.8428 in December/1999, 
R$ 1.8037 in January/2000, R$ 1.7978 in 
July/2000, R$ 1.8092 in August/2000, R$ 1.8392 
in September/2000, R$ 1.8796 in October/2000 
and R$ 1.9480 in November/2000 (average for the 
period 1 U$ = R$ 1.87).

Fuel consumption was estimated to be 
on average 2.16 liters for a trip (s = 0.9, n = 12; 
R$ 1.50 liter-1). The average cost of an engine 
was about R$ 2066.7 (s = R$ 1025, n = 12). Its 
price varied according to its power and the degree 
of depreciation when acquired (it is common for 
fishers to buy second hand engines). An engine 
lasts on average 12.2 years (s = 7.3, n = 12). 

The two reservoirs present differences in the 
acquisition and maintenance of the equipment. In

both reservoirs, there are three different strategies 
to obtain fishing equipment: i) the equipment is 
bought at the local market; ii) the raw materials 
are bought at the local market, but the equipment 
is handmade by the fisher himself and; iii) the raw 
material is bought by the fisher who pays somebody 
else to make the equipment. A similar situation is 
observed for equipment maintenance: i) it is done 
by the fisher himself/herself; ii) the fisher hires 
somebody to do it; iii) no maintenance at all is 
carried out. According to the strategy adopted, the 
costs will vary from one fisher to another.

As we already mentioned, fishers in both 
Represa Billings and Lago Paranoá reservoirs use 
gill nets and cast nets. However, in Represa Billings 
it is common for the fishers to have a larger amount 
of extra equipment, unlike Lago Paranoá, where 
fishers have exactly what they use on a daily basis. 
In the first case, we considered the average length 
of the gill nets used daily to calculate the expenses. 
The cast net is sometimes used in Represa Billings. 
However, it is the only equipment allowed by 
the legislation in Lago Paranoá. Its cost is highly 
variable due to the fact that some fishers make it 
and others buy it (Table 2). 

Other costs may result from commercialization 
or from expenses related to transport. Taking this 
into consideration, there are differences between 
the two reservoirs. In Represa Billings, the main 
product is the filleted tilapia and acará, followed 
by raw lambari and saguirú, sold raw. The fillets 

are wrapped in Styrofoam trays and sold to the 
middlemen (who usually supply the trays). To 
produce a kilo of fillet, four kilos of raw fish are 
necessary (Minte-Vera, 1997). In Lago Paranoá, 
the fish is eviscerated and sold to the consumers 
by kilo or in fish strings of 1 or 2 kg, and to the 
middlemen, in cans or by kilo. A can contains, on 
average, 13.80 kg of fish (Walter, 2000). The fish 
sold to consumers incurs other expenses on ice (on 
a lesser scale), the rent of a tent in the market and 
transportation. A third expense in Lago Paranoá is 
related to transport from their homes to the reservoir, 
since the fishers live far from the reservoir. Out of 
the 17 interviewees, 12 fishers reported expenses 
on bus tickets. Three reported expenses on fuel for 
their cars. On average, they spent R$ 6.2 day-1 on 
transport (n = 15, s = R$ 5.1), varying from R$ 3.00 
to R$ 25.00. Five fishers rented a tent in the street 
market, with a weekly cost of on average R$ 1.4 
(n = 5, s = R$ 1.3). 

Income 
The income is the result of the total catch 

excluding the consumption and donations 
multiplied by the price of the fish. In the studied 
period, the total catch was 40,240 kg (Table 3) and 
the total comsumption/donation was 199 kg.week-1. 
In represa Billings, the main commercial species 
were alien tilapias (51.2%) and the natives acará 
(33.3%), lambari (10.5%) and saguirú (2.7%). 
Other species correspond to 2.3%. In Lago Paranoá,

the main species are the alien tilapias (90.9%) and 
carp (8.9%). Other species correspond to 0.2%. The 
market price varies according to the fish species 
and the sale type (wholesale and retail), as well as 
the reservoir (Table 4). 

Profit 
Lago Paranoá’s fishers have on average a daily 

profit of R$ 46.6 (sd = 24.9, n = 12) while Represa 
Billings’s fishers have a profit of only R$ 15.75 (sd = 
24.7, n = 17,). The high profit in Lago Paranoá is 
clear, since the intervals do not overlap (t = 44,90**, 
df =27, with a retrospective power (Thomas, 1997) 
higher than 0.99 for ? = 0.01). Furthermore, in 
Represa Billings one fisher was interviewed, 
who we later discovered (after having calculated 
it) had a loss not a profit! Minte-Vera &amp;amp; Petrere 
(2000) point out that in Represa Billings, there are 
two types of fishers: the first group that catches 
tilapias exclusively, with beat gill net fishing 
and the second one that also fishes for lambaris, 
sagüirus and traíra with gill nets, catching tilapias 

in a smaller proportion. According to the authors, 
the first group catches more, however only one 
fisher from this group was interviewed during the 
surveys, showing an extreme profit when compared 
to the others. Finally, we calculated the monthly 
profit of the fishers multiplying the daily profit by 
the number of days of the month that they were 
active for both seasons (Table 5).

Factors that influence the fishers´ profit 
To analyse the profits, a multiple linear ex-

ploratory regression model was initially consid-
ered with the following variables: dummies – sex, 
marital status, fishing period (dry or rainy), fishing 
equipment, kind of partnership (partner/assistant), 
reservoir (Billings or Paranoá); continuous varia-
bles - number of dependents, years of experience, 
other sources of income, formal education and 
days of fishing. The variables: fishing equipment 
and kind of partnership are not orthogonal. 
Therefore, three out of four possibilities were 
considered: fishing alone (yes = 1, no = 0), 



825SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES INCOME IN TWO BRAZILIAN URBAN RESERVOIRS

Braz. J. Biol., 66(3): 817-828, 2006

fishing with relatives (yes = 1, no = 0), fishing 
in partnership (yes = 1, no = 0), fishing with an 
assistant (yes = 1, no = 0). The variable: fishing 
equipment was also separated into three levels: 
cast net, gill net and beat fishing, only two were 
included in the model simultaneously. 

The variable: formal education was trans-
formed into ranks (Zar, 1996), where: Illiterate = 1, 
&amp;lt;4 years of study = 2, 4 years = 3, &gt; 4 and &amp;lt;8 
years = 3, 8 years = 4, &gt; 8 and &amp;lt;12 years = 4. 

The full model is:
Profit = constant + sex + marital status + 

fishing period + fishing equipment + kind of 
partnership + reservoir + number of dependents + 
years of experience + other sources of income + 
formal education + days of fishing. 

The residuals of this model presented 
heterogeneity of variance. Therefore, asquare rooth 
transformation in the response variate (Profit) was 
applied. 

The adjusted final (minimum) model was: 
• (Profit)0,5 = 0.06 + 3.56* reservoir + 0.01* 

days of fishing; and
• where reservoir: Paranoá = 1; Billings = 0; 

n = 28, R2 = 0.642; F
2,25

 = 22.4**.
So, the new residual analysis did not detect 

any violations of the usual assumptions of a linear 
model.

DISCUSSION

As explained, the fishers in both reservoirs are 
not organized, and fishing is unregulated. In spite of

this, the activity supplies fishers´ needs of income and 
protein. In both reservoirs, fishing is practised by the 
poor population, as previously shown by Minte-Vera 
et al. (1997) and Walter (2000). In Lago Paranoá, 
the catch is exclusively of Nile tilapia, in contrast 
to Represa Billings’s, where fishers use strategies 
to catch other species, mainly the lambari and the 
saguirú apart from the main species, Nile tilapia. 

The profit of Lago Paranoá’s professional 
fishers is far higher than the profit from the 
Represa Billings fishers. This difference can be 
explained by several factors: i) the use of cheaper 
canoes, with no engine and thus no fuel expenses 
by the Paranoá’s fishers; ii) less fishing effort 
due to shorter fishing trips and lower investment; 
iii) direct commercialization to the final buyer in 
Lago Paranoá, where the raw and eviscerated fish 
from Lago Paranoá have similar prices to Represa 
Billings, which are the most appreciated filleted 
fish.

However, Lago Paranoá is smaller (38 km2) 
than Represa Billings (127 km2), with countless 
accesses, which facilitates small displacements and 
use of rowing canoes. Another factor that explains 
the presence of cheaper canoes with no engines 
in Lago Paranoá was the illegality of fishing from 
1966 to 1999, with a great risk of the craft (and 
fishing equipment) being confiscated by the police. 
When fishing was legalized in December, 1999 this 
tended to change, so much so that nowadays there 
are already fishers acquiring engines. The increase 
in fishing can mean more income, but its higher cost 
can reduce their profit. Furthermore, in Represa 
Billings there is a need to use more equipment on 
each fishing trip, increasing the cost of equipment 
maintenance and replacement.

A second consideration is the commerciali-
zation strategy of the fishers. In Represa Billings, 
the fish is filleted, which makes it easier to be 
sold. There is also a strong link to the middlemen, 
necessary due to the isolation where the fishers 
of the Colônia community live that hinders them 
selling it directly and which in turn could increase 
the income, if the fishers could sell it at the landing 
place. This is unlikely since the landing places are 
isolated and far from potential markets.

The profit in both reservoirs, in spite of the 
disarray of both fisheries, is high when compared 
to other fisheries. Ceregato &amp;amp; Petrere (2003) when 
comparing the profit of small-scale fisheries in 

the Urubupungá complex of reservoirs in the river 
Paraná downstream, found average daily profits of 
R$ 13.2 (U$ 11.3 as 1 U$ = R$ 1.1628 in July/98) 
(s = 25.4) for the reservoirs of Ilha Solteira (SP) 
and Jupiá (SP), of R$ 4.1 (U$ 3.5) (s = 21.3) 
for the Paraná river and of R$ 1.5 (U$ 1.3) (s = 
35.1) for downstream Porto Primavera dam, in 
the dry period. In the rainy period, the daily profit 
was: R$ 19.5 (U$ 10.2 as 1 U$ = R$ 1.9231 in 
February/99) (s = 37.4) for the reservoirs of Jupiá 
and Ilha Solteira, R$ 12.9 (U$ 6.7) (s = 46.0) for 
the Paraná River between these reservoirs and 
Porto Primavera and R$ 23.0 (U$ 11.97) (s = 29.2) 
below the dam. Cetra &amp;amp; Petrere (2001)) calculated 
the daily income of fishers from the Tocantins 
River at US $2.00. Okada et al. (1997) calculated 
the daily income of the fishers of two reservoirs 
in the Iguaçú River at US $12.00. The monthly 
profit of fishing in the Itaipú reservoir is US $25.00 
(Agostinho et al., 1994). 

In the present study, the profitability of the 
fishery is mainly explained by its context, i.e. by 
the reservoir where it is carried out and by the 
number of days of fishing. Ceregato &amp;amp; Petrere 
(2003), when studying Rio Paraná’s professional 
fishers, observed that the profit could be explained 
also by other variables such as formal education 
and type of fishing equipment.

Fisheries are complex bio-socio-economic 
systems, but they are mainly studied only in 
biological aspects. Financial data are important to 
understand fishers´ behavior as well as motivations 
and thus to assess how management policies affect 
them.

Economic fishery information has been 
seldom collected, even in highly industrialized 
large-scale fisheries due to the lack of tradition and 
poor training in the subject by fishery biologists. This 
information is usually not taken into consideration 
for management purposes or in order to give bank 
credit to a fisher when he/she applies for it trying 
to improve his/her technology. It can be observed 
in this paper that this aim is not difficult to attain, 
as most of the necessary information has been 
obtained just by interviewing the fishers about their 
daily activities and the financial analysis carried 
out is arithmetic. Therefore this study together with 
Agostinho et al. (1994) and Ceregato &amp;amp; Petrere 
(2003) is another example of applying financial 
analysis on two small-scale fisheries where a lot

of the economic agreements are informal and thus 
official statistics are difficult to obtain. In view 
of the results here, it is not difficult to assess the 
adoption of different stock management strategies 
in order to increase fishers´ income and hopefully 
protect the fish stock.
