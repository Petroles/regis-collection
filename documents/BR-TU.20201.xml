RESUMO 

A exploração e produção de reservatórios de elevada pressão e 

temperatura e com grande potencial de produção de hidrocarbonetos, em 

cenários de águas profundas, impõe diversos desafios no que tange a 

integridade estrutural de poços de petróleo. Um problema recorrente é 

causado pelo fenômeno conhecido como APB (Annular Pressure 
Builup), consequência do processo de aquecimento do poço durante a 

produção de hidrocarbonetos oriundos do reservatório. Este 

aquecimento afeta o espaço anular do poço, que se encontra 

completamente selado e preenchido com fluido de perfuração, que sofre 

expansão térmica. A expansão do fluido aumenta a pressão anular para 

níveis que podem ultrapassar a resistência mecânica dos elementos 

tubulares que compõem o poço, levando à perda de sua integridade. A 

fim de evitar o colapso do tubo, várias estratégias são utilizadas para 

mitigar o APB, tal como o Vacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT). A técnica 

consiste na utilização de dois tubos de produção concêntricos que são 

soldados nas suas extremidades, formando um espaço anular, que então 

é evacuado, reduzindo a transferência de calor radial. No entanto, uma 

vez que a conexão entre cada dois tubos não é termicamente isolada, a 

transferência de calor pode ser significativa nesta região. O presente 

trabalho propõe um estudo teórico da transferência de calor no sistema 

VIT. Primeiramente, o problema térmico foi modelado e simulado com 

o auxílio de um software comercial utilizando o método dos volumes 

finitos (MVF). Foi proposto um modelo em regime permanente baseado 

em circuito térmico equivalente bidimensional (modelo nodal). Um 

refino do modelo nodal foi efetuado para que apresentasse resultados 

similares aos encontrados utilizando o MVF, sendo uma alternativa fácil 

para incorporação em um simulador multifísico de produção de petróleo 

em poços. Desta forma, o modelo térmico nodal do VIT foi acoplado a 

um simulador de produção de poços (hidrodinâmico-térmico-estrutural) 

gerando resultados mais realistas do que os atualmente empregados na 

indústria de petróleo. Estes resultados foram validados com dados de 

campo para dois poços de petróleo e contra resultados oriundos de um 

software comercial extensivamente utilizado por engenheiros de 

petróleo em projeto de poços.

ABSTRACT 

Annular Pressure Buildup (APB) is a recurring problem that affects high 

pressure and high temperature wells during oil exploration and 

production in deepwater scenarios. Wellbore heating is caused by the 

upward flow of heated hydrocarbons towards the wellhead. The 

temperature rise affects the annular space of the borehole, which is often 

sealed and completely filled with drilling fluid, causing its expansion. 

The expansion of the fluid increases the annulus pressure to levels that 

can surpass the structural limits of the materials, posing a risk to the 

wellbore integrity. In order to avoid the collapse of the tube, several 

strategies are commonly used to mitigate APB, such as the use of 

Vacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT). This technique consists of using two 

concentric metallic tubes that are welded at their extremities, forming an 

annular space that is subsequently evacuated to minimize radial heat 

transfer. However, since the connection between each pair of tubes is 

not insulated, heat transfer can be significant in VIT junction region. 

This work proposes a theoretical analysis of the heat transfer in wells 

assisted by VIT systems. Firstly, the thermal problem was modeled and 

simulated using the finite volume method (FVM) with a commercial 

software package. A steady-state equivalent thermal network (ETN) 

model was developed and its mesh refinement was adjusted such that it 

provides results similar to those obtained with the FVM, but with a 

much lower computational cost. The VIT ETN model was then coupled 

to a multiphysics wellbore simulator (hydrodynamic-thermal-structural), 

producing potentially more realistic results for the oil industry. Such 

results have been compared and validated with field data from two 

actual petroleum wells and against data from a commercial software 

package extensively used by the major oil companies in wellbore 

design.

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Problem statement 

The increasing demand for hydrocarbon resources has compelled 

oil companies to focus on deep and ultra-deep water environments, as 

well as to explore unconventional reservoirs. As a result, well integrity 

has become one of the most critical aspects during well construction and 

operation.  

Some of the offshore oil reserves recently discovered in Brazil lie 

in reservoirs located at long depths, far away from the coast. For 

example, the pre-salt area in the Santos basin is characterized by water 

columns up to 2,300 m deep and target depths greater than 5,000 m, 

with salt layers reaching thicknesses of 2,500 m. The large light-oil 

reservoirs (28 to 32 degrees API) in the pre-salt region have typical 

pressures of 60 MPa and temperatures up to 390 K.  

Along with the growth of petroleum exploration and production 

in harsh environmental conditions, numerous technical challenges have 

emerged, such as well construction in harsh conditions (ultra-deep 

water, thick salt layers, high hardness reservoir rocks, high pressure 

wells), complex flow assurance strategies (hydrate and wax formation 

inhibition, scale mitigation) and the choice of suitable enhanced oil 

recovery methods. 

Given the large costs involved in deep water operations, the 

produced hydrocarbons are expected to be transported from the well to 

the often remote processing facilities with the least amount of energy 

(flow and thermal) losses. From the reservoir rock to the surface 

facilities, three different stages of hydrocarbon flow can be identified 

(considering a subsea vertical well): 

? Radial liquid or gas-liquid flow through the permeable reservoir 
rock to the wellbore; 

? Vertical gas-liquid flow through a circular pipe from the bottom 
hole to the wellhead; 

? Horizontal flow followed an inclined pipe flow through the 
flowline from the wellhead to the SPU (Stationary Production 

Unit).  

In each of those stages, the flow behaves differently and the 

corresponding pressure loss and temperature distributions are governed 

by different sets of variables. In this work, only the wellbore flow stage 



34 

 

will be considered, since it is responsible for the major portion of the 

pressure loss. Figure 1.1 illustrates the production scheme of a subsea 

vertical well and the path followed by the produced fluid from the 

reservoir to the production facilities (yellow arrows).  

 

 
Figure 1.1 – Subsea vertical well production scheme. 

 

Similar to the fluid flow, a heat transfer analysis and its impact on 

the wellbore structure is of major importance in well design. Thermal 

phenomena play an important role in several aspects of deep water oil 

production, such as tubing and casing stress analysis, material selection 

(metals and elastomers) and tubing well performance and sizing 

(BELLARBY, 2009). 

Furthermore, knowledge of the wellhead temperature during well 

production is an important issue, since directly affects the flow line 

sizing and primary oil processing operations on the SPU. Knowing the 

temperature gradient along the well depth is essential in well design and 

construction, since the fluids and equipment used in drilling and 

completion are selected based on the local pressure and temperature 

conditions. Therefore, controlling thermal events and their consequences 
has been a concern for oil companies since the early days of deep water 

production in the 1960s (EZELL et al., 2010).  
Other reasons for controlling the temperature of a wellbore during 

oil and gas production can be outlined as follows: 

? Prevention or reduction of wax deposition in the tubing; 



 35 

 

 

? Tubing scale mitigation; 

? Prevention of hydrate blockage; 

? Reducing thermal loads on the surrounding casing; 

? Maintaining low-viscosity fluid flow; 

? Reduction in annular pressure buildup. 
Generally speaking, all of the above issues require reducing the 

outward heat transfer from the well. In particular, reducing wellbore 

heating during hydrocarbon production is crucial to the safety of the 

production process. For instance, two main problems can be highlighted 

regarding the well integrity: (i) the casing collapse and (ii) the casing 

connection compression failure. The first is caused by the APB 

(Annulus Pressure  Buildup), which occurs when the hydrocarbon flow 

heats up the entire region close to the production string, forcing the 

expansion of the surrounding fluids and, consequently, the 

pressurization of the well annuli. The increase in pressure may exceed 

the mechanical strength of the casings, causing them to collapse, as 

shown in Figure 1.2. The second problem arises due to casing dilation. 

Casing strings are set at the wellhead on the high-pressure housing 

through the casing hanger, and fixed to the rock formation by the 

cement. Thermally induced dilation causes the casing string to be 

compressed to a point at which the casing connection resistance is 

surpassed. 

 

 

Figure 1.2 – 0.4064 m (16 in) outer diameter casing collapsed during hot fluid 

circulation due to APB (PATTILLO et al., 2006). 

 

The thermal/mechanical response of the well to the upward flow 

of hydrocarbons is related to its inner structure as well as to the 

surrounding formation. For instance, cementing operations are 

mandatory in all drilling activities as they assure the hydraulic insulation 

between permeable layers of the formation besides keeping the casing 



36 

 

fixed to the borehole walls. The well cementing process is made 

gradually following the drilling of each phase, which is defined by a 

length that depends on the rock formation pressures. As the wellbore is 

drilled, its diameter decreases and a new casing needs to be set and 

cemented. In the first couple of phases, the entire annular space between 

the borehole walls and the casing is completely filled by cement up to 

the wellhead. In the following phases, the cement slurry usually does not 

fill the well up to the wellhead. In turn, the region above the top of 

cement (TOC) is completed with the drilling fluid used to drill that 

phase of the well. Figure 1.3 illustrates a typical casing design of a 

subsea well with three annuli (A, B and C) filled by different fluids. In 

this text, the symbol A always denotes the innermost annulus, followed 

by the symbols B, C and so on, as the radial distance increases. 
 

 
Figure 1.3 – Typical casing design of a subsea well (YIN et al., 2014). 

 

Therefore, depending on the location of the TOC in the annular 

space (i.e., above or below the casing shoe), the drilling fluid can be 

confined or not. Generally, the pressure increase is limited by the 

formation fracture resistance (FERREIRA et al., 2012). At this 

condition, when the annulus pressure reaches the so-called formation 



 37 

 

 

leak-off pressure, an amount of fluid proportional to the volume increase 

due to the annulus expansion flows into the formation until the annulus 

and the formation pressures become equal. However, if the TOC is 

placed above the casing shoe, the annulus is not in contact with the 

“safety valve” provided by nature (MOE and ERPELDING, 2000). As a 

result, the annular pressure cannot be relieved, which increases the stress 

in the tubulars, leading eventually to a well failure (HASAN et al., 

2009). 

Despite the efforts made in the last two decades, the discovery of 

new production scenarios and the development of new technologies 

created a need for identifying and predicting the key variables that 

control the annular pressure buildup (APB). Consequently, this work 

intends to model, predict and propose strategies to mitigate this 

phenomenon in deep water wells. To this end, a fully-coupled 

multiphysics model has been proposed to account for all main 

hydrodynamic, thermal and mechanical aspects encountered in real 

wells. Furthermore, in order to reduce the heat transfer to the formation, 

the use of VIT (Vacuum Insulated Tubing) joints is considered in detail. 

Hence, the major contribution of this thesis is the development of a VIT 

thermal model that, when incorporated into a wellbore simulator, can 

provide an accurate evaluation of its APB mitigation potential. In the 

following section, the motivation and the goals of the thesis are 

presented. 
 

1.2 Motivation 

APB has been a concern in the petroleum industry since the 

1990s due to a failure in a Marlin field well in the Gulf of Mexico 

(AZZOLA et al., 2004, GOSCH et al., 2004, ELLIS et al., 2004). Since 

then, an increasingly important issue in deep water exploitation has been 

the evaluation of appraisal wells as possible production wellbores. The 

reason is that it is difficult to justify economically the abandonment of a 

wellbore that has cost tens of millions of dollars to drill, a typical figure 

for the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster. On the other hand, the potential 

consequences of a well failure during its production cannot be 

neglected. Central to this evaluation is the consideration of well integrity 

issues associated with APB.  

Therefore, the use of insulated tubes to thermally assist critical 

wells is a more attractive alternative than the undesirable restriction of 

the production stream, which directly limits profit.  In fact, the frequent 



38 

 

need for thermal insulation systems in oil wells in the appraisal and 

development phases of the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster alone serves as 

motivation for the present study. 

While there are few relevant publications concerning insulation 

materials applied to wellbores, most of them are related to testing and 

application of thermal insulation materials in flowlines, manifolds, 

Christmas trees and risers. The main concerns are associated to the 

cooling effect due to the cold seawater (HUDSON et al., 2000; 
RUSCHAU et al., 2010; GREALISH and RODDY, 2002) and, in many 

cases, there are no restriction on insulation thickness to reach a suitable 

performance (WATKINS, 2000; MELVE, 2001; MCKECHNIE, 2002; 

GOU et al., 2004).   

However, during well construction and production operations, 

several heat exchange phenomena occur between the rock formation, the 

wellbore fluids (produced fluid, drilling fluid and completion fluid), the 

drilling and tubing string components, the casings and the cement. 

Temperature and pressure prediction in each section has an important 

role in the planning of critical operations. The rate of heat transfer from 

the wellbore is affected by many parameters, such as the formation type 

and fluid properties, well geometry, operation time, flow rates and water 

depth.  

Numerical simulation allows an accurate prediction of these 

phenomena, enabling a safer and more efficient planning of some well 

operations. Most simulators are based on the finite difference and finite 

volume methods to solve the governing equations for the thermal-

hydraulic behavior of the multiphase system. However, there are 

specific points to be improved in the available well numerical 

simulators, such as the coupling with the reservoir and the insertion of 

multiple thermal insulation sections in the production string, which 

directly affects the radial heat transfer from the wellbore and the APB. 

Therefore, the development of detailed multiphysics models 

capable of accurately predicting the hydrodynamic, thermal and 

mechanical behavior of oil wells, as well as their behavior while assisted 

by thermal insulation systems (e.g., VIT) will certainly contribute to 

more efficient wellbore design strategies in the Pre-salt Cluster. 

Important to realize that uncertainties about formation properties 

and even related to wellbore sensors data employed as input parameters 

may lead to incorrect predictions obtained from wellbore simulators. 

Also, it is worth mentioning the importance to comprehensively handle 

all the multiphysics aspects taking place in the wellbore for all time 

scales experienced by the well during production. 



 39 

 

 

1.3 Objectives 

The overall objective of the thesis is to carry out a comprehensive 

analysis of the multiphase flow and heat transfer in wellbores along with 

its mechanical behavior, including a detailed evaluation of thermally 

insulated tubing sections in the production string. The appropriate 

prediction of the temperature field in the wellbore deserves somewhat 

attention, since the mechanical responses and, consequently, the APB 

quantification are directly affected by the local heat transfer calculation. 

Thus, the specific goals of the present work are: 

? To develop a heat transfer model based on the analogy between 
thermal and electrical circuits, aiming to quantify the thermal 

design parameters of the VIT unit (overall heat transfer 

coefficient and effective thermal conductivity). Because of its 

two-dimensional form, this approach is able to capture 

important aspects of the heat transfer in the junction region at a 

reduced computational cost and can, therefore, be easily 

integrated in wellbore heat transfer simulators. A validation of 

the equivalent thermal network (ETN) model is carried out 

using a commercial software package to solve the combined 

heat transfer (conduction-radiation) equations in differential 

form via the Finite Volume Method; 

? To incorporate the two-dimensional VIT thermal model in an 
in-house multiphysics (hydrodynamic, thermal, structural) 

wellbore (MW) model (Hafemann, 2015) and evaluate multiple 

scenarios involving different operating conditions and 

parameters of the VIT. The results of this analysis are expected 

to provide insight into VIT applications to mitigate APB and its 

effects on the wellbore mechanical integrity. 

? To validate the full model (ETN + MW models) using field data 
and commercial software results. For the latter, the commercial 

package Wellcat™, offered by Halliburton/Landmark and 

extensively employed by petroleum engineers during well 

design phase to predict the wellbore thermal-hydraulic and 

mechanical behaviors, has been used.

1.4 Document outline 

This document is composed of five chapters. Chapter 2 consists 

of a literature review, in which numerical models of multiphase flow 

and heat transfer in wellbores are presented highlighting the 

quantification of the APB. Moreover, experimental works and heat 

transfer models relating to the VIT performance and field application are 

also described. In the end of this section the main insights about the 

literature review is briefly described and the contributions of this thesis 

to cover the gaps found in the literature are highlighted. Chapter 3 

describes a theoretically based methodology developed to assess the 

thermal performance of VIT systems through a parametric evaluation of 

their thermal properties and geometrical parameters. Two independent 

formulations were tested, namely a 3-D numerical differential model (3-

D FVM) and a 2-D nodal approach (2-D equivalent thermal network – 

ETN model). The similarities and differences of each model are 

explored through a fundamental analysis of the VIT performance. Then, 

the methodology to incorporate the 2-D ETN model into a wellbore 

simulator is described. Chapter 4 refers to the results reached in this 

thesis emphasizing the importance of incorporation the VIT thermal 

approach into the wellbore simulator. In addition, two case studies using 

actual wells are suggested to predict the thermal-structural behavior of 

wellbores as well as to validate the coupled model. Chapter 5 presents 

the conclusions and recommendations for future works.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

In this chapter, a review of the existing numerical and analytical 

multiphase flow and heat transfer models applied to wellbores are 

presented, while highlighting their assumptions and limitations, and 

their use on the quantification of APB. The review is extended by 

presenting experimentally based studies related to the VIT’s 

performance and field application.  

 

2.1 Wellbore multiphysics phenomena  

The calculation of production parameters influenced by fluid 

flow and heat transfer in wellbores is unquestionably challenging. For 

instance, rigorous prediction of a multiphase multicomponent flow 

system in wellbores is complex phenomenon, since it is related to the 

phase change of mixtures pressure, temperature and liquid holdup.  

Despite the technical difficulties, modeling of multiphase flow and heat 

transfer during oil and gas production to predict the pressure and 

temperature profiles in the tubing string and in well annuli is a core skill 

for any oil company. It is fundamental to predict flow rates, select the 

correct size of tubulars and equipment, and consider the occurrence of 

corrosion and erosion rates and many other tasks. Therefore, the 

complex nature of these multiphysics phenomena have boosted a series 

of studies, which will be reviewed in the following sections. 

 

2.1.1 Multiphase flow models in wellbores 

Multiphase flow in wellbores takes place in several activities 

during well construction and production/injection phases. Even though 

several works deal with thermal fluid flow in wellbores, there are some 

challenges involved in the modeling of multiphase flows to simulate 

petroleum production in different types of wells (tubing diameter, well 

trajectory), operational conditions (pressure, temperature), and 

hydrocarbon composition. However, given the wide range of different 

flowing systems and regimes, a multitude of multiphase flow models, 

most of which numerically-based, were developed by the literature 

aiming to precisely mimic the complex phenomenological nature 

existing in wellbores worldwide. Due to the complex nature of the 



42 

 

petroleum production process and the high number of variables involved 

in estimating pressure and temperature profiles, many approaches have 

been used to solve the fluid flow in oil wells. Earlier approaches were 

based on empirical or semi empirical methods and were not able to 

capture the entire physics of the multiphase flow. Additionally, these 

methods may not be suitable for predicting pressure and liquid holdup 

transients. More recently, however, there has been a shift towards a 

more fundamental modeling of flow in wells, using the so-called 

mechanistic approach (CANDIA and CRUZ, 2004). This approach is 

based on the solution of local averaged conservation equations for the 

variables of interest (pressure, temperature, velocity, and liquid holdup) 

(CANDIA and CRUZ, 2004), and can be extended to more general 

problems, such as three-dimensional and transient flows. 

Pucknell et al. (1993) published a survey focusing on models 
used to predict the wellhead pressure in 212 oil wells. Figure 2.1 shows 

the error associated with some multiphase flow models, which are 

widely accepted in the oil industry, in relation to field data. According to 

Figure 2.1, the average error was relatively low, between 7.6 and 14%, 

and all models reported show consistency.

(BELLARBY, 2009 adapted from PUCKNELL et al., 1993). 

 

One of the major difficulties in dealing with multiphase flows is 

that mass, momentum, and energy transfer rates and processes can be 

sensitive to the geometric distribution of the components within the flow 



43 

 

 

(BRENNEN, 2005) and, therefore, require a fully coupled solution. The 

interface between phases can take on a variety of configurations, known 

as flow patterns (CHENG et al., 1998). There are three basic approaches 
to estimate the pressure drop and void fraction in a production stream 

using one-dimensional models: the homogeneous model, the separated 

flow model and the mechanistic model based on flow patterns. It should 

be mentioned that the choice of approach to be adopted depends on the 

well data available, such as trajectory, produced fluid type (vapor-liquid 

equilibrium study - PVT analysis), tubing diameter, and operational data 

from drill stem test, among others.   

The simplest approach to model multiphase flows is the 

homogeneous flow model, which considers the fluids intimately mixed, 

so they can be treated as a single-phase fluid with average properties. 

Flow patterns are, therefore, ignored in the homogeneous model. The 

intrinsic assumptions of the homogeneous model are as follows 

(CORRADINI, 1997): 

? The slip (relative) velocity between the phases is zero; 

? The two fluids are uniformly mixed and move as a pseudo fluid 
at the mixture velocity; 

? There is thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases.   
The flow patterns likely to take place in a vertical well producing 

a gas-liquid mixture are shown in Figure 2.2 (COLLIER and THOME, 

1994). 

The flow regimes shown in Figure 2.2 have been described based 

on laboratory observations through transparent pipes. In order of 

increasing gas content, the flow configurations in a vertical pipe are 

explained as follows: 

? Bubbly flow: The liquid is the continuous phase. The low-
velocity gas or vapor phase is dispersed as uniformly distributed 

bubbles within the liquid. The two-phase static head is the main 

component of the pressure gradient in a vertical conduit, as the 

friction part is expected to be smaller due to the relatively low 

mixture velocity.  

? Slug flow: The liquid is still the continuous phase, even though 
the gas velocity is higher. The dispersed bubbles coalesce and 

form large bullet shaped bubbles (Taylor bubbles). A falling 

liquid film surrounds the Taylor bubbles. The so-called slug 

flow unit cell consists of two parts: the Taylor bubble region 

and the liquid slug region. The latter often contains small 

dispersed bubbles. 



44 

 

? Churn flow: Both phases are continuous due to the breakdown 
of the liquid slugs as the gas velocity is increased. Liquid flow 

reversals (oscillatory motion) are the main features of this flow 

regime as the gas lacks enough momentum to move the liquid 

upwards. Interfacial friction plays an important role in 

determining the pressure drop in this flow regime.  

? Annular flow: As the gas velocity increases, the flow becomes 
unidirectional (upward) and high interfacial shear gives rise to 

droplet entrainment in the vapor core. A thin liquid film covers 

the pipe wall, with liquid droplets being continuously entrained 

from and deposited back on the film. Due to the low liquid 

content associated with this flow regime, frictional effects are 

the main component of the pressure gradient. 

 

 
Figure 2.2 – Different flow regimes in vertical pipe (COLLIER and THOME, 

1994). 

 

The drift-flux model (ZUBER and FINDLAY, 1965) is a mixture 

model with a constitutive relationship for the relative motion between 

the phases, which itself depends on the flow regime (COLLIER and 

THOME, 1994). The drift-flux model can be extended to incorporate 

energy transport effects (ISHII and HIBIKI, 2006). 

The separated flow model considers each phase individually, for 

which individual mass, momentum and energy balance equations are 



45 

 

 

formulated. The balance equations contain interaction terms to 

incorporate the interfacial transfer of mass, momentum and energy 

between the phases. Without these terms in the balance equations, the 

two phases are essentially independent and can be analyzed by single-

phase flow equations (CORRADINI, 1997).  

The separated flow approach can be developed in two ways: from 

experimentally based correlations or mechanistic modeling 

(POURAFSHARY, 2007). The experimentally based approach relies 

heavily on empirical correlations for the closure relationships needed in 

the models. The other approach is based on mechanistic models to 

describe the distribution of the phases in the channel. This method 

consists in recognizing the hydrodynamic conditions that lead to several 

flow patterns and proposes individual models for each flow regime to 

predict pressure losses and liquid hold up.  

As for the mechanistic models, Taitel and Dukler (1976) 

presented the first formulation for the transition between the five basic 

flow patterns in horizontal flow: stratified smooth, stratified wavy, 

intermittent, annular dispersed and dispersed bubble. Following that, 

there have been several efforts to determine the dependence of the flow 

pattern on component volume fluxes, volume fraction and the fluid 

properties such as density, viscosity, and surface tension, for both 

vertical and horizontal tubes (ANSARI, 1994; GOMEZ, 1999; HASAN 

and KABIR, 1999; ZHANG et al, 2006). The results are often displayed 

in the form of a flow regime map, which identifies the flow patterns 

occurring in various parts of a parameter space defined, for instance, by 

the superficial phase velocities or momentum fluxes. 

Briefly explaining, in order of increasing complexity, the 

homogeneous model assumes no slippage between the phases and 

makes no distinction between flow patterns. The separated flow model 

considers different phase velocities (slip) and requires an additional 

equation for the void fraction. However, it does not consider explicitly 

different flow patterns. Mechanistic models incorporate mathematical 

relationships for the transition between flow patterns in addition to 

governing equations for each specific flow pattern.  

The first wellbore multiphase flow model developments date 

back to 1930s. Early investigators developed very limited methods of 

multiphase flow through vertical pipes as to their range of applications 

(VERSLUYS, 1930; MOORE and WILDE, 1931; MOORE and 

SCHILTHUIS, 1933; GOSLINE, 1936; MAY, 1935). Only in the 

1950s, the first empirical or semi-empirical models widely applicable in 

the oil industry were proposed. Poettmann &amp;amp; Carpenter (1952) 



46 

 

developed the first general method for predicting the pressure profile in 

oil and gas wells and in gas lift vertical wells under steady state 

conditions, considering the flowing fluid as a single homogeneous 

phase. This semi-empirical model was based in field data of 49 wells 

operating over a wide range of conditions. Later, Baxendell &amp;amp; Thomas 

(1961) proposed a new method to estimate the pressure profile in oil 

wells for high flow rate scenarios based on the methodology provided 

by Poettmann and Carpenter (1952).  

Fauncher and Brown (1963) developed a separated flow friction-

correlation based model. Duns and Ross (1963) also provided a 

separated flow model. This model, which was based on experimental 

work, showed good agreement for all range of tested conditions. 

Hagedorn and Brown (1965) developed a separated flow 

friction/holdup-correlation model based on experimental work. The 

model was validated with several field data showing a very good 

agreement for the whole range of conditions.  

Brill et al. (1966) provided a model combining the use of vertical 

and horizontal correlations for determining the maximum flow rate 

possible from both flowing and gas lift wells. Mukherjee and Brill 

(1983) developed experimental correlations for multiphase flow in 

vertical and inclined pipes.  

In the last ten years, several coupled thermal multiphase flow 

models in wellbores were developed (AMARA et al., 2006; IZGEC et 

al., 2007; POURAFSHARY et al., 2007; HU et al., 2007; LIVESCU et 
al., 2008; LIVESCU et al., 2009; SHIRDEL and SEPEHRNOORI, 

2009; PAN and OLDENBURG, 2014; FOROUZANFAR et al., 2015), 

with the ultimate goal providing a coupled wellbore/reservoir solution. 

Some of these studies focused on the determination of the pressure and 

temperature profile of the production stream, emphasizing the local heat 

and pressure loss in the interface wellbore-formation in a vertical, 

deviated and/or horizontal well. 

2.1.2 Heat transfer models in wellbores 

The wellbore is essentially a multi-layer cylindrical system with a 

multi-mode radial heat transfer between the wellbore fluid and the 

surrounding formation (HASAN and KABIR, 2002), as depicted in 

Figure 2.3 for production through a single string (SHOUSHTARI et al., 

2012 after INCROPERA et al., 2007). 
 



47 

 

 

 
Figure 2.3 – Wellbore architecture as a thermal resistance network. 

 

For such configuration, the overall heat transfer coefficient (based 

on the tubing external surface heat exchange area) can be defined by the 

following expression (HASAN and KABIR, 2012): 

 
 

   
 

   
       

 
      (      ? )

  
 

   
    (     )

 
      (      ? )

  
 

      (      ? )

    
   

(2.1) 

 

which can be modified by adding or removing thermal resistances to 

adapt the thermal circuit to a particular situation. It should be noted that 

in Eq. 2.1 the interfacial contact resistances were neglected. In addition 

to the conduction from the inner radius,    , to the wellbore radius (outer 
radius),    , the composite system approach takes into account the 
internal and external convective heat transfer represented by the first and 

the third terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 2.1, where     is the outer 
radius of the tubing,     is the inner radius of the casing and     is the 
outer radius of the casing. 



48 

 

The first heat transfer studies that attempted to estimate the 

wellbore fluid temperatures were proposed by Lesem et al. (1957) and 

Moss and White (1959) for long-time water injection operations, and 

with the ultimate target of improving oil recovery. The classical work of 

Ramey (1962) can be considered a landmark in the field, being used as 

the reference for major works until today. In his study, Ramey (1962) 

proposed a transient 1-D approximate solution to predict the temperature 

of fluids, tubing and casings as a function of depth and 

production/injection time. The single string wellbore is considered as a 

vertical cylindrical heat source that loses heat to the surrounding 

formation, which, in turn, is treated as a homogeneous semi-infinite 

solid. Boundary conditions include a known flow rate and a surface or a 

bottomhole temperature, besides considering a vanishingly small well 

radius and a prescribed temperature at the formation. The so-called 

formation temperature is the geothermal (undisturbed) temperature, i.e., 

a function of depth. Ramey modeled the rock formation using the one-

dimensional heat diffusion equation: 

 

     

   
 

 

 

    

  
 

        

   

    

  
   (2.2) 

 

where     is the formation temperature,    , is the formation density, 

     , is the formation specific heat and    , is the thermal conductivity 

of the formation. Thus, the formation thermal diffusivity is defined as 

 

    
         

   
   (2.3) 

 

The boundary conditions applied to Eq. 2.2 considering a radial 

symmetry are given by 

 

,

   |            
    
  

|       
 (2.4) 

 

Ramey (1962) applied the solution of transient heat diffusion 

available in Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) for a constant heat flux 

cylindrical heat source, for which the interface temperature between 

wellbore and formation shows a log-linear behavior for long production 



49 

 

 

times (high Fourier number). The solution is based on a transient 

diffusion temperature function,  ( ), which can be related to the heat 
transfer rate from the flowing fluid to the formation using the following 

equation as 

 

   
     (         )  

 ( )
   (2.5) 

 

where     represents the wellbore/formation interface temperature and 
is defined as 

 

    
(         )  (         ( )    )

    (         ( ))
    (2.6) 

 

      represents the initial formation temperature (defined by the 

formation geothermal gradient) and the transient temperature function is 

rewritten as 

 

 ( )    
?    

   
          (2.7) 

 

where     is the formation thermal diffusivity,     is the wellbore radius 

and the dimensionless time function,   ,which represents the transient 
diffusion time,  , as follows 

  

   
     

   
    (2.8) 

 

It is important to restate that Eq. 2.7 is valid only for production 

times longer than 7 days according to Ramey (1962). Although useful 

for estimating wellbore temperatures during injection of hot fluid, the 

calculation method is based on many assumptions. For instance, it does 

not take into account phase change during the fluid flow, which has 

been corrected by Satter (1967), who included steam condensation 

during the calculations. 

Willhite (1967) proposed a procedure to quantify the overall heat 

transfer coefficient based on the radial thermal resistances of each 

different layer in the wellbore, which was assumed known until then. To 

estimate the annuli natural convection coefficients, Willhite suggested 



50 

 

using results from the study of Dropkin &amp;amp; Sommerscales (1965) about 

natural convection heat transfer between enclosed vertical plates, 

assuming that the annuli curvatures were negligible. The radiative heat 

transfer coefficient was determined from Stefan-Boltzmann’s Law, 

considering an infinite concentric annulus. 

Ramey (1962) and Willhite (1967) pointed out that heat 

transmission from wellbores to the formation never actually reaches 

steady state, since a quasi-steady state is attained in which the rate of 

heat transfer per unit length monotonically decreases as a function of 

time. The dimensionless time function,   , proposed by Ramey, is a 
measure of how fast the rock formation conducts heat away from the 

wellbore. The overall heat transfer coefficient is time dependent, 

reflecting the variable effective thermal resistance of the rock formation. 

Raymond (1969) developed one of the first fully-transient models for 

wellbore heat transfer. This method was later improved with an 

advanced algorithm for the solution of the discretized equations 

(MARSHALL and BENTSEN, 1982).  

Eickmeier et al. (1970) proposed a finite difference model to 

investigate transient wellbore temperatures during early times of 

injection or production (low Fourier numbers). The model considers 

many assumptions, such as constant heat transfer coefficient and thermal 

properties. Squier et al. (1970) provided an exact solution for early time 

injection of hot fluid into the reservoir. Again, strong assumptions were 

applied in the model that such as neglecting any thermal resistance in 

the wellbore. 

After Kirkpatrick (1959), Shiu and Beggs (1980) proposed an 

empirical method for predicting temperature profiles in two-phase 

flowing wells based on field data from 270 wells. Xiao (1987) 

developed a simple equation for estimating the temperature profile of a 

flowing fluid in the wellbore considering many severe assumptions, 

such as constant fluid and solid properties. Yet, the results showed good 

agreement with field data from 14 onshore wells. 

Wu and Pruess (1990) presented an analytical approach to solve 

the wellbore heat transfer in a layered formation with different thermal 

properties without introducing the simplifications of Ramey (1962), 

namely, neglecting the transient term in the heat balance in the tubing 

and ignoring temperature history effects on the heat losses. For this 

reason, Ramey’s method is suitable for simulating the heat transfer only 

for long periods (high Fourier numbers). 

Sagar et al. (1991) developed a method based on Coulter and 

Bardon’s (1970) model that incorporated Ramey's and Willhite's heat 



51 

 

 

transfer mechanisms for wellbore with multiphase flow, while taking 

into account the kinetic energy and the Joule-Thompson expansion. The 

model, developed with temperature field data from 392 wells, assumes 

steady state heat transfer in the wellbore. Later, Alves et al. (1992), 

based on the same studies, i.e. Coulter and Bardon (1970) and Ramey 

(1962), developed a unified equation for predicting flowing temperature 

profiles in wellbores for the entire range of inclinations. In this work, 

they applied more rigorously assumptions regarding the thermodynamic 

behavior of the flowing fluid – for instance, the Joule-Thompson effect 

was properly accounted for.   

Again, turning attention to the heat loss to the rock formation, 

Chiu &amp;amp; Thakur (1991) developed a semi-analytical model, which can 

determine the heat losses from deviated wells. The model provided a 

new transient diffusion dimensionless time function  

  

 ( )         (        )  (2.9) 
 

and assumed steady state heat transfer in the wellbore. 

Hasan &amp;amp; Kabir (1991) used a rigorous model based on the 

solution of the partial differential equation resulting from an energy 

balance on the formation. The solution was carried out using the Laplace 

Transform for a constant heat flow from the wellbore to the formation. 

A variation on the heat flow along the production time can be added to 

the model applying the principle of superposition. Furthermore, the 

authors proposed a new transient diffusion temperature function and 

compared the two solutions with those from Ramey’s model. The 

approximate solution presented good agreement with the rigorous one 

for very low and high Fourier numbers. For the case that the 

dimensionless time meets values between 0.01 and 5, the dimensionless 

temperature deviates by 6%.  

Hasan and Kabir (1994) proposed a new procedure to estimate 

the overall heat transfer coefficient adapting Willhite’s work, by 

developing a novel correlation for the natural convection heat transfer 

coefficient and neglecting the thermal resistance due to the flowing 

fluid. The correlation was proposed based on an adaptation of the 

Dropkin and Somerscales (1965) relationship for natural convection 

between parallel plates (5 x 10

Hasan et al. (1996) and Kabir et al. (1996) developed a 

generalized analytical model capable of predicting the circulating fluid 

temperature during drilling, workover and well control operations. 

Hasan et al. (1997) proposed a non-isothermal wellbore model coupled 

to an analytical reservoir approach. 

An extension of the Ramey’s wellbore heat transfer method, also 

applicable to the early stages of formation heating process (small 

Fourier numbers), was proposed by Hagoort (2004). Cheng et al. (2011) 

developed a new formation heat transfer model taking into account the 

wellbore heat capacity and, so a new analytical transient heat conduction 

temperature function was proposed.

where   is the ratio of the formation heat capacity and the wellbore heat 
capacity as follows: 

 

  
(   )  

(   )  

 (2.12) 

 

They observed that the wellbore heat capacity has a considerable 

influence on the transient diffusion time function, mainly for short time 

steam injection. Moreover, they found that the new analytical time 

function depends on the dimensionless time and the ratio between the 

formation heat capacity and the wellbore heat capacity. Later, Nian et al. 

(2014) compared the most traditional  ( ) functions with the one 
proposed by Cheng (2011). The results were validated with field data 

showing the importance of the wellbore heat capacity on the accuracy of 

the heat loss to the formation. 

Bahonar et al. (2009) proposed a 2-D heat diffusion numerical 
model to deal with the formation transient heat transfer, aiming to 

estimate oil recovery with steam injection. One year later, Bahonar et al. 
(2010) compared several formation temperature treatment approaches 

(two numerical and three analytical approaches) and showed that the 2-

D numerical model can better predict casing and interface temperatures 

especially at the top and bottom well boundaries. 



53 

 

 

Recently, Xiong et al. (2015) proposed a new correlation to 

account for the natural convection in the annulus, based on a FLUENT 

CFD study, expressed as

Simulations were performed in steady-state using typical 

approaches used to deal with natural convection between two long 

cylinders, as shown in Figure 2.4. The maximum mismatch error 

between the correlation proposed and the CFD results was 6.7%. 

However, for the other approaches performed this error was larger than 

100% in some cases.

convection heat transfer (Xiong et al., 2015). 

 

2.1.3 Tubular and Formation Mechanical Models 

Concerning the mechanical approaches used to assess the 

wellbore integrity, Klementich and Jellison (1986) were one of the first 

authors to develop a more robust stress analysis of the wellbore. Based 

on the widely accepted criterion for yielding of ductile, homogeneous 



54 

 

and isotropic materials, the Henky-von Mises theory, the mathematical 

statement of this theory considers that the expressions for the hoop and 

radial stresses are derived from Lamé’s equations for stresses in a thick-

walled cylinder. Hence, the change in hoop strain,    , is calculated 
using Hooke’s law as follows:  

 

    
[      (       )]

 
       (2.14) 

 

where   is the Young’s modulus
1
,   is the Poisson’s ratio

2
,   is 

coefficient of linear thermal expansion,      and     are the radial and 
hoop stresses and     is the axial stress, calculated according to the 
local geometric configuration of the wellbore. 

From there, the American Petroleum Institute (API) provided a 

set of formulas and calculations for wellbore tubulars aiming to 

standardize the stress-loading analysis (API Bulletin 5C3, 1989). Adams 

and MacEachran (1991) extended the work of Klementich and Jellison 

(1986) for a multilayer casing wellbore scenario, namely the multistring 

model. Using a multistring approach means that the annuli are 

interrelated, so the deformation of an annulus will affect the other ones. 

Thus, the annular volume variation due to the fluid expansion and 

tubular deformation assuming radial symmetry and homogeneous 

isotropic properties of each annulus present in the wellbore can be 

calculated as follows: 

 

     ?[(   
        )  (   

        )]        (2.15) 

 

where    and    are the outer and inner radii of the annulus, respectively; 
while    denotes the variation of the radius of each tubular wall.     is 
the volume change due to annulus axial dimensions variation resulting 

from expansion or contraction of annulus walls. 

Halal and Mitchell (1994) proposed a model for multilayer string 

that accounted for the interaction between axial stresses and heat up

 Young’s Modulus – also known as the elastic modulus, is a measure of 

elasticity, equal to the ratio of the stress acting on a material to the strain 

produced.

  Poisson’s ratio – is the signed ratio of transverse strain to axial strain. In 

other words, is the amount of transversal expansion divided by the amount 

of axial compression, for small values of these changes.

pressures, and that included the effects of nonlinear fluid behavior as a 

function of temperature, pressure, and composition. The authors 

considered two different scenarios to compute    , cemented and 
uncemented intervals, as depicted in Figure 2.5. Also, a 

cement/formation interface section is also illustrated. 

For uncemented intervals that are fixed at both ends (i.e. casing 

hanger and TOC),     is a function of the pressure variation and the 
fluid densities, besides the mechanical properties and geometric 

characteristics as follows:

(2.16) 

 

 
Figure 2.5 – Wellbore arrangements: (a) cemented interval, (b) 

cement/formation interface (modified from Halal and Mitchell, 1994). 

 

When an annulus is formed between cemented tube walls 

(cemented interval), then     is obtained from the condition that each 
point is axially fixed, in other words,      , which yields: 

 

    
  (             )

(       )
           (2.17) 

 

Finally, to close the equation system, the variation in hoop strain 

at the cement/formation interface evaluated for the formation assumes 

the form: 

  

    
(     )     

   
    (2.18) 



56 

 

 

where     denotes the pressure variation at the cement/formation 
interface and     and     are the formation mechanical properties.  

Halal and Mitchell (1994) suggested a matrix formulation to deal 

with the continuity of the stress distribution between the solids in order 

to estimate the volumetric annulus variation. The pressure distribution at 

each interface between the different wellbore elements was performed 

adopting a tridiagonal matrix algorithm. The integrated model 

predictions were compared with results from single-string analyses 

demonstrating the strong interaction between casing strings. 

Oudeman and Bacarreza (1995) evaluated the effect of the 

formation response on the wellbore in the particular case where the 

inner casing was not cemented into the shoe of the outer casing. In this 

scenario, the fluid leak off to the formation drives the pressure build up 

behavior. Later, Oudeman and Kerem (2006) developed an experimental 

method to predict the pressure increase behavior in confined annuli 

under transient conditions. The method was able to provide some 

insights about the annulus build up pressure over time.   

 Sathuvalli et al. (2005) advanced a more rigorous model 

including the role of formation elasticity on the APB, considering the 

rock formation as an elastic foundation. In this case, the cement sheath 

outside the casing was treated as part of the formation due to the fact 

that the elastic constants were on same order of magnitude. Hence, this 

approach avoids an additional unknown quantity, i.e. the pressure 

changes in the formation near the wellbore, which arose from the Halal 

and Mitchell (1994) approach.   

Recently, Hafemann et al. (2015) adopted the same multistring 

approach to predict the interface pressures using the GMRES 

(generalized Minimal Residual) method to solve the resulting system of 

linear equations. Barcelos et al. (2017) improved Hafemann’s model 

assuming that each annulus behaves as a pressure vessel. As the mass in 

each annulus does not change, considering that annuli are fully closed, 

after running the thermal model, the resulting annulus average 

temperature is used to compute the pressure variation due to the fluid 

expansion.

2.2 APB Behavior Prediction and Field History 

As previously discussed, annular pressure buildup (APB) can be 

understood as the increase in pressure due to thermal expansion of fluids 

confined in one or more annuli within a wellbore.  However, a more 

general definition of APB is provided by the Global Standards from the 

International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) in 2010 (API 

STD 65 – Part 2): 

 

“Pressure generated within a sealed annulus by thermal 

expansion of trapped wellbore fluids typically during production. May 

also occur during drilling operations when trapped annular fluids at 
cool shallow depths are exposed to high temperatures from fluids 

circulating in deep, hot hole sections. This thermally induced pressure is 

defined and listed in API RP 90 as thermal casing pressure. APB is also 
referred to as annular fluid expansion (AFE)”. 

 

Due to the increase in the APB scenarios in the last years with the 

development of extreme water depths and hole depth in many modern 

offshore wells, IADC proposed a new definition of APB (API RP 96): 

 

“Pressure generated within an annulus by thermal expansion of 
wellbore fluids, typically during production”.  

 

However, two notes followed the definition: the first one is that 

the APB can also occur during drilling operations when trapped annular 

fluids at cool shallow depths are exposed to high temperatures induced 

by fluids circulating from deep, hot hole sections. This thermally 

induced pressure is defined and listed in API RP 90 as thermal casing 

pressure. The second one stated that the APB can also occur from 

migration of formation fluids, as defined in API RP 90. 

Although there is a vast literature on the physics of APB 

(ADAMS and MACEACHRAN, 1991; BELLARBY, 2009, 

HAFEMANN 2015), and most theoretical aspects has been explored 

(HALAL and MITCHELL, 1994; SATHUVALLI et al., 2005; 
OUDEMAN and KEREM, 2006; HASAN and KABIR 2012; YIN and 

GAO, 2014, HAFEMANN, 2015) there is still lack of a comprehensive 

approach that accurately predicts the multilayer APB magnitude.  



58 

 

According to Sathuvalli et al. (2016), the boundary conditions 

and the fluid thermo behavior determine the type and the stiffness
3
 of 

the wellbore annuli. The pressure increase is essentially the outcome of 

how each wellbore annulus behaves as heat is transferred from the 

flowing fluid to the formation, and how each annulus mechanically 

reacts when subjected to this thermal effect. 

Changes in the containment volume alleviate the annular pressure 

due to ballooning or reverse ballooning, and thermal dilation/contraction 

of the casing strings. The pressure in the annulus may also be reduced 

by bleeding the inner fluid from the annulus at the wellhead or leaking 

through the formation bellow an open casing shoe, as seen in Figure 2.6 

(BELLARBY, 2009). 

 

 
Figure 2.6 – Determining factors of the APB (BELLARBY, 2009). 

 

Despite beliefs that open shoes can ensure annular fluid bleed off 

(PELIANO et al., 2014), some authors claim that the sedimentation of 
solids in the drilling fluids creates a non-permeable layer above on top 

of cement that prevents fluid flow to the formation (ZAMORA and 

BELL, 2004; OMLAND, 2009).   

                                                             
3
 Stiffness – The annulus stiffness is a measure of the expected pressure 

increase in the annulus fluid per unit increase of temperature (Sathuvalli et 

al. (2016). 



59 

 

 

APB can be quantified by the following equation (Eq. 2.19), 

which relates the change in pressure to changes in the mass of the 

confined fluid, volume and temperature of the annulus (OUDEMAN and 

BACAREZZA, 1995): 

 

   (
  

  
*
   

    (
  

  
*
   

    (
  

  
*
   

     (2.19) 

  

where the first term represents a change in pressure due to fluid leakage 

to the formation, the second term represents the change in pressure 

caused by changes in annulus containment that is induced by thermal or 

hydraulic loads on the tubing/casing and the third one represents the 

increase in pressure as the temperature increases assuming a constant 

volume. After manipulation, Eq. 2.19 can be rewritten in the following 

form (OUDEMAN and KEREM, 2006): 

 

   
   

     
 

  

    
 

     

  
    (2.20) 

 

where    is the fluid compressibility coefficient,    is the fluid volume 

in the annular space,   is the annulus volume, and    is the thermal 

expansion coefficient of the annulus fluid. 

According to Oudeman and Kerem (2006), in a sealed annular, 

the third term is usually dominant and the second term is on the order of 

10 to 20% of the third term. Hasan and Kabir (2009) stated that the third 

term or pressure increase caused by liquid expansion accounts for well 

over 80% of the total APB in most cases. Halal &amp;amp; Mitchell (1994) claim 

that neglecting the second term most likely will lead in a non-reliable 

calculation. 

In a fully trapped annular, the first term in Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 can 

be neglected since the amount of annular liquid fluid does not change. 

Thus, the APB depends basically on the two last terms of Equation 2.20. 

By knowing the magnitude of the fluid volume change and the 

mechanical response of the annular to pressure and temperature changes, 

the magnitude of APB in one or more annuli can be calculated. Bellarby 

(2009) named the limit load in the annulus as MAASP – Maximum 

Allowable Annular Surface Pressure, which can be related to the tubular 

collapse or burst resistance.  

Even though the root cause of the problem arises from a thermal 

process, the outcome is strictly structural, hence, the importance of 



60 

 

developing a comprehensive multiphysics model to deal with it. While 

conceptually simple, there are huge challenges concerning the APB 

quantification. In fact, the level of accuracy of an APB model depends 

strongly on each of its constituting models, the assumptions regarding 

fluid and formation properties and the numerical mesh size. Sathuvalli et 

al. (2005) stated that most industry standard wellbore thermal simulators 
included an uncertainty of at least ± 3 K and another source of 

uncertainty came from the fluid thermal physical properties calculation.  

Recent works attempted to estimate APB both analytically and 

numerically. Many assumptions have been stated making the solution 

method less accurate, such as: use of single-phase flow model, steady 

state condition, use of constant thermophysical properties, neglecting the 

deformation of tubes, disregard the wellbore thermal capacity to 

quantify the  ( ) function, among others.  
Hasan et al. (2010) presented two approaches to estimate the 

APB assuming a transient and a quasi-steady formulation to model the 

heat transfer in the wellbore. However, both models disregarded the 

structural changes in the wellbore due to the deformation of the tubes. 

Alcofra (2014) developed a wellbore thermal model that considered a 

multistring approach to deal with annuli volume and pressure changes 

due to heat transmission from a single-phase oil flow under steady state 

condition.  

Hafemann (2015) developed a numerical approach that overcame 

several limitations encountered in previous models, including: 

? a steady-state flow pattern-based multiphase flow model; 

? a compositional model to calculate the changes in hydrocarbon 
properties; 

? a transient heat transfer model that used a  ( ) function based 
on the heat capacity of the wellbore; 

? a multistring approach to deal with annuli volume and pressure 
change; 

? variable thermodynamic properties of the annular fluids; 

? different types of rock formations. 
 

Even though the work of Hafemann et al. (2015) has shown 
meaningful advances with respect to the thermo-hydraulic coupling and 

the structural modeling of the wellbore, it was only in the subsequent 

work of Barcelos et al. (2017) that a practical way of calculating APB 

was successfully implemented. In the latter study, a new approach was 

proposed based on the formulation of Oudeman and Kerem (2004) that 



61 

 

 

considered each annulus is treated as an integral volume (pressure vessel 

approach), so that the pressure change in the annulus caused by local 

volume variation is assumed to be transmitted throughout each annulus 

instantly. In other words, despite computing local volume deformations, 

the increase in pressure was calculated for entire annulus and updated 

every time step.  

  

2.3 APB Mitigation 

APB issues are dealt with carefully, depending on the scenario. 

Managing procedures and/or mitigation techniques are often required as 

reported by Nelson (2002). Accidents arising from pressure increase in 

annulus are essentially a consequence of an unsuitable well design 

caused by a thermal behavior that was not anticipated and/or an 

undersized equipment application. The consequences can be 

catastrophic, ranging from well losses and severe environmental damage 

to the loss of human lives.  

In onshore wells and offshore platforms, the “Christmas tree” is 

able to alleviate the annulus pressure by bleeding off through the surface 

accessible wellhead equipment. However, in subsea offshore wells, the 

primary annulus formed by the tubing and production casing is the only 

one accessible. All other annuli are sealed and do not allow bleeding 

(VARGO et al., 2003; WILLIAMSON et al., 2003).  

Based on the above, two conditions are required for the APB 

phenomenon to take place: an increase in temperature due to 

hydrocarbon production and the presence of sealed annulus filled by 

packer/drilling fluid. While pressure buildup in the annular is a common 

occurrence, regardless whether the annulus is sealed or not, casing 

failure will only occur if the annulus is confined and the pressure 

increase exceeds the casing mechanical resistance. This condition is 

commonly present in all subsea producing wells, but it is most evident 

in deepwater environments. Deepwater wells are more vulnerable to 

APB because of the cold seafloor temperatures (below 280 K), which 

contrast with the high subsea wellhead temperatures that commonly 

range from 340 to 400 K during hydrocarbon production. 
In order to avoid the tube collapse, several strategies are 

commonly used to mitigate APB as reviewed in (PATTILLO, 2011; 

MOE and ERPELDING, 2000; WILLIAMSON et al., 2003). For 
instance, the following equation presented by Ellis et al. (2004) 



62 

 

describes the important parameters that can be varied in the design of a 

well to reduce APB, considering the annular space as a rigid container: 

 

   (
           

  
)  

 

  
    (2.21) 

 

where    is the annulus pressure variation,    is the fluid thermal 

expansion coefficient,    is the temperature variation,    is the initial 
volume of the fluid,    is the volume change and    is the fluid 

compressibility coefficient. Equation 2.21 shows that fluid properties 

and change in volume and temperature are important parameters to 

control the APB. In fact, the change in volume depends on the fluid 

properties, which in turn also affects the heat transfer process and the 

temperature difference.  

The many alternatives to avoid well failure due to APB were 

classified below according to their working principle: 

? Enhanced tubular design: this strategy focuses on the increase 
in casing capability to accommodate a higher pressure level 

buildup without a negative effect on the wellbore. Several 

studies provide advances in probabilistic performance 

properties of tubulars and so, upgrade the tubing and casing to 

withstand the loads (ROSLAND et al., 2013; 

SHAHREYARAND and FINLEY, 2014). 

? Annulus flexibility: the objective here is to create a preferred 
leak path or bleed port. Casing rupture-disk technology allows a 

casing design to fail in a predictable condition. The disk is set 

in the casing and the wellbore is designed to vent outward 

rather than collapse inward. Extensive testing and design 

optimization of rupture disks have been performed associated 

with this application (VARGO et al., 2003; SANTOS et al. 
2015). A rougher, but efficient strategy one may treat the casing 

perforating a hole to relieve the pressure to a non-permeable 

zone or even drill a hole at the wellhead with a world class 

ROV
4
 and special tools, allowing the expanded fluid escape to 

the sea (DOS SANTOS et al. 2012).

 ROV – Remotely operated underwater vehicle is a submersible vehicle 

remotely operated by a person onboard in a drilling rig. It is used to conduct 

and supervise operations in deep water environments.  



63 

 

 

? Controlling gained volume: the purpose of this alternative is to 
control the expanded volume by the trapped fluid as heating 

occurs. There are three ways to do this: the first one is the use 

of compressible fluids with a relatively small amount of 

nitrogen to absorb enough liquid volume expansion to prevent 

casing failure. Another option is using a spacer fluid that 

shrinks with increasing temperature (BLOYS et al., 2007). The 

third one deals with attaching crushable foam wrap to the outer 

casing wall (SATHUVALLI et al., 2005). The syntactic foam 
consists of hollow thin-walled glass microspheres composed of 

sodium borosilicate glass and filled with air at atmospheric 

pressure. When the annular pressure reaches a certain value, the 

hollow spheres collapse generating an extra volume in the 

annular space and preventing further pressure increase from 

expansion. 

? Application of insulation materials: this strategy aims to reduce 
the radial heat transfer from the production string to the annuli. 

The insulation can be the annular fluid such as the drilling 

and/or packer fluid or insulated tubes, for instance, the vacuum 

insulated tubing (VIT). VIT systems are better used in scenarios 

that require high insulation capacity. However, many 

drawbacks and uncertainties follow the VIT application. Low 

thermal conductivity aqueous-based packer fluids have been 

used in less severe APB scenarios in deepwater environments 

(JAVORA et al., 2002; ERIKSEN et al., 2014). Osgouei et al. 
(2014) proposed a set of guidelines to improve the insulation 

performance of annular fluids (drilling fluids) based on its 

rheological behavior.  

Sathuvalli et al. (2005) developed a screening procedure and a 

computational tool to allow an examination of operational scenarios and 

identification of the key parameters that control the APB phenomenon. 

Santos et al. (2015) offered a good explanation about the several APB 

mitigation techniques, outlining design procedures and illustrating 

guidelines for application scenarios. 

   

2.4 VIT Basics 

The VIT technique consists of an inner production tubing welded 

to an outer tube at both ends, forming an annular cavity that is evacuated 



64 

 

(see Figure 2.7), with the aim of minimizing the radial heat transfer 

(AZZOLA et al., 2007). 

 

 
Figure 2.7 – VIT connection details. 

 

The manufacturing process of vacuum insulated tubes was 

described by Bellarby (2009) as follows: before the tubings are welded, 

a port is drilled in the outer tubing and an absorbent is added to the 

space. Once welded, the space between the tubes is evacuated, heated to 

activate the absorbent, filled with argon and then evacuated again. 

Finally, a vacuum plug is installed. However, there is a short section, 

typically between 0.15 and 0.25 m at each coupling, which does not 

have a cavity to be evacuated. Since the junction between every two 

tubes is not insulated, heat transfer can be significant at this location. 

This section has a more serious impact on the overall heat loss than its 

relative length as reported by Pattillo et al. (2004). Convection cells 
build up above each connection, transporting heat away from the 

connection. 

VIT systems can be manufactured according to different material 

and dimensional specifications. Typical ranges of overall tubing length, 



65 

 

 

coupling length, tubing diameters and tubing material of commercial 

VIT systems are shown in Table 2.1. 

  
Table 2.1 – Typical dimensions of commercial VIT systems 

Overall length 6.096 to 12.192 m 

Coupling length 0.2540 to 0.1461 m 

Outer tubing external diameter 
0.178 to 0.089 m                        

(7 to 3 ½ in) 

Inner tubing internal diameter 
0.140 to 0.060 m                       

(5 ½ to 2 3/8 in) 

 

If the connections are effectively insulated, the equivalent thermal 

conductivity of VIT can be excellent, reducing by more than 60% the 

heat loss rate through the connection. This benefit can be reached using 

a PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) or thin film (a modified liquid epoxy 

coating) multilayer insulation (HORN and LIVELY, 2001), inside 

and/or outside the tubings, depending on the welding configuration. 

Overall conductivities will depend on the connection insulation, annular 

fluids and soil properties (AZZOLA et al., 2004). There are advantages 

and disadvantages of each VIT configuration, as shown in Figure 2.8, 

relating mainly to cost, strength and quality control (BELLARBY, 

2009). Thus, it should be noted that the VIT joints are stacked 

(connected) one above the other until reaching the depth that it is desired 

to reduce the radial heat transfer. 

Despite the many years of experience on well insulation 

technologies applied to oil and gas production, the technical literature on 

VIT systems is still somewhat limited, with many unanswered questions 

concerning its thermal performance, applicability and most relevant 

physical mechanisms. For instance, aspects related to the effective 

thermal conductivity, heat loss through the connection and main body, 

and the impact of the vacuum level on thermal performance, need to be 

properly quantified before VIT systems become consolidated in 

Brazilian offshore wells. 

Furthermore, VIT systems are expensive, heavy, take up a 
significant portion of the annular space and require high-strength 

tubulars due to high stresses on the tubular bodies and welds 

(BELLARBY, 2009; JAVORA et al., 2002; EZELL et al., 2010). Due 
to operational, engineering and cost constraints, the VIT joints are often 

combined with bare tubings. Typically, VIT joints are installed from the 



66 

 

mudline to a chosen depth, which depends on the wellbore architecture 

and thermal and mechanical requirements (SATHUVALLI et al., 2016). 

 

 
Figure 2.8 – VIT configurations (BELLARBY, 2009). 

 

2.4.1 The k-value (U-value) concept 

For simplicity, the petroleum industry has successfully adopted a 

single value to characterize the VIT insulation performance, which has 

been called k-value, an equivalent thermal conductivity of the VIT 
system (FEENEY, 1997; AZZOLA et al., 2004; AZZOLA et al., 2007; 

SINGH et al., 2005; FERREIRA et al., 2012; YUE et al., 2013; 

KARRA et al., 2014; AL SHAIBI, 2015), despite understanding that the 

actual k-value may vary along the length of the VIT. In fact, the VIT’s 



67 

 

 

k-value and/or U-value (equivalent overall heat transfer coefficient of 

the VIT) depends on the boundary conditions and may vary with annular 

fluid types and soil properties (AZZOLA et al., 2004). 
It will be shown later in this section that the k-value has a 

somewhat broader meaning than the thermal conductivity. While the 

latter is a physical property of a given material, the k-value concept is 

used in the oil industry to quantify an equivalent thermal conductance 

(per unit length) of interconnected heat transfer processes between a 

given temperature difference. Although its definition is very similar to 

that of the overall heat transfer coefficient, U, the k-value is the quantity 

used as a thermal performance indicator in wellbore thermal flow 

simulators (Wellcat™, OLGA
®

). 

The main issue regarding the application of a single value of 

equivalent thermal conductivity to represent the thermal behavior of a 

VIT joint is that it frequently misrepresents the multidimensional nature 

of the temperature and heat transfer behavior in the connection section. 

Since the temperature distribution in the solid regions of the VIT in the 

vicinity of the connection section are affected by the local thermal 

conductances in the surrounding domains (e.g., natural convection and 

the radiation in the annuli, forced convection in the production tubing), 

the k-value becomes very much dependent on the well operating 

conditions. As a result, wellbore completion designers often consider 

high k-values in their completion projects to meet conservative pressure 

increase estimates in their APB calculations. 

 

2.4.2 VIT thermal models 

For a better description of the heat transfer in VIT systems, their 

geometry is usually divided into two parts: the VIT body and the 

connection. The VIT body consists basically of the two concentric tubes 

and the vacuum space, forming a thermally insulated region, through 

which the heat transfer rate per unit length is designed to be minimal. 

The second part is the connection between the two VIT bodies. In this 

section, there is no vacuum and, therefore, the heat loss to the 

surrounding environment is expected to be much higher. Azzola et al. 
(2004) presented the heat paths through the VIT, as illustrated in Figure 

2.9. 
 



68 

 

 
Figure 2.9 – Heat fluxes (arrows) in the VIT body and connection sections 

(modified from Azzola et al., 2004). 

 

Three different heat fluxes can be associated with the VIT 

system, as shown in Figure 2.9.      is the radial heat flux through the 
vacuum space,      is the radial heat flux through the connection and 
     is the axial heat flux through the tube walls. Given the high thermal 
resistance offered by the vacuum and the high thermal conductivity of 

the steel tubes, the axial conduction heat flux      is created, allowing 
heat to travel from the inner tube wall towards the weld, then through 

the weld and back towards the VIT’s outer tube. The preferred path 

followed by the heat flux leads to a high heat loss through the 

connection by convection to the external environment. Figure 2.10 

highlights such phenomenon and shows the behavior of the radial heat 

flux and the external temperature of the VIT surface as a function of the 

distance from the center of the connection (PATTILLO et al., 2003). 
 



69 

 

 

 
Figure 2.10 – Radial heat flux and VIT outer surface temperature under forced 

convection (Pattillo et al., 2003). 
 

Azzola et al. (2004) developed an analytical model to assess the 

VIT thermal performance. They assumed that      was governed by the 
radiation thermal resistance in the vacuum space. Additionally, since the 

conduction thermal resistance in the tube wall is much lower than the 

outside VIT connection thermal resistance,      is assumed to depend 
only on the outside VIT connection thermal resistance (convection). On 

the other hand, it is not straightforward to determine     , since the heat 
flux is directly affected by the size of the hot zone around the weld, 

which, in turn, is directly dependent on the magnitude of the convective 

heat loss through this region. Azzola et al. (2004) computed this heat 

flux through an analogy with an extended surface formulation 

considering an adiabatic-tip fin, which is a function of    (convection 
heat transfer coefficient of the fluid surrounding the fin),      (thermal 

conductivity of the fin) and the fin geometry. Hence, the fin thermal 

resistance itself is: 

 

         (         )  (2.22) 

 



70 

 

Although the heat transfer in the VIT shares some similarities 

with an extended surface, the VIT performance is also a function of the 

vacuum equivalent thermal conductivity. Thus: 

 

         (          )  (2.23) 
 

The equivalent thermal conductivity of the vacuum space was 

calculated assuming a parallel arrangement between the thermal 

resistances associated with the residual air diffusion (pressure lower 

than 13 Pa) driven by   , the thermal conductivity of the air and the 

radiation contribution, 

 

          (2.24) 

 

where the radiative equivalent thermal conductivity,   , is nonlinear 

with respect to absolute temperature and can be estimated by (AZZOLA 

et al., 2004): 
 

   
    (       )  (   

     
 )  (       )

  
  (2.25) 

 

Since the vacuum space in VIT systems frequently contains 

aluminum foil wraps separated by glass fiber foils,    is a function of 
the tubes surface emissivity,  , the absolute temperatures of the outer 
surface of the inner tube and the inner surface of the outer tube and  , 
which is the number of reflective wraps. 

Azzola et al. (2004) also described the development of a two-

dimensional axisymmetric finite-difference code to model the VIT 

thermal performance. The VIT geometry was divided into three regions, 

where the external convection heat transfer coefficient was assumed to 

be uniform - at the coupling, weld region (0.0508 m in extent beyond 

weld), and VIT body. The scheme of the finite difference code exhibited 

by Azzola et al. (2004) is depicted in Figure 2.11. From the element 

discretization, the energy balance in the inner tube and in the outer tube 

was performed. The heat balances took into account the transient heat 

transfer, the axial heat diffusion through the tubing walls, the radial 

radiative heat transfer through the vacuum space and the internal or 

external convective heat transfer depending on where the energy balance 

is applied, if in the inner tube or the outer tube. 

 



71 

 

 

 
Figure 2.11 – Finite difference code discretization scheme (AZZOLA et al., 

2004). 
 

Azzola et al. (2004) proposed two definitions of the effective 
thermal conductivity of the VIT as follows: 

 

      
     (      ? )

   (     )
 (2.26) 

  

      
     (      ? )

   (     )
 (2.27) 

 

In Equation 2.26, the effective thermal conductivity was defined 

relative to the outer diameter of the outer tube and the inner diameter of 

the inner tube, while in Equation 2.27 it was defined relative to the inner 

diameter of the outer tube and the outer diameter of the inner tube. It 

was concluded that the       thermal property is a better parameter to 

characterize the VIT’s effective thermal conductivity because, as the 

external thermal resistance increases, the insulation system performance 

expressed by       converges to the vacuum value. Thus, by choosing 

      as a definition, it is easy to recognize how well the insulation 
system performs relative to an ideal performance level. The following 

equation was proposed by Azzola et al. (2004) to assess       meaning 

with respect to a dimensionless external thermal resistance: 

 



72 

 

    
    

 
    

        (       )
 (2.28) 

 

Also, an expression to estimate the overall heat transfer 

coefficient was also proposed by Azzola et al. (2004) based on the       

value 

 

    
      

    (

  (2.29) 

 

2.4.3 VIT thermal and mechanical evaluations 

Despite the numerous successful cases, one should recognize the 

many challenges faced by oil companies to develop deepwater 

environment oilfields using VIT technologies. For instance, deepwater 

scenarios pose significant drawbacks for selecting suitable VIT tubulars 

to ensure long-term reliability under combined mechanical and thermal 

loads. 

Ellis et al. (2002) performed an extensive study of the VIT 

thermal behavior in a full-scale experimental test facility - a VIT system 

consisting of a 0.1397-m (5 ½-in) OD, 0.1143-m (4 ½-in) ID tubing was 

used. The experiments were able to determine average and local values 

of the overall heat transfer coefficients of the VIT system. Several 

configurations of the VIT were tested varying the coupling insulation 

and annuli fluid type. Results showed that the heat loss at the coupling 

drives the thermal performance of a VIT joint. Additionally, the authors 

concluded that, for this case, the VIT without coupling insulators could 

not be employed in the remaining wells of the Marlin field in the Gulf of 

Mexico. 

Gosch et al. (2004) used the test results obtained by Ellis et al. 
(2002) to design a suitable VIT system and described the methodology 

to install VITs and monitor the pressure and temperature behavior using 

fiber optic gauges in the remaining Marlin field wells in the Gulf of 

Mexico. 

Mechanical loads over the VIT were studied before by Pattillo et 

al. (2003) and Nowinka et al. (2005). The interrelation of the inner and 
outer tube, constrained at the weld, induces internal loads in the VIT 

joint that are foreign to conventional tubing design. Figure 2.12 presents 



73 

 

 

a basic VIT configuration with the thread on the outer tube (NOWINKA 

et al., 2005).

(NOWINKA et al., 2005). 
 

Another challenge faced by VIT system designers is the increase 

in axial load due to the large weight of these systems. Additionally, the 

interaction of the two tubes constituting the vacuum space introduces 

new considerations regarding burst and collapse resistances. Among 

them, one can cite (PATTILLO et al., 2003): 

? The lack of back up pressure on both inner and outer tubings; 

? The unique axial load in the separate tubes due to their 
displacement constraint at the weld; 

? The possibility of vacuum failure due to weld damage by 
corrosion or fatigue. 

 

Mechanical design of VIT systems deals with their structural 

integrity and sealing capability. Nowinka et al. (2005) described an 
extensive experimental setup to assess the mechanical behavior of full-

scale VIT systems. As expected, the structural integrity of the weld is 

critical for the VIT’s performance. According to Nowinka et al. (2005), 
if the weld fails, the VIT will lose its thermal insulation properties and 

pressure integrity. In addition to the physical evaluation, a finite element 

analysis was conducted to quantify the deformations and stresses that 



74 

 

are present in a typical VIT section. A total of seven load cases were 

numerically considered and twenty-two load cases were carried out in 

the experiential test. The tests showed that the VIT exhibited good 

structural integrity and sealability in the combined load test. There was 

no indication of weld failure throughout the test. The finite element 

analysis results indicated that the load case involving simultaneous 

application of maximum internal and external pressure proved to be the 

most severe combination of loads. 

Thus, Kim et al. (2005) and Kim and Cernocky (2005) evaluated 

the welding performance and stated a set of guidelines to ensure 

structural integrity, acceptable corrosion resistance properties and 

sealing. 

Azzola et al. (2007) described a thermal experimental analysis 

using two connected VIT joints. Two configurations were tested: with 

and without an external polyurethane coupling insulator. Tests results 

showed that the VIT overall heat loss is 61% lower when the coupling 

insulator is employed.        

 

2.5 VIT Assisted Wellbore Applied to APB Mitigation 

Feeney (1997) described several applications of VIT systems in 

subsea completions to prevent hydrate formation and wax deposition. U-

values in the magnitude of 0.095 W/m
2
.K are used in the completion 

designs by Shell in the Gulf of Mexico. VIT systems integrated with 

polyurethane coupling insulation have been used to control paraffin 

deposition in the Norman wells field (PURDY and CHAYNE, 1991). 

Singh et al. (2005) used a value of 0.023 W/m.K as an equivalent 

thermal conductivity of the VIT to simulate the effect of insulation in 

the wax deposition in a deviated production well using the OLGA 

software, a commercial transient multiphase flow and thermal software, 

as illustrated in Figure 2.13. The computational results showed a 

significant increase in the wellhead circulating temperature while using 

VIT joints. Even though the wellhead circulating temperature was not 

higher than the wax appearance temperature of the crude oil, the 

increase in temperature with the increase in VIT length caused a 
significant reduction in heat transfer and wax deposition rates. 

Ferreira et al. (2012) presented two cases where VITs were 

considered in the wellbore design phase as a means to prevent APB in 

deepwater scenarios. In one of them, the VIT technique met the design 

requirements and could be used as a wellbore insulator. In contrast, in 



75 

 

 

the other case, due to noncompliance with the assumptions set in the 

design phase regarding the production string integrity, the VIT could not 

be used to solve the APB problem between the 0.508-m (20-in) surface 

and 0.340-m (13 3/8-in) intermediate casings. Figure 2.14 shows the 

wellbore schematic diagram for the first case, with the possible APB 

problem occurring between the 0.508-m (20-in) casing and the 0.340-m 

(13 3/8-in) casing due to an estimated production of 0.035 m
3
/s (19,000 

BPD). A production through the tubing string was simulated with and 

without a 1,000 m VIT section comprising a 0.1683-m (6 5/8-in) OD 

0.1397-m (5 ½-in) ID tubing. 

 

 
Figure 2.13 – Effect of the VIT on the production thermal profile of an arctic 

deviated well (SINGH et al., 2005). 

 

The buildup pressure in the “C” (i.e., the outermost) annulus, 

formed by the 20-in and the 13 3/8-in OD casings, was simulated using 

a commercial software, Wellcat™, assuming an equivalent thermal 

conductivity of the VIT equal to 0.074 W/m.K. The predicted APB in 

the production annular as a function of the production time is illustrated 

in Figure 2.15. An APB difference of approximately 13.8 MPa (2,000 

psi) after 1 day of production was found when nearly 1,100 m of bare 
pipe was substituted by the same length of VIT. After 1 year of 

production, i.e., steady-state, the buildup pressure difference increased 

to nearly 17.9 MPa (2,600 psi).  

In the second case, VITs could not be used and important issues 

were raised regarding the mechanical integrity performance. According 



76 

 

to Ferreira et al. (2012), some operational limitations were met during 

the load cases computational simulation. For instance, when the tubing 

evacuation load criterion was applied, the tubing string collapse safety 

factor was exceeded even though the APB problem between the 

intermediate and surface casings was solved. This case is a good 

example that the use of VIT joints need to be study for each operational 

condition.

wellhead (FERREIRA et al., 2012).

77 

 

 

Recently, to demonstrate the benefits of VIT compared to bare 

tubing injector string, Karra et al. (2014) carried out a CFD study 

aiming to provide a comparison of heat loss in both VIT and bare tubing 

concentric and eccentric configurations during SAGD operations. It was 

assumed a k-value of 0.006 W/m.K as the VIT equivalent thermal 

conductivity. The computed results successfully demonstrate the 

benefits of VIT over bare tubing in maintaining steam quality in the 

vertical section of the wellbore. Additionally, as expected, the study 

shows reduction in steam quality for eccentric position of the bare 

tubing compared to concentric position, since in the eccentric 

arrangement the tubing can be in contact with casing. Thus, conduction 

also takes place in addition to the natural convection and radiation heat 

transfer in the annulus gap.   

Kang et al. (2015) proposed a thermal approach to deal with VIT 
joints in wellbores by using an enhanced free convection Nusselt 

number based on a combination of a horizontal and a vertical Nusselt 

numbers. The authors claimed that, since the thermal resistance change 

significantly along the VIT length, there is an expressive thermal 

gradient along the VIT system. Thus, the axial temperature gradient 

cannot be neglected since it drives the convection heat transfer in the 

VIT annulus. Figure 2.16 shows the temperature profiles in the 

production annulus for the two studied cases: using the enhanced free 

convection Nusselt number (blue line) and using a single Nusselt 

number (red line). 

The results revealed that when the proposed enhanced Nusselt 

number is employed, the average temperature in annulus “A” (i.e., the 

innermost) increases in the range of 22 to 33 K on average. Although 

interesting, the proposed approach does not solve the heat exchange 

through the VIT. It is just another approach to dealing with convection 

into the annulus gap.

2.6 Summary 

This chapter reviewed the main advances in wellbore fluid flow 

and heat transfer modeling, focusing on APB calculation methods, along 

with the most important studies on VIT applied to petroleum wells.  

According to the literature review, it was identified four types of 

approaches to handle the heat transfer and multiphase flow in wellbores 

and, in some cases, their relationship with the APB quantification:  

? the works that focus on the fluid stream, generally account for a 
rigorous method to estimate the fluid transport properties and 

the fluid flow behavior, with the main objective of predicting 

pressure and temperature distribution along the tubing string. 

? the works that deal with the thermal behavior in the wellbore 
taking into account the time dependent formation thermal 

resistance. Here, the objective is to estimate the temperature 

profile in the wellbore (tubing and annuli), in a steam injector 

and in oil production well. 



79 

 

 

? some simulators coupled wellbore and reservoir models using 
black oil or compositional model with the goal of predicting the 

behavior of production parameters, such as flow rate, pressure, 

temperature, gas oil ratio, liquid holdup both in vertical and 

deviated wells. 

? the approaches that focus on the APB calculation. These models 
include an estimation of volume and temperature change in the 

wellbore components due to the heat transfer from the wellbore 

to the formation. Thus, the resulting loads are computed to 

obtain the deformation of the tubes from the coupling between 

the pressure predictions and the structural model of tubulars. 

So, the increase in pressure is reached due to the two 

contributions, the fluid expansion and the annular space 

deformation. 

In terms of VIT modeling, it has been observed that more work is 

needed to overcome the main uncertainties associated with the thermal 

performance of the VIT, such as the determination of its effective 

thermal conductivity and the calculation of the heat lost through the 

connection in comparison with the VIT’s body. This can be considered 

the bottom line for achieving the proposed goals of this work.  

So far, all the efforts to model a VIT assisted wellbore focused on 

improving predictive approaches to heat transfer at the annulus and the 

use of unique equivalent thermal conductivity for VIT, namely k-value, 

and in some cases two conductivities, one representing the tube body 

and one for the connection region. One might conclude that there is no 

dedicated work to model the heat transfer through the VIT in an 

integrated process to the wellbore, and to investigate its effect on the 

wellbore thermal behavior. 

Thus, the major contribution of this thesis is to develop an 

integrated model in which the VIT system is thermally modeled and 

coupled to a wellbore simulator. Then, the effect of the VIT on the 

wellbore thermal-structural behavior can be comprehensively studied.

3 MODELING 

In this chapter, the theoretical approach proposed in this thesis to 

model the heat transfer through VIT joints will be presented, together 

with the procedure developed to incorporate it into a wellbore simulator.  

As mentioned in the Introduction, the main advantage of the two-

dimensional equivalent thermal network (ETN) model is its low 

computational cost. A full three-dimensional model based on the FVM 

was also implemented to better understand the heat transport through the 

VIT and validate the ETN model developed. 

 

3.1 VIT Geometry 

In order to model the heat transfer through a VIT joint, its 

geometry is divided into 5 or 4 axial sections, depending on the type of 

connection thread used, API
5
 or Premium

6
. Figure 3.1 illustrates the VIT 

geometry for an API connection thread, where the five different sections 

are described as follows: 

? Section 1 – VIT body. This is the longest region in a VIT joint. 
There is vacuum insulation in the annular gap between the 

tubes. This region is not in contact with the coupling; 

? Section 2 –VIT body and coupling interface;  

? Section 3 – Weld region. This is the region where the inner and 
outer tubing are welded together; 

? Section 4 – Outer tubing and coupling interface; 

? Section 5 – Coupling section. 

 The two VIT models implemented in this study are referred to 

according to the sizes (in inches) of the outer diameters of the outer and 

inner tubing. Thus, the 3 ½ ? 2 ? model has an API connection thread, 

and the 6 ? ? 5 ½ model has a Premium connection. In addition to the 

dimension differences between the two models, other features that must 

be pointed out, namely (i) the different heat transfer surface area and

wells. The thread shows an internal diameter discontinuity.

3.2 2-D ETN Model 

3.2.1 Hypotheses and governing equations 

The two-dimensional equivalent thermal network (ETN model) 

consists in solving an energy balance in each node of a grid generated 

for a specified VIT geometry. Due to space restrictions, the ETN model 

grid for a specific VIT joint is shown in Figures A.2 and A.3, in 

Appendix A. The individual nodes are connected by thermal resistances, 

and the solution to the system of equations (one for each node) gives the 

temperature distribution in the VIT. The energy balances for the VIT 

consider axisymmetric steady-state conduction-radiation in a concentric 

cylinder system, without heat generation. Also, the following 

assumptions were adopted in the present validation of the VIT ETN 

model: 

? Constant thermophysical properties in each VIT region (all 
metallic parts, including the weld, have the same physical 

properties); 

? Negligible thermal contact resistances; 

? All surfaces in the annular enclosure are gray and diffuse; 

? Perfect vacuum (i.e., absence of convective heat transfer in the 
gap); 

? The radiation heat exchange between the VIT external surface 
and the external environment is neglected; 

? The ends of each tubing are considered adiabatic due to the 
symmetry plane; 

At steady state, the energy balance equation for a generic node in 

the 2-D grid is given by: 

 

?          (3.1) 

 

or, in terms of the thermal resistances surrounding the node:

where      is the temperature at the central node of the grid and       , 

      ,        and        are the temperatures at the adjacent nodes. 



84 

 

      ,       ,        and        represent the thermal resistances to the 

south, north, west and east of the central node. A schematic 

representation of the thermal resistance network surrounding a generic 

central node is shown in Figure 3.2. 

 

 
Figure 3.2 – Generic node thermal network schematics. 

 

Thus, each thermal resistance is quantified according to the heat 

transfer mode present in a specific region of the VIT (i.e., conduction, 

convection and radiation). The energy balance equations of the ETN 

model can be found in detail in Appendix B. 

 

3.2.2 Model Implementation 

In order to generate results to be validated against the 3-D FVM 

simulation, the ETN model was implemented on the EES (Engineering 

Equation Solver) platform, which uses the Newton-Raphson method to 

simultaneously solve the set of algebraic equations. 

The main properties and parameters computed in the EES 

platform for each section are: 

? the heat transfer rate; 

? the VIT effective overall heat transfer coefficient and equivalent 
thermal conductivity; 

? the outer surface temperature of the VIT. 
 

The following inputs are needed: 

? the outer tube and inner tube radius; 

? the length of each VIT section; 



85 

 

 

? the prescribed temperature in the bulk fluid surrounding the 
VIT; 

? the prescribed internal temperature; 

? the environment pressure; 

? the fluid properties outside the VIT, such as the thermal 
expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, viscosity and 

density; 

? the tubes surface emissivity; 

? the tubes thermal conductivity.

3.2.3 Validation using a 3-D FVM model 

A three-dimensional thermal model of the VIT joint was 

implemented using the ANSYS 14.5.7 Workbench platform. The model 

assumed that heat transfer occurred in a VIT displayed horizontally, as 

modeled in the 2-D ETN model. Although the aim of this exercise is to 

validate the stand alone VIT thermal model (ETN model), the 3-D FVM 

model allows understanding the heat transport throughout the VIT joint 

and the identification of the key points influencing the heat exchange. 



86 

 

In the present analysis, idealized boundary conditions were taken 

into account in order to validate the ETN model against the 3-D-FVM 

results considering a stand-alone VIT joint displayed horizontally and 

surrounding by stagnant air. Hence, prescribed temperatures of the 

internal wall of the VIT,    , and bulk fluid surrounding the VIT,   , 
were chosen. Figure 3.3 summarizes the boundary conditions employed 

in the present approach. 

 

 
Figure 3.3 – Dirichlet boundary conditions applied at the VIT internal surface 

and in the air surrounding the VIT. 

 

Furthermore, adiabatic surface planes were assumed at both ends 

of the VIT due to the symmetry plane.  

The heat transfer problem is solved through the solution of the 

energy conservation equation in each finite volume. Thus, in order to 

better represent the VIT system, all sections (see Fig. 3.1) must be 

modeled, including the vacuum space. The constant-property, transient 

3-D heat diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates for the solid parts 

is given by:

where    is the thermal diffusivity of carbon steel. 



87 

 

 

The VIT geometry was drawn in the SolidWorks 2013 software 

and exported to the ANSYS platform. The mesh generation was 

implemented using ANSYS ICEM CFD, as shown in Figure 3.4. More 

attention was given to the coupling region, where the geometry is more 

complex, thus requiring a finer grid. A grid with approximately 700,000 

finite volumes was generated for a nearly 6-m long VIT. Hexahedral 

block structured grids facilitate a parametric assessment of the VIT 

length. The mesh was more refined close to the edges of the domain, 

with a linear expansion rate of 1.2.

Natural convection was assumed on the outer surface of the VIT. 

The convection coefficient,   , was estimated via the Churchill &amp;amp; Chu 
(1975) Nusselt number correlation for a long horizontal isothermal 

cylinder given by:

  (3.4) 

 

which is valid for       
  . The physical properties of the 

surrounding fluid were assumed identical to those of atmospheric air, 

and based on the film temperature between the outer surface and the 

bulk air. 



88 

 

The radiation heat transfer in the annular gap was solved using 

the Monte Carlo method, a numerical technique used to determine the 

view factor based on the statistical characteristics of physical processes 

(MIRHOSSEINI and SABOONCHI, 2011). Thus, the net radiation 

exchange between the inner tube and the outer tube can be calculated 

assuming a diffuse, gray surface behavior of the enclosure (annular 

space formed by the two long concentric cylinders). A nonparticipating 

medium is assumed within the enclosure. 

Initially, the heat transport through the VIT system is illustrated 

using the temperature field obtained from a FVM simulation. Figure 3.5 

shows the thermal map in a 3 ½” ? 2 ?” VIT system submitted to an 

internal prescribed temperature of 398.2 K and a tube surface emissivity 

of 0.7.  
 

 
Figure 3.5 – 3 ½” ? 2 3/8” VIT thermal map for an internal prescribed 

temperature of 398 K and emissivity of 0.7. 

 

The VIT thermal map points to a significant influence of the 2-D 

heat diffusion through the VIT walls up to 1 m from the connection. 

From there, a constant temperature is observed at the external surface of 

the VIT, suggesting that the axial conduction heat effect has vanished. 
Therefore, the heat transport is driven by the radiative axial heat 

exchange through the evacuated annulus. Figure 3.6 shows the 

temperature field at the VIT external surface computed via the 3-D 

FVM approach, confirming that the temperature plateaus roughly 1 m 

away from the connection. 



89 

 

 

 

 
Figure 3.6 – External surface temperature profile for a 3 ½” ? 2 ?” VIT (3-D 

FVM calculations). 

 

Next, a comparison between the ETN model and the FVM is 

performed to validate the standalone nodal thermal model. Firstly, the 

trade-off between different meshes is assessed in order to establish an 

optimum refinement at the expense of a longer computational time. 

Therefore, Figure 3.7 shows the effect of the mesh on the VIT’s external 

surface temperature. Note that a log scale is used in the abscissas to 

facilitate the comparison between the curves. 

As expected, a finer mesh provides a better accuracy, but also 

results in a higher computational cost. However, the coarse mesh is not 

capable of capturing the high thermal gradients that occur at the 

interface between the connection and the VIT body. Also, the 

intermediate mesh does not accurately reproduce the thermal profile in 

this region. Hence, the refined grid with 53 nodes fitted the FVM 

thermal profile without posing a large computation time penalty. A 

maximum discrepancy of 1 K was observed and, therefore, this mesh 

was used as a baseline for further studies.  

Having determined the best grid refinement for the ETN 

simulations, the heat transfer rate per unit length was determined for 

each VIT section using the two approaches (ETN and FVM). Table 3.3 

– Comparison of heat transfer rate (in W/m) in each VIT section for the 

two developed approaches. shows the results in each VIT section 

considering a variable VIT body length for the 3 ½ ? 2 ? VIT system. A 



90 

 

prescribed internal wall temperature of 373.15 K and an emissivity of 

0.8 were assigned to the inner and outer tubing surfaces. All simulations 

were performed assuming a prescribed temperature of the surrounding 

fluid of 293.15 K.

Regardless of the VIT body length, the heat lost to the external 

environment in Sections 3 to 5 (i.e., without vacuum) is nearly the same.  



91 

 

 

This is because the heat transport is controlled mainly by conduction 

and convection resistances, which are the same for the two approaches. 

Regarding the heat transfer rate per unit length, the ETN model and the 

FVM showed very similar results, with differences between 0.1 and 6% 

for all simulated cases. 

A summary of the VIT thermal property calculations using the 

ETN approach is presented in Table 3.4 –  for the case of 6 ? x 5 ½ VIT 

system designed with premium thread.

In Table 3.4 – , both the VIT internal temperature and tube 

surface emissivity were varied given their considerable influence on the 

VIT’s thermal performance. The simulations were performed for a 

nearly 6-m long VIT. The calculation of     was based on the weighted 

average of     given by: 

 

    
? (     )

where the outer surface area of the external tube (diameter    ) was 
chosen as the reference area for all overall heat transfer coefficients. The 

effective thermal conductivity of the VIT,    , was quantified based on 

    as follows: 
 

    
         (

   
   

? )

 
   

(3.6) 

 

 Although,     and     have different meanings ?  the former is 

a performance parameter that involves an overall temperature difference 

and the latter is a material specific physical property ? in this case, the 

effective thermal conductivity is also being defined so as to quantify the 

combined thermal resistance, including the one due to external 

convection. This approach was adopted to be consistent with wellbore 

thermal flow simulators, which use     as a thermal performance 
parameter. Furthermore, it also serves as a quantity that can be directly 

compared to those of other insulating materials. 

As can be seen from Table 3.4 – , the larger the emissivity and 

the temperature difference, the higher the values of the thermal 

parameter. In terms of the VIT annular gap surface emissivity, reducing 

the thermal radiation resistance (by increasing the emissivity from 0.65 

to 0.85) represents a loss of insulation performance of about 20%. Since 

the problem was formulated considering prescribed temperatures, 

increasing the VIT internal surface temperature while keeping a fixed 

surrounding fluid temperature results in a higher temperature difference 

and, therefore, in a larger VIT effective overall heat transfer coefficient.  

For simulations with the same prescribed temperatures, the    

values are almost constant in Sections 2, 3 and 4, while for Section 1 it 

increases with the emissivity. This can be explained by the fact that 

Sections 3 and 4 are not influenced by radiative heat transfer. Also, 

Section 2 is basically insensitive to changes in the tubes’ emissivity. 

Additionally, even though the   values are higher in Sections 2, 3 and 4, 
    is nearly unaffected by them, since those three regions comprise a 

small share of the VIT joint. This shows the great influence of Section 1 

on    .  

This section presented an equivalent thermal network (ETN) 

model for solving the two-dimensional heat transfer in a VIT joint. The 

mesh refinement was calibrated against results from the commercial 

software ANSYS FLUENT. In order to evaluate the performance of VIT 



93 

 

 

joints at conditions typical of a real well, where they are incorporated 

into the tubing strings to mitigate APB, the ETN model has to be 

integrated with a well simulator. The wellbore model used in this project 

will be presented in the next section. 
 

3.3 Wellbore Multiphysics Model 

This section describes the Wellbore Multiphysics (WM) model, 

which contains methods for calculating physical properties, multiphase 

flow, thermal and mechanical parameters of the well. The model was 

initially developed by Hafemann et al. (2015) and was later improved by 

Barcelos et al. (2017). The VIT ETN model proposed in the previous 

section was incorporated into the WM model framework to generate the 

main results presented in this thesis. 

The WM model considers the thermal-hydraulic effects in the 

production tubing and the thermal properties of the annulus, cement, 

casing and adjacent rock formation. The fundamental hypothesis of the 

WM model is that, because of the difference in characteristic thermal 

time scales between the well and the formation, the former can be 

modeled assuming quasi steady state.  

Due to the large aspect ratio of the well (length/diameter), a one-

dimensional formulation is adopted for the fluid flow in the wellbore. 

The linear momentum balance is written in terms of the total pressure 

gradient components (frictional, gravitational and accelerational) in 

differential form (Brill and Mukherjee, 1999):

Although single-phase flow may exist in the reservoir and at the bottom 

of the well, vapor flashing may occur as the pressure decreases towards 

the wellhead and becomes lower than the saturation pressure at the local 

temperature and composition. Thermodynamic equilibrium was 

assumed in the calculation of the vapor content in the two-phase flow. 

While several approaches are available to describe the friction 
and phase fraction behavior in multiphase flow, Hafemann et al. (2015) 

relied on a flow pattern based approach by Barbosa and Hewitt (2006) to 

provide more accurate predictions of pressure drop, liquid holdup and 



94 

 

flow regime transitions. A detailed description of the multiphase flow 

model is provided in Appendix C.  

The energy balance for the flowing fluid is given by: 

 

 
  

  
 

  

   
           

   
  

   (3.8) 

 

where   is the fluid enthalpy,    is the fluid mixture velocity,   is the 
mixture mass velocity and    is the heat transfer rate per unit length, 
which is computed assuming a one-dimensional heat transfer in the 

radial direction via a thermal network model. Also,   is the inclination 
angle relative to the vertical axis. 

In this model, each horizontal layer of the multistring well 

geometry is modeled as an individual resistance as illustrated in Figure 

2.3. The heat transfer rate per unit length is defined based on the total 

conductance and the overall temperature difference between the 

hydrocarbon internal flow and the geothermal temperature profile as 

follows: 

 

           (      ) (3.9) 

 

where the overall heat transfer coefficient,      is obtained from a global 
resistance model considering each well layer, as shown in Eq. 2.1. The 

two-phase internal forced convection heat transfer coefficient,    , was 
calculated using the two-phase forced convection part of the Chen 

(1966) convective boiling correlation, that is, without the nucleate 

boiling contribution, but considering the two-phase flow enhancement 

factor. 

In order to estimate the wellbore/formation interface temperature, 

   , a hybrid approach based on the dimensionless time,   , has been 

proposed to compute  ( ) considering the models of Ramey (1962), 
Hasan and Kabir (1991) and Cheng et al. (2011): 

 

 ( )  

{
 
 
 

 
 
 
      ?   (     ?  )               

  ( ?  )        

 
 

   
[  (  

 

 
*    (   )        ]  

              

  ( ?  )                   

 (3.10) 



95 

 

 

The reason for adopting this approach meets the observations 

made by Cheng et al. (2011) and Hasan and Kabir (1991). The former 

pointed out that, for very short transient (      ), the correlation 
based on the ratio between the formation and wellbore heat capacities 

should not be employed since there is no significant contribution of the 

formation to the wellbore thermal behavior. The latter stated that, for 

very short and for long transients, their approach presented an excellent 

agreement with the exact solution for the transient diffusion in the 

formation. 

Given the geothermal profile and the reservoir pressure and 

temperature at the PDG as boundary conditions, the pressure and 

temperature of the flowing fluid are calculated assuming a known flow 

rate. The momentum and energy equations are integrated from the 

bottom hole to the wellhead. The equations were implemented on 

Matlab
®

 and solved numerically using the Dormand-Prince method (an 

adaptive technique based on the Runge-Kutta method). Phase 

equilibrium and physical properties of the hydrocarbon mixture and the 

annuli fluids are calculated via the commercial software Multiflash™. 

At each time step, the pressure and the enthalpy, together with the 

overall composition of the mixture, are used to compute the local 

equilibrium (bubble-point) temperature and the vapor quality. 

In order to calculate the APB, the mechanical model takes into 

account the three contributions described in Eq. 2.20. The model 

considers the multistring approach implemented in the work of Barcelos 

et al. (2017). Thus, each annular is treated as an integral volume (the 

“pressure vessel approach”), so that the annular pressure change caused 

by every local volume variation is transmitted through all annuli 

instantly. This way, even though local volume deformations are 

computed, the calculated APB value is an overall parameter for each 

annular, updated at every time step. 

As can be seen in the flowchart shown in Figure 3.8, the solution 

procedure of the WM model sequentially solves the hydraulic and 

thermal equations, followed by the mechanical model.

3.4 Coupling the ETN Model with the WM Model 

After showing that the ETN model can produce results that are 

consistent with a full FVM simulation of the multi-dimensional heat 

conduction in a VIT, the 2-D model will be incorporated into the WM 

model to predict the influence of VIT joints on the overall thermal 

behavior of the well. 

The original versions of the WM model (Hafemann et al., 2015; 
Barcelos et al., 2017) treated the heat transfer as one-dimensional in the 

radial direction and modeled the VIT joints using a single k-value 

(AZZOLA et al., 2004; AZZOLA et al., 2007), which is a simplistic 
representation of the heat transfer problem in the VIT. Therefore, in 

order to take into account the 2-D features of the ETN model and 
evaluate the overall impact of an axially dependent thermal conductance 

of the VIT joints, the original wellbore simulator had to be adapted.  

The following sub-sections describe the mathematical procedure 

needed to couple the ETN model to the 1-D WM calculation framework 

adopted in the simulator. 



97 

 

 

3.4.1 Adaptation of the ETN Model and Boundary Conditions 

When the ETN model is coupled to the well simulator, different 

boundary conditions are needed to accurately represent a real production 

well scenario. Therefore, the constant temperature boundary condition at 

the inner surface of the VIT (used to validate the model against the 

FVM simulation) was replaced by a Cauchy (convection) boundary 

condition (hydrocarbon flow at a temperature    in the production 
tubing). At the outer surface, appropriate natural convection and 

radiation heat transfer relationships are needed, as illustrated in Figure 

3.9 – .  

 

 
Figure 3.9 – Cauchy boundary condition for the heat transfer from/to a VIT 

joint. 



98 

 

The boundary conditions described above are applied to each 

axial node of the VIT inner and outer walls. At the inner surface, the 

convection boundary condition is given by  

 

   (       )    
  

  
|
     

 (3.11) 

 

where    is the local temperature of the flowing hydrocarbons, 

calculated at each axial step as a function of the local pressure and 

enthalpy. At the outer surface, the following boundary condition is 

applied, considering natural convection and radiation in the cavity 

formed by the external surface of the VIT joint and the internal surface 

of the production casing: 

 

  
  

  
|
     

 (     )  (         )  (3.12) 

 

where    is a convection heat transfer coefficient and    is an equivalent 
radiation heat transfer coefficient for the annulus space defined by: 

 

   
  (         )  (    

      
 )

 

 
 

(   )

 
(

   

    
)

  (3.13) 

 

In the ETN model, additional boundary conditions are needed to 

describe the axial heat transfer at the ends of the VIT joints located at 

the top and bottom of the tubing string. It is worth to remember that the 

VIT joints are stacked (connected) one above the other until reaching 

the depth that it is desired to reduce the radial heat transfer, commonly 

from the wellhead to the bottom of the confined annulus. For simplicity, 

a thermal insulation boundary condition was applied to each node at 

those surfaces. Thus,

   (3.14) 

 

  
  

  
|

99 

 

 

Figure 3.10 shows the two boundary conditions assumed in the 

model. 

 

 
Figure 3.10 – Boundary conditions at the ends of the connected VIT joints. 

 

The steady-state heat conduction equation that describes the heat 

transfer in the VIT joints is elliptic in the   and   directions. On the 
other hand, the momentum and energy equations that give the 

hydrocarbon pressure and enthalpy along the wellbore are parabolic in 

 . As will be seen in the next sub-section, an iterative calculation 
procedure has been developed to solve the 2-D ETN model within the 1-

D wellbore modeling framework in order to extract, at each axial control 

volume of the wellbore grid, a heat transfer rate per unit length,   , 
which takes into account the 2-D nature of heat flow in the VIT. In this 

way, two different numerical meshes can be used, namely a finer 2-D 

VIT grid (whose size was determined based on the comparison with the 

FVM simulations) and a coarser 1-D wellbore grid. This approach 

considerably reduces the computational cost involved in predicting the 

behavior of the system variables (pressures, temperatures and heat flow 

rates) as a function of space and time. Figure 3.11 illustrates 

schematically the directions of the heat transfer rates, according to the 

proposed model, for an oil well with a VIT joint (near the mud line).

blue arrows). 

 

3.4.2 Computational Implementation of the Integration Between the 
Models 

An approximate method was adopted to determine the 

temperatures and the heat flow at the nodes of the VIT numerical grid. 

As previously presented, the physical system is represented by a nodal 

network (see Appendix A, Figure A.2 and Figure A.3). Thus, the energy 

balances were applied to obtain a system of equations for the 

temperatures at each node. In the coupling of the 2-D ETN model with 

the wellbore simulator, the set of the algebraic equations is solved with 

the “fsolve” function in MATLAB
®
 for each node of the numerical 

domain using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (least squares) to deal 

with the non-linearities associated with the fourth-power radiation law. 

A procedure for solving the VIT field temperature is detailed as follows: 

 

1. Set the VIT (finer, 2-D) mesh; 



101 

 

 

2. Interpolate the input variables (                 ), from the 

wellbore (coarser, 1-D) grid;   

3. Compute the VIT internal thermal resistances; 
4. Set the algebraic equation system as a function of the unknown 

temperatures at each VIT node; 

5. Establish the VIT boundary conditions; 
6. Make initial guesses for all unknown temperatures; 
7. Solve simultaneously the algebraic equations system using a 

Matlab
®
 solver (fsolve, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm); 

8. Determine the temperature field for a specific convergence 
criterion. 

 

Given the temperature field in the VIT, it is possible to determine 

the equivalent thermal resistance of the VIT in terms of the mesh 

employed in the wellbore, calculated as follows: 

  

      
 ?     ?   

?     
   (3.16) 

 

where the subscript   represents the wellbore axial grid (WM model), 
the subscript   represents the VIT axial grid (ETN model) and   ? and   ? 
were determined based on the weighted mean 

  

 ?    
?  ?       

?    
   (3.17) 

 

where   can be the internal or the external VIT surface temperature. 
Figure 3.12 presents the relation between the two grids applied in the 

VIT heat transfer problem to compute the equivalent thermal resistance.  

Thus, the wellbore simulator uses the updated equivalent thermal 

resistances of the wellbore grid to calculate the heat transfer rate per unit 

length and obtain the new pressure and temperature fields along the 

wellbore. It is important to mention that, in the first iteration, the overall 

heat transfer coefficient,    , at each length step is computed taking into 
account the temperature difference between the flowing fluid and the 

wellbore/formation interface. Consequently,     includes all wellbore 
thermal resistances as shown in Eq. 2.1 and the heat transfer rate per 

unit length assumes the form of Eq. 3.9. In this case, Hasan and Kabir 

(1991) rewrote this equation so as to incorporate the transient approach 



102 

 

by adding the relaxation parameter,   , which depends on the transient 
function defined in Eq. 2.6 as follows: 

 

         (      )   (3.18) 

 

where    is given by: 
 

   
  

   
 *

           

    (          )
+   (3.19) 

 

 

 
Figure 3.12 – VIT equivalent thermal resistance (for the wellbore mesh) 

calculation details. 

 

When the VIT thermal model is incorporated into the wellbore 

simulator,     must be computed differently since, for a given length 
step of the wellbore grid, the heat transfer rate leaving the hydrocarbon 

stream is different from the one reaching the first annulus space (outer 

surface of the VIT). This is a consequence of the two-dimensional heat 

transfer taking place at the VIT joints. Thus, in other words, in order to 

satisfy the energy conservation,     for this new approach considers the 



103 

 

 

temperature difference between the VIT external surface and the 

wellbore/formation interface. So, for a wellbore with only one annulus, 

Eq. 2.1 is rewritten as: 

 
 

   
 

   
   (     )

 
      (      ? )

  
 

      (      ? )

    
   (3.20) 

 

where the first term represents the annulus thermal resistance, the 

second term represents the casing resistance and the last one represents 

the cement thermal resistance. In addition, Eq. 3.18 is rewritten as 

follows 

 

         (        )   (3.21) 

 

where      is the VIT external surface temperature. Figure 3.13 presents 

a flowchart of the numerical solution of the WM-ETN coupled model. 

Initially, the fluid flow and heat transfer in the wellbore is computed 

from the well bottom to the wellhead. An arbitrary value for the VIT 

thermal conductivity is employed to determine the temperature field, 

which is used as an initial guess in the second step. To this end, a new 

grid, a finer one, is designed in order to capture the two-dimensional 

heat transfer through the VIT system. Thus, thermal resistances are 

calculated for the finer grid and a new temperature field is computed. 

Finally, equivalent thermal resistances are determined for the wellbore 

grid using Eq. 3.16.    

The convergence criterion used in the iterative solution process is 

such that the heat transfer rate into a VIT joint (through its inner wall) 

must be equal to the heat transfer rate through its outer wall in order to 

satisfy the conservation of energy. Thus:  

 

?
     

    
  

        

          
 ?

    

    
  

        

          

?
    

    
  

        

          

       (3.22) 

 

where      is the total length of the VIT joint and      and       are, 
respectively, the heat transfer rate per unit length on the inner and outer 

walls of the VIT (ETN model grid).  

Figure 3.14 illustrates the flow of information between the parts 

of the integrated model (WM + 2-D ETN). In addition to validations 



104 

 

with field data, the integrated model will also be compared with 

WellCat

4 RESULTS 

Two real deepwater wells located at the Brazilian coast were used 

to validate the existing models and to evaluate the current models 

developed in this thesis. This chapter presents the results of this thesis, 

namely a detailed thermal-hydraulic-mechanical assessment of both 

wells. The results were compared and validated against field data and 

numerical results generated by a commercial software package 

(WellCat
TM

).    
 

4.1 Description of the Cases Studied 

4.1.1 Description of the Case 1 – Well A 

The WM model initially developed by Hafemann et al. (2015) 
and Barcelos et al. (2017) was further verified in the present thesis 

against a more extensive dataset containing other field operating 

conditions. In this case, a deepwater vertical 4,700-m well (well A) 

drilled at an offshore location on the Brazilian coast is presented in 

Figure 4.1. Note that, although the present well A schematics contains a 

VIT column, the first simulations performed did not take them into 

account. The lithological column is also shown. The present simulations 

started with a pressure boundary condition at the pressure downhole 

gauge (PDG) located at the depth of 3,890 m. The simulation results are 

compared with the WellCat commercial software and field data. The 

basic properties of the reservoir fluid are summarized in Appendix D. 

Case 1 considers the basic parameters presented in Table 4.1 and 

Table 4.2. Table 4.1 summarizes the operational data obtained from the 

field and some simulation inputs. Table 4.2 shows details of the well A 

design. As shown in Figure 4.1, seven types of rocks were drilled 

through, however, only four are found above the PDG, which is the 

wellbore region simulated in the present study.  

The thermal behavior of the wellbore is highly affected by the 

adjacent formation, so it is fundamental to properly define key 

thermophysical properties of the formation layers impacting the 

wellbore. Also, the wellbore structural behavior depends on the 
mechanical properties of the formation layers. Both are summarized in 

Table 4.3.

4.1.2 Description of the Case 2 – Well B 

In order to fully validate the integrated model, the results are 

compared with field data from a deviated slender deepwater well located 

in the Campos Basin, here called well B. 

The wellbore schematics shows a long, confined annulus (formed 

by the 13 ?” and 20” casings) as depicted in Figure 4.2. Due to the risk 

of collapsing the intermediate casing and/or bursting the surface casing, 

nearly one hundred 6 ?” ? 5 ½” VIT joints have been positioned from 

the wellhead (1,091 m) to a depth of 2,171 m deep to ensure the well 

integrity. It is important to emphasize that this is the only offshore well 



110 

 

in Brazil with VIT joints used to reduce APB. Basic properties of the 

reservoir fluid for this well are presented in Appendix E.  

 

 
Figure 4.2 – Well B geometric details. 

 

The multiphase flow was solved using the Beggs and Brill (1973) 

pressure loss correlation – for more details see Appendix F. This 

approach is one of the few correlations capable of handling all flow 

directions including, deviated wells operating with two-phase fluid. The 

method uses the general mechanical energy balance and the average in-

situ density to calculate the pressure gradient. Accordingly, the slope 

term is now embedded into the momentum equation as follows

4.2 Thermal-Hydraulic Evaluation 

In this section, the thermal and multiphase flow model was 

compared and validated against field data and the commercial software 

WellCat™. Later, a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the 

importance of each wellbore layer thermal resistance on the wellbore 

thermal behavior.  

 

4.2.1 Hydraulic model  

Figure 4.4 illustrates the simulated thermal and pressure profile 

along the wellbore and the field data for the two end points of the tubing 

string (i.e. at wellhead and PDG depths) after 1 day of production. The 

agreement is reasonable given the uncertainties involved, and the 

performance of the model is compatible with that obtained from 

Wellcat™. For a production time of 1 day, the hydrocarbon pressure and 

temperature at the wellhead were 16.61 MPa and 375 K, respectively. 

The present model showed deviations of 0.42 MPa (2.5 %) and less than 

3.3 K at the wellhead depth. The deviations associated with the 

commercial software were about 0.56 MPa (3.4 %) and 3.7 K. As the 

production time increased, the deviations of both simulators decreased. 

 



114 

 

 
Figure 4.4 – Field data and simulation results for well A for a production time 

of 1 day. 

 

Figure 4.5 shows a complete set of flowing fluid pressure and 

temperature data for well A, with the hydrocarbon production kick off at 

the zeroth hour on February 22
nd

, 2015. The sampling frequency of the 

PDG and wellhead pressure and temperature data was approximately 1 

reading per hour. As can be seen in Figure 4.5, using the PDG pressure 

and temperature as an input, the calculated wellhead pressure and 

temperature at different production times (6 hours, 1, 2, 5 and 10 days) 

result in a very good agreement between the model and the field data.  

At this point, it is important to define a reference time standard 

for the results presented along the text. Hence, the reference state 

corresponds to a condition of zero hydrocarbon flow and thermal 

equilibrium between the well and the formation. At this condition, 

referred to as t = 0
–
 h, the temperatures of the wellbore and of the 

formation are represented by the geothermal gradient. Also, once the 

well kicks off, the hydrodynamic steady state is immediately achieved 

since the present transient formulation only applies to the formation 

thermal model.  Note that this is a common approximation in the 

literature (RAMEY, 1962; CHIU and THAKUR, 1991; HASAN and 
KABIR, 1994), since the time required for the hydrodynamic model to 

reach steady state is several orders of magnitude smaller than the 

characteristic time scale of the heat transfer in the formation. For 

instance, Hasan and Kabir (1991) showed the difference in time scale 



115 

 

 

(about 10
-5

) using a simple example of heat and pressure transmission in 

a porous medium.  
 

 
Figure 4.5 – Field data and simulation results for well A. 

 

As shown in Figure 4.5, once the well is operational, the initial 

flow caused an increase in the mudline temperature, which approached a 

quasi-steady state temperature value of 375 K. Also noticeable is that 

the model agreed well with the field data regardless the time scale 

considered.  
 

4.2.2 Thermal model 

Figure 4.6, Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.88 compare the flowing 

hydrocarbon and annulus temperature profiles of the model and 

commercial software for production time steps of 1, 5 and 10 days. Even 

though the thermal behavior of all fluids (i.e. flowing fluid and annuli 

fluids) in both models are quite similar for higher production times (i.e. 

5-day production or more), some points stand out: firstly, the largest 

temperature difference between the two models (2.4 K) was observed 

for the hydrocarbon stream at the wellhead; secondly, the model was 
significantly affected by the formation thermophysical properties 

presenting several discontinuities in the annuli thermal profiles. With 

respect to the short transient simulation (i.e. 1-day production), the 

simulated temperature profile of flowing fluid agrees well with that from 



116 

 

Wellcat. However, the temperature difference between the two sets of 

data increases as the well depth decrease, most likely due to the 

uncertainty of how the commercial code handles gas filled annular 

spaces – note that N2 is present in annulus A.  

 

 
Figure 4.6 – Wellbore fluid temperatures obtained from the thermal and 

multiphase flow model and Wellcat for well A for a production time of 1 day. 

 

It can be seen in Figure 4.6, Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8 that near 

the wellhead, the annuli temperatures predicted by Wellcat decreased 

sharply. Figure 4.9 shows in greater detail the effect of the quick 

decrease in temperature experienced by the annuli fluid, for 1 day of 

production. The reasons for this temperature drop are unknown, but may 

result from a two-dimensional heat transfer model embedded into 

Wellcat™ to compute the axial heat loss from the wellbore to the sea. 

However, the phenomenon might not be evaluated properly. Even 

though there are no data of annulus temperature available to strengthen 

the hypothesis, a drop of about 40 K in less than 2 m distance is 

somewhat questionable.

Figure 4.9 – Wellbore temperature behavior close to the wellhead depth for a 

simulation of 1 day of production. 

 

Figure 4.10 illustrates the variation of  ( ) as a function of    
(note that as the production time increases    increases as well) for 
different wellbore depths, that is, for different formation layers. It is 

important to emphasize that an accurate prediction of  ( ) is 
fundamental to the model’s convergence, since it is used to calculate the 

interface temperature, which is an important parameter used in the code 

iteration. 

Figure 4.10 shows that as    increases, the differences between 
the curves obtained for the several formations are reduced. For values of 

   larger than 20, the curves collapse into a single profile that is close to 
Ramey’s (1962) long time asymptotic solution (RAMEY, 1962; 

WILLHITE, 1967; HASAN and KABIR, 1991, CHENG et al., 2011). 

Moreover, it shows that sandstone and cementstone are much faster in 

conducting heat away from the wellbore due to the higher thermal 
diffusivity of these two formation types in relation to the others.

4.2.3 Effect of the production time on the wellbore thermal-hydraulic 
behavior 

Figure 4.11 and Figure 4.12 show, respectively, the temperature 

variation of the flowing fluid and annulus A through the well A for 

several different production times, according to the present 

mathematical model. For the initial flowing time, t = 0
+
 h, the 

temperature profile is not influenced by the formation thermal resistance 

yet. At this time, the thermal behavior is only affected by the wellbore 

thermal resistances, especially by the cement sheaths, as observed at 

1,470 and 2,040 m and by the annulus B fluid present between the two 

cement isolation sections (from 2,955 to 3,050 m). 

 For a longer time scale (i.e., 10 days), the heat transport is almost 

at steady state. The further the radial heat flow travels into the rock 

formation, the larger the influence of the formation thermophysical 

properties on the wellbore thermal profile and, therefore, the smaller the 

influence of the wellbore thermal resistances. In other words, as the 

Fourier number increases, the importance of the wellbore heat capacity 

on the wellbore thermal behavior becomes less relevant.

4.2.4 Effect of the annulus fluid type 

As mentioned above, well A was completed with the production 

annular (Annulus A) filled with nitrogen down to a depth of 3,806 m, 

where a gas lift valve was installed (see Figure 4.1). Below this depth, 

the remaining annulus space is filled with brine (water/sodium chloride, 

73/27 % wt). The effect of the type of fluid on the wellbore thermal 

behavior, according to the present model, can be observed in Figure 4.13 

and Figure 4.14. Figure 4.13 shows the temperature profile for the 

hydrocarbon stream for two different scenarios: production annulus 

filled only with brine or with N2/brine, to reproduce the actual 

completion of well A.   

 

 
Figure 4.13 – Effect of the fluid type on the flowing fluid temperature profile. 

 

Figure 4.14 shows the temperature profile for the production 

annulus considering it is entirely filled with brine and N2/brine for three 

different production periods. The insulation provided by the N2 

contributed to the reduction of the production annulus wellhead 

temperature, which is explained by the lower thermal conductivity of the 

gas. Even though the use of N2 as a packer fluid is not common in the 



122 

 

oil industry, it is justified since this well expected a gas-lift operation at 

later stages. The thermal characteristics of the materials involved in this 

configuration resulted in significant reductions of the heat transport to 

the outward annuli and of the wellhead temperature. While the tubing 

fluid temperature increases when N2 is employed (see Figure 4.13), the 

reverse behavior is observed in the production annulus, as can be seen in 

Figure 4.14. 

 

 
Figure 4.14 – Effect of the fluid type on the annulus A temperature profile. 

 

For all production times, except for very short transient (i.e. t=0
+
 

day), the much higher thermal resistance associated with the N2-filled 

annulus results in a higher temperature of the tubing fluid at the 

wellhead and a lower temperature of the production annulus in 

comparison with the case where brine is used as a packer fluid (Figure 

4.15). This behavior is due to the reduction in the radial heat loss. The 

temperature difference in the production annulus reached nearly 3 K for 

a 5-day production time frame. For very short transients, as presented in 

Figure 4.15, the temperature difference between the flowing fluid and 

the annular fluids is very large and the heat exchange into the wellbore 

is characterized by an intense heat transfer rate from the tubing fluid 



123 

 

 

towards the formation. In this case, the flowing fluid temperature 

difference at the wellhead is about 10 K higher for N2 compared to 

brine. So, although N2 is a better thermal insulator than brine, at the 

beginning of production, the wellhead temperature for the flowing fluid 

and annulus A fluids are higher in the case of N2-filled annulus due to 

the higher thermal diffusivity of the gas (2 or 3 order of magnitude 

higher). 

 

 
Figure 4.15 – Effect of the fluid type on the flowing fluid and annulus A 

wellhead temperature. 

 

The nitrogen in annulus A also contributed to the reduction of the 

unwanted increase of the annular pressure when compared to brines due 

to the much larger compressibility coefficient. As mentioned above, 

although appropriate in a particular scenario involving gas-lift 

production during later stages, the use of N2 in the production annulus to 

reduce the heat transport to the outward annuli is not common and 

should be carefully considered. This is because the gas may contain 

traces of hydrogen sulfide or even carbon dioxide, which cause 

corrosion of the production casing when in contact with water, and/or 



124 

 

leakage through the casing threads if an inappropriate connection is 

employed. 

 

 

4.2.5 Effect of the annulus convection heat transfer correlation 

Although there are many natural convection models available in 

the literature, no correlation has been derived specifically for large 

aspect ratio annuli, such as those found in petroleum wells. In order to 

explore the contribution of the annulus convection to the wellbore 

thermal behavior, Figure 4.16, Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18 were plotted 

considering three different instants, namely 0
+
, 1-day and 10-day 

production (steady-state). The results revealed that for a very short 

production time (see Figure 4.16), when the annulus thermal resistance 

has a stronger effect on the wellbore thermal behavior, larger deviations 

between the annulus convection correlations are observed. The largest 

deviations between any two correlations in terms of the wellhead 

temperature were 2.4 K, 1.7 K and 0.7 K for the flowing fluid, annulus 

A and annulus B, respectively.  

 

 
Figure 4.16 – Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids 

temperature profiles for very short transient (t = 0
+
 h). 



125 

 

 

 

For 1-day production (see Figure 4.17) the discontinuities in the 

annular fluid temperature profiles due to the presence of the cement 

sheaths are still observed, but to a lesser extent when compared to the 

transitions between different formation layers.  
 

 
Figure 4.17 – Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids 

temperature profiles for short transient (1-day production). 

 

As the production time increases, the contribution of the 

formation thermal resistance also increases and the convection 

correlation choice is no longer important, as shown in Figure 4.18.  

 



126 

 

 
Figure 4.18 – Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids 

temperature profiles for steady-state (10-day production). 

 

 

4.2.6 Effect of the formation thermal model 

The influence of the production time was quantified for each 

formation model implemented in the simulator. Figure 4.19 shows the 

temperature profile for Annulus A for two different production times. 

For short periods, the model developed by Cheng et al. (2011) showed 
the largest deviation with respect to the other models. This was 

somewhat expected, since for low    values the formation heat capacity 
embedded in the transient temperature function,  ( ), has little influence 
on the wellbore heat transfer process. For large production times, the 

differences between the models decreases significantly, as previously 

reported (Nian et al., 2014).  

 

 

 

 

 



127 

 

 

 
Figure 4.19 – Effect of the formation model on the annulus A temperature 

profile for two different production times. 

 

Although the model of Hasan and Kabir (1991) predicts the 

lowest wellbore temperatures among all models, as shown in Figure 

4.19 and Figure 4.20, the deviations between the models are relatively 

low – nearly 3 K for annulus B wellhead temperature. Additionally, the 

hybrid model implemented in this thesis eliminated the over estimation 

associated with very short periods found in the Cheng et al. (2011) 

model. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the hybrid model combines the best 

features of each model, namely the very short transient response of 

Hasan and Kabir (1991), the better agreement for short periods of Cheng 

et al. (2011) and the consistent behavior of the Ramey (1962) model for 
the late production stages.

profiles for a 2-day production time. 

 

4.2.7 APB prediction 

For the purpose of calculating the wellbore annuli increase in 

pressure, the multistring approach proposed in the recent study of 

Barcelos et al. (2017) was considered. In this case, all APB calculations 
(e.g., pressure variation, annular deformation) are determined with 

respect to t = 0
–
 day. Figure 4.21 shows the wellbore pressure profiles 

for the 0
+
-day production time. In addition to the magnitude of the 

pressure being a concern to the wellbore integrity, the pressure 

difference between the inward and the outward tube is perhaps the most 

worrisome issue related to APB, since the loads originated from this 

difference might lead to the wellbore failure (i.e. casing and/or tubing 

bursting or collapsing). Hence, despite the fact that the magnitude of 

pressure in annulus C is the largest, the pressure difference between 

annulus A and B immediately above the TOC of annulus B is the 
highest for this production time step (e.g. 23 MPa) and, consequently, 

the most critical. 

 

 



129 

 

 

 
Figure 4.21 – Wellbore pressure profiles for the 0

+
-day production time. 

 

The wellbore pressure profiles for the 1, 2 and 10-day production 

times are depicted in Figure 4.22, Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24, 

respectively. The same behavior described above can be seen for longer 

production times. Hence, assuming that the collapse resistance for the 10 

¾” casing (the most critical casing) is 51.78 MPa (i.e. according to API 

5CT/ISO 11960), the pressure differences calculated for 1, 2 and 10-day 

production times were 30.5, 31.6 and 34.3 MPa, respectively, which are 

lower than the MAASP – Maximum Allowable Annular Surface 

Pressure. Nevertheless, it is also important to evaluate the stresses on the 

other wellbore components, namely the 6 ?" tubing and the 13 ?" 

casing. With respect to the tubing, the largest pressure difference took 

place at the wellhead. Considering the worst case, i.e. the 10-day 

production time, the largest pressure difference was 10.89 MPa, while 

the 6 ?” tubing collapse resistance is 43.51 MPa. Finally, regarding the 

13 ?” casing, the large pressure difference was 21.9 MPa, while the 

collapse resistance of such casing is 24.54 MPa.

thermal expansion) is shown in Table 4.7 between brackets.

It can be seen from Table 4.7 that for annuli B and C the APB 

caused by fluid expansion, namely APBT, is higher than the combined 



132 

 

APB due to fluid expansion and tubular radial strains. This happens 

since the multistring approach allows the pressure inside an annulus to 

influence the pressure in other annuli. For instance, for annulus A, the 

average strain experienced by the 6 ?” produced an extra volume that 

was larger than the volume reduction due to the 10 ¾” casing 

deformation. Thus, the APBT contributed positively to the global APB. 

Conversely, for annulus B, the outward 13 ?” casing, experienced lesser 

strain than the inward casing, yielding a negative contribution to the 

overall APB. In fact, the tube strain at a given production time is defined 

as 

 

   
 
 

     
 

    
 

 (4.2) 

 

where     
  is the external radius of the tube at a given production time, 

and      
 
 is the difference between     

   and     
 , with     

   being 

the external radius of the tube at instant 0
-
 days (initial time)  

Figure 4.26, Figure 4.27 and Figure 4.27 show the tubular local 

deformations along the wellbore for 0
+
, 1 and 10-day production times. 

It should be noted that the internal and the external diameters of a given 

tube always experience the same elongation/shrinkage. Thus, only the 

external diameter of the tubes forming each annulus was plotted. For 

annulus C, the strain relative to the inner diameter of the casing was also 

plotted. Furthermore, the API states that the limit tube strain for steel-

composed materials is 0.5% to ensure that the tube structural behavior is 

within the elastic limit. 

As the tubes deformation is calculated locally, it is quite easy to 

observe the effect of the wellbore components and changes of formation 

layers on the tubing/casing diameter, as observed previously in the 

temperature profiles. For very short transients (i.e. 0
+
-day production 

time), the discontinuities observed in the strain curves are caused by the 

wellbore components as a consequence of changes in magnitude of the 

heat transfer rate. The most significant discontinuity is due to a short 

fluid layer (“fluid ring”) between two cement sections in annulus C. 

Other discontinuities are due to the casing shoes. 



133 

 

 

 
Figure 4.25 – Tube deformations for 0

+
-day production time simulation. 

 

 
Figure 4.26 – Tube deformations for 1-day production time simulation. 

 

Also, qualitatively the same behavior is observed for short 

transients (i.e. 1-day) and steady-state (i.e. 10-day) production times. 



134 

 

The discontinuity observed in the 13 ?” casing strain curve is caused by 

the fluid ring, while the discontinuities seen in the 10 ¾” strain curve are 

due to the formation layer transitions. Similar to the thermal responses, 

at short production times, larger values of tube deformation are observed 

at the points of structural transition in the well, such as the depths of 

1,470 m and 2040 m, where the casing seats are located. As the 

production time increases, the impact of the wellbore components on the 

deformation of the tubes decreases. 

 

 
Figure 4.27 – Tube deformation for 10-day production time simulation. 

  

It should be noted that the APB is undeniably accompanied by a 

variation of the annulus volume, as previously explained. This volume 

variation may be positive or negative depending whether the diameter of 

the tubes forming that annulus has decreased or increased. The variation 

in the annulus volume was calculated as follows:

 is the annulus volume at a given production time in days and 

  
  

 is the initial annulus volume, that is, the annulus volume at instant 

0
-
 days.

The annuli volume variations for the 5 simulated production 

times are presented in Table 4.8. Note that the initial volume of annulus 

A, B and C were 63.62, 44.24 and 52.80 m
3
, respectively.

the reduction in the 10 ¾” and 13 ?” casing diameters, which 

contributed to alleviating the pressure increase. In other words, the 

results from Table 4.7 and Table 4.8 show the importance of both fluid 

expansion and tube deformation contributions on the APB prediction.    

 

4.2.8 Mechanical model validation 

In order to validate the APB results, the values calculated by the 

mechanical model were compared with field data. Figure 4.28 shows a 

complete set of flowing fluid and production annulus pressure data 

available for well A with the hydrocarbon production kick off at the 

zeroth hour on February 22
nd

. As observed in Figure 4.28, using the 

pressure data as an input, the calculated annulus wellhead pressure at 

different production times (0
+
, 1, 2, 5 and 10 days) agreed well with the 

field data.

Deviations as low as 3.71 % were observed for the entire data set. 

At earlier production times, larger deviations of the calculated annulus 

pressure relative to field data due to the APB are observed. As the 

production time increases, the deviation decreases, reaching a value 

around 2% at steady state. 



137 

 

 

As a means to further validate the proposed calculation method, 

the APB predictions were compared against the commercial software 

WellCat™. Figure 4.29 and Figure 4.30 show the wellbore pressure 

profiles for simulations at the following production times: 1 and 10 

days. 

 

 
Figure 4.29 – Wellbore fluid pressures obtained from the present model and 

commercial software for the well A for 1-day production time using N2 filled 

annulus A. 

 

The comparison revealed that the commercial software 

overestimated the pressures in the annuli, especially in annulus A. One 

should notice that while the reasoning for the high-pressure difference is 

somewhat unclear, such difference could be associated to how the 

commercial software models gas filled annulus – note that the difference 

in pressure for annulus A between the simulations was over 50 MPa. In 

this case, if well A had been subjected to this pressure magnitude, the 6 

?” tubing would have collapsed.  

 

 



138 

 

 
Figure 4.30 – Wellbore fluid pressures obtained from the present model and 

commercial software for well A for 10-day production time using N2 filled 

annulus A. 

 

More compelling evidences that the commercial software cannot 

handle compressible fluids properly were provided from simulations 

performed using only brine as a packer fluid (i.e., N2 is replaced with 

brine). Figure 4.31 and Figure 4.32 show the pressure profiles obtained 

from both simulators for production times of 1 and 10 days. When brine 

entirely fills annulus A, the deviation between the models is 

significantly reduced. Also, the results showed that when a compressible 

fluid such as N2 is used in the production annulus, besides providing 

thermal insulation as observed in Section 4.2.4, it has a major effect on 

the wellbore mechanical behavior. For instance, for a 1-day production 

time, the wellhead pressure in annulus A changed from 27.35 MPa to 

71.74 MPa by replacing N2 with brine. This behavior is somewhat 

expected since an almost incompressible fluid, such as brine, has a high 

impact on the deformation of tubes.

software for well A for 10-day production time using brine filled annulus A. 



140 

 

From the results presented in this section, one concludes that the 

magnitude of the pressures in the wellbore increases dramatically when 

brine was employed as a packer fluid. To better quantify these 

differences, Figure 4.33 shows the wellbore pressures for both cases (N2 

and brine filled annulus) considering a production time of 1 day. Even 

though the N2 present in annulus A is capable of reducing the pressure 

throughout the well, this reduction is much greater in the Annulus A 

itself, about 44.4 MPa, while in annuli B and C, this value was 19.1 and 

5.9 MPa, respectively.

4.3 Analysis of Heat Transfer in a VIT Assisted Wellbore  

Heat transfer in wellbores with VIT joints is singular since the 

thermal resistances of the insulated tubes may be larger than those of 

associated with the formation. As a result, the wellbore thermal 

resistance plays an important role for both short transient and longer 

production times. 



141 

 

 

Initial simulations were performed considering a string with only 

10 VIT joints, which represents the first 100 m from the wellhead. In 

this preliminary assessment, the inner and outer VIT surface temperature 

profiles were analyzed, as well as the VIT equivalent thermal resistance 

and the radiative heat transfer coefficient in the VIT evacuated 

enclosure.  

In a second step, well A is modeled with 60 VIT joints aiming to 

eliminate the risk on the wellbore integrity due to APB. Results obtained 

from the Wellcat™ software were used to reinforce the validity of the 

present numerical approach.  

4.3.1 Wellbore with 10 VIT Joints 

The results from the simulations performed for well A with 10 

VIT joints are depicted in Figure 4.34 and Figure 4.35 in terms of the 

wellbore fluid temperatures (Figure 4.34), the flowing fluid pressure and 

heat transfer rate per unit length (Figure 4.35), respectively, for a 10-day 

production (almost steady-state). In these simulations, the emissivity of 

the evacuated surfaces was set as 0.75.  

 

 
Figure 4.34 – Well A temperature profiles while using 10 VIT joints. 

 



142 

 

It can be seen in Figure 4.34 that the wellbore temperature 

profiles are highly affected by the use of the VIT joints, as expected. 

Since the VIT system shows different thermal resistances depending on 

the position considered in the analysis, a significant variation in the 

temperature profiles was observed in the annuli as well as in the 

wellbore/formation interface. Thus, the amplitudes of the temperature 

variations in the VIT region were of 47.2, 41.3, 39.3 and 33.5 K for 

annuli A, B and C and at the interface, respectively. 

  

 
Figure 4.35 – Well A pressure and heat transfer profiles while using 10 VIT 

joints. 

 

As observed in Figure 4.35, the pressure profile was not 

significantly influenced by the presence of the VIT joints - the flowing 

fluid wellhead pressure changed from 16.47 MPa for a bare pipe 

simulation against 16.49 MPa for the VIT assisted well. Also, as shown 

for the temperature profiles (Figure 4.34), the variations can also be seen 

in the plot of the heat transfer rate along the wellbore (see Figure 4.35). 

In the regions near the connection, the heat transfer rate,   , reached 
values close to 379 W/m, while near the center of the VIT joints, this 

value was 156 W/m. Furthermore, it is clear the use VIT close to the 

wellhead significantly reduces the radial heat transfer. 



143 

 

 

A close-up view of the VIT performance shows the variation of 

   and the radiation heat transfer coefficient of the evacuated cavity 
along the well (Figure 4.36). For the nodes close to the weld, where the 

temperature difference between the external surface of the inner tube 

and the internal surface of the outer tube is lower, the    was 7.2 
W/m

2
.K, while near the center of the VIT,    was 6.0 W/m

2
.K. 

 
Figure 4.36 – Heat transfer behavior on the VIT joints. 

 

It is important to realize that the heat transfer coefficients due to 

forced convection (in the tubing string) and natural convection (in the 

annular space) are affected by the presence of the VIT joints. The forced 

convection coefficient is more affected by the VIT geometry variation. 

On the other hand, the natural convection coefficients are affected by the 

change in insulation caused by VIT, which tends to reduce the 

temperatures of the surfaces in the annuli and, hence, their respective 

Rayleigh numbers. Figure 4.37 shows the variation in the heat transfer 

coefficients along the wellbore. It is possible to observe large variations 

in all heat transfer coefficients in the VIT assisted section of the well. 

 

 



144 

 

 
Figure 4.37 – Convection heat transfer coefficients behavior along the well A. 

 

In order to observe the insulation capability of the VIT joints, 

both internal and external surfaces temperature profiles were plotted in 

Figure 4.38. Near the connections, the temperature difference is small 

(because of the small thermal resistance), and increases sharply away 

from the connection reaching a plateau 2.3 m and 1.6 m away from the 

center of the connection for the lower and upper VIT connection, 

respectively. Although, the VIT joint presents a symmetry plane in the z 

axis, the boundary conditions as well as the numerical error lead to a 

non-symmetrical thermal behavior offered by the insulated joints. 

Hence, for the center position, the average temperature difference 

reached the value of 50.9 K considering the 10 VIT joints. 

It has been observed from previous results that the VIT is the 

element of the wellbore that affects the heat transport towards the rock 

formation the most. Its thermal performance is highly dependent on the 

emissivity of the tubes surfaces, which can be affected in a number of 

ways (Siegel and Howell, 1992). Thus, a sensitivity analysis of the 

emissivity was performed in order to evaluate its effect on the wellbore 

thermal behavior. Figure 4.39, Figure 4.40 and Figure 4.41 show the 

annulus A temperature profiles along the VIT joints considering 0.65, 

0.75 and 0.85 emissivity for three production times of 0
+
, 1 and 10 days. 



145 

 

 

As expected, the three graphs (in Figure 4.39, Figure 4.40 and Figure 

4.41) showed a similar behavior for the external VIT surface 

temperature profile (see Figure 4.38). 

 

 
Figure 4.38 – VIT temperature profiles at the internal and external surfaces. 

 

Close to the connections, the temperature profiles of the annular 

fluid are the same regardless of the surface emissivity. In addition, it can 

be seen that a large temperature difference between the 8th and the 9th 

joints occurred, which can be associated with the additional thermal 

resistance caused by the presence of the cement sheath of the 30” casing 

resulting in a temperature drop. 

As the time increases, the wellbore thermal resistances diminish 

their importance in the heat transfer process. This is noticed by 

observing the smallest annular temperature drop between the 8th and the 

9th VIT joint temperature profile in Figure 4.40 and Figure 4.41.  

Table 4.10 shows the average temperature of the external surface 

of the VIT joints for the 9 cases evaluated. The results show that the 

difference between employing a low or a more conservative value of 
emissivity for the VIT were 1.9, 2.3 and 2.6 K for production time steps 

of 0+, 1 and 10 days, respectively. While these temperature changes are 

somewhat small, one should consider that an inaccuracy of this 

magnitude can represent a considerable uncertainty in the decision-

making process regarding the use of VIT tubes.

4.3.2 Comparison of the integrated model with the commercial 
software 

The first attempt to validate the coupled model has been carried 

out by comparing the results from simulations performed with the 

proposed model and the commercial software WellCat™. To this end, 

well A was modeled with 60 VIT joints considering the same 



148 

 

simulation/operational parameters previously described in section 4.1.2. 

The choice for this number of VIT joints is justified by the extension of 

annulus B, where high heat transfer rates can be found.  

Figure 4.42 to Figure 4.47 show the fluid temperatures for well A 

using the present model (Figure 4.42 and Figure 4.43) and the 

commercial software (Figure 4.44, Figure 4.45, Figure 4.46 and Figure 

4.47) for two different production times. Figure 4.44 and Figure 4.45 

show the temperature profiles for a single k-value to characterize the 

VIT joints, i.e. 0.074 W/m.K. Figure 4.46 and Figure 4.47 show the 

results for simulations assuming 2 k-values: one for the connection 

section, which comprises 6% of the VIT length (i.e. the same as the 

carbon steel material, 16 W/m.K), and another for the remaining length 

of the VIT (0.074 W/m.K), a methodology also considered in Barcelos 

et al. (2017).   
It is important to mention that the value of 0.074 W/m.K is the 

same used by Ferreira et al. (2012) in well B, as recommended by the 
VIT supplier as the design k-value for VIT joints to be installed in well 

B. Therefore, for the simulations employing the commercial software 

for well A, the use of this k-value is only an approximation since there 

are no guidelines for the k-value for well A.  

 

 
Figure 4.42 – Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 1-day 

production time using the present model. 



149 

 

 

The large temperature variations predicted by the present model (which 

considers the two-dimensional nature of the heat transfer process in the 

VIT joints) caused the curves to overlap, as can be seen in Figure 4.42 

and Figure 4.43. The same overlapping is observed in Figure 4.46 and 

Figure 4.47, however, here, they are caused by the two different k-

values used to represent the VIT’s thermal performance. 

 

 
Figure 4.43 – Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 10-day 

production time using the present model. 

 

The use of a single k-value (Figure 4.44 and Figure 4.45) yielded 

a dramatic temperature drop in all annuli, suggesting that this approach 

is questionable, which somehow explains the use of artificially high k-

values to compensate for the high annular temperature drop. Differently, 

the use of two k-values reduced the average temperatures in annuli, 

however, a large temperature difference of up to 68 K close to the 

wellhead still remained at specific locations (with respect to annulus A 

for simulation at 1-day production time). The model proposed in this 

work showed that, in addition to the temperature differences being much 

smaller than those given by the two k-values approach, the temperature 

range is also lower. For example, the temperature difference close to the 

wellhead is about 31 K with respect to annulus A for the simulation at 1-

day production time.

Table 4.11 shows the average temperature computed for all 

annuli in each simulation performed at the production time steps of 1 

and 10 days.

As expected, the average temperature in each annulus increased 

as the production time increased. The present model showed the largest 

average temperatures for all simulations, which may be indicating that 

the k-value used here (which was designed to be used in well B) was 

overestimated. Furthermore, although not ideal, the use of 2 k-values as 

input parameters in the commercial software may be a good strategy to a 

better representation of the VIT system thermal resistance. 

It is also important to realize that the different annuli have distinct 

temperature variations depending on the wellbore depth. For instance, 

while annulus A comprises whole simulation domain, annulus C 

comprises the range from 1,387 m (seabed) to the 13 ?” casing TOC, 

which is located at 2,040 m of depth. Therefore, the average temperature 

of annulus C is much lower than that of annulus A, which is in direct 

contact with the higher temperatures in the wellbore. 

The effect of the thermal insulation provided by the VIT system 

on the pressure increase was also investigated. Figure 4.49 and Figure 

4.49 show the annuli pressure profiles for simulations performed at 1 

and 10-day production times, respectively, using the three thermal 

approaches.  

 



153 

 

 

 
Figure 4.48 – Pressure profiles in each annuli for a 1-day production time using 

the three approaches. 

 

The flowing fluid pressure profiles predicted by the three 

calculation methods agreed well. However, the pressure profiles for 

annuli A and B showed higher values for the commercial software 

simulations. Here two points deserve attention with regard to the large 

difference in the value of APB calculated from the different approaches: 

(i) as abovementioned, the commercial code does not handle 

compressible fluids, as the N2 present in annulus A, properly, generating 

high pressures; (ii) the commercial software tends to generate 

conservative loads while VIT joints are employed, due to the 
uncertainties on the simplification of using the k-value concept. 

Regarding annulus C, the present model predicted a higher value for 1-

day of production, while the pressure profiles for a 10-day production 

time were similar for all approaches. The reason for this may lie in the 

difference in how the approaches face the deformation of cemented 



154 

 

casings and deal with the fluid expansion behavior. It should be 

remembered that the average temperature in annulus C was much lower 

than in other annuli, which strongly influences the fluid expansion and, 

consequently, the increase in pressure.  
 

 
Figure 4.49 – Pressure profiles in each annuli for a 10-day production time 

using the three approaches. 

 

The stress analysis also shows that when the commercial software 

is used (assuming a single or a combination of two k-values), a tube 

collapse is predicted due to an excessive pressure difference on the 6 ?” 

tubing string. In the present model, however, all loads presented much 

lower values than the tubular mechanical resistances.  

Figure 4.50 shows the annuli pressure profiles variation results 

from simulations performed for various production times. 

 



155 

 

 

 
Figure 4.50 – Annuli pressure profiles as a function of the production time for 

simulations performed using the present model. 

 

 The pressure profile in Annulus C is more affected by the 

production time, which indicates that the deformation of tubulars has a 

significant effect on the pressure increase. This is because the VIT joints 

covered almost the entire depth range of annulus C, thus reducing the 

heat transfer toward the annuli. 

Table 4.12 summarizes the APB loads for each simulation 

performed with the present model.

The results shown in Table 4.12 reinforce the hypothesis that 

annulus C is less affected by the annular space heating process along the 

time. Even though the APB load due to fluid expansion caused by the 

heating was the highest among all annuli, the increase in pressure was 

basically time independent, while the total APB varied significantly due 

to tubular deformation. 

Figure 4.51, Figure 4.52 and Figure 4.53 show the local 

deformation for the 6 ?” tubing, 10 ¾” and 13 ?” casings relative to the 

external diameter considering 0
+
, 1 and 10 days of production time. 

In essence, the local values of tube deformation in the presence of 

VIT joints were negative, indicating that all tubes experienced a 

reduction in the external diameter throughout the wellbore. As 

mentioned above, annulus C experienced the largest diameter variation, 

but still lies within a comfortable zone with respect to the elastic limit of 

the material. 

Furthermore, since the tube strain is computed locally, as is the 

heat transfer rate, for the VIT range depth, the strain varies significantly 

following the heat transfer behavior. 

It is important to notice that all tubes experienced a reduction in 

the external diameter for very short production times. For a 1-day 

production, the values of strain experienced by the 6 ?” tubing and 10 

¾” casing along the VIT range depth were quite the same as presented 

in Figure 4.52. Furthermore, since the current mechanical model 

neglected the fact that an evacuated gap separates the inner and the outer 

tubes forming the VIT, the strain behavior of the 6 ?” tubing requires 

attention. This is because, for a bare tube, there is always a backpressure 

that contributes to the pressure in each annulus at each iteration loop. 

For the case of using VIT joints, the backpressure does not exist.

According to Table 4.13, annulus C showed a large volume 

change for a very short transient production time, while annulus B 

presented a negative volume variation. Then, as the time increases, the 



159 

 

 

volume variation in annulus B significantly increased while a reverse 

effect occurred in annulus C. The volume in annulus A always 

experienced a contraction as time increased. Considering the volume 

variation in the annuli, the deformation of the tubes and the APB results, 

the following remarks can be made:  

? the annulus C fluid expansion was significant for a very short 
production time, i.e., when the wellbore is still thermally 

unaffected and subjected to high heat transfer rates. Thus, the 

insulation provided by the VIT system dramatically reduced 

the heat transfer. As a result, the APB contribution due to 

fluid expansion remained almost unchanged. However, the 

overall APB increased due to a reduction in the annulus 

volume resulting from a significant deformation of the 13 ?” 

casing, while the 20” casing internal diameter remained 

constant because of the mechanical support provided by the 

cement. 

? with respect to annulus B, initially, the volume reduction was 
caused by the 13 ?” casing, which, due to the inexpressive 

annulus B fluid expansion and the substantial load produced 

by the annulus C fluid expansion against annulus B, suffered a 

diameter reduction. Then, the annulus B experienced a 

significant increase in pressure due to fluid expansion, while 

in annuli A and C the fluids did not experience a large 

variation as a function of time.    

Finally, the effect of using VIT systems on the APB was assessed 

by performing simulations for well A with and without the insulated 

tubes at production times of 0
+
, 1 and 10 days, as can be seen in Figure 

4.54, Figure 4.55 and Figure 4.56. 

The use of VIT joints has a direct effect on the heat transfer and 

the reduction of the pressure increase in the annuli. In terms of the 

reduction in the global APB value, Table 4.14 summarizes the APB 

expected for the three annuli at three different production time steps (0
+
, 

1 and 10-day production times) for the cases of a wellbore with and 

without VIT.

161 

 

 

As expected, using VIT joints led to a drop in the pressure 

increase throughout the wellbore. Annulus C was the most affected by 

the VITs, since it was almost fully assisted by them, while annulus B 

and C had only the upper part covered by the VIT joints. Annulus A was 

the least affected since it was filled with N2, which provides a relief on 

the increase in pressure due to its high compressibility.

Even though annulus A experienced the larger APB percentage 

reduction considering the simulations performed with and without VIT 

joints, in absolute pressure terms, annuli B and C showed higher APB 

drops – 22.67 MPa for annulus C after 10 days of production. This is 

because annulus A is filled with N2 that works well in sustaining 

pressure due to its high compressibility. 

 

4.4 Evaluation of the Integrated Model using a Real VIT Assisted 
Well 

In this section, the integrated model results are compared with 

field data and with the Wellcat™ software for simulations of well B, 

which is assisted by 108 VIT joints. As mentioned before, according to 

the commercial supplier of the VIT joints used in this well, the single k-

value used in Wellcat™ was 0.074 W/m.K.  

    

4.4.1 Validation of the Integrated Model 

Figure 4.57 shows a complete set of flowing fluid pressure and 

temperature data available for well B while oil and gas are produced in 

steady-state (kick off data are not available for this well). The sampling 

frequency of the PDG and wellhead pressure and temperature data was 

approximately 1 data point per hour. Using the PDG pressure and 

temperature as an input, the calculated wellhead pressure and 

temperature at 0
+
 and 10-day production times agreed well with the field 

data. At this point, it is important to realize that despite the fact that 

short production time simulations were performed (i.e. 0
+
-day 

production time), the results were used just as an illustration for 

comparison purposes.  

 



163 

 

 

 
Figure 4.57 – Field data and simulation results for the well B. 

 

The simulated thermal and pressure profiles along the wellbore 

and the field data obtained for the two end points of the tubing string 

(i.e. at the wellhead and PDG depths) for the flowing fluid showed a 

good agreement. For a production time of 0
+
 day (very short transient), 

the hydrocarbon pressure and temperature at the wellhead were 4.13 

MPa and 328.0 K, respectively. At steady state, the simulated 

hydrocarbon stream pressure and temperature at the wellhead were 4.67 

MPa and 356.4 K, respectively. The present model showed deviations of 

0.74 MPa (13.7 %) and 6.1 K at the wellhead depth. It is noteworthy that 

for well B the uncertainties regarding the input parameters and the 

boundary conditions were larger than those for well A. Figure 4.58 

shows a set of the flowing fluid and production annulus pressure data 

available for the well B during the steady state production. 

As observed, the calculated annulus wellhead pressure for a 10-

day production time (steady state) showed a considerable deviation with 

respect to the field data. According to the present model, the pressure in 

annulus A was 26.58 MPa after 10 days of production, while the 

measured pressure was 16.52 MPa. The deviation of about 37.9 % can 

be explained by the following: (i) the mechanical model considers the 

VIT joint as a single tube, that is, it totally neglects the deformation of 

the outer tube over the vacuum gap, instead, considers that the outer 

tube deforms against the flowing production fluid, resulting in lower 



164 

 

pressures and (ii) the uncertainties associated with the many input 

parameters and also boundary conditions, such as the geothermal 

gradient. 

  

 
Figure 4.58 – Pressure data set for well B along the production time. 

 

In order to compare the results generated by the present model 

and by the commercial software, Figure 4.59 shows the hydrocarbon 

stream pressure and temperature profiles for production times of 0
+
 and 

10 days (present model) and 12 h, 1 day and 10 days (commercial 

software). Due to the high computational cost associated with the 

present model, only simulations for 0
+
 and 10-day production times 

were considered in this study.  

As expected, the temperature profile for the 0
+
-day production 

time is quite different from the other simulated times. Thus, for very 

short times the temperature profile is affected only by the wellbore 

thermal resistances and the absolute temperatures along the wellbore are 

supposed to be much lower than the temperatures computed for longer 

times. The agreement between the present model and WellCat is very 

good given the different time steps regarding the transient simulations. 

For steady-state production (10-day production time), the thermal results 

agree reasonably well, showing deviations of the order of 6.5 K at the 

wellhead position. It is important to realize that this temperature 

difference is around 4.5 K at the bottom of the VIT column, which 



165 

 

 

means that in nearly 1,100 m of VIT joints the deviation between the 

models was around 2 K. 
 

 
Figure 4.59 – Temperature and pressure profiles for the hydrocarbon stream for 

simulations performed with the present model and using the commercial 

software for well B. 

 

The calculated pressure profiles are also consistent for this 

deviated well, although different multiphase flow models have been 

used, i.e., Beggs and Brill (1973) in the present model and Hagedorn 

and Brown (1965) in the commercial software. Deviations of the order 

of 0.13 MPa (2.7%) were obtained at steady state, revealing a very good 

agreement between the thermal-hydraulic models. 

Table 4.15 summarizes the average temperatures in annuli A, B 

and C for a 10-day production time using the present model and the 

commercial software with one and two k-values.

Different from the results for well A, the average temperature in 

annuli A and B calculated by the present model showed the lowest 

values among the three simulations performed. Moreover, as expected, 

the 2 k-values simulation showed results closer to the present model. 

One should remember that, in this particular well, a single k-value of 

0.074 W/m.K was calibrated by the supplier of the VIT joints. This 

appears to be a conservative k-value, as it leads to higher average 

temperature in annuli A and B. Also, the large difference between the 

average temperatures in annuli A and B calculated by the commercial 

software may be questionable since these annuli have almost the same 

length. Conversely, the average temperature in annulus C predicted by 

the present model was the largest among the three approaches. This is 

due to the short length of annulus C, which is more influenced by the 

heat transfer in the region close to the seabed. 

In terms of the annuli pressure response, Figure 4.64 shows the 

pressure profiles for simulations performed for a 10-day production time 

using the present model and the commercial software, respectively. For 

the latter, a single k-value of 0.074 W/m.K and two k-values of 16 

W/m.K for the connection section (6% of the VIT length) and 0.074 

W/m.K for the VIT evacuated body section have been used. 

A comparison between the models shows that the pressure loads 

calculated by the commercial code for annuli A and B are much larger 

than those quantified by the present model. Even though the only field 

data available are for annulus A, they reveal that, although the 

agreement of the present model is far from outstanding, it is much better 

than the commercial software. As expected, the approach using two k-

values resulted in pressure loads higher than those with the single k-

value. In annulus C, the pressure profiles followed the average annulus 

C temperature results shown in Table 4.15. 

The stress analysis applied to well B during hydrocarbon 

production indicated that all predicted loads were within the mechanical 

limits of the tubes. However, caution must be exercised when examining 

the high load difference between the present model and the commercial 

code.

4.4.2 Thermal-structural study of well B 

Initially, the well thermal-hydraulic behavior is illustrated in 

Figure 4.61, which shows the heat transfer rate per unit length and the 

superficial velocities of the liquid and gas hydrocarbons.  

As can be seen in Figure 4.61, the marked changes in liquid 

superficial velocity are caused by changes in tubing string diameter at 

the depths of 2,171, 3,500 and 4,000 m. With respect to the gas 

superficial velocity, the blue curve shows that up to a depth of 3,196 m, 

the flow was single-phase liquid. From there, a two-phase hydrocarbon 

mixture was formed and, at the bottom of the VIT string, the gas 

velocity increased considerably due to: (i) the reduction of the tubing 

string diameter that increased the pressure gradient, and (ii) the fact that 
the tubing string became hotter with the use of the VIT system. The 

pressure gradient is a function of the three contributions: frictional, 

gravitational and accelerational. In the present system, the accelerational 

contribution is mainly a localized effect related to the tubing diameter 

change. The frictional is strongly influenced by the hydrocarbon mixture 



168 

 

vapor content, so it becomes less important as the depth increases. The 

gravitational contribution also depends on the vapor content, but is also 

influenced by the well inclination. It can be observed that the pressure 

gradient decreased up to depth of around 3,100 m. Close to this depth 

two events take place: the beginning of the hydrocarbon mixture 

vaporization and the wellbore verticalization, i.e., the KOP is at 3,013 

m. Hence, more gas into the tubing and higher gravitational pressure 

gradient contributes to the faster decrease of the absolute pressure of the 

flowing fluid. 

 

 
Figure 4.61 – Heat exchange and hydrocarbon liquid and gas superficial 

velocities for a simulation at 0
+
-day production. 

 
On the other hand, larger variations in the heat transfer rate are 

due to the presence of the TOC and casing seat, that is, the interface 

between the annulus fluid and the cement in an annulus. Likewise, as 

previously observed, the use of VIT joints yields a large variation (range 



169 

 

 

from 2,171 m depth to the wellhead) in the heat transfer rate due to the 

large difference between the thermal resistances of the VIT evacuated 

body and the connection region. Figure 4.62 shows the order of 

magnitude of the various components arranged in the wellbore. 

 

 
Figure 4.62 – Thermal resistivity profiles of the wellbore components for a 

simulation at 0
+
-production time. 

 

Firstly, the difference between the values of fluid and solid 

thermal resistivity deserve some attention. As described in Chapter 3, 

while for a single tube the thermal resistivity is a function only of the 

geometry and thermal conductivity, for the annulus and flowing fluids it 

depends on the heat transfer coefficient, which can depend on the local 

temperature (i.e. tubing outer surface and casing inner surface 

temperatures in the case of the annulus fluid).  

A qualitative assessment of the components of the overall thermal 

conductance reveals that the natural convection thermal resistivity and 

the thermal resistivity associated with the forced convection of the 
flowing fluid differ by one order of magnitude, since the heat transfer 

coefficient of the flowing fluid is much higher than that of fluids in the 

annuli. The scales of the thermal resistivity in annuli A and B are 

equivalent, even though annulus A contains a water based fluid and 

annulus B a synthetic fluid. It should be noted that annuli B and C are 



170 

 

filled with the same base fluid. The thermal resistivity of the tubes is 

virtually constant up to the VIT bottom. From there, the thermal 

resistivity dramatically increases by about two orders of magnitude, 

changing from 0.0115 to 0.2400 m
2
.K/W. 

Figure 4.63 and Figure 4.64 show the wellbore temperature 

profiles for 0
+
 and 10-day production times, respectively.     

 

 
Figure 4.63 – Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a 0

+
-day production time. 

 

For very short production times, as previously reported, the effect 

of the wellbore components on the temperature profiles become more 

evident, i.e., the annulus fluid/cement transitions at 1,802 and 4,050 m 

deep, the casing seats at 1,909 and 3,543 m deep and the VIT joints 

bottom at 2,171 m. Figure 4.63 clearly shows that the effect of the VIT 

joints is much stronger than that offered by the cement sheaths in terms 

of temperature drop along the wellbore. 

As previously discussed, the heat transfer in the wellbore is not 

affected by thermal resistances other than those in the wellbore until the 

0
+
 time is reached. Henceforth, in the case of using VIT joints, both the 

wellbore and the formation play an important role in the heat transfer 

process, since the VIT thermal resistance is larger than that offered by 
formation. 

After 10 days of production the wellbore thermal behavior 

changes greatly showing the relevance of the VIT presence. Basically, 

other wellbore components and the different formation layers have less 

influence on the wellbore temperature profiles.

Table 4.16 summarizes the APB for simulations performed for 0
+
 

and 10-day production times with the present model. 

Even though the complete history of the pressure behavior over 

the production time is not shown, it can be seen from Table 4.16 that 

annulus C was more affected by both the fluid expansion and tube 

deformation. Also, while the fluid expansion contribution decreased 

over time, the overall APB increased revealing the strong contribution 

of tube deformation to APB for this case.

172 

 

 
Figure 4.65 – Tube deformations for a 0

Firstly, it is important to realize that the 6 ?” tubing (i.e. the 

tubing is formed by a combined pipe diameters, that is, 6 ?”, 5 ½” and 4 

½”) yielded the discontinuities observed in the strain profile. Basically, 

the local deformation of the 6 ?” tubing and the 13 ?” casing were 

negative, indicating that these tubes experienced a reduction in the 

external diameter along the wellbore. Conversely, the 9 ?” production 

casing experienced a small variation in the external diameter up to the 

13 ?” casing seat. From there, a large positive variation in the external 

diameter was observed, at a section facing the open hole. One should 

consider that unknown mechanical properties of the formation rock 

along uncemented sections may lead to an excessive deformation that, in 

turn, may cause an inaccurate pressure load prediction, as observed 

below the 13 ?” casing seat. Furthermore, at open hole sections the heat 

transfer rate is large, once only low thermal resistances (i.e. annuli and 

tubes thermal resistances) are taken into account in the heat transfer 

calculation. 

   



173 

 

 

 
Figure 4.66 – Tube deformations for a 10-day production time for well B. 

 

The main point of attention is the deformation experienced by the 

9 ?”, as mentioned above. As time increased, the deformation also 

increased, leading to a pressurization of annulus A and C, as observed in 

Table 4.16.  

Table 4.17 shows the volume variation for the simulations 

performed using the present model for 0
+
 and 10-day production times. 

Note that the initial volume of annulus A, B and C were 61.35, 89.06 

and 61.94 m
3
, respectively.

174 

 

Finally, it is possible to observe from Table 4.17 that annulus C 

behaved different from the other annuli, showing a volume reduction 

over time. This is because annulus C is supported by the cement behind 

the 20” casing. Thus, for well B, the wellbore mechanical configuration 

allowed the fluid in annulus B to expand, and the tubes forming annulus 

B forced annuli A and C, thereby increasing their absolute pressures.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS 

The main challenges that motivated this thesis were the heat 

transfer behavior through VIT joints and the effect of the heat exchange 

between the wellbore and the formation on the wellbore integrity. The 

study was, hence, divided in two parts: the theoretical investigation of 

the heat transfer through stand-alone VIT joints, and the incorporation 

of the resulting thermal model (the 2-D ETN model) in a multi-physics 

wellbore simulator. Then, the effect of VIT joints in the wellbore 

completion was parametrically assessed and further validated using field 

data from two offshore wells. The numerical model was used to 

integrate the different physical models for several interconnected 

phenomena in the wellbore showing a good agreement with both field 

data and computational results from a third-party commercial software 

package (WellCat
TM

). Under those circumstances, the following two 

sections will report the main conclusions and recommendations of the 

present study. 

 

5.1 Conclusions 

Among the potential solutions to preserve wellbore integrity from 

pressure buildup in the concentric annuli, VIT systems appear as an 

alternative to reduce radial heat transfer from the well to the formation. 

Based on a detailed heat transfer analysis in VIT joints, this thesis 

developed a thermal model to calculate the temperature distribution 

along the tubing string. This thermal model was subsequently 

incorporated into a wellbore simulator. 

Regarding the stand-alone VIT joint, the following conclusions 

can be drawn: 

? The 3-D FVM results suggested a significant influence of axial 
heat conduction through the tubing walls at regions distant up to 

1 m from the connection. Since these effects cannot be captured 

by 1-D radial heat transfer models, a 2-D ETN model was 

proposed as a low-computational cost alternative to a full 3-D 

analysis.  

? The ETN model was validated with the FVM results and then 
parametrically assessed. The results showed that the length and 

the emissivity of the materials forming the annulus gap had 

major effect on the VIT insulation capability. 



176 

 

? A methodology was developed to allow the quantification of the 
VIT effective thermal conductivity,    , and the VIT effective 

overall heat transfer coefficient,    . 

? Larger VIT tubing diameters (for instance the 6 ?” x 5 ½” 
system) do not mean better insulation since larger systems have 

narrower evacuated annulus gap, which directly influenced the 

heat transfer rate through the VIT. 

 

With respect to the thermal-hydraulic model initially developed 

by Hafemann et al. (2015) and Barcelos et al. (2017), and further 

validated in this thesis, the main conclusions were: 

? Two real offshore wells were used to validate the model. For 
well A, the model agreed well with both field data (i.e. 

deviations of 2.5% and 3.3 K for the pressure and temperature 

of the flowing fluid at the wellhead depth, respectively) and 

with the commercial code WellCat (i.e. deviations of 3.4% and 

3.7 K, for the same condition) for 1-day production time. 

Regarding well B, the pressure and temperature deviations at 

the wellhead were 13.7 % and 6.1 K for the field data and 2.7 % 

and 6.5 K for the commercial software, for a 10-day production 

time. The results can be considered a very good agreement, 

given the uncertainties of the input data. 

? A comprehensive investigation of well A was carried out to 
evaluate the influence of operating parameters, annulus fluid, 

formation types, as well as the available approaches to handle 

the annulus convection and the transient heat conduction in the 

formation on the wellbore heat transfer. It has been shown that: 

o The production time is of key importance to any wellbore 
thermal analysis, as the wellbore thermal resistances play 

an important role in the heat transmission during the early 

production stage. Therefore, the use of a modeling 

framework capable of handling all time scales experienced 

by the well during production seems like a more reliable 

approach to simulate the thermal diffusion from the 

wellbore to the formation; 

o The larger thermal resistances in the wellbore (cement 
sheaths and annulus fluid) are still smaller than the 

formation thermal resistance, for the case of a well without 

VIT joints. Therefore, from the wellbore modeling 

standpoint, during the early stages of production, any 



177 

 

 

change in the wellbore thermal model (e.g., the use of 

different correlations) may cause larger changes in the 

wellbore thermal behavior. As the production time 

increases, the formation drives the wellbore heat 

transmission. Furthermore, the thermal model is more 

affected by the variation of the formation layer properties 

due to the implementation of the Cheng et al. (2011) 

approach, which considers both the wellbore and formation 

heat capacities on the calculation of the transient 

dimensionless temperature. 

o The actual well simulated in this work used nitrogen in 
annulus “A” in connection with a gas-lift operation which 

was to be pursued during later stages of the well operation. 

The thermal aspects of this configuration were explored in 

the thesis, revealing a significant reduction of the heat 

transfer to the outward annuli and of the wellhead 

temperature. Although appropriate in a particular scenario 

involving gas-lift production during later stages, the use of 

N2 in the production annulus to reduce the heat transport to 

the outward annuli is not common and should be looked 

more carefully, as the gas may contain traces of hydrogen 

sulfide or even carbon dioxide which cause corrosion of 

the production casing when in contact with water, and/or 

leakage through the casing threads if an inappropriate 

connection is employed. 

 

The mechanical model was applied to well A and the results were 

validated with field data and compared with those from a commercial 

software. Then the above mentioned model was applied to well B. The 

conclusions about this study are cited as follows: 

? The model allowed the quantification of both contributions to 
the APB, namely the annulus fluid expansion and the local 

tube deformation. This is particularly important to the 

identification of factors leading to unsafe operating 

conditions, to the support of well design and eventually 

changes in wellbore mechanical schematics. 

? Deviations as low as 3.71 % were observed for the entire data 
set with respect of the wellhead annulus A pressure. For short 

production times, the deviations relative to field data due to 

the APB are larger. As the production time increases, the 



178 

 

deviation decreases, reaching a value around 2% at steady 

state.  

? Analogous to the heat transfer behavior, as the production 
time increases, the deformation of the tubes becomes less 

affected by the wellbore components. 

? The magnitude of the pressures in the wellbore increased 
dramatically when brine was employed as a packer fluid. This 

behavior reinforces the idea of using compressible fluids, like 

N2, to mitigate APB. 

? A comparison between the present model and the commercial 
software WellCat revealed that the latter overestimated the 

pressure in the annuli. Also, the high-pressure difference in 

annulus A could be associated to how the commercial 

software handles compressible fluids (such as N2). 

? Unknown mechanical and/or thermal properties of the 
formation rock along uncemented sections may lead to an 

excessive deformation that, in turn, may cause an inaccurate 

pressure load prediction. 

 

In order to demonstrate the effect of VIT joints on the wellbore 

thermal-structural behavior, two synthetic case studies were carried out 

using 10 and 60 insulated joints, respectively. The main findings are as 

follows: 

? Significant temperature variations were observed in the annuli 
and wellbore/formation interface. These temperature 

oscillations were driven by the changes in the local VIT thermal 

resistance, which is the dominating thermal resistance in the 

physical domain. 

? A sensitivity study on the value of the surface emissivity in the 
evacuated gap showed that, even for the case with only 10 VIT 

joints, the average annuli temperature difference were as large 

as 2.6 K. 

? A comparison of the present model with the commercial 
software using a single k-value or a combination of two k-

values showed that the present model showed the largest 
average temperatures for all simulations, which indicates that 

such k-values were poorly designed for well A. Also, another 

key point is that when 2 k-values are used as input parameters 

in the commercial software, although not ideal, it may be a 



179 

 

 

good strategy for a better representation of the VIT system 

thermal resistance. 

? A stress analysis of the well assisted by 60 VIT joints (i.e. the 
artificial case study) showed that using the commercial software 

for both approaches (assuming a single k-value or two k-

values), the load due to the pressure difference over the 6 5/8” 

tubing string would lead to collapse, while for the present 

model all loads presented much lower values than the tubular 

mechanical resistances. The large load difference is due, in part, 

to the different manners in which the models handle the gas 

filled annulus A. 

? As the strain is computed locally, and since the heat transfer 
varies significantly along the VIT length, the strain also varies 

significantly, since it is thermally dependent. 

 

Regarding the performance of the integrated model in predicting 

the behavior of well B, the following conclusions can be drawn:  

? Even though a considerable deviation with respect to field data 
for the pressure increase in annulus A at steady state was 

observed (37.9%), the present model showed a much better 

agreement than the best version (single k-value) of the 

commercial software (deviation of nearly 165%). This large 

deviation can be explained by the two following points: (i) the 

deformation of the outer tubing of the VIT is neglected in the 

mechanical model, and (ii) the many uncertainties related to the 

input parameters and boundary conditions, such as the 

geothermal gradient. 

? The average temperature in annuli A and B calculated by the 
present model showed the lowest values among the three 

assessed approaches. Moreover, as expected, the two k-value 

simulation showed results closer to those of the present model. 

A single k-value of 0.074 W/m.K was set by the VIT 

commercial supplier specifically for well B. This conservative 

k-value was employed leading to a higher annuli A and B 

average temperatures.  

? The stress analysis pointed out that all predicted loads were 
within the tubes mechanical limits. However, caution must be 

exercised when examining the high load difference between the 

present model and the commercial code.

5.2 Future Research Needs  

Although two actual wells were used to evaluate the models 

developed in this thesis, more work is needed to confirm the robustness 

of the integrated model and to gain more confidence in the results. 

Considering the progress made in this work, the following 

recommendations for future research can be listed: 

? Development of a two-dimensional formation heat diffusion 
model to estimate the heat transport between the rock formation 

and the seabed to show the heat loss to the sea; 

? Development of a structural model to take into account the 
deformation of the VIT outer tubing over the inner tubing due 

to the pressure increase in the production annulus. This may 

cause the deformation of the inner tubing that was neglected in 

this work. 

? Using parallel computation to reduce the computational cost for 
performing the VIT simulations. 

? A comprehensive study about the effect of fluid and formation 
properties uncertainties on the APB is needed to improve the 

reliability of the mathematical models. 

? Carry out experiments in standalone VIT joints (under 
laboratory conditions) to validate the thermal models presented 

in this thesis.

APPENDIX A 

This appendix shows the schematic representations of the VIT 

equivalent thermal circuits considering two different geometries based 

on the connection types employed: API (VIT 3 ½” x 2 ?”, see Figure 

A.2) or premium (VIT 6 ?” x 5 ½”, see 

Figure A.3). Such thermal circuits represent half VIT joint since 

symmetry planes are applied, so boundary conditions at each end are 

insulated. Each heat transfer mode embedded into the network is 

represented by thermal resistances in the radial and/or axial directions, 

and so connecting the nodal points. Hence, the thermal networks have 

been built to represent the VIT components: inner and outer tubes, weld, 

connection and the evacuated cavity. 

Figure A.1 depicts the legend used in both VIT thermal networks. 

Such legend takes into account the nomenclatures which have been used 

to define temperatures represented by the nodes, the heat transfer mode 

and the heat flow direction, as well as some VIT geometric 

characteristics.

APPENDIX B 

This appendix describes in detail the equations obtained from the 

VIT nodal network illustrated in Appendix A forming the system of 

equations. At steady state, the basic equation to represent the energy 

balance for the VIT cylindrical coordinates axisymmetric system on a 

unit area basis for a generic node into the VIT thermal network, in terms 

of temperature and thermal resistances is of the form  

 
           

      
 

           

      
 

           

      
 

           

      
   B.1 

 

where a node is defined by the (   ) combination into the VIT mesh,      

is the central node, and       ,       ,        and        are the 
temperatures at the adjacent nodes. The thermal resistances between 

adjacent nodes and the central node are given by       ,       ,        

and       .  

The present appendix was organized in order to first present the 

basic thermal resistances equations as a function of the reference heat 

exchange area, which in turn, is calculated as a function of the external 

diameter of the VIT outer tube. It is worthwhile mentioning that the 

thermal resistance (resistivity) is calculated here in (    )  ? . Then, 
all representative energy balance equations are quantified for each 

location into the VIT network.  

The thermal resistances for all heat transfer modes involved in the 

thermal circuit are shown in the following sub-sections. 

 

B.1 CONDUCTION 

Radial conduction resistance between two adjacent nodes 

displayed at the same axial position   is calculated as a function of the 
geometry at that position and of the thermal conductivity as follows 

 

    
   
  

   (
      
      

) B.2 

 



203 

 

 

where     is the heat exchange reference radius,    is the thermal 
conductivity of the carbon-steel tubing and        and        are, 

respectively, the outer and inner radii. 

With respect to the axial conduction between two adjacent nodes 

displayed at the same position  , the thermal resistance is calculated 
according to the following equation  

 

    
      
  

 B.3 

 

where        is the axial length between the two adjacent nodes. It 
should be noted that this resistance is influenced by the VIT mesh size. 

 

B.2 CONVECTION 

Convection heat transfer is applied at the VIT boundaries, while 

the VIT inner and outer surface walls are in contact with fluid. In the 

case of the internal VIT surface wall, which is in contact with the 

flowing fluid, a forced convection is taking place. For this situation, the 

forced convection thermal resistance is given by  

 

      
   
      

 
 

   
 B.4 

 

where        is the radius related to the VIT inner wall. Thus,   can be the 
position 1 or 5 depending on the axial position. The forced convection 

heat transfer coefficient,    , may be calculated using Chen’s correlation 
(1963) as follows   

 

         *

(
  
 

*   B.5  

 

where   is a flow parameter defined by the ratio of the two-phase 
Reynolds number to the liquid Reynolds number, based on the liquid 
hold-up. Although this approach was developed based on convective 

boiling data, the heat transfer is computed as a function of two different 

contributions: a convective and a nucleate boiling. Here, just the first 



204 

 

contribution has been considered.   is calculate as a function of the 
Martinelli’s parameter as follows 

 

  {
  

     (         
  )     

      
      

      
      

     B.6  

 

where the Martinelli’s parameter is defined as   

 

    (
   

 
*
   

(
  

  
*
   

(
  
  

)

   

     B.7  

 

Regarding to the VIT outer wall, the system is in contact with the 

annular cavity stagnant fluid. Under these circumstances, natural 

convection heat transfer takes place and for this reason, the convection 

thermal resistance may be calculated in this manner 

 

          
   

      
 
 

  
 B.8  

 

where        is the radius related to the VIT outer wall. Thus,   can be 

the position 7 or 9 depending on the axial position. The natural 

convection heat transfer coefficient,   , may be calculated considering 
the correlation for annulus gap provided by Hasan and Kabir (1994) 

based on the hydraulic diameter,   , as follows 
   

   
    (

        
      ? )

    
      

  
         (               )

   
   B.9  

 

where          is the casing internal radius,     is the annulus fluid 
thermal conductivity,    is the Rayleigh number for the annulus gap, 
calculated using the annulus fluid properties as follows 

 

   
    

    
 (               )

 
 (               )

     
 B.10

B.3 RADIATION 

Radiative heat transfer takes place at the VIT’s evacuated cavity, 

as well as between the inner casing wall and the VIT outer surface 

forming the production annular space. In both cases the radiative 

thermal resistance is defined as

where        may be the external radius of the inner tubing forming the 

VIT cavity or the external radius of the VIT outer tubing forming the 

production annulus, depending on the situation, and    is the radiation 
heat transfer coefficient which is calculated considering that in both 

cases the cavity is formed by long concentric cylinders

B.4 ENERGY BALANCE - SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS 

As abovementioned, the energy balance equations were 

developed in terms of the temperature difference between the 

temperature at the node and the adjacent nodes and the thermal 



206 

 

resistances as shown in Eq. B.1. According to Figures A.2 and A.3, 

there are a maximum of 9 nodes displayed along the VIT radial 

direction. Hence, in this case 9 energy balance equations are required, 

with the first and the ninth equations depending, respectively, on the 

fluid temperature due to the forced convection in the tubing and the 

casing inner surface temperature due to the natural convection and 

radiation in the annulus gap. Some examples on how the energy balance 

equations have been developed are shown in the following 

documentation.  

By convention, the adopted direction of the heat flow is upward 

and from the center to out of the VIT, flowing radially, in the latter case. 

As the equations are quite similar along the VIT axial direction, 

respecting the geometry aspects, only three examples are presented, in 

other words, the energy balance equations applied at nodes located in 

three different positions along the   direction.  
 

B.4.1 Lower extremity of the VIT joint 

At this location the boundary condition of adiabatic wall is 

applied thus, no heat exchange takes place between the lower extremity 

of the VIT and the last tubing arranged before the VIT joints.  

Figure B.4 shows the equivalent thermal circuit used to develop 

the system of equations for the present location. The following 

equations describe the energy balance applied at each node along the   
axis, i.e., in this location     and   varies from 5 to 9.

evacuated enclosure. Thus, a parallel circuit takes place in this interface 

as detailed in Figure B.5. The following equations show the energy 

balance applied at each node along the   axis at the interface between

In order to simplify the convective-radiate heat transfer modeling 

at the axial boundary of the coupling, average casing temperature and 

average natural convective heat transfer coefficients were used to 

determine the wall temperatures at nodes located in these regions, as 

shown in Figure B.4. It was applied the same correlation for calculating 

   in the annulus gap, i.e., Hasan and Kabir (2002).

Using average values was possible since the variation of    
between the upward and the downward nodes relative to the actual node 

is less than 3 %. Also, the radiation heat transfer coefficient,   , was 
neglected, once the scale of    is about 10 times higher than    .

APPENDIX C 

This appendix describes the GRAMP2 (General Runge-Kutta 

Annular Modeling Program), a flow pattern based prediction code which 

has been applied to deal with the multiphase flow in the well A. The 

original version of GRAMP2 can be found in the report provided by 

Barbosa and Hewitt (2006). 

 

C.1 THE SEPARATED FLOW MODEL 

The one-dimensional, steady-state momentum conservation 

equation for two-phase gas-liquid flow in a constant cross-section area 

channel can be written in terms of the total pressure gradient,     ? . 
This is as follows (Carey, 1992; Collier and Thome, 1994; Levy, 1999): 

 
  

  
 (

  

  
*
   

 (

*
    

    C.1  

 

where the subscripts    ,      and      denote the individual 
contributions due to flow acceleration, friction and gravity, respectively.  

 

C.2 THE BUBBLE FLOW REGIME 

In the bubble flow region, the Friedel (1979) correlation for 

frictional pressure drop in conjunction with the Zuber et al. (1967) 

correlation for void fraction are probably sufficiently accurate to 

calculate the total pressure gradient. In this region the frictional 

component is usually much smaller than the gravitational one. 

Thus, the friction factor is obtained as a function of the Reynolds 

number considering the flow mixture as a liquid,     , through the 
equation suggested by Friedel (1979):

function of the void fraction from Zuber (1967) is given by

*

 

 
     C.4  

 

C.3 THE BUBBLE TO SLUG REGIME TRANSITION 

The transition from bubble flow to slug flow has been 

successfully predicted by a simple criterion which dictates that the 

transition to slug flow takes place when the average void fraction 

reaches a critical value of around 0.25 (Taitel et al., 1980; Mishima and 

Ishii, 1984; Pauchon and Banerjee, 1986).  

 

C.4 THE SLUG FLOW REGIME 

For the slug flow region, it was selected the model of de Cachard 

and Delhaye (1996). This is a simple and yet comprehensive model, 

which captures some of the important aspects of the slug flow regime 

such as the opposite directions of wall shear in both slug and Taylor 

bubble regions.  

In this model, steady and fully developed slug flow is described 

as a succession of identical unit cells. A unit cell consists of a cylindrical 



227 

 

 

Taylor bubble surrounded by a falling liquid film and of a liquid slug, as 

illustrated in Figure C.1. 

 
Figure C. 1 – Unit cell of slug regime (Hafemann, 2015). 

  

A very complex feature of slug flow is the understanding and 

prediction of the mechanisms by which gas becomes entrained in the 

form of small bubbles in the liquid slug. A criterion for the existence of 

non-aerated slugs is written in terms of the Bond number as follows: 

 

   
(     )   

  
         C.5  

 

In most simulations reported here, values of Bond number are of 

the order of 1,300 and, therefore, gas entrainment within the slug cannot 

be disregarded. In the original paper of de Cachard and Delhaye (1996) 

gas entrainment in the slug was neglected since 140Bo ?  in their 
studies. In what follows, an extension of the de Cachard and Delhaye 

model taking into account slug entrainment is presented. 

The fraction of the unit cell transit time corresponding to the 

Taylor bubble is: 
 

  
  

     
     C.6  

 



228 

 

The integration of the instantaneous continuity equations for the 

gas, liquid and the mixture produces the following equations for the 

region of Taylor bubble and the liquid slug when relating to the mixture 

superficial velocity,     as follows 
 

          (    )       C.7  
 

          (    )        C.8  
 

The unit slug flow model is complemented with closure 

expressions for the Taylor bubble velocity,      , the falling film 

velocity,     , and the slug void fraction,   . The following 
approximations were made: (i) the flow in the liquid film is fully 

developed, (ii) the flow in the slug is fully developed and (iii) there is no 

slip between the gas and the liquid in the liquid slug, i.e.,          . 

For the Taylor bubble velocity, the Nicklin et al. (1962) 

expression is used: 

 

                 C.9  
 

The coefficient 1.2 in the above equation is the turbulent flow 

velocity profile coefficient in the liquid slug.    is the rise velocity of a 
Taylor bubble in quiescent liquid. De Cachard and Delhaye (1996), 

among others (Wallis, 1969), adopted the general correlation by White 

and Beardmore (1962): 

 

    ?       C.10  

 

where: 

 

       [     ( 
      

     
*] [     (

       

 
*]    C.11

defined as

and 

 

  ,

        

    
     ?          

       

    C.13  

 

The liquid film around the Taylor bubble is modelled as a thin 

film falling, without interfacial shear stress, inside a vertical cylinder. 

For laminar film flow, the film thickness,  , is related to the mean film 
velocity by the Nusselt relationship: 

 

 (
   

 

  
 )

  ?

 (    )
  ?     C.14  

 

where     is the falling film Reynolds number, given by 
 

         
   

  
  (      )   C.15  

 

For turbulent flow, according to Belkin et al. (1959) and Wallis 

(1969), a new relationship is proposed as follows 

 

 (
   

 

  
 )

  ?

         
  ?

    C.16  

 

The two relations fit together for        . Making use of the 
definition of the film Reynolds number and of the geometrical 

relationship between the film thickness and the Taylor bubble void 

fraction, the equation of the film thickness is rewritten as a function of 

the bubble void fraction 

 

  
 

 
(   

 

 
 ? *     C.17  

 

Hence, the falling film velocity can be calculated as  

 



230 

 

     

{

C.5 THE SLUG TO CHURN REGIME TRANSITION 

The slug to churn transition is calculated using the model of 

Jayanti and Hewitt (1992). This model postulates that the mechanism 

behind this transition is flooding in the Taylor bubble. They proposed 

the following modified form of the flooding correlation as the criterion 

for the occurrence of churn flow: 



232 

 

 

?    
      ?    

      C.30  

 

where     
  and     

  are the dimensionless superficial Taylor bubble and 

superficial falling liquid film velocities. These are given by

simultaneously

It is worthwhile mentioning that the superficial velocities,      
and      are related to the actual velocities      and      by the 

following expressions 

 

            C.35  
 

         (    ) 
C.36  

 
Jayanti and Hewitt (1992) suggested that the thickness of the 

liquid film surrounding the Taylor bubble should be calculated using the 

Brotz empirical relationship:

Hewitt (1992) to take into account the influence of the length of the 

falling film on the flooding velocity:

The length of the Taylor bubble,   , can be determined from a 
mass balance on the liquid phase:

transition                and       . 
 

C.6 THE CHURN FLOW REGIME 

The churn flow model utilized in the present study is that 

proposed by Jayanti and Brauner (1994). They put forward a model 

particularly devoted to the prediction of pressure gradient and void 

fraction in churn flow. In their model, force balances on the gas core and 

on the two-phase mixture are as follows 

 

 
  

  
 

   

 ? 
      C.40  

 

 
  

  
 

   

 ? 
  [  (   )     ]   C.41  

 



234 

 

In Eq. (C.41),    is the average wall shear stress (accounting for 
the fact that only the liquid is in contact with the wall). Jayanti and 

Brauner (1994) suggested that    may be calculated based on the net 
flow rate alone and that its time-varying nature can be neglected. Thus, 

 

   
 

 
    (

   
   

*
 

    C.42  

 

where the liquid friction factor    is estimated using single phase flow 
relationships as follows 

 

   ,
     ?             

        
    

            
     C.43  

 

In a similar manner, the average interfacial shear stress can be 

written as, 

 

   
 

 
    (

   

 
*
 

    C.44  

 

where    is the interfacial friction factor, which is estimated by an 
average of the correlations by Bharathan and Wallis (1983) (for the 

post-flooding regime in counter-current flow) and by Wallis (1969) (for 

annular flow). Thus, 

 

   
 

 
(                      )     C.45  

 

where,

For situations in that       , then the interfacial friction 
coefficient is rewritten according to the following equation  

 

                  [    (
  (   )

 
)

    

]   C.49  

 

Jayanti and Brauner (1994) compared the pressure gradient 

predictions using the above model with the experimental results by 

Owen (1986). They claimed that almost all data points (covering a liquid 

mass flux range of 5 to 400 kg m
-2

s
-1

 in a 0.0318 m ID pipe) are 

predicted well and lie within   20% of the measured pressure gradient. 
 

C.7 THE CHURN TO ANNULAR REGIME TRANSITION 

The large number of mechanisms behind the transition to annular 

flow leads to many formulations of criteria to describe this transition. 

The most commonly used is the flow reversal condition due to its easy 

experimental observation and because there are simple relationships to 

determine it (HEWITT and WALLIS, 1963; PUSHKINA and 

SOROKIN, 1969; TAITEL et al., 1980). 

The most commonly used is the Hewitt and Wallis (1963) 

correlation which uses the flooding correlation: 

 

?   
  ?   

      C.50  

 

with zero liquid down flow, i.e.,    
   . 

 

C.8 THE ANNULAR FLOW REGIME 

In the annular flow regime, the liquid phase is present as a film 

coating the inner wall of the pipe and also as droplets entrained in the 

gas core. Droplets are created at the crests of disturbance waves 



236 

 

travelling on the film and are subsequently deposited onto the liquid 

film by the action of the turbulence in the gas stream. 
The description of the annular flow model starts with mass and momentum 

balances over the gas core and liquid film regions respectively. A schematic of 

an incremental length of pipe in which annular flow takes place is shown in 

Figure A.1 – Nomenclature for the VIT thermal network. 

. 

 

 
 

Figure C.2 – Mass and momentum conservation balances applied to an 

incremental annular flow length (Barbosa and Hewitt, 2006). 

 

The following assumptions are made: 

? The flow is steady; 

? The flow is one-dimensional; 

? The film thickness is uniform around the perimeter of the 
pipe; 

? Mechanical equilibrium, i.e., the pressure is constant over an 
entire pipe cross-section; 

? The core flow is homogeneous, i.e., there is no slip between 
gas and entrained droplets 



237 

 

 

 

Mass conservation balances provide the following set of 

equations: 

 
 

  
    

 

 
(     ?    )   C.51  

 
 

  
    

 

 
(     ?    )   C.52  

 
 

  
   

 

 
( ?      ?    )   C.53  

 

where   and   are the deposition and the entrainment mass flow rates of 
droplets per unit perimeter area.  ?     and  ?     are the interfacial mass 
flow rates from or to the liquid film and droplets per unit perimeter area 

due to evaporation and condensation. In the present formulation, it is 

assumed that vaporization and condensation takes place only through 

the film interface (the droplet stream phase change is negligible). 

In order to reduce the number of mass balance equations to be 

integrated in the annular regime from 3 to 2, the droplet entrained 

fraction is defined as follows 

 

   
   

       
 

   
       

    C.54  

 

Thus, the equation for the entrained mass fraction gives 

 
 

  
    

 (   )

  
   C.55  

 

and then, using the overall balance 

 

 

  
    

 

  
    

 

  
      C.56  

 

it is possible to derive an equation for the entrained fraction as a 

function of distance: 

 



238 

 

 

  
   

 

(   )
[

 

  
(   )    

 

  
 ]   C.57  

 

Through the differential equation one can integrate the entrained 

fraction along the annular flow and then, calculate the void fraction and 

the pressure drop. In order to define the entrainment and deposition rates 

it has been used the method proposed by Govan e Hewitt (1988). The 

entrainment rate is given by 

 

 

 ,

            

           *
   (        ) 

     
 

+

     

           
   

C.58  

 

From the mass balance is defined the liquid film mass flux as 

 

      (    )     C.59  

 

and the critical liquid film mass flux,     , is defined as  
 

     
  
 

   [             (
  
  

* (
  
  

)

   

]   C.60  

 

The droplets deposition rate is expressed as 

 

        C.61  
 

where   is the concentration of droplets into the core 
 

  
   

  

  
 

   

  

    
C.62  

 

and    the droplet deposition transfer coefficient given by 
 



239 

 

 

   

{
 
 

 
      ?

  
   

     
 

  
    

     ?
  

   
(
  

 
)
    

     
 

  
    

    C.63  

 

At a given distance along the pipe, the entrained fraction is 

calculated from Eq. (C.57). The determination of boundary conditions 

for this equation depends on the situation in what the annular flow is 

created: if the annular flow regime is created artificially (e.g., in an 

adiabatic experimental apparatus) the entrained fraction at the onset of 

annular flow, or simply initial entrained fraction,    , is generally 
known and obviously dependent on the method by which the liquid flow 

is injected into the test section; if the annular regime is created naturally, 

i.e., those resulting from a flow transition from the churn flow regime 

due to an increase in quality, a calculation method is required to the 

determine the initial entrained fraction. Barbosa et al. (2002) proposed 

an empirical correlation to calculate     taking into account the effect of 
the proximity to the churn flow boundary and the presence of droplets 

generated through the process of droplet formation associated with that 

flow regime (Azzopardi, 1983). This is given by  

 

   ( )             ?
    
    

     C.64  

 

Thus, the momentum equation may be rewritten assuming the 

two-phase mixture with homogeneous droplet core. The resulting 

equation takes the form 

 

 
  

  
 

 

 
   [  (    )      ] 

   
 

  
*
  

 

    
 

(    )
 

  (    )
+     

C.65  

 

where    is the fraction of the pipe cross-sectional area occupied by the 
gas core and   is the average film thickness. These variables are related 
by 

 



240 

 

     
  

 
    C.66  

 

where    is the wall shear stress and    is the core equivalent mass 
fraction defined as 

 

   
      

 
   (    )       C.67  

 

where    is the fraction of the liquid flow entrained as droplets. The 
homogeneous core quality is expressed as follows 

 

 ?  
  

      
 

  
  (    )    

     C.68  

 

   is the homogeneous core density, which can be defined as: 
 

   *
 ? 
  

 
(   ? )

  
+

  

    C.69  

 

The homogeneous core and liquid film velocities are defined 

similarly, given by: 

 

   
   
    

    C.70  

 

    
 (    )

  (    )
    C.71  

 

The interfacial shear stress,   , was assumed to be given by a 
correlation due to Wallis (1969): 

 

   
 

 
(    )   

      C.72  

 
Based on the concentration of droplets into the core gas, i.e., the 

entrained fraction, and the homogeneous core velocity, defined as  

 



241 

 

 

    
  
  

 
   
  

    C.73  

 

Thus, Eq. C.72 is rewritten as 

 

   
 

 
    

     C.74  

 

where    is the modified Fanning friction factor given by 
 

      [

        C.76  

 

and 

 

     
(      ) 

 
 

    C.77  

 

A triangular relationship takes place among the liquid film flow 

rate, the film thickness and the wall shear stress. The liquid film 

thickness can be determined by matching the known value of the film 

flow rate at a certain distance with the integral of a hypothetical velocity 

profile across the film. 

Several hypothetical profiles have been suggested in the 

literature. It has been used the profile suggested by Jensen (1987) as the 

most accurate one, i.e., the Double Velocity Profile will be used. 

In dimensionless coordinates, the liquid film flow rate is defined 

as (note that the integral takes into account curvature effects): 

 

 ?

thickness in dimensionless form. These are given by:

The Universal Velocity Profile (UVP) used on the integration of 

the liquid film is defined according to Von Kármán as

The Double Velocity Profile (DVP) uses the UVP in the 

integration of the film flow rate expressed in Eq. (C.78) up to    
   ?   and an inverted reflection of the UVP for    ?       . In 
terms of the liquid film flow rate the DVP is given by

An expression for the wall shear stress is obtained from the 

elimination of the pressure gradient from separate force balances on the 

liquid film and on the homogeneous core (neglecting the accelerational 

pressure gradient)

Equations (C.74) to (C.85) provide a unique triangular 

relationship (Hewitt, 1961) between the liquid film flow rate, the liquid 

film thickness and the wall shear stress. This means that at any point 

within the channel, if two of the parameters are known, the third one can 

be calculated.

APPENDIX F 

The Beggs and Brill (1973) correlation, is one of the few 

published correlations capable of handling all flow directions. It was 

developed using 1" and 1 ½” sections of pipe that could be inclined at 

any angle from the horizontal. 

The Beggs and Brill multiphase correlation deals with both the 

friction pressure loss and the hydrostatic pressure difference. First the 

appropriate flow regime for the particular combination of gas and liquid 

rates (Segregated, Intermittent or Distributed) is determined. The liquid 

holdup, and hence, the in-situ density of the gas-liquid mixture is then 

calculated according to the appropriate flow regime, to obtain the 

hydrostatic pressure difference. A two-phase friction factor is calculated 

based on the "input" gas-liquid ratio and the Fanning friction factor. 

From this the friction pressure loss is calculated using "input" gas-liquid 

mixture properties. A more detailed discussion of each step is given in 

the following documentation. 

In order to characterize the hydrodynamics, the Froude 

dimensionless number,    , is used to indicate how well a particular 
model works in relation to a real system. The Froude number is defined 

as

APPENDIX G 

In this appendix several annular gap natural convection heat 

transfer correlations and formation thermal models which are employed 

in this thesis are described in detail. 

 

G.1 EVALUATION OF THE ANNULUS NATURAL 

CONVECTION MODEL 

Even though the thermal transport through the annulus has been 

modeled by taking into account the natural convection and the radiative 

heat transfer as presented by Hasan and Kabir (2002), there is a lack of 

information regarding the effect of different correlations on the overall 

heat exchange throughout the wellbore/formation radius. Therefore, 

assessing the annulus natural convection in an isolated manner may lead 

to a misreading of the role of the convection resistance in the wellbore, 

especially when a much larger thermal resistance exists in the wellbore 

configuration, as seen in VIT assisted wellbores. Hence, four different 

natural convection correlations for annular enclosures have been 

selected and assessed in this thesis. 

 

G.1.1 Hasan and Kabir (1991) 

A correlation was proposed based on an adaptation of the 

Dropkin and Sommerscales (1965) relationship for natural convection 

between two vertical parallel plates (5 x 10

&amp;lt;Ra &amp;lt;7.17 x 10

G.1.2 Hasan and Kabir (2002) 

According to Hasan and Kabir (2002), using the full value of    
given by Eq. (3.39) may lead to an underestimation of annuli fluid 

temperatures. Hence, these authors developed a new correlation to 

estimate   , based on the Fishenden and Saunders (1950) work, as 
follows

G.1.3 Zhou (2013) 

In his thesis, Zhou (2013) proposed a new approach based on 

previous correlations (Dropkin and Sommerscales (1965); Holman 

(1981); Fishenden and Saunders (1950)), to deal with the annulus gap 

heat transfer as follows

G.1.4 Xiong et al. (2015) 

Xiong et al. (2015) developed a new correlation for the Nusselt 

number based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation 

results. The approach took into account the convective transport in real-

size annuli between different sets of tubings and casings. The proposed 

correlation is given by

G.2 EVALUATION OF THE FORMATION MODEL 

Applying a radial energy balance on the formation leads to the 

following one-dimensional transient governing equation of energy 

conservation in cylindrical coordinates

where     and     are the formation temperature and thermal diffusivity, 

respectively. Given the appropriate boundary conditions, Eq. (G. 6) can 

be solved using Laplace Transforms or other analytical methods. When 

coupled with the heat transmission inside the wellbore, and considering 

a constant heat transfer rate from the wellbore to the formation, the 

temperature of the interface between the wellbore and the formation can 

be written as (Hasan and Kabir, 1991) 

  

    
               ( )  

          ( )
     G. 7 

 

where  ( ) is the transient dimensionless temperature. In this thesis 
several formation models are compared in order to estimate the  ( ) 
transient function. 

 

G.2.1 Ramey (1962) 

The first key work to provide a solution for     used the Carslaw 

and Jaeger solution (1959) for an infinitely long cylinder with a constant 

wall heat flux (Ramey, 1962). In this work, a transient dimensionless 

temperature for long times (more than 7 days) is defined as 

 

 ( )    ( ?  )           G. 8 

 

where    is the dimensionless time function, which represents the 
transient diffusion time as follows

G.2.2 Hasan &amp;amp; Kabir (1991) 

Using the principle of superposition, Hasan and Kabir (1991) 

provided an analytical solution for  ( ). The results were plotted and 
fitted to yield two new  ( ) functions depending on the production time

G.2.3 Chiu and Thakur (1991) 

Based on the exact solution of Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) for 

 ( ), Chiu and Thakur (1991) derived a new correlation expression 
valid for all times, 

 

 ( )         (        )  G.11 

 

G.2.4 Cheng et al. (2011) 

Cheng et al. (2011) developed a new correlation for  ( ) that 
takes into account the wellbore heat capacity,

where   is the ratio of the formation heat capacity and the wellbore heat 
capacity:

(   )  

  G.13 

 

where   is the density and    is the specific heat capacity. 
In this thesis, a hybrid approach has been proposed to estimate 

 ( ) while considering the existing models of Ramey, 1962; Hasan and 
Kabir, 1991 and Cheng et al. (2011), based on the   , as follows 

 

 ( )  

{
 
 
 

 
 
 
      ?   (     ?  )               

  ( ?  )        

 
 

   
[  (  

 

 
*    (   )        ]  

              

  ( ?  )                   

 G.14 

 

The reason for adopting this approach meets the observations 

made by Cheng et al. (2011) and Hasan and Kabir (1991). The former 

pointed out that, for very short transient (      ), the correlation 
based on the ratio between the formation and wellbore heat capacities 

should not be employed since there is no significant contribution of the 

formation to the wellbore thermal behavior. The latter stated that, for 

very short and for long transients, their approach presented an excellent 

agreement with the exact solution for the transient diffusion in the 

formation.
