LIST OF FIGURES 

FIGURE 1.1 | ITF domain in the globe (left) and water masses route flowing through different straits (right). 
Following the surface flow, North Pacific waters (blue) come into the system crossing the Makassar strait, 
transporting about 80% of all ITF volume. Intermediate waters, below the thermocline, carry South Pacific waters 
(red) into the archipelago’s circulation crossing the Lifamatola Passage. Waters flowing through Timor, Ombai 
and Lombok straits represent almost all the volume exported from the ITF system into the Indian Ocean. Values 
indicate the annual mean volume transport, in Sverdrups (1 Sv = 106 m3/s), across the main straits for the inflow 
and the outflow (adapted from Gordon and Fine, 1996). ..................................................................................... 14 

FIGURE 1.2 | Stratification in the Indonesian Seas: samples of waters from different positions labeled as “i, ii, 
iii, … , x”, are shown in the graph and are associated to their own local T-S diagram, representing the temperature 
in the vertical axis and salinity in the horizontal one. Colors are the depth in meters of each sample providing a 
T-S value at that position. (adapted from Sprintall et al., 2014). ........................................................................ 15 
FIGURE 1.3 | Schematic representation of the wind-driven circulation in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, 
pointing out subtropical gyres and the Agulhas Leakage. On the right, graphs show the zonal mean of the wind 
stress for two periods: from 1965 to 1974 (blue) and from 1995 to 2004 (red). It reveals the Westerlies 
intensification and the displacement of the latitude lines where these winds are maximum to the south, between 
45°S and 60°S. (adapted from Beal et al., 2011) ................................................................................................... 19 

FIGURE 1.4 | GMST evolution from 1950 to 2014, for three independent data sets and the CMIP-5 average-
result of 124 simulations from 41 different climate models. The big hiatus of the mid 20th century is showed to be 
finished by 1972, and the most recent hiatus should be considered from 2001, to avoid influences due to the 
1997/98 El Niño and the 1999/2000 La Niña events. The last volcanic eruptions of El Chichón (1982) and 
Pinatubo (1991) are highlighted to show their short-term influence on the surface temperature drop. (adapted 
from Fyfe et al., 2016) ........................................................................................................................................... 22 

FIGURE 2.1 | Schematic representation of the HYCOM’s hybrid coordinate system: for stratified regions of 
the ocean interior, the model is described by surfaces of constant density (isopycnals) as the vertical coordinate; 
in the surface mixed layer, the isopycnals automatically transform to Euclidean z-coordinates; in shallow regions 
over the continental shelf, the layers become terrain-following ?-coordinates; and come back to z-coordinates for 
very shallow areas. ................................................................................................................................................. 29

FIGURE 3.1 | Location of the ITF’s region on the globe (top) and Mean Sea Surface Height (SSH) on the ITF 
colored by SSH, using output data of Expt. 18.1 (see Section 2.1.1). The graphic shows the names of sections used 
to estimate the transports. Karimata, Makassar and Moluccas correspond to the inflow pathway; and Timor, 
Ombai, Flores and Lombok to the outflow one. .................................................................................................... 43 

FIGURE 3.2 | Horizontal Map of the flow in the mixed layer considering the average velocity field for the ten 
last years of the Climatological Run. Makassar Passage is shown as the major inflow passageway for superficial 
flows. In this layer, water coming from Pacific are transported within Flores Sea toward Banda Sea, exiting from 
Indonesian archipelago to Indian Ocean basin by travelling throughout Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor straits. 
A smaller intense flow can be observed entering the Indonesian seas by inflowing through Karimata strait. ..... 43 

FIGURE 3.3 | Horizontal Map of flow at 1000 m depth considering the average velocity field in the last ten 
years of the Climatological Run. The Lifamatola passage is the only pathway for the inflow of deep water from 
Pacific Ocean into the Indonesian seas. A southward deep flow is formed in Banda Sea and its trajectory follows 
is affected by topographic boundaries which exist in the sea due to presence of small islands. Lastly, these deep 
waters exit from the Indonesian archipelago toward the Indian Ocean by outflowing through Ombai strait and 
Timor passage. The graph also marks the 200 m (wider light blue line) and 1000 m (white) bathymetries. The 
grey area is shallower than 1000 m. ....................................................................................................................... 44 

FIGURE 3.4 | Vertical Structure of major inflow passageway of ITF: Makassar strait (left) and Lifamatola 
passage (right). Current speed across the strait (meridional component) are showed in the graphs on top and 
Salinity and Potential Temperature stratification on bottom. Blue color intensities indicate a southward flow, 
while red ones denote a northward flow. In Makassar there is a continuous flux with two cores (above and below 
the thermocline) and it is not deeper than 800 m. In Lifamatola, HYCOM is representing an alternating direct 
flux, where the deep flux presents a core ?1100 m depth. The stratification patterns show Lifamatola 
subthermocline waters slightly more saline than ones in Makassar. This suggests origins in North Pacific for waters 
within Makassar and South Pacific for Lifamatola deep flow. .............................................................................. 46 

FIGURE 3.5 | Vertical structure of Ombai strait (left) and Timor passage (right) showing the flow across the 
straits (top) and the stratification profile (bottom).  Blue intensities denote westward velocities and red ones 
means eastward velocities crossing the section. In both straits, the flow presents two cores, one above and other 
below thermocline, transporting waters which previously passed through Makassar and Lifamatola, respectively.
 ................................................................................................................................................................................ 48 
FIGURE 3.6 | Maps of the upper 700 m depth-integrated transport. Values are shown for each single grid 
point, where blue colors denote lower values of transport and red higher. Units are given in 10-9 Sv/m2 (in a 0.08° 
horizontal grid). Arrows represent the wind field. Name of the months are abbreviated in the bottom right corner 
of each map. The change in wind direction along the year is due to a monsoon pattern that drives winds in the 
ITF region. As it can be seen in the Figure, this drives seasonal variability of the ITF transports, and consequently 
in the amount of waters exchange from Pacific to the Indian Ocean. ................................................................... 51 

FIGURE 3.7 | Inflow (red) and outflow (black) volume transport in the upper 700 m depth for the 
Climatological Run. The envelopes represent standard errors based on the definition of each curve as being the 
sum of transports in individual straits. Negative values indicate transports southward or westward. Dashed lines 
are the mean annual value for inflow (red) and outflow (black).  Superficial ITF transports presents a high seasonal 
variability that is driven mostly by the monsoon winds pattern, in a reverse mode increase/decrease for 
inflow/outflow along the year. ............................................................................................................................... 52 



FIGURE 3.8 | The ITF’s outflow volume transport in the upper 700 m from 1970 to 2015. Individual time 
series is shown for transport across Lombok+Flores straits (top-left), Ombai (top-middle) and Timor (top-right), 
and for total transport (bottom). Plot data were smoothed every four months. Blue dashed lines indicate the mean 
transport in each region and the red lines is the linear fit. 3 periods: the base historical period (1970-1990); the 
“accelerated warming” (1991-2000) where, between 1991 and 1995 there was a systematic increase in the transport 
with trend ~1.4 Sv/year; and the “slowdown warming” (1991-2000) where ITF also presented an increasing 
transport of volume ................................................................................................................................................ 53

increasing trend of the ITF’s heat transport was observed at this period. ............................................................ 61 
FIGURE 3.14 | ITF’s heat transport anomaly from 2013 to 2015 (brown line) and Nino3.4 Index anomaly

ABSTRACT 

The global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) plays a significant role in the Earth’s climate system by 
redistributing all over the world the excess heat gained by Earth in low latitudes. In its superficial branch, warm 
waters are exchanged throughout the world’s ocean basins. The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) and the Agulhas 
Leakage (AL) are the main processes responsible, respectively, for importing Pacific Ocean waters into the Indian 
Ocean, and for exporting Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, changes in both systems have 
been reported and can be related to global warming consequences, processes of air-sea interactions and variabilities 
in the ocean circulation and wind patterns. In the present work, output of a high-resolution, global implementation 
of HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model) from different runs were used, aiming at a study of the structure 
and variability of the ITF, and to evaluate the use of a numerical tool for tracking virtual Lagrangian particles to 
correlate circulation patterns of the ITF and the AL. For the ITF, analysis of the models’ output provided a mean 
volume transport in the upper 700 m depth of about 13 Sv, what is in the range of values reported by observations 
and other numerical simulations in the region. The seasonal variability was found to be related to the monsoons 
wind regimes, and the ITF’s response to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was evaluated. During five La 
Niña events, the mean volume transport was of approximately 16 Sv, and for also five El Niño events, of 
approximately 12 Sv. Results show an abrupt increase in the heat transport between 2002 and 2012, what could 
be related to changes in the heat content within the Indian Ocean for the same period. Heat transport anomalies 
were analyzed in the last years of the time series and present a clear correlation with Nino3.4 index, denoting a 
strong response of the ITF to the 2014/16 El Niño. Numerical test-experiments simulating Lagrangian particles 
have been performed, to identify and quantify water masses’ origins compounding the ITF and to correlate 
variabilities signals of ITF in the Indian Ocean’s basin circulation and in the Agulhas Leakage.

RESUMO 

A Circulação de Revolvimento Meridional do oceano desempenha um papel importante no sistema climático da 
Terra, através da redistribuição do excesso de calor ganho pelo planeta em baixas latitudes. No seu ramo 
superficial, massas de águas quentes são carregadas entre as diferentes bacias oceânicas no mundo. O fluxo que 
ocorre através dos estreitos dos mares da Indonésia (ITF, Indonesian Throughflow), e o Vazamento das Agulhas 
(VA) são dois importantes processos responsáveis, respectivamente, por importar águas do Pacífico para o Oceano 
Índico, e por exportar águas do Índico para o Oceano Atlântico. Recentemente, mudanças em ambos sistemas 
têm sido reportados e podem estar relacionados a consequências do aquecimento global, a processos de interação 
ar-mar e a variabilidades da circulação oceânica e de padrões de vento. No presente trabalho foram usadas saídas 
de diferentes rodadas usando uma implementação global em alta resolução do HYCOM (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean 
Model), com o objetivo de estudar a estrutura e variabilidade do ITF e avaliar o uso de uma ferramenta numérica 
para rastrear virtualmente a trajetória de partículas Lagrangianas e correlacionar padrões de circulação do ITF e 
do VA. Para o ITF, análises dos resultados dos modelos forneceram um valor de transporte de volume de ?13 Sv 
para os primeiros 700 m de profundidade, o qual está em acordo com valores obtidos por observações e outras 
simulações numéricas. A variabilidade sazonal foi demonstrada estar relacionada aos regimes de vento de monções, 
e a resposta do ITF para o El Niño-Oscilação Sul (ENOS) foi avaliada. Durante cinco eventos de La Niña o 
transporte de volume médio foi de ?16 Sv, e para cinco eventos de El Niño, em ?12 Sv. Os resultados mostram 
um aumento abrupto no transporte de calor entre 2002 e 2012, o qual pode estar relacionado a mudanças na 
quantidade de calor dentro do Oceano Índico para o mesmo período. Anomalias no transporte de calor foram 
analisadas para os últimos anos da mesma série temporal e também apresentou clara correlação com o índice 
Nino3.4, configurando uma forte resposta do ITF para o El Niño de 2014/16. Experimentos numéricos simulando 
partículas Lagrangianas foram implementados, com o objetivo de identificar origens de massas de águas que 
compõem o ITF e correlacionar sinais de variabilidade do ITF na bacia de circulação do Índico e do Vazamento 
das Agulhas.

1 | INTRODUCTION 

1.1 THE INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW 

The flux of waters at tropical latitudes from the Pacific Ocean (PO) toward the 

Indian Ocean (IO) basin, traveling through different straits and seas around the 

Indonesian islands, corresponds to the so called Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), which is 

also part of the superficial branch of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and, 

as such, integrant part of the global climate system (Sprintall et al., 2014). The ITF is 

the only pathway connecting large ocean basins in low latitudes, permitting the exchange 

of warm and fresh waters that could carry different climate signals and anomalies 

(Godfrey, 1996; Hirst &amp;amp; Godfrey, 1993; Schneider, 1998; Wajsowicz &amp;amp; Schneider, 2001).  

To describe the ITF pathway, in a general way, one can say that surface waters 

coming from the North Pacific enter the Indonesian seas by flowing through Makassar 

strait (see Fig. 1.1), whose pathway corresponds to approximately 80% of total inflow 

transport. Because of the 680 m deep sill, only upper thermocline waters may flow into 

the Flores Sea. There, to the south of Makassar, the flux bifurcates. The western branch 

exits directly towards the Indian Ocean, passing through Lombok strait. The other 

retroflects eastward to the Banda Sea, and then exits the ITF system by flowing through 

the Ombai strait or the Timor passage. Deeper waters, from the South Pacific (denser 

than North Pacific ones), come in the system travelling through Lifamatola passage (Fig. 

1.1), with 1940 m depth sill. The flux follows toward Banda sea, where these water masses 

are modified by different processes, and eventually goes out also flowing through both 

sides of Timor island (Gordon, 1995; Gordon and Fine, 1996; Gordon et al, 1999; Gordon, 

2005; Mayer et al., 2010; Tillinger and Gordon, 2010; Sprintall et al., 2009).

FIGURE 1.1 | ITF domain in the globe (left) and water masses route flowing through different straits (right). 
Following the surface flow, North Pacific waters (blue) come into the system crossing the Makassar strait, 
transporting about 80% of all ITF volume. Intermediate waters, below the thermocline, carry South Pacific waters 
(red) into the archipelago’s circulation crossing the Lifamatola Passage. Waters flowing through Timor, Ombai 
and Lombok straits represent almost all the volume exported from the ITF system into the Indian Ocean. Values 
indicate the annual mean volume transport, in Sverdrups (1 Sv = 106 m3/s), across the main straits for the inflow 
and the outflow (adapted from Gordon and Fine, 1996). 

Previous works (Gordon et al., 1999; Susanto and Gordon, 2005; van Aken et 

al., 1988) estimated a total ITF volume transport of approximately 10 Sv. However, 

recently, the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) program 

has made direct measurements (Sprintall et al., 2004; see also:  www.marine.csiro.au/ 

~cow074/index.htm) of the ITF in all major inflow and outflow passages, providing 

observational data for more accurate estimates of transports along the flow. The analysis

of data between 2004 and 2006 (Sprintall et al., 2009; Gordon et al., 2010) suggests a 

total transport considerably larger: average transport through Makassar of ?12 Sv; 
Lifamatola ?2.5 Sv; Lombok ?2.6 Sv; Ombai ?4.9 Sv and Timor: ?7.5 Sv. A mean 
total inflow transport was estimated in ?12.7 Sv and outflow ?15 Sv.  

Not just being a very intricate ocean flow, and besides promoting an exchange 

pathway, ITF also plays a key role in the ocean circulation, modifying the original 

Pacific’s waters characteristics within the Indonesian seas before depositing them into 

the Indian Ocean, creating a very particular stratification profile in that region. As shown 

in Fig. 1.2, waters poured into the Indian Ocean from ITF (locations “ix” and “x”) reveal 

vertical profiles of salinity and temperature quite different of those ones flowing into the 

archipelago seas from the Pacific Ocean (locations “i”, “iv”, and “v”, for example).	 With 
a shallow topography, most of the colder Pacific waters that manage to flow through

INTRODUCTION 16 
 

the Lifamatala passage (location “iii”, “iv” and “vii”) are vertically advected in an 

upwelling flow in the Banda Sea (location “viii”), cooling the waters coming from the 

Java Sea – in the east, (location “vi”). This last one, is also fresher and cooler than the 

ones placed at its inflow pathway in Makassar strait (position “ii”) because, as revealed 

by the profile of position “ix”, this waters flowing out of the ITF, crossing the Lombok 

strait, have been also modified in Java Sea (position “vi”). 

Once incorporated in the Indian Ocean, the waters transported by ITF can be 

now advected toward the African continent, flowing westward with the South Equatorial 

Current and eventually exit out the Indian Ocean basin, carried mostly by the Agulhas 

Current, and leaks into the South Atlantic (SA) Ocean (Le Bars et al., 2013). 

Thus, the states of the Indian and Atlantic oceans are directly affected by the 

heat and volume transported by ITF (Lee et al., 2002), modulating the regional climate 

while regional patterns of precipitation and air-sea interaction vary (Wajsowicz, 2002).   

The ITF is also reported as being strongly influenced by climate conditions and 

presents itself high seasonal and interannual variabilities (Murtugudde et al., 1998; 

Schiller et al, 2010), part related to air-sea interaction,  for instance, to the typical 

monsoonal winds of the region, and also due to ocean circulation variability, as revealed 

by notable responses of ITF to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), to the Pacific 

Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) (England &amp;amp; Huang, 

2005; Gordon et al., 2010; van Sebille et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2013; Wunsch, 2010; 

Zhou et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018). 

The imbalance ~2 Sv was reported by these authors, and it is compatible with 
the uncertainty of the data and the standard deviation. There are also some issues 

concerning the INSTANT mooring array, leading to poor extrapolations for side-walls 

and incomplete measurements in inflow passages. At Lifamatola passage, there is a 

reversing direction of the flux (to north in surface, and to south below 1250 m). Also, 



INTRODUCTION 17 
 

the Karimata strait1 (50 m sill), is not considered in the moorings, and it is known that 

flows crossing it allows introducing South China Sea water into the Java Sea (Susanto 

et al., 2013). 

1.2 THE AGULHAS LEAKAGE 

The Pacific waters, processed and modified by ITF, once merged into the Indian 

Ocean, can now be carried away by the South Equatorial Current to the west side of the 

IO basin to be incorporated into the IO subtropical gyre. Flowing southward within the 

Agulhas Current (AC), eventually, these fully modified waters, that now hold the local 

IO properties, can leak into the South Atlantic, through a strongly non-linear flow, 

bounded by the South Africa’s coastline, known as the Agulhas Leakage (AL). The whole 

pathway, from the tropical Pacific to the South Atlantic Ocean, constitutes part of the 

global MOC “warm route”, that is fundamental in modulating the state of the Earth’s 

Climate System (ECS). Studies with climate models showed, for example, changes in the 

MOC can be correlated, in genesis and intensity, to precipitation patterns and decadal 

variabilities of extreme atmospheric events (Hu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2017). 

The AC is the western boundary current that, similarly to the Brazil Current, 

flows along the western portion of the wind driven subtropical gyre in the Indian Ocean 

(Lutjeharms, 2006). As in the South Atlantic, the subtropical gyre is bounded to the 

south by the Subtropical Front, associated to the zone of zero wind stress curl, located 

at approximately 45°S, and corresponds to the region where the Westerlies are maximum. 

Differently from South America, though, the African continent is delimited to 

the north of this latitude. In the absence of any forcing, the AC would tend to flow into 

the Atlantic, advected to the west by planetary waves, forming a “super gyre” that would

maps showed in this chapter, which have been extracted or adapted from their original 
referenced sources. Please, see Figs. 3.1 and 3.3, in Chapter 3, to visualize the ITF straits 
considered in this work.

connect both basins (de Ruijter, 1982; de Ruijter et al., 1999). However, forced inertially 

southward, the current accumulates anticyclonic relative vorticity due to changes in the 

local planetary vorticity (“" effect”), and once the current approaches the latitude where 
the African continent’s margin ends, the bathymetry change enhances this effect, 

eventually making the movement to deflect to the east, flowing back into the Indian 

Ocean. This process has been referred as the Agulhas Current retroflection (Lutjeharms, 

2006; Beal et al., 2011).  

But the retroflection is not a stationary phenomenon. The inertial state of the 

AC and the location of the line of zero wind stress curl depend on the general distribution 

of the wind over the Indian Ocean. Mesoscale (baroclinic and/or barotropic) instabilities 

transfer energy from the main flow, producing the increase of the retroflection loop 

predominantly to the west, before the current could flow back toward the IO basin. 

Eventually, the loop can close and release itself from the current, forming the Agulhas 

rings: anticyclonic eddies propagating westward and transporting with them a relevant 

volume of IO waters into the SA Ocean (Speich et al., 2006; Zarkhov &amp;amp; Nof, 2008). 

In addition to the current’s inertia and instability processes, the latitude of zero 

wind stress curl, together with the bottom topography and the coastline geometry also 

influence the rings’ generation, playing an important role in controlling the retroflection. 

For instance, supposing this latitude line was too close to the African continent border, 

the AC would be simply deflected to the east along this latitude, resulting in a reduced 

or even in an absence of the IO waters leaking into the Atlantic. Paleoclimate indicators 

suggest this “inertial shock” situation already happened in the past and could be 

associated with climate changes (Peeters et al., 2004).  

On the other hand, simulations with wind driven ocean models show that 

changes in the atmosphere circulation, in response to global warming, have been 

produced an increase in the AL and, also, a possible weaker MOC (Biastoch et al., 2008). 

Fig. 1.3 illustrates the process. It shows the pathway connecting different basins: the

FIGURE 1.3 | Schematic representation of the wind-driven circulation in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean, 
pointing out subtropical gyres and the Agulhas Leakage. On the right, graphs show the zonal mean of the wind 
stress for two periods: from 1965 to 1974 (blue) and from 1995 to 2004 (red). It reveals the Westerlies 
intensification and the displacement of the latitude lines where these winds are maximum to the south, between 
45°S and 60°S. (adapted from Beal et al., 2011) 

Indian Ocean, fed with Pacific Ocean waters coming from ITF and the Tasman leakage 

(south of Australia), is connected to the South Atlantic Ocean through the Agulhas 

System. In the west side of the Atlantic basin, part of the flow is incorporated to the 

subtropical gyre, and the other flows northward to form the Atlantic Meridional  
 

Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The line defined by the latitudes in which the 

Westerlies are maximum delimits both SA and IO subtropical gyres (black curves), the 

Subtropical Front (grey wide line) and a “super gyre” (dashed grey line): an inter-basin 

circulation pattern, exchanging waters from the South Atlantic to the Pacific, that 

eventually flows back into the Indian Ocean. The graph on the right shows the meridional 

profile for the westerly wind stress during two different periods. The blue and red arrows 

highlight the latitudes for the maximum shear stress and suggests it can be changing 

over recent years, as that position was pushed to the south and the values of wind stress 

are higher for the last period (1995-2004) if compared to the first one (1964-1974). 

This phenomenon is known as the southward expansion of the Southern 

Hemisphere mid-latitude westerly wind (Biastoch et al., 2009), and has been associated 

to the anthropogenic global climate change (Biastoch &amp;amp; Böning, 2013). Its direct

consequence would be the southward shift of the Subtropical Front, represented by the 

wider dashed red arrows in the graphs of Fig. 1.3. This could cause an increase in the 

leakage of waters from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, because the Subtropical Front 

delimits the retroflection and the rings’ formation. Thus, once it is shifting southward, a 

longer distance between the south border of Africa and that delimiter line could make 

the loops of the retroflection and the rings of the leakage become also larger, resulting in 

an increased inter-basin volume transport (Beal et al., 2011).  

Although it is still not a consensus, a possible consequence for the Atlantic would 

be related to the fact that the IO waters are hotter and more saline than the SA ones. 

An increased AL could propagate this anomaly northward in the Atlantic, interfering 

with the North Atlantic Deep Water formation that could lead to a weaker MOC 

(Biastoch et al., 2008; Delworth &amp;amp; Zeng, 2008). In addition, numerical experiments 

using low resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere models show anomalies in the region of 

the AC retroflection propagate far away the atmosphere, inside the thermocline, and 

resurge to surface in equatorial regions (e.g.: Haarsma et al., 2009), where these 

anomalies would be able to change properties of the ocean mixed layer, acting on the air-

sea interaction processes. 

1.3 THE GLOBAL WARMING HIATUS 

Such as the Agulhas Leakage, apart from simple correlations with the ECS 

variability modes, the ITF – as the main pathway to connect the great Indo-Pacific 

System – has a fundamental hole on the heat distribution all over the globe, transporting 

significant energy and transferring anomalies from the tropical upper ocean into the 

global conveyor belt (Tillinger &amp;amp; Gordon, 2010). 

Lee et al. (2015), for example, simulated the abrupt increase of the Indian Ocean 

heat content in the upper 700 m, as observed in past years, and could establish its origin 

in heat budget anomalies of the Pacific Ocean, which was tagged to be abruptly cooling

for the same period. The heat sent to the Indian Ocean, must have traveled from a basin 

to the other by flowing westward through the Indonesian islands. In addition, authors 

pointed out this dynamic could be causally related to the so-called global warming hiatus, 

that hereafter will be referred as the hiatus. 

The hiatus was a phenomenon marked by the slowdown of the Earth surface 

warming observed over the first decade of the 21st century, when the increase rate of the 

Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) was less intense than observed in earlier 

decades, and up to 4 times smaller than the one that had been represented by most 

climate models for that period. This ended to misguide popular and some scientific-like 

beliefs about an apparent “pause” in the global human-induced warmth (Easterling &amp;amp; 

Wehner, 2009). However, empiric observations of the ECS, such as measurements of the 

top of atmosphere, heat budgets, snow and ice covers, sea level, among others, aligned 

with record levels of carbon emissions, used to keep pointing out a warming planet (Fyfe 

et al., 2013; Trenberth &amp;amp; Fasullo, 2013; Xie et al, 2016; Seneviratne et al., 2014). 

In fact, “hiatuses” are climate change natural fluctuations that happen due to 

nonlinear behaviors of the ECS and have been observed for long- and near-term scales 

of climate estimation in the past (Lovejoy, 2014; Lewandowsky et al., 2015). The most 

recent one, would have begun just after the 1997/98 El Niño event, classified as “very 

strong” and once referred as “the climate event of the 20th century” (Changnon &amp;amp; Bell, 

2000; Slingo &amp;amp; Annamalai, 2000), and no longer observed as the effects of the successive 

La Niña events spanning 2010/2012 have been completely gone. 

Although the causes and abrupt origins of the recent hiatus are not completely 

clarified, they have been associated to distinct natural factors, to name a few: internal 

climate variabilities (Watanabe et al., 2014; Trenberth, 2015; Dai et al., 2015), water 

vapor (Solomon et al., 2010), volcanic activity (Haywood, et al., 2014; Maher et al., 

2014; Ridley et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2014), reduction in the solar radiation forcing 

(Folland et al., 2018), and even biases associated to the data utilized in warming 



INTRODUCTION 22 
 

estimates (Karl, 2015). It has been claimed, for example, the fast warming of the Arctic 

could have been underestimated (Cowtan &amp;amp;. Way, 2014), what would cause the hiatus 

to be statistically insignificant (Huang et al., 2017).  

However, Fyfe et al. (2016) suggested that, to make sense of the early-2000’s 

surface warming slowdown, a different historical base-period comprising the 2000/2001 

La Niña event should be employed to compare increase rates of the GMST rather than 

the usual 1971–1998 one, what would clearly reveal different scenarios for the first decade 

of the 21st century and the last years of the 20th century.  

Fig. 1.4 illustrates this overview. The big hiatus that happened between 1945 

and 1970 is likely related to aerosols effect, that reduced the solar insolation. The Clear 

Air acts of the 1970’s ended that era. Two recent volcanic activities (natural aerosols) in 

Mexico (El Chichón) and Philippines (Pinatubo) are highlighted in the graph and would 

have impacted globally the climate on the Earth, dropping the GMST over short-term 

periods, that lasted less than 3 year. The mid-period (1971 to 2000) shows a robust 

constant warming, perturbed by the volcanic activities. The final period represents the 

recent hiatus, taken after the strong ENSO events that were observed from 1997 to 2000,

result of 124 simulations from 41 different climate models. The big hiatus of the mid 20th century is 
showed to be finished by 1972, and the most recent hiatus should be considered from 2001, to avoid 
influences due to the 1997/98 El Niño and the 1999/2000 La Niña events. The last volcanic eruptions 
of El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) are highlighted to show their short-term influence on the 
surface temperature drop. (adapted from Fyfe et al., 2016)

INTRODUCTION 23 
 

and where the climate models’ forecasts, represented by the CMIP-5 average (dark black 

curve), differed from the observed GMST, represented in the data sets, and reveals the 

slowdown in the GMST increase between 2001 and 2012. 

The existence of a hiatus in recent years propitiated an encouraging environment 

of scientific discussion, noticed in the substantial number of reports, that eventually 

communicated with the wider public as a hot topic and an opportunity to provide a 

better understanding of the ECS and climate change (Hawkins et al., 2014).  

Studies were made to elucidate possible general origins of that phenomenon 

(Allan, 2017; Hedemann et al., 2017) and the contemporaneous climate events that could 

have contributed to it (England et al., 2014; Yan et al. 2016; Hu &amp;amp; Fedorov, 2017). In 

most cases, however, the Ocean has been the particular component of the ECS to be 

explored as a fundamental key to analyze the surface warming slowdown for longer than 

a decade in a human-induced warming planet, as part of a natural variability along the 

warmth process that did not cease (Katsman &amp;amp; van Oldenborgh, 2011; Loeb et al., 2012; 

Meehl et al., 2011; Kosaka &amp;amp; Xie, 2013; Aschmann et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015; Liu 

et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). 

Part of the oceanic contribution for the slowdown is, therefore, likely to be 

related with the thermal capacity of sea water, that makes the ocean a “natural sink” 

for the atmosphere, acting on the inter-basin heat uptake that plays a fundamental hole 

on the global vertical distribution of heat (Drijfhout et al., 2014), associated to internal 

dynamics of the ocean circulation that presents themselves decadal and multidecadal 

variabilities.  

Despite the fact most of the referenced studies do not agree with which ocean 

basin or variability mode can be associated to the surface warming slowdown, it seems 

like each great basin holds its own time scale of contribution. Although not conclusive, 

the Atlantic Ocean is thought to drive longer scales, being tide to multidecadal 

variabilities of the ECS internal variability, mostly correlated to the AMOC and to the 



INTRODUCTION 24 
 

Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) – whose period vary between 60 to 80 years. 

The Pacific Ocean is more likely to contribute to interannual variability especially due 

to ENSO, but also to multidecadal variability, linked with PDO in two distinct signals, 

one almost bidecadal – period varying 16 to 20 years – and other multidecadal that is 

somehow connected to AMO (Steinman et al., 2015). 

For all the cases, AMO, ENSO and PDO present themselves chaotic phases, 

making it difficult to establish a linear causal relation with them and the hiatus. The 

Indian Ocean also presents an interannual variability, but it is still not clear if the IOD 

is a global mode of variability, although it interacts strongly with ENSO. 

1.4 MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW 

The present work is motivated based on the following evaluations:  

• the Atlantic Ocean is the basin that has absorbed the biggest amount of 

heat since 1970, with a rate of ~2 × 1022 J per decade, what is almost the 
rate of the Pacific (~1.5 × 1022  J per decade) and the Indian Ocean 
(~0.5 × 1022 J per decade) combined, and it would be likely related to an 
enhanced Agulhas Leakage over the last years (Lee et al., 2011). During 

the recent warming slowdown, however, the deep (700 – 1500 m) heat 

uptake was observed, and it would be rather related with the 

anthropogenic warming than to the hiatus (Liu et al., 2015); 

• Shallow La Niña-like conditions in the Pacific Ocean during the hiatus 

are associated with increasing Ocean Heat Content (OHC) in subsurface 

in the Indian Ocean (Lee et al., 2015); 

• The Western Indian Ocean has been warmed for more than a century, 

and the Indian Ocean is becoming more active, making its strong 

connection with the Pacific Ocean to be gradually weaker in the last years 

(Roxy et al., 2014). 



INTRODUCTION 25 
 

That makes the Indonesian Throughflow – that connects the tropical Pacific 

Ocean to the Indian Ocean –, and the Agulhas Leakage – that connects the Indo-Pacific 

to the Atlantic – constitute main oceanic systems to explore correlations of the recent 

slowdown of the GMST warming with the upper ocean circulation. 

1.5 HYPOTHESES  

i) Changes in the upper Indian Ocean’s heat content during the surface 

warming slowdown hold correlations with ITF trends. 

ii) The enhanced leakage of waters from the Indian Ocean to the South 

Atlantic Ocean, which is increasing in response to global warming, can cause 

the SA Ocean circulation to be directly affected by variabilities and changes 

of ITF and in the Agulhas system. 

1.6 OBJECTIVES 

The main objectives of the present work are: 
1) to investigate the structure and variability of the Indonesian Throughflow 

as represented in output data of a global implementation of an eddy-
resolving model of the ocean circulation, considering the global warming 
scenario and its recent slowdown; 

2) to implement a fully operational Lagrangian Analysis that can establish the 
study of direct connections of the South Atlantic Ocean with the Agulhas 
Leakage and the Indonesian Throughflow, using open-source algorithms of 
virtual particles’ tracking, in a comparison set of numerical experiments 
employing output data of the high-resolution ocean circulation model. 

Some specific objectives can be pointed out: 
o analyze results of a global implementation of the ocean circulation model 

considering climatological and interannual forcings; 

o evaluate general aspects related to circulation pattern, temperature and 
salinity profiles of ITF; 



INTRODUCTION 26 
 

o Study ITF variability in the intraseasonal, interannual, decadal and 
multidecadal timescales; 

o Evaluate volume and heat transports related to ITF and their variabilities; 

o Identify and explore possible long-term trends in the time series obtained; 

o Design and implement numerical experiments using virtual particle tracking 
that permits interocean exchange Lagrangian analysis; 

 

The remaining of this document is structured in the following way. In Chapter 

2 it is presented a brief description of HYCOM, general aspects of the numerical 

experiments conducted and an overview of the Lagrangian models. The results of the 

experiments with HYCOM are described in Chapter 3, together with a comparison with 

available observational data.  In Chapter 4 the status of the effort to develop the 

Lagrangian tool is presented and discussed, with indications of the additional work 

needed to reach a fully reliable and operational system. Finally, in Chapter 5, a summary 

with main results and conclusions are presented, ending with suggestions for future work 

and recent scientific production overview.

2.1 THE OCEAN CIRCULATION MODEL 

HYCOM is an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) designed with 

different vertical coordinate schemes to better represent the ocean circulation according 

to local characteristics (Bleck &amp;amp; Benjamin, 1993; Bleck, 2002). In its “hybrid” approach, 

the vertical coordinates remain isopycnic in the stratified regions of the open ocean, below 

the surface mixed-layer and far from the boundaries. In the weakly stratified upper-ocean 

mixed-layer, the isopycnic vertical coordinates smoothly transition to z-coordinates and 

in shallow water regions the coordinates are dynamically converted to terrain-following 

sigma coordinates. In very shallow waters, along the coastal regions, the coordinates are 

turned back to z-levels (Fig. 2.1). 

The Laboratory for Modeling and Observations of the Ocean (LABMON) of the 

Oceanographic Institute of the University of Sao Paulo (IOUSP), in collaboration with 

the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC), utilized a setup of 

version 2.1 of HYCOM, hereafter referred as GLBa0.08, to perform two numerical 

simulations on the global ocean circulation: Expt. 18.1 – the Climatological Run –, and 

Expt. 18.3 – the Interannual Forcing Run. 

For the GLBa0.08 setup, the spatial domain used by HYCOM is discretized. 

The horizonal coordinates are represented in terms of elements (&amp;amp;'(, )'() sorted in a 
PanAm mesh: a hybrid projection combining Mercator for latitudes between 79°S and 

47°N and bipolar to the north of 47°N, resulting in a tripole global grid (Murray, 1996), 

where &amp;amp; is the longitude and ) the latitude, + ? [1, 4500] and - ? [1, 3298] are the indices 
associated to the horizontal grid nodes in eastward and northward directions, 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 28 
 

respectively. Thus, the spacing between two consecutive grid points in the zonal direction 

is:    ?&amp;amp;(() = |&amp;amp;' ? &amp;amp;'? 1|(() = 1 12°? = 0.08° (1) 
and in the meridional direction:   ?)(') = ?)( ? )(? 1?(') = 1 12°? ? cos )'( (2) 
The result is a horizontal spacing (see Appendix A) given by:  ?4(() ? 56(') ? 78 1 12°?180° 9 cos )'( (3) 
where 78  is the mean radius of the Earth, resulting in 54 ~ 6.5 km for mid-latitudes 
and 54 ~ 3.5 km in the Arctic. 

Finally, the components of the vector fields are staggered on an Arakawa C-grid 

(Arakawa, 1972; Arakawa &amp;amp; Lamb, 1977) to be evaluated on time. 

Although the model’s equations are described by the hybrid system of vertical 

coordinates (Arakawa &amp;amp; Suarez, 1983; Bleck &amp;amp; Benjamin, 1993; Bleck, 2002), the 

vertical structure of the spatial domain is represented by 32 layers of constant :2 = :2(:2 &amp;lt;)  surfaces, where: 
 

:2 &amp;lt;=  {28.1, 28.9, 29.7, 30.5, 30.95, 31.5, 32.05, 32.6, 33.15,

The ocean bathymetry was based on the 1-minute resolution version of the Smith 

&amp;amp; Sandwell (1997) bottom topography. The final setup provides a global horizontal and 

vertical resolution suitable for resolving eddies and an adequate representation of 

mesoscale processes.

Euclidean z-coordinates; in shallow regions over the continental shelf, the layers become terrain-
following ?-coordinates; and come back to z-coordinates for very shallow areas.

Among the Eulerian fields (see Appendix B) represented in the experiments’ 

outputs, the present work used the: eastward, northward and downward components of 

velocity; sea surface height, potential temperature, density and salinity. Each one of 

these fields are evaluated in the grid points as:  B(+, -, A) = B',(,@ (6) 
where B represents any of the Eulerian fields given by the model and +, -, A are the indices 
of the spatial grid. 

In addition, to these experiments, output of other one performed by the U.S 

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), using a similar configuration of the same model 

(GLBa0.08), and labeled as Expt. 19.1, was considered for comparison and validation, 

and it is detailed in Section 2.1.3. 

2.1.1 Expt. 18.1 – Climatological Run 

Data products of the Reanalysis 1 by National Center for Environmental 

Prediction (NCEP) National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (Kalnay et al., 

1996) were used to force the model with atmospheric fields containing wind velocity and 

shear stress, heat and radiation fluxes, and precipitation data.  In this experiment (18.1), 

monthly averaged data of the climatological year (mean state obtained by averaging the 

whole time series) were used to force the model for 27 years. The ocean’s initial state 

was an arbitrary realization of a global run available at the HYCOM Consortium (see: 

www.hycom.org). 

That is to say, the model was started from a “warm” initial condition. Output 

of the runs were written every six days, considering the mean values of all output 

variables along the previous six days. Because, despite the “warm” initialization, the 

model would take a time to stabilize, the first 10 years of the time series were considered 

as transient and were not used in the analyses performed in the present work. Fig. 2.3 

illustrates the surface circulation in one arbitrary day of the 27th year of the simulation.

18.1 Experiment. Warmer colors represent higher speeds 

 

The motivation for running this experiment was to evaluate how much the long-

term variability in the model when forced with interannual variability was due to the 

forcing variability or to any model’s intrinsic internal variability. 

2.1.2 Expt. 18.3 – Forced with Interannual variability   

For this experiment, also NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis-1 data product was used. 

The monthly averaged data containing the inherent interannual variability are used to 

force the model from 1949 to 2015. The model’s state in the end of the 20th year of the 

Climatological Run was used as initial condition for this experiment. As in the previous 

run, the mean outputs were saved each six days. The time series here analyzed comprises 

the period from 1970 to 2015.

2.1.3 Expt. 19.1 (by NRL) 

HYCOM is an OGCM used worldwide by different research groups and 

performed in many experiments using different configurations. The Consortium for Data 

Assimilative Modeling has performed some experiments with HYCOM involving the use 

of data assimilation, which adjusts the model with real empiric data provided by a certain 

reanalysis. Because the HYCOM runs performed by LABMON have no data assimilation, 

some tests were done using results of HYCOM with data assimilation by NRL.

NUMERICAL TOOLS 33 
 

 

At www.hycom.org is possible to find a description of a few experiments achieved 

using HYCOM and the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) system 

(Cummings, 2005, Cummings &amp;amp; Smedstad, 2013). NCODA considers the model forecast 

in a three-dimensional variational scheme and assimilates available satellite, and in situ 

data of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles 

from XBTs, ARGO floats and moored buoys, and satellite altimeter observations. 

Expt. 19.1 was forced with NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) 

data (Saha et al., 2006) and fulfill a date range from Aug. 1995 to Dec. 2012. Outputs 

are available in a 3-hourly frequency. This one is openly distributed via OPeNADP 

((Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol) at: http://tds.hycom.org 

/thredds/dodsC/GLBu0.08/expt_19.1.html, where a GLBu0.08 setting output is 

distributed, and it denotes an interpolation of the original GLBa0.08 setup to an uniform 

cartesian horizontal grid, equally spaced by 0.08° between 80.48°S and 80.48°N, and 40 

vertical depth levels given by: 

 
?@ =  {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70,

(7) 

The Eulerian fields provided by Expt. 19.1 and used in this work were: eastward 

and downward velocity components; temperature and salinity. Data for downward 

velocity, potential temperature and water density were not available at the official web 

page referenced above. 

A setup that uses data assimilation, as this Expt 19.1, is supposed to provide 

more realistic results than a free run, as the Expt 18.1 and 18.3 performed by LABMON. 

Also, outputs are saved in a higher frequency, which allows for more accurate spatial 

advection of virtual particles, part of the tasks proposed in the Lagrangian section of this 

work.

2.2 THE CONNECTIVITY MODELING SYSTEM  

The Connectivity Modeling System (CMS) is a free open source software written 

in Fortran 90 and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/beatrixparis/ 

connectivity-modeling-system. It is a multiscale stochastic Lagrangian framework 

developed at the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp;amp; Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), at the 

University of Miami, to study complex migrations and provide probability estimates of 

dispersion, connectivity, fate of pollutants, and other Lagrangian phenomena (Paris et 

al., 2013). The tool is inherently multiscale, allowing for the seamless moving of particles 

between grids at different resolutions, for the multi-scale tracking of biotic and abiotic 

particles in the ocean.  

As a modular software, CMS permits adding or removing behaviors of the 

particles being simulated as such as of the software by itself. Pre-built modules include 

the Parallel, the Multiscale, the Landmask Boundary, the Vertical Movement, the 

Connectivity Matrix and the Flexible Input and Output ones. Other Modules also present 

in CMS are related to biological studies, such as the Individual Based Model – which 

allows giving particles specific behaviors – the Buoyancy Module – applied, for example, 

to simulate buoyancy of larval eggs – and the Seascape Module – that can be used to 

simulate different marine habitats and their connectivity. 

2.2.1 The CMS Algorithm 

Basically, CMS works “offline” by reading locally stored data that provide fields  

of the Eulerian velocity components along the time of simulation and spatial domain 

desired. Additional information can be considered, as temperature, salinity, and density, 

as such as individual behaviors for each passive or active particle, that can also be 

associated to a specific habitat. In this last case, CMS is able to provide outputs with 

information connecting initial and final position to the corresponding habitats and their 

particles when released and killed: the outstanding feature of CMS, more frequently 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 35 
 

applied for biological purposes. 

Usually, the velocity field is provided by OGCMs output data, that can present 

three components: u (eastward velocity), v (northward velocity), and w (vertical 

velocity); or only two: u and v. The user needs to detail every single particle that must 

be considered for the numerical experiment with CMS, informing, at least, position and 

date of releasing for each single particle, with the condition the offline data must provide 

the velocity fields and other additional variable needed to compute individual behaviors 

(as water density and water temperature) at the exact location where the particle is 

being released for advection. The. multi-scale module permits to utilize data from 

different runs and different OGCMs for different spatial domain, by coupling them with 

a smooth transition. 

Then, the user settles details for the advection method, that can be either 

deterministic, following the velocity field in data, or also stochastic, where random small 

kicks are given on the particle’s velocity components at every time step desired to 

simulate any dynamic process not solved by the OGCM. For evaluating particle 

advection, CMS uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme, and it is applied both in time and 

space (Paris et al., 2013). 

For position, CMS uses a tricubic interpolation method, where 64 neighboring 

grid nodes are used for each dimension of the OGCM output, by using a third-degree 

(cubic) polynomial fitted to the data in every 4 points of each dimension (4 × 4 × 4 =64). For the case in which a two dimensional only Eulerian velocity field is given, then 
CMS will compute a simpler bicubic method. That is aimed to set the position of the 

particle in the grid points of the model grid and then compute variables’ values. A simple 

linear interpolation over time is also performed to adjust the instantaneous velocity fields 

between consecutive snapshots of the integration method and input data, as necessary. 

The particle located at the new numerically integrated position, one time step 

ahead, is now susceptible to the Eulerian fields interpolated at this new position and 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 36 
 

time, as provided by the OGCM data. Thus, a new integration process begins, and the 

trajectory of each particle released in the ensemble is saved in an CMS output file. A 

basic flow chart of the complete code is shown in Fig 2.4, adapted from Paris et al., 2013. 

CMS is previously prepared to run in multiprocessors computers, through its 

parallel module, that uses the Message Passage Interface (MPI) library, so a proper 

compiler that supports MPI is also necessary if parallel computing is intended to be 

applied. CMS supports access to on-the-fly ocean circulation data via OPeNADP, and it 

is also able to read local files of OGCM data in NetCDF, and write output files (with 

the CMS results) in both NetCDF or ASCII formats.

2.3 THE PARCELS ALGORITHM 

Probably, A Really Computationally Efficient Lagrangian Simulator 

(PARCELS) is a set of Python classes and methods developed in the OceanParcels 

Project to create customized simulations of particles’ trajectories based on output data 

of OGCMs. PARCELS can be used to track passive and active particulates, such as 

water, plankton, plastic and fish (Lange &amp;amp; van Sebille, 2017). It is open source, under an 

MIT license, and can be downloaded at https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels. The 

project also keeps a dedicate webpage at www.oceanparcels.org, where a number of 

tutorials on the numerical simulator is available to provide an overview of how to use 

the algorithm and customize experiments. 

This code is designed to match computing needs over the “petaescale era”: the 

current time of human civilization whose technological development allows for 

multiprocessor systems that are capable of achieving computer performances that exceed 1 DEFGHIJD = 1,000,000,000,000,000 logical operations per second. 
Following computing evolution, the OGCMs and Climate Models have also 

begun to be implemented in experiments that request an increasingly higher spatial and 

temporal grid resolutions. Higher resolution models usually mean higher fidelity of the 

results obtained from these models and the real life, but with that is brought a significant 

increase in storage and physical memory demand, once amounts of data reaching more 

than hundreds of terabytes represent outputs of a single experiment. 

Thus, beyond the models themselves, the methods and tools concepted to process 

and analyze all that resulting information should also follow the same computing 

development timescale. However, numerical algorithms of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis 

currently available are not, at the same time, customizable or computationally efficient 

enough to match the increasing complexity requests of numerical experiments, the 

volume of data produced by the high resolution OGCMs, and the individual needs of 

each simulation proposal, whose may present diversified objectives, spatial domain or 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 38 
 

timescales of interest, and formats of the OGCMs’ output files. 

Developed from the ground up, PARCELS tries to fulfill these requirements with 

a code supposedly prepared for an efficient data communication (API) at the same time 

it was designed to operate optimally in high computational performance. Actually, the 

most intriguing aspect of the PARCELS code is the base language chosen by its designers 

to accomplish all that: Python.  

Popular among computing enthusiasts and in many fields of Math and Science, 

Python gained popularity recently thanks to its more user-friendly interaction when 

compared to more traditional programming languages, such as Pascal, Cobol, Assembly, 

C, and Fortran. Nowadays, there are several Python-based tools, freely distributed on 

internet, intended for innumerous tasks, such as bi and three-dimensional graph plotting, 

time series analysis, scientific data processing, web browser and data base servers 

communicating, etc. But, despite of that, Python also got famous for its reputation of 

being considerably slower, especially if compared to C or Fortran – the preferred 

languages when it comes to efficiency and performance. 

To satisfy this request PARCELS makes use of the CPython library, which 

combines a Python interface with a C-based processing algorithm. Thus, it can generate 

a low-level C code for routines that demand higher performance, through a run-time 

compilating CPython code (Just-in-time compilation), making it suitable for critical 

performing computation. 

The code, in a general way, presents a deep level of abstraction that hides from 

the user details about inherent aspects of the algorithm work, as grid changing, 

interpolation, units of measurement, etc. The algorithm is able to read data saved in 

most common formats for big datasets (such as NetCDF, ASCII, etc.) and easily scale 

the velocity fields and any other variable, which can be written in almost any spatial 

grid, including the generalized vertical ones (like the :2 one adopted by HYCOM or the 
one from curvilinear grids, or even any other Cartesian orthogonal ones). The algorithm 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 39 
 

can handle missing data and data is used as is, then only the interpolations that are 

required to evaluate the Eulerian field at a specific particle’s position and instant of time 

are performed during the execution of the simulation. The Eulerian fields data may be 

provided by different sources, from different models and grids, the code is also able to 

perform a loop over the data boundaries and evaluate the initial particles’ positioning on 

a line, or an external file, and the same ensemble can be released every customizable 

interval, and they are advected until some specific date and time or until a maximum 

simulation time. These aspects may save a valuable time when it comes to the tuning 

and implementation of experiments, and reveal a great advantage over other Lagrangian 

simulators, as the CMS, for example. 

Figure 3.1 shows a schematic diagram of the functional abstraction with which 

the model was conceived: The user should define: the variables of the system; the 

ensemble of particles to be simulated and the customizable routines to be computed 

besides the time advection (the so-called kernels). The algorithm is responsible for 

performing the time integration loop and updating the state of the particle ensemble, 

adapting the OGCMs Eulerian fields data as needed and writing the output files. It is 

still possible to visualize, in real time, the simulated movement of the ensemble of 

particles, and the temporal variation of the velocity field or any other property. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

FIGURE 2.7 | PARCELS algorithm flowchart. The code was conceived in a high abstraction level, requesting 
from the user the strictly necessary input information. (Adapted from Lange &amp;amp; van Sebille, 2017) 



NUMERICAL TOOLS 40 
 

Finally, the user can create as many custom kernels as he wants or needs. A 

kernel is the outstanding feature of PARCELS, defined as a customizable and versatile 

routine algorithm, write by the user, that will be evaluated along the simulation, and 

can be a function of any field or variable, allowing the user to assign a special or 

individualized behavior to the particles. That may represent, for example: boundaries of 

integration for each particle in terms of their life time, mortality rate, or habitat; a 

discretized model for biotic or abiotic tracer; an along trajectory sampling of the fluid’s 

properties – such as temperature, salinity, nutrients, etc.; any specific actions matching 

conditional clauses, useful in cases which the particle may be placed at certain non-

realistic or killing depth, or if it approaches the coast; etc. 

In a matter of fact, PARCELS and CMS employ the same numerical method for 

advection, the 4th order Runge-Kutta, two- or three-dimensional; but the PARCELS’s 

user can also choose between the Runge-Kutta45 (a varying timestep method) or the 

simpler Euler forward, instead. A stochastic method to simulate horizontal diffusion is 

implemented in the code, described by a simple Brownian motion. 

For post-processing analysis, PARCELS brings a number of scripts and methods 

for graphical visualization of the simulated results, whose output can be written in an 

adjustable chunk size NetCDF format, that can be adapted to reduce the final volume 

of data saved in disk. In addition, a vast library of Python tools is freely distributed by 

diverse sources, and they can be used with PARCELS’s output files. An extensive 

documentation and a set of tutorials for PARCELS is supplied by the OceanParcels 

webpage, making the installing process and the initial familiarization with the algorithm 

and its features, for any user that holds a minimum knowledge of computer programing, 

even if new to Python specifically, to become easy and clear. 

However, PARCELS is not yet fully prepared for large simulations that considers 

long time series, and high resolution OGCM, once the implementation of parallel 

processing is a functionality still in development stage and promised for its next versions. 



 

3 | EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF THE 
INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW 

This chapter discusses the ITF based on the HYCOM experiments performed at 

LABMON (here referred as Expt 18.1 and Expt. 18.3) and a short analysis for the Expt. 

19.1 with HYCOM+NCODA performed by NRL.   

The output of the climatological run (Expt. 18.1) was analyzed to identify the 

average patterns concerning the ITF circulation and of the vertical profiles of speed, 

temperature and salinity along the straits that compounds the inflow and outflow 

pathways, considering a Eulerian framework. 

The volume transport was estimated in the upper 700 m depth. The time series 

of this run, once there is no interannual variability forcing, was also used to determine 

the seasonal variability of ITF. On the other hand, the run forced with inter-annually 

varying data was studied to analyze interannual ITF  variabilities, the expected responses 

to ENSO and long-term trends, considering the volume and heat transports in each strait, 

also in the upper 700 m. 

To obtain a more accurate result, in addition to the estimations of the transports 

across Makassar, Lombok, Ombai and Timor straits, two more regions were also 

considered: the Karimata Strait, located to southeast of Borneo island; and another small 

strait to the south of Flores Sea. 

Furthermore, instead of computing the transports along Lifamatola passage, an 

alternative section crossing small islands to south of Maluku Sea was been chosen. Thus, 

the inflow pathway comprehends the Karimata, Makassar and Moluccas sections; and 

the outflow, Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor sections. This methodology allows to 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 42 
 

acquire values in more grid points and leads to a closer ITF domain. Fig. 3.1 illustrates 

the names and location of all straits considered for calculations. Lifamatola passage is 

highlighter in Fig. 3.3.  

3.1 AVERAGE FLOW AND PATHWAYS – CLIMATOLOGICAL RUN 

Fig. 3.1 illustrates the spatial domain of ITF on the globe (top) and the contouring of 

the average Sea Surface Height (SSH), colored by SSH variance, for the whole ten last 

years of the Expt. 18.1 time series. As it has been previously shown (Mayer et al., 2010), 

the ITF is mostly driven as part of the strong Tropical Pacific Ocean circulation, where 

the western boundary is not completely closed when it reaches the Indonesian 

archipelago, allowing the flux to go through ITF straits. Thus, it is possible to note on 

northeastern corner of the region plotted, the pathway of input of superficial waters from 

North Pacific into the Indonesian seas, where higher values of SSH around this poorly-

closed boundary indicate an accumulation of volume that cannot easily enter the 

Indonesian seas, generating local anomalies on the elevation of surface. Also, high values 

of SSH and SSH variance to northwestern of Australia indicate the mean surface flux 

around the outflow region. 

The average horizontal velocity field in ITF has been plotted using data of the 

climatological run, considering the mean field in the last ten years of the time series. The 

horizontal map obtained for the mixed layer are shown in Fig. 3.2. For the superficial 

flow, as expected, waters coming from North Pacific enters the Indonesian seas mostly 

through Makassar strait, where one could observe a stronger southward flow, that reaches 

Flores Sea and bifurcates. The western branch goes straightly southward in direction of 

the Lombok strait, where it is then injected into the Indian Ocean basin. The other 

branch, in its turn, seems to retroflects to east toward the Banda Sea. A small flux exits 

Indonesian archipelago still in Flores sea through a small strait. The major flow keeps in 

route within Banda Sea and goes out toward the Indian Ocean passing through both
 .

Indonesian archipelago to Indian Ocean basin by travelling throughout Lombok, 
Flores, Ombai and Timor straits. A smaller intense flow can be observed entering 
the Indonesian seas by inflowing through Karimata strait.

sides of Timor island, crossing the Ombai strait and the Timor island’s southern passage. 

All the outflows converge in the Indian Ocean in a westward superficial flux with core 

around 11°S. Another relatively smaller inflow can be distinguished in the figures crossing 

the Karimata strait southward, entering the Java Sea, which is shallower than Flores 

and Banda Seas (as it is represented in bathymetry of Fig. 3.3). Another weak flow, 

north of Australia, seems also to go into the Banda Sea. But the average field shows this 

superficial flux mixing with other  .superficial Banda’s water forming a flow northward, 

exiting the Indonesian seas through Lifamatola passage. 

Fig. 3.3 depicts the mean velocity field at 1000 m depth. At this depth, the 

Lifamatola passage acts as a single inflow pathway with subthermocline waters entering 

the Banda Sea through Lifamatola. The southward flow follows the topographic 

boundaries of different islands of the sea and eventually enters the Indian Ocean basin 

by outflowing through Ombai and Timor straits. In Fig. 3.3 it is also represented the

in the last ten years of the Climatological Run. The Lifamatola passage is the only 
pathway for the inflow of deep water from Pacific Ocean into the Indonesian seas. 
A southward deep flow is formed in Banda Sea and its trajectory follows is affected 
by topographic boundaries which exist in the sea due to presence of small islands. 
Lastly, these deep waters exit from the Indonesian archipelago toward the Indian 
Ocean by outflowing through Ombai strait and Timor passage. The graph also

200 m and 1000 m isobaths. Since the southern Banda Sea is shallower than the 

Lifamatola sill (van Aken et al., 2009), this passageway controls the deep flow from the 

Pacific to the Indian Ocean. 
 
 

3.2 VERTICAL PROFILES: 
CROSS-SECTION CURRENTS AND STRATIFICATION – EXPT. 18.1 

The output of the climatological run was also analyzed to study the vertical 

structure of flows and waters physical properties represented by HYCOM. For that 

purpose, major sections have been analyzed: Makassar strait and the Lifamatola passage 

for their importance on inflow pathways and the Ombai strait and Timor passage for 

carrying both shallow and deep ITF outflow. 

Fig. 3.4 shows vertical sections across two inflow passageways. In this figure, the mean 

vertical profiles, for the last ten years of the climatological run, the cross-section velocity, 

the potential temperature and the salinity are plotted for Makassar strait and Lifamatola 

passage. Across Makassar, as it was expected, the flow is southward in the whole strait 

and occurs in the upper 800 m depth. Two cores appear to be distinguished: the first 

one closer to surface, at ~ 100 m depth, with mean along-section speed greater than 1.0 

m/s; and the other, below the thermocline, at approximately 500 m, showing a slower 

maximum speeds ~ 0.2 m/s. 

The vertical distribution of velocity in Lifamatola, however, is quite different. 

The graphic in Fig. 3.4 shows two different regimes: one in the upper 450 m depth and 

other between 450 and 2000 m below the surface. In the shallower part, it shows, for 

the western portion of the strait, an average surface northward flow, that reverses to 

southward, at ?100 m depth, and turns back to the north between ?200 m and ?450 m

FIGURE 3.4 | Vertical Structure of major inflow passageway of ITF: Makassar strait (left) and Lifamatola 
passage (right). Current speed across the strait (meridional component) are showed in the graphs on top 
and Salinity and Potential Temperature stratification on bottom. Blue color intensities indicate a southward 
flow, while red ones denote a northward flow. In Makassar there is a continuous flux with two cores (above 
and below the thermocline) and it is not deeper than 800 m. In Lifamatola, HYCOM is representing an 
alternating direct flux, where the deep flux presents a core ?1100 m depth. The stratification patterns show 
Lifamatola subthermocline waters slightly more saline than ones in Makassar. This suggests origins in North 
Pacific for waters within Makassar and South Pacific for Lifamatola deep flow. 

 

depth; but for the eastern portion, only a slower southward flow exists in the upper 200 

m depth. Below 450 m depth, the flux is more intense, directed southward and extending 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 47 
 

to the bottom, with the core at ?1100 m. 

These results concerning the circulation in Lifamatola appear to disagree to 

analyses obtained with INSTANT data. van Aken et al. (2009) observed a northward 

flow in the upper 1250 m depth, and the core of the deep southeastward current would 

be closer to the bottom, at ?1900 m depth. However, there are two different approaches: 

here, in order to represent the Lifamatola passage, a zonal section at 1.78°S has been 

chosen, and the vertical profile of the cross-section current is just the meridional 

component of velocity; in (van Aken et al., 2009), authors used a different analysis, 

considering the effect of internal tides on the dynamic, thus, the vertical profile of the 

along-section flow assumes a more realistic current’s component. 

On the other hand, this representation of HYCOM for the throughflow structure 

along the Lifamatola seems to be closer to results achieved by Luick &amp;amp; Cresswell (2001). 

As in INSTANT analyses, authors also used data of a single mooring located in Maluku 

Sea, and assuming a horizontally homogenous flow they found an average southward 

current between 740 m and 1500 m below the surface along the whole Lifamatola 

passage, estimating a total transport of 7 Sv, very larger than the 2.5 Sv estimated by 

van Aken et al. (2009). 

Nevertheless, the temperature and salinity stratification agree to the previous 

work for both inflow straits. In Lifamatola, a relatively more salinity water below the 

thermocline is observed, which corresponds to South Pacific subthermocline waters 

carried into Indonesian Seas by the South Equatorial current (van Aken et al, 2009; 

Mayer et al., 2010). Makassar inflow is mostly formed by North Pacific waters, coming 

from the North Equatorial current.	
The same representation for Ombai strait and Timor passage is shown in  

Fig. 3.5. These are the outflow pathways where the deep waters from Lifamatola exit to 

the Indian Ocean. For both straits, a westward mean flow is observed, with two distinct 

cores along the water column. The shallower transports waters inflowing through

FIGURE 3.5 | Vertical structure of Ombai strait (left) and Timor passage (right) showing the flow across 
the straits (top) and the stratification profile (bottom).  Blue intensities denote westward velocities and 
red ones means eastward velocities crossing the section. In both straits, the flow presents two cores, one 
above and other below thermocline, transporting waters which previously passed through Makassar and 
Lifamatola, respectively. 

 

Makassar, at ~ 50 m depth (above thermocline). The other, at approximately 1000 m 

depth in Ombai and 1100 m in Timor (below thermocline). In Timor, the deeper flow 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 49 
 

occurs between 400 m and 1600 m depths. In Ombai strait the flow seems to extend 

from 400 m below the surface down to the bottom in the middle of strait’s width. These 

deeper cores are related to the deep water coming from Lifamatola. This agrees to direct 

estimates using INSTANT data (Sprintall et al., 2009). The stratification profiles show 

a relatively lesser saline waters passing through both straits if compared to those within 

Lifamatola. This is a good representation of the model concerning the role of ITF on 

changing the Pacific inflow waters before putting them into the Indian basin.  
 
 

3.3 VOLUME TRANSPORT IN THE UPPER 700 M 

To quantify the volume transported by ITF in Expt. 18.1, the upper 700 m data 

were considered. This depth allows to study variabilities related to air-sea interaction 

and anomalies that can be propagated under the thermocline.  

3.3.1 Methodology 

The volume transported by a geophysical flow crossing a vertical section, here 

also referred as vertically (or depth-) integrated volume transport, is: 

 KL = ? N ? O?Q  dRS  (8) 
where N is the velocity vector; T and U are, respectively, the eastward and northward 
components of the velocity field; A is the surface delimited by the section; O?Q  is the 
pointing vector normal to the surface A; 4 and 6 are the eastward and the northward 
position components, respectively; and ? is the depth (see Appendix A). 

For the meridional transport of volume across a vertical section along a fixed 

latitude )V (as for Karimata, Makassar, Moluccas, Lombok and Flores straits), from the 
free surface down to 700 m depth, using the grid discretization of the HYCOM GLBa0.08 

and GLBu0.08, given by Eq. (2), (5), (6) and (7), the Eq. (8) can be written as (for 

latitudes to the south of 47°N):

(9) 

where 48  and 4_  are the east and west limit of the section; 78  is the mean radius of 
the Earth;  5?@ = ?@ ? ?@? 1 (10) 
is the vertical thickness of the grid element; and  5U',(,@2 = 12 (U',(,@ ? U',(,@? 1) (11) 
is the mean northward velocity along the vertical direction of the grid element. The 

transport KLW is a scalar value, and it is positive for a northward flow and negative for 
a southward flow. 

The zonal transport of volume across a vertical section along a fixed longitude &amp;amp;V (as considered for Ombai and Timor straits), from the surface down to 700 m depth, 
using the grid discretization of HYCOM GLBa0.08 and GLBu0.08, given by Eq. (3), 

(5), (6) and (7), the Eq. (8) can be written as (for latitudes to the south of 47°N):

(12) 

where 6f  and 6g  are the north and south limits of the section, respectively, and  5T',(,@2 = 12 (T',(,@ ? T',(,@? 1) (13) 
is the mean eastward velocity along the vertical direction of the grid element. KL\ is 
positive for an eastward flow, but negative for a westward flow.  

3.3.2 Expt. 18.1 – Climatological Run 

In the ITF region winds are strongly driven by a monsoon system, which forces 

seasonal variability of ITF. To illustrate the wind pattern along the climatological year 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 51 
 

and the seasonal variability in the volume transport of the ITF, using data of the 

climatological run and the wind field from NCEP data used as forcing, Fig. 3.6 shows 

maps for each typical (climatologically averaged) month of the upper 700 m depth-

integrated transport per grid element area (in Sv/m2). That is given by:

FIGURE 3.6 | Maps of the upper 700 m depth-integrated transport. Values are shown for each single grid 
point, where blue colors denote lower values of transport and red higher. Units are given in 10-9 Sv/m2 (in a 0.08° 
horizontal grid). Arrows represent the wind field. Name of the months are abbreviated in the bottom right corner 
of each map. The change in wind direction along the year is due to a monsoon pattern that drives winds in the 
ITF region. As it can be seen in the Figure, this drives seasonal variability of the ITF transports, and consequently 
in the amount of waters exchange from Pacific to the Indian Ocean. 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 52 
 

The graphs reveal the change of wind directions over the climatological year and 

the answer of the transport in the upper ocean in the spatial domain of ITF. Stronger 

transports occur during the southeast monsoon, from June to September, when winds 

blow in the same direction of the outflow and in the opposite direction of the inflow path. 

Otherwise, during the northwest monsoon, the surface transport relaxes, the wind over 

the IO blows in opposite direction of the outflow, but in the same direction of the inflow 

fluxes over the Indonesian seas. This strong seasonal variability has been also observed 

in INSTANT data (Sprintall et al., 2009). 

To estimate the volume transported by ITF, cross-section fluxes in Karimata, 

Makassar and Moluccas straits were used to quantify the total inflow volume transported 

in the upper 700 m depth. Transports across Lombok, Flores, Ombai and Timor straits 

together give the total outflow. Fig. 3.7 shows the typical year (climatology-month 

averaged) for the Climatological Run the ITF’s inflow and outflow volume transports in 

the upper 700 m depth. 
 
 
 
 

It can be seen the seasonal variability of the ITF and the reverse behavior of 

outflow vs inflow change along the year: while February is typically the month when 

there is the lowest outflow transport (negative values), is also the highest mean value for

Dashed lines are the mean annual value for inflow (red) and outflow (black).  Superficial ITF transports

the inflow transport. The mean annual value for outflow transport has been estimated in 

12.3 Sv, and for the outflow, 13.2 Sv. The 0.9 Sv imbalance is proportional to the 

standard deviation of values. 

3.3.3 Expt. 18.3 – Interannual Forcing Run 

Outflow and inflow transports are computed as the sum of the individual 

transports across each strait that forms the respective pathway. Time series showing the 

amount of Pacific waters which transported to the Indian Ocean basin in the upper 700 

m, from 1970 to 2015, smoothed every four months, are given in Fig. 3.8. The plots show 

the behavior of surface ITF’s volume transport across Timor, Ombai, Lombok and Flores 

straits and the total outflow. The mean outflow for the entire period has been estimated 

in 14 Sv. Also, a trend of increasing 0.04 Sv/year has been found. 

As proposed by Fyfe et al. (2016), the present work considers the hiatus for the

period (1970-1990); the “accelerated warming” (1991-2000) where, between 1991 and 1995 there was a 
systematic increase in the transport with trend ~1.4 Sv/year; and the “slowdown warming” (1991-2000) 
where ITF also presented an increasing transport of volume 

 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 54 
 

 
 

years between 2001 and 2012. A base historical period is taken between 1970 and 1990,  

and an additional period between 1991 and 2000 is also considered. For this middle 

period, a strong term increasing the transport of volume of ITF was found, specially 

between 1991 and 1995. A discussion about possible effects will be given in Section 3.4.2.  

As discussed in Introduction, the ITF is influenced by different modes of 

variability, in different timescales. The ENSO is an important global climate variability 

mode that affects the ITF. To measure this relation, output data of the Interannual 

Forcing Run was used to compute mean values of volume transport across all straits 

during different ENSO events. 

To assess the impact of ENSO, the monthly surface ITF transport across each 

of the three main inflow regions (Fig. 3.9) and the four main outflow straits (Fig. 3.10). 

The graphics show the transports considering mean values in all years of the time series, 

mean values taken only during five El Niño events and five La Niña events. For El Niño, 

the 1972/73 (strong), 1982/83 (very strong), 1991/92 (moderate), 1997/98 (very strong) 

and 2014/15 (very strong) events have been considered. And for La Niña, the 1973/74 

(strong), 1975/76 (strong), 1988/89 (strong), 1999/2000 (moderate), and 2010/11 

(moderate) have been also considered. 

Figs. 3.9 and 3.10 show, in a general line, that transports are larger during La 

Niña and smaller during El Niño events. For the inflow straits, Moluccas shows larger 

transport for both El Niño and La Niña. Previous work (van Sebille et al., 2014; Valsala 

et al., 2011), have obtained comparable results, but reporting a smaller transport along 

Moluccas section during La Niña events, in an opposite behavior with Makassar. 

However, in this work only the superficial transports are being considered. In Makassar 

strait the mean transport in all years is 12.4 Sv, for La Niña years is 13.5 Sv and only 

10.9 for El Niño ones. 

For the outflow straits, as expected, a larger transport for La Niña events occurs 

in all straits. Lombok presents a mean transport value for all years of ~ 2.5 Sv, and it 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 55 
 

increases to 3.0 Sv for La Niña years and decrease to 2.0 for El Niño. In Timor, the 

values are 6.4 Sv (all years), 7.4 Sv (La Niña) and 5.5 (El Niño). In Ombai, 4.7 Sv (all 

years), 5.4 Sv (La Niña) and 3.9 Sv (El Niño).

Despite the fact we considered here only the transport in the first 700 m while 

INSTANT estimated it full-depth, the comparison is still valid once the flows are mainly 

concentrated close to the surface. Thus, it can be seen the HYCOM runs satisfactorily 

represent the ITF flows. In addition, Table 3-1 also shows mean values of volume 

transport across the same passages evaluated only during years when significant ENSO 

events occurred; and, as expected, the volume of water changed from the Pacific Ocean 

to the Indian Ocean are in average smaller during an El Niño and expressively larger for 

a year when a La Niña phase is being experienced.

To validate the output of the Expt. 19.1 with HYCOM, by NRL, in the interest 

area of this work, the map in the Fig. 3.14 shows the surface speed for a snapshot 

considering this run. 

The transport of volume in the ITF outflow were also evaluated for the three 

last years of the timeseries, and a mean value of 16 Sv for the vertically integrated 

transport in the upper 700 m was found, in accordance with the results discussed in 

Sections 3.4 and 3.5.

sections. 

A linear trend for the entire timeseries was of increasing 0.008 Sv/year. But, 

considering only the hiatus period, from 2001 to 2012, a trend of increasing 0.013 Sv/year 

is observed, revealing a response of ITF to the event.

3.4 HEAT TRANSPORT IN THE UPPER 700 M 

3.4.1 Methodology 

The heat transported by a geophysical flow whose heat budget obeys to a closure 

relation can be given in terms of the transport of its Internal Energy (Vranes et al., 2002; 

England &amp;amp; Huang, 2005; Tillinger &amp;amp; Gordon, 2010): 

 sL = ? tuv(? ? ? x)N ? O?Q  dRS  (15) 
where t is the density of water; uv is the specific heat at constant pressure; ?  is the 
potential temperature and ? x is the referential potential temperature evaluated at an 
arbitrary section where the transport is zero for that flow. 

Usually, ? x ~ 3 ? is used for ITF, when the referential section is considered 
from the southern Australia to Antarctica. But, once this work is concerned about 

relative values of transport between different years, for simplification, the referential 

temperature will be considered as   ? x = 0.0 ? (16) 
For the Indonesian Throughflow, the meridional (southward) transport of heat 

for the upper 700 m across a vertical section of latitude )V = )V(6V)  will be (see 
Appendix A): 

 sLW(4, 6V, ?)  = ? uv  ? ? t(4, 6V, ?) ? (4, 6V, ?) U(4, 6V, ?) d4 d?Y= YZY= Y[\= 700\= 0  (17) 
where the minus (–) signal on the left is to denotate a positive Heat Transport southward. 

The specific heat of water is considered constant, equal to:  uv = 3993.0 Jkg ? ? (18) 
 For a vertical section at longitude &amp;amp;V = &amp;amp;V(4V) , the upper 700 m depth 

integrated heat transport from ITF westward is: 

 sL\(4V, 6, ?)  = ? uv  ? ? t(4V, 6, ?) ? (4V, 6, ?) T(4V, 6, ?) d6 d?c= cdc= ce\= 700\= 0  (19)

3.4.2 Expt. 18.3 – Interannual Forcing Run 

Once the ITF is a relevant part of the global MOC, the amount of energy that 

it transports into the Indian Ocean is particularly important in the maintenance of the 

global climate and heat distribution around the planet. Fig. 3.11 shows the time series 

for the heat transport estimated as the sum of the heat transport across each outflow 

strait. The mean value was estimated in 1.20 PW (1 PW = 1015 W), and a linear long-

term trend of increasing 0.005 PW/year. Interannual variabilities on the heat transport 

are also related to ENSO and IOD. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

FIGURE 3.12 | ITF heat transport in the upper 700 m estimated across the outflow straits from 1970 to 
2015, smoothed every four months. The envelopes denote the standard error. Blue dash line is the mean 
value and the red line is the linear fit of the curve. As for the volume transport, the ITF’s heat transport 
also presents a strong interannual and seasonal variability. MEAN total =  -1.20 PW | mean1 = -1.14 PW 
| trend1 = +0.004 PW/year | mean2 = -1.32 ± 0.5 PW | trend2 = -0.01 PW/year | trend_green = -0.10 
PW/year 

Lee et al. (2015) showed that the abrupt increase in Indian Ocean heat content 

in recent years has an origin in anomalies within the Pacific Ocean. These anomalies 

could be transported into the Indian Ocean via the ITF. For the same period considered 

by authors, which also has been observed the global warming hiatus phenomenon, we 

also analyzed the ITF heat transport with HYCOM data. Considering the mean value of 

-1.2 PW, acquired in the whole time series, the anomaly on heat transport for the years 

between 2002 and 2012 were studied. Fig. 3.12 presents this curve. In this particular 

period, the increase in the heat transported from Pacific to Indian Ocean was much larger 

than the small trend in the entire series. From 2002 to 2012, around 0.05 PW was added 

annually to the ITF heat transport in the upper 700 m. This result emphasizes that the 



EULERIAN ANALYSIS OF ITF 61 
 

abrupt increase of the heat content within Indian Ocean has originated in Pacific Ocean 

and has been transported from a basin to other via the Indonesian Throughflow, since it 

also shows an abrupt increase for the period on the outflow heat transport. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

FIGURE 3.13 | ITF’s heat transport anomaly from 2002 to 2012, bi-monthly smoothed. The anomaly was 
calculated considering the mean value for the entire time series, and the transports are estimated across 
the outflow straits. Envelopes are the standard errors. Red line is the fit linear of the points plotted. A 
large linear increasing trend of the ITF’s heat transport was observed at this period. 

 

However, this behavior is not verified for the last years of the time series of the 

model run. In fact, 2014/2015 were years related to a very strong El Niño event, and in 

such situation, a smaller value for the transport across the ITF should be expected. Fig. 

3.13 shows the ITF heat transport anomaly from June/2013 to December/2015, and in 

the same graph is also plotted the Nino3.4 Index anomaly, as provided from the NOAA 

dataset (Rayner, 2003). Both curves variate in a similar way for these years: as the 

Nino3.4 increase, the ITF heat transport decrease (negative values). This represents a 

strong response of the ITF to the 2014/15 and 2015/16 El Niño events, and suggests 

possible relations with current anomalies on the heat content within the Indo-Pacific

4 | LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 

The present work is part of the research project Impact of the Southern Atlantic 

on the global overturning circulation (MOC) and climate (SAMOC), the Brazilian 

contribution for The South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (SAMOC) 

Initiative (find out more at: https://bv.fapesp.br/en/auxilios/46145/impact-of-the-

southern-atlantic-on-the-global-overturning-circulation-moc-and-climate-samoc/ and 

http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/SAMOC_international/index.php), whose objectives 

is to study and promote observations and numerical modelling experiments to monitor 

the South Atlantic Circulation. 

A particular meridional line has been used for that purpose: the 34.5°S, known 

as SAMOC Basin-wide Array (SAMBA), that connects the South American continent 

to the further south point of the African continent and reveals lots of information about 

the circulation. From the surface to the sea floor of this line, there is the transit of many 

water masses of great importance to the global circulation (including cores of the North 

Atlantic Deep Water and of the Antarctic Bottom Water). Also, important currents 

cross that line: in the upper layers, for example, the Agulhas leakage can be found on 

the east portion of the line and the Brazil Current on the west, part of the South Atlantic 

Subtropical Gyre. 

Output data from the Expt. 18.3 (Interannual Forcing Run – HYCOM 

GLBa0.08 by LABMON) and the Expt. 19.1 (HYCOM GLBu0.08 by NRL) were used 

for a set of Lagrangian Analyses employing PARCELS and CMS algorithms, and were 

labeled as: PAR_18.3mix; CMS_18.3 and CMS_19.1. 

The Lagrangian description of the geophysical fluids is based on tracking every 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 64 
 

macroscopic particle of the fluid and follow their trajectories (see Appendix B). The 

study of the movement of particles in complex flows, the case for the Earth’s ocean and 

atmosphere, should consider chaotic motion, that is found even for the simplest fields of 

velocity for the geophysical fluids. The result of a Lagrangian analysis based on data 

from Eulerian fields for a discrete treatment, i.e., not considering every single particle of 

the fluid, will be a probabilistic distribution that represents the chance of some variable, 

particle, or property of the fluid being observed at that instant and position. 

4.1 METHODOLOGY 

To study correlations between the South Atlantic Circulation and the Indonesian 

Throughflow, virtual Lagrangian particles have been tracked from the present days to 

the past, i.e.: an initial ensemble of particles is virtually released at the SAMBA line at 

every time interval. The Eulerian velocity fields are inverted and the particles are 

advected using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integrator for a timestep of 6 hours, 

computing the trajectories in a backward recovered motion. This approach aims to 

answer the question “where did those particles come from?”, i.e., the main objective is 

to evaluate the sources of the composition of the waters in the South Atlantic for the 

present days. Output data of the simulations is given every 24 hours.  

Trying to represent chaotic transports, effects of molecular and turbulent 

diffusion and physical processes weakly or not represented in models’ outputs, both 

Lagrangian algorithms descripted in Chapter 2 (CMS and PARCELS) bring, as usually 

is done, numerical modules of stochastic parametrizations that mix stochastic 

components to the deterministic advection terms. However, depending on the spatial and 

time resolutions available for the Eulerian fields provided by the OGCM, and on the 

processes supposedly not solved by the model and that one wishes to represent, adding 

stochastic terms can be unnecessary or not efficient at all, besides bringing an additional 

computing effort. That can be especially true in the case there is sufficient resolution and 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 65 
 

proper representation of the mesoscale processes (Koszalka et al., 2013; Sebille et al., 

2018). 

Having in mind such aspects related to the HYCOM runs whose this work has 

utilized, no stochastic noise were added to the advection for the Lagrangian experiments 

that will be studied in this Chapter, for both CMS and PARCELS, once the GLBa0.08 

implementation of HYCOM was based on resolving mesoscale eddies. Additional 

considerations about the chaotic behavior of the interoceanic exchange are beyond the 

purposes of this work. 

4.2 PAR_18.3MIX 

This experiment utilizes the PARCELS algorithm as the numerical tool for 

Lagrangian Analysis. However, as yet not fully operational, PARCELS holds some 

limitations, as not dealing with particles too close to the coast, and only works at 1 

processor at each time. 

Output data of Expt. 18.3 were used to input the Eulerian fields of the barotropic 

velocity and the temperature of the mixed layer, from 2015 backward to 1990. Particles 

were released on the surface at 34.5°S (0 m depth) every month from 2015 to 2010 and 

horizontally advected, simulating surface drifters. The temperature is interpolated by the 

code along the computed trajectory. If the particle travels beyond the spatial limit of 

interest, it is then excluded from that time instant of simulation. The map with all 

trajectories for the entire simulation time is given in Fig. 4.1. Blue colors denote lower 

water temperature, and the red ones warmer waters. Some patterns of the surface 

circulation can be inferred from Fig. 4.1: Subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and 

Indian Ocean; the ITF (very weak though) coming from the east; the temperature 

difference between the Benguela Current (pink color to the southwest of Africa) – 

matching a cold water current – and the Brazil Current – represented by the warmer 

trajectories as a western boundary current; the region of Brazil-Malvinas Confluence

FIGURE 4.1 | Conjunct of all trajectories of simulation PAR_18.3mix, between 1990 and 2015. Colors indicate 
the temperature at each trajectory position, in °C. 

between 35°C and 50°S, with some portion of the Malvinas Current flowing northward 

into the Brazilian coast; and the South Atlantic Current, carrying cooler waters to the 

east. 

For a probabilistic approach, it is common to analyze the set of trajectories 

through the frequency of visits in binned grid. A grid of reasonable size must be scaled 

in terms of the time resolution with which the trajectories’ data are written and must be 

large enough so that all the trajectory points that pass through a grid cell in the 

simulation time are computed. 

The result is a probability distribution map as seen in Fig. 4.2. For that map, 

the colors represent the probability to find any particle at an arbitrary time of the entire 

simulation time considered for the PAR_18.3mix, within a 1° × 1° horizontally spaced 
cell. This map is, above all, a correlation profile: since all the initial conditions starts 

along the line 34.5°S (shown as the white dashed line in Fig. 4.2), it is expected that the 

grid cells close to that region are more likely to host some particle for the observation 

time of all trajectories. 

However, one needs to be in mind that all the Lagrangian analyses that is shown 

in this chapter were computed with a negative timestep, that is, from the present to the

past, which investigates the origin of the water parcels present in the initial condition 

region at the initial time. Therefore, the correlation that must be done is that the colors 

also represent a greater or lesser probability of each binned cell being responsible for a 

different source of water bodies present in the vicinity of the surface of the SAMBA line 

from 2010 to 2015 of initial conditions). 

Another point to note is that darker colors, which denote higher probability of 

observation by grid cell, do not necessarily denote a more intense circulation pattern. 

Instead, the high frequency of observations may mean recirculation of particles. This 

phenomenon is highlighted in black and lilac in the South Atlantic, which, although 

distant from the region of initial condition to the northwest and southwest, coincide with 

the contour of the subtropical gyration, where, especially for the South Atlantic is a 

region of accumulation of (eg McAdam &amp;amp; Sebille, 2018), which in the oceans are floats 

that spread on the surface in a manner similar to the dynamics considered in the 

PAR_18.3mix simulation. 

Among the central objectives of the present work is the correlation study 

between the ITF and the LA, and the developed Lagrangian analyses were designed and 

conceived for this purpose. However, as shown in Fig. 4.3, the PAR_18.3mix simulation 

did not provide enough data for such analysis: of all computed trajectories, only three 

were those that connected the two systems for the analyzed period. This result, however,

is not an abnormal not expected result, because surface floats are subject to dynamic 

processes that rather depend on the superficial pressure oscillation and atmospheric 

events, causing the particles to be confined for long periods in the subtropical turns, 

necessitating longer displacement so that connections between ocean basins can be 

verified. Also, the purely horizontal surface movement may not be enough to represent 

the movement in the open ocean (predominantly baroclinic), when it is desired to study 

processes that depend, among other factors, on vertical flows, as in the case of ITF. 
 

4.3 CMS_18.3 

This experiment considers the CMS as a numerical model for trajectory 

simulation. Virtual particles were released once monthly during the year 2015, along the 

SAMBA line and between 0 and 1000 m depth. As the CMS does not interpolate the 

initial values of the particles, the values for the depth are the same made available in 

the HYCOM output files, where some of the 33 vertical levels in meters were considered: 

{0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000}. 

As the systems under study (ITF and AL) occur essentially on the surface and 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 69 
 

subsurface of the oceans, depths up to 1000 m are sufficient for this study. In addition, 

as we have shown in previous reports, results with Expt. 18.3 in the ITF does not seem 

to represent with fidelity the deeper regions. As a cause of this, in other factors, there 

may be the “warm up” time of the model: the deep ocean requires hundreds of years to 

adjust; but for the upper ocean that is just about 50 years (Kantha &amp;amp; Clayson, 2000). 

We consider as input values for the velocity fields in the CMS the results of Expt 

18.3 with HYCOM. Outputs are provided with mean values computed every 6 days, 

comprising the zonal, meridional and vertical components of the total velocity, that is, 

as HYCOM associates for data output purposes the vertical coordinate with density 

levels, grid to which the CMS does not support, the speed computed in the orthogonal 

grid linearly interpolated and smoothed, and later interpolated once more by the CMS, 

considers not only the baroclinic component of the velocity in the original grid point of 

the model, but the total component taking possible rotations of adjust to the orthogonal 

grid at z-levels.  

The simulation is for the period between 1994 and 2015. The particles are also 

advected using Runge-Kutta of 4th order, in the 3 spatial dimensions and in the time 

with negative integration step also of 6h. Results are written every 1 day. 

This simulation brings relevant data regarding the vertical dynamics of the 

movement, considering three-dimensional velocity fields, available from the surface to 

the ocean floor, for the entire analyzed region. Fig. 4.4 shows the complete set of 

trajectories obtained, indicating in red the initial condition points on the line 34.5°S, 

and, in blue tones, the different depths at which the particles were observed. Although 

the largest depth provided as the initial condition was 1000 m, the input data contained 

values for the entire water column, including values for the vertical velocity component, 

which allowed the particles to move to shallower or deeper regions. 

As discussed in the previous section, Fig. 4.5 shows the probability distribution 

by grid cell, in this case also 1° × 1° horizontally spaced and vertically extended from

the surface to the bottom, of observing a particle at some instant of time for the 

simulation period. The same correlation analysis can be done: the color scale denotes a 

stronger or weaker probability that each grid cell was a location from which the waters 

that were present between the surface and 1000 m depth along the SAMBA line in the 

year of 2015: the year in which the particles were "collected" monthly, that is, strictly, 

considering the integration of the present into the past, the particles are not "released", 

but collected in the position and instant of initial condition (which is in the final condition 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 71 
 

of the movement). 

In addition to the circulation patterns quoted for the simulation with the surface 

floats of the previous section, the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.5 show flow through the 

Indonesian straits more intense, with depths varying in ~10 m below the surface. It can 

also be seen a flow through the south of Australia, bringing waters of the South Pacific 

that mix with the subtropical turn of the Indian Ocean: that is the Tasmania Leak 

(Speich et al., 2002), less intense than ITF, and with less contribution to the formation 

of waters in the South Atlantic (given the color scale – represented in pink –, compared 

to the ITF blue in the Indian Ocean). 

Again, in order to study connections with the ITF and Circulation in the South 

Atlantic, the map in Fig. 4.6 shows the overlap of all trajectories connecting the ITF to 

the Agulhas Leak region, that is: once the initial conditions are given in the South 

Atlantic, on the SAMBA line, any trajectory observed in the North Pacific region (north 

of Australia on the map) must connect the two systems. It is possible to note aspects of 

the pathway descripted by the trajectories, which are maintained in the subtropical gyres, 

merging with the circulation of the Indian basin before finally being distributed in the 

South Atlantic, with variable depths. 

Fig. 4.7 shows the same map in terms of probabilities in a horizontal grid. When 

one considers only the trajectories that certainly connect the South Atlantic to the 

Pacific, the probability of finding a particle in the Atlantic is smaller when compared to 

the set of particles. Considering the integration of position of the particles being 

performed from the present to the past, then the particles must, for these trajectories, 

return to the Pacific. Likewise, the probabilities in the Indian Ocean are higher when 

compared to the total set of particles, since for the trajectories that connect the ITF to 

the LA, they must pass through the Indian Ocean. Darker points from the region south-

east of Africa to the coast of Indonesia trace the most likely places to find a particle. 

Also, one can see the decrease of the Tasmania Leak, which has little correlation  
.

time of simulation of the analysis CMS_18.3 

with these specific trajectories. 

An area of high probability density is revealed in Fig. 4.7 for the Agulhas Leak 

region, since all the particles (once sown in the South Atlantic) must pass through, to 

have come from the North Pacific Ocean. In addition, the recirculation of these particles 

around this region, traveling with the anticyclonic vortices, the so-called “rings” of the 

Agulhas, make it a likely region of observation. 

An aspect that must be studied for the simulation CMS_18.3 is the vertical 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 73 
 

structure of the trajectories, since it is the only experiment that considers the vertical 

movement of the particles. If there were no vertical movement, the mean value of the 

depth of the set of trajectories should remain constant and equal to the initial condition. 

But it is not what runs him. Figure 4.8 illustrates this behavior, showing a variation of 

100 m in the mean depth over time, if only the trajectories linking the three ocean basins 

are considered. 

For the open ocean, far from the boundaries and the surface, one can expect a 

baroclinic behavior, and three-dimensional flows traveling on surfaces of constant density 

(isopicnals), which usually are not parallel to the surface, leading to changes in the depth 

of each particle, and changing the ensemble's average pattern over the time. 

Moreover, the histogram of Fig. 4.9 shows that there are among the trajectories 

that connect the Needle and ITF Systems a predilection for greater depths when 

compared to the set with all trajectories: it is more likely to observe the entire set of 

trajectories between 0 and 150 m depth, between the trajectories that connect the two 

systems, the probability is greater between 50 and 200 m depth. 

 

FIGURE 4.8 | Evolution of the mean depth of the conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL, over the 
time of simulation of CMS_18.3 

Furthermore, Fig. 4.10 shows that when we consider only trajectories in which 

the depth remained above 100 m for the entire period, only two of these trajectories are 

those that cross the Indian Ocean and link the ITF to the South Atlantic.

FIGURE 4.11 | Average behavior of the conjunct of trajectories connecting ITF and AL: colors represent the 
mean depth of the whole ensemble, being closer to the surface when traveling over in the Indian Ocean basin, 
considering the simulation CMS_18.3. 

And if we consider a mean fictitious trajectory, considering the average of the 

horizontal and vertical positions of the trajectories that connect ITF and AL, we see the 

behavior which is shown in Fig. 4.11, where mean shallower depths of 100 m are revealed 

during the average trajectory trajectory within the Indian Ocean basin when compared 

to the mean depths in the horizontal positions corresponding to the South Atlantic and 

North Pacific Oceans. 

An analysis of the simulation time, counted as days before the initial conditions 

(given in the course of the year 2015), that each trajectory takes to actually be observed 

in the Pacific, passing through the ITF, shows in Fig. 4.12 that the highest probability 

is that the trajectories are only observed in the ITF region at the end of the simulation 

time series between 5500 and 7800 days (15-20 years). This means that the trajectories 

remain most of the simulation time confined, first, to the subtropical South Atlantic swirl 

and then to the Indian basin before finally being found in the Indonesian region. A time 

of 10 to 30 years was also found by Durgadoo et al. (2017) so that ITF waters left the 

Indian Ocean basin through the Agulhas Leakage in a similar Lagrangian analysis. This 

result and those of Figs. 4.10 and 4.11 are in accordance with the graph of Fig. 4.8, which 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 76 
 

shows: greater depths for short simulation times, what means they are closer to the initial 

conditions – (Atlantic basin); smaller depths for average times - Indian Ocean; and, then 

again, larger depths for the final simulation times: ITF region and North Pacific Ocean. 

This means that although the flow through the ITF is primarily superficial, 

dynamic processes in subsurface directly influence the system and model the 

characteristics of the masses of water that will be transported from one basin to another. 

A more precise analysis for this hypothesis would be to consider the interpolation of 

parameters such as density, temperature and salinity of the particles along the trajectory. 

Although CMS was designed to perform this activity, none of the temperature data we 

provided in all experiments with the CMS were correctly interpolated, returning values 

close to zero for the entire geographic distribution.

System, considering the conjunct of trajectories that connect both regions in the simulation CMS_18.3 

4.4 CMS_19.1 

The initial conditions of this simulation are as close as possible to the simulation 

CMS_18.3. But, in this case, particles were released every month in the course of the 

year 2012, on the line 34.5°S, with some difference in the initial depths, as described in 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 77 
 

Eq. (7): {0, 4, 0, 25, 25, 50, 70, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 

900, 1000}. 

Although the temporal resolution of data availability for velocity fields is greater, 

we maintained the integration step in 6h and results written in 1-day frequencies for 

comparison purposes. The Expt. 19.1 does not provide prediction for the vertical 

component z of the velocity. So, even if we consider initial conditions at different depths, 
the CMS integrates a purely horizontal displacement keeping the depth constant. In the 

open ocean, predominantly baroclinic, such an analysis may not be adequate. 

This simulation evaluated the movement of particles between the surface and 

1000 m depth, considering the largest time series continuously available for Expt. 19.1 

with HYCOM GLBu0.08, which goes from November 28, 1996 to December 31, 2012. 

Data prior to November 1996 are not complete and have not been used. 

As the data in Expt. 19.1 do not bring values for the vertical component of the 

velocity field, and we did not consider stochastic terms of vertical diffusivity, the particles 

are advected horizontally and remain at the same depth for the entire simulation period. 

Fig. 4.13 shows the overlap of all trajectories obtained. 

Although it has a total of 5 years less than the time considered in the CMS_18.3 

experiment, the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.13 can be compared. Like those in Figs. 4.5 and 

4.14. In the Atlantic basin of the map it is possible to note a meridional transport of 

particles, where is shown the northern portion of the Atlantic Ocean present on the map 

much less dense in the CMS_19.1 simulation than in the CMS_18.3. In the Indian, the 

same can be observed, with the trajectories concentrated below the equatorial line, 

making in general the trajectories for the simulation CMS_19.1 are mostly confined to 

the subtropical region. In the small portion of the North Pacific that is presented in the 

extreme northeast of the maps, Figs. 4.13 and 4.14 show a flow of particles moving in 

the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand (marked in red in Figures 4.13 and 4.14) 

which are not verified in the maps of Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. These flows converge to the ITF

region in the Java and Flores seas, flowing into the Indian Ocean, representing an unlikely 

path, according to the literature (eg Gordon &amp;amp; Fine, 1996; Lee et al., 2010) and the 

preliminary ITF studies that we have shown in past reports with the Eulerian Expt. 

18.3. 

One of the properties of ITF is to modify the characteristics of incoming water 

masses from the Pacific Ocean via, among other means, different vertical flows that alter 

the density, temperature, and salinity of these waters before they could be exported to 



LAGRANGIAN ANALYSIS 79 
 

the Indian Ocean basin. An analysis like the CMS_19.1, for which the OGCM velocity 

fields do not allow such vertical flows, and where we did not impose stochastic terms on 

the Lagrangian code that could simulate vertical displacements (via diapycnal diffusion, 

for example), it is probable that the trajectories are not conveniently representing the 

prediction that the outputs of the HYCOM GLBu0.08 model from Expt 19.1 are in fact 

providing. 

Still qualitatively, Figs. 4.6 and 4.7 can be compared to the maps of Figs. 4.15 

and 4.16 and show, respectively, the overlap of the set of all the trajectories that connect 

the ITF to the South Atlantic and the probability distribution per grid cell to observe a 

particle belonging to this set at any time in the simulation period . With noticeable 

difference from the results of the CMS_18.3 simulation, Figs. 4.15 and 4.16 show 

trajectories connecting the three ocean basins through flows that, as already mentioned, 

pass to the northwest of the island of Brunei, coming from the South China Sea with 

great recirculation and probabilities of observations (marked in red in Fig. in contrast to 

the flows across the Makassar Strait that should be most likely (marked on the yellow 

arrow). The waters leave the ITF by straits that are not representative for the flow, such 

as the Singapore Strait, and a small shallow passage to the west of Jakarta. In the Indian 

Ocean, trajectories weakly join the subtropical gyre, but rather, similar to a meandering 

zonal flow, propagate westward to the east coast of the African continent, and rapidly 

join the Agulhas System, which transmits all trajectories to the South Atlantic, without 

representing the retroflexion of the Agulhas Current, which could take the particles back 

to the Indian Ocean circulation, merging the particles back to the subtropical gyre of 

this basin. 

Fig. 4.17 shows a plot of the probability distribution of the average depth of the 

trajectories, considering the complete set of Lagrangian particles and only the set of 

trajectories that connect ITF and AL. The distributions of the histogram occur in peaks 

of values, since the depth of each particle remains constant throughout the movement.

greater depth for the connection trajectories in relation to the whole ensemble, in this 

simulation CMS_19.1 the particles collected in the South Atlantic and that certainly

the set of all the trajectories considered. 

This is another indication of the inadequate representation of three-dimensional 

flows without considering the vertical displacements that are part of the dynamics of

5 | CONCLUSION 

An implementation of HYCOM in a global, eddy-resolving resolution experiment 

was used to study the Indonesian Throughflow. Output data of the run forced with 

climatology of atmospheric data have been utilized to study the ITF structure, mean 

paths for horizontal flow and seasonal variability. The fluxes on surface and the mean 

path of inflow and outflow are represented satisfactorily. However, the deep flow in 

Lifamatola passage is not in accordance to the INSTANT data. 

The ITF volume transport has been estimated for surface flows, in the upper 

700 m depth. Results have shown the seasonal ITF variability is mostly driven by the 

monsoon winds system that acts on the region. A maximum flow is observed when winds 

blow in the same direction of the ITF superficial outflow path, between June to 

September. The values of volume transport estimated for the surface are in accordance 

with INSTANT data and other works. 

Using the output data of the run forced with atmospheric fields varying on years, 

it was possible to study the interannual variability of the ITF. A response to ENSO 

events is being well represented by the model. El Niño and La Niña events cause the ITF 

transport decrease and increase, respectively. Analyzing each ITF’s strait individually, 

was also possible to verify the response of each region. 

The ITF heat transport has been estimated in the upper 700 m depth. Both 

volume and heat transports present a small trend of increase, in the whole time series, 

but it seems not to be related to real changes in the system. 

Anomalies in the heat transport for three different periods of the time series have 

been studied in order to understand the representation of HYCOM concerning the abrupt

increase of heat content within the Indian Ocean during the global surface warming 

slowdown. Between 2001 and 2012 the simulation with HYCOM shows a strong change 

in the surface heat transport of the ITF, increasing the amount of energy carried from 

the Pacific to the Indian Ocean in the same period. This could help explaining changes 

in the heat content within the Indian Ocean and also corroborate the hypothesis that 

correlates the phenomenon with the global warming hiatus. 

However, another period, between 1991 and 1995 revealed that the ITF is getting 

stronger one decade earlier than the beginning of the hiatus, and other events could be 

correlated for that, like the Pinatubo volcanic eruption that happened in 1991. The fact 

is that the Indian Ocean is being more active than in the past and its connection with 

the Pacific Ocean is becoming weaker. 

In addition, the analysis of the ITF heat transport in the last three years of the 

experiment shows a strong correlation to Nino3.4 Index and an evident response to El 

Niño event, where the increase before observed in the ITF heat transport now is 

converted in a hard decrease. Further analysis should be considered concerning the state 

of Indian Ocean’s heat content after 2012, and the ITF for beyond the year 2015. 

The experiments with HYCOM demonstrate good representation concerning the 

ITF structure and its variability. Once it has been used a global implementation, other 

systems can be studied in order to find further correlations. A global eddy-resolving 

resolution can permit, for example, to analyze the coherence of the ITF with Agulhas 

leakage and a better understood of the global MOC and its importance in the global 

climate system and in the recent climate changes. 

Numerical experiments of Lagrangian analyses for the flow represented by 

different runs of the OGCM. The goal of this additional effort was to establish a 

numerical tool that could be used in future studies that consider output of forced ocean 

models and of coupled ocean-atmosphere models, looking for contributions concerning 

the ITF and the AL circulation patterns, net transports, and their variability in different 



CONCLUSION 84 
 

timescales. 

The outputs of 2 different runs were used to carry out the main investigation of 

the ITF variabilities and to force different test-experiments simulating the backward 

motion of virtual Lagrangian particles from the South Atlantic Ocean. Then, the 

computed pathways can be used to describe qualitative and quantitatively the flow 

parcels connecting ITF to the South Atlantic Ocean, carried by the Agulhas rings and 

the Indian Ocean circulation. 

 

5.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK 

Until now, the experiments performed using CMS and PARCELS allowed us to 

a fully understanding the methodology once proposed. 

That allows to evaluate volume and heat transport through the ITF and the 

Agulhas Leakage using the Lagrangian data that will be compared with transports 

evaluated in the Eulerian frame. 

As a natural continuation of the present work, it is suggested that an evaluation 

of changes and variability of the ocean heat budget in the Indian Ocean and in the South 

Atlantic Ocean be performed in the global warming hiatus period, considering possible 

correlations with the ITF and the Agulhas Leakage. 
Changes and variability of water masses exchange can be computed. Eulerian 

fields from a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model could help to establish correlations 

with these changes by tracking the flow, the forcing winds and climate events associated. 

 

 



 

APPENDIX A 
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATE SYSTEMS 

In this work, two coordinate systems have been referred and used, for example, 

in the estimates of transports. This appendix proposes to explain the notation and 

definitions adopted. 

Any fixed point in an approximately spherical Earth can be described by a 

position vector {, represented in terms of angular components of a geodetic coordinate 
system:  

 { = &amp;amp;|? + )}? ? ?~? (A-1) 
where:  

à &amp;amp;  is the longitude, for 180°W =  ? 180° ?  &amp;amp; ?  + 180° =  180°E  and 180°W ?  180°E, defined as the azimuthal angle in the east-west direction 
measured from the prime meridian (&amp;amp; = 0), typically, the Greenwich Meridian; 

à ) is the latitude, 90°S = ? 90° ? ? ? + 90° = 90°N, defined as the polar angle 
measured in the south-north direction from the equator () = 0); 

à ? is the vertical downward distance from the Earth’s surface (? = 0), [?] = m; 
à |? is the eastward pointing unit vector;  
à } ?is the northward pointing unit vector; 
à ~? is the upward pointing unit normal vector to the Earth’s surface. 

Once the angular components &amp;amp; and ) are usually given in degrees, they can be 
efficient for locating points in space, but do not work friendly with other physical 

properties given in conventional units. Thus, a metric coordinate system may be defined. 

If the position vector written in these new coordinates is  ? = 4l? + 6m? + ?? ? (A-2) 
defined by the transformation: 



 86 
  4(&amp;amp;, )) = 78 ( 9180°) &amp;amp; cos ) (A-3)  (&amp;amp;, ), ?)   ?     6()) = 78 ( 9180°) ) (A-4)  ? = ? (A-5) 
where: 

à 78 = 6.371 × 106 m (A-6) 
 is the mean radius of the Earth considered approximately spherical; 

à 4 is the eastward arc length related to the angle &amp;amp; measured from latitude ), [4] = m; 
à 6 is the northward arc length related to the angle ), [6] = m; 
à ? is the depth, measured vertically downward from the Earth’s surface; [?] = m. 

The unit vectors are related to each other system as:   l? = |? ;  m? = } ?;  ? ? = ? ~? (A-7) 
The system of coordinates (4, 6, ?) is usually called quasi-Cartesian, and an 

element of volume in space can be simply described for these coordinates as: 

 5V =  54 56 5? ?  [?3] (A-8) 
If 5 ? 0, then:  d4 = 78 9180° cos ) d&amp;amp; (A-9)  dV = d4 d6 d?  ?      d6 = 78 9180° d) (A-10)  d? = d? (A-11) 
where dx and dy are infinitesimal line elements of the arc lengths in the eastward and 

the northward directions, respectively, while dz is an infinitesimal downward distance. 

If instead of continuous, the geographical space was discretized into + × - × A 
fixed-points located at  {'(@ = (&amp;amp;'(, )'(, ? ?@), (A-12) 
where i,j are indices of a horizontal grid and k of a vertical grid in which those points 

were placed, then  ?'(@ = 4'(l? + 6'(m? + ?@? ? (A-13) 
is the position vector in the quasi-Cartesian coordinates, where: 

   

   



 87 
  4'((&amp;amp;'(, )'() = 78 ( 9180°) &amp;amp;'( cos )'( (A-14)   (&amp;amp;'(, )'(, ?@)  ?   6'(()'() = 78 ( 9180°) )'( (A-15)  ?@ = ?@ (A-16) 

An independent field evaluated in the spherical-geodetic coordinates must be the 

same for the corresponding position in the quasi-Cartesian coordinates, i.e., if ? = {(?) 
and { = ?({), then the scalar field ? that represents a property of the fluid must be:  ?(?, F) = ?({, F) (A-17) 
The analog is valid for a vector field, considering the point unit vectors:  ?(?, F) = ?S(?, F)l? + ??(?, F)m? + ?? (?, F)? ? =  = ?({, F) = ?S({, F)|? + ??({, F)}? ? ?? ({, F)~? (A-18) 
 

 

   



 

APPENDIX B 
EULERIAN AND LAGRANGIAN REPRESENTATIONS OF 
THE GEOPHYSICAL FLUID FLOWS 

The Newton’s Second Law of motion stablishes that the net force acting over a 

moving particle is the responsible for the time variation of the particle’s linear 

momentum, in other words:  ? ?? ? = ddF (?N) = ? d2?dF2 + d?dF d?dF  (B-1) 
where: 

à ? ?? ? is the net force; 
à N = d?d? is the velocity vector; 
à d2?d?2 = ? is the acceleration vector; 
à m is the mass of the particle; 

à t is the instant of time. 

However, this statement is only valid for an inertial referential, a physical 

concept defined by the Newton’s First Law. To describe a movement in terms of the 

Newton’s Second Law in a non-inertial referential, the case of an observer placed in a 

rotating system, for example, inertial forces must be added to the dynamics. Physically, 

those forces do not exist, but they are felt by whatever is moving following a non-inertial 

frame. Thus, if N is measured at position ? by a fixed observer placed somewhere in a 
rotating system, the Eq. (B-1) can be given, for m constant on time, as: 

 1? ? ?? ?  =  [ ddF + ? × ] [( ddF + ? × ) ?]  =  [ ddF + ? × ] (N + ? × ?)  =  =  dNdF  +  2? × N +  ? × (? × ?)  +  d?dF × ? (B-2) 
where: 



 89 
 

à ? is the position vector with coordinates system fixed in the rotating frame; 
à N = d?d? is the velocity measured in the rotating frame; 
à ? is the angular velocity of the frame;  
à ? × ? is the linear velocity of the rotating frame itself at position r; 
à d?d?  is the variation in time of the velocity measured in the rotating frame; 
à 2? × d?d?  is the acceleration due to the Coriolis inertial force; 
à ? × (? × ?) is the acceleration due to the centrifugal inertial force; 
à d?d? × ? is the acceleration due to the Euler inertial force, that is zero if ? does 

not vary on time. 

For each single constant mass parcel of water that moves in the ocean with 

velocity v measured at some point on the Earth, rotating with constant angular velocity ?, there will be accelerations due to the sum of forces that can drive the Eq. (B-2) to 
set up the form of the Navier-Stokes Equation:  DNDF + 2? × N = ? 1t ¡D + ¢ + £t ¡2N (B-3) 
where: 

à N = N(?, F) is the Eulerian velocity field, at position ? in the instant t;  
à D = D(?, F) is the pressure field;  
à t = t(?, F) is the particle’s density field; 
à £ = £(?, F) is the dynamic viscosity; 
à ? = ?(?) is the gravitational potential; 
à ? ¥v¦  is the Pressure Gradient Force per unit of mass; 
à ¢ = ? ¡? ? ? × (? × ?) is the Gravity Force per unit of mass; 
à §¦ ¡2N describes frictional forces per unit of mass; 
à and the material derivative, is defined as:   DDF ? ??t + N ? ¡ (B-4) 

The Eq. (B-3) describes the fluid in terms of fields, and each property is 

evaluated at a desired fixed point ? in space by an also fixed observer placed somewhere 



 90 
 
in the Earth. This approach for characterizing the geophysical fluids is known as the 

Eulerian description, and assumes a continuous or discrete space. 

On the other hand, instead of analyzing the motion at arbitrary positions, the 

Lagrangian description considers the referential frame following the flow by representing 

the entire fluid as a sufficiently large number of indivisible particles (but not molecules), 

and evaluating the system state along the pathway, or, the trajectory, of those parcels 

of fluid. A complete Lagrangian formulation for the Earth’s Ocean, therefore, provides a 

continuum description by tracking every single parcel of sea water in the world. 

For a simpler discrete Lagrangian representation of the flow, consider a finite ª  
set of «  different particles with constant mass ?(¬ ), for ª = 1,2,3, … , « . If each particle 
represents only one fluid parcel, the motion described by Eq. (B-2) can be written for 

each particle as:   1?(¬ ) ? ?(¬ )?? = [ ddF + ? × ] [( ddF + ? × ) ­(¬ )] = ( ddF + ? × ) (¯°(¬ ) + ? × ­(¬ )) (B-5) 
where:  ­(¬ ) = ­(¬ )(F) ? ?(²0(¬ ), F) (B-6) 
is the vector function that describes the trajectory of the single particle P along time t, 
that depends on its initial position ²0(¬ ) = ­(¬ )(F0) = ?(²0(¬ ), F0); 
and  ¯°(¬ )(F) ? ddF ­(¬ )(F) = D?DF ­(¬ )(F) = ´?F ­(¬ ) (B-7) 
is defined as the Lagrangian velocity of the particle P at the instant of time t, and it 

represents the velocity that is felt by that particle, and by an observer that is moving 

with the particle, at the instant t. 

If N(?, F) describes the velocity of the fluid at the position ? = ?(¬ )(F) in space 
with respect to a fixed referential frame, for an arbitrary instant t, from Eq. (B-3), (B-4) and (B-7), it can be seen that: 



 91 
  N(?, F)|?= ?(µ ) = ddF ???= ·(µ ) = ddF ?(²0(¬ ), F) = ddF ­(¬ )(F) ?  ¯°(¬ )(F) (B-8) 
Eq. (B-8) states that the Eulerian velocity v of the fluid evaluated at a fixed-point r in 

space is equal to the Lagrangian velocity ¯°, that is the velocity actually felt by the 
referential frame of the fluid parcel P that occupies that position in space at that instant 

of time. 

If the Eulerian velocity field N = N(?, F) is known, the pathways ­(¬ ) = ­(¬ )(F) 
for each particle P, representing a discrete set for the Lagrangian frame, can be computed 

from Eq. (B-3), (B-6) and (B-8): 

 ­(¬ )(F) ? ?(²0(¬ ), F) = ? N(?, F?)??0 dF? +  ²0(¬ ) (B-9) 
In Eq. (B-7), the operator:  D?DF ? ??t (B-10) 

is called the Eulerian derivative, that added up to the Lagrangian derivative (or also 

material derivative: the one that tracks the “moving material”) given by Eq. (B-4) 

constitute the transitioning connection between both descriptions. That enacts Eulerian 

and Lagrangian descriptions to be equivalent, but, in a practical way, they are also 

complimentary, once the choice for which one to employ should support the practical 

methodology or fits to the objectives, that could be focused on studying motions of the 

fluid that happens at (fixed) desired positions or limited space or on tracking specific 

flows from some initial position.
