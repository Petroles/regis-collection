INTRODUCTION

Loss of an eye due to tumor, trauma, or end-stage ocular disease is
devastating to persons of any age. Not only is there a loss of binocular
vision with reduced peripheral visual field and loss of depth perception
causing various job restrictions, but also a sense of facial disfigurement.
One’s self-image, self-esteem, and self-confidence may be affected. Be-
cause eye contact is such an essential part in human interaction, it is

Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in
enucleated socket with porous polyethylene
spherical and quad-motility implant

Keywords: Eye enucleation; Orbital implants; Eye, artificial; Polyethelene; Image processing,
computer-assisted/methods

Purpose: To compare artificial eye amplitudes in enucleated socket
with porous polyethylene either spherical or quad-motility implant
and study the characteristics of artificial eyes fit with the two orbital
implants. Methods: A total of 21 patients were prospectively studied
who underwent enucleation because of an intraocular melanoma and
the randomization defined a porous polyethylene either spherical or
quad-motility orbital implant. Measurements of the amplitude of the
artificial eye were obtained with prism and digital photos. The software
Scion Image analyzed the digital photos (www.scioncorp.com) and
the quantitative data were allocated to groups. The measurements
(height, length, thickness) and weight of the 21 artificial eyes were
analyzed. Student’s t-test was performed to determine the significance
of difference between groups (p&lt;0.05). Results: There was no sta-
tistically significant difference of the artificial eye amplitude analyzed
by means of prisms between both orbital implants (p&gt;0.05 for all
directions). On analyzing the digital photos, the artificial eye with
spherical implant showed higher artificial eye amplitude downward
(p=0.009) among patients older than 55 years old, rightward (p=0.036)
and downward (p=0.008) among the 9 patients with enucleated right
eye. Height and length were similar in the 21 artificial eyes but those
artificial eyes fit with quad-motility orbital implants were statistically
significant thicker (p&lt;0.001) and heavier (p=0.001). Conclusions:
The similar amplitude of movement of artificial eyes was observed
with both spherical and quad-motility orbital implants. Artificial eyes
fit with quad-motility orbital implant are significantly thicker and
heavier than those fit with spherical orbital implant.

ABSTRACT



Arq Bras Oftalmol. 2007;70(5):831-8

832 Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant

extremely important for the artificial eye patient to maintain a
natural and normal appearance with the prosthetic eye(1-3).

The ideal orbital implant should be able to correct the
orbital volume loss as well as maintain socket motility to
achieve maximum cosmesis with the use of prosthesis. In
addition, it should have low exposure and migration rates, be
economical, technically simple to implant, and applicable for
enucleation, evisceration or secondary orbital implantation(4).

Porous polyethylene (PP) is made of synthetic material
(high-density polyethylene powder), which is heated below
the melting point and molded into specific shapes (Medpor®;
Porex Surgical Inc., Fairburn, GA, USA)(5-6). Due to its good
molding, tissue tolerance, and stability, porous polyethylene
has been used in craniofacial reconstructive surgeries since
1982(5) and in enucleation implant since 1989(6). This material
has an extensive pore system that permits fibrovascular
ingrowths which has the advantage of preventing migration,
extrusion, and infection(6). Attachment of the extra-ocular
muscles to the implant in locations mimicking their normal
anatomical insertion sites optimizes implant movement
without increasing the incidence of exposure(7). Porous
implants should be used in those patients who express an
interest in later peg insertion, a procedure that primarily
improves the amplitude of horizontal prosthetic saccades(8).
By 2002, PP implants were the most frequently used after
primary enucleation (42.7%)(9).

Many shapes of orbital implants have also been deve-
loped: the buried implants, magnets, flat anterior surface,
tantalum mesh, protruding 4 mounds on the anterior sur-
face(4). PP implants are available in spherical, egg, conical,
and mounded shape (quad-motility)(9).

The placement of a peg or screw is often performed as a
second procedure several months after initial placement of
the orbital implant, but it has been associated with conjunc-
tival breakdown and exposure of the implant, chronic dis-
charge, pyogenic granulation formation, and conjunctival
overgrowth(10).

The results of a survey done with active members of the
American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery (ASOPRS) showed a decline in implant pegging,
only 8.1% of all the implants reported were pegged(9).

The motility of a nonintegrated artificial eye may be
caused by at least two forces: 1) the rubbing force between the
posterior surface of the artificial eye and the conjunctiva that
covers the implant may cause the artificial eye to move.
Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all
directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical
artificial eye amplitudes; 2) an artificial eye usually fits snu-
gly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior
fornix). During upgaze and downgaze, the upper and lower
eyelids move along with the eye (or implant), albeit with a
smaller amplitude. Consequently, the upper and lower forni-
ces also move upward and downward, and thereby contribute
to the vertical amplitude of the artificial eye. In contrast, the
medial and lateral canthi hardly move during horizontal eye

(or implant) movements. Therefore, the medial and lateral
conjunctival fornices probably move much less than the
upper and lower fornices(11).

The quad-motility implant (Medpor®; Porex Surgical Inc.,
Fairburn, GA, USA) is a rounded orbital implant with four
mounds located anteriorly. The anterior mounds provide pro-
jections in the Tenon capsule and conjunctiva that allow
coupling of the implant with the ocular prosthesis without
penetrating the conjunctiva. These mounds also may partially
support the weight of the prosthesis, thereby reducing the
amount of weight being supported by the lower eyelid and
fornix, which often leads to lower eyelid droop(4).

The quad-motility implant is available in three sizes: small,
medium, and large, approximating the volume of a 16-, 18-,
and 20- millimeter sphere. The spherical implant is available in
four sizes: 16-, 18-, 20-, and 22- millimeter of diameter(4).

Synchronous simultaneous movements of the two eyes in
the same direction are called versions. The versions fulfill the
first two tasks assigned to the motor system of the eyes: to
enlarge the field of view and to bring the object of attention
onto the fovea. In this study, prisms were used to evaluate the
prosthesis motility based on voluntary version as the patient’s
only eye was looking to an object located at 1 m of distance.
Prisms are able to evaluate the artificial eye amplitude in the
central visual field.

To digitalize one image means to give space value (x; y)
and the light to the points (pixels) that makes the figure. The
image can be analyzed by a specific program that, manipu-
lating mathematics of the pixels, allows to analyze the mar-
gins and make the measurements of any parameter(12). Digital
photos were taken of each patient in the ocular primary
position and at the four main gazes to evaluate the artificial
eye amplitude in the external visual field.

In normal individuals there is an age-related decrease in
extra-ocular muscle function. Aging anophthalmic patients
should exhibit a gradual loss of large-amplitude prosthetic
movement, while the animated small-amplitude excursions
are preserved. The motility benefits of pegged hydroxyapatite
may thus become less significant with advancing age(13).

To evaluate the current assumption that quad-motility
orbital implant yields better artificial eye motility than sphe-
rical orbital implant, we compared the amplitude and the
characteristics of the artificial eye in patients who randomly
received either quad-motility or spherical porous polyethy-
lene orbital implant. Prism and digital photos were a quan-
titative method to analyze the artificial eye amplitude.

METHODS

Patients

Patients from the oncology sector of the Department of
Ophthalmology of the Federal University of São Paulo, who
underwent enucleation because of an intraocular melanoma,
without extrascleral extension on ultrasound examination,

Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant 833

were eligible for the study. We excluded patients with a low
visual acuity in the remaining eye and patients with a history
of strabismus, any eye surgery, or orbital disorders.

A total of 21 patients were eligible for this study. During
the surgery, 11 patients received the spherical implant and 10
patients received the quad-motility implant (Figure 1).

The age of the patients ranged from 31 to 80 years. The
patients were separated into two groups: under and over 55
years old.

Randomization

The type of implant was selected immediately before sur-
gery by opening an envelope with a previously randomized
assignment. The surgeon did not perform the amplitudes of
the artificial eye recordings. Until after the artificial eye
recordings, the investigators who recorded the eye amplitude,
as well as the patients, were unaware of the type of enuclea-
tion implant.

Surgical technique

The same surgeon made the 21 surgeries. The patient
entered the operation room with a skin mark on the forehead
showing the side of the surgery. Enucleation was performed
as follows: 1) 360° peritomy, blunt dissection of conjunctiva,
under Tenon’s capsule and between the rectus muscles; 2) the
four rectus muscles were identified with a squint hook and cut
from the eye after a 5-0 polyglactin double-armed suture
which was passed just posterior to each tendon; 3) the optic
nerve was cut with curved scissors; 4) disinsertion of both
oblique muscles during the eye removal; 5) hemostasis with
finger pressure; 6) implant inserted in the orbit with an
implant introducer (the four mounds of the quad-motility
implant were located anteriorly); 7) the four rectus muscles
were directly sutured on the surface of the orbital implant
with 5-0 polyglactin suture; 8) the two oblique muscles were

left untagged; 9) the anterior surface of both implants was
wrapped with autogenous tissue (deep temporalis fascia); 9)
Tenon’s capsule and conjunctiva were closed in separate
layers with 6-0 polyglactin; and 10) temporary tarsorrhaphy
with 4-0 silk.

An algorithm has been developed to determine the appro-
priate locations for the reattachment of the four rectus mus-
cles (Table 1) on the spherical implant(7). The reattachment of
the four rectus muscles on the quad motility was done on the
margin of the tunnels among the four mounds.

Follow-up

At the first postoperative visit, the bandage was changed.
The second postoperative visit was scheduled 3 days after
surgery. At that visit, the bandage and the temporary tarsor-
rhaphy were removed. The socket was inspected and the
patient used topical antibiotics drops four times a day until the
30th postoperative day. The third postoperative visit was 2
weeks after surgery and the conjunctival suture was removed
under topical proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%.

Six weeks after the surgery, the patients were referred to
the ocularist to fit the artificial eye. The anterior surface of the
artificial eye was made based on the contralateral eye (color
of iris, color of sclera, size of pupil) and the posterior surface
was made with mold of impression.

The patients returned to the clinic after six weeks for mea-
surements of the amplitude of the artificial eye, which were

834 Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant

obtained with a prism and digital photos for primary position,
horizontal and vertical movements. The prosthesis was mea-
sured using pachymetry (height, length and thickness) and
digital balance (weight).

Artificial eye amplitude recordings

Prism was placed in front of the eye and the fixation point
was located at one meter. The observer noted the eye and the
artificial eye movements. The prismatic dioptria was increa-
sed until no improvement in artificial eye motility. The smal-
lest prismatic dioptria that showed the best artificial eye mo-
vement, was considered the result.

Photos were taken with digital camera (Sony, Cyber-shot,
3.3 mega pixels) in the primary position and four extreme
gaze positions. A standard millimeter ruler was placed close
to the artificial eye. The software Scion Image (www.scioncorp.
com/scion_image_windows.htm) was used to analyze the pho-
tos, with a standard way of measurements of the five photos
(Figure 2).

Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was performed with EPI INFO, Ver-
sion 6.04. Quantitative data for groups (enucleated eye, age
and orbital implant) and artificial eyes are presented as mean
and standard deviation(14). Student’s t-test was performed to
determine the significance of differences among groups. The
criterion for significance was p&lt;0.05.

RESULTS

Demography

Of a total of 21 patients eligible for this study, 11 were
male (52.4%) and 10 were female (47.6%). The age of the
patients ranged from 31 to 80 years (mean, 55.3 years), 9
patients being younger than 55 years old and 12 patients older
than 55 years old.

Were enucleated 15 OD (71.4%) of which 6 received quad-
motility orbital implant and 9 received spherical implant.
Among the 6 enucleated OS (28.6%), 4 received quad-motility
orbital implant and 2 received spherical implant.

The group who had been fitted with quad-motility orbital
implant consisted of 10 patients, 6 males and 4 females. Six
patients had the implant in the right orbit and four patients had
the implant in the left orbit. The size of the implants was 16 (4
cases), 18 (4 cases) and 20 (2 cases).

The group who had been fitted with spherical implant
consisted of 11 patients, 5 males and 6 females. Nine patients
had the implant in the right orbit and 2 patients had the
implant in the left orbit. The size of the implants was 18 (6
cases) and 20 (5 cases). Size 16 of the spherical implant was
not used in this study.

right and left enucleated eyes, the results are shown separated
by enucleated eye.

Implant motility appears to decline with age(13) and lower
eyelid laxity may decrease the prosthesis motility, because
we divided the patients into two groups: younger than 55
years and older than 55 years.

Prisms were used to evaluate the central area of the pros-
thesis motility and digital photos analyzed the four main
extreme gazes.

Prism

The results of the artificial eye motility among the 15 right
enucleated eyes and the 6 left enucleated eyes are shown in
table 2. No statistically significant difference between the two
groups was found for all directions.

The results of the artificial eye motility among the 9
patients younger than 55 years and the 12 older than 55 years
are shown in table 3. No statistically significant difference
between the two groups was found for all directions.

The results of the artificial eye motility among the 11
spherical orbital implants and the 10 quad-motility orbital
implants are shown in table 4. No statistically significant dif-
ference between the two groups was found for all directions.

Digital photos

The results of the artificial eye motility among the 15 right
enucleated eyes and the 6 left enucleated eyes are shown in

table 5. There was a statistically significant difference bet-
ween the two groups for downward (p=0.008) and rightward
(p=0.036) in the 15 right enucleated eyes. No statistically
significant difference was found for the other directions.

The results of the artificial eye motility among the patients
under and over 55 years are shown in table 6. There was a
statistically significant difference between the two groups

836 Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant

downward (p=0.009) for patients over 55 years. No statis-
tically significant difference between the two groups was
found for any other direction.

The results of the artificial eye motility among the 11
spherical orbital implant and the 10 quad-motility orbital
implant are shown in table 7. There was a statistically signi-
ficant difference between the two groups rightward (p=0.036)
and leftward (p=0.036) for patients with spherical orbital
implant; leftward (p=0.038) for patients with quad-motility
orbital implant. There was no statistically significant differ-
ence between the two groups for the others directions.

Artificial eyes measurements

Height and length of both orbital implants are similar.
Artificial eyes with quad-motility are thicker (p&lt;0.001) and
heavier (p=0.001) than the artificial eyes with spherical or-
bital implants (Table 8).

DISCUSSION

Soares studied patients with anophthalmic socket for an
average follow-up period of 12.5 years. Analyzing the re-
sults, he could infer that volume and motility are factors that
prevent the contractional process of the anophthalmic socket.
The study leads to this conclusion, reinforcing that in order to

avoid cavity contraction it is necessary to perform a primary
orbital implantation in cases of evisceration or enucleation. It
is possible to achieve a good final result by the use of a
technically well-fitted artificial eye(15).

Some details of the surgical technique for all patients in
this study seem to improve the cosmetic results. The four
rectus muscles were directly sutured on the surface of the
quad-motility and spherical orbital implant. Other authors
have used the same technique(11,16-17), although others have
reattached the six muscles(7).

Anderson and co-authors advanced the four extraocular
muscles over the front of the implant by suturing the medial
and lateral rectus muscle together in the horizontal channel of
the implant and suturing the superior and inferior rectus
muscles in the vertical channel(4). We believe that this sutu-
ring extraocular muscle procedure will block the orbital
implant motility. In this study, the suture of the extraocular
muscles in the quad-motility was done at the respective mar-
gin of each channel. There was no difference of location of
the four extraocular muscle sutures in the quad-motility or-
bital implant like it happens in spherical orbital implants.

The anterior surfaces of both orbital implants were co-
vered with a patch of autogenous material (deep temporalis
fascia). A comparative study of bovine pericardium versus
homologous sclera as wrapping for hydroxyapatite orbital
implants showed a significantly higher incidence of exposure
with bovine pericardium(18). The use of banked sclera as a
patch may potentially contain human immunodeficiency
virus(19) or other infectious agents(20). Temporalis fascia as a
patch graft has several advantages. The procedure is safe and
may be performed in the same surgical field. As it is an
autologous graft, there will no be immunological reaction.
There is no risk of disease transmission. The temporalis fascia
is a sturdy fibrous tissue thick enough to cover the anterior
surface of both orbital implants but thin enough to be con-
cealed, pliable, and easy to work with(21). The placement of
unwrapped hydroxyapatite implants after enucleation pro-
vides essentially the same motility as wrapped implants(22).
The middle path sclera provides the combined advantages of
a wrapped implant (additional barrier of protection between
the rough surface of the implant and conjunctiva) and an
unwrapped implant (better and faster vascularization).

In our study, all patients were referred to the ocularist 6
weeks after surgery. At this postoperative time there was no
edema, no conjunctival inflammation or dehiscence. Some
authors studied early replacement of the conformer by an
ocular prosthesis. It was done in 12 enucleated patients, who
were pleased with the cosmetic benefit afforded by the early
introduction of the prosthesis(23).

To compare the motility of sclera-covered hydroxyapatite
and alloplastic enucleation implants, a retrospective, non-
randomized comparative trial was done with 76 anophthalmic
patients, who were examined less than 120 days after surgery.
Both orbital implants showed similar movement, although
directly coupling hydroxyapatite implants to the prosthesis

Artificial eye amplitudes and characteristics in enucleated socket with porous polyethylene spherical and quad-motility implant 837

via the motility peg, provided enhanced prosthetic move-
ment. There appears to be no motility benefit of nonpegged
hydroxyapatite over spherical alloplastic implants(24).

By the methodology used in this study, the patients were
examined with the artificial eye and the amplitude of mo-
vement of the artificial eye was analyzed by two methods: (1)
prism and (2) computer program Scion Image. A more detai-
led statistical analysis was performed of this subset of vertical
(up and downward) and horizontal (right and leftward) move-
ment. The enucleated eye was also considered, once right or
leftward are done with different muscles when the enucleated
eye is the right or the left one.

A randomized trial with the purpose of comparing artifici-
al eye amplitudes in patients who received either a hydroxy-
apatite or an acrylic, sclera-covered spherical implant after
enucleation showed that, when no motility peg is placed,
acrylic and hydroxyapatite spherical implants yield com-
parable saccadic amplitudes of the artificial eye. However,
saccadic symmetry did not differ significantly between the
acrylic group and the hydroxyapatite group (p&gt;0.1 for any
saccadic direction). Artificial eye amplitudes were markedly
more restricted horizontally than vertically. In all saccadic
directions, the relation between target amplitude and artificial
eye amplitude was linear(11).

Larger implants seem to provide improved implant moti-
lity, which should result in more dramatic prosthetic move-
ment. Several factors must be considered in choosing the
appropriate size of implant for a particular patient. Exces-
sively large implants may increase the risk of extrusion, make
prosthesis fitting difficult, or result in patient discomfort.
Ideally, sufficient space must remain in the socket to allow
fitting of prosthesis with at least 2 ml of volume and approxi-
mately 4 mm central thickness(25). In this study, the central
thickness of the artificial eye fitted with spherical orbital
implant had a mean of 4.5 mm, but with quad-motility orbital
implant had a mean of 7.68 mm.

Some authors found that shell volume was broadly related
to shell weight, though neither measurement was related to
cosmetic result. Those patients without orbital implants had a
mean shell weight of 3.1 g, as compared with 2.8 g in those
with implants(26). The patients of this study, with spherical orbital
implants had a mean artificial eye weight of 1.79 g, as com-
pared with 2.69 g in those with quad-motility orbital implant.

Implant motility appears to decline with age(13). This was
demonstrated by our study and it is the reason why patients
were divided into two groups of age: younger and older than
55 years, based on the mean age of the 21 patients. In a group
of patients younger than 55 years old, there was no difference
of artificial eye amplitude for any gaze. In a group of patients
older than 55 years, there was statistically significant diffe-
rence only downward (p=0.009), with spherical orbital im-
plants showing better results.

To evaluate the eyelid position before and after the exter-
nal prosthesis adaptation, using digital image processing te-
chniques, 18 patients were evaluated at the “Faculdade de Me-

dicina de Botucatu - Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP”,
with and without the external prosthesis. Qualitative and
quantitative analysis were made using the Scion Image Pro-
gram. The image processing allowed objective evaluations of
the measures, contributing to the patient follow-up(27). This
was also observed in the measurements of this study, which
were adequate, simple and reliable in enucleated patients.

Because the image processing was done with extreme
gaze in this study, measurements of the prosthesis motility
were also obtained with prism, to evaluate central visual field
once, in conversational speech ocular movements are limited
to low-amplitude saccades within a few degrees of primary
position. While tracking objects, the eyes rotate only approxi-
mately 10º to 15º before head turn naturally occurs(27). In this
study, all results are higher than 15º and artificial eye motility
at the central visual field can be considered acceptable for
both orbital implants.

Isolated innervations to an extraocular muscle of the eye
do not occur, nor can the muscles from one eye alone be inner-
vated. Impulses to perform an eye movement are always
integrated, and all ocular movements are associated. Whene-
ver an impulse for the performance of an eye movement is
sent out, corresponding muscles of each eye receive equal
innervations to contract or relax. In enucleated patients, the
only eye is going to focus the object located at 1m of distance
and the orbital implant is going to follow the only eye. The
eyes move toward the apex of the prisms. If the prisms are
placed base-out in front of the eyes, they must converge; if the
prisms are placed base-in, the eyes must diverge. If the prisms
are placed base-up or base-down, the eyes must perform a
vertical movement. The only four main directions were eva-
luated in this study.

In this study, abduction of the artificial eye is significantly
better than adduction for both orbital implant. Others authors
compared outcomes of enucleation and evisceration. They
concluded that abduction of the orbital implant is also signi-
ficantly better than adduction in eviscerated eyes and implant
motility is greater than prosthesis motility(28).

The efficiency of transmitting movement from the implant
to the prosthesis determines the degree of the prosthetic mo-
tility. Movement is transmitted from orbital implant through
surface tension at the conjunctival-prosthetic interface and
movement of the fornices(25). The quad-motility orbital im-
plants have irregularly shaped surfaces that create indirect
coupling mechanism between the implant and prosthesis that
imparts greater movement to the prosthesis(4,25).

This study showed that spherical and quad motility orbital
implants yield comparable artificial eye motility, although
the artificial eyes fit with a quad motility orbital implant are
thicker and heavier.

rico e “quad-motility” e estudar as características das próteses
oculares adaptadas com os dois modelos de implantes orbitá-
rios. Métodos: Vinte e um pacientes foram prospectivamente
estudados após a enucleação devido a melanoma intra-ocular
e cuja randomização definiu o implante orbitário de polieti-
leno poroso nos modelos esférico e “quad-motility”. Medidas
da amplitude da prótese ocular foram obtidas com prisma e
fotografia digital. O programa Scion Image analisou as fotos
digitais (www.scioncorp.com) e os resultados foram distribu-
ídos por grupos. As medidas (altura, comprimento, espessu-
ra) e o peso das 21 próteses também foram analisados. O teste
de t foi realizado para determinar a significância da diferença
entre os grupos (p&lt;0,05). Resultados: Não houve diferença
significante na amplitude do movimento das próteses ocula-
res, analisada com a interposição do prisma em ambos im-
plantes orbitários (p&gt;0,05 em todas as posições). Ao analisar
a fotografia digital, as próteses adaptadas com implante esfé-
rico apresentaram maior amplitude de movimento na infra-
versão (p=0,009) para pacientes acima de 55 anos, infraver-
são (p=0,008) e dextroversão (p=0,036) nos nove pacientes
com o olho direito enucleado. Altura e comprimento foram
similares nas 21 próteses oculares. Próteses oculares adapta-
das com implante “quad-motility” foram significantemente
mais espessas (p&lt;0,001) e pesadas (p=0,001). Conclusões: A
amplitude de movimento das próteses oculares foi similar nos
implantes esférico e “quad-motility”. As próteses oculares
adaptadas com implante “quad-motility” são significante-
mente mais espessas e pesadas do que as adaptadas com
implante esférico.
