resumo 
 
 

Este trabalho foca-se no estudo das ocorrências de carbonatos autigénicos do 
Golfo de Cádis. A mineralogia, textura e valores de ?13Ccarbonatos indica que as 
diferentes litologias são formadas a partir de oxidação de metano que induz a 
cimentação dos sedimentos por precipitação de dolomite, calcite magnesiana, 
calcite e aragonite autigénicas. 
Os diferentes carbonatos autigénicos derivados de metano (CADM) ocorrem 
associados a vulcões e cones de lama, cristas diapiricas ou ao longo de falhas.
Dois grupos distintos de CADM foram descritos. Um grupo cuja mineralogia é 
dominada por dolomite e que ocorrem como crostas, chaminés ou nódulos, e 
um outro grupo com a mineralogia dominada por aragonite e que ocorrem sub 
a forma de crostas, pavimentos ou montículos, no fundo do mar. 
Os diferentes grupos de CADM reflectem diferentes ambientes geoquímicos de 
formação. Os CADM aragoniticos formam-se próximo da interface 
sedimento/água, enquanto que os CADM dolomíticos formam-se por 
cimentação ao longo de condutas por onde o fluido circulou dentro da coluna 
sedimentar em ambientes confinados relativamente à água do mar. 
A ocorrência destes CADM é interpretada como indicadora de extenso escape 
de metano na área do Golfo de Cádis. 
Biomarcadores indicadores de Archaea capaz de realizar oxidação anaeróbica 
de metano (OAM) e biomarcadores indicadores de bactérias sulfato-redutoras 
foram identificados nas amostras de CADM. Estes resultados, apoiados 
também pelas observações de microscópio electrónico e micro-texturas 
características dos CADM, confirmam um activo envolvimento microbiano na 
formação destes CADM. 
A composição isotópica destes CADM indica que na sua formação estiveram 
envolvidos fluidos intersticiais com um claro contributo de água resultante da 
dissociação de hidratos de metano. 
As idades de amostras representativas de CADM, calculadas pela análise de 
U/Th indica que estes carbonatos se formaram no decorrer dos últimos 250 ka, 
em períodos correlacionados com rápidas variações paleoceanográficas, como 
as terminações dos períodos glaciares.

abstract 
 

This work focus on the occurrences of authigenic carbonates in the Gulf of 
Cadiz. Mineralogy, texture and ?13Ccarbonate values clearly indicate that the 
different carbonate lithologies are methane-derived (MDAC), formed by the 
lithification of sediments as result of the precipitation of authigenic dolomite, 
calcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite. 
The MDAC are found associated with mud volcanoes and mud cones, diapiric 
ridges or along faults. 
Two distinct groups of MDAC were described in the Gulf of Cadiz. A group 
dominated by dolomite mineralogy (dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys) 
and a group of aragonite dominated carbonates (aragonite pavements, slabs, 
crusts and buildups). 
The different MDAC morphologic types reflect different geochemical formation 
environments. The aragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic 
carbonates at the sediment-seawater interface or close to it. The dolomite 
nodules, crusts and chimneys result from the cementation along fluid conduits 
inside the sediment column, in more confined geochemical environments. 
The widespread abundance of MDAC is interpreted as an evidence of several 
episodes of extensive methane seepage in the Gulf of Cadiz. 
Specific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers indicating archaea involvement in the 
anaerobic oxidation of methane and bacterial lipid biomarkers also 13C-
depleted and related to sulphate reducing bacteria were both identified on the 
MDAC. These results, substantiated by SEM observations and by microbial 
related microfabrics, confirm that microbial activity has played an important role 
in carbonate authigenesis. 
Considering the minimum and maximum temperature limits admitted to be 
possible to occur in the Gulf of Cadiz, some of the MDAC samples indicate a 
formation from 18O-enriched pore fluids, interpreted as resulting from a 
contribution of dissociated gas hydrates to the pore waters from which the 
authigenic carbonates were formed. 
The estimated U/Th ages of selected dolomite chimneys indicate episodes of 
intense precipitation of the authigenic carbonates, at least during the last 250 
ka, that correlate with periods of rapid paleoceanographic changes as the 
onsets of glacial/interglacial terminations.

this model, the upper boundary of methane hydrates is concordant with the sulphate-methane interface 
(SMI) and gas hydrates can only outcrop in the centre of a pockmark if the upward flux of methane is 
strong enough (Gay et al., 2006c). 26

al., 1996; Duplessy et al., 2002) and that the entire sealevel scale is 125 m (Fairbanks and Matthews,

Chapter 1.  Introduction 
 

 

1.1 Nature and scope of this research 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located south of Iberia, in an area where a broad spectrum of 

geological processes of global importance are active. These include: (1) the tectonic 

evolution of the Africa-Iberia plate boundary; (2) the formation of the Gibraltar orogenic 

arc; (3) various sedimentological and oceanographic processes related to the Mediterranean 

Outflow; (4) the formation and dissociation of methane hydrates and associated deep water 

ecosystems; (5) the widespread occurrence of mud volcanism and methane-derived 

authigenic carbonates. 

The return flow and the impact of volatiles (especially methane) and other fluids at 

continental margins such as the Gulf of Cadiz, where sediment and sedimentary rock 

sequences of a continental crust with a thicknesses of 11 to 30 km are observed (Medialdea 

et al., 2004) have complex effects on the geosphere, biosphere, ocean and atmosphere, and 

are high priority objectives in present day geosciences. Sediment compaction and 

geochemical processes during diagenesis are responsible for the major fluid input into the 

sedimentary basins and subduction zones, together with the alteration products of the 

oceanic crust and the trench-fill from down-slope mass wasting. The output of the volatile 

phases from the sedimentary pile is done via fluid venting at the deformation front of 

accretionary complexes, together with widespread mud diapirism, mud volcanism, cold 

seepage and gas hydrate dynamics. These volatile phases are either ejected into the 

biosphere, ocean and atmosphere, accreted to the edges of continental plates or transported 

into the lower mantle. 

This work focuses on the study of fluid escape structures and processes in the South 

Portuguese margin and the Gulf of Cadiz. It aims to contribute to a better understanding of 

the nature, structural control and the characteristics of the fluid escape structures in the 

Gulf of Cadiz. It is especially focused on the study of the methane-derived authigenic

carbonates associated with modern and fossil methane seepage in an area of extensive mud 

volcanism. The gas hydrates occurrence, formation and dissociation, the tectonic 

implications and significance of the fluid escape structures are also investigated. 

Gas charged sediments, revealed by acoustic blanking zones and acoustic turbidity, 

surface and buried pockmarks and acoustic anomalies in the water column have been also 

identified and described in the central eastern continental shelf and upper slope areas of the 

Gulf of Cadiz (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza et al., 1999). Both were interpreted as 

indicating active fluid escape in this region. 

In 1992, during the Kane cruise, organized by the Marine Physics Branch of the 

Naval Research Laboratory, USA (NRL) in cooperation with the Hawaii Mapping 

Research Group and the Naval Oceanographic Office, a high quality side-scan sonar 

mosaic was acquired for a large part of the slope, upper and lower continental rise of the 

central part of the Gulf of Cadiz. This coverage revealed a large number of structures that 

were inferred to be mud volcanoes (Gardner, 2001; Gardner, 2002). In 1999, during the 

Training Through Research Cruise (TTR09), ground-truthing in some of these structures 

retrieved gas charged mud breccia and confirmed their mud volcanic nature (Gardner, 

2001). 

Since 1999, a strong effort has been made by several scientific research teams to 

investigate the fluid escape processes in the Gulf of Cadiz, and several Portuguese and 

international projects have focused this topic in this area. The research presented in this 

thesis was developed in the framework of the INGMAR (PLE/4/98), the Training Through 

Research program (IOC/UNESCO – Moscow State University), and the MVSEIS -

Euromargins (01-LEC-EMA24F) projects. The INGMAR project (“Reforço da 

Capacidade de Investigação no Domínio da Geologia Marinha”, Sub-project: Geology 

and resources of the Portuguese Margin) was developed at the Marine Geology 

Department of the Geological and Mining Institute, now National Institute of Engineering, 

Technology and Innovation, I.P. (INETI) with financial support from the Fundação para a 

Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) and was coordinated by one of the supervisers of this thesis 

(L. M. Pinheiro). The INGMAR project started in 1998 with the objective of investigate 

the geology and the resources of the Portuguese margin and finished in 2003. The 

UNESCO-IOC Training Through Research (TTR) program employs an innovative concept 

that directly interlinks two major components: scientific research and education. This

program provides to students advanced training in marine science, from the phases of data 

collection, processing, laboratory analyses and, ultimately, the presentation and publication 

of the research results, under supervision of senior top researchers from several European 

top research institutions. The Euromargins/Eurocores programme project MVSEIS 

“Tectonic control, deep crustal structure and fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz 

mud volcano field” started on June 2003 and integrates Portuguese, Spanish, Belgium and 

French teams under the coordination of the Portuguese team (L. M. Pinheiro). The 

Portuguese work package has been founded by the Portuguese Science Foundation - FCT. 

The objective of the MVSEIS project is to investigate the deep crustal structure, the 

sedimentary section and sediment dynamics, the tectonic control and the detailed geometry 

of the fluid escape pathways in this area with active mud volcanism and cold seeps, using a 

multidisciplinary approach. The multidisciplinary approach gives the opportunity to link 

the tectonic, sedimentological, geochemical and biological processes associated with the 

mud volcanism and gas seepage. 

 

 

1.2 Geographical location and physiography of the study area  

 

The study area of this work corresponds to the South Portuguese Margin and the 

Gulf of Cadiz (Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2). It is delimited by the parallels 34º45’N and 

36º45’N and by the meridians 6º25’W and 10ºW. The water depth in the study area ranges 

from 200 m to 4000 m. It corresponds mainly to the upper and lower continental slopes 

and the uppermost part of the Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains in the South Iberian 

Atlantic margin and the North African Atlantic margin of Morocco. 

The morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by a complex tectonic 

structure with an accretionary wedge (Gutscher et al., 2002) and olistostrome complex 

emplacement (Maldonado et al., 1999) that results in a wide development of the 

continental slope and rise in this area. 

The northern continental margin of the Gulf of Cadiz extends from the Gibraltar 

straight, to the West of Tarifa, until Cape Saint Vicente. The southern continental margin 

of the Gulf of Cadiz extends from Tangier to North of Casa Blanca, to the on-land 



 

Chapter 1. Introduction

prolongation of the Rharb Valley that defines the southern limit of the Accretionary wedge. 

In this continental margin several sectors can be defined, with different shelf, slope and 

rise characteristics. These characteristics are controlled by tectonic, diapiric and 

sedimentary/erosive processes related to slump processes and related to the strong effect of 

the outflow of the Mediterranean Water (MW) on the seafloor. 

The continental shelf in this area has a variable width but it is in general fairly wide 

(ranging from 10 to 50 km) with the exception of the Gibraltar strait where it is less than 8 

km wide. The slope of the continental shelf (out of the Gibraltar strait area) can reach up to 

0.5º, but it is flatter (0.3º) in the Moroccan and Spanish margins. The shelf break occurs at 

depths ranging from 100 to 200 m. In the Portuguese margin it is located at about 130 m 

except offshore Faro where it is found at about 100 m water depth. To the West of Faro, in 

the Spanish margin, the depth of the shelf break is located between 140 and 150 m 

diminishing again to the South of Cadiz (Vanney and Mougenot, 1981).

The Gulf of Cadiz slope and rise are the physiographic domains in which this thesis 

is focused on. They are characterized by an irregular seafloor morphology shaped by active 

sedimentary and tectonic processes. The South Portuguese margin to the West of Faro is 

characterized by the presence of several incisive canyons that shape this sector of the 

margin. To the East of Faro, the Spanish and Moroccan margins are characterized by the 

accretionary wedge/olistostrome complex domain. The upper slope, between 130 and 400 

m water depth, is narrow and characterized by depositional processes related to the 

prograding edge of the continental shelf break, erosive processes related to the canyons and 

channels, gravitational structures related to slumping processes, tectonic processes 

revealed by recent fractures and diapiric processes, gas-charged sediments and fluid escape 

structures as pockmarks (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996). The middle slope, from 400 to 1200 m 

water depth, is characterized by its large extension except in the South Portuguese margin, 

in the Portimão and Faro Canyons area, where it is narrower. It is characterized by the 

strong erosive/depositional influence of the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) with large 

contourite deposits and erosive channels (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003). The central part 

of this area is characterized by the presence of important ridge systems associated with 

diapiric structures with a preferential NE-SW direction and by the occurrence of mud 

volcanoes and other fluid escape structures that are frequent in this domain (Figure 1.2). 

The lower slope, ranging from 1200 to 4000 m water depth, shows a large extension on the 

accretionary/olistostrome domain but, on the South Portuguese margin West of Faro, in the 

sector dominated by the presence of canyons, the middle and lower slopes are narrower. 

The dominant seafloor morphology within the accretionary domain is characterized by the 

presence of small-scale bottom features such as mini-basins, some of them with polygonal 

shapes, mud volcanoes and salt diapirs. The Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains have flat 

seafloor morphologies. The Horseshoes Abyssal Plain is limited to the North by the 

Gorringe Bank and to the South by the Ampere and Coral Patch seamounts which, together 

with the Coral Patch Ridge define the northern limits of the Seine Abyssal Plain. In the 

East, both abyssal plains are limited from the continental rise by scarps. The Horseshoe 

Abyssal plain is limited to the East by the Horseshoe fault that delimits a domain of the 

foot of the rise that has a gentle and constant slope, limited to the East by the accretionary 

wedge deformation front scarp. The Seine Abyssal plain is limited by the accretionary 

wedge deformation front scarp (Figure 1.2).

1.3 Main objectives 

 

The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate the fluid escape structures in the 

Gulf of Cadiz, related to the formation of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) 

and to contribute to a better understanding of their nature, characteristics and occurrences. 

The characterization of these fluid escape structures, their evolution and significance on 

the regional geology, their impact on the biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere were also 

addressed, as the tectonic and sedimentary control on the fluid escape processes and 

manifestations. The specific scientific objectives of this thesis are: 

1. To identify and to describe the morphology and characteristics of the fluid escape 

structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, especially the occurrences of MDAC and to 

investigate their possible structural control and their relationship with major fluid 

escape structures; 

2. To identify the various types of MDAC observed in the study area and to 

characterize their mineralogy and geochemistry, in order to establish the main 

physical, chemical and bio-geochemical processes involved in their formation; 

3. To investigate the role of hydrocarbon-rich fluid venting in the formation of the 

MDAC; 

4. To investigate the role of microbial consortia on the anaerobic oxidation of 

methane and the precipitation of the MDAC; 

5. To determine the age and growth rates of the MDAC; 

6. To identify any major episodes of formation and to correlate them with past 

climate changes and eustatic sea-level fluctuations; 

7. To propose a model of formation for the different MDAC. 

 

 

1.4 Database 

 

The database for this PhD Thesis consists of data collected largely by the author 

from 14 scientific cruises: TTR09, TTR10, TTR11A, TTR11, TTR12, TTR14, TTR15, 

TTR16, Anastasya-2000, Anastasya-2001, GAP, Cadipor, Matespro and Delila (see details

in Appendix A). During these cruises a large dataset was collected in the Gulf of Cadiz, 

including seismic lines (that were added to the previous existing seismic dataset), side-scan 

sonar data (both surface and deep-towed), heat flow, multibeam bathymetry, underwater 

video observations and a large number of sediment and rock (mud breccia clasts and 

MDAC) samples, from gravity cores, dredges and grabs. A description of the different 

geophysical data, its acquisition parameters and processing, and a description of the sample 

collection and underwater video observation equipments are presented in Appendix A. For 

this thesis, about 2700 km of seismic reflection profiles were used, together with more than 

2700 km of ecosounder profiles, 58422 km2 of low resolution side-scan sonar, and 578 km2 

of high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar. Multibeam bathymetry data from 5 surveys 

was used for the construction of regional and detailed bathymetric 3D models. 331 

sampling stations (including gravity cores, TV-grabs and dredges) and 70 underwater 

video observation profiles were used to constrain the nature of seafloor and sub-seafloor. 

 

 

1.5 Methodology 

 

All the data collected in the Gulf of Cadiz, relative to geophysical investigations, 

video observations and retrieved samples, was integrated into a Geographic Information 

System (GIS) database. The positioning of all the data acquisition operations was 

calculated and integrated on the GIS database, together with information relative to the 

acquired data and subsequent analytical results. This allowed the analysis and 

interpretation of all the georeferenced data and the investigation of relationships between 

the different datasets. The GIS database allowed the location, characterization and 

interpretation of the fluid escape structures morphology, elaboration of 3D models and 

map production. GIS analyse tools applied on the database were used to investigate the 

spatial relationships between the different fluid escape structures and the geological, 

tectonic and oceanographic settings. 

To identify and characterize the different types of MDAC and to establish their 

formation processes, the different samples were described in hand-specimens, under 

binocular and by thin section petrographic and cathodoluminescence microscopy. The

mineralogy was determined and quantified by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis 

(total carbon content, total organic carbon and carbonate content). Carbon and oxygen 

stable isotopic composition of selected samples where also determined as the strontium 

isotopic compositions of the representative MDAC types. 

Based on the mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the MDAC, the 

nature of the hydrocarbon-rich diagenetic fluids involved in their formation was 

investigated and estimated together with other environmental properties (temperature of 

formation and geochemical setting). 

The presence and the active role of microbes involved in the formation of the MDAC 

was interpreted based on the mineralogy, texture and microfabric of the carbonates, as 

investigated on petrographic microscopy, complemented with cathodoluminescence 

characterization and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The active role of microbial 

consortia on the anaerobic oxidation of methane and precipitation of the MDAC was 

investigated by stable carbon isotopic composition of the different carbonate phases and by 

the determination of the presence of characteristic biomarkers with diagnostic depleted 

carbon isotopic composition. 

The U/Th dating method was used to define the age of formation and growth 

velocities of selected MDAC samples. Their age determinations allowed to estimate the 

processes potentially involved in their formation, as the climatic changes and eustatic sea-

level fluctuations. This method was the one that fitted to the geochemistry of the formation 

environment and on the estimated time range of the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz. 

The different analytical methods and techniques are reported and described in more 

detail within the different chapters, according to their use. 

 

 

1.6 Thesis outline 

 

The first chapter presents an introduction to the nature and scope of this research, 

describes the main objectives, the database and the methodology used. This is followed by 

a brief outline of the thesis chapters. 



 

Chapter 1. Introduction 

 

 10 

The second chapter presents a review of the state of the art and the global 

significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins. 

The third chapter introduces the geological and oceanographical setting of the study 

area. The geodynamic setting, the present day seismicity and stress pattern, and the 

tectonic regime are then described followed by a short discussion of the nature of the 

accretionary prism/olistostrome complex. Next, the paleogeographic and geodynamic 

evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz and the geology of the Betic-Rifean Domains and adjacent 

basin are described, as well as the morpho-sedimentary domains in the study area. This 

chapter concludes with a description of the present day oceanographic setting of the study 

area, with a particular focus on the importance of the Mediterranean Outflow Water on the 

seafloor morphology and sedimentary dynamics. 

In Chapter four the characteristics and the distribution of the MDAC occurrences in 

the Gulf of Cadiz are analyzed and correlated with the other fluid escape manifestations 

and associated structures (mud volcanoes, diapiric ridges and faults). This includes the 

interpretation of the underwater video profiles and the correlation of the observations and 

samples retrieved with the geophysical and bathymetric data. A cartography of the MDAC 

occurrences was produced and the evaluation of the sedimentological and tectonic 

processes that potentially can control the occurrence of the MDAC and cold seeps in the 

Gulf of Cadiz are discussed. 

Chapter five presents the petrographic, mineralogical, geochemical, isotopic and 

lipid biomarker studies performed on the MDAC samples collected in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

Based on these data, together with the macroscopic sample description and the underwater 

video observations, a model for the formation of the different authigenic carbonates is 

proposed. 

Chapter six presents a detailed carbon and oxygen stable isotopic study of the 

MDAC and a reconstruction of the original pore water composition from which the 

different carbonate minerals precipitated. 

Chapter seven describes the results of the dating of selected samples of MDAC and 

their interpretation. A link between MDAC formation and the corresponding fluid flow 

episodes are correlated with past oceanographic conditions and eustatic sea-level changes 

in the Gulf of Cadiz.

MDAC are investigated, based on textural microscopy interpretation, electron microscopy 

observations and on biomarker analyses. 

Finally, Chapter nine presents a summary of the main conclusions presented in the 

different chapters, integrated on a regional setting. The thesis concludes with a list of 

questions that could not be covered in this work and new and open questions that arose 

during this research.

continental margins 

 

 

2.1 Mud volcanism and mud diapirism 

 

2.1.1 Introduction 

Mud volcanism, or sedimentary volcanism, as defined by (Kugler, 1933, 1975) is a 

worldwide and common geological process. It refers to a series of sedimentary processes 

that result in the episodic extrusion to the surface or to the seafloor of a sedimentary 

mixture of gases, water and solid material (mud and clasts) originated from deep sources in 

the sedimentary column (Higgins and Saunders, 1974). Different mud volcanic structures 

can be defined (Brown and Westbrook, 1988; Brown, 1990). Mud volcanoes (MVs) are 

defined as conical shape positive morphological features in relation to the regional 

topography, with a central feeder chimney or conduit and extrusive features such as mud 

flows. The mud mounds and mud ridges are defined as positive morphological features, 

with conical shapes but, without any central feeder chimney or extrusive features at the 

surface (Brown and Westbrook, 1988). Therefore, the MVs are formed when a mud rich 

material with clasts and other fluids reaches the seafloor or the surface, where extrusive 

features (such as mud flows, craters, gryphons, mud pools or salses) will be formed. The 

shale or mud diapirs are formed like the mud volcanoes by the intrusion of mud rich fluids 

through the sedimentary column that can possibly reach the surface, but unlike the mud 

volcanoes, the mud diapirs are characterized by a slow intrusion and ascension of the 

material. In the case of the seafloor-piercing mud diapirs, called mud mounds or mud 

cones, there will be an absence of the extrusive features that are present on the mud 

volcanoes. In this work the mud cone terminology will be preferably used to name mud 

volcanic structures that were not positively confirmed as mud volcanoes. The difference

plate settings 

 14 

between the mud cones and mud volcanoes is therefore revealed by their surface 

expression. The mud cones show, like the MVs, superficial conical shape morphologies 

but, unlike MVs, they do not exhibit extrusive features such as mud flows, craters or 

gryphons. 

The material extruded from the MVs is composed of a fluidized mixture of sediments 

dominated by clays, liquids and gases that, in general, incorporates rock fragments (clasts) 

pulled up from the pierced sedimentary sections. This mixture called a diapiric melange, 

argille scaliose or, more commonly, mud breccia (Cita et al., 1981). The mud breccia is 

composed of a clayish matrix (that can be up to 90% volume) that can contain exotic rock 

fragments, called mud breccia clasts, that present a variable lithology, size and shapes, 

which depends of the nature of the original source layers from where they were pulled up 

by the piercing of the mud volcano (Ivanov et al., 1996). 

Several morphologic elements can be defined on the MVs, such as the mud flows, 

crater and flanks, the surrounding moat, gryphons, mud pools and the feeder channel. The 

extrusion of the mud breccia at the surface produces the characteristic out-flowing masses 

or mudflows (Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2C). Depending on the viscosity of the material, the 

mud flows can be elongated and can travel long distances; if the mud breccia material is 

more viscous, it will produce short mud flows that in general are deposited at a short 

distance from their extrusion point (Figure 2.1B). The stacking of successive mud flows, 

generally produces topographic conical elevations of variable sizes and shapes, analogous 

to the morphology and activity of igneous volcanoes and therefore these features are called 

MVs. If the extruded material is very fluid, as a result of high amount of water, then there 

will not be an edification of a conical structure with steep flanks, and the formed edifice 

will preferably have a flat topography with low angle slopes. When the flanks are very flat 

(less than 5º), the structure is preferably named a mud pie (Cita et al., 1981). In general, 

the mud breccia extrudes from a central vent, the feeder channel, chimney or conduit, that 

connects the parent bed of the mud source (the deepest source of the material extruded) to 

the surface of the main crater, or to secondary craters (Figure 2.1). The crater corresponds 

to the superficial expression of the central chimney and in general corresponds to a 

depression that results from the post-activity episodes of stress relax and subsidence at the 

MV summit. To be noted that the crater can have a diameter that can be significantly larger 

than the diameter of the feeder channel. Mud extrusion can also occur from parasitic vents

or gryphons (Figure 2.2A, B and C) that can be located within the central crater or on the 

flanks of the mud cone edifice (Figure 2.1). At the central crater different types of features 

can occur. It is frequent the formation of gryphons, that correspond to meter size positive 

morphologic conical edifices from witch mud extrusion occurs; mud pools (Figure 2.2D) 

that correspond to depressions where soupy mud is extruded; salses, extrusion of high 

salinity solutions or brines forming pools in depressions.

(2002). Note the “Christmas-tree” structure indicating multiple episodes of mud extrusion. (B) Schematic 

map illustrating the radial pattern of mud flows accumulation away from the crater, modified from 

Rensbergen et al. (2005a). 

 

Some submarine mud volcanoes are characterized by the presence of a surrounding 

moat at their base. The moat corresponds to a depression that totally or partially surrounds 

the base of the mud volcano. The moat can be erosive in origin (consequence of the erosive 

effect of currents that contour the mud volcano); it can also result from the over-pressuring 

over the surrounding sediments, consequence of the overburden of the mud volcano 

edifice; alternatively the moat can be formed as consequence of the stress release after the 

mud volcano activity and edification; or can result from the collapse or depression of 

sedimentary layers as result of the remotion of sediments from the sedimentary layers 

under the mud volcanic edifice.

Mud volcano (MV) activity can occur at a wide range of scales, with eruptive cones 

ranging from some centimetres (Figure 2.2B) to hundreds of meters high (e.g. Toragai MV 

in Azerbaijan with 500 m high, Figure 2.2E) and several km in diameter, e.g. Al-Idrisi MV 

in the Gulf of Cadiz with 5.4 km wide (Rensbergen et al., 2005b). The MV mud flows can 

have decimetres to kilometres in length. Four types of MV activity have been recognized 

on land in Azerbaijan (State Oil of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), 1996; Fowler et 

al., 2000). These are: (1) Explosive activity, characterized by violent extrusion of large 

amounts of mud breccia with high amounts of mud breccia clasts and powerful flow of gas 

that spontaneously ignites producing explosions of variable strength; (2) Effusive activity, 

with the ejection of large amounts of mud breccia with or without less non-ignited gas 

emissions; (3) Effusive activity with the outflow of low viscosity mud breccias and without 

intense gas emissions; (4) Extrusive activity that corresponds to the slow extrusion of 

viscous mud with negligible emission of gas. Submarine MVs can have different activity 

characteristics but, most probably, episodes of powerful and rapid extrusion of large 

volumes of mud breccias possibly accompanied by gas release will alternate with quieter 

effusive episodes of fluidized mud breccia eruption with small amounts of gas. As 

illustrated in Figure 2.1, the different episodes can succeed over long periods of the MV 

activity and can intercalate with periods of MV inactivity (Graue, 2000). Fluid and gas 

emissions are commonly associated with MVs, but can also occur outside the mud edifice, 

along deep faults. These gases are expelled at localized venting sites, either as free gas in 

the case of terrestrial MVs (Figure 2.2E) or, in the case of submarine MVs as dissolved in 

pore waters, trapped as gas hydrates or as free gas (even in the gas hydrate stability zone 

gas can be preserved as free gas and not completely crystallized as gas hydrate). 

The mud volcano morphology is a function of its past activity and evolution, local 

lithology and of the tectonic framework of the host sediments. Therefore, there is no strict 

and universal classification for MVs but, based on the classification defined for land MVs, 

three types of MVs were defined by Kalinko (1964) and Dimitrov (2002), based on their 

morphology and eruptive activity. The Lokbatan type corresponds to MVs with frequent 

explosive activity, as a consequence of the rapid eruption of low viscosity mud breccias 

with abundant clasts and high amounts of gas. The morphology corresponds to well 

developed steep conical shapes. The activity episodes are short and alternate with longer 

periods of inactivity. Blocking of the feeder chimney by mud breccia clasts and high 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 18 

viscosity mud breccia is frequent, forming a mud cork and the fluid pressure increases 

below it. When the fluid pressure overcomes the resistance of the mud cork the MV retakes 

the activity with an explosive episode. Once the pressure is released the feeder chimney 

can be blocked again until the repetition of the process. This activity favours the 

edification of complex morphologies with secondary feeder chimneys and abundant 

gryphons. The Chikishlyar type corresponds to MVs with continuous and relatively weak 

and not violent extrusive activity. This type of MV is strongly affected by the presence of 

water saturated layers and in general forms numerous vents of gassy mud and water. They 

form very low or flat domes. The Schugin type corresponds to a transitional type of MV 

activity, with intermediate characteristics between the two previous types. The eruptive 

periods are replaced by weak activity. This type of MV is characterized by a great variety 

of forms, but most commonly they build composite craters. 

The submarine mud volcanoes are difficult to classify and not always fit the Kalinko 

(1964) classification types. However, some assumptions can be made, based on their 

morphology character such as the shape of the MV, the structure of the crater, the shape 

and characteristics of the mud flows, etc. (Ivanov et al., 1996). Recent activity episodes 

can be identified by several peculiarities, most prominent at the summit of the MV, such 

as: fluid emissions (visible as gas bubbling, water discharge, diffusive flux, gas hydrates 

presence); biological indicators (bacterial mats and chemosynthetic communities); 

geological indicators (carbonate build-ups of methane-derived authigenic carbonates, 

recent mud breccia at the seafloor); geophysical and geochemical anomalies (such as 

thermal anomalies, high geothermal gradient, pore fluid and pore water chemical 

anomalies). 

In the literature, several terms (diatreme, gas dome, mud lump, mud mound, mud 

pot, mud cone) have been proposed as synonyms for the different main mud volcanic 

structures: mud volcanoes, mud diapirs, seafloor-piercing mud diapirs and mud ridges. In 

this work, the term mud volcano will be used to identify mud volcanic structures that, as 

confirmed by ground truthing, are characterized by a the presence of mud breccia (that can 

be covered by a layer of pelagic sediments with variable thickness) and high fluid and high 

gas (essentially methane) contents, or the geophysical data shows without a doubt the 

extrusive activity of the MV (e.g. high backscatter mud flows). Structures that show 

geophysical and morphologic characteristics similar to MVs but were not sampled, or 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 19

where sampling did not clearly reveal the presence of mud breccia or high fluid and 

methane contents, are preferably classified here as mud cones. As such, mud cones 

correspond to either seafloor-piercing diapirs or to MVs (when they were not confirmed by 

sampling or sampling was not conclusive due to e.g. a thick pelagic sedimentary cover 

over a MV inactive for a long period of time). The mud diapirs are intrusive structures 

(emplaced during a longer span of time than the MVs) that on seismic profiles can exhibit 

mud volcanic similar seismic facies with acoustic chaotic reflection patterns but that do not 

reach the seafloor and pelagic sediment layers are identified on top of it or, if they are 

piercing to the seafloor they do not show evidences of extrusion of mud breccias or other 

extrusive features. 

 

2.1.2 Formation mechanisms 

Mud volcanism corresponds to the ascent of buried sediments as the result of density 

inversion or buoyancy forces (Brown, 1990) and pore fluids overpressure generated on 

buried sediments. The mud ascension and extrusion to the surface will occur whenever the 

pore fluid pressure exceeds the lithostatic pressure, causing hydraulic fracturing. The 

mechanisms through which buried sediments can ascend and form MVs are related with: 

(1) high pore fluids and gas pore pressures developed within the sedimentary sequences 

(Kugler, 1933; Ridd, 1970; Hedberg, 1974; Kugler, 1975; Milkov, 2000); (2) density 

inversions within the sedimentary sequences (Brown, 1990); (3) tectonic loading resulting 

from lateral tectonic shortening, accretion and overthrusting (Higgins and Saunders, 1974); 

(4) occurrence of diapiric structures or anticlinal folds and the occurrence of faults, along 

which the ascension and migration of fluidized sediments can occur (Brown, 1990). 

The development of the necessary high pore fluid pressure to induce the migration of 

the fluidised sediments can be reached as a result of several processes, some of them acting 

simultaneously, such as: (i) tectonic loading resulting from lateral tectonic shortening, 

accretion and overthrusting; (ii) sediment loading (resulting from high sedimentation rates, 

slumps, debris flows or overriding thrust sheets); (iii) diagenetic reactions of dehydration 

(such as smectite to illite and montmorilonite to illite dehydration (Brown et al., 2001) and 

opal A to opal CT diagenetic transformation); (iv) hydrocarbon formation and changes of 

phase of the hydrocarbons such as reactions of creaking of heavier hydrocarbons into 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 20 

lighter hydrocarbons; and (v) hydrothermal pressuring (Barber et al., 1986; Dimitrov, 

2002; Kopf, 2002). Fluidization and subsequent rapid flow of pore fluids through the 

sedimentary column can be reached through gas expansion, gas and water flux and 

shearing stresses (Brown, 1990). Over-pressuring of light, plastic, undercompacted fined-

grained layers from deeper sedimentary sections is the major factor for the formation of 

MVs. Most of these causes are closely related to each other and, in general, occur 

simultaneously. 

 
Figure 2.3. Schematic diagram illustrating the different basic mechanisms of formation of submarine MVs 

(from Milkov, 2000). (A) seafloor piercing shale diapir without a MV; (B) MV formed on top of a shale 

diapir; (C) seafloor seepage; (D1) MV formed by the rise of a fluidized sediments along a fault connected to 

an diapir; (D2) MV formed by the rise of a fluidized sediments along a fault directly connected to the mud 

source bed. 

 

Figure 2.3 illustrates the more frequent mechanisms of formation of MVs (Milkov, 

2000). Figure 2.3B corresponds to MVs formed directly on top of a seafloor-piercing mud 

diapir as consequence of fluid migration along the body of the diapir (e.g. Ivanov et al., 

1996). It should be noted that, during active diapiric stages, the increase of the tectonic 

pressure will favour MV generation (Rensbergen et al., 1999). 

The most common mechanism of the formation of MVs, corresponds to the rise of 

fluidized mud along faults and fractures (situation D1 and D2 in Figure 2.3). The mud 

breccias from these MVs are characterized by high fluid contents. The MVs can be 

connected with diapirs within the sedimentary sequence (case D1 in Figure 2.3) or they can 

be directly connected to the source layers (case D2 in Figure 2.3). Fluid migration plays 

the principal role in this mechanism and, in particular stages of the evolution of the system, 

when fluids (brine, water or gas) are the main or the only material to migrate, they will

produce at the surface not MVs but pockmarks, pockmark structures and methane-derived 

authigenic carbonates (case C in Figure 2.3). 

 

2.1.3 Detection of submarine mud volcanoes 

There are several methods used for the detection of submarine MVs. Direct methods 

include: (1) direct observations from a submersible, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or 

through underwater video or photo survey that allows the identification of mud breccia 

mud flows at the seafloor, and (2) sampling of the seafloor and retrieval of mud breccia 

sediment. Indirect methods include: (1) multibeam bathymetric characterization of the 

seafloor topography, which allows the identification of positive conical topographic 

features (MVs or mud cones); or in some high resolution bathymetric data it is sometimes 

possible to identify specific morphologic elements of the MVs, such as the crater, mud 

flows and moats; (2) side-scan sonar imagery, which is also a widely used method for the 

identification of submarine MVs, since the mud breccia is characterized by strong 

backscatter returns when compared with the normal seabottom pelagic sediments; (3) MVs 

are also detected by reflection seismics (single channel or multi-channel), as the MVs are 

characterized by having a positive expression and an acoustic transparent or chaotic 

acoustic facies on seismic profiles. 

 

2.1.4 Worldwide distribution 

Mud volcanoes are found worldwide, onshore and offshore, on continental shelves, 

continental and insular slopes and in the abyssal parts of inland seas (Figure 2.4). 

Estimated total number of known and inferred MVs have been put forward by several 

authors and range from 103 to 105 (Milkov, 2000), to approximately 1800 (Dimitrov, 

2002). And estimations of annual amounts of methane globally emanated through MVs are 

of the order of ~108 to 2x109 m3 (Kopf, 2002). The technical advances in marine 

geophysical equipment and the increase in deep-water exploration resulted in an increasing 

number of identified submarine MVs. In spite of the increasing number of underwater 

surveys, the amount of investigated Earth seafloor is still very sparse, and it is therefore 

probable that a very significant number of MV fields are yet to be discovered.

plate settings 

 22 

Mud volcanism occurs predominately at: (1) active margins, compressional tectonic 

settings and accretionary prisms; (2) passive margins associated with thick sedimentary 

sequences that have undergone rapid deposition and have become over-pressurized, such 

as in deep-sea fans; (3) associated with diapir formation several km bellow the seafloor; 

and (4) associated with hydrocarbon provinces, where the above mentioned processes of 

high pore pressure fluids generation dominate. 

 
Figure 2.4. Worldwide occurrence of mud volcanoes, modified after Kholodov (2002), Kopf (2002) and 

Judd and Hovland (2007); plate boundaries from Coffin et al (2000). 

 

Figure 2.4 shows a compilation of MV occurrences modified and confirmed from 

Milkov (2000), Kholodov (2002), Kopf (2002) and from Judd and Hovland (2007). It can 

be observed that, the MVs occur predominately in active margins, in regions of tectonic 

compressive settings, not only within the limits of the accretionary wedges but also at their 

toe. They also occur along the Alpine-Himalayan collision belt, extending from the Gulf of 

Cadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002, 2003; Pinheiro et 

al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Depreiter et al., 2005; Rensbergen et al., 2005a; 

Rensbergen et al., 2005b; Rooij et al., 2005) and the Alboran Sea (Perez-Belzuz et al., 

1997; Sautkin et al., 2003; Talukder, 2003), through the Mediterranean Sea (Cita et al.,

1998; Lavrushin et al., 2005), Azerbaijan (which has the biggest land mud volcanoes in the 

world (Hovland et al., 1997; Fowler et al., 2000; Aliyev et al., 2002), Turkmenistan and 

Iran, as far as into the Makran coast (von Rad et al., 2000; Wiedicke et al., 2001). They 

also occur along collisional zones in most parts of the Indian Ocean, such as the Indonesian 

Sunda fore-arc (Wiedicke et al., 2002), Sumatra, Borneo (Rensbergen et al., 1999), Timor 

(Teixeira, 1950; Gageonnet and Lemoine, 1958; Leme, 1968; Barber et al., 1986). They 

also occur in Taiwan and in the Nankai trench (Yamano et al., 1992; Kuramoto et al., 

2001) and in the Barbados accretionary prism (Westbrook and Smith, 1983; Brown and 

Westbrook, 1988; Henry et al., 1990; Le Pichon et al., 1990), in the Trinidad island, 

Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico (Higgins and Saunders, 1974) and in the southern Caribbean 

thrust belts (Reed et al., 1990; Vernette et al., 1992), as well as along the northeastern 

American coast (Orange et al., 1999). 

At passive margins, MVs are mainly associated with environments with high 

sedimentation rates, such as deep sea fans and deltaic systems, like the Niger delta (Graue, 

2000), in the Gulf of Mexico (Hovland and Judd, 1988; Prior et al., 1989; Sager et al., 

2003), in the Nile deep-sea fan (Mascle et al., 2001), in the Norwegian Sea (Vogt et al., 

1999), and in the Orinoco Delta, Eastern Venezuela (Aslan et al., 2001). 

As shown in Figure 2.4, MVs occur mainly in regions where hydrocarbons (oil and 

gas) have been or are actively generated, such as the Caspian Sea (Kopf, 2002; Huseynov 

and Guliyev, 2004; Yusifov and Rabinowitz, 2004), Trinidad (Higgins and Saunders, 

1974), Azerbaijan (Hovland et al., 1997), the Makran accretionary prism (Wiedicke et al., 

2001; Delisle et al., 2002; Schluter et al., 2002), the Caucasus, Indonesia (Barber et al., 

1986; Barber and Brown, 1988), the Carribean and the North Sea. 

The high number of modern MVs suggests that they should also be frequent in the 

geological record. In fact, some palaeo-cones are imaged at depth on seismic sections 

(Fowler et al., 2000), but MV descriptions in the geologic record are scarce. The re-

interpretation of some chaotic melange deposits, mixtures of blocks in a clay matrix, such

as melanges, olistostromes, submarine slumps or debris flow deposits showed that they 

were probably generated from mud volcanism related processes (Barber et al., 1986; 

Barber and Brown, 1988). However, the vulnerability towards erosion of these structures 

makes it difficult to preserve them through geological times. 

 

2.1.5 Global significance, potential interest and environmental impacts 

Mud volcanism, being a fluid escape process, has a significant role in degassing and 

dewatering of buried sediments (Kopf et al., 2001; Dimitrov, 2002); therefore, they 

contribute with an important parcel to the fluid and gas budget and in the geochemical 

cycle within the sedimentary basins and in the subduction factory (Kopf and Deyhle, 

2002). 

Influence on the global carbon budget 

Mud volcanoes are also a significant natural source for atmospheric methane, 

through massive episodic eruptions and dissociation of associated shallow gas hydrates. 

They have an important contribution and an important role on the world greenhouse gas 

budget and their quantification is of significant importance for the climatic change models 

(Dimitrov, 2003). 

A window to the deep sedimentary section and hydrocarbon potential 

As MVs bring materials originated within the sub-seafloor to the seafloor, they can 

give us direct and indirect information about processes occurring in the deep sub-seafloor 

(Ivanov et al., 1996). The study of the mud breccia clasts, since they correspond to rock 

fragments pulled up from deeper sections of the sedimentary column to the surface, they 

provide easy access to important information of the deep sedimentary sequences of the 

basin, namely on the composition, genesis, age and geochemistry of the sediments and 

processes occurring at depth e.g. Akhmanov et al.,(2003); Ovsyannikov et al., (2003). As 

most of the oil and natural gas production areas are associated with mud volcanism, the 

MVs were firstly interpreted and studied as direct indicators of hydrocarbon migration, 

providing information of the petroleum potential in the deep subsurface (Ivanov et al., 

1998; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006).

A window to the deep biosphere 

The sub-seafloor sedimentary layers harbour over half of all the prokaryotic cells on 

Earth (Whitman et al., 1998). Live sub-seafloor prokaryotes are found even in very old (16 

Ma) and deep (&gt; 400 m) sediments (Schippers et al., 2005) and they can have high activity 

rates and be active over geological timescales (Parkes et al., 2005). As MVs bring material 

from the sub-seafloor, they are also a window into the deep biosphere and related bio-

geochemical processes. They indeed represent an important deep biosphere habitat as they 

supply source energy (CH4 and HS-) that can fuel chemoautotrophic ecosystems. They can 

also transport faunal assemblages from the deep sub-seafloor. 

Geological hazards 

Submarine MVs are also important hazardous structures for seafloor operations and 

infrastructures. They can have a damaging impact on drilling operations, rig installations, 

pipelines and communication routings. 

Other scientific issues that can be addressed through the study of MVs are the role of 

fluid flow and hydrate dissociation in sediment stability, the interplay between microbial 

life and fluid seepage, and the dynamics of the gas hydrate system. 

 

 

2.2. Pockmarks 

 

Pockmarks are negative morphological structures, craterlike or cone shaped 

depressions at the seafloor, that are the expression of high fluid discharge (seepage) 

through a conduit (Figure 2.5). Seepage in the water column can be manifested by bubble 

streams and columns of coloured or shimmering water. As the migration of fluids through 

unlithified sediments has a relatively powerful erosive effect and pockmarks are features 

that record the erosive effect of seepage in suitable types of seabed sediments (Hovland 

and Judd, 1988). 

Pockmarks were described for the first time in the continental shelf of Nova Scotia, 

Canada, based on side-scan sonar imagery (King and MacLean, 1970); since then, 

pockmarks have been recognised not merely as morphologic features, but as indicators of 

dynamic geological processes of seepage of fluids at the seabed. The pockmarks occur in a 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 26 

wide variety of geological settings: on continental shelves, slopes, rises and in the deep 

ocean. 

Because pockmarks can be located relatively easily (inclusive buried pockmarks are 

detectable on reflection seismic records), while seepage activity is more difficult to detect, 

pockmarks are used as indicators of active or inactive seepage. In general, the pockmarks 

are generated by methane, of biogenic or of thermogenic origin, that seeps at the seabed. It 

is also possible that some pockmarks are caused by venting of destabilized gas hydrates or 

deep-earth originated gas, but their percentage in this case should be smaller, compared 

with the other fluid supplies, as both fluid supplies should be much less abundant.

periphery is dominated by sulphide-dependent Vesicomyidia-type fauna living on black reduced sediments 
and white bacterial mats. In this model, the upper boundary of methane hydrates is concordant with the 
sulphate-methane interface (SMI) and gas hydrates can only outcrop in the centre of a pockmark if the 
upward flux of methane is strong enough (Gay et al., 2006c).

2.3 Active hydrocarbon seepage 

 

The term seepage embraces a wide spectrum of fluid escape processes that occur on 

different geologic settings, both onshore and offshore. Seepage intensity ranges from the 

vigorous bubbling of gas (a gas macro seepage) to small scale emanation of microscopic 

bubbles, to water dominated fluids or hydrocarbon compounds in solution, detected only 

by geochemical instruments. Seepage activity can be continuous or episodically with short 

periods of activity between long periods of dormancy. 

The seeping fluids may be: (1) hydrocarbons (thermogenic or biogenic), that are in 

general dominated by methane and light hydrocarbons (as gas or dissolved), although 

seepage of heavier compounds can also occur; (2) hydrothermal or volcanic fluids; (3) 

groundwater; (4) fluids resulting from the decomposition of gas hydrates; and (5) deep-

earth gas (such as methane, carbon dioxide and some other compounds that could to be 

rising from deep within the Earth, according to the “deep-earth gas hypothesis” (Gold and 

Soter, 1980). 

The seepage of volcanic hydrothermal fluids is a common phenomenon at plate 

boundaries and at spreading centres on mid ocean ridges, where submarine volcanic 

eruptions take place and fluids originated by volcanic activity, modified through fluid 

circulation through volcanic and sedimentary host rocks, are expelled at elevated 

temperatures (up to 350ºC) representing positive temperature anomalies in relation to the 

ambient background temperature values (Corliss et al., 1979). The sites of active volcanic 

fluid seepage are called hydrothermal vents. 

Groundwater seepage occurs when migration paths, hydrostatic pressure and 

adequate aquifer recharge from land results in seepage of meteoric water at the seabed in 

areas close to land. Discharge of aqueous fluids resulting from the compaction of 

sediments can also be considered as groundwater seepage. 

In general, the occurrence of shallow gas, gas chimneys and gassy sediments are 

associated with cold seepage, gas hydrates, pockmarks or mud volcanoes. The shallow gas 

and gassy sediments are recognised on the seismic records by acoustic blanking, acoustic 

turbidity and enhanced reflectors (Hovland and Judd, 1988). 

The term cold seeps refers to the sites along convergent plate boundaries and passive 

continental margins, where near ambient bottom water temperature gas or fluids enriched 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 28 

in hydrocarbons reach the seafloor. This term is defined in opposition to the hydrothermal 

seepage or hydrothermal vents, where the seepage fluids are characterized by positive 

temperature anomalies in relation to the ambient seawater. 

 

2.3.1 Cold seeps: Definition and characteristics 

Different types of fluids with different hydrocarbons can be expelled at cold seeps: 

light hydrocarbons, as free gas or dissolved (that in adequate pressure and temperature 

conditions can for gas hydrates); heavier hydrocarbons, such as oil; water dominated 

brines; and saline brines. Liquid oil seepage, accompanied by light hydrocarbons dissolved 

or as gas, occur in general associated with oil reservoirs e.g. Gulf of Mexico (Aharon et al., 

1992; Sassen et al., 2003). The leakage of the oil into the water column and into the 

surface waters produces oil slicks that can be observed at the sea surface (Kornacki et al., 

1994; MacDonald et al., 2002). Oil and heavier hydrocarbon seepage, campaigned by 

asphalt or producing asphalt as result of their oxidation, as observed in the Campeche 

Knolls in the southern Gulf of Mexico, can result in lava-like flows of solidified asphalt 

associated with oil seepage, gas hydrates and authigenic carbonates (MacDonald et al., 

2004; Hovland et al., 2005a). These asphalt flows are colonized by chemosynthetic 

tubeworms and bivalves. 

Methane is the dominant hydrocarbon at the majority of cold seeps, in general 

accompanied by smaller quantities of CO2, H2S and heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane, 

propane, butane and pentane (Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988). Methane is 

the second most abundant compound in the sediments (after water) and the global flux of 

methane in the sediment column can have significant importance to the biosphere, 

hydrosphere and to the atmosphere. Large amounts of methane are produced in marine 

sediments but most of it is consumed within the sediments and does not reach the bottom 

waters or the atmosphere. Methane seeps are places where high flux of methane reaches 

the seabottom and sustains ecological systems and particular geological features. 

Three different origins can be considered for methane: microbial, thermogenic or 

abiogenic. Microbial methane is generated by bacterial anaerobic decomposition of organic 

matter at low temperatures within the sediments in the anaerobic methanogenic zone, such 

as the thermophilic metanogens fermenting VFAs or reducing CO2/formate coupled with 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 29

H2 oxidation (Thauer, 1998). The methanogenic zone is supposed to extend over the first 

1000 m below surface (Whiticar, 1999) or even deeper (Ivanov, personal communication). 

Thermogenic methane is generated by thermo-catalytic breakdown of organic matter 

(kerogen) at high temperatures and pressures (of about 110ºC) and is usually accompanied 

by heavier hydrocarbons. Abiogenic methane can be generated by chemical reactions such 

as clay metamorphism, abiogenic reduction of CO2, CO or formate with H2 (Lollar et al., 

2002), hydrothermal alteration of sedimentary organic matter (Des Marais et al., 1981), 

Fischer-Tropsch reactions in aqueous solution at elevated temperature (390ºC) in the 

presence of metallic catalysts, which is common during the serpentinization and 

hydratation of ultramafic rocks (Lollar et al., 1993; Foustoukos and Seyfried Jr., 2004), 

methane generation can also be mediated by deep hydrothermal processes (Hensen et al., 

in press; Nuzzo et al., Submitted); and, according to the “deep-earth gas hypothesis”, 

methane derived from the mantle, where it was an original component of the accretion 

Earth (Gold and Soter, 1980). 

Thermogenic, abiogenic and, to some extent, biogenic hydrocarbons have to migrate 

vertically along the sedimentary column from the source rocks and reservoirs to the 

seafloor. Gaseous hydrocarbons C1 to C6 are the most mobile and methane having the 

smallest molecular size, is the most mobile and can reach the surface more easily (Hovland 

and Judd, 1988). The methane reaching the upper part of the sediment column is in general 

oxidized anaerobically as described in the section bellow. 

 

2.3.2 Methane oxidation and main biogeochemical processes in cold 

seeps 

The flux of methane from the sediments to the atmosphere is controlled by the 

microbial-mediated process of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). AOM is identified 

as a major sink of methane (Reeburgh, 1980) and it also accounts for a substantial fraction 

of sulphate reduction in marine sediments and in anoxic waters. The identification and 

quantification of the mechanisms by which methane is being oxidized in natural 

environments is very important both in terms of the global carbon budget and for 

reconstruction of the relationships between gas hydrate carbon pools and concentrations of 

greenhouse gases in ancient atmospheres (Kvenvolden, 1993; Henriet and Mienert, 1998). 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 30 

Along the sedimentary column, from depth to the seawater, three main zones (Figure 

2.6) with distinctive biogeochemical processes can be defined: the methanogenic zone, the 

sulphate reduction zone and the aerobic zone. 

 

2.3.2.1  The methanogenic zone 

The methanogenic zone is the deepest of the three zones described above and in 

normal marine sediments it is usually located deeper than a few meters bellow the seafloor. 

At seepage sites this zone is pulled up and can occur very close to the seafloor or even 

reach the seafloor at very active seepage sites. This zone is anaerobic and methane is 

generated biologically by methanogenic archaea. Several intermediates of the breakdown 

of organic matter, as acetate, are converted to methane, following the simplified reaction 

illustrated by equation 2.1. 
 

2422 COCHOCH +=      (2.1) 

 

2.3.2.2  The sulphate reduction zone 

The anaerobic sulphate reduction zone extends from the top of the methanogenic 

zone to the bottom of the oxic zone. In general this zone extends few centimetres to few 

meters below the seafloor. At cold seeps the thickness of this zone is highly variable and in 

active seepage systems the sulphate reduction zone can be very thin and is in general 

pulled up to the seafloor or very close to it. The biogeochemical processes at this zone are 

characterized by two main reactions: the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) which 

occurs in combination with sulphate reduction (SR) according to equation 2.2, and the 

oxidation of organic matter (equation 2.3). 

AOM is the primary process by which biomass is generated and accumulates at 

methane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Michaelis et al., 2002). AOM has 

been found to be performed by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-

reducing bacteria (SRB), in which sulphate acts as the terminal oxidant (Boetius et al., 

2000). AOM in cold seeps sediments is indicated by geochemical (Thiel et al., 1999; 

Elvert et al., 2000) and by direct microscopic evidence (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 

2001). This process is estimated to globally consume the methane equivalent to 5 - 20% of 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 31

the net modern atmospheric methane flux (20 - 100 x1012 g year-1) (Valentine and 

Reeburgh, 2000). AOM-SR process is also recognised to be the predominant anaerobic 

methane oxidation metabolic process at methane-seeps in the geologic record (Peckmann 

et al., 1999a; Peckmann et al., 1999b; Peckmann et al., 1999c; Thiel et al., 1999; Elvert et 

al., 2000; Goedert et al., 2000; Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001a; 

Peckmann et al., 2001b; Peckmann et al., 2001c; Thiel et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 2002; 

Michaelis et al., 2002; Peckmann et al., 2002; Gischler et al., 2003; Goedert et al., 2003; 

Peckmann et al., 2003; Peckmann and Thiel, 2004; Peckmann et al., 2004). The 

understanding of the microbial processes is therefore most important for the understanding 

of element cycling at modern and ancient seeps. Ancient methane seepage processes can be 

revealed by geochemical evidence: biomarkers, C and S stable isotopes and microbial-

induced sedimentary fabrics and microbial precipitates. Stromatolitic fabrics have been 

found at seep deposits as old as the Devonian age (Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Microbial-

induced precipitates have been reported from a Tertiary seep limestone (Cavagna et al., 

1999; Peckmann et al., 1999b). Fossilised biofilms were recognised in the same limestone 

(Peckmann et al., 1999b) as well as in Cretaceous seep deposits which contain structures 

interpreted to represent prokaryotic body fossils (Shapiro, 2004). 

Three lines of evidence have traditionally been used to support the existence of 

AOM-SR: (i) diagenetic (advection-diffusion-reaction) models of methane concentration 

profiles in anoxic sediments and water column (Barnes and Goldberg, 1976); (ii) tracer 

measurements using 14C - CH4, 3H - CH4 and 35S - SO42- (Reeburgh, 1980); and (iii) stable 

isotope distributions (Whiticar, 1999). 

Figure 2.6 schematically summarizes the depth distributions of CH4, total carbon 

dioxide (?CO2), sulphate (SO42-) and the stable carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide 

(?13CO2) in anoxic marine sediments. The distributions of all species show slope changes 

or minima at a specific depth, suggesting that most of the methane consumption takes 

place in a thin subsurface depth interval. The ?13CO2 minimum appears to be the result of 

local injection of methane-derived carbon dioxide. AOM occurs throughout the sulphate 

reduction zone (SRZ) reaching the maximum at the base of the SRZ, at the sulphate-

methane transition zone (SMTZ). The low methane concentration zone observed at the 

surface of marine sediments results from the distribution of anaerobic methane oxidation 

rates in the sulphate reduction zone. Methane oxidation rates are highest at the SMTZ.

It should be noted that, as consequence of AOM-SR, in particular as result of the 

sulphate reducing bacteria, the pore water dissolved sulphate is consumed, the alkalinity 

increases and sulphide accumulates in concentrations equivalent to those of sulphate 

consumption. Intense sulphide production supports the occurrence of sulphide-based 

communities such as Beggiatoa, Calyptogena, bivalves of the families Vesicomydae, 

Mytilidae, Solemyidae, Thyasiridae and Lucinidae, hosting endosymbiotic 

chemoautotrophic bacteria, pogonophoran worms, Cladorhizidae and Hymedesmiidae 

sponges (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). In the Gulf of Cadiz the common chemosynthetic 

community is composed of Siboglinum sp., Polybrachia and Oligograchia (pogonophora), 

Acharax sp. (solemydae) and Lucinoma (Lucinidae) (Cunha et al., 2005; Rodrigues and 

Cunha, 2005).

as aragonite pavements and dolomite conduits (Magalhães et al., 2005a). This process will 

be discussed in chapters 5 to 8 of this thesis. 

The microorganisms that mediate this reaction are composed by a consortium of 

certain archaea that are capable of reverse the process of methanogenesis by interaction 

with sulphate-reducing bacteria (Hoehler et al., 1994; Hansen et al., 1998; Hinrichs et al., 

1999), with sulphate as the terminal electron accepter, according to equation (2.2). 

Microscopic evidence of the structured consortium of archaea and sulphate-reducing 

bacteria, identified by Boetius et al. (2000) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 

with specific 16S rRNA-target oligonucleotides has shown that the archaea-bacterial 

symbiosis is structured in dense aggregates in general of about 100 cells (although these 

aggregates can contain a smaller or a much larger number of cells) of archaea surrounded 

by sulphate-reducing bacteria, as illustrated in Figure 2.7.

labelled probe EelMS932 (archaea) and the FLUOS-labelled probe

These aggregates are abundant in gas hydrate rich sediments and in methane seep 

areas with high rates of methane-based sulphate reduction. An average archaea/SRB 

consortium, illustrated in Figure 2.7, consists of an inner sphere of 2.3 ± 1.3 µm diameter 

containing about 100 coccoid archaeal cells, each 0.5 µm in diameter. These are partially 

or fully surrounded by about 200 cells of SRB (0.3 – 0.5 µm in diameter), which form an 

outer shell of mostly 1-2 cell layers. The size spectrum of 100 archaea/SRB consortia 

ranged from 1 to 11 µm in diameter with an average of 3.2 ± 1.5 µm. The smallest 

aggregates identified were composed of 1-3 archaea cells and 1-3 cells of SRB, and may 

represent early stages of the consortium development, while the largest aggregates 

contained about 10000 cells. These consortia are highly abundant in surface sediments at 

sulphide concentrations &amp;lt;10 mM, with a maximum of 7x107 aggregates cm-3 at 1-2 cm 

depth (Boetius et al., 2000).

This reaction produces CO2 and increases the alkalinity in the sediments. Similar to 

the AOM-SR the anaerobic oxidation of organic matter also can drive carbonate 

precipitation and replacement reactions producing calcite and or dolomite. 

 

2.3.2.3  The aerobic zone 

The aerobic zone extends from the top of the sulphate reduction zone to the seafloor 

and within the water column, in normal seawater. In sites of high methane flux, such as 

active mud volcanoes, the oxygenated zone can be of just a few millimetres thick e.g. 4 

mm thick of the aerobic zone at the Captain Arutyunov MV (Pfannkuche and 

Fahrtteilnehmer, 2006). The aerobic oxidation of methane can be represented by the 

following reaction: 
 

OHCOOCH 2224 22 +?+  (2.4) 

 
It should be noted that the aerobic oxidation of methane produces CO2 which, 

reacting with the H2O, generates H2CO3, reducing the pore water pH and inhibiting the 

precipitation of carbonates, leading to their dissolution. 

 

2.3.3 Geologic setting and worldwide occurrences of cold seeps 

Cold seepage is recognized to occur in a diversity of geological and tectonic settings. 

The occurrence of cold seeps is in general associated with other fluid escape structures. 

They are in general directly associated with: mud volcanoes (Brown, 1990; Aloisi et al., 

2000; Magalhães et al., 2004); mud cones (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003); mud diapirs (Brown, 

1990); pockmarks (Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988); salt diapirs (Acosta et 

al., 2003); coral reefs, although not proved and still in debate, a possibly link between 

methane seepage and carbonate mount formation by coral reef Lophelia Pertusa growth 

was been proposed (Hovland, 1990; Hovland and Thomsen, 1997; Henriet et al., 2003);

seamounts; eroded platforms or escarpments (Paull et al., 1992); faults (Ritger et al., 1987; 

Kauffman et al., 1996; Rad et al., 1996); polygonal faults, a non-tectonic class of layer-

bound faults that are organized in a polygonal map pattern and are related to sediment 

compaction and fluid expulsion (Gay et al., 2006a; Gay et al., 2006b); sedimentary 

structures, such as sand injections (sandstone dykes and sills), and inclined bedding (Jonk 

et al., 2003; Mazzini et al., 2003). It should be noted that the sandstone dykes and sills are 

not distinct processes that originate other fluid escape structures but form a related 

continuum of mobilization features or of fluid escape structures. These structures, when 

formed, also represent conduits for preferential fluid transport to the seafloor. 

An worldwide compilation of occurrences of modern and ancient seeps was 

presented by Campbell et al., (2002) and is illustrated in Figure 2.8.

2.3.4 Cold seepage manifestations and detection 

Cold seeps, in particular methane seepage can be detected by visual, hydro-acoustic 

and by geochemical observations. Visual inspection of the seafloor by submersible/ROV or 

underwater video systems allow the observation of gas hydrates at the seafloor (that 

indicate methane flux to the near seafloor where it crystallises as clathrates), plumes of gas 

bubbles streams ascending from the seafloor (Figure 2.9A, C, F and G). Gas bubbles can 

also be revealed by acoustic observations, specially the cases of gas hydrate coated 

methane bubbles that can be imagined by echo sounders (Greinert et al., 2006; Sauter et 

al., 2006) where they form flares in the water column (Figure 2.9F and G) that can also be 

imagined by side-scan sonar (Figure 2.9H). Geochemical profiles of methane (Figure 2.6), 

hydrocarbons, clorinity and specific elements allow the measurement of fluxes of 

hydrocarbon gas measurements and the calculation of the rates of consumption or seepage 

to the bottom waters. 

Both hydrothermal and cold seeps, in general, support chemoautotrophic fauna 

(section 2.6) that supports very specific ecosystems that clearly differ from the normal 

surrounding environment. As the distinction between hydrothermal vents and cold seeps is 

chemically and geologically simple, the identification of such chemosynthetic communities 

is used as a strong indicator of cold seepage on the geological record. 

The most important manifestation of seepage of hydrocarbons is the formation of 

methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). The deposits of MDAC together with the 

identification of chemosynthetic communities are the most important criteria used to the 

identification of palaeo-cold seeps in the geological record. 

Fossil cold seep deposits were recognised as far as into the Devonian (Campbell and 

Bottjer, 1995; Peckmann et al., 1999c; Peckmann et al., 2005). Examples of fossil cold 

seeps include the Lower Eocene carbonate cemented chimneys in Varna, NE Bulgaria (De 

Boever et al., 2006), the Eocene–Miocene fossiliferous carbonates from Barbados, 

Trinidad and northern Venezuela (Gill et al., 2005), the Late Cretaceous in the 

(Campanian) submarine springs (Tepee Buttes) of Colorado (Kauffman et al., 1996), the 

Miocene Marmorito and Lucina limestones of Monferrato, NW Italy (Clari et al., 1994; 

Cavagna et al., 1999; Peckmann et al., 1999b; Pierre et al., 2002), the Oxfordian seep 

carbonates from Beauvoisin, southeastern France (Peckmann et al., 1999b), the Upper 

Jurassic Methane-Seep Limestone from the Fossil Bluff Group Fore-Arc Basin of

Monterey Bay region (Aiello et al., 2001; Aiello, 2005), the hydrocarbon seep-carbonate

2.4 Methane-derived authigenic carbonates 

 

Methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) are carbonates formed by 

microbially-mediated processes that occur at the seafloor or in subsurface, at sites of 

hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage (e.g. Hovland et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988). The 

precipitation of the carbonates is assigned to the sulphate reduction zone or to the transition 

between the sulphate reduction zone with the methanogenic zone, where the microbial 

sulphate reduction is coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull 

et al., 1992), as described in section 2.3.2. According to the Reeburgh (1980) net equation 

(equation 2.2), bicarbonate is produced and increases the alkalinity promoting the 

precipitation of carbonates. The precipitation of carbonate can be envisaged as follows: 

 
+

?
?++ +?+?+ HCOMnMGFeCaHCOMnMgFexxCa xx 313

22 ),,(),,)(1(  (2.5) 

with 0 &amp;lt;x &amp;lt;1. 

 

Thus, for carbonate precipitation to occur, a cation (Ca, Fe, Mg or Mn) is required. 

Calcite precipitation occurs when pore fluids are supersaturated with respect to this 

mineral. The mineralogy of the carbonate cement is possibly controlled by the geochemical 

environment such as the concentration of SO42- in pore waters. Strong concentrations of 

SO42- in the sediments will inhibit the precipitation of dolomite or Mg-calcite (which are 

the more soluble and thermodynamically more stable), enhancing instead the precipitation 

of aragonite. 

The understanding of the formation of dolomite in the MDAC can bring an important 

contribution to the understanding of the so called “dolomite problem”. Dolomite is the 

thermodynamically stable carbonate phase in seawater, but it is a rather rare mineral in 

modern marine depositional environments. Nevertheless, dolomite is one of the three most 

common sedimentary carbonate minerals (Baker and Kastner, 1981). This abundance of 

dolomite over the geological record can not be explained by the diagenetic dolomitization 

process of calcite and aragonite, as there are marked irregularities in the dolomite 

distribution with time. Therefore, dolomite had to be a common, extensive and widespread 

rock forming mineral in ancient sediments, in particular in late Precambrian and Paleozoic 

times, but it is rather scarce in the Holocene (Kastner, 1984). 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 39

The formulation of the microbial dolomite model (Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; 

Warthmann et al., 2000) introduced a biogeochemical approach to the understanding of the 

dolomite formation. A plausible correlation was established between the geochemical 

cycles and dolomite formation with a positive correlation between extensive dolomitization 

periods and decreased oxygen levels at the oceans and atmosphere (Burns et al., 2000). 

The low oxygen levels would have fostered a more active community of anaerobic 

microbes, including the sulphate-reducing bacteria, that are involved in mediating the 

dolomite nucleation in the formation of dolomite in natural environments (Vasconcelos et 

al., 1995). The understanding of the formation process of the authigenic dolomite in cold 

seeps environments can contribute to the understanding of the biogeochemical 

environmental conditions of dolomite formation (see chapters 5, 6 and 7). 

The carbonates in these environments are formed by cementation of seafloor or 

shallow sediments by precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The formed carbonates can 

present variable morphologies and shapes: (1) cemented sedimentary layers (Hovland et 

al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988) (Figure 2.10, e.g. A to F); (2) thin crusts (few 

centimetres) to thick slabs (up to several meters in size) that pave the seafloor for several 

square meters (Aloisi et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2001; Greinert et al., 2002; Magalhães et 

al., 2005b) (Figure 2.10B, C E and F); (3) irregular edifices and build-ups that can be 

several meters high (Magalhães et al., 2005b) (Figure 2.10A) and that can be formed by 

chemical authigenic precipitation (called chemoherms) and by cemented calcareous 

skeletal debris of chemo-symbiotic fauna (Aharon, 1994; Clari et al., 1994); (4) chimneys 

or pipe-like structures (Kulm et al., 1986; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Aiello et al., 2001; Díaz-

del-Río et al., 2003; Magalhães et al., 2005b) (Figure 2.10G to I). The MDAC are typically 

found on the seafloor or at shallow depths below the sediment water interface.

2.5 Gas Hydrates and BSRs 

 

2.5.1 Definition, characteristics and formation mechanisms 

Natural gas hydrate (Figure 2.11A to B) is a mineral composed of water and natural 

gas (of relatively light molecular weight and that usually is methane, but can also be C2H6, 

C3H8, C4H10, CO2 or H2S), where the water molecules hydrogen-bonded are arranged in a 

rigid framework of cages. The interior of the water cages is occupied by the gas molecules 

that give the stability to the structure (Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2001). Natural gas 

hydrates can have three possible structures: structure I (Figure 2.11G) and II, of the cubic 

crystallographic system, and structure H, of the hexagonal crystallographic system. The 

gas hydrate structure depends on the size of the guest gas molecules (Sloan, 1998). 

Since 1810, with the discovery of chlorine hydrate by Sir Humphrey Davy, gas 

hydrates have been looked as a scientific curiosity, in which gas and water are transformed 

into a solid. Since 1934, with the recognition of the occurrence of gas hydrate plugs in 

pipelines, gas hydrates started to be looked as a hazard concern in the gas and oil industry. 

From the mid-1960s, with the discovery of natural gas hydrates in deep oceans, permafrost 

regions and also in extraterrestrial environments, gas hydrates started to be of increasing 

interest in the geosciences (Sloan, 1998). The first recognition of natural gas hydrates was 

in 1965 in the Siberian permafrost, northern Russia (Makogon et al., 1971). On the seabed 

environment, gas hydrates were later inferred from pore water analysis during the DSDP 

Leg 11 drill in the Blake Ridge, in the early 1970s (Lancelot and Ewing, 1972). More 

discoveries were reported from the Black Sea (Yefremova and Zhizhchenko, 1974), from 

the Caspian Sea (Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1998), from the MacKenzie Delta and offshore 

Mexico (Shipley et al., 1979; Shipley and Didyk, 1982). Since then, gas hydrates have 

been increasingly recognised in many offshore areas of both active and passive margins. 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 42 

Natural gas hydrates can be formed and are stable in conditions illustrated in Figure 

2.11H, which depend on the temperature, pressure, the chemistry (salinity) of the pore 

water and the composition of the guest gas molecules. Favourable conditions for the 

formation of natural gas hydrates occur over a grater part of the shallow subsurface of the 

Earth beneath the ocean at water depths exceeding about 500 m (shallower beneath colder 

Artic seas) and on land beneath high-latitude permafrost. Gas hydrates will be present in 

such conditions only if there is adequate water within the sediments to form the host 

molecules, and the adequate supply of gas (in general methane). In the Artic, gas hydrate 

occurrences are often associated with petroleum deposits, whereas at continental margins, 

where the greatest amounts of gas hydrate occur, the gas is mainly microbial in origin. The 

ocean margins are characterized by the greatest flux of organic carbon to the seafloor 

because of the high biologic productivity and the highest organic detritus accumulation 

from the continents. Furthermore, continental margins are characterized by high 

sedimentation rates that have the effect of covering and sealing the organic material 

preventing it from being oxidized. Latter microbial degradation of the organic mater in the 

sediments produces methane which, if the pressure and temperature conditions are 

appropriated, will form gas hydrates. 

 

2.5.2 Significance 

Natural gas hydrates (GHs) are of great importance and their formation/dissociation 

can constrain several sedimentological processes. 

The dissociation of GHs can create overpressures in the sediments that can trigger 

landslides (Huhnerbach and Masson, 2004), blowouts, seafloor collapse events and 

seafloor mass movements that represent a potential geohazard for seafloor pipelines, oilrig 

anchors and other seafloor structures (Hovland and Gudmestad, 2001). The dissociation of 

GHs during drilling operations can cause sediment mobilization and represent also a safety 

hazard for seafloor and sub-seafloor operations. Moreover, GHs in sediments are sensitive 

to small temperature changes. A temperature increase of 1.0-1.5ºC has the potential to 

cause gas hydrate (GH) dissociation. Small fluctuations in fluid flow were also recorded at 

the tidal frequency, indicating that very small perturbations in the ambient pressure 

conditions may lead to GH dissociation. 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 43

The proximity of the GH methane reservoir to the seafloor and its restricted 

thermodynamic stability domain has motivated large speculations about the release of 

methane in response to climatic changes (MacDonald, 1990). Increases of seabottom 

temperature (as result of regional oceanographic condition changes) and decreases in 

pressure (e.g. through sea level changes) can destabilize GHs, releasing methane into the 

near-surface environment and having an important impact on the carbon cycle (Buffett and 

Archer, 2004; Archer and Buffett, 2005). According to the “clathrate gun” hypothesis 

(Kennett et al., 2003), episodic emissions of methane to the atmosphere (a powerful 

greenhouse gas), as a consequence of the destabilisation of GH reservoirs may have had 

significant impact on past climatic changes (Kennett et al., 1996; Judd et al., 1997; Kennett 

et al., 2000; Judd et al., 2002; Judd, 2003; Kennett et al., 2003; Judd, 2004). 

In particular sites, where GHs may occur in adequate concentrations, GHs may also 

be a significant energy resource as a hydrocarbon fuel. Mud volcanoes are one of these 

particular sites where GHs can occur in high concentrations. 

Gas hydrates may also play an important role on the distribution of chemosynthetic 

communities (Carney, 1994), as revealed during the ODP Leg 164 at Blake Ridge where 

high bacterial activity were reported near the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) 

(Wellsbury et al., 2000) demonstrating that the sediments near the BSR form a 

biogeochemical dynamic zone. 

 

2.5.3 Detection 

While gas hydrates have been recovered and directly observed at the seafloor, they 

are generally identified in the marine environment through geochemical and geophysical 

(mainly seismic) indirect evidences. 

The geochemical indicators consist of decreases of the interstitial water chlorinity 

values, stable isotopic 18O-enrichment of the pore waters, and salinity and temperature 

anomalies registered along gravity cores and boreholes (Hesse and Harrison, 1981; 

Davidson et al., 1983; Hesse et al., 2000; Hesse, 2003). During the crystallization of the 

hydrates, like in the formation of ice, salt ions are excluded from the solid structure and 

there is a preferential uptake of the heavy isotopes. During the retrieval of gas hydrate 



Chapter 2.  Global significance of fluid escape processes and manifestations at continental margins and intra-

plate settings 

 44 

bearing cores, the destabilization of the gas hydrates releases fresh water that produces the 

chlorinity and salinity anomalies associated with 18O-enrichement of the pore waters.

Geophysical evidence of gas hydrates are the so called gas hydrate-related bottom-

simulating reflectors (BSRs) detected with seismic reflection methods (Figure 2.11H and 

I). The BSR are a class of seismic reflectors that cross-cut sedimentary strata and that are 

generally related to processes that occur after the deposition of the sediments. The BSRs 

are caused by processes depending on sub-bottom depth, which in turn influences the 

pressure and the temperature within the sediments. A common BSR not related with GH is 

caused by the diagenetic transformation of opal A to opal CT and quartz. This process 

results in a positive acoustic impedance contrast between the silicate rich sediments with 

different diagenetic evolution stages (Kastner et al., 1977). In the mid-Norwegian margin, 

a similar diagenetic-related BSR has been observed underneath the opal A to opal CT 

transition and interpreted as resulting from the diagenetic smectite to illite transformation 

or as resulting from an increase in the abundance of authigenic carbonates (Berndt et al., 

2004). These diagenetic-related BSRs have the same polarity as the seafloor reflection, a 

criteria that differentiates this class of BSRs from the gas hydrate-related BSRs. 

The gas hydrate-related BSRs are formed as a consequence of the acoustic contrast 

between the relatively high velocity hydrate-charged sediments within the gas hydrate 

stability zone, bellow which is located a low velocity gas charged sediments, where free 

gas can occur underneath the gas hydrate stability zone (Singh et al., 1993). The gas 

hydrate-related BSR corresponds to a reflection caused by these negative impedance 

contrasts (Pecher et al., 1996). The gas hydrate-related BSRs present four main 

characteristics: (1) The depth of the BSR bellow the seafloor is more or less constant, 

indicating that the BSR is temperature dependent rather than pressure dependent; (2) the 

BSRs are anomalously high reflective events, indicating an abrupt change in the acoustic 

impedance, i.e., a strong contrast in density and/or sound velocity with depth; (3) the BSRs 

often cross-cut the lithological reflections, indicating that it is a diagenetic feature 

(fluid/gas), rather than related to changes in lithology; (4) the BSRs present a reverse 

acoustic polarity with respect to the seafloor reflection, indicating that the P waves are 

being reflected from a boundary with an negative impedance contrast, i.e., where in 

general the density is reduced and/or the sound velocity is reduced with depth. 

Sedimentary strata below the BSRs are usually more strongly defined i.e. enhanced, 

compared to those above, where the lithological layers are weakly reflective. This upper

 46 

zone is therefore referred to as seismically transparent or blanking zone and, it is suspected 

to be caused by hydrate cementation and its relatively high acoustic velocity. 

Although the gas hydrate-related BSRs are widely interpreted as in situ gas hydrates 

indicators, they are not necessary and always adequate indicators of gas hydrates and their 

absence does not exclude the possibility to find gas hydrates. Some areas with gas hydrates 

do not have BSRs and in some areas drilling through BSRs failed to find gas hydrates. Off 

the coast of Norway, where drilling through BSRs had failed to find gas hydrates, it was 

proposed that the observed BSR represented a palaeo-BSR, and although the gases and gas 

hydrates may once have been present, they are no longer there in significant quantities, in 

spite of the fact that the diagenetic and consequently acoustic properties changes induced 

by the BSR are still present. 

In conclusion, BSRs can be interpreted as representing a physicochemical and a 

biogeochemical intense reaction zone, where gas hydrates are formed above the BSR in the 

gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and free gas occurs below it. 

 

2.5.4 Occurrences 

Natural gas hydrates occur worldwide in oceanic sediments of continental and insular 

slopes and rises of active and passive margins, in deep-water sediment of inland lakes and 

seas, and in polar sediment on both continents and continental shelves. Their occurrence is 

controlled by the conjugation of factors that include temperature, pressure and the 

composition of the gas and water (Kvenvolden, 1993). In marine sediments, gas hydrates 

are found where the water depths that exceed about 300 m and the bottom water 

temperatures approach 0° C, found at the seafloor down to sediment depths of about 1100 

m. In polar continental regions of permafrost, gas hydrates can be present in sediments at 

depths between about 150 and 2000 m (Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2000, 2001). As can be 

seen from Figure 2.12 and comparing it with the global occurrences of mud volcanism 

(Figure 2.4) and cold seeps (Figure 2.8), it is possible to conclude that many of these 

locations coincide, putting in evidence the interconnection between all the different fluid 

escape occurrences and manifestations.

polygons). Modified from Kvenvolden and Lorenson (2000), with additions. 

 

2.5.5 Global estimations 

Estimates of methane trapped as gas hydrates in the sediments of continental margins 

are very variable and speculative, and have been subject of debate for many years. The 

most widely cited estimate of global gas hydrates of 21x1015 m3 of methane at a standard 

temperature and pressure (STP), or 10 000 Gt of methane carbon (Kvenvolden and 

Lorenson, 2001), has been proposed as a consensus value from several independent 

estimations. This amount may represent 3000 times the amount of methane in the present-

day atmosphere. It may also represent twice the amount of all fossil fuels on Earth. This 

large reservoir value suggests that the gas hydrates are a potentially important future 

energy source, a likely source of geohazards and an important component of the global 

carbon cycle. 

Recent improvements in the constraining parameters of the gas hydrate estimations 

(direct measurements of gas concentrations in the sediments and by the DSDP/ODP/IODP 

drilling) have significantly diminished the global gas hydrate estimates to the range 1-

5x1015 m3 or ~500 – 2500 Gt of methane carbon (Milkov, 2004). This implies that the role 

of gas hydrates in the global carbon cycle may not be as significant as speculated 

previously, but still not neglectable. The destabilization of gas hydrates can induce the 

release of potential large volumes of methane (given the global estimates of gas hydrates),

that will input significant amount of carbon to the ocean/atmosphere, a process important 

enough to unbalance the carbon cycle. During the geological record this process is 

recognized as having a important role in the global carbon cycle and that could have 

triggered rapid climatic changes such as the intense global warming at the 

Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) (Schiermeier, 2003). 

 

 

2.6 Associated ecosystems 

 

Since their discovery, chemoautotrophic or methanotrophic-based communities 

associated with seafloor seepage have been found in various settings and appear to be 

common along continental margins. Chemosynthetic primary production forms the base of 

the hydrocarbon seep community food web. These comprise the sulphate-reducing 

bacteria, methanogens, methane and sulphide oxidizing bacteria. 

The most characteristic and indicative seep biota consists of bacterial mats, 

pogonophorans (Figure 2.13A-C) and Vestimentifera tubeworms, mollusca modiolid 

mussels, lucinid and vesicomyid clams (Figure 2.13D-F). Their presence indicates the 

expulsion of hydrocarbon-rich fluids. Certain types of bivalves are frequently used for the 

detection of active seepage sites by visual inspection due their large size, their light colour 

and their general high abundance and characteristics arrangements in clusters and 

alignments (Suess et al., 1998). 

Chemosynthetic endosymbioses occur ubiquitously at oxic-anoxic interfaces in 

marine environments. In these mutualisms, bacteria living directly within the cell of a 

eukaryotic host oxidize reduced chemicals (sulphur or methane), fuelling their own 

energetic and biosynthetic needs, in addition to those of their host (Stewart et al., 2005). 

The oldest metazoans populated with microbes in vent settings are Silurian in age, as the 

metazoan fossils of seep deposits (Campbell, 2006). 

The nutrition of the Vesicomidae clams and solemyids is based on the thiotrophic 

chemoautotrophy of the endosymbionts. Vestimentiferans and pogonophorams are also 

chemoautotrophic, with most species being thiotrophic, but some clear methanotrophic 

(Suess et al., 1998). Stable isotopic compositions of tissues (?13C, ?15N, ?34S) are used as 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 49

indicators of the food source. Large depletions of ?13C (-30 to -70‰) in the tissues of 

organisms, such as vestimentiferans, bivalves and gastropods, have been proposed to 

indicate methanotrophy or sulphide oxidation by symbionts in seep and vent taxa (Levin, 

2005). The carbon isotopic composition of soft tissues and chitinous hard parts of seep 

biota exhibit 13C-depleted stable isotopic compositions, reflecting thiotrophic and 

methanotrophic origin as the dominant carbon metabolizing pathway. For instance, the 

?13C values of non calcareous parts of seep fauna from the Aleutian subduction zone range 

from -28.6‰ to -64.3‰ Pee Dee belemnite (PDB) (Suess et al., 1998) and the 

chemosynthetic communities from the Florida Escarpment have ?13C values as low as -

76.4‰ (Paull et al., 1992). The carbonate shells also exhibit evidence for 

chemoautotrophic derived carbon. Usually the seep bivalve shells are only slightly 

depleted in ?13C because they preferably incorporate bicarbonate from seawater. The 

vesicomyid clams usually show complex cross-laminar layer structure with differential 

?13C compositions that due to metabolic factor are more enriched in the inner lamellas. The 

solemyid shells in general present isotopically lighter carbonate than the carbonate of the 

vesicomyid clam shells. This is interpreted as consequence of the solemyids metabolism as 

they utilize a mixture of metabolic and bottom water CO2 in building their shells, probably 

because they live buried in the vent sediments and pump bottom water through their 

borrows (Suess et al., 1998).

of Cadiz 

 

 

3.1 Plate tectonic setting 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located between the southern limit of the Iberia continental 

margin and the northern limit of the Africa Atlantic margin. The regional geodynamic 

setting in the Gulf of Cadiz is dominated by the slow convergence of about 4 mm/year 

between the African and the Eurasian plates (Argus et al., 1989). 

The boundary between the Eurasia and the Africa tectonic plates (Figure 3.1) extends 

from the Azores archipelago, in the West, across the Gibraltar area in the Gulf of Cadiz, 

and to the East through the Alboran Sea, into the Mediterranean region in the north of 

Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia (Buforn et al., 1995). This plate boundary has a complex 

nature due to its proximity to the pole of rotation of the African plate (Buforn et al., 2004a; 

Buforn et al., 2004b). The Atlantic sector of the Azores-Gibraltar Plate Boundary (AGPB) 

has a variable stress pattern along its length. In the western sector, from the Mid-Atlantic 

Ridge until 25ºW, the Azores plateau (Figure 3.1), it is characterized by a divergent 

behaviour with crustal extension and normal faulting (Jiménez-Munt et al., 2001). In the 

central sector, the Gloria fault, between 25º and 15ºW, the boundary has a transcurrent 

motion with dextral strike-slip faulting (Jiménez-Munt et al., 2001). The eastern sector, 

delimited from the Gloria Fault by the Tore-Madeira Ridge, is composed of two distinct 

regions: the Gorringe Bank region, that has oceanic affinities (Sartori et al., 1994); and the 

Gulf of Cadiz region, more likely of continental nature. Both regions of this AGPL sector 

are characterised by a general NW-directed compressive behaviour with plate convergence 

and reverse faulting (Tortella et al., 1997) with a transpressional regime in the Gulf of 

Cadiz. This sector of the AGPL is more complex than the ones to the west and neither the 

plate limits nor the lithosphere structure are yet well constrained (Sartori et al., 1994).

from Coffin et al. (2000) and relative movements from Jiménez-Munt et al. (2001). The Gulf of Cadiz 

location is shown by the letters: GC. 

 

The main regional features in the Gulf of Cadiz are related with the Rif-Betic 

mountain belt, with westward directed thrusting (Maldonado et al., 1999), that establishes 

the eastern limit of the Azores-Gibraltar transform. The arcuate mountain belt of the Rif-

Betic surrounds a zone of strong Neogene subsidence and crustal thinning in the Western 

Alboran Sea. 

In the Gulf of Cadiz, the Eurasia-Africa boundary or, more precisely, the Iberia-

Africa (Nubia) boundary, corresponds to a NNW-SSE directed continental-continental 

collisional setting, with a slow convergence of 2 to 4 mm/year (Argus et al., 1989; Sartori 

et al., 1994), and with a diffuse nature (Jiménez-Munt et al., 2001). The deformation is 

expressed by a large number of lithospheric blocks delimited by deep accidents with 

variable main orientations: E-W to ENE-WSW; NW-SE; and NE-SW (Cabral, 1995). The 

complex interaction of these microplates is expressed by a diffuse seismicity in the Gulf of 

Cadiz and Gibraltar region (Jiménez-Munt et al., 2001) with superficial epicentres and 

with important intermediate-depth epicentres (Figure 3.4). The focal mechanisms indicate

predominantly inverse fault systems and oblique NW-SE convergence (Grimison and 

Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1995).  

The Gulf of Cadiz area comprises the ocean-continent boundaries of the African and 

Iberian plates. The exact location of the continental-ocean boundary is not exactly known 

but it is accepted that most of the Gulf of Cadiz basement is continental crust that thins to 

the west and oceanic crust is probably found at the Gorringe Bank, Horseshoe and Seine 

Abyssal Plains (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2001).  

Several tectonic models have been proposed to explain the different geologic 

characteristics of the Gulf of Cadiz. Subduction models involving either: a southward-dip 

(Sanz de Galdeano, 1990; Morales et al., 1999), a northward-dip (Torres-Roldan et al., 

1986), an eastward-dip (Royden, 1993; Lonergan and White, 1997; Gutscher et al., 2002; 

Gutscher et al., 2006; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006), and a westward-dip (Docherty and 

Banda, 1995) have been proposed. Maldonado et al. (1999) propose the subduction of 

intermediate-type crust from the Iberian margin under the Alboran microplate in a western 

Alboran subduction zone with subsequent deformation of the lower plate in the form of 

crustal slices. Alternatively, Sartori et al. (1994) proposed that the tectonic stress from the 

Iberia-Africa convergence was released across a 200 km long area between the Seine 

Abyssal plain and the Gorringe Bank, without a defined plate margin and without any 

subduction been developed in the area. 

While both tectonic regimes: subduction and distributed compression deformation, 

have not been demonstrated and strong debate is still going on, the Gutscher et al. (2002) 

(active) subduction model proposes the Gulf of Cadiz as an (active) accretionary wedge 

resulting from the east dipping subduction zone beneath the Gibraltar Arc and the Alboran 

domain. This subduction would be the result of slab rollback towards the west causing 

extension and subsidence in the Alboran domain and westward advance of the Gibraltar 

Arc resulting in compressional deformation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. This 

model is based on the tomography data that images a slab of cold and dense material, 

interpreted as oceanic lithosphere, dipping from the Atlantic domain of the Gulf of Cadiz, 

passing through intermediate depths (60-120 km) beneath the westernmost Alboran Sea 

(region dominated by intermediate depth seismicity) and that is proposed to merge with a 

region of deep-focus earthquakes (600-660 km) below Granada, Spain (Figure 3.2). The 

observation of active thrust faults dipping to the east, above an east dipping decollement

and an eastern dipping basement (Figure 3.3) is interpreted as indicating an active 

accretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz region supporting the tectonic model of Gutscher 

(2002).

3.2 Seismicity (present day stress pattern and tectonic regime) 

 

The seismicity distribution can be used to constrain the Africa-Eurasia plate 

boundary. The main characteristic of the distribution of the epicentres in the Gulf of Cadiz 

is the asymmetry between the North and South margins. The seismicity is clearly 

concentrated in the Iberia margin (between the latitude 36º and 37ºN) while along the 

Moroccan margin the seismicity is found on the Rif, including the Larache area, but out of 

this domain the seismicity is very scarce (Figure 3.4). This indicates that the deformation 

caused by the present day active collision between Africa (Nubia) and Iberia is being 

concentrated on the northern sector of the Gulf of Cadiz where most probably the plate 

boundary is located. 

 
Figure 3.4. Distribution of the epicentres between 1963 and 2006 (magnitude &gt; 0.1) taken from the USGE-

ANSS catalogue. Shallow earthquakes (depth &amp;lt;20 km) are represented in blue, intermediate earthquakes (20 

&amp;lt;depth &amp;lt;40 km) are represented in green and deep earthquakes (depth &gt; 40 km) are represented in red. The 

size of the points is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake according to the scale. 

 

In the area of the Gulf of Cadiz the distribution of the epicentres shows a complex 

behaviour, with shallow (depth &amp;lt;20 km) earthquakes showing a diffuse distribution but 

where some clusters can be identified. These clusters seem to correlate with main 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 56 

topographic and structural highs, such as the Gorringe Bank with a NE-SW orientation, the 

Guadalquivir Bank, where the epicentres are scattered but the general orientation NE-SW 

is still possible to be identified; clusters of the epicentres are also found located along some 

faults as the Horseshoe fault also with the NE-SW trend (Figure 3.4). The distribution of 

the intermediate depth (between 20 and 40 km) and the deep epicentres show a similar 

pattern (Vázquez et al., 2000; Vázquez et al., 2003). The location of the epicentres in this 

location are in agreement with the main tectonic trend described for this area (Torelli et al., 

1997; Hayward et al., 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999). The seismicity also shows 

conspicuous evidences of particular lineaments with a NW-SE direction or with the NE-

SW direction (Figure 3.4). Some of those lineaments on the seismicity can be correlated 

with tectonic lineaments that correspond to the limits and the direction of some of the 

channels and ridges recognised on the bathymetry and on the side-scan sonar imagery. 

 

 

3.3 Geodynamic evolution of the study area 

 

The geodynamic evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz involved multiphase extensional and 

compressional episodes, the last of which is related with the development of the Gibraltar 

Arc associated with the termination of the Betic-Rif orogen, in the W sector of the 

Mediterranean Alpine belt (Roberts, 1970). 

3.3.1 Mesozoic 

During the Mesozoic, from the Permo-Triassic, the geodynamic evolution of the 

South Iberia margin, as a passive margin, was related with a generalized period of 

extension, related with the break-up of the Pangaea and the opening of the central and 

north Atlantic ocean. During the Triassic and Jurassic pre-rift and rift phases, a regional 

oblique extension and rifting, with sinistral strike-slip motion characterized the South 

Iberia margin (García-Dueñas et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997). As result of this extensive 

phase, during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (see Figure 3.5A) this area acted as a 

continental passive margin (Mauffret et al., 1989). During the Late Cretaceous the area 

start to change to a compressive setting associated with the convergence of Iberia with 

Africa  (Rosenbaum et al., 2002).

3.3.2 Cenozoic 

During the Cenozoic the South Iberia margin was in a compressive setting with N-S 

convergence resultant from the rotation of Africa (Srivastava et al., 1990). From this phase 

resulted subduction processes with the closure of the Tethys, subsequent continental 

collision and litospheric deformation started to develop (Rosenbaum et al., 2002). At the 

meridional Iberia Margin, this process resulted in the formation of the Rif-Betics orogenia 

belt, that defines the western domain of the Alpine orogen (Roberts, 1970).  

3.3.2.1 Paleogene 

During the Late Cretaceous to the Middle Eocene, Iberia and Africa behave as a solid 

plate. During the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, Iberia became again independent from 

the Africa plate and at the beginning of the Oligocene the area south Iberia margin goes 

through a new compressive phase as result of the Euroasiatic-Africa plates convergence 

(Srivastava et al., 1990), as illustrated in Figure 3.6A-B. At this time the boundary of the 

two plates is defined by the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone with characteristics very 

similar to the present day. 

3.3.2.2 Neogene 

During the Neogene three different phases can be defined in the geodynamic 

evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz. The first phase corresponds to the last phase of the Rif-

Betic orogen during the Early and Middle Miocene. The second phase, in the Late Miocene 

and Pliocene, is characterized by subsidence and extensional regime in the area, with the 

formation of normal faults with a NNE-SSW direction. The last phase, in the Quaternary is 

characterized by an inversion of the tectonic regime that became compressive. 

3.3.2.2.1 Early and Middle Miocene 

During the Early Miocene the area goes under a compressive regime with the 

beginning of the formation of the Betic orogen (Figure 3.5B and Figure 3.6B). The Iberia-

Africa compression is along a NNW-SSE direction (Srivastava et al., 1990). This 

compressive regime resulted in a convergence of more than 200 km in an N-S direction 

since the Oligocene to the Late Miocene, resulting in the complete closure of the Tethys 

and the displacement of the Gibraltar Arc to the West (Dewey et al., 1989), and the 

development of the Alboran micro-plate to the East (Figure 3.6B-H). 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 58 

As result of this westward migration of the Gibraltar arc front, the instability of the 

continental shelf was promoted and the emplacement of chaotic bodies occurred during the 

Miocene, the so called olistostrome, (Tortella et al., 1997). The emplacement of the chaotic 

bodies was also promoted by the development, during his emplacement, of trusts in its 

front and extensional structures in its back, as a result of fast subsidence in the basin 

(Maldonado and Nelson, 1999).

surrounding domains during the early part of the Middle Miocene (Maldonado and Nelson, 1999). The

Fracture Zone. 

 

3.3.2.2.2 Late Miocene and Pliocene 

During the Early and Middle Miocene the connection between the Atlantic and the 

Alboran domain (Figure 3.6C-F) was established through the Guadalquivir basin north of 

the Betic range and through the Guercif, South of the Rif (Mulder and Parry, 1977). The 

migration to the West of the Alboran domain resulted in the closure of these connections 

that can be associated with a period of low sealevel stand and resulted in the closure of the 

connection of the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic (Haq et al., 1987), leading to the 

desiccation of the Mediterranean, between 5.96 and 5.33 Ma (Figure 3.6H): the so-called 

Messinian salinity crisis (Krijgsman et al., 1999). 

During the Early Pliocene, the tectonic regime became transtensional resulting in 

local extension in the area, and leading to the opening of the Gibraltar strait, re-establishing 

the connection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Figure 3.7A).

3.3.2.3 Quaternary 

Since the Late Pliocene, the tectonic regime in the Gulf of Cadiz becomes 

transpressive, with major compression with NNW-SSE direction (Maldonado et al., 1999), 

and the regional geodynamic setting became dominated by the slow convergence of about 

4 mm/year between Africa and Iberia (Figure 3.7A-B).

3.4 Different geological domains in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 

Several geologic domains can be defined in the Gulf of Cadiz. These domains 

include, from the Gibraltar strait towards the abyssal plains: the Flysh domain, the Sub-

Betics, the Cadiz Basin, the alocthonous units, and the accretionary wedge (Figure 3.8). 

3.4.1 Flysch domain 

The Flysh domain occurs both on land and offshore and corresponds to the SE sector 

of the Iberia margin and the NW sector of the Moroccan margin (Figure 3.8) located close 

to and in the Strait of Gibraltar. It is composed of siliciclastic deposits, mostly turbidites of 

Cretaceous to Miocene age, indicating deep deposition in a trough located between the 

Iberian margin and the Alboran domain, later translated and incorporated into the Gibraltar 

Arc. This domain is delimited to the W by a major thrust with an arcuate shape, indicating 

displacement to the NW and overthrusting of the sub-Betic domain (Puga, 2004). This 

thrust can be mapped offshore and onshore in southern Spain and in northern Morocco. 

 

3.4.2 Sub-Betic domain 

The sub-Betic domain is located externally around the Flysch domain. Its front is 

delimited by a major thrust that defines the arcuate shape of this domain. It corresponds to 

the external domain of the Rif-Betics orogen. This domain consists of Triassic to lower 

Miocene deposits that represents the south Iberian Mesozoic paleo-margin, later 

incorporated into the Rif-Betic orogen. 

3.4.3 Cadiz Basin 

This domain is located in front and externally to the sub-Betic domain. This domain 

is characterized by the infilling of the depocenters along the NE-SW direction of the trusts 

from the sub-Betic domain. This domain is filled by deposits of the Neogene, 

corresponding to the infilling by sediments from the main emerged areas. The Cadiz basin 

developed during the Early Miocene and the oldest deposits are deformed and overlain by 

the emplacement of the Alloctonous Unit of the Guadalquivir (Puga, 2004) marking 

therefore the age of the emplacement of the first allochthonous units.

The basin has a maximum width of 35 km and a rectangular geometry. The NE limit 

is subdivided by three main diapiric ridges that subdivide the basin into several sub-basins 

located between the diapiric ridges. In general the direction of these basins coincides with 

the direction of the main Cadiz basin. 

On the seismic profiles, these basins have up to 1.7 s (TWT) in thicknesses, an 

asymmetric geometry and the have been deformed by the diapiric emplacements during the 

Pliocene and the Quaternary. 

3.4.4 Allochthonous units (Olistostrome/Accretionary wedge) 

The allochthonous deposits in the Gulf of Cadiz (the so-called Olistostrome, chaotic 

body, Guadalquivir allochthon, Guadalquivir accretionary wedge or melange of the Gulf of 

Cadiz), recognized onland and offshore (Roberts, 1970), have been interpreted as resulting 

from gravitational processes, debris-flow mechanisms, diapirism and tectonic melanges. 

Medialdea et al. (2004) defined three different domains of the allochhnous units, based on 

their seismic architecture, the main tectonic features and the nature of the basement 

(oceanic or continental), corresponding to different evolutionary steps in the mechanisms 

of emplacement of the allochthonous units. 

The eastern domain extends along the continental shelf and upper and middle slope 

and corresponds to the offshore extension of the Betic–Rifean external front. This domain 

was emplaced as part of the pre-Messinian orogenic wedge related to the collision that 

gave rise to the Betic–Rifean belt by a combined gravitational and tectonic mechanism. It 

is characterized by salt and shale nappes later affected by extensional collapses. 

The central domain develops along the lower slope between the Betic–Rifean front 

and the abyssal plains and is characterized by a change in dip of the allochthonous basal 

surface and the basement. The northern boundary of this domain is marked by the 

occurrence of a major WNW–ESE-trending thrust fault with a strike-slip component, 

known as the Gorringe–Horseshoe fault (Medialdea et al., 2004). 

The westernmost domain corresponds to the abyssal plains, where the distal 

emplacement of the allochthonous body takes place; it is characterized by thrust faults 

affecting both the sedimentary cover and the possible oceanic basement. The allochthonous 

units of the central and western domains were emplaced after the emplacement of the 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 64 

eastern domain, as a consequence of the Iberia-Africa NE–SW compression since the Late 

Miocene until present. 

3.4.5 Plio-Quaternary morpho-sedimentary domains 

Since the Late Pliocene until present the tectonic setting in the Gulf of Cadiz became 

mainly transpressive with the main compression in the NNW-SSE direction (Maldonado et 

al., 1999). The Quaternary sediment cover of the Gulf of Cadiz was conditioned by the 

sealevel fluctuations with the deposition of thick terrigenous deposits originated from the 

Guadalquivir and Guadiana rivers which on the continental shelf form progradant wedges 

toward the shelf edge. The northern margin of the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by an 

active compressive framework where the allochthonous units provide an unstable basement 

for Late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentation. The Quaternary sedimentation 

in the Gulf of Cadiz is a combination of a contourite-turbidite system with combined drift-

fan morphologies. The presence of a high density of canyons (St. Vicente, Aljesur, Lagos, 

Portimão and Faro Canyons and the Guadalquivir and Cadiz Channels) in the western part 

of the South Portuguese margin that drain sediment directly to the Horseshoe Abyssal 

Plain resulted in the turbiditic sedimentation of the Abyssal plain with slump debris flow 

deposits along this part of the margin. The middle slope is dominated by along-slope 

processes driven by the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) that during the Pliocene and 

the Quaternary produced the edification of a complex contourite depositional system 

(Mougenot and Vanney, 1982; Faugères et al., 1984; Nelson et al., 1993; Hernandez-

Molina et al., 2003). This contourite system is composed of both depositional and erosive 

features (Figure 3.9). The main depositional features are composed of sedimentary wave 

fields, sedimentary lobes, mixed drifts, plastered drifts, elongated mounded, separated 

drifts and sheeted drifts. The main erosive features of the contourite system are the 

contourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys and moats (Llave et al., 2001; Hernandez-

Molina et al., 2003; Hernández-Molina et al., 2006; Llave et al., 2006). The development 

of this contourite system is controlled by the Pliocene and Quaternary environmental and 

paleoceanographic changes and by the morphology of the margin. The lower slope with an 

irregular morphology and the Abyssal plains are dominated by down-slope depositional 

processes. A present day morphosedimentary characterization of the Gulf of Cadiz is 

presented in Figure 3.9.

3.5 Oceanographic setting and the Mediterranean Outflow 

 

3.5.1 Present day oceanographic setting 

The present day circulation patterns and the hydrographical conditions in the Gulf of 

Cadiz are dominated by the exchange of water masses through the Strait of Gibraltar. The 

Atlantic Ocean at the latitude of the Gulf of Cadiz and off Iberia is characterized by four 

main water masses: 

(~100-600 m depth) The Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (Fiuza, 1984) is 

represented by the descending branch of the Gulf Stream. 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 66 

(~600 to 1400 m depth) The Mediterranean Water (MW) that corresponds to the 

Western Mediterranean Intermediate and Bottom Waters characterized by high salinity, 

relatively high temperature and reduced concentration of dissolved oxygen.  

(2000 to 4000 m) The North Atlantic Deep Water 

(&gt;4000 m) The Antarctic Bottom Water 

A regional subdivision of these water masses into four layers can be established and 

to each of these layers corresponds a particular transport direction. 

In the ocean surface, two sub-layers can be defined: the mixture layer or the 

thermocline layer, which is the superficial layer (0-100 m), under direct influence of the 

atmosphere dynamics and that shows considerable seasonal variability. Above the 

thermocline layer that corresponds to the Eastern North Atlantic Water (Fiuza, 1984). 

Bellow the Eastern North Atlantic Water is located under the Eastern North Atlantic 

Central Water (ENACW) and presents in the eastern sector of the North Atlantic two main 

components (Figure 3.10), with distinctive origins, that split at a latitude of about 40ºN 

(Fiuza, 1984). A water mass with a setenptrional subpolar source, the Eastern North 

Atlantic Central Water subpolar (ENACWp), formed by cold convection of deep water at 

the north and northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The second component of the ENACW 

has a subtropical origin and is therefore called the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water 

subtropical (ENACWt). The ENACWt is the central water at the SW and S Portuguese 

margins, in the Gulf of Cadiz and in the Atlantic Moroccan margin. In the Gulf of Cadiz, 

this segment of the ENACWt is characterized by temperature values that range from 8 to 

18ºC and salinities between 32.2 and 36.7 (Emery and Meincke, 1986). The ENACWt is 

described as moving at intermediate depths under the Azores current and circulates in the 

Gulf of Cadiz between 100 and 850 m (Fiuza, 1984; Fiuza et al., 1998) but its velocity is 

considered to be significant only bellow depths of about 500 m, under the surface layer 

characterized by a strong seasonal variation (Fiuza, 1984). 

The hydrology, morphology and the sedimentary dynamics of the Gulf of Cadiz are 

intensely modulated by the intermediate water mass of the Mediterranean Water (MW). 

The MW is characterized by temperatures of about 13ºC, high salinities (~36.5), and an 

oxygen content of about 176 µmol kg-1 (Madelain, 1970; Ambar and Howe, 1979a; Ambar 

et al., 2002). The MW that outflows into the Gulf of Cadiz is composed mainly (about

90%) by the Levantine Intermediate Water and by the Western Mediterranean Deep Water 

(Bryden and Stommel, 1984).

Atlantic Central Water; ENACWt: subtropical branch of the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water. 

 

In the Strait of Gibraltar a two-layer circulation system is established, where the less 

saline water from the Atlantic enters into the Mediterranean as an upper layer and the more 

saline Mediterranean water outflows from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic as a bottom 

layer. The Atlantic Influx corresponds to water from the ENACWt that crosses the Strait of 

Gibraltar at the surface while the MW crosses the Strait beneath the Atlantic Influx at

depths of 40 to 200 m, depending on the bottom strait topography (Gascard and Richez, 

1985). After passing the Strait, the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) descends into the Gulf of 

Cadiz as a density current, forming a turbulent flux 150 to 200 m wide and moves in 

contact with the seafloor along a channel within the Gibraltar gateway in a WSW direction, 

at a speed of more than 200 cm/s (Ambar and Howe, 1979a), locally reaching 300 cm/s 

(Mulder et al., 2003). The MO velocity is strongly affected by the bottom topography and 

it decreases as result of the friction with the seafloor and as the mixing with the ENACW 

diminishes the MW density anomaly. Most probably, this flux influences the site where 

methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) were identified and sampled in front of 

the Gibraltar Strait, and in which strong bottom currents were evident on the underwater 

video profiles (see description in section 4.4.3.3, of Chapter 4). Thereafter, the MO spreads 

westward into the Gulf of Cadiz and due to the Coriolis effect the MO is deflected to the 

right of its pathway, i.e. along the slope, rather than directly to the west. There it flows 

against the upper slope of the South Iberian margin, in a NW direction, along the MO 

Channel (Figure 3.11) where it flows as a strong bottom current and where the friction with 

the seabottom is an important process controlling the MO behaviour (Baringer and Price, 

1999). Due to horizontal variations of the outflow properties and as the upper and middle 

slope is characterized by a complex bottom topography with several canyons, plateau and 

mounds that steer the MO, these factors favour the splitting of the plume into several veins 

(Madelain, 1970; Zenk and Armi, 1990) and flows are distributed at constant depths along 

the Cadiz channel and Guadalquivir channel. Divergences of the MO from the main 

current direction, that flow down-slope are also observed such as the one that flows along 

the Gil Eanes channel (Figure 3.11). On its pathway, the MW gradually decreases its high 

thermohaline properties with the correspondent decrease in density, as it mixes with the 

surrounding fresher and colder ENACWt (Price et al., 1993; Price and Baringer, 1994). 

Until approximately the longitude of 8ºW, the MO behaves as a density current and from 

here it changes into a wall-bounded jet. Downstream from this area the MW reaches a 

density equilibrium with the surrounding ENACWt and the MO flows at mid-depths 

(Ambar et al., 1999). 

As the MO changes the direction from a westward direction to a north-westward 

direction (Figure 3.11) due to the Coriolis effect, it is divided into two main cores: the 



 

Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 69

Mediterranean Upper core - MU and the Mediterranean Lower core – ML (Madelain, 

1970; Ambar and Howe, 1979b; Gardner and Kidd, 1983; Zenk and Armi, 1990). 

 

 
Figure 3.11. General circulation pattern of the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) in the Gulf of Cadiz 

(Hernández-Molina et al., 2006). 

 

The MU upper core corresponds to the less dense core and is located between 500 

and 800 m depth and is characterized by a density of 27.6 (?0). Until Cape St. Vicente it is 

characterized by an average velocity of 46 cm/s, a mean temperature of 13.4ºC and salinity 

of 37.07 (Ambar et al., 1999).  

The ML is denser than the MU and corresponds to the main water flux of the MO in 

the Gulf of Cadiz. It is centred at about 1200 m depth and is characterized by a density of 

27.8 (?0). Between 6º20’W and 7ºW (Figure 3.11), the ML is divided into three minor 

branches that flow along different channels (Madelain, 1970; Nelson et al., 1993; García et 

al., 2003): the intermediate branch (IB), which flows north-westward along the Diogo Cão 

channel; the principal branch (PB), which is, at present, responsible for the main transport 

of the MO and flows south of the Guadalquivir Bank along the Guadalquivir channel; and 

the southern branch (SB), that flows along several steep valleys with an important flow 

along the Cadiz channel. 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 70 

A third core of the MW, not so conspicuous, with a shallower depth between 400 and 

600 m depth, was identified in the southern (Ambar, 1983) and western (Ambar, 1983; 

Hinrichsen et al., 1993) Portuguese coast, not extending further offshore than about 50 km. 

Mapping the thermohaline field and the sedimentary structures in the Northern 

margin of the Gulf of Cadiz have shown that the MO in general flows at the seabottom and 

has a strong erosional effect on the seafloor, especially to the East of Portimão Canyon (E 

of 8º30’W). It is proposed as a reference that the MO becomes neutrally buoyant and 

looses contact with the seafloor at 1000 m depth in the easternmost area and at 1400 m 

depth in the westernmost area (Baringer and Price, 1999). To the west of the Portimão 

canyon the margin becomes dominated by submarine valleys and canyons that strongly 

influence the MO current causing stronger instability (Chérubin et al., 2003), diverging 

and inducing the meandering of the MO, producing their offshore extension (Ambar and 

Howe, 1979a, b; Zenk and Armi, 1990) and giving origin to vortices or eddies of MW, the 

so-called meddies (Serra et al., 2005). Meddies generation is also promoted at the St. 

Vicente Promontory and Cape (Serra et al., 2005). The spreading of the MO is reinforced 

by the development of these meddies that detach from the Mediterranean undercurrent 

mass (Figure 3.12). The meddies play an important role in the dispersion of the 

Mediterranean water into the Atlantic (Armi and Zenk, 1984; Armi et al., 1989; 

Richardson et al., 1989; Serra et al., 2005) but also in the transport of particulate and 

dissolved matter (Freitas and Abrantes, 2002). 

Underneath the Mediterranean Water flows the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). 

In the Gulf of Cadiz the NADW flows southward, bellow 2000 m water depth. The 

NADW is a multiple-source water mass, characterized by a low stratification and with 

temperatures ranging from 4-8ºC, salinity values between 24.95 and 35.2 and a with high 

oxygen content (Emery and Meincke, 1986). 

The bottom water mass in the eastern Atlantic basin is the Antarctic Bottom Water 

(ABW) that circulates under the NADW at depths greater than 4000 m (Emery and 

Meincke, 1986) and that therefore does not have direct influence in the Gulf of Cadiz 

accretionary wedge region.

3.5.2 Brief overview of the paleoceanographic evolution of the MO 

The MO started with the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar at the end of the Miocene 

(Maldonado et al., 1999) but a similar to the present day oceanographic configuration was 

established after the global cooling event in the Late Pliocene at 2.4 Ma (Loubere, 1987; 

Thunell et al., 1991). This cooling event triggered a shift to more arid conditions and 

established a negative water balance in the Mediterranean and an anti-estuarine water 

exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Since 2.4 Ma the MO has 

undergone significant variations as the result of the climate and sea-level fluctuations 

(Nelson et al., 1993; Voelker et al., 2006). 

Recent paleoceanographic studies have concluded that global climate and 

oceanographic changes have caused vertical and spatial fluctuations of the MO in the Gulf 

of Cadiz. An enhancement of the MO occurred during cold periods when compared with 

the warmer periods (Cacho et al., 2000; Llave et al., 2006). It has been proposed that 



 

Chapter 3. Geodynamic and oceanographic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz 

 72 

during cool stages and low-stands of glacial sea level, the cross section at the Gibraltar 

Strait was reduced and the MO volume was lower than at present day conditions (Gardner 

and Kidd, 1983; Matthiesen and Haines, 2003). Such a setting may well have diminished 

the water exchange between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic but, the lower temperature 

and the generally dryer Mediterranean would result in a significantly higher salinity and 

density of the MW (Schonfeld, 1997; Cacho et al., 2000; Schonfeld and Zahn, 2000). This 

would then result in a more intense and deeper-flowing MO i.e. in a enhancement of the 

Lower core of the MO during cool low-sealevel periods (Thomson et al., 1999; Rogerson 

et al., 2005; Llave et al., 2006). During the warm periods of high sealevel the density of 

the MO would be lower than during the cold periods, and therefore the interaction of the 

upper MO cores would be more intense at shallower water depths (Thomson et al., 1999; 

Rogerson et al., 2005; Llave et al., 2006).

Chapter 4.   Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in 
the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to other fluid escape 

structures 

 

 

4.1 Introduction 

 

Fluid seepage structures are characterized by housing and sustaining unique 

consortia of benthic organisms (Suess et al., 1985; Olu et al., 1997; Sibuet and Olu, 1998; 

Levin, 2005), geochemical and geothermal anomalies in the seafloor sediments (Kastner et 

al., 1991; Wallmann et al., 1997; Henry et al., 2002; Henrys et al., 2003; Sassen et al., 

2003), formation of massive authigenic carbonates (Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et al., 

1987; Ritger et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., 

1992), methane plumes in the ocean column (Roberts and Aharon, 1994; Roberts, 2001; 

Greinert et al., 2002; Greinert and Nutzel, 2004; Greinert et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2006) 

and the occurrence of gas hydrates (Shipley and Didyk, 1982; Sassen et al., 2001a; Sassen 

et al., 2001b; Sassen et al., 2004). The occurrence of fluid escape processes at continental 

margins is now recognized as widespread in a variety of different marine settings and 

throughout the geological record (Campbell et al., 2002; Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). The 

nature and composition of the expelled fluids and materials from the fluid escape structures 

and mud volcanoes provides fundamental information on the geology and geochemistry of 

the deeper sediments. 

Fluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz (GC) were first reported in the shelf 

break and in the upper continental slope of the eastern-central part of the GC in areas 

covered by muddy sediments (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza et al., 1999). In the last 6 

years extensive work was carried out by several research groups with the objective to study 

the fluid escape structures and processes in the GC, specially within the middle and lower 

slope (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002; Somoza et al.,

2002; Van Rooij et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et 

al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Kopf et al., 2004; Depreiter et al., 2005; Henriet et al., 

2005; Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b; Rooij et al., 2005; Kenyon et 

al., 2006; Masson and Berndt, 2006). As a result, 41 mud volcanoes (confirmed by coring), 

with gas hydrates being recovered from 3 of them, as well as many other fluid escape 

features, were described and studied. Figure 4.1 illustrates the location of the mud 

volcanoes, mud cones and the occurrences of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

 
Figure 4.1. Location of the mud volcanoes and MDAC occurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz. Boxes indicate the 

main mud volcano fields defined in previous works and described in the text. 

 

Based on geophysical data, seafloor video observations and samples collected during 

the TTR10 (Leg 1), TTR11 (Leg 3), TTR12 (Leg 2), TTR14 (Leg 1), TTR15 (Leg 4) and 

TTR16 (Leg2) cruises (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively), 

complemented with data from the Anastasya 2000, Anastasya 2001 and GAP cruises, 

several areas have been shown to be characterized by the widespread occurrence of 

MDAC: (1) on the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge (GDR) and the Formosa Ridge (FR); (2) 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz

along several erosional features associated with the Mediterranean outflow (MO) on the 

Cadiz Channel; (3) on the Pen Duick Escarpment and the Vernadsky Ridge; (4) on some 

mud volcanoes and mud diapirs located on the pathway of the MO, Iberico, Faro, 

Hesperides, Student and Yuma (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalhães et al., 2002; Somoza et 

al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Pinheiro et 

al., 2004); (5) dense fields of MDAC were also discovered during the TTR14 cruise on the 

main channel of the MO in front of the Strait of Gibraltar (Magalhães et al., 2005; Kenyon 

et al., 2006); (6) the re-examination of samples collected during an earlier (1976) 

Hesperides cruise on the northern slope of the Guadalquivir Channel also showed the 

presence of similar dolomite chimneys; and (7) MDAC occurring as aragonite and calcite 

crusts and pavements, were also discovered and sampled, associated with the Pen Duick 

and the Vernadsky Ridges, within the Cadiz Channel and associated with several mud 

volcanoes: Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Fiuza, Darwin, Shouen, 

Adamastor, Meknes, Hesperides Faro and Porto (Figure 4.1). The present day survey 

coverage shows that fluid escape structures in the GC are far more common features than 

previously anticipated and they now have been found in many locations between 500 and 

4000 m water depth. 

As described in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC were identified in the 

collected samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: (i) dolomite-dominated carbonates and (ii) 

aragonite-dominated carbonates. The dolomite-dominated carbonates form crusts, irregular 

massive or nodular aggregates, and chimneys (fluid conduits or filled burrows) with 

tubular or pipe-like morphologies. The aragonitic MDAC occur as pavements, crusts or 

slabs that pave the seafloor for several square meters, or form buildups and irregular 

blocks, up to 2 m high, at the seabottom. 

The geological characteristics of the seafloor at the several fluid escape structures is 

highly variable and is a function of the rate and duration of the seepage episodes as well as 

the nature and composition of the material (solid, fluid and gas) expelled (Roberts, 2001). 

In this Chapter will be presented a synthesis of the different geophysical, visual, 

geochemical and mineralogical data collected from fluid escape structures where MDAC 

have been identified. It is discussed the superficial geology, and to a lesser extent biology, 

related to the fluid escape structures where MDAC were found. It is also discussed the 

relationship between the seafloor morphology, the seafloor acoustic facies (SSS 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures

reflectivity) and the nature of the seafloor recognised from underwater video profiles and 

from the samples retrieved by tv-controlled grab, dredging and gravity coring. A 

relationship between the occurrences of the authigenic carbonates and other fluid escape 

structures, such as mud volcanoes and mud cones, is postulated and the controls of their 

occurrence is investigated. Another objective of this chapter is to assess the intensity of the 

upward fluid migration, the dynamics and the morphology of the seepage structures and to 

relate them with the different observed seafloor features and products. 

 

 

4.2 Methods 

4.2.1 Positioning systems 

Positioning during the TTR cruises was obtained with an Ashtech GG24 DPS + 

GLONASS receiver, allowing an optimal static accuracy of ± 35 cm (75 cm at 95% 

confidence limits). The normal accuracy in the Gulf of Cadiz area, under normal satellite 

configuration, is assumed to be ca. 5 m. Navigation on board the D. Carlos I (Matespro and 

Delila 1 cruises), Sonne, Cornide de Saavedra and Belgica research ships was obtained 

using both Global Positioning System (GPS) and Differential Global Positioning System 

(DGPS), installed in one or in multiple positions of the vessel. The two systems were used 

in order to obtain the necessary accuracy in position determination, as well as the 

necessary yaw corrections to be used by the multibeam systems. 

Underwater navigation during deep-towed operations onboard the RV Professor 

Logachev, such as with deep-towed side-scan sonar (MAK1 and OREtech), the deep-

towed video system and the TV-controlled grab were based on the Sigma-1001 hydro-

acoustic system. This system consists on a pinger fitted to the deep-towed equipment, 

operating between 7-15 kHz, and four stationary hull-mounted acoustic receivers, spaced 

14 m apart. The signal emitted by the deep-towed pinger is tracked on board and accurate 

x,y position of the device is computed in relation to the vessel, taking into account the 

vessel roll, trim and speed. The error of the estimated position of the deep-towed 

equipment by this system usually does not exceed 1-2% of the water depth. 

During the GAP cruise, on board the R/V Sonne, underwater navigation for the 

Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS) and of the TV-controlled grab was similar to the 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 77

one used onboard the RV Professor Logachev. Given the inferior number of acoustic 

receivers and their closer separation the precision on the underwater determination on 

board the RV Sonne was less accurate than the one achieved with the RV Professor 

Logachev. 

For gravity corer seabed sampling, the error in positioning is normally 5% of the 

accuracy of the vessel position, due to the rapid deployment. 

Detailed descriptions of the positioning systems are presented in Appendix A. 

 

4.2.2 Seafloor sampling 

The seafloor samples used for this work were collected during several cruises (TTR 

09, TTR 10, TTR 11, TTR 12, TTR 14, TTR15, TTR16, Anastasya 2000, Anastasya 2001 

and GAP) using several devices (gravity corer, box corer, multi-corer, Kasten corer, 

dredge, grab, and video controlled grab). Sediment sample descriptions from other cruises 

were also used when available and relevant for this study. Detailed descriptions of the 

sampling devices are presented in Appendix A. 

 

4.2.3 Underwater observations 

Underwater observations during the TTR cruises were carried out with an underwater 

video cameras (analogical or digital), with a video controlled grab (during the TTR and the 

GAP cruises) and with the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS, GAP cruise). Detailed 

descriptions of these systems are presented in Appendix A. 

 

4.2.4 Side-scan sonar mapping 

Side-scan sonar mapping was performed with the NRL Seamap long range side-scan 

sonar, a low frequency 12 KHz system, and with the OKEAN system, which operates at a 

frequency of 9.5 kHz. Both systems have fairly similar resolutions. When no other 

coverage was available and in areas with multibeam coverage, the backscatter imagery 

from the EM12 swath bathymetry system was used. 

High resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar imagery (MAK-1M or OREtech) was 

also acquired in areas of detailed investigations. Both MAK and OREtech systems were 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 78 

used on board the R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR cruises. They are both 

equipped with a subbottom profiler, operating at a frequency of 5 kHz. The maximum 

swath coverage is 2 km (1 km per side) for a towing altitude of 150 m above the seafloor, 

operating at a frequency of 30 kHz, and about 50 m above the seafloor for 100 kHz 

surveys. The resolution of the system rages from 7 to 1 m across and along the track.  

Detailed descriptions of both systems are given in Appendix A. 

 

 

4.3 Results: Geological and geophysical cartography 

 

Based on the underwater video observations several bottom facies have been defined 

and mapped. Whenever possible, these facies were calibrated with sampling information. 

The main bottom facies defined were: 

1. Pelagic sediments 

2. Rippled pelagic sediments 

3. Unrippled pelagic sediments 

4. Sediment clogged dead coral framework 

5. Live-coral covered sediments 

6. Coral rubble, dense coverage of mostly dead coral 

7. Paches of mainly dead coral 

8. Rock outcrops 

9. Mud volcano mud breccia 

10. Sediment covered with pogonophora tube worms  

11. Sediment covered with clams and clam fields 

12. Bacterial mat 

13. MDAC chimney fields: chimneys, pipelike or conduits, corresponding most 

probably to the dolomitic crusts, chimneys and nodules 

14. MDAC pavements and buildups: most probably correspond to the aragonitic 

pavements mineralogies 

15. Gas bubbles 

16. Gas hydrate patches

The underwater video profiles were interpreted and each segment of about 1 minute 

was classified according to the dominant seabottom facies classification defined above. 

The facies classification was then plotted on the navigation and correlated with other 

seafloor information as the backscatter intensity and collected samples. 

Four main areas or fields of fluid escape structures have been defined for the Gulf of 

Cadiz (Figure 4.1): (1) the Deep Portuguese Margin Field (DPF); (2) the Guadalquivir 

Diapiric Ridge Field (GDRF); (3) the Tasyo Field; and (4) the Morocco Margin Field - 

MMF (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2001, 2002, 2003). The latter 

was further subdivided into the West MMF, the Central MMF and he East MMF (Gardner, 

2001). More recently, the Eastern MMF was defined as the El Arraiche Mud Volcano 

Field, which includes the Al Isidri, Mercator Fiuza, Don Quichote, Gemini, Kidd, 

Lazarilho de Tornes and Adamastor mud volcanoes, and the Vernadsky and the Pen Duick 

ridges (Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b). 

The middle slope of the northern central part of the Gulf of Cadiz corresponds to the 

GDRF (Figure 4.2) where the MDAC were first identified and sampled (Diaz-del-Rio et 

al., 2001; Somoza et al., 2002). The GDRF is characterized by several regionally important 

diapiric ridges: the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge (GDR), the Cadiz Ridge (CDR), the 

Hormigas Ridge (HR) and the Formoza Ridge (FR). The GDR, CDR, HR and FR are 

interpreted as diapiric ridges resulting from lateral compression and by the pressing up of 

the plastic marly clay deposits (blue marls) of the front units of the Early-Middle Miocene 

pre-olistostrome units, unit M1 of Maldonado et al. (1999), of the front of the 

olistostrome/accretionary complex (Somoza et al., 2003). Several fluid escape structures, 

such as mud volcanoes, mud mounds with high abundance of MDAC and pockmarks were 

identified in the GDR. Based on the multibeam bathymetry and geophysical information, 

specific target areas were selected for detailed underwater video observation and sampling. 

Such areas include several mud volcanoes, mud cones, diapiric ridges and high reflectivity 

areas in side-scan sonar backscatter, such as the Iberico and the Cornide mud cones; the 

FR, the Coruña cone of the GDR; on the Cadiz Channel E of Lolita and at the Cadiz 

Channel W of the Iberico. These areas are described above in more detail. 

The Tasyo MV Field (Somoza et al., 2003) is located south of the GDR and 

corresponds to the Central Gulf of Cadiz. In this area MDAC were identified associated 

with the Hesperides, Faro, Cibeles and Almazan MVs. 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 80 

In the southern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, the Morocco Margin Field (MMF) is 

characterized by large mud volcanoes, ridges and fault escarpments. MDAC were 

identified and collected along the Pen Duick and the Vernarsky ridges and escarpments 

and on the Darwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Baraza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, 

Shouen and Student mud volcanoes. 

In the DPF, which includes the Carlos Ribeiro, Olenin, Bomboca, Bonjardim, 

Semenovich, Soloviev, Carlos Teixeira and Porto mud volcanoes, until present, MDAC 

were only identified in the Porto mud volcano, although heir presence in other sites cannot 

be excluded. 

 

4.3.1 MDAC occurrences in the GDR Field and their relationship with 

mud volcanoes and mud cones 

MDAC were identified on mud cones and mud volcanoes (MV) along two parallel 

linear ridges clearly evident in the bathymetry (Figure 4.2): along the Guadalquivir 

Diapiric Ridge (GDR) and along the Formoza Ridge (FR). 

Other prominent diapiric ridge, the Cadiz Diapiric Ridge (CDR) which range from 

370 to 700 m water depth have a relief of 250 to 300 m high and up to 4500 m wide and 

extends for 27 km with a NNE-SSW orientation (Figure 4.2) was not investigated for the 

occurrences of MDAC. 

4.3.1.1 Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge 

The GDR crest is located between 380 and 940 m water depth, have an overage relief 

of 250 m, up to 4000 m wide and extends for 85 km with an NE-SW orientation (Figure 

4.2). The area close to the GDR exhibit several features witch their bathymetric expression 

indicated to be mud volcanoes (Somoza et al., 2003). Ground-truthing of some of these 

structures confirmed their mud volcanic nature. Therefore, the Anastasya, Tarsis and 

Pipoca MV were confirmed in the northern end of the GDR by the presence of mud 

breccia, sediments with high gas content and strong H2S smell in gravity cores (Somoza et 

al., 2003). Similar sediment characteristics were recorded from gravity cores in the Gades 

MV, located at the northern termination of the FR (Somoza et al., 2003). In the GDR, 

MDAC were identified and sampled from the Coruña mud cone (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; 

Somoza et al., 2003; León et al., 2006).

4.3.1.1.1 Coruña mud cone 

The Coruña mud cone was surveyed during the Anastasya campaign in 2001. This 

area was investigated with multibeam, seismics, underwater seabottom photography and 

dredging (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; León et al., 2006). 

The Coruña is an asymmetric cone shaped mound with a relief of 233 m with 

asymmetric flanks and slope gradients up to 24º (Figure 4.5A). The mound summit s 

located at 830 m water depth (Figure 4.4A). The bathymetry and the backscatter imagery 

do not show any structures at the mound summit, nor any moat or mud flows. The NRL 

Seamap side-scan sonar shows a highly reflectivity surface (Figure 4.4B), similar to the 

backscatter reflectivity of the remaining GDR, with high acoustic reflectivity at the ridge 

summit and on the flanks, contrasting with the lower reflectivity characteristic of the 

sedimentary contourite deposits like the ones north of the GDR (compare the contourite 

deposit, c.a. shot point 1200 in profile Psat-125 with the low backscatter reflectivity on the 

NRL Seamap, in Figure 4.4B, corresponding to the basin north of the Coruña mound). The 

seismic profile Psat-215 (Figure 4.5B) illustrates the typical seismic character of chaotic 

reflectors and transparent facies typical of the GDR, compared with the coherent reflectors 

of the contiguous sediments. The GDR shows a strong seafloor reflection that is interpreted 

as being caused by the high abundance of MDAC.

sedimentary basin sequences to the W. 

 

The dredge ANA2001-DA15 allowed the collection of MDAC samples dominated 

by dolomite chimneys and slabs (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003). Plastic mud and blue marls 

clasts were also retrieved from the Coruña mound. The blue marls were interpreted as 

being of Early-Middle Miocene age and associated with the tectonic compression of the 

wedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary complex (Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et 

al., 2001; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003). Fragments of corals were also retrieved from this 

dredge. 

 

4.3.1.1.2 Profile in the GDR North of the Coruña mud cone 

A profile of underwater TV across the GDR was collected during the TTR11 cruise. 

The interpretation of the seafloor observations are illustrated in Figure 4.6. This profile 

started in middle slope of the northern flank of the GDR, crossed the ridge summit and 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 84 

descended along the southern flank to the base of the Cadiz Channel. The northern flank, 

the summit and the top part of the southern flank (at a water depth of 880 m) is 

characterized by outcropping of well lithified rocks with evident parallel bedding, with 

absent or very thin pelagic sediment drape. The stratification appears to be sub-vertical and 

the sedimentary rocks are dominated by claystones. Abundant sub-rounded clasts, probably 

fragments of the outcropping rocks are found along the slope. In the southern flank, above 

880 m water depth the seafloor is characterized by a sedimentary cover dominated by 

sandy sediments with ripples and sand waves. These sedimentary facies are interpreted as 

corresponding to the contourite deposits resultant from the MO that flows with a strong 

velocity at the seafloor along the southern flank of the GDR and along the Cadiz Channel. 

During the video observations, especially along the southern flank of the GDR, a strong 

current could be observed from the movement of particles put in suspension by the video 

camera. Clasts of the outcropping material found scattered on the sandy sediment are 

interpreted as fragments from the upper slope that rolled downwards. In the mid slope a 

patch of coral debris was found, about one hundred meters long. This patch is 

characterized by a dense coverage of coral rubble, composed of abundant fragments of 

coral branches (dead coral; no live coral was positively identified) that partially cover by 

sediments. In this patch some gastropods were also identified and fragments of not yet 

identified shells.

4.3.1.2 Formoza Ridge 

The Formoza Ridge (FR) crest is located between 925 and 980 m water depth 

(Figure 4.7). The average relief is of about 100 m high, up to 2500 m wide and extends for 

8.5 km with an NE-SW orientation (Figure 4.7). The FR is characterized by the presence of 

a through or erosional channel at the base of the north flank. This channel is most probably 

erosional in origin and most probably results from the erosional effect of the outflow of the 

MO. 

Ridges and lineations with this NE-SW orientation are frequently observed in the 

northern part of the GC. The FR has a NE-SW trend and its prolongation to the south of 

the Cadiz Channel is visible in Figure 4.7, being offset by a section of the Cadiz Channel 

that has a linear and strait walls oriented in a NW-SE conjugate trend.

Ridge, Iberico mud cone, the Cadiz Channel and the Lolita structure. Also shown in the figure the seismic 

lines, underwater TV observation profiles and samples collected in this area which were used for this study.

 86 

During the TTR12 cruise (Kenyon et al., 2003) one underwater TV line (TTR-TV-

AT-29) was collected and samples were retrieved by dredging (TTR12-AT-389D) and 

with a TV-controlled grab (TTR12-388Gr) on the southern end on the FR (Figure 4.7). The 

TV line video observation started from the north towards the SW along the northern flank 

of the southern termination of the Formoza ridge, in an area of strong acoustic backscatter 

(Figure 4.9), and continued along the small crest between the depressions that delimit the 

ridge. The profile is dominated by the occurrence of MDAC at the seafloor, as pipe-like 

structures or chimneys that are broken and lies on the seafloor, as illustrated in Figure 

4.11(A-C). In general, these chimneys are intensely fragmented and accompanied by 

rubble of small fragments of broken chimneys. The chimneys have variable sizes, up to 2 

meters long and up to about 0.5 m in diameter. Some of them have clear open central 

orifices while others are completely filled, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(B-C) and also 

recognised on the samples retrieved and described in Chapter 5. The chimneys are 

intensely colonized by benthic fauna of sessile organisms like sponges, sea urchins, 

Cidaridae and Asterinidae sea stars. Live corals were not collected from this site but some 

probable individual colonies were identified on the video observations occurring over 

some chimneys. Chimneys in the vertical position, protruding from the seafloor, like the 

one illustrated in Figure 4.11C were identified, but this occurrence is much less frequent 

that the occurrence of the chimneys lying on the seafloor. The chimneys in the vertical 

position also show strong colonization by benthic fauna and their colour and characteristics 

indicate that they do not represent active venting structures but are interpreted instead as 

representing fossil venting conduits, inactive for a long time. In some of them it was 

possible to recognise that at the foot of some vertical chimneys there were often linear 

pipe-like chimneys lying on the seafloor and aligned, indicating that they represent a 

longer chimneys that has fall down and broken into several fragments. On this profile it 

was also possible to recognise a strong bottom current, with velocities of 1-2 m/s, 

estimated from the movement of suspended particles. These bottom currents were also 

evident from the movement of some of the benthic fauna that bent due to the current, and 

also from the cable that was hanging from the TV frame that was sometimes bent in a 

different direction from that of the movement of the camera. The strong bottom current 

was interpreted as sufficient to remobilise the unconsolidated sediments, resulting in active 

erosion of the soft sediments and to promote the exhumation of the MDAC to the seafloor. 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 87

The slope gradients along the ridge promoted the remobilization of the MDAC and their 

consequent fragmentation. 

 
Figure 4.8. Bathymetry, with a slope gradient and a hillshade with illumination from the NW, of the southern 

termination of the Formoza Ridge with the location of the dredge, TV-grab and underwater video observation 

profile collected during the TTR12. 

 

Pavements, crusts and irregular buildups were identified on the video observations, 

sometimes occurring simultaneous with the chimneys and MDAC rubble. The pavements 

(illustrated in Figure 4.11D-F) occur as thin (several cm thick) crusts that can extend for 

several square meters, paving the seafloor or occurring as fragmented slabs. These 

pavements show a coarse texture interpreted as resulting from the incorporation of shells 

and fragments of shells in the cemented crust. Their surface was in general irregular with 

irregular contours. Compared to the chimneys, the pavements exhibit less intense 

colonization of benthic fauna, which is interpreted as indicating a smaller period of contact 

with the seawater (probably also a younger age). 

The chimneys and crusts were found, in general, within coarse sediments, sometimes 

with a high amount of shell fragments and frequently characterized by ripples and 

decimetre size sand waves (Figure 4.12G-I). In some places, in the northern flank of the 

ridge and along the crest south of the ridge, outcrops of lithified rock were observed, 

probably claystone, interpreted as corresponding most probably to the blue marls of Early-



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 88 

Middle Miocene age, not sampled at this site but sampled along the GDR and in the 

Iberico mud cone (Somoza et al., 2001). Some chimneys and pavements were also found 

on these outcrop sites, but it was not clear that the chimneys and crusts were formed within 

these rocks. It is possible that the chimneys and crusts were remobilized to these sites by 

bottom currents and through gravity flows from other sites upslope.

4.3.1.3 Hormigas Ridge 

The southern termination of the GDR is marked by the Coruña mound (Figure 4.14). 

To the southwest of the GDR, between 7º41’W and 7º33’W, the bottom topography is 

characterized by an arcuate-shaped ridge that defines the northern boundary of the Cadiz 

Channel (Figure 4.14). This arcuate-shapped ridge, called Hormigas Ridge (Díaz-del-Río 

et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003), is characterized by the presence of a series of mounds 

from which Iberico, Cornide and Arcos exhibit the highest relieves and strongest acoustic 

backscatter reflectivity on the NRL Seamap imagery. 

The Iberico mud cone was surveyed during the TTR11 and Anastasya campaigns and 

the Cornide, Arcos and Coruña were surveyed during the Anastasya campaigns. The 

surveys of these structures included seismics, deep towed side-scan sonar, underwater 

observations and sampling with dredges (Kenyon et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; 

Somoza et al., 2003). 

These mounds (Iberico, Cornide, Arcos and Coruña) are characterized by the 

occurrence of MDAC, dominated by dolomite chimneys (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003) as 

illustrated in Figure 4.20, which occur as dense fields that cover most of the structures 

area.

arrows). 

 

4.3.1.3.1 Iberico 

The Iberico mud cone has a conical, asymmetric morphology (Figure 4.15), with a 

triangular section shape. Their summit is located at 874 m water depth and it is 156 m high 

in relation to the surrounding ridge in which it is located. The diameter of the cone ranges 

from 1200 to 1700 m. The southward and the eastward flanks have the steepest gradients, 

up to 26.7º, while the northward flank has slopes of 8 to 17º (Figure 4.16). The summit of 

the cone does not show any particular distinct feature from the flanks. 

Iberico is located on the western end of the Hormigas ridge that borders the northern 

limit of the Cadiz MO Channel. In relation to the ridge morphology, the Iberico mount is 

bordered in the southern flank by a 40 m depression or moat (feature Ms marked by the 

white dashed line in Figure 4.18B). The northern flank is also borded by a larger and 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 93

deeper depression where a smaller asymmetrical depression, a pockmark, or an erosional 

scour hole is observed on both the bathymetry and the MAK side-scan sonar imagery 

(feature P1 and P2 in Figure 4.18A). 

The seafloor reflection of the Iberico mound is higher than the seafloor reflection of 

the surrounding sediments. While the acoustic penetration obtained with the used system, 

in the Iberico and within the ridge area, was not sufficient to discriminate the nature and 

dimensions of the contact between the feeder channel under the Iberico and the 

surrounding sedimentary sequence, it is possible to distinguish the chaotic and indistinct 

seismic reflection pattern under the Iberico from the stratified host sediment reflectors 

(Figure 4.17). 

 
Figure 4.15. 3D bathymetric morphology of the Iberico mud cone. (A) view from SW of Iberico. (B) view 

from NE of the Iberico. 

 

In the Iberico mud cone several samples (as illustrated in Figure 4.20) were collected 

by dredging along the south flank during the TTR11 cruise (sample TTR11-335D, with the 

position of this dredge plotted by the black arrow in Figure 4.18A) and during the Ana00-

DA10 dredge (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003) from the Anastasya 2000 cruise (ship navigation 

corresponds to the yellow line in Figure 4.18A). Both dredges allowed the collection of 

large number of MDAC of dolomite-dominated chimneys and dolomite-dominated crusts 

(the study of these samples is described in Chapter 5). Plastic mud and blue marls clasts 

were also retrieved from these dredges. The blue marls have been interpreted as being of 

Early-Middle Miocene age and expressing the wedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary 

complex (Somoza et al., 2001; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003).

The Iberico mud cone exhibits a strong but differential acoustic backscatter on the 

NRL 12 kHz Seamap side-scan sonar imagery and also on the deep-towed high resolution 

30 kHz MAK profile TTR11-42 (Figure 4.18B). The southern and the northern flanks of 

the cone are characterized by a strong backscatter but with distinctive patterns. While the 

southern flank and the upper part of the northern flank (area highlighted by the yellow 

dashed line in Figure 4.18B) are characterized by a very strong backscatter with an 

homogeneous pattern, which is interpreted as corresponding to areas recovered by MDAC 

(pictures A and C from Figure 4.19) the northern and the western lower slopes of the 

mound are characterized by a strong backscatter with sharp, near parallel shadows 

interpreted as indicating rock outcrops with bedding faulting and folding (area highlighted 

by the brown dashed line in Figure 4.18B). To the eastern of the mound, the side-scan 

sonar images show a weaker reflectivity that, also according to the seafloor observations, is 

interpreted as corresponding to pelagic sediment cover with sand waves and sand ribbons 

with absence of MDAC. To the W off the Iberico the seafloor is characterized by sediment 

drift deposits (as observed on the 5 kHz MAK profiler). 

On the Iberico mud cone two underwater video camera lines (TTR11-TV-18 and 

TTR11-TV-19) were carried out during the TTR11 cruise (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalhães 

et al., 2005). Profile TTR11-TV-18 was acquired from E to W, approximately at a constant 

depth, along the mid slope of the northern flank of the mud cone. The profile initially 

showed a seafloor covered by pelagic oxidized sediments, with scattered occurrence of 

fragments of carbonate clasts and some scarce chimneys and coral debris. This portion of 

the profile corresponds to an intermediate backscatter reflectivity in the MAK SSS. A 

larger occurrence of coral debris was observed when a water depth of 960 m was reached 

and from there on the profile was characterized by an almost continuous occurrence of 

chimneys, most of them very fragmented and lying broken at the seafloor, as illustrated in 

Figure 4.19A. When approaching the base of the cone, the occurrence of carbonate 

chimneys becomes less frequent and then pelagic sediment with scarce fragments of 

chimneys and scarce clasts, similar to the observed at the beginning of this profile is 

observed.

Profile TTR11-TV-19 was acquired from the base of the moat in the southern flank 

to the middle of the northern flank of the Iberico mud cone, crossing the cone summit. All 

along the profile the seafloor was characterized by high density of chimneys and crusts as 

illustrated in Figure 4.19B. At the summit and at the top of the S flank, close to the 

summit, the seafloor was characterized by the presence of coral debris. No live coral was 

positively identified and only died coral rubble was observed. The Northern flank, 

similarly to the southern flank, was covered by chimneys and crusts, most of them 

fragmented and lying at the seafloor. Chimneys in a vertical position, protruding from the 

seafloor as illustrated in Figure 4.19B1 was very rare to be observed.

4.3.1.3.2 Cornide 

Cornide is a cone shaped mound with a maximum basal diameter of 1.8 km and 220 

m high in relation to the base of the Cadiz channel. It has SW and SE steep slopes with 

gradients up to 25º, and smooth northern flanks. The top of the mound is located at 920 m 

water depth and the summit of the mound has a smoothed conical shaped where no 

collapse rims are evident. On this mound no structures typical of a mud volcano edifice, 

evidencing mud flows are found (Figure 4.21). On the NRL Seamap side-scan sonar 

imagery the Cornide is characterized by very strong backscatter intensity on the steep 

slopes and on its summit. The northern smooth flanks are characterized by a moderate 

backscatter intensity (Figure 4.22). 

During the Anastasya campaigns, two dredge sampling stations were carried out on 

Cornide. Dredge ANA01-Dr01 was acquired along the summit and top of the eastern flank 

and allowed the collection of crusts and chimneys similar to the ones collected on the 

Iberico mud cone. Dredge ANA01-Dr02 was acquired along the western and northern 

flanks, crossing the top of the mound, west of the summit. This dredge, like the previous 

ones allowed the collection of pipe-like dolomite chimneys and slabs, and clasts of blue 

marls (Somoza et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003) similar to the ones collected on the 

Iberico mud cone. On the cone summit, a gravity core allowed the identification of mud 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 99

sediment with a strong H2S smell, an high vacuolization of the sediment, interpreted as 

indicating a high gas content in the core, but no mud breccia typical of mud volcanoes was 

positively identified (Diaz del Rio et al., 2001). 

Underwater photographs taken during the Anastasya 2001 campaign also allowed 

recognizing that the summit of the Cornide was covered by pipe-like chimneys with a 

similar aspect to the underwater pictures from the Formoza ridge and from the Iberico cone 

(Somoza et al., 2002). 

On the Cornide summit, heat flow stations were also performed allowing the measure 

of a seabottom sediment temperature of 12ºC and the estimation of a thermal gradient of 

23.68, an heat flow value of 29.34 (mW/m2) and a conductivity of 1.239 W/m-K (Gardner 

et al., 2001). The heat flow data revealed fluctuations in the upper meters of the sediment 

column (Figure 4.23) reflecting short term bottom water temperature changes of the order 

of less than a year. From the estimated thermal gradient, Gardner et al. (2001) estimated a 

gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) with a thickness of 125 m at 1052 m water depth.

conductivity and heat flux (Gardner et al., 2001). To be noted the temperature anomaly recorded in the first 

meter of sediments, interpreted as the result of short term fluctuations of the anomalously high temperature of 

the MO. 

 

During the Anastasya 2001 campaign a dredge (ANA01-Dr03) was also performed 

across the Hormigas ridge between Cornide and Arcos mounds (Figure 4.21). The dredge 

did not allow the collection of any material as the cable broke during the retrievement of 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 101

the dredge, due to excess of loading of the dredge container. However, underwater 

photography from this area allowed the recognition of carbonate chimneys and crusts, 

similar to the ones from Cornide. 

4.3.1.3.3 Arcos 

On the northern termination of the Hormigas ridge, the Arcos mound is characterized 

by an irregular topography with a height of 100 m relative to the base of the Cadiz channel 

and steep gradient slopes. The summit of the Hormigas ridge in this area exhibits crests 

with an irregular linear shape and with horizontal steps to the north flank that intercalate 

the ridge crest (Figure 4.21). This area is characterized by strong backscatter on the NRL 

Seamap side-scan sonar imagery (Figure 4.22) and 3 dredge profiles were acquired in this 

area during the Anastasya 2001 cruise. Dredges ANA01-Dr18 and 19 allowed the 

recovering of crusts and chimneys, similar to the ones collected in Formoza, Iberico and 

Cornide. During the Dredge ANA01-Dr19 clasts of blue marls and limestones were also 

collected, which were interpreted as corresponding to fragments of rock outcrops. 

 

4.3.2 The Tasyo Field 

The Tasyo Field is considered to be delimited to the north by the southern edge of 

the Cadiz Channel and its southern limit is defined by the Captain Arutyunov and the Atlas 

mud volcanoes. The morphology of the Tasyo Field area is characterized by the 

interfingering of several distinct processes. Several fluid escape structures, such as mud 

volcanoes and pockmarks can be distinguished on the bathymetry and sonar backscatter. 

This area is dominated by erosional and sedimentary features related to the outflow of the 

Mediterranean water. On its eastern sector, within the main Channel of the MO, there is a 

dominance of proximal scour and ribbon features with abrasive surfaces with rock 

outcrops, sand dunes and sand ribbon fields. Outside of the main Channel of the MO, the 

overflow sedimentary lobe sector is characterized by the presence of mud waves and 

erosive scours, seafloor slides, mud waves fields, contouritic levees and overflow MO 

channels and furrows (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003; Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006). 

This sector is also characterized by large negative depressions, some of which resemble 

scars of sediment slides that transport material towards the lower slope and to the 

Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. Intra-slope mini-basins with a diameter of 800 - 4000 m are also 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 102 

observed in this area. 

In the Tasyo Field, the Hesperides, Cibeles, Faro and Almazan mud volcanoes were 

investigated in detail for the occurrence of MDAC. 

4.3.2.1 Hesperides 

The Hesperides mud volcano (Figure 4.24) is the largest mud volcanic structure 

identified in the Tasyo Field (Somoza et al., 2003). It has a complex morphology with six 

single cone-shaped domes (labelled C 1 to C6 in Figure 4.24), with diameters ranging from 

400 m to 1.1 km. These cones sit over a small plateau that defines the mud volcano 

complex and has a total seafloor diameter of about 3 km (Figure 4.24). The global shape of 

the complex is irregular, but most of the cones exhibit a regular symmetrical conical shape 

(Figure 4.24). The summits of the complex range from 685 to 740 m water depth, and have 

a maximum height of 75 m (c.a. for the cone C1) in relation to the plateau and about 200 m 

in relation to the surrounding seafloor. The Hesperides MV has slopes with smooth 

gradients, up to 16º but in general less than 10º within the plateau (Figure 4.25A). Nearby 

of the MV complex, it is possible to identify several depressions or mini-basins on the 

bathymetry, up to 2.4 km wide (structure B1 in Figure 4.24). It is also possible to identify 

low-relief sub-circular depressions, some of which have a small positive relief at their base 

(e.g. structure P1 in Figure 4.24), which are interpreted as possible pockmarks. 

The Seamap imagery of the complex exhibits strong acoustic backscatter intensity 

over some of the cones (C1, C2, C5 and C6) and moderate backscatter over the remaining 

plateau area, with a stronger intensity at the summits of the C3 and C4 cones (Figure 4.26). 

This is also confirmed by the acoustic seismic seafloor reflection of the parametric 

parasound, 5 kHz profiler and even by the single channel seismic profile TTR10-Psat155 

over the Hesperides complex, which exhibits a strong surface reflectivity (Figure 4.25B). 

On the seismic profiles, the subsurface under the MV is characterized by a non-reflective 

transparent facies with chaotic reflectors, typical of the mud volcanic nature of the 

structure (Figure 4.25B). From the seismic reflection profile it is also possible to recognise 

that the MV emplacement produced a deformation of the adjacent contourites, producing 

low amplitude folds of the adjacent host sediments, SE of the MV. 

Two underwater video profiles with Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS) were 

acquired on the Hesperides MV during the GAP cruise (Kopf et al., 2004). OFOS 16 and 

OFOS 17 crossed this complex from NE to SW and from S-N respectively (Figure 4.24).

The profile OFOS 16 began at the foot of the flank of cone C6, and showed gravel 

horizons interbedded with mud, interpreted as outcrops of older mud-breccia flows. 

Chimney fragments and carbonated rubble were also found scattered on the mud sediments 

but sometimes they occurred as dense patches on the seafloor. The chimneys and boulders 

occur fragmented, laid on the seafloor, colonized by benthic fauna, similar to those 

observed in the Iberico, Cornide or Formoza. Some larger boulders also occur. In the slope, 

rising through a broad plateau at the easternmost portion of the complex, in between the 

cones C5 and C6, this gently sloping plateau is characterized by the occurrence of scattered 

carbonate clasts within rippled sandy and muddy patches. At the central crest between the 

cones C1 and C5, this summit region is characterized by vast carbonate slabs with some 

scattered carbonate chimneys. Tubes of Pogonophora sp. were observed overlying the 

carbonate slabs and small bubbles coming up from some fissures were observed in this

area during the GAP cruise, but to date there is no confirmation of such venting. This area 

was the target of TV grab Station GeoB 9024, which allowed the collection of considerable 

amounts of carbonate crusts and slabs with numerous interbeded bivalves (Figure 4.30A-

B). Numerous sessile organisms such as small corals, brachiopods, small sponges, were 

attached to carbonate crusts. As the track descends to the western flank of the cone into the 

depression between the crest and cone C4, only scattered carbonate crusts and muddy 

patches were observed. This depression is characterized by pelagic sediment, with sand 

and gravel, probably fragments of carbonats that roll downslope, and mud breccia clasts. 

Along the upper slope and summit of cone C4, chimneys and carbonate rubble and 

boulders were again observed at the seafloor of mud breccia-like sediment (as confirmed 

by the gravity core ANA00-Gc12, Figure 4.31). Patches of coral debris were also 

observed. The southwestern flank of cone C4 is characterized by the dominance of mud 

breccia sediments alternating with patches of sand and gravel. Carbonate fragments occur 

very rarely. This facies is also characteristic of the northeastern flank of cone C3. Near and 

at the summit of C3 the seafloor is characterized by the occurrence of scattered clasts, 

probably of mud breccia clasts. The southwestern flank of C3 is characterized by mud 

breccia-type sediments (as confirmed by the gravity cores ANA00-Gr10, ANA00-Gr11, 

GeoB 9019 and GeoB 9019; Figure 4.31) with occurrence of slabs and crusts, large 

carbonate boulders, small patches of fragmented shells and fields of gastropods, some of 

these patches of gastropods; extend for about 10 m. Coral debris were also found along this 

slope. At the base of the Hesperides plateau, close to the end of this profile, the seafloor is 

characterized by sandy sediments, sometimes with ripples.

OFOS 17 began at the northernmost flank of the Hesperides mud volcano complex. 

The seafloor was covered by a high density of carbonate chimneys, lying broken on the 

seafloor and highly fragmented. The northern flank of the cone C5 is characterized mainly 

by muddy areas with patches of rippled sands and scattered carbonate crusts and chimneys. 

The summit of cone C5 and the crest between cones C5 and C1 is characterized by a dense 

coverage by carbonate pavements and crusts. This OFOS crossed the previous profile at 

the crest confirming the previous observation of abundant tubes of Pogonophora sp. tube 

worms. At the northern flank of cone C1 and at the summit, patches of coral debris were 

observed but the summit of C1 is characterized by extensive fields of pavements and 

carbonate crusts, sampled by TV-controlled grab at stations GeoB 9022 and GeoB 9023 

(samples are illustrated in Figure 4.30). The summit of C1 is characterized by the 

occurrence of extensive coverage of deep water coral, forming reef-like patches. A patch 

of this coral debris was sampled with TV grab GeoB 9022 (Figure 4.30). It consists of dead 

coral rubble with small broken coral pieces and coral branches up to 30 cm in length and 

probably originating from species such as Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, and 

Desmophyllum. Several gastropods, brachiopods and small hydrozoa were found attached

 107

to the dead coral pieces. Some small living coral species settled on the dead coral branches 

occasionally. Numerous carbonate slabs, crusts and fragments of chimneys were also 

collected in this grab sample (Figure 4.30). Most of the chimney pieces are oxidized as 

indicated by the brown to light brown colours, and vary in shape and size from a few 

centimetres up to 40 cm across. Small corals and encrusting organisms are attached to the 

chimneys. Along the southern flank of the cone C1, a high density of carbonate chimneys, 

some about 2 meters long, were observed together with some coral debris patches similar 

to the ones on the summit.

The upper part of the C1slope was sampled with a TV-controlled grab GeoB 9023 

(Figure 4.30). More than 300 kg of carbonate chimneys were collected, with cylindrical, 

mounded, branched, or mushroom shapes. Small corals, sponges, brachiopods and other 

little organisms were attached to the chimney pieces. The final part of the OFOS 17 profile 

corresponds to the pool-like structure at the base of the southern flank of C1 and the base

of the Hesperides MV complex. This depression has an oval shape and many current 

structures were observed during the video profiles, such as rippled sands, probably as 

consequence of the MO. The presence of the MO is also supported by the warmer seawater 

temperature and by the anomalous temperature gradients recorded in the heat flow stations 

(GeoB 9025-1, GeoB 9025-2 and ANA01-Sc15) in this area (Gardner et al., 2001; Kopf et 

al., 2004). 

Gravity cores ANA00-Gc10 and ANA00-Gc11 at the summit of cone C3, and 

ANA00-Gc12 at the summit of cone C4, are characterized by the presence of mud breccia 

(Figure 4.31) that consists mainly of clasts up 5 cm that were interpreted by Somoza et al. 

(2003) as clasts of the “blue” marls, characteristic of the Early-Middle Miocene pre-

olistostromic unit M1 defined by Maldonado et al., (1999); these are thought to be 

responsible for the formation of the marly diapirism (like in the GDR) that occurred in the 

central area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Maldonado et al., 1999).

Figure 4.32. Gravity cores GeoB 9019 and GeoB 9021 retrieved during the GAP cruise (Kopf et al., 2004) 

with mud breccia that indicate the mud volcano nature of the Hesperides. 

 

Methane concentrations made on the three cores taken on the Hesperides MV cones 

(GeoB 9019, GeoB 9020, GeoB 9021) show low values (&lt;0.2 mM), probably reflecting 

inactivity or slow rates of fluid venting, forming large amounts of carbonate crusts after 

mud volcano formation (Kopf et al., 2004). 

The heat flow station ANA01-Sc15 (Figure 4.33) was collected during the Anastasya 

survey in September 2001, in the pool-like depression at the base of the Hesperides MV 

southern of the cone C1 (see Figure 4.24 for location). At this station, the seafloor 

sediment temperature of 11.48ºC indicates the presence of MO in this structure and the 

calculated thermal gradient of 79.85, heat flow of 106.55 mW/m2 and a conductivity of 

1.334 W/m-K allowed the estimation of the depth of the GHSZ at 1068 m, and an 

estimated thickness of the GHSZ of 40 m (Gardner et al., 2001).

Figure 4.33. Heat flow station ANA01-Sc15 collected during the Anastasya survey in 2001 in the pool-like 

depression at the base of the Hesperides MV, south of cone C1 (see Figure 4.24 for location). 

 

On the Hesperides MV, a transect of 10 heat flow stations (Geob 9025-1 to GeoB 

9025-10) was acquired (see Figure 4.24 for location). The stations shown non-linear 

thermal gradients (Figure 4.34), especially in the first 2 meters of the sedimentary column. 

These non-linear gradients, similar to the results from the Anastasya 2001 heat flow 

stations, were interpreted as the result of the seasonal variations of the bottom water 

temperature, as result of the presence and fluctuations of the MO. However, in some of the 

stations of the transect (GeoB 9025-1 and GeoB 9025-6), the heat flow measurements 

reached sufficient depth and the deepest sensors provided linear trends of the temperature, 

allowing the calculation of the heat flow. Therefore an heat flow value of 73.3 mW/m2 was 

estimated for station GeoB 9025-1 and an heat flow value of 36.4 mW/m2 was estimated 

for station GeoB 9025-6 (Kopf et al., 2004).

4.3.2.2 Faro, Cibeles and Almazan 

Faro, Cibeles and Almazan MVs are situated located along a major positive relief 

arcuate structure, with 9 km in diameter and 13 km in length, that links the three MVs 

(Figure 4.35). This arcuate structure has slopes with gradients up to 18º and the highest 

gradients are found in the SW flank of the Cibeles MV (Figure 4.36B). Cibeles is located 

at the W limit of the arc, Faro MV is located in the central part of the arc, and Almazan is 

located at the E limit of the arc. The arcuate structure has highs ranging from 40 m up to a 

maximum of 120 m in relation to the surrounding high. The arcuate structure is interrupted 

by a NW-SE trend linear depression in between the Cibeles and the Faro MVs (Figure 

4.35). The area inside the arcuate structure is characterized by a plateau with a smooth 

topography, with small depressions up to 20 m depth and a deeper moat at the border of the 

interior slope of the arc. This structure is characterized by a moderate to high backscatter 

reflectivity on the NRL Seamap imagery (Figure 4.36A).

the Cibeles, Faro and Almazan MVs are located. 

 

The seismic profile TTR11-Psat 213 crosses the southern flank of the Faro MV and 

the arcuate structure, revealing the chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern bellow 

the surface conical expression of the Faro MV, contrasting with the parallel reflections of 

the sedimentary basin sequences (Figure 4.37B). The arcuate structure is characterized by 

intense folding of the sediments in contact with the piercing structure (Figure 4.37B). On 

the seismic profile TTR09-Psat 120 (Figure 4.37A), which crosses the prolongation of the 

arc south of Cibeles, although the data quality is not of optimal resolution it is possible to 

interpret that in the prolongation of the arc and on the Cibeles MV, near shot point 230, the 

reflectors show an upward deformation similar but less intense than that observed on 

profile TTR11-Psat 213 over the arc’s crest. 

The Cibeles MV is located at the southwestern limit of the arc. It has a triangular 

pyramidal conical shape with asymmetric flanks. The steepest gradient flanks are the SW 

and the SE flanks with up to 18º slopes. The top is located at 860 m water depth and it has 

a relief of 150 m above the surrounding seafloor. The SE flank is characterized by a 

smooth depression resembling an erosive moat while at the base of the SW flank 60-70 m 

deep depressions are found. The MV edifice has a maximum diameter of about 2 km along 

the arcuate structure and a minimum diameter of 1.2 km in the NW-SE direction. A gravity 

core (ANA2000-Gc09) taken at the SW flank of the mud volcano allowed the recovery of 

15 cm of oxidised brown muddy sands (Figure 4.42A), overlying 155 cm of grey clay 

muds with obvious indications of gas saturation, degassing structures and a strong H2S 

smell, that indicate the mud volcanic nature of this structure.

lines is depicted in Figure 4.35. To be noted the chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern bellow the 

surface conical expression of the Faro MV, contrasting with the parallel reflections of the sedimentary basin 

sequences. 

 

The Almazan mud volcano is located in the easternmost part of the arc is 

characterized by a regular and symmetric conical morphology (Figure 4.35 and Figure 

4.36B). The MV has a seabed diameter ranging from 1.0 to 1.2 km, a relief of 75 m above 

the surrounding seafloor (Figure 4.35) and steep flanks with slopes ranging from 8º to 14º 

Figure 4.36B. The top of the MV is located at 845 m water depth. On the NRL Seamap 

imagery Almazan is characterized by moderate but differential backscatter intensity. The 

top has a stronger backscatter intensity than the flanks or the base of the MV. High 

resolution sparker seismic profiles acquired during the Tasyo campaign (Somoza et al., 

2003) show that the surface of the cone is characterized by high-reflectivity coherent 

reflectors and the interior of the MV is characterized by indistinct and chaotic seismic 

reflection pattern. The mud volcano feeder channel has been identified as a columnar 

disturbance with a chaotic and indistinct seismic reflection pattern below the crest of the 

mud volcano, with a diameter of 600 m (Somoza et al., 2003) that cuts the well-stratified 

sedimentary sequences. The MV was sampled at its summit with a gravity core 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 115

(ANA2001-Gc08) which allowed the collection of a 107 cm long core with coarse 

bioclatic sandy sediments recovering mud breccia sediments with a strong H2S smell, high 

content of heterogeneous clayish clasts, gastropods and with intercalated layers with 

abundant coral and bivalve fragments (Diaz del Rio et al., 2001). The heat flow station 

ANA2001-Sc08, performed at the summit of the Almazan MV, indicated a bottom water 

temperature of 10.22ºC and allowed an estimation of a thermal gradient of 85.81, a heat-

flow of 87.92 (mW/m2), and a conductivity of 1.025 (W/m-K) (Figure 4.38A). Based on 

these data the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) can be estimated at a depth of 862 m with 

a thickness of 30 m (Gardner et al., 2001). 

 
Figure 4.38. Heat-flow stations ANA01-Sc08 and ANA01-Sc14 collected, respectively, at the summit of 

Almazan and Faro MVs during the Anastasya survey in 2001 (Gardner et al., 2001), see Figure 4.35 and 

Figure 4.39 for location. 

 

The Faro MV is the largest feature in this arcuate structure, it has a conical shape 

with an oval regular section, with a maximum basal diameter of 1.4 km along the NNW-

SSE direction and a minimum diameter of 1.2 km in the orthogonal direction. The summit 

of the Faro MV is located at 810 m water depth and represents a relief of 110 m in relation 

to the background bathymetric high of the centre of the arcuate structure (Figure 4.39). The 

MV has an asymmetric form with slopes of up to 16º (Figure 4.36B). Seismic reflection 

profiles over the mound show the chaotic seismic facies typical of the MVs (Figure 4.37B) 

and high resolution sparker seismic profiles of the Tasyo campaign allowed the 

identification of the MV feeder channel with an apparent  diameter of 1 km at the base of 

the MV (Somoza et al., 2003). The adjacent well-stratified sediments are folded with low 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 116 

amplitude folds and show an upward flexure of the reflectors towards the MV as also 

observed towards the arcuate crest (Figure 4.37B). 

One gravity core (ANA2001-Gc14) collected at the summit of the Faro MV allowed 

the retrieval of mud breccia with a strong H2S smell and heterometric clasts composed of 

sandstone, limestone, marlstone and some blue marlstone clasts, up to 5 cm in diameter, 

confirming the mud volcanic nature of the mound (Somoza et al., 2003). Gravity cores 

collected in the upper slope on the NE flank (GeoB 9032) and at the base of the MV (GeoB 

9031) allowed the retrieval of coral bearing sediments (Kopf et al., 2004). Two multi-corer 

stations were performed in one location where a possible bacterial mat was interpreted on 

the video profile OFOS-28. However, due to the presence of hardgrounds of aragonite 

pavements the multi-cores GeoB 9029-1 did not allowed the collection of any sediment 

and core GeoB 9029-2 only retrieved 12 cm of mud breccia sediment with fragments of 

aragonite pavements and bioclasts.

Figure 4.40. NRL Seamap long range SSS with the seafloor facies interpretation from the OFOS28 video 

observations. 

 

The OFOS 28 track, illustrated in Figure 4.39 and Figure 4.40, is composed by a NE-

SW profile crossing the summit of the Faro MV, followed by a S-N transect along the W 

flank, a NW-SE transect crossing the MV summit, a S-N transect along the E lower flank, 

and a ESE-WNW transect on the northern flank. The first transect with a NW-SE direction, 

began NW of the Faro mud volcano. The surrounding area and the lower flank of the MV 

are characterized by pelagic sediment with sandy and muddy patches, sometimes with 

ripples. Scattered corals occur especially at the base of the MV, where the gravity corer 

GeoB 9031 was collected, and at the lower flank, close to the intersection with the ESE-

WNW transect in the area where the gravity corer GeoB 9032 was collected. These two 

cores here characterized by pelagic sediments with coral rubble and mud breccia at the 

base (Kopf et al., 2004). Scarce fragments of carbonates forming small buildups and crusts 

were observed at the base of the depression close to the area were the gravity core GeoB 

9031 was collected. In the upper slope of the NE flank of the MV the seafloor is 

characterized by the presence of carbonate crusts, forming slabs, pavements, buildups and 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 118 

large blocks, some of them up to two meters in size. Scarce chimneys or pipe like 

carbonates are found scattered within the carbonate pavements. Corals and benthic fauna 

are frequently found attached to these carbonates. The northern flank near the summit area, 

close to the intersection with the NW-SE OFOS transect is characterized by mud breccia. 

The SW flank of the MV is characterized by dense occurrence of carbonates, forming 

crusts, pavements and slabs, sometimes forming buildups and large blocks with several 

meters in size and with some chimney fragments scattered lying in between the crusts. The 

seafloor has similar characteristics to those observed at the summit of Hesperides, but with 

a lower abundance of MDAC and less massive than on the Hesperides. The carbonates are 

frequently colonized by benthic fauna (corals). In some areas, pogonophora tube worms 

were found, occurring isolated or forming small patches. In the middle slope of the SW 

flank, an area of seafloor is covered by mud breccia. The summit and the upper SW flank, 

where the carbonates are more frequent is characterized by a stronger acoustic backscatter 

reflectivity (Figure 4.40). At the foot of the SW flank, the OFOS track continues to the 

north, and crosses the arcuate structure observed on the previous multibeam bathymetry. 

The area of the base of the MV, corresponding to less intense backscatter intensity on the 

NRL Seamap imagery than the summit of the MV, is characterized by muddy sediments 

showing patches of coarser grained sand, with scattered but abundant individual corals, 

hydrozoa and scarce carbonate crusts. The southern flank of the arcuate structure and its 

crest are characterized by the dense occurrences of carbonate crusts, slabs, pavements and 

buildups (Figure 4.41A-B), with scattered chimneys between the slabs. Individual corals 

are found attached to the carbonates. The northern flank of the arc is covered by mud 

breccia, sometimes recovered by pelagic sediments, often with rippled sand and muddy 

patches. When the profile reaches the base of the NW flank of the MV the seafloor is 

characterized by the occurrence of patches of dense accumulations of bivalves (Figure 

4.41C-D) some of which most probably correspond to live Solemyidae due to their 

elongated shape and dark brown colours. However, Lucinoma shells seem to be the most 

abundant, as confirmed by the TV-Grab sample GeoB 9029-3, collected in this area. This 

area is also characterized by carbonate pavements and slabs. Some of these carbonate 

pavements are apparently covered by white bacterial mats (Figure 4.41E-F). Pogonophora 

tubes were also observed associated with the carbonates, bivalves and the bacterial mats. 

Two multicorer stations were acquired with the objective to collect samples of bacterial 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 119

mats. One station was performed in this area (GeoB 9029-1) for that purpose but due to the 

hard carbonate pavements such collections was not possible. A second multicorer station 

(GeoB 9029-2) was attempted in a closer location dominated by mud breccia sediments in 

order to estimate methane concentrations in the sediments but only 10 to 15 cm of mud 

breccia was collected. A TV-controlled grab station (GeoB 9029-3) aimed to sample the 

bacterial mat area and aragonite pavement samples were collected with mythilid bivalves 

related to Calyptogena sp., Solemyidae and Lucinoma shells. Pogonophora tubes were also 

collected but bacterial mats were not retrieved (Figure 4.42B). The chemosynthetic fauna 

that hosts bacterial symbionts (sulphide oxidizing bacteria in their gills) indicate active 

hydrocarbon gas expulsion in this area.  

The OFOS 28 profile (Figure 4.40) along the track from the base of the NW slope to 

the summit of the MV was characterized by mud breccia material with pavements crusts 

and chimney carbonates that sometimes occur in denser patches, especially at the MV 

summit. The SE slope, the summit and the upper slope are characterized by mud breccia 

while the SE lower slope is dominated by pelagic sediment, sometimes with ripples 

indicating strong currents near the bottom. At the MV base the seafloor was again 

dominated by mud breccia with isolated corals and pogonophora occurring as isolated 

individuals, or in small patches.  

The next section of the OFOS profile, with a S-N direction showed a pelagic 

sedimentary cover at the base of the MV and mud breccia material with isolated individual 

corals attached to some of the mud breccia clasts. 

The last section of the OFOS profile, along the mid slope of the northern flank of the 

MV showed, in general, mud breccia sediments with patches of a pelagic sediment cover. 

Patches of coral rubble were also observed along this section of the OFOS track. It should 

be noted also the observation of an area with high density of shells and clam shells. This 

track ended at the previously surveyed area on the NW base of the MV, and once more 

carbonates pavements, slabs and buildups were observed; some of these pavements seem 

to host white bacterial mats. Pogonophora and clam fields were also found in between the 

pavement slabs. 

Attempts to sample the southern flank of the arc (TV-Grab GeoB 9030-2) and the 

base of the MV (TV-Grab stations: GeoB 9030-1 and GeoB 9030-3) in areas where

4.3.3 Mediterranean Outflow channels 

4.3.3.1 Cadiz Channel W of Iberico 

The Cadiz channel, 7 km W of the Iberico cone was surveyed in an area of irregular 

bottom topography located at 1100 to 1050 m water depth. This area is characterized by 

strong acoustic backscatter intensity on the NRL Seamap 12 kHz side-scan sonar. It was 

surveyed with 30 kHz deep-towed MAK side-scan sonar, with seismics, with underwater 

TV video profiles and sampled by dredging (Figure 4.43).  

On the high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar (line TTR11-MAK42) this area is 

also characterized by a strong backscatter intensity and shows a pattern of sharp and near 

parallel shadows (Figure 4.44) indicative of bedding and faulting of outcrop rocks, similar 

to the pattern observed on the N-NW flank of the Iberico mud cone. This pattern is typical 

for the entire Cadiz channel but the eastern side of the channel, illustrated in Figure 4.44, is 

characterized by strong backscatter intensity. In this area the underwater video profile 

TTR11-TV 21 was acquired in order to characterize the seafloor in this rocky headwall of 

the channel. This profile was carried out in a South to North direction along the headwall 

of the Cadiz channel starting on a small high, crossing a small depression and ending at the 

crest of a small elevation, as illustrated in Figure 4.43. The seafloor along the underwater 

TTR11-TV 21 video profile was characterized by the occurrence of high density of 

carbonate rubble, mainly chimneys lying in the seabottom over outcropping claystone (as 

confirmed by the claystone sample retrieved from the dredge TTR11-339D. The chimneys 

occur lying at the seabottom (as illustrated in Figure 4.47A and B), very fragmented, 

oxidized and colonized by benthic fauna indicating a long period of permanence at the 

seafloor. Some buildups and slabs of pavements were also found (as illustrated in Figure 

4.47E and F), especially close to the end of the profile. The rocky outcrops were composed 

of consolidated claystones that exhibit frequently, up to 1-2 m, scarps (as illustrated in 

Figure 4.47C and D) where the blocks of the outcropping rocks are found at their base. 

Layering of the rocky outcrops was observed as well as small patches of coral rubble. In 

general, the rocky outcrops had no pelagic sediment cover due to the strong bottom 

currents, as observed by the movement of the soft corals and by the movement of 

particulate maters on the video records. Only small patches of rippled sandy sediments 

were found.

4.4 Discussion 

4.4.1 Fluid and gas escape manifestations in the Gulf of Cadiz 

In the Gulf of Cadiz, the area of the accretionary wedge is characterised by an 

extensive occurrence of fluid escape structures (Figure 4.1) expressed by mud volcanoes, 

mud cones, diapiric ridges, pockmarks, MDAC and chemosynthetic ecosystems, related to 

hydrocarbon rich fluid venting (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Rensbergen et 

al., 2005b), that has been interpreted as indicators of depth gas rich overpressured 

sediments (Somoza et al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2001; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). The 

migration of these fluids through the sediments to the seafloor appears, in some places, to 

be controlled by faulting (Pinheiro et al., 2005). Some of the mud volcanoes (Moroccan 

margin) are located along major NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults identifiable on the 

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) side-scan imagery (Gardner, 2001). In other places the 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 127

mud volcanoes appear to be located at the intersection between the NW-SE strike-slip 

faults and trusts of variable orientation that reflect the Gibraltar Arc curvature (Pinheiro et 

al., 2005). 

The migration of fluids along these faults is possibly related both to along-slope 

gravitational sliding and to the tectonic transpressional deformation of the olistostromes 

and the accretionary complex, due to the Africa-Eurasia convergence (Somoza et al., 2000; 

Somoza et al., 2001), which induces in places transpressional tectonic movements of the 

shale/salt deposits of the olistostromes mass, generating salt/shale arched wedges. It has 

also been suggested that some of the widespread shallow fluid venting on the seafloor, 

particularly in the area of occurrence of carbonate chimneys of the south and southwest of 

the GDR and in the FR, could be explained by the destabilisation of gas hydrates rich 

sediments in contact to the MO (Somoza et al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2001). 

Although a quantitative relationship between the fluid/gas expulsion and the 

geologic/biologic manifestation is not straightforward, it is clear that, qualitatively, the 

geologic and biologic responses are dependent on the fluid and gas compositions and on 

the flux rate and frequency of the eruption episodes. Data on the frequency, composition 

and impacts of the expulsion episodes, which imply a long term monitorization of the fluid 

escape structures, are difficult to collect and, not yet available for the GC. However, the 

seafloor features that result from fluid/gas escape give information on the nature of the 

fluids/gas being delivered to the seafloor, on the episodic nature of the processes, and on 

the duration of those events and the delivery rates (Roberts, 2001). 

Roberts and Carney (1997) qualitatively correlated the different fluid escape 

structures with relative changes in the rate of vertical flux and expulsion of fluids and 

gases (hydrocarbons, pore waters and sediment) to the seafloor (Figure 4.49). The 

sediment-prone mud volcanism corresponds to the rapid flux end-member of the fluid 

escape feature spectrum. Mud volcanoes and mud flows composed of extruded fluidized 

sediments that consist of fine grained sediments and clasts from the underlying sediment 

layers. The opposite end-member of the spectrum of the fluid escape structures 

corresponds to the slow flux of gases and fluids. It is represented by mineral-prone 

structures, such as authigenic carbonates, of which dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys 

and aragonite pavements types are represented in the GC. In this case, the processes of 

microbial mediated degradation of hydrocarbons (mainly methane) can produce calcium-

other fluid escape structures 

 128 

magnesium carbonates that form a variety of seafloor features including the hard-grounds, 

mound-like buildup structures and accumulations of conduit or pipe-like MDAC of 

variable dimensions. The intermediate flux rates are frequently associated with the 

occurrence of shallow subsurface gas hydrates, where the chemosynthetic communities are 

most common and well developed.

seafloor and the resultant escape structures (Roberts and Carney, 1997). (A) pictures illustrating the rapid 

flux (mud-prone) end-member corresponding to the mud volcanoes and mud flows. (B) pictures illustrating 

an intermediate case with moderate flux rates, corresponding to surface exposures or shallow gas hydrates 

and well-developed chemosynthetic ecosystems and local areas of occurrence of MDAC. (C) pictures 

corresponding to slow flux cases (mineral-prone case) characterized by a sparse or absent chemosynthetic 

communities and dominance of the MDAC, occurring as pavements, slabs, buildups, mounds, chimneys and 

other forms of lithified seafloor. 

 

4.4.2 MDAC occurrence and characterization 

The MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz have high variable morphologies and 

mineralogies but, as described in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC have been 

identified in the collected samples: (I) dolomite-dominated carbonates and (II) aragonite-



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 129

dominate carbonates. All these MDAC indicate modern or recent methane seepage and its 

anaerobic oxidation (mediated by microbial activity) which leads to the precipitation of the 

authigenic carbonates (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite and dolomite) resulting in the 

cementation of the sediments and the formation of chimneys and other structures. 

The different morphologies of the carbonate structures reflect different flow patterns 

through the sediments. If the flux of fluid enriched in methane is canalized through the 

sulphate reduction zone of the sedimentary column, using borrows or sediment 

heterogeneities as pathways, the sulphate-methane interface and consequently the 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonates will occur around these (sulphate semi-closed 

systems) fluid conduits, resulting in the lithification of the sediments and the formation of 

the dolomitic chimneys (as discussed in Chapter 5). Similar formation processes can be 

proposed for the formation of the dolomite dominated crusts, nodules and massive forms. 

The aragonite pavement types result from the oxidation of methane at or close to the 

seafloor resulting on the formation of buildups or small carbonate mounds or paving the 

seafloor with continuous hard-grounds or as crusts, slabs and blocs. 

Seep sites and authigenic carbonate deposits were initially assumed to be isolated 

occurrences. With the increase of the detailed survey coverage they now have been 

encountered in several other locations (between 500 and 4000 m water depth), indicating 

that they are far more common features than previously anticipated (Figure 4.1). 

The seafloor occurrences of these different MDAC, as described from the underwater 

observations, are discussed bellow. 

 

4.4.2.1 Dolomite crusts and chimneys 

The distribution of the MDAC, observed on underwater video profiles and by sample 

retrieval, is correlated with high backscatter acoustic intensities on the side-scan sonar 

imagery. The sites of occurrence of the MDAC are characterized by the strongest acoustic 

response, stronger than the backscatter from mud breccia and even from most of the rock 

outcrops that are frequently characterized by the occurrence of particular textural features 

that reflect some characteristic shadows, resulting from the layering and faulting patterns. 

This is illustrated e.g. on the Iberico mud cone (Figure 4.18) where is clear the distinction 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 130 

between the strong acoustic backscatter of the MDAC, the intermediate acoustic intensity 

of the rocky outcrops, and the low backscatter reflectivity of the pelagic sediments. 

The underwater video observations revealed that the dolomite crusts and chimneys 

occur as fields with high density of carbonate samples. These carbonate samples exhibit a 

large variety of shapes and sizes, such as pipe-like, tubular linear shapes, curved or 

helicoidal shapes, conical, branched, nodular, and massive irregular shapes. Their sizes are 

highly variable both in length and diameter. Chimneys with more than 3 m long and up to 

0.5 m in diameter were observed. Those chimneys and crusts appear to be broken, 

sometimes intensely fragmented, forming carbonate rubble, and occur most of the times 

lying on the sea floor. It is very rare to find chimneys that are in the vertical position, 

protruding from the sediments. 

Isolated individuals and small colonies of sea urchins, Cnidaria (Hydrozoa and 

Anthozoa), Mollusca (Gastropoda and Bivalvia burrows), Annelida (Polychaeta), 

Arthropoda (Decapoda), Brachiopoda, Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, 

Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea) are frequently found on the chimneys fields. 

However, no chemosynthetic organisms were found directly associated and in close 

relation with the dolomite chimneys crusts and nodules. Chemosynthetic communities 

were identified only at sites characterized by the occurrence of the aragonite pavement 

types. In the Hesperides, Faro and Student mud volcanoes, and off Gibraltar, occurrences 

of dolomite chimneys and aragonite pavements are found in close spatial proximity or even 

occur simultaneously. However, the observed field geometry relationships between the 

different MDAC indicate that they had distinct formation periods. The morphologic and 

textural characteristics of the aragonite pavement carbonates show indicators of a recent or 

present day formation while the dolomite carbonates, which occur as fragments and 

remobilized pieces, indicate older formation episodes. The benthic organisms found in the 

chimney fields use the carbonates as a hard ground for fixation. The chimneys exhibit 

variable but in general strong dark blown colours indicating oxy-hydroxide iron and 

manganese coatings. The benthic colonization of these carbonates and their oxidation 

coatings indicate that they are, in general, in contact with the seawater for a considerable 

amount of time. 

Occasionally, and in especial on the video profile TTR15-TV69 in the Cadiz channel 

at the East of Lolita (Figure 4.7), chimneys occur in situ and do not completely outcrop

from the sedimentary formation where they were formed. Sometimes it was possible to 

recognize in some situations a sub-parallel orientation of some chimneys relative to the 

sedimentary layering, while others clearly have a sub-vertical orientation. The sub-vertical 

orientation of some of the chimneys was already suggested by the apparent layering 

interpreted from the granulometric and textural variations in some chimneys (Chapter 5). 

These observations, together with the large variety of the dolomite chimneys, suggest a 

complex plumbing system for the fluid percolation. In some situations the fluid percolates 

upwards, cutting the sedimentary layers, while in other cases the fluid also percolates 

horizontally along more permeable layers tending to form the slab-like crusts and branched 

chimneys. Some of the conduit type of chimneys can also result from horizontal flow. 

The areas where the chimneys occur are systematically characterized by strong 

bottom currents. These currents, as evidenciated by the transport of particulate matter, by 

the swing of soft corals and by the bent of the wait string attached to the video camera 

frame, are considered to have clearly the potential to erode the unconsolidated sediments in 

which the chimneys formed. In the northern area of the GC, in the GDR field, in the Tasyo 

field and in the ridges West of Gibraltar, these strong currents are related to the 

Mediterranean Outflow water (MO). In the Moroccan margin, strong currents were also 

observed at the Pen Duick escarpment and in the Vernarsky Ridge. While in this area the 

origin of these currents is not so clearly documented as related to the Mediterranean 

Outflow (MO), the presence of these structures in the upper and intermediate slope can be 

generated by these strong currents. Therefore it is possible to propose that strong bottom 

currents and the MO have an effective control on the outcrop of the dolomite crusts, 

nodules and chimneys. It is proposed that the locations where the dolomite chimneys occur 

are presently swept by the flowing of the MO and/or other strong bottom currents which 

can remobilize the unconsolidated sediment inside of which the chimneys were formed and 

therefore produce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their present position 

on the seafloor. Considering this, it is possible to consider that the chimneys may be 

formed under the seafloor (as proposed based on the geochemical and mineralogical 

composition of the carbonates, and discussed in Chapter 5) and gradually exposed at the 

seafloor through erosion of the surrounding unconsolidated sediments, which causes them 

to loose sustentation and fall down on the seafloor. The oxidation and the iron and 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 132 

manganese coating, as well as the colonization by the benthic fauna, began after the 

chimneys cropped out. 

 

4.4.2.2 Aragonite pavements 

Underwater video observations revealed that the aragonite pavement type of MDAC 

occur as (1) buildups and small mound-like buildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-

5 m high and several meters in length (e.g. see Figure 4.29); (2) as rough hard-grounds (up 

to 50-80 cm thick) that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with a thin or 

absent sediment cover (e.g. see Figure 4.41B); (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the 

pavements or; (4) as nodular masses of few cm size within superficial sediments. The 

mounds appear on the underwater video observations as accumulations of chaotically tilted 

and fractured blocks, separated by well-defined joints (e.g. Figure 4.29). According to 

Roberts (2001) The nodular masses, the hardgrounds and the crusts are most common in 

the intermediate to slow flux rate settings, while the mounded carbonates and the chimneys 

are interpreted to be more characteristic of slow flux rate environments. 

Colonization of these pavements by benthic fauna (non chemosynthetic) is frequent 

but less intense than observed on some of the chimney fields. The aragonite pavements are 

characterized by having frequently associated chemosynthetic communities. Aggregates of 

clam shells, probably most of them dead, were identified on the seafloor observations at 

several places (e.g. Hesperides, Faro and Porto MVs). Live chemosynthetic fauna 

(Calyptogena, Acharax and pogonophora tube worms) were identified and sampled in 

close association with areas of aragonite pavements occurrence. Besides, shells of 

chemosynthetic fauna are also present cemented and incorporated in the carbonate 

samples, in the aragonite pavements sub-type: shell crusts (described in Chapter 5). Small 

bacterial mats and pogonophora tube worms were also observed in restricted areas of the 

Faro MV, in close association with the aragonite pavements (Figure 4.41E-F). 

 

4.4.3 Chemosynthetic fauna: occurrence and underwater observations 

In the Gulf of Cadiz, macro-scale chemosynthetic organisms were found in lower 

abundance when compared with other seepage areas as in the Gulf of Mexico where well 

developed macro-scale chemosynthetic communities were found in association with gas 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 133

hydrates (MacDonald et al., 1988; Carney, 1994; Roberts, 2001; Bergquist et al., 2003; 

MacDonald et al., 2003). The chemosynthetic fauna in the Gulf of Cadiz include host 

invertebrates with bacterial symbionts such as the Calyptogena, Acharax and pogonophora 

tube worms. They were observed only in small areas correlated with recent or more intense 

active hydrocarbon venting sites. 

The microbial communities in the Gulf of Cadiz include sulfate reducing bacteria, 

methanogenic bacteria, sulfide and methane-oxidizing bacteria and bacteria that oxidize 

heavier hydrocarbons (Niemann et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006). The microbial 

communities are critical to carbon cycling in intermediate to slow seepage environments as 

they have an important role in the precipitation of the MDAC. 

Small patches of probable bacterial mats were identified only at one location in the 

Faro mud volcano. They were not detected at the scales normally found in areas of intense 

and active seeps like in the Gulf of Mexico or in the East Mediterranean. This is 

interpreted as indicating a present day state of low or inactive fluid venting at the seafloor. 

This is also confirmed by the low to mid range microbial methane turnover and AOM 

activity in the measured mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al., 2006). 

Gas bubbles and sites of active fluid migration were observed only at two locations in the 

Mercator mud volcano crater, in areas of highly gas-saturated mud breccia. 

 

4.4.4 Characteristics of mud volcanoes, mud cones and diapiric ridges 

The mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are morphologically characterized by a moat 

around part of the base of the mud volcano cone, this moat can be erosive and/or resultant 

from the collapse of the structure as result of the overburden and stress release after the 

eruptions. The mud volcanoes are also characterized by an irregular slope with radial 

outward sediment flows, terraces and/or depositional sediment flow escarpments (lobe 

fronts). The summit of the mud volcanoes is in general characterized by a crater 

depression, or shows a flat top, or sometimes a central dome. The mud volcanoes in the 

GC are characterized by positive topographic features with diameters up to 5.4 km and up 

to 255 m high, like the Al Idrissi MV (Rensbergen et al., 2005a; Rensbergen et al., 2005b). 

The mud volcano edifices are composed by the stacking of successive deposits of fluidised 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to 
other fluid escape structures 

 134 

sediments composed by clay material, water, gases and clasts or rock fragments from the 

different strata crossed by the mud volcano conduit and or from the source layer. 

The mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz are characterized by the presence of mud 

breccia sediments, composed of a mixture of clay rich sediment with fragments of exotic 

rocks that have high variable sizes and nature (clasts). The most abundant clasts 

correspond to claystones from which a significant percentage correspond to the plastic mud 

and blue marls clasts interpreted as being of Early-Middle Miocene age and expressing the 

wedge front of the olistostrome/accretionary complex (Somoza et al., 2001; Díaz-del-Río 

et al., 2003). 

The mud breccia sediments are also characterized by a high gas (essentially methane) 

content and also by high H2S contents. On mud volcanoes where gas hydrates where 

collected, the mud breccias exhibit a mousy like texture with high amounts of vacuoles and 

high water content. This texture results from the dissociation of gas hydrates. Gas hydrate 

pieces were collected from the cores only when they had sizes sufficient to resist to their 

dissociation during the time of their retrieval. 

The study of the mud breccia and the clasts from mud volcanoes from the Gulf of 

Cadiz allowed the identification of microfossils indicating ages ranging from Upper 

Cretaceous, Eocene and Miocene-Pliocene (Ovsyannikov et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 

2003). However, the complex tectonic evolution and structure of the Gulf of Cadiz and the 

location of the mud volcanoes within the accretionary wedge complex, where several 

melange/olistostrome bodies are present, which can contain a mixture of several source 

rocks. The accretionary wedge geometry with major and deep thrusts can also bring deeper 

strata to close to the surface or even at the surface, as observed on the diapiric ridges where 

the upper Miocene blue marls are exposed at the seafloor. Therefore, the oldest ages 

defined from the mud breccia clasts are not clear indicators of the deepest and the source 

layers of the mud volcanoes. Nevertheless, the seismic profiles, the age information of the 

mud breccia clasts and the pressure and temperature conditions estimated from the pore 

water geochemistry, suggest that the mud volcanoes are most probably deeply rooted. 

The MVs from the Gulf of Cadiz, as other examples from onshore and submarine 

MVs, exhibit sedimentological and geometric characteristics supporting their episodic, 

rapid and sometimes violent expulsion events. As regards the GC mud volcanoes, these 

evidences are interpreted based on seismic, acoustic, morphologic and sedimentary 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 135

analysis. The identification of eruptive mud flow episodes are recognised from the 

different backscatter intensities between the more recent mud flows, with high acoustic 

backscatter, when compared with the moderated backscatter intensities of the older flows 

recovered by pelagic sediments (e.g. Figure 4.50A). The recognition of mud flows is also 

possible from detailed bathymetry of the mud volcanoes (Rensbergen et al., 2005a). 

Episodes of mud flows deposition are also recognized from the christmas tree facies where 

an inter-fingerings of acoustic transparent or chaotic seismic facies, typical of mud breccia 

flows, intercalate with the coherent and continuous reflectors from the sedimentary layers. 

The intercalation of hemipelagic sediment layers within mud breccia flows, as recognised 

on the 3.76 m long gravity core GeoB 9037-1 collected on the slope of the Captain 

Arutyunov MV and shown in Figure 4.50B, allowed to recognise three individual layers of 

mud breccia, corresponding to different mud flows episodes intercalated with pelagic 

sediment that indicates MV inactive periods (Kopf et al., 2004). 

Mud volcanoes are characterized on the side-scan sonar by a stronger acoustic 

backscatter than the surrounding pelagic sediment cover. This stronger backscatter 

reflectivity is attributed to the presence of clasts on the mud breccia and also due to the 

occurrence of the MDAC that are also frequently found within the mud volcano edifice. 

The high reflectivity of the surface of the mud volcanoes is also evident on seismic profiles 

as the seafloor amplitude over them corresponds to a clear strong positive anomaly when 

compared to the surrounding pelagic sediments. 

On the seismic profiles the mud volcanoes are generally characterized by 

acoustically opaque, chaotic and indistinct seismic patterns, which extend from the 

seafloor into the subsurface (e.g. Figure 4.25B). The general interpretation for these 

acoustic wipeout zones is that they result of the presence of free gas (bubbles) in the 

surface and near-surface sediments, or is the acoustic response of the mud breccia deposits 

that correspond to material that is structurelles as result of the sediment remolding along 

the subsurface feeder channel and mud flows resulting from the mud extrusion and gas 

escaping. This is supported by the fact that some of the mud volcanoes that are inactive 

show this chaotic seismic pattern, indicating that this characteristic is maintained in the 

systems and therefore is not an evidence of present activity or of the presence of free gas 

within the MV. On seismic profiles, the gas-charged sediments are identified by the high

As the mud volcanoes correspond to rapid flux settings, a considerable heat is 

expected to be transported form deeper strata accompanying the extruded fluidized 

sediments, water and gases. Mud volcanoes on the deformation front of Barbados prism 

(Henry et al., 1996) and in the Haakon Mosby mud volcano offshore Norway with high 

thermal gradient and heat flow of 1000 mW m-2 (Eldholm et al., 1999) are examples of the 

highest heat flux settings. Other mud volcanoes, such as Mound Culebra offshore Costa 

Rica have heat flow values of 35-50 mW m-2, 30-80% higher than the regional background 

values (Grevemeyer et al., 2004). In the vicinity of mud volcanoes from the Mediterranean 

Ridge, heat flow values were observed to just slightly increase towards the mounds 

(Camerlenghi et al., 1995). 

The heat-flow measurements from the Gulf of Cadiz performed during the GAP and 

Anastasya 2001 cruises have recorded the only heat-flow values available from mud 

volcanoes in this area. Due to the presence of the MO that flows close to the seabottom at 

water depths between 400 and 1400 m, the heat-flow measurements are affected by the 

seasonal bottom water temperature variations. As the MO has significant seasonal 

variations, the transient changes in the temperature of the water column will cause 

temperature waves which will propagate from the seafloor downwards and therefore 

overprint the internal upward heat flux. An example of this effect is the record of the 

Hesperides MV that is characterized by non-linear gradients Figure 4.34. Nevertheless, 

heat-flow measurements from mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz recorded low heat-flow 

values in the Captain Arutyunov (17-22 mW m-2), Hesperides (73-100 mW m-2) and 

Ginsbug MVs (Gardner et al., 2001; Kopf et al., 2004). The Bonjardim was the mud 

volcano that showed higher heat-flow values (66-163 mW m-2) pointing to a stronger 

activity in this structure than on the Captain Arutyunov, Hesperides and Ginsbug MVs 

(Kopf et al., 2004). 

 

4.4.5 Temporal and spatial relationship between the MDAC, 

chemosynthetic organisms and the MV, MD and diapiric ridges 

The fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz represent a high degree of 

geologic and biologic variability associated with the type, intensity and duration of the 

fluxes. The rapid expulsions of fine-grained sediments during the MV mud flows

other fluid escape structures

emplacement (and/or possibly accompanying by suspended sediments), will create 

environmental conditions that are hostile for the benthic fauna (Figure 4.51A and D). For 

filter feeders, the high suspended sediment loads overwhelm their respiratory systems and 

the mud flows can burry them or made their life difficult or impossible and preclude 

sulfide-producing anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons. 

As rapid flux systems become progressively less active, these systems can start to 

acquire superficial features characteristic of moderate to slow and more fluid/gas 

dominated seepage. After a mud flow emplacement, if the mud breccia has enough high 

hydrocarbon (essentially methane) and a high sulfide content, these environments can be 

suitable for methane oxidizing and sulfate reducers to develop and carbonate precipitation 

will be induced and simultaneously the mat-forming bacteria Beggiatoa may colonize the 

surface of the mud flow. Lucinid and vesycomyid clams can then colonize the mud flows if 

the biodegradation of the incorporated hydrocarbons produces a sufficient sulfide source 

(Figure 4.51B). However, since the mud breccia expulsion events are episodic, any mud 

flow deposits have a limited hydrocarbon charge and therefore a limited sulfide-production 

potential. For this reason, infaunal lucinid clam communities establish themselves and 

quickly deplete the available sulfide source (Figure 4.51C). This is in agreement with their 

seafloor distribution as the clam shells superficial accumulations observed occur frequently 

scattered over the surface of extruded muds. Only in places where there is e.g. a tectonic 

focalization of the fluids and gases that can escape slowly to the seafloor, can these 

systems provide long term methane supply that can be stored as gas hydrates deposits at 

shallow depths, and/or fuel the methane oxidizers/sulfate reducers and subsequent sulfide 

oxidizers communities. These settings will also be associated with an intense MDAC 

formation. This can explain the location of the MDAC and larger chemosynthetic 

ecosystems that are most frequently found in the mud volcano crater or at its flanks where 

there is some focalization of fluid and gas seepage (Figure 4.51C). 

Therefore, dormant or marginally active phases of the mud volcanoes may contain 

gas hydrates, authigenic carbonates and localized chemosynthetic communities. In fact, the 

mud volcanoes from which gas hydrates were collected from (Bonjardim, Captain 

Arutyunov and Ginsburg) or from which strong evidences of gas hydrates were identified, 

were also characterized by the presence of live chemosynthetic communities with lucinid-

vesycomid clams, pogonophora, vestimentifera tube worms and bathymodiolid mussels.

evolution. (A) phase of rapid flux with a mud-prone dominated event. (B) phase of intermediate flux with a

establishment of large chemosynthetic communities. (C) phase of slow flux rate with a mineral-prone 

dominated features. (D) new phase of rapid flux with a mud-prone dominated event that covers the previous 

MDAC and chemosynthetic communities. 

 

Through time, the mud volcanoes will successively go through different phases of 

activity, from a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid emplacement of 

mud flows, to a subsequent phase of moderate flux, dominated by water and gas can result 

in the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, to the cementation of the mud breccia 

sediments and the formation of other types of MDAC and support of chemosynthetic 



Chapter 4. Characterization of areas of MDAC occurrence in the Gulf of Cadiz and their relation to

communities. A subsequent phase of reduced flux, dominated also by water and gas flux 

will result in further formation of MDAC and a decrease of the chemosynthetic 

communities. 

In the Gulf of Cadiz the mud volcano fluids including gases are vertically focused by 

faults and by the mud volcano conduits, as the gas hydrates, MDAC and the 

chemosynthetic communities were found within the mud volcano edifices (Porto, Faro, 

Darwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Braza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, Shouen and 

Student), mud cones (Iberico, Cornide), diapiric ridges (FR, GDR, Hormigas) and fault 

scarps (Pen Duick, Vernarsky ridge, Ridge W Gibraltar, Cadiz channel), and no regionally 

bottom-simulating reflectors were found until now. 

 

 

4.5 Conclusions 

 

The sites where MDAC occur are in close relation with mud volcanoes (MV) and 

mud cones (MC), within diapiric ridges, fault scarps and probably faults in the channels of 

the Mediterranean Outflow (MO), indicating that MV, MC, diapirs and faults are the 

preferential pathways for fluid escape. Underwater seafloor video observations suggest that 

the MO can have an effective control on the occurrence of the MDAC, promoting their 

formation (as discussed in Chapter 6). The MO has also a control on the occurrence of the 

different types of authigenic carbonates, as the dolomitic dominated MDAC mainly occur 

in places where the MO has a strong erosive effect (Magalhães et al., 2005). 

The MDAC chimneys have a large variability of shapes and sizes, such as pipe-like, 

tubular linear shapes, curved or helicoidal shapes, conical, branched, nodular and massive 

irregular shapes. Their sizes are highly variable both in length and diameter. Chimneys 

with more than 3 m long and up to 0.5 m in diameter were observed. These chimneys and 

crusts appear broken, sometimes intensely fragmented, forming carbonate rubble and they 

occur most of the times lying on the sea floor. It is very rare to find chimneys that are in a 

vertical position, protruding from the sediments. 

The aragonite MDAC pavements occur as (1) buildups and small mound-like 

buildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-5 m high and several meters in length; (2) as

 141

rough hard-grounds that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with a thin or 

absent sediment cover; (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the pavements or; (4) as nodular 

masses of few cm size within superficial sediments. 

The fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz (MV, MC, MDAC) and 

associated chemosynthetic communities, exhibit different phases of activity. They can 

represent a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid emplacement of mud 

flows. They can locally consist of phases of moderate flux, dominated by water and gas 

that can result in the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, manifested by the cementation 

of the mud breccia sediments and the formation of other types of MDAC and by the 

support of chemosynthetic communities. Or they can consist of phases of reduced flux, 

dominated also by water and gas, which will result in further formation of MDAC and a 

decrease of the chemosynthetic communities.

Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and formation model 

 

 

5.1 Introduction 

 

During the TTR11 (Leg 3), TTR12 (Leg 2), TTR14 (Leg 1), TTR15 (Leg 4) and 

TTR16 (Leg 2) cruises, the area south and southwest of the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge 

(GDR), the Formosa Ridge (FR) and channels of the outflow of the Mediterranean water 

(MO), were surveyed with seismics, side-scan sonar, underwater TV and sampling. This 

area is characterized by a very strong backscatter on the available side scan sonar images 

and a very irregular seafloor, with morphological and sedimentological features related to 

fluid escape, as well as sedimentary structures associated with the MO (Figure 5.2). As 

described on the previous chapter, the GDR, the FR, on erosional features associated with 

the MO on the Cadiz Channel, in the Pen Duick and the Vernadsky Ridges and on some 

mud volcanoes and mud diapirs located on the pathway of the MO (Iberico, Faro, 

Hesperides, Student and Yuma) has been shown to be characterized by the presence of 

large fields of dolomite crusts and chimneys (Kenyon et al., 2002; Magalhães et al., 2002; 

Somoza et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; 

Pinheiro et al., 2004). Dense fields of dolomite chimneys and aragonite pavements were 

also discovered during the TTR14 cruise on the main channel of the MO in front of the 

Strait of Gibraltar. The re-examination of samples collected during the much earlier (1976) 

Hesperides cruise on the northern slope of the Guadalquivir Channel also showed the 

presence of similar dolomite chimneys. Aragonite and calcite crusts or pavements, typical 

from cold seeps, were also discovered and sampled, associated with the Pen Duick and the 

Vernadsky Ridges, within the Cadiz Channel and associated with several mud volcanoes: 

Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Fiuza, Darwin, Shouen, Adamastor, 

Meknes, Hesperides Faro and Porto (Figure 5.1).

In this chapter, the different types of MDAC collected in the Gulf of Cadiz are 

described, together with their mineralogy, stable C and O isotopic composition, SEM and 

biomarker studies. The relationships between distinct geochemical environments and the 

resulting precipitated MDAC are investigated and a formation mechanism of the different 

carbonate lithologies is proposed. 

 

5.2 Material and methods 

 

The samples used in this study were collected by dredging and by TV controlled 

grab, on the main channels of the MO (Guadalquivir and Cadiz Channels, and in the MO 

channel in front of the Gibraltar Strait), on the GDR, on the FR, in the Pen Duick and the 

Vernadsky Ridges; in the Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Kid, Mercator, Adamastor, 

Fiuza, Darwin, Shouen, Meknes, Faro, Hesperides and Porto mud volcanoes; and I the 

Iberico mud cone (Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). 

Morphology and sizes of the authigenic carbonates were described on underwater 

video observations and on the retrieved samples. The petrography of the carbonates was 

examined in polished slabs and thin sections by standard petrographic and 

cathodoluminescence techniques. 

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were carried out, coupled with 

energy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS), in fresh fractured 

surfaces and in samples etched with HCl 1% during 1-4 minutes before the SEM 

observations. 

Bulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies in 

each sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples 

(Table 1). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer 

with CuK? radiation (1.5405 Å wavelength); Scans were done from 5º to 60º 2? at 

0.02º/sec, using 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the 

diffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates 

of the relative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their 

relative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were 

performed using the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff® software packages. 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 146 

The peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals aragonite 

(3.40 Å), calcite (&amp;lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 Å), high-Mg calcite (8 to 30 mol% 

MgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 Å), protodolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 Å) and 

dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 Å). The Mg:Ca ratio of the carbonate 

minerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection peak of 

calcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction spectra 

(Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). 

Samples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at 

90°C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-

PRISM mass spectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results are 

reported in the conventional ? ‰-notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee 

Belemnite). Analytical reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards is better 

than ±0.1‰ for both carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite 

samples, dolomite ?18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63‰, 

consequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum 

and Sheppard, 1986). 

Samples for 87Sr/86Sr were dissolved in 20 ml, 1.0 N ultra pure acid acetic, 

centrifuged, and then decanted and evaporated dry. Then, they were re-dissolved in 20 ml 

of 5-N HNO3 and loaded into columns containing the AG8 50W BioRad Sr-specific resin. 

The 87Sr/86Sr composition of the carbonates (Arag, Calc, Mg-Calc and Dol) was 

determined using a VG-Sector 54 Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer. The analytical 

reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards, is better than ±0.000060‰. 

The carbonate and the organic carbon were determined using a LECO CHNS-932 

elemental analyzer. Three replicates of powdered and homogenized bulk material (2 mg), 

collected with a micro-drill, were analyzed per sub-sample. The same set of sub-samples 

was later subjected to combustion for 8 h through a predefined stepwise increase in 

temperature up to 400ºC, to remove organic carbon, and re-analyzed for inorganic carbon. 

The organic carbon content (Corg) was determined by the difference between total carbon 

and the inorganic carbon concentration. Results are presented in weight percent (wt%). The 

relative precision of repeated measurements of both samples and standards was 0.03 wt%. 

The sample preparation procedure used for extraction and purification of the lipid 

biomarkers is based on the method of Peckmann et al., (2004) and described in detail in 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 147

Magalhães et al., (2005). The freshly broken carbonate sample was decalcified (HCl 10%) 

and the dried residue was refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). 

The supernatant was decanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication 

in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1 v:v), until the solvent become colorless. Subsequently, the 

combined supernatants were portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total 

extract was dried and separated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-

0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, length: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml 

or 3 column volumes of n-hexane); (2) Esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) 

Alcoholes (20 ml of CH2Cl2/Aceton 9:1; (4) Fatty acids/Polars (20 ml of MeOH). The 

Esters/ketones and Alcoholes fractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and 

BSTFA (2:1) at 70ºC (1 h). The polar fractions/Fatty acids were dried and 

transesterificated with Boron-Trifluoride methanol and then with KCl + hexane. Internal 

standard used for all fractions was Cholestane. A modification of the method, by doing a 

previous extraction with CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) prior to decalcification, revealed to be 

efficient in cleaning dirt peaks on the dolomite chimney samples. 

The hydrocarbon fraction was examined by combined gas chromatography-mass 

spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Varian CP-3800 GC/Saturn 2000 MS EI-mode, 70 eV) 

equipped with a 30 m fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 8 CB Low Bleed, 0.25 mm ID, 

0.25 µm film thickness). The carrier gas was He. The GC-temperature program used was: 

injection at 80ºC, 5 min isothermal; from 80ºC to 310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 20 min isothermal. 

Identification of the organic compounds was based on comparison of the mass spectra and 

of GC retention times with those of published data and of reference compounds. 

Coupled GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was conducted using a 

Finnigan DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer equipped with a HP6890GC and CuO/Ni/Pt 

combustion furnace operated at 940ºC. Samples were injected splitless (1 min) onto a 30-m 

fused silica column (DB5-MS, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) using a Gerstel 

Cooled Injection System (CIS4) programmed from 48ºC (0 min) to 310ºC (10 min) at 12ºC 

sec-1. Carrier gas was He. The GC temperature program was: 3 min at 80ºC; from 80ºC to 

310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 30 min at 310ºC. GC-C-IRMS precision was checked using a standard 

alkane mix (n-C15 to n-C29) with known isotopic composition. The stable carbon isotope 

composition is reported in the delta notation (?13C) vs. the VPDB Standard. 

Samples for XRD, Sr, total organic carbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen

stable isotope were extracted from transversal and longitudinal cuts and micro-drilled 

along radial and longitudinal profiles. 

 

5.3 Results 

5.3.1 Types and morphologies of the MDAC 

Based on macroscopic, morphological and textural characteristics in hand specimens, 

the more than 134 studied individual carbonate samples have been classified into 2 main 

different types: (I) crusts, nodules and chimneys with the mineralogy dominated by 

dolomite and high Mg-calcite and (II) crusts, pavements or buildups with mineralogy 

dominated by aragonite. In each one of these types, sub-types were defined. On the 

dolomite type the following sub-types were identified: Dolomite crusts (DCr); Dolomite 

Chimneys (DCh); Nodules or irregular massive forms (Nod). On the aragonite build-up or 

pavement type (AragPav) the following sub-types were defined: Lithified mud volcano 

mud breccia (LMb); Shell crusts (SCr); Intraformational breccias (IBr); Lithified fragments 

of dolomite chimneys (LDChy); Stromatolitic layers (Str) and Fossilised biofilms (Fbf). 

 

5.3.1.1 Dolomite chimneys (DChy) 

The terminology dolomite “chimney” is used in this work with a descriptive sense, 

indicating samples with a pipe-like or a conduit-like morphology. It is not used with a 

genetic connotation of the formation process in the water column as a resemblance with the 

hydrothermal vent chimneys. This term is preferred because it has always been used to 

describe such structures not only in the Gulf of Cadiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2001; 

Magalhães et al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003) but also in many 

other cold seepage areas (Kulm and Suess, 1990; Greinert et al., 2001). The terminology of 

chimney is adequate to these samples if the term is considered with the meaning of a fluid 

conduit. 

The recovered dolomite chimneys (DChy) are composed of compact, in general 

tightly carbonate-cemented, medium light grey to light brown colour sandstone/mudstone. 

Their shape is in general cylindrical or conical, exhibiting a wide range sizes from 10 to 70 

cm in length and from 1 to 35 cm in diameter. During underwater video observations it 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 149

was possible to identify chimneys up to 4 m long and with a diameter up to 0.5 m. The 

mineralogy, as described in Table 5.1 and in more detail in section 5.3.3, is characterized 

by the presence of dolomite as the major constituent of the cement. 

Based on their morphologies, several subtypes of chimneys were defined: (1) tubular 

(single or with 2 or 3 parallel tubes cemented together), (2) conical, (3) doughnut shaped, 

(4) spiral and (5) branched (Figure 5.3). 

Relatively to the vent channel, some chimneys are completely filled, without any 

open and clear channel, while others show an open and sometimes large (up to half of the 

total diameter, c.a. 15 cm) vent orifice(s) that has the same shape than the chimney 

(straight, tortuous, ramified or helical). In general, the chimneys completely filled exhibit 

growth concentric ring layers. The outer walls of most of the chimneys (as the inner wall in 

the ones with an open channel) are iron oxide stained, with a dark red to dark brown 

colour. The chimneys that do not show any signs of this iron coating exhibit a pale yellow 

to medium light grey colour. Colonisation of the chimneys by fixed benthic fauna, like 

incrusting sponges (Porifera), corals, bivalve shells or brachiopod clusters is common, 

especially on the chimneys with the dark iron oxides coating. These samples are frequently 

nailed by scavenger burrows of 1 to 2 mm in diameter and several cm in length, forming 

sinusoidal holes coming from the sample exterior. No mollusc shells or fragment of 

heterotrophic organisms, intact or even corroded, are found cemented inside the chimneys. 

This is the opposite of what is observed on aragonite pavement samples or as it has been 

described on samples typical from active seeping sites e.g. Paull et al., (1992) and Sibuet 

and Olu (1998). 

The presence of iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides is interpreted as resulting from 

secondary oxidation of sulphur minerals (pyrite), occurring after exhumation of the 

samples, when they were in contact with the seawater, or in the oxidation zone of the 

sediment column. This exhumation is probably the result of erosion and sediment removal 

due to strong bottom water currents like the MO. This explains why some chimneys have 

different characteristics in the upper and the lower parts. Some samples present a reddish 

to brownish coloured upper part with higher frequency of holes, scavenging features and 

benthic fauna, more tightly cemented and more intensely coated with oxides, while the 

bottom part is less cohesive and less oxidized, as reflected by the more greyish colours. 

This is interpreted as the result of a longer period of contact of the upper oxidized part of 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 150 

the sample with the seawater, during the progressive exhumation of the sample. Some 

samples like the one presented in Figure 5.4C clearly present oxidation fronts of growing 

intensity of the oxidation to the external part of the chimney and to the interior open vent 

channel. The internal material, not in contact to the exterior if less oxidized. This is 

indicating that the oxidation is a secondary process occurring with the change of the 

geochemical environment, probably related to the exhumation of the sample. Around 

burrows or scavenger channels, that promote the circulation of seawater within the sample, 

it is also possible to see similar oxidation fronts. The chimneys composed of finer grain 

size detrital fraction have lower porosity and lower permeability than the chimneys with a 

detrital fraction of silt to sand size. All these silty to sandy chimneys present higher 

oxidation intensities and only some scarce clayish chimneys are not oxidized. 

Singular pyrite framboids or small pyrite clusters are observed by SEM on the non-

oxidized dolomite chimneys, dolomite crusts and nodules. Pyrite is absent from the 

intensely oxidized samples. On the weak oxidized samples, pyrite, if observed, shows signs 

of oxidation forming rims of iron oxides (probably containing OH-groups). This is also 

visible on thin sections as brownish stain that is reflected on the reddish to brownish colour 

of the hand samples. 

Some of the chimneys present a incipient layering perpendicularly to the vent 

direction, that in some situations is shown by fractures or weakness zones that contribute to 

the segmentation and division of the chimneys (if this segmentation is closely-spaced then 

the chimneys present a doughnut-shape where the length of the chimney is very small 

compared to the diameter). In other situations, the layering is revealed by a increasing of 

the diameter of the chimney (forming nodular protuberances) or changes on the 

granulometry of the detrital fraction (see Figure 5.4). In one sample, it was possible to 

consider that an dolomite crust was being formed perpendicularly to the chimney conduit, 

as the result of cementation along a conduit that crossed perpendicularly a more permeable 

layer and the fluid migration developed also along this layer and also promoting their 

cementation. 

The helicoidally, curved and branched chimneys (Figure 5.3F and G) probably 

correspond to cemented borrow infills. 

Based on the morphology, mineralogy, petrography and geochemistry, the dolomite 

chimneys are interpreted as corresponding to cemented fluid conduits. Depending on the 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 151

sediment properties and fluid flow rate, different regimes of fluid flow can be expected: (1) 

Migration trough diffusion, that is expected to occur in the sediments with a higher grain 

size and that in general correspond to conduits with no open vent channels; (2) Migration 

trough (hydraulic) fracturing, as migration of clusters, as a flow through a single channel or 

as a flow through a canalized network (Stöhr et al., 2005). Burrows and other sedimentary 

structures and heterogeneities can be preferential pathways for this plumbing system. This 

flux regime in finer sediments will preferably maintain an open vent channel. This is 

supported by the observation that the chimneys with open vent channels are characterized 

by a finer detrital fraction. 

 

5.3.1.2 Dolomite crusts (DCr) 

Dolomite crusts (DCr) have planar shapes, up to 5 cm thick and up to 44 cm long 

(Figure 5.3A), although larger specimens were identifiable on underwater observations. 

They are generally covered by a dark red or dark brown coating of Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides. 

Colonization of the crusts by fixed benthic fauna is common and more intense on crusts 

with more intense coating. The samples with more intense coating present scavenger 

burrows of 1 to 2 mm in diameter and several cm in length forming sinusoidal holes 

coming from the sample exterior. 

The dolomite crusts are composed of pale yellowish to light brown (indicating the 

presence of Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides) fine-grained and tightly cemented carbonate 

sandstone/mudstone, very homogeneous with no internal structure. Present in general, low 

porosity, just microporous and absence of macroporous or internal channels. Shells or 

biogenic components incorporated in the crust are absent (except for foraminifera and 

cocolitic tests). Based on the morphology, texture, mineralogy and geochemistry, the 

dolomite crusts are interpreted as cemented sedimentary layers.

front spreading from this hole; (C) completely filled chimney sample exhibiting concentric grow layers; (D) 

chimney with 2 parallel vent channels that are jointed at a an intermediate length; (E) chimney with two 

parallel and open vent channels. 

 

5.3.1.3 Dolomite nodules (Nod) 

This type corresponds to nodular, massive, round or irregular forms (Figure 5.3H), 

composed of compact sandstone/mudstone. The texture, colour, mineralogy and 

petrography of this type is similar to the chimneys, with light brown or grey colours, often 

coated by dark brown Mn/Fe oxy-hydroxides. The presence of oxidation rims progressing 

from the exterior to the interior of the samples is frequently observed. These samples are 

characterized by a dense homogeneous matrix of terrigenous (detrital quartz, feldspar and 

clay minerals) and foraminifers, completely cemented by micrite to microsparite carbonate 

composed of mixtures of dolomite, calcite and high Mg-calcite. Like the chimneys they do

formation model 

 154 

not include mollusc shells or fragments of heterotrophic organisms as part of the 

constituent material. The shells or organisms, when present, represent secondary 

colonization of the surface of the samples by benthic fauna. The size of the collected 

samples is up to 45 cm in diameter. 

 

5.3.1.4 Aragonite crusts and pavements (AragPav) 

Aragonite crusts and pavements are porous, whitish, light brownish grey to dark grey 

aragonite dominated carbonate. Their mineralogy is dominated by aragonite and calcite, 

cementing a detrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud breccia clasts, 

shell fragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. Aragonite crusts and pavements 

present in general tabular shapes (as revealed by the retrieved samples and by the 

underwater video observations) or irregular block like or build-up shapes. The samples 

collected are up to 50 cm in thickness and up to 1 m in length. 

Different lithologic types of aragonite pavements were identified: (i) lithified mud 

volcano breccias; (ii) shell crusts; (iii) intraformational breccias; (iv) lithified fragments of 

dolomite chimneys/crusts; (v) stromatolitic layers; (vi) fossilised biofilms. Several subtypes 

can coexist at the same location and some times in the same sample. 

 

5.3.1.4.1 Lithified mud volcano breccias (LMb) 

Lithified mud volcano breccias correspond to very porous, weak to moderated 

carbonate-cemented mud volcano breccias (Figure 5.5A). The collected samples present, in 

general, irregular block-like shapes, up to 50 cm in diameter. Most probably, the recovered 

shapes result from the fragmentation of the samples during the sampling process. 

Underwater video observations have shown that they form pavements with several square 

meters of rough seafloor (Figure 5.6B). 

They present in general brownish colours, indicating a moderate oxidation 

environment, to dark grey or black colours, indicating a reduced environment. Some 

samples present an sharp interface of those different oxidation environments, the top part 

of the sample presenting a brownish colour, interpreted as corresponding to the seawater 

dominated environment, while the deeper part has a dark grey colour corresponding to 

subsurface anoxic sediment environment.

Aragonite pavement LMb are characterized by distinctive mud volcano breccia clasts 

with up to 3 cm in diameter, sub-angular to very angular shapes, randomly oriented. These 

clasts are very similar to the ones that are characteristic of the mud breccia material 

collected on the various mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

Lithified mud volcano breccias are in general cement-supported. The matrix is 

composed of the clayish mud breccia clasts, silt to sand-size quartz and feldspar grains, 

coccolithids, radiolarians, diatoms and foraminifera skeletons, as well as detrital clay 

minerals. Singular pyrite crystals, or small clusters randomly distributed or arranged in 

short lamina, are also present. The cement is fine grained granular (micrite to sparitic) in 

generally poly-mineralic: aragonite, calcite and high Mg-calcite. Some LMb samples 

present stromatolitic layers of fibrous, botryoidal mono-mineralic cement (see section 

5.3.1.4.5) composed of microspar to sparite aragonite needles 10 to 40 µm across and up to 

1 mm in length with less or no impurities of the detrital sediment matrix that are described 

in more detail as stromatolithic layers. 

Frequent linear holes of tubular shape, with 2 to 8 mm in diameter, were interpreted 

as Pogonophora worm casts. Alternatively, the linear holes could also be interpreted as 

venting conduits along which fluid migration is focused and around which precipitation is 

enhanced. Live Pogonophora were retrieved with some of the LMb in sites of interpreted 

more intense or recent venting activity, as revealed by the live chemoautotrophic 

communities. 

 

5.3.1.4.2 Shell crusts (SCr) 

Shell crusts (Figure 5.5B) correspond to aragonite pavement samples with high 

amount of bioclasts, mainly of Calyptogena sp., Solemyidae and Lucinoma, Acharax shells 

and Pogonophora tube worms, incorporated in the fine grained granular (micrite to micro-

spar) mono-mineral (aragonite) or poly-phase (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite) cement. 

Sessile organisms, like small corals, brachiopods and small sponges are also found 

attached, and some times incorporated into the crusts. Some of the Acharax shells are still 

enclosed by an intact periostracum indicating in situ cementation. Like on the LMb the SCr 

also show tubular holes (2 to 8 mm in diameter) interpreted as Pogonophora worm casts or 

as venting conduits along which fluid migration is focused and where the authigenic-



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 157

carbonate precipitation is enhanced. Incorporated Calyptogena, Acharax and open channels 

of Pogonophora casts indicate that the crust formation took place near or at the seafloor. 

Shell crusts show different degrees of oxidation and different intensities of iron 

oxides coating. They have brownish colours, indicating moderate oxidation, or grey to 

black colours, indicating redox environment. Samples presenting a sharp interface between 

these two different degrees of oxidation are also found, with a top part of the sample 

presenting a brownish colour and colonized by benthic organisms, interpreted as 

corresponding to the seawater or oxic superficial sediment column. And with a deeper part 

presenting a dark grey colour with no signs of benthic organisms that is interpreted as 

corresponding to anoxic sub-superficial sediment column. 

The crusts are grain or cement-supported, moderated to very strongly cemented with 

low to medium macro-porosity of irregular shaped and randomly interconnected open 

cracks and cavities up to 2 cm in diameter. Because this type presented the best densely 

cemented samples of all the different pavement types, the SCr correspond to the largest 

retrieved samples (up to 1 m in length and 40 cm thick). The underwater video 

observations revealed that they can form pavements with rough surfaces littering the 

seafloor for several meters or forming buildups. 

 

5.3.1.4.3 Intraformational breccias (IBr) 

Intraformational breccias (Figure 5.5C) exhibit tabular crust morphologies that pave 

the seafloor or form irregular shaped buildups at the seafloor. These breccias are 

interpreted as sin-formational breccias, composed of chaotically oriented matrix-like 

carbonate intra-clasts (up to 3 cm in size, interpreted as fragments from previous aragonite 

pavements), bioturbation casts, rare shells and can also include poorly lithified mud breccia 

clasts typical of the lithified mud volcano breccia type. 

Intraformational breccias are in general clast-supported with clay and silt size 

terrigenous sediment, in general intensely cemented by randomly oriented fibrous sparitic 

aragonite and/or fine grained granular poly-phase micrite to microspar aragonite, calcite 

and high Mg-calcite (this, more abundant in the intraclasts). They present medium to high 

porosity with abundant irregular shaped and randomly interconnected plumbing networks 

of mesopores, open cracks and cavities that lead to the pseudobrecciated collapse texture 

for this sample type. This lithologic type is interpreted as sin-formational i.e. the fractures 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 158 

and pore spaces were formed during the cementation and maintained open. Some 

mesopores present a cover with stromatolitic layers of botryoidal white aragonite cements. 

Framboidal pyrite sometime occurring as layers, parallel to the stromatolitic lamina, are an 

indicator of the formation in anoxic microenvironments. Some of the pyrite shows a 

secondary oxidation phase indicating a change in environment. 

This lithologic type is interpreted as indicating a superficial formation process. It can 

be explained by mechanisms involving gas hydrate formation and decomposition. This 

lithology corresponds to the intraformational breccias, gas hydrate carbonates and 

aragonite collapse breccias as defined by Bohrmann et al., (1998) and Greinert et al., 

(2001). The brecciation can also result from ascending fluids, bubbles and pressure build 

up, as a result of the accumulation of methane gas below the crust and subsequent violent 

gas escape, as described by Hovland et al. (1987) for MDAC in North Sea pockmarks. The 

growing of gas hydrate pieces or layers and subsequent decomposition produces large 

volume expansion that can also produce sediment disruption at the seafloor and 

brecciation, as described at the shallow seeps in the Cascadia Subduction zone Hydrate 

Ridge (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; Greinert et al., 2002) and in the Gulf 

of Mexico (MacDonald et al., 2003). One other mechanism can explain this lithology. The 

gas hydrates form layers and veins along which the cementation by carbonates is 

prevented. When the gas hydrate free host sediment is cemented the hydrate-bearing parts 

will build pores after the gas hydrate decomposition (that can occur in situ or during the 

sample recovery). 

 

5.3.1.4.4 Lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts (LDChy) 

Lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts (LDChy) are clast supported 

breccias with dolomite clasts that have petrographic, mineralogical and isotopic 

characteristics of the dolomite nodules, crusts and chimneys. Therefore, these clasts are 

interpreted as fragments of dolomite chimneys (DChy) and crusts (DCr) that were 

cemented during secondary episodes of MDAC precipitation. The LDChy samples (Figure 

5.5D) were collected by dredging the flank of the Guadalquivir Channel. The recovered 

specimens of this type consist on 3 fragments up to 12 cm in size, with irregular to sub 

rounded morphologies that are probably the result of the sampling operation by dredging. 

The clasts present up to 7 cm in size and are strongly stained with iron oxides. They 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 159

present in general sub-round shapes that indicate significant transport of the clasts by deep 

currents along the step flank of the Cadiz MO Channel or it can be a consequence of their 

original nodular shape of concretion-like morphologies. The pebbles are cemented by a 

porous and weakly to moderated lithified poly-phase carbonate of microspar aragonite and 

calcite. The cement has pale to light brown colours indicating variable degrees of 

oxidation. 

 

5.3.1.4.5 Stromatolitic layers (SL) 

Stromatolitic layers are present in all the different lithologic aragonite pavement 

types (with exception for the LDChy) but, on the studied samples, their occurrence is more 

frequent on the intraformational breccias and on the lithified mud volcano breccias. It 

corresponds to stromatolitic laminas of an almost pure fibrous aragonite phase that 

recovers the internal surface of pore spaces, voids, tubular cavities and fractures (Figure 

5.5E) of AragPav samples. Theses stromatolitic layers, up to 10 mm in thickness, present 

an external smooth surface with domal, isopachous layers of aggregates and botryoidal 

rims of sparite fibrous aragonite needles that grow in the direction of the centre of the 

cavities. The undulated laminas pattern, similar to the cauliflower-like structures of the 

stromatolites, grow on top and, in general, parallel to the cavities surfaces, on top of the 

fine grained (micritic to microsparitic) aragonite and calcite cement of the LMb, SCr and 

IBr. Because this fabric occurs associated with structures interpreted as fossilised biofilms, 

the SL formation is interpreted as induced by the encrustation of microbial mats. 

The stromatolitic layers are similar to the ones reported by Greinert et al., (2002) 

exhibiting inverted stromatolitic grow direction when compared with the true stromatactis. 

He emphasize that the stromatolites in methane-derived crusts grow in the direction of the 

source of energy, protruding downwards from shallow sediment horizons. AOM proceeds 

below pre-existing carbonate crusts and is aggregating downwards. The stromatolitic 

layers of the studied samples presents complex growth patterns. Along some cavities, the 

stromatolitic layers are growing in the direction of the centre of the cavity. When the shape 

of the pore (usually elongated pores up to 2x12 cm) of irregular to lenticular shape 

resemble the shape of the collected chunks of gas hydrates (from some mud volcanoes), 

these pores can be interpreted as relicts of gas hydrate pieces, veins or cavities filed with 

gas or methane riche pore fluids. In some larger cavities the botryoidal aragonite layers 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 160 

aggregation occurs downward from the top of the cavity. In this situations the stromatolitic 

layers are interpreted as representing the roof of the cavities where the methane is being 

trapped, leading to a more intense AOM in this part of the cavity. So this fabric is expected 

to occur whenever the environmental conditions favours near surface gas hydrate 

formation/decomposition. 

This fabric represents a second stage of mineralization of the aragonite pevements. 

The micritic to microspar calcite, Mg-calcite and fine grained aragonite precipitates, 

cementing the clay rich detrital matrix before the later stage of the fibrous aragonite 

stromatolitic layers formation. 

 

5.3.1.4.6 Fossilised biofilms (Fbf) 

SEM and thin section observations of the aragonite pavements frequently show thin 

sheets and threads lying over and between the aragonite needles, sometimes evolving the 

aragonite needles or at the transition between different stromatolitic layers. These 

structures, are described and discussed in Chapter 8, are interpreted as fossilised microbial 

biofilms and mucous biofilms, relicts of micro-organisms. They were found exclusively 

associated with the stromatolitic layers, on top of the botryoidal aragonite layers or 

between different aragonite layers. 

 

5.3.2 Occurrence and Underwater observations 

Seep sites and authigenic carbonate deposits were initially assumed to be isolated 

occurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz. The increasing detail and survey coverage during the last 

years allowed the recognition of various cold seeps and MDAC occurrences between 400 

and 4000 m water depth, indicating that these features are far more common than 

previously anticipated (Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). The evaluation of the distribution of 

seafloor fluid seepage indicators observed on underwater video profiles and during sample 

retrieval by video controlled grab, and their correlation with sediment samples and acoustic 

characteristics on the seismic profiles and side-scan sonar backscatter images, indicate that 

the occurrence of the MDAC and the seep sites are in close relation with mud volcanoes, 

mud diapirs and probable deep routed faults. Such structures are the preferential pathways 

for fluid circulation and escape.

5.3.2.1 Dolomite crusts and chimneys 

Dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules occur as high density fields where they occur 

some times very fragmented and lying on the seafloor (Figure 5.6A). It is rare to find 

chimneys in a vertical position, protruding from the sediments. On a video line in the 

Cadiz MO Channel chimneys are reported to occur in situ and not completely extruded 

from the sedimentary formation where they formed (Chapter 9) and there it was possible to 

recognize in some situations a sub-parallel orientation of some chimneys relative to the 

sedimentary layering while other chimneys clearly present a sub-vertical orientation also 

supported by the apparent layering interpreted in some chimneys. The dolomite crusts, 

chimneys and nodule occurrences are restricted to areas characterized by moderated to 

strong bottom currents. Those are considered to be able to produce active erosion of the 

surrounding unconsolidated sediments within which the chimneys grew, inducing the 

exhumation of the chimneys and their consequent fallowing down and fragmentation. 

Large colonies of sea urchins, Cnidaria (Hydrozoa and Anthozoa), Mollusca 

(Gastropoda and Bivalvia burrows), Annelida (Polychaeta), Arthropoda (Decapoda), 

Brachiopoda, Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea and 

Holothuroidea) use the carbonates as a hard ground for fixation. Unambiguous 

chemosynthetic communities were not identified at sites of exclusive occurrence of 

dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules. Chemosynthetic communities were identified only 

at sites characterized by the occurrence of the aragonite pavement types. At the 

Hesperides, Faro and Student mud volcanoes, and off Gibraltar, occurrences of dolomite 

chimneys and aragonite pavements are found in close spatial proximity or simultaneously. 

However the observed field geometry relationships between the different MDAC indicate 

that they had distinct formation periods. The morphologic and textural characteristics of 

the aragonite pavement carbonates show indicators of a recent or present day formation 

while the dolomite carbonates, which occur as fragments and remobilized pieces, indicate 

older formation episodes.

5.3.2.2 Aragonite pavements 

The aragonite pavements appear in the seafloor as buildups, some times with 

dimensions up to 2-4 m, or as rough hard-grounds (up to 50-80 cm thick) that can paving 

the seafloor for areas of several square meters, with a thin or absent sediment cover (Figure 

5.6B). 

Colonization of these pavements by benthic fauna is frequent. Aggregates of clam 

shells, probably most of them dead, were identified in several places. Live chemosynthetic 

fauna (Calyptogena, Acharax and Pogonofera tube worms) were identified and sampled in 

small areas and at sites where the venting activity is considered to be more recent or more 

intense. Small patches of probable bacterial mats were identified only at one location in the 

Faro mud volcano. They were not detected at the scales normally found in areas of intense 

and active seeps like in the Gulf of Mexico or in the East Mediterranean. This is 

interpreted as indicating a present day state of low or inactive fluid venting at the seafloor. 

This is also confirmed by the low to mid range microbial methane turnover and AOM 

activity in the measured mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al., 2006). 

Gas bubbles and sites of active fluid migration were observed only at two locations in the 

Mercator mud volcano crater, in areas of highly gas-saturated mud breccia.

5.3.3 Mineralogy, petrography and SEM 

5.3.3.1 Dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules 

Dolomite crusts, nodular and chimneys consist essentially of medium to tightly 

carbonate-cemented mudstones, siltstones, wackstones and sandstones (Figure 8.3, Chapter 

8). Petrographic and XRD studies show that their mineralogical composition consists of 

dolomite, protodolomite, high-Mg calcite, calcite, quartz, feldspar and clays (Figure 5.8). 

The detrital fraction corresponds to a fossiliferous matrix with abundant bioclasts of 

planktonic foraminifera (globigerinoids), ostracods, pellets and silty terrigenous grains of 

quartz, calcite, feldspars and clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in 

almost all the samples, staining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the 

degree of oxidation of the sample. On samples with low or no oxidation it is possible to 

recognize, on thin section and SEM, singular pyrite framboids or small pyrite clusters with 

oxidation rims of brownish iron oxides that probably contain OH-groups. 

The degree of cementation corresponds to an almost complete infilling of the original 

pore space and therefore, all the different dolomite types show low porosity with absence 

of mega-porous and scarce fractures or cracks. The contacts between cemented grains are 

irregular, ranging from complete to inter-grain pore spaces with dimensions, in general, 

lower than 10 µm, leaving little residual porosity. The cement is composed of micrite to 

micro-sparite equigranular rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite, protodolomite and 

dolomite with dimensions of less than 15 µm (Figure 8.4, Chapter 8). The texture varies 

from isolated rhombohedra and aggregates of interlocking subhedral to euhedral crystals 

on a tight mosaic of interlocking subhedral crystals. The individual dolomite rhombohedra 

have diameters in the range of 2-15 µm, sometimes exhibiting serrated crystal faces. The 

contacts between detrital grains and the cement are dictated by the shape of the detrital 

grain. The carbonates are not observed dissolving or replacing the detrital grains. 

No significant zoning of the individual dolomite crystals, either by petrographic, 

cathodoluminescence or SEM-EDS was observed. The carbonate cement shows no 

luminescence in cathodoluminescence observations. Since no textural evidence of calcite 

replacement by dolomite was observed, dolomite is considered to be primary authigenic 

micritic cement. Detailed description on the petrography and SEM observation of the 

dolomite dominated carbonates is presented in Chapter 8, section 8.3.1.1.

studied dolomite dominated samples. 

 

After correction of the diffraction peaks of calcite and dolomite in function of the 

major diffraction peak of quartz, it is possible to recognize that the major diffraction peak 

of calcite d(104) differs from those of stoichiometric calcite d(104) = 3.035 Å. This shift 

can result from the Ca2+ substitution by Mg2+ and/or Fe2+ and Mn2+ (Goldsmith and Graf, 

1958). EDS analyses performed during SEM observations indicate that, in general, only Ca 

and Mg were detected on the calcite and dolomite minerals. Fe was detected in some 

samples, representing relative proportions of less then 10% of the total (Ca + Mg + Fe). 

The Fe is most probably coming from the iron oxides. This is also supported by the 

cathodoluminescence microscopy observations that do not indicate the presence of 

significant amounts of Fe or Mn in the carbonate phases. Therefore, the shift of the d(104) 

dolomite diffraction peak is assumed to result from the Ca/Mg replacement. Estimates of 

the Mg/Ca ratios are reported in Figure 5.7, based on the Goldsmith and Graf (1958) 

equation, with a maximum error of 9 mol MgCO3 % (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958).

Dolomite Samples

 
Figure 5.8. Box-whisker diagrams of the mineralogical composition and carbonate content of the dolomite 

dominated samples. 

 

Dolomite is the dominant carbonate mineral with mean values of 60, 78 and 61 wt% 

on DCr, DChy and Nod, respectively (Figure 5.8). In some crusts and chimneys, dolomite 

forms the entire carbonate mineral fraction. The dolomite corresponds to fairly constant 

MgCO3 content between 45 and 47 mol%. The dolomite content in the sediment collected 

within the carbonate samples is lower and possibly corresponds, at least partially, to 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 168 

fragments of carbonate samples incorporated in the surrounding sediments. Sediment 

samples collected in the vicinity but out of the chimney fields show absence of dolomite. 

This confirms the petrographic and XRD observations that dolomite is the predominant 

authigenic mineral in the DCr, DChy and Nod samples. Protodolomite is present on the 

DChy and Nod samples (up to 32% wt%) with 30 to 37 mol% of MgCO3. Calcite and Mg-

calcite are the major constituents with up to 93% wt%. Calcite is the main carbonate 

mineral in the surrounding sediments and has a tendency to lower magnesium content on 

their lattice that in the calcite from the MDAC. 

The detrital fraction, composed mainly of quartz, feldspars and clays, ranges from 5 

to 92% wt% of the MDAC, with average values of 27, 33 and 34% wt% for Nod, DCr and 

DChy, respectively. In the surrounding sediments the non carbonate fraction corresponds 

to more than 50% wt% of the sediment. 

SEM observations (as described in more detail in Chapter 8) allowed the 

identification of a high diversity of microbial induced fabrics such as: (1) microbial 

filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomitic crystal aggregates that mimetize microbial 

filaments through calcification, that these aggregates often incorporated in larger dolomite 

and calcite minerals; (3) carbonate rods with brush-like terminations; (4) carbonates with 

dumbbell-like and cauliflower structures (Figure 8.8 to 8.13, Chapter 8). Precipitation of 

similar crystal aggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in laboratory 

experiments using sulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Warthmann et al., 

2000; Van Lith et al., 2003a; Van Lith et al., 2003b). These microbial filaments and 

structures match the typical size of the microbial filaments and structures observed on 

SEM, indicating that those are clearly related to the precipitation of the carbonates and do 

not correspond to any form of contamination. Therefore, and because of their low ?13C 

values, the structures observed on SEM are interpreted as representing an important 

involvement of microbial activity in the formation of the authigenic carbonate minerals. 

 

5.3.3.2 Aragonite crusts and pavements 

The petrography and mineralogy of the different aragonite crusts and pavements 

have common characteristics. The mineralogy is dominated by aragonite, with subordinate 

calcite and high Mg-calcite. Aragonite pavement samples are characterized by the absence 

or by minor amounts of dolomite (less than 4% wt%), identified only on two of the 17 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 169

studied samples. On shell fragments collected from a shell crust sample, dolomite was 

detected by XRD on 3 samples, with values ranging from 9 to 26% wt% (Figure 5.11). 

Therefore, the detected dolomite on the cement of the aragonite pavement sample can 

derive from the shells or can have an authigenic origin. Quartz, feldspars and clay minerals 

compose the detrital minerals of the host sediments, with amounts ranging from 6 to 39% 

wt% (Figure 5.10). It should be noted that the clastic fraction occurs in lower average 

amounts on the stromatolitic layers (11% wt%). Aragonite is more abundant in the 

carbonate samples than in the background sediment (6% wt%), confirming the 

petrographic observations that aragonite is the major authigenic mineral. 

Pyrite was not detected on XRD but it was observed on thin sections and by SEM. 

Pyrite occurs as individual spheres, framboids and small pyrite clusters forming incipient 

layers or lineaments. In general, the pyrite is partially to almost completely oxidized to iron 

oxides and/or hydroxides, that on thin section form brownish rims and stains. The detailed 

mineralogy of the iron oxides was not determined. 

The aragonite pavements and crusts have a higher porosity when compared to the 

dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules. The aragonite pavement samples present large 

macro-porosity due to the large amount of voids, fractures, tubular and irregular cavities, 

some of them interconnected, but they also have higher inter-granular pore spaces. 

On the authigenic cements of the aragonite pavement samples two distinct texture 

types can be defined (Figure 8.17, Chapter 8): fine grained texture, and stromatolitic 

fibrous texture. These two textures differ in porosity, mineral content and crystal shape. 

The fine grained granular texture (Figure 8.17, Chapter 8) is characteristic of the 

cement of the lithified mud volcano mud breccias (LMb), of the shell crusts (SCr), of the 

intraformational breccias (IBr) and of the lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts 

(LDChy). This texture is characterized by a complex poly-phase mineralogy of granular 

and fibrous aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite crystals. Aragonite is the dominant mineral 

but the relative proportion on the carbonate fraction is not as high as in the fibrous texture. 

The detrital components (quarts, feldspars and clays) and siliceous/calcareous microfossils 

are present here in higher proportions than on the fibrous texture. The fine grained 

aragonite and calcite ranges from micrite to microspar crystals. The detrital grains and 

clasts (of mud volcano mud breccia, fragments of dolomite chimneys, clasts of the 

intraformational breccias or shell fragments) are cemented and inter-grown by fibrous to 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 170 

granular aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite, suggesting that the aragonite precipitated within 

unconsolidated and very weakly compacted sediments. Pyrite is also found in these texture, 

as individual framboids and small clusters, partially to almost completely oxidized and 

dispersed on the fine grained mass. 

Stromatolitic texture (Figure 5.5F) is representative of the stromatolitic layers (SL), 

described in section 5.3.1.4.5. It is characterized by up to 1.5 mm long fibrous aragonite 

needles, typically occurring in layers or radiating aggregates or bundles that recover the 

pore spaces, cavities and fracture walls in the different aragonite pavements. The 

stromatolitic texture in general does not completely fill the pore spares, voids, fractures 

and tubular cavities. As described in section 5.3.1.4.6 and in Chapter 8, these layers are 

also characterized by the presence of microbial and mucous biofilms. The mineralogy is 

dominated by aragonite, with minor amounts of calcite and detrital fraction. Mg-calcite is 

absent or occurs as minor component. From thin section observation it is possible to 

recognise that the content of detrital grains in this texture is clearly less important or 

negligible when compared to the fine grained texture. Pyrite is found, in general, as 

framboids or small clusters aligned parallel to the stromatolitic layers, partially to almost 

completely oxidized. 

The fibrous texture represents a later stage of authigenic carbonate formation that 

clearly has grown over the previous fine grained granular texture. It has not been observed 

any situation where the stromatolitc texture has been overlain by the fine grained granular 

texture. 

SEM observations revealed a high diversity of microbial induced fabrics, such as 

microbial filaments (Figure 8.23, Chapter 8), microbial and mucous biofilm sheets and 

threads draped between aragonite needles (Figure 8.26, Chapter 8), aragonite batons, ball-

capped batons (0.20-0.70 µm) and nanograins.

5.3.4 CaCO3 and Total Organic Carbon 

The carbonate content of the three dolomite-dominated MDAC lithologic types is 

very similar, with a mean value of 72% (wt%) and with values ranging from 32 to 93% 

(wt%). The carbonate content of these lithologic types is significantly higher than the mean 

CaCO3 value of the background sediment (~34 wt%, Figure 5.11). Based on these 

observations, it can be concluded that the MDAC contain, on average, ~38 wt% of 

authigenic carbonate cement (although this value can reach a maximum of up to 60% 

wt%). 

The carbonate content of the different aragonite crusts and pavements has average 

values ranging from 77 to 90% wt% (Figure 5.9). These values are significantly higher 

than the average CaCO3 values in the background sediment (~30% wt%), indicating that 

the aragonite crusts and pavements contain 40 to 60% wt% of authigenic carbonate 

cement.

AragPev-Corals and Shells

 
Figure 5.11. Box-whisker diagrams of the mineralogical composition and carbonate content of sediment 

samples collected at the places near the MDAC occurrences and of shells and corals collected from the 

MDAC. 

 

As regards the organic carbon (Corg) content of the MDAC samples, it is inferior to 

0.4% (dry wt%) with an average value of about 0.1%. These values are lower than those 

characteristic of the pelagic sediments of the slope and rise of the Gulf of Cadiz, in general 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 174 

in the range of 0.5% and 1.5% (DGM-INETI MarSed samples database, (Schonfeld, 2001). 

Pelagic sediments collected at the Iberico dome, where authigenic carbonates where 

collected, have organic carbon (Corg) values of 0.88% (wt%). On the Tasyo, Carlos 

Ribeiro, Olenin and Bonjardim mud volcanoes, the mud volcano mud breccia shows values 

in the range between 0.12 and 0.96% (dry weight %). This may indicate that during the 

MDAC formation, part of the organic carbon available on the sediments was consumed. 

 

5.3.5 C and O stable isotopes 

Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes were measured on 117 bulk samples of dolomite 

crusts, chimneys, nodules, aragonite pavements and also on bivalve shells. The results of 

the measurements are presented on Figure 5.12. Carbon isotope results show depleted ?13C 

values between –56.2‰ and -8.4‰ VPDB indicating a methane-derived carbon source 

(Friedman and O'Neil, 1977). Dolomite lithologic types have ?13C values between -46.9‰ 

and -8.4‰ VPDB, whereas the aragonite lithologic types have values in the range of -

56.2‰ to -14.3‰ VPDB. Within the different types of dolomite samples and within the 

different types of aragonite pavements there is not a significant and distinctive difference 

in the carbon isotopic composition. 

Stable isotopic analyses of oxygen show ??18O values varying from 0.8‰ up to 6.8‰ 

VPDB (Figure 5.12). Dolomite lithologic types present ??18O values between 0.8‰ and 

6.8‰ VPDB, while values of the aragonite lithologic types range from 3.1‰ to 5.2‰ 

VPDB and do not show any significant and distinctive variability of values between the 

different MDAC types. 

Samples of biogenic calcite from corals and bivalve shells attached to the surface of 

dolomite chimneys yielded and ?13C average value of 0.09‰ VPDB, and a ?18O average 

value of 2.44‰ VPDB. The isotopic composition of shells collected from the aragonite 

shell crust type has average values of ?13C of -12.1‰ VPDB and a ?18O average value of 

3.0‰ VPDB. 

Radial and longitudinal profiles of samples along the chimneys present in some cases 

a clear linear variation that in some other samples seems to be more complex.

5.3.6 Sr Isotopes and seawater Influence 

The strontium isotopic composition of the carbonate minerals reflects the strontium 

isotopic composition of the water in which they formed (Hess et al., 1986). The variation 

of the strontium isotopic composition of seawater is well defined (Elderfield, 1986; Farrell 

et al., 1995). Thus, strontium isotopes can be used to constrain the source of the fluids of 

authigenic carbonates.

strontium isotopic composition (Paytan et al., 1993). 

 

To evaluate the source of the fluids at the cold seeps where MDAC are formed, their 

strontium isotopic composition should be compared with the 87Sr/86Sr values of the pore 

water in nearby sedimentary sections and with that of the venting fluids and of the pore 

water from sites of active seepage. Unfortunately this data are not available for the Gulf of 

Cadiz. The nearest DSDP sites (site 120 situated on the Gorringe Bank, site 135 located at 

the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and sites 544-547 at the Moroccan margin) represent different 

geochemical environment, out of the accretionary complex setting. The available data of 

pore water 87Sr/86Sr ratios, within the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary complex, are from the 

Bonjardim, Ginsburg and Captain Arutyunov mud volcanoes (MVs), that significantly 

differ from present day seawater composition, indicate different fluid sources for the 

different MVs (Hensen et al., in press). Assuming that all the studied MDAC are recent in 

age (Pleistocene) only nominal variations in the strontium isotopic composition of the 

authigenic carbonates are to be expected if the carbonates have been formed at or very near 

the Pleistocene seafloor water. If there is an addition of strontium from deep fluids with 

different Sr isotopic compositions, as indicated from the analysed MV fluids (Hensen et 

al., in press) then it is expected that the authigenic carbonates should have Sr isotopic 

compositions that differ from that of the present day seawater. If the source of Sr captured 

in the authigenic carbonates was carried by fluids moving upwards along deep faults, then 

the 87Sr/86Sr values should reflect this deeper origin. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the different 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 178 

types of carbonate samples (dolomite chimneys and crusts and aragonite pavements) show 

values between 0.709110 and 0.709191 (Table 5.2 and Figure 5.15). These 87Sr/86Sr ratios 

reflect the isotopic signature of the present day seawater of 0.709175 (Paytan et al., 1993), 

indicating that all the authigenic carbonates were formed from seawater with Sr values 

similar to those of the present day seawater. Thus the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the analyses 

authigenic carbonates do not indicate an addition of Sr from deep-seated fluids. 

 

5.3.7 Biomarker analyses 

Specific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in dolomitic chimney samples 

(Figure 5.16). These biomarkers include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as 13C-

depleted PMI (2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane; ?13C-values of -117 and -144‰) and 

squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane; ?13C-values of -64 and -98‰). These 

compounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) 

(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). 

The aragonite crusts show better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with 

the dolomite chimneys. PMI (?13C value: ?101‰) are accompanied by unsaturated 

derivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI?; ?75‰). Isotopically-depleted PMI represents 

the most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-performing archaea 

(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Crocetane is present as one of the dominant peaks, strongly 

depleted in 13C (-132.27‰). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated version of crocetane, is also 

present with a 13C ratio of -50‰. Squalane is present but not so depleted as in the previous 

biomarkers.  

These results support the SEM observations, that indicate that the precipitation of the 

MDAC is microbially mediated, and show that Archaea have played an important role in 

the carbonate authigenesis at methane-seeps in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

Lipid biomarker analysis and interpretation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.

5.4 Discussion 

5.4.1 MDAC and their relation with MVs and deep faults 

The methane rich fluids, regardless of their thermogenic or biogenic origin, must 

migrate from their site of formation to the seabed where, as indicated by the textural and 

isotopic composition, the carbonates where precipitated. Diffusive transport of methane 

under normal vertical compaction and in a region that is not characterized by a high ocean 

primary productivity neither with high sedimentation rates, is not likely to produce large 

amounts of light hydrocarbons to induce the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. The 

Gulf of Cadiz corresponds to an accretionary wedge subjected to tectonically induced 

compaction, in addition to the normal gravitational loading (Gutscher et al., 2002; 

Gutscher, 2004). The Gulf of Cadiz is also characterized by the occurrence of mud 

volcanoes and mud diapirs that are tectonic controlled by deep structures (Pinheiro et al., 

in prep.). In these deformed sediments, the large-scale migration of fluids will be, most

formation model 

 180 

probably, conditioned and favoured along the fault zones, dipping permeable beds and 

along the mud volcanoes and diapir conduits. The result of fluid advection along those 

discrete pathways will be localized at sites of abnormally high discharge. This is in 

agreement with the field relationships and with the geological distribution of the 

occurrences of the authigenic carbonates in the Gulf of Cadiz. The authigenic carbonates 

occur whether associated with mud volcanoes (Faro, Hesperides, Ginsburg, Mercator, 

Adamastor, Meknes, and Jesus Baraza), mud diapirs (Iberico, Cornide), fault scarps (Penn 

Duick escarpment) or along ridges (GDR, Formoza ridge). The occurrences along the 

Guadalquivir and Cadiz Channels, with the GDR and Formoza ridge, are probably, part of 

the same tectonic system of trusts that correspond to the N limit of the accretionary wedge 

(Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2). 

 

5.4.2 Estimation of fluids composition and evolution 

5.4.2.1 Estimation of Pore water composition 

The carbon isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates (?13C = -56.16‰ to -

8.42‰ PDB, Figure 5.12) indicate that they originated from a moderate to extremely 13C-

depleted reservoir. For isotopic light carbon signature, two principal sources can be 

considered: (1) decomposition of organic mater, that result in typical pore waters ?13C 

values of about -25‰ PDB, and (2) methane (CH4) and higher hydrocarbons oxidation 

products (Rosenfeld and Silverman, 1959; Claypool and Kaplan, 1974). 

Two potential sources of methane can be considered in the Gulf of Cadiz: 

thermogenic and biogenic. Typically, biogenic methane formed by CO2 reduction or by 

fermentative decomposition of organic matter by micro-organisms at shallow depths is 

extremely fractionated in 13C, typically with ?13C-values between -50‰ and -110‰ PDB 

(Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Schoell, 1988). Thermogenic methane, in contrast, is isotopic 

less fractionated ranging from -50‰ to -20‰ PDB (Schoell, 1980, 1988). 

Results from organic geochemical study of gas saturated mud breccia gravity cores 

from the Porto, Bonjardim, Captain Arutyunov, and Ginsburg mud volcanoes (MV) show a 

predominantly thermogenic origin for the hydrocarbon gases (Nuzzo et al., 2005a, b; 

Stadnitskaia et al., 2006; Hensen et al., in press), but suggest distinctive fluid-generating 

environments and different secondary processes during transport (e.g., deep hydrocarbon 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 181

oxidation and mixing with brines) for the different sectors of the Gulf of Cadiz. For Porto, 

Bonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs the methane generation seems to be associated 

with deep hydrothermal activity (Hensen et al., in press). While Ginsburg MV and other 

MVs in the Moroccan margin indicate conventional thermogenic origin. Observed values 

are: Bonjardim: ?13C-CH4 = -47 to -50‰ VPDB, C1/C2+ ~10; Ginsburg: ?13C-CH4 = -40 to 

-42‰ VPDB, C1/C2+ ~20 to 100; Captain Arutyunov: ?13C-CH4 = -42 to -52‰ VPDB, 

C1/C2+ ~1000 (Nuzzo et al., 2005a, b). The gas hydrate composition from the Ginsburg 

MV has methane to heavier hydrocarbons ratios (C1/C2-C6) up to 19% of C2+ and an 

inferred source of the gas in the hydrates enriched in C2-C6 (? 5%) indicating a 

thermogenic origin of the gas (Mazurenko et al., 2002). Therefore, the oxidation of higher 

hydrocarbons is another potential process that can occur and explain the observed data. 

Diagenetic turnover of organic matter, which produces ?13C pore water values of 

approximately -20‰ PDB, is another process that can have an influence on the carbon 

isotopic signature of the authigenic carbonates. The total organic carbon content (Corg) of 

pelagic sediments collected at or near the sites where the authigenic carbonates where 

collected from, shows values up to 0.88% (Figure 5.11). These values are in the range of 

the normal values of Corg reported from this area and represent typical low to moderated 

organic contents of this low to medium productivity margin (Schonfeld, 2001). As such, 

the Corg content of the pelagic sediments can generate microbial methane but, at the top 

sediments of the sedimentary column, the input from in situ organic matter oxidation to the 

pore water total carbon pool is not expected to be major. 

Dissolved carbon from normal seawater and HCO3- derived from dissolution of 

carbonate tests, both with ?13C values ~0‰ (PDB) is another potential important source of 

carbon to the total carbon pool from which the carbonates were precipitated. Given that the 

strontium isotopic values indicated a seawater origin, it is to be expected that the seawater 

can also be an important source for the carbon. 

The inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from the carbonate 

mineral isotopic composition is complex, because the mineral composition may reflect 

mixing from the different carbon sources. Fractionation of the carbon will also depend on 

the extent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it is possible to 

estimate the ?13C composition of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates were 

precipitated from. As many samples have ?13C values heavier than biogenic methane, 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 182 

mixing with other carbon sources is apparently common. The average ?13C values of the 

authigenic carbonates is very close to the average values of the gas hydrates and pore water 

gas composition collected from the mud volcanoes, that indicate in general a mixture of 

biogenic and thermogenic gases. Thus, it is possible to estimate that the authigenic 

carbonates most probably reflect a similar fluid composition. As such, the isotopic 

composition of the authigenic carbonates (Figure 5.12) reflects a major mixing of 

thermogenic and biogenic methane-rich fluids with non-methane carbon sources where 

most probably, seawater is the most important. A mixing of different proportions of 

biogenic and thermogenic methane is also to be considered, since this process is also 

observed on the gas composition of different mud volcanoes. 

 

5.4.2.2 Anaerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate precipitation 

?13C values of the authigenic carbonates (Figure 5.12) are typical from carbonates 

formed at methane vents (Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et al., 1987; Ritger et al., 1987; 

Kulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., 1992; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; 

Peckmann et al., 2001a). 

The textural relationship of the authigenic pyrite that is completely surrounded by the 

carbonate cement indicates that they are syn-genetic. The authigenic pyrite requires that 

the sediments were below the zone of oxic diagenesis. This implies anaerobic oxidation of 

methane (AOM) via sulphate reduction (SR) also supported by the biomarker evidence of 

AOM and SR in dolomite chimneys and in aragonite pavements (Figure 5.16). 

During the upward migration the methane rich fluids, probably with minor amounts 

of reduced carbon-compounds, were anaerobically oxidized (AOM) in the Sulphate 

Reduction Zone (SRZ), according to the microbially mediated (Boetius et al., 2000) net 

chemical reaction (Reeburgh, 1980):

???   (5.2) 

AOM increases the alkalinity of the pore fluids and isotopic light methane carbon is 

converted to bicarbonate and partly controls whether aragonite, Mg-calcite or dolomite 

carbonates with light carbon isotopic ratio precipitates (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull et al., 

1992). Sulphide is another product of coupling AOM + SR and accumulates in 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 183

concentrations equivalent to those of sulphate consumption. The sulphide produced will be 

precipitated as pyrite, dissolved in the seawater and an important amount will be consumed 

by sulphide-based communities such as Siboglinum sp., Polybrachia and Oligograchia 

(pogonophora), Acharax sp. (solemydae) and Lucinoma (Lucinidae) that were collected at 

the most active sites where authigenic carbonates were collected (Rodrigues and Cunha, 

2005). 

During the upward fluid migration, if sulphate is available at depth, it will promote 

methane oxidation and the pore waters which migrated from the zone of methanogenesis 

towards the seafloor can already contain substantial amounts of methane-derived CO3 upon 

arrival at the top of the sediment column. The intense upward migration of methane (as gas 

or fluid) will move up the SRZ to close or, in extreme fluxes, to the seafloor. At the more 

active mud volcanoes (Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and Captain Arutyunov) the SMTZ 

lies at depths ranging between 20 and 200 cm bellow seafloor (Niemann et al., 2006; 

Hensen et al., in press). Similar SMTZ depths are characteristic of the more active sites 

from where authigenic carbonates where collected. 

 

5.4.3 Carbonate mineralogy and geochemical environments 

Petrographic estimation of pre-cementation porosities suggests that the carbonate 

precipitation occurs near or very near the top of the sediment column. Carbonate 

precipitation and dissolution is influenced by the concentration of the cations Ca2+ and 

Mg2+ (Fe2+, Mn2+), the complex-forming anions SO42- and temperature (Burton, 1993; 

Morse et al., 1997). These factors determine the development of the authigenic carbonates, 

their mineralogy and their isotopic signature. Hence, the different carbonate lithologies 

record distinct environments of formation. 

Calcium and magnesium occur in sufficient amounts in the pore waters of the 

uppermost sediments to induce precipitation. The absence of a systematic and deeper pore 

water samples, and the scarceness of long gravity cores at the more active sites, make it 

difficult to assess the role of calcium and magnesium in the formation of the authigenic 

carbonates and to constrain the depth of the more active precipitation zone. The available 

data (Hensen et al., in press) indicate a wide and variable depth of Ca-Mg depletion, that is 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 184 

strongly associated with the methane and sulphate gradients. The Ca-Mg profiles seem to 

reflect the depth of the SMTZ zone. 

The mineralogy of the authigenic carbonates is widely variable, and consists of 

dolomite, protodolomite, Mg-calcite and calcite in the dolomite crusts, nodules and 

chimneys (Figure 5.7), and aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite in the aragonite pavements. 

There is a clear distinction between the two main morphologic types of samples: the 

dolomite-dominated mineralogy of the crusts, chimneys and nodules, and the aragonite-

dominated mineralogy of the pavements. All the methane-derived authigenic carbonates 

are formed from diagenetic fluids that are, most probably, super-saturated with respect to 

all the carbonates phases that are found. Therefore the different mineralogies will be 

determined by the differences in mineral growth rate and the minor differences in the 

geochemical conditions that will favour one mineralogy in detriment of the other. 

 

5.4.3.1 Dolomite 

Magnesium that in seawater is supersaturated for dolomite precipitation forms ion-

complex MgSO40, even at very low SO42- concentrations (Baker and Kastner, 1981). 

Therefore, SO42- is an effective inhibitor for dolomite precipitation, even at concentrations 

less than 5% of its value in seawater, which is the ultimate source of SO42- for marine 

sediments. At methane seeps, where there is an efficient system of migration of sulphate-

deficient and methane-enriched deep fluids, the SMTZ will be pulled upward and, 

according to equation (5.2), the seawater sulphate will be gradually consumed. As a result, 

the amount of MgSO40 decreases and free Mg ion increases, the Mg/Ca ratio increases and 

dolomite is preferentially precipitated (Baker and Kastner, 1981). According to equation 

(5.2), AOM also contributes to a higher CO3 super-saturation, that favours the 

incorporation of greater amounts of MgCO3 (Mackenzie et al., 1983). In semi-closed 

systems, such as burrows, and along the methane-rich fluid migration conduits and 

pathways, the sulphate depletion should reach maximum values and those should be places 

of preferential dolomite precipitation. 

The existence of pyrite provides evidence for an anoxic pore water environment. The 

presence of pyrite in the non-oxidized dolomite chimneys, dolomite crusts and nodules and 

its absence in the oxidized samples is not interpreted as lack of pyrite formation during the 

cementation of the chimneys. It is interpreted instead as the result of pyrite oxidation and 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 185

degradation to iron oxy-hydroxides after exhumation of the samples from the sediment. 

The higher oxidation intensities of the samples will indicate longer periods of permanence 

at the seafloor. This is also supported by the biomarker analyses that show a better 

preservation of organic compounds in the samples with lower oxidation intensities. 

In conclusion, dolomite precipitation occurs at the sulphate-methane transition zone 

(SMTZ), preferably within semi-closed systems, such as the fluid conduits. Biomarker and 

SEM observations indicate that the microbial activity have and important role on the 

dolomite formation. 

 

5.4.3.2 Aragonite 

Aragonite formation is favoured over calcite in more aerobic environments, with 

high SO42- concentrations and high Mg/Ca ratios, like in typical seawater values (Burton, 

1993), and at low phosphate concentration and low organic matter oxidation (Burton and 

Walter, 1990). As such, on a more open system, like in environments very close to the 

seafloor, aragonite is preferentially formed. The precipitation of aragonite instead of calcite 

is favoured in seawater, as a result of the inhibiting effect of the hydrated Mg ions on the 

calcite structure. These environmental conditions should be met at or very close to the 

seafloor, when more intense and diffuse methane flux will move the SMTZ very close to 

the seafloor and the seeping methane-charged pore waters will meet bottom waters, and 

when SR coupled with AOM keep the rates of organic matter oxidation and phosphate 

production low. Therefore, the aragonite pavement samples that present a mineralogy 

dominated by aragonite, should have been formed in such a geochemical environment. 

 

5.4.3.3 Calcite and Mg-calcite  

The calcite d(104) values show a poly-modal distribution revealing the existence of 

different calcite sources: a low Mg-calcite, of biogenic origin, with d(104) values centred 

around 3.028 Å, and high Mg-calcites with d(104) values centred at 3.000 and 2.980 Å 

(Figure 5.7). 

The high Mg-calcite precipitation will be promoted in environments not so 

influenciated by the seawater such as those that promote the aragonite precipitation, and 

not in closed systems where dolomite is favoured. 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 186 

 

5.4.4 Biogeochemistry - the microbial factor 

Although the exact biochemical pathway of AOM still remains unclear, molecular, 

isotopic and phylogenetic evidence revealed that AOM is performed by a consortium of 

methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (Peckmann et al., 1999; 

Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001a; Peckmann et al., 2001b). 

Therefore, this microbial activity has an active and important role on the definition o the 

bio-geochemical conditions that will lead to the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. 

The presence of the AOM-SR consortium is revealed by the biomarkers present in the 

authigenic carbonates. These biomarkers have been identified on both aragonite pavements 

and dolomite chimneys. 

In aragonite pavements the identification of microbial and mucous biofilms is 

frequent, occurring as a coating, draped between the aragonite fibres and needles of the 

stromatolitic layers. Also, aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins are 

observed. This indicates that microbial activity has played an important role in the micro-

environmental conditions and most probably also on the formation of the authigenic 

carbonate minerals (Figure 8.23, Chapter 8). 

In the cement of the dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys, which consists of minor 

aggregates of rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite, up to 15 µm in 

diameter, SEM observations allowed the identification of a large variety of microbial-

induced fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomite crystal 

aggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments and flattening themselves against dolomite 

and calcite minerals; (3) rods with brush-like terminations; (4) dumbbell-like and 

cauliflower structures (Figure 8.8 to 8.13, Chapter 8). Precipitation of similar crystal 

aggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in laboratory experiments using 

sulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Warthmann et al., 2000; Van Lith et 

al., 2003a; Van Lith et al., 2003b). The observed microbial filaments and structures in 

these aggregates match the typical size of the described features in the authigenic 

carbonates and are clearly constructive in origin. The filaments that are covered by the 50 

nm to 1 µm size rhombohedra of Mg-calcite or dolomite and that are being incorporated by 

larger 10-15µm dolomite rhombohedra, can be interpreted as corresponding to nucleation 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 187

points from where the dolomite precipitation started and from which it progressed. So, the 

organogenic dolomite formation model, proposed for dolomite formation in shallow 

coastal lagunall and shallow marine environments (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Vasconcelos 

and McKenzie, 1997; Wright, 2000; Warthmann et al., 2005), or in organic rich and deep 

marine sediments (Meister, 2005), is also proposed on the formation of these MDAC. The 

SEM observations and the biomarker analysis show that microbes are an active key factor 

involved on the dolomite precipitation. They most probably promote the adequate 

geochemical conditions, creating optimal micro-environmental conditions, most probably 

around the microbial structures, from where the precipitation of the MDAC will be 

initiated. 

 

5.4.5 Formation of the different MDAC lithologies 

5.4.5.1 Isotopic zonation 

The carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of the dolomite chimneys show a wide bud 

regular pattern (Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14). Along radial profiles across the chimneys, 

the carbon isotopic ratios become, in general, heavy towards the periphery and whereas the 

oxygen isotopic ratios become lighter. This variation suggests temperature and/or pore 

fluid isotopic composition variations, reflecting the existence of changes in the sources of 

the fluid venting during the formation of the chimneys. Large chimneys have, in general, 

lighter carbon isotopic ratios than thinner chimneys. 

 

5.4.5.2 Formation of dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules 

Considering the underwater video observations, the morphologic, mineralogic and 

textural characteristics, it is possible to propose that the dolomite chimneys were most 

probably formed in the sediments bellow the seafloor and were gradually exposed by the 

erosion of the surrounding layers of unconsolidated sediments. In Figure 5.17 is 

represented a schematic model for the formation of the different MDAC. As they loose 

sustentation they will fall down on the seafloor. The oxidation and the iron and manganese 

coating, as well as the colonization by the benthic fauna, begin after the chimneys are 

cropped out. The dolomite chimneys with the more intense oxidation reveal a longer time 



Chapter 5. Methane-derived authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz: Characterization and 
formation model 

 188 

of exposure to the seawater and correspond to samples exhumed from shallower depths in 

the sediment column. In contrast, the dolomite chimneys without or with only weak 

oxidation signs have a shorter period of exposure to the seawater and correspond to a 

formation deeper inside the sediment column. The Mediterranean Outflow (MO) appears 

to have an effective control on the areas of occurrence of the different types of authigenic 

carbonates. Dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys occur in places where the MO has a 

strong erosive effect (Figure 5.2). 

If the dolomite chimneys and crusts had formed above the seafloor, by upward 

growth of carbonates (analogous to the sulphide chimneys on hydrothermal vents) they 

should contain a very small detrital fraction that should be limited to the fine grained 

hemipelagic sediments. Moreover, they should not contain a similar detrital composition 

and a similar fabric to those of the surrounding pelagic sediments. 

Based on the morphology, mineralogy, petrography and geochemistry, the dolomite 

crusts correspond to cemented sedimentary layers while the dolomite chimneys correspond 

to cemented fluid conduits. The dolomite chimneys are the result of expulsion of methane 

rich cold seep fluids along pathways of fluid escape formed by (hydraulic) fracturing or 

along sedimentary discontinuities such as borrows. The large variability of shapes of the 

chimneys (helicoidal, parallel and branched) suggests a complex plumbing system and 

pathways for the fluid percolation. In some situations, the fluid percolates upwards, cutting 

the sedimentary layers (dolomite chimneys with variable diameter) while in other cases the 

fluid also percolates horizontally along more permeable layers, tending to form the slab-

like crusts and branched chimneys. Some of the chimneys type can also result from 

horizontal flow along the conduits. When the fluid conduit crosses layers of different 

permeability (like layers of more sandy material), the penetration of the seeping fluid will 

increase and the chimney will develop nodules, mushroom-like or even crust like shapes. 

The low cement porosity of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodular types 

compared to the aragonite pavements suggest that the cementation took place at a deeper 

level in the sediment column, most probably at the SMTZ, where AOM coupled with the 

SR is more intense. The formation of the aragonite pavements, with higher porosity, will 

most probably occur at the seafloor or very close to the seafloor. 

It is proposed that the fluid with 13C depleted methane migrated laterally through a 

centred vent hole. Concentric precipitation of authigenic dolomite occurred by mixing of 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 189

the fluid penetrating radially outward from the vent hole with the ambient pore water (that 

the 87Sr/86Sr values indicate to be present day seawater) in the surrounding sediments of the 

SRZ. Therefore, the carbon isotopic ratios of dolomite become progressively heavier with 

increasing distance from the vent hole. The same explanation applies to the oxygen 

isotopic ratios, with the heavy oxygen being supplied by the fluid and the lither oxygen by 

the pore water fluids. Similarly, the large chimneys present the lightest carbon isotope 

ratios whereas  the thinner chimneys have heavier values. When the cold seep flux is high, 

the power of the fluid penetration is also stronger and the isotopic dilution effect by the 

pore water will be weaker, for sediments with the same permeability. Therefore, large 

chimneys may have been formed with stronger cold seep flux than the thinner chimneys.

Figure 5.17. Proposed schematic model for the formation of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates in 

the Gulf of Cadiz. 

 

The fluid/pore water penetration is dependent of the permeability of the surrounding 

sediments. Sediments with low permeability, like clay rich sediments will develop open 

vent channel chimneys and, in general, show lighter ?13C and heavier ?18O. Sediments with 

high permeability, such as silty to sandy sediments, in contrast will develop chimneys with 

closed vent channels and sometimes with concentric growth structures. The different

concentric rings can reflect different episodes of venting with different intensities and 

different fluid compositions, or mixing fronts between the methane rich fluid and the 

seawater pore water. 

 

5.4.5.3 Formation of the aragonite pavements 

The incorporation of Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp., open channels of Pogonophora 

casts and the high porosity of the aragonite pavements indicate a formation near or at the 

sediment surface. Shell crusts indicate in situ cementation of, most probably, live 

chemosynthetic communities. Seafloor observations also support this as they show that 

seep sites are characterized by rough surfaces with crusts and slabs, forming pavements 

and buildups of cemented sediment. These pavements and buildups in the Gulf of Cadiz 

are observed associated with mud volcanoes, with the exception of the occurrences 

associated with the Pen Duick and Vernadski escarpments and in places on MO channels. 

Field relationships from seafloor video observations show that they are in general 

related to methane venting at discrete portions of the mud edifice. They are found in places 

where fluid escape to the bottom water or to the top sediments, very close to the sediment-

seawater interface, occurs or has probably occurred recently. These higher fluxes can fuel 

methane and sulphide chemosynthetic communities. At these sites, under anoxic but more 

intensely seawater ventilated environmental conditions, with higher sulphate 

concentrations, authigenic precipitation is dominated by aragonite and calcite. These can 

be the environmental conditions where shell crusts, lithified mud breccias (LMb) and 

intraformational breccias are formed (Figure 5.17). 

An alternative hypothesis can be proposed to explain the vast extensions of the 

aragonite pavements of the LMb type, which does not involve active fluid venting in vast 

extensions. Both mechanisms are compatible and probably may correspond to different 

time episodes of the evolution of a seep system. After a mud volcano eruption, mud will be 

extruded producing flows that cover part or all the crater and eventually flow down the 

mud volcano flanks as a debris flows. This process produces reduced or insignificant 

mixing of bottom waters with the freshly emplaced mud breccia methane rich fluid, 

sulphate and oxygen depleted pore waters. After emplacement of the mud flow, methane 

oxidation will occur at the sediment-water interface and the oxidation front will progress 

downward according to the rates of methane flux due to the mud breccia compaction and 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 191

the downward diffusion of dissolved SO42- and O2. This diffusion of SO42- and O2 is 

controlled not only by the chemical gradients but also by bioturbation and biologic activity. 

This process can result in the cementation of the mud volcano breccia, forming crust-like 

shaped LMb that pave extensive areas of mud volcano breccia flows. 

The temporal alternation of active fluid venting and pore water methane-enriched 

mud flow emplacement can explain the breccification texture of the different aragonite 

pavement types. It can also explain the secondary precipitation episodes that characterize 

the stromatolitic layers. Gas hydrate formation/destabilization at shallow depths is also a 

process that is probably involved during high methane flux episodes and that can cause the 

breccification of the carbonate crusts. 

The zonation represented by the different stages of cementation that characterize the 

formation of the stromatolitic layers can alternatively be caused by precipitation at 

different depths below the seafloor and/or in different geochemical microenvironments. 

The extrusive activity of the mud volcanoes can result on a vertical migration of MDAC 

formed at deeper environments that were brought close to or at the seafloor by mud breccia 

expulsions. This process can explain the lithified fragments of dolomite chimneys/crusts 

(LDChy), where dolomite mineralogy formed at confined environments, most probably at 

depth, at the SMTZ, was brought to the seafloor (by mud volcano activity or by erosion of 

the unconsolidated soft sediments) and later these fragments were re-cemented at shallow 

depths close or at the seafloor by aragonite precipitation. So, the LDChy correspond to two 

distinct time episodes of formation of MDAC in distinct geochemical environments. 

The presence of small amounts of dolomite in one aragonite pavement sample can 

indicate that the sulphate depleted environmental conditions (SMTZ) that promote 

dolomite formation can be reached at a micro-environment scale conditions within the pore 

spaces, even in a near surface environment. Considering that the dolomite formation is a 

process that is mediated by microbial processes, this mediation will not biologically 

control the precipitation process, but preferentially biologically induce the alteration of the 

microenvironment surrounding the bacteria cells (Vasconcelos et al., 2005), creating the 

optimal conditions for dolomite precipitation. These could result in the precipitation of 

dolomite in restricted microenvironments in an environment that is more propitious to the 

precipitation of aragonite.

5.5 Conclusions 

 

MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz occur in two main carbonate types: dolomite crusts 

nodules and chimneys; and aragonite pavements. All dolomite crusts nodules and 

chimneys are composed of dolomite, protodolomite, high Mg-calcite and calcite, while the 

pavements are composed of aragonite high Mg-calcite and calcite. 

Thermogenic and microbial methane produced by microbial fermentation of organic 

matter forms methane gas and hydrate layers or nodules under the seafloor, where 

conditions are adequate. When pressure or temperature change, gas hydrates dissociates 

realising methane rich fluids with light carbon and heavy oxygen isotopic ratios. This 

methane reacts with sulphate at the Sulphate-Methane Transition Zone (SMTZ), through a 

process that is mediated by microbial activity, by a consortium of archaea and sulphate 

reducing bacteria, as described by Boetius et al. (2000), which is confirmed by the 

biomarker analyses. 

As result of the AOM-SR net reaction (equation 2) the alkalinity is increased with 

light carbon isotopic ratios, the sulphate is consumed and carbonate precipitation is 

induced (aragonite, calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite). Precipitation of carbonates 

occurs when bicarbonate-rich, high alkalinity pore fluids become sufficiently enriched in 

calcium and magnesium ions supplied mainly from seawater, (according to the Sr isotopic 

composition). The precipitation of the authigenic carbonate minerals induces the 

lithification of the sediments and it is the mechanism assumed for the formation of the 

pavements, crusts and chimneys. HS-, a product of this reaction will precipitate as pyrite 

or, together with methane which has not been completely consumed, will feed 

chemosynthetic communities at the seafloor, such as Bathymodiolus and Calyptogena, that 

are found cemented in the aragonite pavements (Figure 5.17). 

The different morphologies and different carbonate types reflect different flow 

patterns through the sediments. If the flux of fluid enriched in methane is channellised 

through the SRZ of the sedimentary column, using borrows or sediment heterogeneities as 

pathways, the SMTZ and the consequently precipitation of the authigenic carbonates will 

be developed around these fluid conduits. Because this fluid conduits correspond to 

confined environments in relation to seawater influence, sulphate depletion can be reached 

and dolomite will be the dominant mineralogy. The lithification of the sediments will result 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 193

in the formation of the dolomite nodules, crusts and chimneys (Figure 5.17). As can be 

observed in the NRL Seamap image (Figure 5.2) The locations where the dolomite 

chimneys occur are presently swept by the flow of the Mediterranean undercurrent which 

can remobilize the unconsolidated sediment inside of which the chimneys here probably 

formed and therefore produce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their 

present position on the seafloor. 

Aragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic carbonates in a similar 

process to that of dolomite morphologies, but in an environment closer to the seafloor 

interface. The aragonite pavements will be formed at the sediment-seawater interface or 

close to it, as a product of the AOM-SR coupling process that can result from an active and 

discrete venting or from an more diffuse and low intensity venting process. Because these 

processes are more ventilated by seawater where high alkalinity is coupled with high 

sulphate concentrations, the mineralogy is dominated by aragonite. 

The MDAC can be interpreted as a fossil record of extensive methane seepage in this 

particular area of the Gulf of Cadiz, spatially associated with probable deep fault systems, 

with mud volcanoes and diapirs, which constitute preferential pathways for fluid 

migration. They constitute a probably important natural methane sequestration process, on 

which microbial activity has played an important role on the formation of these MDAC.

6.1 Introduction 

 

Carbon isotopic composition is used in MDAC as a proxy for the source of the 

bicarbonate ion of the carbonate. If methane oxidation is the main source of the 

bicarbonate then the ?13C value of the carbonate will be depleted in relation to the normal 

marine carbonate value (Figure 6.1). 

The oxygen isotopic record in marine carbonates represents one of the most 

important proxies for past oceanographic reconstructions. Variations in the ?18O values of 

ocean seawater during glacial and interglacial periods are incorporated into the marine 

carbonates, that also record information of seawater temperature, according to the 

respective fractionation factors of the different carbonate phases (Friedman and O'Neil, 

1977). Therefore, the different mineralogical fractionation effects must be considered in 

the interpretation of the MDAC isotopic data. In order to estimate the isotopic composition 

of the original pore waters and the temperature of formation of the MDAC, the isotopic 

composition has to be corrected for the effects of the different isotopic fractionation for the 

different mineralogy. 

This study is focused on the analyses of the carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic 

composition of the MDAC samples recovered from the Gulf of Cadiz. Carbon isotopes are 

used to constrain the carbon source and the composition of the fluids from which the 

MDAC were formed from. Oxygen isotopes in aragonite, calcite and dolomite are used to 

estimate ?18O isotopic composition of the fluids from which the difent carbonate phases 

precipitated from and compared with the present day pore water isotopic composition and 

with estimated seawater ?18O isotopic composition and temperatures for glacial/interglacial

6.1.1 Fractionation factor 

Isotope fractionation is the partition of isotopes between two substances or two 

phases of the same substance with different isotope ratios. The main processes responsible 

for the isotopic fractionation are isotope exchange reactions and kinetic processes (which 

depend primarily on differences in reaction rates of isotopic molecules). Equilibrium 

isotope partitioning between minerals and fluids depends on the chemical composition and 

bond character of the mineral. This is well known for oxygen and carbon isotope 

fractionation between minerals and aqueous fluids (Kim and O'Neil, 1997). 

The fractionation of oxygen and carbon isotopes differs between the different CaCO3 

polymorphs. As an example, in aragonite, 18O is enriched by 1.0‰ and 13C by 1.7‰ 

relative to calcite (Romanek et al., 1992; Bohm et al., 2000). This is the result of the 

different vibrational behaviour of the carbonate ions, influenced by the structure of the 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 197

crystal lattice and the atomic coordination numbers. The denser aragonite lattice with its 

Ca(9)O coordination enhances the fractionation of oxygen and carbon compared to calcite 

Ca(6)O coordination. The isotope fractionation effects are mainly caused by 

thermodynamic (vibrational) behaviour of the C-O bonds in the carbonate ion (CO32-). 

The oxygen isotopic ratio of the carbonates is determined principally by the ?18O of 

the fluid from which the carbonate precipitated, by the temperature of precipitation and by 

the carbonate mineralogy (each carbonate mineral has a different fractionation factor) 

(Friedman and O'Neil, 1977). 

The fractionation factor (?) between two compounds (A and B) is defined as the ratio 

of the numbers of any two isotopes in the chemical compound A divided by the 

corresponding ratio for the other chemical compound B: 

BABA RR /=??       (6.1) 

For example, the fractionation factor for the exchange of 18O and 16O between water 

and CaCO3 is expressed by the reaction:

6.1.2 The delta value (?) 

In isotope geochemistry the isotopic composition is commonly expressed in terms of 

? values. The ? value is defined as the per mil proportion of the isotopic ratio measurement 

of a compound over the isotopic ratio of a standard sample. 

In the case of the oxygen isotopes, the ? value is defined as:

6.1.3 Oxygen isotopic standards 

Two different ? scales are generally used for the oxygen isotopes: the ?18O(SMOW) and 

the ?18O(PDB), because of the two different categories of users who have been traditionally 

engaged on O-isotope studies. 

The PDB standard is used in low temperature carbonate studies. It is referred to the 

Cretaceous Belemnite from the Pee Dee Formation in South California and was the 

laboratory working standard used at the University of Chicago in the early 1950s when the 

paleo-temperature scale was developed (McCrea, 1950; Epstein et al., 1951, 1953). The 

original supply of this standard has long been exhausted and secondary standards, whose 

isotopic composition is considered calibrated to PDB, were introduced (Table 6.1); the new 

equivalent scale is referred to as the Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB). 

The Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) scale is generally used for oxygen 

isotope analyses of non-carbonate phases such as waters, silicates, phosphates, sulphates 

and high-temperature carbonates. Similarly, the exhaustion of the original standard sample 

supply introduced the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) scale, which is 

equivalent to the SMOW. Table 6.1 shows ?18O values for commonly used oxygen isotope 

standards on both scales.

(parentheses denote calculated values) 

 

The conversion equations between ?18O(SMOW) and ?18O(PDB) and vice versa can be 

calculated by the Friedman and O'Neil (1977) equations (6.4) and (6.5):

Throughout this work, the conversion from the PDB to the SMOW scale, and vice 

versa, is done according to the Coplen et al., (1983) equations (6.6) and (6.7). 

 

6.1.4 Temperature equations 

To calculate the equilibrium formation temperatures and to estimate the isotopic 

composition of the fluids from which the carbonates precipitated from, different 

temperature equations have to be applied to the different carbonate minerals. The different 

proposed equations for the different carbonate mineralogy are presented and discussed the 

ones that best suit for the studied samples. 

A compilation of the most significant oxygen isotope fractionation equation for 

different carbonates, calibrated by laboratory experiments and by analysis of natural 

samples, are presented in Table 6.2 and discussed in the following sections.

6.1.4.1 Calcite and Mg-Calcite 
The temperature dependence of the oxygen isotopes fractionation during calcite 

precipitation was investigated since the pioneering theoretical and experimental work by 

McCrea (1950). Using two different seawaters, McCrea (1950) inorganically precipitated 

calcium carbonate by CO2 degassing at a temperature (T) range from -1.2ºC to 79.8ºC, and 

obtained two different equations (6.8 and 6.9) describing the relationship between the 

isotopic composition of the calcite with the isotopic composition of the water and the 

temperature of formation.

( ) 6.57104.16 318 ?= TO?   (for Cape Cod seawater)  (6.9) 

Epstein et al., (1951; 1953) combining experimental data from foraminifera calcite 

precipitation and analysis of natural samples collected from known seawater-temperature 

environments, defined a new oxygen isotopic temperature fractionation equation (6.10 and 

6.11). Epstein et al., (1953) also proposed the use of the oxygen isotopes for paleo-

temperature calculations and his oxygen isotope paleotemperature scale has been widely 

used in paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.

The temperature coefficient for CaCO3-water fractionation of Epstein et al., (1953) is 

in agreement with one of the equations of McCrea (1950) and with their results. They both 

conclude that, at low temperatures (0-20ºC), there is significant 18O/16O fractionation, of up 

to a few per mil, between the different alkaline earth carbonate phases. 

Several questions have been raised concerning the Epstein et al., (1953) method. 

Among the most important are: the validity of the original calibrations; the influence on the 

equilibrium fractionation factor of the different CaCO3 polymorphic phases; the chemical 

variability of biogenic shells or of the carbonate cements; the kinetic effects of both 

biological (vital effects) and chemical origin; the reliability of acid fractionation factors; 

and the recognition of the sometimes important diagenetic processes that alter the original 

isotopic composition.

 204

O'Neil et al., (1969) addressed some of these questions during their laboratory 

experiments of inorganic precipitation of alkaline-earth carbonates at high (200-500ºC) and 

low temperatures (0-25ºC) and calculated the fractionation equation (6.13):  

( ) 89.21078.2ln1000 26 ?= T?       (6.13) 
O'Neil et al., (1969) identified differences of the isotopic fractionation with variable 

divalent cationic content on the carbonate phases. This dependence was quantified for the 

first time by Tarutani et al., (1969), based on synthetic carbonate precipitation of calcite, 

aragonite and Mg-calcite from various bicarbonate solutions. The quantification of the 

effect of the MgCO3 content in calcite on the oxygen isotopic fractionation has shown that, 

at 25ºC, for each mol% of MgCO3 the 1000ln? increases by 0.06‰ in relation to pure 

calcite (Tarutani et al., 1969). Simultaneously, aragonite shows a small but significant 18O 

enrichment of 0.6‰ in relation to calcite at 25ºC (Tarutani et al., 1969). 

Friedman and O'Neil (1977) established the equation of the oxygen isotope 

fractionation as a function of temperature and the Mg mol% content in calcite:

showing different species-dependent vital effects contributions to the oxygen fractionation

From all the different temperature oxygen fractionation equations for calcite, 

throughout this work, the Kim and O'Neil (1997) equation is used as the fractionation 

equation because it is considered to best represent the fractionation equation for calcite 

mineralogy, as it was defined for inorganic calcite and has been used successfully in a 

large range of paleo-temperature calculations in calcites from a large range of settings, 

including in cold seep carbonates. As can be observed from Figure 6.2, this equation curve 

corresponds to an average position in relationship to the several diferrent equations defined 

for calcite. For Mg-calcite, the Friedman and O'Neil (1977) equation will be used, as the 

oxygen isotope fractionation as a function of temperature and the Mg mol% content in Mg-

calcite. This equation is considered to best represent the fractionation equation for Mg-

calcite mineralogy, as it has been used successfully in a large range of paleo-temperature 

calculations in Mg-calcites from a large range of settings, including in cold seep 

carbonates. 

 

6.1.4.2 Protodolomite and Dolomite 
The failure to precipitate dolomite in the laboratory at low temperatures (Land, 1998) 

has not allowed the direct determination of the temperature-dependent oxygen isotopic 

fractionation factor between low temperature dolomite and the solution from which it 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 206

precipitates. In order to constrain this limitation indirect approaches have been employed. 

One approach consists in using natural coexisting calcite and dolomite. Assuming the 

precipitation in equilibrium from the same water and at the same temperature, the 

difference between the ?18O values of both minerals (?18Odol-cal) should be constant. As the 

calcite-water fractionation factor is known and the ?18Odol-cal values can be measured, the 

dolomite-water fractionation factor can therefore be indirectly calculated. Another 

approach consists on the extrapolation of the dolomite-water oxygen isotope fractionation 

determined from the high-temperature experiments to low-temperatures. 

Isotopic studies of calcite and dolomite metamorphic assemblages predicted an 

equilibrium 18O enrichment in dolomite relative to calcite of 5-9‰ (Clayton and Epstein, 

1958; Engel et al., 1958; Sheppard and Schwarcz, 1970). 

( ) 40.01045.0ln1000 26 ?= T?  (6.19) (Sheppard and Schwarcz, 1970) 
Investigations by Clayton et al., (1968) have shown that dolomite is strongly 

enriched in 18O, from 5 to 7‰ relative to calcite, and defined the dolomite fractionation 

equation (6.20) as:

The extrapolation of the laboratory determined isotope equilibrium of high-

temperature dolomite experiments, to low-temperature (25ºC) dolomite, indicates that 

dolomite in equilibrium with calcite would be enriched in 18O by 4-7‰ (Epstein et al., 

1963; Northrop and Clayton, 1966; O'Neil and Epstein, 1966).

Lower-temperature experimental work (25-78.6ºC) by Fritz and Smith (1970) 

updated the results of Tarutani (1969) to higher contents of MgCO3, and inferred that 

protodolomite should exhibit a fractionation factor that would lead to a 18O enrichment of 

dolomite between 2‰ and 4‰ relative to calcite.

Holocene dolomites (Degens and Epstein, 1964) and low-temperature hydrothermal 

dolomites (Friedman and Hall, 1963) have very similar fractionation factors for dolomite 

and for coexisting calcites. 

A study of modern calcite and dolomite formation in a sabkha environment with a 

temperature of ~35ºC, gave an equilibrium fractionation factor of 3.2‰ (McKenzie, 1981). 

The extrapolation to the low-temperature dolomite-water oxygen isotope 

fractionation from the high-temperature experiments (Northrop and Clayton, 1966) has 

lead to the empirical equation (6.26). 

( ) 0.21020.3ln1000 26 ?= T?        (6.26) 
Matthews and Katz (1977) experimental oxygen isotope fractionation (6.27), 

measured during hydrothermal dolomitization of CaCO3 at a temperature range from 

252ºC to 295ºC, indicated however a lower dolomite-water fractionation than the Northrop 

and Clayton (1966) calibration. 

( ) 24.31006.3ln1000 26 ?= T?        (6.27) 
In summary, the results of the various isotopic studies of calcite-dolomite pairs have 

indicated a wide range of the interpreted ?18Odol-cal values, ranging from ~0‰ to 9‰. The 

inconsistencies in these results, make it difficult to satisfactory characterize the 

environmental conditions of dolomite precipitation from its oxygen isotopic composition. 

The inconsistencies in the ?18Odol-cal values have been discussed and referred to by Land 

(1998) as the “? problem.” 

More recently, geomicrobiological research has introduced the microbial factor 

(Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997) to the complex and large number of interacting factors, 

such as thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, hydrology, host-rock mineralogy and texture 

(Hardie, 1987), that intervene in the process of dolomite formation. With the discovery of 

bacterial-mediated processes that induced the precipitation of dolomite at low temperatures 

(Vasconcelos, 1994; Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997; 

Warthmann et al., 2000), it become finally possible to calibrate the dolomite-water oxygen

 208

isotope fractionation factor (Vasconcelos et al., 2005). Experiments under anaerobic 

conditions with pure microbial stain of sulphate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio stain LV 

form1) allowed the precipitation of dolomite in a synthetic growth medium solution at 25, 

30, 40 and 45ºC. These experiments allowed the calculation of the oxygen isotope 

fractionation equation (6.28), as a function of temperature (Vasconcelos et al., 2005): 

( ) 26.01073.2ln1000 26 += T?       (6.28) 
During the microbial-mediated process of dolomite precipitation at low temperature 

it is assumed that dolomite precipitates in equilibrium with the solution and that the 

bacteria have a passive involvement in this process, with no vital effect on the precipitation 

it self and not affecting the isotopic composition. This assumption is corroborated by 

observations that indicate that the precipitation is not biologically controlled, but simply 

biologically induced by the alteration of the microenvironment surrounding the bacteria 

cells (Vasconcelos et al., 2005).

6.1.4.3 Aragonite 
In contrast to the investigations of inorganic precipitation of calcite and other types 

of carbonate phases, the oxygen isotopic fractionation during the formation of aragonite is 

frequently deduced from biogenic-produced material from corals, sponges, molluscs and 

foraminifers. Aragonite presents a heavier oxygen isotopic fractionation when compared to 

calcite (Kim and O'Neil, 1997). 

The relation between the ?18O of aragonite (?18Oc in ‰ PDB), the ?18Ow of the 

ambient water (?18Ow in ‰ SMOW) and the temperature of precipitation (t in ºC) has been 

calculated by Grossman and Ku (1986), through the equation:

This equation was defined based on isotopic analyses on live and modern species of 

aragonitic foraminifera, gastropods and acaphopods at the 2.6–22.0°C ambient temperature 

range. Grossman and Ku (1986) observed that the aragonitic foraminifera Hoeglundina 

elegans was, on average, 0.2 ± 0.2‰ depleted in 18O relative to the aragonitic molluscs. 

Comparing the aragonitic foraminifera species with the calcitic foraminifera Uvigerina, 

Hoeglundina was 0.6 ± 0.3‰ enriched. This enrichment in 18O of aragonite relative to 

calcite is similar to that observed in previous experimental and theoretical studies. 

Hudson and Anderson (1989) modified the Grossman and Ku equation into the ?18O 

notation of the water in the SMOW scale, according to the Friedman and O'Neil (1977) 

equations (6.4) and (6.5). As such, the Hudson and Anderson (1989), with temperature in

From all the different temperature oxygen fractionation equations, in this work, the 

Bohm et al., (2000) is used as the fractionation equation that best represents the

 211

fractionation equation for the aragonite mineralogy. 

 

6.1.4.4 Comparison of the Aragonite with the Calcite fractionation 
equations 

Comparing the calcite with the aragonite oxygen fractionation equations (Figure 6.5) 

it is clear that during aragonite precipitation the oxygen is more intensely fractionated to 

heavier values. The fractionation differences between the two phases (?18Oarag-calc) exhibit 

a significant variability, function of the fractionation equation considered. The Kim and 

O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite and the Grossman and Ku (1986) 

equation (6.28) for aragonite present the large difference in the ?18Oarag-calc of 1.60‰. 

However comparing the Patterson et al., (1993) estimation for aragonite (6.32) with the 

Friedman and O'Neil (1977) equation (6.14), the fractionation difference ?18Oarag-calc has 

the minimum value of 0.2‰. 

The difference between the Bohm et al. (2000) fractionation equation for aragonite to 

the Kim and O'Neil (1997) fractionation equation for calcite shows a ?18Oarag-calc of 1.40‰ 

and is considered the most probable fractionation difference that would be expected on the 

methane-derived authigenic calcite and aragonite, considering their formation in isotopic 

equilibrium. 

Also to be noted is that the presence of Mg in the calcite lattice will move the oxygen 

fractionation equations towards a heavier isotopic values, as shown by the Friedman and 

O'Neil (1977) equations (grey lines in Figure 6.5). For 8 mol% of Mg in calcite, the 

?18Oarag-MgCalc is variable with the temperature, increasing from 0.20‰ at near 0ºC and 

reaching 0.60‰ at 25ºC. Therefore, the presence of Mg in the calcite lattice or the higher 

abundance of Mg-calcite in the carbonate mixture should result in smaller differences 

between the fractionation equations of aragonite and calcite and more similar isotopic 

values for aragonite and calcite.

Figure 6.7. Differences in the oxygen isotopic fractionation (?18Oarag-calc) of calcite (red lines) and aragonite 
(blue lines) in equilibrium with water with ?18O = 2‰ SMOW, as a function of temperature. The difference 
between aragonite and calcite according to the Bohm et al., (2000) and the Kim and O’Neil (1997) equations 
is 1.40‰. The maximum difference in the oxygen isotopic fractionation is 1.60‰ considering the Grossman 
and Ku (1986) equation for aragonite. 

 

In conclusion, for coexisting calcite and aragonite, if both have precipitated in 

isotopic equilibrium, from the same solution (independently of its isotopic composition) 

and at the same temperature, aragonite is expected to be up to 1.60‰ more enriched in 18O 

than calcite. For higher Mg contents in calcite or if calcite is coexisting with Mg-calcite, 

then the oxygen isotopic difference between the calcite + Mg-calcite mixture and aragonite 

should be smaller. 

 

6.1.4.5 Comparison of the Dolomite with the Calcite fractionation 
equations 

Comparing the Vasconcelos et al., (2005) low-temperature experimental 

determination of the oxygen isotope fractionation of dolomite (6.28) with the Kim and 

O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite-water fractionation on inorganic 

precipitation at low temperature, the difference between the isotopic fractionation factors 

(?18Odol-cal) is temperature dependent: at 4ºC this difference is 3.10‰ and at 14ºC the 

difference is 2.98‰, more positive for dolomite (Figure 6.8). For the present objective, the 

slopes of equations (6.28), (6.14) and (6.16) can be considered identical and the (?18Odol-

cal) value can be considered constant with temperature. In conclusion, for coexisting calcite 

and dolomite, if both have precipitated in isotopic equilibrium from the same solution at

the same temperature, dolomite is expected to be 3‰ more enriched in 18O than calcite.

6.2 Present day oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 

In the Gulf of Cadiz, ?18O for the Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) ocean water 

show values in the range of +0.60 to +0.70‰ SMOW and present day ?18O values for 

NACW are in the range of +0.66 to +0.84‰ SMOW (A. Voelker personal 

communication). ?18O values of bottom water at the sites where MDAC were collected, 

vary from +0.5 to +1.5‰ SMOW (Mazurenko et al., 2002). The bottom water temperature, 

depending if the sites where MDAC occur are under influence of the NACW or MW range 

from 6ºC to 12ºC respectively (CANIGO data base). 

Based on seawater temperature reconstructions from benthic foraminifer from 

gravity cores in the Gulf of Cadiz it is possible to estimate a minimum sea-bottom water 

temperature of 4ºC for extreme conditions in glacial stages, and a maximum sea-bottom 

water temperature of 14ºC for extreme conditions in interglacial stages (Voelker et al., 

2006). These temperature intervals will be used for the interpretation of the oxygen

isotopic composition s of the MDAC. The interval of 8 to 12ºC, that corresponds to the 

temperatures measured at the sites where the samples were collected, is considered the 

most probable temperature range of formation of the MDAC. The interval between 4ºC 

and 14ºC is considered as representing extreme lower and higher temperatures that could 

had be reached during extreme conditions such as the glacial periods (for the lower 

temperature) and the temperature of 14ºC could be reached in times of enhanced MO 

influence.

characterized by temperatures ranging from 6 to 12ºC. The MO is characterized by temperatures ranging 
from 10 to 14ºC. (b) Map showing the location of sites where MDAC were collected and temperature values 
of the deepest CTD measurement from the CANIGO data set. To be noted the scarceness of measurements in 
the Moroccan margin. The temperature values on this margin were extrapolated from the temperature values 
from the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz which most probably corresponds to an underestimation of the 
temperature values for the Morocco margin. 

 

 

6.3 Methods

The morphology and sizes of the authigenic carbonates were described on 

underwater video observations and on the retrieved samples. The petrography of the 

carbonates was examined in polished slabs and thin sections by standard petrographic and 

cathodoluminescence techniques. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were 

carried out, coupled with energy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS), 

in fresh fractured surfaces and in samples etched with HCl 10% during 3-4 minutes before 

the SEM observations. 

Samples for XRD, Sr, total organic carbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen 

stable isotope were extracted from transversal and longitudinal cuts and micro-drilled 

along radial and longitudinal profiles. 

Bulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of the different carbonate mineralogies 

in each sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples 

(Table 5.1). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer 

with CuK? radiation (1.5405 Å wavelength). Scans were done from 5º to 60º 2? at 

0.02º/sec, using a 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the 

diffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates 

of the relative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their 

relative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were 

performed using the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff® software packages. 

The peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals aragonite 

(3.40 Å), calcite (&amp;lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 Å), high Mg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% 

MgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 Å), protodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 

to 2.916 Å) and dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 Å). The Mg:Ca ratio of 

the carbonate minerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection 

peak of calcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction 

spectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). 

Samples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at 

90°C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-

PRISM mass spectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results are

reported in the conventional ? ‰-notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee 

Belemnite). Analytical reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards is better 

than ±0.1‰ for both carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite 

samples, dolomite ?18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63‰, 

consequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum 

and Sheppard, 1986). For the reconstruction of paleo-pore water temperatures and oxygen 

isotopic composition, the Kim and O'Neil (1997) equation was used for calcite, the 

Vasconcelos et al., (2005) equation was used for dolomite and the Bohm et al., (2000) 

equation was used for aragonite, as described in previous sections. 

In order to determine the different isotopic composition of the different carbonate 

phases on selected MDAC samples, the organic acid ethylenedinitrilotetraceticacid 

(EDTA) was used. A detailed description of the leaching technique is described in 

Appendix C. Samples for EDTA were retrieved from the powdered samples collected with 

a micro-drill, each sample was spitted in two fractions. One sub-sample was used for XRD 

analysis and for carbon and oxygen isotopic analysis of the bulk carbonate. The second 

sub-sample was leached with 20 ml boiling 0.25 M EDTA solution at pH 11 during 24 

hours in glass covered containers to avoid evaporation. The solvent level was maintained at 

20 ml/g by adding distilled water. After 24 hours the sub-sample was taken out of the 

EDTA solution, washed in distilled water, freeze dried, examined with XRD and measured 

for carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. 

Samples for 87Sr/86Sr were dissolved in 20 ml, 1.0 N ultra pure acid acetic, 

centrifuged, and then decanted and evaporated dry. Then, they were re-dissolved in 20 ml 

of 5-N HNO3 and loaded into columns containing the AG8 50W BioRad Sr-specific resin. 

The 87Sr/86Sr composition of the carbonates (Arag, Calc, Mg-Calc and Dol) was 

determined using a VG-Sector 54 Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer. The analytical 

reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards, is better than ±0.000060‰.

6.4 Results 

 

6.4.1 Oxygen and carbon isotopes 

6.4.1.1 EDTA 
The EDTA leaching technique was used to differentiate between coexisting calcite, 

high Mg-calcite and dolomite in a controlled and simple technique. Using a 0.25 M EDTA 

solution, a mixture of 74:26 dolomite:calcite+high Mg-calcite was altered to a 100:00 

(wt%:wt%) mixture in 24 hours, as described in Appendix C. The selective separation of 

the coexisting carbonate minerals allowed the identification of different carbon and oxygen 

isotopic values for the different mineral phases. 

On average, pure dolomite shows an constant depletion in ?13C of -5.49‰ ± 2.08‰ 

(PDB) in relation to the bulk carbonate (Figure 6.10 and Figure C.9). Pure dolomite phase 

(obtained by EDTA leaching of 6 samples) shows an average ?18O isotopic composition of 

+5.69‰ ± 0.29 (PDB) (Figure 6.10 and Table C.2). Extrapolated ?18O isotopic 

composition of pure dolomite from EDTA leaching of 6 samples (Figure 6.10 and Figure 

C.9) indicate an average value of +5.66‰ (PDB). 

The calculation of the ?18O isotopic composition of pure calcite or, of the mixture of 

calcite + high Mg-calcite (Table C.2., Appendix C), indicates a calculated value of 

+0.93‰ ± 0.67 (PDB). The extrapolation from the linear best fit of the plot of the ?18O 

isotopic composition as a function of the dolomite content Figure 6.10 indicates an 

estimated composition for pure calcite phase, or to the mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite 

of 1.4‰ (PDB). The calculated (Table C.2., Appendix C) ?13C for a pure calcite + high 

Mg-calcite mixture indicates a value of -9.83‰ ± 6.17 (PDB). As such, all the estimations 

point to ~1.4‰ (PDB) near seawater composition of the calcite phase and a positive 

~5.7‰ (PDB) ?18O isotopic composition of the dolomite. 

The difference between the oxygen isotopic fractionation factors of the two end-

members pure dolomite and pure calcite (?18Odol-cal) is 4.2‰ (PDB) or 4.7‰ (PDB), 

considering the different extrapolations. These values are significantly higher than the 

expected theoretical maximum limit value of 3.1‰ (PDB) for the temperature of 4ºC

of samples treated with EDTA leaching. Pure dolomite yields 5.6‰ ?18O PDB, whereas 18O is strongly 
depleted in the calcite and Mg-calcite phases. There is no clear relationship between the mineralogy and the 
?13C values. 

 

6.4.1.2 Calcite and Mg-calcite vs Dolomite in bulk samples of the 
dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules  

The samples of dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodular type are composed of calcite, 

high Mg-calcite, protodolomite and dolomite with different mineral proportions and with 

high variability of the C and O isotopic compositions. These values are reported in Table 

5.1 and Figure 5.9. The high variability on the 18O values of bulk samples is the 

consequence of the different mineralogical composition (calcite/dolomite ratio), possible 

different temperature of formation and different pore fluids composition. 

The bulk ?18O isotopic composition as function of the dolomite to carbonate ratio 

(Figure 6.11) shows a high variability with values ranging from 0.8 up to 6.8‰ (PDB). 

Samples with more than 95% of dolomite also show a high variability with ?18O values 

ranging from 3 to 6.8‰ (PDB). The linear best fit equation for all the samples has a poor 

coefficient of determination but, shows an median ?18O isotopic value of 4.8‰ ±2.2‰ 

(PDB), value close to the 5.66‰ (PDB) value for the pure dolomite phase estimated from

calcite (calcite + high Mg-calcite &gt;80%) shows values ranging from 2.8 to 5.5‰ PDB 

Figure 6.11. These values are higher than the estimated composition of the pure calcite 

phase (1.44‰ PDB) estimated from the EDTA leaching technique. The linear best fit 

equation for all the samples, that has a poor coefficient of determination, shows a median 

?18O isotopic value of 2.6‰ (PDB) for the pure calcite phase. This value is higher that the 

1.44‰ (PDB) estimated from the EDTA leaching technique. 

The plot of the bulk ?13C isotopic composition of the dolomite chimneys crusts and 

nodules as function of their dolomite to carbonate ratio (Figure 6.12) indicates an evident 

trend with a ?13C value of -37‰ ±10‰ (PDB) for pure dolomite end-member and -18‰ 

±10‰ (PDB) for calcite+Mg-calcite end-member. The extrapolations of the ?13C values 

for pure dolomite, based on the ?13C values of bulk and leached material (Figure C.12) 

indicate ?13C compositions ranging from -52‰ to -28‰ (PDB) for the pure dolomite 

phase, with an average value of -39‰ ±10‰ (PDB). The calcite and Mg-calcite phases 13C 

are heavier with the extrapolated values ranging from -2 to -23‰ (PDB) with an average 

value of -9.83‰ ±6.17‰ (PDB). 

In conclusion, both EDTA and bulk samples clearly indicate for the calcite a closer 

to normal seawater isotopic composition, also seen on the oxygen isotopes; and a lighter 

carbon isotopic and heavier oxygen isotopic composition for dolomite. 

 

6.4.1.3 Calcite and Mg-calcite vs Aragonite in aragonite pavements 
Calcite, Mg-calcite and aragonite occur in samples of aragonite pavements, with 

different mineral proportions and with different C and O isotopic compositions. These 

values are reported in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.9. The high variability on the 18O values of 

bulk samples of aragonite pavements is the consequence of the different mineralogical 

composition (calcite/aragonite ratios) and possible also different temperature of formation 

and different pore fluid composition. 

The aragonite pavement samples reveal a linear correlation between the mineral 

content i.e., the ratio aragonite/(calcite+Mg-calcite), and the ?18O composition (Figure 

6.13). This correlation indicates a ?18O calculated isotopic composition of 2.3‰ (PDB) for 

the end-member pure calcite phase. The ?18O calculated isotopic composition of the end-

member pure aragonite is 4.2‰ (PDB). This corresponds to a difference between the 

isotopic fractionation factors (?18Oarag-cal) of 1.9‰ (PDB). This value is higher than the 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 222

expected theoretical maximum limit value of 1.6‰ (PDB) (Section 6.1.4.4, Figure 6.5). 

There is no evident different correlation between the mineral content and the ?18O 

composition as function of the sample location but, samples from Hesperides and Ginsburg 

MVs are located slightly above the average trend line, while samples from Jesus Baraza, 

and Faro MVs are located above that line. It is not evident any clear correlation between 

the different aragonite types (lithified mud volcano breccias, intraformational breccias, 

shell crusts and stromatolitic fabric) and their ?13C and ?18O composition. It should 

however be noted that the intraformational breccias present the higher ?13C and ?18O 

values. 

In relation to the carbon isotopic composition (Figure 6.14), there is no clear 

evidence of an isotopic trend with the mineralogical composition. Nevertheless it is of 

significance that shell samples collected within the aragonite pavements present heavier 

?13C values than the shells collected from dolomite chimney samples. The aragonite 

pavement cements present a wide range of ?13C values from -14.2 to -56.2‰ (PDB).

6.4.2 Strontium isotopes 

The strontium isotopic composition of carbonate minerals reflects the strontium 

isotopic composition of the fluid in which they formed (Hess et al., 1986). As the variation 

of the strontium isotopic composition of seawater through time is well defined (Elderfield, 

1986; Farrell et al., 1995), the strontium isotopes can be used to constrain the source of the 

fluids of authigenic carbonates.  
87Sr/86Sr ratios on the different types of carbonate samples (dolomite crusts and 

chimneys and aragonite pavements) show values between 0.709110 and 0.709191 (Table 

6.3). The aragonite pavement carbonate 87Sr/86Sr ratio clearly reflects the isotopic ratio of 

contemporaneous seawater of 0.709175 (Paytan et al., 1993) indicating that the authigenic 

carbonates of the aragonite pavements were formed from fluids with Sr values similar to 

present day seawater. Dolomite chimney samples shows 87Sr/86Sr values close to the 

contemporaneous seawater composition, but in spite of its large error value limits, the 

dolomite chimney sample (3463-A08) presents a 87Sr/86Sr value (0.709110) that is lighter 

that the present day seawater composition (Figure 6.15 and Figure 6.16). However, the 

dolomite crust sample 3458-A03 has 87Sr/86Sr values close to the contemporaneous 

Aragonite Pavement samples

seawater composition. The difference on the strontium isotopic value of the dolomite 

chimney sample is interpreted as reflecting a contribution of older seawater composition 

(indicated by the age of 245 ka ± 9.3% obtained by U/Th, as discussed in chapter 7) or 

possibly a contribution from deeper strontium rich fluids (with compositions closer to the 

Bonjardim and Ginsburg MVs estimated end member pore fluids, Figure 6.15). The 

dolomite crust and the aragonite pavement, they both reflect a contemporaneous seawater 

composition. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg MVs 

clearly deviates from the present day seawater values (Figure 6.15). Thus the  87Sr/86Sr 

ratios of the analysed authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear and major addition of Sr 

from deep seated fluids, the MDAC preferably reflect contemporaneous seawater Sr 

composition. The dolomite chimney sample has a signal that supports a deeper seated 

fluids and/or an older seawater contribution that nevertheless corresponds to a minor 

contribution while the main Sr source is seawater.

6.5 Discussion 

 

6.5.1 Methane rich pore waters 

As discussed in chapter 5, the carbon isotopic composition of the authigenic 

carbonates (?13C = -56.16‰ to -8.42‰ PDB, Figure 5.9 and Table 5.1) reflect the carbon 

source indicating that they were originated from pore fluids enriched in methane. Most 

probably, from a mixture of moderate to extremely 13C-depleted methane enriched 

fluids,given that ?13C values of gas hydrates and pore water are in the range -80 to -20‰ 

PDB (Stadnitskaia et al., 2006; Niemann et al., Submitted; Nuzzo et al., Submitted), with 

normal seawater and HCO3- derived from dissolution of carbonate tests (characterized by 

?13C values ~0‰ PDB). Two potential sources of methane can be considered for the Gulf 

of Cadiz authigenic carbonates: thermogenic and biogenic.  

As the mineral composition of the authigenic carbonates may reflect mixing from the 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 226

different carbon sources, the inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from 

the carbonate mineral isotopic composition is complex. Fractionation of the carbon will 

also depend on the extent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it 

is possible to estimate the ?13C composition of the fluids from which the authigenic 

carbonates were precipitated from. Since many samples have ?13C values heavier than 

biogenic methane, mixing with other carbon sources is necessary and apparently common. 

The gas hydrates and pore water gas compositions collected from mud volcanoes (MVs) in 

the Gulf of Cadiz indicate, in general, a mixture of biogenic and thermogenic gases, with 

secondary migration, mixing and microbial alteration of hydrocarbons (Stadnitskaia et al., 

2006). Thus, it is possible to recognize that the authigenic carbonates most probably reflect 

a similar fluid composition. As such, the isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates 

reflects a major mixing of thermogenic and biogenic methane-rich fluids with non-methane 

carbon sources where, most probably, seawater is the most important. 

 

 

6.5.2 Paleo-temperatures and fluid composition on dolomite crusts, 

chimneys and nodules 

To investigate whether the analysed ?18O isotopic values of the dolomite crusts, 

chimneys and nodules reflect equilibrium crystallization with the present day seawater 

temperatures and oxygen isotopic composition, the Vasconcelos et al., (2005) low-

temperature experimental determination of the oxygen isotope fractionation of dolomite 

(equation 6.28) and the Kim and O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite-water 

fractionation on inorganic precipitation at low temperature were used. 

Pure calcite end-member phase have an estimated average oxygen isotopic 

composition of 1.4‰ PDB and a wide range of values estimated based on the EDTA and 

calculated based on the calcite-dolomite trend line (Figure 6.10 and Figure 6.11). 

Therefore, a minimum value of -1.6‰ (PDB) and a maximum value of 5.0‰ PDB can be 

defined. Pure dolomite end-member phase has an average oxygen isotopic composition of 

5.7‰ PDB and a wide range of values with a minimum and maximum value estimated to 

be 2.7 and 7.4‰ PDB, respectively (Figure 6.11 and Table 6.4), based on the EDTA 

calculated calcite-dolomite trend line.

6.5.2.1 Calcite and high Mg-calcite 
Figure 6.17 illustrates the Kim and O'Neil (1997) relation between temperature and 

the ?18O of calcite, for seawater ?18O isotopic compositions ranging from -1.5 to +2.8‰ 

SMOW. Figure 6.18 illustrates the different temperature 18O-fractionation equations 

defined for calcite and/or Mg-calcite and the extrapolated range of ?18O values of the 

calcite end-member phase of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules, assuming oxygen 

isotope compositions of the pore water changing from -2 to +3‰ SMOW. In both figures 

is also shown (by the blue rectangles) the present day temperature intervals that occur in 

the places where the MDAC were collected (dark blue, 8 to 12ºC) and the temperature 

range (4 to 14ºC) considered to represent extreme temperature limits that could occur in 

particular conditions as the glacial or intense periods of the MO. 

From Figure 6.17 and Figure 6.18 it is evident that the extrapolated average oxygen 

isotopic values of calcite (1.4‰ PDB) can be explained by precipitation from normal 

seawater composition (0-1‰ SMOW) at the present day temperature range (8-12ºC) that 

characterizes the different places where the MDAC were collected from. The average ?18O 

value (1.4‰ PDB) of the end-member calcite (that, as seen, represents the pelagic fraction 

carbonate) is identical to the measured values of clam shells and coral branches (2.8‰ 

PDB, Chapter 5, Table 5.1) that were collected from the external surface of dolomite 

chimneys which, as also indicated by their average ?13C value (0.36‰ PDB) were formed, 

most probably, in equilibrium with ambient bottom water. Therefore, the average isotopic 

composition of the calcite phase on the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules is 

interpreted as reflecting the dominance of the pelagic carbonate source on the total 

carbonate content of the samples. This pelagic calcite is characterized by isotopic 

compositions of 1-2‰ PDB and reflects precipitation from normal seawater at present day 

temperature conditions. 

Samples with oxygen isotopic compositions that show a clear deviation from these 

average values correspond to samples where the pelagic calcite fraction is not dominant 

and the authigenic calcite that composes the cement is significantly controlling the isotopic 

composition of the total calcite phase. The extrapolated minimum and maximum limit 

values of oxygen isotopes of calcite and/or high Mg-calcite cannot be explained by 

precipitation from normal seawater composition (0-1‰ SMOW) at the present day 

temperature range, not even considering the minimum expected temperature during glacial 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 229

stages (4ºC) or the maximum expected temperature of 14ºC. 

The minimum limit of -1.6‰ PDB of some calcites can be explained by precipitation 

from depleted pore waters, with ?18O of ?-1.5‰ SMOW (Table 6.5). Precipitation from 

normal seawater would require higher temperatures (&gt;21ºC). Such high temperatures are 

not expected to occur in the superficial sediments, since the thermal gradient 

measurements on some of the mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz indicate very low heat 

flow (Kopf et al., 2004). Therefore, the minimum ?18O value of hypothetically pure calcite 

phase (-1.6‰ PDB) is interpreted as representing precipitation from a 18O-depleted source 

water (?-1.5‰ SMOW). The most probable explanation for this depleted 18O pore waters 

is an important contribution from residual waters formed during the formation of methane 

hydrates. During the formation of gas hydrates, the 18O-rich water molecules are 

incorporated preferentially in the clathrate lattice leaving the remaining pore waters with 

increased ionic concentrations and with excess of 18O-depleted water molecules (Ussler 

and Paull, 1995; Ussler and Paull, 2001). 

Given that temperatures less than 4ºC are very improbable to occur, even considering 

glacial periods and with changes in the MO pathways and their absence at the sampling 

locations, the maximum limit value of 4.8‰ PDB on some samples can only be explained 

by precipitation from heavier pore waters. Alternatively, the maximum limit values of 

4.8‰ PDB of some samples could be explained by precipitation from normal pore waters 

(?18Ow up to 1‰ SMOW), if the mineralogy were composed with large dominance of high 

Mg-calcite with high amounts of mol% of Mg. However, this is not the case for all the 

samples. Some samples (c.a. 3426-A01.63) are composed of calcite (87% wt%) with 7.7% 

mol% Mg and dolomite (with 43% mol% Mg). Therefore, the maximum limit values 

(4.8‰ PDB) of some samples are preferably interpreted as resulting of the precipitation 

from 18O-enriched pore waters, with ?18Ow of at least 2.8‰ SMOW (Table 6.5) under 

seawater temperatures of 4ºC. If the precipitation would occur under c.a. 8ºC, then to 

explain the calcite isotopic composition it would be required that the fluids would have a 

composition of 3.8‰ SMOW (Table 6.5). 

The variation of the oxygen isotopic composition in the North Atlantic associated 

with the last deglaciation is 0.8 ±0.1‰ (Waelbroeck et al., 2002), the glacial to interglacial 

change in ?18O of the deep Atlantic ranges between 0.7 and 0.8‰ (Schrag et al., 2002), 

and the change in global mean ocean ?18O between glacial and interglatial periods is 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 230

1.1±0.1‰ SMOW (Schrag et al., 1996). In addition, the ?18O glacial-interglacial variations 

of the of bottom waters and of pore waters do not explain the calculated negative ?18Ow 
values (?-1.5‰ SMOW). Therefore, the at least 2.8‰ 18O-enriched pore waters cannot be 

explained as having an origin from fossil glacial pore waters. The heavier pore water 

composition (?18Ow ? 2.8‰ SMOW) can be produced by fluids which contain deeply 

sourced clay-dehidratation water, brine fluids or gas hydrate water resulting from the 

dissociation of gas hydrates. The hypothesis of the pore waters from which the authigenic 

carbonates had precipitated from have a significant contribution from hypersaline or brine 

fluid is considered to be less probable because no mineralogical indicators was detected as 

it would be expected and because the strontium isotopic records indicate instead an 

dominant seawater dominance of the source fluids. The brine fluids contribution also do 

not explain the calculated negative ?18O values that are required for some of the samples. 

In some of the places where the MDAC were collected, in some of them the MDAC 

formation process is presently active or very recent, and in the various mud volcanoes in 

the Gulf of Cadiz, never brine fluids were indicated in the pore water composition. The 

hypothesis of the source of the heavier oxygen isotopic composition as a result from deeply 

sourced clay-dehidratation water is possible, but is not supported by the strontium isotopic 

composition of the carbonates. The negative ?18O values of the pore fluids that are 

estimated for some of the samples are also difficult to be explained by pore fluids with a 

clay-dehidratation source. 

In conclusion, given that some dolomite crust and chimney samples also indicate 

precipitation from ?18O-depleted water, the source of the heavier pore water composition is 

interpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates. The estimated values of 

the ?18O-enrichment of the pore water from which some dolomite and calcites had 

precipitated from (?18Ow ? 2.8‰ SMOW) corresponds to typical reported isotopic values 

of pore waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates (Hesse and Harrison, 

1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983).

6.5.2.2 Protodolomite and dolomite 
The Vasconcelos et al., (2005) fractionation equation that relates the dolomite ?18O 

isotopic composition with the temperature of formation is illustrated in Figure 6.20 for 

?18Ow of the pore fluids from which it precipitates ranging from -2 to +3‰ SMOW. Also 

shown is the present day seabottom water temperature range and the average isotopic 

composition and the estimated range of values of the pure dolomite end-member in 

samples of dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules. Similarly, Figure 6.19 shows the 

different 18O-fractionation equations defined for dolomite for the same temperature and 

pore water oxygen isotopic compositions as in Figure 6.20 ranging from -2 to +3‰ 

SMOW.

Figure 6.20. Plot showing the relation between oxygen isotope composition estimated for dolomite and 
temperature of precipitation, for oxygen isotope composition of seawater of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3‰ vs. 
SMOW. The relation is based on the equation given by Vasconcelos et al., (2005). 

 

From these plots it is possible to conclude that the average oxygen isotopic value of 

dolomite (?18O of 5.7‰ PDB) can be explained by precipitation in isotopic equilibrium at 

the lower limit of present day seawater temperature (8ºC) from a pore water with an 

normal or close to normal isotopic composition (1.3‰ SMOW), that is in the range of the 

isotopic composition of pore waters collected from some of the mud volcanoes (0.5 to 

1.5‰ SMOW) from the Gulf of Cadiz (Mazurenko et al., 2002). If the precipitation of the 

dolomite is considered to occur during glacial periods, with lower seabottom water 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 234

temperatures (down to 4ºC) then the isotopic composition of the pore fluids can reach 

normal seawater composition of (0.3‰) close to 0‰ SMOW (Table 6.5). 

The minimum values of dolomite isotopic composition (lower value of 2.7‰ PDB) 

cannot be explained by precipitation in isotopic equilibrium with normal seawater oxygen 

isotopic composition, even considering a wider temperature range up to 14ºC. To 

precipitate dolomite with 2.7‰ PDB from normal seawater (as low as 0‰ SMOW) would 

require a temperature of more than 16ºC, a value that is unlikely to occur at these water 

depths. These extreme low values of dolomite are thus interpreted as precipitation from 

slightly 18O-depleted pore water -2.7 to -0.2‰ SMOW considering respectively 

temperatures of 4ºC or 14ºC. The more probable explanation for this depleted 18O pore 

waters, as similar to the minimum limit of the calcite isotopic composition, is the result of 

dolomite precipitation from residual waters formed during the crystallization of gas 

hydrates. 

 
Table 6.5. Dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules estimated isotopic composition of seawater or pore fluid 
from which the end-members calcite and dolomite had precipitated considering several temperature values.

Note: Seawater pore fluids composition in blue are interpreted as residual waters formed during the crystallization of methane hydrates; 

Seawater pore fluids composition in green are interpreted as normal seawater compositions; Seawater pore fluids composition in 
red are interpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates. 

 

An extrapolated pure phase dolomite end-member maximum limit value of 7.4‰ 

PDB, (very close to the measured bulk values of several samples) can not be explained by 

precipitation under present day temperature conditions from a pore water fluids with 

normal or close to normal oxygen isotopic composition. Considering that seawater 

temperatures inferior of 4ºC are not probable to occur in this area, such high ?18O dolomite 

values can only be explained by precipitation from 18O-enriched fluids, ranging from 2 to 

4‰ SMOW (Table 6.5), under temperatures ranging from 4 to 14ºC (respectively). As 

interpreted for the heavier calcite values, such 18O-enriched pore water fluids are 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 235

interpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates, as it corresponds to typical 

reported isotopic values of pore waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates 

(Hesse and Harrison, 1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983). 

 

6.5.2.3 Dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules carbonates  
The observed average difference between the estimated isotopic compositions of the 

pure calcite and pure dolomite end-members (reported in Table 6.4) ranges from 4.2 to 

4.7‰ (PDB). These values are clearly higher than the theoretical values expected 

according to the isotopic fractionation factors (?18Odol-cal) of 3.10‰ (at 4ºC) and 2.98‰ (at 

14ºC), as defined by the Vasconcelos et al., (2005) dolomite oxygen isotope fractionation 

equation (6.28) with the Kim and O'Neil (1997) proposed equation (6.16) for calcite. The 

large observed difference between the estimated and the theoretical equilibrium isotopic 

fractionation factors indicate that both minerals have not precipitated in isotopic 

equilibrium. According to the petrographic and XRD observations two different calcite 

phases can be distinguished: a pelagic calcite from the calcareous nanofossils and 

foraminifera shells; and a authigenic calcite that composes the cement with dolomite, 

proto-dolomite and high Mg-calcite (Figure 5.8.B). It is so to be expected that the dolomite 

phase and the pelagic calcite would not have been precipitated in isotopic equilibrium. 

Because the amount of pelagic CaCO3 of the background sediment is on average 34 wt% 

(Section 5.4, Table 5.1) the calculated isotopic composition of the calcite and high Mg-

calcite estimated through the EDTA technique is strongly influenced by the pelagic calcite 

signal. Therefore, the estimated average oxygen isotopic composition value of the calcite 

end-member of 0.98 and 1.44‰ (PDB) is reflecting the larger amount of calcite of pelagic 

origin, like the foraminifera and cocolith shells precipitated from normal seawater. 

The authigenic calcite and/or high Mg-calcite that composes the cement, occurs in 

variable proportions on the samples, and according to the petrographic observations it is 

expected to be formed in isotopic equilibrium with the dolomite phase and not in 

equilibrium with the pelagic calcite. The isotopic values of these authigenic calcite phases 

are interpreted as the ones that are shown to have isotopic compositions that stand away 

from the average values and that constitutes the extreme and wide range of estimated 

isotopic values (from -1.6 to + 5.0‰ PDB). 

The values of the seawater or pore fluids from which the mineral has precipitated, 



 
Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz 

 236

estimated from the average compositions of calcite and dolomite, are very similar, both 

indicating normal seawater composition. 

Low isotopic value compositions of calcite and dolomite end-members indicate 

formation from pore fluids with 18O-depleted isotopic compositions, considering the same 

temperatures (-1.5‰ SMOW for calcite and -0.2‰ SMOW for dolomite), and are 

interpreted as precipitating from residual waters formed during the crystallization of 

methane hydrates. 

Maximum estimated values for seawater or pore fluids from which the minerals 

precipitated were estimated from the maximum isotopic values of calcite and dolomite 

end-members, and for similar temperatures, correspond to similar seawater isotopic 

compositions (2.8‰ to 5.1‰ SMOW for calcite and 2.0 to 4.45‰ SMOW for dolomite). 

This is interpreted as precipitation from pore fluids formed during the destabilization of 

methane hydrates. 

It should be noted that there is a significant difference of about 1‰ SMOW for the 

estimated pore fluids isotopic composition from with the calcite and dolomite precipitated. 

This difference was already been shown (in section 6.4.1.1) as revealed by the difference 

between the isotopic fractionation factors of the two end-members, pure calcite and pure 

dolomite (4.2‰ PDB), which is larger than the theoretical value of 3.1‰ PDB. Partially 

this difference can be explained by the presence of two end-members in the calcite faction, 

(as discussed in section 6.5.2): (1) the pelagic calcite, composed by the detrital carbonate 

and foraminifera and cocolith tests, that corresponds to a formation in isotopic equilibrium 

with normal seawater composition; and (2) the authigenic calcite that should have formed 

in isotopic equilibrium with the dolomite. Alternatively, this difference can also be 

interpreted as reflecting a larger range of ?18Ow compositions for calcite and more 

restricted optimal conditions favourable for dolomite precipitation. This is interpreted as an 

indication of a relatively large variability of the fluid composition during the sample 

formation and a different time and/or different fluid composition during the formation of 

the different authigenic carbonates. As already seen in chapter 5, section 5.5.1) dolomite, 

compared to the calcite and Mg-calcite, is expected to precipitate under more restricted 

geochemical environments (high alkalinity and low SO42- environment conditions). The 

oxygen isotopic data is interpreted as indicating more restricted pore water compositions 

than the calcite precipitation. As illustrated in Figure 6.21, the minimum ?18Ow pore fluids 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 237

composition from which calcite is precipitating from is estimated to be more 18O-depleted 

(by about 1‰ SMOW) that for the minimum ?18Ow pore fluids composition from which 

dolomite is precipitating from. The maximum ?18Ow pore fluids composition for calcite 

precipitation indicates a heavier oxygen isotopic values than for dolomite.

6.5.3 Paleo-temperatures and fluid composition on aragonite pavements 

Aragonite pavement samples (Figure 6.13) reveal a linear correlation between the 

aragonite/calcite ratio and the ?18O values. Deviations of the ?18O values in bulk samples 

of the aragonite pavements are, to some extent, related to the respective mineral 

compositions and result from the different fractionation processes associated with the 

formation of low Mg-calcite, high Mg-calcite and aragonite. Calcite and aragonite 

precipitation from pore waters with different oxygen isotopic compositions or at different 

temperature are discussed in this section. 

 

6.5.3.1 Calcite and high Mg-calcite 
The relation between ?18O of calcite, temperature and oxygen isotope composition of 

waters, from which calcite had precipitated, evaluated by the Kim and O'Neil (1997) 

equation is illustrated in Figure 6.22, with oxygen isotope composition of waters ranging 

from -2 to +3‰ SMOW. Figure 6.23 illustrates the different temperature 18O-fractionation 

equations defined for calcite and for Mg-calcite and the extrapolated range of ?18O values 

of the calcite end-member phase of the aragonite pavements, assuming oxygen isotope

Figure 6.22. Plot showing the relation between oxygen isotope composition estimated for calcite and/or high 
Mg-calcite in aragonite pavement samples and temperature of precipitation with oxygen isotope composition 
of seawater are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3‰ vs. SMOW. The relation is based on the equation given by Kim and 
O'Neil (1997). 

 

From Figure 6.22 and Figure 6.23, it is evident that the extrapolated average oxygen 

isotopic values of the end-member calcite (2.3‰ PDB) can be explained by the 

precipitation from normal seawater composition (0-1.5‰ SMOW) with temperature up to 

10ºC, considering low Mg-calcite as dominant over high Mg-calcite. This would imply that 

for temperatures of 11.48 ºC (Gardner et al., 2001) or 12.30ºC (Kopf et al., 2004) 

measured at the seafloor on the Hesperides MV, where aragonite pavements were retrieved 

from, the calcite end-member measurements, ranging from 2.8 to 4.0‰ PDB, values 

higher than the average value (2.3‰ PDB), this would imply a precipitation from 18O-

enriched pore water with a composition of at least 1.81‰ SMOW. This would require that 

the precipitation of calcite with the estimated average isotopic composition had 

precipitated from slightly 18O-enriched pore waters or precipitated at lower ambient 

temperatures that the present day seabottom temperatures. However, some samples have 

significant amounts of high Mg-calcite in their carbonate composition, and one of the 

samples even has 4% of dolomite in the bulk composition (Chapter 5, Table 5.1). 

Alternatively, the presence of Mg-calcite can justify the apparent 18O disequilibrium. 

According to Figure 6.23 the precipitation of calcite with ?18O values of 2.3‰ PDB can be

Mud volcanism and fluid escape structures in the South Portuguese Margin and the Gulf of Cadiz

The simultaneous occurrence of high Mg-calcite and calcite is a factor that can in 

some degree explain the oxygen isotopic variability of the estimated composition of the 

end-member calcite. However, the variability in the mineralogy composition does not 

totally explain the extreme minimum and maximum values estimated for the calcite end-

member composition. The minimum value of 1.7‰ PDB estimated for the calcite end-

member that corresponds to the estimated isotopic composition for the calcite end-member 

of sample 88 in Figure 6.13 (collected from Jesus Baraza MV) corresponds to a sample 

where the low Mg-calcite to high Mg-calcite is of about 1/1. Although no temperature 

measurements were collected at the Jesus Baraza MV it is assumed that it is within the 

temperature range of 8 to 12ºC. As such, the calcite end-member ?18O value can be 

explained by precipitation from normal seawater under the present day ambient 

temperatures (Table 6.6 and Figure 6.22). 

Given that temperatures inferior to 4ºC are very improbable to occur, even 

considering glacial periods and with changes in the MO pathways and their absence at the 

sampling locations, the maximum limit value of 3.9‰ PDB on some samples can only be 

explained by precipitation from heavier pore waters. Alternatively, the maximum limit 

values of 3.9‰ PDB of some samples could be explained by precipitation from normal 

pore waters (?18Ow up to 1‰ SMOW), if the mineralogy were composed with large 

dominance of high Mg-calcite with high amounts of mol% of Mg. Nevertheless, this is not 

the case for all the samples. Sample c.a. 106, shows the maximum estimated ?18O value of 

3.9‰ PDB was collected at the Hesperides MV and is composed of calcite 18% wt% (with 

3.4% mol% Mg) and high Mg-Calcite 20% wt% (with 13% mol% Mg). Mass balance 

calculations would require a pore water isotopic composition ?1.0‰ SMOW and ambient 

temperature ? 4ºC (very inferior to the measured temperatures 11.48ºC and 12.30ºC) to be 

able to precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high Mg-calcite with a isotopic composition of 

3.9‰ PDB. Considering an ambient temperature of 8ºC a pore water with oxygen isotopic 

composition ?2.0‰ SMOW would be required to precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high 

Mg-calcite with a isotopic composition of 3.9‰ PDB. Considering an ambient temperature 

of 12ºC a pore water with oxygen isotopic composition ?2.8‰ SMOW would be required 

to precipitate a 1:1 mixture of calcite:high Mg-calcite with a isotopic composition of 3.9‰ 

PDB. Therefore, the maximum limit values (3.9‰ PDB) of this sample is interpreted as 

resulting of the precipitation from 18O-enriched pore waters, with ?18Ow of at least 2.0‰ 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 241

SMOW. As similar to the calcite and dolomite in the dolomite crusts, nodules and 

chimneys (section 6.5.2), the heavier pore water composition (?18Ow ? 2.0‰ SMOW) is 

interpreted as resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates, as it corresponds to typical 

reported isotopic values of pore waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates 

(Hesse and Harrison, 1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983). 

 

6.5.3.2 Aragonite 
The oxygen isotopic fractionation equation of Bohm et al., (2000) defined for 

aragonite is illustrated in Figure 6.25 for pore waters with isotopic compositions (?18Ow) 

ranging from -2 to 4‰ SMOW. The expected temperature range and the calculated 

isotopic composition of the pure end-member aragonite phase (?18Oarg) are also plotted. In 

Figure 6.24 are also plotted the other oxygen isotopic fractionation equations defined for 

aragonite and the same pore waters compositions range, temperature and pure phase 

aragonite end-member calculated compositions as in Figure 6.25. 

From Figure 6.24 and Figure 6.25 it is evident that the extrapolated average value of 

the pure aragonite end-member (4.2‰ PDB) can be explained by precipitation from 

normal seawater, with isotopic compositions ranging from 0 to 1.5‰ SMOW only for 

ambient temperatures inferior to 7.8ºC. Present day temperature values collected from 

places where aragonite pavements were collected indicate higher temperatures (11-12ºC). 

Therefore, the extrapolated average value of the pure aragonite end-member can reflect 

precipitation during colder periods most probably when the MO was absent from the sites 

where the aragonite pavements are found and the ambient water was at least 4 ºC colder 

than today. Alternatively these aragonite composition can be reflecting precipitation from 
18O-enriched pore waters. Considering the calculated 18O-enriched pore waters during the 

precipitation of calcite mineralogy in the aragonite pavements, and considering the 

petrographic and textural characteristics of the aragonite pavements that indicate that the 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurred very close or at the seafloor, where the 

seawater (?18Ow ~ 0‰ SMOW) should clearly dominate, then the hypothesis of 

precipitation of aragonite from ?18O enriched pore waters, with compositions ranging from 

1.1‰ to 2‰ SMOW, is interpreted as the more probable.

isotopic compositions in the range from 1.0 to 1.9‰ SMOW. 

The maximum estimated value of the aragonite end-member (?18Oarag=5.9‰ PDB) 

can only be explained by precipitation from 18O-enriched pore waters. Even for the lower 

temperature acceptable for this area (4ºC) the estimated isotopic compositions of the pore 

waters have to be significantly enriched (i.e., +0.80‰ SMOW). To the more realistic 

temperature range (8-12ºC) the estimated composition of the pore water from which the 

aragonite precipitates from have compositions between 3.2‰ SMOW and 4.2‰ SMOW 

(Table 6.6). 

As similar to the ?18O-enriched pore waters estimated for the heavier calcites and 

dolomites in the dolomite chimneys samples (sections 6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2) and the heavier 

calcite in the aragonite pavements (section 6.5.3.1), the enrichment in the heavy oxygen 

isotope (?18Ow ? 1.1‰ SMOW) is interpreted as resulting from gas hydrate dissociation, 

which yields a cage water with an oxygen isotopic composition of up to +3‰ SMOW 

(Hesse and Harrison, 1981; Davidson et al., 1983; Jenden and Gieskes, 1983).

6.5.3.3 Aragonite pavement carbonates 
The values of the seawater/pore waters from which the carbonate minerals 

precipitated, as estimated from the average compositions of calcite and aragonite indicate 

similar formation conditions (Figure 6.26) for both minerals. The estimated minimum 

oxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids, from which the pure phase end-

members calcite and aragonite precipitated from, indicate a composition close to normal 

seawater values for the most probable temperature interval considered (more than -0.5‰ 

SMOW for more than 4ºC for calcite and more than 0‰ SMOW for more than 4ºC for 

aragonite). The estimated maximum oxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids 

from which the pore phase end-members calcite and aragonite had precipitated indicate 18O 

enriched pore fluids composition, even considering the lower assumed temperature limit of 

4ºC. This is interpreted as indicating (especially for aragonite) a precipitation from pore 

fluids formed during the destabilization of methane hydrates. The estimated average 

oxygen isotopic values of the seawater or pore fluids from which the pore phase end-

members calcite and aragonite precipitated also indicates that aragonite had precipitated 

from a more 18O enriched pore fluid composition that the calcite phase. 

An estimated ?18O of pure aragonite end-member mineral yields on average 4.2‰ 

(PDB), whereas 18O is strongly lighter in the pure calcite end-member (2.3‰ Figure 6.13). 

The difference between the two carbonate phases (1.9‰) is larger than the expected value 

due to the differences in the oxygen isotopic fractionation ?18Oarag-calc value of 1.4‰, 

according to Figure 6.5. As seen in section 6.5.2.3, as discussed for the apparent non 

equilibrium between the calcite and dolomite phases in the dolomite crusts, chimneys and 

nodules, the larger difference (1.9‰) in the isotopic fractionation between calcite and 

aragonite can be due to the pelagic contribution of the detrital calcite and mainly from the 

foraminifera and cocoliths tests that represent isotopic compositions in equilibrium with 

normal seawater compositions and that have the effect of lowering the global isotopic 

composition of the total calcite phase. Admitting that both mineralogies were precipitated 

in or close to isotopic equilibrium with the pore fluids from which they precipitated, this 

implies that the calcite and the aragonite precipitation occurs in slightly different 

environmental conditions, most probably considerably different temperature and/or ?18O 

isotopic composition of the pore water fluids. Alternatively, if the effect of the pelagic 

calcite fraction is ignored, then for the same temperatures, the estimated oxygen isotopic 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 245

composition of the seawater or pore fluids from which calcite precipitates from is 0.5 to 

0.6‰ (SMOW), more 18O-depleted than the estimated composition of the pore fluids from 

which aragonite is precipitated from (Figure 6.26). This is interpreted as one of the reasons 

for the observed difference of 1.9‰ PDB (Figure 6.13) between the calcite and aragonite 

isotopic fractionation factors (?18Oarag-cal) that is higher than the expected theoretical 

difference of 1.4‰ (PDB) (Section 6.1.4.4, Figure 6.5). Therefore, the precipitation of 

calcite and aragonite can alternatively be occurring, at similar temperatures but from pore 

fluids with slightly different oxygen isotopic compositions, with aragonite precipitating 

from an more 18O-enriched (0.5 to 0.6‰) pore fluids that the calcite.

As described in section 5.1.4, the aragonite pavement samples present several 

lithologic, textural and mineralogical indicators that suggest the influence of gas hydrates 

on the formation of these MDAC samples. The stromatolitic fabric, the presence of 

botryoidal textures composed of almost pure aragonite mineralogy, both infilling mega-

pores and cavities are interpreted as resulting from aragonite precipitation in association 

with gas hydrates, similar to the descriptions of several other cold seeps MDAC 

(Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). The structure of the intraformational 

breccias is interpreted as resulting from gas hydrate growth and decomposition, mechanism 

interpreted to be the responsible for the collapse and breccification of pre-existing crusts 

and pavements. Subsequent re-cementation produced the intraformational breccias. Both 

these evidences support the interpretation that the oxygen isotopic composition of the 

carbonates reflects, at least for some samples, the influence of gas hydrates decomposition 

on the formation of calcite and specially aragonite authigenic minerals of the aragonite 

pavements. 

The dominance of aragonite in the matrix, occurring as pure aragonite stromatolitic 

layers and botryoids, that from the underwater observations that indicate their occurrence 

at the seafloor (Chapter 8) and the gas hydrate fabrics are interpreted as indicating a near-

surface origin of the aragonite pavements. Here, the geochemical conditions with high 

alkalinity and higher sulphate concentrations stimulate aragonite precipitation (Burton, 

1993; Savard et al., 1996). The high alkalinity is interpreted as resulting from high 

methane oxidation rates, consequence of high methane concentrations from gas hydrate 

destabilization and high sulphate concentration from the intense seawater ventilation. 

Calcite formation is favoured at relatively lower alkalinity and lower sulphate 

concentrations, indicating an intra-sediment environment, with 18O-enriched pore water. 

Such conditions are suggested to be present after the decomposition of gas hydrates or in 

methane rich sediments, in a less ventilated environment as in intra-sediment environment 

where the sulphate has been partially consumed for the oxidation of the hydrate-methane 

via sulphate reduction and is not restored. If this mechanism evolves to a more confine 

system, most probably at a micro environmental scale, in consequence of the progressive 

cementation, it can lead to the total sulphate consumption and in cases of high alkalinity, 

probably after significant Ca removal during intense calcite and aragonite precipitation, 

these conditions can lead to the precipitation of high Mg-calcite or even to dolomite, in the 



 

Chapter 6. Origin, paleo-temperature and composition reconstruction of fluids associated with the formation 
of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 247

aragonite pavements. The presence of minor amounts of dolomite (4.4% of the total 

carbonate phase) in sample 3611-A01.92, can be interpreted as reflecting this mechanism. 

 

6.5.4 Comparison of aragonite pavements and dolomite crusts, 

chimneys and nodules 

Comparing the estimated oxygen isotopic composition of the pore fluids from which 

the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules and the aragonite pavements probably formed 

(Figure 6.27) it is possible to infer that they formed in slightly different conditions.

The dolomite chimneys formed in wider isotopic conditions, while the aragonite

compositions or from a 18O-enriched pore waters indicating a contribution from dissociated 

gas hydrates. The dolomite chimneys indicate similar normal seawater conditions, pore 

waters resulting from the destabilization of gas hydrates and precipitation from pore waters 

during gas hydrates formation. The smaller interval of variation of the estimated pore water 

composition of the aragonite pavements is interpreted as reflecting the more proximal and 

intense influence of seawater. The larger interval of variation of the estimated pore water 

composition of the dolomite chimneys is interpreted as reflecting a more distant and 

confined environment where the pore waters are able to evolve and differ more intensely 

away from the normal seawater isotopic composition. 

 

6.6 Conclusions 

 

Considering the present day temperature (ranging from 8 to 12 ºC) and the extreme 

limits for temperature variation, considering the oxygen isotopic composition of the Gulf 

of Cadiz bottom water both for the NADW and the MO, and assuming that the oxygen 

isotopic ratio variations are the typical between glacial and interglacial stages, within the 

range from +0.5 to +1.5‰ SMOW, the isotopic composition of the original fluids from 

which the carbonates were precipitated were estimated according to the different mineral 

temperature of precipitation equations. Considering the minimum and maximum 

temperature limits, admitted to be possible to occur at these sites, not all the measured 

carbonate isotopic values are compatible with precipitation from normal seawater isotopic 

composition.  

Aragonite pavements are estimated to be formed from normal seawater oxygen 

isotopic compositions and from a 18O-enriched pore waters indicating a contribution from 

dissociated gas hydrates. The aragonite pavement samples indicate a formation in 

environments near or at the sediment seawater interface, while the dolomite chimneys 

indicate a formation in more confined within the sediment column. The dolomite chimneys 

indicate formation conditions similar normal seawater and destabilization of gas hydrates 

but they also indicate precipitation from pore waters during gas hydrates formation. 

The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the analyses of authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear 

and major addition of Sr from deep seated fluids, but they preferably reflect the

of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 249

contemporaneous seawater Sr composition. This is evident on the aragonite pavement and 

on the dolomite crust Sr isotopic signals. The dolomite chimney sample indicate signal that 

supports a contribution from a deeper seated fluids and/or an older seawater origin.

Chapter 7.  U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of 
Cadiz: record of intense past fluid escape episodes 

 

 

7.1 Introduction 

 

The high abundance of fluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, expressed as mud 

volcanoes, mud diapirs, pockmarks, active seepage, modern and fossil cold seepage 

recorded by the precipitation methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC), is an 

indicator that fluid seepage has been an active process in this area in the present and past 

geological record (e.g. Somoza et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Magalhães et al., 

2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Magalhães et al., 2004; Rensbergen et al., 

2005).  

Several hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage indicators can be considered in the geologic 

record. Amongst those indicators, the more important are the MDAC that typically exhibit 

highly negative carbon isotopic signatures, with ?13C values ranging from -10 to -90‰ 

VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite), depending on the microbial or thermogenic source 

origin of the methane. The carbon and oxygen isotopic signals from MDAC recovered 

from seepage areas are now being extensively used to investigate past fluid escape and 

episodes of gas hydrate destabilization in marine sediments (Dickens et al., 1995; Hesselbo 

et al., 2000; Krull and Retallack, 2000; Krull et al., 2000). While there is still a discussion 

whether the ?13C signature in seep benthic foraminifera really reflects the surrounding pore 

water composition from which they have precipitated or if it was acquired later, after 

deposition, during diagenesis (Torres et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2004), the negative ?13C 

excursions recorded by benthic foraminiferal shells in cold seep sediments have been 

interpreted as indicating methane release episodes (Hill et al., 2004; Mackensen et al., 

2006) some of these, proposed to be related with methane hydrate dissociation (e.g. 

Dickens et al., 1997; Kennett et al., 2000, 2003). Hydrocarbon seepage is also marked by 



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 252 

chemosynthetic communities like particular species of bivalves, tube worms and bacterial 

mats that derive their energy from the oxidation of advected reduced elements and/or 

hydrocarbon compounds (Sibuet and Olu, 1998).  

In the Gulf of Cadiz, MDAC occur as seafloor crusts, pavements, build-ups, 

concretions, and conduit or chimney-like forms, and are associated with seepage of 

hydrocarbon-rich fluids (mainly methane, as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6). Their 

formation is triggered by the increase of alkalinity during anaerobic methane oxidation 

(AOM), coupled with sulphate reduction (SR) (e.g. Hovland et al., 1987; Ritger et al., 

1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Paull et al., 1992) in a process mediated by microbial 

activity (Boetius et al., 2000). The mineralogy of these carbonates (aragonite, calcite, Mg-

calcite, protodolomite and dolomite) records different geochemical and diagenetic 

environments during their formation process. In particular, there is clear evidence that the 

formation of some of these MDAC is associated with the dissociation of gas hydrates 

(Chapter 6), given the abnormal positive ?18O values of the constituent authigenic 

carbonate minerals. 

Therefore, past fluid flow and gas hydrate formation/dissociation episodes can be 

reconstructed from the MDAC (e.g. Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). 

Amongst all the different seepage structures, MDAC are those that probably better record 

the seepage activity at cold seeps. They can potentially record the fluid flow intensity, 

whether the fluid flow venting is a continuous process or if it occurs discontinuously, and 

the timing and age of the seeping episodes. Absolute dating of the MDAC can therefore 

provide the means for reconstructing the past fluid escape episodes, their frequency and 

evolution through time. Dating of the MDAC is also essential to constrain the external 

factors that can actively control the fluid flow and its intensity, such as tectonic events, 

mass-wasting processes, sea-level variations, gas hydrate formation/destabilisation, and 

also to assess the potential impact and significance of these processes in global climate 

change. 

Conventional 14C dating techniques are not applicable to MDAC, as their carbon 

derives partially from thermogenic, old methane. The most suitable dating technique, also 

favourable due to its larger time window, is the U/Th dating technique, that was 

successfully applied to authigenic carbonates from the Hydrate Ridge (Teichert et al., 

2003). The 230Th-234U-238U system as also been proven to be adequate for dating a variety 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 253

of materials from Late Pleistocene to Holocene age (Broecker, 1963; Broecker et al., 

1968). Therefore, U/Th dating was employed here for the age determination of selected 

samples from MDAC dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz. 

In the following section, the analytical procedure developed with the objective of 

date the MDAC samples from the Gulf of Cadiz is described. The analytical processes and 

the age determination were performed at the IFM-Geomar in Kiel (Germany), during an 

author visit from October 25th to November 06th in 2004. The various U/Th dating 

approaches are also presented in this chapter, and their results discussed with the objective 

of reconstructing past fluid flow episodes and possible processes that might have 

controlled the formation of the MDAC. 

 

7.2 Materials and methods 

7.2.1 Samples used 

In this work, two MDAC samples (3463-A03 and 3463-A08) were selected for 

dating (Table 7.1 and Figure 7.2). Both samples were collected by dredging on the Cadiz 

Channel, to the west of the Iberico mud cone during the TTR11 cruise, station TTR11-

AT339D (Kenyon et al., 2002). This sampling site is located on the pathway of the lower 

core of the Mediterranean Outflow (Figure 7.1.B), which flows in direct contact with the 

seafloor, producing a strong erosive effect, as discussed in Chapter 4. The selected samples 

for U/Th analysis belong to the dolomite chimneys type, as defined in Chapter 5. Sample 

3463-A03 was taken from a chimney with two parallel cemented conduits with no internal 

open vent channels and with distinct concentric growth layers around the two cemented 

conduit axes. Sub-samples for age determination were collected at the centre of each of the 

conduit axes and in intermediate layers, in order to evaluate if the different axes 

correspond to separate or the same formation episode. Sample 3463-A08 as taken from a 

chimney with an open central vent channel, very homogeneous, with no detected 

concentric growth layers neither any longitudinal textural discontinuity along the chimney. 

Both samples were selected because of their mineral composition, with more than 65% of 

carbonate (Dolomite: 54 to 78%; Calcite: 3 to 13%), and because they show little or no 

oxidation, as revealed by their pale-yellow to pale-grey colours. This is interpreted as 

indicating that these chimneys were exposed to the seawater during a period of time not

represents the temperature in winter conditions and it can be significantly reduced or even null during part of 
the year. In red are plotted the salinity profiles and in blue the temperature profiles.

From each sample, 5 sub-samples were collected by hand-drilling until ca. 29 to 36 

mg of powder carbonate were obtained. The sub-samples were collected in order to define 

radial and longitudinal profiles along the chimneys (as illustrated in Figure 7.2). The 

powder material was treated for U/Th analysis according to the analytical procedures 

described in section 7.2.3.

7.2.2.1 Petrography of the two dolomite chimneys 

The two samples analysed for age determination have distinct petrographic 

characteristics. While sample 3463-A03 corresponds to a cemented sand-siltstone (Figure 

7.3) with the detrital fraction being composed by sand to silty dominated terrigenous 

matrix and abundant bioclasts, sample 3463-A08 corresponds to a mud-wackstone with a 

detrital fraction composed mainly by clay fraction. Therefore, sediments that were on the 

origin of sample 3463-A03 have higher initial porosity and therefore higher initial 

permeability; the sample 3463-A08 has lower initial porosity and lower permeability.

(C and D) where it is evident that sample 3463-A03 have a sand size grain supported texture while sample 

3463-A08 that corresponds to a mudstone/wackstone have a cement/clay matrix supported texture. Therefore 

the initial permeability of sample 3463-A03 is much higher than sample 3463-A08.

7.2.2.3 Carbon and Oxygen Isotopic analysis 

The carbon and oxygen stable isotopic composition of the analysed samples was 

determined at the ETH Centre in Zurich according to the methodology described in chapter 

4, section 3 and the results are shown in Table 7.3. The estimated ?18O of pure phases was 

calculated based on the isotopic fractionation equation defined by the EDTA leaching 

technique, which was also used to calculate the pure phases, calcite and dolomite, and the 

?18O composition in all the MDAC samples, according to figure 6.11 (chapter 6). The 

estimated ?13C of pure phases, calcite and dolomite, was calculated based on the isotopic 

fractionation equation defined by all the sample dataset, according to figure 6.12 (chapter 

6). Theoretical ?18O compositions for pure calcite and dolomite phases were calculated for 

the present day temperature at the sampling sites (11ºC), estimated from the CANIGO 

CTD dataset (Ambar et al., 2002), as plotted in Figure 7.1, and the ?18OSMOW isotopic 

values of seawater collected from the lower core of the Mediterranean Outflow (MO) at

locations close to the sampling site (Voelker, 2005). For calcite, the Kim and O'Neil (1997) 

fractionation equation (chapter 6) was used, and for dolomite the one proposed by 

Vasconcelos et al. (2005).

7.2.3 Sample preparation and analytical methods 

The analytical procedure for separation and purification of U and Th was similar to 

that described by Chen et al. (1986) and Edwards et al. (1987). 

Approximately 30 mg of sample material was collected by hand-drilling. Powdered 

samples were dissolved with HNO3 acid until all carbonate was dissolved and spiked with 

120 µl of spike MIX 6, centrifuged, and the solution evaporated in a hot plate (90ºC) 

overnight. It was then dissolved in 1N HC1, and 8 mg of Fe in chloride solution was 

added. The U and Th were then co-precipitated with the Fe by the addition of ammonium 

hydroxide until the color of the solution changed from yellow to clear. The mixture was

centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The residue was then rinsed twice with distilled 

water, dissolved in concentrated HNO3, dried and re-dissolved in concentrated HNO3 

twice, dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 7N HNO3. This solution was loaded on an anion 

exchange column (Dowex AG 1 × 8 resin) with a volume of 0.5 ml previously washed 

with mili-Q water, HNO3-H2O (1:1), HCl 6N, and mili-Q water. Fe was eluted using 7N 

HNO3. The Th fraction was then eluted with 6N HCl and the U fraction with 1N HBr. The 

U fraction was dried three times and dissolved in 0.1N HNO3. An aliquot, containing ~ 3x 

1010 atoms of 234U, was loaded on a graphite-coated zone refined Re filament. The Th 

fraction was further purified by drying it, dissolving it in HNO3, drying it again, and 

dissolving it in 0.15 ml of 7N HNO3. This solution was loaded on a column similar to the 

first column used but with a volume of 0.15 ml. A similar elution scheme was followed. 

The subsequent Th fraction was dried and dissolved in 0.1N HNO3. 

Three analytical blanks, one ~100 mg of LICS, and a standard solution of HU1 with 

a proportion of U-Th of 1:1 were submitted to the same sample preparation methodology 

and measured with the samples for control. U and Th isotope measurements were 

performed with a 233U/236U double spike and a 229Th single spike by Thermal Ionisation 

Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) on a Finnigan MAT 262 RPQ, at IFM-Geomar in Kiel, 

Germany. 

 

7.3 Results and Discussion 

7.3.1 Constrains on the origin of the uranium in the MDAC 

The U concentration in the carbonates depends on many factors, such as the U 

concentration on the precipitation fluids, the mineralogy, the mineral morphology, the 

temperature, and the geochemical conditions during mineral formation (Shen and Dunbar, 

1995). The average U concentrations of the analysed MDAC are higher than the average 

value for modern seawater (Figure 7.4). Within the two chimney samples the U 

concentrations vary significativelly. Sample 3463-A03 has similar values for the different 

sub-samples, from 0.64 to 3.24 µg/g, while the sub-samples from sample 3463-A08 show a 

larger variation of U concentration values, ranging from 0.26 to 28.10 µg/g (Figure 7.4 and 

Table 7.4). Sample 3463-A03 shows very similar ?234U values for the different sub-

samples and sample 3463-A08 has a larger dispersion of the sub-sample values. Sub-



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 260 

samples 3 and 5 of chimney 3463-A08 have abnormal high U concentrations, although 

abnormal mineral content was not detected on the XRD analysis; a detrital contribution 

may explain these high U values. Alternatively, high U concentrations on these sub-

samples can result from an abnormal U content in the fluids from which these carbonates 

precipitated from. Although not statistically significant, these two sub-samples were 

collected closer to the open conduit of fluid percolation, and therefore may correspond to a 

more intense fluid composition signal. It should be noted that chimney 3463-A08 presents 

a much wider range of U concentration and ?234U values in its sub-samples than chimney 

3463-A03 (Figure 7.6). Although sample 3463-A08 represents a shorter formation time-

span than chimney 3463-A03 (see section 7.3.2), this can be interpreted as indicating a 

much more variable fluid composition during the time-span corresponding to the formation 

of the chimney 3463-A08. 

As concerns ?234U values, all sub-samples in sample 3463-A03 have lower ?234U 

values than seawater (Figure 7.5). Again, sample 3463-A08 shows highly variable ?234U 

values, with sub-samples 3, 4 and 5 showing lower ?234U values than seawater but, with 

sub-samples 1 and 2 showing higher ?234U values than seawater (Figure 7.5). 

U is highly soluble in oxic conditions and highly insoluble under anoxic conditions 

(Barnes and Cochran, 1990). Therefore, the U concentration of the dolomite chimneys that 

are formed as a result of AOM (chapter 5 and 6), i.e. precipitated from anoxic pore waters, 

are expected to have lower U concentrations than the authigenic carbonates precipitated 

from bottom waters, such as the aragonite-dominated MDAC or corals. The uranium 

concentration of pure aragonite (&gt;97 wt.% aragonite) chemoherm carbonates reported by 

Teichert et al., (2003), that are considered as being formed in highly seawater ventilated 

environments, most probably at or very close to the sediment/seawater interface (very 

similar to the aragonite pavement samples described in chapter 5), have mean U 

concentrations of 5.2 ± 0.8 µg/g. Modern (D. cristagalli) and fossil corals have reported 

average U concentration values of 3.85 and 3.78 µg/g, respectively (Cheng et al., 2000). 

These reported chemoherm and coral U concentration values are higher than the measured 

values of the analysed samples in this study (Figure 7.4) (with the exception of sub-

samples 3 and 5 in sample 3463-A08, discussed above), supporting the formation model of 

the dolomite chimneys in an anoxic environment within the sedimentary column, as 

discussed in Chapter 5.

Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid

 262 

 

The U concentrations and the ?234U values of the authigenic carbonates are 

dependent on the U concentration and the ?234U composition of the fluids from which they 

precipitated from, but may also vary with several chemical factors, such as the redox 

conditions during the carbonate formation (Teichert et al., 2003). In order to investigate if 

the seawater has an important contribution to the U fluid composition of the two analysed 

carbonates, the uranium concentration was plotted against the ?234U ratios in Figure 7.6. 

The U concentration as a function of ?234U values of the analysed sub-samples of the 

two samples define two trend lines that are interpreted as representing mixing lines 

between different end-members. The slopes of the mixing lines depend on the composition 

of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonate precipitated, which may contain varying 

amounts of pore water fluids, methane rich fluids, and seawater. Most probably, two 

important contributions correspond to the pore water and the methane rich fluids. The 

seawater contribution is not a clear important end-member, as the two trend lines do not 

point to the seawater composition (Figure 7.6).  

Considering this simplified model, it is possible to propose that sample 3463-A03 

represents a carbonate precipitation from anoxic pore water fluids with a mixture of an 

enriched 234U fluid with a more depleted 234U fluid, both with a fairly constant ?234U 

composition. Sample 3463-A08, in contrast would represent a precipitation from a fluid 

that corresponds to a mixture of a low 234U concentration and low ?234U fluid, with a more 

enriched ?234U and higher concentration 234U fluid. Sample 3463-A03 points to an end-

member composition close to the seawater composition. As this sample has a larger 

average grain size and therefore corresponds to lithified sediments with an original higher 

porosity and higher permeability, it is interpreted that, on this sample, the pore water and 

the seawater contribution is more important than on sample 3463-A08, which corresponds 

to a cemented mudstone with very low initial porosity and low permeability. 

 

7.3.2 Age determination 

The U/Th dating method is based on the Th insolubility leading that the carbonates 

precipitated from solution are free of Th but may contain U. Known the 230Th and 234U 

decay constants, the age of the carbonate phases can be calculated from the 230Th/234U and 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 263

234U/238U activity ratios, according to the equation: 

[ ] [ ] [ ]tUUtUUUTh )exp(1)/1()/()exp(1)/(/ 042342384000234238234230 ?????? ??×?×?+??=  
Where 0?  and 4?  are the decay constants for 

230Th and 234U, respectively, and t  is 

the age. 

However, natural carbonate samples (such as the studied MDAC samples) contain 

detrital material of variable origin such as terrigenous fractions and clay minerals that can 

contribute with significant amounts of 230Th and 234U to the total sample, resulting in 

deviations of the observed 230Th/234U ratio from that of the authigenically precipitated 

carbonate component alone, and if not corrected for, produces apparent erroneous age 

values. Various methods have been proposed to “correct” this detritus contamination. On 

this study, individual sub-sample ages were obtained by correcting the analysis of a single 

leachate for its contaminant 230Th. For each sample, from which 5 coeval sub-samples with 

differing detrital component were analysed to construct an “isochron”, as discussed above. 

U and Th isotopic compositions of the authigenic carbonates and the corresponding 
230Th/234U ages, corrected for each sub-sample contaminant 230Th, are reported in Table 7.4 

and Figure 7.7.

Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 264 

Most of the samples have low 230Th/232Th activity ratios (&lt;20, with the exception of 

samples 3 and 5), and therefore corrections for the inherited 230Th were done using the 
230Th, 232Th and ?238U activities to extrapolate the detritus contribution. It should be noted 

that the term detritus used here deviates from its sedimentological definition. The detritus 

phase here refers to all phases bearing Th isotopes initially incorporated into the sample. 

The U-series datation method is based on the large difference in solubility between U and 

Th. In most of the systems, such as the authigenic carbonate phases precipitation from 

natural solutions, they will have very low 232Th/238U and 230Th/238U ratios. The 230Th 

growth method for dating these carbonate phases may be employed with confidence by 

assuming 230Th/234U = 0, at the time of formation. This is only possible in the cases in 

which the authigenic phases that contain U are essentially free of 232Th. In the case of the 

analysed MDAC samples, which contain significant amounts of non-authigenic carbonate 

minerals, such as biogenic fragments, quartz, feldspars and clays (15 to 35%), it should be 

expected the presence of non free 232Th from those allochtonous minerals. Therefore, the 

corrections to the initial 230Th, 238U and 234U have to be made assuming that it is 

accompanied by the 232Th. Therefore, the correction value of the detritus 230Th contribution 

is assumed to be equal to the 232Th concentration. 

The isochron method is the common approach to solve this problem. By analyzing 

three or more co-genetic samples with variable 238U/232Th, it is possible to extrapolate the 
232Th-free end-member isotopic ratios from a least-squares regression of the data on a pair 

of isotope-ratio diagrams that completely define the 238U-234U-230Th-232Th system. The 

isochron method allows the definition of the detrital correction from the several sub-

samples of each chimney. Since five sub-samples of each sample were analysed, and 

assuming that the chimneys were formed rapidly, compared with their ages, the five co-

genetic sub-samples have different authigenic carbonate/detritus ratios and so, variable 
230Th-234U-238U isotope ratios. Four pairs of isotope-ratio or isochron diagrams could be 

used (Ludwig and Titterington, 1994): (1) the Rosholt type I isochron diagrams: 
230Th/232Th - 234U/232Th and 234U/232Th - 238U/232Th; (2) the Osmond type I isochron 

diagrams: 230Th/234U - 232Th/234U and 234U/238U - 232Th/238U; (3) the Rosholt type II 

isochron diagrams: 230Th/232Th - 238U/232Th and 234U/232Th - 238U/232Th; and (4) the 

Osmond type II isochron diagrams: 230Th/238U - 232Th/238U and 234U/238U - 232Th/238U.

Figure 7.7. U/Th ages determined along radial and longitudinal profiles on the analysed samples. 

 

In this study, the 232Th-free end-member, from which the age is calculated from, is 

given by either the slope in the Rosholt diagrams or by the intercept in the Osmond 

diagrams. It should be noted that analytical errors produce a scattering of the points around 

the theoretical strait lines. Additionally, scattering can also result from uranium and 

thorium open-system behaviour and/or the presence of multiple end-members. 

In the isochron diagrams (Figure 7.8, Figure 7.9 and Figure 7.10), the mixing lines 

between any two components are strait lines with fairly good correlation coefficients, 

indicating that the assumed conditions for the use of this technique are adequate. The 

Rosholt isochrones for both samples show good correlation coefficients (0.999). The 

Osmond isochrones show a good correlation coefficient for sample 3463-A08 (0.95 and 

0.71) but a more deficient correlation for sample 3463-A03 (0.71 and 0.36). This indicates 

that the assumed considerations are respected to a high degree for sample 3463-A08, but 

not so well for sample 3463-A03 and therefore the calculated ages with the isochron 

methods are reliable and the ages estimated by this method are expected to be closer to the 

real age of the pure authigenic carbonate phases. 

The Osmond isochrones indicate a mean age of 360 ka for chimney 3463-A03 and a 

mean age of 247.8 ka for chimney 3463-A08, which is also very close to the ages 

determined for the sub-samples.

7.3.2.1 Sample 3463-A08 

The sub-samples collected from radial and longitudinal profiles along this chimney 

yield ages reported in Figure 7.11 and Table 7.4, ranging between 244 ka and 246 ka. This 

indicates a short formation time-span of ~4 ka ± 50 ka, consistent with the homogeneous 

character of this sample. The estimated ages, while having associated considerable error 

values are statistically significant, indicating that the formation of the chimney occurs 

during a short episode of enhanced precipitation, indicating a high rate of carbonate 

formation (1 cm/ka). Given its textural homogeneity, this chimney was, most probably, 

formed continuously. Given that sub-samples 3, 4 and 5 were collected from a equal 

distance from the chimney centre, it is possible to propose that the growth of the chimney 

proceeds from the centre to the periphery. 

The Osmond isochron age estimated for sample 3463-A08 is in very good agreement 

with the individual ages of the sub-samples (Table 7.4, Table 7.5 and Figure 7.11). The 

good linear correlation of the trend lines defined by the isochron techniques (Figure 7.8 to 

Figure 7.10) point to a good estimation of the ages by the isochon technique.  

 

7.3.2.2 Sample 3463-A03 

Sub-samples collected along a radial profile in sample 3463-A03 yielded ages 

ranging from 89 ka to 221 ka (Table 7.4 and Figure 7.11). Sample 3463-A03 corresponds 

to a chimney with two cemented parallel conduits. The centre of conduit 1 has an estimated 

age of 221 ka and a growing direction from the centre of the conduit to the periphery, with 

subsequent enlargement episodes (continuous or discontinuous). Conduit 2 has an 

estimated age of 89 ka and indicates an apparent growing direction from the exterior to the 

centre of the conduit. The ages of the sample as their heterogeneous texture indicates that 

the formation of the sample was, most probably, episodically, with a first fluid flow 

episode that induced the precipitation of conduit 1. Carbonate precipitation progressed 

radially from this conduit (most probably by discontinuous episodes). A latter fluid episode 

resulted in the precipitation of conduit 2. The grow rate on this sample is vary variable 

ranging from 2.6 mm/ka, considering just the conduit 1 zone (segment between sub-

samples 6 and 7) to 0.6 mm/ka, considering the zone between the centre of the two 

conduits (sub-samples 7 and 10). 



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 270 

The age estimated by the Osmond isochron method for this sample indicates an age 

of 360 ka, with a lower limit of 243 ka and the maximum limit indicates more than 500 ka 

(Table 7.5 and Figure 7.9), above the upper limit of this dating technique. The discrepancy 

between the isochrone age and the 230Th/234U ages of the different sub-samples is 

interpreted as resulting from the large time span along which the sample was formed, i.e. 

the condition of application of the isochron technique that the samples were formed in a 

short period of time compared to their age is not adequately verified. The period of 

formation (221 to 89 ka) represents a significant time span compared with the age of the 

sample (at least 60% of the maximum age). This is also reflected by the lower correlation 

coefficient of the isochon trend lines of sample 3463-A03 compared with sample 3463-

A08 (Figure 7.8 to Figure 7.10). 

 

7.3.2.3 Samples 3463-A03 and 3463-A08  

As seen in chapters 5 and 6, the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates in the Gulf 

of Cadiz is closely linked with the supply of methane-rich fluids. The estimated ages 

indicate that during this interval, favourable conditions for enhanced methane flux 

throughout the sediments, and consequently carbonate precipitation, occur at specific time 

intervals. The estimated ages of the two samples indicate that the carbonate precipitation 

and the dolomite chimney formation occur in distinct intervals or episodes. These episodes 

occur in the same geological setting and within very closely spaced locations, and are 

interpreted as indicating that the fluid escape processes within this area of the Gulf of 

Cadiz has occurred during a long time-span (at least 150 ka), but the precipitation of the 

different samples occurs in shorter episodes. Most probably, there is an edification of a 

complex plumbing system along which the carbonate chimneys are formed. The plumbing 

system most probably would show global and local variability of the fluid flow intensity. 

The seepage intensity can have episodes of high intense flux and locally the flux can be 

localized and have spatial migrations. Some fluid conduits can be interrupted by complete 

clog of the fluid conduits as a result of carbonate cementation, or if the flux along them is 

diminished or deviated to other pathways and resumed latter, giving place to the formation 

of secondary conduits, such as those represented by sample 3463-A03. Variations in the 

regional tectonic stress field would correspond to changes with larger time scale periods; 

however it is possible to speculate that earthquakes and smaller scale tectonic stress regime 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 271

changes may produce the opening, enlargement or closure of different conduits for the 

supply of methane-rich fluids. Those small scale stress readjustments can have variations 

in the same time scale period of formation of the samples. In addition, sealevel variations, 

related to glacial-interglacial fluctuations, which have a time scale cyclicity of 100 ka, will 

most probably have significant control on the fluid flow regime and intensity in the upper 

portion of the sedimentary column. Therefore, the potential regional paleoceanographic 

control on the enhanced fluid flow episodes is investigated in the next section.

7.3.3 230Th/234U ages of the MDAC and their relationship to the global 

sealevel record 

Over the time scale of glacial-interglacial cycles, the corresponding sealevel 

variations may significantly influence fluid flow in continental margins. In the Gulf of 

Cadiz, between the 600 m and the 1200 m water depths, the MO controls the sedimentation 

(Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003), the temperature of bottom water and the temperature in 

the upper sedimentary section (Figure 7.1). Glacial-interglacial changes have a strong 

influence in the MO flow pattern and the consequent temperature changes have the 

potential to dissociate possible gas hydrate occurrences in the top sediments or create 

favourable thermodynamic conditions for gas hydrate formation. 

Considering just the pressure effect, the glacial sealevel lowering with the 



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 272 

consequent lowering of pressure would shift the bottom of the gas hydrate stability zone 

into shallower depths and consequently promote the dissociation of the existing gas 

hydrates. The enhanced decomposition of gas hydrates may then generate enhanced gas 

and fluid flow in cold seep areas, leading to an increased precipitation of methane-derived 

authigenic carbonates (as described in chapter 6). In addition, the decomposition of gas 

hydrates, as a consequence of the changes in the gas hydrate stability zone, releases 

considerable amounts of fresh water into the sediment pore space, thereby increasing the 

negative pressure gradient between the pore fluids and the seawater column, enhancing the 

fluid flow. For active fluid seepage, it is most crucial that the hydraulic pressure of the 

ascending fluids in the plumbing system within the sediments exceeds the pressure of the 

overlying seawater column, that corresponds to the sealevel (Carson and Screaton, 1998). 

Therefore, two scenarios can be distinguished when considering pore water pressure 

changes due to sealevel variations: (1) the seawater pressure exceeds the hydraulic pressure 

of the plumbing system below a methane fluid seepage site, inhibiting the rise of fluids; (2) 

the seawater pressure is lower than the hydraulic pressure of the plumbing system and 

vigorous fluid seepage occurs. It is therefore possible to propose that during glacial stages, 

which correspond to low sealevel, a negative pressure gradient is established between the 

pore water fluids or the plumbing system and the seawater pressure, triggering or leading 

to maximum fluid flow rates at methane seep sites, enhancing the precipitation of methane-

derived authigenic carbonates. In contrast, during sealevel rise at the glacial to interglacial 

transitions, the seawater pressure increases and the pressure difference between the 

seawater column pressure and the hydraulic pressure in the plumbing system of the 

methane seep diminishes or is minimal. In this way, sealevel rise restricts fluid flow or 

stops it. Consequently, considering just the pressure effect, the carbonate precipitation 

during interglacial stages should be low or null and maximum precipitation should 

coincide with glacial maxima. This scenario is similar to the observed short-term tidal 

control on the fluid flow intensity variations in shallow water seep sites, where higher rates 

of fluid flow are measured coinciding with the low tides, whereas high tides are 

characterised by low or null flow rates (Boles et al., 2001; Rollet et al., 2006). The tidal 

effect on fluid flow intensity is still an effective process at deep locations up to 800 m 

water depth, as documented in the Hydrate Ridge (Tryon and Brown, 2001; Tryon et al., 

2002). 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 273

Vigorous fluid flow may nevertheless also occur during sealevel highstands as long 

as the hydraulic pressure exceeds the pressure of the height of the water column. 

In the following discussion, the mentioned isotopic stages are referred to as Marine 

Isotopic Stages (MIS) and their timing is defined according to Martinson et al. (1987), 

Shackleton (2000) and the LR04 stack of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005). 

The estimated ages of the sub-samples indicate formation (1) at the onsets of 

terminations 2 and 3, contemporary with rapid sealevel rise; (2) at the transition from 

stadial to interstadial, also corresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition 

from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to stadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, 

associated with periods of progressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12). 

Sample 3463-A08 with an estimated age of 245-246 ka (260 ka according to the 

isochron dating technique) is associated with precipitation during termination 3, at the end 

of MIS 8 and beginning of MIS 7 (between 8.02 and 7.5), corresponding to precipitation 

during a period of a rapid sealevel rise (Figure 7.12). 

The estimated age of 221 ka of the sub-sample 7 collected from the centre of conduit 

1 in sample 3463-A03 correlates with the transition from a stadial (MIS 7.4) to an 

interstadial (MIS 7.3), during a time span corresponding to a rapid sealevel rise. Sub-

sample 6 from the exterior of conduit 1, (sample 3463-A03) with an age of 135 ka, is 

related to the base of termination 2 and therefore the onset of a rapid sealevel rise. It is 

therefore evident that the centre and the periphery of conduit 1 are associated with two 

different fluid flow episodes. Sub-sample 8, in between the two conduits 1 and 2 in sample 

3463-A08, correlates with MIS 5, namely the transition from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to 

stadial MIS 5.4 and consequently with a formation related to a progressive sealevel 

lowering. Sub-samples at the centre of conduit 2 (sub-sample 10) and at their periphery 

(sub-sample 9) corresponding to ages of 89 and 93 ka respectively, are contemporary with 

a period of progressive sealevel lowering, from the interstadial MIS 5.3 to the stadial MIS 

5.2. Sub-samples at the centre and periphery of conduit 2 (sub-sample 10) and in between 

conduit 1 and 2 (sub-sample 9) can be interpreted as formed in result of the lowering of the 

seawater column pressure reduction and intensification of the fluid flux of methane-rich 

fluid and subsequent authigenic carbonate precipitation. 

The ages of the MDAC sub-samples are therefore associated with periods of rapid 

sealevel changes: rapid sealevel rises (such as the terminations 2 and 3) or the interstadial 



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 274 

to stadial progressive sealevel lowering periods. This shows that the direct pressure 

variation of the seawater column is not the predominant factor controlling the fluid flow of 

the methane-rich fluids from which the carbonates precipitated. Therefore, the sealevel 

variation and seawater pressure conceptual model for controlling the fluid flow intensity at 

the cold seeps can not be used to explain the formation of most of the samples. As the 

pressure effect is not the most significant effect on controlling fluid flow, it is proposed 

that temperature changes are the preferable forcing factor on fluid flow intensity. 

Glacial and interglacial changes induce changes in the MO intensity and the depth at 

which it flows at the seafloor (Faugèers et al., 1984; Llave et al., 2006; Voelker et al., 

2006). During globally cooler conditions, as during the glacial stages, the MO was denser 

and therefore the centres of the MO cores were located deeper than at present. On the other 

hand, during warm periods the MO was less dense, favouring an increased intensity of the 

MO on upper slope areas (Llave et al., 2006). Under present day conditions, corresponding 

to an interglacial stage, the sites where samples 3463-A03 and 3463-A08 were collected 

from are located under intense influence of the lower core of the MO (Figure 7.1). At 

present, the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) is thin (46 m for 100% methane gas 

hydrate) or even nonexistent (100% methane gas hydrate), considering the upper 

temperature values of 12ºC within the seasonal MO temperature variations. During glacial 

periods, it is proposed that the sampling sites are characterised by a weaker MO influence, 

or the MO position does not bath the sampling site locations. Therefore at these sites the 

seabottom water temperature and the temperature in the upper part of the sediment column 

should be inferior to the present day temperatures. The base of the GHSZ at the sampling 

sites during glacials should therefore be deeper than during the interglacial stages. Methane 

hydrates should therefore have stabilized and accumulated during glacial stages, when the 

MO had a weaker positive temperature influence at the sampling sites. At interglacial 

stages, especially at the glacial terminations, the MO rapidly increases its influence and the 

seafloor bottom water temperature and consequently the temperature in the upper 

sediments should increase, reducing the GHSZ and increasing gas hydrate dissociation, 

enhancing the methane-rich fluid flow at the top sedimentary column or even at the 

seafloor. Therefore, it is proposed that the MDAC precipitation is recording intense fluid 

flow episodes occurring during periods of higher temperature of the seabottom water and 

of the upper sediment column, as a result of greater influence of the MO at these sampling

 275

sites. This increase in seabottom water temperature is, most probably, causing changes on 

the gas hydrate stability zone, causing its reduction, leading to gas hydrate dissociation and 

to it consequent release of methane-rich fluids which will induce the carbonate 

precipitation along the fluid conduits on the fluid pathways above the methane seepage 

sites.

Figure 7.12. Ages of the two dolomite chimney samples projected over the ?18OSMOW estimated sealevel 

variation curve. The sealevel variation curve is based on the assumption that the global seawater ?18OSMOW 

variation resultant from glacial-interglacial ice volume change is of about 1‰ (Schrag et al., 1996; Duplessy 

et al., 2002) and that the entire sealevel scale is 125 m (Fairbanks and Matthews, 1978; Fairbanks, 1989). 

The plotted ?18O curve corresponds to the normalized “LR04” stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). The MIS 

ages and nomenclature are the ones defined by the SPECMAP, Martinson et al. (1987) and (Shackleton, 

2000). 

 

 

7.3.4 Potential controls on the ?18O signal in the chimneys 

The oxygen isotopic composition of the MDAC depends mainly on the mineralogy 

of the carbonate, the temperature of formation and on the isotopic composition of the fluids 

from which the carbonates precipitated from. Salinity and pH have minor effects, neglected 

in this discussion. 

The analysed chimney samples are composed of a mixture of different carbonate 

phases where either calcite or dolomite is dominant (Table 7.2). In order to reconstruct the

temperature and the ?18O composition of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates 

precipitated, it is necessary to calculate the isotopic composition of the different carbonate 

phases. Therefore, the bulk isotopic composition of the sub-samples were plotted as a 

function of their mineral content, and the isotopic composition of the pure calcite and 

dolomite were extrapolated using the correlation trend line calculated from a group of 

samples leached with EDTA, which allowed the total dissolution of the calcite and Mg-

calcite phases until obtaining and analyse of the pure dolomite phase (Figure 6.10, in 

chapter 6). This allowed the estimation of the isotopic composition of the calcite and 

dolomite phases, as shown in Table 7.3 and in Figure 7.13. 

Considering the present day bottom water temperature of 11ºC, as determined from 

nearby CTD data of the CANIGO project (Figure 7.1), and the bottom water oxygen 

isotopic composition ranging from 0.6 to 0.7‰ SMOW at site SWIM04-42, at 35.88ºN; 

7.53ºW (Voelker, 2005, Personal Communication), the expected isotopic composition of 

calcite should range from 1.19 to 1.29‰ VPDB, and dolomite should vary between 4.24 

and 4.34‰ VPDB (Table 7.3), according to the Kim and O'Neil (1997) fractionation 

equation for calcite and the Vasconcelos et al. (2005) equation for dolomite. In sample 

3463-A03, the estimated isotopic composition of calcite is enriched in 18O (0.43‰ up to 

0.76‰ VPDB) relative to their expected modern conditions, while dolomite is 1.61 up to 

1.94‰ VPDB enriched in 18O relative to their expected modern conditions. In sample 

3463-A08, the estimated isotopic composition of calcite and dolomite are more depleted in 
18O than expected for modern conditions. Calcite shows estimated values ranging from -

0.58 to 0.05‰ VPDB, corresponding to a depletion of up to 1.87‰ VPDB, while dolomite 

shows estimated values ranging from 3.65 to 4.28‰ VPDB, corresponding to a depletion 

in 18O up to 0.69‰ VPDB. These significant discrepancies between the estimated isotopic 

compositions of the pure phases of calcite or dolomite and the theoretical values under 

modern temperature and bottom seawater isotopic compositions indicate that the 

temperature and isotopic compositions of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates 

precipitated are significantly different from the present day conditions.

The 18O composition of the fluids from which the authigenic carbonates precipitated, 

were estimated for the temperature range of 4 ºC to 14ºC, which corresponds to the values 

that are the estimated temperature range considered to be possible to occur between 

extreme glacial-interglacial settings at the locations from which the authigenic carbonates 

were collected from. The estimated fluid composition for the different temperatures is 

shown in Table 7.6 and Figure 7.14. Seawater ?18OSMOW changes are a consequence of the 

glacial-interglacial cyclicity, as evidenced by the ?18O LR04 curve (Figure 7.12 and Figure 

7.14). The exact value for the ?18O difference between glacial and interglacial periods is 

still under discussion, but estimates of the deep ocean water ?18O between the Last Glacial 

Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene (MIS1) points to a value of about 1.05‰ (Duplessy et 

al., 2002). Although this 1.05‰ variation does not necessary apply for all the MIS, 

especially in the Gulf of Cadiz where the presence of the Mediterranean water can 

introduce significant variations on the bottom seawater ?18O composition, it is considered 

as a good approximation to the true value.

7.3.4.1 Sample 3463-A03 

In sample 3463-A03, the pure calcite and dolomite phases are estimated to 

precipitate from fluids that are significantly enriched in 18O compared to the expected 

composition of the seawater for the corresponding MIS (Table 7.6 and Figure 7.14). In 

Figure 7.14 the estimated fluid compositions are shifted towards heavier 18O values than 

the predicted by the ?18O LR04 curve. Sub-sample 8 indicates precipitation from fluids 

enriched in 18O (from 0.68‰ SMOW at 8ºC up to 2.02‰ SMOW, at 14ºC for calcite and 

from 0.8‰ SMOW at 4ºC up to 3.24‰ SMOW at 14ºC for dolomite). Calcite precipitation 

close to expected seawater composition is obtained with a precipitation temperature of 4ºC. 

However, temperatures higher than 8ºC are thought to be more plausible at these water 

depths for the correspondent sub-sample age. The estimated fluid composition values are 

too heavy (for 8ºC, more than 1.2‰ SMOW heavier than the present day 0.6‰ SMOW 

seawater isotopic composition) to be explained by glacial-interglacial fluctuation of the 

seawater ?18O composition alone. Therefore these isotopic values are interpreted as 

including a significant contribution of heavier isotopic water resulting, most probably, 

from the destabilization of gas hydrates. Sub-samples 6 and 7 also indicate heavier isotopic 

composition of the fluids from which the authigenic dolomite precipitated, although this 

enrichment is not as significant as in sub-sample 8. 

The precipitation of calcite can be explained by formation at a temperature of 4 to 

8ºC in sub-samples 6 and 7 i.e. at a temperature range close to the present day values (8 to 

12ºC). The dolomite estimated fluid composition indicates heavier 18O fluid composition 

or significantly lower temperature of precipitation (less than 4ºC for sub-sample 7, and 

between 4 and 8ºC for sub-sample 6). Considering the glacial-interglacial relative age of 

the sub-samples, it should be expected for sample 8 the highest temperature of 

precipitation and for sample 6 the lowest temperature of precipitation, as illustrated in 

Figure 7.14 (where the temperatures of precipitation considering a constant ?18O fluid 

composition value of 0.6‰ SMOW are plotted in magenta open circles for calcite and X 

symbols for dolomite). Sub-sample 8 however corresponds to the lowest estimated 

temperatures of precipitation (7.65ºC for calcite and 3.24ºC for dolomite) while sub-

sample 6 corresponds to the highest temperature of formation (8.65ºC for calcite and 

4.10ºC for dolomite). At the location where the samples were collected, the MO intensity is 

expected to be higher during the interglacial periods and weaker during glacials (as 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 279

discussed before). Therefore, the calculated relative temperatures are in opposite phase to 

those expected from the glacial-interglacial timing and the consecutive MO intensity. It is 

therefore interpreted that the predominant factor that is being reflected in the isotopic 

composition of the authigenic carbonates is the variation in the isotopic composition of the 

fluids from which the carbonates precipitated. 

If one considers the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates from a constant fluid 

isotopic composition, then the authigenic calcite and dolomite compositions have to be 

explained by temperature variations. The estimated temperature of formation of the several 

sub-samples (plotted in Figure 7.14) indicates a variation that is not in agreement with the 

expected variation correspondent to the different MIS. Also the temperature amplitudes 

between the sub-samples (from 0.86ºC up to 1.0ºC) are much lower than the temperature 

amplitudes that would be expected from the very different formation stages of the sub-

samples. These low temperature amplitudes are interpreted instead as reflecting a relatively 

constant temperature of the seeping fluids and that the oxygen isotopic variability of the 

authigenic calcite and dolomite preferentially reflects variations in the source fluid 18O 

composition, instead of temperature variations. 

It should be noted that, while the different sub-samples from sample 3463-A03 

correspond to a large time range (88 to 221 ka), corresponding to different MIS and to 

significant variability in the seawater ?18O composition, the isotopic values of the 

authigenic carbonates have relatively constant composition values. This is interpreted as 

reflecting a similar fluid composition that is not significantly controlled by the glacial-

interglacial seawater isotopic variability but, most probably is mainly constrained by the 

pore water and seepage fluid compositions. As such, this sample seems to exhibit a 

contribution from pore waters resulting from dissolution of gas hydrates.

7.3.4.2 Sample 3463-A08 

In sample 3463-A08, the authigenic calcite and dolomite are estimated to precipitate 

from fluids significantly depleted in 18O relative to the expected composition of seawater at 

the corresponding MIS seawater composition (Table 7.6 and Figure 7.14). All sub-samples 

(1-5) indicate calcite precipitation from fluids depleted in 18O (from -2.77‰ SMOW at 4ºC 

up to 0.12‰ SMOW at 14ºC). For dolomite, the estimated fluid composition is heavier 

than the estimated fluid composition for calcite. This can be explained by a contribution 

from the detrital calcite fraction from the calcareous microfossils that should have a 

isotopic oxygen source distinct from the methane-derived authigenic calcite, or could 

indicate a slightly different fluid composition or a different temperature during the 

formation of the various authigenic carbonate phases (as already discussed in chapter 6). 

The estimated composition of the fluids from which the dolomite precipitated indicates 

fluid compositions ranging from -1.72‰ SMOW at 4ºC up to 1.34‰ SMOW at 14 ºC. 

These values correspond to fluids with compositions close to the seawater value expected 

for the corresponding MIS period for the several sub-samples, with the exception of sub-

sample 1, which has a heavier isotopic fluid composition than the other sub-samples. 

Sample 3463-A08 does not therefore show a clear contribution from a heavier oxygen 

source, with the exception of dolomite from sub-sample 1; as such, the contribution from 

the dissociation of gas hydrates is not considered to be significant for the fluids from which 

this sample precipitated. Furthermore, it should be noted that all sub-samples in sample 

3463-A08 have similar ?18O compositions. The similar isotopic compositions of the 

authigenic calcite and dolomite (maximum difference of 0.63‰) also support their similar 

age values. This can also be interpreted as reflecting a major contribution from a methane 

rich fluid with a constant composition. The contribution from seawater source fluids is 

interpreted as being minor since the composition trend of the authigenic calcite and 

dolomite does not have any similarity with the expected seawater isotopic trend illustrated 

by the ?18O LR04 curve (Figure 7.14). 

If one considers the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates from a fluid with a 

constant isotopic composition (c.a. the present day 0.6‰ SMOW), then, in order to explain 

the calcite and dolomite ?18O compositions, the temperature of precipitation of the 

different sub-samples shows a variation that is not in agreement with the expected 

temperature variation correspondent to the MIS ages of the sub-samples. Temperature 



Chapter 7. U/Th Ages of dolomite chimneys from the Gulf of Cadiz: record of intense past fluid 
escape episodes 

 282 

amplitudes between the sub-samples (up to 2.65ºC for dolomite and up to 2.95ºC for 

calcite) would have to be considered to explain the authigenic calcite and dolomite 

compositions (Figure 7.14). As these temperature amplitudes are observed in sub-samples 

with very close ages, they are interpreted as being less probable to occur as a consequence 

of the glacial-interglacial variation during the correspondent short time span for this 

sample formation. These temperature amplitudes and the fact that they show a variation 

that is not in agreement with the one expected from the ages of the several sub-samples, 

are interpreted as indicating that the oxygen isotopic variability of the authigenic calcite 

and dolomite preferentially reflects variations in the fluid 18O compositions, instead of 

temperature variations. 

The amount of data available is not yet sufficient to support a robust refinement of 

the proposed inferences concerning the fluid isotopic composition and their source and 

formation temperature. Further investigation has to be carried out in order to better 

constrain the use of the MDAC as a proxy for the reconstruction of the seep fluids 

composition and formation temperatures. 

 

7.3.5 Formation model of the two chimneys 

The sample 3463-A03 that is characterized by high initial sediment porosity and high 

permeability it is proposed, according to the general formation model (as discussed in 

chapter 5), that this chimney will be formed by cementation resultant from the precipitation 

of authigenic carbonates as result of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with sulphate 

reduction, at the reaction front between a percolating fluid (gas or solution) enriched in 

methane and the in situ interstitial sulphate enriched pore waters. The percolated methane-

rich fluid would preferentially, for the case of sample 3463-A03, percolate trough the 

sediment along a percolation pathway of higher interstitial porosity, cementing the original 

sediments along this pathway, without the requisition of an open vent conduit, as the initial 

permeability of the sediments are high. Therefore, the lithification resulted on a completely 

cemented conduit, which would correspond (approximately), to the centre of conduit 1 

(Figure 7.7). Subsequent fluid flow episodes would kip using the same pathway but around 

this cemented hard nucleus. Therefore, this conduit would grow spreading out from the 

centre of conduit 1. If the cementation resulted in blocking of the fluid initial pathway, 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 283

latter fluid flow episodes have to fallow different pathways that would again form a 

cemented nucleus with the cementation grow spreading out from this second conduit. 

When the two conduits are closely spaced than the unification of both could occur. To be 

noted that, these two or even more parallel conduits, can be contemporary or subsequent, 

like it is the proposed for sample 3463-A03. The space between two parallel conduits can 

exhibit authigenic carbonate minerals corresponding to a mixture of the two fluid episodes 

and therefore ages that would correspond to a mixture or intermediate ages. 

The fluid pathways through out the sediments can be constrained and resulting from 

sedimentary discontinuities such as borrows. In fact many of the chimney samples 

resemble the shape and structure of many borrows and scavenger holes of many organisms 

where two parallel tubular holes are frequent. 

The sample 363-A08 corresponds to the lithification of clay rich sediments. The 

permeability of the initial sediment material would be reducen when compared to the 

material that composed the unconsolidated sediment of sample 3463-A03. It is proposed 

that the unconsolidated sediment of sample 3463-A08 would have low or reduced 

permeability and therefore the percolation of any fluids throughout these sediments would 

require that the fluid would form a vent conduit that had to be open for the methane-rich 

fluid percolation. Therefore the AOM-SR reaction front and the precipitation of the 

authigenic cement would occur spreading out from the methane-rich fluid conduit, but 

would occur in a single episode and within an unique event, as indicated by the ages 

obtained from this sample. The precipitation would occur as long far as the AOM-SR 

reaction front would be able to progress away from the open vent conduit, into the sulphate 

zone. Once the cementation reach a complete cementation of the open vent conduit walls, 

it would block the laterally methane percolation and therefore the AOM-SR reaction would 

cessed. Therefore open vent chimneys would correspond to a single cemented episode. 

Subsequent episodes of fluid flow could induce the cement formation within the open vent 

conduit if the environment inside the conduit would go through a previous episode of 

refilling with sulphate that would feed new episode of AOM-SR reaction. This would 

result in chimneys with a concentric grow layers, having a younger core and an older 

periphery.

escape episodes 

 284 

7.4 Conclusions 

 

The estimated ages of the two dolomite chimneys analysed indicate that the 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurs, from the centre or axis of the chimney to 

the periphery, during short intervals of time and the chimneys can growth during several 

discontinuous episodes, probably with longer periods with absence of precipitation. The 

chimneys that result from the precipitation during different episodes will be most probably 

evidence different grow layers or concentric rings. 

The estimated ages of the sub-samples indicate formation at periods of rapid 

paleoclimatic changes. The samples point to precipitation during (1) the onsets of 

terminations 2 and 3, contemporary with rapid sealevel rises; (2) at the transition from 

stadial to interstadial, also corresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition 

from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to stadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, 

associated with periods of progressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12). 

It is proposed that the MDAC precipitation are recording intense fluid flow episodes 

during periods of increased seabottom water temperature as a result of the increase of the 

MO influence at the locations where the samples were collected from. This increase in 

seabottom water temperature is, most probably, reducing the gas hydrate stability zone, 

leading to gas hydrate dissociation and consequent release of methane-rich fluids which 

will induce the carbonate precipitation along the fluid conduits on the fluid pathways 

above the methane seepage sites. 

Estimated compositions of the fluids from which the authigenic precipitated indicate 

for sample 3463-A03 a precipitation from fluids that are significantly enriched in 18O 

compared to the expected composition of the seawater for the correspondent MIS. These 

isotopic values are interpreted as including a significant contribution of heavier isotopic 

water resulting, most probably, from the destabilization of gas hydrates. Sample 3463-A08, 

however, does not indicate a similar evolution; its precipitation is compatible with the 

expected correspondent MIS fluid isotopic composition.

mediation in the formation of MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz  

 

 

8.1 Introduction 

 

As described in detail in Chapter 5, two main lithologic types of MDAC were 

identified in the collected samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: (1) dolomite-dominated 

carbonates; and (2) aragonite-dominated carbonates. The dolomite-dominated carbonates 

form crusts, irregular massive or nodular aggregates, and chimneys (fluid conduits or filled 

burrows). The dolomite samples have been found along the Guadalquivir diapiric ridge 

(GDR), the Formoza Ridge, the Cadiz and the Guadalquivir Channels, in the 

Mediterranean Outflow (MO) channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, in the Pen Duick and 

Vernadsky ridges, in the Iberico mud cone, and in the Faro, Hesperides, Student and Yuma 

mud volcanoes (Magalhães et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Magalhães et al., 

2005b). The aragonitic pavements form crusts or slabs that pave the seafloor for several 

square meters or form buildups and irregular blocks, up to 2 m high, at the seabottom. 

They have been found in the Pen Duick and Vernadsky ridges, within the Cadiz Channel, 

and also associated with several mud volcanoes: Porto, Jesus Baraza, Yuma, Ginsburg, 

Darwin, Shauen, Kidd, Mercator, Fiuza, Faro, Hesperides and Meknes (Figure 8.1). 

As discussed in Chapters 5, 6 and 7, the formation of some of these MDAC in the 

Gulf of Cadiz is related to episodes of enhanced fluid seepage, at least during the last 250 

ka, and some of them are related to episodes of gas hydrate formation and dissociation. 

The precipitation of these authigenic carbonates (as described in Chapter 5), is 

similar to that described for modern environments throughout the world’s oceans, at a 

variety of depths, associated with hydrocarbon seepage (e.g. Kulm et al., 1986; Hovland et 

al., 1987; Ritger et al., 1987; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Paull et al., 

1992; Aharon, 1994; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 1999; Aloisi et al., 2000; 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 286 

Elvert et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2000; Greinert et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 2002; 

Greinert et al., 2002; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003). Their formation is assigned to the sulphate 

reduction zone or to the transition between the sulphate reduction zone and the 

methanogenic zone, where microbial sulphate reduction (SR) is coupled with anaerobic 

oxidation of methane (AOM) (Ritger et al., 1987; Paull et al., 1992; Hoehler et al., 1994) 

according to the Reeburgh (1980) net equation (see Chapter 5). As a by-product of AOM, 

bicarbonate is produced with a consequent increase of the pore water fluid alkalinity, 

promoting the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates. AOM is a microbial-mediated 

process performed by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing 

bacteria (SRB), occurring in anoxic environments, where sulphate is used as electron 

receptor (Hoehler et al., 1994; Hinrichs et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 

2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Orphan et al., 2001b). The evidences for 

this process, as described for several modern cold seeps and gas hydrate occurrences, 

derive from archaeal biomarkers, such as Crocetane 2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane (e.g. 

Thiel et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et 

al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel et al., 

2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et 

al., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), PMI (2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane) and PMI? (e.g. 

Thiel et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et 

al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel et al., 

2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et 

al., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), Squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane) and 

squalenes (Elvert et al., 2000), that can have an archaeal source or can have a bacterial 

origin, Archaeol (2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) (e.g. Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 

2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; 

Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2004; Pancost et al., 

2005), Hydroxyarchaeol (2-O-3-hydroxyphytanyl-3-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol) (e.g. Boetius 

et al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001b; Hinrichs and 

Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2004; Pancost et al., 2005), and 

Biphytanyl tetraethers (Thiel et al., 1999; Pancost et al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2001b; Thiel 

et al., 2001a; Thiel et al., 2001b; Michaelis et al., 2002; Pancost et al., 2005). All these

archaeal biomarkers are characterized by extremely negative ?13C values (less than -100‰ 

VPDB).

are highlighted with open blue circles. Black triangles indicate the location of known mud volcanoes. 

 

Biomarkers for SRB are frequently identified associated with the archaeal 

biomarkers (Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000). Amongst these, alkyl diethers, 12-methyl-

tetradecanoic acid, Mono- and dialkyl-glycerolethers (non isoprenoidal), n-, mono-methyl 

(i-, ai-, mid-chain), N-cyclohexyl and cyclopropyl carbon chains (e.g. Hinrichs et al., 2000; 

Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 2001a; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Michaelis et al., 

2002; Werne et al., 2004), and ester-bound fatty acids, such as n-, mono-methyl (i-, ai-, 

mid-chain), N-cyclohexyl, and cyclopropyl carbon chains are frequent (e.g. Boetius et al., 

2000; Hinrichs et al., 2000; Pancost et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pancost et al., 

2001a; Thiel et al., 2001a; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Werne et al., 2004). 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the

In active cold seep sediments, genetic analysis shows that the observed archaea 

belong to either the clusters of AMNE-1 and AMNE-2, or those of the 

Methanomicrobiales/Methanosarcinales (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Hinrichs and Boetius, 

2002). The SRB are interpreted as most probably belonging to the 

Desulfocsarcina/Desulfococcus group (Michaelis et al., 2002). Direct morphological 

evidences of microbes at cold seeps have been shown via epifluorescence microscopy 

(Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001b) and in situ field surveys of putative Beggiatoa 

mats (Michaelis et al., 2002). 

In ancient methane seep deposits, evidences of past microbial activity include 

geochemical and biomarker signatures as well as morphologic evidences. The geochemical 

evidences for microbial involvement in the authigenic carbonate formation as a result of 

AOM include the association of authigenic carbonates with isotopic negative 13C values 

associated with pyrite (Cavagna et al., 1999; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 

2002). Biomarkers indicative of archaea and their diagenetic products, such as PMI and 

C30 acyclic isoprenoids, are frequently associated with fossil hydrocarbon seep deposits 

(Peckmann et al., 1999a). Morphologic signatures of microbial activity include the 

presence of early non-detrital micrite, thinly laminated micrite, micrite diffusive peloids 

with 0.1-1 mm in diameter (Campbell et al., 2002), dumbbell-shaped crystal bundles (Van 

Lith et al., 2003), laminated sediments, hollow dolomite crystals, dolomitic tubes with 15 

µm in diameter, cylindrical aggregates of framboidal pyrite with diameters of about 100 

µm (Cavagna et al., 1999), dumbbell morphologies and body fossils of clotted 

microfabrics (Peckmann et al., 2002), pinnate bacteria with 0.3 µm in diameter and 1-1.5 

µm long, sheaths with 2-4 µm in diameter or clusters of coccoids, up to 40 per cluster and 

each with 0.5-1 µm in diameter (Shapiro, 2004). 

A significant number of the MDAC occurrences in the Gulf of Cadiz are dolomite-

dominated and occur in extensive areas of hundreds of square meters at the seafloor 

(Chapter 4). The study of these authigenic dolomite samples can bring new contributions to 

the dolomite problem, by evaluating if these samples support the so-called microbial 

factor, which proposes that microbial activity has an important role mediating the 

precipitation of dolomite under normal temperature conditions (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; 

Warthmann et al., 2000).

This chapter focuses on the microbial component of the MDAC from the Gulf of 

Cadiz, based on the petrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and biomarker 

evidences of microbial activity preserved in these MDAC. The aragonite pavements are 

considered to represent very recent or present day formation of authigenic carbonates 

(Chapter 5), whereas the dolomite chimneys probably represent older formation episodes 

over a period spanning at least from 89 ka until 250 ka (see Chapter 7). The analysis of the 

different preserved microbial evidences can be used to track the degradation of the 

microbial signatures through time. 

In order to attain these objectives, specific lipid biomarkers analyses were carried out 

at the Marine Biogeochemistry Laboratory of the Research Center for Ocean Margins 

(RCOM), of the Bremen University (Magalhães et al., 2005a). SEM observations were 

carried out at the ETH Centre (Zurich) and in the University of Aveiro, together with 

petrographic observations, in order to investigate morphological evidences of the microbial 

activity. 

 

8.2 Materials and Methods 

 

The samples selected for identification of microbial evidences were chosen based on 

the best preservation potential of their organic content. Petrographic analysis was carried 

out on hand specimens and in thin sections with binocular microscope, petrographic 

microscope and cathodoluminescence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 

biomarker analysis were also performed in selected samples (listed in Table 8.1). The 

chimneys were selected based on their degree of oxidation. Because the oxidation is a 

secondary process that occurs after the exhumation of the samples from the sediments and 

because the oxidation will have a strong effect on the degradation of organic compounds, 

only the samples with none or with weak signs of oxidation were selected. Amongst these, 

samples 3463-A08 and 3722-A33 were selected (+ amostras da Luisa) (Figure 8.2), 

because they are compact, very homogeneous, massive, with no fractures, and do not show 

significant signs of alteration, and therefore have lower probabilities of being 

contaminated. Aragonite pavement samples were also selected in order to represent the 

different lithologic types and to obtain the best organic matter preservation. As such, only

aragonite pavement samples with weaker or no signs of oxidation were selected.

oxidation. Sample 3722-A33 (ANA00-DA10.33): dolomite chimney with weak signs of oxidation in the 
internal chimney material. To avoid the oxidation fronts, sub-samples were collected by cutting a 7 cm thick 
slice in the internal, less oxidized area.

8.2.1 Petrography, SEM and EDS 

The samples used for this study were cut in 7 cm thick slices, from which thin 

sections were prepared in three perpendicular planes. The chimney samples were cut 

parallel and perpendicular to the chimney axis. 

SEM and energy dispersive spectrometer X-ray elementary analysis (EDS) were 

performed on slices cut from the samples, in which the external and the existing friable 

material or material containing penetrative fractures was removed. From these slices, chips 

with 1x1x5 cm were cut and cleaned in distilled water in an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 

minutes. Then, the samples were etched in 1% HCl for 1 minute. After etching, the 

samples were rinsed in distilled water and immediately dried on a warm furnace (at 45ºC), 

and gold or carbon coated. After coating the samples were kept isolated in a desiccator to 

avoid contamination. They were analysed on a Hitachi S4100 scanning electron 

microscope, operating at 15 kV and equipped with a backscattered electron detector 

(Rontec Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer system, series M) with a window for light 

elements. All photomicrographs are secondary electron imaging scans at varying working 

distances. The SEM-EDS analyses were performed both at ETH in Zurich, and in the 

Ceramics Department of the University of Aveiro. 

 

8.2.2 Lipid Biomarkers 

8.2.2.1 Sample preparation 

The aragonite pavements are considered to represent a more recent carbonate 

generation than the dolomite chimneys. Previous studies (Duarte, 2005; Niemann et al., 

2005; Niemann et al., 2006) have already shown that the biomarker indicators are very 

abundant in this type of samples. Sample 3340 (Figure 8.2) was selected because it shows 

no signs of oxidation. From this aragonite pavement sample, 20 g of material was collected 

and prepared for biomarker extraction. As concerns the dolomite chimneys, 250 g of 

material was collected and prepared for biomarker extraction by fragmenting to small 5 cm 

thick slices from samples 3458-B11, TTR14-566Gr, TTR15-599D.B01, TTR15-

599D.C02, TTR15-599D.D02, 3463-A08 and 3722-A33 (Figure 8.2), avoiding the 

periphery and fractured parts of the samples that can act as contamination sources. 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 293

The sample preparation procedure used for extraction and purification of the lipid 

biomarkers was based on the method of Peckmann et al. (2004). The analytical 

methodology used for the dolomite chimney samples is described in the flowchart of 

Figure D.2, Appendix D and the one used for the aragonite pavements is shown in the 

flowchart of Figure D.1, Appendix D. 

8.2.2.2 Analytical procedure 

The freshly broken carbonate samples were decalcified (HCl) and the dried residue 

was refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). The supernatant was 

decanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication in CH2Cl2/CH3OH 

(3:1; v:v) until the solvent became colourless. Subsequently, the combined supernatants 

were portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total extract was dried and 

separated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, 

length: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml or 3 column volumes of 

n-hexane); (2) esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) alcohol (20 ml of 

CH2Cl2/aceton 9:1; and (4) fatty acids/polars (20 ml of MeOH). The esters/ketones and 

alcohol fractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and BSTFA (2:1) at 70ºC (1 h). 

The polar fractions/fatty acids were dried and transesterificated with boron-trifluoride 

methanol and then with KCl + hexane. The internal standard used for all fractions was 

Cholestane. A modification of the method, which involved a previous extraction with 

CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) prior to decalcification, proved to be efficient in cleaning dirt 

peaks on the dolomite samples. 

8.2.2.3 Gas chromatography and coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 

The hydrocarbon fraction was examined by combined gas chromatography-mass 

spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Varian CP-3800 GC/Saturn 2000 MS EI-mode, 70eV) 

equipped with a 30 m fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 8 CB Low Bleed, 0.25mm ID, 

0.25 µm film thickness). The carrier gas was He. The GC-temperature program used was: 

injection at 80ºC, 5 min isothermal; from 80ºC to 310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 20 min isothermal. 

The identification of the organic compounds was based on comparison of the mass spectra 

and the GC retention times with those of published data and reference compounds. 

Coupled GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was conducted using a 

Finnigan DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer equipped with a HP6890GC and CuO/Ni/Pt 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 294 

combustion furnace operated at 940ºC. Samples were injected splitless (1 min) onto a 30 m 

fused silica column (DB5-MS, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) using a Gerstel 

Cooled Injection System (CIS4) programmed from 48ºC (0 min) to 310ºC (10 min) at 12ºC 

sec-1. The carrier gas was He. The GC temperature program used was: 3 min at 80ºC; from 

80ºC to 310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 30 min at 310ºC. The GC-C-IRMS precision was checked 

using a standard alkane mix (n-C15 to n-C29) with known isotopic composition. The stable 

carbon isotope compositions are reported in the delta notation (?13C) vs. the VPDB 

Standard. 

 

8.3 Results 

8.3.1 Petrographic and SEM evidences of bacterial activity 

Although the organic remains of micro-organisms are not expected to be preserved in 

ancient microbial carbonates (Stolz et al., 2001), because the organic compounds probably 

degrade very fast, especially in oxidizing conditions, evidences of microbial origin are 

expected to be preserved mainly as morphological structures. While the morphology and 

the mineralogy of particles larger than 10 µm are not expected to reveal microbial induced 

characteristics (Knorre and Krumbein, 2000), embedded microbes and particles with 

shapes similar to bacteria and which are only slightly larger than bacteria are interpreted as 

evidence that microbes were present when the carbonate formed. Whether the microbes 

just happened to be there or whether they actually induced the carbonate precipitation 

cannot be undoubtedly inferred from the morphological observations. However, if the 

corresponding sediment environmental physico-chemical conditions are suitable for 

microbial activity and if these appropriated microbial communities are proven to be 

involved in the carbonate precipitation, it is plausible to assume that these microbial 

evidences represent the direct involvement of those microbes in the carbonate formation. 

Indeed, it has been proposed that the microbes can induce an increase in carbonate 

alkalinity that will result in carbonate precipitation (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Boetius et 

al., 2000; Castanier et al., 2000; Folk and Chafetz, 2000; Knorre and Krumbein, 2000; 

Warthmann et al., 2000; Hinrichs and Boetius, 2002; Van Lith et al., 2003) and therefore 

they can function as nucleation sites (Knorre and Krumbein, 2000; Van Lith et al., 2003). 

In this chapter, will be described many morphological evidences of microbial activity

found in the MDAC samples, such as peloid-like structures, filamentous structures and 

smaller scale features. 

 

8.3.1.1 Dolomite chimneys 

Mineralogy and textural characterization 

As described in Chapter 5, the dolomite crusts, nodules and chimneys consist 

essentially of medium to tightly carbonate-cemented mudstones, siltstones, wackestones 

and sandstones (Figure 8.3 and Figure 8.4). The detrital fraction corresponds to a 

fossiliferous matrix with abundant bioclasts of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, 

ostracods, pellets and silty terrigenous grains of quartz, calcite, feldspars, apatite, zircon 

and clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in almost all the samples, 

staining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the degree of oxidation of the 

sample. This is illustrated as example in Figure 8.3E, a thin section microphotograph of a 

transversal slice from a 3 cm thick chimney, showing the iron oxidation pervasive coating 

progressing from the exterior of the chimney (on the left of the image) and from their 

centre. 

On non oxidized samples or with a weak oxidation degree it is possible to recognize 

authigenic pyrite, occurring as singular pyrite framboids&amp;lt;20 µm (Figure 8.6), as 

framboidal aggregates&amp;lt;200 µm (Figure 8.7B and C) isolated or forming groups, small 

pyrite grains (&lt;5 µm in size) isolated or forming clusters (Figure 8.3E and Figure 8.7A-C), 

and as euhedral pyrite single crystals (Figure 8.7B). Frequently, pyrite shows oxidation 

rims of brownish iron oxides probably containing OH-groups. Pyrite also occurs infilling 

foraminifera and other bioclasts chambers (Figure 8.3F); speckled on peloids (Figure 8.7A-

C), generally associated with organic matter; disseminated in the carbonate matrix (Figure 

8.7B-C); or filling inter-clast porosity. Sulphur isotopic compositions of the pyrite show 

negative ?34S values (-34‰ CDT) (González et al., 2006a, b). The presence of pyrite and 

their ?34S values indicate sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting the sulphide 

precipitation in anoxic sediment conditions. Pyrite replacement by Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxides 

(goethite and others) is observed and is frequent on samples with high oxidation intensity 

(Figure 8.3E-F and Figure 8.7D-F).

bioclasts and terrigenous detritus, is cemented by a micrite to micro-spar carbonate cement with a peloidal

shows a clotted microfabric (cm) where peloidal-like structures (p) are identified. Pyrite (py), some times 

replaced by oxy-hydroxides, occurs speckled in the clotted micrite cement and within bioclasts (b) of 

foraminifera tests. All microphotographs are in plane-polarized light except for image D which is in crossed-

polarized light.

chimneys and nodules show low porosity, with absence of mega-porous and scarce 

fractures or cracks. The contacts between the cemented grains are irregular, ranging from 

complete to inter-grain pore spaces with dimensions lower than 10 µm, leaving little 

residual porosity. The cement is composed of micrite to micro-sparite equigranular 

rhombohedric calcite, high Mg-calcite, protodolomite and dolomite with dimensions in the 

range of 2-10 µm (Figure 8.4 and Figure 8.5). The texture varies from isolated 

rhombohedra and aggregates of interlocking sub-euhedral to euhedral crystals, sometimes 

exhibiting serrated crystal faces. More rarely the cement carbonates show sub-round 

shapes with sizes &amp;lt;0.5 µm (Figure 8.3F). The contacts between detrital grains and the 

cement are dictated by the shape of the detrital grain. The carbonates are not observed 

dissolving or replacing the detrital grains. EDS chemical analysis of the dolomite crystals 

indicate Ca and Mg as the dominant constituents. Fe is also frequently identified on the 

EDS chemical analysis, with a proportion that is in general inferior to 5% on point analysis 

performed on single cement crystals. Analyses performed over scanned areas show larger 

relative abundance of Fe, even when performed on dolomite crystals. This is interpreted as 

a consequence of the pervasive existence of iron oxy-hydroxides over most of the sample 

material (Figure 8.5). Although dolomite can contain Fe in its crystallographic structure, 

the analysed samples showed Mg:Fe &gt; 4, and therefore are not interpreted as being 

ankerite. In general, the cement crystals have non-estechiometric compositions and show 

an excess of Ca relative to the Mg; consequently a continuous of carbonate phases with 

compositions ranging from dolomite, protodolomite and high Mg-calcite through calcite 

can be observed in the authigenic cement (this is also evidenced by the X-ray diffraction 

data, as discussed in Chapter 5). 

All the cement minerals seem to be paragenetic. Cathodoluminescence does not 

reveal different generations in the micrite cement nor any compositional variability within 

the crystals. The cement exhibits non-luminescence dull to medium orange to brownish red 

colours. 

Neither on the SEM observations nor in the petrographic observations, was it 

possible to recognise any signs of calcite dissolution, or calcite replacement by dolomite. 

Therefore, the cement dolomite, protodolomite, calcite and the high Mg-calcites are 

considered to be primary authigenic mineralogy.

The typical fabric of the dolomite chimneys includes the intrapelbiomicritic and 

pelmicrite which are diagnostic of a biotic origin and show equivalent characteristics to 

other methane seep cements described in several other places and in ancient seep deposits 

(Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002). 

Peloidal and clotted microfabrics 

The cement of the dolomite chimney samples frequently show peloids, peloid-like 

allochems and clotted microfabric (Figure 8.7). The peloid-like structures have variable 

sizes, generally range from 10 to 300 µm in diameter, and are characterized, in thin section 

(Figure 8.7), by cloudy areas at their centres (clotted fabric) sometimes surrounded by a 

more clear exterior rims of micritic to micro-spar crystals of carbonate (calcite, high Mg-

calcite or dolomite) or by indistinct and diffuse margins. The peloids are frequently 

speckled by pyrite which, in some cases can be the dominant phase. Similar fabric is also 

found at the interior of foraminifera tests (Figure 8.3F and Figure 8.6). Frequently the 

peloid-like texture assumes non-rounded shapes and can form irregular areas of the cement 

covering large extensions of the interganular space (Figure 8.7). As the peloids can occur 

between and within the detrital material and the bioclasts, and given the lack of indications 

of transportation of the peloids, the peloidal fabric is interpreted as having an in situ origin 

and not as of fecal origin. The space between the peloidal clots is predominantly filled by 

micritic to micro-spar carbonate cement, and the cores of the peloids are composed of 

submicron to micron-sized anhedral carbonate grains. In thin section, the peloids display 

light brownish grey to dark colours and in cathodoluminescence they have non-

luminescent dull to medium colours, that are interpreted as indicating remains of organic 

matter. 

The peloids are therefore considered to represent bacterially induced precipitates 

where an association of micritic mineralogies, probably with more abundant microbial 

remains, composes the authigenic cement. Co-occurrence of pyrite within the peloids is 

frequent and indicates anaerobic conditions, where the organic compounds (most probably 

light hydrocarbons, such as methane) are anaerobically oxidized. The peloidal-like fabric 

of the dolomite chimneys, similar to the fabrics described in other active or fossil cold seep 

systems (Peckmann et al., 2002) are, interpreted here as representing clusters or fragments 

of clusters of higher concentrations of microbial consortia.

Microbial filaments 

Locally, high densities of unidentified filaments with diameters of about 0.5 µm and 

up to 100 µm long occur in the dolomite chimneys (Figure 8.8). These filaments form 

complex networks that appear to be cemented by the authigenic carbonate cement crystals 

(Figure 8.8C) and are therefore proposed to be contemporary of the carbonate cement 

formation and not as resulting from a later stage contamination. 

Linear clusters of small crystals with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 2-3 µm in diameter 

are also observed (Figure 8.9A-B). These structures are interpreted as being formed by 

calcification over filamentous structures (biomineralizations) since their size and shapes 

resemble bacterial morphologies. These calcified filaments are incorporated and 

surrounded by larger cement crystals and therefore are clearly contemporary to the cement 

precipitation (Figure 8.9B). Similar crystals clusters, not showing linear arrangements, are 

also observed on top of some larger crystals (Figure 8.9C). Individual crystals or sub-

spherical particles with less than 0.1 µm in diameter are also observed as being cemented 

and incorporated in the cement crystals as illustrated in (Figure 8.9D), where a fragment of 

a nanofossil appears to have been cemented and incorporated in a cemented crystal. 

Particles with shapes that possibly indicate a microbial origin 

Several other structures with a probable biogenic origin are also frequently observed 

on the dolomite chimney samples. 

Associated with the filaments agglomerates of cocci, straight and curved rod-shaped 

and sub-spherical carbonate phases are also frequently found (Figure 8.8A-B pinpointed by 

black arrows, Figure 8.10A-C and Figure 8.11A pinpointed by white arrows). The rods and 

sub-spherical structures have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1 µm in diameter and are less than 3 

µm long. Because of their simple morphology the cocci and rods are possibly of bacterial 

origin, as their size an shapes are compatible with the size and shapes of bacteria. The rod-

shapped agglomerates have very similar compositions to the calcitic micrite cement 

(Figure 8.10B and F) and the rods are locally being incorporated into the calcite cement 

crystals, as illustrated in Figure 8.10C and pinpointed by the arrows. It should be noted that 

these agglomerates of rod-shaped morphologies have a similar morphology to the radial 

structures illustrated in Figure 8.11B-E, but with significant differences. While the rods in 

the rod-shaped agglomerates have a random orientation, in the radial structures the rods are 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz

parallel and have a regular divergent distribution. The radial structures have diameters 

ranging from 10 to 20 µm and, similarly to the rod-shaped agglomerates, are interpreted as 

being biogenic in origin, although their nature is more difficult to determine. They can be 

sections of spicules or they can be bacterial in origin.

Linear filament structures with baton-shaped morphologies have also been identified 

on the dolomite chimney samples. As illustrated in Figure 8.12, these batons (pinpointed 

by the arrows) have a diameter of 0.1 to 0.2 µm, and are 1-2 µm long. Since they have 

bacterial equivalent sizes, they are interpreted as possible fossilised bacteria. Some of these 

batons are being incorporated into the cement carbonate crystals.

pointed by the white arrow in (C) is a cocolith disk. (D) detail of one of the baton structures. 

 

Several other globular and sub-spherical morphologies have also been observed on 

dolomite chimney samples. Globular morphologies that resemble dumbbells (illustrated in 

Figure 8.13A-B) 4-5 µm long, were observed as sub-spherical particles with a diameter of 

2-5 µm (Figure 8.13C-D). Fragments of tubular morphologies with 10 µm in diameter 

were also recognised (Figure 8.13E). 

It was also possible to identify morphologies that resemble twisted clotted surfaces 

or sheaths, 2-3 µm thick (Figure 8.13F), with globular grains, some of which are probably 

pyrite framboids (1-5 µm in diameter) being cemented on these sheaths. These clotted 

surfaces are probably calcified biofilms and some of the globular grains on their surface 

are bacterial rods being cemented into the sheaths.

on dolomite crystals. (Scale and acquisition parameters of pictures are shown in picture footnote). 

 

Over large euhedral cement crystal sub-rounded morphologies can be observed 

(Figure 8.14A-C) that, while speculative, can be biogenic in origin. Also difficult to 

interpret but also supporting a biogenic origin, these euhedral cement crystals are 

frequently found growing over a surface of sub-micron carbonate phase that cements the 

surface of some detrital grains. These carbonate surfaces have 2-4 µm thick and exhibit a 

micro-rugose texture. The euhedral crystals seem to being growing from this surface, 

which can be interpreted as a calcified biofilm. 

In some of these euhedral cement crystals with 2-3 µm in diameter are growing and 

incorporating sub-spherical agglomerates of euhedral crystals with 0.5 µm size and 

possibly pyrite framboids (Figure 8.15B)

8.3.1.2 Aragonite pavements 

Mineralogy and textural characterization 

Aragonite pavement samples, in hand-species, are porous and whitish, light brownish 

grey to dark grey. Their mineralogy is dominated by aragonite and calcite, cementing a 

detrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud breccia clasts, shell 

fragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. Aragonite crusts and pavements are 

in general tabular (as revealed by the retrieved samples and on the underwater video 

observations) or form irregular block like or buildups at the seafloor. Different lithologic 

types of aragonite pavements have been identified (see Chapter 5): (i) lithified mud 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 310 

volcano breccias; (ii) shell crusts; (iii) intraformational breccias; and (iv) lithified 

fragments of dolomite crusts and chimneys. Several of these sub-types can coexist at the 

same location and sometimes in the same sample. 

The aragonite pavement samples, as illustrated for example in Figure 8.16, are 

characterized by a complex variety of macro and micro fabrics that developed at different 

times and where is possible to identify primary and later minerals. Dissolution horizons are 

also found in these samples, in opposition to the fabric of the dolomite crusts and 

chimneys, where no dissolution surfaces where found. The dissolution surfaces of the 

aragonite pavements indicate oxidation-reduction changes in the geochemical environment 

during their formation. The different aragonite pavements are characterized by the 

presence of two carbonate cement phases: the peloidal and clotted microfabrics, and the 

botryoidal and fibrous stromatolitic microfabric.

surface and veins filled by pure aragonite cement (B) with botryoidal and stromatolitic layers (C).

Peloidal and clotted microfabrics 

The peloidal and clotted microfabrics correspond to the earliest stage cement phase. 

It consists of clotted micrite and pelmicrite cement, composed of micritic clots with calcite, 

high Mg-calcite and aragonite (pointed by cm in Figure 8.17). It is very similar to the 

fabric of the dolomite chimneys. This fabric is characterized by an abundant detrital 

component, in general dominated by bioclasts of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, 

ostracods and nonofossils, with silty terrigenous grains of quartz, calcite, feldspars, apatite, 

zircon and clays. Iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides are present in some samples, 

staining them with a variable brownish colour depending on the degree of oxidation of the 

sample; however, in general the aragonite pavements with no signs of oxidation are the 

most frequent. This microfabric is characterized by the abundance of peloidal-like clotts, as 

illustrated in Figure 8.19. The aragonitic and calcitic micritic clots have irregular shapes 

and sizes, and a cloudy internal texture. The size of most clots ranges from 50 to 500 µm in 

diameter. The clots form an important fraction of the carbonate cement and, in general, the 

space between the clots is filled by micrite to star aragonite and calcite cement, or by 

fibrous stromatolitic and botryoidal aragonite. Frequently, the interior of foraminifera 

bioclasts have similar clotted microfabric. In the clots and peloidal-like structures the 

occurrence of organic matter is interpreted to be significant. 

Authigenic pyrite is abundant in this fabric, occurring as isolated framboids with up 

to 30 µm in diameter, as framboidal aggregates (Figure 8.17) with up to 200 µm in 

diameter, or as individual euhedral crystals. Pyrite occurs with high density in the clots and 

in the peloidal-like structures and it also often completely infills some foraminifera shells 

(Figure 8.19C, E-F). Pyrite, most probably associated with organic matter, occurs 

frequently as forming layers at the margins of material with clotted micritic fabric and on 

top of which aragonite needles grow, forming botryoidal and stromatolithic layers (Figure 

8.17D and F pinpointed by the arrows). 

The clotted pelmicrite fabrics are interpreted as being biogenic (microbial) related 

fabric. 

Botryoidal and fibrous stromatolitic microfabric 

The botryoidal and isopachous fibrous stromatolitic microfabrics correspond to a 

later cementation stage by acicular (almost pure) aragonite that fills the pore spaces, 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 312 

fractures and open cracks, frequently forming botryoidal and stromatolitic layers (Figure 

8.17 and Figure 8.18).  

The botryoids are characterized by a radial texture of the aragonite needles (Figure 

8.20A-C). that can  have sizes ranging from 100 to 300 µm in length. They grow over the 

clotted micrite cement and fill in the open porosity and open voids. 

Fibrous stromatolitic microfabric characteristically occurs as infilling large porous, 

fractures and cavities. The stromatolitic microfabric is formed by isopachous aragonite 

needles, occurring as a single or as multiple layers that recover the cavities walls and form 

stromatolitic crusts. This microfabric is composed of almost pure aragonite and can have 

thicknesses of 100 µm up to 0.9 cm and can fill cavities and fractures with a thickness of 

up to 2-3 cm. The nature and characteristics of the stromatolitic cavities are discussed 

below. 

The stromatolitic layers, like the botryoidal fabric, represent a later cementation 

phase as they grow over the clotted micritic fabric, filling open spaces. In thin section, they 

frequently exhibit horizons or layers of clotted fabric within the aragonite needles layers or 

at the centre of the stromatolitic cavities (Figure 8.20C-F). These cloudy horizons are 

interpreted as possibly corresponding to levels with a high amount of organic content, 

probably corresponding to the calcified biofilms, such as the ones illustrated by SEM 

imagery on Figure 8.26.  

Chaotic fabrics, dissolution horizons and stromatolitic cavities 

Samples of intraformational breccias, characterized by a chaotic fabric produced by 

in situ brecciation, and samples of lithified fragments of dolomite crusts and chimneys, are 

both characterized by the presence of mega-clasts (up to 12 cm) cemented by the 

authigenic aragonite and calcite cement described above. As described in Chapter 5, the 

clasts of the intraformational breccias are interpreted as fragments of previous semi-

consolidated aragonite pavements that were fractured and later re-cemented. The 

fragmentation and the generation of the clasts can be interpreted as resulting from 

instability related to mud volcano activity, where episodes of mud breccia extrusion, gas 

and fluids emissions can fracture the aragonite pavements being formed close to the 

seafloor. Alternatively, gas hydrate formation and subsequent dissociation can also 

produce the fragmentation of the pavements, similar to the gas hydrate associated 

carbonates found in the Cascadia margin (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001). 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 313

The intraformational breccia clasts frequently show signs of dissolution and corroded 

edges (Figure 8.18D, E and F). This puts in evidence that after an episode of MDAC 

formation, changes in the geochemical environment happened, leading to carbonate 

dissolution. Possibly this is evidencing a phase of aerobic oxidation of methane that 

induces an increase in the pore water CO2 content and leads to the acidification of the pore 

waters leading to the dissolution conditions. After this episode, adequate conditions for 

anaerobic oxidation of methane occur, leading to a new episode of cementation of the 

mega-clasts by a new generation of authigenic carbonates. 

In general, the degree of authigenic carbonate cementation is not pervasive and inter-

granular pore spaces are frequent; therefore, the aragonite pavements exhibit, in general, 

high porosity. The aragonite pavement samples frequently have voids, fractures and open 

cracks that are recovered or totally filled by crusts or layers of stromatolitic and botryoidal 

aragonite microfabrics, described above and illustrated in Figure 8.16, Figure 8.17A, 

Figure 8.18A and Figure 8.20. These cavities frequently have sheet to lenses shapes, 

occurring parallel to the stratification or to the global planar shape of the pavement sample. 

They can have thicknesses ranging from 1 mm to 2-3 cm and can extent for more than 12 

cm in length. The shape of these voids and the subsequent aragonite layers resembles to the 

aspect of the gas hydrates chunks and layers that were recovered from mud volcanoes in 

the Gulf of Cadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Kenyon et 

al., 2006) and also from other settings (Suess et al., 1999; Suess et al., 2001). Therefore 

the stromatolitic and botryoidal aragonite fabrics are interpreted as the remains of lenses of 

gas hydrates layers that grow within the sediments, occurring as planar layers parallel to 

the stratification of the sediments as also suggested for similar sample fabrics (Bohrmann 

et al., 1998). After the dissociation of these gas hydrate layers, their morphology is 

registered by the layers of almost pure aragonite illustrated in Figure 8.16. 

The pelmicrite and intrapelsparite, with clotted cement fabric and aragonite 

botryoids, isopachous needles and stromatolitic layers or crusts observed in the aragonite 

pavements from the Gulf of Cadiz are also typical of other active and fossil methane seeps 

(Savard et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 1998; Campbell et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 

2002; Shapiro, 2002; Shapiro, 2004).

frequently observed by SEM within the aragonite pavement cements (Figure 8.23). Two 

distinct types of filaments can be identified: (1) strait linear filaments with a very smooth 

external surface, illustrated in Figure 8.23E-G, very similar to the filaments observed on 

the dolomitic crusts and chimney samples (8.3.1.1: Microbial filaments); and (2) sinuous 

filaments that have curve shapes and a more rough (unpolished) exterior (Figure 8.23A-D), 

some of then seam to being calcified, cemented and incorporated by the authigenic cement 

(Figure 8.23H). Some of these sinuous filaments are boll capped filaments or exhibit boll 

caps or coccoids (with &amp;lt;1 µm in diameter) over them. Because the filaments, in particular 

the sinuous filaments have shapes and sizes similar to bacteria and are similar to the 

fossilized bacteria filaments enclosed in several modern seep carbonates (Peckmann et al., 

2001b; Shapiro, 2004; Reitner et al., 2005), they are interpreted as fossilized microbial 

filaments. The microbial filaments can occur isolated between the aragonite fibers or as 

denser clusters, such as that in Figure 8.23H. 

It was also possible to identify some open tubular structures, such as the one 

illustrated in Figure 8.24A with a similar diameter to the microbial filaments (of about 1 

µm). Tubular holes with larger diameters of 3 to 5 µm are also frequently observed, which 

are interpreted as scavenger holes by unidentified organisms (Figure 8.24B-D). 

Individual coccoids or boll caps are spherical to sub-spherical structures with 0.5-1 

µm in diameter that occur isolated, associated with filaments or forming coccoid clusters. 

While many different processes, including abiogenic processes, can be considered to 

explain the formation of the spherical structures, their sizes are equivalent to the sizes of 

modern bacteria and archaea (Boetius et al., 2000); their occurrence, associated with 

microbial filaments and biofilms, and their EDS chemical composition with higher carbon 

content, compared with the involved carbonate cement, suggests a biogenic origin for the 

coccoids.

Biofilms 

Between the aragonite needles of the zoned isopachous stromatolitic cement layers 

and the botryoidal aragonite, especially at the centre of the cavities, biofilms and biomucos 

also occur, as illustrated in Figure 8.25 and Figure 8.26 (pinpointed by the arrows). While 

the nature of these structures is not totally clear, a biogenic origin of these is proposed.

8.3.2 Lipid biomarkers 

8.3.2.1 Dolomite chimneys 

Sample 3722-A33 

The chromatogram of this sample shows a large amount of dirt peaks, but some 

archaea-diagnostic biomarkers evidencing AOM were identified (Figure 8.27A and Table 

8.2). 

The peak of PMI, not very intense but clear, is identified and the carbon isotopic 

composition of this compound shows a depleted carbon isotopic ratio of -114‰ VPDB, 

which is a clear evidence for archaea-mediated AOM. PMI is produced by Archaea (Thiel 

et al., 1999) especially by methanogens, thermoacidophilics and methanogens. 

Squalane is present and depleted in 13C (-64‰ VPDB; Figure 8.27). Although 

squalane is not an unquestionable AOM marker, as it can have various sources, such 

strongly depleted 13C value indicates that methane must be the carbon source for this 

biomarker and it is most probably indicating AOM archaea. Possibly, squalane is a good 

and promising marker for the degradation of squalene, which is a polyunsaturated 

precursor of Squalane. 

Crocetane was not detected in this sample. The fact that this compound was detected 

on sample 3463-A08 (that presents a lower oxidation intensity), can be interpreted as an 

indicator of the degradation intensity. The degradation intensity in sample 3722-A33 is 

higher and therefore only the final and more resistant AOM markers remain. 

Other small peaks of isoprenoids, such as Pristane are present but just in trace 

quantities that do not allow the measurement of the 13C isotopic composition. Aliphatic n-

alkanes are also present: the short ones are produced by eukaryotes and the long ones by 

land plants. These compounds are allochthonous markers from eukaryotes and land plants. 

The uneven chains (C27, C29 and C31) predominate over the short ones, indicating relatively 

fresh biomarker material from the detrital organic mater.

Sample 3463-A08 

For the biomarker analysis of sample 3463-A08 (Figure 8.2) 250 g of material was 

collected by fragmenting slices of this sample to small pieces, keeping in mind to avoid the 

periphery of the chimney and parts of the sample with possible contamination. The 

analytical methodology used to process this sample is described in the flowchart of Figure 

D.2, Appendix D. The analytical procedure used for this sample includes a supplementary 

step that involves a previous extraction before the standard methodology normally used.

Gulf of Cadiz 

 326 

This first extraction step was performed to clean the dirt peaks before the decalcification. 

Only during the decalcification the biomarker compounds that we wish to analyse, will be 

liberated from the cement carbonate phase, and therefore concentrated in relation to the dirt 

compounds.

The chromatogram for this sample (Figure 8.27B and Table 8.2) shows biomarkers 

evidencing AOM, similar to the previous dolomite chimney sample, but here the archaeal 

diagnostic biomarkers are present in larger amounts. The peak of PMI is more pronounced 

than in sample 3722-A33 and the carbon isotopic composition of this compound shows a 

depleted carbon isotopic ratio of -117‰ VPDB, which is a clear evidence of AOM.

Squalane shows a depleted 13C ratio (-98‰ VPDB). This depleted value indicates 

methanogenic archaea as the probable source. A possible explanation for the difference in 

the isotopic composition of squalane between the dolomite chimneys samples 3463-A08 

and 3722-A33 might be that during the previous supplementary step of extraction, in 

sample 3463-A08, some of the “heavy” squalane was lost. 

 

8.3.2.2 Aragonite pavements 

Sample 3340 

The aragonite pavement sample 3340 was prepared according to the standard 

analytical methodology described in the flowchart of Figure D.1, Appendix D. The amount 

of material used was 20 g. 

This sample presents evidence not only of PMI (with 13C ratio of -100‰ VPDB), but 

also of mono-, di- and triunsaturated PMI. The isotopic ratios of the unsaturated PMI’s are 

heavier than the saturated compounds, presenting values of -72‰ to -75‰ VPDB (Figure 

8.28).

Crocetane is also present. It is one of the dominant peaks in the sample and presents 

very depleted isotopic 13C ratio (-132.27‰ VPDB). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated 

version of crocetane, is also present with a 13C ratio of -50‰ VPDB. Squalane is present 

but it is not as depleted as in the dolomite chimney samples. Squalane presents a 13C ratio 

of -40‰ VPDB. The short-chain n-alkanes are more abundant than the long-chain alkanes. 

There is also a stronger presence of eukariotes and less input of terrestrial material in this 

sample. Therefore the terrestrial input on the aragonite pavements seems to be less than the 

terrestrial input on the dolomite chimneys. 

Sample GeoB 9029-3 

Aragonite pavement samples from the Faro mud volcano (MV) yielded archaeal 

biomarkers such as crocetane/phytane with depleted isotopic 13C values (-110‰ VPDB), 

and Archaeal sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, also depleted in 13C (Table 8.3). PMI (with a 13C ratio 

of -111‰ VPDB) as mono-, di- and triunsaturated PMI are also present in this sample, all 

with depleted isotopic 13C values. 

Several bacterial lipid biomarkers, such as the i-C15:0; ai-C15:0; C16:1?5; C17:1?6 that 

have been described as related to SRB (Elvert et al., 2003), are present in this aragonite 

pavement sample. The bacterial lipid biomarkers that could be analysed are strongly 

depleted in 13C, with values ranging from -95 to -99‰ VPDB (Table 8.3). 

In this sample, the archaeal and bacterial lipids biomarkers occur in similar 

concentrations (Niemann et al., 2006). 

Sample GeoB 9023-1  

The aragonite pavement sample from Hesperides MV shows stronger oxidation 

intensity than the aragonite pavement from both Faro and Ginsburg MVs. Probably 

because of this, the bacterial fatty acids (FA) and the archaeal biomarkers from the 

Hesperides MV were found in much lower amount than in Faro MV. 

The most common bacterial FAs in the Hesperides MV were the C16:0 and C18:0, 

compounds, which are not associated with SRB. The lipid biomarkers associated with SRB 

(Elvert et al., 2003) found in this sample were i-C15:0; ai-C15:0 and C16:1?5, showing ?13C 

values less depleted than those values recorded on samples from the Hesperides MV 

(Table 8.3).

The archaeal biomarkers, similar to the SRB biomarkers, are found to be less 

abundant here than in the Faro MV sample. The most abundant archaeal biomarker is PMI 

(with depleted 13C isotopic value of -87‰ VPDB). Mono-unsaturated PMI was also 

identified as crocetane/phytane, archaeal and just traces of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol (Table 

8.3). 

Comparing the abundance of the archaeal lipids and the diagnostic bacterial 

biomarkers, here the bacterial biomarkers were approximately an order of magnitude lower 

in concentration than the Archaeal lipids. 

 

 

8.4 Discussion 

8.4.1 Textural and fabric implications on the MDAC formation 

processes 

The authigenic carbonate phases that compose the cement (aragonite, calcite and 

Mg-calcite in the aragonite pavements, and dolomite, Mg-calcite and calcite in the 

dolomitic crusts, chimneys and nodules) are characterized by depleted carbon isotopic 

compositions (?13C values as low as -46.9 ‰ VPDB, as described in Chapter 5), indicating 

that the precipitation of the authigenic carbonate minerals were induced by methane 

oxidation. The co-formation of the authigenic carbonates and authigenic pyrite with ?34S 

negative values (González et al., 2006a, b) indicates an anaerobic geochemical 

environment with sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting the sulphide precipitation 

in anoxic sediment conditions. Therefore, the oxidation of methane that lead to the 

alkalinity increase and subsequent formation of the authigenic carbonates had to be 

reached through the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 

As the dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules do not evidence any signs of 

dissolution episodes and subsequent phase of cementation, this support the model (as 

proposed in Chapter 5) that the dolomite dominated MDAC are formed at a deeper 

locations within the sedimentary column.

Figure 8.29. Schematic diagram illustrating the chemical environment during the formation of the authigenic 

carbonates (phase A and B). In (C) a change in the chemical environment occurs due to destabilization of gas 

hydrate layers that promotes the fracturation of the incipient aragonite pavements and subsequent ventilation 

of the system by seawater and consequent change of the environment to an oxic phase. This phase can be 

followed by a new phase (D) of authigenic carbonate formation leading to the re-cementation of the MDAC 

fragments.

Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 332 

The dolomite chimneys, crusts and nodules do not exhibit any textural or microfabric 

characteristics that indicate a change in the geochemical conditions (as dissolution 

episodes and subsequent phases of cementation). Some of than exhibit discontinuities not 

related to dissolution phases but interpreted as resulting from lithologic changes in the 

initial sediment from which the carbonate was formed or discontinuities that were 

interpreted as resulting most probably from variations on the cementation as consequence 

of variation of the methane flux supply. Therefore the dolomitic carbonates are interpreted 

as corresponding to a more confined environment of formation, most probably within the 

first meters of the sedimentary column (as discussed in Chapter 5). 

As some of the aragonite pavements show frequent dissolution events, this is an 

indicator of the variability of the environmental conditions and probably of changes to 

aerobic conditions, with periods of aerobic methane oxidation that lead to increase in 

acidity of the pore waters and carbonate dissolution instead of carbonate formation. This is 

interpreted as indicating a more ventilated (by seawater) environment, most probably 

closer to the seafloor, during the formation of the aragonite pavements. These dissolution 

events can be interpreted as corresponding to episodes of increased seawater ventilation. 

These episodes can result from: (1) a mechanical destabilization of the system by 

dissociation of gas hydrate layers in the shallow subsurface (as illustrated in Figure 8.29); 

(2) mechanical destabilization of the system as result of mud breccia eruptions within a 

mud volcano (as illustrated in Figure 8.30) or (3) by a reduction of the methane flux, 

allowing the sulphate and oxygen diffusion from seawater deeper into the sediment 

column. The two first processes can lead to ruptures of the carbonate cap of the aragonite 

pavements, leading to their brecciation and consequent increase of seawater ventilation and 

changing the chemical environment from anoxic to oxic conditions. 

 

8.4.2 Microfabrics and microbial fossil evidences 

The petrographic and SEM observations discussed in this chapter revealed large 

amounts of structures and textures that clearly indicate microbial activity during the 

formation of the MDAC. 

The carbonate cement of the MDAC, in both the dolomitic and aragonitic samples is 

characterized by a dominance of clotted microfabric that corresponds to the “structure 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 333

grumeleuse” described by Cayeux (1935) whose genesis and significance have been object 

of discussion (Shapiro, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; Shapiro, 

2002; Shapiro, 2004). This term is used to designate aggregates of cloudy, irregular, 

micritic authigenic carbonate (aragonite, calcite, Mg-calcite and dolomite) cement, primary 

in origin and where authigenic pyrite and probably organic compounds are abundant. This 

microfabric has been recorded in association with several active and fossil seep carbonates 

(Shapiro, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001c; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; 

Shapiro, 2002). Furthermore, the presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonitic and 

dolomitic carbonated indicates that this fabric is not specific of a particular mineralogy but 

it is specific of a particular genesis. The clotted fabrics of different scales are interpreted as 

typical features of microbial origin (Burne and Moore, 1987; Shapiro, 2000; Shapiro and 

Awramik, 2000; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and Fricke, 2002; Shapiro, 2002; Shapiro, 

2004). Given their irregular shape, the spatial arrangement of the clots and the higher 

abundance of pyrite and organic compounds, the clots are interpreted as indicative of 

formation in microenvironments of geochemical adequate conditions that were controlled 

by microbial metabolism. Therefore this microfabric is interpreted as an evidence of 

microbial mediation in the formation of the authigenic carbonates, particularly in the 

initiation of the carbonate precipitation. 

SEM observations of the cement of the dolomite crusts, chimneys and nodules 

(which consist of minor aggregates of rhombohedric calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite, 

up to 10 µm in diameter) allowed the identification of a large variety of other microbial-

induced morphologies and fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite 

and dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments, some of them being 

incorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; (3) rods with brush-like terminations; (4) 

structures that resemble dumbbell-like and cauliflower morphologies. The precipitation of 

dumbbell-like and cauliflower crystal aggregates have been induced by bacterial activity in 

laboratory experiments using sulphate-reducing bacteria (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; 

Warthmann et al., 2000). The observed microbial filaments and structures in the observed 

aggregates match the typical size of the features described in the bacterially laboratory 

authigenic carbonates precipitation experiments and are clearly constructive in origin. The 

filaments that are covered by the 50 nm to 1 µm size rhombohedra of calcite, Mg-calcite or 

dolomite and that are being incorporated by larger (5-10 µm) dolomite rhombohedra can 



Chapter 8. Biomarker and SEM evidences of microbial mediation in the formation of MDAC in the 
Gulf of Cadiz 

 334 

be interpreted as corresponding to nucleation points from where the dolomite precipitation 

started and from which it progressed. The lack of any crystallographic form or indication 

of cleavage of the rods and brush-like terminations and the similarity of the size of these 

features with the typical bacteria sizes indicates to a biotic origin. Therefore, the 

organogenic dolomite formation model, proposed for dolomite formation in shallow 

coastal lagunall and shallow marine environments (Vasconcelos et al., 1995) or in organic 

rich and deep marine sediments (Meister, 2005), is also proposed for the formation of the 

MDAC in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

In the aragonite pavements, SEM observations also allowed the identification of 

similar microbial-induced morphologies and fabrics, such as: (1) microbial filaments; (2) 

rods with brush-like terminations; (3) aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; 

(4) microbial and mucous biofilms occurring as a coating, draped between the aragonite 

fibres and needles of the stromatolitic layers; (5) the biotic origin of the pelmicrite clotted 

peloidal fabric; and (5) microbial filaments probably representing morphological bacteria 

remains. 

Samples of aragonite pavements frequently have botryoidal and stromatolitic fabrics 

that recover or totally fill cavities, fractures and open pore spaces. This fabric is similar to 

the stromatolitic fabrics reported from several active seep carbonates (Greinert et al., 2001; 

Peckmann et al., 2001b; Greinert et al., 2002) and to the stromatactoid fabric reported from 

several fossil seep carbonates (Peckmann et al., 2001a; Peckmann et al., 2002; Shapiro and 

Fricke, 2002). These reported stromatolitic and stromatactoid fabrics are described as 

infilling cavities and the cement (calcite or aragonite) grows in direction towards the 

source of energy (methane), which is downwards. This produces a smooth upper surface 

and an irregular lower surface of the reported stromatolitic and stromatactoid fabrics. In the 

aragonite samples from the Gulf of Cadiz, this growth criteria is not so clear and instead 

the stromatolitic and botryoidal layers seem to grow from the wall of the cavity towards 

their centre. Because much of the stromatolitic and botryoidal layers have shapes and sizes 

that resemble the shapes and sizes of the gas hydrate pieces collected from the mud breccia 

sediments in some mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz, the formation of the cavities 

(specially the sub-horizontal cavities and fractures) is interpreted as being generated by gas 

hydrate formation, inducing the fracturation of the unconsolidated or semi-cemented 

sediments. Subsequent dissociation of these gas hydrates and anaerobic oxidation of

 335

resultant methane induced the precipitation of the stromatolitic and botryoidal layers. As 

the gas hydrate dissociation had to progress from the periphery of the gas hydrate chunks 

towards their centres, the authigenic cementations will also have the same trend. 

 

8.4.3 Biomarker significance 

Specific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers have been identified in the dolomite chimney 

samples. These biomarkers include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI 

(2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane), pristine, phytane/crocetane and squalane 

(2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-tetracosane). These compounds derive from archaea involved 

in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 

The aragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison 

with the chimney dolomites. PMI (?13C value: -101‰) are accompanied by unsaturated 

derivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI?; -75‰). Isotopically-depleted PMI represents 

the most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-performing archaea 

(Peckmann and Thiel, 2004). Crocetane is present as one of the dominant peaks, strongly 

depleted in 13C (-132.27‰). Crocetane:1, the monounsaturated version of crocetane, is also 

present with a 13C ratio of -50‰. Squalane is present but not so depleted as in the previous 

biomarkers. Archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol were also detected with depleted in 13C 

compositions. 

Bacterial lipid biomarkers, strongly depleted in 13C, with values ranging from -95 to -

99‰ VPDB, that have been described as related with SRB, were identified on the 

aragonite pavement samples. The archaeal and bacterial lipids biomarkers occur in 

comparable concentrations (Niemann et al., 2006). 

Although the exact biochemical pathway of AOM still remains unclear, molecular, 

isotopic and phylogenetic evidence revealed that AOM is performed by a consortium of 

methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (Peckmann et al., 1999b; 

Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2000; Peckmann et al., 2001b; Peckmann et al., 2001c). 

The biomarkers identified on both aragonite pavements and dolomite chimneys indicate 

the presence of an AOM-SR consortium. Therefore, this microbial activity has an active 

and important role on the definition of the bio-geochemical conditions that has lead to the 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonates.

Gulf of Cadiz

8.5 Conclusions 

 

The different types of MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz include (as discussed in 

Chapter 5): dolomite crusts, dolomite nodules, chimneys or filled burrows, and aragonitic 

slabs or pavements. They all correspond to the cementation of sediments through the 

precipitation of authigenic carbonates and the different lithologic types correspond to 

different geochemical environments of formation. The dolomitic samples consist of 

microcrystalline dolomite cements with subordinate high and low magnesium calcite 

cementing a detrital pelagic fraction composed mainly of quartz and minor feldspar, clays, 

bioclasts of planktonic foraminifera (globigerinoids), ostracods, and pellets. The aragonite 

pavements form tabular to nodular precipitates consisting mainly of aragonite and calcite 

cementing mud volcano mud breccias, shells and clasts from previous generations of 

crusts, and detrital quartz, clays and bioclasts of planktonic foraminifera. Authigenic 

carbonates with depleted ?13C values indicate the oxidation of methane as the major carbon 

source. Authigenic pyrite also occurs, with ?34S negative values indicating an anaerobic 

geochemical environment with sulphate-reducing bacterial activity promoting sulphide 

precipitation in anoxic sediment conditions. 

The presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonitic and dolomitic carbonate 

cements is interpreted as indicating microbial mediation in the formation of the authigenic 

carbonates, particularly in the initiation of the carbonate precipitation. This interpretation is 

also supported by other observable structures such as: microbial filaments; high Mg-calcite 

and dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying and mimetizing filaments, some of them being 

incorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; rods with brush-like terminations; dumbbell-

like and cauliflower morphologies; aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; 

microbial and mucous biofilms forming coatings, draped between the aragonite fibres and 

needles of the stromatolitic layers; and microbial filaments probably representing 

morphological bacteria remains. 

Specific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in the dolomite chimney 

samples. They include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI (2,6,10,15,19-

pentamethyleicosane) and squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane). These 

compounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 

The aragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 337

the dolomite chimneys. PMI (?13C = -101‰ VPDB) is accompanied by unsaturated 

derivatives with 1 to 3 double bonds (PMI? = -75‰ VPDB). Isotopically-depleted PMI 

represents the most widespread and persistent hydrocarbon biomarker for AOM-

performing archaea. Bacterial lipid biomarkers strongly depleted in 13C, with values 

ranging from -95 to -99‰ VPDB, occur in comparable concentrations to the archaea lipid 

biomarkers, and have been described as related to sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). 

The results of the SEM observations and biomarker analysis show that microbes, 

consortia of Archaea/SRB had an active key role in the formation of authigenic carbonates. 

An organogenic model is proposed not only for the dolomite precipitation but also for the 

formation of the remaining authigenic carbonates (aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite). The 

microbial activity most probably created optimal micro-environmental geochemical 

conditions, most probably around the microbial structures, from where the precipitation of 

the MDAC is initiated. 

The presence of the stromatolitic and botryoidal fabrics further support the 

indications that the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates was a process that was 

actively involved during the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates (Chapter 6).

9.1 Main conclusions 

 

Fluid escape structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 
The fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz show a high degree of geologic 

and biologic variability associated with the type, intensity and duration of the fluid fluxes. 

The fluid escape structures observed in the Gulf of Cadiz include active and inactive mud 

volcanoes, mud diapirs, pockmarks and hydrocarbon seeps recorded by the methane-

derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC). 

 
In the Gulf of Cadiz the fluids and gases are mainly vertically focused through faults 

and along the mud volcano conduits, since the gas hydrates, the MDAC and the 

chemosynthetic communities are essentially found within the mud volcano edifices (Porto, 

Faro, Darwin, Fiuza, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Baraza, Kidd, Meknes, Mercator, Shouen and 

Student), the mud cones (Iberico, Cornide), the diapiric ridges (Formoza Ridge, 

Gudalquivir Diapiric Ridge and Hormigas Ridge) and the fault scarps (Pen Duick, 

Vernarsky ridge, Ridge W Gibraltar, Cadiz channel). Moreover, no regionally bottom 

simulating reflectors were found until now. 

 
The fluid escape structures from the Gulf of Cadiz and associated chemosynthetic 

communities, exhibit different manifestations corresponding to different phases of activity. 

They can represent a mud-prone phase of mud breccia extrusion with the rapid 

emplacement of mud flows, or they can locally consist of phases of moderate fluid flux, 

dominated by water and gas, resulting in the accumulation of shallow gas hydrates, the 

cementation of the mud breccia sediments, the formation of other types of MDAC, and the 

support of associated chemosynthetic communities. Through time, a mud volcano can 



 

Chapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions 

 340 

successively go through different phases of activity with different manifestations (as 

proposed on the schematic model in Figure 4.51, Chapter 4). 

 

MDAC occurrences and their controls 

 
As interpreted from side-scan sonar imagery, observed in the underwater video 

observations and confirmed by sampling, the MDAC occur within the mud volcanoes and 

mud cones, on the diapiric ridges, or associated with faults, as described in Chapter 4. 

They occur as fields with a high density of carbonate samples. 

 
The dolomite dominated MDAC (chimneys, crusts and nodules) show a large 

variability of shapes and sizes, including pipe-like, curved or helicoidal shapes, conical, 

branched, nodular, and massive irregular shapes. Their sizes are highly variable both in 

length and diameter. Chimneys with more than 3 m long and up to 0.5 m in diameter were 

observed. Most of these chimneys and crusts appear broken, sometimes intensely 

fragmented as carbonate rubble and occur most of the times lying on the sea floor. It is 

very rare to find chimneys that are in the vertical position, protruding from the sediments.  

 
As concerns the aragonite dominated MDAC, they occur (1) as buildups and small 

mound-like buildups of variable dimensions, some up to 4-5 m high and several meters in 

length; (2) as rough hard-grounds that can pave the seafloor for several square meters, with 

a thin or absent sediment cover; (3) as crusts and slabs, similar to the pavements or; (4) as 

nodular centimetric masses within the superficial sediments. 

 

MDAC and their formation process 

 
As discussed in Chapter 5, all the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz indicate that they 

formed as the result of anaerobic oxidation of fluids enriched in methane. This methane 

can have two different and distinct origins: thermogenic or microbial origin. Under 

adequate pressure and temperature conditions this methane can be stored as hydrate layers 

or nodules within the sediments. When pressure or temperature changes these gas hydrates 

can dissociate, leading to pore fluids enrichment in methane with light carbon, and water 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 341

with heavier oxygen isotopes. This methane from the dissociation of the gas hydrates, 

together with microbial and thermogenic methane that migrated from deeper parts of the 

sedimentary column, when it reaches the sulphate-methane transition zone, is anaerobically 

oxidized (AOM) coupled with the reduction of sulphate (SR), through a process that is 

mediated by microbial activity by a consortium of archaea and sulphate reducing bacteria, 

as described by Boetius et al. (2000). As result of the AOM-SR net reaction the alkalinity 

in the pore fluids is increased, the sulphate is consumed and authigenic carbonate 

(aragonite, calcite, high-Mg calcite and dolomite) precipitation is induced. The 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonate minerals results in the lithification of the 

sediments and this is the mechanism assumed for the formation of the MDAC. 

 
Also as a result of the AOM-SR net reaction HS-, is produced an will precipitate as 

pyrite or, together with methane which has not been completely precipitated, will feed 

chemosynthetic communities at the seafloor, such as Bathymodiolus and Calyptogena, that 

are frequently found cemented in the aragonite pavements. 

 
The different morphologies and different carbonate types reflect different flow 

patterns through the sediments. This is summarized on the schematic model proposed for 

the formation of the different MDAC shown in (Figure 5.17, Chapter 5). If the flux of fluid 

enriched in methane is canalized through the sulphate reducing zone (SRZ) of the 

sedimentary column, using borrows or sediment heterogeneities as pathways, a SMTZ with 

a strong gradient will be developed around these fluid conduits and consequently 

precipitation of the authigenic carbonates will be promoted around these conduits. Because 

these fluid conduits correspond to confined environments in relation to seawater influence, 

sulphate depletion can be reached and dolomite will be the dominant mineralogy to 

precipitate. The lithification of the sediments will result in the formation of the dolomite 

nodules, crusts and chimneys. The locations where the dolomite chimneys occur are 

presently swept by the flow of the Mediterranean undercurrent which can remobilize the 

unconsolidated sediments inside of which the chimneys were formed and therefore 

produce the collapse of the individual chimneys, explaining their present position on the 

seafloor. 

 



 

Chapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions 

 342 

Aragonite pavements represent precipitation of authigenic carbonates in a similar 

process to that of dolomite morphologies but, in an environment closer to the seafloor. The 

aragonite pavements will be formed at the sediment-seawater interface or close to it, as a 

product of the AOM-SR coupling process that can result from an active and discrete 

venting or from a more diffuse and low intensity venting process. Because these processes 

are more ventilated by seawater where high alkalinity is coupled with high sulphate 

concentrations, the mineralogy is dominated by aragonite. 

 
Therefore, the widespread occurrence of MDAC can be interpreted as a fossil record 

of extensive methane seepage in this particular area of the Gulf of Cadiz, spatially 

associated with probable deep fault systems and with mud volcanoes and diapirs, that 

constitute preferential pathways for the fluid migration. They constitute a probable 

important natural methane sequestration process. 

 

MDAC precipitation and estimated pore fluids composition 

 
Considering (1) the present day seabottom water temperatures, (2) the extreme limits 

for temperature variation during the glacial/interglacial cycles, (3) the oxygen isotopic 

composition of the Gulf of Cadiz bottom waters, both for the North Atlantic Deep Water 

and the Mediterranean Outflow water, and (4) assuming that the oxygen isotopic ratio 

variations are the typical between glacial and interglacial stages, the isotopic composition 

of the original fluids from which the carbonates precipitated were estimated according to 

the different mineral/temperature fractionation equations of precipitation. Considering the 

minimum and maximum temperature limits admitted to be possible to occur in the Gulf of 

Cadiz, not all the measured carbonate isotopic values are compatible with precipitation 

from normal seawater isotopic composition (as summarized in Figure 6.27, Chapter 6). 

 
Aragonite pavements are estimated to have bee formed from normal seawater oxygen 

isotopic compositions, or from 18O-enriched pore waters, indicating a contribution from the 

dissociation of gas hydrates. 

 
Some dolomite chimneys indicate formation conditions from pore waters with 

oxygen isotopic compositions similar to normal seawater. However, others indicate a 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 343

formation from pore fluids with a contribution from destabilization of gas hydrates, or the 

precipitation from pore waters during gas hydrates formation (Figure 6.27, Chapter 6). 

 

The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the authigenic carbonates do not indicate a clear and major 

addition of Sr from deep seated fluids, but they preferably reflect the contemporaneous 

seawater Sr composition. 

 

Dating of the dolomite chimneys formation 

 
The U/Th estimated ages of two dolomite chimneys, as described in Chapter 7, 

indicate that the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates occurs in short discontinuous 

intervals of time, most probably, intercalated with longer periods of absence of 

precipitation. The chimneys that result from the precipitation during different episodes will 

exhibit different grow layers or concentric rings. 

 
The estimated ages along radial profiles on dolomite chimneys indicate formation at 

periods of rapid paleoceanographic changes. The ages obtained point to the precipitation 

during: (1) the onsets of glacial/interglacial cycles (termination 2 and 3), contemporary 

with rapid sealevel rises; (2) at the transition from stadial to interstadial, also 

corresponding to rapid sealevel rise; and (3) at the transition from interglacial (MIS 5.5) to 

stadial MIS 5.4 or from interglacial (MIS 5.3) to stadial 5.2, associated with periods of 

progressive sealevel lowering (Figure 7.12, Chapter 7). 

 
It is proposed that the MDAC are the record of intense fluid flow episodes during 

periods of increased seabottom water temperature, most probably as a result of the increase 

of the Mediterranean Outflow influence at the locations where the samples were collected 

from. This increase in seabottom water temperature is, most probably, reducing the gas 

hydrate stability zone, leading to gas hydrate dissociation and the consequent release of 

methane-rich fluids which will induce the carbonate precipitation along the fluid conduits 

on the fluid pathways above the methane seepage sites.

 344 

Microbial mediation on the formation of the MDAC 

 
As discussed in Chapter 8, the presence of clotted microfabric in both aragonite and 

dolomite dominated carbonate cements is interpreted as indicating a microbial mediation in 

the formation of the authigenic carbonates, particularly in the initiation of the carbonate 

precipitation. This interpretation is also supported by other observable structures such as: 

(1) microbial filaments; (2) high Mg-calcite and dolomite crystal aggregates calcifying 

filaments, some of them being incorporated by dolomite and calcite crystals; (3) rods with 

brush-like terminations; (4) aragonite batons, ball-capped batons and nanograins; (5) 

microbial and mucous biofilms forming coatings, draped between the aragonite fibres and 

needles of the stromatolitic layers; and (6) microbial filaments probably representing 

morphological bacteria remains. 

 
Specific 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers were identified in the dolomite chimney 

samples. These include tail-to-tail linked acyclic isoprenoids such as PMI (2,6,10,15,19-

pentamethyleicosane) and squalane (2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane). These 

compounds derive from archaea involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. The 

aragonite crusts showed even better preserved biomarker patterns in comparison with the 

dolomite chimneys. Bacterial lipid biomarkers strongly depleted in 13C occur in 

comparable concentrations to the archaea lipid biomarkers, and have been described as 

related to sulphate-reducing bacteria. 

 
The results of the SEM observations and biomarker analysis show that microbes, a 

consortia of Archaea/sulphate-reducing bacteria, had an active key role in the formation of 

the authigenic carbonates. An organogenic model is proposed not only for the dolomite 

precipitation but also for the formation of the remaining authigenic carbonates (aragonite, 

calcite and Mg-calcite). The microbial activity most probably created optimal micro-

environmental geochemical conditions around the microbial structures, from where the 

precipitation of the MDAC is initiated. 

 
The presence of the stromatolitic and botryoidal fabrics further support the 

indications that the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates were processes actively 

involved in the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates.

9.2 Future work and open questions 

 

Natural gas hydrates (GH) were recovered and inferred to occur in several mud 

volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. The proximity of this methane reservoir to the seafloor and 

its restricted thermodynamic stability domain has motivated large speculations about the 

release of methane from destabilized GH in response to climatic changes (MacDonald, 

1990). Increases of seabottom temperature (as result of regional oceanographic condition 

changes) and decreases in pressure (e.g. through sea level changes) can destabilize gas 

hydrates, releasing methane into the near-surface environment and having an important 

impact on the carbon cycle (Buffett and Archer, 2004; Archer and Buffett, 2005). 

According to the clathrate gun hypothesis (Kennett et al., 2003), episodic atmospheric 

methane emissions resulting from the destabilisation of GH reservoirs contributed 

significantly to the distinctive behaviour of late Quaternary climate. 

The influence of GH destabilization on the carbon cycle depends on the volume of 

the GH reservoirs and on how the GH responds to changes in the oceanographic conditions 

(time scale of the methane release). If GH destabilization and fluid escape is slow, then the 

diffuse escape of methane will most probably result in its total oxidation in the sulphate-

methane transition zone, leading to the precipitation of methane-derived authigenic 

carbonates (MDAC), or to its aerobic consumption by microbes, with negligible amounts 

being released to the seawater. If the fluid escape is fast enough, it will allow methane to 

be released directly to the water column and possibly also to the atmosphere. The principal 

mechanisms of rapid methane release are 1) mud volcano (MV) activity (e.g. Etiope et al., 

2004; Etiope and Milkov, 2004); 2) slumping at continental slopes (Mienert et al., 1998); 

and 3) pervasive flow along fractures due to overpressured gas (Flemings et al., 2003). 

During the period of this research the several cruises and projects carried out in the 

Gulf of Cadiz (GC) allowed the discovery of 42 MVs (Pinheiro et al., 2003; 2005). Gas 

hydrates were retrieved from some of them (Bonjardim, Captain Arutyunov and Ginsburg 

MVs) and inferred to occur in several others. Other fluid escape structures associated with 

the MVs, such as pockmarks and MDAC (Magalhães et al., 2004) indicate active processes 

of dewatering of the sedimentary basin. According to the carbon isotopic composition of 

the GH, the presence of heavy hydrocarbons (Mazurenko et al., 2002; Nuzzo et al., 2005) 

and the isotopic composition of the authigenic carbonates (as concluded from the work 



 

Chapter 9.  Main Conclusions, Future work and Open questions 

 346 

carried out from this thesis), the most active sites in the GC are characterized by high 

concentrations of light hydrocarbons, both of microbial and thermogenic origin. The 

implications of the identification of thermogenic light hydrocarbons in deeper parts of the 

sediment column and the evaluation of he potential source rocks are open questions to be 

investigated. 

The Mediterranean Outflow water (MO) strongly influences the hydrology of the 

North Atlantic making the GC a highly sensitive region to paleoclimatic changes. The MV 

areas, in the upper and middle slope of the GC, are located under the influence of the MO. 

Possible influences of the MO on slope failure and GH destabilization have been proposed 

by Gardner (2001) and also from the results of the work carried out during this thesis. 

It is now possible and evident that it would be of great importance to complete the 

inventory of GH occurrences in the GC and to model the GH stability field for the different 

ranges of gas compositions determined from MV pore waters and the known GH 

compositions. The spatial distribution of potential areas of GH occurrence and shallow gas 

accumulations need to be interpolated on a regional scale, with an estimation of potential 

volumes involved and the response of the potential regional reservoirs to environmental 

changes. 

Specific structures such as the MV, mud cones, MDAC fields, pockmarks, landslides 

and erosive structures like some channels of the MO, should now be studied in detail. 

Modelling different scenarios, with extreme oceanographic conditions (glacial and 

interglacial maximums and variations in seabottom temperature, salinity, and oxygen 

content resulting from different MO strength and pathways) and their consequences on the 

GH stability field can now be investigated and understood. The determination of the 

responses of the different fluid escape structures to episodes of GH destabilization is also 

an important task that should be investigated. 

A calculation of the GH stability domains should allow a reinterpretation of the 

available seismic data in order to identify the existence of possible bottom simulating 

reflectors (BSRs) in areas where they have not been recognized previously. 

The implications of the presence of methane on the benthic faunal communities and 

on the geochemical characteristics of the sediments is also an important question to be 

investigated. With this objective, benthic foraminifera communities, from selected MVs 

where active fluid venting was recognised from this work, should be studied in order to 



 
Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 
 

 347

evaluate the isotopic composition of the benthic fauna and to establish criteria (isotopic 

and specific chemical fingerprints) that can be used to recognize fossil gas seeps on the 

geological record. This is also an open question that can be a test of the clathrate gun 

hypothesis, as the quantification of the ?13C excursion towards depleted values in the 

foraminifera tests from seep sites with moderate to slow flux rates where all the methane is 

consumed within the sediment, is pertinent.

fauna that includes several species of molluscs, polychaetes, pogonophoran worms, crustaceans, echinoderms and
some fragments of dead coral (Madrepora and Lophelia). Carbonate crusts were recovered from the Student mud
volcano. The Ginsburg mud volcano, discovered during the previous TTR-9 cruise, was revisited and gas hydrates
recovered once again. A new mud volcano was also discovered in the Spanish margin, Tasyo, where evidence was
found of coral build-ups on the hard substratum of the mud volcanic edifice.

1. Introduction

A considerable quantity of work on the topics
of mud volcanism, submarine gas hydrates, cold
seeps and hydrocarbon-rich £uid venting has been
done over more than two decades, both by indus-
try and academia (see, for example, references in
Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1998, and in Milkov,
2000). A particular e¡ort has been put into under-
standing the role of tectonics in the occurrence of
mud volcanism, particularly in compressional re-
gimes (e.g. Westbrook and Smith, 1983; Barber et
al., 1986; Limonov et al., 1996; Galindo-Zaldivar
et al., 1996; Woodside et al., 1997; COifcOi et al.,
1997; Suess et al., 1999). Also, in the last few
years, the international scienti¢c community has
devoted much attention to the widespread occur-
rence of gas hydrates (mainly methane, which is a
greenhouse gas) in the ocean sub-bottom sedi-
ments and their importance to global carbon
£uxes, climate change, slope instabilities and as
a potential energy resource for the future (e.g.
Hovland and Judd, 1988; Mienert et al., 1996;
Dickens et al., 1997; Judd et al., 1997; Nisbet
and Piper, 1998; Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1998;
Henriet and Mienert, 1998; Baraza et al., 1999;
Milkov, 2000; Paull and Dillon, 2001).
The occurrence of mud volcanism, cold seep-

age, hydrocarbon venting and gas hydrates in
the Gulf of Cadiz has been intensively investi-
gated since 1996 (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Ba-
raza et al., 1999; Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,
2000; Ivanov et al., 2000, 2001; Somoza et al.,
2000; Mazurenko et al., 2001). Within the frame-
work of the UNESCO/IOC Training Through
Research Program, two research cruises have in-
vestigated the Gulf of Cadiz for this speci¢c pur-
pose: TTR-9, in 1999, and TTR-10, in 2000. Dur-

ing the TTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et
al., 2000), a large mud volcano ¢eld was discov-
ered in the Moroccan and Spanish margins of the
Gulf of Cadiz. This discovery was based on the
interpretation of a side-scan sonar mosaic and
multibeam bathymetry (SEAMAP) acquired in
that area by the Marine Physics Branch of the
Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington,
DC, USA, in cooperation with the Hawaii Map-
ping Group and the Naval Oceanographic O?ce,
in 1992. This was followed by three other cruises:
(1) two cruises in the Spanish and Portuguese
sectors of the Gulf of Cadiz, within the frame-
work of the Spanish Tasyo project, where, besides
new mud volcanoes, carbonate chimney structures
related to £uid venting were recovered (Somoza et
al., 2000, 2003); (2) the TTR-10 cruise (Leg 2).
In this paper we present the results of the TTR-

10, Leg 2. The main objective of this cruise was to
investigate several sea£oor structures observed on
the NRL side-scan mosaic, that occur in the
South Portuguese, the Western Moroccan and
the Spanish margins of the Gulf of Cadiz. These
often exhibit a signi¢cant morphological expres-
sion on the multibeam bathymetry and were in-
terpreted as mud volcanoes. They were investi-
gated with seismic pro¢ling, long-range side-scan
sonar (OKEAN), hull-mounted 3.5-kHz pro¢ler,
TV grab and were con¢rmed by coring to be mud
volcanoes (Fig. 1). This work complements the
previous work done in the Moroccan and Spanish
margins during the TTR-9 cruise.

2. Geological setting

The Gulf of Cadiz has had a very complex geo-
logical history and has undergone several episodes

MARGO 3269 25-2-03

of rifting, compression and strike-slip motion,
since the Triassic (Wilson et al., 1989; Dewey et
al., 1989; Maldonado et al., 1999). During the
Mesozoic and the Early Cenozoic, the area was
undergoing rifting, with the formation of half-gra-
ben structures and carbonate platforms (Maldo-
nado et al., 1999). The westward migration of the
Gibraltar arc during the Late Tortonian caused
the Gulf of Cadiz to form as a forearc basin
and induced the emplacement of an olistostrome,
in an accretionary wedge-type depositional envi-
ronment, strongly deforming the sediments de-
rived from the South Iberian and North African
margins of Thetys (Maldonado and Comas, 1992;
Maldonado et al., 1999) (Fig. 2). The end of the
emplacement of the olistostrome took place in the
Late Miocene and coincided with an accelerated
tectonic subsidence and the development of thick

progradational and aggradational depositional se-
quences.
Throughout this area, extensive mud volcanism

(Fig. 2), mud diapirism, carbonate mounds and
chimney structures related to hydrocarbon-rich
£uid venting are observed (Somoza et al., 2003).
The observed mud volcanism has been interpreted
as indicating the existence at depth of gas-rich
overpressured sediments (Somoza et al., 2000).
The migration of these £uids through the sedi-
ments to the sea£oor appears, in some places, to
have been controlled by faulting, since some of
the mud volcanoes are located along major
NW^SE and NE^SW trending faults identi¢able
on the NRL side-scan imagery (Gardner, 2001).
The migration of the £uids along these faults is
possibly related both to along-slope gravitational
sliding and to the tectonic compression of the

olistostrome and accretionary complex of the
Gulf of Cadiz, due to the Africa^Eurasia conver-
gence (Somoza et al., 2000). It has also been sug-
gested that some of the widespread shallow £uid
venting on the sea£oor, particularly in the North-
ern Gulf of Cadiz, could be explained by the de-
stabilization of gas hydrate-rich sediments in con-
tact with the Mediterranean Out£ow Water
(MOW) (Somoza et al., 2000).

3. Geophysical data acquisition

During the TTR-10 cruise, additional geophys-
ical surveys with airgun single-channel seismic,
OKEAN side-scan sonar and 3.5-kHz pro¢ler

were carried out in the areas chosen for bottom
sampling (Fig. 1).

3.1. Seismic re£ection pro¢les

Single-channel seismic re£ection pro¢les were
acquired in the Gulf of Cadiz area during the
TTR-10 cruise. The source consisted of one 3.5-l
airgun, at a pressure of 120 bar (12 MPa), towed
at a depth of approximately 2^2.5 m and ¢red
every 10 s (i.e. approximately every 30 m). The
streamer consisted of one active section, 7.5 m
long, with 16 hydrophones, towed at a depth of
approximately 2.5^3 m. The o¡set between the
seismic source and the middle of the hydrophone
array was 180 m. The signals were analogue-¢l-

tered to 50^250 Hz during the acquisition stage.
The sample interval was 1 ms and the record
length 3 s. The data were acquired digitally using
software developed by Moscow State University
(MSU). Preliminary processing was done on
board with RadExPro software, provided to the
Unesco MSU Centre for Marine Geosciences by
GSD Productions, Moscow, Russia. The basic
processing sequence, after the de¢nition of the
source-receiver geometry, consisted of the appli-
cation of static shift corrections, amplitude recov-
ery by spherical divergence correction, and But-
terworth bandpass ¢ltering (20^230 Hz).

3.2. OKEAN side-scan coverage

Due to time constraints and also to the fact
that the NRL mosaic provided excellent detail
in the western part of the survey, where the geol-
ogy appears to be simpler, only the eastern part of
the study area (Lines PSAT 152^156) was sur-
veyed with the long-range 10-kHz OKEAN side-
scan sonar available on the Professor Logachev
(Fig. 1). In this area, the geology is very complex

with a strong mix of tectonic and sedimentary
features. This survey was necessary to provide a
more detailed image of the sites selected for cor-
ing. It covers the Tasyo mud volcano and part of
the Tasyo ¢eld in the north.

4. Bottom sampling results

A total of 21 sites in the South Portuguese, the
Western Moroccan and the Spanish margins of
the Gulf of Cadiz were chosen for sampling (see
location in Table 1). The precise sampling loca-
tion was based on the interpretation of the NRL
mosaic, complemented by additional seismic, 3.5-
kHz pro¢ler and OKEAN side-scan imagery.
Twenty gravity cores were taken, with a total re-
covery of 36.87 m. One site was investigated with
a TV-controlled grab system (Student mud volca-
no). The location of the 13 most important cores
is depicted in Fig. 1. Macrofauna was recovered
from the top 30 cm of each gravity core and from
sieved sediments of the grab sample. The listing of
the taxa recovered is shown in Table 2.

4.1. The South Portuguese ¢eld

Several structures observed on the NRL SEA-
MAP mosaic of the deep South Portuguese mar-
gin of the Gulf of Cadiz (water depths between

ca. 2000 and 3200 m) were interpreted as either
mud volcanoes or gas seepage structures. Four
sites, expressed by high re£ectivity sub-circular
spots, were chosen for bottom sampling. Three
of them were con¢rmed by coring to be new
mud volcanic structures and were named: Bonjar-
dim, Carlos Ribeiro and Olenin.

4.1.1. The Bonjardim mud volcano
This was the ¢rst structure, presumed to be a

mud volcano, investigated during the TTR-10
cruise. It is located at 35‡27.6PN and 09‡00.0PW.
On the NRL side-scan mosaic, it appears as an
approximately circular, isolated feature, with a
diameter of ca. 1 km and a strong backscatter
(Fig. 3a). The single-channel seismic pro¢les
PSAT-146 and PSAT-147 reveal that it has a
height of approximately 100 m (Fig. 3b) with a
sea£oor depression at the rim of the cone. Four
cores were taken on this structure, all of which
recovered mud breccia and con¢rmed it to be a
mud volcano.
The ¢rst core, AT-226G, was taken from the

top of the Bonjardim mud volcano, at a depth
of 3059 m (Fig. 3b). The recovery consisted of
151 cm of mud breccia matrix, supporting angular
and subangular clasts of variable size (from milli-
metric to 3 cm) and lithology, mainly represented
by brownish gray mudstone. There was no pelagic
veneer, and only the uppermost few cm of the
mud volcanic deposits were oxidized, suggesting
that this mud volcano was recently active. Di¡er-
ent layers of mud breccia were observed along the
core, alternating lighter and water saturated with
darker and more consolidated mud breccia. This
may indicate di¡erent £ows and stages of activity
of the volcano. A strong H2S smell was detected
and Pogonophora (two undetermined species)
were recovered from this core.
The second core, AT-227G (234 cm), was taken

from a terrace just below the top of the mud
volcano, at a depth of 3066 m (Figs. 1 and 3);
the mud breccia recovered was very similar to the
one previously sampled (although it was more
homogenous) but the top 42 cm comprised a
marly sediment, soupy in the ¢rst 6 cm and then
bioturbated and rich in Foraminifera. A strong
H2S smell was present and a Pogonophora-rich

(mainly Polybrachia sp.) layer was observed at the
very top of the core, indicating active £uid vent-
ing. Foraminifera and empty polychaete tubes
were also recovered from this core.
A third core, AT-228G (283 cm), was taken

from the £ank of the mud volcano, at a depth
of 3150 m, in order to de¢ne the extension of
the mud £ows (Fig. 3). The recovery consisted
of a thick intercalation of olive brown pelagic
marl and brown marly turbidites enriched in Fo-
raminifera, easily distinguishable due to the sharp
boundaries and the coarser texture. Bioturbation
activity was very strong throughout the whole
core. No mud breccia was recovered. One crusta-
cean (Tanaidacea) and empty Pogonophora tubes
were recovered from this core.
Finally, one last core, AT-246G (306 cm), was

taken, at a depth of 3060 m, on the top of the
Bonjardim mud volcano, in an attempt to recover
gas hydrates. The recovery was comparable to
that of the station AT-226G, with a 12-cm layer
of soupy and oxidized structureless mud breccia
at the top, with angular and subangular clasts of
di¡erent size and lithology. The contact between
the oxidized and the unoxidized parts was very
sharp. Between 135 and 156 cm, an interval of
darker mud breccia was observed. Gas hydrates,
in the form of small crystals, were ¢nally sampled
and found below 156 cm. A strong H2S smell was
evident and some small pyrite crystals were ob-
served. Foraminifera, Pogonophora (Oligobrachia
sp.) and polychaete fragments (Maldanidae) were
recovered from this core.

4.1.2. The Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano
The next mud volcano in the South Portuguese

margin that was investigated during the TTR-10
cruise was named Carlos Ribeiro, after a famous
Portuguese geologist (1813^1882). It is located
at 35‡47.217PN and 08‡25.313PW, at a depth of
2200 m. It is expressed as a high re£ectivity sub-
circular spot on the NRL SEAMAP mosaic (Fig.
4a). The 3.5-kHz pro¢ler con¢rms its conical
shape, with a height of approximately 80 m and
a diameter of ca. 1.5 km (Fig. 4b).
Two cores, separated by approximately 30 m,

were taken from the top of this structure: AT-
243G and AT-244G (Fig. 4; Table 1). The cores

are similar, showing almost no pelagic sediments
on top, and a succession of gray structureless very
poorly sorted mud breccia, slightly oxidized and
bioturbated at the very top (only a few cm thick
on core AT-244G); this indicates that this is a
recently active structure. The mud breccia recov-
ered is highly gasi¢ed, with an intense H2S smell.
The clasts are subangular or angular rock frag-
ments of di¡erent lithologies and shapes, with
variable sizes sometimes reaching 15 cm. Among
them was found one fragment of semi-consoli-
dated claystone with a thin bitumenous pellicule
at the surface. The strong H2S smell throughout
both cores and the lack of a pelagic veneer at the
top of both successions con¢rms an intense recent
activity of this mud volcano. Some empty shells
and one live bivalve (Thyasiridae), Foraminifera,
empty Thecosomata shells and Pogonophora (Oli-
gobrachia sp. and another undetermined species)
were recovered from this site.

4.1.3. The Olenin mud volcano
The next structure to be investigated was the

Olenin mud volcano (Figs. 1 and 5), named after
a famous Russian scientist (1923^1982). On the
SEAMAP mosaic, it appears as a dome-like struc-
ture with high re£ectivity, located at approxi-
mately 35‡45PN and 08‡26PW, on a slope. It was
surveyed with a 3.5-kHz pro¢ler. Two crossing
pro¢les were collected, and one core, AT-245G,
was taken near the summit of this structure (Fig.
5). The 287 cm of core recovered is mainly repre-
sented by pelagic yellowish brown and olive gray
marl with olive brown and gray clay. The sedi-
ments were bioturbated and contained a silty and
foraminiferal admixture. Several oxidized layers
were observed throughout the core and traces of
a reduction front were described for the lower-
most part of the succession, suggesting possible
past £uid venting in the site. A minor part of
the core consisted of two thin layers of mud vol-
canic deposits: one at the 60^65-cm and the other
at the 210^210-cm intervals. They both were char-
acterized by sharp irregular contacts and con-
tained millimetric to centimetric subangular clasts
of di¡erent lithologies in a silty clayey matrix. The
fauna recovered from this site included Forami-
nifera, empty Thecosomata shells and a few frag-

ments of empty pogonophoran tubes. It has been
interpreted as a small, non-active vent/volcano.

4.1.4. Dome-shaped structure. Mud volcano?
One dome-shaped structure was also observed

on the OKEAN side-scan sonar records and on
the seismic pro¢le PSAT-148, at approximately
35‡29PN, 08‡15PW (Fig. 1). One core, AT-229G,
was taken in this structure. A hemipelagic succes-
sion of alternating light olive brown and strongly
bioturbated marl rich in Foraminifera and more
grayish, also intensively bioturbated marl was re-
covered. Although no mud breccia was recovered
from this site, a mud volcanic origin of the dome-
like structure cannot be excluded. Empty tubes of
Pogonophora and Polychaeta were also retrieved
from this site.

4.2. The Spanish ¢eld

In the Spanish ¢eld, several occurrences of gas
seepage and mud volcanism were discovered dur-
ing the TTR-9 (Kenyon et al., 2000) and TTR-10
cruises. In the northern part of this sector, a sig-
ni¢cant amount of very high quality data, includ-
ing multibeam bathymetry, high resolution seis-
mics, coring and dredging, was collected in the
Tasyo ¢eld (Somoza et al., 1999, 2003). During
the TTR-9 cruise, a very interesting mud volcano
was discovered in this area ^ the St. Petersburg
mud volcano (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,
2000). During the TTR-10 cruise, another dome-
like structure, discovered during the Spanish Geo-
logical Institute expedition in 1999 (L. Somoza,
personal communication) was investigated: the
Tasyo mud volcano.

4.2.1. The Tasyo mud volcano
The Tasyo mud volcano is located approxi-

mately at 35‡45PN and 07‡05PW. During the
TTR-10 cruise, both OKEAN and seismics were
used to investigate this structure prior to coring.
The seismic Line PSAT-152 crossed the TASYO
mud volcano (Figs. 1 and 6).
Two cores were taken on the top of this mud

volcano (Table 1). The ¢rst core, AT-241G (Fig.
6), at a depth of 1100 m, penetrated carbonate-
rich super¢cial sediments (marls with dead corals

^ Lophelia), overlying a mud breccia with gas
vesicles. Empty shells of Thecosomata and other
gastropods, Sipuncula (undetermined species) and
Polychaeta (Nothria hispanica), were recovered
from this site. The second core, AT-242G, at a
water depth of 1100 m, penetrated marls and
mud breccia like AT-241G, with Foraminifera,
although with less dead corals (Lophelia). The
two cores recovered showed a marly unit on the
top, of di¡ering thickness. In both cases the yel-
lowish brown marl was found to be rich in Fora-
minifera and contained a coral-supported layer at
about 15 cm below the top of the core. In the core
AT-241G, coral fragments showed up again in the
lower part of the marly unit between 50 and 69
cm, where the sediment appeared to be more
grayish and enriched in Foraminifera. The second
half of these cores was a homogenous and struc-
tureless mud breccia with a large number of clasts
of di¡erent roundness and size (in some cases up
to 9 cm in size). Both cores showed evidence of a
possible development of coral build-ups on hard
substrate, namely carbonate crusts at the surface
of the mud volcanic edi¢ce.

4.3. The Western Moroccan ¢eld

In the Western Moroccan ¢eld, where the
Yuma, Ginsburg, Kidd, Adamastor and TTR
mud volcanoes were discovered during the TTR-
9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al., 2000), ¢ve
sites were chosen for bottom sampling (see loca-
tion in Fig. 1). Three new mud volcanoes were
discovered: Jesus Baraza, Student and Rabat.
Three cores were also taken from the previously
known Ginsburg mud volcano, and more gas hy-
drates were recovered from them.

4.3.1. The Jesus Baraza mud volcano
This was the second structure to be cored dur-

ing the TTR-10 cruise. It also proved to be a mud
volcano and was named Jesus Baraza, after a re-
cently deceased Spanish geologist who worked in-
tensively on methane seeps. On the side-scan mo-
saic it shows up as a circular feature with a strong
backscatter (Fig. 7a). On the seismic pro¢les (east-
ern end on Line PSAT-151; Fig. 1) it shows as a
prominent high with a maximum height above

sea£oor of about 150 m (Fig. 7b). Two cores were
collected in this mud volcano.
The ¢rst core, AT-230G, was taken from the

£ank of the mud volcano, at the base of the slope,
at a water depth of 1159 m. A hemipelagic marly
succession was recovered with bioturbation and
Foraminifera distributed throughout the whole
core. The usual few centimeters of soupy and
water-saturated brownish marl were found at
the top, with the sediment becoming more consis-
tent downcore. Slump structures were visible be-
low 120 cm, where darker layers and burrows
were tilted and bent in an oblique orientation.
No mud breccia was recovered. This indicates
that hemipelagic and slump deposition was prev-
alent on this slope for a relatively long period.
Only a few specimens of Foraminifera and empty
Thecosomata shells were recovered from this core.
The second core, AT-231G, at a water depth of

1091 m, sampled the top of the mud volcano. The
¢rst 4 cm consisted of light brown soupy and
water-saturated marl very rich in Foraminifera,
with a few Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.). The
rest of the core could be subdivided in two main
units. The ¢rst unit (4^27 cm) showed structure-
less water-saturated brownish mud breccia with
clayey matrix and numerous clasts of di¡erent
color, roundness and lithology. The oxidation of
this interval and the bioturbation with burrows,
¢lled with sediment from the upper marl layer,
might indicate that the mud volcano has not
been active recently. The second unit (27^1254
cm) presented the same mud breccia found above
but more consolidated and without oxidation or
bioturbation. A strong H2S smell was detected.
The mud breccia unit was relatively well strati¢ed,
with several intervals representing di¡erent mud
£ows. Mud breccia £ows therefore occurred on
this mud volcano but they did not reach the site
of the ¢rst of these two cores.

4.3.2. Student. Another mud volcano?
Two cores, AT-232G and AT-233G, and one

TV-controlled grab station (AT-239GR) were tak-
en on this high re£ectivity, sub-circular feature
observed on both the NRL mosaic and the
OKEAN sonar mosaic obtained during the
TTR-9 cruise (Fig. 8). They con¢rmed that this

structure is related to cold seepage, and it was
named Student. A carbonate crust and dead cor-
als (Madrepora and Lophelia) were retrieved from
the top part of the cores.
The ¢rst core, AT-232G, showed a poor recov-

ery, with only some material in the core catcher.
It was represented by gray mud enriched in Fo-
raminifera, with numerous dead coral branches of
Lophelia cf. pertusa and Madrepora cf. oculata
and abundant fragments of mollusc shells and
echinoderm spikes. Many Pogonophora (Sibogli-
num sp.), some hydroids, one decapod (Munidop-
sis sp.) and one bivalve (Limopsis sp.), were also
recovered. Three carbonate crusts were collected.
The second core, AT-233G, recovered 36 cm of

yellowish brown and grayish brown marl, very
enriched in Foraminifera with fragments of bi-
valve shells and dead coral branches (Madrepora
and Lophelia). One anthozoan, a polychaete frag-
ment and a juvenile pogonophoran (probably Si-
boglinum sp.), were collected from this sample. A
carbonate crust (5 cm in size) was also found in
the middle of the recovered sequence.
Finally, one grab station (AT-239GR), posi-

tioned with a TV camera, recovered carbonate
crusts and marls. A video pro¢le across this struc-
ture con¢rmed the assumption about recent seep-
age in the area, and showed the presence of gas-
related carbonate build-ups, dense clam beds
(probably Solemya mediterranea), living coral,
and coral debris. A number of yellowish and
grayish brown porous carbonate crusts were col-
lected, reaching 50 cm in size. The fauna recov-
ered from this sample was very abundant and
diversi¢ed: 50 specimens belonging to 17 di¡erent
taxa were collected. These included Porifera, Cni-
daria (Hydrozoa and Anthozoa), Sipuncula, Poly-
chaeta, Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.), Mollusca
(undetermined gastropod, Cuspidariidae-like bi-
valves, Limopsis sp.), Pycnogonida (Hedgepethia
atlantica), Crustacea (Cirripedia, the cumacean
Procampylaspis sp., the amphipod Liropus cf.
elongatus, a tanaid and an anthurid isopod) and
Echinodermata (undetermined species of Echini-
dae and Ophiuridae).

pears on the NRL side-scan mosaic as another
circular feature. One core, AT-235G, was taken
from the top of this structure. 288.5 cm of sedi-
ment was recovered. The ¢rst 19 cm consisted of
yellowish brown marl intensively bioturbated and
water-saturated for the ¢rst 6 cm. Foraminifera,
Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.), shell^coral debris
and dead coral (Lophelia) were found throughout
this interval. From 19 to 129 cm the core showed
the same marl but with a grayish color becoming
darker towards the bottom. Coral debris were
present throughout this interval. Bioturbation
was extremely intense, with large burrows ¢lled
with soupy, sandy silty clay, presumably from
an underlying interval. The rest of the core was
mud breccia, with a color varying from gray to
dark gray; the intervals separated by sharp
boundaries were interpreted as di¡erent mud
£ows. Surprisingly the mud breccia showed in-
tense bioturbation; this, together with the exis-
tence of a marly sediment upper cover, appears
to indicate that the mud volcano has been inactive
for a relatively long period of time.

4.3.4. The Ginsburg mud volcano
Three cores were collected and gas hydrates re-

trieved from the top of the Ginsburg mud volcano
(see location in Fig. 1), discovered during the
TTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001; Kenyon et al.,
2000): AT-236G, AT-237G and AT-238G. The
recovery varied from 145 to 182 cm and they all
showed the same lithology: a structureless, gray,
very gassi¢ed mud breccia with a thin oxidized
interval at the very top. The target, to recover
gas hydrate crystals, was successfully accom-
plished in core AT-238G, from which ice-like
gas hydrates up to 5 cm in size (Fig. 9) were
collected from the interval below 150 cm. These
were stored in a cold laboratory for later geo-
chemical analyses. According to the data obtained
during the TTR-9 and TTR-10 cruises, the Gins-
burg mud volcano appears to be presently the
most active mud volcano in the Gulf of Cadiz.
Foraminifera and Pogonophora (Siboglinum sp.)
were recovered from this site.

4.3.5. Diapir-like structure. Mud volcano?
One core, AT-234G, was also taken from the

top of dome-shaped structure shown as a high
re£ectivity spot on both the NRL mosaic and
the OKEAN side-scan data from the TTR-9
cruise. 241 cm of a marly succession was recov-

ered, showing an intensive bioturbation through-
out the core and the presence of Foraminifera,
shells and dead coral fragments at some intervals.
The lower half of the succession was represented
by an unusual intercalation of oxidized and re-
duced lamina and was characterized by an intense
H2S smell. All this evidence seems to indicate the
existence of £uid venting through the sea£oor.
Although no more cores were taken from this
structure, its gas escape origin was con¢rmed.
Thus, this site clearly deserves further investiga-
tion.

5. Micropaleontological investigation of the matrix
from the mud volcanic deposits

Micropaleontological studies were carried out
on board, to date the matrix of the mud volcanic
deposits using calcareous nannofossils. Samples
from the matrix of the mud breccia were taken
from the Bonjardim, Carlos Ribeiro, Jesus Bara-
za, Rabat, Ginsburg and Tasyo mud volcanoes
for preliminary determination of the time range.
Smear slides were prepared from raw samples and
examined under the microscope. The method of
calcareous nannofossils identi¢cation of Perch-
Nielsen (Bolli et al., 1985) was applied to cocco-
liths.
Calcareous nannofossils from di¡erent ages

have been found in the matrix of the mud brec-
cias. Preservation of the calcareous nannofossils is
moderate to poor. They seem to be partially dis-
solved, which makes it di?cult to identify small
forms. Relatively large coccoliths show good pres-
ervation. In general, discoasters are found to be
damaged and at times their arms broken, making
their identi¢cation di?cult. Some representatives
of the discoasters show overcalci¢cation patterns
that obscure important features and cause com-
plications during the process of identi¢cation and
classi¢cation of species.
Some Upper Cretaceous species are common in

the samples from the mud volcanoes. In each
sample, four to six species of Upper Cretaceous
coccoliths were identi¢ed in the mud volcanoes of
the Moroccan and the Spanish margins. The most
abundant species are Micula decussata and Watz-

naueria barnesae. These species could have been
derived from a hemipelagic source or from slope
sediment by the process of re-sedimentation. They
are also present in the pelagic sediments observed
on the super¢cial sediments of some mud volca-
noes. Thus, the presence of these species is not
conclusive evidence of an Upper Cretaceous age.
Only the mud volcanoes discovered in the South
Portuguese margin show an assemblage of Upper
Cretaceous coccoliths. It is possible that Upper
Cretaceous deposits are located near the roots of
the mud volcanoes on the Portuguese margin.
Paleocene species occur only sporadically in

only two sediment samples. The most probable
explanation for this is the absence of signi¢cant
Paleocene deposits near the roots of the studied
mud volcanoes. Calcareous nannofossils, typical
of Eocene deposits, are found in abundance.
Among them Reticulofenestra umbilica, R. hillae,
Discoaster barbendiensis, D. saipanensis, Ericsonia
formosa are frequently observed in smear slides.
Based on these nannofossils it is con¢rmed that
there are Eocene deposits in the roots of the mud
volcanoes. There are also some transitional spe-
cies through the Oligocene (D. de£andrei, Cycli-
cargolithus £oridanus, C. abisectus, Dictycoccites
bisectus). However, the presence of the Oligocene
sediments cannot be con¢rmed because of lack of
evidence of marker species. The most abundant
species in the matrix are Miocene^Pliocene cocco-
liths and discoasters. There are numerous species
in all the samples of the matrix that were studied.
The following species were observed most fre-
quently in the smear slides: Discoaster variabilis,
D. druggii, D. pansus, Reticulofenestra pseudoum-
bilica, R. gelida, Reticulofenestra spp., Dictycoc-
cites spp., Sphenolithus heteromorphus, Calcidiscus
macintyrei; several other species were also
present. The presence of Miocene^Pliocene species
suggests that sediments of these ages have been
actively involved in the process of mud volcanism
in the region.
Quantitative analysis of the coccoliths was car-

ried out in the samples of matrix from mud brec-
cia in core AT-227G. Amongst the 145 specimens
of calcareous nannofossils, 45 are from the Upper
Cretaceous (mainly Micula decussata 26, Watz-
naueria barnesae 15, Cribrospherella ehrinbergii

5, etc.), 25 specimens are from the Eocene (Eric-
sonia formosa 7, Reticulofenestra umbilica 5,
R. hillae 3), 15 specimens are transitional from
the Upper Eocene through the Oligocene to the
lower Miocene, and 37 specimens are from the
Miocene^Pliocene (mainly di¡erent types of Dis-
coasters, small Reticulofenestra, R. pseudoumbili-
ca, R. gelida and Dictycoccithes sp.). The other
species are recent coccoliths namely Emiliania
huxley, Gephyrocapsa sp., Coccolithus pelagicus,
Calcidiscus leptoporus, Rhabdosphaera claviger
and Syracosphaera pulchra.

6. Discussion and conclusions

From the combined results of the TTR-9, TTR-
10 and Tasyo cruises, there is now vast evidence
of extensive cold seepage, carbonate mound for-
mation including cold-water coral communities
(Lophelia skeletons), hydrocarbon-rich gas vent-
ing and mud diapirism in the South Portuguese,
Spanish and Western Moroccan margins of the
Gulf of Cadiz (Baraza and Ercilla, 1996; Baraza
et al., 1999; Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Ivanov et
al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2000, 2003; Gardner,
2001; Mazurenko et al., 2001). This has been in-
terpreted as indicating the existence of gas-rich
overpressured sediments at depth and the migra-
tion of these £uids through the sediments and/or
along major faults to the sea£oor (Somoza et al.,
2000).
As regards the tectonic control of the location

of the mud volcanoes, the NRL SEAMAP mosaic
shows that some of these structures are aligned
along major fault structures, probably strike-slip,
with two main orientations: NW^SE and a con-
jugate NE^SW set (Gardner, 2001). Therefore,
although some of the widespread shallow £uid
venting on the sea£oor in the northern part of
the Gulf of Cadiz may be explained by the de-
stabilization of gas hydrate-rich sediments in con-
tact with the warmer MOW (Somoza et al., 2000),
a signi¢cant number of the mud volcanoes in the
deeper areas of the basin appear to be controlled
by major faults that acted as conduits for the
£uids. The overpressure in the sediments at depth
is possibly related to fast sediment supply, along-

slope gravitational sliding and to the tectonic
compression of the olistostrome and accretionary
complex caused by the Africa^Eurasia conver-
gence (Somoza et al., 2000).
There is also strong evidence that the mud vol-

canoes located in the western and deeper parts of
the Gulf of Cadiz are the most active, with the
exception of the Ginsburg mud volcano, on the
Moroccan sector. Gas hydrates were recovered
from both the Bonjardim and the Ginsburg mud
volcanoes. The signi¢cance of this is not yet fully
understood but is possibly related to the distribu-
tion of the tectonic stress in this area.
The typical structures related to £uid venting in

this area are conical mud volcanoes with diame-
ters ranging from several tens of meters to ca.
4 km and heights that can reach 200 m (Ivanov
et al., 2000). In some of the cores recovered from
these structures (e.g. Bonjardim mud volcano), a
strong H2S smell could be felt. This, together with
the lack of a pelagic veneer and abundant Pogo-
nophora at the very top of the core, appears to
indicate active venting. Evidence of multiple £ows
was also observed on several mud volcanoes.
As regards the age of the gas-rich layer, the

oldest clasts found in the cores are of Upper Cre-
taceous age (Bonjardim, Carlos Ribeiro and Ta-
syo), particularly in the Portuguese sector,
although the majority of the clasts are of Eo-
cene/Miocene age. Since the study area is an ac-
cretionary complex with an olistostrome emplace-
ment, this does not necessarily imply that the
overpressured gas-rich mud layer is older, because
the Upper Cretaceous clasts may belong to the
overlying olistostrome and come from the eastern
nappes. Further research is necessary to clarify
this problem.
Carbonate crusts and cold-water coral com-

munities were found only in the eastern sectors
of the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the Spanish and Moroc-
can sector. Seepage contributes to the enrichment
of dissolved organic carbon in the water column
which seemingly favors the development of such
communities (Hovland et al., 1998). However, the
presence of a hard substrate in some of the mud
volcanoes, namely the existence of carbonate
crusts or mud breccias, may be crucial to the ini-
tial settlement of the coral larvae. This question

Abstract

A new deep water mud volcano field (between 2000 and 3500 m water depth) was discovered in the deep South
Portuguese margin, as well as several new mud volcanoes in the South Spanish and Western Moroccan margins of the
Gulf of Cadiz, during the TTR-10 (Training Through Research, UNESCO/IOC) cruise, in July/August 2000. This
work followed the discovery of a large mud volcano field in the Gulf of Cadiz, first investigated during the TTR-9
cruise [Gardner (2001) Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 339^342; Kenyon et al. (2000) IOC, Technical series no. 56]. The
discoveries were made based on a SEAMAP side-scan sonar mosaic and multibeam bathymetry (SEABEAM)
collected in the area by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC, USA, in 1992, kindly released for
this purpose. Single-channel seismics, long-range side-scan sonar (OKEAN), TV-controlled grab, hull-mounted 3.5-
kHz profiler and coring were used to investigate several seafloor features observed on the side-scan sonar imagery, in
the South Iberia, Spanish and Moroccan margins of the Gulf of Cadiz, which were confirmed to be mud volcanoes.
The typical structures related to fluid venting in the Gulf of Cadiz are essentially represented by conical mud
volcanoes with diameters ranging from several tens of meters to 4 km and heights that can reach 200 m. Some of these
structures appear to be aligned along major conjugate NE^SW and NW^SE trending faults that can be identified on
the side-scan sonar imagery. The new field discovered in the South Portuguese margin is the deepest in the Gulf of
Cadiz area and includes three new mud volcanoes ^ Bonjardim, Olenin and Carlos Ribeiro ^ which seem to be quite
active, with near-surface gas hydrate occurrence and a high saturation in H2S and hydrocarbon gases (mainly
methane) in the mud breccia and overlying pelagic sediments. Gas hydrates were recovered from the Bonjardim mud
volcano. An intensely gassified mud breccia, with one fragment of semi-consolidated claystone with a thin bituminous
veneer at the surface, was recovered from the Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano. The fauna recovered consists mainly of
pogonophoran worms belonging to several species and undetermined species of Foraminifera. Three new mud
volcanoes were also discovered in the NW Moroccan margin: Rabat, Student and Jesus Baraza. These show a richer

also deserves further investigation. The fauna col-
lected in the Moroccan sector exhibited a high
diversity that can be explained mainly by the
high habitat heterogeneity due to the availability
of di¡erent substrates (soft muddy sediments, car-
bonated crust, dead coral beds).
The macrofauna collected in the Gulf of Cadiz

included several species of pogonophoran worms
belonging to the genera Siboglinum, Polybrachia
and Oligobrachia. Variations in the species distri-
bution are mainly depth-related with a higher di-
versity occurring at the deeper Portuguese mud
volcanoes. Thyasirid bivalves (one living specimen
and several empty shells), whose complex burrow
systems oxygenate the sediments to a depth of
more than 8 cm, were also recovered in the Por-
tuguese sector. Video footages from the Moroc-
can sector, collected during this cruise, showed
evidence of dense clam beds (probably Solemya
mediterranea). These pogonophoran and bivalve
species are known to contain bacterial symbionts
and form chemosynthetic communities that are
sustained by £uid expulsion through mud volca-
noes (Southward, 1985, 1986; Southward et al.,
1981; Sibuet and Olu, 1998).
Chemoautotrophic organisms may interact with

the sediment properties: high levels of bioturba-
tion are associated with the dense beds of the
bivalves that can cause signi¢cant changes in the
chemical characteristics of the sediment due to the
activity of their symbionts (Dando and South-
ward, 1986). On the other hand these organisms
respond to the environment characteristics and
may also be used as indicators of £uid emission:
variations in the density of Pogonophora (number
of tubes per m2) can be related to the intensity or
chemistry and regularity or persistence of £uid
emissions in seepage areas (Sibuet and Olu,
1998). No Pogonophora were recovered from
the Spanish ¢eld, while the highest densities
were found at the Student, Ginsburg (Moroccan
sector) and Bonjardim (Portuguese sector) mud
volcanoes. This biological information agrees
with the geological evidence of recent activity es-
pecially in the two latter volcanoes.
Based on all the available data, the main con-

clusions that can be drawn from the bottom sam-

pling results, integrated with the geophysical
data and the preliminary work carried out, can
be summarized as follows:
^ A large variety of sediment types present in

the Gulf of Cadiz area were recovered and de-
scribed, implying a superposition of di¡erent de-
positional environments in this region of very
complex geology and £uid £uxes.
^ The mud volcanism is a widespread phenom-

enon in the Gulf of Cadiz and six new mud vol-
canoes were discovered in the area during the
TTR-10 cruise. Most of them were proven to be
recently active, in particular Bonjardim, Carlos
Ribeiro and Ginsburg. Gas hydrates were recov-
ered from Bonjardim and Ginsburg.
^ The mud volcanism of the Gulf of Cadiz is

characterized by a zonal pattern in terms of the
mud breccia lithology typical of di¡erent mud
volcanoes. In general, relatively thin mud breccia
£ows, intensively bioturbated at the top, and
semi-consolidated clasts within matrix with high
carbonate content are characteristic of the mud
volcanoes sampled on the Spanish and Moroccan
margins of the Gulf of Cadiz. Non-strati¢ed thick
sti¡ mud breccia, only occasionally bioturbated,
and numerous well lithi¢ed clasts within matrix
lacking signi¢cant carbonate admixture were
found to be typical of the mud volcanoes from
the Portuguese margin of the Gulf of Cadiz.
^ The co-existence of coral-rich carbonate

build-ups and mud volcanic activity was con-
¢rmed to be widely present in the Gulf of Cadiz.
However, this co-existence appears to be re-
stricted to the shallower Spanish and Moroccan
sectors (900^1200 m) and apparently absent on
the deeper Portuguese sector (2200^3200 m).
^ Faunal communities probably sustained by

hydrocarbon-rich £uid emission through mud vol-
canoes were also widely present in the Gulf of
Cadiz.
^ Di¡erences in composition and structure of

the chemosynthetic-based communities in the
mud volcanoes may be related to the intensity
or chemistry, or to the regularity or persistence
of the hydrocarbon-rich £uid emission. These dif-
ferences may be used as indicators of temporal
variations in the activity of the mud volcanoes.

Abstract

The El Arraiche field is a new mud volcano field discovered near the Moroccan shelf edge in the Gulf of Cadiz that

consists of 8 mud volcanoes in water depths from 200 to 700 m. The largest mud volcano in the field (Al Idrissi mud

volcano) is 255 m high and 5.4 km wide. The cluster was discovered during a survey with the RV Belgica and studied

further during Leg 2 of the TTR 12 survey onboard the R/V Prof Logachev. The 2002 surveys yielded detailed multibeam

bathymetry over a 700 km
2
study area, dense grids of high-resolution seismic data, deep-tow sub bottom profiles, sidescan

sonar mosaics over the major structures. Selected video imagery lines, video guided grab samples, dredge samples, gravity

cores, and box cores were collected for groundtruthing purposes. Eight mud volcanoes in water depths from 200 to 700 m

cluster around two, sub-parallel anticlines and associated active extensional faults. Rock clasts and regional seismic data

locate the El Arraiche field over a Late Miocene–Pliocene extensional basin. The onset of mud volcanic activity is estimated

at about 2.4 Ma and probably roots in the Cretaceous–Miocene accretionary wedge. Stacked outflows are visible up to a

depth of about 500 m below the sea floor. The occurrence of long-lived mud volcanoes bear witness to continued

overpressure generation at depth, either by in situ oil and gas generation or by focussed flow and accumulation in the

area. Geochemical analyses of pore water from cores demonstrate the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbon processes. The

activity of the mud volcanoes is indicated by the thickness of hemi-pelagic sediments covering extruded mud breccia, the

1. Introduction

Since the first mud volcano was discovered in the

Gulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Gardner, 2000, 2001), 30 or

more mud volcanoes were identified in the span of

three years (Pinheiro et al., 2002; Somoza et al.,

2003), together with vast fields of hydrocarbon-de-

rived pockmarks and other features related to fluid

escape (Barazza and Ercilla, 1996). As such, the Gulf

of Cadiz (Fig. 1) has, in a very short time, become one

of the prime targets to study these submarine features

and the associated sedimentary, biological and bio-

chemical processes.

noes (Lazarillo de Tormes and Don Quichote mud

volcanoes) are only 500 m wide and 25 m high. The

data, a few very high-resolution deep-towed sub-bot-

tom profiles, side scan sonar data over the major

structures, selected video imagery, video guided grab

samples, dredge samples and gravity cores. Integration

of data sets allows studying these long-lived mud

volcanoes in detail, and moreover, macro as well as

micro level studies over selected places from the re-

gional scales down to microscopic scales.

Mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are closely

associated with accretionary wedge-type setting re-

lated to the convergence of the African and Eurasian

plate boundaries and gravitational thin-skinned tec-

tonics over a Triassic salt decollement, also com-

monly known as the olistostrome unit (Somoza et

al., 2003). The newly discovered El Arraiche field is

part of a larger cluster of mud volcanoes (the Span-

ish Moroccan Field, Gardner, 2001) that lies within

the accretionary realm but outside the active olistos-

trome units (Fig. 1). Like other mud volcanoes in

the Gulf of Cadiz (Somoza et al., 2002), the El

Arraiche mud volcanoes evidence episodic expul-

sion of liquidized sediment thought to be related

to the episodic migration of hydrocarbons. This

paper describes the main characteristics of the

mud volcanoes in the El Arraiche field and dis-

cusses their origin, structural setting and the impli-

cations for the hydrocarbon potential of this area

offshore Morocco.
2. Geological setting

The Gulf of Cadiz is situated between 98 W to 68
45V W and 348 N to 37.15V N enclosed by the Iberian
peninsula and Morocco, west of Gibraltar. The ba-

thymetry is steadily increasing from 200 m at the shelf

edge to depths of over 4 km in the Horseshoe and

Seine abyssal plains. Geologically, the setting of the

Gulf of Cadiz is extremely complex and still under

debate (Sartori et al., 1994; Maldonado et al., 1999;

Gutscher et al., 2002). One of the most important

structures is the large olistostrome complex (or

allochthonous nappes) that were emplaced in the Tor-

tonian in an accretionary wedge-type environment

(Maldonado et al., 1999; Medialdea et al., 2004).

The main part of the olistostrome unit occupies the

central part of the Gulf of Cadiz as a lobe-shaped

structure that extends over 300 km into the ocean (Fig.

1, Maldonado et al., 1999), its extent seems not yet

well defined (Maldonado et al., 1999; Somoza et al.,

1999; Medialdea et al., 2004; Maestro et al., 2003).

The study area is situated south of the main olistos-

trome unit where thick Late Miocene–Pliocene sedi-

mentary series were deposited in extensional basins at

the back of advancing allochthonous sheets (Medial-

dea et al., 2004). Mio–Pliocene depocentres are bor-

dered by shallow ridges characterized by large and

active normal faults (Flinch, 1993), probably super-

posed on relict Miocene thrust anticlines (Maldonado

et al., 1999) or Triassic salt diapir structures (Bera?-

stegui et al., 1998; Somoza et al., 2003).

All mud volcanoes and other fluid escape features

have been found within the realm of the accretionary

prism units. They cluster in several mud volcano

fields (Somoza et al., 2003, Fig. 1): the Guadalquivir

Diapir Ridge (GDR) mud volcano field is located at

the north-western side of the Guadalquivir Ridge at

the margin of the Tortonian olistostrome unit and at

the main thrust belt in this area. It is a dense field with

11 identified mud volcanoes, mud cones and large

fluid escape structures in water depths from 380 to

1560 m (Somoza et al., 2003). The term bmud coneQ
refers to conical shaped hills without proof of mud

breccia (Somoza et al., 2003) but is further used here

to indicate the mud volcanic hill. The largest structure,

the Lolita mud cone, occurs in a water depth of 1560

m and is 316 m high and 5.7 km wide. The Tasyo mud

volcano field is separated from the GDR mud volcano

field by the Cadiz undercurrent channel. It lies over

the north-central part of the main olistostrome unit

and consists of 8 mud volcanoes or mud cones amidst

many other unidentified circular sea floor structures.

The largest structure, the Faro mud volcano, is 190 m

high and 2.6 km wide and set in a water depth of 795

m. The Deep Portuguese Margin (DPM) mud volcano

field occupies the distal part of the main olistostrome

unit in water depths between about 2 to 3.2 km. Only

three mud volcanoes have been discovered in this

large area but many other features that resemble

mud volcanoes or mud cones still need to be studied.

The largest in this mud volcano field is probably the

Bonjardim mud volcano that was encountered in a

water depth of about 3060 m. It is about 100 m high

and about 1 km in diameter (Pinheiro et al., 2002).

The Spanish-Moroccan (SPM) mud volcano field lies

within the bTriassic DiapiricQ structural zone (Somoza
et al., 2003), south of the main olistostrome unit, in a

water depth of about 600 to 1200 m. The largest

structure in this area is probably the Ginsburg mud

volcano that is over 200 m high and about 4 km in

diameter in a water depth of about 1200 m (Gardner,

2000, 2001).

The El Arraiche mud volcano field is located at the

south-eastern continuation of the Spanish-Moroccan

mud volcano field, offshore the city of Larache. The

mud volcano field is located within the accretionary
prism structure but outside the realm of the main

olistostrome units. Exploration well LAR-1 is located

about 8 km east of the study area.
3. Data

The multibeam survey on board R/V Belgica used

a Kongsberg EM 1002, extended with a deep water

module. Maximum sailing speed was 6 knots, with a

swath width of 750 m in shallow water (b500 m) and

500 m in deep water. The acquired data was corrected

and cleaned with the Kongsberg packages Merlin and

Neptune. The footprint at 400 m is 15?15 m. In total
700 km

2
was covered.

A total of 62 high-resolution seismic profiles (Fig.

3) were acquired in three dense grids with a line

spacing of about 1 km centred on the Mercator, Al

Idrissi and Gemini mud volcanoes. The seismic ac-

quisition used a SIG sparker (80 electrodes) with an

energy of 500 J and a SIG surface single channel

streamer. In some cases a water gun (15 in.
3
) or a

GI-gun (SODERA 35 in.
3
generator and 35 in.

3
in-

jector) were used. Along 5 lines the IFREMER deep-

tow Chirp source (650–2000 Hz) was tested with the

IFREMER deep-tow 2-channel streamer (of which

only one channel was used during this campaign),

with excellent results in terms of penetration and

resolution. Seismic profiles were digitally recorded

using the Elics Delph system. Data processing

(swell-filter, band pass filter, deconvolution and signal

amplification) used the Landmark Promax processing

software. Interpretation and mapping was done using

Seismic Microsystems’ Kingdom Suite.

During the TTR 12 survey side scan sonar imagery

over the main features (Fig. 3) was acquired using the

deep-towed hydro–acoustic complex Mak-1, with an

operating frequency of 30 kHz, and a sub bottom

profiler operating at 5 kHz. The Vernadsky Ridge,

the deeper part of the Renard Ridge and the Mercator

mud volcano were surveyed with one sidescan sonar

line each, Al Idrissi and Gemini mud volcanoes and

the upper Renard Ridge were each covered by a mo-

saic of three lines. Based on the side scan sonar data, 6

transects were chosen for a deep-towed TV-line, for a

total of 15 h. Based on the TV-lines, TV-guided grab

samples were taken (Fig. 3). Dredge samples of mud

breccia at the sea floor were taken on Mercator and Al

Idrissi mud volcanoes. In the craters of the main mud

volcanoes (Mercator, Al Idrissi, Gemini, and Fiu?za)

the subsurface was sampled by gravity cores. Four

additional box cores are also available from the R/V

Belgica survey. The technical details of the equipment

and core analysis strategies during TTR12 survey are

listed in the cruise report Kenyon et al. (2003). Geo-

chemical sampling was performed on all gravity cores

within the El Arraiche mud volcano field at irregular

intervals of about 10 to 30 cm, depending on the

lithology. Geochemical sampling and analysis proce-

dures are described by De Mol et al. (1998) and

Stadnitskaia et al. (2002). This paper uses measure-

ments of methane concentrations and the ratio between

methane concentration and the concentration in high

hydrocarbons (C1/C2+).
4. Data description and interpretation

The El Arraiche mud volcano field (Fig. 2) con-

sists of at least 8 mud volcanoes of varying size that

are clustered around two sub-parallel sea floor

ridges, the Vernadsky and Renard ridges, both with

steep fault escarpments. The ridges rise up in water

depths of about 700 m and stretch to the shelf edge.

Most mud volcanoes occur on top of the Renard

ridge (Lazarillo de Tormes mud volcano, Gemini

mud volcano, Don Quichote mud volcano and

Fiu?za mud volcano). The Kidd mud volcano is

situated on top of the Vernadsky Ridge. Isolated

mud volcanoes occur between the ridges (Adamastor

mud volcano, Mercator mud volcano, Al Idrissi mud

volcano).

Fig. 6. Side scan sonar mosaic over the Al Idrissi mud volcano

with superimposed bathymetry. This mud volcano is 225 m high

5.4 km wide at its base and 1.5 km wide at the top. The flanks of

the mud volcano are dominated by down slope mud flows with

high backscatter that contrast with pelagic slope sediments with

low backscatter.

P. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1–178
The mud volcanoes stand out as conical hills on the

sea floor with varying slope profiles (Van Rensbergen

et al., 2005), mud breccia deposits were found at their

top. On the seismic data, the mud volcanoes are

characterized by a reflection-free seismic facies that

shows stacked outflow lenses within a stratified series

of hemi-pelagic sediments above a regional unconfor-

mity (Fig. 4). This basal unconformity is mapped in

Fig. 5 and is used to document the structural setting of

the mud volcanoes. The following paragraphs will

describe each of the mud volcanoes. Statistical and

descriptive information on the mud volcanoes can be

found in Table 1.

4.1. Al Idrissi mud volcano

Al Idrissi mud volcano is the largest and shallowest

mud volcano in the field, situated just below the shelf

edge in water depths of about 420 m (Fig. 2). It

appears to be located on a westward plunging anti-

cline (Fig. 5), visible in the bathymetry and on seismic

data at the eastern side of the Al Idrissi mud volcano

but almost entirely disappears at its western side.

Deep moats at the base occur at the northern and

southern side of the mud cone but they are absent

over the plunging anticline at the western and eastern

sides. The mud volcano is 225 m high, up to 5.4 km

wide at its base and 1.5 km wide at the top (Table 1).

It is almost circular at the base and has an eye-shaped

crater at the top. The crater is up to 17 m deep at the

western side, the eastern part is occupied by a central

dome-shaped elevation, maximum 42 m above the

crater floor. The flanks of the mud volcano are dom-

inated by down slope mud flows. On the side scan

sonar mosaic (Fig. 6), mud flows have an even texture

but return high backscatter in contrast to the pelagic

slope sediments. Backscatter contrast is lower on the

southern and eastern flanks probably where pelagic

sediments drape the mud extrusions. Core 411G (Fig.

7) and box cores B1 and B2 at the top and at the

northern flank of the central dome reveal a sandy layer

at the surface of 3–5 cm thick with a sharp and

irregular limit separating it from a mud breccia. In

core 411G (Fig. 7) this mud breccia is a stiff struc-

tureless clay with claystone clasts up to 1 cm. The

small clasts encountered at the central dome is in

contrast with rock clasts found at the crater floor.

Here, up to 0.5 m large rocks were dredged. They
,

are mainly of Upper Miocene and Pliocene age and

composed of coarse to fine grained sandstones and

siltstones, some with biodetritus in a calcite cement

(Akhmanov et al., 2002).

4.2. Mercator mud volcano

The Mercator mud volcano is set at the southern

flank of the Vernadsky Ridge within a 2 km wide, N–S

oriented, collapse zone. This collapse zone is L-shaped

and turns 90 degrees west, north of the Mercator mud

volcano (Figs. 2 and 5). The mud volcano is an asym-

metric mud volcano (Fig. 8) with a moat along its

southern and western side. It is 141 m high at the

southern side, 90 m high at the northern side and

only 51 m high at its eastern side (Table 1). It has a

maximum diameter of 2.45 km at the base and 1.1 km at

its top. Side scan sonar data show a semi-concentric

pattern related to the fronts of mud flow lobes, rather

than a radial outward mud flow pattern. A 2 m deep

rimmed crater occurs at the northern side but is absent

at the southern side. The top of the mud volcano con-

sists of a crater and a 38 m high central dome. Solitary

blocks (F10 cm in diameter) occur. Core 408 (Fig. 7)
yielded a grey, structureless, slightly silty clay with clay

stone clasts, covered by 8 cm of oxidized marl. The

seismic data (Fig. 9) show a smaller buried structure,

interpreted as a buried mud volcano occurs south of

Mercator mud volcano within the same collapse zone.

4.3. Gemini mud volcano

The Gemini mud volcano occurs south of the large

fault escarpments at the sea floor that bound the south-

ern flank of the Renard Ridge (Fig. 2). It consists of two

mud volcanoes in one large oval-shaped mud cone

(Fig. 10). The entire mud volcano is up to 252 m

high, 4.1 km long to 2.3 km wide at the base, the

maximum diameter at the top of the eastern part (Gem-

ini East) is 1.3 km and the maximum diameter of the

western part (Gemini West) is 0.9 km (Table 1). The

summits of both Gemini East and Gemini West consist

of a flat crater area with a central dome of respectively
23 and 27 m above the flat crater area. Core 404G at the

eastern summit (Fig. 7) reveals 12 cm of bio-turbated

marl (hemi-pelagic mud), on top of different layers of

mud breccia. Another marl layer with a thickness of 4

cm occurs at 32 cm depth. The mud breccia is gray and

very gas-saturated, with randomly distributed rock

clasts. At the western summit is no hemi-pelagic sed-

iment. Core 405G (Fig. 7) shows a gray mud breccia

with a strong H2S smell. The surface layer (11cm) is an

oxidized, heavily bioturbated mud breccia. Moats are

present parallel to the long axis of the mud volcano.

4.4. Other mud volcanoes

Fiu?za mud volcano is a smaller mud volcano east of

Gemini (Fig. 10). It is located at the western termina-

tion of the Renard Ridge and possibly at the southern

continuation of the collapse depression that host the

Mercator mud volcano but no faults could be traced in

either direction to its location. The mud volcano is

maximum 143 m high, 2.2 km wide at the base and has

a flat top of up to 0.75 km wide with a central dome of

27 m high and maximum 0.7 km wide (Table 1). Core

Fig. 8. Side scan sonar image of the Mercator mud volcano with

superimposed bathymetry. This asymmetric mud volcano is 140 m

high at the southern side but only 90 m high at the northern side. It has

a diameter of 1.84 km at the base and 0.5 km at its top. Side scan sonar

data show a semi-concentric pattern of mud flow lobe fronts in the

crater and on the slope, different from radial outward mud flow

pattern at Al Idrissi mud volcano.

homogeneous mud breccia covered by 12 cm of pe-

lagic marl. A semi-circular moat occurs around the

base of the mud volcano. Moats are also prominent

at deeper levels on seismic data.

Kidd and Adamastor mud volcanoes have been

described earlier by Gardner and Shashkin (2000).

Adamstor is 2 km wide at the base and about 160 m

high. Kidd is sitting on the edge of a fault escarpment,

it is about 4 km wide but its height is difficult to

measure (between 60 to 160 m). The smaller Don

Quichote and Lazarillo de Tormes mud volcanoes

occur at the crest of fault blocks on top of the Renard

Ridge. Lazarillo de Tormes mud volcano, is 500 m

wide and 25 m high. No cores were taken at these

mud volcanoes. In general, both mud volcano setting

seem associated with extensional faults at the crest of

the Renard Ridge anticline.

4.5. Interpretation

On seismic sections, the mud volcanoes consist of

a columnar zone without coherent acoustic informa-

tion, about the width of the mud volcanic cone (Fig.

4). Large mud flows emerging from this central zone

are also free of reflections, but show a sharp transi-

Fig. 10. Side scan sonar mosaic over the Gemini and Fiu?za mud volcanoes with superimposed bathymetry. The entire mud volcano is about 200

m high, 4.88 km long to 2.5 km wide at the base, the diameter at the top of the eastern part is 0.9 km and the diameter of the western part is 0.6

km. The summits consist of a flat area with a central dome of respectively 20 and 30 m above the flat top. Fiu?za mud volcano is 60 m high, 2.2

km wide at the base and has a flat top of about 600 m wide with a central dome of 10–18 m high and about 300 m wide.

P. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1–17 11
tion to the surrounding sediments. The mud flow

deposits are typically lens-shaped, convex at the

top and often fill a moat at the base of the mud

volcano. In the subsurface, the same pattern returns

at several levels bounded by local unconformities

(Fig. 4). Stacked outflow lenses produce the typical

Christmas-tree morphology of long-lived mud volca-

noes, similar to other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of

Cadiz (Somoza et al., 2002). On the seismic data

only the tips of the largest outflow deposits are

visible and probably represent only the largest extru-

sion events. The lateral dimensions of feeder channel

and outflow deposits in the subsurface cannot be

measured due to acoustic blanking under almost

the entire width of the present-day mud volcano.

3D seismic data in other mud volcanic provinces

have demonstrated that the width of the feeder chan-

nel is probably much smaller than the zone affected

by acoustic blanking or by chaotic reflections (Van

Rensbergen et al., 1999).

Moats at the base of mud volcanoes are mostly

interpreted as subsidence rims related to volume reduc-
tion caused by degassing and sediment removal (Prior

et al., 1989; Camerlenghi et al. 1995). However, high-

resolution seismic profiles across these moats show the

details of a cut-and-fill facies, indicating erosion by

currents. Somoza et al. (2002) also suggest that the

moats are caused by erosional currents deflected by

the mud volcano cone. For the El Arraiche mud volca-

no field, Van Rensbergen et al. (2005) suggest erosion

in combination with subsidence; subsidence rims can

be deepened by current or smoothed by sediment fill.

The subsidence rims do not evolve into sediment with-

drawal synclines but are filled by mud flows and lay-

ered hemi-pelagic sediments and re-appear higher in

the section at a slightly different position.

Episodic mud extrusion created vertical columns of

remoulded mud up to 500 m below the top of the mud

volcanoes. The deepest observed occurrence of mud

extrusion deposits is underlain by a regional unconfor-

mity. The unconformity, between 450 and 1250 ms

TWT (or about 350 and 900 m below sea level),

bears witness to a wide-spread erosional event and is

the base for a seemingly continuous succession of deep



P. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1–1712
water sediments. This basal unconformity is interpreted

to correspond to an important sea level low stand at 2.4

Ma (Herna?ndez-Molina et al., 2002). This estimated

date is well within the age limits obtained by correla-

tion with a near-by industrial well LAR-1 (Flinch et al.,

1996), and yields a reasonable sedimentation rate of

about 10 cm/ka. The interpreted age (2.4 Ma) of the

regional unconformity can be regarded as an upper

estimate for the duration of the mud volcano activity

in the El Arraiche field.

The time–structure map of this basal unconformity

(Fig. 5) shows the structural highs and younger normal

faults at the crests. Fault interpretation from the seismic

sections is difficult due to the fact that data quality at the

mud volcanoes and ridges is not optimal. The bathym-

etry data show much better the geometry of active

faults. Steep escarpments are drawn from sea floor

dip maps on the shaded relief map of the study area

Also the Vernadsky Ridge and Renard Ridge anticlines

are not continuous structures but appear almost as an

den-echellonT succession of curved sections, disrupted
by 2–3 km wide NW–SE trending deformation zones.

From the seismic data, it appears that these deformation

zones are associated with increased subsidence and

collapse of the anticlines.

seismic profiles only penetrate the upper 500 m and in

this case only image the extrusive part of the mud

volcano system. Moreover, the subsurface immediately

below the mud volcanoes is almost entirely blanked.

Only mud breccia clasts from the mud volcanoes bear

witness of the stratigraphy that was traversed by the

mud volcano feeder system. Petrographic studies of

mud breccia clasts retrieved from Al Idrissi and Mer-

cator mud volcanoes by Akhmanov et al. (2002) situate

the mud volcano field over an Upper Miocene–Plio-

cene sedimentary basin. Smaller limestone clasts indi-

cate that the mud volcano feeder system probably roots

in or below Upper Cretaceous–Miocene rocks, similar

to the other mud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz

(Akhmanov et al., 2002; Ovsyannikov et al., 2003).

Upper Miocene–Pliocene clasts were of exception-

ally large size, which indicates the shallow position of

Upper Miocene–Pliocene rocks in this area. On basis

of the near-by exploration well LAR-1 and its corre-

lation with industrial 2D seismic lines (Flinch, 1993),

the top Pliocene and top Miocene at the Al Idrissi mud

volcano are estimated to occur respectively at about

150 and 900 m below the sea floor. The base of the

Upper Miocene was not encountered in the 2400 m

deep LAR-1 drill hole. Hence, the distance of vertical

transport of the large blocks ranges from 370 m (the

depth to top Pliocene plus the height of the mud

volcano) to over a kilometre.

The source of overpressure seems to be, at least

partly, related to pore fluid volume expansion during

thermogenic gas generation (Barker, 1990). The large

mud volcanoes (Al Idrissi, Gemini, Mercator and

Fiu?za) bears witness of repetitive sediment extrusion

and growth since they appeared about 2.4 Ma ago. Gas

generation in Mesozoic source rocks and focussed fluid

flow along the basal detachment of the accretionary

wedge both provide possible sources for sustained and

repeated fluid injection into the overburden sediments,

probably increased by periods of tectonic compression.

Geochemical analysis of gravity cores on the mud

volcanoes (Table 2) yielded hydrocarbon gasses from

thermogenic origin in the crater of Gemini West and

gasses from mixed thermogenic/biogenic in the craters

of Fiu?za and Gemini East mud volcanoes, the latter was

interpreted by Bileva and Blinova (2002) as evidence

for a longer period of inactivity. Hydrocarbon gasses

with thermogenic signature were also retrieved from

Ginsberg mud volcano, down slope of the El Arraiche

field (Mazurenko et al., 2002).

5.2. Mud volcano activity

The notion of present-day activity of mud volca-

noes depends on whether fluid or sediment expulsion

is considered. Both processes occur at mud volcanoes

and they are closely related given that fluid flow is the

main cause of subsurface sediment mobilisation (see

discussion by Van Rensbergen et al., 2003). But both

fluid seepage and sediment extrusion activity are dif-

ficult to assess and conclusions can diverge as is

illustrated below. Table 2 summarizes the indications

of mud volcano activity for the main mud volcanoes

in the El Arraiche field. The time since the last

sediment extrusion is indicated by the thickness of

hemi-pelagic sediments that cover mud breccia at the

crater. Our observations indicate that most recent

crater-wide sediment extrusion occurred at Al Idrissi

and Gemini West mud volcanoes. At Mercator mud

volcano, recent extrusion seems to have occurred only

in a narrow zone at the crest of the central dome (Van

Rensbergen et al., 2005). The activity of gas seepage

can be deduced from the depth of the sulfate reduction

zone (SRZ) and by the occurrence of typical seep

fauna. Al Idrissi and Gemini West are the most active

mud volcanoes; there is no or little pelagic drape, the

SRZ is shallowest and the methane concentrations in

the sediments are high. It is remarkable that the C1/

C2+ ratio at Al Idrissi is typical for biogenic methane

whereas Gemini West has C1/C2+ ratio typical for

thermogenic methane.

5.3. Structural control on mud volcano occurrences

and its implications for hydrocarbon exploration

The Vernadsky Ridge anticline and the anticline

below Al Idrissi mud volcano continue into the shelf

area where they were mapped by Flinch (1993) on

basis of regional seismic lines. Flinch et al. (1996)

mapped listric faults over Miocene thrust anticlines

that bound large Pliocene extensional basins (Fig. 12).

Similar Pliocene extensional basins have been identi-

fied on regional seismic lines in the central Gulf of

Cadiz (IAM-T3 line in Gracia et al., 2003 and in

Medialdea et al., 2004). They formed at the back of

the advancing sheets (Medialdea et al., 2004), proba-

bly facilitated by the mobilisation of Triassic evapor-

ites and Miocene shales (Maestro et al., 2003).

The structural setting of the El Arraiche field is

thus very different from the GDR, Tasyo and DPM

mud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz and the

geographical division in mud volcano fields also has

geological relevance. A generalized line drawing

along a NW–SE transect illustrates the structural set-

ting of the different mud volcano fields (Fig. 12). The

GDR mud volcano field is located at the north-west-

ern margin of the Tortonian olistostrome and at the

major fold and thrust belt in this area (Gracia et al.,

2003). Large thrusts faults are known to focus fluid

flow at the base of the accretionary system. These

fluids are likely to move upwards along stacked steep

inverse faults at the front thrust zone (GDR field) or at

thrust anticlines within the olistostrome unit (TASYO

field en DPM field). At places, mud volcanoes are

interpreted to overlie diapirs of Miocene plastic marly

clays of the olistostrome unit (Maldonado et al., 1999;

Somoza et al., 2003). The olistostrome unit is densely

fractured, thrust anticlines are not continuous and very

irregular, hence mud volcano distribution seems ran-

dom. Pinheiro et al. (2002) indicate that mud volca-

noes seemed aligned along a conjugate fault system

with NW–SE and NE–SW direction, probably strike-

slip faults. In any case, the influence of the intensely

deformed allochthonous units on the distribution of

mud volcanoes and fluid escape features is dominant.

The SPM mud volcano field and the El Arraiche field

are located outside the main olistostrome unit. Here,

most compressional structures are buried below a

seals accretionary complex structures of Miocene age

(Gracia et al., 2003).

The mud volcanoes seem to be located within

extensional fault zones, which facilitate vertical up-

ward fluid and sediment injections. The exact location

of the mud volcanoes depends on the local and re-

gional stress directions. Mercator mud volcano, the

buried mud volcano south of Mercator mud volcano,

and Fiu?za mud volcano seem to occur within a NE–

SW trending deformation zone. Kidd and Adamastor

mud volcanoes, and probably a smaller one just south

of Adamastor, also appear to occur within a NE–SW

oriented deformation zone, almost parallel to the col-

lapse depression that host the Mercator mud volcano

(Fig. 11). Sediment injections will occur along fault

sections or fractures perpendicular to the direction of

minimum horizontal stress (Tingay et al., 2003). Since

the anticlines are most likely compressional struc-

tures, sediment injections are expected to occur

along fault zones perpendicular to the anticline.

occurs at the Spanish shelf where Spain’s largest gas

field, the Poseidon field, produced N500 million Nm
3

of natural gas in 2002 (Mineco, 2003). The Moroccan

and Portuguese margins are largely under explored,

only 5 wildcats were drilled at the Portuguese margin

in the Algarve basin (IGM, 2003) and 1 at the Mor-

occan shelf offshore the city of Larache (ONAREP,

2003). In the entire Gulf of Cadiz only 7 exploration

wells were drilled at water depths N200 m. The main

hydrocarbon source rock is Early to Middle Jurassic

oil and gas prone shale. Oil generation was estimated

to occur since Toarcian times (ONAREP, 2003). The

most important reservoir rocks are Jurassic reefal

build-ups and Cretaceous deltaic sands. In the deep

water areas Tertiairy turbidites and carbonates are

considered to be possible reservoir rocks (ONAREP,

2003). Hydrocarbon exploration in the Gulf of Cadiz

is hampered by the intense deformation and nappes

emplacement since the Tortonian. Mud volcanoes in

the entire Gulf of Cadiz seem to root in Cretacous to

Miocene rocks (Akhmanov et al., 2002), below or

within the olistostrome units. Somoza et al. (1999)

suggest large possible hydrocarbon accumulations

below the salt-floored olistostrome units. In the cen-

tral part of the Gulf of Cadiz the structural deforma-

tion extends up to the sediment surface and controls

the distribution of mud volcanoes in the GDR, Tasyo
and DPM mud volcano fields. This may indicate a

redistribution of hydrocarbon fluids from deeper

sources along several fault-controlled pathways

through the allochthonous complex. In the SPM and

the El Arraiche mud volcanoes fields, most of accre-

tionary wedge thrust anticlines are sealed by a thick

Pliocene section and may host considerable hydroca-

bon accummulations. The area offshore El Arraiche

remains poorly tested for hydrocarbon accummula-

tions but seems to have very good potential.
6. Conclusions

The newly discovered El Arraiche field at the

Moroccan Atlantic margin, Gulf of Cadiz, consists

of 8 mud volcanoes of varying size and shape just

below the Moroccan shelf edge. The largest mud

volcano, Al Idrissi mud volcano, is 225 m high and

5.3 km in diameter, the smallest observed mud vol-

cano is only 25 m high and 500 m wide. The mud

volcanoes seem to be associated with extensional

faults with quickly varying throw and strike that

compartmentalize anticlinal ridges. The anticlines

can be traced regionally and bound extensional basins

that formed during the Late Miocene.

The El Arraiche mud volcano field is part of a

larger cluster of mud volcanoes (the Spanish Moroc-

can Field, Gardner, 2001) that lie within the accre-

tionary realm but outside the active olistostrome units.

This distinction is clear on regional seismic lines

(Gracia et al., 2003; Medialdea et al., 2004) but it

also has bearings on the composition and the size of

rock clasts in the mud volcanoes (Akhmanov et al.,

2002). As other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz

(Somoza et al., 2002), the El Arraiche mud volcanoes

are long-lived structures thought to be related to the

episodic migration of hydrocarbons. Onset of mud

volcanic activity in the El Arraiche field is estimated

at about 2.4 Ma. Since the Upper Pliocene, episodic

expulsion of liquidized sediment created vertical piles

of extruded mud of up to 500 m thick.

The occurrence of large mud volcanoes bears wit-

ness of continued overpressure generation at depth,

either by in situ oil and gas generation or by focussed

flow and accumulation in the area. The activity of the

mud volcanoes is indicated by the thickness of hemi-

pelagic sediments covering extruded mud breccia, the



P. Van Rensbergen et al. / Marine Geology 219 (2005) 1–1716
occurrence of seep-typical fauna, the degree of mixing

between thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons, or

the depth of the sulphate reduction zone. These indica-

tions give variable results. Gemini West and Al Idrissi

mud volcanoes are most active, as they lack a hemi-

pelagic sediment drape, feature a shallow sulphate

reduction zone, high concentrations of methane, and

living Pogonophora worms. The ratio of methane con-

centration over the concentration of higher homologues

gives a biogenic gas source in case of the Al Idrissi mud

volcano and a thermogenic signature for the Gemini

West crater. The eastern twin crater, Gemini East, was

the least active, covered by 12 cm of hemi-pelagic mud.

Given its structural setting and the evidence of thermo-

genic hydrocarbons, the area has promising hydrocar-

bon potential but remains untested.

Abstract

The Gulf of Cadiz is a tectonically active area of the European continental margin and characterised by a high abundance of mud
volcanoes, diapirs, pockmarks and carbonate chimneys. During the R/V SONNE expedition ‘‘GAP–Gibraltar Arc Processes (SO-
175)’’ in December 2003, several mud volcanoes were surveyed for gas seepage and associated microbial methane turnover. Pore water
analyses and methane oxidation measurements on sediment cores recovered from the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov,
Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and a newly discovered, mud volcano-like structure called ‘‘No Name’’ show that thermogenic methane
and associated higher hydrocarbons rising from deeper sediment strata are completely consumed within the seabed. The presence of a
distinct sulphate–methane transition zone (SMT) overlapping with high sulphide concentrations suggests that methane oxidation is med-
iated under anaerobic conditions with sulphate as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction
(SR) rates show maxima at the SMT, which was found between 20 and 200 cm below seafloor at the different mud volcanoes. In com-
parison to other methane seeps, AOM activity (&lt;383 mmol m?2 year?1) and diffusive methane fluxes (&lt;321 mmol m?2 year?1) in mud
volcano sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz are low to mid range. Corresponding lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library analysis give
evidence that AOM is mediated by a mixed community of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and associated sulphate reducing bacteria
(SRB) in the studied mud volcanoes. Little is known about the variability of methane fluxes in this environment. Carbonate crusts
littering the seafloor of mud volcanoes in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz had strongly 13C-depleted lipid signatures indicative
of higher seepage activities in the past. However, actual seafloor video observations showed only scarce traces of methane seepage
and associated biological processes at the seafloor. No active fluid or free gas escape to the hydrosphere was observed visually at any
of the surveyed mud volcanoes, and biogeochemical measurements indicate a complete methane consumption in the seafloor. Our
observations suggest that the emission of methane to the hydrosphere from the mud volcano structures studied here may be insignificant
at present.

coupled to variations in atmospheric methane, are impor-
tant rationales of current biogeochemical research. Anthro-
pogenic sources as well as natural emission from wetlands
contribute significantly to the global emission of methane
to the atmosphere, but the role of the ocean in global meth-
ane fluxes is not well understood (Reeburgh, 1996; Judd
et al., 2002). Recently, marine mud volcanism has been
identified as an important escape pathway for methane

Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5337
and higher hydrocarbons (Dimitrov, 2002; Judd et al.,
2002; Dimitrov, 2003). Mud volcanism is caused by various
geological processes at continental margins such as tectonic
accretion and faulting, rapid burial of sediments and emis-
sion of gases and fluids. Such processes may lead to high
pore fluid pressures and sediment instabilities, and conse-
quently cause mud extrusions. Since subsurface muds and
shales of productive continental margins often contain
methane and other hydrocarbons of thermogenic and/or
microbial origin, mud flows can be accompanied by gas
expulsion (Milkov, 2000; Kopf, 2002; Charlou et al.,
2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Mud volcanoes (MVs) are
structurally diverse, ranging in shape from amorphous
mud pies to conical structures, and in size from a few
metres to kilometres in diametre, attaining heights of up
to a few 100 m (Dimitrov, 2002; Kopf, 2002). While there
are only 650–900 known terrestrial mud volcanoes (Kopf,
2003), global estimates for marine mud volcanoes range be-
tween 800 and 100,000 (Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002,
2003; Kopf, 2003; Milkov et al., 2003). It is unknown
how many of these submarine mud volcanoes are actively
emitting methane to the hydrosphere. As a result, global
estimates of methane emissions from these structures vary
considerably. Recent estimates suggest that terrestrial and
shallow water mud volcanoes contribute between 2.2 and
6 Tg year?1 of methane to the atmosphere (Dimitrov,
2003; Milkov et al., 2003) and that 27 Tg year?1 of meth-
ane may escape from deep water mud volcanoes (Milkov
et al., 2003). Revised estimates of the total methane emis-
sion from MVs ranges between 35 and 45 Tg year?1 (Eti-
ope and Milkov, 2004), 30 and 70 Tg year?1 (Etiope and
Klusman, 2002), and—when using only known MVs and
correcting for size of the edifice—between 0.3 (Kopf,
2003) and 1.4 Tg year?1 (Kopf, 2002). Clearly, a better
understanding of mud volcano activity and methane turn-
over at these structures is needed, to evaluate the contribu-
tion of mud volcanism to the total annual methane
emission to the atmosphere (535 Tg year?1, Judd et al.,
2002).

The main sink for methane in the ocean is the anaerobic
oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulphate as the terminal
electron acceptor (Barnes and Goldberg, 1976; Reeburgh,
1976; Iversen and Jørgensen, 1985; Hinrichs and Boetius,
2002; Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2003). This pro-
cess is mediated by archaea, operating most likely in coop-
eration with sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) (Hinrichs
et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001). So
far, two groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea
(ANME-1, ANME-2) have been identified (Hinrichs
et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001;
Michaelis et al., 2002; Knittel et al., 2005). They usually oc-
cur together with SRB from a distinct, yet uncultivated
cluster within the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group
(Seep-SRB1; Knittel et al., 2003). Generally, microbial
methane oxidation is characterised by a strong discrimina-
tion against the heavy, stable carbon isotope 13C, leading
to a significant depletion in the 13C-content of metabolites
and biomass (Reeburgh and Heggie, 1977; Whiticar et al.,
1986; Summons et al., 1994; Elvert et al., 1999; Thiel et al.,
1999; Whiticar, 1999; Orphan et al., 2001). Such conspicu-
ous isotope signatures of lipid biomarkers for the archaeal
and bacterial partners in AOM mediating communities
have been a main tool in studying the diversity and func-
tioning of cold seep ecosystems (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Pan-
cost et al., 2000; Elvert et al., 2001; Orphan et al., 2001;
Michaelis et al., 2002; Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg
et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2005). Ac-
tive mud volcanoes in the Mediterranean Sea, e.g. Napoli,
Amsterdam and Kazan (Pancost et al., 2000; Aloisi et al.,
2002; Haese et al., 2003; Werne et al., 2004); the Black
Sea, e.g. Dvurechenskii and Odessa (Bohrmann et al.,
2003; Stadnitskaia et al., 2005); and the Barents Sea, e.g.
Ha?kon Mosby (Vogt et al., 1997a,b; Damm and Bude?us,
2003; De Beer et al., 2006) are characterised by steep gradi-
ents of pore water solutes due to upward fluid and gas flow
and high rates of AOM and sulphate reduction (SR). Sev-
eral of these geo-bio-systems were also found to support
enormous biomasses of chemosynthetic symbiotic tube-
worms and bivalves, which are fuelled by methane and/or
sulphide, and mats of giant sulphide oxidising bacteria,
(Southward et al., 1981; Fisher, 1990; Olu et al., 1997a;
Gebruk et al., 2003).

During the UNESCO program ‘‘Training through Re-
search (TTR)’’ with R/V Prof. Logachev, numerous mud
volcanoes hosting methane-hydrate were discovered in
the Gulf of Cadiz (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001;
Kenyon et al., 2001; Mazurenko et al., 2002; Somoza
et al., 2002; Pinheiro et al., 2003). However, the geochem-
ical and microbiological activity of these potential seep
structures and the occurrence of methane emission to the
hydrosphere remained unknown. As part of the Gibraltar
Arch Project (GAP), we studied several mud volcanoes
with the aid of seafloor video imaging as well as video-
guided sampling of sediments and carbonate crusts during
a cruise with R/V Sonne in 2003 (SO-175). The main goals
of this investigation were to survey the occurrence of meth-
ane seepage at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, to com-
pare the distribution and magnitude of AOM by rate
measurements and diffusive flux calculations, as well as to
identify the key methanotrophs using lipid biomarker and
16S rDNA methods.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Geological setting and videographic observations

The Gulf of Cadiz is located west of the Gibraltar Arc,
between Iberia and the African plate (Fig. 1). This area has
experienced a complex tectonic history with several epi-
sodes of extension, strike-slip and compression related to
the closure of the Tethys Ocean, the opening of the N-At-
lantic, and the African–Eurasian convergence since the
Cenozoic (Maldonado et al., 1999). During the Tortonian,
a large olistrostome body made of eroded material from

the Betic Cordillera (Spain) and Rif Massif (Morocco) was
emplaced west of the Straits of Gibraltar (Maldonado and
Comas, 1992; Somoza et al., 2003). Due to the ongoing
compression, these rapidly deposited sediments dewater
intensely and form MVs and fluid escape structures
(Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003). The Gulf of Cadiz has been
intensely surveyed with geophysical tools, leading to the
discovery of the first MVs, mud diapirs and pockmarks
in 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2000; Gardner, 2001; Pinheiro
et al., 2003). In addition, an extensive field of mud volca-
noes and diapiric structures covered with carbonate chim-
neys and crusts was discovered along or in close
proximity of the main channels of the Mediterranean out-
flow water (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Diaz-Del-Rio et al.,
2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Kopf et al., 2004).

In the present study, Captain Arutyunov (Capt. Arutyu-
nov), Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini, Hesperides and Faro
MV and a newly discovered structure termed ‘‘No Name’’,
were investigated (Fig. 1, Table 1). Prior to biogeochemical
sampling, a few transects across the selected MVs were sur-
veyed with the video-sled Ocean Floor Observation System
(OFOS), or with a video-guided multiple-corer (MUC, Ta-
ble 1). Both systems are equipped with powerful lamps and
a video camera. Video observations were made from a ver-
tical perspective at ca. 1–2 m above the sea bottom to mon-
itor an area of approximately 1 m2. The systems were
passively towed at minimum speed (&lt;1.84 km h?1) along
2–3 transects of 1–3 km crossing the rim and apex of the
edifices with a total bottom observation time of approxi-
mately 8 h per mud volcano (Table 1, Kopf et al., 2004).
The video-guided MUC was also used to select representa-
tive sampling positions and to retrieve undisturbed surface
sediments (next section).

2.2. Sample collection and storage

Sediments from several mud volcanoes were sampled by
gravity coring in the central crater region (Table 1, Fig. 2),
retrieving up to 5 m of sediment. Additionally, surface sed-
iments of Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were ob-
tained with a video-guided MUC because the top
decimetres of sediment cover are often lost during gravity
core retrieval. Video-guided MUC sampling enabled the
retrieval of undisturbed surface sediments of up to 50 cm
sediment depth. With this method, the seafloor can be ob-
served when the MUC is towed at minimum speed at about
1–2 m above bottom. The MUC is launched immediately
when targeted seafloor structures are observed. Compared
to the gravity core, MUC-cores contained a broader hori-
zon of hemipelagic surface sediments providing further evi-
dence for a loss of surface sediments during gravity coring.
To account for this loss, we aligned the depth of gravity
cores obtained from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim
MV according to the vertical sulphate profiles of MUC-
cores recovered from one site, assuming that sulphate con-
centrations are mainly a function of depth in proximate
cores. According to this procedure, the top of the gravity
cores recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim

central conduit below the mud volcanoes and sampling position of the cores recovered during the SO-175 expedition. Captain Arutyunov and Bonjardim
MV are conical shaped structures with a relief of 80 and 100 m and a diametre of ca. 2 and 1 km, respectively. Colours denote the bathymetry (m below sea
surface). Seismic images were modified after Kenyon et al. (2001) (a) and Pinheiro et al. (2003) (b).

Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5339
MV were from 40 to 12.5 cm sediment depth, respectively.
Aligning proximate core sections is an approach to
account for a loss of an unknown quantity of surface
sediments during gravity coring. However, this can be
problematic if the spatial variability of geochemical gradi-
ents is high.

Upon recovery, gravity cores were sectioned into 1 m
pieces, which were cut longitudinally into halves, just be-
fore sub sampling. All cores were immediately transferred
into a cold room and subsampled for concentration mea-
surements of pore water constituents (methane, sulphate,
sulphide), AOM and SR rate measurements as well as for
lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA analyses (Table 1). Sedi-
ments for measurements of methane and sulphate concen-
trations and turnover rate measurements were subsampled
vertically with push cores (acrylic core liners, 26 mm dia-
metre, n = 3) from MUC-cores (Jørgensen, 1978; Treude
et al., 2003). Gravity cores were subsampled by plugging



5340 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336–5355
glass tubes (60 mm length, 10 mm diametre, n = 5) into
selected ca. 10 cm wide sediment horizons (every 20–
30 cm). The tubes were then sealed with butyl rubber stop-
pers to prevent gas loss during the anaerobic incubation.
Sediment samples for pore water extraction, biomarker
and 16S rDNA analyses were collected from 2 cm sections
of MUC-cores and from ca. 10 cm wide sediment horizons
(every 20–30 cm) of gravity core sections. Directly after
subsampling, pore water from these sediment horizons
was extracted by pressure filtration (5 bars) through Teflon
squeezers provided with 0.2 lm cellulose acetate filters
according to previous works (Reeburgh, 1967; Niewo?hner
et al., 1998; Hensen et al., 2003). Subsequently, the pore
water was immediately fixed (next section). Lipid and
DNA samples were stored in cleaned glass vials at
?20 ?C until extraction in the home laboratory. Carbonate
crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV were collected with a
video-guided grab-sampler (Table 1). Because Hesperides
MV consist of six individual cones, the grab sample was
taken from the apex of the highest (north-eastern) summit.
The grab-sampler allows to retrieve samples down to a
depth of ca. 0.5 m below seafloor (bsf). The videographic
observation and sampling procedure is similar to the tech-
nique used for video-guided coring as explained above.
Upon recovery, carbonate crusts for lipid biomarker anal-
yses were transferred into plastic bags and stored at ?20 ?C
until extraction.

2.3. Methane concentrations

Methane concentrations in sediments were determined
according to the ‘‘head space’’ method from 5 ml sediment
fixed with 10 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v) in glass vials (20 ml) as
described previously by Treude and co-workers (2003). A
vertical resolution of 2 cm was chosen for surface samples
from MUC-cores, and of 20–30 cm for subsurface samples
from gravity cores. The concentrations presented here are
ex situ methane concentrations. As a result of depressurisa-
tion and warming of the core during sediment retrieval,
concentrations above 1.4 mM (saturation at 1 bar and
4 ?C) would have led to degassing during retrieval and sed-
iment subsampling. Also, dissociation of gas hydrates upon
recovery may lead to biased methane concentrations in the
cores. We tried to minimise the problem by (a) subsampling
immediately after opening the core, and (b) subsampling of
deeper sediments below the longitudinal opening plane of
the gravity core with glass syringes. Methane concentra-
tions were determined shortly after the cruise (&lt;2 month)
from 200 ll aliquots of the head space using a gas chro-
matograph (5890A, Hewlett Packard) equipped with a
packed stainless steal Porapak-Q column (6 ft., 0.125 in,
80/100 mesh, Agilent Technologies) and a flame ionisation
detector (Treude et al., 2003). The carrier gas was helium at
a flow rate of 30 ml min?1. The column temperature was
40 ?C. The chromatography system was calibrated for a
concentration range of 0.001–5 mM methane (final concen-
tration in the sediment). Sediment samples from Capt.
Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were additionally analysed
for the concentrations of the higher hydrocarbons (C2+)
ethane, propane, isobutene and butane (Rbutane) using
the above-described chromatography setting with a tem-
perature gradient. Subsequent to injection at 40 ?C, the
temperature was increased at a rate of 2 ?C min?1 to
200 ?C and held for 20 min. Identity and concentrations
of methane and C2+-compounds were determined with
standards of known hydrocarbon compositions.

2.4. Sulphate and sulphide concentrations

Sulphate and sulphide concentrations were analysed
according to modified methods from Cline (1969) and
Small et al. (1975), respectively, as described elsewhere
(Grasshoff et al., 1983). Briefly, sulphide concentrations
were determined immediately after pore water squeezing
by adding 1 ml of pore water to 50 ll of a zinc acetate gel-
atine solution. Zinc acetate gelatine solution consists of
50 mg gelatine and 261 mg ZnAc dissolved in 25 ml O2-free
water. Sulphide was quantitatively removed as ZnS and
kept in colloidal solution. After adding 10ll of 4% N,N-di-
methyl-1,4-phenylenediamine-dihydrochloride dissolved in
6 N HCl (w/v), the concentration was determined photo-
metrically by measuring the absorbance after 1 h at
670 nm. Sulphate concentrations were determined on 2 ml
subsamples of filtered pore water using a Sykam-S ion
chromatography system equipped with an anion exchange
column (LCA A14). 7.5 mM Na2CO3-solution was used as
an eluent at a flow rate of 1.75 ml min?1. Samples were
diluted by 1:54 with the eluent prior to injection. Sulphate
concentrations were determined with a Sykam S3110 con-
ductivity detector.

2.5. Diffusive flux calculations

Diffusive fluxes were calculated to compare areal rates of
AOM and SR, to estimate the activity of Ginsburg and
Gemini mud volcano as well as the No Name structure
and to compare the surveyed systems to other seeps in
the world oceans. This approach bears several problems,
namely potential artefacts in the ex situ concentrations of
porewater species due to degassing, the assumption of stea-
dy state in the porewater system, and the alignment of sed-
iment cores. At Bonjardim mud volcano, the alignment of
pore water profiles was discontinuous, while the resolution
of pore water gradients was not well resolved at Ginsburg
and Gemini mud volcano. Where possible, we determined
two concentration gradients: one from the aligned profile
and the other from the profile of the gravity core in order
to provide a possible range of the sulphate and sulphide
fluxes.

Local fluxes (J) were calculated from the vertical profiles
of pore water constituents (methane, sulphate, sulphide)
according to Fick’s first law of diffusion assuming steady
state conditions (e.g. Niewo?hner et al., 1998; Berner, 1980
and references therein):

For each mud volcano, D0 values were corrected for tem-

temperature), resulting in values ranging between 291 to

and sulphide, respectively (Boudreau, 1997). / was deter-
mined from the weight loss per volume of wet sediment

creased with depth showing values of 57–76% in the top
sections and 51–60% in the bottom sections of the retrieved
MUC- and GC-cores (data shown for the SMT, Table 2).

2.6. Ex situ AOM and SR rate measurements

Sediment for turnover rate measurements recovered
from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were incubated
on board according to previously described methods
(Jørgensen, 1978; Treude et al., 2003; Treude et al.,
2005). Briefly, 25 ll 14CH4 (dissolved in water, 2.5 kBq)
or 5 ll 35SO4

2? tracer (dissolved in water, 50 kBq) were
injected into butyl rubber sealed glass tubes from gravity
core subsampling, and in 1 cm intervals into small push
cores (whole core injection) used for MUC-core subsam-
pling. Incubations were carried out for 24 h at in situ tem-
perature in the dark. Subsequently, incubated AOM and
SR rate samples were fixed in 25 ml NaOH (2.5%, w/v)
and 25 ml zinc acetate solution (20%, w/v), respectively.
Further processing of AOM and SR rate samples was per-
formed according to Treude et al. (2003) and references
therein. Turnover rates were calculated according to the
following formulas:

pare ex situ microbial rates with the diffusive fluxes of
methane and sulphate, AOM and SR rates were integrated
over depth (0–80 cm below seafloor) from the alignments
of cores 9036-2 and 9041-4 as well as 9051-1 and 9051-2,
respectively. Ex situ rate measurements may differ from
in situ rates due to the effect of depressurisation on concen-
trations of gaseous and dissolved components.
2.7. Extraction of sediment and carbonate samples and

preparation of derivates

Sediments from Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV as
well as carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV
were analysed for lipid biomarker signatures. The extrac-
tion procedure and preparation of fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMES) was carried out according to previously de-
scribed methods (Gillian et al., 1981; Elvert et al., 2003;
Niemann et al., 2005). Briefly, total lipid extracts (TLE)
were obtained from ca. 20 g of wet sediment and from
authigenic carbonates disintegrated with HCL (2 M) prior
to extraction. The TLE was extracted by subsequent ultra-
sonication using organic solvents of decreasing polarity
(dichloromethane/methanol (1:2, v/v), dichloromethane/
methanol (2:1 v/v), dichloromethane). Internal standards
of known concentration and carbon isotopic compositions
were added prior to extraction. Fatty acid moieties present
in glyco and phospholipids were cleaved by saponification
with methanolic KOH-solution. After extraction of the
neutral lipid fraction from this mixture, fatty acids (FAs)
were methylated with BF3 in methanol yielding FAMES.
Double bond positions of monoenoic FAs were determined
grated over depth

and Lambertfair, 1989).

Neutral lipids were further separated into hydrocarbons,
ketones and alcohols on a SPE silica glass cartridge (0.5 g
packing) with solvents of increasing polarity (n-hexane/di-
chloromethane (95:5, v/v), n-hexane/dichloromethane (2:1,
v/v), dichloromethane/acetone (9:1, v/v)) (Niemann et al.,
2005). Alcohols were derivatised with bis(trimethylsilyl)tri-
flouracetamid (BSTFA) forming trimethylsilyl (TMS)
ethers prior to analyses.

2.8. Gas chromatography

Concentrations of single lipid compounds were deter-
mined by gas chromatography analysis using a Varian
30 m apolar CP-Sil 8 CB fused silica capillary (0.25 mm
internal diametre [ID], film thickness 0.25 lm) in a Hewlett
Packard 6890 Series gas chromatograph equipped with an
on column injector and a flame ionisation detector. Initial
oven temperature was 80 ?C. Subsequently to injection, the
initial temperature was increased to 130 ?C at a rate of
20 ?C min?1, then raised to 320 ?C at a rate of
4 ?C min?1and held at 320 ?C for 30 min. The carrier was
helium at a constant flow of 2 ml min?1 and the detector
temperature was set to 310 ?C. Concentrations were calcu-
lated relative to internal standards present within the
respective lipid fraction.

2.9. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS),
gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry

(GC-IRMS)

Identity and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual
compounds were determined by GC-MS and GC-IRMS
analysis, respectively. Instrument specifications and opera-
tion modes of the GC-MS and GC-IRMS units were set
according to Elvert et al. (2003). Identities of acquired mass
spectra were compared to known standards and published
data. Stable isotope ratios are given in the d-notation
against Pee Dee Belemnite. d13C-values of FAs and alco-
hols were corrected for the introduction of additional car-
bon atoms during derivatisation. Internal standards were
used to monitor precision and reproducibility during mea-
surements. Reported d13C-values have an analytical error
of ±1&amp;amp;.

2.10. DNA extraction and clone library construction

Total community DNA was extracted from sediments
(ca. 1 g) collected from the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV
(30–40 cm) using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Bio-
gene, Irvine, California, USA). Samples were bead-beat
in a Fastprep machine (Q-Biogene, Irvine, California,
USA) at speed 4.5 for 30 s. All other steps in the DNA
extraction procedure were preformed according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Almost full-length
archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified
from sediments samples using the primers 20f (Massana
et al., 1997) and Uni1392R (Lane et al., 1985) for Archaea
and GM3F (Muyzer et al., 1995) and GM4R (Kane et al.,
1993) for Bacteria. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs)
were performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Otsu Ja-
pan), using 2.5 U of enzyme, 1· Buffer, 4 mM of MgCl2,
4 mM of each dNTP, 1 lM of each primer and 2 ll of tem-
plate in a 50 ll reaction. PCRs were preformed in a Mas-
tercycler machine (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), with
the following cycling conditions: 95 ?C for 2 min, then 30
cycles of 95 ?C for 30 s, 60 ?C (Archaea) or 50 ?C (Bacteria)
for 30 s and 72 ?C for 3 min, followed by a final incubation
step at 72 ?C for 10 min. PCR products were visualised on
an agarose gel, and the 16S band excised. PCR products
were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qia-
gen, Hilden, Germany). Two microliters of purified DNA
were ligated in the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Mad-
ison, WI) and transformed into competent E. coli TOP10
cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s recommendations. Transformation reactions were
plated on LB-agarose plates. Overnight cultures were pre-
pared from individual colonies picked from these plates
using the Montage Plasmid Miniprep 96 kit (Millipore,
Billerica, USA). Purified plasmids were sequenced in one
direction, with either the 958R (Archaea) or GM1F (Bacte-
ria) primers using the BigDye Terminator v3.0 Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Samples were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3100
Genetic Analyser (Foster City, USA). A total of 39 archa-
eal and 47 bacterial clones were partially sequenced
(?0.5 kb). Using the ARB software package, the sequences
were calculated into existing phylogentic trees by parsimo-
ny without allowing a change in the tree topology. Repre-
sentative sequences of each cluster were then fully
sequenced (?1.3 kb) and matched against the NCBI data-
base (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Sequences
were submitted to the Genbank database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and are accessible under the fol-
lowing Accession Nos.: DQ004661–DQ004676 and
DQ004678–DQ004680.

3. Results

3.1. Field observations

A detailed description of seafloor video observations,
sedimentology and sampling locations is provided in the
cruise report of R/V SONNE expedition SO-175 (Kopf
et al., 2004). The mud volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjar-
dim, Ginsburg, Gemini, and Faro studied here are cone
shaped structures with a relief of up to 200 m and a maxi-
mum diametre of 4.9 km (Fig. 2a, b; Table 1). Hesperides
MV has comparable dimensions but is composed of six
individual cones. A new structure was discovered east of
the TTR MV and termed ‘‘No Name’’ (Fig. 1). Video

Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5343
jardim, Ginsburg, Hesperides, and Faro did not reveal
indications for recent gas, fluid or mud expulsion during
the transects across the central craters of each structure.
The centres of Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim and Ginsburg
MV were covered with light beige sediments (shown for
Capt. Arutyunov MV, Fig. 3a). At Capt. Arutyunov
MV, some sediment stretches were scattered with accre-
tions, interpreted as mud clasts, which may indicate past
mud eruptions (Fig. 3b). At Ginsburg MV, a few small car-
bonate crusts (&lt;0.5 m) were observed on the seafloor. Be-
side these observations, no other distinctive geological or
biological features indicating gas or fluid seepage were vis-
ible on video images at Ginsburg MV. Surface sediments
recovered from Capt. Arutyunov MV contained very thin
tubeworms (diametre&amp;lt;1 mm), which extended down to
20 cm into the sediment. These were not visible on video
images due to their low abundance and small diametre.
Tubeworms are regarded as indicator species for reduced
environments because the known species harbour methane
or sulphide oxidising symbionts, indicating sulphide and/or
methane availability in the sediments (Southward et al.,
1981, 1986; Schmaljohann and Flugel, 1987; Sibuet and
Olu, 1998; Kimura et al., 2003; Southward et al., 2005).
The central areas of Hesperides and Faro MV were littered
with fragments of carbonate chimneys and carbonate
crusts (shown for Hesperides MV, Fig. 3c). Both, chimneys
and crusts were ranging in size from several centimetres to
metres in length and diametre, respectively. At Faro MV, a
few, small patches covered with microbial mats possibly
consisting of filamentous sulphide oxidising bacteria were

were found to be covered by pelagic sediments as shown in (a). The holes are bu
accretions that are interpreted as clasts (b) indicating past mud flows. Hesperid

observed (Fig. 3d). Moreover, TV-guided grab samples
recovered from this MV also contained a few specimens
of the deep-dwelling chemosynthetic clam Acharax sp. usu-
ally harbouring sulphide oxidising bacteria in their gills
(Felbeck, 1983; Krueger and Cavanaugh, 1997; Peek
et al., 1998; Sibuet and Olu, 1998). Video observations were
not carried out at Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’
structure.

The MUC-cores retrieved from Capt. Arutyunov and
Bonjardim MV contained yellowish, muddy sediments in
the top sections from 0 to 20 and 0 to 40 cm bsf, respective-
ly. The bottom sections of the MUC-cores contained mud
breccia, a mud matrix with clasts extruded from greater
depth below these edifices (Cita et al., 1981; Akhmanov
and Woodside, 1998). The gravity cores retrieved from
these MVs as well as those retrieved from Ginsburg and
Gemini also contained mud breccia. The gravity core
recovered from the ‘‘No Name’’ structure contained a ma-
trix of cold water coral fragments and greyish mud but no
mud breccia. Hence, the relation of the ‘‘No Name’’ geo-
structure to mud volcanism remains unknown. Grab sam-
ples from Hesperides and Faro MV contained carbonate
fragments and mud breccia. After recovery, the tempera-
ture in the top sediment section (?1 m) at Bonjardim
MV was ca. 3 ?C. In contrast, the temperature was consid-
erably higher at Capt. Arutyunov (12 ?C), Ginsburg MV,
Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure (10 ?C, respec-
tively) most probably as a result of the warm Mediterra-
nean outflow water, which contributes to the bottom
water at these MVs.

Methane concentrations in surface sediments (0–20 cm,
Fig. 4a) were&amp;lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete consump-
tion of methane rising from deeper sediment strata. A dis-
tinct SMT was observed in the lower half of the MUC-core
section (25–40 cm bsf.) with ex situ methane concentrations
above saturation at atmospheric pressure, and sulphate
concentrations dropping below 0.5 mM. The steepest gra-
dients of methane and sulphate found in this zone amount-
ed to 0.4 and ?1.12 lmol cm?4, respectively (Fig. 4a, Table
2). Small gas hydrate chips were found throughout the
whole gravity core section from 44 to 235 cm bsf (1941-
1). Similar to methane, concentrations of C2+-compounds
decreased across the SMT (Fig. 4b). Hydrocarbons in the
sediment comprised methane (&gt;99%), ethane (&lt;0.4%), pro-
pane (&lt;0.07%) with trace amounts of butane and isobutene
present indicating a thermogenic origin of these gases
(Nuzzo et al., 2005; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006 and references
therein). Sulphide concentrations peaked in the SMT with
4.8 mM at 39 cm bsf (Fig. 4d). The steepest sulphide gradi-
ent was 0.63 lmol cm?4 (Fig. 4d, Table 2). A downward
sulphide gradient could not be determined because highest
sulphide concentrations were observed in the lowest sedi-
ment horizon of the MUC-core at Capt. Arutyunov MV.
Unfortunately, the sulphide profile could not be aligned
with the gravity core section.

3.2.2. AOM, SR rates and diffusive fluxes
AOM and SR rates at Capt. Arutyunov MV were high-

est in the SMT at 39 cm bsf with maximum values of 11
and 25 nmol cm?3 d?1, respectively (Fig. 4c). AOM and
SR rates sharply decreased above and below this horizon.
Replicate AOM and SR rate measurements showed a stan-

higher hydrocarbons also decline (b). Note that AOM and SR rates (c), sulphid
diagnostic, bacterial fatty acids (f) and concentrations of isoprenoidal diethers
for methane, sulphate and sulphide (bold lines). Circles represent multiple-core
dard error of 33% and 37% of the average value, respective-
ly. The areal integration resulted in 1.8 higher SR rates
compared to AOM (Table 2). The areal AOM and SR rate
were in good agreement with diffusive flux calculations
showing a 1.7-fold higher sulphate flux compared to the
methane flux. The sulphide flux to the surface (upward
flux) was comparable to the total downward flux of sul-
phate (Table 2).

3.2.3. Lipid biomarker

Diagnostic archaeal and bacterial lipid concentrations
were strongly increased in sediments at the SMT (Fig. 4e, g).
Here, stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest deple-
tion in 13C with minimum values of ?92&amp;amp; (sn2-hydroxyar-
chaeol) in archaeal specific diether lipids and ?82&amp;amp;
(cyC17:0x5,6) in bacterial specific FAs (Table 3, Fig. 4f, g)
indicating the incorporation of methane derived carbon
in archaeal and bacterial biomass (sample from 31 cm
bsf). The concentration of both archaeal and bacterial lip-
ids decreased just above and below this sediment horizon.
At the SMT, the ratio of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to
archaeol was 1.6:1 (Table 3). Other diagnostic archaeal
isoprenoidal hydrocarbons such as 2,6,11,15-tetramethyl-
hexadecane (crocetane) could not be quantified due to an
unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons (UCM) in
all of the hydrocarbon fractions. Similarly, specific archa-
eal diethers and bacterial FAs could not be resolved from
this background below 40 cm sediment depth. The concen-
trations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were roughly one
order of magnitude lower in comparison to specific bacte-
rial FAs.

The FA fraction in sediments at the SMT was dominat-
ed by the FAs C16:1x5 and cyC17:0x5,6 which are putatively
specific for SRB involved in AOM (Elvert et al., 2003) and
contained comparably high amounts of the FA C17:1x6
was found between 25 and 40 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of
e concentrations (d), concentrations (e) and stable carbon isotope values of
(g) all peak at the SMT. (a) and (d) illustrate steepest gradients determined

MV as well as in carbonate crusts from Hesperides and Faro MV

Abundances of fatty acids were normalised to i-C15:0, archaeal diethers to
archaeol and archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons to PMI:0. Specific lipid
components are highlighted in grey.

Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5345
(Table 3). Both, C16:1x5 and cyC17:0x5,6 were the most
13C-

depleted FAs. However, all other FAs in the C14–C17 range
carried significantly 13C-depleted isotope signatures as well
with values ranging between ?65&amp;amp; (C16:1x9) and ?75&amp;amp;
(C14:0). C18-FAs were comparably enriched in

13C with
d13C-values ranging between ?25&amp;amp; (C18:0) and ?31&amp;amp;
(C18:1x7) most likely indicating a planktonic origin of these
compounds. Concentrations of mono- and dialkyl glycerol
ethers (MAGEs and DAGEs, respectively), presumably of
bacterial origin (Pancost et al., 2001), were low in all sam-
ples recovered during cruise SO-175. Thus, a detailed anal-
ysis of these compounds was not carried out. However,
sediments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV comprised
comparably high contents of MAGEs relative to DAGES
with d13C-values ranging from ?65&amp;amp; to ?85&amp;amp; (data not
shown). The MAGEs comprised a suite of alkyl moieties,
which is comparable to those of the fatty acids found at
Capt. Arutyunov MV. The suite of fatty acids extracted
from the tubeworms comprised dominant amounts of the
FAs C16:1x7 and C18:1x7 and to a lesser degree C16:0 and
C18:0 with uniform d

13C-values of about ?40&amp;amp;, indicating
chemoautotrophic carbon fixation (data not shown). The
alcohol and hydrocarbon fractions were not analysed.

3.2.4. Phylogenetic diversity

An archaeal and a bacterial clone library was construct-
ed to study the 16S rDNA-based microbial diversity in sed-
iments at the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV (30–40 cm bsf).
The 16S rDNA archaeal clone library consisted of nine
phylogenetic groups (Table 4). Closest relatives of these
groups were found among seep-endemic, uncultured micro-
organisms. The majority of sequences obtained were relat-
ed to the ANME-2 group (59% ANME-2a, 3% ANME-2c
of all archaeal sequences) which is known to mediate AOM
(Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2002; Knittel et al.,
2005). The second most abundant group (18% of all archa-
eal sequences) was found to belong to the ANME-1 cluster
which is also known to mediate AOM (Hinrichs et al.,
1999; Michaelis et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002). The bac-
terial clone library consisted of 10 uncultivated bacterial
lineages. Similar to the archaeal sequences, the next rela-
tives of all bacterial 16S rDNA sequences belonged to
uncultivated organisms that are commonly found at meth-
ane seeps (Knittel et al., 2003; Table 4). The closest rela-
tives of the most abundant cluster of sequences (81%)
belonged to the Seep-SRB1 group which comprises the
bacterial partners of ANME-1 and ANME-2 (Knittel
et al., 2003). Other phylogenetic groups of Bacteria were
represented by single sequences (&lt;2%).

3.3. Bonjardim MV

3.3.1. Methane, C2+, sulphate and sulphide

A distinct SMT was observed in the top metre of the
gravity core section with ex situ methane concentrations
above saturation at atmospheric pressure and sulphate
concentrations dropping below 0.2 mM. After aligning
the sulphate profile of the gravity core with the MUC-
core section, the actual depth of the SMT was
determined between 45 and 70 cm bsf (Fig. 5a). Methane
concentrations in surface sediments (0–52 cm sediment
depth) were&amp;lt;0.001 mM indicating a complete consump-
tion of methane in the SMT. As the two core sections
overlapped, concentration gradients were determined
from the gravity core section and also from aligned pro-
files in the overlapping zone (Fig. 5a, d). The steepest
methane and sulphate gradients in the gravity core sec-
tion were determined with 0.09 and ?0.76 lmol cm?4,
respectively (Fig. 5a, Table 2). Aligning the gravity core
and MUC-core sections, the steepest sulphate gradient
was ?1.67 lmol cm?4. Methane concentrations declined

below the depth at which the two core sections overlap
(Fig. 5a). Hence, no further concentration gradient was
determined. In comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV,
C2+-concentrations were high with values of &gt;0.25 mM
at a sediment depth below 1 m (Fig. 5b). Similar to
methane, concentrations of C2+-compounds decreased
across the SMT indicating a consumption of these com-
pounds. Gaseous hydrocarbons comprised methane
(&gt;81%), ethane (&lt;14%), propane (&lt;4.5%) and Rbutane
(&lt;0.4%) indicating a thermogenic origin of these gases
(Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). Sulphide concentrations peak-
ed in the SMT with 5.3 mM at 52.5 cm bsf (Fig. 5d). In
the gravity core section, the steepest sulphide gradients
were determined as 0.23 (upward) and ?0.07 (downward)
lmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2). Aligning the two core
sections, the steepest (upward) sulphide gradient was
determined with 0.73 lmol cm?4.

3.3.2. AOM, SR rates and diffusive fluxes

AOM and SR rates were highest in the SMT at 58 cm
bsf with maximum values of 2.6 and 15.4 nmol cm?3 d?1,
respectively (Fig. 5c). Comparably low values of AOM
and SR rates were measured in over- and underlying sedi-
ment horizons. Replicate AOM and SR rate measurements
showed a high standard error of 92% and 85% of the aver-
age value, respectively, possibly indicating a high small



Fig. 5. Bonjardim mud volcano. A distinct SMT, highlighted in grey, was found between 50 and 70 cm bsf (a). At this horizon, concentrations of higher
hydrocarbons also decline (b). Note that concentrations of C2+-compounds are ?35-fold higher compared to Captain Arutyunov MV. AOM and SR rates

Concentration gradients for sulphate and sulphide were determined from concentration profiles of the gravity core samples as well as from aligned gravity
core and multiple-corer concentration profiles. Circles represent multiple-corer and triangles gravity corer samples. Errors are given as standard errors.

scale variability on a metre scale. The 19-fold higher areal
SR compared to AOM suggests a decoupling of these two
processes (Table 2). Accordingly, the concentration gradi-
ents (determined from unaligned and aligned profiles)
translate to a 5.1–11-fold higher diffusive downward flux
of sulphate compared to the upward flux of methane.
The cumulative sulphide flux (upward and downward)
accounted for 77–92% of the sulphate flux.

3.3.3. Lipid biomarker

A moderate increase of diagnostic archaeal and bacterial
lipid concentrations was observed at the SMT in sediments
of Bonjardim MV (Fig. 5e, g). At this horizon (?57 cm
bsf), stable carbon isotope analysis revealed highest deple-
tions in 13C with minimum values of ?83&amp;amp; (sn2-hydroxy-
archaeol) in archaeal diether lipids and ?49&amp;amp; (C16:1x5) in
bacterial FAs (Table 3, Fig. 5f, g). At the SMT, the ratio
of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol was 0.7:1 and
therefore lower in comparison to Capt. Arutyunov MV
(Table 3). Similar to Capt. Arutyunov MV, other diagnos-
tic archaeal isoprenoidal hydrocarbons could not be mea-
sured due to a high UCM background. Equally high
amounts of the FAs C16:1x5 and ai-C15:0, both of which
were the most 13C-depleted FAs (Table 3), were detected
in sediments at the SMT. The FA cyC17:0x5,6, which was
abundant at Capt. Arutyunov MV could not be detected
in sediments of Bonjardim MV. Furthermore, dominant
FAs such as C16:1x7, C16:0, C18:1x9 and C18:1x7 carried
d13C-signatures P?34&amp;amp;, indicating that AOM was not
the main energy and carbon delivering process to the
microbial community. In contrast to Capt. Arutyunov
MV, the concentrations of diagnostic archaeal lipids were
roughly 4-fold higher compared to specific bacterial FAs
(Table 3). A further analysis of the diversity of microbial
organism using 16S rDNA methods was not carried out
at Bonjardim MV.

3.4. Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and ‘‘No Name’’

3.4.1. Methane, sulphate and sulphide

The SMT was located in the upper metre of the sediment
cores retrieved from Ginsburg and Gemini MV and at
2–3 m bsf at the ‘‘No Name’’ structure, respectively
(Fig. 6a, c, e). Methane concentrations in sediments overly-
ing the SMT at these structures were&amp;lt;0.001 mM, and
reached ex situ concentrations above (Gemini MV and
‘‘No Name’’) and just below saturation (1.3 mM, Ginsburg
MV) below the SMT. Sediments retrieved from Ginsburg
MV had a distinct smell of petroleum below 40 cm bsf.
No depth corrections were made as only gravity cores were
taken from these MVs. The actual depth of the SMTs was
therefore most likely 10–40 cm below the sediment depth
indicated in Fig. 6. In contrast to the observed depletion
of sulphate to concentrations&amp;lt;0.4 mM below the SMT
at Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure, sulphate
concentrations showed a minimum between 30 and 70 cm
and an increase to values P17 mM with depth below
90 cm at Ginsburg MV. The total diffusive sulphate flux
was therefore calculated from both, the upward and the
downward gradients at Ginsburg MV. At Ginsburg MV,
Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure, methane and
downward sulphate gradients ranged from 0.02 to 0.05
and ?0.11 to ?0.92 lmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2).
The upward sulphate gradient at Ginsburg MV was
0.35 lmol cm?4. Sulphide concentrations peaked in the
SMTs with values between 4.7 and 7.6 mM (Fig. 6b, d, f)



Fig. 6. The SMT, highlighted in grey, was found in the top most m at Ginsburg (a) and Gemini (c) and between 2 and 3 m at No Name MV (e; note the
different scale chosen for depth). In these horizons, also sulphide concentrations peak (b, d, f). Bold lines illustrate steepest gradients determined for
methane, sulphate and sulphide.

5348 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336–5355
and steepest gradients were determined with values be-
tween 0.04 to 0.32 (upward) and ?0.06 to ?0.15 (down-
ward) lmol cm?4, respectively (Table 2).

3.4.2. Diffusive fluxes

The diffusive flux calculations from pore water profiles
of Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ struc-
ture indicate that the diffusive sulphate fluxes exceeded the
methane fluxes (by 15.5-, 18.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively,
according to the calculation). This suggests a decoupling
of AOM and SR at these structures similar to the observa-
tions made at Bonjardim MV (Table 2). The calculated
cumulative (upward + downward) sulphide flux accounted
for 66%, 70% and 146% of the sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg
MV, Gemini MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure, respec-
tively. The composition of the microbial community was
not investigated here.

3.5. Lipid biomarkers of carbonate crusts

Exposed carbonate crusts were observed at the mud vol-
canoes Ginsburg, Hesperides and Faro. Additionally, high
amounts of broken carbonate chimneys were found at Hes-
perides and Faro MV. Both crusts and chimney pieces were
absent at Capt. Arutyunov MV, Bonjardim MV and the
‘‘No Name’’ structure according to our visual inspections.
We could retrieve crust samples from the summits of Hes-
perides and Faro MV for further analyses of the lipid sig-
natures of the crusts.

3.5.1. Hesperides MV

Carbonate crusts of Hesperides MV contained archaeal
and bacterial lipids diagnostic for methanotrophic commu-
nities and processes. Archaeal lipids were strongly depleted
in d13C with minimum values of ?97&amp;amp; (archaeol) whereas
bacterial FAs were only moderately depleted with mini-
mum values of ?43&amp;amp; (ai-C15:0, Table 3). Only trace
amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol were detected among
the archaeal diethers. Isoprenoidal hydrocarbons were
dominated by 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI:0)
and contained comparably low amounts of a crocetane/
2,6,10,14-tetramethylhexadecane (phytane) mixture and
RPMI:1 (comprising 2 isomers). The FA fraction in the
carbonate was dominated by C16:0 followed by C18:0 with
d13C-values &gt;?28&amp;amp; (Table 3). FAs putatively specific for
SRB involved in AOM such as C16:1x5, i-C15:0 and ai-
C15:0 (Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004), were
approximately 3–4.8 times lower in concentration com-
pared to C16:0. However, in contrast to abundant FAs, sta-
ble carbon isotope compositions of i-C15:0, ai-C15:0 and
C16:1x5 showed a moderate depletion in

13C (Table 3).
Moreover, in comparison to specific archaeal lipids, diag-
nostic bacterial FAs were roughly an order of magnitude
lower in concentration.

3.5.2. Faro MV

All archaeal and bacterial lipids found in the carbonate
crust of Faro MV were strongly depleted in 13C (Table 3)
with minimum d13C-values of ?114&amp;amp; (archaeol) in diag-
nostic archaeal diether lipids and ?99&amp;amp; (i-C15:0) in specif-
ic bacterial FAs (Table 3). Archaeal diether lipids were
dominated by archaeol and contained comparably low
amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol. Isoprenoidal hydrocar-
bons were dominated by PMI:2 (9 isomers) followed by
PMI:1 (2 isomers) and relatively high amounts of croce-
tane/phytane. Specific FAs showed comparably small dif-
ferences in abundance and d13C-values (Table 3).
However, ai-C15:0 was the most dominant FA with a
roughly 2-fold higher concentration compared to i-C15:0
and C16:1x5. The FA cyC17:0x5,6 was not detected. Concen-
trations of specific FAs were comparable to specific
archaeal lipids.



Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5349
4. Discussion

4.1. Evidence of methane-driven geochemical and biological

activity at mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz

Active marine mud volcanoes have been identified as
important escape pathways of hydrocarbon gases and
may even contribute to atmospheric green house gases
(Dimitrov, 2002; Judd et al., 2002; Kopf, 2002; Damm
and Bude?us, 2003; Dimitrov, 2003; Sauter et al., 2006).
However, high methane fluxes reaching surface sediments
may support high biomasses of methane-oxidizing microor-
ganisms, and via their sulphide production also thiotrophic,
giant bacteria and other chemosynthetic fauna which form
a filter against gas emission to the hydrosphere (Olu et al.,
1997b; Sahling et al., 2002; Werne et al., 2002; Boetius
and Suess, 2004; Milkov et al., 2004; Cordes et al., 2005).
Furthermore, methane venting is often associated with the
precipitation of authigenic carbonates which sequester
methane derived CO2 at the seafloor (Aloisi et al., 2000;
Kopf, 2002; Boetius and Suess, 2004; Hensen et al., 2004).
These carbonates may also serve as paleo-indicators of pre-
viously active phases of quiescent or fossil seeps (Ritger
et al., 1987; Peckmann et al., 1999; Thiel et al., 1999).

The Gulf of Cadiz is characterised by numerous mud
volcanoes (Fig. 1) which have been intensely surveyed since
their discovery in 1999 (Kenyon et al., 2000, 2001; Somoza
et al., 2002; Pinheiro et al., 2003). Among the findings
indicative of high past and present methane seepage are
the occurrence of hydrate-bearing sediments, authigenic
carbonates and seep related biota at several mud volcanoes
(Gardner, 2001; Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al.,
2003; Somoza et al., 2003). Yet, the present activity of these
structures in relation to methane emission to the hydro-
sphere remains unknown. The observations during cruise
SO-175 revealed only few traces of methane reaching sur-
face sediment horizons (here referring to the upper decime-
tres bsf reachable by biota) at the centres of the mud
volcanoes Capt. Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg and
Hesperides, and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure. No visible fluid
or gas escape to the hydrosphere was detected with video
observations, indicating that the mud volcanoes may be
relatively inactive and that the methane flux may be con-
sumed within subsurface sediment horizons. In contrast,
highly active seep systems such as Hydrate Ridge, the Gulf
of Mexico or Ha?kon Mosby Mud Volcano show maximal
methane consumption and sulphide production at the sed-
iment surface, and emit methane into the hydrosphere
through focused gas and fluid escape pathways, despite
the high methane and sulphate turnover rates consuming
substantial fractions of the methane flux (Boetius et al.,
2000; Damm and Bude?us, 2003; Treude et al., 2003; Joye
et al., 2004; De Beer et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2006).

The high sulphide fluxes from anaerobic methane con-
sumption at active seeps are utilised by thiotrophic commu-
nities, e.g. mats of giant bacteria like Beggiatoa sp., various
chemosynthetic bivalves like Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp.,
Bathymodiolus sp. and by several siboglinid tubeworm spe-
cies (Sibuet and Olu, 1998). Such communities often colo-
nise large areas at highly active seeps. Furthermore, these
organisms are adapted to different geochemical settings
and can be used as indicators for high methane fluxes and
turnover in surface sediments. Three types of indicator
communities were so far observed at low abundances at
the investigated mud volcanoes. Some small (ca. 20 cm dia-
metre) blackish sediment patches covered with white bacte-
rial mats were observed by towed camera systems at Faro
MV indicating locally elevated fluxes of sulphide (likely
AOM-derived) reaching the surface of the seafloor
(Fig. 6d). Few specimen of the deep-dwelling thiotrophic bi-
valve Acharax sp. were recovered from Faro MV and previ-
ously from Ginsburg MV (Gardner, 2001). Members of the
family Solemyidae to which Acharax sp. belongs are mostly
deep burrowing and occur in seep habitats with low or mod-
erate methane and sulphide fluxes where they can take up
sulphide through their foot from subsurface accumulations
(Sibuet and Olu, 1998; Sahling et al., 2002; Treude et al.,
2003). At Hydrate Ridge for instance, Acharax sp. mines
subsurface sediments for sulphide pockets below 15 cm sed-
iment depth (Sahling et al., 2002). As a third indicator spe-
cies, tubeworms were recovered from Capt. Arutyunov and
previously observed at Bonjardim MV (Pinheiro et al.,
2003). As adult animals, these worms are lacking a mouth,
gut and anus and are hence depending on energy and car-
bon sources provided by symbiotic, thiotrophic or methan-
otrophic bacteria (Southward et al., 1981; Dando et al.,
1994; Gebruk et al., 2003; Southward et al., 2005). At Capt.
Arutyunov MV, the moderate 13C-depletion of worm-de-
rived membrane lipids (ca. ?40&amp;amp;) indicates a thiotrophic
or mixed methanotrophic/thiotrophic feeding mode of the
tubeworm symbionts. This is concluded on the basis of
the d13C-value of ?48&amp;amp; of the source methane (Nuzzo
et al., 2005). Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria are charac-
terised by a considerable depletion in the 13C-content of
membrane lipids in comparison to source methane (Hanson
and Hanson, 1996), which was not reflected in the tube-
worm isotope signature.

4.2. Hotspots of hydrocarbon turnover at the mud volcanoes

of the Gulf of Cadiz

The observed patterns of seep related biota is in good
agreement with the observed geochemical gradients. All
mud volcanoes investigated here showed a complete
depletion of methane and sulphate within the subsurface
SMT. At Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV, the
SMT was positioned at 25–40 cm and 45–70 cm bsf,
respectively (Figs. 4, 5a), and reflected in elevated AOM
and SR rates within this zone. Generally, integrated rate
measurements were comparable to the diffusive fluxes at
Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV (Table 3). Also,
concentration measurements of methane and sulphate
and the resulting estimates of diffusive methane and
sulphate fluxes at Ginsburg MV, Gemini MV and the



5350 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336–5355
‘‘No Name’’ structure indicate that sulphate-dependent
AOM is a widespread microbial process in the centres
of the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. However, as
we cannot exclude a potential advective transport compo-
nent in sediments of the surveyed mud volcanoes and due
to shortcomings in the vertical resolution of pore water
profiles, the estimates of fluxes presented here should be
considered with caution.

With respect to methane fluxes and microbial turnover
rates at the time of our investigation, Capt. Arutyunov
MV was the most active of the investigated structures fol-
lowed by Bonjardim, Ginsburg and Gemini MV, while
‘‘No Name’’ was the least active structure (Table 2). Fur-
thermore, highest turnover rates and fluxes coincided with
the shallowest SMT comparing all investigated MVs.
Hence, compared to other marine gas seeps and methane-
rich environments, the Gulf of Cadiz MVs investigated
here showed a low or medium range in methane turnover
rates, reflecting the relatively low methane fluxes. At the
Namibian continental slope, the north western Black Sea
and Chilean shelf and the western Argentinean basin for in-
stance, the SMT is located several metres bsf and methane
fluxes are low with values usually&amp;lt;55 mmol m?2 year?1

(Niewo?hner et al., 1998; Jørgensen et al., 2001; Hensen
et al., 2003; Treude et al., 2005). These values are compara-
ble to Ginsburg and Gemini MV as well as to the ‘‘No
Name’’ structure. The AOM activity and diffusive methane
fluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV were sub-
stantially higher than those at Ginsburg MV, Gemini
MV and the ‘‘No Name’’ structure. However, areal rates
and diffusive fluxes at Capt. Arutyunov and Bonjardim
MV are still two orders of magnitude lower in comparison
to other cold seeps, which bear gas hydrates at their stabil-
ity limit such as Ha?kon Mosby Mud Volcano, Hydrate
Ridge and the Gulf of Mexico. In such environments with
active fluid flow (&gt;100 cm year?1) and gas emission via
ebullition, methane fluxes were estimated with values
&gt;8.5 mol m?2 year?1 (Torres et al., 2002; Luff and Wall-
mann, 2003; De Beer et al., 2006) and AOM reached values
&gt;4 mol m?2 year?1, i.e. &gt;0.5 lmol cm?3 d?1 (Treude et al.,
2003; Joye et al., 2004).

In vitro experiments with sediment slurries and ex situ
tracer injection assays have previously shown that AOM
and SR are in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry if methane is the
sole carbon source (Nauhaus et al., 2002; Treude et al.,
2003). In spite of the putative loss of methane during sub-
sampling, the deviation from the 1:1 stoichiometry between
AOM and SR as well as between the sulphate and methane
fluxes (Table 2) indicates the presence of electron donors
other than methane for SR at the investigated MVs. SRR
were always highest at the depth of the SMT but just above
detection limit in the overlying sediments of Capt. Arutyu-
nov and Bonjardim MV (Figs. 4, 5c). Hence, a substantial
contribution to SR by pelagic organic matter input can be
ruled out. However, our data provide evidence for the pres-
ence of other hydrocarbons beside methane in the subsur-
face sediments of several mud volcanoes. Sulphate
reducing bacteria can use a variety of short and long chain
alkanes and complex aliphatic and aromatic compounds
(Rueter et al., 1994; Widdel and Rabus, 2001). At Capt.
Arutyunov and Bonjardim MV the presence of complex
hydrocarbons is indicated by the strong unresolved com-
plex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons in sediment samples
from the SMT and deeper sediment horizons. Further-
more, C2–C4 compounds declined at the depth of the
SMT (Figs. 4, 5b), indicating their consumption in this
zone. At Bonjardim MV, the deviation between AOM
and SR was higher compared to Capt. Arutyunov MV
coinciding with higher concentrations of C2+ compounds.
Furthermore, Mazurenko et al. (2002) observed a compo-
sition of hydrocarbon gases at Ginsburg MV similar to
those detected at Bonjardim MV. Nuzzo et al. (2005) and
Stadnitskaia et al. (2006) showed that methane is common-
ly of a thermogenic origin at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of
Cadiz. Hence, SR fuelled by higher hydrocarbons could be
an important microbial process in the MV sediments of the
Gulf of Cadiz in addition to methane oxidation. Similar re-
sults were obtained in a study of cold seeps of the Gulf of
Mexico where SR rates exceed AOM rates up to 10-fold,
fuelled by a variety of hydrocarbons and petroleum in
the sediments (Joye et al., 2004).

In conclusion, our biogeochemical measurements as well
as biological and geological observations indicate that ele-
vated methane fluxes are associated with the centres of the
MVs studied during cruise SO-175. However, at the inves-
tigated sites, all methane was consumed anaerobically in
subsurface sediments and we could not observe any emis-
sion of methane to the hydrosphere. However, there is evi-
dence for extensive fluid and/or gas escape in the past as
indicated by the widespread occurrence of massive carbon-
ate chimneys and crusts (Diaz-Del-Rio et al., 2003; Somoza
et al., 2003) of which at least the latter bear AOM signals.
Another geological evidence for temporally varying activi-
ties of mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz are the typical
‘‘Christmas tree’’ structures observed on high-resolution
seismic profiles (Somoza et al., 2002, 2003). Such patterns
are probably caused by eruptive events followed by phases
of dormancy. This so-called multiphase activity is a com-
mon behaviour in many terrestrial mud volcanoes (e.g.
Lokbatan MV; Aliyev et al., 2002; Kholodov, 2002; Dim-
itrov, 2003). It is therefore possible that mud volcanism
in the Gulf of Cadiz is in a transient state of low activity
at present.

4.3. Identity of methane oxidising communities in sediments

and carbonate crusts

Fingerprinting of diagnostic lipids is a common tool for
the chemotaxonomic identification of microorganisms
(Madigan et al., 2000; Boschker and Middelburg, 2002).
This approach has been used extensively to examine anaer-
obic methanotrophic organisms, because the carbon iso-
tope fractionation associated with AOM leads to specific,
very depleted d13C-signatures of lipid biomarkers (Hinrichs



Mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz 5351
et al., 1999; Elvert et al., 2001; Blumenberg et al., 2004).
The dominance of bacterial and archaeal lipids with low
d13C-values in sediments and carbonates indicate that
AOM is a major biomass-generating process at the investi-
gated MVs. Differences in the abundances of specific archa-
eal isoprenoidal diethers, hydrocarbons and bacterial FAs,
as well as varying Dd13C-values of these lipids (compared
to source methane) indicate that several phylogenetic
groups of methanotrophic communities mediate AOM in
the Gulf of Cadiz. Elevated concentrations and associated
low d13C-signatures of specific archaeal and bacterial mem-
brane lipids corresponded with elevated AOM and SR
rates in sediments of the SMT at Capt. Arutyunov and
Bonjardim MV (Figs. 4, 5e–g, Table 3). In combination
with 16S rDNA analysis, the biomarker patterns give evi-
dence that AOM is mediated by a microbial community
consisting of methanotrophic archaea and SRB phyloge-
netically related to those which were previously found at
other methane seeps (Boetius et al., 2000; Michaelis
et al., 2002; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002; Nie-
mann et al., 2005). Furthermore, the presence of a similar
suite of 13C-depleted lipids in abundant authigenic carbon-
ates recovered from Hesperides and Faro MV (Table 3)
indicates higher activities and a more widespread microbial
methane turnover in the past.

4.3.1. Methanotrophic archaea

Previous publications revealed dominant amounts of
sn2-hydroxarchaeol relative to archaeol in ANME-2 dom-
inated habitats, whereas the reverse was observed in
ANME-1 dominated systems (Blumenberg et al., 2004; El-
vert et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2005). Moreover, ANME-
2 communities were found to comprise high contents of
crocetane, whereas it seems to be present at low concentra-
tions in ANME-1 (Elvert et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000;
Blumenberg et al., 2004). Stable carbon isotope fractiona-
tions were found to be higher in ANME-2 compared to
ANME-1 dominated habitats (Orphan et al., 2002) with
Dd13C-values (archaeol relative to the source methane)
ranging between 34 to 53&amp;amp; and 11 to 37&amp;amp;, respectively
(Hinrichs et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Elvert et al.,
2001; Orphan et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2002; Blumenberg
et al., 2004; Niemann et al., 2005).

In the Gulf of Cadiz, a high sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to
archaeol ratio of 1.7:1 was detected at Capt. Arutyunov
MV indicating that this system is dominated by ANME-2
archaea (Blumenberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005).
Accordingly, a high Dd13C-value of 42&amp;amp; of archaeol com-
pared to the source methane (?48&amp;amp;, Nuzzo et al., 2005)
was observed. Furthermore, the dominance of ANME-2
compared to ANME-1 sequences in the clone library from
Capt. Arutyunov MV suggests a dominance of ANME-2 in
this SMT. However, the SMT of Capt. Arutyunov MV also
contained other typical seep associated 16S rDNA
sequences, including crenarcheota of the Marine Benthic
Group B, which are often found at methane seeps, but
whose function remains unknown (Knittel et al., 2005).
At Bonjardim MV, a lower sn2-hydroxyarchaeol to archae-
ol ratio of 0.7:1 combined with lower Dd13C-values be-
tween the biomarkers (e.g. archaeol, 31.5&amp;amp;) relative to
the source methane (?49.5 to ?51&amp;amp;, Nuzzo et al., 2005;
Stadnitskaia et al., 2006) lie between published values from
systems dominated by either ANME-1 or ANME-2 (Blu-
menberg et al., 2004; Elvert et al., 2005; Niemann et al.,
2005). This suggests a mixed ANME community in these
sediments. Similar characteristics have been observed in
carbonate crusts at Faro MV. At this mud volcano, sub-
stantial amounts of 13C-depleted crocetane were detected
giving additional indications for an involvement of
ANME-2 in AOM at the time of carbonate precipitation.
At Hesperides MV, only trace amounts of sn2-hydroxyar-
chaeol were detected, and thus indicate the dominance of
ANME-1 communities. No distinct environmental prefer-
ences have been found for either group, most likely because
the taxonomic level investigated comprises a relatively
large diversity of microorganisms.

4.3.2. Sulphate reducing bacteria

At many different cold seep settings, ANME-1 and
ANME-2 archaea have been found in consortium with
SRB of the Seep-SRB1 cluster belonging to the Desulfosar-
cina/Desulfococcus group (Knittel et al., 2003). However,
this cluster apparently comprises physiologically different
ecotypes that are distinguished by very specific FA patterns
according to their association to either ANME-1 or to
ANME-2 (Elvert et al., 2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004).
FA signatures in environmental systems dominated by
ANME-1/Seep-SRB1 communities comprise high contents
of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Blumenberg et al., 2004; El-
vert et al., 2005), whereas systems dominated by ANME-
2/Seep-SRB1 communities comprise the unusual FA
cyC17:1x5,6 and dominant contents of C16:1x5 but almost
balanced ratios of ai-C15:0 relative to i-C15:0 (Elvert et al.,
2003; Blumenberg et al., 2004).

The dominance of the unusual FAs C16:1x5 and
cyC17:1x5,6 and an almost equal ratio of the iso- and ante-
iso-branched C15:0 FAs in sediments of the SMT at Capt.
Arutyunov MV are in very good agreement with the archa-
eal lipid data and published lipid signatures of the Seep-
SRB1 ecotype associated with ANME-2. This finding is
also in accordance with the predominance of Seep-SRB1
sequences in the bacterial clone library. As expected from
the detection of potentially diverse ANME communities
at Bonjardim MV, the FA signature shows characteristics
of both SRB ecotypes previously identified as bacterial
partners in AOM. The high ratio of ai-C15:0 compared to
i-C15:0 (8.4:1) is indicative for the Seep-SRB1 ecotype asso-
ciated with ANME-1 while the high abundance of C16:1x5
indicates the ecotype associated with ANME-2. This find-
ing is similar to results obtained from a carbonate crust
at Faro MV where a comparable fatty acid pattern has
been detected. At Bonjardim MV, however, several FAs
carry d13C-signatures that are comparable to the source
methane and do not show any fractionation. This suggests



5352 H. Niemann et al. 70 (2006) 5336–5355
a contribution to carbon biomass from processes other
than methane consumption. A similar mixture of carbon
sources to biomass could also explain the unspecific signa-
ture of FAs in the carbonate of Hesperides MV.

Another striking difference is the comparably high lipid
concentration in the carbonate recovered from Faro com-
pared to that recovered from Hesperides MV. A rather re-
cent formation of the sampled carbonate from Faro MV
appears likely, as these were stained black from sulphide
and recovered together with some living specimens of the
chemosynthetic bivalve Acharax sp. A possible explanation
for the difference in AOM-derived lipid contents could be
that the sampled carbonate crust from Hesperides is older
than that recovered from Faro MV and has been exposed
to oxic sea water and lipid diagenesis for a longer time
which is indicated by the dominant abundance of saturated
FAs relative to unsaturated FAs. This may also explain the
dominance of PMI’s with higher degrees of saturation at
Hesperides compared to Faro MV assuming that the diage-
netic alteration of unsaturated isoprenoid hydrocarbons is
similar to that of FAs.

5. Conclusions

At the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyu-
nov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and Faro as well as
at the ‘‘No Name’’ structure, several indications for a slow
upward fluid and gas flux were found. Our data suggest a
complete consumption of methane and higher hydrocar-
bons in the sediments of the studied mud volcanoes at
depths of 20–300 cm below seafloor. We found no indica-
tion of hydrocarbons reaching near surface sediments or
the hydrosphere except from the visual observation of
small patches of reduced sediments covered by giant sul-
phide-oxidizing bacteria indicating localised near-surface
AOM activities. However, with respect to the limited ex-
tend of video surveys and sediment sampling in this study,
a potential seepage of hydrocarbons into the water column
can not be ruled out. The overlap of methane and sulphate
depletion with sulphide production shows that methane
oxidation processes are mediated microbially under anaer-
obic conditions. Correspondingly, AOM and SR rates
show a peak in a distinct, narrow SMT in the subsurface
sediments of the mud volcano centres. Highest turnover
rates and fluxes coincided with the shallowest SMT depths
with Capt. Arutyunov MV as the most active system in the
study area, followed by the mud volcanoes Bonjardim,
Ginsburg and Gemini, and finally the ‘‘No Name’’ struc-
ture. In comparison to other gas seeps, methane fluxes
and turnover rates are low to mid range in the Gulf of Ca-
diz. In addition to AOM, the anaerobic oxidation of higher
hydrocarbons could be an important process fuelling SR.
Lipid biomarker patterns and 16S rDNA clone sequences
from the sediments and carbonates of the AOM hotspots
provide evidence that both of the previously described
ANME-1/Seep-SRB1 and ANME-2/Seep-SRB1 communi-
ties mediate AOM at mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz.
The finding of their lipid signatures in carbonate crusts at
the centres of the investigated mud volcanoes indicates that
at least some of the vast amounts of carbonates littering
mud volcanoes and diapiric ridges in the northern part of
the Gulf of Cadiz are linked to methane seepage.

Abstract

Mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz occurs over a large area extending from the shelf to more than 3500 m water depth and is trig-
gered by compressional stress along the European–African plate boundary, affecting a deeply faulted sedimentary sequence of locally
more than 5 km thickness. The investigation of six active sites shows that mud volcano (MV) fluids, on average, are highly enriched
in CH4, Li, B, and Sr and depleted in Mg, K, and Br. The purity of the fluids is largely controlled by the intensity of upward directed
flow. Flow rates could be constrained by numerical modelling and vary between&amp;lt;0.05 and 15 cm yr?1. Application of dD–d18O system-
atics identifies clay mineral dehydration, most likely within Mesozoic and Tertiary shales and marls, as the major source of fluids. Hence,
Cl and Na in the pore fluids are mostly depleted below seawater values, following a general trend of dilution. However, deviations from
this trend occur and are likely caused by the dissolution of halite in evaporitic deposits. Other secondary processes overprinting the ori-
ginal fluid composition may occur along the flow path, such as dissolution of anhydrite or gypsum and/or the formation of calcite and
dolomite. Different sources of fluids are also indicated by variations in 87Sr/86Sr, which range from 0.7086 to 0.7099 at the different sites.
Dehydration may be induced primarily by overburden and tectonic compression; however, very high concentrations of Li and B, spe-
cifically at Captain Arutyunov MV (CAMV) indicate additional leaching at temperatures above 150 ?C, which could be explained by the
injection of hot fluids along deep penetrating, major E–W strike–slip fault systems. This hypothesis is supported by the occurrence of
generally thermogenic, but significantly CH4-enriched, light volatile hydrocarbon gases at CAMV which cannot be explained by shallow
microbial methanogenesis. Li and Li/B ratios from different types of hot and cold vents are used to infer that high temperature signals
seem to be preserved at various cold vent locations and indicate a closer coupling of both systems in continental margin environments
than outlined in previous studies.

Mud volcanism provides an important, but poorly con-
strained transport pathway for fluids along continental
margins. Several thousands of mud volcanoes (MVs) may
occur in deep-water areas along continental margins
(Milkov, 2000; Milkov et al., 2003) so that the expulsion

of sedimentary fluids at continental margins may play a sig-
nificant role for global fluid and element budgets (Aloisi
et al., 2004a). Fluid expulsion is generally coupled to tec-
tonic activity controlling episodic fault displacements
(Moore and Vrolijk, 1992). Mud volcanoes and other types
of cold vent systems are offering a window into otherwise
obscured deep structural and diagenetic processes as geo-
chemical interactions of the rising fluid with surrounding
sediment and rock may significantly alter the chemistry
of the pore fluids. Such diagenetic processes may involve
volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz—indications ..., Geochim.

the degradation of organic matter and the formation of gas
hydrates (e.g. Martin et al., 1993; Buffett and Archer, 2004;
Hensen and Wallmann, 2005), mineral dissolution/precipi-
tation reactions and transformation processes of clay min-
erals and volcanic ashes (Chan and Kastner, 2000; Brown
et al., 2001; Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003) and high-
temperature reactions with oceanic or continental crust
(Martin et al., 1991; You and Gieskes, 2001; Von Damm
et al., 2005). Negative chloride anomalies are typically
reported from many modern accretionary prisms (Moore
and Vrolijk, 1992); however, depending on the geologic
and structural setting, the overlap of a number of these
processes may lead to the formation of geochemically dis-
tinct fluids with an eventually complex history. This prob-
lem has been addressed by a number of studies (e.g. Martin
et al., 1996; Suess et al., 1998; Fryer et al., 1999; Haese
et al., 2003; Aloisi et al., 2004a; Hensen et al., 2004;) which
have helped to improve our knowledge of key processes in-
volved. Moreover, any rising fluid may be subject a large
number of processes occurring simultaneously or succes-
sively under regionally changing environmental conditions.
Hence, in many cases there is no unambiguous solution for
the origin of a specific fluid. In some cases ODP drilling
data provided valuable information bridging the gap be-
tween subsurface processes and sea floor observations. In
order to proceed towards a more general understanding

of deep structural control on cold venting more systematic
investigations from various tectonic settings are required.

Although the Gulf of Cadiz is, at present, target area of a
number of European projects, geochemical data published
to date are mostly limited to thermogenic hydrocarbon gas-
es and CH4 clathrates from MVs situated on the Moroccan
Margin (Mazurenko et al., 2003; Depreiter et al., 2005; Van
Rensbergen et al., 2005; Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). Here, we
provide the first comprehensive data set on the geochemis-
try of mud volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz. We combine
analysis of pore water and gas geochemistry with informa-
tion on regional geology to unravel the origin of the fluids in
this compressive margin, which may be undergoing active
subduction, as suggested recently by (Gutscher et al., 2002).

2. Study area and geological background

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in a structurally complex
convergent tectonic setting in which the boundary between
the African and Eurasian plates is concealed beneath thick
(?7 km) Mio-Pliocene sedimentary deposits (e.g. Medial-
dea et al., 2004). In this area the Africa–Eurasia plate
boundary strikes from the right-lateral Gloria Fault and
Bank of Gorringe thrust to the west, to the Alboran Sea,
east of the Strait of Gibraltar (Fig. 1). The region is seismi-
cally active (Buforn et al., 1995; Ribeiro et al., 1996) and
E

edialdea et al., 2004) and complemented with interpretations based on the
omain, the Allochthonous Wedge, the Frontal Allochtonous Units, major

ini, Hesperides, and No Name MVs (large triangles), and other MVs (small
mbal (MPF), Porto-Bonjardim (PBF), Horseshoe (HsF), and Gorringe-
tline (dashed line) indicates the edge of the accretionary wedge as suggested
se.

was the epicentre of an &gt;8.5 magnitude earthquake in 1755
which, combined with an associated tsunami, decimated
the city of Lisbon, Portugal (Baptista et al., 1988). The
NE sector is marked by a conjugate set of NW–SE and
NE–SW strike–slip faults (Fig. 1) that control diapiric ridg-
es and together with major WNW–ESE strike–slip faults
are thought to accommodate the NW-directed plate con-
vergence (e.g. Argus et al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 2005) in
a broad deformation zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996)
that has been described as a diffuse plate boundary (Sartori
et al., 1994). It has been proposed previously that plate
convergence in the region is accommodated along major
deeply rooted Paleozoic wrench faults reactivated under
Plio-Quaternary transpressive convergence (Meghraoui
et al., 1996; Morel and Meghraoui, 1996). The formation
of the Arc of Gibraltar and expulsion of thick nappes to
the west in the Gulf of Cadiz were initiated by a change
in the main convergence direction during the Mid- to
Upper-Miocene (Maldonado et al., 1999). Several studies
have suggested that westward progression of the Arc of
Gibraltar into the Gulf of Cadiz ceased before the Pliocene
(e.g. Lonergan and White, 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999),
however, Gutscher et al. (2002) and Gutscher (2004) pro-
posed that E–W subduction remains active and is driven
by the rollback of a relic of subducted Thethian oceanic
crust beneath the Arc of Gibraltar (Fig. 1).

Mud volcanoes (MVs) were first discovered and sampled
in the Gulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Gardner, 2001) and since then
have been extensively investigated during several research
cruises (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005). Folding, mud volca-
nism, and diapirism in the region result from neo-tectonism
(Gra?cia et al., 2003) and MVs are located either along ma-
jor strike–slip faults or at the intersection of these faults
with arcuate thrusts associated with the formation of the
Gibraltar Arc (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005).

3. Material and methods

In December 2003, an extensive scientific programme
was conducted on the German research vessel RV Sonne
(cruise SO 175-2; Kopf and participants, 2004). Sediments,
fluids, and gases were sampled from active MVs through-
out the Gulf (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Surface indications for
active seepage of methane-rich fluids were not observed
at any of the sites during this cruise, i.e. there was an

absence of typical chemosynthetic fauna (Kopf and partic-

Captain Arutyunov MV (CAMV, GeoB 9036-2, 9041-1,
9072-1), Ginsburg MV (GeoB 9061-1), Bonjardim MV
(GeoB 9051-1, 9051-2), Gemini MV (GeoB 9067-1), Un-
named MV (9063-1), and Hesperides MV (GeoB 9021-1).
Sediments consist mainly of gas-saturated homogeneous
mud breccias with low organic carbon content (Table 1).
Samples from Ginsburg MV were characterized by a dis-
tinct smell of petroleum. Gas hydrates, which have been
previously recovered from various sites (Mazurenko
et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005), were retrieved only
at CAMV.

3.1. Sediment sampling

Gravity cores generally were taken after prior investi-
gation with a video sled (OFOS—ocean floor observation
system) and sampling of shallow surface sediments using
a video-guided multi-corer (Niemann et al., 2006). The
cores were segmented in pieces of 1 m and cut lengthwise
in a cooled laboratory at about 6 ?C. Sediment samples
for pore water and gas analyses were collected within
1–2 h after retrieval. Although it is a well-known fact
that most (up to 95%) of the light hydrocarbon gases
are lost during core recovery, the remaining methane is
highly enriched above background values and can be
used for reliable flux calculations (Niewo?hner et al.,
1998) and isotope analyses (Wallace et al., 2000). Pore
waters were squeezed using a pressure filtration system
at pressures up to 5 bar and filtered through 0.45 lm cel-
lulose acetate membrane filters. Pore water samples were
then immediately analysed onboard or sub-sampled for
subsequent analysis. Sediment samples for pore water
hydrocarbon gas analysis were extruded and disaggregat-
ed in sealed 35 ml vials containing 10 ml of a 10%-KCl
solution to stop all microbial activity (Bowes and Horn-
ibrook, 2006).

pore water separation. Total alkalinity was determined by
titration (Ivanenkov and Lyakhin, 1978), whereas dis-
solved NH4 and total H2S were determined using standard
photometric procedures (Grasshoff et al., 1983). The
remaining pore waters were later analysed in the shore-
based laboratory at IFM-GEOMAR for dissolved anions
(SO4

2?, Cl?, I?, Br?) and cations (Na+, K+, Li+, Mg2+,
Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, B (boric acid), Si (silicic acid)) using
ion chromatography and optical ICP, respectively. Sub-
samples for dissolved element analyses (by ICP) were acid-
ified immediately after pore water squeezing to prevent any
precipitation of minerals due to depressurisation and
degassing.

Sediment porosity was calculated from the water con-
tent (weighing fresh and freeze-dried samples) assuming a
dry solid density of 2.65 g cm?3. Total organic carbon
was determined by flash combustion of freeze-dried and
ground using a Carlo Erba element analyser (NA1500)
with a relative standard deviation of about 1% for replicate
measurements. All analytical procedures applied on board
and at IFM-GEOMAR laboratories are described else-
where (Luff and Wallmann, 2003; Aloisi et al., 2004a)
and documented in detail at http://www.ifm-geomar.de/in-
dex.php?id=mg_analytik&amp;amp; L=.

Strontium isotopes were measured by thermal ionisation
mass spectrometry (TRITON at IFM-GEOMAR) after Sr
separation via ion exchange chromatography using a Sr-
specific resin. The average 87Sr/86Sr value for NBS 987
run during this study (n = 12) was 0.710249 ± 0.000020
(2r). Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of
pore waters were measured by mass spectrometry at the
GCA Laboratory in Sehnde (Germany) with a precision
of 0.3&amp;amp; (oxygen) and 3.1&amp;amp; (hydrogen) using lab-internal,
IAEA-calibrated standards (SLW: d18O = ?8.35&amp;amp; V-
SMOW, dD = ?58.4&amp;amp; V-SMOW; GRW: d18O =
?33.59&amp;amp; V-SMOW, dD = ?258.2&amp;amp; V-SMOW).

3.3. Gas analysis

Light hydrocarbon gases were stripped from samples
onboard by agitation of sediment in vials followed by an
equilibration period of 48 h. Headspace gas was removed
and stored for transport by injection into crimp-top vials
previously filled with a pH ? 1, 10% KCl solution. Light
hydrocarbon gas abundances were measured using a Vari-
an 3400 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a PLOT Q
capillary column (0.32 mm · 30 m) and a flame ionisation
detector (FID). Calibration standards for methane consist-
ed of a range of BOC (UK) alpha-gravimetric mixtures and
for C2 to C6 homologues a range of SCOTTY (UK)
standards.

Analyses of 13C/12C ratios in CH4 and C2H6 were con-
ducted by GC–combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(GC-C-IRMS) at Bristol University using a Thermoelec-
tron XP mass spectrometer. Light hydrocarbon gases were
separated on a PLOT Q capillary column (0.32 mm · 30 m)
and combusted to CO2 at 1000 ?C in a ceramic reactor con-

taining Cu and Pt wires. A high purity blend of 1% O2 in
helium was fed into the reactor at 0.2 ml min?1 to ensure
complete combustion. Calibration standards consisted of
BOC (UK) alpha-gravimetric gas mixtures that had been
analysed for d13C at external laboratories and a d13C–
CO2 gas standard from Oztech Corporation (USA). Stable
isotope ratios are reported in the standard delta (d) nota-
tion in units of permil (&amp;amp;) relative to Vienna Pee Dee
Belemnite (VPDB).

3.4. Geochemical modelling

Rates of upward fluid flow, pore water mixing and
AOM were determined by applying a reactive transport
model running on Mathematica? Version 5.0 (Schmidt
et al., 2005). The model considers molecular diffusion and
advection of dissolved SO4, CH4, Cl, and B. We applied
the general differential equation:

/ ? Dsed ? o½C?ox

? / ? v ?

? / ? RAOM

? / ? aðxÞ ? ðCðxÞ? Cð0ÞÞ; ð1Þ

where t is time (yr), x is sediment depth (cm), [C] is the con-
centration of the dissolved pore water species
(mmol dm?3), Dsed is the diffusion coefficient in the sedi-
ments (cm2 yr?1; corrected for tortuosity; (Boudreau,
1997), / is the sediment porosity (unitless), v is the velocity
of upward fluid flow (cm yr?1), RAOM is the rate of AOM
(in lmol dm?3 yr?1), a(x) is the depth-dependent pore
water-mixing coefficient (yr?1), and (C(x) ? C(0)) is the dif-
ference between the concentration at any depth and in
seawater.

The rate of AOM is calculated as:

RAOM ¼ kAOM ? ½SO4? ? ½CH4?; ð2Þ
where kAOM is the rate constant (dm

3 mmol?1 yr?1).
Sediment porosity changes with depth due to sediment

compaction. The depth profile is approximated by fitting
the measured porosity data with:

/ ¼ð/top ? /botÞ ? Expð?const ? xÞþ /bot; ð3Þ

where /bot and /top are the porosity at the base of each
core and at the sediment surface, and const is the attenua-
tion coefficient for the exponential decrease of porosity
with depth.

At most of the sites surficial mixing of seawater into the
sediment is observed within the first meter of the sediment.
This process can be identified by unusually weak gradients
in the upper part of pore water profiles and seems to be
common in the vicinity of cold seeps. It is likely caused
by density differences (inducing convection cells) between
upward flowing fluid and seawater or by flow effects
around morphological elevations (e.g. Henry et al., 1996;
Schmidt et al., 2005; Haese et al., 2006). For the simulation
of this fluid-mixing process a rate law formulation with a
depth-dependent mixing coefficient has been applied:

Boundary conditions were defined for the sediment sur-
face (0 cm) and the base of each respective core. The model
was run to steady state beginning from arbitrary initial
conditions. The upward flow and mixing rates were deter-
mined by fitting the model to the measured pore water geo-
chemical data.

sites with exception of Hesperides MV. Additional surface samples from
two multicorer cores at CAMV (9036-2) and Bonjardim MV (9051-1) are
included. The observed negative trend clearly indicates clay mineral
dehydration as the major fluid source. In general, the lowermost samples
in each core show the strongest enrichment in d18O and depletion in dD;
closer to the sediment–water interface dilution by seawater is overprinting
the fluid signature. The shaded ellipse corresponds to data reported by
(Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003) from eastern Mediterranean MVs. The

generally depleted, accompanied by a simultaneous in-
crease in alkalinity, from the AOM zone to the base of
the cores at all sites (Fig. 2a). Although significant differ-
ences exist between the sites, there is a general decrease
in Mg, K, and Br as well as an increase in Sr, Li, B, Ba,
and NH4 concentrations (Fig. 2b). The behaviour of Na
and Cl is not uniform. Whereas Cl-concentrations of the
fluids at CAMV and Hesperides MV are slightly enriched
with respect to seawater, Cl is depleted at all other sites.
The same trends are observed for Na with the exception
of Ginsburg MV where Na and Cl show opposite trends
with depth. These major characteristics are summarized
in Table 2.

4.1.2. Isotope data
Pore water samples from various depths in each core

have been used to characterize the stable oxygen- and
hydrogen-isotope systematics of the fluids. The results are
summarized in a d18O–dD plot (Fig. 3), which shows a
clear negative trend. Usually, the deepest sample from each
core shows the strongest deviation from seawater composi-
tion. Samples from different depths of CAMV cores (9041-
1, 9072-1) plot in the upper left panel of Fig. 3, indicating
the uniformity of fluid composition and a lack of dilution
by seawater. For comparison, the field of d18O–dD data
from eastern Mediterranean mud volcanoes (Da?hlmann
and De Lange, 2003) has been included in Fig. 3. The larg-
est offset from seawater composition occurs at Captain
Arutyunov and Ginsburg MVs.

One sample from the base of each core from Captain
Arutyunov, Ginsburg, and Bonjardim MVs has been used

Dwere measured to assess the origin of light hydrocarbon

gases in MV fluids. In spite of considerable loss in con-
centration during core recovery, the measured methane
concentrations are still highly elevated above seawater
values and appropriately reflect the in situ trend in shal-
low sediment layers (Fig. 2a). In fact, investigations by
(Wallace et al., 2000) did not show systematic deviations
between the d13C-values of methane from standard (de-
gassed) and pressurized cores, implying that fraction-
ation due to degassing is negligible. The overall results
are summarized in Table 3. Gases at Bonjardim and
Ginsburg MVs appear to possess clearly thermogenic
signatures, exhibiting low CH4/(C2H6 + C3H8) ratios
and 13C-enriched CH4 and C2H6. Gas in pore fluids
at CAMV is unusual because it has a high CH4/
ater at the study sites

5. Discussion

5.1. Fluid advection and mixing processes

The purity of the geochemical signature of the pore
water is dependent on the overall advection rate of the
upward migrating fluid and irrigation processes in the
subsurface sediments. In order to derive quantitatively
well-constrained estimates of the advection rate we per-
formed numerical model runs with conservative (Cl, B)
and reacting parameters (SO4, CH4). Under environmental
conditions met in the uppermost surface layers, Cl and B
can be considered as geochemically conservative and hence
their depth profiles provide useful parameters to estimate
upward rates of fluid flow (Martin et al., 1996; Aloisi
et al., 2004a; Haese et al., 2006). The consistency of flux
rates can be checked by simultaneously modelling reactive
solutes (e.g., SO4 and CH4). In addition, the transition zone
of SO4 and CH4 (AOM; Fig. 2a) is a perfect measure of the
depth of near-surface mixing and oxidation processes in the
vicinity of a vent site. A more detailed discussion of AOM
at Gulf of Cadiz MVs is given in (Niemann et al., 2006).

All model parameters used to produce the fitted curves
shown in Fig. 5 are summarized in Table 4. In general,
good and internally consistent curve fits for Cl, B, and
SO4 could be produced for all sites. The scatter in Cl-pro-
files below 50 cm bsf at CAMV is attributed to the occur-
rence of gas hydrate at this site, and hence the maximum
Cl-concentration measured in each of the cores has been
used as the lower boundary (maximum) concentration in
the model. In these cases, B is a more reliable parameter be-
cause pore water concentrations are less affected by the
presence of gas hydrates due to the high concentration dif-
ference between seawater and MV pore fluid. The location
of the AOM zone and the resulting reaction rates in the

model are strongly dependent on methane concentrations
prescribed at the lower boundary (CH4(B)). With the
exceptions of Hesperides and No Name MVs (GeoB
9021-1 and GeoB9063-1, respectively), the CH4(B) concen-
tration corresponds to (CAMV; GeoB9041 and
GeoB9072), or is slightly below the ambient methane solu-
bility with respect to gas hydrate stability (Tishchenko
et al., 2005). As outlined above (Section 3.1), the large dis-
crepancy between measured and modelled concentrations
is due to the significant decrease of methane solubility
and degassing during core recovery. Hence, the MV fluids
are probably saturated with CH4 at all sites, except at Hes-
perides and No Name MVs, where upward fluid flow rates
are low and SO4 penetrates deeply into the sediment so that
saturation levels of dissolved CH4 cannot be expected with-
in the core depth.

Shallow near-surface gradients of all solutes are ex-
plained by active admixing of bottom water, which seems

to be a typical feature at cold vents (Henry et al., 1996;
Schmidt et al., 2005; Haese et al., 2006). Due to the elevat-
ed advective flow velocities, the mixing zone is very thin in
the CAMV cores and only resolved by multicorer sampling
(Niemann et al., 2006). Overall, flux rates decrease from
CAMV to Hesperides MV in the order listed in Table 4
(from left to right). This decrease is in accordance with
the preservation of the fluid signal: the higher the advective
flux, the lower is the admixing of seawater and hence the
purer the fluid composition. Effective diffusive exchange be-
tween pore fluids and bottom water is limited to the upper-
most centimetres of the sediment when the flow rates
exceed a threshold of some centimetres per year (Luff and
Wallmann, 2003).

The unusual situation of high sulphate levels in rising
fluids at Ginsburg MV required inhibition of AOM in
the model below the maximum mixing depth in order to
produce consistent results. The coexistence of SO4 and

CH4 in the deeper part of the core further indicates that
AOM must be attenuated along the flow path, because mi-
crobes may fail to find favourable growth conditions within
the flowing medium.

Seawater intrusion at Ginsburg MV cannot account for
the SO4 enrichment in MV fluids as they are almost entirely
depleted of K and Mg (Fig. 2). We suspect that high SO4
levels are caused by dissolution of anhydrite or gypsum
at greater depth (see also Section 5.2.2). In contrast to
Ginsburg MV (GeoB9061-1), the very slight increase of sul-
phate at CAMV (GeoB 9072-1) can be readily attributed to
a&amp;lt;10% admixing of seawater as it is accompanied by a
similar increase of K and Mg and an obvious decrease of
Ba-levels (Fig. 2). These hypotheses are further substantiat-
ed by the calculation of saturation levels (X) for barite
(using average Ba and SO4 concentrations of the cores
9072-1 and 9061-1 below the AOM and the solubility con-
stant for barite in seawater provided by (Aloisi et al.,
2004b) which indicate highly supersaturated fluids at
CAMV (X &gt; 3) and undersaturated fluids (X &amp;lt;0.5) at
Ginsburg MV. Since precipitation kinetics of barite are rel-
atively slow (Aloisi et al., 2004b) supersaturation is indica-
tive of a non-equilibrated system (recent seawater admixing
into Ba-rich fluid) whereas the undersaturated fluids may
have had sufficient time for equilibration due to the deep
source of SO4.

5.2. Origin of the fluids

5.2.1. Evidence for clay mineral dehydration

As demonstrated by numerical modelling, the most ac-
tive sites of fluid advection are GeoB 9041-1 and 9072-1
located at CAMV. The compilation dD and d18O values
of pore water samples from all investigated sites (Fig. 3) re-
veals a clear negative correlation which is typical for water
that has been released by clay mineral dehydration, most
likely by the transformation of smectite to illite (Sheppard
and Gilg, 1996; Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003). This
observation is in accordance with data from Mediterranean
Ridge mud volcanoes (Fig. 3) and earlier observations at
Yuma and Ginsburg MVs in the Gulf of Cadiz (Mazur-
enko et al., 2003), although interpreted differently by the
latter authors. The major temperature field for this process
ranges between 60 and 150 ?C (Freed and Peacor, 1989;
Chan and Kastner, 2000). Applying an average geothermal
gradient of 30 ?C per km, the upper limit of formation
depth would be approximately 5 km bsf, which comprises
the lower sedimentary units deposited on basement rocks
(Medialdea et al., 2004).

Due to the complex stratigraphic and tectonic develop-
ment in this area it is difficult to unambiguously identify
the ‘‘source rocks’’. Potential sedimentary sources to be
considered belong to the Sub-Betic and other Mesozoic
units as well as the so-called Allochthonous Unit of the
Gulf of Cadiz (AUGC) comprising mainly Tertiary and
Mesozoic shales and marls, which are overlain by up to
1 km of Plio-Quaternary hemipelagic sediments and pene-
volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz—indications ..., Geochim.

trated by deep-reaching faults (Medialdea et al., 2004; Pin-
heiro et al., 2005). An abundance of smectite has been
reported in sediments affected by terrigeneous input
(Chamley, 1989; Reicherter and Pletsch, 2000). However,
the clear stable isotopes signal (Fig. 3) strongly suggests
that the release of freshwater at greater depth is the quan-
titatively dominant process of fluid formation in this area.
The upward migration of the overpressured fluids occurs
under tectonic control, causing the liquefaction of sedi-
ments and the formation of mud volcanoes, which appear
to be located along deep strike–slip faults and thrusts, or
at fault intersections (Pinheiro et al., 2005; Fig. 1).

5.2.2. Overprinting of the fluid signature by secondary

processes

In principle, the release of mineral-bound water results
in a general freshening of pore fluids reflected by decreased
concentrations of Na and Cl, and other major solutes
(Fig. 2). Such a dilution trend is also depicted in Fig. 6.
However, deviations from the mixing line between seawater
and fluid suggest the occurrence of additional processes
leading to coeval and subsequent overprinting of the fluid
composition. Whereas Na is relatively enriched with re-
spect to Cl, Mg, and K are considerably depleted. Similar
observations have been reported from mud volcano sites
at different continental margins around the world (Martin
et al., 1996; Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004).

Relative Na enrichments over Cl are thought to be a di-
rect consequence of the transformation of smectite to illite

where Na is released into solution. The increase in Na is then
a simple function of the relative amount of Na to H2O in the
smectite. This, however, is difficult to estimate since the Na–
H2O ratio of natural smectites is a quite variable factor.
Considering, for the moment, only those sites where the
pore water chlorinity indicates freshening, there is a clear
trend in Na increase in the order: No Name MV (?seawater
dilution) &amp;lt;Bonjardim MV &amp;lt;Gemini MV &amp;lt;Ginsburg MV.
In simple terms, this would mean that the Na content in the
original smectite would have shown an increase in the same
order of sites. This relation is more clearly illustrated in
Fig. 7. Assuming that the observed dilutions with respect
to seawater are caused by ‘‘dissolution’’ of a typical smectite
(montmorillonite) containing 15 wt% of water (Sheppard
and Gilg, 1996), the relative amount of Na in the smectites
can be calculated by matching the observed endmember
concentration in each core. In the same order of MVs as giv-
en above this would be 0.004, 0.007, 0.028, and 0.12 mol Na
per mol of smectite.

Specifically for Ginsburg MV these observations are,
however, inconsistent with isotope data (Fig. 3) and mod-
elled advection rates (Fig. 5 and Table 4) as, in theory, the
degree of freshening should be in accordance with the iso-
tope signal and with the rate of fluid flow. Hence, this obvi-
ous contradiction at Ginsburg MV suggests that other
processes release Na into solution, preferentially without
altering the isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen.

The incongruent dissolution of Na-feldspars (albite to
kaolinite; Eq. (5)) could be considered as one possibility,

Unfortunately, this process would theoretically counteract
the observed dD trend (Fig. 3) and the freshening of the flu-
id as it consumes considerable amounts of water.

However, we believe that all observations discussed
above can be consistently explained by the simple addition
of NaCl (from leaching of halite) to a freshened fluid. In
contrast to the sites exhibiting pore water freshening, fluids
from Captain Arutyunov are enriched in both Na and Cl
(Fig. 7) and the approximately constant Na/Cl ratio of 1
at CAMV indicates the dissolution of halite (e.g. Bernas-
coni, 1999). However, typical brines resulting from leach-
ing of halite usually exhibit much higher concentrations
of NaCl. This implies that the measured concentration of
600 mM can only be explained by a mild leaching of NaCl.
Adding some NaCl to seawater would, however, not yield a
fluid with a Na/Cl ratio of 1. Taking into account that this
site exhibits the highest advection rates in combination
with the clearest dD and d18O signal of all sites within
the study area, we may conclude that a strongly freshened
fluid is dissolving halite at depth. For such a low salinity
fluid only slight additions of Na released during clay min-
eral transformation are needed in order to shift the NaCl
ratio from 0.87 (in seawater) to about 1. In the same
way, the opposite trends at Ginsburg MV (Cl-depletion
and Na-enrichment) can be sufficiently explained, by sim-
ply leaching less NaCl by a freshened, but slightly more
Na-enriched original fluid. In order to obtain an approxi-
mation to the original Cl concentration at Ginsburg MV
and CAMV we used the obvious relation between Cl and
d18O at those sites, which are not affected by halite dissolu-
tion. As data from Gemini MV may also indicate some off-

Pset, we only used seawater and concentrations from NoName and Bonjardim MVs to produce the exponential fit
shown in Fig. 8. From this relation we can deduce that ori-
ginal Cl concentrations of freshened fluids at may have
been between 250 mM (Ginsburg MV) and ?230 mM
(CAMV) and about 270–370 mM Cl have been added by
leaching of halite, respectively. In addition, we (re)-calcu-
lated the molar Na fractions of smectites that would be re-
quired to produce the measured Na/Cl ratios at Gemini
MV (0.02), Ginsburg MV (0.012), and CAMV (0.075).
The considerably decreased Na fractions at Gemini and
Ginsburg MVs further support the hypothesis since they
imply less regional variability of natural smectites in the
volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz—indications ..., Geochim.

working area. In addition, data from a very recent cruise
by RV Merian in May 2006 revealed the unequivocal evi-
dence for the existence of strongly saline brines in mud vol-
cano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz. Nearly NaCl-saturated
and strongly SO4-enriched (80 mM) have been reported
from Mercator MV (some 30 km east of Ginsburg MV to-
wards the Moroccan coast; M. Haeckel, pers. comm., RV
Maria S. Merian cruise MSM01/3, 2006). As outlined in
Section 5.1, elevated pore water SO4 concentrations at Gin-
burg MV most likely result from leaching of gypsiferous
clays and brecciae that generally cap deposition centres in
the Gharb Basin (Maestro et al., 2003; Medialdea et al.,
2004).

In contrast, slightly decreasing Na/Cl ratios at Hesperi-
des MV (Fig. 7) may indicate evaporated seawater or resid-
ual brines as a potential source in Hesperides MV (e.g.
(McCaffrey et al., 1987). However, low advection rates at
Hesperides MV cause a weak geochemical signal and
hence, this interpretation is more speculative and will not
be discussed in more detail.

Mg and K are strongly depleted in pore fluids at all sites
(with the exception of K in No Name MV fluids; Fig. 6). In
principle, the level of depletion is a function of advection
rates, where the greatest advection produces the largest
composition offset from seawater. The most likely explana-
tion for the K-depletion in MV fluids is its integration into
illite during clay mineral transformation (Martin et al.,
1996; Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004). Moreover,
K is considered to be a major factor controlling the kinetics
of smectite to illite transformation and the lack of K may
even cause incomplete reaction (Spinelli and Underwood,
2004; Cuadros, 2006). This case is strengthened by the
strong correlation of K with either increasing d18O, as
depicted in Fig. 9, or with decreasing dD. In contrast, there
is no correlation between Na and d18O–H2O values result-
ing from dissolution of halite affecting Na and Cl levels in
pore water as outlined above.

The depletion in Mg and Ca at all sites (Fig. 2) can be
ascribed to carbonate precipitation at any depth below core
penetration. Although calcium carbonate precipitation
related to AOM can be assumed, Ca-depletion below the
AOM zone is typical for all sites. Hence, low Ca concentra-
tions controlled by high levels of alkalinity (generated by
organic matter breakdown and submarine weathering pro-
cesses) are an inherent feature of the upward migrating flu-
ids before reaching the surface sediments. The slight
curvature of the Mg concentration depth profile (Fig. 2)
or in the Mg vs. Cl plot shown in Fig. 6 does indicate the
occurrence of co-precipitation of authigenic Mg-calcite
related to AOM, although low Mg-levels are most proba-
bly largely controlled by the dolomitisation of widespread
Tertiary and Mesozoic carbonates (Maldonado et al.,
1999; Medialdea et al., 2004) deeper within the mud
volcanoes.

5.2.3. High temperature imprint in the fluid signature

The most obvious enrichments observed are those in B,
Li, and Sr (Figs. 2 and 6). B- and Li-enriched fluids are
well-known from numerous locations along active conti-
nental margins worldwide (You et al., 1993; Martin
et al., 1996; Chan and Kastner, 2000; Haese et al., 2003;
Aloisi et al., 2004a; Hensen et al., 2004) and may be pri-
marily released from clay minerals (Brumsack and Zuleger,
1992). Under experimental conditions simulating hydro-
thermal alteration of hemipelagic sediments Li is enriched
preferentially over B as temperatures increase above
150 ?C (You et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1999; You and Gies-
kes, 2001). The B/Li ratio in the Gulf of Cadiz fluids is con-
sistently &gt;10; however, Li concentrations as high as
700 lM and B abundances up to 15 mM are amongst the
highest levels reported to date from offshore cold seep envi-
ronments (Aloisi et al., 2004a; Godon et al., 2004; Haese
et al., 2006). Hence, the low ratios instead may be caused
by different mechanisms of Li and B release or different
source-rock potentials, rather than being an indicator of
low temperature alteration. For comparison, vent fluids
at the convergent margin off Costa Rica are thought to
be derived from sources having temperatures up to
150 ?C; here, only B, but no Li enrichments were detected
(Hensen et al., 2004). Similar results are reported from
freshened mud volcano fluids of the Mediterranean Ridge
(De Lange and Brumsack, 1998; Haese et al., 2006; Haese,
personal communication). In contrast, fluids detected
along distinct fault zones at ODP site 1040 at the Costa
Rica margin (Chan and Kastner, 2000) are similar in com-
position to the vent fluids but are enriched in Li up to
300 mM. This finding rather suggests that deep and shal-
low fluid systems at the Costa Rica convergent margin
are less well connected and the transmission of any original
high temperature signal may be affected by the amount of
mixing with other fluids and various reactions occurring
along the flow path. However, following the results of
(You and Gieskes, 2001), we propose that Li-enrich-
ments—at least above certain threshold value—are indica-
volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz—indications ..., Geochim.

tive for geochemical reactions occurring at temperatures
above 150 ?C. This hypothesis is further strengthened by
data from other vent locations: higher Li, but lower B val-
ues have been reported from MV fluids in the Black Sea
(Aloisi et al., 2004a) and Barbados accretionary complex
(Godon et al., 2004). Similar Li enrichments at the Peru
convergent margin observed by (Martin et al., 1991) have
been ascribed to alteration of oceanic basement at moder-
ate to high temperatures. Enrichments in B of up to 15 mM
are atypical for hydrothermal fluids; hence such extreme
levels must be caused by extensive leaching of sedimentary
B. This may also include the release of lattice-bound B,
which makes up a significant part of the sedimentary B res-
ervoir and which is remobilised at temperatures of approx-
imately 300 ?C (You and Gieskes, 2001; Kopf et al., 2003).

Because Li is only highly enriched at Captain Arutyu-
nov and Bonjardim MVs, but B-levels are elevated at all
sites where advection rates exceed 0.1 cm yr?1 (Table 4
and Fig. 6) we hypothesize that the fluid, which is predom-
inantly derived from clay mineral dehydration, has been
subject to injection of basement derived fluids, which are
likely Li-enriched and may additionally contribute to high-
er levels of B and Li from leaching of clays at temperatures
&gt;150 ?C. Interestingly vent fluids from mid-ocean ridges
buried beneath sedimentary cover (Von Damm et al.,
1985, 2005) reach similar levels. This is illustrated by the
compilation of Li and B concentrations of various hydro-
thermal and cold vent sites in Fig. 10. Low-temperature
alteration sites (I) are characterised by high B/Li ratios
and low (&lt;100 lM) Li concentrations, high-temperature al-
tered cold vent (II) and sediment covered hydrothermal
vent sites (IV) show low B/Li ratios accompanied by high
(&gt;350 lM) Li concentrations, and hydrothermal vents at

ridge crests (III) lack a significant B component revealing
Li/B ratios&amp;lt;1. Thus, CAMV in particular may represent
the cool end member of a hydrothermal injection system
beneath a thick sedimentary cover, resulting in the enrich-
ment of B versus Li (Chan et al., 1999). The fact that we do
not observe typical hydrothermal signals, like K and Ca
enrichments, can be ascribed to subsequent depletion by
smectite-illite transformation and calcium carbonate pre-
cipitation, respectively. As discussed above, both processes
are unambiguously occurring in the subsurface of the mud
volcano sites and, moreover, the supply of K is well known
to be limiting for the smectite-to-illite reaction (e.g. Boles
and Franks, 1979; Cuadros, 2006). Overall, Mg depletions
are also well in line with the impact of hydrothermal solu-
tions, even though low Mg levels are also a likely result of
dolomite precipitation.

This general hypothesis is supported by additional
observations. For example, B and Li enrichments correlate
generally with Sr suggesting a common release mechanism
during fluid formation. Sr-enriched fluids are typically
considered to result from carbonate recrystallisation,
which may reduce the Sr content of carbonate minerals
by as much as an order of magnitude (Morse and Mac-
kenzie, 1990). Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonates are wide-
spread in the Gulf of Cadiz and may provide potential Sr-
sources at all sites investigated. However, analyses of
87Sr/86Sr ratios suggest that Sr originated from disparate
fluid sources at the different MV sites (Fig. 4). Fluids at
Bonjardim and Ginsburg MVs contain less-radiogenic
Sr, which at Ginsburg MV (GeoB9061) may be related
to dissolution of Tertiary and Cretaceous carbonates
and evaporites (Burke et al., 1982; Banner, 2004) as sug-
gested by the high sulphate levels at this site. However, be-
selected cold vents (I, II), hydrothermal vents (III), sediment covered
us similarity between fluids of fields II and IV, which are characterised by
tions (&gt;350 mM), implying that a high temperature imprint is preserved in
300 ?C (You and Gieskes, 2001) are presented for comparison. CR, Costa

cause Bonjardim MV likely is underlain by oceanic crust
(Gutscher, 2004; Medialdea et al., 2004) and Li is more
enriched at this site, 87Sr/86Sr ratios may rather point to
leaching of oceanic crust imprinting on the fluid composi-
tion. The radiogenic signature at CAMV suggests that sig-
nificant interaction has occurred between fluids and
continental crust material. This finding is supported by
deep seismic studies, which have shown that the eastern
part of the Gulf of Cadiz is underlain by thick continental
crust covered by the Betic–Rifean Allochthonous Units
(Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2001; Medialdea et al., 2004;
Zeyen et al., 2005). As shown in Figs. 2 and 6, fluids from
CAMV (and to some degree from Bonjardim MV also)
exhibit a strong correlation between Li, B, and Sr and
are offset from the other sites. Since Sr is also relatively
enriched (with respect to seawater) in continental crust
and terrigeneous sediments (shales), this finding supports
the hypothesis of simultaneous ‘‘leaching’’ of these ele-
ments from clay minerals at moderate to high tempera-
tures. Overall, the observations are consistent with data
from the convergent margin off Chile where different
87Sr/86Sr ratios of Li-enriched fluids are interpreted to
be caused by interaction with different crustal sources
(Martin et al., 1991).

Likewise, the molecular and isotopic composition of
light volatile hydrocarbon gases in expulsion fluids at
CAMV is unusual. The gases have a clear thermogenic ori-
gin at Ginsburg and Bonjardim MVs (Table 3). The com-
position of CAMV gas also indicates a thermogenic
origin, as shown by the stable carbon isotope signature
of ethane in gas hydrates recovered at this site (Table 3).
However, the high enrichment in methane cannot result
from an admixture of migrated thermogenic gas and shal-
low microbial methane, due to very low microbial
methanogenic activity in the shallow sediments (M. Nuzzo,
unpublished data). This finding is in agreement with sedi-
ment TOC abundances that never exceed ?0.5% (Table
1) and generally low fluid concentrations of NH4 and Br
(Fig. 2b, Table 2; (Martin et al., 1993). A catagenic origin
of the methane expelled at CAMV is thus a more likely
hypothesis, consistent with fluid geochemical indications
for temperatures in excess of 150 ?C. In this line of evi-
dence, increased NH4 concentrations at CAMV (Fig. 2)
could be the result of the thermal alteration of organic
material as reported from sediment covered hydrothermal
vents (Thornton and Seyfried, 1987).

Expulsion of hydrothermally affected fluids at Bonjar-
dim and Captain Arutyunov MVs, but not at Ginsburg
MV is consistent with the locations of these edifices in dif-
ferent structural environments within the Gulf of Cadiz.
Bonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs appear to be sit-
uated along major crustal strike–slip faults associated with
the Africa/Eurasia Plate Boundary (Duarte et al., 2005),
for which no evidence exists at Ginsburg MV (Fig. 1). It
has indeed been shown that stress is released at strike–slip
faults, thus focussing the expulsion of deep over-pressured
fluids (Behrens, 1988; Tobin et al., 1993). The emplacement

of Bonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs may actually
be the result of intersecting strike–slip and thrust faults,
which reduces compression and favours stress release by
fluid advection (Chamot-Rooke et al., 2005). In contrast
to Bonjardim and Captain Arutyunov MVs, fluids at Gins-
burg MV likely are expulsed along extensional and thrust
faults, similar to other MVs of the Moroccan margin
(Van Rensbergen et al., 2005).

Theoretically, the continuous rise of warm fluids should
be accompanied by an increased heat flow, which is not the
case since average geothermal gradients at all sites are
about 20–40 ?C per km (Kopf and participants, 2004).
However, comparatively low overall advection rates (Table
4) and insignificant emissions of methane into the overlying
seawater (Niemann et al., 2006) are indicative for low pres-
ent day expulsion rates. Variations in the activity of the
mud volcanoes have been suggested earlier for this region
(Pinheiro et al., 2003) and are in agreement with observa-
tions from various convergent margin settings where fluid
advection along deep fault zones has been identified as a
highly dynamic process which is subject to significant vari-
ations over time (e.g. Moore and Mascle, 1987; Martin
et al., 1991; Saffer and Bekins, 1999; Hensen and Wall-
mann, 2005). Since a heat pulse equilibrates much faster
in surface sediments compared to a geochemical signal as
soon as the supply is disconnected, the present day geo-
chemical composition of the fluids may be represent an im-
print of the latest fluid pulse.
6. Conclusions

Fluid geochemistry at MVs in the Gulf of Cadiz indi-
cates that major fluid formation and overpressuring is
caused by clay mineral dehydration at several kilometres
depth and temperatures of up to 150 ?C, which is in agree-
ment with the occurrence of thermogenic methane and sim-
ilar observations at numerous cold vent areas worldwide
(e.g. Martin et al., 1996; Da?hlmann and De Lange, 2003;
Hensen et al., 2004). Quantitatively, the fluid composition
can be largely explained by the transformation of smectite
to illite; however a number of subsequent processes mask-
ing the primary fluid composition could be either proven or
strongly implied. These processes include the dissolution of
halite as well as anhydrite or gypsum, the precipitation of
calcium carbonate and dolomite, and potentially the
admixing of evaporated brines.

Very strong enrichments of the minor elements Li and B
(CAMV and Bonjardim MV) suggest high temperature
alterations (&gt;150 ?C) related to fluid mobilisation along
fault systems cutting deeply into the underlying basement.
Element enrichments may be caused by elevated concentra-
tions in rising hydrothermal fluids and/or additional leach-
ing of these elements from the sediments at higher
temperatures. A compilation of various hot and cold vent
sites (Fig. 10) suggests that strong Li enrichments in combi-
nation with moderate B/Li ratios may be a good indicator for
volcano fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz—indications ..., Geochim.

this type of processes. At least at CAMV, this observation is
in line with the composition of CH4-enriched, light volatile
hydrocarbon gases. In addition, correlations between Li,
B, and Sr, particularly at Bonjardim MV and CAMV, sug-
gest that elevated Sr concentrations result from long-term
leaching of crustal rocks and sediments, whereas differences
in 87Sr/86Sr ratios may be caused by differences in the nature
of underlying crustal material (oceanic vs. continental).

All processes discussed in this study are summarized in
a simplified diagram (Fig. 11) showing the suggested flow
path of the fluids along major faults cutting through an
idealized sequence of sedimentary rocks in the Gulf of
Cadiz (after Medialdea et al., 2004). Although the occur-
rence of a number of processes cannot be resolved unam-
biguously, the suggested interpretation provides a
comprehensive overview and raises the important question
to what extent higher temperature reactions, perhaps in
underlying basement, are linked to the processes control-
ling mud volcanism and seepage of cold vents in general.
However, the overall driving force of mud volcanism in
the Gulf of Cadiz is—as in many accretionary and non-
accretionary margins—clearly caused by clay mineral
transformation.

Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 A-1

 

 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, 

sample collection and underwater observations 

 

 

A large number of methodologies and techniques, commonly used in marine geology 

and geophysics, were used to identify seafloor structures which based on their size, shape 

and backscatter intensity, potentially represent mud volcanoes or seeps. Ground-truthing 

through coring, dredging and sampling with TV-controlled grabs together with underwater 

seafloor video observations were used to confirm the nature of these structures. In this 

appendix the scientific cruises which contributed with data for this thesis are briefly 

presented. The several geophysical, sampling and underwater observation techniques are 

described, the instrumentation used is presented and a brief overview of the data 

processing is described.

A.2 Navigation 

Positioning during the TTR cruises was acquired with an Ashtech GG24 DPS + 

GLONASS receiver, allowing an optimal static accuracy of ± 35 cm (75 cm at 95% 

confidence limits). The normal accuracy, under normal satellite configuration, in the Gulf 

of Cadiz area is assumed as ca. 5 m. 

Underwater navigation during deep towed operations, such as the deep towed side-

scan sonar (MAK1 and OREtech), deep-towed video system and TV-controlled grab was 

based on the Sigma-1001 hydroacoustic system. This system consists on a pinger fitted at 

the deep-towed equipment, operating between 7-15 kHz and four stationary hull-mounted 

acoustic receivers, spaced 14 m apart. The signal emitted by the deep-towed pinger is 

tracked on board and accurate x,y position of the device is computed in relation to the 

vessel, taking into account the vessel roll, trim and speed. The error of the estimated 



 

Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 A-5

position of the deep-towed equipment by this system usually does not exceed 1-2% of the 

water depth. 

For gravity corer seabed sampling, the error in positioning is normally 5% of the 

accuracy of the vessel position, due to their rapid deployment. 

Navigation on board the D. Carlos I (Matespro and Delila 1 cruises), Sonne, Cornide 

de Saavedra and Belgica was carried out using both Global Positioning System (GPS) and 

Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), installed in one or in multiple positions of 

the vessel. The two systems were used in order to allow the necessary accuracy in position 

determination, as well as the necessary yaw corrections to be used by the multibeam 

systems. 

 

A.3 Multibeam bathymetry and backscatter reflectivity 

A.3.1 Matespro and Delila 1 cruises (NRP D. carlos I) 

A.3.1.1 Data acquisition 

The NRP D Carlos I is equipped with a SIMRAD EM 120 multibeam system and 

bathymetric echo sounders: Marimatech E-Sea Sound 206S (15 kHz), an Atlas Deso 20 (33 

and 210 kHz) profiler and acoustic Doppler current profiler: RDI Ocean Surveyor (38 and 

150 kHz). The SIMRAD EM 120 nominal sonar frequency is 12 kHz with an angular 

coverage sector of up to 150 degrees and 191 beams per ping as narrow as 1 degree. 

Achievable swath width on a flat bottom will normally be approximately six times the 

water depth. The transmit fan is split into several individual sectors with independent 

active steering according to vessel roll, pitch and yaw. This places all soundings on a “best 

fit” to a line perpendicular to the survey line, thus ensuring a uniform sampling of the 

bottom and 100% coverage. The sectors are frequency coded (11.25 to 12.60 kHz), and 

they are all transmitted sequentially at each ping. The sector steering is fully taken into 

account when the position and depth of each sounding is calculated, as is the refraction due 

to the sound speed profile, vessel attitude and installation angles. Pulse length and range 

sampling rate are variable with depth for best resolution, and in shallow waters due care is 

taken to account for near field effects. The ping rate is mainly limited by the round trip 

travel time in the water up to a ping rate of 5 Hz. 



 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations 

 

 A-6 

The system depth accuracy is very high due to the narrow beams and a high sampling 

rate is used (2 kHz). The expected total system RMS accuracy (assuming good external 

sensor data) is: 0.2% of depth (from nadir up to 45 degrees), 0.3% of the depth (up to 60 

degrees), and 0.5% of the depth (between 60 and 70 degrees). More information about this 

system can be found at the system manufacturer site: www.kongsberg.com. 

The MATESPRO and Delila 1 Multibeam surveys were performed according to an 

Order 3 Hydrographic Survey Standard (Standards for Hydrographic Surveys, 1998). This 

means that accurate and true sound velocity profiles had to be acquired during the survey 

and that all areas were covered by verification lines crossing the main survey direction at 

90 degrees. The verification lines covered 10% of the surveyed area. In order to minimize 

vertical and lateral errors associated with the external beams, and depending on the state of 

the sea, an maximum opening angle of 120º (and in some cases 60-70°) was used instead 

of maximum angular range of 150º, restricting the coverage to a maximum of 14 km wide 

swath to gain an more continuous spacing of beams on the ocean floor. 

The distribution of the water masses in the Gulf of Cadiz is a crucial aspect for the 

conversion of the recorded SIMRAD EM120 travel times into depth values. This is 

particularly important in the Gulf of Cadiz where there is a strong influence on the sound 

velocity along the water column as a result of the presence of the saline and warm 

Mediterranean outflow water (MOW). Therefore, sound velocity profiles (SVP) were 

performed at the rate of 1 per day during the Matespro and Delila 1 crises. During the GAP 

cruise, CTDOS (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth, Oxygen, Salinity), CTD 

(Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) were used, while XBTs were used during the RV 

Belgica Cadipor cruise, to calculate the sound velocity profiles on the water column. 

Climatological profiles of the Gulf of Cadiz region were also used to constrain the water 

column sound velocity. 

A.3.1.2 Data processing 

The processing of the multibeam data consists in a sequence of procedures that were 

performed by the dedicated software package CARIS-HIPS. The steps generally used are: 

i) Conversion of the raw data from the native acquisition format to the application 

format 

ii) Quality control of the raw data 

iii) Automatic removal of outliers with dedicated filters/procedures 



 

Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 A-7

iv) Manual/semi-automatic removal of outliers 

v) Generation of cruise grids 

vi) Integration with other available data sets. 

The processing of the Matespro raw data was performed using the CARIS-HIPS 

software packaged (by the Instituto Hidrografico processing team). The backscatter data 

recorded by the SIMRAD EM-120 system was recovered and processed first by the MB-

System (J. Luis, Univ. Algarve) and by the CARAIBES package (S. Diez, UTM-CSIC, 

Barcelona). 

The grids cleaned were then converted and imported into the ArcGIS GIS system and 

integrated with the regional GIS database. 

A.3.2 GAP cruise (RV Sonne) 

During the R/V Sonne GAP cruise, a Simrad EM120 multibeam echosounder was 

used for continuous mapping of the seafloor. 

To convert the recorded travel times into depth several water velocity profiles were 

obtained with the shipboard CTD. During this cruise, handling of the bathymetric data was 

done by the ship’s navigation system administrators. Each beam was corrected for ray 

bending using the appropriate sound velocity profile and the ship’s motion, and finally 

stored with GPS position. To generate the bathymetric maps the data were averaged using 

the nearest neighbour gridding algorithm, using and displayed with the GMT mapping 

software (Wessel and Smith, 1991, 1995). However, data were not edited for clean bad 

beams. The final gridded data was converted into ArcGIS format and integrated in the GIS 

database of the Gulf of Cadiz. 

 

A.4 Seismic profiles 

A.4.1 PSAT seismic profiles 

A.4.1.1 Data acquisition 

Single channel seismic reflection profiles were acquired throughout the TTR cruises. 

The seismic source consisted of two 3.5 litre airguns, at a pressure of 150 atm. The airguns 

were towed at a depth of approximately 3.5 meters and were shot every 10 seconds 



 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations 

 

 A-8 

(approximately every 30 meters). The streamer consisted of one active section, 25 meters 

long, with 50 hydrophones, towed at a depth of approximately 3.5 meters. The offset 

between the seismic source and the centre of the live hydrophone array was 230 meters. 

Throughout the seismic acquisition, the average ship’s speed was about 6.5 knots. 

The data was acquired digitally using the MSU developed software and preliminary 

processed with the RadExPro software, which was provided to the UNESCO MSU Centre 

for Marine Geosciences by GDS Productions, Moscow. The trace legth is 8s and the 

sampling rate is 1 ms. The signals were filtered analogically 30-250 Hz in the acquisition 

stage. The preliminary on board processing was carried out using both the RadExPro 

software and the SPW processing system (Seismic Processing Workshop). The basic 

processing sequence consisted of static shifts correction, amplitude recovery by spherical 

divergence correction and simple bandpass filtering (5-20-250-300 Hz). Signature 

deconvolution and phase-shift migration were also applied to some of the seismic lines to 

attenuate the bubble pulse and to better image the near-surface geological structure. 

A.4.1.2 Post-cruise data processing 

Post cruise processing of the seismic data collected during the TTR10, 11, 12, 14 and 

15 cruises within the Gulf of Cadiz was performed in collaboration with Dr Serguei 

Bouriak using the SPW processing software (Bouriak, 2003). 

The principal aim of the processing was to prepare the data sets for structural 

interpretation, attempting to enhance the traceability of deep reflections, with recovering of 

their true geometry. The processing flow included predictive deconvolution, time-variant 

Butterworth filtering, spherical divergence correction, muting, automatic gain control, and 

phase shift migration, as well as some additional subsidiary procedures (e.g. automatic 

trace edit) when necessary. Some lines, where the water depths variations were significant, 

required flattening of the seafloor with static shifts prior to time-variant filtering, with 

posterior recovery of the initial topography. A characteristic example of an SPW 

processing flow used for the processing of the data sets is shown on Figure A.2

A.4.2 Multichannel seismics 

Multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) were acquired during the GAP cruise using 

one GI gun of 1.7 l and a 100 m active length streamer with 16 channels.  

During the TTR15-leg 4 multichannel seismic profiles were acquired using the 

Bremen University multichannel seismic system, designed to acquire high resolution 

seismic data.  

The main seismic source for the survey was a Sodera GI-Gun, in true GI-Mode with 

2x1.7 l chamber volume. The trigger interval was 12 to 16 seconds, resulting on an average 

shot point spacing ranging from 31 to 41 m at 5 knots ship speed (when operating in 

parallel to the OKEAN) and 12 to 16 m at 2 knots ship speed (when operating in parallel to 

MAK). The gun was shot at a mean pressure of 120-150 bar. 

The multichannel seismic streamer was towed with 3 MultiTrak Remote Units 

(MTCBirds) attached, used to keep the streamer in 3 m depth. The streamer included a 



 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations 

 

 A-10 

lead-in and 2 active sections of 50 m length each. A 30 m long deck cable connected the 

streamer to the recording system. The 2 active sections (SYNTRON) were each 

subdivided, giving 8 hydrophone groups in total. Each of the 6.25 m long hydrophone 

groups is again subdivided into 5 subgroups of different length. One of the subgroups was 

a high-resolution hydrophone with pre-amplifier. A programming module distributes the 

subgroups of 4 hydrophone groups, i.e. a total of 20 groups to 5 channels. To adapt the 

system to the water depth, deep water programming modules (instead of module 1, which 

could not be removed) were selected, so that every second 6.25 m hydrophone group was 

completely used with all 13 hydrophones. 

The data acquisition system, developed at the working group marine 

technology/environmental research at the University of Bremen consists of a Pentium IV 

based PC (3 GHz, 1GB RAM, Windows XP) with two NI6052E 16bit AD-converters. 

Each ADC was connected to a 32 channel multiplexer (NI-SCXI1102-C) with onboard 

preamplification and anti-alias filter. The system therefore provides a maximum of 64 

channels at maximum sampling rate of 10 kHz per channel. The acquisition software was 

also a custom development and provides nearly continuous recording of the 64 channels 

with data storage in demultiplexed SEG-Y to hard disk. The software, allows online 

quality control by displaying shot gathers and an online profile plot using brute channel 

stacks of arbitrary channels. Data were recorded at 4 kHz over lengths of 4 - 6 seconds 

depending on water depth with a delay of 0 s, resulting in 16000 – 24000 samples per 

trace. 

On-board post-processing of the data was carried out with the Seismic processing 

software Vista 5.1. The main target of the processing was to enhance the signal to noise 

ratio. The following processing flow was routinely applied to the data. First, a wide 

bandpass filter of 5-800 Hz was used to allow trace editing. After removing bad traces, an 

f-k filter was applied. The filter design consists in the k-domain of two outside end 

rejections zones, which depends on the noise character of the data. In the frequency 

domain a rejection above 200 Hz was chosen. As a next step, spherical divergence was 

corrected, followed by a common-shot stack. For some profiles with obvious difraction 

hyperbolae, an f-k migration was used with estimated shot spacing and a constant velocity 

model. After processing, the data were printed and exported as SEG-Y.

A.5 Side-scan Sonar 

A.5.1 NRL Seamap sede-scan sonar mosaic 

During the NRL KANE cruise, low frequency 12 KHz side-scan sonar data was 

collected using the Seamap system, which was developed and built by the Hawaii Mapping 

Research Group and operated by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO). 

A.5.2 OKEAN 

The OKEAN long range side-scan sonar (Figure A.3A) operates at a frequency of 9.5 

kHz was used in all the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz as a first reconnaissance 

surveying equipment. Its resolution is equivalent to the backscatter imagery of the EM12 

swath bathymetry system and also similar to the NRL Seabeam side-scan sonar system. 

The OKEAN fish is towed 40 to 80 m behind the ship at a few meters depth bellow the sea 

surface, at a vessel speed of about 6 knots. The swath depends on the water depth, but in 

the surveyed areas, were in general either 7 or 15 km. 

The data was digitally recorded onboard, filtered and processed by the acoustic 

scientific teams and the imagery was than georeferenced and integrated into the ArcGIS 

database.  

A.5.3 OREtech 

The OREtech deep-towed side-scan sonar fish (Figure A.3B) was towed over 

selected seabed features at a near constant altitude of 130 m or at about 40-45 m above the 

seafloor, depending of the mode of operation at 30 or 100 kHz respectively. The fish is 

also equipped with a 6 kHz subbottom echosounder. The swath coverage was of 2 km or 

500 m wide depending on the operation frequency of 30 or 100 kHz, respectively. The data 

was digitally recorded onboard, filtered, processed and georeferenced using the underwater 

navigation acquired during the operations by the acoustic scientific teams. The imagery 

was than integrated into the ArcGIS database. 

During the TTR09 and TTR10 a total of 34 km of survey lines with OREtech were 

acquired in the Gulf of Cadiz.

A.5.4 MAK-1M 

The MAK-1M is a high resolution deep-towed side-scan sonar system used on board 

the R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz since 2001. The 

MAK-1M fish is also equipped with a subbottom profiler, operating at a frequency of 5 

kHz. The maximum swat coverage is 2 km (1 km per side) for a towing altitude of 150 m 

above the seafloor and operating at a frequency of 30 kHz. The resolution of the system 

rages from 7 to 1 m across and along the track. The resolution is maximum near the nadir. 

During the TTR11 to the TTR16 the fish was towed at a nearly constant altitude of about 

100-150 m above the seafloor at a speed of 1.5-2 knots for 30 kHz surveys and at about 50 

m above the seafloor for 100 kHz surveys. 

The data was onboard recorded digitally and processed by the acoustic scientific 

team. Time variant gain was applied to the data during acquisition. Onboard processing of 

the data included slant-range-to-ground-range (SLT) correction, geometric correction of 

the profiles for recovery of the real seafloor topography and smoothing average filtering of 

sonar and profiler record. The sonar individual lines were geometrically corrected for the 

towing speed of the fish and converted into a standard bitmap image format. Some image 

processing routines, such as histogram equalization and curve adjustment were used to 

improve the dynamic range of the imagery. Geographic georeferentiation of the obtained 

imagery was performed according to the positioning of the tow-fish underwater navigation 

acquired during the operation. The georeferenced imagery was then integrated into the 

ArcGIS database. 

During the TTR cruises a total of 578 km of MAK-1M deep-towed side-scan sonar 

lines were acquired. 

 

A.6 Sub-bottom profiler 

A.6.1 TTR hull-mounted acoustic profiler 

During the TTR cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz a hull-mounted 3.5 kHz profiler was 

routinely used in most of the operations, with continuous paper output and digital record of 

selected portions of the data. 



 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations 

 

 A-14 

A.6.2 Parametric parasound 

The parametric parasound system works also as a low-frequency sediment 

echosounder and was routinely recorded during most of the GAP cruise. The system uses 

the parametric effect, which produces additional frequencies through non-linear acoustic 

interaction of finite amplitude waves. The system emits simultaneously two sound waves 

of similar frequencies (18 and 22 kHz); as a result, a signal of the difference frequency (4 

kHz) is generated. The footprint size of this signal is much smaller than in the conventional 

systems and both vertical and lateral resolution are significantly improved. The recorded 

signal is recorded in the native Paradigma format. 

 

A.7 Heat flow measurements 

Heat flow measurements were acquired during the GAP and during the Anastasya-

2001 cruises. During the GAP cruise, a Lister type with a violin bow design heat flow 

probe was used. The heat flow probe from the University of Bremen was used to obtain 

temperature gradients and in situ thermal conductivities by a pulsed heat source method. 

The operations consisted on several probe penetrations at small distances (usually 300 m 

on top of mud volcanoes and 1000 to 2000 m apart for regional heat flow studies) along a 

profile. Each penetration consisted of raising the probe about one hundred meters above 

the sea floor from the previous penetration, slowly moving the ship to the next penetration 

site and dropping the probe into the sediment for the next penetration. Once the probe is in 

the sediment, it is left undisturbed for 7 minutes for equilibrium temperature measurements 

(time needed to allow the extrapolation to the equilibrium temperature after the frictional 

disturbance of the penetration) and another 7 minutes, if a thermal conductivity 

measurement is made. 

Miniaturised autonomous temperature data loggers were used to obtain thermal 

gradient at selected gravity corer stations. The miniaturised temperature loggers were 

attached to the gravity corer at 1.1 m intervals and measured the sediment temperature.

A.8 Underwater video observations 

During the TTR cruises a deep-towed underwater video system was used for seabed 

observations. The system consists of an onboard and an underwater unit. The onboard unit 

consists of a control, a recording and an amplifier unit. Signal and power transmission is 

done through the traction coaxial cable. The underwater unit (Figure A.5A) is composed of 

a frame with the light unit, a high-pressure housing containing an analogical and a digital 

camera, and a power supply unit. 

Visualization and recording of the seafloor observations is done in real time. The 

control of the distance of the camera to the seafloor is done by the winch operator in order 

to maintain a constant distance of 1.5 to 2 m. The distance of the camera to the seafloor is 

evaluated with a 1.5 m long cable with a weight that is observed in most of the seafloor 

pictures. 

The underwater video unit is also equipped with an echo sounder and pinger that 

were used for underwater navigation. Therefore, the underwater video system, similarly to 



 

Appendix A. Geophysical data acquisition and processing, Sample collection and Underwater observations 

 

 A-16 

the deep-towed side-scan sonar systems (OREtech and MAK), is acquired with underwater 

navigation control. 

During the GAP cruise, on board the R/V Sonne, underwater video observations 

were performed using the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS). The OFOS (Figure 

A.5B) is equipped with two video cameras (colour and black and white) a still camera, a 

light system, a CTD, a compass, pitch and roll sensors, and a pinger that is used to 

calculate the OFOS underwater navigation. The video streams are transmitted in real time 

to the on-board command and display unit where they are analogical recorded, digitized 

and recorded. Ship navigation and underwater navigation of the OFOS is recorded in the 

logging system of the ship. The OFOS is towed at a distance of about 1.5 m above the 

seafloor and is manually adjusted by the winch operator. To assist on keeping a constant 

distance to the seafloor a weight on a 2 m long cable is attached to the bottom of the OFOS 

frame. Three laser pointers are used to scale the video images. The two outside laser points 

are parallel and 20 cm apart, and the laser in between the two is pointing at an oblique 

angle, to provide an estimate of the absolute distance to the seafloor.

mounted in the frame the light system and the high-pressure housing containing the power supply. (B) OFOS 

system used during the GAP cruise. 

 

A.9 Gravity cores 

Gravity cores were retrieved during the TTR cruises with a 6 m long gravity corer, 

deployed with a 1500 kg weight. An internal plastic liner with 14.7 cm in diameter is 

housed in the gravity corer. 



 

Authigenic Carbonates and Fluid Escape Structures in the Gulf of Cadiz 

 A-17

After the gravity core is on deck and the removal of the core catcher, the internal 

plastic liner containing the sediment core is taken out and the sediment material is 

immediately retrieved with a piston extruder. The core sediment is segmented in sections 

of 60 to 70 cm long, immediately longitudinally opened in two identical sections and 

examined for occurrences of gas hydrates or intense degassing. Gas hydrates, if present, 

are removed and stored in cold containers. 

One half of the open core is labelled, photographed and described on deck. 

Lithological logs with indication of lithology, colours and sedimentary structures along the 

core are constructed by the sedimentology teams. Core logs are shown throughout this 

thesis and all core logs are compiled in the respective cruise reports. The reported colours 

correspond to the Munsel Colour Charts. Magnetic susceptibility was routinely measured 

with a Bartington Instruments MS2E1 probe. The magnetic susceptibility reflects the 

presence of magnetic material and is strongly influenced by the grain size, heavy minerals 

content and is inversely related to the carbonate content and diagenetic ferric mineral 

reduction. The magnetic susceptibility is also a function of temperature and negative 

temperature anomalies associated with the destabilization of gas hydrates are easily 

detected on the magnetic susceptibility record. 

The other half of the core is then available for sediment sampling. Samples for gas 

geochemistry, pore water samples, micropaleontological sub-samples and coccolith smear 

slides are routinely taken. 

During the GAP cruise, gravity cores were collected with a 12 m long gravity corer 

of 12 cm in diameter. The gravity core liners after retrievement on board were splited in 

1.5 m long sections and immediately scanned on a MST core logger. The MST measured 

properties were: wet bulk density, P-wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility and natural 

gamma radiation. After the MST measurements, the core liner was splited and the core 

longitudinally divided in two. One half was photographed, described and stored for 

archive. The other half was sub-sampled.

A.10 TV controlled grabs 

Onboard the R/V Professor Logachev two different TV-controlled grabs were used. 

The DG-1 Grab system, illustrated in Figure A.6C, consists on a 1500 kg system operating 

up to 6000 m water depth with a maximum interior volume of 0.4 m3. The GTVD-2 is an 

orange peel grab Figure A.6D that operates up to 6000 m water depth, has 3.2 tons and an 

interior volume of 1.1 m3. Both systems have a video camera fitted, and power and light 

units, allowing real time visualization of the seafloor during the grab operation. The 

onboard unit allows the visualization and record of the video images for selection of the 

sampling site. Underwater positioning and navigation of the TV-grab is registered by the 

underwater navigation system. During the GAP cruise a tv-controled grab (Figure A.6E) 

was also used to select and collect large volumes of surface sediments from the seafloor.  

 

A.11 Box-cores 

Box cores were collected using a Reineck square box with 50x50x50 cm (Figure 

A.6F). Box cores were collected when samples of undisturbed seabed were needed. After 

retrievement, the box core was opened removing a side panel, the surface and side were 

photographed, described and sub-samples were then collected. 

 

A.12 Kasten box-cores 

The Kasten corer was used on board the R/V Professor Logachev during the TTR14, 

TTR15 and TTR16 cruises in the Gulf of Cadiz (Figure A.6G). It was used when large 

amount and deeper (&gt; 0.5 m) sediment material was needed or due to inefficiency of the 

other sampling equipments, in general due to the presence of large pebbles or carbonate 

crusts at the seabed. It consists on a square section corer with dimensions of 

0.39x0.39x180 m. 

After retrieving the kasten corer, it was opened through removing a side panel, the 

surface and side were photographed and described, and sub-samples were then collected.

A.13 Dredges 

The dredges used during the TTR cruises consist of a circular steel gate of 1 m2 

section (Figure A.6H) and a rectangular section (50x100 cm) dredge (Figure A.6I), both 

with chain meshes that were trailed behind a 0.5 ton weight, 3 m in front of the dredge 

gate. The mesh size was about 5 cm. The dredge was trailed up-slope at about 0.5 knots on 

sites previously monitored with the 3.5 kHz hull-mounted echosounder, high resolution 

side-scan sonar or underwater TV observations. The dredge was used to collect hard rock 

material such as most of the authigenic carbonate samples. After sample retrieved the 

samples where photographed, washed and described onboard. In Figure A.6J is illustrated 

the dredge used during the Anastasia cruises onboard the RV Cornide de Saavedra.

Appendix B. Analytical results 

 

 

A large number of analytical methodologies and techniques were used on the work 

developed for this thesis. The several analytical methods and their results are described and 

reported in the several chapters of the thesis. In this Appendix are reported the analytical 

results tables that due to their size are not suitable to be presented within the text. 

In this Appendix are tabled the results of the carbonate mineralogy, as defined from 

the X-ray diffraction and corrected with the total organic carbon and the total carbonate 

content measured with the LECO CHNS-932 elemental analyser (description of this 

method is given in Chapter 5). Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes are also reported in this 

appendix (description of this method is given in Chapter 5). The results are presented 

grouped according to the different lythological types of MDAC as defined and described in 

Chapter 5.

Appendix C. EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-

calcite from dolomite for stable isotope measurements 

 

 

C.1 Introduction 

 

Methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) collected from the Gulf of Cadiz 

consists of complex mixtures of aragonite, calcite, high Mg-calcite, protodolomite and 

dolomite phases (Chapter 5). A selective separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals is 

required for accurate phase-specific determination of oxygen and carbon isotope 

composition of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates. As the studied samples are 

characterized by mineralogies that range in size from micrite to microsparite (Chapter 5), a 

physical separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals is difficult and in general not 

possible to be applied, making the chemical separation as the more adequate method. 

Chemical separation techniques based on time-dependent extraction of CO2 by 

reaction of the carbonate minerals at 25ºC with 100% phosphoric acid is widely used to 

achieve carbonate phase-specific carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (Alaasm et al., 1990). 

But this method is difficult to use in complex carbonate mixtures of high Mg-calcite and 

dolomite. 

Other method to obtain phase-specific carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions is 

based of the equation C.1, where ?total and ?dolomite are measured and ?calcite can be 

calculated using the fraction of dolomite in the bulk material (X) as measured from XRD. 

( ) calcitedolomitetotal XX ??? ×?+×= 1    (C.1) 
This approach is used with success for the separation of calcite from dolomite. The 

pure dolomite fraction can be obtained from dolomite-calcite mixtures by leaching with 

5% acetic acid solution. The time dependent CO2 extraction and the acetic acid dissolution 

of calcite and aragonite leaving the dolomite phase solute provides reasonable results on 

the isotopic calculation of the coexisting calcium carbonates (McKenzie, 1976). However,

measurements 

 C-2

these methods are also not successful in separating coexisting high Mg-calcite, 

protodolomite and dolomite, as the MDAC from the Gulf of Cadiz. 

The organic acid ethylenedinitrilotetraceticacid (EDTA) is known to be an 

alternative to dissolve calcite, based on the fact that calcite is more water soluble than 

dolomite and thus forms stronger complexes with EDTA (Glover, 1961; Bodine and 

Fernalld, 1973). EDTA present the following order of effectiveness as a solvent: calcite &gt; 

high Mg-calcite &gt; dolomite &gt; magnesite (Bodine and Fernalld, 1973). 

In this appendix, is described the use of the EDTA and the leaching thechnique to 

separate calcite and Mg-calcite from dolomite in selected samples of MDAC. This method 

developed at the ETH, Zurich (Van Lith, 2001) proved to be efficient, allowing the 

separation of dolomite from complex mixtures of calcite, high Mg-calcite and dolomite, by 

slow dissolution of the calcite and high Mg-calcite fraction in a boiling 0.25 M of 

ethylenedinitrilotetraceticacid (EDTA) solution with pH 11. The carbon and oxygen 

isotopic composition of the bulk carbonate and of the dolomite fraction were analyzed and 

the isotopic composition of calcite phase could then be calculated. 

 

 

C.2 Methods 

 

The samples used in this study were selected from the collection of MDAC retrieved 

from the Gulf of Cadiz (Chapter 5). Samples for XRD, carbon and oxygen stable isotope 

were extracted from transversal and longitudinal cuts and micro-drilled along radial and 

longitudinal profiles of two selected dolomite chimneys. 

Bulk mineralogy and the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies in 

each sample were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 134 powdered samples 

(Table 5.1 in Chapter 5). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Scintag 

XDS2000 X-ray diffractometer with CuK? radiation (1.5405 Å wavelength) at the 

Geological Institute of the ETH Zurich. Scans were done from 5º to 60º 2? at 0.02º/sec, 

using 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As the intensity of the diffraction 

pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its concentration, estimates of the 

relative proportions of the minerals in a sample were made by measuring their relative

peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative abundance estimation were performed 

using the Scintag interpretation software and the MacDiff® software packages. Error 

associated with the mineralogy content determination is estimated to be 7%. The Mg:Ca 

ratio of the carbonate minerals was calculated from the shift of the d-spacing of the (104) 

reflection peak of calcite and dolomite from the stechoimetric peaks positions in the 

diffraction spectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; Lumsden, 1979). 

( )99.91133.333100% 1043 ?×?= dMgCOmole   (C.2) 
The peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the carbonate minerals: calcite 

(&amp;lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 Å), high Mg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 3.012 to 

2.946 Å), protodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 Å) and 

dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 to 2.871 Å). 

Carbon and oxygen isotopes in powdered bulk samples and in EDTA leaching 

residue were analysed at the Geological Institute of the ETH Zurich. Samples for carbon 

and oxygen stable isotopic analyses were prepared by reacting at 90°C with 100% 

phosphoric acid on an automated carbonate device connected to a VG-PRISM mass 

spectrometer calibrated with NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results are reported in the 

conventional ? ‰-notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite). Analytical 

reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards is better than ±0.1‰ for both 

carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite samples, dolomite ?18O 

values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63‰, consequence of the unequal 

oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 (Rosenbaum and Sheppard, 1986).  

After retrieve the powdered samples by micro-drill, each sample was spitted in two 

fractions. One sub-sample was used for XRD analysis and for carbon and oxygen isotope 

analyse of the bulk carbonate. The second sub-sample was leached with 20 ml boiling 0.25 

M EDTA solution at pH 11 during 24 hours in glass covered containers to avoid 

evaporation. The solvent level was maintained at 20 ml/g by adding distilled water. After 

24 hours the sub-sample was taken out of the EDTA solution, washed in distilled water, 

freeze dried, examined with XRD and measured for carbon and oxygen isotopic 

composition.

C.3 Results and Discussion 

C.3.1 XRD results 

The high Mg content in the calcite (&amp;lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 26.50 to 29.63 2? degrees), 

Mg-calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 29.63 to 30.31 degrees), and the Ca-content in the 

protodolomite or Ca-dolomite (30 to 40 mol% MgCO3, 30.31 to 30.63 degrees) and in the 

dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 30.63 to 31.12 degrees) phases of the MDAC from the 

Gulf of Cadiz caused significant shifts of the respective 2? peaks in the X-ray 

diffractogram relative to the standard 2? peaks of pure calcite, Mg-calcite, protodolomite 

and stoichiometric dolomite (Figure C.1 to Figure C.7). 

EDTA leaching method proved to be efficient as a dissolving calcite and Mg-calcite 

leaving dolomite intact when the bulk dolomite:(calcite + Mg-calcite) is high. The 0.25 M 

EDTA solution allowed the leaching of a mixture of 74:26 dolomite:(high Mg-calcite + 

calcite) to a 100:0 (wt%:wt%) mixture in 24 hours (Figure C.3). Sample 3463-B02.24, 

with a original dolomite:(high Mg-calcite + calcite) ration of 43:57 was not able to 

completely dissolve the calcite + Mg-calcite mixture and lead to a residue with 54:46 ratio 

(Figure C.5). Similar experiments (Van Lith, 2001) have demonstrated that when the start 

material contained more than 60% high Mg-calcite, the difference in solubility is not 

sufficient to significantly enrichment of the sample in dolomite. In these situations a longer 

reaction time have to be used. In conclusion mixtures with high amounts of dolomite (such 

as samples: 3463-A03.08, 3463-A03.09, 3463-A03.95, 3463-A03.10, 3463-B02.25, 3463-

B02.26) resulted in a good dissolution of calcite and Mg-calcite and a complete 

purification of the dolomite carbonate phase (Table C.2). 

Due to a more controlled and slower dissolution reaction rate, the EDTA is a good 

alternative to the weak acid method to separate carbonate minerals for accurate phase-

specific isotope measurements.

C.3.2 Carbon and Oxygen Isotopic analysis 

Carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the purified dolomite fraction after 

EDTA leaching shows a significant different stable isotopic values from the bulk material 

(Figure C.8). The dolomite fraction have consistently lighter carbon isotopic values and 

heavier oxygen isotopic values. This difference between the different carbonate phases, 

can reach 25% for the original ?13C bulk sample value and up to 27% of the original ?18O 

bulk sample value. This puts in evidence the relevance of separating the coexistent 

carbonate mineralogies for accurate temperature calculations and to evaluate the fluid 

compositions and the potential influence of heavy water from decomposition of gas 

hydrates, as discussed in Chapter 6. 

The ?18O isotopic composition of pure dolomite fraction shows an average value of 

+5.69‰ ± 0.28 (PDB) while the mixture of the different carbonates presents lower values. 

This is evident in the ?18O isotopic values function of the dolomite/(calcite + Mg-calcite) 

ratios in Figure C.9. The extrapolation of the regression line to a pure calcite composition 

indicates a oxygen isotopic value of 1.4‰ (PDB). The application of equation C.1 to the 

estimation of the isotopic values of the pure mixture of calcite and high Mg-calcite is 

shown in Table C.2. The estimated ?18O isotopic composition of calcite+high Mg-calcite

(to be noted that there is a clear higher abundance of calcite in this mixture), is ranging 

from -0.14 to +1.92‰, corresponding to isotopic values close to 0‰ i.e. values close to 

normal seawater composition. Indicating the precipitation from close to normal seawater 

fluids. So, most probably, the calcite phase (to be noted that there is a clear higher 

abundance of calcite in relation to Mg-calcite) correspond to pelagic calcite material from 

foraminifera and other calcite tests precipitated from normal seawater.

Figure C.9. Group of samples treated with EDTA leaching reveal linear correlation between the 
dolomite/(calcite + Mg-calcite) ratio and the ?18O values. Pure dolomite yields 5.6‰ ?18O PDB, whereas 18O 
is strongly depleted in the calcite and Mg-calcite phases. There is no clear relationship between the 
mineralogy and ?13C values. 

 

This trend is not so evident for all the dolomite chimneys crusts and nodules samples 

(Figure C.10). Although the ?18O isotopic composition of the enriched dolomite samples 

clear present heavier isotopic values than the samples more enriched in calcite. These is 

interpreted as an indication of precipitation of dolomite from fluids that are different from 

the normal seawater composition from which calcite is dominantly precipitated from. 

These oxygen isotopic difference between dolomite and calcite+high Mg-calcite reveal 

different fluid composition of the fluids from which the different carbonates had 

precipitate. These differences are discussed in detail in chapter 5. 

The ?13C isotopic composition of dolomite show consistently lighter values than the 

carbonate bulk mixture. The leached samples shown and fairly constant depletion in ?13C 

of -5.76‰ ± 2.15‰ (PDB) i.e. similar rate of ?13C variation function of the dolomite 

content. But a global variation on the carbon isotopic composition as function of the 

dolomite content (Figure C.9) is not observed on the EDTA leached samples. But such a 

trend is clearly evident for all the dolomite chimneys crusts and nodules samples (Figure 

C.11). There is a clear evidence of more depleted carbon values for dolomite dominated 

samples with an average value of -39‰ ± 10‰ (PDB) for the extrapolated pure dolomite

Figure C.11. Dolomite crusts, chimneys and Nodules reveal linear correlation between the dolomite/(calcite

enriched in the calcite and Mg-calcite phases. 

 



 

Appendix C. EDTA Differentiation of calcite and high Mg-calcite from dolomite for stable isotope

 C-12

The extrapolations of the ?13C values for pure dolomite and pure calcite phases, 

based on the ?13C values of bulk and leached material (Figure C.12) indicate ?13C 

compositions ranging from -57‰ to -28‰ (PDB) for pure dolomite phase. For the calcite 

and Mg-calcite phases 13C is strongly enriched with the extrapolated values ranging from -

2 to -23‰ (PDB). Comparing these values with the function obtained by the linear fit for 

all bulk samples from Figure C.11 the end-members isotopic compositions (-38‰ ± 10‰ 

(PDB) for pure dolomite and -18‰ (PDB) for a pure calcite + high Mg-calcite mixture) is 

within these values. The calculated 13C composition for the end-member calcite (Table 

C.2) presents an average value of -9.83‰ ± 6.17‰ (PDB). 

In conclusion both EDTA and bulk samples clear indicate a closer to the normal 

seawater isotopic composition, as also seen on the oxygen isotopes, for the calcite and a 

lighter isotopic composition for dolomite. This is interpreted as different carbon isotopic 

composition of the original fluids for the different samples. These differences are discussed 

in detail in chapter 6, but most probably is resulting from a mixture, with variable 

proportions of the carbon sources (biogenic, thermogenic and seawater carbon pools).

C.4 Conclusions 

 

In summary, EDTA leaching technique was used to differentiate between coexisting 

calcite Mg-calcite and dolomite in a controlled and simple technique. Using a 0.25 M 

EDTA solution, a mixture of 74:26 dolomite:calcite+high Mg-calcite was altered to a 

100:00 (wt%:wt%) mixture in 24 hours. Due to a more controlled and slower dissolution 

reaction rate, the EDTA is a good alternative to the weak acid method to separate 

carbonate minerals for accurate phase-specific isotope measurements. 

The selective separation of the coexisting carbonate minerals allowed the 

identification of different carbon and oxygen isotopic values of the different mineral 

phases. Pure dolomite shows on average ?18O isotopic composition of +5.69‰ ± 0.29 

(PDB). On average, pure dolomite shows an constant depletion in ?13C of -5.49‰ ± 2.08‰ 

(PDB) in relation to the bulk carbonate. Extrapolated ?18O isotopic composition of pure 

calcite or a mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite (no dolomite) indicate a calculated value 

of +0.93‰ ± 0.67 (PDB). The extrapolation from the linear best fit of the plot of the ?18O 

isotopic composition as function of dolomite proportion indicates to a estimated 

composition for pure calcite phase or to the mixture of calcite + high Mg-calcite of 1.4‰ 

(PDB). So, all the indications point to near seawater composition of the calcite phase and a 

positive ?18O isotopic composition of the dolomite. The extrapolated ?13C for a pure calcite 

+ high Mg-calcite mixture indicate a value of -18‰ (PDB). 

These differences in isotopic composition of the different mineral phases reveal 

different fluid composition of the fluids from which the carbonates had precipitated from 

and are discussed in chapter 6.

Appendix D.  Biomarkers: samples preparation and 

analysis 

 

 

D.1 Introduction 

In this Appendix is described the sample preparation and analytical procedure for 

biomarker analysis. The lipid biomarkers analyses were carried out by the author in the 

Marine Biogeochemistry Laboratory of the Research Center for Ocean Margins (RCOM), 

of the Bremen University (Magalhães et al., 2005) in collaboration with Prof. Jorn 

Peckmann and Dr Daniel Birgel of the RCOM. 

The samples selected for biomarker analysis were chosen based on previous 

petrographic and mineralogical descriptions in order to analyse samples representative of 

the different types of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC) identified in the 

Gulf of Cadiz. As the oxidation processes is effective in reducing the preservation of the 

organic compounds present in the carbonate, the selected samples were the ones that 

showed lower oxidation degree and the most massive and un-alterated characteristics. In 

Table D.1 are listed the samples selected for biomarker analysis at the RCOM centre. 

The aragonite pavements are considered to represent a more recent carbonate than 

the dolomite chimneys and previous studies (Duarte, 2005; Niemann et al., 2005; Niemann 

et al., 2006) have already shown that the biomarker indicators are abundant in this type of 

samples. The aragonite pavement sample 3340 (Figure 8.2) was selected because it shows 

no signs of oxidation. From this aragonite pavement sample, 20 g of material was collected 

and prepared for biomarker extraction. From the dolomite chimney samples 3463-A08 and 

3722-A33 (Figure 8.2), 250 g of material was collected and prepared for biomarker 

extraction by fragmenting to small 5 cm thick slices, avoiding the periphery and fractured 

parts of the samples that can act as contamination sources. 

These results were complemented with lipid biomarker analyses performed at the 

Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology Bremen by L. Santos and H. Niemann

(Santos et al., 2006) and the results are presented in Chapter 8. 

The analytical procedure described in this Appendix is similar to the analytical 

procedure of the samples analysed at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology 

Bremen.

D.1 Sample preparation 

The sample preparation procedure used for extraction and purification of the lipid 

biomarkers was based on the method of Peckmann et al. (2004). The analytical 

methodology used for the dolomite chimney samples is described by the flowchart in 

Figure D.2 and for the aragonite pavements the analytical methodology used is described 

in the flowchart of Figure D.1. 

The freshly broken carbonate samples were decalcified (HCl) and the dried residue 

was refluxed in 6% KOH in CH3OH (saponification reaction: 2 h). The supernatant was 

decanted and the residue was repeatedly extracted by ultrasonication in CH2Cl2/CH3OH 

(3:1; v:v) until the solvent became colourless. Subsequently, the combined supernatants 

were portioned in CH2Cl2 versus water (pH 2). The resulting total extract was dried and 

separated by column chromatography (Merck silica gel 60, 0.063-0.200 mm; i.d.: 15 mm, 

length: 35 mm) into fractions containing: (1) hydrocarbons (20 ml or 3 column volumes of 

n-hexane); (2) esters/ketones (20 ml of n-hexane/CH2Cl2 2:1); (3) alcohol (20 ml of 

CH2Cl2/aceton 9:1; (4) fatty acids/polars (20 ml of MeOH). The esters/ketones and alcohol 

fractions were dried and derivatised using pyridine and BSTFA (2:1) at 70ºC (1 h). The 

polar fractions/fatty acids were dried and transesterificated with boron-trifluoride methanol 

and then with KCl + hexane. The internal standard used for all fractions was Cholestane. A 

modification of the method by doing a previous extraction with CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1; v:v) 

prior to decalcification proved to be efficient in cleaning dirt peaks on the dolomite

samples. Above are described the analytical sequence procedure used. 

 

D.2 Decalcification 

The first step in this process is the dissolution (decalcification) of the carbonate 

fraction, using the following procedure: 

1. The carbonate piece of the sample to analyse is first crushed into small chips. In 

the case of the hard dolomitic chimneys, the sample was cut into smaller slices and 

crushed with a silicic acid mortar and pestle;  

2. The beaker where the sample was placed for reaction was cleaned with DCM1 

(CH2Cl2) by washing the beaker twice, not forgetting also to wash the edges of the 

recipient. 

3. The small chips of the sample were cleaned 2 or 3 times with acetone to prevent 

and eliminate any possible contamination during the handling of the sample by dust 

or any other contaminant. 

4. Cleaning the separatory funnel with Millipore water and DCM 3 times, having 

special attention on cleaning the lead and the stopper of the funnel. Filling the 

funnel with HCl 10% vol. and placing it to decant over the beaker with the sample 

covered with Millipore water. 

5. The decalcification reaction is started by adding water and then adding the acid 

(HCl 10% vol.) onto the sample, drop by drop, shaking with a magnum. Once the 

reaction diminishes more acid is added, controlling the pH of the solution so that it 

will not be more acid than 2. The reaction needs to be kept until a sufficient amount 

of sample is dissolved. The control of the reaction is done by “eye control”; once 

the bubbling of the acid stops or diminishes more acid is added to the solution. 

6. Centrifuging the sample: once the reaction is kept for sufficient time and enough 

material is dissolved, the solution is centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm. The 

supernatant is discarded and the residue is dried overnight on the oven at 50ºC. 

 

                                                           
1 DCM - DiCloroMethane  (CH2Cl2) is used as a solvent of organic matter so it can be used to clean the glass 

material. DCM is also be used to clean the samples thenselves.

 D-4

D.3 Saponification 

Saponification was done with 6% KOH in MeOH, through the addition of 30 ml of 

KOH in MeOH 6% to the sample (solid phase), a closed vial, and by letting it to react for 2 

hours in ultrasonic bath at 40ºC. After the saponification reaction, the supernatant was 

collected in a centrifuge tube. 

 

D.4 Extraction 

1. Three times with DCM:MeOH (3:1): 

i. after saponification the material was moved to the centrifuge tubes. 

ii. addition of 30 ml of DCM:MeOH (3:1) 

iii. placing the tube in the ultrasonic cleaner bath for 15 minutes 

iv. centrifuging for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm (the weight of the centrifuge tubes is 

balanced with DCM:MeOH (3:1) 

v. placing the solution on a separatory funnel, previously cleaned with DCM (2x) 

vi. repeating of steps ii to v, 3 times. 

2. Extraction of organic phases vs. Water (pH2): 

i. addition of 30 ml of DCM 

ii. addition of water in the same volume of the volume of DCM:MeOH (3:1) used 

for the 3 steps of 1.i to 1.vi (c.a. 40 ml H2O) 

iii. addition of HCl 10%vol. (4-5 drops) to obtain a solution with pH=2 

iv. shaking. 

3. Drying with Na2SO4 

i. cleaning a funnel and 1 evaporation tube with DCM (2x) 

ii. placing combusted glass wool on the gorge of the funnel and about 5 spoons of 

Na2SO4 on top of the glass wool 

iii. placing the solution on the separatory funnel (steps 1 and 2) 

iv. shaking the separatory funnel with the solution and the DCM and let the DCM 

drop slowly on the column funnel, so that the solution drops down 

homogeneously over the salt, avoiding the perforation of the Na2SO4. Once all 

the DCM is drained, the salt is washed with 10 ml DCM to guarantee that all the 

solution with organic compounds is washed to the evaporation tube and none is

retained in the Na2SO4 or in the glass wool. 

v. Evaporation of the DCM with N2 gas flux. The evaporator uses evaporation 

tubes with 1 ml bottom “nipple-tube”. Settings of the N2 evaporator were: (1) 

pressure = 1.8 Psi or 1.2 bar; (2) Mode: automatic sensor; (3) bath temperature: 

37ºC. 

vi. Activation of the respective cell number that contains the sample.

D.5 Column chromatography 

 

1. Preparation of 4 (5 ml) vials to collect the 4 different fractions: Hydrocarbons, 

Esters, Alcohols and Faty Acids. 

2. Cleaning of the column: 

i. Filling the column with DCM and let the solvent flow through the column. 

ii. Filling the column with Hexane and let the solvent flow through the column. 

Repeating this operation 3 times. 

3. Placing 1 ml of the sample solution (attention not to allow the column to dry 

out). The ceramic of the column has to be always wet with the different solvents. 

4. filling with 20 ml of Hexane and collection of the first fraction: hydrocarbons. 

5. filling with 20 ml of Hexane/DCM 2:1 and collection of the first fraction: 

ketones/esters. 

6. filling with 20 ml of DCM/Aceton 9:1 and collection of the first fraction: 

alcohols. 

7. filling with 20 ml of MeOH and collection of the first fraction: fat acids, polars. 

 

After the column chromatography, the solutions are dried on a N2 flux evaporator 

(using the one for small vials). The vial with the hydrocarbons fraction should not be 

totally dried out and a little amount of solvent has to be preserved. Vials fractions of esters, 

alcohols and FA can be totally dried out. 

With a pipette, the solutions are transferred to the small vials that will be used on the 

automatic auto sampler of the chromatograph. 

The solution is dried and once it is totally dried the standards and solvents are added. 

Fraction F1: addition of the solvent and the internal standard. Fractions F2 and F3 have to 

be derivatised. F4 has to be Transesterificated.  

 

F1 - Hydrocarbons 

i. addition of 150 µl of solvent: Hexane + 50 µl of Internal Standard: Cholestane. 

ii. analysis on the GC-MS and/or storing the vials in a -30ºC refrigerator.

D.5 Gas chromatography and coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 

 

The hydrocarbon fraction was examined by combined gas chromatography-mass 

spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Varian CP-3800 GC/Saturn 2000 MS EI-mode, 70eV) 

equipped with a 30 m fused silica capillary column (CP-Sil 8 CB Low Bleed, 0.25mm ID, 

0.25 µm film thickness). The carrier gas was He. The GC-temperature program used was: 

injection at 80ºC, 5 min isothermal; from 80ºC to 310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 20 min isothermal. 

The identification of the organic compounds was based on comparison of the mass spectra 

and the GC retention times with those of published data and reference compounds. 

Coupled GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) was conducted using a 

Finnigan DeltaPlusXL mass spectrometer equipped with a HP6890GC and CuO/Ni/Pt 

combustion furnace operated at 940ºC. Samples were injected splitless (1 min) onto a 30 m 

fused silica column (DB5-MS, 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) using a Gerstel 

Cooled Injection System (CIS4) programmed from 48ºC (0 min) to 310ºC (10 min) at 12ºC 

sec-1. The carrier gas was He. The GC temperature program used was: 3 min at 80ºC; from 

80ºC to 310ºC at 4ºC min-1; 30 min at 310ºC. The GC-C-IRMS precision was checked 

using a standard alkane mix (n-C15 to n-C29) with known isotopic composition. The stable 

carbon isotope compositions are reported in the delta notation (?13C) vs. the VPDB 

Standard.
