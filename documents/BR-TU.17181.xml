RESUMO 

Os eslasmobrânquios, um dos principais predadores do oceano, desempenham um papel 

bastante importante nos ecossistemas marinhos. Eles exercem um controle no tamanho e 

na dinâmica de muitas espécies, no sentido dos níveis tróficos mais baixos para os mais 

altos, ajudando na gestão dos ecossistemas do oceano. Em resultado, o conhecimento da 

ecologia trófica de predadores marinhos torna-se crucial para compreender o importante 

papel que desempenham nos ecossistemas. Neste sentido, este estudo tem por objetivo 

estudar a ecologia alimentar de duas espécies de tubarões de profundidade, Etmopterus 

spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) (lixinha da fundura) e Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) 

(xarinha preta), sobre as quais a informação é muito escassa ou até inexistente. Assim, 

neste estudo são descritos os hábitos alimentares de Etmopterus spinax e Etmopterus 

pusillus, na costa do Algarve, a sul de Portugal. A fim de conhecer a composição da dieta 

alimentar de cada espécie de tubarão de profundidade, efectuaram-se análises de acordo 

com o sexo,o estado de maturação dos indivíduos e as estações do ano para a espécie E. 

spinax e análises de acordo com o sexo para a espécie E. pusillus.  A sua dieta foi 

determinada através da análise do conteúdo dos estômagos de 231 espécimes capturados 

acessoriamente por arrastos de crustáceos, ao longo da costa do Algarve e no período 

compreendido entre 1999-2000 e em 2015, tendo sido rejeitados devido ao seu baixo ou 

nulo valor comercial. Do total de espécimens analisados, 173 pertencem à espécie E. 

spinax e os 58 restantes à espécie E. pusillus. Os espécimes foram medidos (comprimento 

total) e pesados em laboratório, e o estado de maturação de cada um foi atribuido em 

funçãodo comprimento da sua primeira maturação . Os estômagos foram pesados e 

abertos e o estado de digestão dos seus conteúdos foram analisados seguindo uma escala 

com cinco níveis de digestão de acordo com o estado de decomposição em que as presas 

se encontravam. As presas ingeridas foram identificadas através de diferentes chaves 

taxonómicas até ao menor nível de classificação taxonómica possível. Além disso, as 

presas mais afetadas pelo processo de digestão foram identificadas pelas suas estruturas 

duras, como sejam os otólitos no caso dos peixes e os bicos no caso dos cefalópodes. Esta 

análise foi realizada através da aplicação de três tipos de análise, a saber: (1) análises 

quantitativas, como o método numérico (% N), o método gravimétrico (% W) e a 

frequência de ocorrência (% FO); (2) análise mista, como o Índice de Importância 

Relativa (IRI) e o Índice Alimentar Ponderado (IPO2); e (3) análise qualitativa, como a 

classificação das categorias de presas encontradas. De igual modo, também foram 



xii 
 

aplicados seis tipos de análise complementar, como sejam os índices de diversidade 

(índice de Shannon), riqueza específica (índice de Margalef) e uniformidade de espécies 

(indice de Pielou), o índice de sobreposição trófica (índice de Schoener), o nível trófico 

e o índice de vacuidade (VI). Além disso, foi realizada uma análise estatística 

multivariada, mediante a utilização do software PRIMER V6.0, recorrendo ao uso de 

diferentes testes (CLUSTERS, MSD, ANOSIM e SIMPER). Mediante estas análises, este 

estudo vem demonstrar a existência de uma sobreposição trófica na dieta de E. spinax e 

E. pusillus, onde foi observado que a diversidade das espécies de presas encontradas nos 

conteúdos dos estômagos foi baixa, não existindo diferencas significativas entre as duas 

dietas (Mann-Whitney, p &gt; 0,05), o que leva a sugerir que podem apresentar uma dieta 

seletiva.  Portanto foi possível observar a existência de uma certa homogeneidade na dieta 

alimentar entre as duas espécies de tubarões de profundidade. Alem disso, os resultados 

obtidos neste estudo permitiram observar evidências de que ambas as espécies partilham 

os mesmos recursos se bem que em proporções diferentes. Ambas as espécies 

alimentaram-se principalmente de três grupos de presas: crustáceos, peixes e cefalópodes. 

As principais presas encontradas na dieta dos tubarões de profundidade em estudo 

consistiram em organismos da subordem Natantia (presas preferenciais), peixes não 

identificados (presas secundárias) e cefalópodes (presas acessórias) no caso de E. spinax. 

Enquanto que as principais presas encontradas na dieta de E. pusillus foram peixes não 

identificados (presas preferenciais), organismos da subordem Natantia (presas 

secundárias) e cefalópodes (presas acessórias). Para além disso, encontrou-se um número 

elevado de estômagos vazios que se veio a reflectir num elevado valor de vacuidade em 

ambos os tubarões, podendo este facto estar relacionado, com a duração dos arrastos (de 

várias horas), na medida em que o período de longas horas em que a embarcação vai 

arrastando no fundo pode ser que seja o suficiente para que haja uma completa digestão 

dos estômagos, tornando os seus conteúdos não identificáveis. Não houve diferenças 

significativas na composição da dieta de E. pusillus de acordo com o sexo (ANOSIM, 

p&gt;0,05).  Para E. spinax tambem não foram encontradas diferenças de acordo com o sexo 

e a estação do ano (ANOSIM, p&gt;0,05). Além disso, também não houve diferenças de 

acordo com o estado de maturação , apresentando a dieta entre espécimes imaturos e 

maturos uma elevada variabilidade (ANOSIM, R=0,05, p&lt;0.05).  No entanto, no caso dos 

espécimes maduros de ambos os sexos de E. spinax foi possível observar uma ligeira 

variação da dieta alimentar. A dieta consistiu principalmente de pequenos crustáceos para 

os espécimes imaturos, mudando a sua composição para presas potencialmente maiores, 



xiii 
 

como peixes, para espécimes maduros. Esta mudança na dieta alimentar pode ser causada 

por variações ontogénicas, uma vez que a alimentação está relacionada com o tamanho 

da boca, a capacidade de armazenamento do estômago e a capacidade de natação de cada 

indivíduo; e também pela necessidade de obter a energia necessária de acordo com o ciclo 

reprodutivo em que se encontra. Consequentemente, o fato de os espécimes maiores 

consumirem presas maiores pode ajudar a reduzir a competição entre indivíduos da 

mesma espécie ou de espécies diferentes. Por outro lado, em termos de sazonalidade, os 

crustáceos continuaram a  fazer parte da dieta principal de E. spinax. O fato de não se 

terem encontrado diferenças significativas entre a sazonalidade e a composição da dieta 

de E. spinax pode ser devido à estabilidade da temperatura no meio. As variações de 

temperatura são geralmente grandes na superfície e mínimas a grandes profundidades, de 

modo que podem afectar na composição das presas, nas flutuações de abundância e/ou as 

alterações na distribuição na coluna de água. Finalmente, os resultados obtidos neste 

estudo foram comparados com os de outros autores, verificando-se algumas diferenças, 

no que respeita à dieta alimentar entre  E. spinax e E. pusillus.

Abstract 

The knowledge about the trophic ecology of marine predators is crucial to understand 

their ecological role in ecosystems. In this study, the feeding ecology of two small deep 

water Lanternsharks, Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) and Etmopterus pusillus 

(Lowe, 1839), from the Algarve coast, south Portugal, was analysed. In order to better 

understand their diet composition, this study included an evaluation by sex, maturity stage 

and seasonality. For this purpose, the stomach contents of 173 E. spinax and 58 E. pusillus 

individuals were analysed. Through univariate quantitative analysis as well as occurrence 

percent by number (%N), weight (%W) and frequency of occurrence (%FO) and mixed 

analysis as Relative Importance Index (%IRI) and Weighted Food Index (IPO2) of prey 

items were obtained for both deep-water shark species. Also, additional indices such as 

overlap index, trophic level, vacuity index, diversity, richness and evenness indices were 

used. Besides a statistical analysis was performed through multivariate analysis with 

Software PRIMER V6.0, using different tests (CLUSTERS, MSD, ANOSIM and 

SIMPER). Through the results obtained by these analysis there seems to exist a trophic 

overlap in the diet of these deep-water shark species, with a low diversity, richness and 

evenness of prey species in their stomach contents. Thereby, it is possible to suggest that 

they are selective predators. Mainly crustaceans, fish and cephalopods were found in their 

diets. In general, it was observed that E. spinax has a preference for crustaceans (mainly 

Natantia organisms), followed by fish (unidentified fish) and cephalopods (unidentified 

cephalopods) as accessory prey. However, in case of E. pusillus the preference for fish 

(mainly unidentified fish), followed by crustaceans (Natantia organisms) and 

cephalopods (unidentified cephalopods) as accessory prey. On the other hand, the sex, 

maturity and season variables were not significant sources of variation in the diet of E. 

spinax species. In the same way, no significant differences concerning sex was observed 

for E. pusillus diet. Finally, the results obtained in this study were compared with the 

some author studies verifying some differences with regard to the diet of E. spinax and 

E. pusillus.  

Key words: Etmopterus spinax, Etmopterus pusillus, Algarve, feeding ecology, stomach 

contents analysis, trophic level.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. General introduction 

There have been long, large changes on different time scales that have affected 

marine communities. In the case of benthic marine assemblages, they have experienced 

gradual long-term changes related to climate and sea level oscillations (Cartes et al., 

2013). These changes have not only affected various taxonomic levels but also trophic 

groups, causing changes in the habitat and the ecological dynamics of benthic 

communities. However, despite all these changes, the sharks have been swimming in the 

oceans of the world for more than 400 million years (Griffin, 2008). 

The Chondrichthyes class, including cartilaginous fish, sharks, rays and 

chimaeras, is a very old and successful group of jawed fish, which currently contains 

between 900 and 1100 know living species (Compagno, 1990). They show a highly 

morphological diversity during most of their evolutionary development from the 

Paleozoic to the present days. It is important to know that they are relatively large 

predators which have remained in a competitive environment such as marine ecosystems. 

Cartilaginous fish are highly diverse and they show different life-history styles to which 

they have to adapt. Usually they are large migratory which are distributed in all types of 

marine environments with different characteristics (Compagno, 1990).  

Elasmobranchs are top predators, playing an important role in the marine 

ecosystems with a top-down control on the size and dynamics of many species (Valls et 

al., 2011). Top predators keep all species bellow them in the trophic chain, because they 

directly limit the populations of their prey and help to manage healthy ocean ecosystems, 

including seagrass beds and coral reefs (Griffin et al., 2008). Furthermore, they exploit a 

wide range of habitats, from epipelagic to deep-sea benthic environments (Xavier et al., 

2012). Nowadays, populations of sharks are being decimated by commercial fishing, and 

some species are vulnerable to extinction (Lopez et al., 2009), because sharks usually 

tend to have a slow growth rate, late age of maturity and low fecundity. This means that 

they follow a K-selected life-history strategy (Stevens et al., 2000), so their recruitment 

is directly dependent on the size of stock. These reasons determine that some populations 

will probably not be able to recover quickly from overexploitation, thus harming the 

sustainability of fisheries (Stevens et al., 2000). 

The pressure of fisheries induces special vulnerability in species, and in low-

productivity habitats such as deep-sea, mainly due to the fast growth of this industry and 



3 

 

the by-catch. Each year, humans kill more than 100 million sharks worldwide, this 

includes the tens of millions of sharks that are caught annually for their fins, which are 

one of the most expensive seafood products of the world (Griffin et al., 2008). On the 

other hand, sharks are important from an economical point of view for their flesh for 

human consumption, skin for making complement stuff like handbags, belts and also as 

sandpaper to pottery and wood, liver for oil extraction and for medical use, jaws as 

trophies and in aquariums for entertainment (García, 2008). Another important factor that 

may contribute to the decline of  their populations is the scarceness of prey that may be 

threatened from over fishing and habitat loss due to coastal development and pollution 

(García, 2008). Additionally, all species are exposed to the risk of bioaccumulation of 

contaminants in their bodies because of their high rank position in the trophic chain 

(García, 2008). All these factors cause significant problems for the correct conservation 

and management of sharks. 

On the other hand, to understand the biological interactions in animal communities 

and the dynamics of marine ecosystems it is essential to know the trophic relationships 

(Valls et al., 2011). Unfortunately, there is still little information about the feeding 

ecology of most elasmobranchs; only the species with important commercial value are 

studied. The diets of most top predators are normally quite varied. This allows them to 

change prey species when certain populations are low (Griffin et al., 2008), being an 

advantage since they allow prey species to persist. Moreover Pardo-Gandarillas et al., 

(2007) suggested that the size, the movement of prey and the contrast with the medium 

are commonly positive relationships between the size of predator fish and their prey. 

Besides, visual characteristics that may influence the selection of prey by predators are 

important in sharks feeding ecology. 

As Fanelli et al. (2009) described, the segregation and competition among species 

may be the result of the combination of several niche aspects, one of which may be 

preponderant over the others. It is necessary to determine the food and feeding ecology 

of sharks to clarify the relationships between sharks, prey availability and fisheries 

(Xavier et al., 2012), thus the study of the stomach contents is necessary to contribute the 

analysis of bio-ecological aspects in ecosystems where the species are integrated. 

1.2. Description of studied species  

Compagno et al. (2005) reported that the family Etmopteridae is the largest 

squaloid shark family, with more than 50 species distributed in five genera. The genus 



4 

 

Etmopterus is the most diverse genus of this family, containing at least 31 described 

species. In Portugal, the genus Etmopterus is commonly caught as by-catch and discarded 

by several deep-water fisheries that operate in the area (Xavier et al., 2012).

1.2.2. Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) 

 
Figure 1.1: Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) (drawing by @ Laura Nuño Munõz). 

1.2.2.1.General diagnosis 

Etmopterus spinax (Fig. 1.1), commonly called Velvet belly, is a small sized deep-

water squaliform shark, characterized by a fairly stout body, which is brown above and 

black below and has big eyes (Compagno et al., 2005). It has a flattened snout, the upper 

teeth are small, with a narrow central cusp and usually less than three pairs of lateral 

cusplets. Lower teeth are much larger, strongly slanted, with blade-like cusps at the top 

and interlocked bases. On the other hand, the five pairs of gill slits are tiny compared with 

the size to the spiracles. Its main characteristic is the grooved spines that are located on 

both dorsal fins, with the second one much longer than the first one and curved, being 

perfectly visible. The anal fin is absent and the caudal fin is long. The Velvet Belly also 

possesses numerous photophores which emit a blue-green light visible from away and are 

distributed in a unique pattern for this species, as defined by. It can measure up to a 



5 

 

maximum of 60.0 cm in total length for male or unsexed; its length is normally ~ 45.0 

cm, however females are larger than males Compagno (1984). 

1.2.2.2. Biological characteristics  

The Velvet Belly Lanternshark has an aplacental viviparous reproduction, i.e. the 

embryos develop inside the eggs that are retained within the mother’s body until they are 

ready to hatch. Females usually have litters of 6 or 7 hatchlings. Studies by Coelho and 

Erizini (2005) revealed that for E. spinax the size at first maturity is significantly higher 

for females (30.86 cm; 75.8% of the maximum observed size) than males, (25.39 cm; 

75.1% of the maximum observed size).   

Regarding their mating season, Aranha et al. (2009) reported that during the 

months of April and July it is possible to occur the breeding season of the females. 

However, in case of males, a higher percentage of active males was observed during May 

and June. The lifespan of E. spinax is estimated at 22 years for females and at 18 years 

for males (Gennari and Scacco, 2007). 

1.2.2.3. Distribution and habitat 

 The Velvet belly is distributed from the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean, 

extending from Iceland and Norway to Gabon, including the Mediterranean Sea, 

Archipelago of the Azores, Canary Islands and Cape Verde. The species has also been 

reported in the Cape Province in South Africa (Fig. 1.2). This shark species lives mainly 

in the outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes, mostly at depths of 200 to 

500 meters, near or well above the bottom. However the depth range for the species can 

range from 70 to 2000 meters, FishBase, (Froese and Pauly, 2015).

1.2.3. Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) 

 

Figure 1.3. Etmopterus pusillus (Lowe, 1839) (drawing by @ Laura Nuño Munõz) 
 

1.2.3.1.General diagnosis 

Etmopterus pusillus (Fig. 1.3) also commonly called the Smooth lanternshark, is 

a small sized deep-water shark, globally widespread (Coelho and Erzini, 2007). It is 

characterized by a large head with a pointed snout and large oval eyes. This species has 

many rows of teeth on both jaws, where lower teeth are smooth, blade-like and with cusps, 

on the upper jaw they have cusplets (Compagno, 1984). On the other hand, the skin is 

covered by many widely spaced small blocky denticles not arranged in regular rows, 

giving it a smooth appearance. On its two dorsal fins there are two spines, being the one 

on the dorsal fin much larger than the one on the first. In addition, there is no anal fin, 

and the caudal fin is short and broad. The coloration is uniform dark brown along the 

dorsal side, with an obscure broad black mark running above, in front and behind pelvic 

fins (Compagno, 1984).  

1.2.3.2. Biological characteristics  

Coelho and Erzini (2005) reported that the Smooth lanternshark is an aplacental 

viviparous species which presents preliminary lengths at maturity, but there is no other 

biological information available. Generally the family Etmopteridae is characterized by 

having a very slow growth rate, late maturities and low reproductive potential (Fowler et 

al., 2005). The size at first maturity for E. pusillus is significantly higher for females than 

for males, obtaining in this case, results where the size at first maturity was 43.60 cm 

(86.9% of the maximum observed size) for females and 38.10 cm for males (79.5% of the 

maximum observed size) as Coelho et al. (2005) reported. 

Regarding their reproductive cycle, Coelho and Erzini (2007) stated that it is 

difficult to establish a definitive reproductive season. Nevertheless, both mature females 

with ripe oocytes and pregnant females were recorded mainly during the winter, from 



7 

 

November to April. However the active males appeared during the entire year, so it is not 

possible to define a reproductive season clearly. 

1.2.3.3.Distribution and habitat 

The Smooth lanternshark has a global distribution (Fig. 1.4), and can be found in 

the western Atlantic, in the northern area of the Gulf of Mexico and between southern 

Brazil and Argentina, but also in the eastern Atlantic from Portugal to Namibia. It has 

also been reported in the western Indian Ocean, South Africa and in the western Pacific 

near Japan. This species lives mainly on the continental and insular shelves, and upper 

slopes at depths from 274 to 1000 meters, but it has also been described in oceanic waters, 

between Argentina and South Africa, FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2015). 

 
Figure 1.4. Geographical distribution of Etmopterus pusillus (Linnaeus, 1758) (source: Global species 

database of fish species, FishBase Froese and Pauly, 2015). 

1.2.4. Feeding ecology of both species of lantern sharks 
 

According to several authors, (Neiva et al., 2006, Fanelli et al., 2009 and Xavier et 

al., 2012) both species of lantern sharks have similar feeding ecology. This is due to their 

main diet being based on Euphausiids, teleost fish, Natantid decapods and cephalopods, 

and many food items found in the stomach of both sharks belonging to the same species. 

The main species of prey found in E. spinax were Meganyctiphanes norvegica 

(Euphausiids), Pasiphaea sivado (Natantid decapods), Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis 

blennoides and myctophids family (teleosts fish) and some cephalopods like Sepietta 

oweniana (Neiva et al., 2006) and Histhioteuthis spp. (Fanelli et al., 2009). On the other 

hand the main prey species in the diet of E. pusillus were Pasiphaea sivado, 

Micromesistius poutassou, Myctiophids, Ommastrephidae and Sepiolidade families 

(Xavier et al., 2012). 

 

 



8 

 

1.2.4.1. Main prey items  

- Euphausiids: 

- Meganyctiphanes norvegica (M. Sars, 1857): 

Cruzin-Roudy et al. (2004) reported that the populations of this species of 

Crustacea, also called Northern krill, are adapted to very different environments and 

trophic conditions along the European coasts and adjacent seas. Krill perform vertical 

migrations from about 100 m in shallow environments reaching more than 500 m in 

the Ligurian Sea. Their reproductive season is long during spring and summer seasons 

for the northern sites and short during the late winter and early spring in the Ligurian 

Sea. 

- Natantid  decapod: 

- Pasiphaea sivado (Risso, 1816): 

This Crustacean of the family Pasiphaeidae is distributed along the eastern Atlantic, 

British Islands and Mediterranean Sea. It is a demersal species and it lives between 10 

and 600 m deep. P. sivado is an ovigerous species and their reproductive cycle happens 

during the early summer (July) and early winter (December) (Falcai et al. 1995).  

- Teleosts fish: 

- Micromesistius poutassou (Risso, 1827): 

Blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is a bathypelagic gadoid which is found 

along to the north-east Atlantic, from Spitsbergen (Greenland) in the north to Morocco 

(Africa) in the south (Heino et al., 2008). Usually this species is distributed between 300 

to 400 m from the surface but it can be found at depths of over 150-3000 m in midwaters, 

FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2015). The reproduction of this species of gadoid is produced 

from February in the south to May in the north, at 180-360 m, on the edge of continental 

shelf (Marine Species Identification Portal, 2015).  

- Phycis blennoides (Brünnich, 1768): 

Phycis blennoides is another gadoid species, which is distributed from the eastern 

Atlantic to West Africa (Norway and Iceland to Cape Blanc), also the Mediterranean Sea. 

It is possible to found at a depth range of 10 to 800 m, over sand and mud bottoms (Cohen 

et al., 1990). The spawning period observed in this species in the Mediterranean Sea 

occurs from January to March (Svetovidov, 1986; Cohen et al., 1990; Massutí et al., 1996 

in Rotllant et al., 2002). 

 



9 

 

- Family Myctophidae: 

According to Nelson (2006) the Myctiophids are the most species-rich family of 

mesopelagic fishes with 235 species. They are possible to found in all oceans from near 

the surface to deep waters, because they have a diurnal migration of several hundred 

meters. During the daytime the peak abundance of most species is between 300 and 1200 

m depth, while at night they are between 10 and 100 m. Their period of spawning is very 

variable (Marine Species Identification Portal, 2015).  

- Cephalopods: 

- Sepietta oweniana (d'Orbigny, 1841): 

Sepietta oweniana is a cephalopod species, which belongs to the family Sepiolidae. 

It is a benthopelagic species that is found over muddy bottoms on the shelf and the upper 

slope, ranging in depth from about 50 to over 600 m. It has a geographical distribution 

from Northeast Atlantic (Norway), at depths of 50-100 m, to Morroco and the 

Mediterranean Sea, at 100-400 m. Their entire spawning period extends from March to 

November (Roper et al., 1984).  

-Family Histioteuthidae Verrill, 1881: 

The species of this family of cephalopods are widespread from Eastern and western 

central Atlantic and western Mediterranean; southeast Atlantic, south Indian Ocean 

(limits undetermined); west of the Galapagos Islands off California, Hawaii and Japan; 

South Pacific. It is an oceanic species, which is reported to usually exist between depths 

of 500 and 1500 m, sometimes associated with the bottom (Roper et al., 1984). According 

to Cuccu et al. (2014), these cephalopods have a single breeding period in their life, due 

to them being semelparous, but a great flexibility has been observed in their reproductive 

strategies, which range from simultaneous terminal spawning over a short period at the 

end of the animal’s life to continuous spawning over a long period of their life.  

- Ommastrephes bartramii d’Orbigny, 1835: 

Ommastrephes bartramii has a wide and discontinuous distribution in subtropical 

and temperate ocean waters and it is absent from equatorial waters (Boschi, 1998). As 

Watanabe et al. (2004) reported, this species are mainly distributed in the 300 to 600 m 

layer during the daytime and migrate to the 0 to 100 m layer at night in transitional waters 

of the central North Pacific. The period of spawning for Ommastrephes bartramii is rather 

extended (January to May in Japan) (Roper, 1984). 



10 

 

1.2.5. Economic and conservation values in fisheries 

As explained above, Elasmobranch fishes are generally highly susceptible to 

fishing mortality. According to Coelho and Erzini (2008) the genus Etmopterus is caught  

in deep-water fisheries (mainly bottom trawl) that operate in Portuguese waters. In these 

fisheries Etmopterus pusillus is caught in large quantities as a by-catch species but, due 

to its low or insignificant commercial value, it is more often discarded (Coelho and Erzini, 

2008). The Algarve is the sixth area with the highest fish discharge (by biomass) using 

crustacean trawl fishery (Neiva et al., 2006). In the semi-pelagic and near-bottom longline 

fishery for hake (Merlucciidae) Etmopterus pusillus is the fourth most abundant species 

caught. However, the catch of this species is not recorded in the fishery statistics of 

Portugal making it difficult to obtain any information about its biology, feeding 

preferences and ecology (Xavier et al., 2012). This also seems to be the case with catches 

of Etmopterus spinax in the coast of southern Portugal.  

The two studied species are exposed to high levels of fishing mortality, long life 

cycles with slow growth rates, late maturity and low fecundities (Coelho et al., 2010). 

The intense fishing activities combined with the biological factors of these species will 

probably contribute for their decline in a very near future, and it could take decades for 

them to recover.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



11 

 

1.3.  Objectives of this study: 

The main aim of this study was to determine the feeding composition of two 

species of small deep-water Lanternsharks (Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus pusillus). 

Secondary objectives were: 

1) Evaluating the diet of each species by sex and maturity stage; 

2) Evaluating the influence of seasonality into the diet of each species; 

3) Determining the trophic level of each species;  

4) Comparing the diets of the two species of lanternsharks.  

Despite being widespread along the Algarve coast, there is still not much 

information on the feeding ecology of these two species. Consequently, studying the 

feeding habits of these species is important to reach a better knowledge of their behaviour 

and their position in the trophic level.  Studying their biology and gathering information 

about their suitable habitats may be an important step towards the conservation of these 

vulnerable species or contribute to reduce their discards and/or increase their economic 

value. For these reasons, this study has a social, economic and especially biological 

interest.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1.  Geographic localization of the studied area 

Stomachs from E. spinax and E. pusillus were taken from specimens fished in the 

Atlantic Ocean off the Algarve coast. This region is located in the south of Portugal, 

where Faro is the administrative centre (37? 01’ N, 7? 56’ W). It has a surface area of 

4960 km2, and around 200 km of coast, from Odeceixe in the west to Vila Real do Santo 

António close to the Spanish border in the southeast (Monteiro, 1987). The west coast is 

characterized by a rugged coastline with cliffs, and the south coast is mainly distinguished 

by its sandy beaches and limestone caves (Monteiro, 1987). There are also particular 

geological features that generate specific conditions for the sea environment or the current 

flow patterns, and consequently for the ecological biodiversity and trophic relations in 

the natural wildlife. The continental shelf has a variable width, from 8 km in Cabo de 

Santa Maria to 30 km near the locality of Portimão, whereas the depth is limited from 

about 110 to 150 meters (Magalhães, 2001).  

As for the geological features, the current flow is normally weak and the main 

drift current follows the coastline at a bathymetry about 30 meters (Magalhães, 2001). In 

addition, the Algarve coast is also under the influence of the Mediterranean Sea because 

its water, denser and warmer, flows through the Gibraltar Strait into the Atlantic Ocean 

and affects it at a hydrological and biological level (Monteiro, 1987). Thereby, the sea 

surface temperature oscillates between 17? C in winter and 21? C in summer, occurring a 

stratification during this period. Furthermore, the temperature at a depth about 50 m is 

established at around 15? C during the whole year (Sanchez and Relvas, 2003).  

2.2. Characterization of sample 

 The biological material used to develop the present study was collected from 

accidental catches, called bycatch, and discards of crustaceans and fish deep-water 

commercial trawlers throughout the south coast of Algarve (Portugal). These captures 

were carried out during two scientific projects concerning bycatch and discards 

(BYDISCARD, CE DGXIV-99/058; DISCALG, CE DGXIV-97/0087) (Costa et al., 

2002), which began in February 1999 and ended in September 2000. Fish samples also 

come from a campaign for evaluating bycatch of the crustacean trawl fishery in the 

Algarve, which lasted for five days, this began on the 27th of April 2015 and ended on the 

3rd of May 2015. In the Algarve coast bycatch can exceed the catch of target species with 



14 

 

this type of fishing gear (Campos and Fonseca, 2004), similar to what happens in many 

crustacean trawl fisheries worldwide.  

During the two scientific projects concerning bycatch and discards, previously 

specified, 173 Etmopterus spinax specimens were randomly collected (out of 629) from 

297 m to 754 m deep (Annex 4). On the other hand, during the sampling/campaign of 

2015, 58 individuals of Etmopterus pusillus were collected. In this last case, the trawl was 

working at depths ranging from 160 m to 490 m off the coast of Olhão (Algarve, Portugal) 

(Annex 5). More lately, the individuals were stored in the freezer so they would not 

deteriorate for further analysis in the laboratory. 

Length, sex, maturity and season data were taken from the above mentioned project’s 

database. Individuals from the second campaign were measured (Total length, cm and 

weight, g) and sexed at the laboratory. The total length (cm) was used for each specimen 

of each species in order to obtain the state of maturity for each shark species (Tab. 2.1). 

The broad maturity stage (juvenil vs adult) of each individual was determined by 

confronting each individual length with the length at first maturity according to data 

reported by Coelho and Erzini (2005) for both species of lantern sharks. In the case of E. 

spinax, the length at 50% maturity was 30.86 cm for females and 25.39 cm for males, 

while the length at 50% maturity for E. pusillus was higher than for E. spinax, obtaining 

a length of 43.60 cm for females and 38.10 cm for males.

In the case of season analysis, the samples were grouped in two different categories 

according to the month in which the specimens were caught. This fact was due to the 



15 

 

samples shortage of some seasons. Then, the specimens obtained during the warm months 

were grouped into the hot season category (spring and summer), and the specimens 

caught during the cold months were grouped into the cold season category (winter and 

autumn).  

2.3.Laboratory procedure 

The stomach samples of E. spinax, were kept in formalin for a time. Therefore the 

stomachs were removed from formalin plastic containers where they were individually 

preserved in 4% buffered formalin and subsequently immersed in 70% ethanol in marked 

containers for further analysis (Costa et al., 2002). The use of 4% formalin allows the 

fixation of tissues and also minimizes the digestion process when the individual is caught 

(Bowen, 1983 in Gonçalves, 2000). Once the remaining contents of formalin disappeared, 

each stomach was weighed, considering the result as wet weight. Subsequently the sample 

was opened and the content was placed on a Petri plate using small ethanol jets, then the 

remaining liquid was removed with an absorbent paper (Fig. 2.1). On the other hand the 

stomach wall was weighed (wet weight) to have a more accurate value of the weight of 

the contents in the stomach. Later, the individuals ingested were identified using a lens 

and sorted into different categories (cephalopods, crustaceans and fish). Furthermore, the 

category of not identified preys was assigned in the case of prey items really affected by 

the digestion process (Fig. 2.2). After this procedure, individuals of each taxon were 

weighed (total weight) separately using scales (± 0.01 g). Once the stomach contents of 

all individuals were weighed, they were transferred to small plastic containers with 

ethanol 70% for further taxonomic analysis.

For the identification procedure different taxonomic keys were used depending on 

the phyllum of each organism found (Zariquiey, 1968; Roper et al., 1984; Falciai and 

Minervini, 2005). On the other hand, it is also important to know that all preys were 

digested and the identification process was complicated. In the cases in which the 

stomachs were full of sediment and/or unidentified bulk, the data was not taken into 

account for further analysis. A digestion key was used to identify the digested rank 

according to the decomposition state of the preys (Aloncle and Delaporte, 1970). This 

key describes the degradation state for fishes, crustaceans, bivalves and polychaetes. The 

rank ranges from 1 to 4 for fish, crustaceans and polychaetes and from 1 to 3 for bivalves, 

being 1 the state in which the preys have been digested recently and therefore they have 

a firm consistency, in the 2 state the prey begin to decompose, and finally 3 and/or 4 the 

state in which only the hard parts of individuals will be preserved. In order to avoid 

digestion biases, prey items were identified mainly based on fresh hard parts, such as fish 

otoliths, cephalopod beaks, crustacean carapaces or appendices, reaching the lowest 

taxonomic level possible. So as for our case, the fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks were 

treated in order to reach each ingested prey’s type. 

Figure 2.2: Prey items (cephalopods, crustaceans and fish) found in the stomach contents of E. spinax and 

E. pusillus in different digestion stages (photos by @ Laura Nuño Muñoz). 

The otoliths were identified observing their morphologic descriptions according 

to otolith shapes, outline and groove features using different taxonomic keys such as 

Tuset et al. (2008) and Ramos (1999). 

The cephalopods beaks were identified according to different measures on the 

upper and lower beak, where both beak measures were used as independent variables in 

a linear regression model with mantle length and body weight (log transformed) of 

different cephalopod species (Wolff, 1984) (Fig. 2.3).  

In our case only the beak measures reported by Wolff (1984) were taken for the 

identification of each cephalopod species by lens. The upper beak measures were: Length 



17 

 

of the rostrum (RL), rostral tip to inner margin of wing (RW), length of hood (HL), width 

of the wing (WW), wing to crest length (WCL), jaw angle width (JW), and length of the 

crest (CL). Similarly the lower beak measures were: Rostral tip to inner posterior corner 

of the lateral wall (RC), rostral tip to inner margin of wing (RW), length of the rostrum 

(RL), length of the wing (WL) and jaw angle width (JW). 

 
Figure 2.3: Side and top view of upper part and lower part of cephalopod beak with their different measures 

(Wolff, 1984). 

Finally, the data obtained was stored in a data base to proceed to perform 

calculations with different statistical analysis types. 

2.4. Representativeness of the sample 

Calculating the trophic diversity by Shannon index or calculation of the 

cumulative number of dietary items are the main methods used to determine the number 

of predators which are necessary to describe their diet, for this purpose the number of 

individuals analysed must be random (Hurtubia, 1973; Cailliet, 1977 in Gonçalves, 2000). 

To consider a sample representative, it needs to reach a point in which the curve defined 

by each method, begins to stabilize. This point of stabilization is the point at which the 

probability of not considering an important item in the diet is quite low (Gonçalves, 

2000). 

In this study, the cumulative number of prey species found in the stomachs 

analysed for both species of sharks , which contained some prey type, was used, 

considering all individuals identified to the lowest taxonomic level. 

 

 



18 

 

2.5. Univariate statistical analyses 

2.5.1. Quantitative analyses 

Diet quantity data was analysed by Relative Measures of Prey Quantities 

(RMPQs) using the following indices: percentage of occurrence by number (%N), 

percentage of frequency of occurrence (%F), and percentage of occurrence by weight 

(%W) of prey items (Preti et al., 2008).  

2.5.1.1. Numeric method: 

The value %N is the number of individuals of a specific taxon (n) found in all 

stomachs divided by the total number of all prey found into the stomach which contained 

prey (N) and multiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). 

%? =
?

?
× 100 

Normally the digestion process causes the fractionation of prey species, so it was 

necessary to establish some criteria for accounting for prey individuals for further 

analyses (Gonçalves, 2000). In the case of the prey that were most affected by the 

digestion process and which were identified by their distinctive parts. However some prey 

species could not be quantified, thus it was considered an amount of 1 individual (e.g., a 

group of similar fish scales). However, in the case of the prey that were least affected by 

the digestion process their quantification could be performed. 

2.5.1.2. Gravimetric method: 

 The gravimetric method or percentage by weight (%W) is obtained as the total 

weight of all remains of a specific taxon (w) divided by the total weight of all prey remains 

found (W) multiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). 

%? =
?

?
× 100 

2.5.1.3. Frequency of occurrence: 

This quantitative index (%F) is represented as the number of stomachs containing 

prey of a specific taxon (f) divided by the total number of stomachs containing prey 

multiplied by 100 (Hyslop, 1980). 

%?? =
?

????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????
× 100 



19 

 

It is possible that the sum of the frequency of occurrence values could exceeded 

100%, because more than one different item can be found in the same stomach 

(Gonçalves, 2000). Different categories of prey can be distinguished according to the 

results obtained for %F (Cardoza Martínez et al., 2011), which indicates the possible 

feeding preferences of an organism: accidental prey (%F &amp;lt;10%), secondary prey (10% 

&amp;lt;%F &amp;lt;50%) and preferential prey (%F &gt; 50%). 

In addition, to normalize the different indices and thereby compare them more 

easily (inter- and intraspecific comparisons), Rosecchi and Nouaze (1987) proposed 

altering its formula to transform the values of FO to percentage as occurs with %N and 

%W values, obtaining the corrected occurrence frequency (FOc) by modifying all indices 

in which it operates: 

??? = 100 ×
%??

? %??
 

Regarding the calculation of this quantitative analyses it is important to highlight 

that the empty stomachs and stomachs with sediment content were not considered in the 

calculation of the different indices of this study. 

2.5.2. Mixed analyses 

In order to evaluate the main preys in the diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus, different 

mixed analysis were calculated, taking into account the quantitative methods (%N, %W 

and %F) aforementioned. The mixed indices analysed were: Index of Relative Importance 

(IRI) and a Weighted Food Index (IPO2) (Gonçalves, 2000). 

2.5.2.1. Index of Relative Importance (IRI) 

The Index of Relative Importance (IRI) is the result of the interaction of %N, %F 

and %V (Volumetric percentage), which was developed to assist in evaluating the 

relationship between the various food items found in stomachs (Pinkas et al., 1971). In 

our study the %V parameter was amended by %W parameter as Capitoli et al. (1995) 

previously reported. This index can be calculated by adding the percentage of occurrence 

by number and percentage of occurrence by weight values and multiplying by the 

percentage of frequency of occurrence value, obtaining the following equation: 

IRI = (%N + %W) × %FO 

  In order to facilitate the inter- and intraspecific comparisons among studies  (Preti 

et al., 2008), the IRI value was converted into the percentage to keep the same scale as 



20 

 

other indices. Index values are sorted into decreasing order according to their %IRI 

contribution (Carrassón et al., 1992) for further calculation of cumulative %IRI.  

 

2.5.2.2. Weighted Food Index (IPO2): 

The Weighted Food Index IPO2, assigned high weight values according to their 

nutritional importance (Mattson, 1981; Bowen, 1983 in Gonçalves, 2000). The weighted 

value “x”, which corresponds to a value of 0.25, the sum of %N and %FO. Moreover it 

is also attributed the value “y” to %W, which corresponds to 0.5, causing the value of the 

weight component to have a higher importance, due to the addition of these three 

parameters (Gonçalves, 2000): 

a) IPO2 = (%N + %FO) x “x” + %W x “y”  (x = 0.25 and y = 0.5) 

2.5.3. General classification methods prey 

The prey were classified into different categories according to classification 

methods of Rosecchi and Nouaze (1987), in which all indices, obtained in percentage, 

were arranged in descending order. This was followed by the sum of the values of the 

first category with the second category and so on, reaching 50% of the value of the total 

index (preferential prey). Then the addition of the index values for the same cumulative 

order to reach 75% of the total index, corresponds to secondary prey, considering the 

remaining prey with values reaching 100%, as accessory prey. 

This general classification method allows a comparison between the diets 

calculated through the different indices, and also indicates the existing food selectivity by 

the number of preferential prey groups (Gonçalves, 2000). 

  The IRI, MFI, and IPO2 indices were calculated to obtain the principal, secondary 

and accessory prey items (Annex 4-19) according to Gonçalves, (2000) (Annex 4).  

2.5.4. Vacuity Index (VI)  

 The Vacuity Index (VI) was used to determinate the filling state of stomachs 

(Cardoza Martínez et al., 2011), so that it could be indicators of the feeding activity of 

fishes. Thus, to evaluate the percentage of empty stomachs the Vacuity Index (VI) was 

used, considering VI as the number of empty stomachs divided by the total number of 

examined stomachs multiplied by 100. This index provides information about the 

physical conditions and the feeding activity periods of individuals (fasting or end of 

digestive process) (Simões de Sá, 2008). 



21 

 

2.5.5. Comparing the diets between species 

2.5.5.1. Feeding overlap (Schoener Index) 

The Schoener Index was used to evaluate dietary affinities between the different 

sexes, size classes, and seasons, in terms of absolute prey abundance (Cartes and Sardà, 

1989). According to Brulé and Canché (1993), the feeding overlap index can be calculated 

by the following equation: 

? = 1 ? 0.5 (?|??? ? ??? |

?

?=1

) 

As Morte et al., (2002) determined, n is the number of food organisms, pxi and pyi 

are the numerical composition indices of prey (i) in the diets of species x and y, 

respectively. This index has a minimum value of 0 when the overlap feeding is non-

existent, and a maximum value of 1 when all prey have the same proportion inside the 

stomachs. There are three categories established according to the results of Schoener 

index values: i) low level (0 - 0.29), ii) mean level (0.30 – 0.60), and iii) high level (&gt; 

0.60), which indicates a trophic overlap (Simões de Sá, 2008). However, if the overlap 

index value is below 0.6 it is normally because diets of different species are significantly 

different (Cartes and Sardà, 1989). 

2.5.5.2. Trophic level: 

In order to determine the position in the trophic chain of deep-water shark species 

the trophic levels (TL) based on diets of E. spinax and E. pusillus were estimated. For the 

TL calculation for each shark species was taken into account the average trophic level 

value for each prey category (TLk) according to Cortés (1999) methodology using 

standardized IRI: 

TLk = 1 + (? Pj
j=1

×  TLj) 

Where j is the number of prey categories, Pj is the proportion of the IRI index of 

the prey “j” and TLj is the trophic level of each prey category “j”. 

2.5.5.3. Diversity, Richness and Evenness Indices 

The diversity indices are composed by two different components, the total number 

of species and the evenness; in other words, how the abundance data is distributed among 



22 

 

the species. Although they are easy to use, there are many problems due to certain 

limitations (Ludwing and Reynolds, 1988). The reason is the confusion between these 

two variables when trying to combine them. Moreover, the species richness is the oldest 

and the simplest concept, since it is the number of species in the community (Krebs, 

1999). It is also easy to use but, in the same as diverse indices, this index has a problem 

in the measurement, owing to it is often impossible to enumerate all of species in a natural 

community.  

Hence, in order to evaluate the diversity, richness and evenness of species in the 

diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus species, Shannon (H’), Margalef (R1) and Pielou (J’) 

indices were applied (Haidari et al., 2012) using PRIMER-E (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). 

In this study, the identified prey items were used to the calculation of each of these indices 

(Gonçalves, 2000). In addition to the comparison between sexes, maturity stages and 

seasons variables of each deep-water shark species an analysis based on these three 

diversity indices was also carried out. With the purpose to know the existence or absence 

of significant differences in the diet diversity by sexes, maturity stage and season for both 

deep-water shark species, the diversity values were tested by a non-parametric Mann-

Whitney Rank Sum Test.  

a)  Diversity Index (H’) 

The Shannon Index (H’) is the most common index used to quantify the specific 

biodiversity (Pla, 2006). This index shows the heterogeneity of a community by the 

following factors: number of species found and their relative abundance. Shannon Index 

(H’) is defined as: 

?? =  ?  (? ??  

?

?=1

???2 ?? ) 

Where H’ is the diversity in the stomach; n corresponds to the total number of 

species in the sample, and pi is the proportion of the species (i) in the stomach. 

Conceptually it is a measurement of the uncertainty level associated with the 

random selection of an individual in the community (Pla, 2006); i.e. if a community of 

species is highly heterogeneous, it is due to the existence of a clearly dominant species 

and the remaining species are scarcely present. The uncertainty level will be lower if all 

species are equally abundant. 

 



23 

 

b) Richness Index (R1) 

 To estimate the species richness in sampling units, the Margalef Index will be used 

(Gonçalves, 2000), which considers the numeric distribution of individuals for different 

species depending on the individual number existing in the analyzed sample. However, it 

does not consider the relative importance of species, because it is only based on the 

number of species found. The Margalef Index is calculated using the following equation 

(Gonçalves, 2000): 

?1 =  
? ? 1

ln(?)
 

Where S is the number of species and N is the total number of individuals. If the 

results of the richness index are near to 0, there is lower species richness and consequently 

the diversity in sampling units is also low. However, if its values are near to 1, the species 

richness is higher and thus the diversity of sampling units is high. 

c) Evenness index (J’) 

According to Magurran (1988), in order to know how the abundance data is 

distributed among the species, the Pielou’s evenness index was used. This index is based 

in the relationship between the observed diversity, such as Shannon’s diversity index 

(H’), and the maximum diversity (Hmax). The maximum diversity could occur when all 

species have the same abundance, in other words if H’= Hmax = ln S. Hence, the ratio of 

observed diversity to maximum diversity can be taken as a measure of evenness (E): 

? =
H?

Hmax
=

H?

ln S
 

The E value is within the range between 0 and 1, where the value of 1 represents 

a situation in which all species are equally abundant (Magurran, 1988).  

2.6. Multivariate statistical analyses 

The software PRIMER V6.0 (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological 

Research) was used for multivariate statistical analyses (Clarke and Gorley, 2006). These 

analyses were used to compare two or more samples which share particular species at a 

comparable level of abundance (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). In this case, this method 

was used to obtain information about the diet composition of E. spinax and E. pusillus, to 

compare their diets and to test the overall differences in general prey types. Comparisons 

were done through different tests such as CLUSTER, MDS and SIMPER and a statistical 

permutational test ANOSIM. 



24 

 

The starting point for many of the analyses is normally linked to the concept of 

similarity between samples, in terms of biological communities. There are many ways to 

define similarity, usually depending on the weight it has on different aspects of the 

community. In order to increase the abundance of minority species and adjust the 

similarity level of the communities, it is necessary to replace the original data matrix 

(species / samples) for a transformed data matrix. Therefore, in the present study, the 

statistical analyses of the samples will be performed with a fourth root of the original data 

matrix (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). The data matrix was formed by the most 

representative index, i.e. relative importance index corrected (IRIc). 

2.6.1. CLUSTER analysis 

In order to determine similarities and differences in the diet of E. spinax and E. 

pusillus, a matrix of similarities (calculated from original data matrix) between each pair 

of individuals was calculated using the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. This coefficient 

is necessary for the Cluster analysis and it was calculated with data transformed to fourth 

root. The aim of Cluster analysis is to find “natural groupings” of those samples that are 

more similar to each other within a group, than other samples in different groups. Samples 

are “mapped” in such a way that distances between pairs of samples show the relative 

dissimilarity of the species composition in the diet (Clarke and Warwick, 2001) 

2.6.2. Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS) 

The Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS) is a spatial representation 

technique which reflects the particular aspects of community structure (Clarke, 1993). 

The values were represented graphically on a map in order to analyse the similarity or 

dissimilarity in the diet of these two species according to the distance between each 

represented point on the multidimensional space. Thus, if the distance between two points 

is large, the diet composition will have a low similarity and if this distance is smaller, the 

similarity in the diet composition will be (Clarke and Warwick, 2001) 

2.6.3. ANOSIM analysis 

ANOSIM test is an analysis used to evaluate statistical differences in the diet 

composition between the elasmobranchs groups of E. spinax and E. pusillus and within 

each species in relation to sex, maturity state and season. This multivariate analysis 

(González et al., 2013) performs a null hypothesis of similarity of the parameters that 

describe the behaviour of the variables in the different species according to their type of 



25 

 

diet. The value of ANOSIM-R indicates the extent of the difference between groups (R &gt; 

0.75: well separated groups; R = 0.50-0.75: separated but overlapping groups; R = 0.25-

0.50: separated but strongly overlapping groups; and R &amp;lt;0.25: barely separated groups) 

(Pethybridge et al., 2011).  

2.6.4. SIMPER analysis 

The Similarity Percentage analysis (SIMPER) procedure was used in order to 

calculate the value of similarity (Krebs, 1999) according to the main species of both 

elasmobranch diets depending on different parameters (sex, maturity state and season) 

(Fanelli et al., 2009). Each community sample must be standardized in terms of 

percentages, so the relative abundances reach 100% in each sample. So it is possible to 

know what prey is typical of the diet depending on the degree of similarity in the 

dendrogram, and thus it is possible to identify the main prey taxon. (Krebs, 1999).

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Etmopterus spinax (Linnaeus, 1758) 

3.1.1. Representativeness of the sample 

The representativeness of the sample was obtained from the relationship between 

the cumulative number of prey species and cumulative number of stomachs with content 

of E. spinax (n=97). The cumulative prey curves described an increasing relationship 

which reached asymptotic stabilization with approximately 59 stomachs analyzed and 22 

species of prey, where the sample starts to be representative. (Fig. 3.1).  

 

Figure 3.1: Relationship between cumulative number of prey species identified in the stomach contents 

and cumulative number of stomachs analyzed of E. spinax. 

3.1.2. General composition of the diet 

In the feeding study of E. spinax 173 stomachs were considered, of which 76 

stomachs were empty, resulting in a vacuity index of 43.9%, regarding the total number 

of stomachs. The average number of prey per stomach was 1.6 with an average weight of 

1.16 g. The percentages for stomachs filled with unidentified bulk and with sediments 

(sand and mud) regarding the total number of stomachs, were obtained: 19.1% and ~11%, 

respectively, resulting in 97 stomachs with contents for further analysis.  

In the stomach contents of E. spinax, 19 different prey species were identified. 

They belong to three groups of prey - cephalopods, crustaceans and fish - in which 

different prey items were identified (9, 5 and 5, respectively) (Tab. 3.1). The rest of prey 

items were considered as unidentified items. The systematic classification of all prey 

items are represented in the Annexes 1, 2 and 3.  

The quantitative indices (%N, %W, %FO and %IRI) of the three main groups of 

prey were taken into account to represent the diet of E. spinax. The crustaceans were the 

most representative group in terms of IRI (70.3%), %N (70%) and %FO (54.4%). In terms 

of %W, the fish were the most representative group (46%), followed by the cephalopods

3.1.2.1. Prey classifications 

The indices calculated for the diet of E. spinax were pooled into different groups 

according to the order of importance for each type of prey and, in this case, three groups 

were obtained for each index. The first group (G.I) consisted in the IRI index and the 

second one (G.II) was composed by the IPO2 index. According to the different indices 

analysis it was possible to verify that the main prey items in the diet of E. spinax were the 

Suborder (SbO) Natantia, N.i. Fish, N.i. Ceph and N.i. Crust (Tab. 3.2).

N.i.: Not identified 

When applying the classification of prey by IRI values according to Rosecchi and 

Nouaze (1987), it can be observed that the G.I followed the same ranking as the normal 

order (Tab. 3.2) without variations, i.e., SbO. Natantia which is the 1st in the ranking 

order is the preferential prey, N.i. Fish in the 2nd rank is the secondary prey and the rest 

of prey are accessory prey (Tab. 3.3) (Annex 30).

Using the classification of prey by IPO2 index it was observed that G.II showed a 

similar pattern of G.I (Tab. 3.2). According to this classification it was possible to verify 

that from 2 preferential prey, the SbO. Natantia (27.5%) and N.i. Fish (27.37%). 

Regarding secondary prey, N.i. Ceph (8.52%) and N.i. Crust (6.73%) were the most 

relevant secondary prey. Sepia orbignyana (3.33%) was the most representative of the 

other prey items (Tab. 3.4) (Annex 31).

3.1.2.2. Diversity indices 

Concerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition of E. 

spinax was possible to observe that this species present similar and very low values of 

each index, some of them near 0 and other being 0. Therefore resulting values of 0.3 ± 

0.47; 0.5 ± 0.72 and 0.4 ± 0.45 for diversity, richness and evenness indices, respectively.  

3.1.3. Relationship between sex and diet composition 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of E. spinax species only 

the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. The IRI index 

was used because it combines all quantitative indices (N, FO, and W) that while giving 

more importance to the frequency of occurrence, it also discriminates better between 

values of the index allowing an effective evaluation of the importance of each type of 

prey to predator diet. 

The vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and 

sediment obtained for the sex variable of this species was calculated, taking into account 

the total number of stomachs of each sex. These results are shown in the following table 

(Tab. 3.5).

Females 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet composition for the female 

specimens of E. spinax and taking into account the empty stomachs, 51 stomach were 

analyzed. Considering the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 7), it is possible to verify 

that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in the diet of the 

Velvet belly females, representing 74.6% in terms of IRI. Decapods were the crustacean 

prey items which contributed most to IRI (72.6%) (Fig. 3.7) (Annex 19).

Males 

For the relationship between sex and diet for the male specimens of E. spinax and 

considering the empty stomachs, 46 stomachs were analyzed. According to the 

quantitative analysis (Annex 8), crustaceans were the main component in the diet of 

Velvet belly male specimens and in terms of IRI (62.7%), as in the case of females, the 

decapods was the prey items which contributed most to IRI (56.5%) (Fig. 3.8) (Annex 

20).

3.1.3.1. Diversity indices 

Concerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition 

between sexes for E. spinax species, was possible to observe that both females and males 

present similar and low values of each index. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.6 ± 

0.75 for female and 0.6 ± 0.72 for male specimens. In addition, the values obtained of 

species richness for females and males were 0.6 ± 0.75 and 0.6 ± 0.72, respectively. 

Finally, in case of species evenness, the values obtained were 0.4 ± 0.46 for females and 

0.4 ± 0.48 for males. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a 

statistically significant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed 

p-values:  p = 0.624, p = 0.820 and p = 0.853. 

3.1.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis: 

The classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items 

found in the diet of both sexes (female and male) of E. spinax specimens indicated that, 

at the 17% similarity level, the 97 specimens’ combination (only specimens with prey 

items into the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters were 

isolated. The main six groups of clusters were composed of different combinations 

between both sexes of E. spinax specimens. The last two groups (isolated clusters) 

consisted in two mature males captured in summer (Fig. 3.9). 

 

Figure 3.9: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the 

diet for both sexes of E. spinax specimens. The eight groups defined at similarity level of 17% are indicated 

by the dashed line. (   : A, B and C). 



35 

 

The result of MDS analysis also corresponds to the main five groups of 

CLUSTERS analysis. For this analysis it is important to note that the isolated clusters 

were not taken into account, because in these specimens were only found one prey item 

with very low weight. Hence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with 

high percentage of similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.07, which 

indicates a good representation of the ordination in a plane (2D) (Fig. 3.10). 

In addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not significant 

differences in the diet composition of both sexes of E. spinax specimens (ANOSIM test, 

R= -0.005, p &gt; 0.05).

five groups defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the dashed line. 

 



36 

 

Concerning to SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average 

contribution of the prey items to the similarity in the diet of both sexes of E. spinax 

specimens were 35.40% for females and 34.11% for male specimens. In terms of relative 

importance, SbO. Natantia and N.i. Fish were the prey items most responsible for the 

similarity in the diet between both sexes of E. spinax. For female specimens the 

contribution percentages of SbO. Natantia and N.i. Fish were 67.04% and 25.92%, 

respectively, and for male specimens were 81.40% and 11.85%, respectively (Tab. 3.6).

3.1.4. Relationship between maturity and diet: 

In the analysis of the relationship between maturity stages and diet of each deep-

water shark species only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in 

this study. The IRI index was used due to its adequate combination of quantitative indices 

(N, FO and W) and better discrimination power. 

The vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and 

sediment obtained for the maturity variable of this species was calculated, taking into 

account the total number of stomachs of each maturity for each sex are shown in the 

following table (Tab. 3.7).

Immature females 

In the analysis of the relationship between maturity and diet for the immature 

female specimens of E. spinax and taking into account the empty stomachs, 30 stomachs 

were analyzed. Regarding the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 9), it is possible to 

verify that crustaceans, in respect to all indices, are the most abundant and important 

group of prey in the diet of the E. spinax immature females. In addition, in terms of IRI, 

the decapods were the crustacean prey items which contributed most (67.1%) (Fig. 3.11) 

(Annex 21).

Mature females 

In the case of the analysis of the relationship between maturity and diet for the 

mature female specimens of E. spinax and considering the empty stomachs, 21 stomachs 

were analyzed. Concerning the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 10), it is possible to 

verify that crustaceans are also, by far, the most abundant and important group of prey in 

the diet of the E. spinax mature females. Decapods were the crustacean prey items which 

contributed most to IRI (73.4%) (Fig. 3.12) (Annex 22).

analyzed. As regard the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 11), it is possible to verify 

that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey, by far, in the diet of 

the E. spinax immature males. In terms of IRI, the decapods were the crustacean prey 

items which most contributed to this index, with a value of 87.3% (Fig. 3.13) (Annex 

23).

In the analysis of the relationship between maturity and diet for the mature male 

specimens of E. spinax and considering the empty stomachs, 23 stomachs were analyzed. 

Concerning the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 12), it is possible to verify that fish 

are the most abundant and important group of prey in the diet of the E. spinax mature 

males. Furthermore, the N.i. Fish were the fish prey items which contributed most to IRI 

(60%) (Fig. 3.14) (Annex 24).

3.1.4.1. Diversity indices 

Regarding the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition 

between maturity stages for E. spinax species, was possible to observe that both immature 

and mature specimens present similar and very low values of each index. Thus resulting 

diversity values of 0.3 ± 0.46 for immature and 0.4 ± 0.47 for mature specimens. In the 

same way happened with the values of richness of species, obtaining of 0.4 ± 0.68 for 

immature and 0.6 ± 0.75 for mature specimens. Finally, in case of species evenness, the 

values obtained were 0.3 ± 0.43 for immature and 0.5 ± 0.47 for mature specimens. The 

Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a statistically significant 

differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed p-values  p = 0.131, p = 

0.107 and p = 0.055. 

3.1.4.2. Multivariate statistical analysis 

The classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items 

found in the diet of immature and mature specimens of E. spinax indicated that, at the 

17% similarity level, the 97 specimens’ combination (only specimens with prey items 

into the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters were isolated. 

The main six groups of clusters were composed of different combinations between both 

maturity stages of E. spinax specimens. The two isolated clusters consisted in two mature 

males captured in summer (Fig. 3.15). 

 

Figure 3.15: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the 

diet for both maturity stages of E. spinax specimens. The eight groups defined at similarity level of 17% 

are indicated by the dashed line.

The result of MDS analysis corresponds to the first five group of CLUSTERS 

analysis. In addition it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into 

account, because in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. 

Hence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of 

similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.07, which indicates a good 

representation of the ordination in a 2-dimensional graphic (Fig. 3.16).

The main five groups defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the 

dashed line. 
 

 



41 

 

Furthermore, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not  differences 

between the diet composition of immature and mature specimens of E. spinax, although 

the p value is less than 0.05 (ANOSIM test, R=0.05, p&lt;0.05). This fact mean that there is 

a great variability in the diet composition between both maturity stages of E. spinax. 

 Regarding SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average contribution 

of the prey items to the dissimilarity in the diet between both maturity stages of E. spinax 

specimens was 66.74%. In terms of relative importance SbO. Natantia (29.26%), N.i. Fish 

(24.38%) and N.i. Cephalopods (N.i. Ceph) (12.73%) were the prey items most 

responsible for the dissimilarity in the diet between immature and mature specimens of 

E. spinax. In addition the differences in the IRI average of the most contributors prey 

items in the diet are very consistent between both immature and mature specimens (Tab. 

3.8). 

Table 3.8: SIMPER results for the relative importance of prey items between immature (Imat) and mature 

(Mat) specimens of E. spinax. Parameters include: average contribution to relative importance (Av. IRI) 

and to dissimilarity (Av. Diss), dissimilarity/standard deviation (Diss/SD), contribution of the dominant 

species to the dissimilarity % (Contrib%) and cumulative dissimilarity % (Cum.%).

3.1.5. Relationship between season and diet 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of each deep-water shark 

species only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. 

The IRI index was used due to its apropriate combination of quantitative indices (N, FO 

and W) and better discrimination capacity. 

The vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk and 

sediment obtained in the stomachs of this species according to the season variable was 

calculated, taking into account the total number of stomachs of each season category (hot 

season and cold season). These results are shown in the following table (Tab. 9).

Hot season 

For the analysis of the relationship between seasons and diet for the specimens of 

E. spinax in hot seasons (spring and summer), considering the empty stomachs, 65 

stomachs were analyzed. Concerning the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 13), it is 

possible to verify that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in 

the diet of the E. pusillus during hot season. Furthermore, the decapods were the 

crustacean prey items most contributors, with IRI value of 66.5% (Fig. 3.16) (Annex 25).

importance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of E. spinax specimens in hot season (N=65). 

Cold season 

For the analysis of the relationship between seasons and diet for the specimens of 

E. spinax in cold seasons (winter and autumn) and taking account the empty stomachs, 

32 stomachs were analyzed. Regarding the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 14), it is 

possible to verify that crustaceans are the most abundant and important group of prey in 

the diet of the E. spinax during cold season, also the contribution to IRI index of 

Sepiolidae prey item was very low (0.09%). Decapods were the crustacean prey items 

which contributed most to IRI (63.7%) (Fig. 3.17) (Annex 26).

3.1.5.1. Diversity indices 

Regarding the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition 

between two different season categories (hot and cold seasons) for E. spinax species, was 

possible to observe that the values of both season categories presented, for each index, 

almost the same values and also very low. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.3 ± 0.48 

for hot season and 0.3 ± 0.43 for cold season. Furthermore, the values obtained of species 

richness for hot season were 0.5 ± 0.74, whereas for cold season were 0.5 ± 0.66. Finally, 

in case of species evenness, the values obtained were 0.4 ± 0.46 and 0.4 ± 0.45 for hot 

and cold season, respectively. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were 

not a statistically significant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the 

followed p-values  p = 0.062, p = 0.107 and p = 0.952. 

3.1.5.2. Multivariate statistical analysis 

The classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items 

found in the specimens diet of E. spinax in spring, summer, winter and autumn indicated 

that, at the 17% similarity level, the 97 specimens’ combination (only specimens with 

prey items into the stomachs) falls into eight groups of clusters, of which two clusters 

were isolated. These clusters consisted in two mature males captured in summer (Fig. 

3.18).  

The result of MDS analysis corresponds to the first five groups of CLUSTERS 

analysis. Furthermore it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into 

account, because in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. 

Hence it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of 

similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.07, which indicates a good 

ordination with less misrepresentative interpretation (Fig. 3.19).

similarity level of 17% are indicated by the dashed line. (   : A, B, C and D). 

Furthermore, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not significant 

differences between the diet composition of E. spinax specimens captured during both 

season categories (ANOSIM test, R=0.044, p &gt; 0.05).  

Concerning the SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the averages 

contribution of the prey items to the similarity in the diet of E. spinax specimens captured 

during hot and cold seasons were 38.79% and 26.29%, respectively. In terms of relative 

importance SbO. Natantia and N.i. Fish were the main prey items that contributed to the 

similarity during hot season. Nevertheless during cold season the main prey items with 

high contribution to the similarity were SbO. Natantia (SbO.Natn), N.i. Fish and P. sivado 

(PasipSiv) (Tab. 3.10).

3.2.1. Representativeness of the sample 

The curve obtained from the relationship between the cumulative number of prey 

species and cumulative number of stomachs with analyzed content of E. pusillus (n=32). 

The cumulative prey curves also described an increasing relationship, but in this case did 

not reach a full asymptotic stabilization (Fig. 3.20). This could be to the fact that the 

stomachs amount of E. pusillus may not have been sufficient to describe the overall 

trophic diversity in the diet of this species.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3.20: Relationship between cumulative number of prey species identified in the stomachs content 

and cumulative number of stomachs analyzed of E. pusillus.  

3.2.2. General composition of the diet 

For the feeding study of E. pusillus 58 stomachs were considered of which 26 

stomachs were found to be empty, resulting in a vacuity index of 44.8%, regarding the 

total number of stomachs. The average number of prey per stomach was 1.15 with an 

average weight of 0.72 g. In addition, 57% of the stomachs were filled with unidentified 

bulk, resulting in x stomachs with contents for further analysis.  

In the stomach contents of E. pusillus 10 different prey species were identified. 

They belong to the same three groups of prey found for E. spinax - cephalopods, 

crustaceans and fish - in which also different prey items were identified (3, 5 and 2, 

respectively) (Tab. 3.11) The rest of prey items found they were composed by 

unidentified items. The systematic classification of all prey items are represented in the 

Annexes 1, 2 and 3.

Regarding the diet of E. pusillus, the quantitative indices (%N, %W, %FO and 

IRI) for the three main groups of prey were taken into account. In terms of IRI, %N and 

%FO, the most representative group was the crustaceans (50.4%, 59.7% and 53.5%, 

respectively) and in terms of %W the most representative group was the fish (76.1%). 

The cephalopods group was the least representative of all main groups of prey regarding 

all indices (Fig. 3.21) (Annex 15).

According to the numerical method, 67 prey were counted. The most important 

prey group in the diet of E. pusillus were the crustaceans (59.7%), being the Euphausiacea 

(26.9%) and the Decapoda orders (25.4%) the most abundant, followed by the fish group

Regarding the gravimetric method, the total weight obtained from all prey was 

41.68 g. The most representative group of prey was the fish (76.1%), in which the N.i. 

Fish contributed to the largest proportion (75.9%). The next most abundant group in terms 

of weight was the crustaceans (18.1%), of which 10.3% corresponded to the decapods. 

Cephalopods remains the least representative group in terms of %W (5.9%) mainly 

represented by N.i. Ceph (5.5%) (Fig. 3.23) (Annex 15).

In terms of frequency of occurrence (%FO), the most frequent group were the 

crustaceans (53.5%), mostly represented by the decapods (34.8%). The fish group was 

less frequent (37.2%), 32.6% of which corresponding to N.i. Fish. The least frequent 

group was the cephalopods (9.3%), where the N.i. Ceph and the Oegopsida order had the 

same frequency of occurrence (6.5%) (Fig. 3.24) (Annex 15).

Regarding the relative importance index (IRI), the crustaceans and fish groups 

were nearly of equal importance (50% and 48%, respectively). However, the most 

important prey was the N.i. Fish (67%), followed by the decapods (25%). The least 

important group as a whole was the cephalopods (2%), with the N.i. Ceph (1.3%) and the 

order Oegopsida (0.8%) as prey items contributors (Fig. 3.25) (Annex 15).

3.2.2.1. Prey classifications 

As happened for E. spinax, the indices calculated for the diet of E. pusillus were 

divided into different groups according to the order of importance for each type of prey, 

obtaining also three groups for each index. The first group (G.I) consisted in the IRI index, 

and the second one (G.II) was composed by the IPO2 index (Tab. 3.12). 

In respect to the different indices analysis it was possible to verify that the 

principal preys in the diet of E. pusillus were the N.i. Fish group, SbO. Natantia and O. 

Euphausiacea. The groups of indices are fairly homogenous until 3th category, where 

these groups begin to have slight variations according to the principal order. Both groups 

(G.I and G.II) were similar in terms of main order (Tab. 3.12).

When applying the classification of prey by IRI values according to Rosecchi and 

Nouaze (1987), it can be observed that the G.I followed the same ranking as the main 

order (Tab. 3.13) without variations, i.e., N.i. Fish, the 1st in the ranking order, is the 

preferential prey, SbO. Natantia ranking 2nd is already an accessory prey, being the O. 

Euphausiacea the next prey item which presented a higher percentage (5.1%) (Tab. 3.12) 

(Annex 32).

3.2.2.2. Diversity indices 

Concerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition of E. 

pusillus was possible to observe that this species present similar and very low values of 

each index, some of them near 0 and other being 0. Therefore resulting values of 0.2 ± 

0.39; 0.4 ± 0.68 and 0.3 ± 0.45 for diversity, richness and evenness indices, respectively. 

3.2.3. Relationship between sex and diet 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet of each deep-water shark 

species only the index of relative importance (IRI) was taken into account in this study. 

The IRI index was used because it combines all quantitative indices (N, FO, and W) that 

while giving more importance to the frequency of occurrence, it also discriminates better 

between values of the index allowing an effective evaluation of the importance of each 

type of prey to predator diet. 

The vacuity index (VI) and the different percentages of unidentified bulk obtained 

for the sex variable of E. pusillus was calculated, taking into account the total number of 

stomachs of each sex. These results are shown in the following table (Tab. 3.15).

Females 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet for the female specimens 

of E. pusillus and considering the empty stomachs, 7 stomachs were analyzed. 

Considering the overall quantitative analysis (Annex 16), it is possible to verify that both 



52 

 

crustaceans and fish are the most abundant and important group of prey in the diet of the 

Smooth Lanternshark females. In terms of IRI, these groups of prey represented 44.1% 

and 50.8%. Decapoda and Euphausiacea orders were the crustaceans prey items which 

contributed most to IRI (5.5% and 11%, respectively) and also the N.i. Fish (IRI=72.8%) 

(Fig. 3.26) (Annex 28). 

 
Figure 3.26: Representation of the quantitative methods of the main groups of prey (left) and the relative 

importance (IRI) of prey items (right) in the diet of the female specimens of E. pusillus (N=7). 

Males 

In the analysis of the relationship between sex and diet for the male specimens of 

E. pusillus and taking into account the empty stomachs, 25 stomachs was analyzed. 

According to the quantitative analysis (Annex 17), crustaceans were the main component 

in the diet of Smooth Lanternshark male specimens. The prey items of crustaceans which 

contributed most to IRI were the decapods (39.9%), but the N.i. Fish had also an elevated 

relative importance (55.7%) (Fig. 3.27) (Annex 29).

3.2.3.1. Diversity indices 

Concerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition 

between sexes for E. pusillus species, was possible to observe that both females and males 

present low values of each index. Hence resulting diversity values of 0.5 ± 0.59 for female 

and 0.2 ± 0.31 for male specimens. In addition, the values obtained of species richness 

for females and males were 0.7 ± 0.94 and 0.4 ± 0.61, respectively. Finally, in case of 

species evenness, the values obtained were 0.5 ± 0.50 for females and 0.2 ± 0.42 for 

males. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test showed that there were not a statistically 

significant differences between sexes for any index, obtaining the followed p-values  p = 

0.143, p = 0.224 and p = 0.111. 

3.2.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis 

The classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items 

found in the diet of female and male specimens of E. pusillus indicated that, at the 17% 

similarity level, the 32 specimens’ combination (only specimens with prey items into the 

stomachs) falls into four groups of clusters, of which three clusters were isolated. The 

main group of clusters was composed of different combinations between both sexes of E. 

spinax specimens. The last three isolated groups of clusters consisted in two immature 

males captured in spring and one immature female capture in spring (Fig. 3.28) 

 

Figure 3.28: Dendogram representation obtained by CLUSTERS analysis of the relative importance in the 

diet for both sexes of E. pusillus specimens. The four groups defined at similarity level of 17% are indicated 

by the dashed line. 

The result of MDS analysis corresponds to the main group of CLUSTERS 

analysis. Then it is important to note that the isolated clusters were not taken into account, 

because in these specimens were only found one prey item with very low weight. Hence

it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with high percentage of similarity. 

The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.08, which indicates a good 

representation of the ordination in a 2D graphic (Fig. 3.29).

group defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the dashed line. 
 

In addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are not significant 

differences in the diet composition of female and males specimens of E. pusillus 

(ANOSIM test, R=0.021, p &gt; 0.05).  

Concerning to SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average 

contribution of the prey items to the similarity in the diet of both sexes of E. pusillus 

specimens were 28.56% for females and 39.97% for male specimens. In terms of relative 

importance, N.i. Crustaceans, N.i. Fish and SbO. Natantia were the prey items most 

responsible for the similarity in the diet between females and males of E. pusillus. In the 

case of female specimens, the contribution percentages of N.i. Crustaceans, N.i. Fish and 



55 

 

SbO. Natantia were 50.40%, 34.19% and 11.84%, respectively, and for male specimens 

were 56.02%, 25.12% and 12.73%, respectively (Tab. 3.16).

3.3. Comparison Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus pusillus 

Regarding the comparison between both diets, and in terms of feeding overlap, it 

was verified that the diet of both shark species are subjected to a high level of overlap, 

obtaining values above ?=0.6. The overlap values obtained for the %N, %W, %FOc and 

IRIc indices were ?=0.64, ?=0.60, ?=0.62, ?= 0.53, respectively.  

 Concerning the position in the trophic chain, the trophic levels of each deep-water 

shark was calculated. Therefore, values of 3.8 for E. spinax and 4.1 for E. pusillus were 

obtained.  

3.3.1. Diversity 

Concerning the results obtained of species diversity in the diet composition 

between both deep-water sharks species, was possible to observe that all indices present 

low values for each predator species, obtaining the following results. In case of the 

diversity index, the value obtained for E. spinax was somewhat higher (0.3 ± 0.47) than 

for E. pusillus (0.2 ± 0.39). In addition, the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was calculated 

and there was not a statistically significant difference (P = 0.451). 

On the other hand, similar values with the richness of species were observed in 

both diets. Thus the values of average and standard deviation obtained for E. spinax were 

0.5 ± 0.72, while the values for E. pusillus were 0.4 ± 0.68. Hence, there was not a 

statistically significant difference (P = 0.573) in the species richness values for both diets. 



56 

 

According the species evenness index (J’), the values of average and standard 

deviation obtained for E. spinax were 0.4 ± 0.45, while the values for E. pusillus were 0.3 

± 0.45. Then, there was not statistically significant difference (P = 0.864) in the species 

evenness index values for both diets.  

3.3.2. Multivariate statistical analysis 

The classification of the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the prey items 

found in the diet of both Etmopterus species indicated that, at the 17% similarity level, 

the 129 specimens’ combination (only specimens with prey items into the stomachs) falls 

into eight main groups or clusters, of which four clusters was isolated. Two of the main 

clusters consisted of the E. spinax specimens, another cluster was formed by E. spinax 

(n=7) and E. pusillus (n=1; immature female captured in spring) specimens and the third 

one was composed of different combinations between both deep-water shark species. The 

first and third clusters isolated consisted in one specimen of E. spinax in each one (both 

corresponded to mature male specimens captured in summer), the second one and the 

fourth one cluster consisted in one specimen of E. pusillus in each one (2nd: immature 

female captured in spring and 4th: immature male captured in spring) (Fig. 3.30). 

The result of MDS analysis also corresponds to the first four groups of 

CLUSTERS analysis. For this analysis it is important to note that the isolated clusters 

were not taken into account, so it was done the MDS subset in the groups of clusters with 

high percentage of similarity. The stress value obtained for the MDS plot was 0.08, which 

indicates a good 2D ordination with less probabilities of misrepresentative interpretation 

(Fig. 3.31).

the diet of E. spinax and E. pusillus specimens. The eight groups defined at similarity level of 17% are 

indicated by the dashed line. (   : A, B, C, D and E). 



57 

 

In addition, the ANOSIM statistical analysis shows that there are slight differences 

between the diet composition of both E. spinax and E. pusillus, but these differences are 

significant (ANOSIM test, R=0. 156, p &amp;lt;0.05).

four groups defined at similarity level of 17% with superimposed clusters are indicated by the dashed line. 
 

Concerning to SIMPER analysis, it is possible to observe that the average 

contribution of the prey items to the dissimilarity in the diet between both deep-water 

species of sharks was 74.82%. In terms of relative importance N.i. Crustaceans (N.i. 

Crust) (25.87%), SbO. Natantia (SbO. Natn) (23.08%) and N.i. Fish (20.89%) were the 

prey items most responsible for the dissimilarity in the diet between both deep-water 

shark species. In addition the differences in the IRI average are very consistent between 

both deep-water shark species for most contributors prey items in their diets (Tab. 3.17).

4. DISCUSSION 

This research is focused on the diet study of two species of small deep-water 

sharks, the Velvet belly (Etmopterus spinax) and Smooth lanternshark (Etmopterus 

pusillus), along the Algarve coast and taking into account different variables (sex, 

maturity stage and season), which influence diet composition of both species.  

Despite the considerable number of samples of E. spinax, the number of stomachs 

analysed from E. pusillus was lower and come from different times of sampling and for 

this reason, a comprehensive analysis of the presented results should be done with 

caution.  

4.1. General diet composition  

In the northeast Atlantic, especially along the Algarve coast, the diets of E. spinax 

and E. pusillus are based primarily on organisms with pelagic and demersal affinities, 

such as crustaceans, teleost fish and cephalopods. The present study is in accordance with 

Xavier et al. (2006), who analyzed the diet composition of deep-water shark species and 

found that Etmopterus spp. feed primarily on crustaceans, fish and cephalopods. 

Moreover, a significant component of their diets are organisms with diel vertical 

migrations such as Pasiphaea sivado and euphausiids, but others showing demersal 

distribution (e.g.  Micromesistius poutassou) were also observed (Neiva et al., 2006; 

Xavier et al., 2012). Pelagic organisms represent one of the main food sources for many 

demersal communities (Mauchline et al., 1991 in Xavier et al., 2012; Blaber et al., 2002). 

Thereby, according to Neiva et al. (2006), Sims et al. (2006) and Xavier et al. (2012), it 

can be suggested that E. spinax and E. pusillus could perform vertical feeding migrations, 

which is a common behavior in sharks. However, it is important to note that further 

evidences are required to confirm this behavior pattern in the genus Etmopterus (Xavier 

et al., 2012).  

 Regarding the diet composition of both deep-water sharks species studied it is 

interesting to point out that usually all species of prey consumed by E. spinax and E. 

pusillus are bioluminescent (Neiva et al., 2006). Therefore it is possible that these 

predators have a visual adaption that plays an important role in detecting and capturing 

this type of prey, as referred to by Neiva et al. (2006). 

In terms of relative importance (IRI), crustaceans were the main group in the diet 

of E. spinax (IRI=70.3%), particularly representatives of the Order Decapoda, followed 

by teleost fishes (IRI=22.2%) and cephalopods (IRI=7.4%). Decapods were dominant 



61 

 

both in number (44.6%), frequency of occurrence (42.9%) and relative importance 

(67.1%), but fishes (mainly unidentified) were the most abundant in terms of weight 

(40.5%): these results are consistent with values reported by Costa et al. (2002). In the 

same way, concerning the relative importance of prey found in the E. pusillus diet, it was 

observed that crustaceans and fishes were the principal groups of prey (IRI=50.4% and 

47.8%, respectively), (particularly the decapods (25.1%)), followed by cephalopods 

(IRI=1.8%). The similar importance to both groups (crustaceans and fish) in the diet could 

be due to the fact that composition diet of E. pusillus varies according to different factors, 

such as the need to consume preys which provide the highest amount of energy possible, 

as long as these prey are available. In addition, in respect to the taxonomic orders, the 

Order Euphausiacea dominated in terms of numbers (26.9%), whilst the unidentified fish 

group was the most relevant in terms of weight and relative importance (%W=75.9% and 

IRI=66.7%).  

Regarding the Relative Importance Index (IRI), and according to Clarke et al. 

(1995), it is important to note that the determination of relative importance for 

cephalopods and fish in the diets can raise some problems. The identification of 

cephalopods and fishes from remaining hard structures (beaks and otoliths) can be 

complicated and, most of the times, does not allows a reliable identification of the prey. 

In contrast, identification of crustaceans present in the gut is facilitated by the fact that 

their structures remain almost intact. Consequently, IRI values obtained for fish and 

cephalopods were low (and underestimated), due to the weight of the hard structures 

being very low (0.01 g approximately), influencing the index final estimations.  

In contrast with other studies (Neiva et al., 2006; Valls et al., 2011), in this 

research the diet of E. spinax was not dominated by teleost fish, such as Micromesistius 

poutassou (IRI=0.01%), nor by cephalopods such as Sepiolids (IRI=0.4%). Moreover the 

previous two preys were absented in the diet of E. pusillus. Nevertheless, the fish group 

had an important contribution in terms of weight for both deep-water species, 40% for E. 

spinax and 76% for E. pusillus, particularly with unidentified fish. This is in accordance 

with what was reported by Bergstad et al. (2003) in their study. In addition, there are three 

main factors that suggest that E. pusillus species feeds intermittently, in accordance with 

the study carried out by Xavier et al. (2012): the frequent observation of a limited amount 

of food items in their stomachs, the presence of many prey in advanced digestion stages, 

and the high number of empty stomachs (overall vacuity index=44.8%).  



62 

 

Otherwise the benthic organisms such as reptantid decapods, polychaetes and 

echinoderms were not part in the diet of both species studied, except the Order 

Pleuronectiformes with a %FO of 3% in E. spinax and 2% in E. pusillus, respectively. 

Furthermore, an 11% of sediment (%FO) was found in the stomach contents of E. spinax. 

Usually, the ingestion of small amounts of sediment can suggest that this species is also 

foraged near the bottom (Costa et al., 2002). In contrast, sediments were not found in the 

stomach contents of E. pusillus. Thus, these results suggests that E. pusillus feeds mainly 

on benthopelagic prey, as suggested Neiva et al. (2006), but also prey with epibenthic 

affinities. 

Concerning the statistical analysis used to know the existence of significant 

differences, the ANOSIM test showed that there were slight different in the diet 

compositions between both species of deep-water sharks, and these differences were 

significant. These differences could be related with the more importance the fish species 

have in the E. pusillus diet and with the differences in feeding behaviour raised above. 

On the other hand, the results obtained in this study about the diet overlap between 

E. spinax and E. pusillus indicated that, despite the existence of slight differences in their 

feeding habits, the diet overlap was high (? &gt; 0.6). This index was estimated in order to 

understand how species that utilize common resources, such as food or space, coexist. 

This fact is due to that each species in a community has a determined position in the 

trophic chain, including its use of food resources, activity time, location, form of 

interaction with other species, among other factors (Ludwing and Reynolds, 1988). 

Regarding the trophic level, the values obtained for these species are in agreement with 

Cortés (1999), where both species are in the same trophic level, corresponding TL= 3.8 

(E. spinax) and TL= 4.1 (E. pusillus). Furthermore, their trophic level values are similar 

to the values obtained for species with the same distribution, such as Etmopterus princeps 

(TL= 4.2), Scyliorhinus canicula (TL= 3.6) and Galeus melastomus (TL= 3.7) (Cortés, 

1999), being this fact probably related with their benthopelagic life style. Cortés (1999) 

and Neiva et al. (2006) stated that the body length and trophic level were moderately 

correlated, suggesting that larger species have a higher trophic level than smaller species, 

due to larger species can also consume cetaceans and other elasmobranchs. In the same 

way, Gamito et al. (2005) suggested for species, such as Spondyliosoma cantharus and 

Sparus auratus, that the elevated trophic level can be related with the consumed amount 

of teleost fish. Hence, and according to those authors, the species with a diet rich in teleost 

have a higher trophic level values than species with a poor diet in teleost.  



63 

 

The degree of overlap found in the diets of both deep-water shark species can 

indicate competition or resource partitioning. Results presented in this study allowed 

observing that both species use the same feeding resources, although in different 

proportions. In the case of E. spinax the preferential prey was the crustacean group, 

specifically the Natantia order. However, the preferential prey for E. pusillus was the fish 

group, specifically the N.i. Fish. This can indicate a resource partitioning between both 

shark species. Preliminary analysis (in progress and unpublished) of the stable isotopic 

composition of carbon and nitrogen in muscle of E. spinax and E. pusillus support feeding 

overlap but different foraging strategies, providing further evidence of resource 

partitioning among these species. Moreover, this fact can also suggest that both deep-

water shark species feeding on locally abundant resources off the Algarve coast (Xavier 

et al., 2012). Here the Euphausiids, P. sivado and M. poutassou are key taxa in the 

regional marine food web (Santos et al., 2001). The variation of the diets can be related 

to the abundance or scarcity of food, so the description of their feeding ecology just 

present a momentary image of available resources during the performance of this study.  

When compared with other studies it could be seen that in the present study there 

were a lower number of prey items, namely consumed by E. pusillus (10 vs 26 prey taxa, 

Xavier et al., 2012) and by E. spinax (19 vs 29 prey taxa Neiva et al. 2006).  However, 

the values of diversity, richness and evenness obtained for the diets of E. spinax and E. 

pusillus, were low and very similar (E. spinax H’= 0.3; R1= 0.5; J’= 0.4 and E. pusillus 

H’=0.2; R1= 0.4; J’= 0.3).  One reason of obtaining low values of species diversity, 

richness and evenness in their diets can be associated to the low number of specimens 

caught for the analysis, as was in case of E. pusillus, and/or the advanced stage of 

digestion of many of the prey items that did not allow identification to the species level 

for some taxonomic groups.  

The diversity and richness of items consumed is indicative of the ecological 

specialization of their predators, particularly being designated as specialist, opportunist 

or generalist feeders. Lower values of these indices suggest that this predator species 

might have a strict diet, i.e it is relatively specialist, while higher values suggest a possible 

generalist diet, where the predator shows a rich and diverse consumption of prey 

available. Also, the low values of species evenness in their diets can suggest that the prey 

items consumed have not a uniformly distribution in their diets. Moreover, it is important 

to note that, as mentioned by Mauchline &amp;amp; Gordon (1985), the diversity indices applied 



64 

 

to the feeding ecology have a high degree of subjectivity. For this reasons, the results here 

presented should be interpreted with caution.  

The ecological specialization can be assigned from the diagram (Fig. 4.1) adapted 

from Costello (1990), which suggests that E. spinax and E. pusillus have a specialist diet, 

also reported in Neiva et al. (2006) and Xavier et al. (2012), and eventually opportunistic 

diet. Despite the observations, allowed by the stomach content analysis, are not entirely 

conclusive, one can assume that the studied sharks are not generalist-feeders. It is 

important to note that the differences in the proportions of the diversity values in respect 

to several authors, it may be due to the quantitative and qualitative variations in the 

benthic and ichthyologic populations to the local study, in this case the coast of Algarve.  

 

Figure 4.1: Explanatory diagram of the proposed method of diet analysis by Costello (1990). 

Xavier et al. (2012) recorded that the vacuity index may be related with the fishing 

gear used and its selectivity. Usually the specimens caught by trawling have fuller 

stomachs than those caught by longline. In the case of longline captures the specimens 

are hooked on bait so their stomachs sometimes contain the bait remains and it is assumed 

that when a fish is hooked is because it was hungry and thus with a higher probability of 

having an empty stomach. On the contrary, in the captures by trawling the specimens can 

have their stomachs full and even eat while they are within the net. In contrast to Xavier 

et al. (2012), in this study there seems to be no influence of the fishing gear/selectivity 

on the vacuity index. This was reflected on the high values of vacuity presented by the 

specimens caught by trawling, both for E. spinax (43.9%) and for E. pusillus (44.8%). 

This highest vacuity values can be influenced by the trawling time, because this fishing 



65 

 

method can take several hours and the stomachs may become completely digested and 

non-identifiable, as Costa et al. (2002) suggested. 

4.2. Diet composition according to sex and maturity stages 

 The segregation of the sexes between the species is a general behavior 

phenomenon observed in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Sims, 2006). Sharks can be 

an appropriate model to test theories on the mechanisms underlying sexual segregation. 

This is a common characteristic in shark populations (Sims, 2006), where juveniles as 

well as male and female adults begin to separate into different groups (Springer, 1967). 

 Concerning their diet compositions and corroborating the authors Neiva et al. 

(2006) and Xavier et al. (2012) findings, this study showed that the diet composition 

between sexes of each deep-water shark species did not present significant differences. 

Although the diet of E. spinax male specimens showed a higher heterogeneity diet than 

females. In the same way the maturity was not a significant source of variation in the diet 

of E. spinax. Furthermore and in terms of diversity, richness and evenness of species in 

their diets no statistically significant differences between sexes were also obtained for 

each species in study. 

For the same species, the sizes between mature females and males are usually 

different. This seems to be related with the reproduction mode (Sims, 2006). Most shark 

species present larger females than males, this could mean that sexual segregation plays 

an important role in the different energy requirements between males and females (Sims, 

2006). Regarding their length at first maturity, it was also significantly higher for females 

than males. According to Coelho et al. (2005), E. spinax first maturity was 30.86 cm for 

females and 25.39 cm for males, while for E. pusillus was 43.60 cm for females and 38.10 

cm for males. So both E. spinax and E. pusillus have a low growth rate and late maturing, 

which makes these populations extremely vulnerable to increasing fishing mortality, as 

suggested the Coelho et al. (2005) study. 

 Regarding the diet compositions of both studied species and in terms of IRI, the 

crustaceans were the most important group of prey for immature females and males in E. 

spinax species. Nevertheless the fish were the most important group in the diet 

composition of mature males of E. spinax, but not for the mature females, whose diet was 

composed mainly by crustaceans. This suggests that the ontogenetic shift in the diet of E. 

spinax is probably due to the low selectivity of increasingly larger specimens in the 

selection of the prey size (Neiva et al., 2006). On the other hand, Xavier et al. (2012) 



66 

 

suggest that in the E. pusillus diet, the fish increase in importance as the specimens 

increase in size. However, in spite the same has been observed, due to the low number of 

E. pusillus specimens obtained to carry out the present study, it was not possible to prove 

this evidence. Furthermore, Jakobsdóttir (2001) studied the diet of the shark 

Centroscyllium fabricii, which is in the same order as E. spinax and E. pusillus and she 

verified that the diet of the small/immature specimens of this species was based mainly 

on crustaceans and some fish (opportunistically), while diet of larger/mature specimens 

was mainly composed of fish. On the other hand, the amount of prey items in terms of 

number and weight (especially for the fish group), was usually higher in mature than in 

immature specimens of E. spinax. This can be affected by their reproductive cycle, as the 

fish group provides a large energetic value for overcoming this period, which requires a 

lot of energy. The study of Lopez et al. (2009) for the shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, also 

suggested that the higher consumption of fish is due to the large migrations of this species, 

which uses a large amount of energy.  

It is also interesting to suggest that the preference of the specimens for smaller or 

larger prey may be related with size of the predator’s mouth (Erzini et al., 1997). The 

mouth size of the individuals is related to their total length, therefore it is also connected 

to the size of the dominant prey found in their diets. It is also related with the stomach 

storage capacity, the swimming capability and energetic requirements, which accompany 

the growth of the predator and are important characteristics for the prey selection (Neiva 

et al. (2006). Thus it is probable that with the increase of specimen size the diet becomes 

more diverse in terms of prey size (Neiva et al., 2006). Consequently, the fact that larger 

specimens feed on larger species of prey may reduce the competition between both intra- 

and inter- species, just as Fanelli et al. (2009) suggested for E. spinax and G. melastomus. 

4.3. Diet composition according to the season 

 The analysis of the diet of both deep-water shark species for the different seasons, 

and separating them between warm season (summer and spring) and cold season (winter 

and autumn) showed that the crustaceans remain the main prey items in the diet 

composition during all seasons. 

The diet was richest during warm season for E. spinax, obtaining larger amount 

of items prey in warm season (n=167) than cold season (n=109). Generally, this study 

showed that E. spinax does not change diet seasonally. This means that they feed on the 

same prey groups along the year, although slight differences in their abundance, 



67 

 

frequency of occurrence and relative importance were observed. This result contrast with 

conclusions obtained by Anastasopoulou et al. (2013), who found seasonal shifts on the 

diet of another deepwater shark, namely Galeus melastomus, in the eastern Ionian Sea. In 

terms of IRI, %N and %FO, the diet composition for E. spinax during all year was 

composed mainly by crustaceans, being the decapods the most important type of prey. In 

the same way occurred for E. pusillus, but during the warm season. Otherwise, in terms 

of %W the fish group was most representative during hot season (51% for E. spinax and 

76.1% for E. pusillus).  

In contrast to some studies (Fanelly et al., 2009, Anastasopoulou et al., 2013 and 

Costa et al.,2002), this research did not show significant differences in the ANOSIM 

analysis of the diet composition of E. spinax in different season categories.  In addition, 

no statistically significant differences between seasons were also obtained for E. spinax 

and for each index of diversity, richness and evenness.  

These facts could be explain by many factors which can affect to the diet 

composition of the predators (Cailliet (1977) in Gonçalves (2000)). Shifts in diets can be 

a result of the amount of food available, migrations of prey and/or variations in water 

temperature (Gonçalves, 2000). The absence of a seasonal variation in the diet can be 

related to a relative constancy in values of temperature in the deep sea. Usually 

temperature variations are more evident in shallow waters than at greater depths, with 

effects on prey composition, fluctuations in abundance, and/or changes in distribution in 

the water column. Finally, high fishing pressure can have an impact on the prey 

communities, leading to the disruption of the food web with unpredictable effects on top 

predators.

4.4. General conclusions: 

The ecological importance and pressure that deep-water communities are subject 

in the context of human activities and climate change make basic biology studies very 

important in the understanding of the ecology of still considerably unknown species. 

This work is a valid contribution for the evaluation of the trophic relationships of 

two deepwater shark species from the Portuguese south coast and a common component 

of the crustacean fishery in the region as a result of bycatch. 

The results here presented indicated that Etmopterus spinax and Etmopterus 

pusillus are benthopelagic feeders, with a certain degree of specialization and eventually 

opportunistic behavior. The diet composition of both sharks is dominated by crustaceans, 

fish and cephalopods, suggesting a high degree of overlap between species. This indicates 

they are sharing prey resources, but also suggesting that they feed on abundant species 

present off the Algarve coast.  Furthermore, there were no differences in the diet 

composition diversity, richness and evenness of prey species, between sexes, maturity 

stages and seasons for each species, which reveals common patterns and strategies in 

relatively stable environment. The slight differences found between the diets of the two 

lantern sharks were probably due to a higher preference for fish and for preys less 

dependent on the bottom by the E. pusillus. The variability in the diet of E. spinax showed 

a preference of immature specimens for crustaceans and the mature specimens for fish. 

This is probably related with their mouth sizes, stomachs storage capacity, swimming 

capacity and their energy needs. 

Finally, differences found between the present study and previously reported diet 

composition for these species might be related with changes in the community structure 

of the prey-components caused both by natural variation and bottom trawling. However, 

more evidences are needed to draw further conclusions.
