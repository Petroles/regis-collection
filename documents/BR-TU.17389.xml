Resumo 

 

A batata-doce (Ipomoea batatas L.) tem sido muito utilizada ao longo dos tempos tanto 

na alimentação humana como na medicina tradicional. As cascas de batata-doce (sweet 

potato peels, SPP) são consideradas um resíduo na maioria dos processos de 

transformação do tubérculo. Apesar de consumidas em algumas partes do mundo, as 

folhas (sweet potato leaves, SPL) não são ainda utilizados na dieta de muitos países. Estes 

resíduos apresentam potencial para a sua conversão em alimentos funcionais com elevado 

teor de compostos fenólicos e alta atividade antioxidante. Neste contexto, foi 

desenvolvido um protótipo de bancada para uma bebida antioxidante à base de SPP com 

potenciais benefícios para a saúde associados à proteção do stress oxidativo. As etapas 

do processo de desenvolvimento do novo produto foram: revisão da literatura e de 

patentes, estudo preliminar, rastreio de fatores-chave, otimização da extração e 

otimização da formulação. O teor total de compostos fenólicos (total phenolic content, 

TPC) e a atividade antioxidante foram avaliados respetivamente, pelo método Folin-

Ciocalteau e ensaios in vitro. A revisão da literatura e de patentes para o período 2003-

2014 revelou lacunas na investigação, para SPL e especialmente para SPP, em aplicações 

alimentares com benefícios para a saúde. Da pesquisa realizada nas bases de dados ISI 

Web of Knowledge e ESPACENET foram selecionados e analisados 122 artigos e 170 

patentes. O desenvolvimento de novos produtos e a utilização de ferramentas de design 

experimental foram hiatos identificados em estudos sobre SPP e SPL. Para SPP, foi ainda 

identificada a necessidade da análise da atividade antioxidante, da composição em 

fenólicos e a realização de ensaios pré-clínicos e clínicos. O produto alimentar mais 

estudado, nos artigos, foi na forma de farinha/pó enquanto que nas patentes foi a bebida. 

Deste modo, a valorização das SPP e SPL através do desenvolvimento de uma bebida 

com atividade antioxidante, recorrendo a ferramentas de desenho experimental e análise 

da atividade antioxidante in vitro, irá preencher lacunas identificadas na investigação. A 

mineração de textos (texto mining), aplicada aos resumos dos artigos e das patentes, 

identificou eficazmente os principais temas de investigação. No estudo preliminar foram 

investigados os efeitos de uma variável de produto (ramas de batata-doce) e de duas 

variáveis de processo (tempo e solvente de extração) em TPC e no teor de flavonoides 

(total flavonoid content, TFC) bem como na atividade antioxidante in vitro. Os métodos 

utilizados na avaliação da atividade antioxidante in vitro foram a atividade antioxidante

total (total antioxidant activity, TAA), o poder redutor (reducing power, RP), o poder 

redutor do ferro (ferric reducing activity, FRAP) e o método de sequestro de radicais 

livres de 2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazila (DPPH). As experiências foram realizadas de 

acordo com um plano fatorial completo para três fatores: parte da planta (caule ou folhas), 

tempo (24, 48 ou 72 h) e solvente (não acidificado e acidificado). O fator mais importante 

influente nas respostas foi a parte da planta seguido do fator solvente. TPC, TFC, FRAP 

e RP apresentaram uma elevada influência do fator parte da planta enquanto que o 

solvente apresentou um maior efeito no método DPPH. O tempo de extração teve 

unicamente influência em RP, tanto como efeito principal como em interação com o fator 

parte da planta. As atividades antioxidante das folhas foram 1,25 g de equivalentes de 

ácido ascórbico (ascorbic acid equivalent, AAE)/100 g (peso seco) para TAA e 50,8 g de 

equivalentes de ácido gálico (galic acid equivalente, GAE,)/100 g para RP. A atividade 

sequestrante do radical DPPH foi superior à atividade antioxidante medida por FRAP 

(.i.e., 58,6 e 29,3 mM de equivalentes de Trolox (Trolox equivalent, TE)/g de peso seco, 

respetivamente). A etapa seguinte, do processo de desenvolvimento, foi o rastreio de 

fatores chave na extração de compostos fenólicos de farinhas de SPP. Para tal, utilizou-

se um design experimental de 12 ensaios de Plackett-Burman tendo como variáveis a 

razão solvente: sólido (10 ou 50 mL/g), o tempo (60 ou 180 min), o pH (2,3 ou 7,0), a 

profundidade do corte da casca (1,5 ou 3,0 mm), o tamanho das partículas (&lt;600 ou&amp;lt;300 

µ m), a temperatura (27 ou 40 ºC), o solvente (água destilada ou água do abastecimento 

público), o tamanho da amostra (0,1 ou 1,0 g) e o nível de agitação (50 ou 200 rpm). Os 

fatores chave significativos (p&amp;lt;0,05) para TPC foram a razão solvente: sólido (efeito 

positivo) e a profundidade do corte da casca (efeito negativo). Estes dois fatores 

apresentaram efeitos de direção, magnitude e significância semelhante para FRAP. Os 

modelos de regressão obtidos para os resultados de FRAP, transformados pela função raiz 

quadrada, mostraram a interação entre os fatores profundidade de corte e tamanho da 

amostra como o terceiro efeito mais influente. A modelação e otimização da extração 

aquosa de compostos fenólicos, com atividade antioxidante, de farinhas de SPP foram 

realizadas recorrendo às metodologias de Superfície de Resposta (Response Surface 

Methodology, RSM) e de Redes Neurais Artificiais (Artificial Neural Network, ANN). A 

razão solvente: sólido (30 a 60 mL/g), o tempo (30 a 90 min) e a temperatura (25 a 75 ºC) 

foram combinados de acordo com um plano de experiências de composto central (Central 

Composite Design, CCD). Os fatores temperatura e a razão solvente: sólido,

individualmente e em interação, apresentaram um efeito positivo quer para TPC quer para 

os métodos ABTS e DPPH. Individualmente, o fator tempo,teve uma influência negativa 

no método ABTS e, quando combinado com a temperatura, apresentou o mesmo efeito 

para TPC e para o método ABTS. A direção da influência do fator tempo foi sempre 

negativa e de magnitude inferior aos efeitos positivos dos outros fatores. As condições de 

extração ótimas obtidas foram 60 mL/g, 45 min e 75 °C com valores previstos para os 

métodos TPC, ABTS e DPPH de 11,87 ± 0,69 mg GAE, 12,91 ± 0,42 mg TE e 46,35 ± 

3,08 mg TE por g de material seco, respetivamente. O rendimento em compostos 

fenólicos e as respetivas condições de extração obtidas para SPP foram semelhantes aos 

conseguidos para as cascas de batata, as cascas de fruta do chá (Camelia sinensis L.) e as 

cascas de manga (Mangifera pajang Kostern). A etapa final do desenvolvimento do novo 

produto consistiu na otimização da formulação de uma bebida antioxidante, tendo como 

componentes um extrato aquoso de SPP (SPPE), um extrato aquoso de SPL (SPLE) e 

uma solução de mel (HonS). As formulações foram testadas de acordo com um desenho 

de mistura I-optimal sendo avaliadas pelos métodos TPC, FRAP, DPPH e pelos sólidos 

solúveis (SS). A modelação dos dados foi realizada pelas metodologias de regressão dos 

mínimos quadrados (least squared regression, LSR) e ANN. Os componentes 

apresentaram um efeito positivo para os métodos TPC, FRAP e DPPH na seguinte ordem: 

SPLE&gt; SPPE&gt; HonS. Foram observados efeitos sinergéticos entre SPPE e HonS, SPLE 

e HonS e SPPE e SPLE, e todos os efeitos antagónicos foram não significativos (p&gt; 0,05). 

A formulação ótima da bebida foi obtida pela metodologia ANN tendo como resultado 

50,0 % de SPPE, 21,5 % de SPLE e 28,5 % de HonS. Os valores previstos para os métodos 

TPC, FRAP, DPPH e para SS foram respetivamente 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098 

mg TE/L e 12,3 ºBrix, tendo-se obtido resultados idênticos com a utilização dos modelos 

LSR. O protótipo posicionou-se próximo das bebidas comerciais de frutas e vegetais 

quanto à sua atividade antioxidante. A transferência de conhecimento destes resultados 

para a indústria alimentar pode oferecer uma oportunidade para a valorização de SPP e 

SPL promovendo paralelamente o interesse na investigação em aplicações alimentares 

com benefícios para a saúde.

Abstract 

 

The valorisation of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) wastes into a food application with 

health benefits was studied using a product development framework to translate a product 

concept into a benchtop prototype. A functional beverage with attributes related to 

oxidative stress protection was developed using sweet potato peel (SPP) and sweet potato 

leaf (SPL) as components. The developing processes involved the following steps: 

literature and patent review, preliminary study, key factors screening, extraction 

optimization and beverage formula optimization. Total phenolic content (TPC) and 

antioxidant activity was measured by Folin-Ciocalteau method and antioxidant activity 

by in vitro screening assays. Literature and patent review for the period 2003-2014 

identified research gaps on food applications with health benefits for SPL and especially 

SPP. Text mining analysis on articles abstracts could picture research main themes. A 

preliminary study using a factorial design revealed that plant part (stems or leaves) 

presented the largest main significant effect (p &amp;lt;0.001) on TPC, total flavonoids content 

(TFC), total antioxidant activity (TAA), reducing power (RP) and ferric reducing activity 

power (FRAP) while for DPPH scavenging assay, solvent acidification was the most 

influential factor. Time of extraction had the only significant effect on RP assay, as main 

effect and interaction with plant part. Solvent: solid ratio and peel cut depth were the key 

factors identified by a Plackett-Burman design for the aqueous extraction of phenolics of 

SPP flour. The aqueous extraction conditions of phenolic from SPP flour were modelled 

by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial neural Network (ANN) analysis 

of a Central composite Design (CCD) experimental plan. Optimized conditions were 60 

mL/g for solvent: solid ratio, 30 min for time and 75 ºC for temperature. Predicted 

responses were 11.87 ± 0.69 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.91 ± 0.42 mg TE/g DM for 

ABTS and 46.35 ± 3.08 mg TE/g DM for DPPH assay. Beverage formula components 

SPP aqueous extract (SPPE), SPL water extract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS) were 

combined according to a mixture design. The optimized formula obtained by ANN 

models for the SPP beverage benchtop prototype was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE 

and 28.5 % of HonS. TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS predicted responses for the 

optimal formula were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098 mg TE/L and 12.3 ± 0.8 ºBrix, 

respectively. Beverage positioned next to commercial vegetable and fruit beverages in 

terms of antioxidant activity. Knowledge transfer of these findings to food processors

may offer an opportunity to transform SPP and SPL from a liability to an asset and 

promote further research on food application with health benefits.

Aims, objectives and work plan of the Thesis 

 

 

Sweet potato is widely cultivated throughout the world, being a favourite staple of many 

cultures, it is a favourite ingredient in many ethnic cuisine (Huntrods, 2013). Originated on the 

American continent at least 5000 years ago, it was brought to Europe in1492. Portuguese 

explorers of the sixteenth century took it to Africa and Asia (Loebenstein, 2009), however, it 

seems that sweet potato has a long history cultivation in Oceania (Lebot, 2009). The tuberous 

root of the plant is most commonly consumed in the Western part of the world, but sweet potato 

leaves, consumed primarily in the islands of Pacific Ocean and in Asian and African countries, 

are decidedly rich in nutrients and functional compounds (Johnson &amp;amp; Pace, 2010). In 2013, 

sweet potato ranked as the 14th top commodity by quantity production, 1.11 x 108 ton. 

According to 2011 proportions, the main destination of total amount produced was food supply 

(53 %), followed by feed (40 %) and waste (7 %) (FAOSTAT, 2014). There are no official data 

for sweet potato tops, however the harvested area of 8.2 million hectare can be used for the 

estimation of vines production. Considering an average yield of 30 ton of fresh vines per hectare 

from Hartemink et al. (2000), 2.46 x 108 tons of fresh vines could have been produced during 

2013.  

Sweet potato peels had also received attention for food applications as they possessed high 

levels of phenolics (Zhu, Cai, Yang, Ke, &amp;amp; Corke, 2010) and can reach almost three times more 

antioxidant activity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals &amp;amp; Cisneros-Zevallos, 2001). 

Peels are one of the major wastes generated during the processing of sweet potato and currently 

it has reduced market value (Maloney, Truong, &amp;amp; Allen, 2012).  

Sweet potato leaves were classified as a physiologically functional food which offers protection 

from various diseases (Islam, 2006) and health promotion by reducing oxidative stress (Johnson 

&amp;amp; Pace, 2010). Their role is mediated by the ability to promote more favourable antioxidant 

status, free radical scavenging capacities, and prevent processes involved in disease 

pathogenesis (Johnson &amp;amp; Pace, 2010). Active compounds were grouped into two types of 

polyphenols as anthocyanins and phenolic acids. The anthocyanins were acylated cyanidin and 

peonidin type while the phenolic acids were composed of caffeic acid and five kinds of 

caffeoylquinic acid derivatives (Islam, 2006). Physiological functions related to these 

polyphenols as radical scavenging, antimutagenic, anticancer, antidiabetes, antibacterial, anti-

inflammatory, cardioprotective and chemopreventive activities have been demonstrated in vitro 

and in vivo. (Islam, 2006; Johnson &amp;amp; Pace, 2010) 

Research has been done on the recovery of various chemical substances as  polyphenolics from 

food processing wastes as they are highly valuable compounds that may be used as functional 

food ingredients and as natural antioxidants as they can be readily extracted by simple methods 

and can then be used for the preparation of functional foods or ingredients (Barberán &amp;amp; 

Waldron, 2007). Recycling of agro wastes into value added products with potential health 

benefits could be achieved through extraction, (Peschel et al., 2006). The biological activity of 

extracts from food wastes needs more research (Barberán &amp;amp; Waldron, 2007).  

Functional foods demand a continuous innovative approach to develop convenient and healthy 

foods according to consumer’s expectations (Betoret, Betoret, Vidal, &amp;amp; Fito, 2011). It is a 

multistage process that requires input from commercial, academic, regulatory and consumer 

interests. The commencing stages involves the translation of an essential concept often 

originated from academic research into a prototype (Jones &amp;amp; Jew, 2007). A competitive 

innovation environment in the food industry requires a collaborative knowledge development 

and resource sharing activities among stakeholders academics and industry (Khan, Grigor, 

Winger, &amp;amp; Win, 2013). Teams of academics working with business interests could deliver an 

optimal product concept that enables forward the innovation cycle (Jones &amp;amp; Jew, 2007). The 

assessment of efficacy for a prototype can be performed using in vitro systems with further 

proof-of-concept testing animal and human trials (Jones &amp;amp; Jew, 2007). The information 

obtained with in vitro antioxidant assays was considered adequate for the evaluation of food 

quality although not of food biofunctionality. The assessment of food antioxidant functionality 

uniquely by this non-compositional approach contains several drawbacks and difficulties due 

to several factors that can affect the measurement in food matrices (Pompella et al., 2013). 

 

This thesis was a result of several extrinsic and intrinsic motivations shaped by context factors:  

o Functional foods, a category of the health and wellbeing market,  are becoming a major 

focus of new product development in the food industry (Khan et al., 2013);  

o The growth of health and wellness beverage market is set to outperform the wider soft 

and hot drinks industry through 2016 (Euromonitor International, 2013); 

o Sustainability values are driving a growing interest in the valorisation of agro-wastes 

valorisation in functional products (Spatafora &amp;amp; Tringali, 2012);

o Although recognized as providing significant protection against the development and 

progression of many chronic diseases, the role of polyphenols in human health is still a 

fertile area of research (Pandey &amp;amp; Rizvi, 2009);  

o Substantial evidence indicates that antioxidants may be of great benefit in improving 

the quality of life by preventing or postponing the onset of degenerative diseases (Alam, 

Bristi, &amp;amp; Rafiquzzaman, 2013);  

o Sweet potato is being cultivated traditionally in Algarve that holds a Protected 

Geographical Indication (PGI) by the European Union (European Union, 2008); 

o Actual trend on the revival forgotten healthy food as sweet potato leaves that were 

consumed in Algarve in the form of salads, soups or sautée in 1940’s (Nascimento, 

1944); 

o In the beginning of the thesis, Food Science Lab had just published a study on sweet 

potato leaves including its polyphenolic profile (Carvalho, Cavaco, Carvalho, &amp;amp; Duque, 

2010); 

o Researcher aims to transfer research methodology/results to industry, with focus on 

waste valorisation through functional food product development. 

 

 

1.1. Research aims 

 

A great variability of techniques is required in order to meet the needs and expectancies in the 

area of functional foods. Traditional techniques as formulation have a long history in the 

development of successful functional foods (Khan et al., 2013) and as they constitute simple 

and cheap processing methods. In the past decades, the uses of sweet potato have diversified 

considerably, having great potential as a source of local value-added products and ingredients. 

Some examples include food products like noodles and desserts and some industrial products 

such as flour or starch. Sweet potato flour can be fermented to make products like soy sauce 

and alcohol, or if immediately cooked, it can be further processed into wine, vinegar and “nata 

de coco”, a popular dessert in the Philippines and in Japan. Drying, freezing or processing sweet

potatoes into a frozen prepared food may benefit producers or processors by extending product 

shelf life (Huntrods, 2013). Alternative food products, particularly frozen type have become 

commercially available and are steadily growing. Sweet potato beverages were marketed since 

1997 in Japan and dried sweet potato snacks manufactured by Chinese companies are sold as a 

health food for weight loss (Barnes &amp;amp; Sanders, 2012).  

Sweet potato tuber has also been profusely included in the composition of innovative 

applications such as ice-cream (Gurgel, Farias, Farias, &amp;amp; Moreira, 2011) or non-carbonated 

drink (Wireko-Manu, Ellis, &amp;amp; Oduro, 2010). Functional uses for tuber includes fries and chips, 

flakes, and yogurt (Barnes &amp;amp; Sanders, 2012). Leaf dry powder for juice, paste and  ice cream 

was suggested applications besides tea, breads, confectioneries, and as a nutritional supplement 

(Islam, 2006). As the growth of health and wellness beverage market is set to outperform the 

wider soft and hot drinks industry through 2016 (Euromonitor International, 2013), an 

antioxidant beverage could be a promising valorisation of sweet potato wastes as peels and 

leaves. 

 

 

1.2. Objectives 

 

The general objectives defined for this Thesis were: 

 

o Propose a framework for the valorisation of agro wastes into a food application through 
the development of a benchtop prototype with added value;

commercial and laboratory food products. 

 

 

1.3. Outline of the Thesis 

 

Thesis general introduction, in Chapter 2, aims to reveal the state of the art on antioxidant 

activity of phenolic compounds from sweet potato and its food applications. The review was 

based on the analysis of articles and patents published during 2003 to 2014, aided by text 

mining tools as hierarquical cluster analysis (HCA) and co-occurrence networks. 

 

In Chapter 3, extraction parameters of phenolics with in vitro antioxidant activity from sweet 

potato vines were studied through a factorial design. Plant part, time and solvent acidification 

were the factors studied, while total phenolic content and different antioxidant activities assays 

were the responses for design evaluation. Statistical analyses were based on analysis of variance 

(ANOVA), post-hoc tests and principal components analysis (PCA).

In Chapter 4, the effect of nine variables identified as relevant in previous studies on phenolics 

extraction were combined in a twelve run Plackett–Burman design to screen for the key factors. 

Statistical tools as ANOVA and regression analysis evaluated significant main effects and two 

factors interactions, respectively. Total phenolic content (TPC) and ferric reducing activity 

power (FRAP) assays were determined to evaluate the different runs.  

 

The aqueous extraction of phenolics with radical scavenging activity from sweet potato peels 

was modelled and optimized in Chapter 5. Solvent: solid ratio, time and temperature were 

varied according to a Central Composite Design, with total phenolic content and three in vitro 

antioxidant assays as responses. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural 

network (ANN) methodologies were used for data analysis.  

 

In Chapter 6, a functional beverage benchtop prototype related to oxidative stress protection 

was developed. The three formula components, sweet potato peel water extract, sweet potato 

leaves water extract and honey solution were varied though a mixture design. Formulation 

modelling and optimization was performed by regression analysis and ANN,  

 

Finally, general conclusions were presented in Chapter 7. 

 

The work plan of the thesis was presented in Table 1.1.

Abstract 

To define research lines for the valorisation of sweet potato (SP) wastes as peels and leaves, a 

literature and patent review on food applications with health benefits was performed. The 

documents on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from the different plant parts – tuber, 

leaf, stem, vine and also cell line and processing waste – were selected for the period 2003-

2014 from Web of Science™ and ESPACENET databases. SP articles presented a demarked 

trend towards preclinical studies and new foods that did not include SPP or SPL. DPPH method 

was the in vitro antioxidant activity assay most used and hydroxycinnamic acids and 

anthocyanins were the phenolic compounds more analysed. Enhancement of antioxidant 

defence and anticancer were health benefits verified by clinical trials for SPL while studies on 

peel were absent. Among the food applications studied in articles, flour/powder was the most 

studied for tuber, leaf and peel. Beverage and extract were the top patented foods for tuber and 

leaf, respectively. Text mining applied to abstracts revealed main themes. The development of 

new food products as beverages using design of experiment tools will reduce the knowledge 

gaps on SP leaves and specially peels and their valorisation into food application with health 

benefits.  

 

 

Keywords: Sweet potato peels; sweet potato leaves; antioxidant activity; phenolic compounds;

2.1. Introduction 

 

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) ranked as 14th top commodity by quantity-wise production. 

In 2013 (FAOSTAT, 2014),being a favourite staple of many cultures it is an ingredient in many 

ethnic cuisine (Huntrods, 2013). Although sweet potato (SP) tuber is most commonly 

consumed in the Western part of the world, their leaves consumed primarily in the islands of 

the Pacific Ocean and in Asian and African countries, are decidedly rich in nutrients and 

functional compounds (Johnson &amp;amp; Pace, 2010). Peels are one of the major wastes generated 

during processing of sweet potato with currently little market value (Maloney, Truong, &amp;amp; Allen, 

2012). The peeling step required in many SP tuber processing methods can lead to losses up to 

29 % and 17 % for abrasive and manual peeling respectively (Oladejo, 2011). Thus, SP peels 

and leaves are residues that should be included in the drive for recycling agro wastes as peels 

into value added products (Peschel et al., 2006). SP peels possessed high levels of phenolics 

(Zhu, Cai, Yang, Ke, &amp;amp; Corke, 2010) that can reach almost three times more antioxidant 

activity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals &amp;amp; Cisneros-Zevallos, 2001). Similarly, 

polyphenolic compounds from SP leaves were biologically active and presented physiological 

functions which may be helpful for maintaining and promoting human health (Islam, 2006). 

Thus, the development of food application with health benefits related to the antioxidant 

activity of phenolic compounds from SP peels and leaves are valuable research line both of 

academic and industrial interests. There have been reviews on sweet potato tuber and leaf on 

during the period of study. In 2007, (Bovell-Benjamin, 2007) highlighted sweet potato 

utilization, and its potential as value?added products in human food systems. It pointed out that 

a multidisciplinary, integrated research and developmental activities, from production to 

processing technologies, were need to explore SP potential value?added products. Panda &amp;amp; 

Sonkamble (2012) reviewed the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological activities of 

SP where the peel was indicated as containing high levels of polyphenols such as anthocyanins 

and phenolic acids. Health benefits as antioxidant, antidiabetic, wound healing, anti-ulcer, 

antibacterial and anti-mutagenic were listed. Finally, Mohanraj &amp;amp; Sivasankar (2014) covered 

the health benefits, phytochemical composition and medicinal properties of SP, among other 

topics, to demonstrate their potential as a medicinal food. Regarding leaf, Islam (2006) in his 

review highlighted the presence of higher amounts of polyphenolics compared with the major 

commercial vegetables. Significant medicinal value was already attributed to biologically 

active anthocyanins and phenolic acids as they showed physiological functions which may be

helpful for maintaining and promoting human health. The benefits of radical scavenging 

activity, antimutagenic activity, anticancer, antidiabetes, and antibacterial activity were also 

listed (Islam, 2006). In 2010, Johnson &amp;amp; Pace summarised the bioactive compounds in SP 

leaves that played a vital role in health promotion by improving immune function, reducing 

oxidative stress and free radical damage, reducing cardiovascular disease risk and suppressing 

cancer cell growth. The ability of antioxidants from SP leaves to reduce the risks associated 

with disease is mediated by their ability to promote more favourable antioxidant status, free 

radical scavenging capacities, and thwart processes involved in disease pathogenesis (Johnson 

&amp;amp; Pace, 2010). It clearly concluded that promoting the consumption of sweet potato leaves 

warrants further and more intensive research investigation related to reduce the prevalence of 

chronic diseases (Johnson &amp;amp; Pace, 2010). Several foods were enumerated as a source for 

beneficial polyphenolic compounds. Frozen products and beverages are available in the market 

in some countries for a long time. Considerable progress has been made in diversifying usage 

of the SP for alternative foods as fries, chips, flakes, yogurt, as well as juices or weight loss 

snacks (Barnes &amp;amp; Sanders, 2012). Innovative applications such as ice-cream (Gurgel, Farias, 

Farias, &amp;amp; Moreira, 2011) and non-carbonated drink (Wireko-Manu, Ellis, &amp;amp; Oduro, 2010) were 

studied in an academic context. Tea, noodles, breads, confectioneries and nutritional 

supplement were food applications previously mentioned for SP leaves (Islam, 2006). In 2006, 

products as dry powder for juice, paste, ice cream were in development by cooperation between 

universities and food companies. The development of SP alternative foods was predicted to 

continue its upward climb trend as consumers are more conscious about their health (Barnes &amp;amp; 

Sanders, 2012). The development of functional foods is a multistage process where the 

commencing stages involve the translation of an essential concept often originated from 

academic research into a prototype (Jones &amp;amp; Jew, 2007). Although, there are available some 

reviews on the phytochemical composition and health benefits of sweet potato tuber and leaf, 

the health benefits specifically related to the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in the 

different food applications were not focused. In addition, a framework for the valorisation of 

agro wastes through the development of functional foods requires the identification of 

knowledge gaps to favour early product prototypes. To gain insight on trend and state of the art 

on food applications with health benefits from antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from 

sweet potato, a literature and patent review for the period 2003 -2013 was performed and 

analysed by plant part. Text mining tools as co-word clustering is a powerful method for 

literature-review and knowledge discovery by exploring the co-occurrence and co-absence of

key words that appear in the titles or abstracts of texts (Stegmann &amp;amp; Grohmann, 2003). 

Additionally, network analysis shows the relationship among words as a visual network and 

therefore assists the analyser in intuitively comprehending the overall structure of a document 

database (Yoon &amp;amp; Park, 2004). The objective of this review was to analyse the type of studies, 

antioxidant assays, phenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food 

applications for the different SP plant parts in the period 2003 -2014. Together with the analysis 

of the state of the art pictured by text mining tools, relevant research lines for the valorisation 

of SP peels and leaves into food applications with health benefits will be identified.  

 

 

2.2. Materials and Methods  

 

A qualitative approach was taken to analyse the selected documents by summarizing 

information in tables, graphics and applying text-mining tools. 

 

2.2.1. Databases 

 

A search on ISI Web of Knowledge (http://wokinfo.com/) and ESPACENET 

(http://worldwide.espacenet.com/#) electronic databases for the period 2003-2014 was 

performed to gather relevant documents on topic of this study. The databases Web of 

ScienceTM Core Collection, Current Contents Connect®, MEDLINE® and SciELO Citation 

Index were selected for articles search. For patents, previous tests presented only one and zero 

results in the WIPO and European collection, respectively. Therefore, the worldwide collection 

of published application from 90 countries was chosen as database.  

 

2.2.2. Selection of articles and patents 

 

For the selection of articles, the first criteria used in the Web of Knowledge database was 

documents  with “sweet potato” or “Ipomoea batatas” in the title for the period 2003-2014. The 

following filters were included: “science and technology” for the research domain, “food 

science and technology” for the research area and “articles” (review were excluded) for the 

document type. The first collection of documents were selected by the presence of the terms 

“phenol*”, “antho*”, “flavon*”, “antiox*” and/or “scaveng*” in document topic. This

collection was narrowed by two reviews to the theme antioxidant activity and/or phenolic 

composition of sweet potato plant. Finally, when essential information was absent from the 

article description and could not be acquired by contact with the corresponding authors, it was 

not included in the review. Regarding the selection of patents, a search was performed in the 

ESPACENET database for documents with “sweet potato” or “Ipomea batatas” in the title or 

in abstract with publication date in the range 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2014 (20030101-20141231). 

Patents published in the field that presented the terms “phenol*”, “antho*”, “flavon*”, 

“antiox*” and/or “scaveng*” in their abstract were selected. A patent was included in the review 

when the invention was related to a food application with antioxidant activity and/or phenolic 

composition. 

 

2.2.3. Documents analysis 

 

2.2.3.1. Traditional approach 

 

The body of information gathered from the selected documents were synthetized into tables 

(Supplementary data). Articles were classified by SP plant part (tuber, leaf, stem, vine, peel, 

cell line and waste) on variety (purple and not purple), type of study, antioxidant activity assays, 

phenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food applications. For patents, 

documents categorization by the different SP plant parts was made for variety and food 

applications. 

 

2.2.3.2. Text mining 

 

The free text mining software tool KH coder (http://sourceforge.net/projects/khc/) was used to 

perform an automatic text mining of articles and patents abstracts. Text pre-processing was 

done by breaking sentences into component parts of speech (parsing), removal of common 

words with little significance (stop words) and aggregation of similar words (stemming or 

lemming). Only nouns and adjectives were used for analysis and both term frequency and 

document frequency were adjusted so 27 to 31 words were used for graphical representation. 

A Hierarquical cluster analysis (HCA) using the Ward method and Jaccard distance with 

automatic detection of the number of clusters was applied to nouns and adjectives to form 

groups of words that summarize documents major themes. Co-occurrence networks were built 



Chapter 2

Food Applications and Health Benefits 
20 

 

to pattern high-frequency words occurring together and identify content communities. Nodes 

size was proportional to respective word frequency and links (edges) thickness was determined 

by Jaccard coefficient. Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm was used to determine the position of 

the nodes in the network layout while community detection was performed using the function 

"edge.betweenness.community” from the "igraph" package of R.  

 

 

2.3. Results and discussion 

 

Food applications and health benefits related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds 

from SP were analyzed by plant part. The plant parts considered were tuber, leaf, stem, vine 

and peel. Due to results from documents analysis, cell line and processing waste were also 

considered and named as plant part. The following features were analyzed: types of studies, 

antioxidant activity assays, phenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food 

applications. Text mining tools applied to articles and patents abstracts intended to picture the 

main results for the period 2003-2014 on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from SP. 

 

2.3.1. Selection of documents 

 

A search on article titles with “sweet potato” or “Ipomoea batatas” in the Web of Science™ 

Core Collection for the period 2003-2014 in the science and technology domain and food 

science and technology research area delivered 443 results. When refined to the topic terms 

“phenol*”, “antho*”, “flavon*”, “antiox*” or “scaveng*” a total of 432 different articles was 

obtained. Thus, most of the studies for the food science and technology research area addressed 

SP phenolic compounds or antioxidant activity. The abstract of these articles was verified for 

relevance, when one of the refining topic terms was present in the article abstract, it was 

included in the review. The final selection of articles on phenolic compounds with antioxidant 

activity from SP totalized 122 articles (Table 2.1.).

Search on ESPACENET database delivered a total of 4895 patents with “sweet potato” in the 

title or abstract for the period 2003-2014. When the search was narrowed by including the 

presence of the terms “phenol*”, “antho*”, “flavon*”, “antiox*” or “scaveng*” in the title or 

abstract, it delivered 9, 137, 19, 76 and 11 results, respectively. Combined, a total of 217 

different patents were obtained. After verification if invention was related to a food application 

by analyzing abstract content, patents were reduced to 170 documents (Table 2.2.). Combined, 

articles and patents formed a collection of 292 documents with the following main features: a) 

58 % of the documents were patents; b) 71 % of the documents were published in the period 

2010-2013; c) 68 % of the documents were on the purple variety and d) tuber was the subject 

of 79 % of the documents, in opposition to the other forms (leaf, stem, vine, peel, cell line, or 

processing waste) (Figure 2.1). The time series map of articles date of publication showed a 

one step-profile with an average of 7 articles per year for the period 2003 to 2009 (Figure 2.2). 

A growth to an average of 16 articles per year was observed to the period 2010 to1013 followed 

by a decrease to 10 articles published in 2014. Patents presented a different time profile in 

comparison to articles. Until 2010, an average of 6 patents were published per year. The number 

of patents on sweet potato has increased since 2011, with a higher growth (70 %) from 2013 to 

2014. 

 

2.3.1.2. SP Articles 

 

The 122 selected articles for this review were published in 58 different journals, where 4 - 

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Food Chemistry, International Journal of Food 

Science and Technology and Food Science and Technology Research - reached 33 % in number. 

Articles were classified by plant part and variety as presented in Supplementary Table S2.1. As 

depicted in Figure 2.3, tuber presented the highest number of papers both on the purple and 

non-purple variety. SP leaf was the second most studied plant part with more articles than stem, 

vine, peel, cell line and processing waste together. Although SP leaves are considered a waste 

in many parts of the world, they are consumed in Asia as a leafy vegetable and therefore gaining 

high research attention. All the SP plant parts with exception of the tuber presented more 

articles on the non-purple varieties. The purple variety was mostly studied by research centers 

from China that presented the highest number of papers (18), followed by Korea (14).

For other SP varieties than purple, research centers from Asia counties were still dominant but 

authors’ affiliations were from other continents (Europe, America and Oceania) in ~ 35 % of  

the papers Articles on the purple and non-purple varieties presented a similar trend regarding 

the publication date profile over the period 2003-2014 (Figure 2.4A). The number of articles 

on the purple variety presented an average of 3 per year in the period 2003-2005 that increased

to an average of 9 per year in the period 2010-2013. In 2014, a decrease in the number of 

articles on the purple variety decreased to 6. For non-purple SP, the average in the period 2003-

2005 was of 4 articles per year that increased to an average of 7 per year in the period 2010-

2013. As observed for articles on the purple variety, in 2014 the number of articles published 

for the non-purple SP decreased. Research on the other SP plant parts SP less or absent for the 

period 2003-2014.

The time series map by plant part (Figure 2.4B) showed the number of articles on SP tuber and 

leaf presented similar trends and tuber presented always more publication per year than the 

other plant parts considered. Thus, antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds by SP plant part 

had the following order regarding the number or articles: tuber&gt;&gt;leaf&gt;&gt;peel. Studies on SP 

peel received much less attention than tuber of leaf. To respond to the growing interest of agro- 

and food industries in value added recycling (Peschel et al., 2006), there is a need for research 

on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from SP leaves but specially peels. This could 

contribute to overcome this knowledge gap and promote to the valorization of both peels and 

leaves into food applications with health benefits.  

 

2.3.1.2. SP Patents 

 

The 170 selected patents were predominantly from China (72 %) with Qingdao Agricultural 

University as the top applicant (11 patents). The classification of the selected patents by plant 

part and variety was presented in Supplementary Table S2.2. The number of patents on 

antioxidant activity of phenolic  compounds from SP was concentrated on the purple variety 

(79 %) and on the tuber plant part (91 %) (Figure 2.5). Inventions with SP leaf or peel occurred 

in a very small scale. As occurred in articles, leaf (alone or combined with stem) was the second 

plant part most mentioned in patents.

In addition, inventions including peels were scare for the period 2003-2014. The time series 

map of patent publication date showed that inventions including the purple variety supplanted 

the non-purple varieties in 2006, with a large growth from 2010 to 2014 (Figure 2.6A). Tuber 

presented a similar trend than the purple variety due to their prevalence on SP patents (Figure 

2.6B). Therefore, research on SP peels and leaves for food applications have potential to be 

considered an invention and protected by patent registration. As the strategy of combining

29 

 

different SP plant parts presented a low intensity in the period of time studied, it could be 

undertaken in future developments of value added products. 

 

2.3.2. Types of study of SP articles 

 

Articles on antioxidant activity of phenolic compound from sweet potato were classified into 

thirteen different types of study (Supplementary Table S2.3). More than one type of study or 

plant part could be attributed to a paper in accordance to their objectives. For SP tuber, the top 

four types of study were in decreasing order: new food, preclinical (animal), processing method 

and cultivar/genotype/variety (Figure 2.7A). Leaf presented a different order for the type of 

studies, namely cultivar/genotype/variety &gt; preclinical (animal) &gt; plant part = clinical = 

production cultivation (Figure 2.7B). Tuber presented more preclinical (animal) studies than 

leaf and an inverse order was observed for clinical studies. Regarding peels, papers were on the 

phenolic composition, processing methods and processing variables effects on antioxidant 

activity. SP processing waste (2 papers) was the only plant part beside tuber that had articles 

on new food.  

The distribution in time of the different types of studies showed that until 2009 there was no 

predominance of any type of study (Figure 2.8). However, from 2010 until 2013, the main types 

identified previously appeared markedly. Preclinical (animal) studies reached 6 articles both in 

2010 and 2013 (Figure 2.8A). An increase in new food studies was also observed for the period 

2012-2014. Studies on the effect of processing variables on SP antioxidant activity reach 5 

articles in 20110 while 4 articles on formulation studies were published in 2004 (Figure 2.8B). 

Therefore, for the late period 2003-2014.there was a demarked trend towards preclinical studies 

followed by research on new foods related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from 

SP. The effect of processing methods and phenolic compounds represented a steady or positive 

trend from 2013 to 2014. 

The knowledge gap was higher for SP peel than for leaves. Research on new foods for peels 

and leaves combined with processing variables studies may benefit from the body of knowledge 

already built for the tuber plant part. In addition, the inclusion of optimization and formulation 

may accelerate the development of food application with health benefits based on SP peels and 

leaves.

2.3.3. Antioxidant activity assays used in SP articles 

 

The antioxidant activity results from the collection of articles related to phenolic compound 

from sweet potato were distributed by fourteen in vitro antioxidant assays and nine in vivo 

assays (Supplementary Table S2.4). Frequently, more than one assay was used in a paper. For 

SP tuber, the in vitro assay 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity was 

predominant, with ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP) assay as the second most used 

assay (Figure 2.9A). DPPH assay was also the most frequent used method for most of SP plant 

parts (Figure 2.9B) and this was also observed by Alam et al. (2013). DPPH is often included 

in antioxidant studies as it is more rapid, simple and inexpensive when compared to other free 

radical scavenging methods. 

Regarding in vivo antioxidant estimation for the tuber plant part, lipid peroxidation assay (LPO) 

was the most used for tuber followed by reduced glutathione (GSH) estimation. The decreasing 

order for in vitro antioxidant methods used to study SP leaf were DPPH, RP, thiobarbituric acid 

method (TBA) and FRAP (Figure 2.9B). The antioxidant activity of SP peels was only 

published using the FRAP method so future research should include other methods as DPPH 

and RP for comparison purposes with other SP plant parts. The time series map of articles 

publication dates did not add significant information so it was not presented here. Therefore, 

there it was identified a knowledge gap between SP leaf and peel regarding in vitro antioxidant 

activities and also between DPPH assay and the other in vitro assays.  

 

2.3.4. Phenolic compounds determined in SP articles 

 

The phenolic composition of the different SP plant parts published in the selected articles was 

divided into two categories (Supplementary Table S2.5). Three spectrophotometric methods 

were considered for the global phenolic composition while individual compounds, obtained by 

methodologies as HPLC or LC, were grouped in four classes. The spectrophotometric methods 

considered were: total phenolic compounds (TPC), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and 

total flavonoid content (TFC). TPC and TMA results were more frequent for SP tuber while 

TFC was used in lesser extent (Figure 2.10A).

For leaves, the decreasing order of articles was TPC &gt; TFC &gt; TMA (Figure 2.10B). This order 

was different than the observed for the tuber as a result of the less number of articles for the 

purple variety for leaf so anthocyanin content was not as much determined. The individual 

compounds were grouped into hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonoids, 

flavonols and anthocyanins. Tuber presented more articles on anthocyanins composition than 

hydroxycinnamic acids, and no results for the other compounds groups were identified ((Figure 

2.10A). The other plant parts together covered the five groups of individual compounds and 

hydroxycinnamic acids were analysed for all the plant parts (Figure 2.10B). There was more 

articles with results on hydroxycinnamic acids from SP leaf followed by flavonols. 

Interestingly, stem was the third plant part with more results published while peel had only 

articles on TPC and hydroxycinnamic acids. Time series map of articles publication dates did 

not add significant information so it was not considered. Thus, there was a higher knowledge 

gap on phenolic compounds of SP peel than leaf that should be reduced by future research on 

the development of food applications with health benefits. 

 

2.3.5. Statistical analysis used in SP articles 

 

The statistical analysis used to examine the results of articles antioxidant activity of phenolic 

compounds from sweet potato were summarized into fifteen tools (Supplementary Table S2.6). 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan's post hoc test followed by Tukey’s test and 

correlation analysis were the most used statistical analysis for tuber plant part (Figure 2.11A). 

This resulted from the question of interest of articles was to evaluate whether one factor had a 

significant impact on the response variables. The usual procedure was to perform the analysis 

of variance to test whether the means of several groups are equal followed by post hoc tests to 

check the difference significance group by group. For SP leaf, analysis of variance, Student’s t 

test and correlation were the most used (Figure 2.11B).  

Analysis tools as principal component analysis, response surface methodology of factorial 

designs were absent or used in a reduced number of articles. Multivariate analysis tools, based 

upon statistics, provide a rigorous inferences from experimental data and an efficient and 

effective planning of experiments for product excellence (Joglekar &amp;amp; May, 1987). The use of 

design of experiments and multivariate statistical tools for the development of food applications 

with health benefits form SP leaf and peels will narrow this gap on statistical analysis.

2.3.6. Health benefits listed in SP articles 

 

The health benefits related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from sweet potato 

were summarized from the clinical and preclinical (animal) publication (Supplementary Table 

S2.7). SP tuber and leaf were the only plant parts used and leaf presented more clinical studies 

than tuber. In general, benefits of antioxidant activity were linked to the reduction of oxidative 

stress, anti-diabetic and anti-cancer functions and related to the brain and liver. Phenolic 

compounds from SP tuber, mostly anthocyanin fractions, decreased oxidative stress, modulated 

antioxidative status, enhanced antioxidant defence,  reduced  DNA  oxidation, decrease pro-

inflammatory cytokine secretion and presented cytoprotective activity against ?-radiation. 

Anticancer benefits included effects in preventing cancers namely colorectal cancer, growth 

suppression of cancer cells and apoptosis in prostate cancer. Benefits for the liver include the 

decrease the serum levels of biomarkers, attenuation of inflammatory response, attenuation of 

oxidative stress induced by D-galactose, attenuation of dimethylnitrosamine-induced injury, 

protection against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), protection on induced lipid accumulation 

and attenuates hepatic insulin resistance via blocking oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds via 

antioxidant activity imparted neuroprotection by attenuation of oxidative damage, amelioration 

of cognition deficits, and amelioration of inflammation in brain and also pretended enhancing 

effects in memory and spatial learning. Finally, SP tuber ameliorated diabetic disorders and 

presented anti-fatigue activity, and was also considered a treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 

They were active in reducing lipid oxidation and suppressing low-density lipoprotein oxidation. 

The health benefits related to SP leaf were obtained by clinical studies were enhancement of 

antioxidant defence, anticancer activity, and reduction of lipid oxidation, of DNA oxidation 

and of inflammation. Health benefits as anti-fatigue, antidiabetic activity and treatment of 

Alzheimer’s disease were established by animal testing. 

Tuber presented studies distributed in the range of 2003 to 2014 while SP leaf studies were 

published between 2007 and 2013 (Figure 2.12). There was no health benefits established for 

SP peel. Although the health benefits of peels could be inferred from its antioxidant activity 

and phenolic composition by comparison to the tuber, validation through clinical and 

preclinical (animal) studies will be necessary. The information regarding the health benefits in 

SP leaf should be tested for new food applications.

2.3.7. Food applications in SP articles  

 

Food applications in SP articles on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds were registered 

in Supplementary Table S2.8. Articles were distributed by a total of twenty five different food 

applications where flour/powder was in majority. For tuber, anthocyanin extracts and extracts 

were the second and third food applications, respectively (Figure 2.13A). Fermented (stems) 

and vinegar (from processing waste) were the only food applications not found for SP tuber. 

Articles that studied beverages based on SP tuber where in equal number as the boiling and as 

fresh products. Different home cooking preparations for tuber, as boiling, steaming, stir frying 

(sautée), baked, frying, microwaving or roasted were already addressed, although in a reduced 

number. SP tuber presented different products in the beverage category, such as alcoholic 

drinks (excluding wine), wine, nectar and a lactic acid beverage. Food applications for the other 

plant parts were much less miscellaneous than for the tuber with only eleven different products 

(Figure 2.13B). As for SP tuber, flour/powder was the most classified food type for leaf 

followed by extract. 

The distribution in time of the different food applications was represented in Figure 2.14. 

Globally, SP flour/powder was predominant over the over food application, with more number 

of studies in the period 2010 to 2013. A large increase in articles about the SP flour/powder 

form was observed from 2009 to 2010 but in 2014 number decreased abruptly. There was no 

positive trend for any food application from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, the food applications that 

were more mentioned in articles were extract and anthocyanin extract. There is a lack of studies 

on food applications for other SP plant parts than tuber or leaf. Research on applications for the 

valorisation of SP wastes, a flour/powder or a beverage could benefits from knowledge 

accumulated for tuber. 

 

2.3.8. Food applications in SP patents 

 

Food applications of SP with antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds reported in patents 

were summarized in Supplementary Table S2.9. The number of different products – 43 – was 

higher than the one obtained for articles. The product with more patents application for tuber 

was a beverage followed by pasta (that including noodles products) (Figure 2.15A).

Although flour/powder products were the main food application found in articles, it ranked 6th 

for patents. As expected, the traditional home cooking preparations for tuber were absent in the 

patent food applications. The beverage food category comprised more different products for 

patents than for articles as juice, beer and liquor. SP tuber was also mentioned for healthy foods, 

functional foods and supplements. As observed for articles, patented food applications for the 

other SP plant parts were less miscellaneous than for tuber with only seven different products 

(Figure 2.15B). For SP leaf, extracts were the most patented food application followed by beer. 

Three products that were patented for leaf – essence, fiber and pickle – were absent in tuber. 

The time series map of patents’ date of publication was represented in Figure 2.16 for food 

applications with more than nine patents in the period 2003-2014. Until 2007 there were only 

published 7 patents on phenolic compounds and/or antioxidant activity of SP. Beverages 

patents grew in number from 2007to 2011. In 2014, the food applications that presented a 

positive trend were healthy foods, pasta, flour/powder and beverage.

Research on new food development of beverage or extract for SP wastes as leaf and peel has 

the potential to be protected by a patent due to the reduced number of food applications.  

 

2.3.9. Text mining 

 

HCA and co-occurrence analysis were performed on statistics obtained by text mining pre-

treatment of abstracts of selected articles and patents for the period 2003 to 2014. The words 

selected were nouns and adjectives with a minimum term and document frequencies of 23 for 

articles and 34 for patents Dendograms obtained by HCA revealed five word groups for both 

articles and patents and two major themes were considered based on words frequency. For 

articles abstracts, “sweet” and “potato” presented the closest similarity in Group 1 with higher 

term frequencies (1st main theme) (Figure 2.17A). “Acid” was the word more related to “sweet 

potato” within the group. This may be associated to the different phenolic compounds that did 

not enter in the analysis due to the criteria applied to term and document frequencies. For the 



Chapter 2

same reason, although “phenolic” ranked high in adjectives frequency (5th) the word did not 

enter in the representation. “Total content” was next to “sweet potato” and “acid”. The other 

words in Group 1 group were “antioxidant activity” that were closely related to “result” and 

“effect”. The second group of words with higher frequencies (2nd main theme) was formed by 

“anthocyanin”, “purple”, level”, “concentration” and “treatment” (Group 2). Patents 

dendogram presented a group of words (Group 1) with much higher frequencies than the others 

(Figure 2.17B). “Purple sweet potato”, “anthocyanins” and “raw material” were the central 

subject of patents (1st main theme). The 2nd main theme was connected to patent food 

applications namely “food”, “powder”, “weight” and “effect”.  

Co-occurrence networks patterns high-frequency words occurring together and identify content 

communities. Words are depicted as nodes with a size proportional to their frequency in the 

documents. Nodes are linked by edges when they occur together and their thickness is 

proportional to the strength of co-occurrence between them. For articles abstracts, three content 

communities were detected (Figure 2.18A). The community that included the words “sweet” 

and “potato” was located at the centre of the network (number 1). The words “total”, “acid”, 

“phenolic” and “content” were located closely in this group and presented high co-occurrence. 

The words “activity” and “effect” belonged to the “sweet potato” group but “antioxidant” and 

“results” formed a small community on their own (number 2) with several links to core group. 

“Purple” and “anthocyanin” made a community (number 3) that also was linked by several 

edges to words of the main group. “DPPH” was a satellite node only linked to the word 

“activity”. The co-occurrence network for patents abstracts presented a different configuration 

than the one built for articles (Figure 2.18B). Four communities were identified. “Purple”, 

“sweet” and “potato” belonged to the larger community (number 1) and were closely located 

and strongly linked. The words “raw”, “material”, “effect”, “weight” and “powder” also 

belonged to this community. All the other three communities in the network were linked to the 

“purple sweet potato” community but not among each other.

2.4. Conclusions 

 

From the main food applications found in articles and patents for the period 2003-2014, the 

development of a flour/powder or a beverage could benefit from the knowledge already built 

for the tuber. As the strategy of combining different SP plant parts presented a low intensity in 

the period of time studied, it could be undertaken in future research. Rather than using result 

means comparison tools as verified for the tuber, the use of design of experiments and 

multivariate statistical tools during new food development could narrow efficiently the 

knowledge gap found for peels and leaves. Design responses should include DPPH assay 

combined with other in vitro antioxidant assays and the determination of phenolic compounds 

by spectrophotometric methods as well the content of individual anthocyanins and 

hydroxycinnamic acids. These results could shape further research on health benefits, expected 

to be related to the reduction of oxidative stress and improvement of brain and liver functions. 

Although these health benefits could be inferred from the antioxidant activity and phenolic 

composition of peels and leaves by comparison to the tuber, validation through clinical and 

preclinical (animal) studies will be necessary. In addition, text mining applied only to abstract 

texts revealed the main research features of articles and claims of patents on antioxidant activity 

of phenolic compounds of sweet potato. Dendograms and co-occurrence networks form text 

mining analysis may be useful to compare future research lines patterns and trends.

Abstract 

Sweet potato (SP) has long been used as food and in traditional medicine. For the first time, 

total antioxidant activity (TAA), reducing power (RP), ferric-reducing antioxidant power 

(FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant activities from European 

sweet potato vines holding a Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) were studied through a 

factorial design. Plant part was the main influential factor followed by solvent acidification. 

Principal component analysis revealed total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, FRAP 

and RP assays more related to sample differences (stems or leaves) and DPPH to extraction 

conditions, namely solvent acidification. The in vitro antioxidant activities of leaves were 1.25 

g AAE/100 g dw for TAA and 50.8 g GAE/100 g dw for RP. DPPH scavenging activity was 

higher than FRAP (i.e., 58.6 and 29.3 and mM Trolox/g dw, respectively). Stems results were 

1.3 to 9.2 times lower than leaves. These outcomes confirmed SP leaves a potential resource of 

antioxidants in the human diet that may add supplementary value to PGI agriculture products. 

 

 

Practical application 

Vines, especially leaves, from PGI sweet potatoes could be advantageously used as a natural 

source of antioxidants, with potential to be used as a food in the diet. Focus on sweet potato of 

European origin may contribute to increase interest on its cultivation and consumption. In 

addition, insights on the potential added value present in Protected Geographic Indication (PGI)

agriculture products may enhance protected demonization turnover for producers. Industries 

that pursuit food with functional applications may consider sweet potato vines in their new 

product development processes, aiming for health benefits.  

 

 

 

3.1. Introduction 

 

Consumer demand for foods that contain health-promoting components beyond traditional 

nutrients has stove interest in functional foods (Carvalho et al. 2006, 2010). Sweet potato (SP) 

(Ipomoea batatas L. Lam.) can be considered per se a functional food due to its appreciable 

amounts of biological active compounds, such as polyphenols. It is a traditional food in many 

countries where not only tubers but also vines, raw or cooked, are also commonly consumed 

(Lako et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2009; Isabelle et al. 2010). Polyphenols present in SP leaves 

were related to antioxidative/radical scavenging activity physiological functions (Islam et al. 

2002) that could prevent or moderate oxidative stress-related diseases. They showed the highest 

polyphenol content (5.35 g gallic acid equivalent/100 g dw) among 12 vegetables, near twice 

the content of purslane (Portulaca oleraceae) and three times of green onions (Allium 

fistulosum) (Huang et al. 2009). Phenolic compounds associated with antioxidant activity of SP 

leaf extracts are flavonoids (Chu et al. 2000; Islam et al. 2002) and phenolic acids (Islam 2006; 

Truong et al. 2007). High in vitro antioxidant activity of SP leaves correlates with these 

compounds, with several potential food applications (Islam 2006). Extraction conditions are a 

key parameter in the determination of antioxidant activity. Besides solid–solvent ratio and 

temperature, time of contact and pH can affect the efficiency extraction of antioxidants, and it 

is relevant to study their main effects and interactions. SP origin in published studies is mostly 

from Asia, which in 2009 cultivated 82 % of total world production, Africa and America. To 

our knowledge, no studies were published on the antioxidant activity of SP leaves from Europe. 

Although this region produced only 0.06 % of world crop, mainly at the Iberia Peninsula, it 

was the second best-performing region in culture yield (FAOSTAT 2009). In addition, vines 

from SP with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) have not been studies yet. The European 

Union PGI status is used to denote agricultural products and foods closely linked to a 

geographical area, where they are produced and/or processed and/or prepared (European 

Commission Agriculture and Rural Development 2010). As SP from Portugal has this 



Chapter 3

Food Applications and Health Benefits 
89 

 

denomination, the vines used in this study have two novelty features, Europe origin and PGI 

status. The objectives of the present study were to study antioxidant activity of vines of SP with 

a European PGI denomination and analyze the effects of vine part, time and solvent. Correlation 

between total phenolic content and antioxidant activities was also assed. These results may 

contribute to raise interest in SP vines produced in Europe and its potential for use as a 

functional food or ingredient. In addition, it may signal extra value present in PGI agriculture 

products for turnover improvement.

Plant material was collected from SP plants (Lira variety) from Aljezur (Portugal) that holds a 

PGI status (European Union 2008). SP vines used as propagation material were collected at an 

early morning of July and kept in an isothermal container during transport to the laboratory 

within 1.5 h. Vines had green-purple stems and stalks, and green glabrous with entire shape 

leaves. Each vine was cut into three equal parts; and leaves, stalks and stems were cut after 

forming three groups: the upper (younger), middle and bottom sections of the vine. The plant 

material used in this study was from the bottom section, where stem length was between 15 

and 38 cm, average of 25 cm, with two to six leaves, average of four. Leaves and stems were 

stored in open trays at 10C and relative humidity of 95 % (S600 PLH phitoclim, Aralab, Rio 

de Mouro, Portugal) for 48 h. Whole leaves and stems were cut in portions of 1.5 cm 

approximately, dried in monolayer regime at 60C in a Binder BD 53 incubator (Binder, 

Tuttilgen, Germany) for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. After cooling in an exsiccator, samples 

were grounded to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, and stored in sealed glass tubes at 

4C until analysis. Moisture loss during drying was of 76.49 ± 3.09 and 80.07 ± 0.04 % for 

leaves and stems, respectively. 

 

3.2.4. Extraction of Antioxidants 

 

Plant extracts were prepared by the addition of 1 mL of 80 % aqueous methanol to 0.05 g of 

dried plant material; tubes were sealed, involved in aluminum foil, vortexed and kept in an 

orbital shaker (Edmund Buhler Gmg H-Ks 15, Hechingen, Germany) at a 45° angle for 24 h at 

37C. The same conditions of extraction were used in the second and third extractions, after 

tubes were centrifuged (Hettich Universal 320, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 3,000 ¥ g for 10 min. 

Solvent was decanted, and 0.75 mL of fresh solvent was added to plant material. The volume 

of solvent used per extraction experiment was collected in glass tubes, filtered and diluted to a 

final volume of 5 mL of extract, with solid: solvent ratio of 1:100. Extracts were hold at 4 ºC 

until analysis. 

 

3.2.5. Total Phenolic Content and Total Flavonoid Content 

 

Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were determined according to 

methods described by Huang et al. (2006), with slight modifications. A calibration curve of 

gallic acid in the range of 12.5–100 mg/mL (r2 = 0.995) was constructed, and the TPC was 



Chapter 3 

 
Antioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:

91 

 

expressed as g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) in 100 g of dried material. TFC was quantified 

from a standard calibration curve that was constructed in the range of 7–55 g/mL of quercetin 

(r2 = 0.9991), and results were expressed in g of quercetin equivalent (QE) by 100 g of dry 

weight. 

 

2.3.6. Antioxidant Activity 

 

Four different methods were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. Total antioxidant activity 

(TAA) was assayed by phosphomolybdenum method according to Prieto et al. (1999), with 

slight modifications. A linear calibration curve for acid ascorbic in the range of 28–201 mg/mL 

(r2 = 0.9992) was constructed, and results were expressed as g of ascorbic acid equivalent 

(AAE) in 100 g of dry material. Reducing power (RP) determination was made by ferricyanide 

method described by Huang et al. (2010), with minor modifications. A calibration curve for 

acid gallic was made at the range of 200 and 540 mg/mL of gallic acid, with a regression 

coefficient of 0.9997, and results were expressed in g GAE per 100 g of dried material. 

The method described by Benzie and Strain (1996) was used the determination of ferric-

reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), with some modifications. An aliquot of 200 mL was added 

to 3 mL of FRAP reagent (buffer acetate 300 mM, pH 3.6; 40 mM of HCl; 10 mM of TPTZ 

and 20 mM ferric chloride). After the mixture stood at 20C for 4 min in the dark, the absorbance 

at 593 nm was measured against a blank. A calibration curve for Trolox was made in the range 

of 50 and 175 mM, with a regression coefficient of 0.9991 (data not shown), and results were 

expressed in mM Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry weight. 

Free radical DPPH scavenging capacity was determined by the method of Brand-Williams et 

al. (1995), where 2 mL of 0.15 mM DPPH was added to 100 mL of extract (at adequate 

dilutions) or Trolox. Tubes were sealed, vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature 

during 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A calibration curve for Trolox was made 

in the range of 100 and 800 mM, with a regression coefficient of 0.996, and results were 

expressed in mM TE per gram of dry weight. 

 

3.2.7. Statistical Analysis 

 

Design Expert ver. 6.0.0 software (Stat-Ease 2000) was used to plan a complete factorial 2 x 3 

x 2 experimental design, with three replicates. Plant part (factor A) was tested at two levels 



Chapter 3 

 
Antioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  

Food Applications and Health Benefits 
92 

 

(stems or leaves), and solvent (factor C) varied as acidified or non-acidified 80 % aqueous 

methanol. Time (factor B) was tested at three levels: 24, 48 or 72 h. The magnitude and 

significance of main (A, B and C), two interactions (AB, AC and BC) and the three interaction 

(ABC) effects were accessed by regression analysis of variance (ANOVA). Magnitude of 

effects was accessed by the percentage of contribution of each model term relative to the sum 

of squares, and significant terms were confirmed by respective values. Refined models were 

obtained after removal non-significant terms, exclusion of influential results and power 

transformation to comply with ANOVA assumptions. R2 and adjusted R2 were also used to 

verify model adequacy. A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using SPSS 

software, version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), after Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) and 

Bartlett’s tests, in order to analyze correlation between dependent variables and confirm 

patterns in data. 

 

 

3.3. Results and discussion 

 

Extraction of plant polyphenols is a key step for polyphenol and antioxidant activity 

determinations; and important factors, like plant part (factor A), time (factor B) and solvent 

(factor C), need to be assessed in order to evaluate its impact on antioxidant activity. Plant part 

was elected as a factor as different color of stems (green-purple) and leaves (leaves) were 

indicative of the presence of different compounds and possibly different antioxidant activities. 

Time and solvent may have conflicting actions on the solubilization and degradation of 

polyphenols (Robards 2003) and were included in the design to study factor interaction. Time 

associated with boiling or stirring extraction methods for SP. leaves varied from 5 min (Huang 

et al. 2010) to 24 h (Carvalho et al. 2010) (Table 3.1). To study the effect of longer times, 

extraction was allowed for 24, 48 and 72 h. Extraction with acidic solvents may release 

compounds initially part of polymers or bounded to others. It may also contribute to the 

solubilization and diffusion of phenolic compounds due to cell wall disintegration. In addition, 

the use of water in combination with organic solvents ensures the extraction of polyphenols 

due to the creation of a moderately polar medium. Enhanced recovering of polyphenols from 

plant material, including flavonols with low polymerization degree, had been reported (Robards 

2003). From the different acidification/solvent combinations reported for SP vines, it was 

chosen to test acidified or non-acidified 80 % methanol.

3.3.1. Full and Reduced Factorial Models 

 

According to Table 3.2, main effect plant part (A) was dominant for TPC, TFC, RP and FRAP 

results, with a percentage of contribution of total variability higher than 75 %, and highly 

significant (P &amp;lt;0.001). For DPPH, solvent (factor C) as main effect explained 71 % of result 

variability. Full-model ANOVA analysis exposed interaction between plant part and solvent 

(AC) to be significant for all assays although more important for TAA. Interaction plant part–

time (AB) was only significant for RP. For TFC, interactions time– solvent (AC) to be 

significant for all assays although more important for TAA. Interaction plant part–time (AB) 

was only significant for RP. For TFC, interactions time–solvent (BC) and plant part–time–

solvent (ABC) were still significant (P &amp;lt;0.05), but with small contribution in explaining 

variability. In order to comply with ANOVA assumptions, TFC, TAA and DPPH results were 

modified by square root or inverse square root power transformation. TFC refined model 

confirmed only plant part and solvent as significant effects. Adequacy of final models was also 

confirmed by high R2 values with similar adjusted R2 results. 

 

 

3.3.2. Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on TPC and TFC 

 

For TPC and TFC, plant part presented a highly significant positive effect on TPC and TFC 

estimated means (Figure 3.1). Solvent had effect on both assays, but in lesser magnitude than 

plant part. Non-acidified solvent increased TPC for stems, but for leaves, it had an opposite 

effect. Solvent effect on TFC results was lower than those observed for TPC. Therefore, 

acidification of 80 % methanol enhanced extraction of polyphenolic compounds from leaves, 

but not flavonoid content. Opposite behavior was observed for stems.

3.3.3. Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on TAA and RP 

 

Solvent and time have different effects on the magnitude and significance of TAA and RP 

antioxidant measurements. As TAA was transformed by inverse square root function, graphical 

interpretation should be done accordingly. Therefore, solvent affected more leaves than stems 

results, and higher antioxidant activity was observed for acidified solvent in comparison with 

non-acidified solvent (Figure 3.2).

solvent. Different letters indicate significant different values at p &amp;lt;0.05. 
 

 

 

For RP, interaction of plant part with solvent had the same direction but different magnitude 

than TPC. Thus, other compounds than those quantified by the Folin–Ciocalteau method 

contribute to the reducing power of stems. Time influenced only leaves results and had a 

positive effect. As time did not affect influenced only leaves results and had a positive effect. 

As time did not affect neither TPC nor TFC, this enhanced reduced power was possibly not 

associated with polyphenols or flavonoids influenced only leaves results and had a positive 

effect. As time did not affect neither TPC nor TFC, this enhanced reduced power was possibly 

not associated with polyphenols or flavonoids.

3.3.4. Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on FRAP and DPPH 

 

FRAP plant part–solvent (AC) interaction (Figure 3.3) presented a behavior similar to TPC but 

not to RP, as would be expected because RP and FRAP assays are based on similar reaction 

mechanisms (Berker et al. 2009). Solvent had more effect than plant part on DPPH, for both 

stems and leaves. Lower results obtained for acidified solvent may be related to slower reaction 

time leading to less radical scavenging activity. The same differences were observed for 

acidified and non-acidified 50 % methanol (Pérez-Jiménez and Saura-Calixto 2006). 

 

3.3.5. Variables Correlations and Pattern in Data 

 

For SP leaves, high correlations between TPC/TAA, TPC/RP (Gupta and Prakash 2008) and 

TPC/DPPH (Truong et al. 2007) were reported. To evaluate how these correlations were 

affected in this study, PCA was performed. PCA was appropriate as all two-pair variables. 

Pearson correlation coefficients were significant at a 0.05 level, KMO statistic was higher than 

0.5 and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant. Two components that explained 97 % of 

data variability were extracted. According to the loading plot (Figure 3.4A), all variables were 

strong positively correlated to the first component (PC1). TFC, TPC, RP and FRAP were more 

correlated as they were more close to the PC1 axis than TAA or DPPH. DPPH was positively 

highly correlated with PC2 and TAA negatively correlated at the same component. Data pattern 

from score plot (Figure 3.4B) confirmed plant part as the major influential factor, as PC1 

separated stems and leaves results. PC2, which split data in acidified and non-acidified solvent, 

relates more to DPPH. 

 

3.3.6. Antioxidant Activity of SP Leaves and Stems 

 

Caution should be taken when comparing antioxidant activity data, as difference in method, 

solvent and analytical conditions may lead to very diverse results. For comparison purposes, 

results obtained with 24 h time and non-acidified solvent will be used (Table 3.3, in bold). TPC 

for European SP leaves and stems were 1.22 and 0.60 g GAE/100 g dw, respectively.

These values are lower than those published, which ranged from 0.85 and 5.35 g GAE/100 g 

dw from Fiji (Lako et al. 2007) and the U.S.A. (Huang et al. 2009), respectively. Besides the 

influence of genotype and edaphic–climatic conditions, this study included a fresh storage 

(Table 3.1) prior to analysis that may have contributed to these lower results. TFC for SP leaves 

(0.59 g QE/100 g dw and 0.064 g QE/100 dw) (Table 3.3) were also lower than those reported 

for leaves from China, 1.85 mg/100 g. (Chu et al. 2000). Still, European SP leaves had higher 

TPC than broccoli or spring onion (Isabelle et al. 2010), while SP stems were superior to lettuce 

or cucumber (Lako et al. 2007). As SP leaves and stems had FRAP results lower than DPPH 

(Table 3.3), samples had radical scavenging activity superior to metal-ion-reducing power. SP 

leaves from this study had higher FRAP results than peas, similar to carrots, but lower than 

broccoli (Ou et al. 2002). FRAP determined in this study for SP stems is higher than onions 

and peas. DPPH results were very different than those reported for SP leaves, with activities 

between 199 and 227 mM TE/g dw (Truong et al. 2007). However, even with a storage step 

prior to analysis, SP leaves and stems had higher DPPH activity than onions (Gorinstein et al. 

2009). These results confirm that leaves and stems from European SP could be considered as a 

potential supplementary resource of antioxidants in human diet and have additional value added 

for PGI agricultural products. 

 

 

3.4. Conclusion 

 

Plant part (stems or leaves) presented the largest main significant effect (P &amp;lt;0.001) for all 

assays, while for DPPH activity was the most influential factor. Time of extraction had the only 

significant effect on RP assay, as main effect and interaction with plant part. Although factors 

selected present different effects on assays, variables were highly correlated in a principal 

component that explained 78 % of data variability. European SP vines, especially leaves, can 

be considered as a natural source of antioxidants, with potential to be used as a food in the diet 

or as ingredient for functional applications aiming for health benefits. It explains how extra 

values may be present in PGI agriculture products with possible turnover of positive 

contribution. In this study, leaves and stems were from the bottom section of the SP vines that 

were stored for 48 h (10 ºC and 95 % RH) prior to analysis.

Abstract 

Sweet potato peels usually considered as waste in food service operations may be 

upgraded into value added functional foods with high phenolic content and antioxidant 

activity. The effect of nine extraction variables was identified as relevant in previous 

phenolics extraction studies, because solvent solid ratio, time, pH, peeling cut depth, 

particle size, temperature, solvent, sample amount and agitation were combined in a 12 

run Plackett–Burman design to screen for key factors. The extraction of phenolic 

compounds was only significantly (p &amp;lt;0.05) affected by solvent: solid ratio (positively) 

and peel cut depth (negatively) with similar effect magnitude. These factors effects 

presented similar direction, size and significance on extracts antioxidant activity 

measured by FRAP. Regression models on FRAP transformed by squared root function 

revealed the two factor interaction peel cut depth and sample amount as the third most 

influencing factor. Beyond the usage of sweet potato peels as a new constituent for human 

food, it should also be tested for ingredient optimized in the production of functional 

foods.

4.1. Introduction 

 

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) ranked as 3rd in the root and tubers crops world 

production in 2010 (FAO, 2010). It was identified as an excellent novel source of natural 

health promoting for the functional food market (Bovell-Benjamin, 2007). Sweet potato 

roots and leaves contain biologically active compounds with significant medicinal value 

as antioxidant properties that might beneficiate human health (Huang et al., 2006). This 

crop was already claimed in patented functional compositions related to suppression of 

intestinal cancer (Iwasaki, 2003) and anti-aging food (McDaniel, 2011). Although usually 

treated as waste, sweet potato peels (SPP) had also received attention for food and feed 

application as they possessed high levels of phenolics (Zhu et al., 2010) and can reach 

almost three times more antioxidant activity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals 

and Cisneros-Zevallos, 2002). It was recently demonstrated in animal models that SPP 

possessed a potent wound healing activity possibility associated to an underlying 

antioxidant mechanism (Panda et al., 2011). In addition, SPP extracts might be beneficial 

against Alzheimer’s disease as it reduced the level of lipid peroxidation and increased 

catalase activities in biochemical studies using the brain tissue of mice (Kim et al., 2011). 

These findings reinforce the drive for recycling agro industry wastes as peels into valuable 

adding products (Peschel et al., 2006), namely at the post-harvest and peeling steps of the 

supply chain. Losses during storage and transportation reached 6.3 % of 2007 sweet 

potato world production. Regarding peeling, industrial operations  reduced by 2 % and 

14 % the root fresh mass with steam and lye-peeling methods, respectively (Van Hal, 

2000). Values higher than 18 % waste reported for abrasion peeling of potatoes (Singh 

and Shukla, 1995) are expected for sweet varieties, as roots are usually more irregular. In 

food service sector, preparation losses mainly due to peels from tubers and vegetables 

ranged from 3 to 8 % of the food delivered (Engstrom and Carlsson-Kanyama, 2004). 

The development process aiming peels valorisation needs inputs on the extraction of 

compounds with potential health-promoting and/or disease-preventing properties. 

Plackett–Burman designs (PBDs) have been used to study the influence of a large number 

of factors on phenolic compounds extraction with a small number of experimental trials 

(Dopico-Garcia et al., 2007; Luque-Rodríguez et al., 2007; Priego-Capote et al., 2004). 

While focused in identifying main effects, PBD may provide information on two factors 

interactions and increase research efficiency (Phoa et al., 2009). The objective of this

study was to screen by PBD the factors that alone or combined influence the extraction 

of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity from SPP obtained as waste in food 

service operations. 

 

 

4.2. Materials and methods 

 

4.2.1. Reagents 

 

Ferric chloride (Merck); Folin Ciocalteau reagent (Merck); gallic acid (Fluka); glacial 

acetic acid (BDH-Prolabo); hydrochloric acid (Riedel); sodium acetate (Merk); Sodium 

carbonate (Merk); trichloroacetic acid (BDH-Prolabo); 2,4,6-tripyridyl-2- triazine 

(TPTZ) (Sigma); Trolox (Sigma Aldrich). 

 

4.2.2. Plant material 

 

Sweet potatoes were purchased at the market and transported to the lab on the same day. 

SPs were washed under tap water and air dried during the night. Roots were twice hand 

peeled in one direction with a cut depth circa 1.5 mm, corresponding to 8.4 ± 2.1 and 7.8 

± 2.0 % of fresh root for the first and second layer, respectively. Peels were dried at 60 

?C during 48 h, milled and classified into two different sizes, all less than 200 µ m (70 

mesh) and all less than 600 µ m (30 mesh). 

 

4.2.3. Extraction process 

 

Twelve treatments were made in triplicate employing the experimental plan as depicted 

in Table 4.1. Dried SPP varied in the layer depth of the hand cut (factor D) and particle 

size (factor E). Extracts were prepared at the programmed solvent: solid ratio (factor A) 

by the addition of proper solvent (factor G), acidified or not (factor C) taking the solid 

sample scale (factor H) in account. Tubes or Erlenmeyer’s were sealed, involved in 

aluminum foil, and kept in an orbital shaker (Edmund Buhler Gmg H-Ks 15, Germany) 

at 45? angle with agitation (factor J), time (factor B) and temperature (factor F) according 

to the experimental plan.

After centrifugation (Hettich Universal 320, DJB Lovecare, United Kingdom) at 3000 × 

g for 10 min, extract was filtered and diluted to proper final volume. Extracts were hold 

at ?18 ?C until analysis. 

 

4.2.4. Evaluation of extracts 

 

Total phenolic content (TPC) was determined according to methods described by Huang 

et al. (2006) with slight modifications. A calibration curve of gallic acid in the range 12.5–

100 µ g/mL (R2 = 0.995) was constructed, and the TPC was expressed as g gallic acid 

equivalent (GAE) in 100 g of dried material. Ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) 

was according to the method described by Benzie and Strain (1999) was used, with some 

modifications. An aliquot of 200 l was added to 3 mL of FRAP reagent (buffer acetate 

300 mM, pH 3.6; 40 mM of HCl; 10 mM of TPTZ and 20 mM ferric chloride). After the 

mixture stood at 20 ?C for 4 min in the dark, the absorbance at 593 nm was measured 

against a blank. A calibration curve for Trolox was made at the range of 50 and 175 µ M 

with a regression coefficient of 0.9991 (data not shown) and results were expressed in 

µ M Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry weight. All absorbance readings were made 

in a T70+ UV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom). 

 

4.2.5. Statistical analysis 

 

A 12 run non-geometric PBD with nine factors and two dummy variables were varied at 

two levels in a combined pattern of Hamada and Wu matrices (Table 1). Average of 

responses TPC and FRAP were obtained from treatment replicates (three). Data analysis 

was performed by first determining main effects size and significance followed by 

regression analysis for the assessment of two factor interactions. 

 

4.2.5.1. Main effects 

 

Significant main effects were assessed by half-probability plots, Lenth’s method and 

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In halfprobability plots, the absolute values of the nine 

main effect estimates were plotted against half-normal scores. Scale was defined by 

partitioning the right half of the normal distribution in nine parts of equal area. In the 

presence of a small number of active main effects, inactive factors scores should follow

a straight line and the active ones should look like outliers (Heyden et al., 2001). Lenth’s 

method determined a pseudo standard error that was plotted in a standardized Pareto chart 

obtained by dividing the absolute value of the estimated effects by the standard error 

(Zhao et al., 2011). Evidence of a significant effect was given when respective bar extents 

Lenth’s distance. In addition, ANOVA at a 95 % significant level and Hierarquical 

Cluster Analysis (HCA) using between groups linkage method with Euclidean distance 

were performed to aid interpretation (Tyssedal and Niemi, 2011). 

 

4.2.5.2. Two factors interaction 

 

When the number of significant main effects was not too large, regression analysis was 

used to investigate two-factor interactions (2FI’s) based on Phoa et al. (2009) research. 

First, all main factors identified by previous approaches and all possible two factors 

interactions were submitted to a forward method selection during regression analysis and 

variables with a confidence level higher than 95 % were considered as significant. 

Second, all main effects are added to the model again and a new variable selection was 

performed. New two factors interactions on the model were analysed again for 

significance. Process was repeated until goodness of fit indices, as squared coefficient of 

determination (R2), adjusted squared coefficient of determination (R2Ajd) and regression 

standard deviation measured by mean squared error (MSE) stopped changing. When it 

was necessary to distinguish between competing models, residual analysis was done. 

Backward and stepwise methods were also used for comparison purposes. Design Expert 

6.0.11 (Stat-Ease Corporation, Minneapolis, USA) was used for all statistical analyses 

except cluster analysis performed by PASW Statistic 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, 

USA).

4.3. Results and discussion 

 

4.3.1. Factors selection 

 

The selection of factors to be included in the screening design was based on variables tested in 

comparative, screening and optimization studies on polyphenols extraction with different plant 

materials and methods (Table 4.2). Temperature, time, solvent and solvent: solid ratio were 

included in most of the studies. For temperature, all situations were observed: positive effect 

(Molan et al., 2009; Luque-Rodríguez et al., 2007; Santos and Meireles, 2011; Han et al., 2011), 

negative (Çam and Hisil, 2010; Dopico-Garcia et al., 2007; Ghafoor et al., 2010), positive and 

negative depending on solvent used (Guerrero et al., 2008) and no effect (Priego-Capote et al., 

2004). Time presented always a significant positive effect on TPC with one exception (C¸ am 

and Hisil, 2010). The effect of solvent: solid ratio also varied, positive (Borges et al., 2011; Han 

et al., 2011) or negative (Molan et al., 2009). When studied, the increase of pH affected TPC 

negatively. Factors as peeling cut depth (Padda and Picha, 2008), particle size (Çam and Hisil, 

2010), amount of sample (Luque-Rodríguez et al., 2007) and agitation (Molan et al., 2009) were 

studied in much lesser extent, both alone or combined with other factors. Therefore, all nine 

factors presented in Table 2 were included in a PBD to screen respective effect on aqueous 

extraction of TPC from dried SPP. FRAP assay was also included to compare extraction 

efficiency with antioxidant activity. 

 

4.3.2. Factors levels 

 

Factors levels were defined in line with food service operational constraints and conventional 

solid liquid extractions (Table 1). Solvent solid ratio varied from 10 to 50, with the objective to 

assess influence at the approximate middle range for studies with opposite conclusions (Molan 

et al., 2009; Borges et al., 2011). Time of contact had 2-h span and ranged from 60 to 180 min 

to assess longer time effects than those used in previous studies (Çam and Hisil, 2010; Molan 

et al., 2009; Luque-Rodríguez et al., 2007; Chirinos et al., 2007; Borges et al., 2011; Han et al., 

2011). To gather information on the effect of pH higher than 5, neutral pH was tested in addition 

to the acidic conditions reported as favourable to phenolics extraction (Luque-Rodríguez et al., 

2007; Chirinos et al., 2007). Root cut depth was related to layer thickness obtained by hand 

peeling, included in the study as previous studies reported that Phenolic compounds in sweet

potato were mainly present at the outer 5 mm of tissue of the root (Van Hal, 2000). The effect 

of using different cuts in food service operations was accessed by analysis peels obtained from 

1.5 or 3.0 mm cut depths, phenolic compounds were mainly present at the outer 5 mm of tissue 

of the sweet potato root (Van Hal, 2000). Particle size was varied considering the availability 

of one only sieve mesh, 0.2 or 0.6 mm. Temperature levels tested (27 or 40 ?C) were both in 

the mild range in the attempt to reduce both phenolics degradation and energy costs. For the 

solvent factor, tap water available in food service operations was tested in opposition to distilled 

one normally used in extraction studies. With the purpose to rationalize further optimization 

studies, the effect of scale on the bioactives extraction was ascertained by sample weight at 0.1 

or 1 g. Finally, agitation was varied between reduced and high rotations for quantification of 

factor effect. 

 

4.3.3. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity 

 

TPC of SPP varied between 1.02 ± 0.20 and 6.21 ± 0.30 mg GAE/g dw (Table 1) which was 

encouraging for conventional solid liquid extraction. This range was higher than results 

reported for mashua tubers (0.2 mg GAE/g dw) by conventional extraction (Chirinos et al., 

2007) and for fruit skins (3.5 mg GAE/g dw) by more friendly phenolic extraction methods 

(Santos and Meireles, 2011). However, SPP presented lower TPC than other vegetables wastes, 

as cucumber (?18 mg GAE/g dw) or artichoke (?11 mg GAE/g dw) (Peschel et al., 2006). A 

wider variation for FRAP results was observed in comparison to TPC with a range of 0.71–8.11 

µ M TE/g dw. Pearson correlation between TPC and FRAP was 0.77 (p &amp;lt;0.01) that was in line 

with correlations reported by Molan et al. (2009). 

 

4.3.3.1. Main effects 

 

Half-normal probability plot for TPC (Figure 4.1A) revealed solvent: solid ratio (factor A) and 

cut depth (factor D) as possible active effects as they deviate from a straight line through formed 

by the remaining non-significant factors normally distributed around zero. Lenth’s method 

confirmed these two factors as active (Figure 4.1B) with a threshold significance of 0.01, 

indicated by ANOVA results (Table 3).

For FRAP, no factor was selected by both graphical methods (Figure 4.1C and D) but ANOVA 

identified the same key factors for TPC although with less significance. HCA confirmed 

solvent: solid and cut depth and significant main effects for TPC by way of them formed a 

group with lower distance (more similarities) as depicted in Figure 4.2A. As three factors 

groups could be identified (Tyssedal and Niemi, 2011) possible two factor interactions were 

investigated in regression analysis. For FRAP, solvent: solid ratio and peel cut depth formed 

the group with less similarities (Figure 4.2B) underlying differences from TPC. 

 

 

4.3.3.2. Factors interactions 

 

No significant interactions were identified for TPC by forward (?in = 0.05) or stepwise (?in = 

?out = 0.05) selection during regression analysis (Figure 4.3A). In decreasing absolute size 

effect, backward method (?out = 0.05) revealed significant interactions of solvent: solid ratio 

with pH &gt; particle size &gt; solvent &gt; time &gt; agitation &gt; temperature. However, model presented 

lower R2Ajd and higher MSE than forward and stepwise procedures. Therefore, the calculus 

approach used in this study did not identify factors interactions beside two main effects for

TPC. Regarding magnitude, phenolic compounds extraction was enhanced by higher solvent 

solid ratios for emerging technologies (Borges et al., 2011; Han et al., 2011) but not by 

conventional method (Molan et al., 2009). Cut depth negative effect was also observed 

previously by Padda and Picha (2008). As standardized residuals departed from normality (data 

not shown), FRAP data transformation by log function was required.

identification (A–J) see legend of Table 4.1.

The best regression model for FRAP data transformed by squared root function was obtained 

by the stepwise procedure with the highest R2 and R2Ajd and lowest MSE (Figure 4.3B). 

Significant main effects (p &amp;lt;0.05) were solvent: solid ratio (factor A), cut depth (factor D) and 

sample amount (factor H). Interactions DH and AD were third and fourth in absolute effect 

size, both with negative direction. Cut depth was the most negative influential factor both as 

main effect and in interaction. Solvent pH combined with solvent solid ration had negative 

effect. In resume, the factors that influenced more both TPC and FRAP were solvent solid ratio 

and root cut depth. Future optimization studies should vary solvent solid ratio at the highest 

tested level (50) and cut depth at the lower. The benefits on including the second layer of peeled 

sweet potato need assessment regarding its detrimental effect on phenolics concentration and 

antioxidant activity. Whilst no influential factor interactions were identified for TPC, higher 

antioxidant activities were obtained at both lower pH and sample amount. These factors setting 

will contribute to the enhance efficacy of future optimization studies. 

 

 

4.4. Conclusions 

 

The extraction of phenolic compounds from sweet potato peels was only significantly (p &amp;lt;0.05) 

affected by solvent: solid ratio (positively) and peel cut depth (negatively) with similar effect 

size. These variables had a similar effect on the size and importance of antioxidant activity as 

measured by FRAP. Regression models revealed significant main effects and two factors 

interactions for FRAP but not for TPC. After transformation of FRAP by the squared root 

function, sample size was selected by stepwise procedure as main effect and in interaction with 

solvent: solid ratio. In addition, a small positive influence of pH in interaction with solvent: 

solid ratio on antioxidant activity was observed. These results encourage the utilization of SPP 

obtained from food services operations as valuable sources for biological active compounds 

with antioxidant activity.

Abstract 

Sweet potato peels (SPP) are a major waste generated during root processing and currently have 

little commercial value. The aqueous extraction of phenolics with free radical scavenging 

activity from SPP was modelled and optimized by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and 

Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Solvent: solid ratio (30-60 mL/g), time (30-90 min) and 

temperature (25-75 ºC) were varied according to a Central Composite Design. Temperature, 

and solvent: solid ratio, alone and in interaction, presented a positive effect in TPC and in ABTS 

and DPPH methods (p&lt;0.05). Time had a negative influence in ABTS method and TPC. 

Optimized extraction conditions obtained by both RSM and ANN were 60 mL/g, 30 min and 

75 ºC. The obtained responses in the optimized conditions were as follow: 11.87 ± 0.69 mg 

GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.91 ± 0.42 mg TE/g DM for ABTS and 46.35 ± 3.08 mg TE/g DM for 

DPPH. SPP presented similar behaviour in optimum conditions and phenolic content obtained 

from peels of potato, tea fruit and bambangan. Predictive models and the optimized extraction 

conditions from this investigation may offer an opportunity for food processors to generate 

products with high potential health benefits.

5.1. Introduction 

 

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a most used agro product in the world, especially in Asia 

and Africa where it is used in traditional diets. This root has also been profusely included in the 

composition of innovative applications such as ice-cream (Gurgel et al. 2011) or non-

carbonated drink (Wireko-Manu et al. 2010). Further examples of developed functional sweet 

potato products are chips, flakes, yogurts and juices (Barnes and Sanders, 2012). Agro by-

products represent an important source of phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, 

possessing a wide range of functional activities. Peels are accounted as one of the major wastes 

generated during the processing of sweet potato with currently little commercial value 

(Maloney et al. 2012) and few research has been performed to upgrade it. Sweet potato peels 

(SPP) contain a high phenolic content with free radical scavenging activities (Zhu et al. 2010) 

which were related to health benefits such as wound healing (Panda et al. 2011). Studies on 

SPP valorisation have already covered applications such as production of bioethanol (Oyeleke 

et al. 2012), pharmaceuticals (Manpreet et al. 2005) and biosurfactants (Saharan et al. 2011). 

Recycling of agro wastes into high valuable products with potential health benefits could be 

achieved through extraction. As processing conditions are recognised to influence the removal 

of phenolics which are located particularly in the peel (Peschel et al. 2006), process modelling 

and optimization may encourage food operators to upgrade agro-waste. The optimization of the 

extraction of bioactive compounds from SPP was previously investigated by Response Surface 

Methodology (RSM) by Maloney and coworkers (2012). RSM is a reputed statistical technique 

proposed to improve processes by the means of its modelling capabilities to locate optimized 

points for various processes (Ilzarbe et al. 2008). Artificial neural network (ANN) has been 

applied in parallel with RSM method in prediction and modelling of extraction of phenolics 

with improvement in data fitting (Cheok et al. 2012; Wen et al. 2012). Phenolics extraction 

optimization studies were performed on fruit and vegetable peels such as apple (Junjian et al. 

2013), grape (Casazza et al. 2012; Ghafoor et al. 2010), jabuticaba (Santos and Meireles 2011), 

pomegranate (Amyrgialaki et al. 2014; Tabaraki et al. 2012), orange (Dahmoune et al. 2014), 

tangerine (Londoño-Londoño et al. 2010), bambangan (Prasad et al. 2011), banana (González-

Montelongo et al. 2010), mangosteen (Cheok et al. 2012), rambutan (Prakash Maran et al. 

2013), tea fruit (Xu et al. 2012) as well as and potato (Amado et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2011; 

Wijngaard et al. 2012). For the six aforementioned peel materials, the experimental design was 

based on a Central Composite Design (CCD). The objective of this work was to model the

effect of solvent: solid ratio, time and temperature on the extraction of phenolic compounds 

with radical scavenging activity from SPP through a CCD by RSM and ANN, and define the 

best conditions to obtain infusions with high phenolic content and biological activity. 

 

 

5.2. Materials and methods 

 

5.2.1. Reagents 

 

2,2-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, 2-2’-azino-bis (3 

ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), gallic acid, sodium persulfate 

and Trolox were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, U.K.). Sodium carbonate was 

purchased from VWR (West Chester, PA). Absolute ethanol was bought from Merck 

(Nottingham, U.K.). All reagents were of analytical grade. 

 

5.2.2. Plant material  

 

Sweet potatoes were purchased at local markets and transported to the lab at the same day. 

Roots were washed under tap water and air-dried during the night. Peeling was done manually 

with a cut depth of circa 1.5 mm, and peels were then dried at 60 ºC for 48 h. The dried material 

was then milled and sieved until all particles were smaller than 600 µm (30 mesh). 

 

5.2.3. Extraction process  

 

Twenty extractions runs were performed with respect to the CCD experimental plan presented 

in Table 5.1. 25 mL of distilled water at the proper temperature were transferred into a 250 mL 

screw cap flask with an adequate quantity of SPP powder regarding the experiment. The 

mixtures were stirred at constant rate of 200 rpm on a hot plate stirrer (HS0707V2, Favorit, 

Malaysia) at the respective run temperatures measured by digital food thermocouple (Model HI 

98501, Hanna Instruments, Bedfordshire, UK). Extracts were filtered through a filter paper with 

a vacuum pump aspirator (DOA-P604-BN, Cast Manufacturing Inc., USA) and volume filled 

up to 25 mL. Extracts were hold at -18 ºC by the day of analysis.

5.2.4. Evaluation of extracts  

 

Total phenolic content (TPC), ABTS radical scavenging activity and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-

picrylhydrazyl ) radical scavenging activity were determined regarding the method described 

previously by Prieto et al. (1999), Re et al. (1999) and Blois (1958), respectively, with minor 

modifications (Nunes et al. 2012). In addition, DPPH assay values were determined using 

absolute ethanol as a solvent. TPC was expressed in mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram 

of dried material (DM) while ABTS and DPPH values were reported as mg of Trolox equivalent 

(TE)/g DM. Determinations were carried out in triplicate and data were reported as means ± 

SD. All absorbance readings were made by a T70+ UV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd, 

United Kingdom). 

 

5.2.5. Statistical Analysis  

 

A Central Composite Design (CCD) for the aqueous solid–liquid extraction of SPP was used 

with three independent variables, solvent: solid ratio (X1), time (X2) and temperature (X3) on 

three responses, TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays (Table 5.1). The experimental plan contained 

20 runs, with 8 factorial points, 6 axial points and 6 central points. In order to have equal 

precision of estimation in all directions, design was made rotatable by an axial distance of 1.68, 

which corresponded to the 4-th root of the number of factorial points. Therefore, variables were 

coded at five levels (-1.68,-1, 0, 1, 1.68). Pearson correlations were conducted to examine the 

relationship between the antioxidant assays. A three-dimensional scatter-plot was built to 

compare the conditions of phenolic compounds extraction among studies performed on fruit 

and vegetable peels. The software used for the establishment of the experimental design, 

analysis of the data and creation of the plots was JMP® Pro 10.0.2 (www.jmp.com) provided 

at no cost by SAS (www.sas.com). Figures 5.2 and 5.5 were constructed by Microsoft® Excel 

2013. For RSM analysis, data were approximated to a second-order polynomial equation by the 

least-square regression method with the selection of the significant coefficients by the backward 

method (?out=0.05) with no rules (model hierarchy was not mandatory). The coefficient of 

determination (R2), adjusted R2 (R2adj) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to access 

the models performance. Fitted models were used to build surface plots and extraction 

conditions optimization was performed by maximizing the desirability function. For the 

analysis by ANN, a simple single layer structure with three inputs, X1, X2 and X3, one hidden

layer with seven nodes and TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays as outputs was exploited to model 

the experimental data obtained from CCD design (Figure 5.1). The data were divided into two 

subsets, training and validation and network topology was trained by k-fold cross validation 

method (k=6). One hidden layer was considered previously adequate by trial and error for 

adjusting extraction data (Cheok et al. 2012). The hyperbolic-tangent activation function was 

used as transfer function in the hidden layer to the output layer. The number of neurons in the 

hidden layer was adjusted iteratively to maximize performance fitting determined by R2 and 

RMSE. The rate of change in each predicted output was determined varying a given input while 

keeping all other input variables constant. Optimization was performed by maximizing the 

desirability function.

5.3. Results and discussion 

 

5.3.1. Design and variables selection 

 

Data from optimization studies on the extraction of phenolics (measured by the Folin-

Ciocalteau assay) and free radical scavenging activity from fruit and vegetable peels were 

recorded and presented in Table 2. Studies on peels valorisation through the extraction of 

phenolic compounds had been much more focused on fruits than on vegetables. However, only 

two studies included the measurement of ABTS free radical inhibition and/or DPPH free radical 

scavenging activities expressed in TE (Wijngaard et al. 2012). Research on optimization were 

performed by conventional solid-liquid extraction as well as innovative processes have been 

investigate such as high pressure carbon dioxide extraction (Santos and Meireles 2011), 

supercritical fluid extraction (Casazza et al. 2012) and pressurized liquid extraction (Wijngaard 

et al. 2012). According to Table 5.2, most of the experimental plans were based on CCD with 

three independent factors. Solvent: solid ratio was included as an independent variable in four 

optimization studies and it was considered a fixed factor in the majority of them. On the other 

hand, time and temperature were considered as independent factors in many investigations done 

on peels, although not always combined. Regarding the extraction of phenolic compounds from 

SPP, solvent: solid ratio and depth cut were identified as critical factors in a previous screening 

study (Anastácio and Carvalho 2013). The most favourable level identified for depth cut, 1.5 

mm, was used as a fixed condition in this work. Time and temperature when varied between 

60-180 min and 27-40 ºC did not influenced the extraction of phenolics from SPP (Anastácio 

and Carvalho, 2013). They were included in this optimization study as independent variables 

with a wider range of variation. Thus, the design selection for the aqueous extraction process 

was a three-factor CCD with solvent: solid ratio (X1), time (X2) and temperature (X3) as 

independent variables and TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays as responses. This design and 

independent will provide useful information on the body of knowledge regarding extraction of 

phenolic compounds with antiradical activity from fruit and vegetable peels.

5.3.2. Independent variables levels 

 

According to Table 5.2, the widest range for solvent: solid ratio (X1) was tested for a 

conventional extraction of phenols from mangosteen peels with a minimum value of 5.4 and 

maximum value of 200 mL/g (Cheok et al. 2012). The time of extraction (X2) was studied at 

very different levels whereas the conventional extraction for grape peels had the largest range, 

from 540 to 1740 min (Casazza et al. 2012). The lowest level studied was five minutes for 

phenolics extraction from potato peels (Singh et al. 2011). Regarding temperature (X3) of 

conventional extractions, the lowest and highest temperatures studied were 25 ºC (González-

Montelongo et al. 2010) and 90 ºC (Amado et al. 2014), respectively. Thus, minimum and 

maximum levels for the independent variables in the design were 30 to 60 mL/g for solvent: 

solid ratio, 30 to 90 min for time and 25 to 75 ºC for temperature. These settings were adjusted 

near to the median of values reported for fruit and vegetable peels studies (Table 5.2). 

 

5.3.3. Total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activity 

 

TPC results of SPP varied between 5.64 and 11.86 mg GAE/g DM (Table 5.1). This range was 

wider than reported value in the previous factor screening design (Anastácio and Carvalho 

2013) whereas an improvement of phenolic extraction was achieved. ABTS results of SPP 

presented a similar range of variation to TPC (3.91-12.85 mg TE/g DM), so these two variables 

are strongly associated with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.957 (p&lt;0.001). DPPH 

assay results had values between 13.76 and 49.79 mg TE/g DM, and were higher than ABTS 

results. ABTS free radicals could be dissolved in aqueous media whereas DPPH free radicals 

can only be dissolved in organic media (Wojdylo at al. 2007). The differences observed for the 

two assays might be justified by higher antiradical activities of SPP lipophilic compounds in 

comparison to hydrophilic compounds. Still, DPPH and ABTS assays results values were 

moderately correlated (R= 0.521; p&lt;0.05). A lower correlation of TPC with DPPH method 

(R=0.666; p&lt;0.01) than with ABTS was observed. The higher ability of SPP’s extracts to 

scavenge DPPH free radicals in comparison to inhibit ABTS free radicals may be related to 

compounds that are not determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay. Regarding other studies, 

TPC results were in line with those observed by Zhu et al. (2010) for the SPP methanolic 

infusions ranged from 8 to 20 mg GAE/g DM. However, TPC values was lower than other 

vegetable wastes such as broccoli (~30 mg GAE/g DM) or chicory (~13 mg GAE/g DM)

(Peschel et al. 2006). Regarding relationships between variables, a moderate correlation 

coefficient between TPC and ABTS was obtained for banana peels (R &gt; 0.55) (González-

Montelongo et al. 2010) while DPPH and ABTS assays results were more related (R &gt; 0.70) 

than what was observed in this work. 

 

5.3.4. Extraction modelling by RSM 

 

RSM analysis fitted experimental values were onto second order polynomial equations. 

According to ANOVA results for (Table 5.3), TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays fitted models were 

significant at a confidence level of 0.001, and p-values of the lack of fit were all higher than 

0.05 confirmed suitability of the selected design. Prediction equations were presented in 

Supplementary data. The coded regression coefficients sign and magnitude gives a direct 

measure of the contribution of the various independent variables in each response (Figure 5.2). 

For TPC response, temperature of extraction (X3) presented the highest positive effect followed 

by the interaction term between solvent: solid and temperature (X1X3).

In addition, the interaction term time-temperature (X2X3) and quadratic terms for time (X22) 

and solvent: solid (X12) presented a negative influence in the extraction of phenols. Compared 

to TPC response, ABTS fitted model include time (X2) as main factor with a negative effect. 

Main factors and interactions terms with positive effect on ABTS were similar to TPC, with a 

decreasing order of X3&gt;X1X3&gt;X1. In general, terms with negative impact presented lower 

magnitudes than positive terms. A different fitted model was observed for DPPH assay, where 

all significant terms had a positive effect in the order of X1&gt;X1X3 &gt;X3. In general, temperature 

(X3), interaction solvent: solid-temperature (X1X3) and solvent: solid (X1) terms presented a 

positive influence on TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays responses.

The significant negative terms observed TPC and ABTS models had much less magnitude than 

the positive ones. Time (X2) was the least influential variable for SPP extracts and as the main 

effect it was only significant for ABTS. The fitted models explained 96 % of the variability 

observed for TPC and 99 % for ABTS whereas it was slightly lower (94 %) for DPPH assay, 

as indicated by the coefficients of determination (R2) (Figure 5.2). Adjusted coefficients of 

determination (R2Adj) were similar in value with R2 for all three models. Root mean squared 

error (RMSE) was much higher for DPPH method than the others responses which 

demonstrates the existence of a higher variance of the fitted model. To exemplify the combined 

effects of variables, surface plots of solvent: solid and temperature were constructed for TPC, 

ABTs and DPPH assays responses (Figure 5.3). Positive interactions between solvent: solid and 

temperature could be confirmed. By analysing the slopes for each variable, it is anticipated that 

the upper level of solvent: solid and temperature will be optimal for the extraction of phenols. 

 

5.3.5. Extraction modelling by ANN 

 

The ANN equation models were presented in Supplementary data. R2 values for ANN models 

were 0.931 for TPC and 0.936 for both ABTS and DPPH assays. Regarding RMSE, TPC, ABTS 

and DPPH models presented values of 0.501, 0.458 and 1.77, respectively. Only DPPH assay 

model presented a higher R2 and lower RMSE than RSM models. As ANN is not able to provide 

insights of the models as directly as RSM approach, the rate of change of a response with change 

in the given input variable was computed with the remaining fixes at their mean value (Figure 

5.4). The greater the influence of the variable the higher the slope and range of change in the 

response. It could be observed that temperature (X3) presented the highest influence on TPC 

followed by solvent: solid ratio (X1) with a positive effect. Due to its low slope, time (X2) had 

minimum impact on TPC response. For ABTS results, temperature (X3) also presented the 

higher effect and positive slope. The influence of solvent solid (X1) was similar to time (X2) 

but opposite direction, solvent: solid ratio had a positive effect while time presented a negative 

influence. For DPPH assay values, solid: solvent was the main influential factor. Time and 

temperature presented both a positive slope that was lower than solvent: solid slope.

In summary, ANN models revealed that temperature and solvent: solid ratio have always a 

positive effect on responses. Time influence was always smaller than the other factors. 

Temperature presented a strong positive effect on both TPC and ABTS responses but less 

pronounced in DPPH assay results. 

 

5.3.6. Extraction optimization 

 

The operational extraction conditions that maximized simultaneously TPC, ABTS and DPPH 

assays by RSM were a solvent: solid ratio of 60 mL/g, a time of 30 minutes and a temperature 

of 75 ºC. These optimized settings had a desirability of 0.94. For solvent: solid ratio and 

temperature, the optimal point was located at the maximum of the variables range. This was 

consequence of a pronounced effect of these two variables individually and in interaction. An 

optimized temperature value at the upper limit of the experimental design was also obtained 

for juticaba (Santos and Meireles 2011), pomegranate (Tabaraki et al. 2012), rambutan 

(Prakash Maran et al. 2013) and potato peels (Wijngaard et al. 2012). At optimal extraction 

conditions, the predicted TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays values were 11.87 ± 0.69 mg GAE/g 

DM, 12.91 ± 0.42 mg TE/g DM and 46.35 ± 2.71 mg TE/g DM, respectively. When each 

response was maximized individually, the same optimal point was obtained for ABTS and 

DPPH methods. However, the optimal setting for time changed to 48.1 when TPC response 

was optimized individually. Predicted responses when maximizing TPC were 11.98 ± 0.61 mg 

GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.29 ± 0.33 mg TE/g DM for ABTS and 46.35 ± 2.71 mg TE/g DM for 

DPPH assay. These results were not statistically different (p&lt;0.05) from the optimization for 

all responses. The optimal extraction conditions obtained by ANN approach were identical to 

RSM. ANN predicted responses were 11.44 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.84 mg TE/g DM for 

ABTS and 47.1 mg TE/g DM for DPPH method. This optimal presented a desirability value of 

0.91. When optimized individually, solvent: solid and temperature factors solution did not 

change from 60 mL /g and 75 ºC, respectively. However, the optimal extraction time was 42.3, 

22.7 and 86.1 minutes when the desirability function was maximized only for TPC, ABTS and 

DPHH, respectively. Predicted responses were in line with the overall optimum. 

Considering that the conventional extraction conditions were different, than those used in in 

study, SPP water extracts presented a higher optimal TPC value than potato peels but much 

lower than fruits peels (Table 5.2). SPP optimal ABTS value was than banana peels but optimal

DPPH assay was higher than potato and banana peels. When optimal solvent: solid ratio, time 

and temperature were represented in a scatter 3D plot with TPC as weights for bubble size 

(Figure 5.5), SPP was also placed next to potato, forming a group with tea fruit and bambangan 

peels. Thus, the aqueous extraction of phenols from SPP had a high valorisation potential within 

agro peels.

optimized solvent: solid ratio (X1 op), time (X2 op) and temperature (X3 op) with total phenolic 
content as bubble size weights were under the same elliptic shadow.  
 

 

 

5.4. Conclusions 

 

Extraction modelling and optimization of phenolic compounds measured by Folin-Ciocalteau 

assay with ABTS and DPPH antiradical activities from SPP were performed by RSM and ANN 

based on a CCD experimental plan. Independent variables temperature and solvent solid have

had a positive impact as main factors and combined on all responses. Time presented a negative 

influence as main effect for ABTS method and interaction with temperature for TPC and ABTS 

method. RSM and ANN models presented the same optimal extraction conditions by 

maximization of the desirability function. The optimal settings were a solvent: solid ratio of 60 

mL/g, time of 30 min and temperature of 75 ºC with experimental values of 11.87 ± 0.69 mg 

GAE/g DM, 12.91 ± 0.42 mg TE/g DM and 46.35 ± 2.71 mg TE/g DM for TPC, ABTS and 

DPPH assays, respectively. SPP optimized conditions for the aqueous extraction of phenolic 

compounds with antiradical activity may represent an opportunity for food processors to 

transform this by-product from a liability to an asset. Future research will focus on the 

development of food applications with potential health benefits based on SPP aqueous extracts.

Abstract 

 

A beverage benchtop prototype related to oxidative stress protection was developed based on 

sweet potato peels phenolics. Formula components were sweet potato peel (Ipomoeas batatas) 

aqueous extract (SPPE), sweet potato leaves water extract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS). 

According to linear squares regression (LSR) models, SPLE presented higher positive effect 

on total phenolic content (TPC), FRAP and DPPH assays than the other components. All 

antagonist interactions were not significant. The optimum formula obtained by artificial neural 

networks (ANN) analysis was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. Predicted 

responses of TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and soluble solids were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 

1098 mg TE/L and 12.3 ºBrix, respectively. Optimization with LSR models was similar to 

ANN. Beverage prototype results positioned next to commercial vegetable and fruit beverages 

thus it has an interesting potential to the market of health and wellness.

6.1. Introduction 

 

Oxidative stress accelerates aging and contributes to several degenerative diseases due to the 

presence of excessive free radicals inside cells. These reactive oxygen species can cause cell 

injury due to structural damage and activation of gene regulatory proteins leading to disease 

(Adly 2010). As antioxidants, phenolics may protect cell constituents against oxidative damage. 

There is a growing interest in agro-wastes valorisation into functional products due to the 

increasing sustainable development demand from society (Spatafora and Tringali 2012). Sweet 

potato (Ipomoea batatas) peels are one of the major wastes generated during root processing 

(Maloney et al. 2012). Owing to their high phenolic content and antioxidant activity, sweet 

potato peels were considered to be a valuable source for biological active compounds for 

functional foods (Anastácio and Carvalho 2013a). Sweet potato had demonstrated a protective 

effect on oxidative-stress-related neurodegenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis (Miyazaki 

et al. 2008) and Alzheimer (Ye et al. 2010). Since peels can reach almost three times more 

antioxidant activity than any other sweet potato plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals and Cisneros-

Zevallos 2001), they may also have health benefits related to oxidative stress prevention. To 

leverage the conversion of sweet potato peels from a liability to an asset, studies on its 

application on innovative foods are needed. The use of by-products as a source of active 

ingredients to produce functional beverages was already considered a promising approach 

(Corbo et al. 2014). Due to an increased demand for intake of dietary antioxidants, the 

development of an antioxidant rich beverage should be considered (Nanasombat et al. 2015). 

The consumption of beverages rich in polyphenols limit the risk of various degenerative 

diseases associated with oxidative stress due to their role in protecting cell constituents against 

damage (Pandey and Rizvi 2009). Additionally, the growth of the health and wellness beverage 

market is set to outperform the wider soft and hot drinks industry until 2016 (Cowland 2013). 

Sweet potato was the base of a non-alcoholic beverage with properties similar to fruit juices 

(Weirko-Manu et al. 2010), and claimed in a patented functional juice (Barnes and Sanders 

2012) and anti-aging food (McDaniel 2010). The addition of peel extracts of citrus (Kim et al. 

2012) and plums (de Beer et al. 2012) to beverages raised their antioxidant activity. Thus, an 

antioxidant beverage based on sweet potato peels is a promising path for its valorisation. Using 

also sweet potato leaves as a formula component enhances the recycling concept of the new 

product. Leaves were identified as potential source of antioxidants (Anastácio and Carvalho 

2013b) that could prevent or moderate oxidative stress related diseases (Islam 2006). There are

few patented beverages with sweet potato peels or leaves. Sweet potato peels (Chuanbin and 

Xianxun 2011) and leaves (Qiuyun 2012) were used for the production of beers. Regarding 

non-alcoholic beverages, only leaves were patented for a juice beverage (Hong 2011). The 

beverage prototype could have poor taste acceptability due to astringency related to phenolic 

content (de Beer et al. 2012). Honey was also added to the formulations as a sweetener and also 

as a functional component because its radical scavenging activity can ameliorate oxidative 

stress (Erejuwa et al. 2012). Honey was already used in combination with sweet potato tuber 

in patented functional foods, as curd (Luo 2014), cake (Tong et al. 2014), preserved strip (Lin 

2014, Laijin et al. 2009) and candied (Yong 2012). The assessment of synergistic and 

antagonistic interactions between components is relevant for functional foods (Wang et al. 

2011) and can be achieved through a mixture design methodology on the beverage formula.  

This approach was used in the optimization of a nutraceutical fruit juice (Lawless et al. 2012) 

and a cardio protection beverage (Gunathilake et al. 2013). Artificial neural network (ANN) 

has been applied in parallel with multivariate techniques to increase modelling performance. 

Few applications of ANNs have been published for optimization of mixture designs related to 

food. The aim of this study was to optimize the antioxidant activity of a beverage benchtop 

prototype made from sweet potato peel aqueous extract (SPPE), sweet potato leaves aqueous 

extract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS) as components, through a mixture design approach 

with linear squares regression (LSR) and ANN analysis. To evaluate its potential as a functional 

food, the antioxidant activity of this beverage was compared with both commercial and 

laboratory drinks. 

 

 

6.2. Materials and Methods 

 

6.2.1 Chemicals 

 

2,2-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, gallic acid and Trolox were 

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, U.K.). Iron (III) chloride, sodium acetate, 

sodium carbonate, glacial acetic acid and 2,4,6-tripyridyl-2-triazine (TPTZ), were purchased 

from VWR (West Chester, PA). Absolute ethanol was purchased from Merck (Nottingham, 

U.K.). All reagents were of analytical grade.

6.2.2. Preparation of the sweet potato extracts 

 

Sweet potatoes were purchased at the local market, washed under tap water and air dried during 

the night. Roots were peeled with a cut depth circa 1.5 mm in one direction with a hand peeler. 

Sweet potato leaves were cut from vines collected from the field at Aljezur (Portugal), washed 

under tap water and dried with paper towels. Peels and leaves were dried at 60 ºC in a Binder 

BD 53 incubator (Binder, Tuttilgen, Germany) during 48 h and 24 h, respectively. The dried 

materials were milled until all particles were smaller than 600 µ m (30 mesh). Extractions were 

performed, in a screw cap flask (100 mL) in a stirring hot plate (HS0707V2, Favorit, Malaysia) 

stirred at constant speed of 200 rpm at 75 ºC during 45 min. A solid: solvent ratio of 16.7 

mg/mL was used for peels and 8.3 mg/mL for leaves. After filtration with a vacuum pump 

aspirator (DOA-P604-BN, Cast Manufacturing Inc., USA) and centrifugation (Hettich 

Universal  320, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 3000 g for  10 min,  SPPE and SPLE  were  stored at 

-18 ºC. 

 

6.2.3. Preparation of the honey solution 

 

Rosemary honey from regional origin was purchase in the local market. Because beverage 

mixtures were prepared by volume for formulation convenience, a honey solution (HonS) was 

used with a concentration of 0.535 g/mL. It presented soluble solids (SS) of 44 ºBrix measured 

by a pocket digital refractometer (Pocket Pal-1 ATAGO, Japan). 

 

6.2.4. Beverage evaluation 

 

Total phenolic content (TPC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH (2,2-

Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity were determined according to the 

method described by Prieto et al. (1999), Benzie and Strain (1996) and Blois (1958), 

respectively, with minor adaptations indicated in Nunes et al. (2012). TPC was expressed in 

mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) by 1 L of beverage, while FRAP and DPPH assays in mg 

of Trolox equivalent (TE) by 1L of beverage. All absorbance readings were made in a T70+ 

UV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd, United Kingdom). SS were measured as indicated 

for honey solution. Determinations were carried out in triplicate and data were reported as mean 

± standard deviation.

6.2.5. Experimental design and statistical analysis  

 

The experimental plan comprising a total of 24 runs was obtained using a I-optimal randomized 

mixture design for three components, SPPE, SPLE and HonS (Table 6.1). The proportional 

levels of components were set at 0.5-1.0 (50-100 %) for SPPE and 0-0.5 (0-50 %) for both 

SPLE and Hon. Beverage mixtures were blended volumetrically.

TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS results were approximated to a Scheffé polynomial model 

by the LSR method (P&amp;lt;0.05). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed to determine 

coefficients significance. Diagnostic tools such as normal plot of the residuals distribution, 

outlier detection and Box–Cox plots were computed to check models adequacy. The coefficient 

of determination (R2) and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2Adj) were used to access 

models performance. For the analysis by ANN, a simple single layer structure was used with 

the three components SPPE, SPLE and HonS as inputs, one hidden layer with three nodes and 

TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS as outputs (Figure 6.1). The data were divided into two 

subsets, training and validation and network topology was trained by k-fold cross validation 

method (k=6). Inputs were multiplied by weights and computed by hyperbolic-tangent 

activation function in the hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was adjusted 

iteratively to maximize performance fitting determined by R2 and root mean squared error 

(RMSE). Optimization was performed by maximizing the desirability function. To compare 

SPPE beverage with other antioxidant beverages, data was represented by Box–Cox plots. 

JMP® Pro 10.0.2 software (www.jmp.com) provided at no cost by SAS (www.sas.com) was 

used in the design of experiments, data analysis and creation of the graphics, except Figure 6.2 

which was made with Microsoft® Excel 2013.

The concept associated to the SPPE functional beverage was to provide a product based on 

sweet potato wastes, rich in antioxidants and sweetened with HonS. Valorisation of SPPE was 

the driving force of this study and the inclusion of SPLE reinforces product appeal regarding 

recycling and sustainability. A common limiting factor in waste valorisation is its practical 

suitability (Peschel et al. 2006). The direct use of SPPE as they are obtained by aqueous 

extraction in the liquid form addresses this issue. A sweetener was added to the beverage 

formula to mask the probable astringency related to its high phenolic content. HonS was chosen 

because it also contributes to antioxidant activity. 

 

6.3.2. Component levels selection 

 

Restrictions on mixture components were established according to beverage concept. Thus, as 

the functional beverage was intended to be based on sweet potato peels, a minimum of 50 % 

was established for this component. Its upper level was set to maximum (100 %) to gain a better 

knowledge of its potential. The other two components, SPLE and HonS were then varied in the 

remaining design space, between 0 and 50 %. 

 

6.3.3. Mixture design selection 

 

The study objective was to optimize a beverage formulation based on predictive models. The 

selection of the mixture design selection had to incorporate the restriction applied to SPPE 

(minimum of 50 %). Optimal designs efficiency is based on providing a high reliability of 

information with a reduced number of runs. I-optimal designs are adequate for the objective of 

this study because the average variance is minimized over restricted design region (Yeh et al. 

2010). The number of run replicates was chosen so the Scheffé polynomial model could be 

used to fit experimental data. It was observed that the antioxidant activity of a combination of 

foods may not be equal to the weighted sum of the antioxidant activity derived from the 

individual components (Wang et al. 2011). With this model, cross terms were included to access 

synergistic or antagonistic effects beside the linear main-effect terms.

6.3.4. Design responses selection 

 

Although in vitro antioxidant assays lack specificity, they are useful to access the potential of 

a new product at the initial stages of development. TPC based on Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, 

DPPH assay and FRAP were chosen as design responses mainly because they are profusely 

used in food products such as beverages. FRAP was considered a reasonable screen assay for 

the ability to maintain redox status in cells or tissues but for DPPH radical, no similarity to the 

highly reactive radicals involved in lipid peroxidation was found (Prior et al. 2005). These 

responses allowed the characterization of the antioxidant function present in beverage 

formulations by different reaction mechanisms. The FRAP mechanism is totally electron 

transfer while DPPH radical may be neutralized either by electron transfer or by hydrogen atom 

transfer (radical quenching) (Prior et al. 2005). Soluble solids were also included as a response 

as an indicator of formulations sweetness/perceived astringency. 

 

6.3.5 Beverage formula modelling 

 

To proceed modelling by LSR method, pseudo-components defined as XSPPE=((SPPE-

0.5)/0.5), XSPLE=(SPLE/0.5) and XHonS=(HonS/0.5) were used. After running diagnostic plots 

(data not shown), no data transformation was required and outliers detected in each response 

were not considered for modelling. According to ANOVA results (Table 6.2), all models were 

significant (P&amp;lt;0.001) and presented non-significant lack of fit. The significance, sign and 

magnitude of the coefficients of the model depicted in Figure 6.2 can assess the impact of 

beverage components in each response. The coefficient estimate of the linear terms XSPPE, 

XSPLE and XHonS represented the fitted response at the three vertices of the triangle while the 

coefficients of the cross terms XSPPE*XSPLE, XSPPE*XHonS, XSPLE*XHonS and XSPPE*XSPLE*XHonS 

were indicative of the curvature across each edge of the factor space. Synergistic or antagonistic 

effects of component pairs could be evaluated by positive or negative coefficients of the cross 

terms. For the TPC model, all linear pseudo-components were significant (P&amp;lt;0.001) and had 

a positive contribution. XSPLE term presented 1.2 times more effect than XSPPE or XHonS.

The significant cross effect terms were the positive interactions XSPLE*XHonS and XSPPE*XHonS. 

These synergetic effects were over four times lower than the magnitude of the XSPLE individual 

term. Therefore, the overall pseudo components effects order for  TPC  was  XSPLE  &gt;  XSPPE  ~  

XHonS  &gt;  XSPLE*XHonS  &gt; XSPPE*XHonS. Regarding antioxidant activity, linear terms were 

significant (P&amp;lt;0.001) and had a positive contribution on both FRAP and DPPH assay. A 

synergetic effect between XSPPE and XSPLE was observed for DPPH assay with a magnitude 

more than 1.7 lower than the respective individual terms. As this effect was not significant for 

FRAP, the synergetic interaction between phenolics from sweet potato leaves and peels may 

be more related to a radical quenching mechanism. Thus, FRAP model presented an positive 

effect order of XSPLE &gt; XSPPE &gt; XHonS while overall pseudo components effects order for DPPH 

assay was XSPLE &gt; XSPPE &gt; XHonS ~ XSPPE*XSPLE. As expected, pseudo-components effect on SS 

was quite different than for the other responses. XHonS was the dominant significant term but 



Chapter 6

161 

 

XSPPE also presented a positive contribution although much smaller in magnitude. TPC, FRAP, 

DPPH assays and SS models presented R2 values higher than 0.94 (Table 6.2). As R2Adj values 

were in line with R2, models fitting quality was considered high. In summary, SPLE was the 

component with highest influence on beverage phenolic content and antioxidant activity, 

followed by SPPE and HonS. HonS played the major influence in SS response with SPPE 

contributing also to the beverage perceived sweetness. SPPE, SPLE and HonS when combined 

at the levels of the mixture design presented predominantly positive effects regarding the 

beverage antioxidant activity. The interactions of SPPE with HonS and of SPPE with HonS 

were significantly synergetic for TPC were significant for. SPPE and SPLE presented also a 

significantly synergetic effect for DPPH assay. No significant antagonistic effects were 

observed. Predictive equations were depicted in Table 6.3 and represented in ternary plots in 

Figure 6.3. The ANN approach provided more complex predictive models than LSR (Table 

6.2) as outliers were not removed and components were used as such (not transformed into 

pseudo-components).

All ANN models presented better fitting performance than LSR, except for DPPH assay and 

regarding R2. When represented in a ternary plot, ANN models had similar trends as LSR across 

the design area for all responses (Figure 6.4).  

 

6.3.6. Beverage formula optimization 

 

The desirability function was used to simultaneously optimize all the responses. Formula 

optimization was performed by two different criteria. For the first criteria (C1), all the responses 

were maximized and weighted equally in the overall desirability function while for the second 

criteria (C2), settings were equal to C1 plus the additional requirement of a minimum of 12.3 

ºBrix for SS. This constrain in SS corresponded to the overall SS mean of commercial and 



Chapter 6

laboratory prototype beverages with antioxidant activity. With the optimization criteria C1, the 

optimal formula obtained from LSR models was 50.0 % of SPPE, 36.2 % of SPLE and 13.8 % 

of HonS (Figure 6.5) with predicted responses of 323 ± 3 mg GAE/L, 572 ± 30 mg TE/L, 1391 

± 72 mg TE/L and 6.5 ± 0.6 ºBrix for TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS, respectively. The 

desirability value was 0.588 and optimum was located in an extreme of the design space. 

Similar results were obtained by ANN models (Figure 6.5). The optimal formulation by ANN 

models was 50.0 % of SPPE, 38.3 % of SPLE and 11.2 % of HonS and predicted responses 

were of 331 mg GAE/L for TPC, 582 mg TE/L for FRAP, 1469 mg TE/L for DPPH assay and 

5.7 ºBrix for SS. Using C2 optimization criteria, the design space for optimization was reduced 

so SPPE could vary between 50 and 70 %, SPLE between 0 and 23 % and HonS between 27 

and 50%. With this constraint, the optimized beverage formula was 50.0 % SPPE, 22.1 % SPLE 

and 27.9 % HonS. Predicted values for TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS were (308 ± 10) mg 

GAE/L, 483 ± 38 mg TE/L, 1106 ± 8 mg TE/L and 12.3 ± 0.8 ºBrix, respectively. By increasing 

HonS component 1.2 times, the antioxidant activity decreased 17 % for FRAP and 22 % for 

DPPH assay. The value of the desirability function for the formula obtained by C2 (0.543) was 

similar to C1 and had higher probable taste acceptability. Using ANN models, optimum was 

similar to LSR models, with 50.0 % SPPE, 21.5 % SPLE and 28.5 % HonS as optimal formula. 

Predicted responses were of 309 mg GAE/L for TPC, 476 mg TE/L for FRAP, 1098 mg TE/L 

for DPPH assay and 12.3 ºBrix for SS. There were no relevant differences between LSR and 

ANN optimization results, thus future developments should use predictive equations obtained 

with higher efficiency. As all runs of the mixture design was used in ANN modelling, the 

chosen optimized beverage prototype formula was 50.0% SPPE, 21.5 % SPLE and 28.5 % 

HonS. 

 

6.3.7. Comparison with antioxidant beverages 

 

In order to benchmark the SPPE beverage, statistics from data on the phenolic content, 

antioxidant activity and soluble solids of commercial and laboratory prototype beverages from 

scientific journals were computed.

The commercial antioxidant beverages considered were fruit juices (González?Molina et al. 

2012, Pulido et al. 2003, Seeram et al. 2008, de Beer et al. 2012, Pellegrini et al. 2003), 

vegetable juices (Wootton-Beard and Ryan 2012), herbal infusions (Ho et al. 2010, Bravo et 

al. 2007, Pellegrini et al. 2003) and teas (Bravo et al. 2007, Pulido et al. 2003, Ho et al. 2010). 

Three laboratory beverages were also used for comparison, a plum peel enriched nectar (de 

Beer et al. 2012), a cardio protection fruit beverage (Gunathilake et al. 2013) and a nutraceutical 

fruit juice (Lawless et al. 2012). The range of TPC response for SPPE beverage was within fruit 

juices range of variation but it was lower than the other commercial and laboratory beverages 

(Figure 6.6). Regarding SPPE beverage antioxidant activity, FRAP range was within herbal 

infusion and tea, and above vegetable juice variations. However, DPPH assay box-plot showed 

that SPPE beverage overlapped fruit juice variation and was higher than vegetable juice and 

plum peel enriched beverage. Finally, SS box plots confirmed HonS component selected levels 

as adequate. In general, SPPE beverage benchtop prototype was competitive to fruit and 

vegetable juices regarding antioxidant activity. It presented however less phenolics than the 

commercial and laboratory beverages used for comparison.

6.4. Conclusions 

 

The optimized formula obtained by ANN models for the SPPE beverage benchtop prototype 

was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS 

predicted responses for the optimal formula were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098  mg 

TE/L and 12.3 ºBrix, respectively. LSR models revealed that components presented positive 

effect on TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays in the order SPLE&gt;SPPE&gt;HonS. Synergetic effects were 

observed between SPPE and HonS and SPLE and HonS for TPC. The interaction between 

SPPE and SPLE was synergetic for DPPH method. Antagonist effects in all responses were not 

significant (P&gt; 0.05). Sweet potato peel beverage was positioned next to commercial vegetable

and fruit beverages in terms of antioxidant activity. Further research on beverage composition 

is relevant before initiating studies on product quality, safety and stability.

General conclusions 

 

Functional foods demand a continuous innovative approach to develop convenient and healthy 

foods according to consumer’s expectations. The commencing stages involve the conversion 

of an essential concept often originated from academic research into a prototype. A framework 

for the valorisation of agro wastes into a food application through the development of a 

benchtop prototype with added value was applied to sweet potato (SP). A functional beverage 

with attributes related to oxidative stress protection was developed using sweet potato peels 

(SPP) and sweet potato leaves (SPL) as components. The developing processes involved the 

following steps: literature and patent review, preliminary study, key factors screening, 

extraction optimization and beverage formula optimization. Total phenolic content and 

antioxidant activity used to evaluate experiments was measured by Folin-Ciocalteau method 

and in vitro screening assays, respectively. 

 

Literature review for the period 2003-2014 showed that SPP presented lower research amount 

on phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity then SPL. SPP also presented a lower number 

of patented food products than SPL for the same period of time. In vitro antioxidant activity 

was mainly evaluated by the DPPH assay. The experimental designs used in research were 

predominantly the comparative type and design of experiments was used in reduced number. 

Flour/powder was the most studied food application with health benefits in articles while for 

beverage was the top patented food. The enhancement of antioxidant defence was a health 

benefit established for SPL by clinical trials while for SPP they were no studies. An antioxidant 

beverage was the elected food application with health benefits for the valorisation of SPP and 

SPL. Text mining analysis on articles and patents abstracts could show the state of the art 

regarding SP food applications by dendograms and co-occurrence networks.  

 

A preliminary study on phenolic content and antioxidant activity of sweet potato vines by a 

factorial design revealed that plant part (stems or leaves) presented the largest main significant 

effect (P &amp;lt;0.001) on TPC, TFC, TAA, RP and FRAP while for DPPH assay solvent was the 

most influential factor. Time of extraction presented a significant effect only on RP assay, as 

main effect and interaction with plant part. SPL flour reached up to 122 ± 0.07 mg GAE/g dw 

for TPC, 0.59 ± 0.05 g QE/100 g dw for TFC, 1.06 ± 036 g AAE/100 g dw for TAA, 50.8 ± 

2.2 g GAE/100 g dw for RP, 29.3 ± 2.8 mM TE/g dw for FRAP and 7.9 ± 2.0 mM TE/g dw for

DPPH method. Principal components analysis revealed that TFC, TPC, RP and FRAP were 

highly correlated while TAA was more correlated with DPPH assay.  

 

The extraction of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity from SPP flour was screened 

by a Plackett-Burman design to select key factors among nine variables such as solvent: solid 

ratio, time, pH, peeling cut depth, particle size, temperature, solvent, sample amount and 

agitation. Solvent: solid ratio and peel cut depth presented similar effect size but opposite 

direction (positive and negative, respectively) on TPC (p &amp;lt;0.05). These two factors had a 

similar effect size on FRAP. Regression models revealed significant main effects and two 

factors interactions for FRAP but not for TPC. After transformation of FRAP by the squared 

root function, sample size was selected by the stepwise regression procedure as main effect and 

in interaction with solvent: solid ratio. In addition, a small positive influence of pH in 

interaction with solvent: solid ratio on antioxidant activity was observed. TPC and FRAP 

presented a Pearson a correlation (R) of 0.77. 

 

In the development stage regarding extraction optimization, phenolic compounds with ABTS 

and DPPH radical scavenging activities from SPP flour were modelled and optimized by a CCD 

experimental plan. In decreasing order, temperature factor, the interaction between solvent: 

solid and temperature factors, and solvent: solid factor presented positive effects on TPC and 

ABTS methods. An inverse order was observed for DPPH assay. Optimized extraction 

conditions obtained by both RSM and ANN were 60 mL/g, 30 min and 75 ºC. The obtained 

responses at the optimized conditions were as follow: 11.87 ± 0.69 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, 

12.91 ± 0.42 mg TE/g DM for ABTS method and 46.35 ± 3.08 mg TE/g DM for DPPH method. 

SPP presented similar behaviour in both optimal conditions and phenolic content obtained from 

peels of potato, peels of tea fruit and peels of bambangan (mango).  

 

The optimized formula for the antioxidant beverage benchtop prototype obtained by ANN 

models was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. Predicted  results for the 

optimal formula on TPC, FRAP, DPPH assay and SS were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098  

mg TE/L and 12.3 ºBrix, respectively. LSR models revealed that components presented positive 

effect on TPC, FRAP and DPPH assays in the order SPLE&gt;SPPE&gt;HonS. Synergetic effects 

were observed between SPPE and HonS and SPLE and HonS for TPC. The interaction between 

SPPE and SPLE was synergetic for DPPH assay. Antagonist effects in all responses were not

significant (P&gt; 0.05). The beverage benchtop prototype was positioned next to commercial 

vegetable and fruit beverages in terms of antioxidant activity. Further research on beverage 

composition is relevant before initiating studies on product quality, safety and stability. 

 

These findings reduced knowledge gaps on the field of food application with health benefits 

related to SPL and especially SPP. Predictive models from this study may help researchers in 

their functional food development processes. Transfer of this knowledge to food processors 

may help transform SPP and SPL from a liability to an asset through their valorisation into 

innovative products for the market of health and wellness.
