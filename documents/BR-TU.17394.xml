SUMMARY

Peatlands are soil environments that store carbon and large amounts of water,
due to their composition (90 % water), low hydraulic conductivity and a sponge-
like behavior. It is estimated that peat bogs cover approximately 4.2 % of the Earth’s
surface and stock 28.4 % of the soil carbon of the planet. Approximately 612 000 ha
of peatlands have been mapped in Brazil, but the peat bogs in the Serra do Espinhaço
Meridional (SdEM) were not included. The objective of this study was to map the
peat bogs of the northern part of the SdEM and estimate the organic matter pools
and water volume they stock. The peat bogs were pre-identified and mapped by
GIS and remote sensing techniques, using ArcGIS 9.3, ENVI 4.5 and GPS Track
Maker Pro software and the maps validated in the field. Six peat bogs were mapped
in detail (1:20,000 and 1:5,000) by transects spaced 100 m and each transect were
determined every 20 m, the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates,
depth and samples collected for characterization and determination of organic
matter, according to the Brazilian System of Soil Classification. In the northern
part of SdEM, 14,287.55 ha of peatlands were mapped, distributed over 1,180,109
ha, representing 1.2 % of the total area. These peatlands have an average volume of
170,021,845.00 m3 and stock 6,120,167 t (428.36 t ha-1) of organic matter and
142,138,262 m3 (9,948 m3 ha-1) of water. In the peat bogs of the Serra do Espinhaço
Meridional, advanced stages of decomposing (sapric) organic matter predominate,
followed by the intermediate stage (hemic). The vertical growth rate of the

peatlands ranged between 0.04 and 0.43 mm year-1, while the carbon accumulation
rate varied between 6.59 and 37.66 g m-2 year-1. The peat bogs of the SdEM contain
the headwaters of important water bodies in the basins of the Jequitinhonha and
San Francisco Rivers and store large amounts of organic carbon and water, which
is the reason why the protection and preservation of these soil environments is
such an urgent and increasing need.

RESUMO: MAPEAMENTO, ESTOQUE DE MATÉRIA ORGÂNICA E DE ÁGUA
DAS TURFEIRAS DA SERRA DO ESPINHAÇO MERIDIONAL, MG

Turfeiras são pedoambientes que estocam carbono e água. Em razão da sua composição
(90 % de água) e da sua baixa condutividade hidráulica, as turfeiras constituem grandes
reservatórios de água, apresentando comportamento do tipo “esponja”. Estima-se que as
turfeiras cubram aproximadamente 4,2 % da superfície da Terra e estoquem 28,4 % do carbono
dos solos do planeta. Foram mapeados aproximadamente 612 mil ha de turfeiras no Brasil;
entretanto, as turfeiras na Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (SdEM) não foram incluídas. Os
objetivos deste trabalho foram mapear as turfeiras da porção norte da Serra do Espinhaço
Meridional e estimar seu estoque de matéria orgânica e o volume de água por elas armazenado.
As turfeiras foram pré-identificadas e mapeadas por meio de técnicas de geoprocessamento e
sensoriamento remoto, utilizando os softwares ArcGIS 9.3, ENVI 4.5 e GPS Trackmaker Pro
e validadas em trabalhos de campo. Seis turfeiras foram mapeadas detalhadamente (escala
entre 1:20.000 e 1:5.000), por meio de transectos espaçados por 100 m e em cada transecto
foram determinadas, a cada 20 m, as coordenadas UTM (Universal Transversa de Mercator)
e a profundidade e coletadas amostras para caracterização e determinação do teor de matéria
orgânica, de acordo com o Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos. Foram mapeados
14.287,55 ha de turfeiras, distribuídas ao longo de 1.180.109 ha, o que representa 1,2 % da
área total. Essas turfeiras ocupam um volume médio de 170.021.845,00 m3, estocam 6.120.167
t de matéria orgânica (428,36 t ha-1) e armazenam 142.138.262 m3 de água (9.948 m3 ha-1).
Nas turfeiras da Serra do Espinhaço Meridional predominam os estádios de decomposição da
matéria orgânica avançado (sáprico), seguido do intermediário (hêmico); sua taxa de
crescimento vertical variou entre 0,04 e 0,43 mm ano-1, enquanto a taxa de acúmulo de carbono
oscilou entre 6,59 e 37,66 g m-2 ano-1. As turfeiras da SdEM formam as cabeceiras de importantes
cursos d’água das bacias dos rios Jequitinhonha e São Francisco e armazenam grandes
quantidades de carbono orgânico e água, o que fundamenta a necessidade urgente e emergente
de proteger e preservar esses pedoambientes.

INTRODUCTION

The Serra do Espinhaço consists of a set of
elevations aligned in the north-south direction, from
the Piauí-Bahia-Pernambuco State boundaries in the
North to the central region of Minas Gerais in the
South (Almeida Abreu &amp;amp; Renger, 2002). The southern
part (SdEM) has a length of about 300 km, reaching
from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero (19.5° S) to the region
of Olhos d’Água (17o S), covering about 3.5 million
ha, where about 700 000 people live in 53 counties
(Silva et al., 2005). Due to its impressive scenic beauty,
endemic biodiversity in rare and peculiar natural
systems, for example peatlands, the region was
classified as an “Earth Biosphere Reserve” by UNESCO.

As for the geodynamic evolution of the Espinhaço,
a succession of denudational and depositional events

segmented the relief of the mountains and formed five
levels of planes between 1,800 and 1,000 m asl (Saadi
&amp;amp; Valadão, 1987), corresponding to the leveled surfaces
Gondwana, Post-Gondwana, South American,
Paraguaçu and Velhas (King, 1956).

On these planes, peat bogs were formed by the
successive accumulation of plant residues, at locations
where the conditions of excessive moisture, low pH and
nutrient levels, the lack of oxygen and mild
temperatures together inhibit the activity of microbial
decomposers (Pontevedra-Pombal &amp;amp; Martínez Cortizas,
2004) and the organic matter is humified and very
slowly mineralized. The plant material gradually loses
its primary structure, resulting in residues that react
again and polymerize (in bio and geochemical processes),
forming compounds of complex structures, with constant
enrichment of fixed carbon (Pereira et al., 2005).



SURFACE MAPPING, ORGANIC MATTER AND WATER STOCKS IN PEATLANDS OF THE SERRA...     1151

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 37:1149-1157, 2013

It is estimated that there are about 420 million ha
of peatlands on the planet, equivalent to 4.2 % of the
Earth’s surface (Gorham, 1991). The majority, about
350 million ha, is found in the Northern Hemisphere,
and between 30.5 and 45.9 million ha in the tropics
(Rieley et al., 2008). However, the distribution map of
Histosols on the planet (FAO, 1990) does not consider
these soils in Brazil. In this country, peatlands occupy
approximately 611,883 ha, corresponding to around
0.07 % of the national territory (Valladares, 2003).
However, in the said study, the peat bogs in the SdEM
were not mentioned.

Peatlands are important carbon reserves.
Martinelli et al. (2009) estimated that the carbon stock
in soils on the planet is in the order of 1.6 trillion
tons, spread over about 10 billion ha. Analyzing the
data of Gorham (1991) and Martinelli et al. (2009),
the peatlands represent 4.2 % of all soil on the planet
and store 28.4 % of its carbon.

Another strategic importance of peat bogs is the
function of constituting large water reservoirs, since
they consist to about 90 % of water (IPCC, 2001; Sire,
2010). They have a high water holding capacity and
low hydraulic conductivity (Valladares, 2003; Takeshi
et al., 2008), resulting in a sponge-like behavior
(Ingram, 1983).

The hypothesis of this study is that the SdEM
peatlands store significant amounts of organic matter
and water. The objective of this study was to map the
peat bogs of the northern part of SdEM, to estimate
the pool of organic matter and the volume of water
stored therein.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Characterization of the study area

The study area comprises an area of 1,180,109 ha
of the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional (SdEM), in
Minas Gerais (17o 40’- 19o 30’ S, 42o - 44o W) (Figure 1).

The Serra do Espinhaço borders the southeastern
San Francisco craton in the south and has a length of
about 300 km in the S-N direction, from the Iron Ore
Quadrilateral, near Belo Horizonte, to the region of
Olhos d’Água, north of Diamantina. The climate of
the region is CwB (Köppen classification), i.e., a
mesothermal climate with rainy and mild summers.
The average annual temperature is 18.7 oC, winters
are cold and dry and summers humid and mild, and
the average annual rainfall is 1,500 mm (Silva et al.,
2005).

In the Serra do Espinhaço, the plane surfaces are
separated by areas with a high degree of dissection,
with a hilly and steep relief and very frequent
metasandstone outcrops of the Espinhaço Supergroup.
The predominant soils are Lithic Ustorthents,
Hydromorphic Quartzipsamments and Orthic

Quartzipsamments (Silva et al., 2005), which are
substrate types of the Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna
Biome). In several plane surface depressions,
peatlands contain headwaters from which numerous
dark watercourses originate.

Cartography

Database and radar and satellite image
acquisition

All cartographic maps and characterization of the
study area were compiled from field observations
(using GPS and IBGE topographic map) and the
database of the National Water Agency (ANA), the
Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation
(Embrapa), the Brazilian Institute of Environment
and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
the Minas Gerais Institute of Water Management
(IGAM), the National Institute for Space Research
(INPE), GeoMINAS, Ministry of Environment (MMA)
and Company of Mineral Resources Research (CPRM),
obtained in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

To cover the entire study area, radar images
corresponding to the maps SE23XC (Pirapora),

SE23ZA (Curvelo), SE23ZB (Guanhães), SE23ZC (Belo
Horizonte), SE23ZD (Ipatinga) and SE23XD (Chapel)
at the scale of 1:250,000, were provided by Embrapa
(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - SRTM obtained
by NASA).

The Landsat-5 satellite images were acquired from
the INPE database between 2010 and 2011. The
temporal resolution of bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 of orbit 218
and points 72 and 73 (representing the entire SdEM)
covered the period between 01.01.2009 and 11.26.2010.

Mapping of the peatlands

The peatlands were pre-identified and delineated
based on aerial photographs, and on Google Earth,
Landsat-5 satellite and radar images, using the
programs ENVI 4.5 and ArcGIS 9.3. The identification
was validated by field work.

In the field, the formation pattern of peatlands,
which was repeated at all sampled points, was
interpreted. Peat bogs develop at slightly depressed
to plane sites, where drainage is blocked by rocky
outcrops and small forest patches appear as typical
feature. The pattern, shape, texture and size of objects
in aerial photographs (Rocha, 2007), were also used
in the identification of the peatlands.

The radar images provided by Embrapa contributed
significantly to the determination of the pattern of
peatlands and were useful in the characterization and
verification of the spatial distribution of these soil
environments on the surfaces of SdEM. They were
essential for the identification of the typical
morphological features of peat environments.

With the corrected and recorded mosaic satellite
image (Moreira, 2011), the peat bogs were identified
and all other elements in the landscape eliminated
(water, bare soil, rock, native forest, planted forest),
by the maximum likelihood supervised classification
(MAXVER) of ENVI 4.5 Software (accuracy 93.3 %,
estimation error 6.7 %). After these steps, the
classification was refined with validation by new
fieldwork. Finally, all peatland areas were vectored
and the area and volume calculated, using program
ArcGIS 9.3, option calculate geometry, and GPS
TrackMaker Pro. The volume estimates may be
inaccurate, since they are based on an average depth
obtained from points measured on transects and the
surfaces of the bottom of the peatlands are irregular.
However, they offer a comparative order of magnitude
based on mapping procedures used for other peatlands
(Pontevedra-Pombal, 2002).

Sampling

The sampling procedure of peatlands consisted of
pushing a PVC pipe (230 cm long and 50 mm diameter)
at representative points into the peat substrate, until
reaching the rock or sand base underneath. Then the
tube was closed, removed from the sampling site and
placed horizontally, to remove the sample. Ten

samples were collected from five transects in
peatland 1 (Sopa), 10 in three transects in peatland 2
(District of São João da Chapada I), 10 in the three
transects in peatland 3 (São João da Chapada II), 21
in four transects in peatland 4 (Pinheiro), six in one
transect in peatland 5 (Sempre-Vivas II), and 10 in
two transects in peatland 6 (Sempre-Vivas III), at a
total of 77 sampling points.

In the field, the decomposition stage of the bog
layers was determined on the von Post decomposition
scale (Stanek &amp;amp; Silc, 1977), described by Embrapa
(2006).

Analytical determinations

Histosols were analyzed and characterized as
described by Embrapa (2006). The contents of
unrubbed fiber (RF), rubbed fiber (RF), solubility in
sodium pyrophosphate, pH in CaCl2, soil bulk density
(SBD), organic matter density (OMD), mineral
material content (MM), organic matter content (OM),
minimum residue (MR) and gravimetric moisture
(GM). The content of organic carbon (OC) was
estimated by assuming that the mass of organic
matter consists of 58 % carbon (Brunetto at al., 2006).

Carbon isotopes (?13C and 14C) were determined
by liquid scintillation spectrometry of low background
radiation and the results of radiocarbon dating
were corrected for the natural isotopic fractionation
(-25 ‰) and presented at conventional 14C ages in
years before present (BP) at 1? (68.3 % probability)
(Pessenda &amp;amp; Camargo, 1991).

Determination of the volume of water stored
in peatlands

Six peatlands were mapped in detail in the field
and sampled for the characterization of Histosols
(Santos et al., 2005; Embrapa, 2006). They were
divided into transects spaced 100 m apart. At intervals
of 20 m along the transects, the depth was measured
with a probe and the point georeferenced by GPS.
Based on the average depth of the six peatlands and
the total bog area mapped in SdEM, the total volume
was calculated. With these data and the method
proposed by Campos et al. (2012), the water volume
stored in the SdEM peatlands was estimated.

Determination of rates of vertical growth
(VGR) and of carbon (CAR) and organic
matter accumulation in the peatlands

Vertical growth rates (VGR) and carbon
accumulation (CAR) of peatlands were determined
from the following formulas:

VGR = (ADD - ADU)/(RAD - RAU),

where: VGR: vertical growth rate (mm year-1), ADD:
average depth of the deepest sample (mm), ADU:
average depth of the uppermost sample (mm), RAD:
radiocarbon age of the deepest sample in years before

present (BP), RAU: radiocarbon age of the uppermost
sample (BP).

 CAR = (ADD - ADU) x SBD x OC x 10/(RAD - RAU),

where: CAR: carbon accumulation rate (g m-2  year-1),
SBD: soil bulk density, OC: organic carbon (dag kg-1).

The total pool of organic matter (TPOM) and the
average pool of organic matter (APOM) of peatlands
were estimated according to the following formulas:

TPOM = V x MSBD x OM x 0.164/100,

where: TPOM: total pool of organic matter (t), V: volume
of peatland (m3); MSBD: mean soil bulk density (t m-3);
OM: average content of organic matter (dag kg-1);
0.164: constant [average content of solids found in
peatlands in SdEM, Campos et al. (2012)].

APOM = TPOM/A,

where: APOM: average pool of organic matter (t ha-1);
TPOM: total pool of organic matter (t), A: peatland
area (ha).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

M o r p h o l o g i c a l ,  p h y s i c a l  a n d  c h e m i c a l
properties of peatlands

Peatlands have a dark color (brightness value
between 3 and 4 and chroma between 2 and 4, on the
Munsell Soil Color Chart) and extremely acidic pH in
CaCl2, with averages ranging from 2.99 to 3.76 (Table 1).
According to Ebeling et al. (2011) and Andriesse (1984),
the characteristically low pH values of peat
environments are directly related to the organic acids
formed during the process of OM mineralization. The
dark color and pH values (in CaCl2) in the peat bogs
of SdEM confirm the values found by Campos et al.
(2010) and Horák et al. (2011), ranging between 2.6
and 4.4 and also coincide with the results of Silva et
al. (2009).

Peatlands are classified by the Brazilian System
of Soil Classification (2006) as Haplic Histosols, and
can be fibric (initial stage), hemic (intermediate stage)
or sapric (advanced stage of OM decomposition),
according to the OM - decomposition scale of von Post
(Table 2). Out of the 77 samples, 51 % were classified
as sapric (Embrapa, 2006). An intermediate stage of
decomposition (hemic) was observed in 42 % of the
samples. The presence of fibric OM (in early stages of
decomposition) was observed in only 7 % of the
samples. The highest OM and OC contents are related
to lower MM contents and OMD is higher in
predominantly hemic materials compared to the sapric
soils (Table 1). These results corroborate studies
conducted by Silva et al. (2009), Campos et al. (2010)
and Horák et al. (2011).

The gravimetric moisture (GM) of most samples
was greater than 100 % and in many of them, values

exceed 200 %, as also reported by Campos et al. (2011)
and cited by Kiehl (2002), IPCC (2001) and Sire (2010).
The soil bulk density (SBD) and minimum residue
(MR) decreased with the organic matter (OM) content
and decomposition stage, corroborating observations
of Conceição et al. (1999).

Radiocarbon age, VGR and OM accumulation

The VGR in the different studied peatlands
(Table 2) was 0.074 mm year-1 in Pinheiro, (depth
30-144 cm), 0.43 mm year-1 in Sempre-Vivas II
(depth 4.5-37.5 cm) and 0.058 mm year-1 in Sempre-
Vivas III (depth 18-54 cm). In the peatland of São
Miguel, the VGR was 0.047 (depth 10-164 cm) and
0.040 mm year-1 in Pico do Itambé (depth 3-15 cm).

The annual growth rates (Table 2) are similar to
those found in SdEM peatlands covered by field
vegetation (Campos et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2013a,b),
and lower than rates found in peatlands in Finland,
Canada and Spain (Tolonen, 1979; Gorham, 1991;
Pontevedra-Pombal, 2002), and in SdEM peatlands
covered by semi-deciduous seasonal forest (Silva et al.,
2013a,b). These differences are related to the vegetation
types that cover the bogs and, possibly, to climate causes.

The carbon accumulation rate (CAR) in the
peatland of Pinheiro was 7.85 g m-2 year-1 (depth 30-
144 cm); of Sempre-Vivas III, 37.66 g m-2 year-1 (depth
4.5-37.5 cm); Sempre-Vivas II 7.45 g m-2 year-1 (depth
18-54 cm); São Miguel 7.33 g m-2 year-1 (depth 10-164
cm ) and of Pico do Itambé 6.59 g m-2 year-1 (depth 3-
15 cm) (Table 2).

The CARs (Table 2) of the SdEM peatlands in semi-
deciduous seasonal forest (greater OM input to the
soil) and in peatlands of temperate and boreal regions
(Pontevedra-Pombal, 2002; Armentano &amp;amp; Menges,
1986) were similar to rates found in the SdEM
peatlands covered by field vegetation (Campos et al.,
2010; Silva et al., 2013a,b) and lower than those
observed by Silva et al. (2013a,b).

Both VGR and CAR were significantly higher in
Sempre-Vivas III (Table 2) than in the other peatlands
of SdEM, possibly due to the proximity of the samples
to the surface (3-6 and 35-40 cm), where OM is less
decomposed, to the radiocarbon age and to the floristic
composition of the site.

Area, volume and OM stocks of mapped
peatlands

From the field and delimitation data of peatlands
with satellite imagery and aerial photographs and the
option calculate geometry of ArcGIS 9.3 software, the
area and volume of six mapped peatlands were
calculated (Silva, 2012). From the organic matter
amount and soil bulk density, the total pool of OM
and the average pool of OM were estimated for each
mapped peatland (Table 3).

Campos et al. (2012) mapped the peatland of Pau-
de-Fruta in the SdEm (scale &gt; 1:5,000) and quantified

OM between 85 and 853 t ha-1 in 12 homogeneous
sections of peatlands of the same region. This difference
was attributed to variations in SBD and OM content
in the sections. The OM in all mapped peatlands in
this study is within the range found by the authors
and the differences were attributed to SBD and OM
contents (Table 3).

Area, volume of water and organic matter
stocks in the SdEM peatlands

The northern part of SdEM covers an area of
1,180,109.00 ha, of which 14,287.55 ha are peatlands,
representing 1.2 % of the total area (Figure 1). These
bogs occupy a volume of 170,021,845 m3 and store



SURFACE MAPPING, ORGANIC MATTER AND WATER STOCKS IN PEATLANDS OF THE SERRA...     1155

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 37:1149-1157, 2013

6,120,167 t of OM, corresponding to 428.36 t ha-1
(Table 4). In this study, the smallest peatland area
identified was 0.09 ha due to the limitations of the
spatial resolution of the Landsat imaging (30 m) (Silva,
2012). Thus, each “pixel” (picture element - measured
in points per inch or dpi) of the image corresponds to
an area of 900 m2 (0.09 ha). Peatlands smaller than
0.09 ha were not taken into consideration in this
SdEM mapping.

The average organic matter (APOM) stock
(428.36 t ha-1) estimated for the entire SdEM was
similar to that found by Campos et al. (2012). The
authors quantified an AOM of 552 t ha-1 in a peatland
in the same region.

The resolution of the Landsat imaging does not
allow the mapping of peatlands smaller than 0.09 ha;
therefore, the results of this study may be
underestimated and the total OM in the mapped
peatland area in the SdEM (14287.55 ha) could exceed
6.12 million tons (Table 4). Gorham (1991) estimated
that, in global terms, peatlands have 1,863 t ha-1 OM.
However, the author considered an average depth of
2 m, while in this work, the average depth was 1.19
m. Moreover, SdEM peatlands have a high mineral
material content (Table 1), while in peatlands of
temperate and boreal climate, where Gorham (1991)
based his work, the mineral material contents are
much lower.

SdEM peatlands store 142,138,262 m3 of water,
corresponding to 9,948 m3 ha-1 (Table 4). This amount
would be enough to supply São Paulo City
(consumption of 5.65 m3 capita-1 month-1) in 2009
(11,037,693 inhabitants) for two months and 10 days
(OSP, 2012). Campos et al. (2012) found similar values

in the SdEM peatlands that store between 1,039 and
10,833 m3 ha-1. The OM values may also be
underestimated.

The headwaters of the major rivers or tributaries
of three of the main hydrographic basins of eastern
Brazil are in the SdEM. Peatlands are found in the
basins of the São Francisco River (44 % of the study
site and 75 % of the mapped area), the Jequitinhonha
River (30 % of the study site and 24 % of the mapped
area) and the Rio Doce (26 % of the study area and
1 % of the mapped area) (Figure 1 and Table 5).

Five of the nine major rivers of the SdEM have
peat bogs in the headwaters (Figure 1) and the words
“brown” and “black” appear in the names of three,
referring to the dark color of their waters due to the
organic acids from peatlands (Lévesque &amp;amp; Dínel, 1982;
Gorham, 1991; Maltby &amp;amp; Dugan, 1994). The
Jequitinhonha River and its main tributary, the
Araçuaí River, which are the main or only water
source for more than 1 million inhabitants of a
significant area in the semi-arid region of Minas Gerais
State, have their headwaters in the SdEM and the
peat bogs greatly influence their flow.

The accumulation of organic matter by anaerobic
conditions caused by excess water accentuates your
“sponge effect”, in other words, its ability to retain
more and more water (Rycroft et al., 1975a,b; Ingram,
1983; Stevenson, 1994; Brandyk et al., 2003;
Pontevedra-Pombal &amp;amp; Martínez Cortizas, 2004;
Campos et al., 2012).

The accumulation of organic matter under
anaerobic conditions caused by excess water
accentuates its “sponge effect”, ie, the ability to retain
large quantities of water.

CONCLUSIONS

1. In the northern SdEm peatlands, advanced and
intermediate decomposition stages of organic matter
predominate.

2. The vertical growth rate of the SdEM peatlands
ranges between 0.04 and 0.43 mm year-1 and the carbon
accumulation rate varies from 6.59 to 37.66 g m-2 year-1.

3. The peatlands in the northern SdEM store large
amounts of organic carbon and water. The organic
matter stocks were estimated at 6,120,167 t (428.36 t
ha-1) and the total volume of stored water at
142,138,262 m3 (9,948 m3 ha-1).
