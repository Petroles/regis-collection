ABSTRACT

Several studies have demonstrated the effect of a second phase on the distribution of fluid phase and dissolution of

quartz grains. However, as most observations came from aggregates deformed under hydrostatic stress conditions and

mica-bearing quartz rocks, 3-D distribution of pores on quartz-quartz (QQB) and quartz-hematite boundaries (QHB)

has been studied. Several fracture surfaces oriented according to finite strain ellipsoid were analyzed. The pore distri-

bution characterizes the porosity and grain shape as highly anisotropic, which results from the nature and orientation

of boundaries. QHB have physical/chemical properties very different from QQB, once the hematite plates have strong

effect on wetting behavior of fluid, likewise micas in quartzites. They are pore-free flat surfaces, normal to compres-

sion direction, suggesting that they were once wetted with a continuous fluid film acting as faster diffusion pathway.

At QQB, the pores are faceted, isolated, close to its edges reflecting the crystallographic control and an intercon-

nected network of fluid along grain junctions. The QQB facing the extension direction are sites of fluid concentration.

As consequence, the anisotropic dissolution and grain growth were responsible for the formation of hematite plates

and tabular quartz grains significantly contributing for the generation of the foliation observed in the studied rocks.

Key words: deformation mechanisms, fluid distribution, grain growth, porosity, solution transfer.

INTRODUCTION

Several studies based on observations (Mancktelow
1987, Hippertt 1993, 1994) and experiments (Hickman
and Evans 1995, Farver and Yund 1999) have demon-
strated that the presence of a second phase has a pro-
found effect on the anisotropic distribution of fluid
phase and the dissolution of quartz minerals. Most ex-
periments carried out in aggregates deformed under
conditions of hydrostatic stress have demonstrated that
fluid distributions are in textural equilibrium, showing
equilibrated pore geometries (e.g. Watson and Brenan
1987). These studies have presented wetting and non-
wetting fluid distributions (interconnected tubules along
grain edges and isolated pores, respectively) as well
as continuous fluid film in equilibrium with the solid

phases along grain boundaries (Watson and Brenan
1987, Lee et al. 1991). However, for rocks naturally
deformed, data have shown a heterogeneous fluid dis-
tribution, out of textural equilibrium, due to highly ani-
sotropic interfacial energy in the polymineralic aggreg-
ates (Spry 1983, Urai et al. 1986, Hippertt 1994, Jin
et al. 1994, Daines and Kohlstedt 1997). In addition,
the deformation-induced change in fluid distribution
may have a profound effect on the rock strength, defor-
mation mechanism and fluid transport (Hirth and Tullis
1991, Tullis et al. 1996).

However, the majority of the observations in nat-
urally deformed rocks have been made exclusively on
mica-bearing quartz rocks (e.g. Hippertt 1994). Thus, in
this study samples of iron oxide bearing quartz rocks
from Paleoproterozoic banded iron formations were se-
lected to investigate the influence of a second phase on
the distribution of aqueous fluid, as inferred from the

3-D distribution of pores on quartz-quartz and quartz-
hematite boundaries. The samples were carefully pre-
pared to ensure that fractures would occur exclusively
along grain boundaries. Then, several fracture surfaces
carefully oriented with respect to the finite strain ellip-
soid were observed in the scanning electron microscope
(SEM). The studied banded iron formations occur in
the southern part of the Brazilian Archean-Proterozoic
shield, São Francisco Craton (Fig. 1). In this location
there is an extensive iron ore deposit, in the region
termed Quadrilátero Ferrífero – QF, which is part of a
granite-greenstone terrain of Archaean-Proterozoic age
(Alkmim and Marshak 1998).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The studied quartz-iron oxide samples came from Paleo-
proterozoic iron formations from QF area (Fig. 1). The
region is characterized as a classical granite-greenstone
terrain, composed mainly of a sequence of metavol-
canic and metasedimentary rocks, surrounded by a 2.9-
3.2 Ga gneiss/migmatite complex (Teixeira et al. 1989,
Machado et al. 1996), and Archaen plutons (2.7-2.6 Ga)
(Teixeira 1985, Machado and Carneiro 1992, Marshak
et al. 1992, Carneiro et al. 1994, 1995, Machado et al.
1996). According to the referred authors, it is a com-
plex association of granite and gneiss-migmatite rocks,
covered by a meta-volcanic-sedimentary sequence (Rio
das Velhas Supergroup). Discordantly overlying this
basement sequence, there are metasedimentary rocks
of paleo-Proterozoic age, which comprise the Minas
Supergroup (Carneiro et al. 1995, Noce 1995, Renger
et al. 1995, Alkmim and Marshak 1998). The overlying
Paleoproterozoic units are composed of metasediments
including schist, quartzite, carbonate rocks and a sev-
eral hundred-meter thick unit of banded iron formations
(BIF’s). These units were deposited ca 2.5 Ga (Babinsk
et al. 1993).

The supracrustal sequences have been intensively
folded in a complex geometry consisting of kilometer-
scale synclines and anticlines surrounded by domes of
gneiss/migmatite (Marshak et al. 1992, Alkmim and
Marshak 1998). The contacts between the domes and
the supracrustal rocks are generally marked by low to
medium grade metamorphic shear zones (Hippertt et al.
1992). In several of these contacts thermal aureoles

are observed, with the development of porphyroblasts
in the relatively cooler supracrustal rocks (Herz 1970,
1978, Jordt-Evangelista et al. 1992). Some authors have
proposed a compartmentation of QF region according
to the magnitude of deformation (Rosière et al. 2001)
and metamorphic grade (Pires 1995). According to these
authors, in the west part of the QF area, the less de-
formed rocks outcrop and metamorphic studies indicate
a metamorphism not higher than the low greenschist
facies, reaching temperatures up to 350?C. On the other
hand, in the eastern domains, rocks are intensely de-
formed and mineral association in some country rocks
suggests temperatures around 500?C, compatible with
a metamorphism of higher greenschist to lower amphi-
bolite facies. Between these two extremes, structures and
metamorphic mineral association indicate an interme-
diate strain and metamorphic grade (Pires 1995, Rosière
et al. 2001).

The BIF’s occur all over the QF area and mark a
consistent and pervasive unit consisting in an impor-
tant stratigraphic marker. Basically, the BIF’s consist
of banded rocks of quartz and iron oxide layers, with
tabular to lens shape, alternating rhythmically. They
show pervasive foliation, coincident with the banding,
defined by well-developed platy hematite. The thickness
of individual layers varies from few to several millime-
ters and the major constituents are quartz, magnetite and
hematite. The studied samples were collected in the east
boundary of QF (Fig. 1) region. There are several shear
zones developed parallel to the compositional layering,
whose kinematic indicators, such as S-C foliation, are
all consistent with an interlayer reverse shear sense with
up-dip mineral lineation. The quartz domains are lens
shaped and frequently display a sigmoidal and asym-
metrical geometry, most of them parallel to the compo-
sitional layering (Fig. 2a).

METHODS

The microstructural features were described by optical
microscopy using regular thin sections. The quartz c-
axes orientations were measured in a U-stage mounted
on an optical microscope (Passchier and Trouw 1996).
The orientation pattern of hematite grains was obtained
using the SEM-EBSD system (Prior et al. 1999). In
addition, we have used SEM techniques to analyze the

morphology and distribution of pores on grain bound-
aries in a similar way as described in Watson and Bre-
nan (1987), Lee et al. (1991) and Hippertt (1994). We
have inferred the distribution of aqueous fluid based on
the distribution of pores in sections cut parallel to the
principal planes of the finite strain ellipsoid, i.e., XY,
parallel to foliation, XZ and YZ, perpendicular to foli-
ation and parallel and perpendicular to the mineral lin-
eation, respectively.

All sections for SEM examination were prepared
by carefully fracturing thin plates of rocks to ensure
that the fractures occur exclusively at grain boundaries.

After that, the fracture surfaces were cleaned with pres-
surized gas to blown small fragments off. Fractured sur-
faces were then gold coated and examined by SEM
(SEM JEOL 5510) operated at 25 kV, at Microscopy
Laboratory – Geology Department, Federal University
of Ouro Preto.

OPTICAL MICROSTRUCTURES

Optical thin sections were observed in XZ planes,
i.e. perpendicular to the foliation and parallel to the
lineation. The pervasive foliation in these tectonites is
characterized by an alternation of platy-hematite layers

with quartz-rich layers (Fig. 2a and 2b). The thickness
of these layers varies from a few microns to several
millimeters. The hematite grains have shapes varying
from tabular to platy. They have a wide range of sizes,
from a few microns to a few millimeters and several
of them are included in large quartz grains (Fig. 2c).
The included hematite grains show well-developed

faces (rhomb sections) and their average size is about
50 ?m. They are commonly found close to the bound-
aries of the host quartz.

Both, the hematite grains in the matrix (hematite
plates) and the included hematite grains (hematite plate-
lets) have a strong shape preferred orientation (Fig. 2d)
as well as crystallographic orientation with their c-axes

concentrated at the foliation pole (Fig. 3a). Quartz
grains in quartz-rich layers have a wide range of sizes
and shapes. There is a polymodal distribution of sizes
between 20 ?m and 2 mm. Shapes vary from tabular
(aspect ratio up to 10:1) to granular. Grain boundaries
are also characterized by a variety of geometries. Some
grains have straight boundaries (Fig. 2e), whereas others
have slight to pronounced curvatures (Fig. 2f). Several
observed grains have irregular boundaries and the lobate
shapes predominate. Irregular boundaries preferentially
occur on faces at a high angle to the direction of max-
imum elongation ( X -axis of the finite strain ellipsoid),
on which small inclusions of euhedral hematite grains
occur. On the other hand, boundaries of inequant quartz
grains normal to the maximum compression tend to be
straight and free of inclusions.

MICROFABRIC DATA

In general, quartz grains have strong c-axis preferred ori-
entation with a maximum close to Y -axis (Fig. 3b), dif-
ferently from orientation pattern observed for hematite
grains (Fig. 3a). Undulose extinctions consist of broad
stripes oriented obliquely to the compositional banding.
In addition, the grain boundaries are also preferentially
oriented. The pole figure and rose diagram in Figure 3
show the orientation pattern of grain boundary segments
according to sample reference system and black stripes
in the rose diagram highlight the segments parallel and
sub-parallel to foliation pole (Z direction). The grain
boundary segments are preferentially oriented sub-par-
allel to the rock foliation and, secondarily, they are ori-
ented normal to this structure (Fig. 3c, detail in the left
side). As the segments sub-parallel to Z direction must
represent grain boundaries parallel and sub-parallel to
YZ section or those normal to direction of maximum
extension (X direction), their orientation according to
quartz crystal reference system was determined. Thus,
the angles between the grain boundary pole represented
by the segments highlighted and the c-axes of the grains
limited for them were determined (Fig. 3c, histogram).

The distribution of angles between c-axes and grain
boundary poles show a preponderance of values between
50? and 80?, although the higher concentrations are ob-
served between 50 and 55?. Angular relations higher
than 80? also occur and those shorter than 33? are scarce.

According to quartz crystal reference system (Gonçalves
and Lagoeiro 2009a), the observed distribution pattern
characterizes the quartz-quartz grain boundaries normal
to direction of maximum extension (sub-parallel to YZ
sections) as surfaces belonging to rhombohedral and
trapezohedral girdles, preferentially. As indicated by
the orientation patterns of c-axes, prismatic surfaces are
common, while boundaries oriented according to basal
planes do not occur parallel to the YZ section. In a gen-
eral way, boundaries whose poles are at low angle to the
c-axes are rare (Fig. 3c, histogram).

SEM MICROSTRUCTURES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS

SEM images (Fig. 4), in three perpendicular sections,
XY, XZ and YZ, reveal the pore distribution and grain-
boundary topography showing that fracture surfaces in
the iron formation rocks reveal a complex set of pores
and grain boundary structures. Since almost 100% of
the fracture surfaces are intergranular grain surfaces,
the observed structures provide insights into the syn-
deformational interactions between pores (fluid) and
grain boundaries.

QUARTZ-HEMATITE BOUNDARIES IN XY SECTIONS

Quartz grain boundaries in contact with hematite plates
oriented normal to the maximum compression direction
(i.e. XY sections) are typically flat and pore-free (Fig.
4a). In principle the absence of pores and flat quartz
boundaries in the XY sections cannot be used to dis-
tinguish between a dry boundary and one containing a
fluid. It is well know that it is possible to get fluid films
on grain boundaries in rocks undergoing deformation,
but once the deformation has stopped the fluid film
breaks up into isolated inclusions (Urai et al. 1986, Jin
et al. 1994, Daines and Kohlstedt 1997). However, the
boundaries in the XY sections are perfectly flat and no
isolated pores were observed on them. Two possibilities
are envisioned to explain why these boundaries do not
have any porosity and their surfaces are perfectly flat.

The absence of pores and the flat nature of the
boundaries might suggest the presence of a very thin
fluid film (&lt;2 nm, c.f. Raj 1982; wetting angle ? ? 0?,
i.e. grain surface wetted by the fluid). Such thin aque-
ous fluids are likely to be highly structured and may ex-
ert a profound influence on the kinetics of intergranu-
lar pressure solution. Therefore, the surfaces might be

wetted with thin fluid when the rock was being actively
deformed, but the deformation had stopped and the thin
film split up into isolated inclusions. The absence of
porosity on the surfaces might be explained by post-
kinematic textural adjustment due to static recrystalliza-
tion accommodated by dry grain boundary or intragrain
diffusion. In this case the present grain boundary mi-
crostructures are not exactly those of the peak of meta-
morphism and deformation. However, the static recrys-
tallization might be expected to occur in phase or grain
boundaries with different orientations with respect to
the bulk strain ellipsoid, namely XZ and YZ planes,
which are decorated with pores and inclusions of well-
formed hematite or quartz grains, as described in the
next sections.

Another possibility is that the phase boundaries
(XY orientation) were dry when grains were actively
deformed or at least in the late stage of deformation
and the nature of the phase boundaries result from the
contact between flat hematite face (mostly basal planes)
with quartz grains. It is worth to note that the major-
ity of quartz grains show c-axes oriented preferentially
around the Y -axis of the finite strain ellipsoid what im-
ply that basal (0001) faces of hematite grains (Fig. 3a)
are in contact with prismatic {10-10} faces of quartz
grains. Besides, the theory of crystal growth shows that
faces that grow slowly will be dissolved slowly (Tullis
1989). Then, would be more difficult to dissolve the
quartz grains whose prismatic planes are perpendicu-
lar to direction of maximum compression (Z direction).
Therefore, the pores should be rare in the XY surfaces,
naturally, and the presence of hematite plates should in-
crease the difficulty to generate them.

QUARTZ GRAIN BOUNDARIES PARALLEL TO THE

XZ PLANES

Quartz-quartz boundaries observed in XZ sections show
a distribution of regular faceted isolated pores. Depend-
ing on the face where the pores occur, triangular or pyra-
midal forms predominate (Fig. 4b and c). Grain bound-
ary topographies on faces parallel to XZ sections are
predominantly flat. The pores commonly have regular
shapes with faceted sides indicating crystallographically
controlled shapes (Wegner and Christie 1983). Pyrami-
dal (with flat bottom) and triangular (with curved sides
and concave bottom) shapes are common (Fig. 4b and

Fig. 4c, respectively). They vary in size from 1 ?m to
5 ?m and are relatively deep (3 ?m in depth for large
pores). The straight sides of the observed forms (Fig.
4b), as well as the round forms, characterize the XZ
quartz surfaces as basal planes, mainly (O’Donoghue
1987, Hippertt 1994), as indicated for the c-axes pre-
ferred orientation pattern (Fig. 3b). On the other hand,
the occurrence of triangular pores formed by straight
and curved sides (Fig. 4c) is related to those grains ori-
ented at high angle to the foliation, once this pore geo-
metry characterize rhombohedral boundaries (O’Dono-
ghue 1987, Hippertt 1994) parallel to XZ surfaces.

The regular form of the pores indicates, besides
the crystallographic control (Wegner and Christie 1983),
that a thermodynamic equilibrium between solid-fluid
was achieved along these boundaries. The presence of
isolated pores indicates a non-wetting fluid distribution
(Lee et al. 1991) or that the fluid phase on these quartz
grain boundaries did not exist as a continuous film.
However, pores generally occur close to three- (indicated
by arrows in Fig. 4b) and four-grain junctions (arrow
head in Fig. 4b). This kind of concentration of pores,
in addition to the presence of openings along three-grain
junctions and voids at four-grain junctions, indicates that
the aqueous fluid phase may also have resided along
the quartz three-grain junctions (grain edge channels). It
might have existed as a continuous interconnected fluid
network, with fluid at two-grain junctions confined to
isolated pores.

QUARTZ-QUARTZ INTERFACES FACING THE DIRECTION OF

MAXIMUM EXTENTION (YZ SECTIONS)

In contrast, pores along boundaries facing the direction
of maximum extension (approximately parallel to the
YZ section) are abundant. These interfaces are charac-
terized by highly irregular topographies where ‘protru-
sions’ and ‘depressions’, as well as irregular pores pre-
dominate (Fig. 4d, e and f). Pores on these boundaries
are highly irregular in shape and 20 ?m across. Fea-
tures that resemble protrusions are separated for large
isolated depressions or pores and the height of the pro-
trusions above depressions varies and may reach up to
4 ?m. Depressions observed on grain surfaces on one
face of a fracture are not complemented by protrusions,
which would fill these depressions on the other face of
the fracture.

SEM OBSERVATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURES 883

Small hematite and quartz grains occur inside some

of the pores. They are predominantly faceted and have

shape preferred orientation (SPO) with their longest axes

oriented in the direction of maximum extension ( X -axis)

(Fig. 4f and g). Grain sizes inside the pores may vary

from few ?m to 20 ?m. They are generally well formed

with distinct crystallographic forms (Fig. 4g). In some

micrographs hematite grains have been plucked off to-

gether with quartz leaving their impression (negative

crystal) on the opposing quartz boundary (Fig. 4h).

Some of these negative crystals exhibit perfect rhombic

shapes of the hematite grains.

The quartz host grain boundaries with inclusions,

irregular topography and pores are commonly present

where quartz grains are in contact with larger hematite

plates parallel to the bulk foliation (Fig. 4f). The ir-

regular shape of the pores indicates that fluid at these

boundaries was not in thermodynamic equilibrium with

the solid. Moreover, the presence of precipitated quartz

and hematite grains inside the larger pores indicates that

aqueous fluid at these boundaries was saturated in Si

(SiO2) and Fe (Fe2O3). These features imply that grain

boundaries normal to the direction of maximum exten-

sion are sites of preferential fluid concentration. In ad-

dition, the irregular topography of these boundaries in-

dicates that substantial grain growth may have occurred

parallel to the direction of maximum extension (grain

boundary migration).

It is well known that the crystallographic orienta-

tion and the presence of water (and other aqueous

fluids) have a significant effect on grain boundary mo-

bility (Urai et al. 1986, Karato 1989). The new precip-

itated grains grow with their c-axes aligned parallel to

the maximum extension direction, indicating that un-

der conditions where fluid phase is in contact with the

growing boundaries, grains oriented with basal planes

approximately normal to the extension direction grow

faster (Tullis 1989, Hippertt 1994). Then, the growth is

faster in some crystallographic directions than others.

However, when the host grains in the studied sam-

ples are considered some discrepancies occur and it

is necessary to consider that the grain growth presum-

ably involves mass transport in the quartz-water system

through a fluid phase or along grain surfaces (Tullis and

Yund 1982). Thus, the growth for the host grains oc-

cur parallel to the maximum extension direction, but

differently from the new precipitated grains, through

the migration of grain surfaces whose poles make high

angles with the c-axes. The migrating quartz bound-

aries (large non-precipitated host grains) make, prefer-

entially, angles higher than 50? with the c-axes and then

they should represent rhombohedral, trapezohedral and

prismatic faces (Fig. 3c). Those boundaries that make

less than 10? with the c-axes compound only 1.0% of

the boundaries whose orientation was measured and

only 8.5% of the data present angles smaller than 30?

(Fig. 3c). Therefore, basal and sub-basal faces parallel

to YZ surfaces are rare, for the host grains.

The higher solubility of quartz in the fluid bound-

ary (YZ surfaces) may promote grain boundary migration

since water dissolved in quartz lattice enhances solid-

state kinetics (dislocation motion and diffusion). The

tiny entrapped hematite grains included in the YZ faces

of quartz grains should exert a dragging effect on the

migrating quartz boundaries. The presence of hematite

grains inside the boundaries increases the interfacial

free energy of the grain, because they promote an in-

crease in the interfacial area as the grain boundary ad-

vances and traps the hematite grains. However, the drag-

ging effect of hematite grains on growing grain bound-

ary may be overcome by the higher solubility of quartz

faces in contact with fluid, hence enhancing the grain

boundary mobility, i.e., the rate which the material

(atoms) can transfer through the grain boundary (accord-

ing to X direction).

DISCUSSION

The different pore topographies observed along bound-

aries with different orientations and the anisotropic dis-

tribution of pores along these boundaries may suggest

that the fluid distribution and grain boundary structures

in these rocks were highly anisotropic. Furthermore, on

boundaries oriented at high angle to the X -axis, precipi-

tated hematite grains suggest that these boundaries were

sites of preferential precipitation (Fig. 5).

A physical model (Fig. 5) to explain the anisotropic

fluid distribution and grain growth is proposed. It takes

into account the microstructures observed in thin sec-

tions, the distribution and characterization of pores, as

well as the grain boundary structures along the three

different sections studied (i.e. XY, XZ and YZ planes

of the finite strain ellipsoid).

FLUID DISTRIBUTION AND DRIVING FORCE FOR

GRAIN GROWTH

We interpret the pore structures observed in these rocks

as a result of anisotropic distribution of aqueous fluid

along grain boundaries. The presence of quartz host

grains having straight or smoothly curved grain bound-

aries, in addition to the presence of included small

hematite grains close to the boundaries facing the di-

rection of maximum extension, provides evidence for

two possible mechanisms that can produce the observed

microstructural features: anisotropic grain boundary mi-

gration and recrystallization; and anisotropic crystal

growth. Anisotropic grain boundary migration and re-

crystallization are relatively common processes and they

account for these common features in metamorphic tec-

tonites (Blenkinsop 2000). However, although the re-

crystallization processes have important role in the for-

mation of the anisotropic shape of grains in the tec-

tonites studied (Castro 2007, Gonçalves and Lagoeiro

2009b), our study is focused on the evidence of fluid-

grain interaction and its influence on the anisotropic

syn-kinematic and static crystal growth.

The grain boundary and pore geometries suggest a

fluid-solid interaction in these rocks and also indicate

that static grain growth (involving grain boundary mi-

gration in the presence of fluid at relatively high tem-

perature) might have been an important process during

the evolution of microstructures in these rocks. The driv-

ing force for grain growth should be the reduction of

the total grain boundary area (grain boundary area re-

duction – GBAR) (Vernon 1976, Poirier 1985), result-

ing in a reduction of the interfacial free energy for the

aggregate. The grain boundary migration that accom-

plishes grain growth may be caused by the difference

in free energy across the grain boundary curvature. The

free energy difference makes a boundary move toward

its center of curvature, causing small grains to decrease

in size (and then disappear) and large ones to increase.

The difference between the strain energy stored in adja-

cent grains could be the driving force for grain bound-

ary migration, but as there are no optical features indi-

cating differences in crystal plastic deformation between

neighbor quartz grains, it should not play a major role

in the process.

Static grain growth occurs when deformation de-

celerates or ceases, and the aggregate is not in a state of

minimum free energy. Grains still contain dislocations

and subgrains. At conditions with temperature relatively

high and a large amount of fluid is present along grain

boundaries, recovery, recrystallization and GBAR may

occur until a configuration characterized by a state of

minimum free energy can be reached. Under these con-

ditions characterized by a state of hydrostatic stress, fluid

distribution will be isotropic and so will favor the grain

growth. The final aggregate will be comprised of grains

of unimodal grain size. However, in the studied rocks

the quartz grains have a relatively high aspect ratio (up

to 4:1 depending on the hematite content) and the pore

distribution along grain boundaries is highly anisotropic,

which indicates that the grains have grown under non-

hydrostatic stress conditions and constrained by platy

hematite grains.

The anisotropy of interfacial energies and the non-

hydrostatic stress on the aggregate produce significant

deviations from the fluid distribution predicted by iso-

tropic equilibrium theory and then it may be accounted

for the anisotropic growth rates observed in the rocks

studied (Heidug 1991, Tullis et al. 1996). Walff and

Faul (1992) have shown that the anisotropy of interfa-

cial energies can produce connected fluid distributions

at some grain junctions but isolated pores at others. It

is worth noting that the way in which fluids are dis-

tributed along grain boundaries depends on the nature

of mineral interfaces. In this case, only phase bound-

aries (hematite-quartz) may yield a film fluid distribu-

tion (Fig. 5a – no pores were observed along these

boundaries and no triangular features of hematite are

impressed on quartz grain faces).

Hence, anisotropic grain growth is a result of het-

erogeneous fluid distribution along grain boundaries,

which is caused by the differential stress and the pres-

ence of hematite. Oriented hematite plates that together

with the slightly tabular quartz grains define the folia-

tion have a profound effect on the nature of fluid dis-

tribution in these rocks. Hematite plates might have a

role very similar to mica and other phyllosilicates in

quartzite. It might maintain fluid along the interphase

boundaries (hematite/fluid/quartz) even under high nor-

mal stress (Fig. 5a). Thus the presence of hematite en-

hances the wetting behavior of fluid, promoting the dis-

solution and increasing grain boundary diffusion rates

at these interphase boundaries. The presence of fluid

along the phase boundaries provides a faster diffusional

transport path between hematite and quartz grains than

in other interfaces.

The grain scale transport of aqueous fluids in the

rocks studied depend on the nature of the grain bound-

aries as well as on the orientation of the grain bound-

aries with respect to the principal axes of the finite strain

ellipsoid. Fluid-assisted diffusion on the phase bound-

aries (normal to the maximum compression direction)

provides the rapid transport of material. On quartz-

quartz interfaces transport took place through an inter-

connected network of pores along three- and four-grain

junctions. Quartz boundaries normal to the X -axis, pref-

erentially rhombohedral and prismatic surfaces for the

quartz crystals, are sites of fluid concentration and de-

position (Fig. 5b). Thus quartz boundaries migrate pref-

erentially parallel to the direction of maximum elonga-

tion. Therefore, mass transport is more effective parallel

to the X -axis, resulting in faster grain growth in this di-

rection corresponding to migration of boundaries whose

poles make high angle with quartz c-axes. It is worth to

note that it is opposite to growth condition of new pre-

cipitated quartz grains (Tullis 1989, Hippertt 1994).

Consequently, the shape preferred orientation ob-

served in these rocks might not be exclusively attributed

to recrystallization since anisotropic grain growth might

have had a significant contribution to the development of

aspect ratio of the grains. A similar result was achieved

by Karato and Masuda (1989) in experimental deforma-

tion of wetted quartz aggregates carried out under dif-

ferential stress. They found evidences for the formation

of grain shape by anisotropic grain growth, as a result of

anisotropic water distribution caused by a large differen-

tial stress.

CONCLUSIONS

Microstructural observations of quartz-hematite tecton-

ites indicate that anisotropic fluid distribution and grain

growth have exerted an important role on the fabric evo-

lution of banded iron formation from Quadrilátero Fer-

rífero (MG). Below are summarized the main conclu-

sions of the present study.

(1) In addition to the anisotropic grain boundary mi-

gration and recrystallization, anisotropic dissolu-

tion and grain growth were responsible for the for-

mation of hematite plates and tabular quartz grains

contributing significantly to the generation of the

penetrative foliation observed in these rocks.

(2) Based on pore distribution, fluid distribution was

highly anisotropic. The anisotropy results from the

nature of grain boundaries as well as the orienta-

tion of the finite strain axes. Although we cannot

conclude about the nature of fluid distribution on

pore-free flat surfaces oriented normal to the maxi-

mum compression direction, we interpret that these

phase boundaries were wetted with a continuous

fluid film, which might be important in the disso-

lution of both quartz and hematite grains, acting

as faster diffusion pathway for transferring the dis-

solved material from the dissolution site to sites of

precipitation. At quartz-quartz boundaries normal

to the intermediate strain axis, fluids occur as iso-

lated pores typically faceted, reflecting crystallo-

graphic control, close to quartz-quartz edges, char-

acterizing a fluid interconnected network along

three- and four-grain junctions on quartz-quartz

interfaces.

(3) Quartz boundaries normal to the maximum elon-

gation direction are sites of fluid concentration and

precipitation. On these boundaries small oriented

faceted hematite and quartz grains were precipi-

tated in large irregular pores. Grain growth rates

are faster parallel to the X -axis.

(4) The presence of hematite plates may have a strong

effect on wetting behavior of fluid in these rocks

in a manner similar to that of micas in quartzites.

Hematite-quartz phase boundaries might have

physical and chemical properties very different

from quartz-quartz interfaces. Even under high

normal stresses the phase boundaries might main-

tain a continuous fluid film, increasing greatly the

diffusion rates along these boundaries. This condi-

tion allows a faster quartz crystal growth parallel to

rhombohedral, trapezohedral and prismatic bound-

aries, differently from what is proposed for new

precipitated grains, which grow parallel to basal

planes.

(5) In two distinct situations the presence of hema-

tite influences the kinetics of quartz grain growth.

First, small precipitated hematite grains may have

a pinning effect on quartz grain boundary migra-

tion (boundaries facing the maximum elongation

direction). Second, the mean grain size of host

quartz grains is substantially smaller in domains

with higher content of hematite.

RESUMO

Muitos estudos têm demonstrado o efeito de uma segunda

fase sobre a distribuição de fase fluida e dissolução de grãos

de quartzo. Entretanto, como a maioria das observações vêm

de agregados deformados sob condições de tensão hidrostática

e em rochas quartzosas ricas em mica, a distribuição 3D de

poros em bordas quartzo-quartzo (BQQ) e quartzo-hematita

(BQH) tem sido estudada. Várias superfícies de fraturas orien-

tadas segundo o elipsóide de deformação finita foram anali-

sadas. A distribuição dos poros caracteriza a porosidade e a

forma dos grãos como altamente anisotrópicas, o que resulta

da natureza e orientação das bordas. BQH têm propriedades

físico/químicas muito diferentes de BQQ, uma vez que as

plaquetas de hematita têm forte efeito no comportamento do

fluido, de maneira similar às micas em quartzitos. Elas são

superfícies planas, livres de poros, normais à direção de máxi-

mo encurtamento, sugerindo que estiveram, em um momento,

cobertas por um filme contínuo de fluido agindo como um ca-

minho mais rápido de difusão. Nas BQQ, os poros são faceta-

dos, isolados, concentrados nos limites das mesmas refletindo

o controle cristalográfico e uma rede interconectada de flui-

do ao longo das junções dos grãos. As BQQ normais à di-

reção de máxima extensão são sítios de concentração de flui-

do. Como consequência, a dissolução anisotrópica e o cresci-

mento de grãos foram responsáveis pela formação de plaquetas

de hematita e grãos de quartzo tabulares contribuindo signi-

ficativamente para a geração da foliação observada nas rochas

estudadas.
