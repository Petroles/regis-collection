Abstract- The production of citrus seedlings in protected environment requires a large amount 
of substrate, which must have adequate physical and chemical characteristics. The use of acidic 
conditioners, such as Pinus needles mixed with alkaline substrates, allows the cultivation of 
seedlings with better quality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the development of 
the “Fepagro C37 Reck” rootstock grown in different alkaline commercial substrate mixtures 
(Humosolo ES®) with Pinus elliottii needles. The experiment was carried out by testing alkaline 
substrate mixed with 5-month old of decomposition Pinus needles in situ decomposition and two 
granulometry sizes, 3.5 and 8.0 mm. The mixtures were performed in proportions between the 
needles with the Humosolo, (v / v) 0%; 25%; 50%; 75% and 100%. Expanded cellular polystyrene 
trays were used to accommodate the mixtures and seeding of the rootstock. Physical and chemical 
evaluateons of the mixtures were carried out, as well as the development of the seedlings. The 
use of Pinus needles acidified the substrate Humosolo ES®, reduced its electrical conductivity 
and increased the percentage of porous space of the mixtures and reduced water retention. The 
treatments containing 25 and 50% of the Pinus needles mixture, regardless of the granulometry, 
provide greater development of rootstock plants “Fepagro C37 Reck”.

Resumo- A produção de mudas de citros em ambiente protegido demanda grande quantidade 
de substrato, o qual deve apresentar características físicas e químicas adequadas. O uso de 
condicionadores ácidos, como acículas de Pinus, em mistura com substratos alcalinos, possibilita o 
cultivo de mudas com maior qualidade. O objetivo foi avaliar o desenvolvimento do porta-enxerto 
“Fepagro C37 Reck” cultivado em diferentes misturas do substrato comercial alcalino (Humosolo 
ES®) com acículas de Pinus elliottii. O experimento foi realizado testando misturas entre o substrato 
alcalino e acículas de Pinus com cinco meses de decomposição in situ e em duas granulometrias: 
3,5 e 8,0 mm. As misturas foram realizadas em proporções entre as acículas com o Humosolo, 
(v/v) de 0%; 25%; 50%; 75% e 100%. Utilizaram-se bandejas alveoladas de poliestireno expandido 
para acomodação das misturas e semeadura do porta-enxerto. Realizaram-se avaliações físicas e 
químicas das misturas, bem como do desenvolvimento das mudas. A utilização de acícula de Pinus 
acidificou o substrato Humosolo ES®, reduziu sua condutividade elétrica e tornou as misturas com 
maior porcentagem de espaço poroso e menor retenção de água. Os tratamentos contendo mistura 
de 25 e 50% de acícula, indiferentemente da granulometria, proporcionam maior desenvolvimento 
de plantas do porta-enxerto “Fepagro C37 Reck”.

Introduction

Agribusiness is an extremely important sector for 
the Brazilian economy. In relation to the fruit industry, 
citrus is considered one of the most important segments, 
not only for human nutrition, but also for the economic 
values obtained with this product, supplying the domestic 
and international market. However, there are numerous 
bottlenecks in the production chain, especially in the 
production of seedlings.

The most used citrus rootstocks in Rio Grande do 
Sul are “Trifoliata” (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) and 
their hybrids, due to their tolerance to lower temperatures. 
One of these hybrids, “Fepagro C37 Reck”, has desirable 
characteristics such as induction of canopy tolerance to low 
winter temperatures; reduction of plant size; promotion of 
the production of quality fruits; in addition to presenting 
a faster development in the nursery in comparison to P. 
trifoliata (OLIVEIRA et al., 2010; KOLLER, 2013). 
Hence, the average time for the production of citrus 
seedlings in Rio Grande do Sul using the open-air system 
is, on average, three years (KOLLER, 1994), compared to 
hot climate regions. On the other hand, the production of 
seedlings in the protected environment allows producing 
a seedling in up to 22 months, which demands a great 
amount of substrate since the production is carried out in 
containers (AZEVEDO et al., 2009).

Substrate is any material of mineral and/or 
organic origin, pure or in a mixture, capable of providing 
anchoring and supplying the water and oxygen needs of 
plants (VENCE, 2008). This input of great importance 
in the cultivation in containers can be altered by using 
different materials, particle size, humidity, therefore, 
providing themselves with new material with unique 
characteristics.

Most of the substrates are produced using composted 
Pinus bark (YAMAGUTI, 2009). In Rio Grande do Sul, 
because the adequate and available-for-citrus substrates 
are scarce, there is a need to import products, which result 
in high costs, mainly for freight. According to Schäfer et 
al. (2015), most of the substrates evaluated in the southern 
region show negative aspects such as alkaline pH and high 
electrical conductivity (salinity). Therefore, materials that 
are chemically and physically stable and inexpensive are 
more and more desired. 

The cultivation of Pinus sp. involves large 
extensions of land in southern Brazil, representing 
26.5% of national reforestation, occupying an area of 
approximately 1.8 million hectares (GIONGO et al., 
2011). This crop stands out as a raw material in several 
industrial activities, which are an essential base for the 
economy. However, it generates countless residues in 
its production such as Pinus needles. Piovesan et al. 
(2012) observed an annual accumulation of 7.1 Mg ha-1 
of litter in an 8-year-old Pinus crop, which was formed 

by 95.6% of the needles. This material, which has not 
yet been explored, has already been reported as having 
low pH (VERDONCK et al., 1981; GOMES et al., 1991; 
RISTOW et al., 2009), and may be an alternative material 
to minimize pH alkalinity of certain substrates.

Due to the characteristics of the mentioned 
material and to the great importance of the substrate in 
the cultivation of plants in containers, the objective of this 
work was to evaluate the production of a citrus rootstock 
(“Fepagro C37 Reck”) grown in different proportions of 
an alkaline commercial substrate, due to the characteristics 
of the previously mentioned materials and the great 
importance of the substrate (Hum solo ES®) and crushed 
Pinus elliottii needles on the germination phase.

Material and methods

The experiment was conducted in a protected 
environment, covered with polyethylene and with anti-
aphid screen walls, with no temperature control and 
relative humidity, at the Faculdade de Agronomia of the 
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, located in Porto 
Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul (30º04’S, 51º08’W; 38 
m above sea level). This experiment consisted of different 
mixtures (v/v) of a commercial substrate using Pinus 
elliottii needles at 5-month old in situ decomposition, 
at the senescence stage, but still adhered to the plants, 
without contact with the soil. Under these conditions, 
samples of adult trees from the same stand were collected. 
Such trees had been fallen down five months ago at the 
Agronomic Experiment Station of the Federal University 
of Rio Grande do Sul (EEA / UFRGS; 30º29’S and 
51º06’W; 46 m above sea level). 

The needles were dried in a sheltered place over a 
bench with an average temperature of 25 ºC for 15 days. 
Afterward, they were crushed in two different particle 
sizes (3.5 mm and 8.0 mm) in a sieve mill and mixed at 
five percentages (0; 25; 50; 75 and 100%) to the substrate 
(Humosolo ES®) from VIDA Company. This input made 
on the basis of eucalyptus bark has optimum physical 
characteristics for use in containers, but its pH is slightly 
alkaline (pH 7.2 ± 0.5). 

The mixtures were placed in 121.2 cm³ expanded 
polystyrene trays of inverted pyramidal shape (120 x 
50 mm - depth x cell width). Sowing of the rootstock 
“Fepagro C37 Reck” [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. x 
Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck.], from matrices located in 
the EEA/UFRGS, was carried out in October 2014. The 
seeds were submitted to thermal treatment (immersion in 
water at 52ºC for 10 minutes), after which a seed per cell 
was placed at 0.5 cm depth. Irrigation management was 
automated and consisted of three daily micro-sprinkler 
cycles, totaling an average of 3 mm day-1. No additional 
fertilizations were carried out on the substrates over the

growing period.
Electrical conductivity (?S cm-1) and pH (in H2O) 

of the substrates were monitored using the non-destructive 
Pour Thru method, according to Cavins et al. (2000) 
over the cultivation cycle. After 49 days of sowing, the 
variables emergence percentage and seedling formation, 
average emergence time and emergence speed index were 
evaluated, which was determined based on the sum of the 
number of emerged seedlings, divided by the respective 
time, and then dividing the final result by the total number 
of seedlings emerged in each replicate. In addition, at 
the end of the experiment, 166 days after sowing, the 
variables height, diameter, dry mass of the aerial part, dry 
mass of the roots, leaf count and leaf area were measured. 
However, height was measured with the aid of a measuring 
tape, from the surface of the substrate to the apical point 
of the seedling; the diameter was measured using a digital 
caliper at one centimeter from the base, and the leaf area 
was obtained on a Li-Cor Li-3100 leaf area meter.

The different substrate formulations were submitted 
to chemical and physical analysis at the Substrates 
Laboratory of the Department of Horticulture and Forestry 
(DHS) at the Faculty of Agronomy (UFRGS), in Porto 
Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul.

The experimental design used in the study was a 
randomized block design with split-plots. The main plot 
consisted of the proportions of Pinus elliottii needles 
in the composition of the substrates (0; 25; 50; 75 and 
100%), and the subplots were the particle size (3.5 and 
8.0 mm). Each treatment consisted of four replicates of 
12 cells each. Data were submitted to analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) by the Costat 6.4 software, and polynomial 
regression by SigmaPlot 11.0 at the level of 1% (**) and 
5% (*) of a probability of error, in order to verify the effect 
of the percentage of leaf on the substrate composition. 
The electrical conductivity data did not meet the ANOVA 
assumptions and because of that, they were therefore 
transformed into log x/10.

Results and discussion

Statistical analysis of the data showed no interaction 
between particle size and Pinus needles proportion for the 
variables tested in the study. However, the different ratios 
of the needles used in the composition of the substrates 
influenced the growth and development of the “Fepagro 
C37 Reck” rootstock (Table 1). 

The Pinus needles showed acidic pH, regardless 
of granulometry, while the pure commercial substrate 
(0% leaf treatment), alkaline pH. As the percentage of 
the needles increased, the pH reduced proportionally, 
reaching intermediate values to the pure materials. 
However, this pH change was most evident when the 
percentage of the needles was higher than 75% at the 

beginning of the cultivation (Figure 1A and B). In addition, 
greater acidification of the substrate was found 40 days 
after sowing in the treatments that presented the highest 
proportions of needles in the mixture.

Although the amplitude between the substrates 
was greater in the first evaluation, the pH values of the 
materials tended to be nearer over time probably due to the 
low potential acidity of the Pinus needles and to the low 
buffering effect of the substrate. The large pH variation 
occurred mainly in the 100% needles treatment (Figure 
1A and B), excluding the possibility of the commercial 
substrate buffer effect. Several factors may cause changes 
in the pH of the medium, such as the decomposition of 
the source material, the release of exudates by the roots 
of the plants, the alkalinity of the irrigation water and the 
fertilization (FOCHESATO et al., 2008; SCHÄFER et 
al., 2008). The variation in the pH verified in this study 
is likely to be caused by the alkalinity of irrigation water.

The need to leach 20% of the watering so to 
facilitate gas exchange within the cultivation container 
could have favored the mentioned effect. This is because 
the application of a volume of water over irrigation to 
reach the pot capacity or a volume exceeding that capacity 
by 20% may have altered the pH of the medium, as well 
as through leaching, the amount of salts over cultivation 
could have decreased (Figure 1C and D), since the average 
value of pH and EC of the irrigation water during the 
conduction period of the experiment was 6.1 ± 0.5 and 
110.0 ± 1.0 ?S cm-1, respectively. Therefore, Pinus needles 
provide relative acidity, capable of acidifying the medium 
if used at a large proportion. However, the maintenance 
of an adequate pH value can be adjusted with acidic 
reaction fertilization or pH adjustment of the irrigation 
water, thus maintaining the ideal pH for the cultivation 
of potted plants.

In relation to the electrical conductivity (EC), the 
results showed that the reduction of the granulometry 
resulted in higher release of ions to the solution and, 
consequently, the increase in the electrical conductivity. 
This fact was verified by the difference between the 
treatments of 100% needles at the 3.5 mm granulometry 
showing 600 ?S cm-1 and in the 8.0 mm granulometry at 
231.5 ?S cm -1, both on the sowing day (Figure 1C and D).

The value of EC presented by the substrate 
Humosolo ES® manufacturer is higher than that of the 
Pinus needles, with an average value of 2100 ± 500 ?S 
cm-1, which was verified in the treatment of 0% needles 
and zero time (Figure 1C and D). It has also been found 
that as the ratio of the leaf increases, EC decreased in 
the formulated substrate. In spite of the granulometry 
and percentage of the needles, the substrates showed low 
levels - for the treatment without addition of the needles 
(treatment 0%) - to very low - for the treatments with 
a large percentage of needles at the beginning of the 
experiment, according to classification established by 



4 H. Ceccagno et al.

Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 3:  (e-039)                                                                      

Cavins et al. (2000). 
The high EC reduction over the crop is caused by 

the leaching of the soluble salts through the irrigation 
system. Thus, none of the treatments exceeded the EC 
index considered normal for substrates (2600 to 4600 ?S 
cm-1) (CAVINS et al., 2000). This feature is positive since 
plant nutrition can be managed by precisely meeting the 
crop requirement. Fagundes et al. (2015), when evaluating 
the development of yellow passion fruit seedlings report 
that the loss of nutrients by leaching is a serious issue in 
the seedling production system, since it represents a loss 
of capital in the form of nutrients and water, as well as 
extending the time for the formation of seedlings, due to 
the lower availability of fertilizers.

Regarding the physical characteristics of the 
substrates, properties such as density, total porosity and 
water retention capacity influence the development of the 
plants (COSTA; DANTAS, 2009) and the management 
to be used over cultivation. The reduction in the particle 
size resulted in an increase in the density of Pinus needles. 
However, the increase in the needles percentage to the 
commercial substrate provided a reduction in density 
because Humosolo ES® had a density as many as four 
times of that of the needles. According to Kämpf et al. 
(2006), substrates with a density of less than 300 kg m-³ are 
recommended for use in multicellular trays; with density 
between 200 and 400 kg m-³, they are recommended for 
pots up to 15 cm high; and density of 300 to 500 kg m-³ is 
suggested for pots with 20 to 30 cm in height. According 
to this classification, all the formulations tested in this 
study had adequate density to be used in pots. This result 
confirms the hypothesis of the use of Pinus needles in the 
composition of substrates since the search for new organic 
materials that meet these requirements is fundamental for 
the development of a new substrate as a large part of the 
organic materials such as barks and bagasse showed higher 
densities than those recommended for cultivation in pots. 

The density of a substrate can be altered by the 
packing density, associated with the moisture content of 
the material. Changes in density over cultivation of the 
plants modify the physical properties of the substrate. 
Therefore, the increase in solids content per volume unit 
may influence the voids ratio (pore to solids ratio), total 
porosity, aeration space, water retention capacity and 
root penetrability (mechanical impedance) (FERMINO; 
KÄMPF, 2012). Among these changes, those occurring 
in water retention and mechanical impedance standout 
as problems with excess water and difficulties in the 
penetrability of the substrate may occur, damaging the 
development of the plants. Hence, the higher the substrate 
compaction, the greater the percentage of malformed 
seedlings.

It was possible to observe from the water retention 
curve that the substrates with higher density had a 
higher percentage of solids, while the use of needles 

in the formulations provided a larger aeration space. 
Needles with 3.5 mm provided a higher percentage of 
solids, a smaller aeration space and a greater amount of 
readly available water in relation to the use of 8.0 mm 
granulometry needles (Figure 2). According to Faria et 
al. (2013) and Souza et al. (2010), the aeration space 
is considered a determinant factor in the quality of the 
substrates, as it provides greater root hair development, 
which promotes an increase in the absorption of water and 
nutrients (BELLÉ, 2001).

The differences found in the physical characterization 
for the different formulations do not make unfeasible their 
use as substrates. However, care should be taken with the 
frequency of irrigation adopted, since the low percentage 
of available water compared to the ideal parameters is 
easily corrected with a higher frequency of irrigation.

Although the substrates showed different physical 
characteristics, they did not influence the emergence 
process of the “Fepagro C37 Reck” rootstock (Table 
2). The average time of emergency was approximately 
35 days; emergence speed index rate was 0.03, and the 
percentage of seedlings formed was greater than 93% in 
all treatments. Rieth et al. (2012) when evaluating the 
development of citrus rootstocks also did not verify the 
influence of the substrate on the final values of emergence. 
However, according to Sá et al. (2015), the salinity of the 
substrate may generate imbalances in the germination, 
which was not verified in the present study because the 
low electrical conductivity and the low water retention of 
the mixtures, associated to the high frequency of irrigation, 
provided excellent emergency rates.

In relation to height (Figure 3A) and diameter 
(Figure 3B) of the seedlings, a negative quadratic tendency 
was found as the proportion of needles was increased in 
the composition of the substrates, with a maximum point 
between 25 and 50% leaf treatments. After 40 days of 
sowing, as the treatments had the same pH range and 
EC, remaining stable until the end of the experiment, the 
superior growth of the seedlings grown in the formulations 
containing 25 and 50% of needles is likely to be explained 
by the characteristics (Figure 2) where the water retention 
curves were very similar, which may have benefited from 
the adopted management.

The treatments that provided the greatest values for 
the height and diameter of the seedlings also provided the 
greatest number of leaves (Figure 3C) and leaf area (Figure 
3D). The treatment composed of 100% of Pinus needles 
conferred a lower growth rate, due to the low EC and lower 
retention of water in relation to the other substrates. The 
pure commercial substrate allowed a superior result only 
when compared to the 100% needles treatment, evidencing 
that the addition of this material to the alkaline substrate 
generated benefit, assuring a better growth of the “Fepagro 
C37 Reck” rootstock.



5Potential of Pinus elliottii Engelm. needles as substrate conditioner for the production of “Fepagro C37 Reck” ...

Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 3:  (e-039)                                                                      

In relation to the dry mass of the aerial part and of 
the root system, a quadratic negative behavior was found 
in relation to the needles percentage (Figure 3E and F, 
respectively). The maximum accumulation point of dry 
biomass of the seedlings was verified between treatments 
with 25 and 50% needles. This result is justified by the 
lower retention of water and low fertility of substrates 
with a high percentage of needles. 

The substrate Humosolo ES® showed higher 
electrical conductivity but did not influence positively 
the seedlings development, evidencing that the physical 

characteristics had a greater influence on the growth of 
these plants. Also, the lack of needles in the substrate 
composition provided a higher percentage of remaining 
water, buffer water and solids, so it was evident the greater 
retention of water in relation to the other treatments, 
possibly causing damage to the growth of the seedlings. 
However, the association of the Pinus elliottii needles with 
the substrate Humosolo ES® resulted in a reduction in the 
amount of solids and, consequently, an increase in total 
porosity, providing the ideal conditions for the “Fepagro 
C37” rootstock plants to express their potential growth.

Rev. Bras. Frutic., Jaboticabal, 2019, v. 41, n. 3:  (e-039)                                                                      

Conclusion

The addition of 25% to 50% of Pinus elliottii 
needles with granulometry between 3.5 mm and 8.0 mm 
to the substrate Humosolo ES® resulted in a faster growth 
and vegetative growth of seedlings of the rootstock 
“Fepagro C37 Reck” over the germination phase.
