resumo 
 
 

Atualmente uma das grandes preocupações a nível mundial centra-se no 

desenvolvimento de novos materiais sustentáveis que possam ser usados em 

substituição dos produtos derivados do petróleo. Por este motivo, o estudo dos 

processos de produção de bioplásticos tem sido alvo de pesquisa intensiva de 

forma a conseguir alcançar a otimização e redução dos custos de produção 

destes materiais. Neste contexto, o estudo da produção de 

polihidroxialcanoatos (PHAs) por culturas microbianas mistas (MMC) faz todo o 

sentido. Neste trabalho, o processo de três passos foi testado para a produção 

de PHA. Numa primeira etapa, um subproduto da indústria papeleira, o licor de 

cozimento ao sulfito ácido (HSSL) foi submetido a fermentação acidogénica 
para produzir uma mistura rica em ácidos gordos voláteis (VFAs), que foi 

usada como substrato nas duas etapas seguintes. Na segunda etapa, a MMC 

recolhida numa estação de tratamento de águas residuais (WWTP) foi 

submetida a condições de alimentação dinâmica aeróbia (ADF) num reator 

descontínuo sequencial (SBR), de forma a selecionar os organismos 

acumuladores de PHA. Um estado pseudo-estacionário foi atingido após 60 

dias de operação do SBR. Num terceiro passo, a capacidade da MMC 

selecionada em acumular PHA foi testada. A MMC atingiu um máximo de 

acumulação de PHA de 47,1%. 

A comunidade bacteriana foi analisada por fluorescence in situ hybridization 

(FISH). Foram identificadas bactérias pertencentes aos seguintes grupos: 

Beta- (44,7 ± 2,7%), Alfa- (13,6 ± 1,3%) e Gammaproteobacteria (2,40 ± 1,1%) 

e Bacteroidetes (9,20 ± 3,8%). 

A nível de género, dentro da classe Betaproteobacteria, uma quantidade 

considerável de Acidovorax (25,9 ± 3,1%) foi encontrada e foram detectadas 

em pequenas concentrações Thauera (0,72 ± 0,25%) e Azoarcus (0,62 ± 

0,02%). Defluvicoccus relacionada com organismos formadores de tétradas 

(0,75 ± 0,53%), pertencendo à classe Alphaproteobacteria, foram detectadas 

em pequena quantidade. 

Uma biblioteca de clones foi preparada e vários clones foram identificados 

como organismos previamente descritos como produtores de PHA.

abstract 

 
Currently one of the greatest concerns worldwide focuses on the development 

of new sustainable materials that can be used to replace petroleum-based 

products. For this reason, the study of the production of bioplastics has been 

subjected to considerable research in order to achieve process optimization 

and production costs reduction. In this context, the study of the production of 

polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by mixed microbial cultures (MMC) is worthwhile.  

In this work, the three-step process was tested for PHA production. In a first 

step, a feedstock of the paper industry, hardwood sulphite spent liquor (HSSL) 

was submitted to acidogenic fermentation in order to produce a mixture rich in 

volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which was used as substrate in the next two steps. 

In the second step, a MMC collected from a wastewater treatment plant 

(WWTP) was submitted to Aerobic Dynamic Feeding (ADF) conditions in a 

Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) in order to select PHA-accumulating 

organisms. A pseudo-stationary state was reached after 60 days of SBR 

operation. In the third step, the ability of the selected MMC to accumulate PHA 

was tested. The selected MMC reached a maximum PHA content of 47.1%.  

The bacterial community was analysed through fluorescence in situ 

hybridization (FISH). Bacteria belonging to the four main classes were 

identified: Beta- (44.7 ± 2.7%), Alpha- (13.6 ± 1.3%) and Gammaproteobacteria 

(2.40 ± 1.1%) and Bacteroidetes (9.20 ± 3.8%). 

Regarding the genus level, inside the Betaproteobacteria, a considerable 

amount of Acidovorax (25.9 ± 3.1%) was found and only small amounts of 

Thauera (0.72 ± 0.25%) and Azoarcus (0.62 ± 0.02%) were detected. 

Defluvicoccus related to Tetrad Forming Organisms (0.75 ± 0.53%) belonging 

to Alphaproteobacteria was detected in small amount. 

A clone library was prepared and several clones were identified as organisms 

already described as PHA-producers.

1. Introduction 

Plastics present versatile qualities of strength, lightness, durability and resistance to 

degradation. They have become an important material to enhance the comfort and quality 

of life. Plastics are an essential part of almost all industries and have replaced glass and 

paper in packaging. However, these very desirable properties have now become their 

greatest problem (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). The exponential growth of the human 

population has led to the accumulation of huge amounts of non-degradable waste materials 

across our planet. Living conditions in the biosphere are therefore changing dramatically, 

in such a way that the presence of non-biodegradable residues is affecting the potential 

survival of many species (Luengo et al 2003). As the conventional plastics derive from oil, 

other problems were raised. The limitation of oil reserves and the instability in oil prices 

are two of the drawbacks of the consumption of these resources (da Costa Sousa et al 

2009). In addition, several environmental changes are being caused by the rise of 

greenhouse gases emissions (Jefferson 2006). In response to the harmful effects of plastics 

on the environment, there is a considerable interest in the development of biodegradable 

materials (Choi and Lee 1997). Among the various biodegradable polymeric materials, 

polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) attracted industrial attention because of their potential use 

as practical biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastics (Tsuge 2002).  

Although PHAs are relatively well characterized in terms of properties and market 

applications, their price is still higher than that of synthetic plastics (Chanprateep 2010). 

To lower polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production costs, genetic engineering technology, 

pathway modification or synthetic biology approaches should be engaged to develop PHA-

producing strains able to grow to high cell density within a short period of time on lower 

cost substrates under less demanding fermentation conditions (Chen 2009).  

Currently, industrial PHA production relies on pure microbial culture fermentation 

technology with high costs associated with carbon substrate, fermentation operation and 

downstream processing (Albuquerque et al 2011). In the last two decades, research has 

focused on the development of alternatives to substantially decrease PHA production costs 

(Serafim et al 2008a). The combined use of waste organic carbon and mixed microbial 

cultures (MMC) could significantly decrease the price of PHAs, allowing to save energy, 

since no sterilization is required, reducing production costs and minimizing the need for 



12 

control equipment (Johnson et al 2010). 

Taking into account the emergency in developing alternatives to conventional 

plastics and the increasing potential in using MMCs and real substrates to produce PHAs, 

this research as emerged. The main objectives of this research were: 

? Operation of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under aerobic dynamic feeding 

(ADF) conditions in order to select a stable PHA-accumulating culture; 

? Test the ability of the selected culture to accumulate PHA through several batch 

tests, using as substrate the VFA-rich effluent from the acidogenic fermentation 

reactor (AFR); 

? Analyse the evolution of microbial community composition through 

fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and identify the best PHA 

producers, as well as their relative abundances; 

? Elaboration of 16S rDNA clone library and determine the presence of 

microorganisms known to be PHA producers.

2. State of the Art 

2.1. Bioplastics 

Plastics are present in our daily life in the form of disposable utensils, packaging, 

furniture or appliances, thereby improving our quality of life and comfort. Over the past 

years, the use of plastics in packaging and other products exacerbated the problem of solid 

waste disposal. The slow rate of degradation of these plastics results is a serious pollution 

problem, since they persist in the environment for an average of 100 years. For these 

reasons, petrochemical-based plastics are accumulated in the environment at a rate of 25 

million tonnes/year (Lee et al 1991; Castilho et al 2009). 

Plastic disposal is often problematic. In landfills, the degradation is very slow and 

incineration is expensive and generates toxic gas emissions (Reddy et al 2003; Khanna and 

Srivastava 2004). Recycling is difficult because it requires a preliminary screening for 

separation of different types of plastics and the process itself results in changes in polymer 

properties (Castilho et al 2009). Moreover, the presence of a wide variety of additives such 

as pigments, coatings, fillers, limits the use of the recycled material (Khanna and 

Srivastava 2004). In response to this problem and to the harmful effects of plastic wastes 

on the environment, there is considerable interest in the development of bio-based and 

biodegradable alternatives. 

Biomaterials are natural products that are synthesized and/or catabolized by 

different organisms with a great interest from a biotechnological point of view (Luengo et 

al 2003). These biopolymers can be extracted directly from natural resources or chemically 

polymerized from organic monomers. Apart from being considered biodegradable, as 

various microorganisms can assimilate them, they are also biocompatible, since they do 

not show any toxicity to the human body (Luengo et al 2003). As such, they have several 

advantages over any other synthetic product (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). 

2.2. PHAs 

In 1888, Beijerinck was the first to observe PHAs granules in bacterial cells. A few 

years later, in 1926, Lemoigne described the composition of a PHAs as a homopolyester of 

3-hydroxybutyric acid, to which he gave the name of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB)) 

(Lemoigne, 1926). 

PHAs are aliphatic polyesters mostly constituted by monomers of 3-



14 

hydroxyalkanoates. They are produced under specific environmental and nutritional 

conditions and accumulated intracellularly as amorphous granules or inclusion bodies. The 

accumulated polymer allows for the survival of microorganisms in the absence of 

substrate, as they function as intracellular reserves of carbon and energy (Luengo et al 

2003; Verlinden et al 2007; Serafim et al 2008a). PHAs are synthesized by living 

organisms such as bacteria, fungi or plants and more than 250 species of microorganisms 

are known to have this capability (Lee 1995). Bacteria are used in the large scale 

production of PHAs (Verlinden et al 2007). All the industrial processes so far implemented 

use pure microbial cultures which may accumulate PHAs up to 90% of the cell dry weight 

(Lee and Choi 1998; Madison and Huisman 1999). 

The general chemical structure of the PHAs monomers is represented in Figure 1 

and some examples of PHAs polymers are shown in Table 1. In the homopolymer P(3HB), 

n is equal to 1 and R is a methyl group. This is the most common and best-characterized 

PHA (Dias et al 2006; Castilho et al 2009). Typically, PHAs have high molecular weights, 

between 50,000 to 1,000,000 Da (Reddy et al 2003). PHAs can be divided into three 

groups in function of the number of carbons: short-chain-length PHAs (scl-PHAs) with 3 

to 5 carbons, medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs), which vary between 6 to 14 

carbons and long-chain-length PHAs (lcl-PHAs), with more than 14 carbons (Singh and 

Mallick 2008).

There are many types of PHAs with different monomer compositions, which 

influence the physical and mechanical properties of PHAs (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). 

P(3HB) has a low oxygen permeability and better thermoplastic properties when compared 



 15 

to petroleum-based plastics, but has poor mechanical properties, since it is more rigid and 

brittle that polypropylene (PP) (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). It is well known that P(3HB) 

homopolymer and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (P(3HB-co-3HV)) 

copolymers of low hydroxyvalerate (HV) content are stiff and brittle, with poor impact 

strength, because of the relatively high crystallinity of the materials. This brittleness has 

been a reported obstacle to the practical applications of these materials, and significant 

research effort has been devoted to manipulating these mechanical properties. One of the 

most direct solutions for improving mechanical properties of PHAs is the incorporation of 

high contents of HV monomer, which results in a copolymer more elastic and flexible 

(Serafim et al 2004; Bengtsson et al 2008b).  

Compared to P(3HB), P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers with higher HV contents have 

decreased stiffness and brittleness, increased flexibility (higher elongation to break), and 

increased tensile strength and toughness (Laycock et al 2013). The presence and relative 

proportion of each monomer depend on the type of substrate supplied. Mixtures of 

substrates are generally used to obtain copolymers with different monomer compositions, 

aiming at the tailored synthesis of PHA with given target mechanical properties (Dias et al 

2006). 

PHAs can be degraded under anaerobic and aerobic conditions by various 

microorganisms in many ecosystems such as soil, sewage, sea water or lakes (Lee 1995; 

Castilho et al 2009). It has been found that the rate of biodegradability of PHAs in natural 

environments is influenced by factors such as type of microbial population, temperature, 

moisture level, pH, nutrient supply as well as composition, crystallinity, additives and 

surface area of PHA itself (Khanna and Srivastava 2004). 

 Another important property of PHAs is their biocompatibility. This means that 

PHAs are not toxic to the human body and its degradation does not result in any toxic 

compound (Castilho et al 2009). This feature allows for the use of PHAs in numerous 

medical applications, since they are assimilated harmlessly by the human body (Verlinden 

et al 2007). 

There are several types of PHAs, such as BiopolTM, BiomerTM, NodaxTM and 

BiocycleTM. These polymers are produced by natural pure cultures of Alcaligenes latus 

(BiomerTM) and Bacillus spp. (BiocyclesTM) or by genetically modified strains of 

Escherichia coli (BiopolTM) or Cupriavidus necator (NodaxTM) (Singh and Mallick 2008; 



16 

Chen 2009).  

The application of PHAs in commodities depends on three core mechanical 

properties: elongation at break, which is a measure of toughness or total deformation 

before fracture; Young’s modulus which is a measure of stiffness; and ultimate tensile 

strength, which is a measure of strength prior to the onset of permanent plastic deformation 

(Laycock et al 2013). Table 2 summarizes different properties of several types of PHAs.

2.3. Applications of PHAs 

Like the petrochemical-based synthetic plastics, most PHAs are thermoplastics and 

can be thermally processed using existing technologies in the plastic industry. The 

properties of PHAs can also be tailored to suit numerous applications ranging from stiff 

packaging goods to highly elastic materials for coatings (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). PHAs 

applications can be divided into three areas: industrial, agricultural and medical (Philip et 

al 2007). The use of PHAs in industry has been gaining territory (Sudesh and Iwata 2008). 

Initially, PHAs were used to make everyday articles such as shampoo bottles and 

packaging materials. In recent times, other applications were added, such as medical 

implants, drug delivery carriers, printing and photographic materials, fine chemicals and 

nutritional supplements (Chen 2009).  Due to their piezoelectric nature, it is also possible 



 17 

to use PHAs to make pressure sensors, stretch and acceleration measuring instruments, 

shock wave sensors and lighters. The gas barrier property of P(3HB-co-3HV) is useful for 

applications in food packaging and for making plastic beverage bottles (Philip et al 2007).  

In agriculture, PHAs are used in the production of devices for controlled release of 

fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides (Philip et al 2007). They can also be used as 

bacterial inoculants used to enhance nitrogen fixation in plants (Kadouri et al 2005), 

encapsulation of seeds, biodegradable films for crop protection or in the construction of 

greenhouses (Verlinden et al 2007).  

Due to their properties of biodegradability and biocompatibility, several medical 

applications were already developed. PHAs can be turned into drug controlled release 

matrices. PHAs monomers, especially hydroxybutyrate (HB), were found to have 

therapeutic effects on Alzheimer and Parkinson, osteoporosis and even memory 

improvement (Chen 2009). PHAs are used in tissue engineering, artificial organ 

construction, surgical sutures and surgical glue (Philip et al 2007; Wu et al 2009). 

The primary obstacle for the replacement of synthetic plastics by biopolymers is 

their significant cost difference; the P(3HB) cost ranges from 2.5–3.0 €/kg (Chanprateep 

2010) up to 12 €/kg (Castilho et al 2009), and the copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) cost can also 

range from 3.0–5.0 €/kg (Chanprateep 2010) to 12 €/kg (Castilho et al 2009), compared 

with a cost of less than 1 €/kg (Chanprateep 2010) for conventional petroleum-based 

polymers. 

2.4. PHAs production 

2.4.1. Producing microorganisms 

The selection of a microorganism for the industrial production of PHAs should rely 

on several factors including the cells’ ability to utilize inexpensive carbon sources, growth 

and polymer synthesis rates, and maximum polymer storage content. Recovery of PHAs 

should also be considered because it contributes significantly to the production costs 

(Khanna and Srivastava 2004). 

Over 150 different types of hydroxyalkanoate monomers have been identified, 

being synthesized by over 300 species (Reis et al 2011). The industrial production of PHAs 

is carried out by natural or recombinant pure cultures of microorganisms such as 

Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes latus, Bacillus spp., Cupriavidus necator, Aeromonas 



18 

hydrophila, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas oleovorans. The use of recombinant 

strains allows to achieve higher yields with lower costs (Lemos et al 2006). However, the 

use of pure cultures still has several disadvantages that can be overcome through the use of 

MMCs (Serafim et al 2008a). Several strains are commonly used for pilot and large-scale 

production of PHAs and the results obtained with these are resumed in Table 3.

2.4.2. Pure cultures and Mixed Microbial Cultures 

MMCs have emerged as an alternative to pure cultures since operating costs can be 

reduced by 50%. The use of MMCs combined with the reuse of industrial or agricultural 

by-products can reduce operating costs in 85% (Tsuge 2002). A variety of low cost carbon 

substrates (e.g., starch, tapioca hydrolysate, whey, and molasses) have been tested for PHA 

production by pure cultures, but PHA production costs remain very high, mainly due to 

investment and operating costs (Albuquerque et al 2007). The utilization of MMCs 

facilitates the use of complex substrates since microbial population can adapt continuously 



 19 

to changes in substrate. Moreover, there is no need for sterilization and sterile fermentation 

systems, which contributes to the reduction of the final PHA price (Serafim et al 2004). 

The process also reduces costs, since less sophisticated equipment is used and less control 

is needed (Lee 1995). MMCs do not have a defined composition and the selection process 

gradually enriches the culture in organisms of interest, by imposing certain operation 

conditions. The MMC selected for production of PHAs has a high PHA storage capacity 

due to the operating conditions, which limits its primary metabolism (Dias et al 2006).  

The MMCs from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) have the ability to 

produce PHAs as storage of carbon and energy under transient conditions of availability of 

substrate. The MMCs have the ability to rapidly store the substrate when it is available, 

converting it into PHA, which is consumed during famine phase (Serafim et al 2008a; 

Coats et al 2010). In addition, MMCs have the ability to adapt to substrates whose 

composition is unknown, allowing for the use of cheap substrates such as industrial wastes 

(Serafim et al 2008a).  

Johnson et al. (2009) was able to maintain SBRs for PHA producing cultures 

enrichment running continuously for over 4 years under various conditions without 

stability problems (Johnson et al 2009). Serafim et al. (2008b) also reported a stable 

reactor performance of a PHA producing SBR for over 2 years (Serafim et al 2008b). 

While the risk of contamination is a big problem for pure culture processes, the use of an 

open system for mixed culture PHA production actively supports the introduction of new 

organisms into the reactor that could potentially be more competitive PHA producers than 

the established community (Johnson et al 2009). 

In spite of the many efforts devoted in the last decades to improve this process, the 

volumetric productivities and contents are still lower and than those achieved for pure 

cultures. Although the specific productivities are higher in MMC processes, cell 

concentrations are below the values required to reach the volumetric productivities of the 

pure culture processes (Serafim et al 2008a). Johnson et al. (2009) were able to select a 

virtually pure culture highly enriched in PHA-accumulating organisms and demonstrating 

a very high PHA storage capacity (up to 89%) by appropriately manipulating the operating 

conditions imposed on an open SBR fed with acetate (Johnson et al 2009).  



20 

2.4.3. Metabolism for PHA synthesis by MMCs 

The metabolism for PHAs synthesis is well defined for pure cultures, but only a 

few metabolic studies involving MMCs were reported (Lemos et al 2006). As such, it is 

assumed that the PHA production metabolism in MMCs is similar to the one described for 

pure cultures (Dias et al. 2006).  

The feedstock used in PHAs production is normally enriched with volatile fatty 

acids (VFAs) and/or sugar-based compounds (Serafim et al 2008a). Acetate is the most 

widely used substrate in the ADF process and it is preferably stored as P(3HB) (Serafim et 

al 2004). Figure 3 shows three metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of PHAs.  

Firstly, the organic acids molecules are transported across the cell membrane and 

activated to the corresponding acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) or, for glucose, breakdown through 

glycolysis till acetyl-CoA (Serafim et al 2008a). There are three known possible pathways 

for the production of PHAs that vary according to the substrate used. For acetate, two 

molecules of acetyl-CoA condense to acetoacetyl-CoA by ?-ketothiolase. This product is 

reduced (by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase) to 3- hydroxybutyryl-CoA at the expense of 

conversion of reduced NADPH to NADP+. This monomer is the direct precursor for the 

synthesis of P(3HB) by PHB synthase (Serafim et al 2008a). 

On the other hand, when propionate is the substrate, three different precursors can 

be produced. If two molecules of propionyl-CoA condense, they will originate 3-hydroxy-

2-methylvaleryl-CoA, the precursor of poly-3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (P(3H2MV)). If 

acetyl-CoA is present or if is formed through the breakdown of propionyl-CoA, the 

addition of acetyl-CoA and propionyl may form poly-3-hydroxyvalerate (P(3HV)) or poly-

3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (P(3H2MB)) (Serafim et al 2008a). The propionate is 

catalysed principally for the production of P(3HV), although some 3HB production can 

occur due to formation of its precursor, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, by the condensation of two 

molecules of acetyl-CoA (Lemos et al 2006). Butyrate and valerate can be used for the 

direct production of P(3HB) or P(3HV) (Serafim et al 2008a).

(Sudesh et al 2000) 

2.5. Three-step process 

Dionisi et al. (2005c) developed a three-stage process for PHA production from 

organic wastes. During the first stage of acidogenic fermentation, a high-concentration 

biodegradable waste is transformed into a mixture of acetate and other carboxylic acids. In 

the second stage, a SBR is operated with periodic feeding in order to enrich the MMC in 

bacteria with a high storage response to be used in the third stage. The final stage is 

operated in batch, with an excess of external substrate in order to increase the MMC PHA 

content (Dionisi et al 2005c). Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of the three-step 

process.

feedstocks (Reis et al 2011) 

 

2.5.1. Acidogenic fermentation 

PHA production costs can be reduced if waste organic carbon sources are used as 

substrates. Many waste streams from agriculture and industry like cane and beet molasses, 

cheese whey, plant oils and hydrolysates of starch, cellulose and hemicellulose, are 

potentially useful substrates. When an open-culture system is used, not all substrates are 

equally suitable. For example, starch and cellulose hydrolysates could lead to the growth of 

glycogen-accumulating organisms. An alternative to overpass this problem is the anaerobic 

digestion of the organic substrates, where soluble organic compounds are fermented into 

organic acids, such as acetic, propionic, butyric, and lactic acid, and other fermentation 

products, such as alcohols and hydrogen. This mixture of VFAs is readily converted to 

PHA (Carta et al 2001; Reis et al 2003; Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004).  

VFAs derived from waste feedstocks have important applications in addiction to 

serve as substrate for PHA production. Microbial production of organic acids is a 

promising approach for obtaining building-blocks from renewable carbon sources and 

VFAs are extremely useful as starting materials for the chemical industry (Sauer et al 

2008). 

The acidogenic fermentation is an important step in anaerobic digestion of organic 

compounds to methane and carbon dioxide. In this process, microbial species ferment 



 23 

dissolved organic compounds into organic acids and other fermentation products, such as 

alcohols, under anaerobic conditions. Since the produced VFAs are also substrates for 

PHA production, acidogenic fermentation can serve as a suitable pre-treatment in the 

process of PHA production (Bengtsson et al 2008a). 

The composition of the produced PHA depends on the types of VFAs that are used 

as substrate. Acetate and butyrate have a tendency to form 3HB monomers whereas 

presence of propionate tends to increase the amount of HV in the polymer (Dias et al 2006; 

Castilho et al 2009). The composition of VFAs produced under acidogenic fermentation 

can be affected by conditions such as pH, retention time (RT) and temperature 

(Albuquerque et al 2010b). So, manipulating operating conditions of the anaerobic 

fermentation step can be used to control the biopolymer composition in the PHA 

production step (Albuquerque et al 2011). 

Almost all the studies describing PHA production by MMCs perform culture 

selection and PHA accumulation in two separate steps (Dionisi et al 2003; Serafim et al 

2004; Dias et al 2006). Only few works report the use of a three-step production process, 

in which an anaerobic fermentation step precedes the culture selection and polymer 

accumulation steps. Bengtsson et al. (2008b) developed a three-step process for the 

production of PHA from paper mill effluents, including the continuous fermentation of the 

paper mill effluent followed by culture selection and PHA production using the fermented 

effluent as substrate (Bengtsson et al 2008b). Albuquerque and co-workers (2007) 

developed a three-stage process to produce PHA from sugar cane molasses. The process 

includes molasses acidogenic fermentation, selection of a PHA-accumulating culture and 

PHA batch accumulation using the enriched sludge and fermented molasses (Albuquerque 

et al 2007). 

Different feedstocks were already investigated for acidogenic fermentation toward 

PHA production. These feedstocks include cheese whey, pulp and paper mill effluents 

(Bengtsson et al 2008a), sugarcane molasses (Albuquerque et al 2007) and olive oil mill 

effluents (OMEs) (Beccari et al 2009). Cheese whey, paper mill effluents, and sugarcane 

molasses were all found to be readily and almost fully fermentable, producing mainly 

VFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate) as fermentation products (Albuquerque 

et al 2007; Bengtsson et al 2008a). OMEs were fermented with a lower yield and the 

fermented stream contained both VFAs (acetic, propionic, and butyric acid) and alcohols 



24 

(methanol, ethanol, and butanol) accounting for 32% and 22% of the overall COD, 

respectively (Beccari et al 2009). 

2.5.2. Culture selection 

The selection of a microbial population with a high storage capacity is one of the 

main challenges in MMC processes (Serafim et al 2008a). If the selected population is very 

heterogeneous in terms of the storage capacity, that may have a negative impact in the 

downstream process, since it would result in the reduction of average PHA cell content and 

increase of PHA extraction costs. Thus, the operation of the selection reactor should be 

optimized to obtain a homogeneous population with a relatively high and stable storage 

capacity rather than to maximize the PHA cell content (Serafim et al 2008a). The most 

important processes for culture selection are the Anaerobic/Aerobic process (AN/AE), the 

MicroAerophilic-Aerobic System (MAAS) and ADF. 

Under AN/AE conditions, there are two main groups of bacteria responsible for 

PHA accumulation, which can be selected: polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) 

and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs). In anaerobic conditions, these 

microorganisms use the carbon source for the production of PHA with simultaneous 

consumption of glycogen. Under aerobic conditions, after the exhaustion of the external 

substrate, the stored PHA is consumed for growth, maintenance and replenishment of 

glycogen reserves (Serafim et al 2008a). According to Dai et al. (2007), in comparison 

with PAOs, GAOs are more robust, reach higher PHA contents and easily produce 

copolymers of P(3HB-co-3HV) from simple substrates (Dai et al 2007). Real substrates as 

fermented molasses (Pisco et al 2009), fermented wastewater (Coats et al 2007) and pre-

fermented paper mill effluent (Bengtsson et al 2008b), were already tested in this kind of 

process and the obtained PHA accumulations were of 37%, 10-25%  and 48% (w/w), 

respectively. 

Satoh et al. (1998) introduced the MAAS where a limited amount of oxygen is 

supplied during the anaerobic period of anaerobic–aerobic operations (Satoh et al 1998). In 

such conditions, microorganisms can take up organic substrates by obtaining energy 

through oxidative degradation of some part of the organic substrates. If the supply of 

oxygen is sufficient, the microorganism may be able to get enough energy for assimilative 

activities such as the production of protein, glycogen and other cellular components 

simultaneously with taking up organic substrates. However, if the supply of oxygen is 



 25 

adequately controlled, the assimilative activity will be suppressed while letting the 

microorganism accumulate PHA (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004).  

 Among the different processes described for industrial PHA production by MMCs, 

the feast and famine process or ADF is the most promising because of the high sludge 

PHA content and productivity (Reis et al 2003). In this process, MMCs are subjected to 

alternating periods of presence (feast) and absence (famine) of substrate, which leads to an 

uneven growth of the MMC. The operation of the system with alternating phases of excess 

carbon followed by substrate exhaustion imposes a selective pressure. During the famine 

phase, the absence of carbon causes the decrease of cellular components essential for 

growth, such as RNA and enzymes. After the starvation period, when an excess of carbon 

is supplied, the PHA storage is favoured, due to the low availability of material essential 

for growth (Majone et al 1996). In the absence of substrate, only organisms able to store 

PHA will survive, since the stored polymer will be used as a source of carbon and energy 

to ensure growth and cell maintenance during famine phase (Dionisi et al 2003; Serafim et 

al 2004; Dias et al 2006). The ability to store internal reserves gives these microorganisms 

a competitive advantage over those without this ability, when facing transient substrate 

supply (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004). 

In this process, the reactor is operated under intermittent substrate feed in order to 

favour the polymer storage capacity. The substrate is fed during a short period of time, 

followed by a longer period of substrate absence. This period of famine is needed to 

stimulate the PHA storage capacity of cells (Reis et al 2003). Figure 4 represents a possible 

metabolic pathway for acetate consumption under feast/famine conditions suggested by 

Reis and co-workers (2003).

The ratio between the length of the feast and famine phase (F/F ratio) is a crucial 

parameter affecting the performance of the selection stage (Albuquerque et al 2011). In 

general, low F/F ratio ensures the selection of microorganisms that are most able to store 

PHA and their physiological adaptation toward PHA synthesis in the feast phase (Villano 

et al 2014). 

2.5.2.1. Microbial community characterization 

During the process of selection of a PHA-accumulating culture, the microbial 

community should be evaluated periodically in order to monitor its evolution, identify the 

best producers and determine their relative abundance. The microbial characterization must 

be correlated with the operational conditions allowing for the enhancement of those that 

favour the selection of PHA-accumulating microorganisms (Serafim et al 2008a). 

Moreover, monitoring the culture evolution throughout the operational period allows to 

understand some changes in the performance of the MMC that could eventually occur 

(Queirós et al 2014).

 Finally and with regard to ADF, the most studied PHA storage process by MMCs, 

the mechanism of accumulation was first proposed in 1996 by Majone et al. (1996). In this 

process, also known as feast and famine, the MMC, under aerobic conditions, submitted to 

alternated periods of external substrate availability (feast) and unavailability (famine) 

results in unbalanced growth. As mentioned before, the absence of a carbon source during 

a period of time causes a decrease in the amount of intracellular components fundamental 

for the cell growth (RNA and enzymes). Following this period of famine, if the MMC is 

fed with an excess of carbon, as the amount of enzymes available is lower than that 

necessary for a maximum growth rate, the storage of PHAs became the dominant 

phenomena (Majone et al. 1996). As stated in the previous section, VFAs are the mainly 

carbon source used by MMC to synthesis PHAs. Under ADF conditions, Reis and co-

workers (2003) have proposed a possible metabolic pathway for acetate consumption, as 

illustrated by Figure 9. 

 

Figure 9: Possible metabolic pathway for acetate consumption under ADF conditions by MMC (Reis et al. 2003) 

 

As reviewed by Serafim and co-workers (2008), the selection of MMCs under ADF 

conditions can be performed using real complex wastes such as fermented cane molasses, 

fermented palm oil mill effluents, industrial wastewaters, fermented paper mill wastewater, 

tomato cannery waste or fermented brewery wastewater. 

To complement the selection of the PHA-storing populations, the evolution of 

microbial community must be evaluated in order to identify the best producers and 



 27 

Several studies focused on the microbial community structure of MMCs in PHA-

producing processes have revealed the presence of a wide phylogenetic diversity, although 

Thauera, Azoarcus and Paracoccus have often been associated as PHA producing 

organisms (Dionisi et al 2005a; Dionisi et al 2005c; Serafim et al 2006; Lemos et al 2008; 

Moita and Lemos 2012; Queirós et al 2014; Dai et al 2015).  

Dionisi et al. (2005a) used Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 

16S rRNA clone library to follow the evolution of a PHA-producing MMC. The main 

phylogenetic groups identified were: Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and 

Gammaproteobacteria (Dionisi et al 2005a).  

Dionisi et al. (2005c) used DGGE and elaborated a 16S rRNA clone library to 

identify PHA-accumulating organisms in an ADF reactor. The dominant group was 

Betaproteobacteria (Thauera, Alcaligenes, Comamonas, Achromobacter). 

Gammaproteobacteria (Kluyvera, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) and Alphaproteobacteria 

(Xantobacter, Curtobacterium) were also present. Thauera was the dominant genus and 

was described for the first time as a PHA-producer (Dionisi et al 2005c). 

Serafim et al. (2006) used FISH and Nile Blue staining to characterize the 

microbial populations in two reactors operated under ADF conditions, one consuming 

acetate and the other propionate. Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were found 

to be the main phylogenetic groups and Azoarcus was identified as the genus mostly 

responsible for PHA-accumulation (Serafim et al 2006). 

 Lemos et al. (2008) used the sorting/reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain 

reaction (RT-PCR) approach to reveal the main composition of the PHA-accumulating 

biomass present in two systems fed with different substrates: acetate and propionate. Using 

FISH, the presence of microorganisms identified by RT-PCR was confirmed. FISH 

analysis showed that bacteria belonging to the genera Amaricoccus, Thauera and Azoarcus 

were always present in both reactors. However, clear differences in the abundance of these 

genera were observed between the two reactors, which could be related with the kind of 

carbon source utilized (Lemos et al 2008).   

Moita and Lemos (2012) used FISH to identify PHA-accumulating organisms 

selected under ADF conditions. The majority of the identified organisms belonged to 

Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, or Gammaproteobacteria classes (Moita and 

Lemos 2012). 



28 

Queirós et al. (2014) selected a PHA-accumulating culture from a MMC and 

characterized the selected culture using FISH. The bacterial community was mostly 

constituted by Alphaproteobacteria, followed by Betaproteobacteria and 

Gammaproteobacteria. Within Alphaproteobacteria, small amounts of Paracoccus and 

Defluvicoccus related to Tetrad Forming Organisms (TFO) were detected (Queirós et al 

2014). 

Dai et al. (2015) investigated the potential of using wood hydrolysates as substrate 

to produce P(3HB) using a MMC. 16S rRNA sequencing with Illumina system was used to 

analyse the microbial community. Actinobacteria, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria were 

found to be the dominant groups in the bioreactors. Several PHB-storing microorganisms 

belonged to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria groups (Dai et al 2015). 

In the present work, the microbial community composition is going to be identified 

and monitored through FISH analysis. Throughout the SBR operational period, several 

samples were collected and fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% in order to be preserved until 

submitted to the molecular analyses. A 16S rDNA clone library was also prepared. 

2.5.2.2. Operational parameters 

The production of PHA by MMCs subjected to a feast and famine selection 

strategy is usually carried out in SBRs, operated in cycles of feeding, reaction, settling and 

drawn (Dias et al 2006). SBRs are ideal reactors for the selection of robust populations 

with high ability of PHA storage, because biomass grows under transient conditions. 

Furthermore, this reactor is easy to control and highly flexible, allowing the rapid change 

of the process conditions, for example the duration of feeding and cycle length (Reis et al 

2003). 

The MMC response is influenced by different factors such as reactor operating 

conditions (sludge retention time (SRT), hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH, temperature, 

cycle length, organic loading rate (OLR), influent substrate concentration and nutrient 

concentration) as well as the feedstock (Reis et al 2011). 

During the reactor operational time, several cycles were monitored in order to study 

the culture evolution. In these cycles, parameters such as temperature, pH and dissolved 

oxygen (DO) concentration were monitored. 

The pH was measured in order to check its influence in PHA accumulation. Ideally, 

it should be between 8 – 9, since its reduction to values between 6 – 7 causes the decrease 



 29 

of cellular PHA content (Dias et al 2006). Villano et al. (2010) also observed that the rates 

and yields of PHA storage decreased, as pH increased from 7.5 to 9.5 (Villano et al 2010). 

According to Third at al (2003), limiting oxygen concentrations allows to achieve 

higher yields of PHA storage, since the higher the concentration of DO, the greater will be 

the proportion of substrate which will be used for cell growth and, consequently, less 

substrate will be converted to PHA (Third et al 2002). 

The accumulation of storage polymers is strongly dependent on temperature and at 

higher temperatures (35ºC), less PHB production occurs. Nevertheless, this could be an 

advantage because the use of low temperatures allows for a less costly process (Krishna 

and Van Loosdrecht 1999). Johnson at al. (2010) concluded that at higher temperatures 

(30ºC) PHB storage was the dominant process in the feast phase. At lower temperatures 

(15ºC) the feast phase was longer and growth occurred predominantly directly on acetate 

rather than on stored P(3HB). This culture had a low PHB storage capacity (Johnson et al 

2010).  

One of the objectives of the selection stage is to produce a PHA-storing culture 

with the highest productivity possible, that is, the amount of biomass produced per unit of 

volume of reactor and per unit of time. To achieve high biomass volumetric productivities, 

the SBR needs to be operated at OLRs as high as possible, which corresponds to high 

influent substrate concentration and/or short HRT (Villano et al 2014). 

Beun et al. (2002) concluded that for SRTs higher than 2 days, the yield of P(3HB) 

from acetate under excess nutrients was constant and, thus, independent of the specific 

growth rate. At a SRT below 2 days, the P(3HB) storage yield and productivity decreased 

sharply with the decrease of the SRT (Beun et al 2002). 

Dionisi et el. (2007) studied the effect of the cycle length on the enrichment and 

selection of mixed cultures in SBRs. In the perspective of PHA production from organic 

wastes, at fixed OLR (20 gCOD L-1 day-1) the length of the cycle played a relevant role in 

determining the length of the feast and famine phases. With low or high lengths of cycle, 

storage rates and yields were very low and the dynamic response of the biomass to 

substrate excess was dominated by growth. The selection of microorganisms with storage 

or growth response is correlated with the ratio of the feast phase/length of the cycle: 

storage response was observed only when the feast phase was not longer than 20% of the 

length of the cycle (Dionisi et al 2007).  



30 

Regarding the F/F ratio, low F/F values ensure physiological adaptation of the 

microorganisms, favouring PHA storage in the feast phase. High F/F ratios that result from 

either higher OLR/influent substrate concentration or shorter cycles can cause a partial or 

complete loss of the physiological adaptation, which will cause the substrate uptake to be 

driven predominantly toward growth (Albuquerque et al 2011).  

Valentino et al. (2014) studied the effect of feed frequency on PHA production, 

while maintaining the same OLR, HRT and feed concentration (8.5 g COD L-1 of VFAs). 

The effect of feeding time was evaluated with a cycle length of 8 h and an increase in the 

storage response was observed by increasing the rate at which the substrate was fed into 

the reactor. By decreasing the cycle length from 8 h to 6 h and then to 2 h, changing the 

feed frequency or changing the organic load given per cycle, the length of the feast phase 

decreased from 26 to 20 and then to 19.7% of the overall cycle length, respectively, due to 

an increase in the substrate removal rate (Valentino et al 2014).  

2.6. PHAs production from low-value feedstocks 

As already mentioned, the substrate cost is one of the major contributors to the high 

price of PHAs, since the feedstock is estimated to account for 40% of the total production 

cost (Salehizadeh and Van Loosdrecht 2004). Therefore, to lower the production costs is 

essential to select cheaper substrates that can be used for synthesizing PHA with high 

yields (Lemos et al 2006). 

Preliminary results of several investigations showed the possibility of using agro-

industrial waste streams instead of synthetic substrates for PHA production (Dionisi et al 

2005b; Albuquerque et al 2007; Coats et al 2007; Bengtsson et al 2008b; Albuquerque et al 

2010b; Albuquerque et al 2011; Jiang et al 2012). Nevertheless, the PHA storage capacity 

obtained from those researches was still significantly lower than those of microbial 

enrichments selected on synthetic feedstocks. Most of these studies reported PHA content 

around 55% of the dry weight (Dionisi et al 2005b; Bengtsson et al 2008b; Albuquerque et 

al 2011). The microbial enrichment obtained by Jiang et al. (2012) could accumulate a 

maximum of 77% PHA of cell dry weight within 5 hours (Jiang et al 2012). 

The use of MMCs as PHA-producers was increasingly investigated as a mean of 

reducing production costs together with the use of several surplus-based feedstocks, 

including: fermented molasses (Albuquerque et al 2007; Albuquerque et al 2010b; 

Albuquerque et al 2011), fermented paper mill effluents (Bengtsson et al 2008b; Jiang et al 



 31 

2012), fermented OMEs (Dionisi et al 2005b; Beccari et al 2009), glycerol (Dobroth et al 

2011; Moralejo-Gárate et al 2011), bio-oil (Moita and Lemos 2012), municipal 

wastewaters (Coats et al 2007) and Hardwood Sulphite Spent Liquor?  (HSSL) (Queirós et 

al 2014). 

Dionisi et al. (2005) examined the production of PHA from OMEs using a three-

step strategy. In the fermentation step, OMEs were anaerobically fermented to obtain 

VFAs. The PHA production stage was investigated through batch tests performed by using 

a MMC enriched in a SBR fed with a mixture of organic acids. The PHA production 

specific rate obtained was 420 mg COD g COD-1 h-1 (Dionisi et al 2005b).  

Albuquerque et al. (2007) used a three-stage process to produce PHAs from sugar 

cane molasses. The three-step process used, comprised continuous acidogenic fermentation 

of molasses, selection of a PHA-accumulating culture under feast and famine conditions 

and batch PHA accumulation using the selected culture and the fermented molasses. Two 

different strategies were used: conducting culture selection with a synthetic substrate 

(acetate) and accumulation with fermented molasses or using the fermented molasses as 

feedstock in both steps. The effect of organic acids distribution on polymer composition 

and yield was evaluated with the acetate selected culture and the storage yields varied from 

0.37 to 0.50 Cmmol HA/Cmmol VFA. Low ammonia concentration (0.1 Nmmol/l) in the 

fermented molasses stimulated PHA storage and the storage yield obtained was 0.62 

Cmmol PHA/Cmmol VFA (Albuquerque et al 2007). 

Bengtsson et al. (2008b) investigated the production of PHA from a paper mill 

wastewater using a three-stage process consisting in acidogenic fermentation to convert 

wastewater organic matter to VFAs, an activated sludge system operated under 

feast/famine conditions for enrichment in PHA-producing organisms and PHA 

accumulation in batch experiments. The maximum PHA content achieved was 48% of the 

sludge dry weigh (Bengtsson et al 2008b). 

Coats et al. (2007) investigated PHA production with a MMC through an activated 

sludge process using carbon present in municipal wastewaters. Their goal was to 

demonstrate that commercial PHA production could be integrated into various 

configurations of municipal wastewater treatment schemes. A PHA accumulation of 53% 

PHA (w/w) was obtained. The obtained results suggested that the commercial production 

of PHA could feasibly be integrated into wastewater treatment systems (Coats et al 2007). 



32 

Beccari and co-workers (2009) investigated the performance of a three-stage 

process for PHA production from OMEs. In the first anaerobic stage, OMEs were 

fermented to VFAs in a packed bed biofilm reactor. This VFA-rich effluent was fed to the 

second stage, operated in an aerobic SBR, to select a MMC able to store PHA. Finally, the 

storage response of the selected consortia was exploited in the third aerobic stage, operated 

in batch conditions. The maximum value of PHA storage rate was 146 mgCOD gCOD-1 h-1 

(Beccari et al 2009). 

Albuquerque et al. (2010a) used a 2-stage continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) 

system to carry out culture enrichment in a 3-stage process using sugar molasses as 

feedstock in order to determine the impact of the reactor operation mode on PHA-

accumulating culture selection under feast and famine conditions. The effect of different 

operating parameters such as influent substrate concentration (60–120 Cmmol VFA/L) and 

ratio between the HRT of the two CSTRs (0.2–0.5 h/h) on the selection efficiency were 

assessed. The culture reached a maximum PHA content of 61% (Albuquerque et al 2010a). 

Moralejo-Gárate and co-workers (2011) studied the production of PHA by a MMC 

using glycerol as substrate. The PHA-producing MMC was enriched using feast/famine 

regime in a glycerol-fed SBR. In a subsequent fed-batch PHA production step, the 

enriched mixed community produced PHA up to a dry weight content of 80 wt% 

(Moralejo-Gárate et al 2011). 

Albuquerque et al. (2011) studied the possibility to control polymer composition 

and properties in mixed culture PHA production from fermented molasses. The effects of 

substrate VFA composition and feeding regime on polymer composition and structure 

were assessed. Continuous feeding strategy could be used to increase the HV content by 8–

9% relatively to that obtained from the same feedstock using pulse feeding. Therefore, the 

feeding strategy could be used to manipulate polymer composition and properties. P(3HB-

co-3HV) copolymers with HV fraction ranging from 15 to 39% were obtained, which 

subsequently resulted in different polymer properties. It was found that the use of a 

continuous feeding strategy rather than a pulse feeding strategy can allow higher rates of 

substrate uptake and polymer storage, originating a considerable increase of volumetric 

productivity. Different substrates were tested in order to study the effect of substrate VFA 

profile on polymer composition, yield and maximum PHA accumulation. Simulated 

fermented molasses with different VFA profiles and real fermented molasses were tested. 



 33 

In terms of PHA storage efficiency, maximum PHA contents of 56 and 66% were 

obtained, with fermented molasses feed and simulated feedstock, respectively. The lower 

maximum PHA content relates to the slightly lower rates of substrate uptake and PHA 

storage observed with the real feedstock. In all the cases, P(3HB-co-3HV) copolymers 

were produced and the polymer composition was not significantly affected by using real 

fermented molasses instead of the simulated fermented molasses. This indicates that the 

molasses matrix does not introduce significant variation on the polymer composition 

(Albuquerque et al 2011).  

Dobroth et al. (2011) investigated the potential of PHA production on crude 

glycerol using MMC and determined that the enriched MMC produced exclusively P(3HB) 

utilizing the methanol present in crude glycerol. The maximum PHA content achieved was 

67% of cell dry weight (Dobroth et al 2011). 

Jiang et al. (2012) used a three-step process to increase the maximum content that 

can be stored by a MMC using paper mill effluent as feedstock. In this work, the paper mill 

waste stream was firstly acidified to VFAs in a batch experiment. Then, the effluent from 

the acidogenic reactors was used as substrate for the selection SBR, and for the 

accumulation reactor operated in a fed-batch mode. The selected culture could accumulate 

maximum up to 77% PHA of cell dry weight within 5 hours (Jiang et al 2012). 

Moita and Lemos (2012) used bio-oil resulting from the fast-pyrolysis of chicken 

beds as substrate to select a MMC able to produce PHA under feast/famine conditions. In 

this study a maximum PHA content of 9.2% (g/g cell dry weight) was achieved in a SBR 

operated for culture selection (Moita and Lemos 2012). 

HSSL was firstly used as substrate for PHA production by MMCs by Queirós et al. 

(2014). The MMC selection process was performed in a SBR operated under ADF 

conditions and the selected PHA-accumulating culture reached a maximum PHA content 

of 67.6% (Queirós et al 2014). 

These results demonstrate the high potential of MMCs in the industrial PHA 

production and lead us to believe that technological advances will allow the achievement 

of better productivities and lower production costs. 

2.7. HSSL 

Several advances in genetics, biotechnology and engineering are leading to a new 

manufacturing concept for converting renewable biomass to valuable fuels and products, 



34 

generally referred to as a biorefinery. The American National Renewable Energy 

Laboratory (NREL) defined a biorefinery as “a facility that integrates biomass conversion 

processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. The 

biorefinery concept is analogous to today’s petroleum refineries, which produce multiple 

fuels and products from petroleum” (NREL 2009). Biorefineries can produce various 

intermediates and final products, fuel or energy from cheap substrates such as industries 

wastes from food, agricultural, forestry or paper sectors (Kamm et al 2007). The use of 

these wastes as substrates can simultaneously allow the reduction of disposal costs of these 

wastes and the production of high value products (Castilho et al 2009). The lignocellulosic 

biorefinery uses second-generation technologies to promote the valorisation of wastes from 

agriculture or forests and presents high potential due to the abundance and accessibility of 

the lignocellulosic biomass (Galbe and Zacchi 2007; Kamm et al 2007). 

Trees can be classified as hard- or softwood. Although the fibers in both types of 

trees are constituted by the same components (mainly cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), 

their proportions and structural characteristics are different (Pereira et al 2013) The 

substrate used in this work is the HSSL, a by-product of the paper industry. HSSL is a side 

product from acidic sulphite wood pulping which is usually burned to produce energy. The 

annual production of bleached sulphite eucalypt pulp is about 1 million tons per year 

contributing to the economic profits of South Africa, Portugal, and Spain (Marques et al 

2009). 

In the papermaking process, during grinding of wood, lignin is separated of the 

remaining fibrous material that is used to produce paper (Pereira et al 2013). This happens 

during the acid sulphite cooking, where lignin is removed from the remaining wood in the 

form of lignosulphonates (LS). Eucalyptus globulus’ HSSL main carbon compounds are 

LS and phenolic derivatives (60 – 80 g/L), sugars (35 – 45 g/L) from hydrolysed 

hemicelluloses, mainly xylose, and acetic acid (8 – 9 g/L) (Marques et al 2009). The 

chemical composition of HSSL is listed in Table 4. 

  



 35 

Table 4. Chemical composition of HSSL (Xavier et al 2009) 

 

HSSL presents monomeric sugars in high amounts, so it could be considered an ideal 

candidate for bioprocessing. However, it presents high levels of acetic acid, furfural and 

low molecular weight LS which inhibit microbial metabolism, affecting the bioprocessing 

of HSSL (Xavier et al 2009). However, this inhibition is not felt by MMCs.

3. Materials and Methods 

3.1. Cultures 

3.1.1. SBR 

The MMC was collected from an aerobic tank of the WWTP of Aveiro South 

(SIMRia 2014). 

3.1.2. Acidogenic fermentation 

The MMC used to inoculate the AFR was collected from the anaerobic digester of 

the WWTP Aveiro South (SIMRIA 2014). A pre-treatment was performed by heating the 

inoculum to 82ºC for 20 minutes in order to promote the enrichment of the MMC in 

acidogenic population over the methanogenic bacteria. 

3.2.  Bioreactors  

3.2.1. AFR 

The acidification of HSSL under anaerobic conditions was performed in a CSTR 

with a working volume 1.55 L and a flow rate of the feeding solution of 0.97 L/d (imposed 

by an IsmatecTM Compact Digital Multichannel Pump) resulting in a HRT of 1.6 days. 

The reactor had no system for retaining the biomass; therefore the SRT was the same as 

the HRT. The effluent was collected at the outlet of the reactor by overflow. Reactor 

stirring was performed by a magnetic stirrer and kept constant at 100 rpm. Nitrogen was 

bubbled occasionally to assure anaerobic conditions. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) 

was monitored with a transmitter M300 2-channel, ORP meter (Mettler-Toledo Thornton, 

Inc). The system worked with temperature control at 30.0 ± 1.0ºC using an external 

serpentine with meter. 

3.2.2. SBR 

In this work, a SBR was operated for 70 days in order to select a stable culture 

capable of storing PHA. The working volume was 1.5 L and the reactor was operated in 

cycles of ADF. Initially, the cycle duration was 24 hours comprising 22.5 hours of 

aerobiosis, 1 hour of settling (with agitation and aeration switched off) and 0.5 hours 

withdrawing of half of the volume of the supernatant (using a Watson-Marlow 101/R 



38 

pump), which was replaced by 750 mL of fresh medium during the first 15 minutes of each 

cycle (with a Watson-Marlow SCI 400 pump). These conditions resulted in a HRT of 2 

days. At the end of each cycle, before settling, 150 mL of mixed liquor were removed in 

order to establish a SRT of 10 days. Thereafter, the cycle’s duration was changed to 12 

hours, with 10.5 hours of aerobiosis, 1 hour of settling, 0.5 hours of withdrawing and 15 

minutes of replacement with fresh medium. With this, the HRT and SRT were kept at 1 

and 5 days, respectively. Several timers were used to control the reactor stirring (300 rpm), 

aeration, feeding and withdrawing. The system was operated without control of pH, 

temperature and oxygen. Air was supplied through a Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min. pH values 

were monitored using a pH meter pH Crison 28-P and the oxygen and temperature values 

were monitored with Oxygen meter M300 Transmitter meter (Thornton Mettler-Toledo, 

Inc).

3.3. Culture media 

3.3.1. Acidogenic fermentation medium 

3.3.1.1. HSSL pre-treatment 

HSSL from magnesium based acidic sulphite pulping of Eucalyptus globulus was 

supplied by Caima – Indústria de Celulose S.A. (Constância, Portugal). The HSSL 



 39 

collected from the factory was subjected to a chemical pre-treatment in order to remove 

some toxic compounds, such as phenolics, furfural and some LS. The pre-treatment of 

HSSL consisted in pH adjustment to 7.0 with KOH, followed by aeration with compressed 

air (6 h/L) to oxidize and precipitate some phenolic compounds. Then, the HSSL was 

centrifuged for 1 hour at 5000 rpm and the precipitated colloids were filtered off using a 1 

?m pore size glass microfiber filter. The pre-treated HSSL was stored at 4ºC.  

3.3.1.2. Acidogenic fermentation medium 

The medium used on the acidogenic CSTR was composed of (per litre of distilled 

water): 80 mg CaSO4·2H2O, 160 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 80 mg K2HPO4, 160 mg KH2PO4, 160 

mg MgSO4·7H2O, 80 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O and 160 mg NH4Cl. Phosphate salts were 

prepared apart, in order to avoid the irreversible precipitation with magnesium salts during 

sterilization. The pH of the feeding, before sterilization, was kept above 6.50. The flasks 

with medium and phosphates were sterilized in autoclave and phosphates were further 

added to the alimentation flask in a laminar flow hood. The COD of the feeding was 16 

gCOD/L, which corresponded to an OLR of 10.3 gCOD/L.d.  

3.3.2. Culture selection and PHA accumulation medium 

The medium for culture selection and PHA accumulation steps was prepared using 

the treated effluent of the acidification reactor supplemented with nutrients. The pre-

treatment of acidogenic fermentation reactor effluent consisted in effluent centrifugation 

for 1 h at 5000 rpm followed by filtration of precipitated colloids using a 1 ?m glass 

microfiber filter (Ahlstrom, grade 131). Finally, the effluent was sterilized in autoclave.  

The medium was composed of (per litre of distilled water): 0.080 g CaSO4·2H2O, 

0.020 g FeCl3, 0.064 g K2HPO4, 0.016 g KH2PO4, 0.160 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 g CH4N2S, 

0.008 g Na2MoO4·2H2O and 0.160 g NH4Cl. Phosphate salts were prepared apart, in order 

to avoid the irreversible precipitation with magnesium salts during sterilization. To inhibit 

nitrification, 0.4 g/L of thiourea were added. The flasks with the medium and phosphates 

were sterilized in autoclave. The pH of the feeding, before sterilization, was kept above 

6.50 and the phosphates were further added to the alimentation flask in a laminar flow 

hood. The COD in the feeding was 2 gCOD/L, which corresponded to an OLR of 1 and 2 

gCOD/L.d, in the 24h cycle and 12h cycles, respectively. The average total VFAs content 



40 

of the feeding was 1.0 gVFAs/L. 

3.4.  Sampling 

During the motorization of SBR cycles, samples were collected before the feeding 

period (t = 0), after the feeding stopped (t = 0.25 h) and with 30 minutes periods during the 

first 2 hours of the cycle. After this, samples were collected every hour during the first 8 

hours of the cycle. Samples for determination of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile 

suspended solids (VSS) were collected after the feeding and at the 4th and 8th hour of the 

cycle motorization period. When each sample was collected, pH, temperature and DO 

percentage of the reactor were registered. After sample collection, pH was measured again 

(Consort C833). Each sample was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm during 10 minutes 

(Centrifuge MiniSpin, Eppendorf), and the supernatant was separated from the pellet. The 

pellet and supernatant were stored in the freezer at -16ºC. The supernatant was used to 

determine the consumption of acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) and sugars 

(xylose and glucose), chemical oxygen demand (COD), lignosulphonates and ammonia. 

The lyophilized pellet was used to determine the PHA concentration by Gas 

Chromatography (GC). 

3.5. Accumulation tests 

Accumulation tests were performed with several pulses of feeding with the same 

composition used in the SBR but with some differences. The first test was performed with 

all the nutrients, the second one without phosphorus and the third one without ammonium.  

The kinetic tests with all the nutrients and without ammonia were performed in a 

bioreactor (BIOSTAT®) operated in fed-batch mode, Figure 6. A respirometer was coupled 

to the bioreactor by silicon tubing and the recirculation of the medium was performed by a 

pump (Watson-Marlow SCI 400 pump). The stirring in the reactor was kept constant at 

250 rpm, and the supply of air was performed by an air pump (Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min). 

The bioreactor was operated without temperature control and sterile conditions. 1 L of 

inoculum withdrawn from the SBR was used. Five pulses of feeding (each with 500 mL) 

were supplied, so the final working volume was of 3.5 L. Samples were collected every 15 

minutes and the DO percentage was recorded at each 5 seconds for 3 minutes.

The kinetic test performed without phosphorus was carried out in a bioreactor with 

a working volume of 0.5 L without temperature control and sterile conditions, Figure 7. 

The respirometer was coupled to the bioreactor by silicon tubing and the recirculation of 

the medium was performed by a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3). The stirring in the 

reactor and respirometer were kept constant, 300 rpm, and the supply of air was performed 

by an air pump (Boyu Air Pump, 8 L/min). 250 mL of inoculum withdrawn from the SBR 

were used. Three pulses with 250 mL of feeding without phosphorus were used. Samples 

were collected every 15 minutes and the DO percentage was recorded at each 5 seconds for 

3 minutes.

3.6. Analytical Methods 

3.6.1. Carbon sources analysis 

The consumption of VFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric) and sugars (glucose and 

xylose) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 

First, samples were filtered using a membrane of 0.22 µm (Corning Costar Spin-X) 

at 8000 rpm (Centrifuge MiniSpin, Eppendorf) for 15 minutes. pH of samples was 

corrected to values in the range of 1 – 3, by adding H2SO4 0.25 M. HPLC analyses were 

carried out using an ion exchange column (Aminex HPX-87H) with dimensions of 

300×7.5 mm, connected to a pump (HITACHI L-2130 pump), a refractive index detector 

(Hitachi RI Detector L-2490) and an auto-sampler (Auto-sampler HITACHI L-2200). The 

column temperature was 40ºC (external oven ParaLab). The eluent was H2SO4 0.01 N at a 

flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and it was prepared with milli-Q water and filtered with a 

cellulose acetate membrane, 0.2 ?m pore size (Whatman).  

The injected volume was 20 ?L. A calibration using standard curves for glucose, 

xylose, acetic, propionic and butyric acids was applied, in a concentration range of 0 to 2.0 

g/L for glucose, acetic and propionic acids, 0.25 to 5.0 g/L for butyric acid and 0 to 10.0 

g/L for xylose.

3.6.2. TSS and VSS determination 

Cell dry weight was determined as VSS according to Standard Methods (APHA, 

1995). 5 mL of sample was filtered by vacuum filtration using filters (Cellulose Acetate 

Filter with pores 1 ?m, Sartorius) previously weighed. Subsequently, the membranes were 

placed in an oven at 105°C for 24 hours. After cooling, the membranes were weighed and 

the biomass was determined in g/L of TSS. Afterwards, the membranes were placed in an 

oven at 550°C for 2 hours. After cooling the membranes, they were weighed and the 

concentration of biomass was determined in g/L of VSS. 

3.6.3. Ammonia quantification 

Ammonia concentrations were determined using a Thermo Scientific Ion Selective 

Electrode. In order to adjust the ionic strength, to 1 mL of each sample, 100 ?L of 1M 

MgSO4 solution were added. A calibration curve was prepared using ammonia standards 

with a range of concentrations between 1.00 × 10?1  and 6.25 × 10?4  M. The 

concentration values of each sample were measured in mV, registered after 5 minutes of 

measurement.  

3.6.4. LS quantification  

LS quantification was performed according to Restolho et al. (2009), by measuring 

the absorbance of the conveniently diluted samples at 273 nm, using a UV 

spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UVmini-1240) (Restolho et al 2009). The LS concentration 

was determined using the Beer-Lambert law, with ? = 7.41 g-1cm-1 (Xavier et al 2009). 

3.6.5. COD 

COD was measured with the spectrophotometer from the Merck kit according with 

the Standard Methods APHA 5220 D (APHA, 1995) using a digestion solution with 

K2Cr2O7, HgSO4, H2SO4 and H2O and an acidic solution with H2SO4 and AgSO4. Each 

tube was prepared by adding 1.2 mL of digestion solution and 2.8 mL of acidic solution. 

Then, 2.0 mL of diluted sample were added. A blank was prepared by adding to the test 

tube 2.0 mL of distilled water instead of sample. Then, the tubes were shaken and placed in 

a block digester Spectroquant TR620 (Merck Millipore) pre-heated to 150ºC for 2 h. After 

cooling down to room temperature, the optical path of the test tubes was carefully cleaned 

and the absorbance at 600 nm of each sample and blank was measured in a colorimeter 



44 

Spectroquant Picco COD/CSB (Merck Millipore). A calibration curve was prepared with 

standards of glucose and potassium hydrogen phthalate. 

3.6.6. PHA 

PHA concentrations were determined by GC using the method adapted from Lemos 

et al. (2006). Lyophilized biomass was incubated for 3.5 h at 100ºC with 1:1 solutions of 

chloroform with heptadecane as internal standard, and a 20% acidic methanol solution. 

After the digestion step, the organic phase of each sample was extracted and injected into a 

gas chromatograph coupled to a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, Konik Instruments 

HRGC-3000C). A ZBWax-Plus column was used with hydrogen as the carrier gas (50 

kPa). Split injection at 280ºC with a split ratio of 1:6 was used. The oven temperature 

program was as follows: 60ºC; then 20ºC/min until 100ºC; then 3ºC/min until 175ºC; and 

finally 20ºC/min until 220ºC. The detector temperature was set at 250ºC. HB and HV 

concentrations were calculated using standards of a commercial P(3HB-co-3HV) 

(88%/12%, Aldrich) and corrected using a heptadecane internal standard.?  

3.7. Microbial community analysis 

3.7.1.  Biomass fixation 

Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 8000 rpm and the pellet was 

resuspended in 1×PBS. This step was repeated 3 times. Paraformaldehyde was added to the 

resuspended biomass, in a proportion of 3 parts of paraformaldehyde to 1 part of biomass. 

The mixture was incubated for 3 to 12 hours at 4ºC. The fixed sample was centrifuged (5 

min, 8000 rpm, 4ºC) and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 

1×PBS and this step was repeated 3 times to remove residues of paraformaldehyde. The 

biomass was resuspended in 1 volume of ice-cold 1×PBS and 1 volume of ice-cold 96% 

(v/v) ethanol. Samples were stored at – 20ºC (Amann et al 1995).

The coloration of ?- and ?-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides and proteins was 

prepared separately using different stains specific of each one of these compounds. 

3.7.5.1.  ?-D-glucopyranose Polysaccharides Staining 

Sample smears were applied on microscope slides. The sample was stained with 

Concanavalin A 10 ?g/mL solution for 30 to 40 minutes at room temperature. Then the 

slide was washed with cold Mili-Q water. After air dry, the slides were mounted with 

VectaShield mounting medium. The slides were then observed under oil immersion at 

1000× magnification resorting to an epifluorescence microscope, Olympus BX51, 

equipped with an Olympus XM10 camera (Cell-F software), Figure 9. Microscope 

observation was performed using the CY3 filter (Neu et al 2001).

Sample smears were applied on microscope slides. The sample was stained with 

Calcofluor white (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) 300 mg/L solution for 4 hours at room 

temperature. Then the slide was washed with cold Mili-Q water. After air dry, the slides 

were mounted with VectaShield mounting medium. The slides were then observed under 

oil immersion at 1000× magnification resorting to an epifluorescence microscope, 

Olympus BX51, equipped with an Olympus XM10 camera (Cell-F software), Figure 9. 

Microscope observation was performed using the DAPI filter (de Beer et al 1996).

3.7.6. FISH 

3.7.6.1. Pre-treatments 

3.7.6.1.1. Pre-treatment with glass beads 

In order to decrease the cellular aggregation of the fixed biomass, small aliquots 

were transferred to new eppendorfs with glass beads, with a diameter of 1 mm. Eppendorfs 

were taken to vortex for 60 seconds (Ghosh 2006). 

3.7.6.1.2. Pre-treatment with ultrasounds 

The fixed biomass was treated with ultrasounds in order to disaggregate the 

biomass flocs. A small aliquot of sample was transferred to a new eppendorf and then 

immerged in an ultrasound bath Branson 2510 at 40 kHz for 10 seconds. 

3.7.6.2. FISH analysis 

5 ?L of biomass fixed on paraformaldehyde (4 % v/v) were placed in individual 

wells of a teflon coated slide and then left to air dry. Next, the slide was dehydrated in 

ethanol series of 50%, 80% and 98% for 3 min each. Meanwhile, the hybridization and 

washing buffers were prepared according to stringency of the probe(s) used. 10 ?L of 

hybridization buffer and 0.5 ?L of each probe (50 ng/?L) were added to each well. Next, 

the slide was placed inside the hybridization chamber and the remaining hybridization 

buffer was used to moisten a tissue paper placed inside this chamber. The hybridization 



48 

chamber was incubated at 46ºC for 1.5 hour. The washing buffer was placed in a bath at 

48ºC and after the incubation time, the slide was washed with washing buffer, and then 

placed in a Falcon tube with the remaining washing buffer, for 15 minutes at 48ºC. Then, 

the slide was washed with cold Milli-Q water and was left to air-dry. After dry, the slides 

were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI stain (Amann et al 

1995). The slides were then observed under oil immersion at 1000× magnification 

resorting to an epifluorescence microscope, Olympus BX51, equipped with an Olympus 

XM10 camera (Cell-F software), Figure 9. The list of FISH probes applied is in Table 5.

3.7.7. Extraction, Purification and Amplification of genomic DNA 

DNA was extracted from a SBR sample collected during the apparent stationary 

phase of operation (on 66th day). DNA extraction was performed using PowerSoil® DNA 

Isolation kit following the protocol described by the manufacturer. 

The primers used to amplify 16S rDNA were 27 forward (f) and 1492 reverse (r), 

Table 6. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed in the BioRad T100TM Thermal 

Cycler. For the 27f and 1492r primers, a reaction volume of 25 ?L was used and the PCR 

reaction was composed by: 12.5 ?L of Lucigen Taq98TM Hot Start 2X master mix, 1.25 ?L 

of each primer, 1 ?L of DNA and 9 ?L of nuclease-free water. The following PCR cycles 

were used: 98ºC for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 98ºC for 0.5 minutes, 58ºC for 0.5 

minutes and 72ºC for 1 minute and, finally, an extension at 72ºC for 10 minutes. After the 

last cycle, samples were cooled down to 4ºC and an agarose (1%) electrophoresis was 

performed to check if there was amplification. Afterwards, the PCR products were purified 

using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit of (Quiagen, Milan, Italy) and quantified using 

the NanoDrop2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Milan, Italy).  

3.7.8. 16S rDNA Clone Library 

After purification and quantification, the amplified 16S rDNA was ligated into 

pGEM®-T vector (Promega, USA) and transformed into JM109 Competent Cells 

(Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transformed cells were 

plated in LB/ampicillin/IPTG/X-Gal plates and incubated overnight at 37ºC. Clones were 

screened for insertion of the correct size by PCR amplification using primers T7f and 

M13r. A denaturation step was performed before PCR amplification. This step consisted in 

a cycle of 96ºC for 10 minutes. For the T7f and M13r primers, a reaction volume of 100 

?L was used and the PCR reaction was composed by: 50 ?L of Lucigen Taq98TM Hot Start 

2X master mix, 5 ?L of each primer, 40 ?L of nuclease-free water and DNA from colony. 

PCR amplification was performed as already described, using the following cycles: 98ºC 

for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 98ºC for 0.5 minutes, 57ºC for 1 minute and 72ºC 

for 2 minutes and an extension of step of 72ºC for 20 minutes. 

DNA sequencing was performed by BioFab (Rome, Italy) using the primers 530f, 

926f and 907r, Table 6. In a first approach, all clones were partially sequenced, using 530f 

primer. After this, taking into consideration the obtained results, some clones were 



50 

completely sequenced, using 926f and 907r primers. After receiving the results, the 

sequences were manually assembled and the organisms’ identities were deduced through 

basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The complete sequences obtained were 

deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KT262954, KT262955, KT262951, 

KT262956, KT262952, KT262957, KT262958, KT262959, KT262960, KT262961, 

KT262962, KT262953, KT262963, KT262964, KT2629).

4. Calculation of Kinetic and Stoichiometric Parameters 

The sludge PHA content was calculated as a percentage of TSS on a mass basis:  

%PHA =  
PHA

TSS
× 100 (gPHA gTSS)?  

where TSS includes active biomass (X) and PHA. Active biomass was calculated by 

subtracting PHA from VSS. The maximum specific substrate uptake (-qS in 

CmmolS/CmmolX.h) was determined by adjusting a linear function to the experimental 

data of substrate concentrations plotted over time, calculating the first derivative at time 

zero (taking the slope of the fitting) and dividing the value obtained by the active biomass 

concentration at that point. The volumetric substrate uptakes (-rS in CmmolS/L.h) were 

determined by adjusting a linear function to the experimental data of substrate (VFAs) 

plotted over time, calculating the first derivative at time zero (taking the slope of the 

fitting). The amount of stored PHA (?%PHA) was calculated as the difference between the 

PHA percentage at the end of the feast phase (i.e. the substrate depletion time) and at the 

beginning of the respective cycle. The yields of PHA (YPHA/S in CmmolPHA/CmmolS) and 

active biomass (YX/S in CmmolX/CmmolS) on substrate consumed were calculated by 

dividing the amount of PHA formed or the active biomass formed by the total amount of 

substrate consumed, respectively. The respiration yield on substrate (YO2/S in gO2/gS) was 

calculated by dividing the decreased amount of O2 consumed by respiration (in g/L) per 

amount of substrate consumed (in gS/L). Since no nitrification occurred, because thiurea 

was added to the feeding medium, and based on the premise that the molecular formula for 

biomass is C5H7NO2, it was possible to establish that for the production 8 mg of active 

biomass there is a need of 1 mg of N (Serafim et al 2004). This relation allowed for the 

calculation of the specific growth rate of the active biomass. The specific growth rate was 

calculated resorting to the following formula:

5. Results and Discussion 

5.1. SBR performance 

The SBR was operated along 70 days with the objective of selecting a stable PHA-

producing MMC. During the operational time of the SBR several parameters were 

monitored such as: consumption of VFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric acids), sugars 

(xylose and glucose), COD, LS and ammonium and production of PHAs and biomass. The 

SBR was firstly operated with 24 h cycles and on day 44 the cycle duration was changed to 

12 h, in order to increase the number of cycles per SRT. 

In this work, the process of culture selection was performed using a medium 

enriched with VFAs as substrate, since VFAs are direct substrates for PHA storage. The 

evolution of the uptake rates of acetic, propionic and butyric acids is shown in Figure 10. 

The average acetic acid uptake rate (2.99 ± 2.02 Cmmol/L.h) was higher that the average 

uptake rates of propionic acid (1.23 ± 1.13 Cmmol/L.h) and butyric acid (2.19 ± 1.65 

Cmmol/L.h), which demonstrates a preference of the culture for acetic acid. The propionic 

acid consumption was relatively constant throughout the SBR operational time and the 

butyric acid uptake rate stabilized from day 37. Ammonium was consumed at 0.111 ± 

0.100 g/L.h. Between the 32nd and 52nd day, the ammonium uptake rates suffered an 

increase, and the highest value was recorded on the 52nd day (0.339 g/L.h).

Figure 11 shows the evolution of ?%PHA, active biomass and PHA concentrations 

along the SBR operational time. The average variation of ?%PHA was 16.2 ± 13.9%, with 

the lowest value being registered at the 34th day (0.34%) and the highest value at the 10th 

day (48.8%). The values of ?%PHA and PHA concentration were unstable throughout the 

first 37th days of SBR operation and several peaks of production were detected. Between 

the 46th and 66th day, although ?%PHA was lower than before, PHA production became 

more stable and it varied in the range 9.1 ± 2.4%. This leads to believe that the culture 

PHA storage was not affected by change of cycle duration. 

 

 

Figure 11. ?%PHA, Active Biomass and PHA concentrations throughout the SBR operational time 

 

Figure 12 shows the evolution of the produced monomers during the SBR 

operation. If mixtures of VFAs such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate are used 

as a substrate for PHA production, acetyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA are formed as 

precursors for PHA production, resulting in a copolymer containing HB and HV 

monomers (Dias et al 2006; Albuquerque et al 2007). In this case, the produced PHA was a 

copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) with an average monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of 

69:31 ± 7:7 (HB:HV). After the change of cycle duration on day 44, the co-polymer 

composition became more stable, having a average monomeric composition (on a molar 

basis) of 77:23 ± 1:1 (HB:HV).

Figure 12. Evolution of the content of HB and HV during the SBR operational time 

 

The F/F ratio is an important parameter in the culture selection. In general, low F/F 

values ensure physiological adaptation of the microorganisms, favouring PHA storage 

during the feast phase (Albuquerque et al 2011; Reis et al 2011). As shown in Figure 13, 

around day 34, the F/F ratio stabilized at 0.091, which is an indication of culture 

stabilization. On day 44, the cycle duration was changed and after some instability, the F/F 

ratio stabilized again on the 55th day, this time at 0.2. This corresponded with the 

stabilization of VFAs uptake rates and with the stabilization of PHA production. 

According to Dionisi et al. (2007), the best storage response is observed when the feast 

phase is not longer than 20% of the length of the cycle, so the obtained F/F ratio is 

considered acceptable. Albuquerque et al. (2010b) also found a predominant storage 

response with a F/F ratio of 0.21, using fermented molasses as substrate.

5.1.1. SBR cycles 

Along the 70 days of SBR operation, several cycles were monitored in order to 

follow the evolution of the culture selection process. During cycles several parameters 

were followed, such as the pH, temperature, uptake of acetate, propionate, butyrate and 

ammonium, oxygen consumption and PHA production.

because of that the pH suffered changes throughout the cycle. It is possible to see that the 

pH decreased to 7.54 after the feeding (t=0.25 h) and after the first 2 hours, it increased 

until reaching 8.58. pH increased during the feast phase and then stabilized. Chua and co-

workers (2003) studied the effect of pH on PHA content using acetate as substrate. They 

found that, when controlling the pH at 6 or 7, the PHA content was lower than at pH 8 or 9 

(Chua et al 2003). Serafim et al. (2004) also found that the polymer yield per substrate and 

the intracellular P(3HB) content were higher at pH 8 than at pH 7, and increased sharply 

when the pH was not controlled (it varied from 8 to 9.5). Oehmen and co-workers (2014) 

also studied the effect of pH control in the volumetric productivity of PHA production by 

an MMC (Oehmen et al 2014). The operation of a SBR with pH control at 8 resulted in 

higher volumetric productivity of PHA as compared to SBR operation without pH control 

(pH 8–9). The culture selected at pH 8 demonstrated a higher total volumetric productivity 

of PHA, since it was able to achieve a similar specific PHA production capacity while 

exhibiting a faster biomass growth rate. Change in pH was found to directly affect the 

microbial community composition and culture metabolism and Azoarcus was more

selectively enriched at pH 8. While controlling pH may present an attractive strategy to 

increase volumetric PHA productivity, it should be noted that this also implies an 

additional cost associated with the use of chemicals for pH control in large-scale 

applications. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the operation simplicity, reactor 

operation without pH control reduces both process control complexity and operating costs.  

The concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, ammonium and LS increased 

after the feeding, as expected. It is possible to see that the depletion of acetic, propionic 

and butyric acids occurred after 2 hours. Acetic acid was consumed preferentially with an 

uptake rate of 6.44 Cmmol/L.h, followed by butyric and propionic acids, with uptake rates 

of 3.94 and 3.11 Cmmol/L.h, respectively. VFAs were used by bacteria for the formation 

of new biomass (indicated by ammonia and biomass measurements), but mostly for storage 

of substrate in form of PHA. During the first 2 hours of the cycle, COD and LS were 

consumed at 0.584 and 0.023 g/L.h, respectively. During the feast phase, ammonium was 

consumed at rate of 0.179 g/L.h. 

In general, the moment of carbon source exhaustion (end of feast phase and 

beginning the famine phase) is accompanied by a sudden increase of DO concentration and 

by oxygen uptake rate (OUR) decrease (Serafim et al 2004). In this case an increase in DO 

values was verified at the 2nd hour, which coincided with the depletion of acetic, propionic 

and butyric acids. For this reason, when the acids are exhausted, cells began to consume 

other available carbon sources that are more difficult to assimilate. If there are no other 

available substrates, when the famine phase begins, only cells that have accumulated PHA 

in the feast phase will survive, selecting the best PHA-accumulating microorganisms. 

After depletion of VFAs, the concentration of CQO and LS continued to decrease, 

which indicates that other forms of carbon continued to be consumed by the culture. 

However, the feast and famine phases are only applicable to organisms that consume 

VFAs, and are not true feast and famine phases for organisms that consume other carbon 

sources present, like xylose, glucose and LS. In this cycle, it is possible to define that the 

feast phase occurred between the 0.25 and 2 hours and that the famine phase occurred 

between the 3rd and 24th hours. Therefore, this cycle had a F/F ratio of 0.09.  

Since VFAs are the preferential substrates for PHA accumulation, it makes sense 

that the maximum PHA value (17.5 Cmmol/L) was registered at the end of the feast phase, 

when the depletion of VFAs occurred. For this cycle, the ?%PHA was 6.3%. After 1.5 



 59 

hours, the concentration of PHA began to decrease since during the famine phase the 

culture consumed stored PHA as carbon source to ensure cell growth and maintenance. 

Although ammonium was consumed at a lower rate during the famine phase (0.041 g/L.h), 

the presence of ammonium throughout the full feast and famine cycle allowed PHA-

accumulating organisms to use the intracellularly stored polymer for growth. The yield 

YPHA/S was 0.61 Cmmol PHA/Cmmol S, where S is the sum of VFAs concentrations. 

Between the 1.5th and 8th hour of the cycle, PHA concentration decreased 53%. 

 

Figure 15. HB and HV monomers molar fraction evolution throughout the cycle from day 37 

 

 Figure 15 shows the evolution of the produced monomers during the cycle from 

day 37. In this case, the produced PHA was P(3HB-co-3HV). During the first 2 hours of 

the cycle, the HB molar fraction suffered an increased and from then on the copolymer 

composition became stable. At the 1.5th hour, the copolymer had a monomeric composition 

(on a molar basis) of 56:44 (HB:HV). 

5.1.1.2. 12 hour cycle period 

Several cycle lengths between 2 and 12 h were already tested for the selection of 

PHA-producing MMC (Reis et al 2011). In this work, the SBR was firstly operated in 24 h 

cycles and when a stabilization of the F/F values was observed, the cycle duration was 

changed to 12 h, in order to increase the number of cycles per SRT. Figure 16 shows the 

evolution of the various parameters monitored in the SBR cycle.

Regarding pH, the same tendency of the 24 h cycle was observed. The pH 

decreased to 8.01 after the feeding (t=0.25 h) and then increased until reaching 8.78. 

The concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, ammonium and LS increased 

after the feeding and then declined throughout the cycle. Acetic and butyric acids were 

consumed preferentially with uptake rates of 3.51 and 3.36 Cmmol/L.h, respectively. 

Propionic acid was consumed at 0.802 Cmmol/L.h. The same tendencies of VFAs 

consumption were observed in the 24 h cycle. During the first 2 hours of the cycle, COD 

was consumed at 0.276 g/L.h. No tendency on LS consumption was observed, so a 

consumption rate cannot be estimated. During the feast phase, ammonium was consumed 

at rate of 0.057 g/L.h. 

When the substrate was depleted, the famine phase started at the 2nd hour. In this 

cycle the feast phase occurred between the 0.25 and 2 hours and the famine phase occurred 

between the 3rd and 12th hours, originating a F/F ratio of 0.2.  

The maximum PHA concentration (31.8 Cmmol/L) was registered at the 2nd hour, 

which corresponded to the end of the feast phase. For this cycle, ?%PHA was 7.3%. After 

the 2nd hour, the concentration of PHA began to decrease since the stored PHA was 

consumed for growth and maintenance. The yield YPHA/S was 0.64 Cmmol PHA/Cmmol S.

The PHA concentration decreased 33% between the 2nd and 8th hour of the cycle. 

 

Figure 17. HB and HV monomers molar fraction evolution throughout the cycle from day 66 

 

Figure 17 shows the evolution of the produced monomers during the cycle from the 

66th day. At the 2nd hour, the produced copolymer had a monomeric composition (on a 

molar basis) of 79:21 (HB:HV). The composition of the copolymer was uniform 

throughout the cycle. When comparing these results with the ones from 24 h cycle, is 

possible to see that polymer composition was more stable in 12 h cycle. In this cycle, an 

increase in the HB content was observed which was not expected since the butyric acid 

proportions used in the feeding, were the same in both cycles. 

5.2. Accumulation tests 

After operating the SBR under feast and famine conditions for the enrichment in 

PHA-producing organisms, the storage response of the selected consortia was exploited in 

the third stage, which consisted in several accumulation tests operated in batch conditions. 

Three SBR purges from the previous days were used as inoculum for the accumulation 

tests. Since the objective of these tests was to evaluate the PHA production of the selected 

culture, the MMC was submitted to consecutive feeding pulses of VFA-rich medium, with 

the objective of maximizing PHA production. The effects of ammonium and phosphorus 

limitation were also studied.

5.2.1. Accumulation test without limitations 

The first kinetic test was performed with five pulses of feeding with the same 

composition used in the SBR without nutrient limitation, Figure 18. The kinetic and 

stoichiometric parameters are shown in Table 7. Five pulses of feeding were supplied to 

the bioreactor. Each pulse was added when increases in DO was detected, since it is 

associated with VFAs depletion. The addiction of a new pulse was associated with 

increases in VFAs, COD and ammonium concentrations and decreases of pH and DO 

concentration.  

Propionic and butyric acids were consumed to exhaustion in every pulse, but the 

contrary occurred with acetic acid. Butyric acid was preferably consumed, followed by 

acetic and propionic acids. In general, the moment of carbon source exhaustion is 

accompanied by a sudden increase of the DO concentration and by the OUR decrease 

(Serafim et al 2004). However, at the end of each of the five pulses, acetic acid was never 

depleted. The end of the pulses was only associated with a clear increase in the DO and 

exhaustion of butyric and propionic acids, which were present in the feeding in lower 

concentrations. 

The maximum PHA content obtained in this assay was 47.1% of cell dry weight at 

3.75 h, which is more 68.7% than at the beginning of the experiment. The overall yield 

YPHA/S obtained in this accumulation test was 0.39 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. Although the 

acetic acid was not depleted in any of the pulses, the yield YPHA/S from the 2
nd and 3rd 

pulses was higher than one (1.63 and 1.05 CmmolPHA/CmmolS, respectively). This is due 

to the fact that other non-quantified components of the medium, such as LS and phenolics, 

were probably converted to PHA. The produced copolymer had an average monomeric 

composition (on a molar basis) of 82:18 ± 2:2 (HB:HV). The monomeric composition of 

the copolymer was uniform throughout the test.

5.2.2. Accumulation test with phosphorus limitation 

Under phosphorus limitation, phosphorus is supposed to be more transferable than 

ammonium from one component of the cell to another, due to its reorganization in the 

cells. Moreover, under phosphorus limitation, ATP synthase activity decreases and the 

Krebs cycle is restrained, promoting the conversion of excess carbon into PHA. PHA 

production by axenic cultures appears to be higher under phosphorus limitation than under 

ammonium limitation (Cavaillé et al 2013). For this motives, phosphorus limitation was 

tested in an accumulation test. The results obtained are shown in Figure 19 and kinetic and 

stoichiometric parameters in Table 7. Three pulses of feeding without phosphorus were 

supplied to the bioreactor. As in the previous assay, only the butyric and propionic acids 

were consumed to exhaustion in all the pulses, while acetic acid was never exhausted. 

However, the increase in the DO that generally follows substrate depletion was detected at 

the end of each pulse. Nevertheless, acetic acid was preferably consumed, followed by 

butyric and propionic acids. 

Growth rates in this kinetic test were lower than those obtained in the accumulation 

test without limitations. This was expected since, under phosphorus limitation, less carbon 

is deviated to growth being used for PHA storage.  

The maximum PHA content obtained was 32.7% of cell dry weight at 4 h, which 

was more 57.6% than at the beginning of the experiment. Although acetic acid was always 

available, during all the pulses the same tendency was observed: first an increase of PHA 

content occurred, followed by its decrease. The overall yield YPHA/S obtained in this 

accumulation test was 0.34 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. The produced copolymer had an 

average monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of 71:29 ± 12:12 (HB:HV). 

Cavaillé et al. (2013) investigated P(3HB) production by waste activated sludge in 

aerobic fed-batch conditions using acetic acid as substrate, under phosphorus limitation. A 

maximum P(3HB) content of 67% (gP(3HB)/gVSS) and P(3HB) yields ranging from 0.21 

to 0.31 Cmmol P(3HB)/Cmmol S were obtained. Although, the maximum PHA content 

obtained in this accumulation test was lower than the one obtained by Cavaillé and co-

workers, the yield YPHA/S was higher.

5.2.3. Accumulation test with ammonium limitation 

Ammonium limitation usually triggers PHA production by MMC mixed cultures. 

Under ammonium limitation, protein synthesis decreases and the carbon flow is redirected 

to PHA synthesis. Ammonium limitation impacts the cell growth by reducing enzymatic 

activity (Cavaillé et al 2013). Based on these findings, the production of PHA under 

ammonium limitation was also studied in this work. 

The results obtained are shown in Figure 20 and the kinetic and stoichiometric 

parameters in Table 7. Five pulses of feeding were supplied to the bioreactor and each 

pulse was added when an increase in DO was detected. Contrary to what was observed in 

the previous accumulation tests, VFAs were consumed to exhaustion in all the pulses. 

Substrate depletion was accompanied by an increase of DO and OUR decrease. Acetic acid 

was preferably consumed, followed by butyric and propionic acids. Despite no ammonium 

was added to the medium, the fact that the inoculum used was withdrawn from the SBR 

could explain the presence of some ammonium in the medium during the accumulation 

test. 

Since ammonium is essential for growth, it can be assumed that most of the carbon 

consumed was redirected only to PHA production and cell maintenance. Because of this, 

growth rates were inferior than those obtained in the accumulation test without nutrient 

limitation. The maximum PHA content obtained was 34.6% of cell dry weight at 5.25 h, 

which was more 82.7% than at the beginning of the experiment. The overall yield YPHA/S 

obtained in this accumulation test was 0.79 CmmolPHA/CmmolS. The produced 

copolymer had an average monomeric composition (on a molar basis) of 76:24 ± 1:1 

(HB:HV), which coincided with the composition of the copolymer produced in the SBR at 

the same time. The monomeric composition of the copolymer was uniform throughout the 

test. 

The PHA storage capacity in this accumulation test is much lower than others 

described in the literature. For example, Johnson et al. (2009) operated an acetate-fed SBR 

in order to select a PHA-accumulating MMC and evaluated the PHA storage capacity of 

the selected MMC in a fed-batch reactor under nitrogen limitation. The enriched mixed 

culture produced PHA up to a cellular content of 89 wt % within 7.6 h. Albuquerque et al. 

(2010b) also reached a maximum PHA content of 74.6% in a accumulation test, using as 

substrate a complex feedstock such as fermented sugar molasses.

5.3. Microbial Community Characterization 

5.3.1. Morphological Analysis 

As stated previously, the analysis of the evolution of the microbial community 

throughout the reactor operation is crucial. The morphology of the selected MMC were 

analysed using several biological staining methods such as Gram, Neisser and Nile blue. 

Phase contrast microscopy was also used to identify the main morphotypes present in the 

microbial community.  

Gram, Neisser and Nile blue staining techniques were performed to original sludge 

and samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, 51, 60 and 66 of operation. The 

results are summarized in Table 8. The MMC was dominated by Gram negative (Gram-) 

cells throughout the entire operational period, yet a slight increase of Gram positive 

(Gram+) cells was observed at the 55th day of SBR operation. The high Gram- bacteria 

content is positive since these bacteria usually show good growth and higher PHA 

accumulation capability (Valappil et al 2006). With Gram staining it is also possible to 

infer about the cells’ morphology. The dominant morphologies were cocci and bacilli, 

especially forming in dense aggregates. Some streptobacilli and streptococci were also 

detected. 

Regarding Neisser staining results, Neisser negative (Neisser-) cells were dominant 

in the beginning of the operational period and an increase of Neisser positive (Neisser+) 

cells was observed throughout the reactor operation. It is worth noting that some of the 

Neisser+ cells were totally stained instead of presenting dark spots on the edge of the cells, 

which are typical of the phosphorous accumulating organisms. 

Nile Blue stain is a technique that can be used to confirm the presence of PHA-

accumulating bacteria. Since the beginning of SBR operation, the presence of PHA 

inclusion bodies was easily noticeable by the existence of brilliant dots in the stained cells 

under epifluorescence.

5.3.2. EPS Staining results  

Because of the high tendency of the biomass to generate dense and indestructible 

aggregates, EPS production was evaluated using three different staining techniques 

specific for the different components of EPS. These techniques were performed to original 

sludge and samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, 51, 60 and 66 of operation. 

EPS is a highly hydrated gel that acts as a cementing substance in biofilms and 

flocs (de Beer et al 1996). Generally, EPS are understood to be extracellular polymers 

mainly composed of microbial polysaccharides. However, other extracellular polymeric 

substances may also be associated with EPS, such as proteins, nucleic acids and polymeric 

lipophilic compounds (Neu et al 2001). In this work, Calcofluor white was utilized to stain 

the ?-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides, FITC was used to stain proteins and other amine-

containing compounds and Concanavalin A was bonded to ?-mannopyranosyl and ?-

glucopyranosyl sugar residues.  

Table 9 shows the results of EPS staining. It is possible to see that the EPS content 

was inferior in the original sludge and on the 17th day of operation and it increased 

throughout the reactor operation period. This leads to believe that EPS production could be 

related to the high toxicity of the HSSL, since EPS content suffered an increase throughout 

the reactor operation. The production of EPS can be an inconvenience since it requires 

consumption of substrate, deviating it from growth and PHA production, reducing the 

expected productivities.

5.3.3. FISH results 

5.3.3.1. Microbial Community Identification 

Throughout the SBR operating period, it is necessary to monitor the population in 

order to identify the different groups of microorganisms and relate them with the storage 

capacity and kinetics of the MMC (Queirós et al 2015). For these motives, FISH analysis 

was performed to original sludge and samples collected from the SBR on days 17, 32, 45, 

51, 60 and 66 of operation. 

In order to decrease the cellular aggregates of the MMC, which may negatively 

impact the visualization of FISH hybridised cells, a sludge pre-treatment using glass beads 

was performed. Since cellular aggregation still remained too high, an ultrasound treatment 

was applied, strongly reducing the size of microbial aggregates. 

Initially, specific probes for the main Phyla within Bacteria domain were applied. 

The microbial community was mostly composed of Bacteria since no Archaea were 

detected. The ratio between Bacteria that hybridized with EUBmix probe and the total 

DAPI stained cells was over 70%, which is a normal result for FISH characterization of 

activated sludge samples. To continue the bacterial community identification, several FISH 

probes were applied taking into consideration Bacteria previously reported as PHA-

accumulating organisms. 

In order to identify the microbial community and to follow the MMC composition 

throughout the reactor operation, specific probes for the main groups within Bacteria 

domain were applied: Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, 

Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Flavobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Sphingobacteria, 

Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetales (Table 5, section 3.7.6). 

Figure 21 shows the evolution of the composition during the reactor operation. 

Since the beginning of the process, Betaproteobacteria were the dominant group and the 

relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria only suffered mild fluctuations during the whole 

reactor operation time. Since Betaproteobacteria were reported to possess PHA-producing 

ability, this shows that the operational conditions applied during the SBR operation 

favoured the maintenance of this group of bacteria within the MMC. Alphaproteobacteria 

were the second most dominant group in the bacterial community throughout the SBR 

operational time. 



 77 

The bacteria community composition did not suffer major alterations throughout 

the whole operational period. Flavobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Sphingobacteria 

percentage suffered an increase on day 45 (from 4.96 ± 1.73% to 12.0 ± 1.77%) and 

Actinobacteria appeared in the culture on day 60 with a small percentage (0.65 ± 0.13%). 

 

Figure 21. Bacterial community evolution throughout the SBR operation 

 

Due to the high aggregation of the cells in the sample from the original sludge 

(inoculum), FISH quantification for this sample was not possible. However, the group-

specific probes were also applied to this sample and after microscope observation of the 

results, it was possible to infer that Betaproteobacteria was the dominant group in the 

bacterial community, followed by Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. 

As previously mentioned, a stabilization of the culture occurred between the 60th 

and the 66th days and an apparent pseudo-stationary phase was established. By analysing 

the bacterial composition in these days, it is possible to conclude that the bacterial 

community did not suffer significant changes during this period. Betaproteobacteria 

remained as the dominant group and its relative abundance was constant during this period 

(42.99 ± 0.38% on day 60 and 40.76 ± 2.15% on day 66). 

Previous studies from Albuquerque et al. (2013), Lemos et al. (2008), Moita and

5.3.3.2. Analysis at genus level 

 

Bacterial community identification continued using specific probes for genera 

inside Beta- and Alphaproteobacteria, since these were the dominant groups present in the 

culture. This evaluation was only performed for samples belonging to the pseudo-

stationary phase (on 60th and 66th days). 

Regarding the Alphaproteobacteria group, specific probes for Sphingomonas (Beer 

et al 2004), Defluvicoccus (Meyer et al 2006) and Defluvicoccus related Tetrad Forming 

Organism (TFO-DF) (Wong et al 2004) were applied. Positive results were only obtained 

for Defluvicoccus related TFO-DF (0.78 ± 0.38%), as shown in Figure 22. 

A specific probe for Amaricoccus was also tested, since this genus was reported as 

having PHA-storing ability (Lemos et al 2008). However, no positive binding of the 

specific probe was found.

For the Betaproteobacteria group, specific probes for Thauera and Azoarcus 

genera were applied due to their previous identification as PHA-accumulating organisms 

(Dionisi et al 2005a; Dionisi et al 2005c; Serafim et al 2006; Albuquerque et al 2013). 

Positive results were obtained for both genera as can be seen in Figure 23 and Figure 24. 

However, only small amounts of Thauera (0.72 ± 0.25%) and Azoarcus (0.62 ± 0.02%) 

were found.

After applying available genera specific probes for the Betaproteobacteria group, 

the main part of this population remained unidentified. The identification of 

Betaproteobacteria by FISH analysis was only possible once the sequence data from 16S 

rRNA gene clone library was available. During the analysis of the sequence data, 16S 

rRNA gene sequences belonging to the Acidovorax genus appeared quite frequently. 

Moreover, Acidovorax was previously shown to be capable of PHA storage (Schulze et al 

1999). Schulze et al. (1999) developed the probe ACI145 based on 16S rRNA gene 

sequences of the available Acidovorax species. The probe ACI145 with the sequence 5'-

TTTCGCTTCGTTATCCCC-3', was synthetized by BioFab (Rome, Italy) and applied to 

all samples. Positive results were obtained for all the screened samples and it was observed 

that Acidovorax content in the microbial community increased from 2.62 ± 0.93% (in day 

17) to 28.98 ± 2.51% (in day 66). During the pseudo-stationary phase, the Acidovorax 

genus became the major constituent of the Betaproteobacteria, constituting 71% of the 

Betaproteobacteria population on day 66 (Figure 25). The results of the probe 

hybridization are shown in Figure 26.

5.3.4. 16S rRNA gene Clone Library Results 

To identify the main bacteria responsible for PHA accumulation in the selected 

MMC, a 16S rDNA clone library was constructed. The sample used to extract the DNA 

was collected from the SBR on the 66th day of operation. A total of 108 white colonies 

were screened, and after performing PCR and electrophoresis to check the occurrence of 

amplification, 60 clones were chosen for partial sequencing. The obtained 16S rDNA 

partial sequences were then analysed by BLAST and grouped by genera (Table 11). 

The major part of the clones present in the clone library belonged to 

Betaproteobacteria class. Inside this class, genera Acidovorax and Simplicispira were the 

most represented, but Rhodoferax, Comamonas, Ramlibacter, Hydrogenophaga, 

Limnohabitans, Giesbergeria, Albidiferax, Thauera, and Variovorax were also detected. 

The second most dominant class was Alphaproteobacteria, including genera 

Paracoccus, Agrobacterium and Shinella as the most represented and Catellibacterium and 

Novosphingobium in minor amounts. These results were also in line with the FISH 

analysis. 

Regarding the less abundant genera in the clone library, the genus 

Pseudoxanthomonas, belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria group, and genera 

Leadbetterella (Cytophagia group) and Salinirepens (Flavobacteria group) were also 

recovered in the clone library. 

These results were expected since, during the pseudo-stationary phase, 

Betaproteobacteria was the dominant group of the bacterial community (40.76 ± 2.15%) 

followed by Alfaproteobacteria (12.68 ± 0.79 %) and Gammaproteobacteria was only 

present at a small percentage (2.55 ± 0.54). 

Some species of Acidovorax (Schulze et al 1999), Thauera (Dionisi et al 2005c), 

Comamonas (Saito and Doi 1994), Paracoccus (Ueda et al 1992) and Hydrogenophaga 

(Choi et al 1999)  genera were already described as PHA-accumulating organisms. 

Ferreira et al. (2015) isolated and characterized organisms able to store PHA, from 

a MMC selected under ADF conditions. A16S rRNA gene clonal analysis was performed 

and clones related to Comamonas spp. and Novosphingobium spp. were also detected. 

However, in the work of Ferreira et al. (2015), the MMC selection was performed using 

unfermented HSSL, which can explain the differences in the microbial community 

composition.

 After analysing the results of the partial sequencing, 15 clones were chosen for 

complete sequencing and refinement of their taxonomic affiliation. 16S rDNA sequences 

were manually aligned and analysed by BLAST and the highest similarity was determined, 

Table 12. The obtained sequences were then submitted to GenBank.  

Several microorganisms present in the clone library were already described as 

PHA-accumulating organisms in pure culture: Comamonas acidovorans using 1,4-

butanediol or 4-hydroxybutyric acid, methanol and n-amyl alcohol as substrate (Saito and 

Doi 1994), Paracoccus denitrificans consuming ?-butyrolactone alone or with fructose or 

butyric acid (Ueda et al 1992), Alcaligenes eutrophus using soya wastes from a soya milk 

dairy (Doi et al 1990) and Alcaligenes latus using malt wastes from a beer brewery plant as 

substrate (Yu et al 1999). Acidovorax spp. (Schulze et al 1999) was also described as a 

PHA producer.

A tree showing the phylogenetic diversity among the 15 clones is shown in Figure 

27. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method based on 

the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei 1993).  

All the sequences were related to each other and to PHA-producing 

microorganisms already described in the literature and previously found in culture 

selection processes for PHA production. Six (CR1, CR2, CR8, CR9, CR14 and CR15) of 

the 15 sequences were related to Acidovorax. Clones CR1, CR2 and CR15 were closely 

related to Acidovorax caeni and clones CR8 and CR14 to Acidovorax radicis. Contrarily to 

what was revealed by the BLAST search, the clone CR9 was closer to Acidovorax 

wautersii than to Simplicispira metamorpha. Clone CR15 was also closer to Acidovorax 

caeni than to Simplicispira metamorpha. Two sequences (CR5 and CR10) were related to 

Comamonas testosteroni. Sequences CR3, CR4, CR6, CR7, CR11, CR12, and CR13 were 

related to Fluviicola taffensis, Leadbetterella byssophila, Paracoccus siganidrum, 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Alcaligenes aquatilis, Shinella zoogloeoides and 

Pseudoxanthomonas kaohsiungensis, respectively. 

Lampropedia hyalina (Beccari et al 2010; Valentino et al 2014), Azoarcus sp. 

(Serafim et al 2006), Thauera sp. (Dionisi et al 2005c), Bacillus megaterium (Omar et al 

2001), Plasticicumulans acidivorans (Valentino et al 2014), Thiocystis violacea (Sudesh et 

al 2000) and Zoogloea sp. (Moita and Lemos 2012) are microorganisms with phylogenetic 

relationships with the clones and are known PHA producers previously found in MMC 

selection processes for PHA production. Moreover, Alcaligenes sp. (Doi et al 1990; Yu et 

al 1999) is a well known PHA producer. Comamonas testosteroni (Kasuya et al 1994) and 

Acidovorax facilis (Mergaert et al 1993) were already described as PHA degrading 

microorganisms. Once again, these results prove that the culture selection process was 

successful.

6. Concluding remarks 

In this work, a three-step process was used for PHA production. In the first step, 

HSSL, a by-product of pulp industry, was submitted to acidogenic fermentation in order to 

produce a mixture rich in VFAs, which was used as substrate in the next two steps. In the 

second step, a SBR was operated for 70 days under ADF conditions in order to select a 

MMC able to produce PHA. A pseudo-stationary state was reached after 60 days of SBR 

operation, which indicated that the MMC was able to successfully adapt to the carbon 

source. In the third step, the ability of the selected MMC to accumulate PHA was tested. 

Three accumulation tests were performed and the selected MMC reached a maximum PHA 

content of 47.1%. 

FISH analysis showed that Betaproteobacteria was the dominant phylogenetic 

group in the bacterial community. On day 66, Betaproteobacteria constituted 40.8 ± 2.2% 

of total bacteria. The remaining bacteria belonged mostly to the Alphaproteobacteria (12.7 

± 0.8%), Gammaproteobacteria (2.55 ± 0.5%) and Bacteroidetes (14.9 ± 1.7%) groups. 

Inside Betaproteobacteria, a considerable amount of Acidovorax (28.9 ± 3.1%) was 

detected. The typical genera found in MMCs selected in SBRs operated under ADF 

conditions, Thauera and Azoarcus, were only found in small amounts.  

Nile Blue results revealed the high abundance of PHA inclusion bodies that were 

maintained since the beginning of SBR operational period. 

Clone library results presented several clones that were already described as PHA-

producers. These results also matched with the FISH analysis, since the major part of the 

clones belonged to the Betaproteobacteria group. Moreover, a significant number of 

clones belonged to the Acidovorax genera, which was already described as a PHA-

producer. Phylogenetic analysis proved that the clones were related with PHA-producing 

organisms.  

The results obtained in this work showcase the potential of the three-step process 

for PHA production. With 70 days of SBR operation, a culture with high abundance of 

PHA producing organisms was selected, which indicates that the selection process was 

well performed.

7. Future prospects 

As already mentioned the MMC response during the selection process is influenced 

by different factors. For this motive, this research should focus on the influence of the 

reactor operating conditions in the MMC selection process. Some of the operational 

conditions to be studied are: SRT, HRT, pH, temperature, cycle length, OLR, influent 

substrate concentration and nutrient concentration. PHA production under phosphorus and 

ammonium limitation should also be the target of further investigation.  

It is known that the VFA mixture made available to the PHA-storing 

microorganisms will influence the PHA composition and HB:HV ratio, which in turn 

affects PHA physical and mechanical properties. Testing different operational conditions 

during the acidogenic fermentation step to determine their influence in VFA production 

and in polymer composition should also be considered. 

Throughout the SBR operational time, Acidovorax content suffered an increase. 

Since this organism is a known PHA accumulator, a bioaugmentation strategy can be 

adopted in order to promote the Acidovorax growth inside the bacterial community. This 

study should focus on factors such as Acidovorax growth conditions, VFA preference and 

possible changes in the operational conditions.
