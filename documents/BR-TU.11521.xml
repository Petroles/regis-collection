Resumo 
 

O Sultanado de Omã situa-se na península arábica e desde sempre despertou grande interesse geológico 

por nele aflorar a maior e mais bem preservada secção de manto superior, crosta oceânica e sedimentos 

pelágicos, conhecida como ofiolito de Sumail. A obducção deste ofiolito sobre a plataforma arábica 

ocorreu durante o Cretácico Superior, relacionando-se com o fecho do oceano Tétis. A sequência 

obductada pode atingir os 20 km de espessura e ocupa toda a região nordeste do Sultanado (Montanhas 

de Omã), formando uma faixa de direção NE-SE com ca. de 550 km de comprimento e 150 km de 

largura. Da base para o topo esta sequência compreende harzburgitos tectonizados (manto superior), 

uma porção gabroica com texturas variadas cortada por dioritos e trondjemitos, e um complexo de diques  

que alimenta a sequência extrusiva (lavas em almofada) superior. Esta última pode ser subdividida , 

dependendo dos autores, até um máximo de 5 unidades principais. Geotimes é a unidade basal desta 

sequência extrusiva, repousando diretamente sobre o complexo de dique em dique. Sobre esta assenta a 

unidade Lasail que, de acordo com Kusano et al. (2012), desenvolve interdigitações com a Geotimes 

sugerindo a possibilidade de corresponder a uma mera subunidade da última. A unidade Alley repousa 

sobre as duas últimas e partilha uma relação espacial com a unidade Boninítica. 

Os depósitos de sulfuretos maciços vulcanogénicos localizam-se maioritariamente na região norte de 

Omã, entre as sequências lávicas, sobretudo na transição Geotimes-Lasail. Barrie e Hannington (1999) 

descrevem estes depósitos como sendo do tipo máfico devido à natureza das rochas encaixantes típicas  

nestes sistemas ofiolíticos. Os minérios são ricos em Cu e pobres em Pb quando comparados com outros  

depósitos do tipo VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide). As primeiras evidências de mineração destes 

depósitos remontam à Idade do Bronze, tendo incidido sobretudo nos domínios de enriquecimento 

secundário (supergénico) de cobre. As minas de Lasail, Bayda e Aarja, no distrito de Sohar, representam 

as primeiras explorações de minério, rico em calcopirite, conhecidas no país.  

O depósito de Mandoos 1 localiza-se no norte de Omã, no distrito de Sohar, e foi descoberto em 2009 

após campanha de prospeção geofísica (VTEM). Trata-se de um depósito oculto, coberto por gravilha s  

não consolidadas, possivelmente hospedado na unidade vulcânica Alley. A modelação tridimensiona l 

do depósito com o software MICROMINE revela um corpo mineralizado com 550 m de comprimento 

e largura máxima de 370 m, alongado segundo NW-SE e inclinado para SE; a sua espessura varia entre 

1 e 90 m. O cálculo do volume da lentícula de minério aponta para um valor global de 1.8 milhões m3 

que, assumindo uma densidade média de 4.44 g/cm3, resulta numa tonelagem de minério de 

aproximadamente 8 Mt com 1.72 wt% Cu. A modelação espacial da distribuição dos valores de 

concentração de Cu e Zn no depósito não colocou em evidência qualquer tipo de zonamento 

composicional relevante. 

Em Mandoos, duas campanhas distintas de amostragem foram efetuadas: uma amostragem pontua l 

levada a cabo pela Dra. Ana Jesus em 2015, ao longo da frente de exploração Este; e uma amostragem 

em sondagens cedidas pela Mawarid à Universidade GUtech. Destas amostragens resultou uma coleção 

de 42 amostras, 27 das quais referentes a minérios sulfuretados, 6 representando jaspes mineralizados , 

5 documentando sedimentos metalíferos e 4 basaltos mineralizados. Todas estas amostras foram alvo 

de caracterização petrográfica e geoquímica detalhada com o intuito de contribuir com informações úteis  

à compreensão do depósito de Mandoos e ao estabelecimento de um modelo metalogenético coerente. 

Os minérios associados a depósitos do tipo máfico são geralmente dominados por pirite, apresentando 

quantidades subordinadas de calcopirite e esfalerite. Tal é observado nos minérios texturalmente e 

mineralogicamente monótonos de Mandoos 1, os quais incluem ainda brechas cimentadas por sílica e

alguns filossilicatos. Os sulfuretos de ferro predominam (principalmente pirite), ocorrendo ainda  

calcopirite, esfalerite, algumas fases mais ricas em cobre e, raramente, galena. Por sua vez, as fases 

minerais constituintes da ganga correspondem maioritariamente a quartzo, filossilicatos e laumontite .  

Os minérios são relativamente pouco retrabalhados termicamente, permitindo a preservação de um 

grande número de arranjos espaciais primários, sendo bastante comum a presença de texturas 

framboidais e colomórficas, para além de icnofósseis tipo polychetae piritizados. A origem biogénic a  

de texturas framboidais foi rejeitada, tendo esta sido esta atribuída à propriedade ferromagnética da 

greigite, precursor da pirite em texturas framboidais. As fases mais ricas em Cu (bornite, covelite e 

spionkopite) são correlacionáveis com os estádios mais tardios de mineralização, evidenciando um 

evento mais oxidante. Esta lentícula mineralizada é alimentada por um stock work caracterizado por 

basaltos silicificados com disseminações de pirite e alguns veios preenchidos por pirite e calcopirite , 

não sendo evidente o desenvolvimento de uma rede anastomosada de veios mineralizados.  

Texturas primárias de marcassite (colomórfica) e crescimentos de wurtzite em espaço aberto (e em 

contexto proximal de black -smoker) são observadas em algumas das amostras estudadas. Contudo, a 

coexistência de duas fases de ferro (pirite e marcassite) e de zinco (esfalerite e wurtzite) foi atribuída às 

variações físico-químicas abruptas que se podem fazer sentir, em poucos centímetros, nestes sistemas. 

Estas duas fases (marcassite e wurtzite) cristalizam preferencialmente em equilíbrio com soluções 

hidrotermais ácidas, sendo a mistura destas soluções com a água do mar responsável pelo aumento de 

pH que, por sua vez, conduz ao desenvolvimento das fases mais estáveis nessas condições (pirite e 

esfalerite) 

Relativamente aos sedimentos metalíferos (umbers e ochres), estes evidenciam texturas sedimentares 

com alternâncias de bandas mais ricas ou empobrecidas em óxidos e hidróxidos de ferro. 

Adicionalmente, observam-se também pseudomorfoses de sulfuretos, completamente oxidados. Por sua 

vez os jaspes mineralizados apresentam abundantes disseminações de sulfuretos, sendo ainda cortados 

por veios selados por pirite e calcopirite. A formação dos jaspes foi interpretada como síncrona do 

evento evolutivo mais oxidante, responsável pela formação das fases mais ricas em Cu, enquanto a 

génese dos sedimentos metalíferos foi atribuída a eventos tardios de oxidação da lentícula mineraliza da  

no fundo oceânico e/ou à precipitação de metais libertados para a coluna de água em contexto exalativo 

e ambiente oxidante. 

Os dados de natureza geoquímica, mais precisamente a análise dos padrões de concentração normalizada  

de terras raras, sugere que a deposição dos minérios sulfuretados terá sido governada por misturas de 

água do mar e fluido hidrotermal, tal como nos jaspes, embora com proporções distintas. Os padrões 

obtidos para os sedimentos metalíferos (umbers e ochres) sugerem adsorção significativa de terras raras 

disponíveis na água do mar pelos filossilicatos constituintes dos sedimentos. As terras raras contidas nos 

minérios sulfuretados e nos jaspes deverão resultar da lixiviação dos basaltos a muro da mineralizaçã o, 

aquando da alteração hidrotermal. Os enriquecimentos em terras raras evidenciados pelas amostras de 

minério e jaspes podem ser alcançados com uma mistura de água do mar:basalto entre 0.85:0.15 e 

0.99:0.01 para basaltos pouco alterados e entre 0.50:0.50 e 0.95:0.05 no caso de basaltos alterados. A 

modelação das magnitudes características dos fluidos hidrotermais de análogos modernos (TAG e EPR) 

podem ser simuladas com proporções entre 0.999:0.001 e 0.9999:0.0001, contudo a anomalia positiva  

em Eu e fracionação positiva em terras raras leves e pesadas típicas nestes fluidos não são 

completamente reproduzidas. Os enriquecimentos relativos em Cd, W, Sn, Te e In revelados por alguns  

minérios sulfuretados indicam a possibilidade do fluido hidrotermal mineralizante incluir uma 

contribuição magmática (episódica? e muito diluída), a qual pode ainda justificar outras diferenças 

composicionais observadas.

Abstract 
 

The modelling of the Mandoos 1 massive sulphide deposit revealed an orebody of ca. 8 million tonnes 

with an average grade of 1.72 wt% Cu. The spatial distribution of Cu and Zn concentrations suggests 

that the ores are relatively homogenous in composition and were not significantly affected by metal 

zoning refinement processes. The massive sulphide lens is mainly composed of iron sulphide rich (pyrite  

± marcasite) breccias, cemented by silica ± phyllosilicates ± laumontite, having chalcopyrite (commonly 

altered to Cu-rich phases) and sphalerite as accessory minerals. The ores preserve large number of 

primary textures (colloform and framboidal) and also tubeworms (polychetae). The observed large 

amount of trace elements in the majority of mineral phases are consistent with the poor thermal 

reworking of the ores, also compatible with the monotonous and low diverse mineral assemblage.  This 

Cu-rich VMS deposit is characterised by secondary Cu enrichment, developed during an oxidis ing 

event, which might also be synchronous of jaspers formation. When these sulphide ores were not 

covered, a seafloor weathering produced sequences of umbers and ochres with variable thickness, where 

massive sulphide breccias are oxidised and impregnated with silica in a more cold and oxidis ing 

environment, although these can also be formed by direct precipitation of metals within the water 

column, derived from exhalative discharges and deposited in such conditions. The REE normalise d 

patterns of sulphide ores are consistent with a mixture of seawater and vent fluids (derived from basalt 

leaching – SW:B). The relative REE enrichments displayed by the ore samples can be simulated by a 

ratio of seawater (SW) and basalt (B) scattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01 for less altered basalts, 

while for altered basalts (B’) the values range from 0.50:0.50 to 0.95:0.05. The same is observed in 

sulphide-mineralised jaspers, while the REE in umbers and ochres derives entirely from seawater. 

Present-day vent-fluids REE magnitudes (TAG an EPR) are simulated with SW:B and SW:B’ 

interactions between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001. Nevertheless the pattern displayed by modern vent 

fluids, characterised by an evident Eu positive anomaly and positive LREE and HREE fractionation, is  

not completely reproduced by the performed simulation. Evidence of magmatic contributions to the 

hydrothermal mineralising fluid is supported by overall enrichments in Cd, W, Sn, Te and In; these 
contributions may also explain some other observed compositional differences.

Ore mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mandoos Volcanic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposit, Sumail Ophiolite, Oman 

1 
 

1. Introduction and Objectives 
 

Oman, located in the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula is bordered by the United Arab 

Emirates (northwest), Saudi Arabia (West) and Yemen (southwest). The geologic al relevance of the 

country comes mostly because of the largest and also the best preserved slab of upper mantle, oceanic 

crust and pelagic sediments in the world known as the Sumail ophiolite. A series of nappes were also 

emplaced along with the ophiolite; those thrust sheets comprise, from the bottom to the top, the Sumeini, 

Hawasina, and Haybi nappes, that were emplaced onto the Arabian continental margin between 

Coniacian and Campanian, during Neo-Tethys closure (Immenhauser et al. 2000). 

According to Barrie and Hannington (1999), the volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS) hosted 

in ophiolitic sequences are classified as “mafic type” due to the predominance of mafic rocks. Deposits 

of this type are normally fewer in number, smaller in size, Cu-rich and Pb-poor when compared with 

other types of massive sulphide ores. In Oman, VMS deposits are mostly found in the northern part of 

the Sumail ophiolite, where the volcanic lava sequences are best exposed, and its exploitation goes back 

to the Bronze Age. 

The Mandoos deposit was discovered in 2009 when the Mawarid Mining conducted a Versatile Time-

domain Electro-Magnetic (VTEM) survey over an extension of wadi gravels in the north of Oman. Four 

first-order anomalies were identified in the region and the presence of massive sulphides was confirmed 

during a subsequent drilling survey. The Mandoos 1, Mandoos 2 and Mandoos 3 anomalies host massive 

sulphides but only the first includes Cu-mineralisation and tonnage economically viable for exploitation.  

The last anomaly (Mandoos 4) did not revealed the presence of orebodies of any kind (Mawarid Mining, 

2014). 

The Mandoos 1 deposit is located in the Sohar region and is hosted in massive basaltic lavas  possibly 

related to the Alley volcanic unit. The mining operations started in October 2011 with extraction by 

open pit and lasted till early-2015, when all activities were abandoned due to economic issues. 

Underground exploration did not start due to problems with the local community. Engineers assessed a 

total mineral resource of 8 million tonnes of massive sulphides, with 5 million tonnes in reserves at 1.8% 

Cu (Mawarid Mining, 2014). 

Samples for this study were obtained from in situ sampling and drill-cores picking from the assortment 

offered by the Company to the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech). The main 

objective of this work consists on the mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the Mandoos  

massive sulphide ores, by means of: (1) detailed re-logging of the drill-cores at GUtech; (2) petrography 

and detailed mineralogical studies with an Electron Probe Micro Analyser (EPMA); (3) whole rock 

multi-element geochemistry of a set of pre-selected samples from 2 different sampling surveys. All the 

petrography and analytical work was focused on massive sulphide samples (breccias), metalliferous  

sediments (umbers and ochres) and jaspers (mineralised). The numerical analysis and modelling of data 

mining assay for a large number of drill cores provided by Mawarid Mining further allowed assessing 

the vertical/lateral metal zonation in the orebody. The data and information collected represent a 

significant contribution to the establishment of a comprehensive metallogenetic model for the Mandoos  

VMS deposit.

2. Geological Setting 

2.1 Regional Setting 

In Palaeozoic times, Oman was part of the Gondwana (southern half of Pangea supercontinent), bordered 

by Paleo-Tethys to the north and east and by Panthalassa to the west. From Late Carboniferous to Early 

Permian all the eastern region of Oman was covered by a thick ice sheet as recorded by tillite deposits  

of the Hufq-Haushi area (Immenhauser et al. 2000). After that glaciation, a climatic warming result in 

lacustrine deposits in eastern Oman. The break-up of Gondwana led to the opening of two basins: the 

first rifting event separated the eastern Oman territory (Afro-Arabia) from northern Gondwana, called 

the early Indian Ocean-Batain basin; the second rifting event detached the northern Arabia territory from 

future parts of Eurasia, labelled as Neo-Tethyan Hawasina basin. The rift shoulder uplift and the 

simultaneous sea level rise led to the deposition of the Haushi Group sediments (shallow marine and 

fluvial) in the Early Permian. The subsequent global sea level rise and the thermal subsidence of the rift 

shoulders submerged the northern and eastern territories of Oman, resulting on the deposition of the 

Akhdar Group carbonates (Immenhauser et al. 2000). By the Middle-Late Permian, a large carbonate 

platform was established over Oman (Saiq Formation) and this sedimentation lasted until Aptian-

Cenomanian. Outwards of the shelf carbonate platform, shelf slope carbonates from the Sumeini Group, 

proximal basin facies sediments from the Hawasina complex were developed. Two volcanic horizons, 

comprising alkaline-basalts and rhyolitic tuffs from Triassic, are preserved within the Saiq Formation 

(Haybi complex). Sedimentation along the Arabian platform ceased at the end of Cenomanian when the 

Aruma foreland basin was formed as a consequence of the passive margin contraction (Glennie et al., 

1973). In Upper Cretaceous (between Coniacian and Campanian times), the Sumeini, Hawasina, Haybi 

and ophiolite nappes were emplaced onto the Arabian platform. The Sumeini, Hawasina and Haybi 

complex are contemporaneous units preserving different, progressively more distal paleogeographic  

facies (Searle et al., 2003), but are nevertheless commonly referred to, as the Hawasina nappes.

2.1.1 Emplacement Models and Geodynamic Implications 

The tectonic setting of the Sumail ophiolite is still open to discussion. According to various authors, the 

ophiolite was originated in a typical mid-ocean ridge environment while others propose a supra-

subduction zone for its origin. The mid-ocean ridge model implies an obduction starting at the ridge; 

therefore, similar ages would be expected for the ophiolite units and the subduction zone footwall 

(metamorphic sole and Haybi complex), which is not the case (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999). The Haybi complex 

is older than the ophiolite unit and records an oceanic-derived volcanism such as the Triassic alkaline  

(ankaramites, nephelinites) and tholeiitic basalts (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999), as well as the Late Permian and 

Late Triassic limestone blocks and Cretaceous melanges. The amphibolites forming the metamorphic  

sole are compositionally distinct of the ophiolite volcanic rocks and the Haybi complex alkaline basalts 

display geochemical trends similar to those of the Haybi tholeiitic volcanic rocks (Triassic or Jurassic). 

Therefore, the ophiolite obduction could not have started at the mid-ocean ridge (Searle et al., 1999); 

this is further reinforced by the similar dating of plagiogranites and metamorphic sole (Hacker, 1994), 

placing the subduction of Haybi complex basalts beneath the ophiolite at the same time of the ophiolite  

was developed during the Cenomanian-Tourian (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999). 

 

The plausible setting where older and colder material could be in contact with hot-forming ophiolite  

rocks would be a transform-fault zone; however, clear evidence for that structural array is missing at 

Oman (MacLeod &amp;amp; Rothery, 1992). Searle &amp;amp; Cox (1999) reject both previous models for the tectonic 

setting that formed the Sumail ophiolite, which must have started above a northeast-dipping zone, away 

from the continental margin. The emplacement of the Sumail ophiolite began along with the Suma il 

thrust in a trench where older, colder ocean floor rocks (Haybi complex) were being subducted to the 

NE beneath the Sumail ophiolite, at the same time or right after the Sumail crustal sequence formation.  

Between 97-75 Ma the ophiolite was formed at a spreading centre above a northeast-dipping zone. The 

subduction of Haybi volcanic rocks reached 12-14 km below the Moho and their metamorphic  

recrystallisation achieved the upper amphibolitic facies conditions in a time span between 95-93 Ma 

(Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999). Those amphibolites formed the metamorphic sole and were welded to the base of 

the mantle sequence of the ophiolite. During burial processes, greenschist facies metamorphism affected 

the Haybi volcanic rocks, manganiferous cherts, exotic limestones, and shales, and they were welded 

onto the base of the amphibolites. All this sequence, ophiolite and metamorphic sole, was then emplaced 

onto the Arabian platform, reaching a distance of 350-400 km in a southwest direction (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 

1999).

Haybi complexes before the emplacement; B – formation of the metamorphic sole (in Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999). 

Paleo-depths of metamorphism were estimated from high-pressure metamorphic rocks presently located 

in the southeastern sector of the ophiolite. All the continental margin of the Oman Mountains was 

subducted to lower levels, in opposition to the central sector where no high-pressure metamorphic rocks 

are known. The deepest metamorphism is recorded by the As Sifah eclogites (garnet + clinopyroxene + 

glaucophane + phengite–bearing metabasalts and garnet + chloritoid–bearing metapelites) that were 

subducted to depths around 90 km. The eclogites occur within the Permian carbonated Saiq formation 

and evolved along a clockwise P-T path culminating at 20–23 ± 2.5 kbar and 540 ± 75 °C, suggesting 

that the continental crust was subducted underneath the ophiolite. Medium-pressure rocks are known in 

the northern part of the ophiolite from crossite- and glaucophane-bearing metabasalts in the north of 

Oman and high-pressure garnet amphibolites in the United Arab Emirates; however, in Bani Hamid 

area, the granulite facies point to P-T conditions of metamorphism of 6–9 kbar and 850 °C. In opposition 

to the Haybi complex that formed the majority of the metamorphic sole, the protoliths of granulites were 

quartzites and carbonates from the continental margin (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999).

2.1.2 The Sumail Ophiolite 

The Sumail ophiolite, also referred as Semail or Samail in the literature, has been recognised as the best 

preserved and largest slab of upper mantle, oceanic crust and pelagic sediments accessible on land. It 

was emplaced from NE to SW onto the Arabian passive continental margin, during late Cretaceous times 

due to the closure of the Tethys Ocean. With approximately 550 km long and 150 km wide (Searle et 

al., 1999) the ophiolite belt comprises a complete section of the upper crust peridotites (8 – 12 km) and 

oceanic crust (4 – 7 km) (Lippard et al., 1986), exposing a slice of oceanic lithosphere up to 20 km thick.   

The typical oceanic lithosphere is entirely exposed in the Sumail ophiolite and its emplacement onto the 

Arabian platform did not result in significant structural dismembering; i.e., despite of regional doming 

and local thrusting, primary lithostratigraphic relationships are fairly preserved. It is believed that the 

oceanic nappe, along with several structurally underlying nappes, was emplaced in its present position 

(Glennie et al., 1973). 

The mantle sequence of the Sumail ophiolite is mainly composed of tectonised harzburgite, originate d 

by partial melting of fertile primary spinel lherzolite (Searle et al., 1999). Below the Moho, high 

temperature mineral lineations formed due to the plastic flow during mantle upwelling and diverging 

away from the ridge. Mineral fabrics originated during the ophiolite emplacement overprint these early 

mantle fabrics along the base, as evident in a strongly banded harzburgite -lherzolite-dunite basal unit.  

The appearance of plagioclase marks the petrological Moho, where dunite pods with small chromite-

rich lenses occur (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999).  

The oceanic crustal section of the ophiolite is composed of cumulate gabbros overlain by isotropic  

gabbros which are intruded by diorites and trondhjemites; some discordant wehrlites can intrude higher 

levels of the crustal sequence. A sheeted dyke complex outlines the main pathways that fed the extrusive  

pillow lavas (Searle &amp;amp; Cox, 1999). Up to 2 km of lavas form the upper sequence of the ophiolite , 

outcropping mostly in northern part of Oman. The volcanic sequence can be subdivided into different 

units depending on the authors, resulting in a maximum of five major units (Alabaster et al, 1982; Gilge n 

et al., 2014), as addressed below.

2.1.3 Volcano-stratigraphic Sequence 

As aforementioned, the upper section of the ophiolite nappe is composed of up to 2 km of pillow lavas 

covered by up to 30 m of pelagic sediments containing microfossils of Cenomanian to Turonian age 

(Gilgen et al., 2014). U-Pb zircon ages of trondhjemites from many different levels along the ophiolite  

section fall in the time window from 97.3 to 94.4 Ma (Rollinson, 2009). Those ages, considered together 

with micropaleontology data gathered from pelagic sediments interbedded in the lavas, allow inferring 

that the seafloor volcanism was active during ca. 10 m.y. (from ca. 98.9 to 89 Ma). According to Searle 

and Malpas (1982), it took 3 to 7 m.y. from the volcanism cessation until the ophiolite obduction; other 

authors assume that the time span was even shorter, from 1 to 2 m.y. The Sumail ophiolite lavas form a 

defined set of volcano-stratigraphic units presumably derived from overlapping volcanic centres at 

spreading axes and, thereafter, at off-axis locations (Gilgen et al., 2014). Five lava units were 

distinguished by Alabaster et al. (1982) according to field, petrological and geochemical characteristics; 

these are labelled as Geotimes, Lasail, Alley, Clinopyroxene-phyric, and Salahi. 

Geotimes is the lowermost unit of the extrusive volcanism; it lays directly on top of the sheeted dyke 

complex and can vary between 0.75 and 1.5km in thickness (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986).  

These lavas can be recognised in the field considering: (i) the common occurrence of tubular pillow s  

instead of massive flows; (ii) the scarcity of amygdule and variole-rich textures; and (iii) the typica l 

reddish-brown colour due to the widespread, fine-grained hematite dissemination and hematite-rich 

inter-pillow hyaloclastites. They are slightly depleted in incompatible trace elements when compared to 

N-MORB basalts, along with negative anomalies of Nb and Ta (Godard et al., 2003) 

The Lasail unit overlies, at least locally, Geotimes. According to Alabaster and Pearce (1985), the Lasail 

unit is restricted to some areas, being interpreted as a product of off-axis volcanism. However, follow ing 

Kusano et al. (2012), the Lasail unit is inter-fingered with Geotimes and can be simply envisaged as a 

subunit of the latter. It consists of grey to pale green basaltic to andesitic pillow lavas that can vary from 

0 to 0.75 km thick (Lippard et al., 1986); the typical green colour is due to the relative abundance of 

epidote and chlorite. Geochemically, the Lasail lavas are depleted in both light rare earth elements 

(LREE) and incompatible elements when compared to N-MORB basalts (Godard et al., 2003). 

The Alley unit lies on top of both Geotimes and Lasail, and comprises grey and brown pillowed and 

massive flows, as well as basalt breccias; this unit can vary from 0.75 to 2 km in thickness. The 2 to 3 

meters of pillows are characterised by abundant amygdule filled with zeolites and celadonite, besides 

glomerophyric clusters of clinopyroxene (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Alley and 

Lasail lavas share a similar normalised pattern for rare earth element (REE), although the concentration 

in LREE is slightly lower in Alley lavas. These two units can be also differentiated on the basis of Zr 

and Cr contents (Lippard et al., 1986).

Fig 2. 5 – Schematic representation of the volcano-stratighaphic sequence of the northern Oman 

illustrating also the position of some VMS deposits (adapted from Gilgen et al., 2014). 

Overlying these three volcanic units, some small-volume basaltic flows with abundant clinopyroxe ne  

phenocrysts are found, belonging to the Clinopyroxene-phyric unit; these lavas area characterised by 

lower Zr and Ti contents but higher Cr grades (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Salahi 

unit consists of alkaline to transitional within-plate lavas (Alabaster et al., 1982). These two latter units  

are restricted to specific areas and they are not found anywhere else besides the outcrops reported in 

Alabaster et al. (1982); both units are not associated with any sulphide mineralization (Gilgen et al., 

2014). Some boninitic outcrops show a spatial relationship with Alley lavas. Those lavas have regiona l 

meaning but it is not clear if all the occurrences are limited to just one stratigraphic unit; they usually 

occur as vesicular pillows and sheet flows, reaching several meters in thickness, with  

(micro)phenocrysts of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, and chrome-spinel (Gilgen et al., 2014).  

Some boninitic dykes found in the Shinas mine are younger than the Alley lavas, suggesting that their 

development and emplacement took place, at least in some areas, after the Alley unit.  

2.2 VMS Deposits  

Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposits precipitate from hydrothermal fluids and form 

stratiform accumulations of sulphides at sea floor level. Commonly associated with volcanic rocks, this  

type of deposits represent an important source of Cu, Zn, Pb, Au, and Ag along with Co, Sn, Ba, S, Se, 

Mn, Cd, In, Bi, Te, Ga, and Ge as co- or by-products. The study of active, metal-precipitating 

hydrothermal vents on the sea floor has been the key factor to understand the land-based VMS deposits 

formation (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). 



2. Geological Setting 

9 
 

A five-fold classification is commonly used to describe most of ancient and active VMS deposits. This  

classification is mainly based on the composition of the host rocks, assuming that the metals in sulphide  

ores derive mostly from leaching and scavenging of a footwall substrate. The main five types of host 

rocks composition where the classification is rooted are: mafic, bimodal-mafic, mafic-siliciclas tic , 

bimodal-felsic, and bimodal-silicic lastic (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). 

The “mafic type” is defined by the larger predominance of mafic rocks on the hosting stratigraphic 

sequence given the rare or even absence of felsic rocks, although minor siliciclastic or ultramafic rocks 

can be present. Ophiolites are one of the settings classified as mafic and most of the examples from this 

type are exclusively Phanerozoic in age. Ocean ridges, advanced back-arc rifts and supra-subduction 

spreading zones are the common settings where modern analogues of this type are found. The basaltic  

host rock is predominantly tholeiitic, with some local boninitic occurrences. Mafic VMS deposits are 

normally fewer in number, smaller, Cu-rich and Pb-poor in comparison with the other massive sulphide  

deposit types (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). 

The “bimodal-mafic” type is characterised by having more than 50% of mafic rocks and a low  

percentage (&gt; 3%) of felsic ones in the hosting sequence; the mafic/felsic ratio is 3:1 or greater, but 

felsic volcanic rocks are usually the nearest host rocks. The composition of the volcanic host rocks 

points to primitive volcanic arcs or rifted primitive volcanic arc settings. Mafic rocks are usually basaltic  

and tholeiitic (can be transitional to calc-alkaline), while felsic rocks have a rhyolitic composition or 

transitional with calc-alkaline rhyolites. Noranda (Quebec) and Kidd Creek (Ontario) are the two main 

examples of this “bimodal-mafic” type, although Kidd Creek is atypical due to its ultramafic footwall.  

The “mafic-siliciclastic” VMS type has identical proportions of mafic or intrusive rocks and siliciclas tic  

(turbidites); in this VMS type, felsic rocks occur in small amounts or may even be absent from the 

hosting sequence. The Besshi deposit in Japan is one land-based example of this VMS type, similar to 

the VMS occurrences in the rifted continental margin in the Gulf of California, the Middle Valley rift, 

or in the Escanaba trough at the northeast Pacific Ocean, or in the Atlantis II deeps of the Red Sea. 

The “bimodal-felsic” VMS type is characterised by a higher content of felsic volcanic rocks (&gt;50 %) in 

comparison with siliciclastic rocks (&lt;15 %) in the volcano-stratigraphic hosting sequence; mafic rocks 

usually complete the hosting sequence. Like in “bimodal-mafic” VMS deposits, deposits hosted in 

“bimodal-felsic” sequences share the same age distribution, but are more abundant in Phanerozoic times, 

usually related to more compositionally mature volcanic arcs, or rifted volcanic arc settings than the 

“bimodal-mafic” VMS types. High-silica rhyolite compositions are common in the felsic host rocks with 

calc-alkaline to transitional affinities, while the mafic rocks comprise calc-alkaline or transitiona l 

tholeiitic to calc-alkaline rocks. This VMS type contains, in average, higher contents of Zn and Ag in 

comparison with all the other VMS types (Barrie and Hannington, 1999). 

The last type of VMS deposit is the “bimodal-silic ic lastic” which has equivalent proportions of volcanic  

rocks (usually felsic rocks are much more abundant than mafic) and siliciclastic rocks. These deposits  

are usually found in belts of Phanerozoic age (like the Iberian Pyrite Belt, Portugal and Spain). Some 

authors refer that the felsic volcanic hosting rocks are generally calc-alkaline; however, this 

compositional feature is usually due to crustal assimilation and that is consistent with continental arc or 

rifted continental arc settings. Tholeiitic basalts are the common mafic rocks in this type of VMS deposit, 

however there are exceptions like in the Iberian Pyrite Belt where alkaline basalts are found in higher 

levels of the stratigraphic sequence. The “bimodal-silicic lastic” VMS deposits have the lowest contents 

in Cu and the highest in Pb, but are the largest in size in comparison with all the remaining VMS types 

(Barrie and Hannington, 1999).

2.2.1 Ophiolite-Hosted Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits 

Ophiolite-hosted VMS deposits are “mafic type” deposits, also commonly referred as Cyprus type, 

normally displaying a shape similar to those modern analogues found in massive sulphide mounds. They 

often display an elongated shape instead of equidimensional, reflecting the strong structural control set 

by fault zones in hydrothermal-mineralising venting. The footwall contact has usually a concave shape, 

while the hanging wall is flat, outlining a long-term exposure on the seafloor that tends to flatten the 

upper surface of the massive sulphide deposit. The massive sulphide lens formed along half grabens or 

adjoining listric fault zones are usually thicker in one flank and thinner towards their width. The lens  

comprises breccia and pyrite sands, covered by Fe-rich oxidized sediments (ochres) (Galley &amp;amp; Koski, 

1997).  

The root of most of massive sulphide deposits goes tens of meters below the paleo seafloor where a 

discrete stockwork cuts the basaltic host rock and promotes the long-lived flow of hydrothermal(-

mineralising) fluids responsible for the observed alteration halo (chlorite-quartz-pyrite). The sulphide  

stockwork is composed of small and irregular, anastomosed veins/veinlets in a chlorite -quartz 

groundmass (lower part) but, below the massive sulphide lens, the veins increase in size giving rise to 

in situ breccias. Recurrent rejuvenation of permeability, due to cyclic build-up of fluid pressure, 

promotes the development of spaces than can be filled with sulphides, forming small massive sulphide  

lenses. In the upper stockwork, basalts are silicified whereas at the base of some ore lenses sulphide-

quartz breccias may develop (Galley &amp;amp; Koski, 1999). 

There is a gradual contact (several meters) between the stratiform massive sulphide lens and the top of 

the stockwork, where the veins coalesce to form the massive sulphide lens leaving altered basalt 

fragments isolated and almost indistinct towards the core of the lens. Those orebodies are normally 

massive, made up of fine-grained granoblastic to idiomorphic pyrite, with abundant vuggy cavities line d 

by idiomorphic pyrite. Veins of colloform to sandy sulphides cut the massive sulphide that appears more 

brecciated upwards. The blocks (cemented by “sandy” sulphide) are normally colloform banded 

sulphide; however, some blocks of chalcopyrite aggregates are present in a matrix of pyrite and quartz. 

These blocks might correspond to fragments of high temperature sulphide chimneys; some worm 

burrows (tube-worms) were identified indicating that some of the breccias might correspond to sulphide  

chimneys. The sulphide lenses become less consolidated towards the top and are commonly covered by 

layered Fe oxides sediments (ochres) composed of goethite, natro-jarosite, jarosite, hematite, maghemite  

and magnetite; these sediments may include some interlayered graded beds of “detrital” sulphide and 

tend to be confined to direct contact with the massive sulphide lenses whereas jaspers (commonly 

radiolarian-bearing) are not so restrict. The jaspers are thought to be formed from pelagic and 

hydrothermal chemical-sediments while ochres from in situ weathering of the underlying sulphide , 

although some authors suggest that this type of Fe-oxide deposits are formed from subaerial weathering 

(Galley &amp;amp; Koski, 1999). 

Pyrite is the main sulphide mineral in this type of ores, being chalcopyrite and sphalerite the second 

most abundant sulphide minerals. These deposits can also include marcasite, cubanite, covellite, bornite , 

digenite, chalcocite, galena, pyrrhotite, idaite, bravoite, carollite, and mackinawite, with minor amounts  

of magnetite and hematite. The most common gangue components are quartz and gypsum. Referring to 

the ochre caps, these include goethite, jarosite, amorphous oxides, hematite and rare native gold. The 

veining system of the stockwork consists mainly of pyrite and quartz-pyrite, being the pyrite present in 

disseminations throughout the chloritized and silicified host lavas; it is in these silicified zones that the 

chalcopyrite veins are mostly concentrated. Pyrite in pyrite veins are commonly fine-graine d 

granoblastic to idiomorphic (with small amounts of chalcopyrite and sphalerite forming inclusions and 

fracture infillings) while in quartz-pyrite veins, the sulphide is usually corroded and replaced by quartz

and/or chalcedonic silica, being the latter more common at the top of the stockwork. In general, the 

mineral assemblage forming the base of the lens is pyrite-silica breccia, where pyrite and chalcopyrite  

are surrounded and partially replaced by silica. On top, a massive pyrite facies of fine -graine d 

(idiomorphic to subhedral) pyrite; this pyrite is commonly zoned, with inclusions of pyrrhotite , 

chalcopyrite, magnetite, cubanite and Fe-rich sphalerite (Galley &amp;amp; Koski, 1999). Colloform banded 

veins commonly cut the base of the massive pyrite, although these colloform textures are more abundant 

in the breccia zone. The colloform veins and rims are composed of interlayered pyrite, marcasite, 

chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and quartz, where chalcopyrite veining increases towards the top of the lens. 

Covellite, chalcocite and digenite are secondary copper minerals and are mostly present below the Fe 

oxide ochre cap, although they can be found in the entire orebody replacing chalcopyrite (Galley &amp;amp; 

Koski, 1999). 

2.2.2 VMS Deposits in Oman 

Volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits are mostly found in the northern part of the Oman Mountains , 

within the volcanic lavas sequence. Early evidence of mining is from the Bronze Age and Islam rise, 

mostly focused on secondary copper minerals found below strongly oxidised (superficial) caps (Lippard 

et al., 1986). Lasail, Bayda and Aarja in the Sohar district were the first mines where primary 

chalcopyrite-bearing massive sulphides were exploited between 1983 and 1993; Lasail was the largest 

deposit, producing 9.2 Mt of ore at 1.42 wt% copper. From 1994 to 2005, the iron-hats of Yanqul were 

mined for gold, but since 2000 many important discoveries have been made, and Hatta, Shinas, Safwa 

and Mandoos were mined by Mawarid Mining L.L.C. 

 

Fig 2. 6 – Simplified geological map displaying the location of a large number of deposits within the volcanic units 

represented as in figure 2.1. 

The 50 Mt total tonnage of the Sumail deposits are not comparable with other VMS districts around the 

world (Franklin et al., 2005) but is in the same range indicated for the Troodos ophiolite VMS deposits.

12 
 

The Geotimes/Lasail contact and to a lesser extent the Geotimes/Alley contact were thought to be the 

main ore horizons, corresponding to the paleo-seafloor where the sulphide mounds were formed; 

however, some of the later discoveries do not fit this simplified model of occurrence (Gilgen et al, 2014).   

2.2.3 The Mandoos Deposit  

There are no published data about the Mandoos 1 deposit, and the following information was gathered 

from a Mawarid Mining unpublished report. The Mandoos area (Fig 2.7), more specifically the Mandoos  

1 deposit area, is covered by unconsolidated wadi gravels (8 to 34 m) and there are no signs of volcanic  

rocks exposures; they only occur 2 km along strike to the north and south, and indications provided by 

the regional geological mapping show that the volcanic sequence dips to the east. The Mandoos 1 ores 

occur intra-Lasail or Alley volcanic units, although the relatively high magnetisation of the host rock 

favours the latter unit. Such differences in magnetic properties of the two volcanic units derive from the 

relative amount of igneous iron-oxides in the lavas, thus providing characteristic magnetic signals. The 

geology of the deposit was inferred from drill-holes and logging, showing that the massive sulphide in 

the Mandoos 1 prospect spreads over 60 m thick in the northern part, which is interpreted as an evidence 

of a topographic-low or an asymmetric-graben infilling; a strong structural control of ore deposition and 

accumulation is suggested due to the significant thickness decrease of the lens towards north, east and 

west.  

 

Fig 2. 7 – Location of Mandoos 1 open pit (ArcGIS). 

The massive sulphide lens (Fig 2.8) is hosted in massive basaltic lavas with some minor pillow lavas 

occurring on its footwall. The contact of the massive sulphides and the upper lavas is traced by a red-

brown umber layer. A gossanous zone is also present where the lens was exposed to weathering, mostly 

in the transition from the mineralised volcanic rock and the unconsolidated wadi gravels. 

As in most of the ophiolite-hosted deposits, pyrite is the dominant sulphide in Mandoos 1 deposit, with 

minor chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Chalcopyrite normally concentrates in the upper levels of the mas sive 

sulphide lens, and the higher copper grades together with some anomalous contents of Au, Ag and Zn 

outline the transition zone towards the iron-hat cover, strongly suggesting the progression of late 

(supergene?) enrichment processes. In the footwall of the lens there is a clay-silica-pyrite alteration 

zone, which appears to be more extensive towards the north and west and thin towards the south. The 

ore in this deposit can be subdivided in three types: (i) the massive sulphide zone that comprises more 

than 90% pyrite and late-formed chalcopyrite; (ii) the silica massive sulphide zone that occurs only in 

short (and discontinuous) intersections; and (iii) the stockwork hosted in a silica-clay altered basalt 

placed below the central part of the lens and showing a pyrite-quartz-jasper association, usually poor in 

copper. 

Many different diachronic alteration events are recorded. Hematite-rich alteration is preserved in basalts 

showing also evidence of carbonate alteration as veinlet infillings preceding the main mineralising event. 

As referred before, the transition zone between the massive sulphide lens and the gossan cover is where 

the higher grades of copper are found; that enrichment is mostly due to the alteration of chalcopyrite to 

chalcocite, bornite and covellite. Synchronous with the massive sulphide formation a chlorite (+quartz) 

alteration occurs and is best seen along the “chilled margins” in pillow lavas.

Mining, 2014).

3. Methodology 
 

3.1 Sampling 

The sampling survey comprised two different phases. The first one took place throughout the east-wall 

of the Mandoos Mine open pit, granted to the Mawarid Mining Company; the second phase involve d 

six drill-cores provided by the same company, after their previous re-logging. 

The sample labelling distinguishes the survey phase. Samples from the open pit were labelled with MD, 

initials for Mandoos, followed by the profile reference (P1, P2, P3 and P4) and sample number. Labels 

of drill-core samples comprise the original reference given to drill holes and the depth where the sample 

was collected, besides the MD initials. 

The first sampling phase was performed by Dr. Ana Jesus in May 2015 and includes samples from the 

massive sulphide orebody and metalliferous sediments. This discrete sampling programme along the 

east-wall of the open pit (from the central part of the deposit towards south) allowed collecting 24 

specimens (Appendix I). 

 

Fig 3. 1 – First sampling survey along the open pit east wall, illustrating the location of the 4 sampled profiles and some 

other collected samples.

16 
 

The second phase of the sampling survey was performed in March, 2016. The selected six drill holes  

are not restricted to the ore body exposed in open pit, and embrace outskirt domains of the mineralise d 

area as illustrated in Figure 3.2. According to the available data, cores from drill hole MD174 should 

represent the north-western part of the ore body, while those from MD150 and MD178 should 

characterise its central domain; samples from MD429, MD430 and MD431 drill holes represent the 

south-estern part of the deposit, outside the open pit. The sampling programme wa s targeted to 

intersected segments of the ore lens, embracing cores of massive sulphide segments, mineralised jaspers 

and metalliferous sediments (umbers and ochres). Due to the poor core preservation, the spatial 

representativeness of sampling might be compromised in certain parts of the section; indeed, the 

majority of ore segments in drill holes display evidence of significant crumbling and/or variable  

mingling, or show effects of strong weathering, being covered by sulphate crusts of irregular thickness . 

The best approach was to collect all the well-preserved and less-altered specimens throughout the six 

drill cores, totalling 18 samples and resulting in a combined collection of 42 samples: 27 of massive 

sulphides, 6 of mineralised jaspers, 5 of metalliferous sediments and 4 of a mineralised silicified basalt.

cross section. shown in Fig 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6. 



3. Methodologies 

 

17 
 

3.2 Sample Preparation 

Sample preparation took place between May and September, 2016, using the facilities available at the 

Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL). The 

first steps of sample preparation were made in SQU due to the impossibility to e xport rock samples out 

of Oman. 

3.2.1 Thin and Polished Sections Preparation 

A large number of polished thin sections and mounts were made, according the usual procedures, as 

follows: 

a) The samples were cut with a diamond saw considering the surface chosen for further 

petrographic analysis; the slabs should get the size to fit the glass for thin sections, or to fit the 

mounts cup. 

b) Mount samples were placed into cups, further filled with epoxy resin and then placed into a 

vacuum chamber hoven for resin settling. 

c) To prepare thin sections, the slabs were glued onto unpolished glasses; slab surfaces were 

previously flattened in an automatic plate using 600 mesh silicon carbide powder. After being 

glued, the samples rested in a heated press for resin settling. 

d) All the thin section samples were trimmed with a diamond precision saw, and only about 0.5mm 

thick of rock was left glued on the glass. 

e) The lapping is one of the critical steps to get good results before polishing, and this process 

differs for thin sections or mounts. For thin sections the mechanism is completely automatic but 

the good results will depend on the good calibration of the machine. The samples were placed 

on a jig and the lapping was done in a plate using 600 mesh silicon carbide powder until the 

thickness of a bit more than 30 ?m was reached. The lapping of the mounts was completely 

handmade, involving a sequence of steps to decrease the grid size and to get the best surface to 

polish. It started with a 220 mesh diamond plate followed by the 600 mesh diamond plate. After 

the diamond plate the samples were lapped on a glass surface using silicon carbide powder, 

starting with 800, then 1000 and finally 1200 mesh.  

f) The other critical step is the polishing; it was done automatically but, like the lapping, a precise 

calibration was critical for good results. Both sample types, thin sections and mounts, were 

polished using the same method. They were polished using a cloth plate impregnated with 

diamond paste and lubricant. A series of different grain size diamond paste were used, starting 
with 14 ?m (only for thin sections), 6 ?m, 3 ?m and finishing with 1 ?m. 

3.2.2 Powders for Whole-rock Multi-element Analysis 

All the samples selected for whole-rock geochemistry were identically processed following the common 

approach; i.e.: 

a) The samples were cut in thin slabs using a diamond saw. 

b) The surfaces of all slabs were smoothed with emery to remove traces of ink, weathering and 

contamination from the saw blade. 

c) The size reduction of slabs was made by hammering the samples wrapped in white paper, to 

avoid contact with the hammer and the metal base. 

d) When necessary, a Cr-hardened steel roll mill was used for size reduction of samples; this step 

was only used when hammering was not enough to reduce the sample to the desired size. 

e) Powdering of all samples using an agate ring mill anytime the sample weight was between 100 

and 120 gr; when that weight of sample was not achieved, a smaller agate ball mill was used 
instead.

The rock powders obtained through this process were also used to produce pressed-powder pellets for 

XRF. 

3.3 Analytical Procedures and Conditions 

3.3.1 XRD 

XRD analyses were performed in some samples to complement petrography whenever microscopy did  

not allow to clearly identify some mineral phases. The samples (a fine powder) were prepared at SQU 

facilities and placed on a spinning single-crystal silicon sample holder. The XRD record, measured at a 

step size of 0.0167° (2?), was acquired with a X' Pert PRO X-ray Diffraction machine from Panalytical 

that used a Cu-K? radiation (1.54060 Å) and was set to 40 mA and 45 kV. The data was further assessed 

with the “High Score Plus” software.  

 

3.3.2 Portable EDXRF  

During re-logging and sampling, a portable XRF was used at SQU facilities, as an auxiliary tool during 

macroscopic sample characterisation. A Niton XL3t 950 Handheld XRF Analyzer (Thermo Scientific ), 

calibrated with laboratory test standards and equipped with a SDD GOLDD+ detector and a Ag anode 

X-ray tube (excitation voltage 50 kV, 200 mA, 2 Watt), was used in such approach. The instrument self-

calibrates on an internal standard whenever the machine is switched on. No sample preparation is  

required since the beam is shot directly onto the sample area to be analysed.   

        

3.3.3 Whole Rock WDXRF  

One alternative to get WDXRF data consists of prepare in advance powdered samples with a flat surface. 

The preparation of pressed-powder pellets involved the following steps: 

a) One pellet requires 12 g of rock powder, being that the average weight measured for all samples.  
b) In a mortar, the sample was mixed with a mixture of acetone and elvacite (polymer), carefully 

mixed until reaching total homogenisation. 
c) The sample holder was placed in a press, and the sample placed in the holder with a tube and a 

cylinder to slightly press it. 
d) A perfect flat lid is placed onto the sample and pressure is slowly applied, allowing time for the 

volatiles to escape and the polymer to settle. This procedure is done twice after carefully rotating 
the sample holder for another position. 

All measurements were carried at the Aveiro University facilities using an Axios equipment from 
Panalytical with a rhodium ampoule. The analytical error for major elements is 2% of the measured 

value, while minor and trace elements detection limits are available  in Appendix II. 

3.3.4 Whole Rock ICP-MS 

The acquisition of minor and trace elements took place at the Géosciences Environnement Toulous e  

laboratory (Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées), Université of Toulouse III, via HR-ICP-MS ELEMENT XR 

and using the procedure described by Barrat et al. (2007). A HF-HClO4 digestion (Yokoyama et al., 

1999) with Tm addition (Barrat et al., 1996) was used to prepare the samples. After the acid digestion, 

the samples were diluted and analysed to obtain all minor and trace element concentrations. Analytica l 

blanks were subtracted to BHVO2 and samples cps; so, if the blank is higher than the signal, the 

calculated concentration is negative and cancelled. Instrumental detection limits, analytical and total 

procedural blanks can be consulted in Appendix III. 

 



3. Methodologies

3.3.5 Electron Probe Micro Analysis 

All mineral chemistry analyses were produced on polished mounts covered by a thin carbon coating (20 

nm) at FCUL facilities. The instrument used in this stage was a JEOL-JXA 8200 Micro Probe, equipped 

with four wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS), six analysing crystals (LIF, LIFH, PET, PETH, 

TAP and LDED2) and secondary and retro-diffused electron detectors coupled to an energy-dispersive 

spectrometer (EDS). The measurements were performed with a 5 µm diameter beam, a 25 nA current 

and an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In routine, the acquisition time for peaks was 20 s and 5 s for 

background radiation. The standards used and the detection limits for all measured elements are listed 

in Appendix IV and Appendix V, respectively.

4. Model for the Mandoos 1 Deposit 

4.1 The Tridimensional Modelling of Mandoos 1 Deposit 

The 3D model of the Mandoos 1 deposit was built using the data provided by Mawarid Mining and the 

MICROMINE software. The starting database includes data from 33 drill-holes (see figure 3.2): 29 

along the pit zone, one located 1 km north from the pit, and the last three placed 250 m SE from the pit 

(the last drill-holes were performed during one of the latest exploration surveys done by the company). 

The 29 drill-holes are distributed in a regular 50 m x 50 m square grid.  

The data were organised in collar, survey, assay and lithology. Collar data includes geographica l 

coordinates, altitude and drill-hole length (DHL), besides the bore-hole ID (BHID). Survey data includes 

depth, azimuth and dip values. Assay data comprise concentration values of Cu, Zn and Fe in weight 

percentage (wt%) and Au and Ag in parts per million (ppm) linked to a particular depth. The lithology 

data includes the depth where a given lithology intersected by drill-hole starts and ends, and the 

lithological information. The Mawarid Mining also provided STRING files containing the pit design 

and sections of the ore-body. 

This complete database is essential to build the 3D model, and its organisation is a key factor to easily 

insert the data on MICROMINE. Collar and survey data will allow placing the drill-holes, while assay 

and lithology data will let assigning grades and lithology along them. The STRING file for the pit design 

was used to model the shape of the pit and site; a digital landscape model (DTM) was created from the 

pit design file in addition with a geo-referenced image of the site extracted from Google Earth. In 

addition, the STRING file with the sections of the ore-body allowed to locating the orebody using not 

only the information gathered from the 33 drill-holes, but also from all the drills done by the company 

in the Mandoos 1 deposit.

Figure 4.1 illustrates the N-S aligned pit, with 620 m length and 390 m width; its depth increases towards 

south where it reaches 160 m, 60 m more than the deepest part of the north sector. The massive sulphide 

body has 550 m long and up to 370 wide; the average width is around 200 m. The massive sulphide lens  

varies in thickness from less than 1 m to a maximum of 90 m recorded in the northern sector of the 

deposit. The lens shows also a general NW-SE elongation dipping moderately towards SE. 

4.1 Grades and Tonnage 

Using the implicit modelling tool from MICROMINE, which uses simple kriging as the interpolation 

method, it was possible to model the Cu and Zn grades in the orebody. The buffer used in the 

interpolation was 75 m, i.e.1.5 x the spacing between drills (50 m). Also, a colour code was given to the 

elements, red was used for Cu while blue was assigned to Zn. A colour grading, from light to dark 

colours, represents lower and higher grades. The limits used to define the cut-off grade for the colour 

coding were the minimum, first quartile, median and third quartile; however all analyses below the mine  

cut-off grade (0.3 wt% Cu) were previously excluded. 

Fig 4.3 displays Cu and Zn grades distribution along the deposit, respectively; image (A) in both figures  

represents the higher grades with a cut-off defined by the third quartile of the concentration distributions , 

i.e. 2.44 wt% for Cu and 0.44 wt% for Zn. It is worth noting that the south sector is the most enriched 

in these elements, more precisely in section 2732850mN (drill-hole MD150 – Fig 3.2) where the two 

elements are largely overlapped, suggesting the lacking of significant metal zonation. The central sector 

of the deposit also shows Cu- and Zn-enriched zones (Section 2733000mN – Fig 3.2), but in this case 

an evident separation exists: a Cu-rich zone (MD071) to the east and a Zn-rich zone to the west 

(MD020). Along the two drill-holes that crosscut these two distinct zones there is no firm evidence for 

metal zonation, as can be seen in the sections in Appendix VI. The same can also be inferred from the 

NW-SE cross section along the lens alignment (see Fig 3.2), Fig 4.4 and Fig 4.5 show the Cu and Zn 

variations, respectively, along the ore body. As can be seen, the overlapping of Cu-rich and Zn-rich 

zones is recorded all over the entire lens. It is also clear that the north sector of the deposit is where the 

highest thickness of the ore-body is observed (Fig 4.6); however, this thick accumulation of sulphide s  

do not display the highest grades. Due to the ore lens morphology and some evidence for NW-SE (to 

N-S?) fault zones, this thicker domain of the ore-body is interpreted as a hemi-graben filled with massive 

sulphides (Fig. 4.2).

displacements consistent with a hemi-graben morphology.

 4. Model for the Mandoos 1 Deposit 

 

25 

 

The Mawarid’s engineers assessed in Mandoos 1 a total resource of about 8 Mt of Cu-rich massive 

sulphide ore (mine cut-off grade = 0.3 wt% Cu), including ca. 5 Mt in reserves with 1.8 wt% Cu 

(Mawarid Mining, 2014; Rob Willis, pers. com. to Ana Jesus, February, 2015). The orebody (Fig 4.6) 

volume calculation revealed a total value of 1.8 M m3. Assuming a typical composition of about 80% 

pyrite, 12% quartz, 5% chalcopyrite and 2% of sphalerite, and knowing that the respective densities are 

4.8 g/cm3, 2.65 g/cm3, 4.1 g/cm3 and 3.9 g/cm3, the massive sulphide lens comes out with an average 

density of 4.44 g/cm3 and total tonnage of 7.99 Mt. The average grade of 1.8 wt% Cu reported by the 

company is also obtained by a simple mean calculation of all Cu values above the mine cut-off grade; 

however when weighted, the average grade drops to 1.72 wt% Cu.

5. Petrography 
The present section of the work summarises the main mineralogical and textural features displayed by 

sulphide ores (including mineralised basalts), metalliferous sediments (umber and ochres) and jaspers 

(massive sulphide mineralised jaspers and manganese jasper) at microscale, using reflected and 

transmitted light microscopy. Complementary EPMA information and additional macroscopic (hand 

sample) evidence will also be locally included. 

5.1 Sulphide Ores 

Samples of massive sulphides s.s. are not common in this deposit. Actually, throughout all the sampling 

survey there was no evidence of real massive sulphides; the ores normally occur as heterometric breccias 

(Fig. 5.1).  Texturally, these breccias are quite regular, with the exception of some cases comprising 

fragments that display wider textural diversity. The presence of pyritised (transversal and longitudina l) 

cross-sections of tubeworms (polychetae) is worth noting (Fig. 5.2 – 1, 2), placing the examined samples 

in the black-smokers environment (MD-P2-3-2). A large number of samples consist of poorly calibrated 

breccias mainly composed of pyrite clasts (Fig. 5.1). Their formation is possibly a result of successive 

mass-wasting events occurring at the sea-mounds. The clasts can vary from small, single, fractured, 

(sub)euhedral grains to large fragments of massive aggregates. These can differ in composition or in 

texture, pyrite being the most common example. 

Samples from “massive sulphide ores” show a monotonous mineral assemblage, comprising a small 

number of different mineral phases. They are mainly composed of re crystallised pyrite, having 

chalcopyrite, marcasite and sphalerite as common accessory minerals; Cu-rich phases are also present 

in some samples and quartz, laumontite and phyllosilicates are the usual gangue-forming phases. 

Primary textures are common among the clasts: round to long colloform clasts (Fig. 5.2 - 4, 5, 6, 7) and 

framboidal masses (Fig. 5.3 – 3) are seen throughout the breccias, usually associated with chalcopyrite , 

occurring as replacements of former pyrite grains. Often recrystallised, the cores of pyrite aggregates 

also preserve primary textures such as framboidal and colloform; wherever these clasts do not show 

preserved primary textures, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the re crystallised and a second 

generation of pyrite.  All these structures appear to be replaced or filled by chalcopyrite ± bornite ± Cu-

rich phases; usually, the alteration starts at the crystal borders and creates a Cu-rich ramification 

structure that sometimes partly obliterates all the primary texture (Fig. 5.3 – 7). Clasts, presumably 

related to hydraulic brecciation, are also frequent and these can vary in size, but normally are coarse-

sized clasts composed mostly of recrystallised pyrite, crisscrossed by a network of late quartz-veins 

showing a jigsaw fit texture, being the surroundings of the veins more recrystallised. 

Pyrite clasts (varying from euhedral crystals to large masses) are typical, but marcasite, chalcopyrite and 

sphalerite clasts can also be seen. Pyrite shows distinct occurrence modes, being the most common as 

euhedral recrystallised masses where a growth zonation (or banding) is evident, usually decorated by 

small inclusions of sphalerite (Fig. 5.2 – 8) and rarely by chalcopyrite inclusions. The growth zonation 

is often traced by alternation between well-recrystallised pyrite and porous pyrite. In some samples, 

euhedral pyrite displays vuggy arrangements. Marcasite can be seen more rarely as coarse euhedral grain 

masses (Fig. 5.3 – 2), displaying colloform textures and more often as masses (usually surrounded by 

pyrite) partly replaced by chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite occurs as large masses, being replaced by bornite  

and other Cu-rich phases, and as clear masses/crystals with sphalerite inclusions. 

Some samples show a platy chalcopyrite in quartz and phyllosilicates veins and it can also be observed 

in crack-infillings affecting pyrite. Usually the cement of these breccias comprise quartz and

28 

 

phyllossilicates, or a mixture of quartz and small pyrite grains (“pyrite sands”); nevertheless laumontite  

also occurs, often as an accessory phase in the cement and as part of the mineral infillings of open spaces 

in large masses of pyrite and chalcopyrite. 

The sample MD-P3-4-1 is an exception, displaying a carbonate cement. Similarly, the sample MD-NP-

1 is characterised by a particular texture, where large sphalerite masses containing numerous oriented 

chalcopyrite (triangular) inclusions can be interpreted as a primary texture (Fig. 5.3 - 5), by analogy to 

what is commonly displayed by black-smokers. The sphalerite masses are inter-grown/filled with 

laumontite and is locally replaced by bornite, as happens with co-existent chalcopyrite. The Zn-rich 

zone contacts with a Cu-rich zone, where some sphalerite can be seen replaced by chalcopyrite (?). In 

these samples, some of the chalcopyrite masses are also inter-grown with laumontite; these late infillings  

also contain pyrite, marcasite and fine-grained sphalerite. The MD-NP-1 sample also includes skeletal 

wurtzite (paramorphic sphalerite) infilled/altered by iron sulphides taking advantage of the space 

between crystals. Platy crystals of wurtzite forming well-developed elongated prismatic aggregates 

crystallised in open spaces (infilled with laumontite) can also be locally observed (Fig. 5.3 – 4).

5.2 Silicified Mineralised Basalt  

The silicified basalts display abundant disseminations of fine-grained euhedral to sub-euhedral pyrite  

(Fig. 5.4 – 1, 2). Mineralised veins are seen crosscutting the basalts. Adjoining their walls, pyrite  

dissemination is more intense and coarser-grained, whereas minor amounts of chalcopyrite can also be 

present. The infillings of these veins include a mineral assemblage composed of coarse -grained euhedral 

pyrite crystals encased by large masses of chalcopyrite with scarce sphalerite inclusions  (Fig. 5.4 – 3). 

Sphalerite is seen as inclusions in both pyrite and chalcopyrite; this sphalerite can show effects of 

“chalcopyrite disease” and is characterised by low Fe-contents. Some late-deposited quartz and 

phyllosilicate rich vein infillings (? poorly polished surface mineral) crosscut chalcopyrite masses; these 

also carry some pyrite and sphalerite. A second generation of sphalerite is characterised by lighte r 

internal reflections, indicating lower Fe-contents (presumably developed under lower temperature 

conditions); the zinc was possibly released during the sphalerite replacement by chalcopyrite and lately 

incorporated in the quartz rich veins.

5.3 Metalliferous Sediments 

Three texturally different types of metalliferous sediments were examined. The first one shows a clear 

sedimentary texture composed of a rhythmic fine-grained banding of Fe-oxide poor to Fe-oxide enriched 

sediments (Fig. 5.5 F), the latter being more abundant and thicker. In these layers, the Fe-oxide grains  

tend to develop clusters with ellipsoidal shapes (Fig. 5.6 – 2) whose minor axes are sub-perpendicula r 

to the layering (indicating some compression, conceivably related to sedimentation and diagenesis  

processes). The sample also displays two different types of carbonate veins, one perpendicular to the 

layering, with no evidence of mineralization, and a later set of veins showing comb-texture (Fig. 5.6 – 

1) with accessory amounts of sulphides (chalcopyrite and Cu-rich phases? in Fig. 5.6 - 7). There is no 

other evidence of sulphide minerals or clasts. Sample (MD178-134.20) also shows a sedimentary 

texture, but in this case the alternation of layers is between Fe-oxide rich (jasper like) and sulphide-ric h 

sediments (Fig. 5.5 E), the latter mainly composed of pyrite and chalcopyrite but also containing small 

amounts of sphalerite and covellite. 

Pyrite occurs in different textural arrangements, mostly forming fine-grained masses (resulting in a 

“dirty-looking” polished surface), but it can occur as well as sub-euhedral grains of variable size  

(resulting in a “clean” polished surface). The massive pyrite borders sometimes show some 

recrystallisation (?) and these massive aggregates may preserve some colloform texture s. As previously 

referred, ochre sediments may include some interlayered graded beds of “detrital” sulphide s and tend to 

be confined to the contact with the massive sulphide lenses, as observed in this sample. A clear contact 

between massive sulphides and the layered Fe-rich sediment with sulphide rich intercalations also shows 

a sphalerite infilling (vein/space??); it is characterised by very fine intergrowths of sub-euhedral 

sphalerite grains, quartz(?) and some covellite. The third type (MD174-62.15) shows a completely 

different texture: a coarse-grained breccia impregnated and cemented by Fe-oxides and criptocrystalline  

silica (Fig. 5.5 C); the clasts are also replaced by Fe-(hydr)oxides and hydroxides, mostly hematite and 

goethite. The observed texture is easily correlated with the massive sulphide breccias, where euhedral 

altered pyrite clasts (Fig. 5.6 – 6, 7), along with colloform (Fig. 5.6 – 8) and framboidal pyrite clasts, 

can still be recognized as pseudomorphs. Some sulphides are still preserved in few mineral cores, 

namely chalcopyrite being replaced by bornite and other Cu rich phases (Fig. 5.6 – 3, 4).

5.4 Jaspers  

The examined jaspers are always mineralised, as disseminations or vein infillings , particularly when in 
direct contact with massive sulphides. Disseminations of pyrite are common, developing aggregates of 
small anhedral grains and, most often, aggregates of euhedral crystals of variable size, possibly 
representing recrystallised grains (Fig. 5.7 – 1). An intermediate stage between these two occurrence 
modes is possibly represented by larger anhedral pyrite aggregates. Scarce chalcopyrite intergrowths  
with sphalerite displaying effects of “chalcopyrite disease” (secondary exsolution) are also disseminate d 
but mostly associated with the anhedral pyrite aggregates. This chalcopyrite is loc ally replaced by 
bornite and covellite, suggesting a less reducing environment. Both euhedral pyrite and the aggregates 
have sphalerite inclusions. Two different sphalerite inclusions can be seen: clear sphalerite (more 

common) and sphalerite with chalcopyrite segregations.  

It is also noticeable a grain size increase towards the massive sulphide veins; also, the grains become 
more euhedral. The veins show a Fe-leached rim and are composed of large euhedral to sub-euhedral 
crystals of pyrite encased in large masses of chalcopyrite, accompanied by quartz (Fig. 5.7 – 5, 6). Some 
pyrite grains show more “clean” and flat edges, contrasting with the core domains, which are more 
irregular, indicating the progression of recrystallisation processes. Chalcopyrite is usually seen filling 
cracks on the pyrite whereas there is evidence for scarce chalcopyrite inclusion in pyrite, mostly 
adjoining chalcopyrite masses. Besides the Fe-leached rims observed in the veins, other leached zones, 
with no evidence of iron oxides are also seen throughout the samples. These are characterised by larger 
pyrite crystals (Fig. 5.7 – 2) and anhedral aggregates with a breccia texture; some sphalerite and 
chalcopyrite is also observed in this zone. The jasper impregnation by sulphides is possible due to 
increasing porosity during leaching, leading also to the formation of veins and some collapse breccias  

(Fig. 5.7 – 3, 4), later silicified when the system temperature cools down. 

One sample (MD-NP-3) shows a completely different mineralogy, being composed of cryptocrystalline  
silica inter-grown with manganese oxides; the sample also shows large euhedral pyrolusite crystals 
(diamond shape) and late veins possibly sealed by romanechite (according to its optical properties). In 
the hand specimen it is evident the presence of jasper clasts within the manganese ore.

Sulphide phases forming the massive ores of Mandoos were the main focus of the work carried out using 

EPMA. Therefore, a comprehensive survey was prepared, covering different sulphides and textural 

arrangements, and resulting in 946 quantitative analyses distributed over 15 polished mounts previous ly 

examined under the reflected light microscope. The analytical dataset obtained include 310 analyses of 

pyrite, 262 of chalcopyrite, 181 of sphalerite, 111 of marcasite, 64 of various Cu-rich phases, 13 of 

bornite and 5 of galena (Appendix VII for detection limits and Appendix VIII for analyses). 

6.1 Iron Sulphide Phases 

Iron sulphides are by far the most abundant phases in the studied ore samples. Pyrite prevails and its  

composition is close to ideal FeS2, with median composition of Fe0.999S2 and iron content scattered in 

the 0.948-1.017 interval. Various elements are present in minor and trace amounts; the most significa nt 

are Cu, Zn and Pb, displaying highly asymmetric distributions typified by median values of 210 ppm, 

315 ppm, 180 ppm and contents up to 89780 ppm, 27890 ppm and 7070 ppm, respectively (Fig. 6.1). 

Also worth mentioning is the presence of non-negligible amounts of As, In, Se and Co, characterised by 

median values of 70 ppm, 70 ppm, 90 ppm and 200 ppm respectively. 

 
Fig 6. 1 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 310 analyses of pyrite 

(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Cu, Zn and Pb as minor elements. Traces of some other elements  

are noteworthy, namely As, In, Se and Co (and Au?).

Marcasite composition is also close to ideal, with Fe0.949-1.017 and median composition of Fe0.997S2. It 

displays minor/trace amounts of Cu, Zn and Pb (like pyrite), which may reach 3820 ppm, 9800 ppm and 

3850 ppm, respectively (Fig. 6.2); the median values of the concentration distributions for these 

elements are BDL or quite close to that value (highlighting the strong distribution asymmetry), being 

the third quartile equal to 1020 ppm, 320 ppm and 200 ppm respectively.  In addition, traces of Mn and 

Co are statistically meaningful, displaying median values of 70 ppm and 200 ppm, respectively. The last 

two elements are possibly accompanied by W, Te, In and Au, for which the calculated medians are BDL 

(third quartile = 428 ppm), 20 ppm, 60 ppm and 50 ppm. 

 
Fig 6. 2 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 111 analyses of marcasite 
(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Cu, Zn and Pb as minor elements (like pyrite). Traces of Mn 

and Co also with statistical meaning. 

When plotted in a ternary diagram (Fig. 6.3), both pyrite and marcasite show similar behaviour , 

notwithstanding the larger deviation displayed by pyrite analyses. The (S+As)–Fe–(Cu+In) diagram 

shows, as expected, a strong overlapping of the majority of samples in the FeS2 end-member field but 

with a clear trend of Cu enrichment, in this case towards the chalcopyrite composition. The same trend 

is shown in the (S+As)–(Zn+Cd+Co)–(Cu+In) diagram, but it also points out an enrichment, although 

less significant, in Zn revealed by the compositional departure towards the sphalerite composition.

Fig 6. 3 - Ternary  (S+As)–(Cu+In)–(Zn+Cd+Co)–Fe diagrams p utting in evidence comp ositional deviations towards Cu and 

Zn enrichment.  

The compositional trends of Cu and Zn enrichment are also seen when plotting bivariate diagrams for 

the most significant minor and trace elements. In Figs 6.4 and 6.5, the textural arrangements where the 

pyrite and marcasite analyses were obtained, are distinguished. Primary textures, such as framboidal and 

colloform, and recrystallised masses or euhedral grains were individua lised. Despite some analyses 

might be affected by crypto-exsolutions or crypto-inclusions (e.g. massive marcasite replaced by 

chalcopyrite – Fig 6.5), it is clear that Zn enrichments in pyrite or marcasite are mostly related to masses 

or individual grains; conversely, Cu enrichments are mainly observed in pyrite developing primary 

textures (markedly framboids); this Cu-enrichment trend is not so clear in colloform marcasite.

6.2 Cu Sulphide Phases 

From all the Cu phases, chalcopyrite is the most abundant in the examined ore samples. Its composition 

is close to FeCuS2, with Fe0.901-1.148 and Cu0.903-1.125; the estimated median composition for chalcopyrite  

in Mandoos 1 is Fe0.966Cu0.991S2.  

 
Fig 6. 7 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 262 analyses of chalcopyrite 
(concentration values in wt% ). Note the relative importance of Zn and Pb as trace elements. 

The Fig.6.7 shows the distribution for all elements in the analysed chalcopyrite grains/masses. Clearly, 

the most relevant  are the: (i) minor amounts of Zn, with median value of 920 ppm and maximum amount 

of 50290 ppm; and (ii) traces of Pb, Mo, In, Se and Co, displaying median values of 335 ppm, 335 ppm, 

60 ppm, 90 ppm and 100 ppm respectively. The incorporation of a variety of elements by chalcopyrite , 

and the existence of a great number of outliers, suggest that no compositional refinement is observed in 

this mineral phase, also indicating that the development of chalcopyrite could be interpreted as a 

decaying product of a previous Cu-rich phase and in “transition” to other phases. 

Bornite (Cu5FeS4) is also present, mostly replacing chalcopyrite. Its iron contents are less variable than 

those of copper (Fe0.988-1.065 and Cu4.710-4.946) and a median composition of Fe1.005Cu4.849S4 can be 

calculated on the basis of analyses compatible with the bornite stoichiometry. As in chalcopyrite, Zn 

and Pb are the most significant trace elements, with amounts ranging from 150 to 9060 ppm and up to 

1420 ppm, and median values of 1900 ppm and 880 ppm, respectively. The measured contents of Ag, 

Mo and In are also non-negligible, reaching up to 520 ppm, 550 ppm and 790 ppm, with median values  

of 150 ppm, 260 ppm and 130 ppm respectively (Fig 6.8).

Many other Cu-rich phases were analysed, optically undistinguishable under the current petrography.  

These were characterised and processed as a group of Cu-rich sulphides, separately from chalcopyrite 

and bornite. Variable in composition, these Cu-rich phases display copper contents from 22.359 to 

72.772 wt% (median = 53.250 wt%), and iron concentrations from 1.253 to 34.715 wt% (median = 

13.703 wt%); they also show significant amounts of Zn, up to 25 wt% (including an extreme outlie r), 

characterised by a median value of 4220 ppm. As can be seen in Fig 6.9, significant trace amounts of 

Pb, Ag, Mo and Te were measured, displaying median values of 565 ppm, 215 ppm, 335 ppm and 435 

ppm, respectively, and maximum concentrations  up to 2930 ppm, 1330 ppm, 770 ppm and 73480 ppm, 

following the very same order.

diagram, chalcopyrite samples

interpreted as a result of an 

evolutionary feature, starting 

near a fukuchilite-like  

composition (a high-

temperature sulphide of idea l 

composition Cu3FeS8) and 

progressing towards cubanite-

like (CuFe2S3) compositions , 

before reaching chalcopyrite  

(CuFeS2), followed by a 

clearly marked oxidation trend 

in the direction of bornite  

(Cu5FeS4) and spionkopite (Cu1.23S) and covellite (CuS) end-members.

6.3 Sphalerite 

Sphalerite [(Zn,Fe)S] is also common as an accessory mineral phase in the Mandoos 1 sulphide ores. Its 

calculated median composition is Zn0.952Fe0.021S and the distribution of zinc and iron ion contents 

confined to the following intervals: Zn0.576-0.999 and Fe0.002-0.210. Besides Fe, minor/trace amounts of Cu 

and Cd are meaningful, rising up to grades of 9.861 wt% and 0.673 wt%, respectively; concentration 

distributions of these elements are, however, asymmetrical, presenting medians of 2610 ppm and 2020 

ppm. Also asymmetrical are the distributions of some meaningful trace amounts, such as Pb, As, Se, 

Mn, Co, W and Te. These elements show maximum values up to 4960 ppm, 1770 ppm, 1020 ppm, 

41300 ppm, 1010 ppm, 2930 ppm and 1430, and their median contents are of 120 ppm, BDL, 50 ppm, 

110 ppm, 30 ppm, BDL and BDL respectively. The elements showing median values below detection 

limit are characterised by third quartile values of 140 ppm, 520 ppm and 145 ppm respectively. Mo also 

has significant trace amounts, but in opposition, it displays a quasi-normal distribution with median of 

560 ppm and amounts up to 1250 ppm (Fig 6.11). 

 
Fig 6. 11 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by 181 analyses of sphalerite 
(values in wt% ). Minor/trace amounts of Cu and Cd are significant, traces of some other elements are noteworthy, namely Pb, 

Mo and W, between others. 

Fig 6.12 shows a Fe versus Cd bivariant plot of all samples, distinguishing the textural arrangements 

where the chemical analyses for sphalerite were gathered. It is observed that sphalerites in Mandoos 1 

are relatively poor in Fe, and those samples displaying “chalcopyrite disease” features are characterised 

by higher amounts of Cd. Chemical analyses of wurtzite (distinguished from sphalerite under optica l 

microscopy, mostly due to its typical platy habit), sphalerite in masses showing triangular chalcopyrite  

intergrowths (“vent” texture), and sphalerite with fibrous texture or occurring in veins/fractures share 

similar compositional characteristics in this plot, i.e. low contents of Fe and Cd (Fe &amp;lt;1.5 wt%; Cd &amp;lt;0.4

wt%). Sphalerite forming massive/grain textural arrangements display two different trends, one towards 

Cd enrichment (with low contents of Fe) and another towards Fe enrichments, showing low amounts of 

Cd. The largest variation in Fe contents is recorded by sphalerite inclusions in pyrite, conceivably due 

to the “contamination” of the host mineral.

In the S+As – Fe – Cu – Zn+Cd+Co diagram it is observed that wurtzite, massive sphalerite with 

chalcopyrite intergrowth, veins and fibrous chalcopyrite are all plotted close to the S+As – Zn+Cd+Co 

axis, overlaying the sphalerite ideal composition and showing no significant variations towards Fe 

enrichments. The same happens when Cu is added; thus, all samples are clustered in the Zn – Cd – Co 

vertex.  However, a distinct trend towards a minor Fe enrichment is observed in sphalerite samples 

displaying “chalcopyrite disease” features, forming massive aggregates and developing inclusions in 

pyrite, being the first sphalerite type less Fe-enriched than the last two cases. These three different 

textural arrangements also display a slight enrichment in Cu along with some sphalerite in veins. 

6.4 Galena 

Galena (PbS) is the less represented sulphide in all the studied samples. Indeed, tiny grains of galena 

are present in some samples, but their reduced dimension does not always allow the ac hievement of 

acceptable quantitative chemical analyses. The available data point to Pb contents varying from 0.976 

and 1.005 atoms per formula unit, and a median composition of Pb0.976S. Although irregular, minor 

amounts of Zn, Cu, Sb and Fe are present (Fig 6.14). These can go up to 20550 ppm, 5030 ppm, 2700 

ppm and 3410 ppm, and display median amounts of 10770 ppm, 3810 ppm, 1130 ppm and 1170 ppm , 

respectively. The most significant trace amounts recorded are Sn, Se and Co; they are characterised by 

median values of 110 ppm, 100 ppm and 100 ppm and amounts that can reach 410 ppm, 690 ppm and 

380 ppm, respectively.

From the 42 samples collected during the sampling survey, 18 were chosen for minor and trace element 

analysis via ICP-MS in the Géosciences Environnement Toulouse laboratory (Observatoire Midi-

Pyrénées), Université of Toulouse III. The same samples were also analysed via XRF for major elements 

at the University of Aveiro facilities. The analysed set comprises samples from different types of 

massive sulphides (10), metalliferous sediments (6) and mineralised (sulphide-rich or Mn-rich) jaspers 

(2) (Appendix IX). Due to the limited number of samples, the correlation matrixes meanwhile calculated 

were not as discriminative as expected, although a simple descriptive statistical study for the minor and 

trace elements distributions was performed, and for major elements as well.  

7.1 Major Elements 

The major elements measured with XRF have concentration values consistent with the observations 

done during re-logging and petrography. Indeed, samples of the Mandoos massive sulphides are Fe-rich 

and Cu-Zn-poor ores, and their correspondent grades are scattered in the intervals 3.96-24.73 wt% 

(median = 18.99 wt% Fe), 0.12-2.45 wt% (median = 0.51 wt% Cu) and 0.01-29.12 wt% (median = 0.048 

wt% Zn) respectively, as can be seen in Fig 7.4. Silica contents are significant in these ores, rising up to 

13.87 wt% and having a median value of 11.02 wt% SiO2. These samples also contain Al and Ca, whose 

oxides display median concentration values of 0.097 wt% Al2O3and 0.024 wt% CaO and maximum 

contents of 5.46 wt% and 16.35 wt% respectively, following extremely asymmetric distributions .  

Sample MD-NP-1, a chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich ore sample, presents the highest Cu and Zn 

contents coupled with significant grades of SiO2, Al2O3 and CaO mostly due to the presence of quartz 

and laumontite (CaAl2Si4O12 · 4H2O). As reported before, the ore samples are mostly breccias whose 

cement is enriched in SiO2, and this fact explains the high-silica content displayed by most of the 

samples, excluding the specimens MD-P1-1-1 and MD-P3-4-1 which represent a massive pyrite 

accumulation and a breccia cemented by carbonates (thus displaying the highest content in CaO), 

respectively.

Fig 7. 1 – Major elements distribution in sulphide ores.  

Umbers (Fe- and Mn-rich sediments) and ochres (Fe-rich sediments) (Fleet &amp;amp; Robertson, 1980) are the 

two metalliferous sediment types analysed in this section. As shown in Fig 7.2 (a), the Fe and Mn 

contents are discriminative enough to separate both rock types (umbers and ochres). These contents have 

their values scattered between 26.52-54.73 wt% Fe and 0.2-1.78 wt% Mn respectively. Besides the 

expected high-silica content, these samples also show CaO concentrations between 1.02 wt% and 12.61 

wt% (median = 6.05 wt%). According to these results we may infer a set of 5 ochres and 1 umber 

(sample MD-178-110.5, with 1.78 wt% Mn). It is also possible to correlate the CaO contents with the 

presence of late carbonate veins, quite evident in sample MD-P2-2A, which is characterised by the 

highest contents of this oxide. Noteworthy is the Cu extreme outlier (maximum = 3.73 wt%) displaye d 

by the sample MD-178-134.20, corresponding to a mineralised (massive sulphide) mineralised ochre. 

Two different jasper samples were analysed, a mineralised sulphide-rich jasper (MD-150-114.10) and a 

manganese ore with jasper clasts (MD-NP-3); Fig 7.2 (b) shows clearly the discrepant composition of 

the two mineralised jasper samples, mostly in SiO2 and MnO. These element oxides have minimum 

values of 10.45 wt% and 0.01 wt% and maximum of 30.05 wt% and 47.19 wt% respectively, being the 

latter value representative of the manganese ore (mainly pyrolusite – Appendix X). Also, the presence 

of minor amounts of Ba in the Mn-rich jasper sample is conceivably due to the presence of romanechite 

((Ba,H2O)2(Mn)5O10) in the manganese ore.

7.2 Minor and Trace Elements 

As shown in Fig 7.3, minor amounts of V, Mn, Co, As and Pb can be found in massive sulphide samples, 

which display contents up to 67.15 ppm, 1887 ppm, 422.58 ppm, 1024 ppm and 219.97 ppm, 

respectively; for these elements, the median concentration values are of 43.74 ppm, 140.56 ppm, 37.78 

ppm, 292.90 ppm, 53.27 ppm, by the same order. Also traces of Mo, Sn, Sb and Te are found in ore 

samples whose distributions are characterised by median values of 8.08 ppm, 6.07 ppm, 6.35 ppm and 

12.46 ppm, respectively. 

 
Fig 7. 3 - Box and whiskers plot for the multi-element concentration distributions displayed by massive sulphides (concentratio n  

values in ppm). 

The same set of minor elements is also found in metalliferous sediments, with the exception of Co and 

Pb, just with trace amounts. Other relevant elements found in metalliferous sediments and measured as 

traces are Cr, Ni and Sr (Fig 7.4); their correspondent grades are scattered within the 15.64-95.17 ppm, 

35.1-185.4 ppm and 36.21-117.13 ppm intervals, respectively.  

Despite having a restrict number of samples, whole-rock analyses of mineralised jaspers show strong 

consistency with the previous samples, displaying minor amounts of V, Co, Ni, As, Sr, Mo and Ba and 

some traces of Ga, Te and Pb (Fig 7.5). The median values of 217 ppm, 67.61 ppm, 88.8 ppm, 287.62 

ppm, 224.86 ppm, 165.55 ppm and 372 ppm typify the concentration distributions of the aforementioned 

minor elements.  

To date there were no data available for minor and trace elements in samples representing the Sumail 

ophiolite massive sulphides, being this exploratory work a further step in the characterisation of these 

ores.

7.3 REE 

The measured REE contents were normalised to C1 Chondrite (Palme &amp;amp; Jones, 2004) allowing direct 

comparison of patterns displayed by each set of samples (sulphide ores, metalliferous sediments and 

jaspers). In this approach, the relative enrichment and depletion of Eu and Ce were evaluated according 

to the Eu/Eu* and Ce/Ce* ratios defined as (McLennan, 1989): ?????* = ????(??? ? ???)0,5 and ?????? 

= 5????(4??? + ???). 

All the samples representing sulphide ores (Fig 7.6A) are depleted in REE, as expected; their normalise d 

patterns are regular, revealing a feeble, almost imperceptible, enrichment in HREE, along with a positive  

anomaly in Eu (Eu*= 1.15 to 1.84) and a slight negative anomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.41 to 0.91). The sample 

MD-P3-4-1 represents a massive sulphide breccia cemented by carbonates and is the most REE enriched 

(?1 to 2× C1) specimen of the entire set. This is possibly related to the incorporation of REE in 

carbonates. As seen in Fig 7.6, the REE normalised pattern characterising the sulphide ores can be 

explained by a mixture of vent fluids and seawater; with this simple mixture it is possible to obtain a 

slight enrichment in HREE and a Ce negative anomaly (inherited characteristic from the seawater) 

together with a Eu positive anomaly (the most distinctive feature of vent fluids). 

Metalliferous sediments (Fig 7.6B) are the most REE-enriched samples, displaying a wide range of 

values. The REE normalised patterns are characterised by LREE relative enrichments along with slight 

HREE depletions. An evident negative anomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.15 to 0.18) is shown in all samples, 

together with a feeble negative anomaly in Eu (Eu*= 0.73 to 0.82). When compared with the seawater 

pattern (Fig 7.6D) it is clear that their pattern indicates a REE scavenging of the ocean by adsorption in 

phyllosilicates forming the sediments.  

Both jasper samples share similarities in the pattern shape, revealing relative enrichments in LREE and 

faint enrichments in HREE. Sample MD-NP-3 displays a weak positive anomaly in Ce (Ce*=1.19) and 

an evident negative anomaly in Eu (Eu*= 0.07), while sample MD-150-114.10 shows a negative  

anomaly in Ce (Ce*= 0.34) and a positive one in Eu (Eu*= 1.56). The mineralised sulphide-rich jasper 

displays a pattern alike of that showed by the sulphide ore sample MD-P3-4-1; like in sulphide ore 

samples, these REE normalised patterns suggest the development of mixtures of seawater and vent fluids  

but the former component (seawater) is now more important. The Mn-rich mineralised jasper shows a 

distinct REE normalised pattern, conceivably due to the geochemical behaviour of Ce (Ce3+ is soluble  

under reducing conditions, precipitating as Ce4+ in oxidizing conditions); The sample is mainly 

composed of pyrolusite (Mn4+O2), identified via XRD (Appendix X), so most of the Ce might be 

incorporated in the Mn4+ position.

REE contents of metalliferous sediments from Troodos (Robertson &amp;amp; Fleet, 1976) and modern 

analogues from East Pacific Rise (Barret, 1988) were taken from literature for comparison purposes 

with the REE patterns obtained for Mandoos samples. All these sediments display a similar pattern 

despite of differences in relative abundances (denoting variable enrichment levels). The metalliferous  

sediments from Mandoos occupy an intermediate position between samples from Troodos, which are 

the most enriched in all REE elements, and from modern analogue settings (the lesser REE-enriched).

7.4 Spider Diagrams 

Primitive mantle (PM) normalised (Palme &amp;amp; O´Neill, 2004) spider diagrams, using a set of elements 

organised by their atomic number, were used to characterise the Mandoos sulphide ores, metalliferous  

sediments and jaspers. The samples show common positive anomalies in Cu, As, Mo, In, Sb, Te, W and 

Pb, along with evident negative anomalies in Cr and Ni; Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb and Th also show negative 

anomalies, but not so clearly. 

Despite the positive anomalies in V and Co, the sulphide ores are still depleted, relatively to primitive  

mantle, in transition metals with the exception of Cu, Zn and As. Cu displays enrichment ?340x PM, 

while As ?4000 to ?15000x PM, and Zn up to 10x PM (excluding sample MD-NP-1 which displays an 

Zn enrichment above 5000x PM). Depletion in Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Nb, as well as in REE and Th, are 

well marked. However, Mo, Cd, In, Sb, Te and Pb display an evident enrichment in all the sulphide ore 

samples. The Zn-rich sample (MD-NP-1) displays, as expected, a Cd enrichment above 60000x PM. 

The sulphide ore samples are also characterised by amounts of Mo between 50 and 2300x PM, Sb can 

vary from ?300 to ?5000x PM and Te between 40 and 3000x PM; the Pb positive anomaly denotes 

enrichment above 180x PM, never exceeding 1190x PM. 

Metalliferous sediments are enriched in all the measured elements with exception of Sc, Ti, Cr, Co and 

Ni. Well-defined positive anomalies in P, V, Cu, As, Mo, Sb, W, Pb and U are observed in all samples; 

P displays enrichments from ?40 to ?70x PM, while As (the most enriched element) is characterised by 

values ranging from ?980x PM to ?5600x PM. W and Pb also display high levels of enrichment in these 

sediments; W varies from ?45x to ?180X PM, while Pb enrichments can reach amounts ?1500x above 

the primitive mantle. The measured Mo, In, Sb and Te concentration are also significant in some 

samples, reaching maximums of 313x, 266x, 821x and 689x PM, respectively. 

Jasper samples (MD150-114.10), represented by a mineralised sulphide-rich jasper and a manganese 

ore with jasper clasts (MD-NP-3), are relatively enriched in As, Mo, Cd, Sb, W and U when compared 

to the primitive mantle. The As values range between 1230x and 7230x PM; Cd contents may reach up 

to 5270x PM; and Sb concentrations remain below ?1000x PM. In these samples, the U contents vary 

between 54x and 243x PM. Also noteworthy, are the enrichments in Ba (?108x PM) and W (?141x PM) 

in the MD-NP-3 sample, as well as in Cu (?535x PM) and Pb (?142x PM) in sample MD150-114.10. 

Overall enrichments in Cd, In, Te, W, and Sn (observed in the minor and trace elements chapter) 

represents conceivable signals of magmatic inputs to the hydrothermal-mineralis ing fluids involved in 

sulphide deposition.

7.5 Immobile Elements 

Since the relative mobility of elements in different geochemical settings is not a determined feature, 

being influenced by a wide number of features depending on element and/or environmenta l 

characteristics, it is crucial to test for each situation which elements present an immobile behaviour.  

Usually, various elements (such as Al, Zr, Ti, Nb, Y, Sc) tend to behave as immobile in a large 

assortment of geological processes and a common and simple approach to validate such relative  

immobility consists in plotting these elements against each other, resulting in a good positive linear co-

variation that contains the origin.  

  

The figure above (7.9) shows two examples of the plots obtained with the studied samples, indicating 

that Y, Zr and Nb can be considered geochemically immobile during the development of sulphide ores, 

mineralised jaspers and metalliferous sediments; according to the available data, La and Yb can also be

classified as immobile. Using now the ratios between immobile elements, one may put in evidence the 

distinct sources (protoliths) related to the sulphide ores and hydrothermal sediments (Fig 7.10). 

The plot La/Zr versus Y/Zr shown in Fig 7.10 is an example of that discrimination: a wide cluster that 

comprises the massive sulphide samples and a more constricted cluster involving all the metalliferous  

sediments (umber &amp;amp; ochres). Noteworthy is the presence of the jasper samples in both clusters, which 

is entirely consistent with the mineralogical characteristics of the analysed samples: sample MD-NP-3 

(manganese ore) shares more affinities with metalliferous sediments; sample MD150-114.10, a 

sulphide-rich mineralised jasper is compositionally influenced by the mechanims related to the sulphide  

ore development. The deviation displayed by sample MD-P3-4-1 is ascribed to the relative abundance 

of late-formed carbonates in the sulphide breccia. 

Normalising all the values to an immobile element will reduce the dilution factor, allowing to directly 

compare samples. For this exercise, Y was the immobile element chosen. Fig 7.11 compares all samples 

from the three different rock types collected during sampling: sulphide ores, umber and ochres and 

jaspers. A general inspection shows that all the samples display similar patterns; however: sulphide ores 

are the most chemically enriched; metalliferous sediments are the less chemically enriched; and jaspers 

occupy an intermediate position between those two “end-members”. 

A closer look into individual groups allow to better evaluate the enrichment factors; sulphide ores are 

mainly enriched in SiO2, Fe2O3, S, As, Sr, Mo, Ta and Tl. Sample MD-P3-4-1 displays a slightly 

different pattern, also with the particularity of being the less-enriched sample amongst all sulphide ores, 

as expected (mineralised breccia cemented by carbonates). Samples MD-NP-1 and MD-178-128.80 

show evident enrichment in Zn and Cd not registered in other samples, which is compatible with the 

observed significant amounts of sphalerite. Noteworthy is also the enrichment in Te in many samples. 

Metalliferous sediments (Fig 7.11C) show enrichment in SiO2, Fe2O3, CaO, As, Sr, Ba and U. Major 

variations amongst these samples are in Cu, Cd, Te and Ta, whose enrichment factors can vary from 

tens to 1000x between them. 

Jaspers present two different patterns but with common enrichments in SiO2, Fe2O3, S, As, Mo and U.  

The MnO, Ba and Sr enrichments in sample MD-NP-3 are significantly higher (1000x and 100x, 

respectively) than those recorded by the sulphide-rich mineralised jasper.

8. Discussion 
 

Mafic type deposits are described as Cu-rich and Pb-poor when compared to other VMS deposits (Barrie 

&amp;amp; Hannington, 1999). The geometric mean of metals concentration in sulphide ores from different VMS 

deposits in distinct host-rock settings are reported in Hannington (2014). Fig 8.1 exhibits the distribution 

of these geometric mean concentrations in a Cu-Pb-Zn diagram, showing that the majority of VMS 

deposits are plotted in the Zn-Pb-Cu field, while the mafic-type deposits are distributed within the Cu-

Zn-rich field. The studied VMS samples from Mandoos 1 deposit were also included in this diagram, 

represented by the median values of the available concentration metal distributions (marked as 

Mandoos). Mandoos 1 is plotted in the Cu-type field, being relatively enriched in Cu when compared to 

other mafic-type deposits. The 8 Mt orebody displays an average grade of 1.72 wt% Cu, which showed 

to be slightly below the assessed value, although this might be explained by the incomplete database 

provided by the company, which only made available the survey for 33 drill holes. Petrography and 

mineral chemistry did not present evidence for zone refining, and the modelling of Cu and Zn grades 

also did not also document a metal zoning in the deposit. Nonetheless, it can be shown that (at least) 

part of the observed Cu enrichment comes from secondary Cu-rich phases developed in the course of a 

more oxidising (late) evolving event. As previously stated, the presence of numerous primary textures 

in sulphide ores and clasts suggest that refining processes were not important during the development 

of Mandoos 1 ores, placing them in a black-smoker type environment (some of the studied samples 

conceivably represent products of the crumbling of hydrothermal chimneys). The large amount of 

primary textures (framboidal and colloform) preserved in the studied samples allows also to reconsider 

the topic regarding the biogenic origin of pyrite in such systems. Framboids are known to be spherical 

to sub-spherical aggregates, composed by microcrystals of equigranular pyrite with a dense (cubic-

)packing arrangement; nevertheless, irregular aggregates (loose packing) are also common (Wilken &amp;amp; 

Barnes, 1997). Many authors suggested that these forms corresponded to pyritized bacterial colonies ; 

however the nucleation of pyrite framboidal microcrystals can also be a result of the ferromagnetic 

properties of greigite (Fe3S4), the precursor in this type of structure. Some experimental studies

suggested that greigite can only persist in hydrothermal solutions below 200ºC; at such temperature, 

pyritization rates increase (Wilken &amp;amp; Barnes, 1997). According to Wilken &amp;amp; Barnes (1997) the 

preservation of framboidal textures may be related to secondary pyrite outward growth, while Ostwald 

&amp;amp; England (1979) suggested that the crystallization of euhedral pyrite forms can result from framboids  

recrystallisation; this recrystallisation is characterised by an intermediate stage, of pyrite spherulites , 

ending in the final euhedral shape; Fig 8.2 shows the same structures present in this deposit. In addition, 

colloform textures provide us a sequential information of physical and chemical conditions during 

precipitation and, despite the clear relationship between bacteria and sulphur reduction, the relationship 

of bacterial agents in the direct precipitation of crystals is more unlikely. These textures (colloform 

textures), just like framboidal, are thought to result of primary precipitation from the hydrotherma l 

fluids, and not related to any bacterial related process. This is, possibly, the process that leads to the 

formation of most, if not all, colloform structures (Barrie et al. 2009). 

It is also important to discuss the relationship between pyrite and marcasite, as well as between sphalerite  

and wurtzite, considering their coexistence in some of the studied samples. This aims to constrain the 

physical-chemical conditions that inhibit and/or favour one phase crystallization in relation to the other. 

Ramdohr (1969) describes marcasite, unlike pyrite, as unstable under most pressure and temperature  

conditions reproduced in laboratory experiments, only switched whenever particular circumstances are 

imposed (such as, quite acid solutions at moderate temperatures). It is also suggested by the same author 

that wurtzite is metastable and its occurrence is only possible under low pressure and temperature 

conditions in equilibrium with acid solutions. The commonly acceptable paramorphism implies the 

“changing” of wurtzite (hexagonal structure) to sphalerite (cubic structure); consequently, according to 

this reasoning, the two mineral phases can only coexist in contexts where the slow reaction time-periods

a framboid; D – clast of polyhedron pyrite with preserved framboidal core being replaced by chalcopyrite.

of the phase transformation are favoured. In sea mounds, dramatic variations in temperature and pH can 

be recorded within short distances (millimetres to centimetres) due to the interaction of hydrotherma l 

vent fluids with cold sea water. Both minerals crystallise from acidic solutions; the mixture of such 

solution with sea water would result in a pH increase. This allows to explain the common presence of 

marcasite encased in pyrite crystals, where the abrupt variations in the chemical conditions promote the 

crystallisation of the most stable phase. The same process can be used to explain the presence of 

paramorphic sphalerite after wurtzite.  

The Mandoos 1 stockwork is characterised by silicified basalts, where the silica is leached out from the 

basalt due to high temperatures, increasing porosity and resulting in sulphide dissemination. The 

continuous leaching can also be responsible for small/local collapses and creation of breccia zones. With 

the system cooling, the stockwork silicification becomes stronger due to the remaining silica advected 

from the deeper domains of the hydrothermal system. Strong silicification zones are seen associated 

with larger euhedral pyrite clusters formed in vuggs and also large anhedral pyrite clas ts, showing 

breccia texture, possibly corresponding to local collapse zones.  

As previously stated, the Mandoos sulphide ores are quite monotonous in composition and mainly 

formed by iron sulphides, although the presence of accessory Cu- and Zn-rich phases is common. A 

general paragenetic sequence resulted from petrography is illustrated in Fig 8.3. However, as seen 

before, in these kind of geological environment, significant chemical variations can took place in short-

range space and such variations, combined with intense crumbling and mass-waste movements, may 

lead to different textural interpretations depending on the sampled area of the massive sulphide orebody.  

 

Fig 8. 3 – Schematic representation of the paragenetic sequence proposed for Mandoos 1 deposit. 

The oxidation event is possibly synchronous of jaspers formation and the periodic leaching/silicifica tion 

events would be responsible for the same hydrothermal imprint in jaspers and silicified (footwall) 

basalts. The sulphide dissemination in jaspers is possible due to an increasing of porosity during 

leaching, leading also to the formation of veins and some collapse breccias, later silicified when the 

system was subjected to cooling. The presence of the leached rims in the pyrite crystals indicate the 

circulation of late Fe-poor fluids, evidenced by the leaching of iron from the jaspers.  

When massive sulphides are not covered, sea floor weathering can produce umbers and ochres, where 

massive sulphide breccias are oxidised and impregnated with silica in a colder and more oxidis ing 

environment. Nevertheless, these can also be formed by direct precipitation of metals within the water 

column, partly derived from the exhalative discharge, and further deposited in oxidising conditions  

along with the siliciclastic sediments (largely dominated by phyllosilicates).

Whole rock chemistry, more precisely the REE normalised pattern analysis, suggests that sulphide ores 

deposition is strongly influenced by a mixture of vent fluids and seawater, while the composition of 

umber and ochres is mainly determined by processes of seawater scavenging followed by phyllosilic a te  

adsorption mechanisms (Fig 8.4). A mixture of seawater and vent fluids should also be involved in the 

formation of mineralised jaspers, but in this case the seawater weight in the mixture proportion is  

considerably higher. With the exception of umber and ochres, whose REE contents appear to derive  

exclusively from seawater, the REE abundances in sulphide ores and jaspers are conceivably related to 

the leaching and scavenging of footwall basalts synchronous of their hydrothermal alteration. It is known 

that footwall volcanic rocks are leached by infiltrated seawater, circulating along fractures, producing a 

variably modified seawater which is further released in hydrothermal chimneys, as vent fluid. Assuming 

that REE concentrations are in equilibrium with the vent fluid (i.e. that no significant fractionation took 

place after the massive sulphide ore and jaspers deposition) a simple simulation can be performed in 

order to predict the ratio of seawater (SW) and basalt involved in such process. Regarding to footwall 

less altered basalts (B), a SW:B mixing proportion scattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01 is needed 

to simulate the REE enrichment displayed by the studied samples. If the more altered footwall basalts 

(B’) are used, the requested SW:B’ proportion mixtures range between 0.50:0.50 and 0.95:0.05 because 

B’ are significantly more depleted in REE than B. It is also noteworthy that SW:B and SW:B’ 

interactions  simulate roughly the measured vent fluids in modern analogues magnitudes (TAG an EPR) 

with mixing proportions between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001. Nevertheless, the pattern displaye d 

by these vent fluids, characterised by an evident Eu positive anomaly and positive LREE and HREE 

fractionation, are not completely reproduced in this numerical simulation. This is related to the simplis tic  

modelling and rough approach to the problem, which does not consider other geochemical factors that 

may control the vent fluid composition; as previously shown, there is evidence for a magmatic  

contribution to the hydrothermal fluid responsible for the mineralisation, and this may be one cause for 

the recorded differences.

9. Conclusions  
 

The metal contents of drill-core and open-pit samples place the Mandoos deposit in the Cu-rich VMS 

field, near the typical Mafic-type VMS deposits. Additionally, the 3D modelling performed with 

MICROMINE estimates on ca. 8 Mt of ore with 1.72 wt% in Cu. The lack of evident chemical zonation 

of the orebody, as indicated by the 3D modelling results, suggests also that metal zoning refinement 

processes were not significant all through the evolving stages recorded by the ore-forming system at 

Mandoos. 

The massive ores are mainly composed of sulphide-rich breccias cemented by silica and/or zeolite s , 

with minor phyllosilicates. These breccias are polymictic, comprising clasts widely varied in size , 

textural arrangements and mineral composition. They are possibly part of the talus found in many 

hydrothermal field vents in present-day analogues, where the (cyclic) crumbling of hydrotherma l 

chimneys produce debris later cemented by siliceous fluids. This mineralisation type is characterised by 

a monotonous and simple mineral assemblage mainly composed of pyrite and marcasite with minor 

amounts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite and other Cu-rich phases.  

The ubiquitous presence of primary textures, ranging from framboidal and colloform pyrite and 

marcasite, to the preservation of pyritised tubeworm burrows also place the studied samples in a black-

smoker type vent. In these environments, the presence of framboidal pyrite crystal is interpreted as 

consequence of the magnetic properties of greigite, the precursor of pyrite. Additionally, the presence 

of marcasite and sphalerite (after pyrite and wurtzite, respectively) can be explained as a result of abrupt 

pH (and T?) modifications experienced by the hydrothermal fluids, especially when mixture with sea-

water occurs in (sub)superficial conditions.  

The formation of jaspers is considered to be a result of the temperature collapse of the hydrotherma l 

system, correlative of the late oxidisation evolving stage, where Cu-rich mineral phases are formed 

(from chalcopyrite). Consequently, during the following bleaching of these silica and Fe-rich exhalative  

rocks, sulphide mineralization also occurs, from the scavenging of iron from the jaspers. 

When the massive sulphides are exposed to the oxidising cold sea-water, oxidation phenomena occur, 

producing metalliferous sediments. These are easily distinguishable by their REE pattern and metal 

contents, which indicate that they derive, mostly, from sea-water fluids. Furthermore, the REE patterns 

for the massive sulphide breccias and mineralised jaspers are compatible with the mixture of vent fluid 

and sea-water. Vent fluid simulations were performed and established mixtures of SW:B and SW:B’ 

scattered between 0.85:0.15 and 0.99:0.01, and 0.50:0.50 and 0.95:0.05, respectively, in order to reach 

ores and jaspers REE enrichment magnitudes. Modern day analogues vent fluid REE enrichments are 

predicted with mixtures of seawater and basalt ranging between 0.999:0.001 and 0.9999:0.0001, 

although, the typical pattern is not reproduced due to a magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal fluid 

which geochemical properties are not contemplated in the simulation.
