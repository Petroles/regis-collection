ABSTRACT

This work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in
comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the groundwater at a petrol station. Two microbiological
methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -
dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. In the former
we tested the bacterial cultures Staphylococcus hominis, Kocuria palustris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI,
Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and
groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. In the
respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from
a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. The redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia,
even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. In 48 days, the removal
of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times
greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. This difference was caused by the consumption of labile
hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas
chromatographic analyses. Thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the
weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is
necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with
recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.

Key words: biodegradability, bioremediation, commercial oil diesel, weathered diesel oil.

INTRODUCTION

environment begins to change almost immediately because
of numerous biochemical and physical processes. The
geochemistry related to organic compounds is described in
details by Kaplan et al. (14). According to them, hydrocarbons
released into the environment are subject to biotic and abiotic
weathering reactions in the soil and groundwater media. These
processes act together, with the rate of transformation being
related to the chemical composition of the fuel and local

environmental factors, including temperature, soil moisture
and nutrient and oxygen contents. Grain size and clay-type
are also important parameters for controlling weathering
processes in the soil. Major abiotic reactions include
hydrolysis, dehydrogenation, oxidation and polymerization
(17). These reactions are often closely related to microbial
(biotic) transformations in the soil profile. Biotic weathering
of a hydrocarbon fuel consists of two interdependent
mechanisms: microbial uptake (4) and metabolic degradation
(26). These transformations are likely to occur stepwise,
producing alcohols, phenols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids

in sequence. Biodegradation is the major weathering process
for middle distillates, as the diesel oil (14).

Diesel oil contains 2000 to 4000 hydrocarbons, a complex
mixture of normal, branched and cyclic alkanes, and aromatic
compounds obtained from the middle-distillate fraction during
petroleum separation (11). Some of these compounds can be
used as indicators for diesel oil weathering assessment. Changes
in concentration ratios of hydrocarbons as benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are due mainly to evaporation
and dissolution processes. These compounds are characterized
by their high vapour pressure and aqueous water solubility.
Benzene and toluene preferentially dissolves in the groundwater
when compared to ethylbenzene and xylenes, which have a
lower solubility and are more resistant to biodegradation (14).

The poliaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) provide another
useful tool for monitoring environmental alterations. Some of
the PAH compounds of diesel fuel are among the least affected
by weathering. These semi-volatile compounds with a low
solubility and recalcitrant characteristic may persist for a long
time in the environment.

The weathering process may also be evaluated by analyzing
the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). In this case,
chromatographic profiles of a commercial diesel, generally
present a satisfactory resolution for all n-alkanes and some
other isoprenoid alkanes, such as pristine (2,6,10,14-
tetramethylpentadecane) and phytane (2,6,10,14-
tetramethylhexadecane). Nevertheless, the major fraction of the
diesel oil is not characterized because the majority of the
components could not be resolved and they appear in the
chromatograms as a “hump”, which is called the “unresolved
complex mixture (UCM)”, which presumably includes branched
and cyclic alkanes and polar transformation products (19, 6).
The resolved hydrocarbons are called “total resolvable
hydrocarbons (TRH)” and the TPH are the sum of TRH and
UCM. The TRH are non-degraded hydrocarbons, and they
appear as peaks in the chromatogram.

Hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms usually degrade
branched alkanes and isoprenoid compounds at much slower
rates than straight-chain alkanes. Therefore, the ratio of straight-
chain alkanes to these highly branched biomarker compounds
can reflect the extent to which microorganisms have degraded
the hydrocarbons in the diesel oil (2). The hydrocarbons
content in the weathered diesel is mainly characterized as
isoprenoid alkanes and UCM, which are more recalcitrant than
n-alkanes (11). Thus, due to the biodegradation, the UCM
“hump” becomes larger and the TRH peaks decrease.

Strategies to accelerate the biological breakdown of
hydrocarbons in soil include stimulation of the indigenous
microorganisms (biostimulation) by optimizing factors as
nutrients, oxygenation, temperature, pH, addition of
biosurfactants and through inoculation of an enriched mixed
microbial consortium into the soil (bioaugmentation) (1,10).

Concerning the bioaugmentation technique, a previous
evaluation of the microorganisms capability of degrading the
pollutants is the first step to set up a field scale remediation
project based on addition of microorganisms. However, in this
phase, many studies are carried out by simulating contaminations,
where, for instance, commercial fuel is added to soil or
groundwater. This approach may result in wrong conclusions,
because the pollutants have their characteristics altered by
physical-chemical and biological mechanisms when exposed to
large periods in environmental conditions, the so-called
weathering effect. Thus this work aimed to evaluate the capability
of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in
comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the
groundwater at a petrol station.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Microorganisms
Different bacteria cultures and microorganisms consortia

were tested in relation to their capability of biodegrading diesel
oils. The bacteria cultures of Staphylococcus hominis and
Kocuria palustris were isolated from the soil of the petrol
station where the weathered diesel oil was collected and
identified by rDNA 16S sequence (performed by CPQBA/
UNICAMP) (21). The bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa
LBI was isolated by Benincasa et al. (5) from a hydrocarbon
contaminated area.

The bacterial strains Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus
cereus were previously isolated and identified by Kataoka (15)
from a landfarming at the Brazilian oil refinery Replan (Petrobras
S/A). From the wastewater of the same refinery, a microbial
consortium (R) was also obtained.

The commercial inoculum called Efficient Microorganisms
(EM) is a microorganism mix that has demonstrated efficient
performance as a biological fertilizer and as a biological
amendment to wastewater pond treatments. Although EM has
been applied successfully in biological wastewater treatments,
it has never been tested as an agent to enhance bioremediation
of hydrocarbon contaminated sites, thus originally EM has not
been provided for this proposal.

From the Petrobras oil terminal (Terminal Marítimo
Almirante Barroso - Tebar), located in São Sebastião (SP-
Brazil), we obtained the consortium L, the activated sludge
of a pilot bioreactor that has been tested to treat water of
production.

Other consortia tested were ASP-S and ASP-GW, obtained
respectively from the soil and the groundwater of the petrol
station where the weathered diesel oil was collected; SB-S and
SB-GW, respectively, from the soil and groundwater at another
petrol station; RC, from the soil collected during the replacement
of underground pipes of a third petrol station; U, from an
uncontaminated soil collected at Unesp campus.



Biodegradability of diesel oils

Inocula preparation
The inocula S. hominis, K. palustris, O. anthropi, B. cereus,

P. aeruginosa LBI and consortium R were prepared using
bacterial cells transferred from the storage culture tubes and
streaked onto the surface of Petri dishes containing nutrient
agar (Merck, Germany). To prepare the consortia ASP-S, SB-S,
RC-S and U, 1.0 g of respective soils were added to Erlenmeyer
flasks (125 mL) containing 50 mL of Bushnell-Hass (BH) medium
and kept under agitation during 3 days. After this period, the
medium was streaked onto the surface of Petri dishes containing
nutrient agar. The ASP-GW and SB-GW were prepared by
streaking 1 mL of respective groundwater onto the surface of
Petri dishes containing nutrient agar.

The Petri dishes were incubated during 24 hours at 35ºC.
Then cells were harvested using sterile water.

The EM and consortium L were added to the biodegradability
experiments flasks, without previous preparation.

Diesel oil biodegradability experiments
The biodegradability experiments were carried out using a

technique based on the redox indicator 2.6 - dichlorophenol
indophenol (DCPIP) (13). The inocula S. hominis, K. palustris,
O. anthropi, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa LBI and consortium R
were added (125 µL, O.D = 0.55 at ? = 610 nm (SHIMADZU UV-
1601PC)), separately, to test tubes (duplicates) that contained
sterile Bushnell-Hass (BH) medium (7.5 mL) and 50 µL of diesel
oil. The concentration of DCPIP was 27 mg/mL. The inoculum
EM (200 µL, concentration equal to 109 CFU/mL), the consortium
L (1.0 mL concentration equal to 107 CFU/mL), the inocula
prepared from the native microorganisms of soils and
groundwaters (1.0 mL, concentration not determined) and P.
aeruginosa LBI again (1.0 mL, concentration not determined)
were added to Erlenmeyer flasks (125 mL) (duplicates) that
contained sterile BH medium (50 mL) and 1% (v/v) of diesel oil.
The concentration of DCPIP was 20 mg/mL. Test tubes and
Erlenmeyer flasks were kept under agitation (240 rpm) at room
temperature (27±2ºC). The BH medium consists of, g.L-1:
MgSO4: 0.2; CaCl2: 0.02; KH2PO4: 1.0; K2HPO4: 1.0; NH4NO3:
1.0; FeCl3: 0.05 (9).

The principle of this technique is that during the microbial
oxidation of hydrocarbons, electrons are transferred to electron
acceptors such as O2, nitrates and sulphate. By incorporating an
electron acceptor such as DCPIP to the culture medium, it is
possible to ascertain the ability of the microorganism to utilize
hydrocarbon substrate by observing the colour change of DCPIP
from blue (oxidized) to colourless (reduced). This Hanson et al.
(13) technique has been employed in several works (8,20,24).

Soil respirometric experiments
In order to compare the biodegradability of the diesel oils

when released to the environment, a soil contamination was
simulated by adding the diesel oils (6g / kg soil), separately, to

the soil collected at the petrol station where consortium RC was
obtained (RC soil).

The experiments were carried out in Bartha biometer flasks
(250 mL) that were used to measure microbial CO2 production
as described by Bartha &amp;amp; Pramer (3). Mineralization studies
involving measurements of total CO2 production can provide
excellent information on the biodegradability potential of
hydrocarbons (2).

For each experimental condition (Table 1), the biometer flasks
were prepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of soil) and incubated at
27ºC in the dark. Produced CO2 was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution
of KOH (0.2 N), located in the side-arm of the biometer. This
solution was periodically withdrawn by syringe, and the amount
of carbon dioxide absorbed was then measured by titrating the
residual KOH (after the addition of barium chloride solution (1
mL, 1.0 N) used to precipitate the carbonate ions) with a standard
solution of HCl (0.1 N). During this procedure, the biometers
were aerated during 1.5 minutes through the ascarite filters.

At the end of the experiments, replicates of each treatment
were thoroughly mixed together for physicochemical and
microbiological analyses. Experiment 2, carried out after
experiment 1, had the purpose to confirm tendencies observed
in the latter, thus only the CO2 production was evaluated at the
same conditions but in a larger period of incubation.

Enumeration of bacteria
Total heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated by using the

pour plate technique on plate count agar (Acumedia, USA).
Plate count of the bacterial soil population was performed as
follows: samples of 1 g of soil were added to 9 mL of 0.85%
sterile saline solution in essay tubes and agitated mechanically
for 2 minutes. After appropriate serial dilutions, 1 mL of the
suspension were spread over the surface of duplicate Petri
dishes and incubated for 48 h at 35ºC. The total heterotrophic
bacteria count was carried out at the beginning and at end of
the first respirometric experiment.

Diesel oil composition
In order to characterize the diesel oils, superficial soil was

collected in an uncontaminated area (Unesp campus) with no
vegetation, and sieved (tyler 14) before being contaminated

with commercial or weathered diesel. For the BTEX (benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) and PAH (poli-aromatic
compounds) analyses, 8 mg diesel/kg of soil were added and
for the TPH (total petroleum hydrocarbons) analysis, 3 mg/kg.
The analyses were carried out by Analytical Solutions
laboratory (São Paulo) according to the USEPA methods: 8021B,
8270 and 8015B, respectively.

Soil sampling and characteristics
The RC soil samples were collected at 0.50 m depth during

the replacement of underground pipes at a petrol station. These
samples showed low level of contamination by unknown fuel,
possibly due to leaks in the pipes and ground infiltrations. Until
performing the respirometric experiments, samples were stored
at 5ºC. Table 2 summarizes some physicochemical characteristics
of the RC soil. Values of heavy metals concentrations are not
above the more restricted levels set by Cetesb (São Paulo
Environmental Agency - Brazil) and by the Dutch list (7).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Diesel oil characterization
The weathered diesel was collected from a thick layer above

the groundwater at a petrol station where the leakage occurred
approximately ten years ago. As stated by Kaplan (14), in this

situation, where there is a thick free phase product, the rate of
alteration is slower than for a thin layer, because these processes
affect the interface fuel/water and not the body of the bulk
product. Biodegradation inside the body of a free product is
extremely slow, due to limitation of oxygen, water and nutrients.
Thus, the fuel could remain relatively unaltered for a period of
time as long as decades. The most likely alterations to occur in
this situation are evaporation of the most volatile hydrocarbons
and dissolution of the most soluble components. Despite these
considerations, the analyses show that the diesel oil had some
characteristics altered, and probably due to both biological and
physical-chemical processes.

The weathered diesel has a dark green colour and a different
smell from the reddish commercial diesel. As time goes by, the
dyes in a released free product deteriorate, thus the colour of the
fuel may change (14). Table 3 shows that the commercial diesel
has a higher concentration of BTEX than the weathered diesel.
The comparative chromatograms are in Fig. 1. It reflects mainly
the effect of the diesel exposure to an aqueous environment, and
volatilization. At the monitoring well where the oil was collected,
the groundwater presented the following concentrations of
BTEX: 112.1; 98.5; 115.7 and 865.8 µg/L, respectively.

The PAH concentrations are in Table 4. These recalcitrant
molecules are slowly biodegraded, and as the other alterations
related to the other hydrocarbons progress more rapidly, the

diesel oil become enriched with the PAH, thus the weathered
diesel oil had a significant increase in the PAH concentrations.
Fig. 2 shows the comparative chromatograms.

Analysing the TPH concentrations (Table 5), the weathered
diesel oil presents no detectable n-alkanes and a high abundance
of pristine and phytane, which is in accordance with a weathering
process. Moreover, the TRH and UCM fractions are,
respectively, smaller and bigger in the weathered diesel oil,
which is another indicative of biodegradation. In the
chromatograms (Fig. 3), it is possible to observe that the UCM
“hump” becomes larger and the TRH peaks decrease in the
weathered diesel oil.

Biodegradability experiment: redox indicator DCPIP
The results obtained with the biodegradability experiments

using the redox indicator DCPIP are listed in Tables 6 and 7,
related to the experiments carried out in test tubes and
Erlenmeyer flasks, respectively.

Initially, as in the test tubes the inocula were added at equal
concentrations, relative abilities of different cultures can be

ascertained depending upon the time taken for the change in
colour (13). Thus, all cultures had similar capability of
biodegrading the commercial diesel oil, but only the consortium
R, from the refinery wastewater, degraded the weathered diesel
oil (Table 6). Even native cultures (S. hominis and K. palustris)
and the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas, known to be
responsible for oil degradation (2), were not able to biodegrade
the weathered fuel. No study relating the cultures S. hominis
and K. palustris to hydrocarbon biodegradation was found.
Nevertheless, Gomes et al. (12) describe the biosurfactant
production by a strain of S. aureus utilising hydrocarbons as
carbon source. The other cultures have demonstrated to be
able to degrade hydrocarbons. P. aeruginosa is a well know
producer of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant (18). The strain P.
aeruginosa LBI was capable of producing biosurfactant using
soapstock (22), mannitol and glycerol (25) and kerosene, diesel

oil, crude oil and oily sludge (23). The same culture O. anthropi,
in Kataoka (15), enhanced the biodegradation of oily sludge
and was capable of biodegrading hexane, heptane, hexadecane
and commercial diesel oil.

In the experiments carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks (Table 7),
again P. aeruginosa LBI demonstrated no ability to degrade the
weathered diesel oil. All consortia were able to degrade both
diesel oils, except the commercial inoculum EM. As mentioned
previously, EM has never been tested in hydrocarbons before.
Here, it was only able to biodegrade the commercial fuel, as the
other microorganisms with recognised biodegradation ability.

Experiments carried out with the native microorganisms (ASP-
S, SB-S, RC-S, ASP-GW and SB-GW) indicate that the
contaminated soils or groundwaters already had a microbiot
adapted to degrade recalcitrant hydrocarbons. Moreover, the
result obtained with the consortium U shows, as in other works

Figure 2. Chromatographic analysis (PAH) of (a) commercial and (b) weathered diesel oils. Dilution factors, respectively: 1x and 10x.

(27,16), that the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms
in soils is ubiquitous, even in not polluted soils.

The better performance of the consortia demonstrate the
importance of considering the role of the commensalism when
treating more recalcitrant pollutants as a weathered diesel oil,
where each species has a specific function in the enzymatic
reaction sequences responsible for the breakdown of complex
hydrocarbons chains.

Biodegradability experiment: respirometric
The CO2 production of experiment 1 and its cumulative values

are represented, respectively, in Figs. 4 and 5. These results show
that until the 10th day approximately, the biodegradation rates
were very similar, but after this period, the rate of consumption of
the commercial oil increases until the 27th day (maximum value),
while the rate in relation to the weathered diesel keeps almost
constant. Certainly, the labile hydrocarbons, in greater quantity
in the commercial oil, were responsible for this difference.

 Results of experiment 2, which was carried out at the same
conditions but in a larger period of time, are plotted together
with experiment 1 (Figs. 4 and 5). This comparison confirms that
after 70 days the rates become equal, indicating the consumption
of the labile hydrocarbons during this period in the commercial
diesel oil. Moreover, the similarity between the curves shows
that the respirometric technique has a good reproducibility.

The concentrations of hydrocarbons at the beginning and at
the end of respirometric experiment 1 are listed in Table 8. These
values are in agreement with the respirometric results. The
biodegradation efficiencies of the labile hydrocarbons (total n-
alkanes and the TRH fraction) are clearly higher in the commercial
diesel oil, which explains the increase of the CO2 production
rate, and the concentrations of the main hydrocarbons fractions
(TRH and UCM) are similar at the end of the experiment,
confirming the tendency of equalization of the CO2 production
rates. Figure 6 shows that the population of the total heterotrophic

Biodegradability of diesel oils

bacteria was favoured by the relative higher abundance of the
labile hydrocarbons in the commercial diesel oil.

Finally, although the native microorganisms in the RC soil
(consortium RC-S) were able to biodegrade both diesel oils, as
demonstrated by the redox indicator experiments, in a condition
of simulated contamination (respirometric experiments), the
biodegradation efficiency of TPH was approximately 2.5 times
greater when the commercial diesel oil was used, a difference
that can be significant when estimating the time to clean up an
old polluted site.

In conclusion, biodegradability studies that do not consider
the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate
biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is
necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection
of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability
of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.

RESUMO

Biodegradabilidade de óleos diesel comercial e
intemperizado

Este trabalho objetivou avaliar a capacidade de diferentes
microrganismos em degradar óleo diesel comercial em

comparação com um óleo diesel intemperizado coletado da água
subterrânea em um posto de combustíveis. Dois métodos
microbiológicos foram usados para a avaliação da
biodegradabilidade: a técnica baseada no indicador redox 2,6-
diclorofenol indofenol (DCPIP) e os experimentos
respirométricos usando os respirômetros de Bartha. No primeiro,
testamos as culturas bacterianas Staphylococcus hominis,
Kocuria palustris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI,
Ochrobactrum anthropi e Bacillus cereus, um inóculo
comercial, consórcios obtidos do solo e da água subterrânea
contaminados com hidrocarbonetos e um consórcio de uma
área não contaminada. Nos experimentos respirométricos, foi
avaliada a capacidade dos microrganismos nativos do solo de
um posto de combustíveis em biodegradar os óleos diesel. Os
experimentos com o indicador redox mostraram que apenas os
consórcios, mesmo aquele de uma área não contaminada, foram
capazes de biodegradar o diesel intemperizado. Em 48 dias, a
remoção de hidrocarbonetos totais de petróleo (HTP) nos
experimentos respirométricos foi aproximadamente 2,5 vezes
maior quando o óleo diesel comercial foi usado. Esta diferença
foi causada pelo consumo de hidrocarbonetos facilmente
biodegradáveis, presentes em maior quantidade no óleo diesel
comercial, como demonstrado pelas análises cromatográficas.
Assim, resultados indicam que estudos de biodegradabilidade
que não consideram o efeito de intemperização dos poluentes
pode sobre estimar as taxas de biodegradação e quando o
bioaumento é necessário, a melhor estratégia seria aquela baseada
na injeção de consórcios, pois mesmo culturas com reconhecida
capacidade de biodegradar hidrocarbonetos podem falhar
quando aplicadas isoladamente.
