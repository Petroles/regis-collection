ABSTRACT

RESUMO

Acúmulo de nutrientes e produção de biomassa de plantas
de alfafa após correção do solo com silicatos

Pesquisas sobre o uso agronômico de corretivos à base de silicatos têm apontado o grande potencial desses
insumos, no sentido de promover melhorias químicas do solo. Há poucas informações, porém, sobre as taxas de
reatividade de suas frações granulométricas. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar se a eficiência relativa de reatividade
das frações granulométricas, obtidas experimentalmente, poderiam ser consideradas no cálculo do PRNT para prática
da calagem, proporcionando adequado desenvolvimento de plantas de alfafa. Utilizaram-se seis tratamentos, que
consistiram em duas escórias, aplicadas em duas doses, uma utilizando-se do PRNT medido experimentalmente e, a
outra, do PRNT determinado em laboratório; calcário dolomítico e wollastonita, aplicados em uma dose, utilizando-se
o PRNT determinado em laboratório. As doses dos corretivos foram calculadas a fim de elevar a saturação por bases a
80 %, considerando o PRNT experimental e de laboratório. Os tratamentos foram aplicados a dois solos: Latossolo
Vermelho distrófico e Nitossolo Vermelho eutrófico. Os métodos de determinação de PRNT preconizados para calcários
podem ser aplicados para escórias de siderurgia. A aplicação das escórias proporcionou ação corretiva do solo, com
consequente maior acúmulo de Ca, P, e Si nas plantas de alfafa, favorecendo sua produção de matéria seca.

Nutrient accumulation and biomass production of alfafa after soil
amendment with silicates1

Studies on the use of silicate correctives in agriculture show that they have great potential to improve soil chemical
characteristics, however, little information is available on the reactivity rates of their particle-size fractions. This study
investigated whether the reactivity rates obtained experimentally could be considered in the calculation of ECC (effective
calcium carbonate) for soil liming, promoting adequate development of alfalfa plants. Six treatments were evaluated in
the experiment, consisting of two slag types applied in two rates. The experimental ECC was used to calculate one of
the rates and the ECC determined in the laboratory was used to calculate the other. Rates of limestone and wollastonite
were based on the ECC determined in laboratory. The rates of each soil acidity corretive were calculated to increase the
base saturation to 80%. The treatments were applied to a Rhodic Hapludox and an Alfisol Ferrudalfs. The methods for
ECC determination established for lime can be applied to steel slag. The application of slag corrected soil acidity with
consequent accumulation of Ca, P, and Si in alfalfa, favoring DM production.

Key words: slag, soil acidity, ECC, Medicago sativa.

INTRODUCTION

Correcting soil acidity is essential for crop productivity,
mainly in Brazil, where more than 70% of the agricultural
soils are acidic. Limestone is the most used corrective in
soil acidity neutralization. However, studies on the use of
silicate correctives, such as steel slag, in agriculture show
that they have high potential to provide soil chemical
improvements, mainly by increasing pH and base
saturation (Brassioli et al., 2009; Corrêa et al., 2009).

Under field conditions, slag corrected soil acidity more
efficiently than limestone (Corrêa et al., 2007). However, it
could be a result of lower effective calcium carbonate (ECC)
of some slag types compared with limestone; therefore,
greater amounts of silicates are required to raise base
saturation to the adequate level for the crop.

Slag is classified as soil acidity corrective and the same
legislation for limestone is applied for its
commercialization, i.e., the relative efficiency of reactivity
(RER) for silicate particle-size fractions are based on the
same rates determined for carbonate materials, which are
0 for particles retained in sieve #10, fractions &gt; 2.00 mm;
20% for retention in sieve #20, fractions from 2.00 to 0.84
mm; 60% for retention in sieve #50, fractions from 0.84 to
0.30 mm; and 100% for fractions &amp;lt;0.30 mm sieved through
#50. Although the corrective capacity of slag and limestone
are similar, when carbonate RER is used to calculate the
dose of steel slag, errors may occur because these materials
have distinct compositions. Moreover, SiO

3
 anion

solubility is six or seven times higher than that of carbonate
(CO

3
2-) (Alcarde, 1992).

Thus, the RER values used for limestone become
inappropriate to evaluate the RER of silicates, resulting in
the underestimation of the hydrogen neutralization
capacity and, consequently, the overestimation of the
silicate amount necessary for soil acidity correction.

Prado et al. (2004) evaluated the steel slag reactivity
and observed that the fraction retained in ABNT 5-10
sieves was inefficient to modify the soil pH. For the
intermediate sieves ABNT 10-20 and 20-50, the RER was
proportional to the current values prescribed in the
Brazilian legislation for limestone. However, the industrial
process generates several types of slag with different
recrystallization points because of the amount of Ca, Mg
and cooling time (Pereira et al., 2010). These
characteristics can be related to the solubility of the slag
compounds when added to the soil and, consequently,
influence the material reactivity.

To obtain more information on the reactivity of steel
slag, this study investigated whether the reactivity rates
obtained experimentally could be considered in the ECC
calculation for soil liming, promoting adequate
development of alfalfa plants.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reactivity of two types of slag from distinct origins
(slag 1, from steel and slag 2, from stainless steel) was
compared with limestone and an additional treatment with
wollastonite, which is a calcium silicate considered as an
international standard.

Initially, an experiment was carried out for three
months to determine relative efficiency of reactivity
(RER) of each particle-size (ABNT # 5-10, 10-20, 20-50
and&amp;lt;50 sieves) of the sources. The RER value was used
to calculate the reactivity rate (RR) for each corrective
source (Deus et al., 2014). Afterwards, the ECC was
calculated, hereby denominated Experimental ECC, by
the following equation:

being: NP = neutralization power
            RR = reactivity rate

The NP was determined by the acid base titration
method (Alcarde, 2009). The laboratory ECC was
determined following the official methodology for
limestone (Alcarde, 2009).

This study was carried out in a greenhouse, using
four soil acidity correctives: steel slag (slag 1) provided
by Mannesmann®; stainless steel slag (slag 2) provided
by Recmix®, limestone and wollastonite. The rates of each
soil acidity corrective were calculated to increase the base
saturation (BS) to 80%, as recommended for alfalfa (Raij
et al., 1996). To calculate the rates of slag, the experimen-
tal and laboratory ECC were used. Limestone and
wollastonite had similar experimental and laboratory values
of ECC (Table 1); thus, only the laboratory ECC was used.
The amount of corrective material applied per pot was
calculated based on the volume of 1 ha at 0-20 cm depth,
considering the capacity of 12 L per pot.

The treatments were applied to two soils (Table 2), a
Rhodic Hapludox and an Alfisol Ferrudalfs (Soil Taxonomy,
2010). The experiment was arranged in a randomized block
design with four replications. Fertilization was the same
in both soils with 150 mg kg-1 of P using monoammonium
phosphate (MAP) as source and 120 mg kg-1 of K using
potassium chloride as source. The micronutrients Zn, B,
Cu and Fe were provided by using 1g of silicate oxides
(FTE BR12) per pot. N was supplied by MAP and seeds
were inoculated with aerobic bacteria of the species
Rhizobium melilotti for symbiotic N fixation.

Soil moisture was kept at approximately 70% of the
field capacity by weekly weighing. The treatments were
incubated for 30 days; then, the soil from each pot was
collected for fertility analyses (Raij et al., 2001) and Si
determination (Korndorfer et al., 2004). Alfalfa was sown

after the soil sampling. Twelve alfalfa plants were kept per
pot until the end of the experiment. Water loss through
evapotranspiration was replaced according to each plant’s
needs, by in loco observation of each pot.

At 60 days after planting, when the plants showed at
least 10% of the first flowers, the first cutting was done at
10 cm above the soil. Shoot dry matter (DM) was
determined and the plant material was subjected to the
chemical analysis as described by Malavolta et al. (1997)
and silicon by Korndorfer et al. (2004).

After the plant cutting, soil samples were collected
from each pot for analyses of pH, Ca, Mg and BS% (Raij
et al., 2001), using a small screw auger in three points of
the pot not to damage the plants. At 90 days after planting,
the second plant cutting was performed and the whole
shoot was collected. The same procedure of the first
cutting was used to determine DM and the chemical
analysis.

Data were examined by analysis of variance (F test)
and when there was a significant difference among the
treatments, the means were compared by the t test (LSD)
at 5% probability.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Slag reactivity rate (RR) obtained experimentally were
higher than the laboratory RR (Table 1). Therefore, the
values of experimental ECC were higher than those
determined in the laboratory, hence, the slag rate applied
by the experimental method was lower. However, in the
Alfisol Ferrudalfs, the slags applied using the experimen-
tal ECC were similar to limestone in increasing the pH and
base saturation, before and after the first cutting (Table
3). When applied with the laboratory ECC, the slags kept

the values of base saturation higher than those obtained
with wollastonite and limestone, 30 days after application
in the Alfisol Ferrudalfs.

The results were different for the Rhodic Hapludox,
showing that the reactivity of the correctives varies
according to the soil type. In the Rhodic Hapludox,
laboratory ECC of the slags were similar to limestone
and wollastonite in the two trials, and the experimental
ECC of the slags had lower pH and Base saturation
(Table 3).

The base saturation calculated with the experimental
ECC was far below the required value, which implies that
the relative efficiency of reactivity determined by the
Brazilian legislation are appropriate for slag and
consequently for the ECC calculation.

Base saturation of 80 % was not reached with the
treatments. The closest values were obtained at 30 days
of incubation, when laboratory ECC of slags and limestone
were used, decreasing after the first alfalfa cutting. Prado
&amp;amp; Natale (2004) reported a similar result in a study with
ferrochrome steel slag applied twice as much as the rate
required to raise the base saturation to 80 %; however,
the base saturation reached only 66 %. Prado &amp;amp; Natale
(2005) used calcium silicate to increase base saturation to
50 %, but obtained only 46%. Araújo et al. (2009), studying
limestone with different reactivity levels, obtained base
saturation up to 60% when liming was calculated to reach
80%. The authors attributed this result to the soil buffering
effect. Soil mineralogy may influence the soil buffering
effect and hinder the increase of base saturation (Silva et
al., 2008).

The increase in Ca content in the soil Rhodic Hapludox
was higher with silicate, 30 days after the corrective
application (Table 3). However, at 90 days, the Ca content
was reduced due to the alfafa cultivation and there was
no significant difference between limestone and silicates
(Table 3). The results obtained for the soil reflected in the
plant, and, overall, we observed that silicates provided

greater calcium accumulation than limestone in alfalfa
shoots (Table 4).

Limestone and slag 2 (laboratory ECC) were the most
effective to provide Mg to the soils and plant
accumulation (Tables 3 and 4). The chemical composition
of the correctives (Table 1) shows that the slag 1 has
MgO content very similar to limestone and higher than
that of slag 2; however, this was not reflected on the
exchangeable Mg contents in the soils, which indicates
that slag 1 was less efficient to solubilize Mg to the
exchangeable form.

Regardless of the treatments, the pH, Ca and Mg
contents and base saturation decreased with alfalfa
cultivation. Soil re-acidification may be attributed to
proton exudation due to cation absorption by the
plants, in addition to the fact that Ca and Mg were
supplied for acidity correction only at the beginning of
the experiment.

Besides the corrective effect, studies on the use of
slag in agriculture are on the rise because slag is a silicon
source. There are several reports in the literature related
to Si increase in crops with the use of steel slag, such as
in rice crops (Barbosa Filho et al., 2004) and sugarcane
plantations (Sousa et al., 2010).

Slag application significantly increased the Si content
in soils as compared to limestone (Table 5). The Si content
was similar in the different slags studied (Table 1).
However, slag 2 was more efficient for Si availability in

soils, with higher accumulation in the plant when it was
cultivated in the Alfisol Ferrudalfs (Table 5). According to
Pereira et al. (2004), slag may show differences in Si
solubility, depending on the type of steel produced and
the type of furnace used to produce it.

The similarity between limestone and slag 1 in plant Si
accumulation in the Alfisol Ferrudalfs is attributed to the
similar DM content between the treatments. Si

accumulation was lower in the second cutting than in the
first one for all treatments because of its lower DM
production (Table 4).

Silicates provided the greatest P accumulation
compared to limestone for alfalfa cultivated in the
Rhodic Hapludox (Table 4). Corrêa et al. (2008) and
Sobral et al. (2011) reported that the growing use of
slag in agriculture is because silicate anions in slag

compete with P for the same adsorption sites when they
are adsorbed, preventing or hindering P adsorption.

One advantage of silicate over limestone is its ability
to make micronutrients available in the soil (Sobral et al.,
2011). When slag is used to neutralize soil acidity, the
reduction in micronutrient availability due to the increased
pH is minimized because steel slag has micronutrients in
its chemical composition (Prado et al., 2002).

Slag has several metal oxides in its chemical
composition, among them Mn (Prado et al., 2001), which
may have influenced the Mn content in the soil (Table 6)
and was reflected in plant accumulation (Table 7).

Although Mn content in the soil with the application
of slag 1 may be considered high (Raij et al., 1996), no
toxicity in alfalfa plants was observed in the current study.
Possibly because the Si made available to the plant
through slag application minimized the toxicity caused by
Mn. The reduction in toxicity of Mn and other metals
caused by the action of Si in plants was also reported by
Iwasaki et al. (2002). According to El-Jaoual &amp;amp; Cox (1998),
the mechanism consists of avoiding the adsorption and
translocation of the elements to the shoot or improving
their distribution in the plant.

There was significant difference between the
correctives for the micronutrients Cu, Fe and Zn in the
Rhodic Hapludox and Fe and Zn in the Alfisol Ferrudalfs
(Table 7) showing higher contents with the application of
slags.

Slags provided higher DM means than limestone for
both cuttings in the Rhodic Hapludox (Table 4). Its
positive effect on DM production may be attributed to
the greater supply of Ca, P and Si from the steel slag,
since the acidity correction occurred with the application
of both correctives, limestone and silicates.

The increase in DM production with the use of slag
corroborates Fonseca et al. (2009), who applied slag and
limestone rates to produce marandu grass. The increase
in DM production is explained by the silicon content in
the slag, which makes the leaves more upright and, thus,
enhance the ability to absorb sunlight and process
photosynthesis (Korndorfer et al., 2002)

CONCLUSION

The methods to determine limestone ECC can be
applied for steel slag. Slag application corrected soil acidity
with consequent accumulation of Ca, P, and Si in alfalfa
plants, favoring the DM production.
