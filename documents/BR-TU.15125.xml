RESUMO 

O biovidro ativo é um biomaterial promissor que tem mostrado 

excelentes efeitos osteogênicos, angiogênicos e antibacterianos para ser 

aplicado em procedimentos de reparação óssea em diversas áreas. Em 

implantologia oral, infecções podem ocorrer após procedimentos 

cirúrgicos em decorrência da presença de biofilmes orais incluindo 

espécies patogênicas. Sendo assim, este trabalho teve como principal 

objetivo desenvolver biomateriais à base de um biovidro nano-

estruturado para incorporação de compostos com potencial anti-

biofilme. O biovidro ativo 58S foi modificado incorporando brometo, 

compostos derivados do cranberry e da própolis na sua estrutura. As 

amostras foram caracterizadas por meio de análise química, textural e 

física. O potencial anti-biofime do biovidro ativo foi determinado 

através de q-PCR e análise microscópico. A reatividade química foi 

avaliada por meio de análise química, microscópica e da proporção 

Ca/P. As amostras do biovidro ativo incorporando brometo, cranberry 

PACS e própolis mostraram uma distribuição de tamanho de partículas, 

estrutura física e composição química apropriadas. O biovidro ativo 

modificado com 5wt% CaBr2 inibiu a proliferação de S. mitis, V. 

parvula, P. gingivais, S.gordoni, A. viscosus, e F. Nucleatum. Uma 

significativa formação de hidroxiapatita carbonatada foi revelada nas 

amotras do biovidro ativo mesoporoso incorporando cranberry PACS e 

própolis após 72 h de imersão na solução corporal simulada. Por 

conseguinte, a incorporação de compostos inorgânicos e orgânicos no 

biovidro ativo 58S pode ser uma estratégia para potencializar seu efeito 

anti-biofilme e ser aplicado em tratamentos de reparo e infecção óssea.

ABSTRACT 

Bioactive glass is an attractive biomaterial that has shown excellent 

osteogenic, angiogenic and antibacterial effects for bone healing. One of 

the main issues regarding oral surgery and bone grafting procedures are 

the recurrent infections caused by oral biofilm involving pathogenic 

species. Thus, the main aim of the present study was to produce porous 

bioactive glasses incorporating inorganic and organic compounds in 

their chemical and physical structure to enhance anti-biofilm potential 

during bone repairing procedures. The modified 58S bioactive glasses 

embedded bromide, cranberry PACS and propolis compounds and were 

characterized through physical, chemical and textural analysis. 

Bioactive glass multispecies antibiofilm potential was evaluated by q-

PCR analysis and microscopic observation. Chemical reactivity of the 

samples was examined through chemical, microscopic and Ca/P ratio 

analysis. Bioactive glasses embedding bromide, cranberry PACS and 

propolis showed an appropriate particle size distribution, chemical and 

physical properties. Bioactive glass embedding 5wt% CaBr2 inhibited S. 

mitis, V. parvula, P. gingivais, S.gordoni, A. viscosus, and F. nucleatum 

proliferation. A significant hydroxyl-carbonate apatite layer was 

revealed by mesoporous BG samples incorporating cranberry PACS and 

propolis compounds after immersion in simulated body fuid for 72 h. 

The incorporation of inorganic and organic compounds into bioactive 

glass structure can be a strategy to enhance its antibiofilm potential for 

bone healing and infection treatment procedures.

1 INTRODUÇÃO 

No ano 2012, foi estimado que nos Estados Unidos mais de meio 

milhão de pacientes foram submetidos a cirurgias de enxerto ósseo por 

ano, representando um custo acima de 2,5 bilhões de dólares anuais. 

Espera-se que para o ano 2020 este número de pacientes seja o dobro 

devido ao aumento de expectativa de vida da população mundial 

(AMINI; LAURENCIN; NUKAVARAPU, 2012).  Além do referido, o 

osso é o segundo tecido mais transplantado no mundo depois do sangue 

(JONES, 2013). 

Em decorrência do mencionado, a engenharia tecidual se encontra 

constantemente pressionada pela extensa demanda de cirurgias de 

enxertia óssea. Na área bucal e maxilofacial, procedimentos de enxerto 

ósseo para o reparo e regeneração dos tecidos são utilizados 

frequentemente. Por conseguinte, a procura para desenvolver um 

biomaterial ?ideal? para substituir os tecidos ósseos é um tema de 

grande interesse e vários anos de pesquisa.   

Atualmente, os enxertos de origem autógena removidos de um 

leito doador do próprio paciente, são considerados o ?padrão ouro? da 

enxertia por ter as características desejadas de osteoindução e 

osteocondução. No entanto, a alta demanda de procedimentos de 

enxertia na região oral dificulta a utilização de osso de origem autógena 

de todos os enxertos devido a fatores limitantes como a necessidade de 

uma área doadora com um volume apropriado, envolvimento de um 

procedimento cirúrgico adicional e aumento da morbidade do paciente 

por ser submetido a um maior número de intervenções. Por outro lado, 

os aloenxertos, removidos e transplantados entre indivíduos de uma 

mesma espécie com características genéticas diferentes, já foram mais 

utilizados no passado. Atualmente são conhecidas desvantagens como a 

reabsorção precoce, potencial de transmissão de proteínas antigênicas e 

doenças infecciosas e a necessidade de um banco de ossos. Por este 

motivo, a engenharia tecidual tem desenvolvido por vários anos diversos 

materiais metálicos, cerâmicos e poliméricos a fim de substituir os 

tecidos ósseos perdidos, considerando que a utilização desses materiais 

depende de propriedades essenciais como a biocompatibilidade, 

bioatividade, estabilidade física e química e propriedades mecânicas 

similares aos tecidos perdidos. Assim, os principais materiais 

aloplásticos cerâmicos que têm sido desenvolvidos a fim de ter as 

características mencionadas são a hidroxiapatita, o beta fosfato tricálcio, 

o fosfato de cálcio bifásico e os biovidros ativos (CRUZ et al., 2006). 

No entanto a procura do biomaterial ?ideal? para substituir o tecido 



28 

ósseo é um constante desafio que a engenharia tecidual enfrenta 

atualmente, já que ainda não existe um biomaterial com as propriedades 

biológicas do tecido autógeno e que contenha biomoléculas capazes de 

induzir a formação óssea (JONES, 2013).  

Além dos fatores biológicos, químicos e mecânicos de um 

biomaterial ?ideal?, a capacidade antibacteriana e antibiofilme é uma 

característica adicional desejada e requerida nos procedimentos de 

enxertia óssea. A incidência de infecção óssea pós-operatória é 

considerável e é uma complicação frequente das cirurgias orais 

envolvendo enxertia óssea (EL-KADY et al., 2012b; XIE et al., 2009).  

As bactérias organizadas no biofilme  são as protagonistas de 80% das 

infecções humanas (DAVIES, 2003). De modo que a utilização de 

antibiótico terapia é frequente para a prevenção de infecções secundárias 

neste tipo de procedimentos, no entanto o antibiótico não é sempre 

capaz de induzir um efeito efetivo no tecido ósseo infectado já que não 

atua de forma local e atua em uma área com pouca vascularização. 

Adicionalmente,  as bactérias organizadas em biofilme são mil vezes 

mais resistentes ao antibiótico comparadas com as bactérias planctônicas 

(DAVIES, 2003; GALARRAGA-VINUEZA et al., 2017). Assim, um 

biomaterial com propriedades antibiofilme seria capaz de atuar de 

maneira mais eficaz e local na área enxertada infectada.  No entanto, 

poucos materiais têm demostrado capacidade antibacteriana e 

antibiofilme consistente. 

 O biovidro ativo desenvolvido no ano 1969, aplicado em mais de 

um milhão de pacientes no mundo para procedimentos de regeneração 

óssea (HOPPE; GÜLDAL; BOCCACCINI, 2011; JONES, 2013), é um 

biomaterial capaz de inibir o crescimento bacteriano através da liberação 

de íons que elevam o pH do meio e criam um ambiente pouco favorável 

para o crescimento bacteriano (ALLAN; NEWMAN; WILSON, 2002; 

KRISHNAN; LAKSHMI, 2013). Esta característica ambiciosa do 

biovidro, além das suas outras propriedades de promover a osteogênese 

e angiogênese tem posicionado o biovidro ativo como um biomaterial 

promissor (JONES, 2013). Certamente, a capacidade antibacteriana do 

biovidro ativo é de fundamental importância por ter um efeito local 

desejado no leito cirúrgico (BELLANTONE; COLEMAN; HENCH, 

2000; HENCH, 2006). Entretanto, o efeito antibiofilme dos biovidros 

ativos não foi elucidado nem confirmado nos últimos estudos 

(GALARRAGA-VINUEZA et al., 2016), razão pela qual diversas 

pesquisas têm mudado a composição e a estrutura do biovidro ativo a 

fim de conseguir uma maior capacidade antibacteriana e antibiofilme 

(HUM; BOCCACCINI, 2012). Diferentes avanços têm sido 



29 

apresentados como a incorporação de agentes antibacterianos na 

composição química ou estrutura física do biovidro ativo. Deste modo, 

compostos de prata, céria, selênio, flúor, entre outros têm sido 

adicionados na fórmula química do biovidro ativo a fim de melhorar sua 

capacidade antibacteriana e antibiofilme (MALAVASI et al., 2012; 

STEVANOVI? et al., 2015; XU et al., 2015). Por outro lado, a 

tecnologia nano tem mudado a estrutura deste material adicionando 

surfactantes (XIA; CHANG, 2006) na sua fórmula para induzir a 

formação de poros convertendo assim o material num biovidro ativo 

mesoporoso que tem a capacidade de incorporar nos seus nano poros 

substâncias antibacterianas e antibiofilmes como antibióticos, nano 

partículas bioativas e compostos naturais orgânicos (EL-GHANNAM; 

AHMED; OMRAN, 2005; JIA et al., 2010; PRABHU et al., 2014; XIA 

et al., 2008).  

Considerando que ainda não existe um consenso, assim como 

estudos suficientes esclarecendo que tipo de compostos têm efeito 

antibiofilme, o objetivo do presente estudo foi desenvolver e avaliar a 

capacidade antibiofilme do biovidro ativo 58S incorporando compostos 

orgânicos e inorgânicos na sua estrutura química e física.  De tal modo, 

a hipótese do presente estudo é que a incorporação de agentes 

inorgânicos e orgânicos no biovidro ativo potencializará seu efeito 

inibitório do biofilme oral. 

Por conseguinte, o presente manuscrito está divido em três partes, 

sendo a primeira uma revisão da literatura da incorporação de agentes 

antibacterianos e antibiofilmes no biovidro ativo, a segunda descrevendo 

a capacidade antibiofilme do biovidro ativo modificado com brometo de 

cálcio e a terceira mostrando o desenvolvimento e bioatividade do 

biovidro ativo mesoporoso incorporando compostos de origem natural.

Abstract:  

Bioactive glasses (BGs) are promising materials for bone repair due to 

their desirable properties such as osteoconductivity, biodegradability, 

angiogenic potential, and antibacterial activity. Ionic dissolution 

products from bioactive glasses increase the medium pH inhibiting 

surrounding bacteria proliferation. The activity of BGs against biofilm 

formation has been enhanced by incorporating organic antibacterial 

compounds. The aim of this review was to summarize evidence in 

literature which assesses the efficacy of antibacterial and anti-biofilm 

compounds embedded in bioactive glasses to prevent peri-implant 

infection during bone healing. A PubMed bibliographical research was 

carried out including articles published in the last 20 years. Most 

previous studies evaluated antibacterial efficiency in planktonic cultures 

but did not investigate biofilm inhibition, underestimating biofilm 

clinical relevance. Multifactorial features such as biocompatibility of 

embedded compounds, receptor site characteristics, and drug delivery 



34 

efficiency have been found to influence the bioactive glass capability of 

acting both as an anti-biofilm agent and as a bone repairing biomaterial. 

Accordingly, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to select 

the most promising anti-biofilm agents which should be incorporated 

into bioactive glasses to counteract biofilm proliferation, without 

inducing toxic effects on human cells, and with the added functionality 

of promoting bone regeneration.  

Key Words: bioactive glass, mesoporous materials, antibacterial 

compounds, anti-biofilm activity, drug delivery system 

2.1 INTRODUCTION 

Bone is the second most transplanted tissue in surgical procedures 

worldwide with bone tissue engineering being investigated as a realistic 

alternative for bone healing [1]. Bone tissue engineering often relies on 

an engineered scaffold acting as a temporary extracellular matrix to 

support and deliver cells [2]. Bioactive glasses (BGs) involve a group of 

inorganic biomaterials discovered in the late 1960s that have been 

applied in bone repair due to their bioactivity, osteogenic, and 

angiogenic potential, biodegradability, and osteoconductivity [3]. BGs 

stimulate diverse biologic responses in contact with physiological fluids, 

such as the development of a carbonated hydroxyl-apatite (CHA) 

surface layer that is comparable to the mineral phase of bone and acts as 

an interface to enhance the attachment of bone cells. BGs also possess 

antibacterial potential due to their high surface reactivity and ion release 

capability [4, 5] causing high aqueous pH values in the surrounding 

tissues; however, such antibacterial effect has been reported to be 

restricted to certain planktonic bacteria [6–11]. Consequently, various 

approaches have been put forward for the incorporation of additional 

antibacterial compounds into BG compositions to enhance antibacterial 

and anti-biofilm activity, this being the subject of the present review.  

Biofilm is a multi-species agglomerate of microbial cells 

enclosed in a well-organized extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) 

matrix that adheres to soft and hard surfaces. The EPS matrix allows 

genetic information exchange and chemical signaling between microbial 

cells through a mechanism known as quorum sensing. Biofilms act as a 
biological barrier against therapeutic agents and host immune cells; 

retaining also nutrients from the environment [12,14]. Biofilms 

containing pathogenic species are reported to cause over 80% of human 

infections [12–14]. Oral biofilms adhere to different surfaces of 

prostheses, implants, mucosa, teeth, and bone. Biofilm formation is a 



35 

gradual process consisting of four distinct stages [13–15]: (a) acquired 

pellicle formation; (b) primary (early) colonization; (c) secondary 

colonization/ co-aggregation; and (d) mature biofilm establishment. The 

early colonization begins through binding primary bacteria to a 

conditioning film composed of glycoproteins, water and nutrients, that is 

previously established in the mouth. The first adherent oral bacteria 

(Streptococcus sanguinis, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. mitis, Actinomyces 

naeslundii, Capnocytophagaochraceae, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) are 

weakly and reversibly linked to glycoproteins named by adhesins, 

although they may remain and proliferate, starting the phenomena of 

microbial co-aggregation. Steptococcus species represent 60–80% of all 

primary colonizers. Such coaggregation is mediated by metabolic and 

genetic exchange known as quorum sensing. The secondary colonization 

occurs within 3–5 days after the beginning of the early colonization. In 

this process, the microorganisms start to multiply and to co-aggregate 

with partner species leading to the biofilm structural organization. 

Microorganisms organized in biofilms achieve a strong adherence to 

oral surfaces leading to a maturation process within 2–3 weeks [12–15]. 

 Previous studies have described that biofilms are about one 

thousand times more resistant to antibiotic therapy compared to free 

floating planktonic bacteria [12, 15]. In addition, studies have described 

that conventional systemic antibiotic therapy is not as effective as 

expected to eradicate bone infection because antibiotics do not act 

locally in septic areas and they may induce side effects in patients 

[13,16]. In the last decade, sol-gel derived mesoporous bioactive glasses 

(MBGs) have been developed with the purpose of becoming carriers for 

therapeutic agents acting as drug delivery systems [17–20]. 

Consequently, MBGs are advantageous candidates for both bone repair 

and peri-implant infection treatment since they combine unique 

properties to stimulate bone growth and prevent bacteria proliferation.  

The present review assesses antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy 

of BG carriers embedding organic compounds focusing on multifactorial 

parameters that can control antibacterial effects during bone healing. A 

PubMed electronic search including articles published in the last 20 

years was performed using the following combination of key words and 

MeSH terms: ?bioactive glass? or ?Bioglass? and ?antibacterial? or 

?anti-infective? or ?antibiotics? or ?antibacterial? or ?biofilm 

inhibition?. The selection criteria identified papers describing in vitro 

and in vivo studies, thus only articles that evaluated specifically 

antibacterial or anti-biofilm effects of bioactive glasses embedding 

antibacterial compounds were reviewed and discussed. The present 



36 

article is not intended to be comprehensive in terms of the number of 

studies included; it is rather a discussion article containing the relevant 

information found in key publications to provide the reader with initial 

points for further analysis.  

2.2 ORGANIC AGENTS INCORPORATED INTO BIOACTIVE 

GLASS  

In the last years, several studies have shown proper antibacterial 

properties achieved by different formulations of bioactive glasses 

incorporating several oxides [21–23] and the effects of biologically 

active ions on bone tissue engineering have been discussed in literature 

[24]. In addition, commercial products based on bioactive glass (melt-

derived, composition SiO2 53%, Na2O 23%, CaO 20%, P2O5 4%) are 

being successfully applied in the clinic to treat osteomyelitis [25] and 

the application of BGs to treat bone infections by the effect of pH 

increase is well demonstrated in literature [4,6,26,27]. Recent studies 

describe the incorporation of triclosan 28 into BG considering that this 

compound has already been applied in mouthwash solutions for clinical 

considerations involving biofilm-induced infections. Xu et al. reported 

in vitro antibacterial effects of 45S5 BG embedding triclosan against 

cariogenic S. mutans biofilm [29]. This study assessed anti-biofilm 

activity by pouring BG powders incorporating triclosan into wells 

containing S. mutans biofilm plaques that had undergone 6, 12, and 24 h 

of growth conditions. After 10 min of exposure, each coverslip 

containing biofilm was washed with PBS and centrifuged in saline 

solution. Subsequently, S. mutans biofilm was detached from the cover 

slips and then incubated in agar plates for 48 h at 37?C, simulating oral 
conditions. Biofilm viable colonies were counted and observed using a 

stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope. The study showed 

additive anti-biofilm effects when BG was combined with triclosan. 

Pertinently, this previous study focused on the assessment of anti-

biofilm activity rather than antibacterial effect against planktonic 

cultures. However, this broad-spectrum antibacterial agent is 

hydrophobic and can accumulate in human fatty tissues, breast milk, 

urine, and serum [30]. Furthermore, that synthetic organic agent has 

been reported to cause endocrine disruption in mammals, affecting the 

thyroid hormone reproduction and its homeostasis, [31] so that further 

research on triclosan containing BGs will have to investigate possible 

negative effect of its use.  



37 

Natural organic compounds derived from medicinal plants known 

as phytotherapeutics can promote both antibacterial and anti-

inflammatory activity [32]. The scientific interest in natural active 

compounds has increased for biomedical applications, since they are 

well-known health-promoting agents and produce minimum side effects. 

Essential oils derived from plants have numerous desirable properties 

being antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and having insecticide potential 

[33]. Regarding natural organic compounds as favorable antibacterial 

agents in combination with BGs, Prahbu et al. [34] studied the in vitro 

antimicrobial effect of BGs of composition (58SiO2-33CaO-9P2O5) 

incorporating neem plant (Azadirachta indica) leaf powder, a natural 
antiviral and antibacterial compound against a broad spectrum of 

bacteria [35]. BG nanoparticles (NPs) doped with neems leaf powder 

were analyzed by using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method and 

exhibited considerable antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. 

coli cultures. Additionally, neem doped BG NPs demonstrated superior 
antibacterial properties against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 

bacteria in comparison to those recorded for silver doped or pure BG 

NPs. Besides the beneficial antibacterial effect, neem-doped BG 

nanoparticles were analyzed by MTT assay and exhibited reduced 

cytotoxic effects. Results of that study established that neem doped BG 

was a biocompatible and potent antibiofilm agent for tissue engineering 

applications [34].  

An alternatiive approach toward incorporating natural organic 

compounds into BGs was performed by Bonfim et al. [36]. In this study, 

Brazilian red and green propolis were incorporated into BGs of 

composition (SiO2)0.80(P2O5)0.04(CaO)0.16. Propolis, a natural non-

toxic beehive agent found in honeycombs, has antifungal and antiviral 

properties as well as antibacterial activity against a wide range of cocci 

and Gram-negative rods [37]. Propolis solution was added during the 

BG sol-gel synthesis to obtain specimens for antimicrobial assays. The 

in vitro study reported growth inhibition on the following pathogenic 

species: S. aureus, E. faecalis, S. mutans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, 

P. gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans [36]. Accordingly, propolis 
is considered an antibacterial natural compound of high potential for 

future developments given its ability to inhibit bacterial adherence, 

prevent biofilm accumulation, and to reduce virulence factors of S. 
mutans [38]. Also, Propolis has been evaluated in previous studies 

showing a noncytotoxic nature [39, 40]. Grenho et al. [41] reported that 

propolis had antibacterial effectiveness and exhibited bioactive 



38 

characteristics such as stimulation of fibroblast migration, high cell 

metabolic activity, and absence of cell membrane damage. 

 Despite the success reported by some investigations mentioned 

above, organic compounds, especially natural derived agents like 

phytotherapeutics have not been largely explored to date in combination 

with BGs. Since BGs have the ability to incorporate both hydrophilic 

and hydrophobic groups in their structures, in vitro and in vivo studies 

involving natural organic compounds bound to BGs are expected to 

increase. Considering that various nature derived agents have reduced or 

non-cytotoxic effects [32–34,40] future investigations involving also 

clinical trials should be performed to identify the advantages and 

synergies brought by the combination of natural organic compounds and 

BGs to avoid peri-implant infections.  

2.3 BIOACTIVE GLASS AS AN ANTIBIOTIC DELIVERY 

SYSTEM  

In the last 15 years, BGs have been increasingly considered as 

vehicles for the local delivery of drugs, growth factors, and antibiotics 

[17–19, 42–45]. Tissue engineering approaches using BG scaffolds, 

which include a therapeutic drug or antibiotic delivery capability are 

based on multifunctional scaffolds, which are capable of releasing 

therapeutic substances against microbial infections in a controlled 

manner during the process of tissue repair [17, 42, 43, 45–48]. Systemic 

antibiotic therapy is not always effective to treat bone infections since 

there is vascular insufficiency and antibiotics may not arrive to infected 

areas through the blood stream. On systemic therapy, antibiotic 

biomolecules can be inactivated in the blood stream and may have no 

effect where they are needed at the implanted sites [8, 17]. In cases of 

bone repair procedures, there is a high incidence of infection and 

inflammatory response caused by host immune reactions. Attempting to 

solve implantation site complications, BG carriers with well-organized 

mesoporous structures are developed [18–20, 44, 45] which exhibit 

adjustable pore diameter and high surface area where antibiotics can be 

encapsulated for their controlled delivery. A previous study involving 

MBG reported a continuous release of gentamicin for six days inhibiting 

bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of S. aureus and S. epidermis, 

which are prevalent species at implant infections [44].  

Similarly, Xie et al. [46] preformed an in vivo study to evaluate 

the antibacterial effect of loaded gentamicin pellets composed of 

chitosan and borate-based BG. A bone tissue infection (osteomyelitis) 



39 

associated to Gram-negative bacilli was induced in a rabbit tibia model 

and then treated by the application of gentamicin-loaded BG pellets. 

Results from microbiological, radiographical, and histological assays 

stated an eradication of 81.82% infected cases. That study indicated that 

gentamicin-loaded BG pellets are attractive materials for osteomyelitis 

treatment. In addition, related in vivo studies performed by Nandi et 

al.[47] reported control of bone resorption in experimental osteomyelitis 

and consequent formation of lamellar bone by using cefuroxime axetil 

(CFA)-loaded MBG.  

The results of several studies have thus indicated that local 

antibiotic release from MBGs can be a solution to treat bone infection. 

Various antibiotics such as carbeinicillin, [48] ciprofloxacin, [49] 

tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), [50,51] vancomycin, [52,53] and 

teicoplanin [54] have been incorporated into BGs, as summarized in 

Table I. Nevertheless, biofilm infections at receptor sites are resistant to 

several antibiotics due to the presence of pathogenic species in well-

organized extracellular matrices [12]. Rastegar et al. [55] reported that 

P. aureginosa, a specie associated to the formation of biofilm on 

implanted devices, was resistant to carbenicillin, cotrimoxazole, 

ceftizoxime, gentamicin, and tetracycline in 95% of the cases of wound 

infections. On a comparative study of antibiotic resistance between 

planktonic bacteria and biofilm cultures, Olson et al. [13] found that the 

minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations of cloxacillin, amoxicillin, 

gentamicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin G, and ceftiofur were not 

able to eradicate biofilms formed by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. 

agalactiae, C. renale, and C. pseudotuberculosis. However, it was 

shown that planktonic cultures were susceptible to several antibiotics. 

Considering the clinical relevance of biofilm resistance to antibiotics, 

incorporating anti-biofilm compounds rather than antibiotics into BGs 

represents a more effective approach that should be explored more 

intensively in future. Further studies are required to understand and 

characterize factors involved in biofilm growth, microbial gene 

exchange, and bacteria communication to develop new anti-infective 

chemotherapies, which can involve BGs loaded with antibiofilm agents.

2.4 MULTIFACTORIAL ASPECTS INFLUENCING BIOACTIVE 

GLASS TO EMBED BIOFILM INHIBITORS  

Biofilms in infected implanted tissues have an unquestionable 

clinical significance; for that reason, clinical guidelines involving 

effective protocols and superior biomaterials must be established for 

infection management. It is remarkable that the majority of studies 

dealing with antibacterial materials does not mention or consider in 

detail antibacterial activity. In general, studies show proper antibacterial 

activity against planktonic bacteria. Those studies suggest that a 

?proper? antibacterial activity is necessary for should be considered for 

future medical applications in bone infection therapy [4, 56]. However, 

it can be considered a controversial issue if the antibacterial effect 

achieved in those studies is sufficiently effective to treat human 

infections [57]. Other previous studies have evaluated anti-biofilm 

activity against mono-species biofilm formation [29, 58]. Perez-Tanoira 

et al. for example, reported that S53P4 BG prevented bacterial and 

biofilm adhesion, however this study; nevertheless, this study tested 

solely staphylococcal biofilm inhibition. Other recent studies have tested 

anti-biofilm properties of compounds against multi-species biofilms. 

Bortolin et al [59] revealed that S53P4 BG was able to reduce biofilm 

composed of S. epidermis, A. baumanii, and K. pneumoniae. 
Furthermore, Drago et al. [60] reported that S53P4 BG revealed a 

relevant biofilm inhibition effect on S. aureus and P. aureginosa. In 

principle, even if studies that analyze antibiofilm effects are reliable; 

increased efforts involving in vivo studies are needed to simulate 

realistic human infection conditions.  

Human body infections, especially bone infections, are complex, 

and cannot be controlled by antibacterial effects solely. In general, bone 

infections are hard to treat due to diverse biological factors, notably 

vascular insufficiency, where systemic antibiotics and host immune cells 

are not able to reach the infected area through the blood stream.16 In 

addition, bone infections induced by multi-species biofilm formation 

increase antibiotic resistance and bacteria pathogenicity.12,15 

Accordingly, bone infection treatment should focus primarily on 

inhibiting biofilm formation [61]. Nowadays, there are limited effective 

therapies specifically targeting biofilm formation. Mechanical 

debridement for infected bone removal is the most accepted clinical 

procedure [16]. Therefore, if bone debridement could be complemented 

by the application of an efficient anti-biofilm agent, for example based 



44 

on mesoporous bioactive glasses as discussed in this review, such 

biomaterial will be a promising candidate for bone infection treatment, 

as schematically illustrated in Figure 1. 

 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram showing mesoporous BG loaded with 

antibacterial agents applied and delivered at infected implanted receptor sites 

with an acid medium to inhibit biofilm proliferation and repair bone defects. 

Another factor to consider is the type of active compound 

embedded into the BG carrier. As mentioned above, studies have been 

performed involving natural organic compounds such as essential oils 

and phototherapeutics as essential oils, which appear as valid 

alternatives for synthetic drugs [34, 36]. Consequently, new challenges 

have emerged to incorporate natural derived agents into BG 

compositions with the purpose of inducing antibacterial and health-

promoting effects at receptor sites. Additionally, MBGs with highly 

organized structure have been reported to favor angiogenic and 
osteogenic responses [17, 20, 62]. For this reason, promising future 

approaches should consider MBG advantages and develop mechanisms 

to encapsulate pharmacological agents based on phytotherapeutics into 

wellorganized MBGs to enhance bone repair, inhibit biofilm formation, 

and reduce toxic effects. Indeed understanding the synergetic effects of 



45 

the release of both therapeutic ions and organic antibacterial agents 

remains a subject of high interest for future studies.  

In this context, identifying parameters that influence the 

performance of MBGs as drug carriers is crucial to improve their action 

in infected receptor areas. Bone receptor surgical sites are inflammatory 

acidic areas where local acidosis increases due to the presence of 

bacterial metabolism byproducts like fatty acids and lactic acid 

produced infiltrated neutrophils [63]. MBG based drug delivery systems 

could take advantage of this acidic condition when applied on infected 

receptor areas and become a pH sensitive drug delivery structure, as 

schematically shown in Figure 13, [64]. Previous studies have shown 

that gentamicin released from MBG is pH dependent. Xia et al.64 

reported MBGs as dual drug delivery systems where individual drugs 

could be released at different rates depending on the pH values of the 

surrounding area. Also, another study [65] established that gentamicin-

loaded MBG exhibited drug release sensitive to the pH and the ionic 

composition of the surrounding medium. Consequently, significant 

features from receptor implanted sites such as biofilm accumulation and 

infiltrated inflammatory cells should be considered in forthcoming 

studies to enhance the capabilities of BGs as controlled delivery systems 

for anti-infective agents that can possess continuous action and efficient 

release.  

2.5 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK  

The majority of the reviewed scientific literature in the field of 

antibacterial materials has focused on in vitro and in vivo assays in 

specific models. Furthermore, most of the studies assessed antibacterial 

efficiency in planktonic bacteria cultures, which do not mimic a genuine 

infected tissue environment. Underestimation of biofilm significance in 

bone infection and repair procedures is a matter of concern, since studies 

may represent unrealistic conditions and they could be assessing 

antibacterial agents that may be inefficient or do not have the desired 

effects in future clinical applications. In fact, diverse multifactorial 

features influence the bioactive glass capability of being simultaneously 

an antibacterial, antibiofilm, and repairing biomaterial. Such factors 

involve incorporation of different biocompatible organic compounds 

with antibacterial and anti-biofilm potential, evaluation of receptor site 

conditions, drug delivery efficiency, and understanding synergetic 

effects with the intrinsic metallic ion release capability of BGs in the 

context of osteogenic and angiogenic response. The mentioned 



46 

characteristics can improve BGs making them biomaterials of choice for 

bone infection treatment and bone repair applications. In this context, 

further comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies applying mesoporous 

bioactive glass incorporating effective anti-biofilm compounds at 

infected receptor sites are required.

Abstract:  

Bioactive glass is an attractive biomaterial that has shown excellent 

osteogenic and angiogenic effects for oral bone repairing procedures. 

However, anti-biofilm potential related to such biomaterial has not been 

completely validated, mainly against multi species biofilms involved in 

early tissue infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 

anti-biofilm effect of 58S bioactive glass embedding calcium bromide 

compounds at different concentrations. Bioactive glass containing 0, 5, 

or 10wt% CaBr2 was synthesized by alkali sol-gel method and then 

characterized by physco-chemical and scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM). Then, samples were tested by microbiological assays using 

optical density, real time q-PCR, and SEM. Bioactive glass particles 

showed accurate chemical composition and an angular shape with a 

bimodal size distribution ranging from 0.6 to 110 µm. The mean particle 

size was around 29 µm. A significant anti-biofilm effect was recorded 



56 

for 5wt% CaBr2-doped bioactive glass against S. mitis, V. parvula, P. 

gingivais, S. gordoni, A. viscosus, and F. nucleatum. Such species are 

involved in the biofilm structure related to infections on hard and soft 

tissues in the oral cavity. The incorporation of calcium bromide into 

bioactive glass can be a strategy to enhance the anti-biofilm potential of 

bioactive glasses for bone healing and infection treatment.   

Key words: Bioactive glass, anti-biofilm, bromide, sol-gel synthesis,

3.1 INTRODUCTION  

Bioactive glass (BG) is a promising biomaterial developed 40 

years ago by the American scientist Larry Hench who produced the first 

BG of 45S5 composition with the purpose of repairing human bone 

defects and derived infections [1,2]. Previous studies have widely shown 

the outstanding properties on 45S5 BG, such as stimulation of 

osteogenic cell migration, vascularization, dissolution in bone tissue, 

and antibacterial effects induced by ion release [3]. In the 90s, a 

bioactive glass named 58S was developed via sol-gel method, in order to 

obtain an alternative compound with similar properties to those recorded 

for 45S5. Sepulveda et al. showed that melt-derived 45S5 BG powders 

exhibited lower dissolution rates for hydroxyapatite formation in 

comparison to those on 58S sol gel-glass powder [4]. Accordingly, 

hydroxyapatite is fundamental for bone healing and remodeling. Thus, 

the formation of a carbonated hydroxyl-apatite (CHA) layer establishes 

a bioactive interface between bone and BG surface, mimicking the 

mineral phase of bone, that also induces osteogenic cell proliferation, 

resulting in a desired biological match between BG particles and human 

tissues [1,5,6]. Nonetheless, proper bioactive response is only one of the 

purposes of a bioactive material. Bone infection occurs in the range of 

1-2.5% being an issue of orthopedic and oral surgeries [5,7,8]. In fact, 

biofilms are responsible for more than 80% of human infections [9,10] 

which influence the clinical use of antibiotics after surgical procedures.  

The antibacterial effect revealed by BG has been attributed to the 

ion release capability in increasing the pH of the surrounding medium 

that can affect planktonic bacteria growth [11]. Most of the studies 
report that the BG antibacterial effect against specific planktonic 

bacteria do not reflect realistic conditions of biofilm growth and 

pathogenicity at infected areas [12–16]. Biofilm is a well-organized 

microbial community embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix 



57 

composed of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins and water, that 

adheres to different surfaces  

such as teeth, rehabilitation synthetic materials, bone, and soft 

tissues [17,18]. As a result of a complex well-organized structure, 

bacteria embedded in biofilm is 1000 times more resistant to antibiotic 

therapy compared to planktonic bacteria [9,12]. Additionally, studies 

have shown that biofilm formation may enhance virulence of certain 

pathogenic bacteria like P. gingivais [19], S. mitis, F. nucleatum, A. 
viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and V. parvula [20].  In an attempt 

in improving BG antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity, several studies 

have reported positive antibacterial properties achieved by bioactive 

glasses embedded with inorganic compounds containing silver, cerium, 

selenium, magnesium, zinc, or fluoride [14,15,21–24]. Bromine, a 

chemical element corresponding to the halogen group, has been poorly 

explored in tissue engineering applications. One study reports the 

application of 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB) 

monomer as an antibacterial agent embedded in resinous biomaterials. 

That previous study reported an effective antibacterial and anti-biofilm 

activity of MDPB against S. mutans species over a period of 60 s. That 

was attributed to the inhibition of an enzyme named lactate 

dehydrogenase activitywhich is responsible for the S. mutans 

metabolism [25].  

Nevertheless, there are no studies reporting the incorporation of 

CaBr2-based compounds in BG composition to enhance its antibacterial 

activity. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce a 

bioactive glass embedding calcium bromide as an innovative strategy to 

inhibit biofilm formation avoiding infections at bone and surrounding 

tissues. The null hypothesis of this study was that the presence of 

bromide does not affect the multi-species biofilm growth on 58S 

bioactive glass.    

3.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS    

The methodology applied in this study to synthesize and analyze 

58S bioactive glass embedding CaBr2 is represented in Figure 1. First, 

BG (58 wt% SiO2, 33 wt% CaO, 9 wt% P2O5) powder was processed by 

sol-gel method following a previous study performed by the authors 

[26]. For that, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (98%, Sigma Aldrich, 

USA), triethyl phosphate (TEP) (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich, USA) and 

calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) (Vetec, Brazil) were used 

as precursors of silicon, phosphorous and calcium oxide, respectively. 



58 

Nitric acid (HNO3, 68%, Vetec, Brazil) was used to dissolve 

Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and to adjust pH solution while ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 

P.A., Synth, Brazil) was used to dissolve TEOS and TEP. Molar ratio of 

SiO2, P2O5 and CaO was calculated, concerning the BG58S proportion. 

TEOS and TEP were placed in a glass recipient containing EtOH under 

magnetic stirring at 25 
o
C for 10 min. Ca(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 

2 M HNO3 and then added to water at a molar ratio TEOS:H2O of 1:4. 

For bromide doped BG58S samples, calcium bromide hydrate 

(CaBr2.xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added as bromide precursor to 

achieve 5 or 10 wt% CaBr2. Considering the stoichiometric relation of 

calcium bromide, calcium nitrate quantity was calculated to maintain the 

final amount of 33wt% CaO. The mixtures were added to the solution 

and stirred for 1 h. Solution was placed in a chamber at 70 °C for drying 

over a period of 24 h. Subsequently, the material was thermally treated 

at 600 °C and milled in planetarium ball mill (PM100, Retsch, 

Germany) at 400 rpm for 1 h, to obtain the bioactive glass powder.  BG 

powders were deagglomerated in a mortar agate with acetone. Then, BG 

powders were sieved at 106 µm and pressed at 80 MPa to obtain small 

discs of 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness. Thermal treatment was 

performed at 1150ºC, by 10 ºC/min heating rate and 180 min of holding 

time.

Physico-chemical and morphological analyses  

An initial chemical analysis was performed by energy dispersive 

X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Swift 2000, Hitachi, Japan). The compound 

composition was obtained by rearranging the quantity of oxygen to 

calculate the weight percentage of oxides using the most stable 

stoichiometric arrangement, resulting in a reliable tool to semi-quantify 

the respective oxides. To evaluate the density of the sintered samples, 

the Archimedes Principle was applied to measure the relative density of 

the discs in green and after thermal treatment at 1150 ºC. The particle 

size distribution was measured in a laser diffraction equipment 

(Mastersizer 2000, Malvern, UK). The powder was introduced in a wet 

dispersion unit with low water rotation around 1200 rpm to avoid any 

deagglomeration of the sample. Before microbiological assays, the 

morphologic aspects of the BG particles as well as the surfaces of the 

test samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 



60 

(TM3030, Hitachi, Japan) at 15 kV by back-scattering electron (BSE) 

mode. Samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to SEM analysis. 

The roughness values of the disc samples were obtained regarding Rt 

(maximum height between peak and valley) and Ra roughness 

parameter that consists in the arithmetic mean value between the peak 

and valley height values in the effective roughness profile. The Ra 

roughness was recorded at five different areas on each material (n=25) 

using an optical profilometer (Zygo, NewView, 7300, USA). The 

measurement length was 0.7 mm and cut off at 0.25 mm for 3 s. 

Afterwards, a color map and 3D model representation of the surface 

roughness was performed per each sample using the Mountain map 

Software (Digital Surf, France).  The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis 

was performed on the powder and thermal treated samples to evaluate 

the presence of crystalline phases in the amorphous matrix of the 

bioactive glass. The samples were analyzed in a diffractometer (D8 

Discover, Bruker, Germany) by using Cu K? radiation (? = 1.5406 Å) 

on theta-2 theta mode. The range of analyzed angles was at 10-70º, with 

a step size of 0.04º and 1 s of step time. The peaks for each phase were 

identified using X’Pert High Score Plus Software (Panalytical, USA) 

within JCPDS patterns database.   

Biofilm growth conditions  

Bioglass discs with different concentrations of CaBr2 (0%, 5% or 

10%), were tested against a multi-species biofilm, grown in a bioreactor 

(BIOSTAT® B, Germany) simulating the oral conditions as illustrated 

Figure 1. The multi-species form included 10 strains as follow: 2 early 

colonizer bacterial species (Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus 

gordonii), 5 pathogen bacterial species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, 
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus 

mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus) and 3 beneficial bacterial species 
(Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus salivarius). 

750ml of BHI II [27] 37 g/L containing brain heart infusion broth, 2.5 

g/L mucin from porcine stomach type III (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie 

GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland), 1g/L yeast extract, 0.1 g/L L-cysteine, 2 

g/L sodium bicarbonate was added to the bioreactor vessel.  Also, the 

calibration of pH electrode was performed with 1/10 HCl 1/10 and the 1 

molar NaOCl before the sterilization process. Yet, one vessel of 2L was 

prepared with fresh BHI II, in order to be able to refresh the growth 

medium twice a day, over the experiment period. After the sterilization 

process, the bioreactor was set-up with 300 rpm of stirring on anaerobic 



61 

condition at 37°C. Also, an anti-foam liquid was added before the 

overnight wait.  

Bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37°C in BHI under 

aerobic or anaerobic conditions, as described in the ATCC 

recommendations for each strain and then incubated in the bioreactor. 

After 24 h, the bioreactor medium was supplemented with 5 mg/L 

hemin, 1 mg/L menadione, and the absorbance of medium was adjusted 

to zero. After this procedure, the absorbance of the bacterial suspension 

was controlled to achieve the same optical density values prior to 

incubation in the bioreactor. Stable multi-species biofilm were obtained 

for 72 h. After this period, BG discs were placed at the bottom of 24 

well-plates. Each well containing a BG disc was filled-up with 900 µL 

fresh BHI and 100 µL bioreactor culture. The negative and positive 

control groups had pure bioglass discs. However, the negative control 

group received 900 µL fresh BHI and 100 µL bioreactor culture while 

the positive control group was tested with 400 µL chlorhexidine, 500 µL 

fresh BHI and 100 bioreactor culture.  The 24 well plates were 

incubated at 37°C under anaerobic conditions over a period of 24 h 

biofilm growth. Then, the supernatant was carefully removed with 

pipets, and therefore the discs were smoothly cleaned two times with 

300 µL PBS to withdrawn the weakly attached biofilm. The well-

attached biofilm was removed with 300 µL trypsin, into an anaerobic jar 

and maintained into the incubator for 15 min. The trypsin from each 

well was added to Eppendorf’s to be centrifuged and then the pellets 

were resuspended in 500 µL PBS. On such dilution, a vitality DNA 

extraction was performed using 10 µL PMA and 90 µL bacterial 

dilution in PBS. The real time q-PCR was performed in triplicate for 

each strain using the ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System platform 

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [28]. Data was exported to 

an excel sheet to analyze the amount of each strain into the biofilm. For 

microscopic analyses, discs covered with biofilms were washed two 

times in PBS and fixed in glutaraldehyde 2% for 5 min. Then, discs 

were washed three times in PBS, and dehydrated through a series of 

graded ethanol solutions (50, 70, 80, 90, 100%). Samples covered with 

biofilms were sputter-coated with gold, and analyzed by scanning 

electron microscopy.   

3.3 RESULTS    

The particle size distribution of BG58S particles revealed a 

bimodal distribution with particle size ranging from 0.6 up to 110 µm, 



62 

as seen in Figure 2. The mean particle size was around 29 µm. The 

chemical composition of 58S MBG powder particles was quite similar 

to the expected composition (58.2 ± 2 wt% SiO2, 33.01 ± 1 wt% CaO, 9 

± 1 wt% P2O5), as detected by EDX analyses. The EDX spectra of all 

compositions are shown in Figure 3. The EDX spectra showed the 

highest intensity peak for Si element. The intensity of Ca element is 

intermediary while the peak for P element was the lowest in the spectra. 

Furthermore, the bioactive glasses embedding CaBr2 revealed an 

increase in the Br peak with the increase of CaBr2 in the composition.  

 
Figura 2. 58S BG Bimodal particle size distribution 

XRD spectra for the powders and heat pressed 58S bioactive 

glass samples free of CaBr2 are shown in Figure 4 while XRD spectra 

for samples embedding CaBr2 are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The XRD 

spectra of the bioactive glass powders revealed a broad diffraction band, 

confirming its amorphous and glassy nature [4,31,32]. Moreover, peaks 

of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP), dicalcium silicate (DCS) and 

bromine oxide were identified that confirmed the success of the 

modified sol-gel synthesis. The increase of bromine phases was noticed 

with increasing of the amount of CaBr2 in the bioactive glass 

composition. Considering the crystalline phases, XRD peaks for calcium 

phosphate phases, wollastonite, pseudowollastonite and quartz were 

detected as tresult from the high heat treatment [32–36]. 



63 

Pseudowollastonite is a polymorph of wollastonite, that possesses a 

transition temperature around 1250 ºC. However, the excess of SiO2 

favors the formation of the pseudowollastonite at lower temperatures 

[35,36]. In the case of the XRD spectra for BG58S 5%CaBr2, the 

crystalline phases of quartz, tricalcium phosphate, wollastonite and 

phosphorus bromide were detected after 1150 ºC. The increase in the 

crystallization intensity of quartz can be explained by the decomposition 

of dicalcium silicate, in CaO and SiO2 [35,36]. Phosphorus bromide 

crystallizes from the decomposition of tetracalcium phosphate into ?-

tricalcium phosphate, releasing phosphates to react with bromine oxide 

[35, 36]. In the case of the XRD spectra recorded for BG58S CaBr2 

10wt%, calcium phosphate silicate, pseudowollastonite, wollastonite 

and silicon bromide phases were detected after thermal treatment at 

1150 ºC. That indicated that the silicon was not available to crystallize 

alone and therefore it reacted almost on totality with the bromine oxide 

to crystallize silicon bromide. That can be associated with the excess of 

CaBr2 in such chemical composition. However, the thermal treatment 

promoted the formation of pseudowollastonite and wollastonite [32, 35, 

36].

SEM images revealed 58S bioactive glass powder having an 

angular shape morphology that is typical from glass milling procedure 

(figure 7). BG58S samples containing CaBr2 5wt% before thermal 

treatment revealed needle like crystals typical from calcium phosphate 

phases [29]. Such crystals disappeared and formed angular lighter 

crystals like ?-Tricalcium phosphate after thermal treatment at 1150 ºC 

[30]. Surfaces of bromide-doped 58S BG discs revealed a rough 

morphologic aspect associated with the content of CaBr2 as shown in 

figure 7. Thus, the presence of CaBr2 seemed to affect the densification 

process of the bioactive glass. Thermal treatment performed at a higher 

temperature and longer holding time should promote an increase in 

atomic diffusion rates, leading to the formation of larger and structural 

ordered particles.

discs before (C, E and G) and after (D, F and H) thermal treatment 

incorporating 0, 5, and 10 wt % CaBr2 correspondingly  

The arithmetic average roughness (Ra) values and maximum 

height between peak and valley values (Rt) recorded on 58S BG discs 

increased with CaBr2 content as shown and illustrated in Figure 8.  The 

relative density of the samples were determined via Archimedes method 

before and after thermal treatment. Several thermal cycles were assessed 

at maximum temperature ranging from 600 up to 1250 oC in order to 

achieve a high density for the samples. A proper maximum temperature 

at 1150 ºC of thermal treatment was selected considering final shape and 

high density for microbiological assays. The relative density of the 

samples before the thermal treatment was higher than 50%. 



67 

Additionally, the relative density of those samples increased with the 

CaBr2 content. In a similar way, the sintered samples had a relative 

density of more than 74%, which increased directly with the CaBr2 

content, achieving around 95% relative density on the highest 

concentration of CaBr2 (Figure 9).

Biofilm Inhibition   

A significant biofilm inhibition, represented by the decrease of 

bacterial cell amount, was noticed when the chlorhexidine was placed in 

contact with the multi-species biofilm grown on the 58SBG discs free of 

CaBr2. That validated the antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine against 

all the early, beneficial and pathogenic species tested in this study. The 

amount of bacteria also decreased in the presence of 58SBG discs doped 

with 5% CaBr2 regarding S. mitis and S. gordonii (early colonizers), V. 
parvula and A. viscosus (beneficial species), and P. gingivalis 

(pathogenic species). However, no decrease of bacterial amount was 

detected for multi-species biofilm grown on 58S BG discs doped with 

10wt% CaBr2. Results of biofilm inhibition obtained by q-PCR analyses 

for early, beneficial, and pathogen bacteria are shown in Figures 10 and 

11.  SEM inspection of the 58S BG discs surfaces covered with multi-

species biofilms is shown in Figure 12. Considering the morphology of 

the multi-species biofilm tested in the present study, streptococcus, 

bacillus, and filamentous species can be detected on bioactive glass 

surfaces free or containing CaBr2 after 24h of multi-species biofilm 

growth (Fig. 12). The multi-species biofilm revealed similar 

morphological aspects on all the test samples inspected by SEM.

3.4 DISCUSSION   

The present study incorporated calcium bromide as a potential 

anti-biofilm compound into BG composition, which for the first time 

has been explored in tissue engineering applications. Accordingly, the 

results of this study has supported the hypothesis that BG modified with 

calcium bromide is able to inhibit different bacteria in multi-species oral 

biofilm revealed by real time q-PCR analysis. This study demonstrated 

an appropriate chemical and bimodal size distribution of BG particles 

and that BG samples embedding 5wt% CaBr2 had an anti-biofilm effect 

against early, beneficial and pathogen oral biofilm species.  
BG embedding 5wt% CaBr2 had a notorious anti-biofilm effect 

against species such as S. mitis, S. gordonii, A. viscosus, V. parvula, and, 

P. gingivalis. Conversely, no biofilm inhibition was distinguished for 
BG samples embedding 10wt% CaBr2, probably due to the higher 

roughness values revealed by the discs surfaces corresponding to this 



71 

experimental group. A high roughness seemed to affect negatively the 

anti-biofilm potential. Previous studies have reported that surfaces with 

higher roughness have more compatibility with biofilm adherence 

because bacteria is sheltered against shear forces. Additionally, biofilm 

adhesion area increases with the increment of roughness, which allows 

biofilm accumulation [39–41]. SEM analysis of biofilm adherence in the 

disk samples of this study did not show differences between the control 

and experimental groups; nevertheless, this is a qualitative analysis 

which only reveals the presence of certain species and is not as precise 

as q-PCR analysis.  

Furthermore, tissue engineering has been challenged to improve 

BG chemical composition considering biocompatibility and antibacterial 

effects. In the present study, the crystalline phases analysis revealed the 

presence of bioactive phases for bone healing such as tetracalcium 

phosphate and dicalcium silicate [32,34,37]. Regarding BG58S 5wt% 

CaBr2 processed at 1150 ºC, the XRD spectra (Fig 5) also revealed the 

presence of phosphorus bromide. Phosphorus tribromide is a compound 

used in pharmacology as an active compound of anti-inflammatory, 

analgesic and antipyretic reactions. Also, BG58S CaBr2 5wt% presented 

the crystal microstructures typical from calcium phosphates phases, 

which is an indication of a high bioactivity.   

Several previous studies have shown suitable antibacterial 

properties achieved by bioactive glasses doped with diverse oxides [10-

12]. However, possible toxic effects caused by metallic ions and 

particles embedded into BG are still a controversial concern for clinical 

applications. Most studies have tested antibacterial properties of 

modified bioactive glasses against planktonic bacteria solely [7,15,42]. 

Goh et al. reported that BG samples modified with 5 and 10 mol% 

cerium oxide demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against E. 
coli, evaluated by the quantitative viable count method [14]. 

Additionally, El-Kady et al. established in their study that all BG 

nanoparticles doped with 1, 3, 5, and 10wt% Ag2O had antibacterial 

effect against S. aureus and E. coli cultures evaluated by the disk 

diffusion method. That study attributed the high effective antibacterial 

effect to the presence of silver ions [13]. In contrast, Fooladi et al. stated 

that silver is not an essential component for inhibiting bacterial growth 

[24]. That study incorporated MgO into BG nanopowders and its 

antibacterial effect was assessed against E. coli, P. aureginosa, and S. 

aureus. The BG nanopowders at a greater concentration than 15.62 

mg/mL showed efficient inhibitory effects on the three bacterial strains. 

As well, selenium nanoparticles have also being added to BG as an 



72 

antibacterial agent. Stevanovic et al. showed in their study that BG 45S5 

with selenium nanoparticles had a significant antibacterial activity 

against S. aureus and S. epidermis cultures, and inhibited B. subtilis and 
K. pnuemoniae growth [23]. Fluorine has also being added to BG 

particles as an antimicrobial agent. Xu et al. showed in their study that 

BG particles mixed with sodium fluoride (NaF) had a significant S. 
mutans  biofilm inhibition effect after 24 hours of exposure. That study 

tested the anti-biofilm effect against one oral bacteria (monospecie 

biofilm); nevertheless, currently there are not enough studies testing 

modified bioactive glass against multi-species oral biofilms. Fluorides 

are known to inhibit bacterial enzymes like enolase and catalase. Also, 

compounds with fluorine may disrupt bacterial cell membranes and 

cytoplasm pH, and interfere glycolysis of cariogenic bacteria [15]. 

Bromine has many similar characteristics to fluorine although bromine 

has not being incorporated into BG composition as an antibiofilm agent 

in previous studies. Considering a lack of findings on the effect of Br 

based compounds, this study pursued the objective of testing bromide 

doped BG as a new repairing biomaterial to inhibit multispecies oral 

biofilm.   

The results of the present study are promising since bromide had 

an anti-biofilm effect against early, beneficial, and pathogen oral 

species. Nevertheless, future studies evaluating anti-biofilm properties 

of CaBr2 doped BG samples should take in consideration that samples 

characteristics, such as surface roughness are of extreme importance 

regarding biofilm adherence. One limitation of the present study was 

that samples of the tested groups had different surface roughness values; 

consequently, biofilm inhibition was evaluated under different 

circumstances in each study group.  

In addition, forthcoming studies should evaluate the 

biocompatibility and the hydroxyapatite formation capability of 

innovative bromide doped BG to be tested in future in vivo studies. 

Regarding the mechanism in which bromine acts as anti-biofilm agent, 

new studies should analyze how bromine ions are able to affect biofilm 

formation and additionally include clinical strains isolated from patients 

reporting infection in implanted sites to mimic conditions that are more 

realistic to clinical complications.    

3.5 CONCLUSION 

Within the limitations of this study, the main outcomes of this 

work are drawn as follow:  



73 

• The chemical composition of the CaBr2-doped bioactive 
was monitored and therefore the powder particles showed 

an angular shape and bimodal size distribution. That plays 

an important role on the clinical application in bone defects; 

• Considering microbiological assessment, bioactive glass 
doped with 5wt% CaBr2 had a considerable anti-biofilm 

effect against oral bacteria involved in a multi-species 

biofilm. Such findings are more representative concerning 

the aggregation pathways among different species when 

compared to mono-species methods related in literature. In 

fact, biomaterials embedding potential antibiofilm 

compounds must be tested against multi-species biofilms as 

reported in the present study  

• CaBr2-doped bioactive glass can be considered an 
advantageous anti-biofilm biomaterial for clinical 

applications and treatment of oral infections at implanted 

surgical sites. Notwithstanding, other bromide contents and 

compositions should be assessed by physicochemical and 

biological tests in further studies to clarify the anti-biofilm 

behavior of such enhanced bioactive glasses.

Abstract:  

Bioactive glasses are attractive materials for bone repairing procedures 

due to their desirable osteoconductive, angiogenic, osteogenic, and 

antibacterial properties.  In addition, the antibacterial properties of 

bioactive glass can be enhanced depending on the glass porous structure 

and chemical composition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 

the chemical reactivity of 58S mesoporous bioactive glass free or 

embedding propolis and cranberry antibiofilm compounds at different 

concentrations. Mesoporous 58S bioactive glass (MBG) was synthesized 

by alkali sol-gel method with the addition of the triblock pluronic 

copolymer P123 as surfactant. Samples were characterized by physco-

chemical properties measurement, N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, 

and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) 
observations. MBG powders were immersed into 5 and 10 µg/ml 

propolis or cranberry solutions for 24 h. The chemical reactivity of the 

specimens was evaluated by FESEM, EDX, FTIR and Ca/P analysis 

after being immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution for 8, 24 



80 

and 72 h. MBGs had the expected chemical composition with a particle 

size distribution ranging from 1.44 up to 955 µm, and a mean particle 

size of 154 µm. MBG particles exhibited a pore volume of 0.8 cc/g, a 

pore radius of about 2 nm and a surface area at 350.2 m
2
/g, according to 

BJH and BET analyses. A hydroxyl-carbonate apatite (HCAp) layer was 

formed on all samples after SBF immersion for 72 h. Pure MBG showed 

the highest chemical reactivity after 72 h and therefore the resulting 

apatite layer revealed a Ca/P ratio of 1.8, corresponding to non-

stoichiometric biological apatite. MGB embedding propolis and 

cranberry can be considered for future microbiological analysis since 

their modified composition did not interfere with the ability of MBG to 

develop a HCAp layer on its surface, which is an  essential property for 

bone regeneration applications.

4.1 INTRODUCTION  

More than 45 years ago, Hench et al. developed the first bioactive 

glass (BG) of composition: (46.1 mol.% SiO2, 24.4 mol.% Na2O, 26.9 

mol.% CaO and 2.6 mol.% P2O5); with the purpose of generating a 

biomaterial that could bond to bone fulfilling the requirements of 

orthopedic surgeries of the time[1]. After many years of bioactive glass 

intensive research, BGs have been demonstrated to be outstanding 

materials due to their desirable characteristics such as high bioactivity, 

osteogenic stimulation, angiogenic effect, ability to bond to soft tissues, 

high biocompatibility and antibacterial activity induced by its ion 

release capability [2–10]. It is well established that highly bioactive 

synthetic glasses bond to bone through the formation of a hydroxyl-

carbonate apatite (HCAp) layer which mimics the mineral phase of 

bone; thus, resulting in a biological match between BGs and bone 

tissues [3,10]. Certainly, bioactivity accomplished through a high 

chemical reactivity in contact with human tissues  is the most acclaimed 

property of bioactive glasses; nevertheless, new tissue engineering 

requirements have emerged besides this property to fulfill the necessities 

of surgical and regenerative procedures which include also applications 
in soft tissue repair [6,7,9].  

Several new BG compositions have been developed over the 

years to improve bioactivity and mechanical properties[6,10]. Recent 

advances have considered BG structures characterized by nano-porous 

organized arrangements, known as mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG), 



81 

which are developed by the sol-gel method [11–14]. MBGs exhibit large 

surface area with organized nano-porous channels which can induce a 

higher HCAp formation and allow the incorporation of bioactive 

molecules such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and vascular 

endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to induce osteogenesis and 

angiogenesis [12,14]. Furthermore, MBGs can act as drug delivery 

systems by the incorporation and release of antibiotics, antibacterial and 

antibiofilm compounds in their nano porous structure [11,12,14,15].  

Studies have reported that orthopedic and craniofacial surgeries 

have a considerable risk of postoperative bone infection and that bone 

implant associated infections are major complications of bone repairing 

procedures [4,5,16–18]. Systemic antibiotic therapy is the most common 

treatment of bone-associated infections. However, such therapy can 

cause a bacterial resistance of pathogenic species considering the 

formation of biofilms [14]. It should be highlighted that biofilms consist 

of a well-organized microbial community embedded in an extracellular 

polymeric matrix composed of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins 

and water  being  the main cause of implanted bone infections 

[17,19,20]. Bacteria organized in a multispecies biofilm is 1000 times 

more resistant to antibiotics when compared to planktonic bacteria [19]. 

Thus, BGs have been considered as favorable biomaterials to locally 

counteract grafted or implanted site infections due to their antibacterial 

effect accomplished by raising the pH of the medium, which affects 

planktonic bacterial growth [8]. Only few studies have reported the 

effect of BG on multispecies  biofilm as found in the oral cavity [4,21]. 

Several antibiotics such as gentamicin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, 

vancomycin, and cefuroxime axetil [22–26] have being loaded into 

MBGs leading to favorable antibacterial effects. However, the 

antibiofilm effect of MBG loaded with antibiotics has not been 

completely validated in these studies. Hence, it is of clinical relevance to 

incorporate antibiofilm rather than antibacterial compounds into MBG 

for an effective infection treatment [27].  

Previous studies have reported the incorporation of natural 

derived antibiofilm compounds into BG and MBG [28–30]. Surface 

functionalization of BGs has been explored for the incorporation of 

natural biomolecules such as polyphenols, which have potential 

antibacterial benefits[30]. Additionally, a herbal derived substance 

called propolis, which is a resinous natural substance collected by bees, 

has being described to have several health promoting properties like 

fibroblast stimulation, antioxidant activity, antifungal and antiviral 

activity, antibiofilm inhibition and counteraction  of bacteria virulent 



82 

factors [29,31]. Propolis has shown non-cytotoxic effects, but it has not 

been deeply explored in tissue engineering applications [32,33]. Only 

one study [29] has incorporated red and green propolis collected from 

different regions into BG, showing a satisfactory growth inhibition of  S. 

aureus, E. faecalis, S. mutans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. 

gingivalis, and, A. actinomycetemcomitans. Moreover, other natural 
compounds, such as A-type proanthocyanidins (PACS) derived from the 

cranberry fruit (Vaccinium macrocarpon) have also demonstrated a 
potential antibiofilm effect[34]. Initially, cranberry PACS were widely 

studied to prevent and treat urinary tract infections since they prevent 

bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells [34,35]. Additionally, Kim et al. 

reported that PACS are capable of inhibiting bacterial adhesion on the 

exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix which provides biofilm mechanical 

stability for microbial proliferation [36]. Other studies have also shown 

that cranberry PACS neutralize S. mutans virulence factors and increase 

the medium pH leading to changes of biochemical and ecological factors 

for cariogenic biofilm development [37,38]. On the other hand, even 

though several studies have reported the antibiofilm potential of 

cranberry PACS[34–38], that compound has not been incorporated into 

biomaterials to treat bone-derived infections and for bone regeneration.  

Accordingly, this study pursuits to integrate natural derived 

antibiofilm substances in bioactive glasses. In particular, a novel 

mesoporous bioactive glass incorporating propolis and cranberry 

antibiofilm compounds was developed. The hypothesis behind this work 

is that the incorporation of propolis and cranberry compounds will not 

affect the inherent bioactivity of 58S mesoporous bioactive glass, 

developing thus a material , which is both effective against biofilm 

formation and suitable to bond to bone without addition of antibiotic 

drugs.  

4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS    

4.2.1 MBG sol-gel synthesis  

MBG (58 wt% SiO2, 33 wt% CaO, 9 wt% P2O5) (58S 

composition) powder was processed via a sol-gel technique. First, 4 g of  

pluronic triblock copolymer P123 (EO20PO70EO20, 5800, Sigma 
Aldrich, USA) surfactant was dissolved in 50 mL ethanol by using a 

stirring bar at 40 
?
C for 1 h. Afterwards, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) 

(98%, Sigma Aldrich, USA), triethyl phosphate (TEP) (99.8%, Sigma 

Aldrich, USA) and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) 



83 

(Vetec, Brazil) were added to the solution as precursors of silicon, 

phosphorous and calcium oxide. The solution was stirred at  40
?
C for 12 

h. Nitric acid (HNO3, 68%, Vetec, Brazil) was used to dissolve 

Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and to adjust the pH of the solution while ethyl alcohol 

(EtOH, P.A., Synth, Brazil) was used to dissolve P123, TEOS and TEP. 

The molar ratios of SiO2, P2O5 and CaO were calculated, concerning the 

58S MBG proportion. TEOS and TEP were placed in a glass recipient 

containing EtOH under magnetic stirring at 25 
o
C for 10 min. 

Ca(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 2 M HNO3 and then added to water at 

a molar ratio TEOS:H2O of 1:4. Then, the solution was placed for 

drying in a chamber at 70 °C over a period of 24 h. Subsequently, the 

dried gel was thermally treated at 600 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 

1ºC/min to remove the organic agents and the surfactant template. The 

methodology used in this study is schematically shown in Figure 1. 

 

 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram showing the methodology applied in this study to 

prepare MBG incorporating propolis and cranberry PACS.  

4.2.2 Physicochemical characterization  

The particle size distribution was measured in a laser diffraction 

equipment (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern, UK). The powder was 

introduced in a wet dispersion unit with low water rotation (~1200 rpm) 
to avoid significant agglomeration of the particles. 



84 

Chemical analysis of the samples was performed using energy 

dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Swift 2000, Hitachi, Japan). The 

compound composition was obtained by rearranging the quantity of 

oxygen to calculate the weight percentage of oxides using the most 

stable stoichiometric arrangement, resulting in a reliable tool to semi-

quantify the respective oxides. The functional groups of the powder 

samples were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

(FTIR, Cary 600 Series, Agilent technologies, USA), performed by KBr 

pellet technique. Pellets were prepared by mixing 1 mg of each sample 

powder and 300 mg KBr at infrared grade under vacuum. The infrared 

spectra were recorded in a wavenumber of 400-4000 cm
-1

 in 

transmission mode with 32 scans and resolution of 4 cm
-1

. 

MBG textural analysis was performed by N2 adsorption and 

desorption isotherms measured by a porosity analyzer (AUTOSORB-1-

1 C, Quantochrome) at -203.85
?
C. Pore size distribution and volume 

were determined from the isotherm adsorption branch applying the 

Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method while the surface area was 

established by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The 

morphologic aspects of the MBG particles were analyzed by field 

emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Zeiss Leica, 

Germany) at an acceleration potential of 5 kV.  

4.2.2 In vitro loading of propolis and cranberry compounds  

Green propolis dry extracts from Baccharis dracunculifolia sp. 

(Natucentro®, Minas Gerais, Brazil) and Cranberry PAC dry extracts 

from Vaccinium macrapon sp. (Naturex-DBS® , Massachusetts, USA) 

were diluted in a 50% (v/v) hydro-alcoholic solution (EtOH, P.A., 

Synth, Brazil) under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 5 h to 

prepare solutions of 5 and 10 ?g/mL as described in a previous study 

[31].  Then, 0.5 g of MBG powders were immersed into 50 mL of the 

corresponding solutions with different concentrations and stirred at 37°C 

for 24 h. MBG powders were also added into a hydro-alcoholic solution 

free of natural derived compounds to prepare the control group. After 

immersion, the solutions containing MBG powders were centrifuged 

and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 3 h.  

4.2.3 In vitro apatite-forming assays  

Simulated body fluid (SBF) solution was prepared following 

Kokubo´s method [39]. The chemical composition of the SBF solution 

is shown in Table 1. MBG powders (75 mg) were immersed into 50 mL 



85 

of SBF solution in sterilized PS flasks. The flasks were placed in an 

incubator (IKA, Germany) at 37°C and stirred at 90 rpm for 8, 24 or 72 

h. At the end of each period, the samples were centrifuged, removed by 

filtration, washed with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 

37°C for 24 h [40]. Each sample was run in triplicate. Afterwards, the 

HCAp-forming ability of all samples was evaluated by SEM, EDX, and 

FTIR analysis.

4.3 RESULTS    

4.3.1 Characterization of MBG particles 

MBG particle size ranged from 1.44 up to 955 µm, revealing a 

Gaussian-like distribution, as seen in Figure 2A. The mean particle size 

was around 154 µm. The actual chemical composition of 58S MBG 

particles was close to the expected composition (58.22 ± 2 wt% SiO2, 

33.091 ± 3 wt% CaO, 8.6 ± 1 wt% P2O5) as shown in Figure 2B. EDX 

spectra showed the highest intensity peak for the Si element, followed 

by Ca element and P element (Figure 2B).  

The FTIR analysis showed BG characteristic peaks of Si-O-Si 

where the main absorption bands were at 1080, 810 cm
-1

, attributed to 

the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching, and at 460 cm
-1

 attributed to Si-O-Si 

bending, as demonstrated in Figure 3.  



86 

 

Figure 2. (A) MBG 58S particle size distribution and (B) EDX results for 58S 

MBG. 

The textural analysis regarding N2 adsorption-desorption 

isotherms, BJH pore size distribution and volume are shown in Figure 4. 

58S MBG N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure 4A) corresponded 

to a type IV curve of the International Union of Pure and Applied 

Chemistry (IUPAC) classification which is typical of mesoporous 

materials showing a H1 type hysteresis loop [41]. The initial part of this 

curve can be associated to monolayer-multilayer adsorption. Also, a 

limiting uptake in a range of high P/Po was noted[42]. In addition, the 

sharp steps in adsorption and desorption branches at 0.7-0.8 and 0.6-0.7 

P/Po regions respectively, are associated to capillary condensation at 
mesopores. The BHJ method revealed that MBG particles had a mean 

narrow pore radius at 2 nm, as shown in Figure 4B, and a porosity 

volume of about 0.83 cc/g. The MBG specific surface area was 350.2 

m
2
/g according to BET analysis.

radius distribution curves for 58S mesoporous bioactive glass particles.  

FESEM micrographs revealed a fairly regular and uniform 

appearance of MBG particles, as seen in Figure 5A. At higher 



88 

magnifications, MBG particles showed an angular shape and non-

smooth porous structure, having pores below 10 nm in diameter, as 

observed in Figure 5B and 5C. Also, sphere-like structures below 100 

nm are noticed in Figure 5C, probably indicating crystallized ?-

Tricalcium phosphate which may have formed after thermal treatment of 

the samples as described elsewhere [4].  

 
Figure 5. (A-C) FESEM images of 58S MBG 58S particles at different 

magnifications. In (C) nano-pores (white squares) are revealed at 80,000X 

magnification.   

4.3.2 In vitro apatite-forming assays  

FESEM images revealed that the surface of all samples was 

relatively smooth and did not exhibit any HCAp formation after 

immersion in SBF for 8 h (Fig. 6). After 24 h, all MBG samples 

changed their surface morphology having a more granular-like 

appeareance. For 72 h of immersion, all samples showed spherical-like 

structures which indicates the formation of apatite crystals. The control 

58S MBG  particles showed an apatite layer formed over their surface 

upon 24 h of immersion in SBF, as seen in Figure 6A whereas almost all 

MBG particles were covered with an HCAp layer. MBG particle 

surfaces were covered with a thick HCAp layer revealing spherical, 

needle, polygonal, and cauliflower-shaped crystals.  

In the case of MBG particles embedding 5 µg/ml cranberry 

PACS, an increase of roughness seemed to take place after 24 h 

immersion in SBF. Also, the surface was covered with sphere-shaped 

apatite crystals after 72 h of immersion in SBF, as seen at higher 

magnification (Figure 6B, white squares). In the case of MBG 

embedding 10 µg/ml cranberry PACs, the sample surface was still 

smooth after 24h of immersion when compared to the control group. 

Only some round plain structures could be detected on MBG embedding 

10 µg/ml cranberry (Figure 6C). On FESEM micrographs, MBG

particles embedding 10 µg/ml cranberry showed the lowest HCAp 

formation after 24 h among all samples. After 72 h of immersion, the 

surface of MBG embedding 10 µg/ml cranberry was not smooth 

anymore due to the presence of numerous small rounded apatite 

structures (Fig. 6C).  

MBG particles embedding both propolis concentrations are 

shown in Figures 6D and 6E. Both samples showed the development of 

an HCAp layer after 24 h of immersion in SBF that was more noticeable 

when compared to the other experimental group samples. After 72 h, a 

cauliflower shaped apatite layer could be clearly detected for both 

MBG/propolis containing samples, as seen in Figure 6D and 6E at the 

highest magnification micrographs (white squares).  

EDS analyses were performed in triplicate for all samples to 

determine the Ca/P atomic ratio, as shown in Table 2. The EDS spectra 

analysis showed non-significant changes in MBG composition for all 

samples after immersion in SBF for 8 h (Fig. 7). After 24 h, EDS 

showed an increase in Ca and P wt% while Si wt% decreased in all 

samples. Generally, MBG samples showed a notorious Si wt% loss and 

a higher wt% P after immersion in SBF for 72 h. EDS analysis on MBG 

embedding 5µg/ml propolis revealed Si as the main element followed by 

Ca and P after immersion in SBF for 8 h (Fig. 7A). However, a decrease 

in Si content and increase in P and Ca concentrations are noticed after 

24 immersion in SBF (Fig. 7B). This result can be linked to the presence 

of a thick HCAp layer as shown in the SEM micrograph. Finally, after 

72h, figure 7C shows an EDS spectrum exhibiting a lower Si wt% and 

higher P wt% corresponding to the formation of HCAp, which is 

expected after immersion in SBF for 72 h (Fig. 7C), as seen by SEM 

micrographs. The Ca/P ratios shown in Table 2 indicate that the 

unloaded MBG sample reached a Ca/P ratio of 1.8 after immersion in 

SBF for 72h, which is in accordance to non-stoichiometric HCAp ratio 

[43]. The samples embedding propolis in both concentrations revealed 

Ca/P ratios close to the HCAp reference value after 72 h of immersion 

in SBF. MBG sample embedding 5 µg/ml of cranberry PACs showed a 

ratio of 2.03 although MBG embedding the higher cranberry PACs 

concentration had a Ca/P ratio of 2.85.

The samples of the present study after 8 and 24 hours of SBF 

immersion did not show significant compositional changes in the FTIR 

spectra. The FTIR spectra of MBG with 5 or 10 µg/ml of propolis and 

cranberry PACS were similar after 72h of immersion. Figure 8 exhibits 

the spectra for MBG incorporating 5 µg/ml for both compounds.  The 

FTIR spectra of all samples presented the characteristic peaks attributed 

to HCAp layer formation as a doublet at around ~600 cm
-1 

corresponding to the bending mode of crystalline phosphate P-O and P-

O stretching mode at ~1050 cm

, where the resonance was more intense 

especially for the spectrum of  pure MBG. On the other hand the 

spectrum of MBG before SBF immersion indicates the absence of the 

mentioned double peak. Additionally, resonances attributed to the 

phosphate group were present in the spectra of pure MBG, MBG/ 

cranberry PACS and MBG/propolis. A narrowing band at around 820

4.4 DISCUSSION  

The present work synthesized mesoporous bioactive glass 

incorporating propolis and cranberry compounds in order to enhance the 

bioactive properties and anti-biofilm potential of MBG for bone healing 

and infection treatment procedures. The results of the present study 

supported the hypothesis that natural derived compounds incorporated 
into MBG did not interfere with the inherent bioactivity of this 

biomaterial. This study demonstrated an appropriate physical, chemical, 

and particle size distribution of MBG samples. Moreover, the addition 

of the surfactant P123 to the sol gel synthesis did not change the 



93 

characteristic chemical composition of 58S BG, as confirmed by EDX 

and FTIR analysis. 

Furthermore, the textural analysis showed that the synthesized 

MBG particles had a meso-porous structure of pore size of 4nm, with a 

high volume and specific surface area making it capable to incorporate 

in its structure therapeutic agents as a drug delivery system. The 

mesoporous structure of the synthesized MBG could be determined by 

its IV N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm curve with a H1-type 

hysteresis loop at high relative pressure according to the IUPAC 

classification [11,42]. The present study is supported by previous 

investigations showing the same type of hysteresis loop in the N2 

isotherms for mesoporous materials [12,14,44,45], however in this study 

the organization and arrangement of the meso-pores were not confirmed 

(e.g. by TEM). In addition, previous studies developing MBGs have 

shown higher surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter that should 

enhance the MBG capability to incorporate therapeutic agents in their 

nano-structure and favor a higher HCAp formation to bond with bone 

receptor tissues [46]. A high surface area increases the amount of Si-O 

bonds to interact with loaded therapeutic agent molecules and a high 

pore diameter and volume enables a larger space for drug load and 

sustained delivery. Furthermore, diverse biomolecules such as BMPs 

and VEGF can covalently bond to MBG surfaces to stimulate specific 

target cells for osteogenesis and angiogenesis  [46,47]. Even though the 

present study showed appropriate meso-pore characteristics, other 

structure directing agents could be applied such as F127, F108, P85, 

CTAB, and P123+CTAB, reported in other studies [12,48], to increase 

the surface area and volume of MBG improving in this way the 

mentioned therapeutic, bioactive and osteogenic characteristics [14].   

The simulated body fluid test is widely accepted to evaluate the 

bioactivity of a material in terms of its ability since it mimics the 

process in which a biomaterial is able to bond to bone tissues through 

the formation of a bone like apatite layer [39,40]. As follows, the 

mechanism of MBG apatite formation involves a series of steps. First, 

an exchange between calcium and hydrogen ions occurs. Consequently, 

silanol forms over the surface of the biomaterial and polymerizes 

producing an amorphous silica gel.  Afterwards, calcium and phosphate 

ions migrate to the newly formed silica gel and start forming an HCAp 

layer, which finally crystallizes forming needle and cauliflower-shaped 

structures which promote the attachment of bone cells [49]. In this 

study, MBG free or incorporating propolis and cranberry compounds did 

not exhibit apatite formation after 8 h in SBF solution; however, all the 



94 

samples were able to induce a significant HCAp layer after 72 h in SBF. 

Additionally, pure MBG samples revealed through chemical and 

microscopic analysis the greatest HCAp formation after 24 and 72 h, 

where their surface was completely covered by needle like and 

cauliflower-shaped crystals typical of the process of HCAp 

crystallization [43,50,51]. Nevertheless, MBGs immersed in propolis 

and cranberry solutions were also able to develop an HCAp layer after 

72 h. Only the highest concentration of cranberry PACS solution 

seemed to interfere with the HCAp forming capability of MBG 

particles. The highest concentration (10 µg/ml) of cranberry PACS 

negatively affected the bioactivity of the samples which can be observed 

in FESEM micrographs and Ca/P values comparable to 1.8 which 

corresponds to non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite [43]. Furthermore, 

pure MBG, 5-10 µg/ml propolis and 5µg/ml cranberry MBGs had a 

Ca/P value close to 1.8 demonstrating the presence of HCAp. In 

addition, EDX analysis exhibited after 24 and 72 h a notorious increase 

of calcium and phosphate wt% in all samples indicating the formation of 

a calcium phosphate layer over MBG particles by the reaction of Ca
2+

 

and PO4
3-

 ions from SBF solution. These results are relevant for  the 

intended applications in bone regeneration, since released Ca, Si and P 

ions from MBG particles can improve cell proliferation through HCAp 

layer formation, as reported in previous studies [49,52]. Finally, FTIR 

analysis did not show any significant change in the chemical 

composition of the samples after 8 h of SBF immersion. MBG 

incorporating propolis and cranberry compounds at both concentrations 

exhibited similar FTIR spectra after 72 h in SBF. As shown in figure 8, 

FTIR spectra for all samples after 72 h showed characteristic peaks 

attributed to HCAp layer formation as other studies report [53,54]. 

Resonance bands attributed to P-O and C-O were observed in all 

samples especially in pure MBG particles. This chemical analysis 

supports FESEM observations, which indicated that samples were able 

to develop an HCAp layer after 72 h of SBF immersion. This 

observation has clinical relevance since this HCAp layer on MBG 

surface layers facilitates bone contact few days after the surgical 

procedure. 

BGs have been modified over the years with the incorporation of 

diverse antibacterial and antibiofilm agents to counteract bone infection. 

Various studies have reported the incorporation of metal oxides, 

antibiotics and other organic agents into bioactive glasses[11–16]; 

however, there is no consensus until present days of which antibiofilm 

agent is the most effective for bone infection treatment [8,41,55–57]. 



95 

Indeed, the BG S53P4 is being successfully commercialized to 

counteract osteomyelitis conditions [58–60]. Taking in consideration 

that some metal ions have toxic effects in the human body [61], the 

present study investigated for the first time embedding in MBG two 

natural derived antibiofilm components consumed by humans which 

have no toxic effects [33,35]. Propolis and cranberry antibiofilm 

compounds have complex and rich phytochemical compositions of 

diverse elements such as flavonoids, steroids, amino acids, phenolic and 

aromatic compounds, which vary in composition and quantity 

depending on their growing conditions [62,63]. For this reason, the 

present study used propolis and cranberry compounds that already had 

chromatographic analysis and were previously standardized for 

commercial distribution. A difficulty of this study was to develop a 

protocol to incorporate propolis and cranberry compounds into bioactive 

glass mesoporous structures since there are no previous related studies 

that have followed an established and replicable methodology. 

Consequently, this study followed standard methods to develop an 

?accurate? procedure to embed propolis and cranberry compounds into 

MBG through the immersion technique. In addition, the main objective 

of the present study was to evaluate the bioactivity of the modified 

MBGs since this is an essential and desired characteristic of this 

biomaterial. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms 

in which these natural agents bond to MBG surfaces, how its delivery 

takes place and if their antibiofilm potential is effective to treat bone 

infections. Certainly, nature´s incomparable properties via antibiofilm 

compounds can be explored in novel biomaterial combinations, in this 

case with MBG, to develop a superior biomaterial system able to 

accomplish tissue-engineering goals with simultaneous anti-infection 

outcome. 

4.5 CONCLUSION  

The main conclusions of this study and perspectives for further 

reserach are the following: 

 

? MBG (58S) exhibited favorable physical properties, 
especially their mesoporous structure, that can act as a drug 

delivery system targeting specific areas where therapeutic 

agents are required, representing an alternative to systemic 

antibiotic therapy. 



96 

? All samples were able to induce an HCAp layer formation 
on MBG particles after 72 h of SBF immersion, which is 

important for clinical applications since such HCAp layer on 

MBG enables bone contact only few days after the grafting 

procedure.  

? The incorporation of propolis and cranberry PACS 
compounds reported as antibiofilm agents did not inhibit the 

HCAp formation ability of MBG, thus imparting their 

antibiofilm properties for bone repair and infection 

treatment. 

? Further studies are needed to assess the effects provided by 
the antibiofilm agent confined and delivered through MBG 

nano-pores and to develop release triggers such as pH, 

temperature, and light, which could make the delivery 

system more effective and sustained.

5 CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS  

O biovidro ativo tem sido desenvolvido para diversas aplicações 

nos processos de reparo e tratamento de infecção óssea. No em tanto, o 

biovidro ativo tem suas limitações para o tratamento de infecções nos 

leitos receptores que têm como fator causal a aderência do biofilme 

multi-espécies. Consequentemente a engenharia tecidual tem 

modificado o biovidro ativo incorporando na sua estrutura tanto química 

como física agentes anti-biofilme orgânicos e inorgânicos. Nos últimos 

anos, as diferentes moléculas derivadas de óxidos de metal, antibióticos 

e outros agentes sintéticos incorporadas no biovidro ativo têm dado 

resultados satisfatórios antimicrobianos, mas não têm apresentado 

resultados concluintes com respeito à inibição do biofilme. Assim, o 

presente trabalho explorou o estado da arte do tema para desenvolver 

assim partículas do biovidro ativo 58S normal e mesoporoso 

incorporando moléculas de brometo, cranberry e própolis a fim de 

combater as infeções ósseas associadas ao biofilme. Em princípio, o 

biovidro ativo 58S incorporando brometo mostrou resultados 

promissórios com relação a inibição de biofilme oral multi-especies. Por 

outro lado, o biovidro mesoporoso incorporando as moléculas naturais 

mostrou uma alta bioatividade que é uma característica inerente do 

biomaterial, sendo assim um material promissório que poderia atuar 

como sistema de liberação localizado de agentes anti-biofilme no leito 

receptor. Contudo, futuros estudos são necessários para estabelecer os 

agentes anti-biofilme mais efetivos para tratar as infeções ósseas que 

possam ser incorporados no biovidro ativo sem interferir com sua 

bioatividade inerente, nem causar efeitos citotóxicos no leito receptor.
