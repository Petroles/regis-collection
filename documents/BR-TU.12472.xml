Acknowledgements 

After 4 years of arduous work, it is very gratifying to finally reach the end of my PhD. Patience is the 

Mother of Science. A lot of patience was employed in this thesis, and so it is my wishful thinking that 

one day this work may be useful for someone – either physician or scholar – in the world. 

 

My greatest acknowledgement goes to my parents. Everything I did was for them. In the beginning of 

my PhD, they asked several times: “so, what are you working on exactly?” It was quite interesting, 

actually, especially considering that they still ask me this regularly. After all, what can a weird 

technology called “layer-by-layer” do to prevent things like high blood pressure, cholesterol, kidney 

stones, heart diseases, thrombosis, acute muscular pain and blindness, of which they suffer? I can 

honestly say that such question was the turning point in my research, because it gave me purpose. 

Now, I try to look for the medical potential of the things I do and hope that this thesis makes them 

proud. 

 

I want to deliver a word of appreciation and admiration to my supervisor, Prof. João Mano. I believe 

most of my progress in the scientific world has been possible because of him. He was always very 

receptive to new ideas – as long as they were good – comprehensive about situations going on out of 

3B’s and challenged my mind and the minds of all his students with new techniques and workarounds 

for experimental “headaches”. Looking back, I believe I couldn’t have asked for a better supervisor! 

Thank you for your help. 

 

I would like to acknowledge the 3B’s Research Group and its director, Prof. Rui Reis, for the possibility 

of developing my PhD thesis in the facilities at AvePark, providing everything I needed at my disposal. 

Also, I would like to acknowledge Prof. Nuno Neves who, as a representative of the Doctoral Program in 

Biomedical Engineering, helped me several times through the whole academic process related to the 

University of Minho, and very quickly when these things may take weeks. 

 

To my colleagues of 3B’s, it is complicated naming people, since we are so many. In 4 years, we all 

shared happiness and frustration, but all are moments that I cherish. Although I appreciate help from 

everybody, I would like to thank especially Álvaro, Albino, Ana Catarina, Catarina Custódio, Clara, Diana

Ribeiro, Isabel, João Requicha, Manuel, Mariana, Nuno, Pedro, Praveen, Sara Oliveira, Sílvia Mihaila, 

Sofia and Yan, for their help in my work and, particularly, during lunches and coffee-breaks! Of course, I 

couldn’t forget my “beloved former students”, Joana and Sara Gil, who were introduced to the lab 

environment for the first time by me. Thank you for your patience, especially Sara. She arrived just 

before I departed to Spain, and, even when I tried to give her my utmost attention, I’m pretty sure she 

must have felt abandoned. Sorry! 

 

To my colleagues of Bioforge. These “colorful” researchers at Valladolid sure have a way to receive 

foreign people in their group: we didn’t need 1 week to feel like we had known each other for years. 

Actually, that was the case for a couple of them but not for most of the new people. Alicia, Ana, Arturo, 

Chus, Guillermo, Irene, Israel, Ito, Laura, Lucía (allora ragazza!), Luis, Matilde, Mohamed, Rocío and 

Vanessa, thank you for making me feel at home. But my deepest gratitude goes to the people that 

accompanied my research since the beginning: Javier, Merche, and, of course, Prof. Carlos – my 

cosupervisor during my time abroad and a very enjoyable host – and Alessandra. Let me thank you with 

my best Italian – the little I managed to grasp: “grazie per tuo aiuto”! Next time I go to Valladolid, I’ll 

make sure to bring you the fabled “pão-de-ló” you kept hearing about! 

 

To Cristina: I can’t imagine how this period of my life would have been without you! I will never forget all 

the talks, the laughs, and the moments we spent together. Thank you for all the support, friendship and 

love, basically for being always there to me, even when I didn’t deserve. 

 

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my dear friends “The Seven Dwarves”, or six, since I am one of 

them: Corália, Diana, Emília, Joaquim, Joana, and Vera (no Snow White in the group). I want to thank 

you for your company and contact during all these years, and the good moments we spent together. It 

is nice to see, even when separated, how your friendship and your support could make things so much 

easier.

Nanostructured functional multilayer coatings incorporating biomimetic macromolecules for biomedical

Abstract 

The modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, for applications 

including cell expansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative 

medicine. In this thesis, the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique was employed in the modification of surfaces 

for multiple purposes, namely for films with improved adhesiveness, enhanced cell adhesion, drug 

delivery capsules, and magnetic spatial positioning. The working hypothesis was that LbL could be used 

in the modification of surfaces not only planar but also three-dimensional, using solely polymeric 

materials from a variety of natural origins or obtained by recombinant routes. 

Herein, chitosan (CHI), a well-known polycation with marine origins, was used recurrently as an 

ingredient in various multilayer formulations, driven by intermolecular forces such as electrostatic and 

hydrophobic interactions. First, multilayer coatings of CHI and an adhesive bacterial exopolysaccharide, 

levan, were fabricated. As a control, CHI and alginate films – two marine polysaccharides often 

regarded as good natural adhesives – were assembled in parallel. The adhesive strength of 50 

CHI/levan bilayers was determined to be about 3 times higher than the control. The adhesion of L929 

cells was also higher in levan-based films. 

Next, CHI was used along polyanionic elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a recombinant class of 

elastin-like polymers, exhibiting the cell adhesion motif arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). Although 

electrostatic interactions were relied upon to construct LbL coatings, they were not the sole mechanism 

of buildup between CHI and ELRs. The film construction of CHI and one of nine ELRs differing in amino 

acid content, length and biofunctionality was followed in situ at pH 4.0 and 5.5 using a quartz-crystal 

microbalance. Their thicknesses were estimated using the Voigt-based model for viscoelastic films, 

revealing that thicker films were obtained in the presence of hydrophobic interactions between ELRs 

and partially neutralized chitosan, i.e., when the pH was adjusted to 5.5, near its pKa. ELR/alginate 

coatings were also monitored, completing a total of 36 combinations studied. The results agreed with 

the ones from the CHI-based films: thicker films were obtained for partially neutralized alginate, at a pH 

value of 4.0. 

Bidimensional coatings of CHI and CHI/ELR-RGD were demonstrated to be stimuli-responsive by means 

of wettability measurements: they exhibited a moderate hydrophobic surface but switched to an 

extremely hydrophilic one when temperature, pH or ionic strength were raised above 50ºC, 11, or

1.25 M, respectively. The presence of RGD enhanced the adhesion of SaOs-2 cells, in comparison to 

films ending either in CHI or a nonbioactive RDG analogue. 

CHI/ELR-RGD coatings were extrapolated to the third dimension as spherical microcapsules assembled 

around calcium carbonate particles. Aiming at drug administration, two mechanisms were studied: 

(i) simple diffusion out of the microcapsules, and (ii) cellular uptake. In the first case, release studies at 

25 and 37°C with “bovine serum albumin”-loaded microcapsules demonstrated that they provided a 

sustained release over 14 days, but with reduced capsule permeability at physiological temperature, 

due to the temperature-induced molecular transition of ELRs. Furthermore, a higher numbers of layers 

provided an added barrier to the diffusion of the encapsulated protein. The microcapsules were also 

noncytotoxic towards L929 cells. In the second case, the internalization efficacy and intracellular traffic 

of RGD- or nonbioactive RDG-functionalized microcapsules by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) 

was assessed. The data suggests that microcapsules were internalized mainly through 

macropinocytosis and that surface functionalization did not play a significant role on this phenomenon, 

although intracellular processing was faster for RGD-functionalized microcapsules. Both microcapsule 

types were noncytotoxic toward hMSCs for microcapsule/cell ratios between 5:1 and 100:1. 

Finally, inspired by the complex hierarchical and compartmentalized structure of cells, liquefied alginate 

macroscopic spheres coated with a chitosan/alginate shell were conceived. Within this liquefied 

environment, rhodamine and multilayer microcapsules were confined, with the latter encapsulating 

further either rhodamine or magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). At 25 and 37ºC, rhodamine when 

encapsulated within the inner microcapsules showed a sustained release profile, with the diffusion 

kinetics being even more reduced at 25ºC. The release of rhodamine encapsulated in the outer 

liquefied alginate compartment did not show significant differences as a function of temperature. 

Encapsulating MNPs within the microcapsules provided magnetic responsiveness to the whole 

compartmentalized device and guided mobility capability. 

The developed work shows that LbL is a versatile technique that provides the means to develop a wide 

array of systems useful in biomedical applications, from adhesive and cell seeding planar supports to 

three dimensional structures for smart drug delivery, guided therapies and customized microreactors as 

disease models and microtissue production in laboratory.

Resumo 

A modificação de superfícies tem sido um aspeto fundamental em biologia e biotecnologia, em 

aplicações como a expansão de células, desenvolvimento de biomateriais e preparação de substratos 

para medicina regenerativa. Neste trabalho, a técnica de camada-a-camada foi utilizada na modificação 

de superfícies para vários fins, como filmes com adesividade e adesão celular melhoradas, cápsulas 

para administração de drogas, e o posicionamento espacial magnético. A hipótese foi a de que esta 

técnica poderia ser utilizada na modificação de superfícies planares ou tridimensionais, usando 

exclusivamente polímeros obtidos de várias origens naturais ou a partir de vias recombinantes. 

O quitosano (CHI), um reconhecido policatião com origens marinhas, foi recorrentemente utilizado 

como ingrediente em várias formulações de multicamadas, impulsionado por forças intermoleculares, 

tais como interações eletrostáticas e hidrofóbicas. Primeiro, revestimentos de CHI e um 

exopolissacarídeo bacteriano adesivo, levano, foram construídos. Como controlo, foram comparados 

com filmes de CHI e alginato – polissacarídeos marinhos considerados bons adesivos naturais. A força 

adesiva de 50 bicamadas de CHI/levano foi determinada como sendo cerca de 3 vezes mais elevada 

do que o controlo. A adesão de células L929 foi também maior em filmes contendo levano. 

Em seguida, CHI foi utilizado juntamente com recombinâmeros tipo-elastina (ELRs), uma classe de 

polímeros tipo-elastina, exibindo a sequência de adesão celular “arginina-glicina-ácido aspártico” (RGD). 

Embora interações eletrostáticas tenham sido invocadas para a construção de multicamadas 

auto-organizadas, estas não foram o único mecanismo de interação entre CHI e ELRs. A construção de 

filmes de CHI e um de nove ELRs diferentes em conteúdo aminoacídico, tamanho e biofuncionalidade 

foi monitorizado in situ a pH 4.0 e 5.5 utilizando uma microbalança de cristais de quartzo. As suas 

espessuras foram estimadas usando o modelo de Voigt para filmes viscoelásticos, revelando que os 

filmes mais espessos foram obtidos na presença de interações hidrofóbicas entre ELRs e CHI 

parcialmente neutralizado, isto é, quando o pH foi ajustado para 5.5, próximo do seu pKa. Filmes de 

ELR/alginato também foram monitorados, completando um total de 36 combinações estudadas. Os 

resultados obtidos estiveram em concordância com os dados dos filmes baseados em CHI: filmes mais 

espessos foram obtidos para alginato parcialmente neutralizado, a um valor de pH de 4.0. 

Através de medições de ângulos de contato, demonstrou-se que os revestimentos bidimensionais de 

CHI e ELR-RGD eram responsivos a estímulos: exibiram uma superfície moderadamente hidrofóbica 

mas converteram-se em extremamente hidrofílicas quando se aumentou a temperatura, o pH ou força

iónica acima de 50ºC, 11, ou 1,25 M, respetivamente. A presença de RGD melhorou a adesão de 

células SaOs-2, em comparação com filmes terminados ou em CHI ou num análogo não bioativo, RDG. 

Os revestimentos de CHI/ELR-RGD foram extrapolados para a terceira dimensão sob a forma de 

microcápsulas esféricas construídas em torno de partículas de carbonato de cálcio. Com a finalidade 

de administração de drogas, foram estudados dois mecanismos: (i) a difusão simples para o exterior 

das microcápsulas e (ii) a incorporação celular. No primeiro caso, estudos de libertação a 25 e 37°C 

com microcápsulas contendo albumina do soro bovino demonstraram uma libertação sustentada ao 

longo de 14 dias, mas sendo as cápsulas menos permeáveis a uma temperatura fisiológica, devido à 

transição molecular dos ELRs induzida pela temperatura. Além disso, um número mais elevado de 

camadas proporcionou uma barreira adicional à difusão da proteína encapsulada. As microcápsulas 

foram também não citotóxicas para células L929. No segundo caso, a eficácia de internalização e 

tráfego intracelular de microcápsulas funcionalizadas com RGD ou a sequência não bioativa RDG por 

células estaminais mesenquimais humanas (hMSCs) foi avaliada. Os dados sugerem que as 

microcápsulas foram internalizadas principalmente através de macropinocitose, e que a 

funcionalização da superfície não desempenhou um papel significativo neste fenómeno, embora o 

processamento intracelular tenha sido mais rápido para microcápsulas funcionalizadas com RGD. 

Ambos os tipos de microcápsulas foram não citotóxicas para hMSCs para rácios de 

microcápsula/célula entre 5:1 e 100:1. Finalmente, com inspiração na hierarquia complexa e estrutura 

compartimentada das células, esferas macroscópicas de alginato liquefeito revestidas com camadas de 

CHI/alginato foram concebidas. Dentro deste ambiente liquefeito, rodamina e microcápsulas foram 

confinadas, com estas últimas podendo conter ou mais rodamina ou nanopartículas magnéticas 

(MNPs). A 25 e 37ºC, rodamina quando encapsulada no interior de microcápsulas mostrou um perfil 

de libertação sustentada, sendo a cinética de difusão ainda mais reduzida a 25°C. A libertação de 

rodamina encapsulada no compartimento externo de alginato não exibiu diferenças significativas em 

função da temperatura. MNPs encapsuladas dentro das microcápsulas providenciaram resposta 

magnética a todo o dispositivo compartimentado e capacidade de mobilidade dirigida. 

O trabalho aqui desenvolvido mostra que a técnica de modificação camada-a-camada é uma técnica 

versátil capaz de fornecer meios para desenvolver uma ampla gama de sistemas úteis em aplicações 

biomédicas, desde suportes planos adesivos e para adesão celular até estruturas tridimensionais para 

a administração “inteligente” de drogas, terapias guiadas e microreatores personalizados para o 

desenvolvimento de modelos de doenças e produção de microtecidos em laboratório.

Figure 2.1. Schematics of layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes based on an electrostatic 

mechanism deposition. The procedure is based on the contact of the substrate with a solution with an 

oppositely charged polymer. In the depicted example, negatively charged round substrates are 

submerged in an aqueous solution of a polycation, followed by a solution containing a polyanion. Each 

adsorption stage is separated by a rinsing step, to remove loosely adsorbed molecules. 41

Introduction to the thesis format 

This thesis is organized in 4 sections that include a total of 12 chapters, plus 1 appendix. The first 

section provides the general introduction to the thesis. The second section corresponds to the 

experimental methods and materials used. The third section shows the experimental results obtained in 

the context of this thesis and their discussion, focusing on the optimization of layer-by-layer (LbL) 

strategies for biomedical applications. The fourth section finalizes this thesis with concluding remarks. 

The body of the thesis chapters is based on a series of peer-reviewed papers and book chapters 

published or submitted for publication. Each thesis chapter is presented in manuscript form, i.e., 

abstract, introduction, experimental section, results and discussion (or in two separate sections, results 

plus discussion), conclusion, and some of them with acknowledgements. A list of relevant references is 

also provided as a subsection within each chapter. The contents of each part and chapter are described 

below in more detail. 

 

Section I – General introduction 

Chapter 1, Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications: This chapter provides an introduction to the mechanisms behind the 

construction of LbL films and coatings, a technique based on the self-assembly of materials in the form 

of nanolayers, which may belong to distinct classes of materials. This technique served as the basis to 

the whole work described in this thesis. 

Chapter 2, Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies: In the sequence of 

Chapter 1, which focused primarily on the intermolecular phenomena driving the self-assembly of 

multilayer films, Chapter 2 reviews the state-of-the-art applications derived from LbL strategies focused 

on the technologies with interest in biomedicine. A thorough discussion regarding the current 

applications of LbL is presented, while hypothesizing about the potential of this technique in providing 

better devices for current medicine and for tissue engineering applications. 

Chapter 3, Elastin-like macromolecules: Most of the developed work relied on the use of elastin-like 

recombinamers (ELRs), a class of genetically-engineered polypeptides with stimuli-responsiveness. The 

properties and applications of this class of material are described, as well as their origin and 

resemblance with natural elastin.

Chapter 4, Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications: The use of ELRs allowed developing 

multilayer devices that exhibited stimuli-responsiveness. In this chapter, the importance of “smart” 

surfaces for biomedical applications – planar and three-dimensional – obtained by numerous 

techniques is reviewed. 

 

Section II – Experimental section 

Chapter 5, Materials and methods: A list of the materials used and methods applied to obtain the 

results described further on is provided. 

 

Section III – Optimization of layer-by-layer strategies for biomedical applications 

Chapter 6, Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical 

applications: This chapter aims to show that LbL coatings can be constructed using natural-occurring 

materials and retain the original properties of those constituents. Namely, levan, an exopolysaccharide 

produced by extremophilic bacteria, is known to exhibit adhesive properties. Thus, it was used as an 

ingredient for multilayer formulations with enhanced adhesiveness. 

Chapter 7, Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a 

combinatorial approach: In this chapter, the type of interactions that drive the self-assembly of ELRs 

and polysaccharides into layers – namely chitosan and alginate – was studied. It is based on partial 

findings from the literature, where there has been evidence that not only electrostatic interactions are at 

work during the construction of polymer/protein hybrid films but also hydrophobic ones. 

Chapter 7 – Appendix, Nanostructured thin coatings from chitosan and an elastin-like recombinamer 

with acute stimuli-responsive behavior: This appendix complements Chapter 7 and consists in a 

comparative study between ELR-functionalized films which amino acid sequence is organized either as 

a single or multiple blocks with distinct properties. 

Chapter 8, Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings 

with multiple stimuli-responsive properties: In this chapter, polyanionic elastin-like recombinamers 

produced by Escherichia coli strains were used. ELRs appear as an elegant example of how natural 

materials inspire the creation of new and tailored materials using biological processes. Their response 

to external stimuli and genetic nature allows incorporating specific motifs like the cell adhesion motif 

arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) while retaining the repeating amino acid structure of natural elastin.

With this polymer, surfaces with stimuli-responsive properties and enhanced cell adhesion were 

envisaged. 

Chapter 9, Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for the 

delivery of active molecules: This chapter describes the attempt to extrapolate ELR-polysaccharide 

hybrid films to the third dimension in the form of spherical microcapsules. The mechanism of diffusion 

of an encapsulated protein to the exterior of the capsules was studied for the development of drug 

delivery devices. 

Chapter 10. Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules: Similarly to Chapter 9, microcapsules are produced for drug delivery. In 

this case, the mechanism of delivery is focused on the internalization of the microcapsules by cells 

rather than diffusion to the surrounding medium. 

Chapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- 

to the macro-scales: The possibility of using LbL to develop structures with higher degrees of complexity 

is studied in this chapter by assembling compartmentalized spherical structures with hierarchical 

organization and customized stimuli-responsiveness. It constitutes a fine example of inspiration on 

natural living structures such as that of natural cells.

Abstract 

Devices prepared by bottom-up strategies have been proposed for several biomedical applications. 

Among various self-assembly techniques, layer-by-layer (LbL) offers ease of preparation, versatility, fine 

control over the materials structure, and robustness under physiological conditions. Due to its self-

assembled nature and use of small masses of material, coatings can be produced using aqueous 

solutions under mild conditions of temperature, pH, and pressure, with minimal energy requirements 

and material waste. Herein, we review the multitude of LbL mechanisms for constructing 

nanostructured devices of relevance to applications such as tunable cell adhesion and metabolism, 

drug delivery, and biomineralized and smart systems.

1.1 Introduction 

The modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology applications, including 

cell expansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine [1-3]. 

In the field of implantable biomaterials and tissue engineered constructs, the bulk material properties 

are generally considered to determine the overall properties of a biomaterial. Surface properties, 

however, are of utmost importance as the surface constitutes the first interface between an implant and 

the organism, and will drive subsequent tissue and cellular events including protein adsorption, cell 

adhesion and inflammatory response, all of which are necessary for tissue remodeling [4-6]. Thus, 

surface engineering is highly important for developing devices with improved biological performance. 

Many processing techniques have been suggested and employed for the purpose of modifying 

substrates [7], but in the past two decades alternatives to common surface engineering strategies have 

emerged. Inspired by Nature, scientists and engineers have developed techniques based on biomimetic 

concepts. In Nature, evolutionary processes have constantly improved the design and functionality of 

natural materials. A well-known example is the layered organization of nacre found in the shells of sea 

animals. This layered and hierarchical structure containing calcium minerals is capable of dissipating 

high amounts of mechanical energy[8,9]. Mimicking natural layered structures has been attempted in 

the laboratory. In particular, the alternate adsorption of polyanions and polycations onto solid substrates 

is a reliable, flexible, and simple approach to modify a substrate while allowing the integration of a wide 

range of molecules, including those with biological relevance. As a result, multilayered thin films can be 

constructed with nanometric precision. This technique was first introduced by Decher, Hong and 

Schmitt and has denominated the layer-by-layer (LbL) field [10]. 

LbL is a self-assembly-driven surface modification strategy that allows the construction of 

nanostructured films onto substrates of any geometry, from simple bidimensional surfaces to more 

complex three-dimensional porous scaffolds. The underlying principle lies in the existence of multiple 

intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen 

bonding, where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the most important role. It is a 

technique that is easy to perform, versatile, offers fine control over the materials structure, and 

produces materials that are robust in physiological environments [11-13]. Because this technique may 

be performed using various complementary substances, a vast choice of available materials may be 

added to a multilayer formulation, such as proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, virus particles,

organic polymers, molecular assemblies, and inorganic substances, allowing construction of LbL 

assemblies with very specific properties [4]. The buildup can be performed at mild conditions, namely 

standard laboratory temperatures and pressures, and mild pH, and can be tuned by making small 

adjustments in such conditions. Moreover, LbL does not involve the use of organic solvents. The mild 

and non-aggressive processing conditions of LbL make it an appealing technique for tissue engineering 

applications. Molecules with biological relevance may be embedded in the multilayer materials, with 

bioactivity preserved, particularly important for drug delivery applications. Biomaterials and ligands with 

more specific functions, such as cell adhesion enhancers, may be used in order to mimic biological 

structures and functions, rendering a substrate more instructive for cell behavior [14-16]. Exploiting the 

advantages of LbL, multilayer systems have already been proposed for various biomedical applications. 

An example includes biomimetic composite coatings that regulate drug release or manipulate the 

adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and even function of attached cells. In the following sections, 

these applications and associated multilayer formulations will be reviewed. 

1.2 Interaction between biomaterials as ingredients for multilayer formulations 

One of the key features of LbL adsorption is the ability to use ingredients from distinct classes of 

materials. Usually the most important requirement is that two distinct materials possess 

complementarity, that is, the properties of both materials result in attraction. A well-known example 

most exploited example is the self-assembly driven by electrostatic interactions of oppositely charged 

components, in which polyanions and polycations interact and assemble [17]. Besides electrostatic self-

assembly (ESA), other types of interactions that can drive the construction of multilayers include short-

range interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding [11]. The strength of these 

interactions may depend on several intrinsic factors, such as the molecular weight of polymers or size 

of inorganic particles, charge density, polarity, and also external factors, like the temperature, the pH of 

the solvent, and ionic strength (see following sections). Importantly, it is now acknowledged that the 

driving force behind multilayer formation is not only mutual interaction, but also by the gain in entropy 

due to the release of counter-ions [13,18]. The variation of one or more of these parameters can lead to 

a more favorable interaction and consequent buildup of a nanostructured coating. The result is, 

however, dependent on the original properties of the materials: for instance, varying the pH of a weak 

polyelectrolyte will greatly affect its overall charge density. Several biomaterials of synthetic and natural

engineering applications 

 

7 

origins have been used since LbL was first introduced, many of which capable of being used for 

multilayered constructs while displaying biologically relevant properties. 

1.2.1 Buildup mechanisms of synthetic and inorganic materials 

Many types of charged molecules and nano-objects are suitable for deposition by ESA. So far, the most 

popular deposition materials have been synthetic polyelectrolytes. Synthetic materials are usually man-

made and can be highly functional [19]. With the availability of thousands of monomers and their 

seemingly endless combinations, polymer science has developed a wide array of complex but well-

defined structures with specific properties, such as molecular weight and charge density. Other 

materials suitable for deposition using ESA are inorganic (e.g., calcium-containing or clay mineral 

particles) or metallic materials, usually consisting of a single geometrical charged structure (e.g., 

spheres or platelet-like objects) with natural or artificial origins [20,21]. 

Synthetic polymers, though not often similar to biological structures, have been used to define and 

quantify parameters important for the construction of nanostructured multilayer coatings. The main 

advantages of synthetic polymers are that they are easily chemically modified and they enable certain 

buildup parameters to be precisely adjusted. The pioneers of LbL proved its concept by creating 

ultrathin homogeneous films on solid surfaces [10]. Positively charged aminopropylsilanized fused 

quartz or silicon single crystal substrates served as supports for the ESA buildup. Poly(styrene 

sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS) served as polyanions and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) 

(PAH) and poly-4-vinylbenzyl-(N, N -diethyl-N -methyl)-ammonium iodide as polycations. Immersing the 

positive support in an aqueous solution of one of the polyanions resulted in the adhesion of the 

polymeric molecules and reversal of charge density of the substrate. A rinsing step followed to remove 

loosely adsorbed molecules. Then the substrate was exposed to a solution of one of the polycations, 

again reversing the charge. By repeating this process, the stepwise construction of a coating was 

achieved. With 39 layers, Decher et al. were able to produce films as thin as 44 nm. 

The striking simplicity of fabricating a wide range of LbL-modified substrates was rapidly recognized by 

the scientific community. Many studies with different materials collectively identified the key parameters 

influencing the fabrication of nanostructured multilayer films and determined how to optimize them. The 

pH of the polyelectrolyte solutions used during buildup has been studied by using poly(acrylic acid) 

(PAA) and PAH to fabricate polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) [22,23]. Varying the pH of the dipping 

solutions considerably changes the charge density of a weak polyelectrolyte when operating above or 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

8 

below the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the polymer. When adjusting the pH of PAA and of PAH 

above and below their pKa, respectively, a higher degree of ionization could be exploited, favoring ESA-

driven adsorption. In the opposite case, when operating near the acidity constant, the charge density is 

at its lowest. Consequently, fewer charged molecules are available to form a new top layer and more 

polyelectrolyte molecules are needed to interact with the underlying layer for ESA [16,24,25]. This 

affects the internal structure of the fi lm in terms of layer conformation since adjusting the pH modifies 

the charge density of the polyelectrolytes. An additional observation is that increasing the charge density 

of the adsorbing polymer will favor thinner polyelectrolyte layers, whereas increasing the charge density 

at the surface will favor thicker adsorbed layers. The latter enables the production of thicker and 

rougher films, while the former results in thinner and smoother films [23,26]. 

The addition of salts to the adsorbate solutions has been studied since ions can interfere with the 

electrostatic balance of molecules and the internal PEM structure. PAH, PSS and 

poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) have been used to demonstrate that the addition 

of salt increases the thickness of the layers due to a screening mechanism of charge–charge repulsions 

[27,28]. Basically, the electrostatic repulsion among groups with the same charge sign is reduced by 

the interaction with the salt ions present in solution and allows for a more stable buildup and interaction 

between layers. The adsorption process can be increased with increasing concentrations of salt, but 

since this mechanism is somewhat similar to that of pH, high concentration of salt may render the 

materials uncharged, which may induce desorption or “stripping” rather than adsorption [29,30]. 

Temperature also affects the buildup mechanism of multilayer films. However, while most studies on 

temperature focus on its effect on stability and functionality after construction, few study temperature as 

a buildup variable. A study by Salomäki, Vinokurov and Kankare [31] used films made of PSS and 

PDADMA to verify that temperature has a remarkable effect on the apparent mass of the resulting films. 

In aqueous solutions containing sodium bromide, the mass of adsorbed material at 55 ºC was 

approximately 5 times higher than a construction performed at a room temperature of 25 ºC, along with 

a tendency for the mass to increase exponentially. In the same report, similar results were found for 

PSS and PAH films. The conclusion was that a higher temperature during the deposition increases the 

mobility of the adsorbed molecules, resulting in deeper layer interpenetration deeper through the PEMs 

and a greater likelihood of finding more energetically optimal binding sites at the deposition site. 

Polyelectrolyte multilayers made using synthetic polymers have been extended to applications other 

than simple interface tuning. For instance, a dye may be used as a film ingredient or it may be loaded 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

9 

after film assembly [32]. The latter takes advantage of the swelling properties of multilayer films, in 

which a dye can be loaded – and reversibly unloaded – into the film by immersion in a saturated 

solution. Ideally, a dye may be replaced by a therapeutic molecule or growth factor to act as a drug 

delivery device upon implantation or for use in cell culture. The versatility of LbL is not limited to 

polymers. Other extended functionalities include the use of inorganic particles, such as bioactive 

nanoparticles (BNPs), to develop surfaces that could mineralize into calcium phosphate crystals under 

the presence of a simulated body fluid [33]. Carbon nanotubes have also been used as LbL ingredients 

along with polyelectrolytes for substrates with improved mechanical properties [34-36]. Work with clay 

platelets [37], and graphene [38] has also taken advantage of the LbL methodology, although polymers 

offer more mobility to the internal structure of the film. In summary, LbL can be used as a means to 

coat surfaces and control the interface in almost any fashion desired, due to the several mechanisms 

that influence its thickness, roughness and loading capabilities. Such surface property control makes 

LbL a powerful technique to develop tunable cutting-edge devices whose surfaces influence the fate of 

cells, important for a range of applications in conventional medicine and tissue engineering. 

1.2.2 Natural-based polymeric materials 

Natural materials are intricate structures which have risen from hundreds of millions of years of 

evolution. Comparing to our current technology, natural structures are more multifaceted than 

man-made materials, forming complex arrays and hierarchical structures with multiples functionalities 

[39-41]. The advantage of using natural-based polymers for biomedical and tissue engineering 

applications lies in their similarity with biological macromolecules, thus avoiding triggering chronic or 

immunological reactions and toxicity [42]. They possess more similarity to the extracellular matrix 

(ECM) than synthetic materials and are therefore appropriate multifunctional ingredients for 

constructing multilayer films and coatings with better interface with biological environments. The range 

of potential LbL ingredients spans the gamut from synthetic to natural materials, including 

polysaccharides, polypeptides, proteins, nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and even viruses, 

allowing highly biomimetic surfaces to be engineered [4,12,13,16,27]. 

One of the natural polymers most exploited to construct multilayer films is hyaluronic acid (HA). 

Hyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan or hyaluronate, is an important glycosaminoglycan 

component of the connective tissue, synovial fluid and the vitreous humor of the eye [43]. It is a linear 

polysaccharide composed of numerous repelling anionic groups capable of binding cations and water 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

10 

molecules. Solutions of HA exhibit clear viscoelastic properties that make them excellent biological 

absorbers and lubricants. HA may also be obtained through a process of microbial fermentation, 

avoiding the risk of animal-derived pathogens [44]. 

Several authors have focused on the use of HA as a polyanion [45-47]. In particular, HA has been 

combined with poly(L-lysine) (PLL) [48-50]. PLL is a linear polypeptide containing an amino group and 

has been widely used in biomaterial applications to enhance cell adhesion [51-53]. A thorough 

investigation of the PLL/HA system provided a better understanding of the exponential growth 

mechanism of layer thickness, as opposed to the linear growth mechanism introduced by Decher [54-

56]. For this system, the exponential growth mechanism relies on the diffusion of at least one of the 

polymers ‘in-and-out’ of the molecular chains during each bilayer deposition step. In these studies, it 

was PLL that diffused through the film. 

Polysaccharides of marine origin form another important class of natural materials. Chitosan (CHI) is a 

polysaccharide exhibiting cationic properties and solubility under acidic conditions. Its precursor, chitin, 

is the second most important natural polymer in the world and can be extracted from marine 

crustaceans including shrimp and crabs. CHI possesses several characteristics favorable for promoting 

dermal regeneration and accelerated wound healing [57]. Alginate (ALG) is another polysaccharide of 

marine origin, namely from brown algae. Its structure contains carboxyl groups, which makes it 

negatively charged [58]. Both of these polysaccharides possess adhesive, non-toxic, bacteriostatic, 

fungistatic, hemostatic, and anti-microbial properties, making them ideal for tissue engineering 

applications. Because of these unique features, CHI and ALG have been frequently used in biomedical 

applications including burn dressings, drug delivery, and implants [59-61]. They have been used as LbL 

ingredients, both together or in conjugation with other materials. PLL/ALG and CHI/HA systems have 

been shown to possess an internal structure typically produced by the exponential growth mechanism 

[54,62]. Martins et al. [63] demonstrated the loading capability of CHI/ALG films with human serum 

albumin (HSA) which depended on the availability of amino groups to bind the negatively charged 

protein. Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde reduced that availability and HSA adsorption in comparison to 

uncrosslinked films. 

The molecular weight of LbL ingredients is an important property influencing the buildup mechanism. 

However, few studies using natural polymers have systematically investigated the influence of polymer 

molecular weight on the physical properties of polyelectrolyte multilayers, since it is difficult to obtain 

monodisperse polymers from natural sources. As such, studies related to molecular weight have mostly 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

11 

focused on the use of well-characterized synthetic polymers [64-66]. Nevertheless, using CHI and HA 

films, Kujawa et al. [67] found that the thickness increased when the molecular weight of these 

polysaccharides was higher. They demonstrated that the higher the molecular weight the thicker the 

film: a longer polymer tends to adsorb in a “loopier” way, while a smaller molecule adsorbs in an 

extended conformation. Therefore, with longer polymers, there are more anchoring sites available for 

the next layer to adsorb and potentially higher interpenetrating capabilities than with smaller molecules. 

The mechanical properties of multilayer films can affect cell adhesion and differentiation. Increasing the 

Young’s modulus (i.e. stiffness) of multilayer films improves cell adhesion [68-70]. This behavior makes 

LbL substrates suitable as tunable platforms to control cell adhesion. Moreover, LbL substrates with 

varying support stiffness could potentially induce stem cell differentiation. Multilayers can also be used 

as reservoirs for therapeutic molecules (discussed below) and can incorporate naturally occurring smart 

biomaterials. By fabricating a film containing stimuli-responsive ingredients, interface properties could 

be changed on demand. 

All films constructed by ESA from weak polyelectrolytes – synthetic or natural – are inherently pH-

responsive. Properties like Young’s modulus, roughness or wettability may be tailored by varying the 

film assembly conditions, due to the dissociation of the weak acidic and alkaline functional groups on 

the chains. Wood et al. [71] demonstrated the pH controlled degradation of a film, from which 

therapeutic molecules were release to the bulk medium. Ionic strength may also be used as a stimuli-

response mechanism for films made of weak, and, unlike pH, strong polyelectrolytes [27-30]. A 

screening effect caused by the interaction between free counter-ions and charged polymer groups leads 

to a reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between charged groups of the same sign. Such 

mechanisms are potentially useful for drug delivery, because they could provide sustained and 

controlled release with greater effectiveness, lower toxicity, and improved patient convenience over 

conventional formulations. However the sharp variations of pH and ionic strength associated with them 

may be harmful for cells. On the other hand, cells are less sensitive to temperature variations, at least 

for temperatures near 37°C. Therefore, temperature responsive materials could be a more favorable 

choice for use with cells. One of the most popular temperature responsive polymers is poly(N-

isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm). PNIPAAm has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) around 

32°C enclosing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [72]. Below the LCST, the polymer is 

soluble in aqueous solution, with an expanded or hydrated coil conformation; above it, the polymer 

becomes insoluble, preferring a folded globular structure. PNIPAAm is a synthetic material but 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

12 

combinations with natural polymers are possible. CHI, a weak polycation, has been grafted with 

PNIPAAm to construct films with dual responsiveness [73]. Elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) are 

another class of temperature-responsive materials; a class of the elastin-like polymers (ELPs) family, 

they are genetically engineered peptide-based macromolecules obtained through the fermentation of 

modified bacterial strains [74]. ELRs are rooted in the peptide sequence of natural elastin present in 

tissues that require elasticity as part of their function, such as skin, tendons and muscles. In an 

aqueous environment they are known to self-assemble and exhibit a transition temperature (Tt): below 

Tt, the free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations; above it, they fold into an organized 

structure known as ?-spiral. Although ELRs respond primarily to temperature, the effects of other 

stimuli, such as pH, ionic strength and concentration also affect the transition phenomenon. Their 

genetically-engineered origin also allows motifs to be integrated that have biological relevance, such as 

cell adhesion [75] and mineralization enhancers [76]. In LbL, they have already been suggested as 

suitable ingredients for constructing films with multiple stimuli-responsiveness [77-79]. They are an 

elegant example of how Nature inspires engineers to develop new multifunctional materials for tissue 

engineering applications. 

1.3 Scalability to three dimensions 

LbL was first introduced as a surface engineering technique for planar surfaces. However, this 

technology can be used to coat surfaces on substrates or templates with a variety of shapes and sizes 

beyond planar. As a result, devices such as scaffolds that could only be fabricated through conventional 

methods may now be engineered to exhibit new tunable properties according to the desired application. 

1.3.1 Membranes 

Most polyelectrolyte multilayers may be assembled with up to dozens of layers to a thickness that may 

reach tens of micrometers. However, PEMs are assembled and adhere to underlying substrates and 

cannot be detached without damaging the films. Detached films, usually called “free-standings”, are 

potentially useful for a range of nanostructured membrane based devices for a range of sensing, 

detection, and drug delivery applications [80,81]. 

A typical approach to fabricate free-standings involves a sacrificial layer or substrate that is dissolved 

after buildup [82,83]. Cellulose acetate, for instance, can be used as a substrate and dissolved with 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

13 

acetone after buildup [84]. A potential disadvantage of such an approach is that the films may undergo 

both chemical and physical changes during the post-processing steps to separate the film from the 

underlying substrate and interfere with the internal structure of the multilayers. More recently, other 

strategies have been introduced that avoid using chemicals to remove the template. Hydrophobic 

substrates have been used to assemble free-standing PEMs, exploiting a peeling mechanism of the film 

from the substrate. Larkin et al. [85] used Teflon and polypropylene as planar templates from which 

CHI and HA films could be easily peeled off without damage. Another method consists of assembling 

films virtually “on air without templates”. Mallwitz and Laschewsky [86] prepared ultrathin freestanding 

arrays of LbL films in the holes of electron microscopy grids (100 × 100 µm). The precise mechanism 

was not clear. Apparently, the pores were so small that the multilayer ingredients were suspended 

across the orifices instead of coating their walls, so that thin polymeric lamellae could remain trapped in 

the pores. However, the authors did not develop a strategy to extract the free-standings from the grid. 

1.3.2 Capsules 

LbL has been suggested as a technology to produce capsules as tunable drug carriers for drug delivery 

applications and cell differentiation [87,88]. Typically, the template for a hollow or loaded capsule is a 

nano- or micro-particle. Similarly to some free-standings, the template particle is sacrificial. After 

assembling the multilayers, the core is removed with a solvent. The result is a hollow multilayer shell 

which may encapsulate molecules of interest such as DNA and proteins [35,89]. The sacrificial cores 

were organic microparticles (typically 1–10 mm) such as polystyrene or melamine formaldehyde, which 

were then dissolved by organic solvents or strong acids [90]. The drawback of such an approach is that 

it employs aggressive solvents that could damage the remaining shell and destroy the functionality and 

purpose of the structure. Also, organic residues from the aggressive solvents could affect biological 

environments, making the approach less appealing for tissue engineering. Such drawbacks led to the 

introduction of other templates that could be dissolved under less aggressive conditions, such as 

mesoporous silica (with diameters of 500 nm to 5 µm, dissolved in hydrogen fluoride) and porous 

calcium carbonate (with diameters of 3–5 µm, dissolved in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 

EDTA) [91,92]. 

The concept of permeability after the buildup is of great interest for drug delivery and tissue engineering 

applications: not only must a carrier be able to retain and preserve the drug but also release it when 

necessary and in a controlled fashion. The most obvious way to control such permeability is to vary the 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

14 

number of layers assembled around a template: more layers result in higher resistance to molecular 

[93]. In order to fill the interior of a multilayer capsule with a drug, both pre- and post-loading 

encapsulation mechanisms have been exploited [94]. In pre-loading, the sacrificial core may already 

contain the molecule of interest that will remain upon dissolution, or crystals of the molecule of interest 

that can be used as a template and liquefied after assembly, without removal. In the post-loading 

approach, prefabricated hollow capsules can be loaded by altering the permeability of the capsule shell 

[95,96]. Several mechanisms based on the effect of external variables have been exploited to reversibly 

change the permeability of a multilayer shell. Multilayer capsules are inherently responsive to pH and 

ionic strength due to their interference with the electrostatic balance between layers. The permeability 

of such responsive capsules was studied by Shutava et al. [97] for capsules based on tannic acid and 

PAH. The capsules seemed impermeable to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextrans at neutral pH but 

became permeable at both low and high pH values. Ibarz et al. [98] reported that the permeability of 

hollow PSS/PAH polyelectrolyte capsules sharply improved upon increasing the concentration of salts. 

Temperature has also been suggested as a mechanism for post-loading. It is believed that a 

rearrangement occurs with the increase of temperature due to a tendency of shells to reduce the 

shell/water interface [99]. However it has only been achieved for temperatures as high as 50–70ºC, 

and is thus not suitable for biological applications [100-102]. For drug release, the same mechanisms 

used to post-encapsulate a molecule of interest could also be used to modulate its release in a 

controlled fashion. 

1.3.3 Tubes 

Hollow tubes of micron or submicron diameter and high aspect ratio are interesting for various 

applications. They possess a large specific surface area, making them appealing for catalysis, sensing, 

or as tissue scaffolding [103-105]. Hollow tubes could be used for encapsulation purposes and find 

applications in fields like drug delivery and as transport channels in microfluidics [106]. In biology, 

tubes of submicron dimensions are commonly found, like protein nanotubes or microtubules, and play 

an essential role in providing mechanical reinforcement in cells and small blood vessels [34]. 

Tube-like structures may be fabricated in a similar manner to other shapes templates (cylindrical in this 

case) are coated and subsequently dissolved under conditions that do not destroy the coating, thus only 

tube-like objects remain. To date, this morphology has not been extensively used and only a few reports 

exist of multilayer nanostructured hollow tubes compatible with tissue engineering applications. Tube-



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

15 

like structures have previously been fabricated by assembling polyelectrolytes onto micrometric glass 

fibers that were then dissolved by hydrogen fluoride [107]. Another strategy to fabricate tube-like 

structures is to consists in the coat porous membranes (the templates) with polyelectrolytes, which in 

turn adsorb to the wall of the pores, after which the membranes are dissolved [35]. He et al. [108] 

pursued an interesting approach by assembling tubes of PSS and PAH using the porous template 

method and transforming them into capsules by varying temperature. This structural transition from 

tubular to vesicular or vesicle-like systems is often considered for drug delivery, gene delivery, self-

assembled nanoreactors, or biochemical sensors [109]. 

In the future, multilayer tubular structures may be of significant interest in tissue engineering. For 

instance, nanostructured artificial blood vessels could be developed as an alternative to the 

conventional autologous grafting treatment by the incorporation of collagen and elastin to mimic the 

intima, media and adventitia layers [110,111]. 

1.3.4 Three-dimensional scaffolds 

LbL is not limited to the simple geometries shown so far. The technique may be applied to more 

complex geometries by using more intricate structures as templates. Porous agglomerates of particles, 

for instance, can be coated and, similarly to previous structures, the template can be chelated, leaving 

only the multilayer assembly to serve as supports for cell culture. Miranda et al. [112] and Sher, 

Custódio and Mano [113] have developed nanostructured multilayer structures based on agglomerates 

of particles of chitosan (not leachable) and paraffin (leachable), respectively. Their works, which will be 

referred to again, demonstrate that more complex and functional structures may be made using LbL. 

1.4 Application of nanostructured multilayer devices in tissue engineering 

The numerous possibilities for adjusting the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of multilayer 

films have garnered attention from tissue engineers hoping to develop systems to control protein and 

cell adhesion and release therapeutic molecules and growth/differentiation factors. In addition, 

researchers wish to tune the surface properties by of such microsystems adding specific ligands or 

stimuli-responsive biomaterials.

1.4.1 Controlling cell adhesion and proliferation 

When a biomedical device enters in contact with a cell-populated biological environment, adhesion is 

the first event to occur Adhesion is the first cell event that occurs when a cell comes into contact with a 

material’s surface, which will be followed by proliferation and, in the case of stem cell cultures, 

differentiation. 

We have already mentioned that changing the mechanical properties of a multilayer film may affect the 

cellular adhesion. Schneider et al. [69] have studied the cell adhesion of HCS-2/8 human 

chondrosarcoma cells on PLL/HA films with various degrees of crosslinking. The Young’s modulus of 

the film could be varied over two orders of magnitude simply by varying the concentration of a 

crosslinker, carbodiimide, from 3 to 400 kPa for the lowest and highest concentrations, respectively. 

Increasing the film stiffness also increased the roughness and number of attached cells, showing how a 

simple modification to the mechanical properties to multilayer films can affect their response in a 

biological environment. Phelps et al. [114] also applied this concept to selectively crosslink the outer 

region of a PLL and poly(glutamic acid) (PGA) film, resulting in a rigid outer skin to promote cell 

attachment, while leaving the film (and any embedded bioactive species) unaffected. Crosslinked CHI 

and HA films have also been studied in vivo by implantation in a rat oral cavity [115]. Crosslinked films 

demonstrated up to 60% higher resistance to degradation compared to uncrosslinked samples. 

Multilayer films may be engineered with exhibiting anti-fouling properties to control cellular and bacterial 

adhesion by enhanced resistance to serum proteins. A straightforward way to build “stealth” substrates 

of any morphology is to use derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), a highly hydrated polymer 

effective in rendering surfaces non-adsorbent to proteins [116-118]. Another strategy is to add 

antimicrobial agents. Ettiene et al. have added defensin [119] and chromofungin [120] to the films 

constitution and reported growth inhibition up to 98% for Escherichia coli with defensin and 65% for 

Candida albicans with chromofungin. Rendering a surface non-fouling can serve as immuno-

‘‘camouflage’’ to prevent the immune rejection of implanted biomaterials or to enhance the efficiency of 

injected drug delivery vehicles. 

The application of LbL to more complex structures is highly important for tissue engineering 

applications such as cell culture platforms, where higher hierarchical organization better resembles 

native tissues. Besides bidimensional, spherical, and tubular shapes, more complex geometries such as 

agglomerated shapes can be fabricated and used as scaffolds for cell culture. LbL may be used to 

agglomerate beads [112] or to coat free-packet leachable templates [113] leading in both cases to

engineering applications

porous structures that may be populated by cells. Recently, Ye et al. [121] coated a decellularized 

porcine aortic valve with CHI and heparin showing anti-thrombotic properties. The device was shown to 

be hemocompatible by reducing platelet adhesion while allowing the proliferation of endothelial 

progenitor cells. The work of Sher, Custódio and Mano [113] introduced an interconnected three-

dimensional porous scaffold using a new drop-wise perfusion technique over a three-dimensional (3D) 

template formed by free-form moldable paraffin wax spheres held together only by the LbL coating 

(Figure 1.1).

The paraffin was dissolved by dichloromethane, leaving only the assembled layers as a scaffold. SaOs-2 

human osteoblast-like cells were seeded and showed attachment and proliferation. The authors did not 

characterize the system for its mechanical properties, however. It is possible that the resulting structure 

is not adequate for applications involving high loads, such as bone regeneration, but may be more 

appropriate for regenerating soft tissues, such as cartilage or nerves. 

1.4.2 Controlling cellular metabolism: encapsulation and differentiation 

Multilayer films may be of use for cell encapsulation since the films can coat various cell types and even 

be used to build multilayered cell architectures. Developing a device that provides immune protection 

via microencapsulation as well as enhanced control of both transport and surface physicochemical 

characteristics is an important and ambitious step in the development of an effective encapsulating 

barrier. One approach to encapsulate cells is by using coated liquefied capsules. For example, Costa et 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

18 

al. [122] have used liquefied alginate beads coated with CHI and ALG to immobilize SaOs-2 human 

osteoblast-like cells. Another cell encapsulation approach exploits cell surface charge to assemble 

polyelectrolytes. Krol et al. [123] pursued this surface charge approach with pancreatic islet cells to 

assemble a multilayer shell that effectively encapsulated them for the treatment of diabetes. By 

incubating Langerhans cells with alternating solutions of polycationic PAH or PDADMAC and polyanionic 

PSS, the authors built a barrier that covered and protected the cells. The shell was permeable and the 

cells were immunologically protected and retained their insulin secretion capability (Figure 1.2). The 

coating, however, consisted of synthetic materials which could be cytotoxic in the long term.

Veeradabran et al. [53] followed a similar approach to encapsulate individual mouse mesenchymal 

stem cells (MSCs) using PLL and HA. The cells were encapsulated within shells with thicknesses of 

approximately 6–9 nm. Cell morphology and viability were maintained for up to 1 week. Encapsulation 

has tremendous potential for the maintenance and differentiation of stem cells. LbL allows the 

encapsulating shells to be tuned to achieve optimal permeability. Nutrients, waste, and chemical 

differentiation factors could be exchanged between the cell and its external environment and the 

differentiation process triggered on demand. Other approaches have been introduced to drive the 

differentiation of cells by incorporating specific factors in a multilayer formulation. Dierich et al. [124] 

presented a formulation with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), PLL and poly(L-lysine succinylated) 

(PLLs), along with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and tissue growth factors (TGFs). Using this 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

19 

system, they were able to drive the differentiation of embryoid bodies into cartilage and bone. Another 

interesting approach is to embed differentiation factors into spherical shapes, which have a higher 

surface area and improved accessibility compared to planar substrates. Facca et al. [125] created 

capsules templated in silica particles (1 µm) coated with a similar formulation. The incubation with 

embryonic stem (ES) cells led to both in vitro and in vivo bone formation. It is unclear if the delivery of 

BMP was due to the degradation of the capsules or to their internalization by the cells. The latter option 

is a possibility: Rivera-Gil et al. [126] have recently demonstrated the internalization of multilayer 

capsules by embryonic NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. 

These encapsulation methods have proven to be novel approaches to shield cells from certain external 

factors and to controllably differentiate stem cells either by taking advantage of the permeable nature of 

multilayer films or by targeting the intracellular environment directly. Therefore, LbL structures have 

potential use for tissue engineering applications where cell transplantation or damaged tissue 

replacement is necessary. 

1.4.3 Biomimetic and “intelligent” and substrates 

Systems used for biomedical and tissue engineering applications must be biocompatible and not trigger 

toxic, inflammatory, or rejection responses. The structures and properties found in natural materials 

have inspired the development of multilayer systems with higher degrees of functionalization. One 

approach is to incorporate natural materials directly into multilayer systems. For instance, 

nanostructured films containing CHI retain some of CHI’s anti-microbial 

properties [127]. Another approach consists of integrating ingredient molecules, such as bioactive 

ligands, that can drive specific phenomena mimicking their native function. Picart et al. [128] 

incorporated arginine-glycine-(aspartic acid) (RGD) a cell adhesion promoter, with the substrate using 

PLL and RGD-grafted-PGA in the terminating layer. The proliferation of primary human osteoblast cells 

was enhanced on for films containing RGD compared to films without. RGD-enhanced proliferation was 

observed not only for simple adsorbed layers, but also for crosslinked films. To mimic the 

microenvironments of bone marrow and the thymus, Lee and Kotov [129] incorporated delta-like 1 

Notch ligands (DL-1) at the surface of PEM films. The Notch ligands stimulated hematopoietic stem 

cells (HSCs) to differentiate into T-cell lymphocytes and progressively develop their own ECM. 

Adding stimuli-responsive materials to multilayer formulations offers additional functionalization, by 

controlling surface properties and the conformational rearrangement of molecular chains. Stimuli-

responsive properties have been engineered into several types of systems, such as grafted surfaces and 

hydrogels [130], and are beginning to be used in multilayer systems for controlling biological events 

such as cell attachment/detachment. As mentioned before, pH and ionic strength may be useful stimuli 

response mechanisms for drug delivery applications, but changes of these variables beyond 

physiological conditions may be too aggressive for cell cultures. Temperature changes, on the other 

hand, are usually more tolerated by cells for temperatures up to 37°C. Costa et al. used an ELR 

containing RGD to generate bilayer coatings [131] and multiple stimuli-responsive multilayers [78] with 

enhanced cell adhesion. By varying the pH, ionic strength and temperature of CHI/ELR films, it was 

possible to switch the wettability of the substrates from a moderately hydrophobic character (contact 

angle around 70º) to a superhydrophilic (contact angle of 0º) (Figure 1.3).

However, the variation was observed for values not suitable for biological studies: pH 11; ionic strength 

0.15 M; and 50 ºC. Nevertheless, at physiological conditions, the cellular adhesion of a SaOs-2 

osteoblast-like cell line was higher than in films ending in CHI or a scrambled non-functional RDG 

sequence. Martins et al. [73] then described a multilayer system of ALG and PNIPAAm-grafted CHI to 

reproduce the cell-sheet technology [132]. SaOs-2 human osteoblast-like cells seeded onto coated 

substrates ending in the modified CHI were allowed to achieve confluence at 37ºC. Upon decreasing 

the temperature to 4ºC, the peeling effect enabled cells to be detached from the surface as a thin layer. 



Chapter 1. Nanostructured devices produced by layer-by-layer self-assembly adsorption for tissue 

engineering applications 

 

21 

Zahn et al. [133] demonstrated a similar approach by using the ion-induced detachment of myoblast 

layers by the eroding effect of ferrocyanide on PLL and HA multilayers. Incorporating biofunctional 

ingredients and bioinspired concepts into multilayer systems has enhanced the functionality of such 

systems and is producing promising results for tissue engineering applications. 

1.4.4 Multilayers in controlled drug delivery 

Current advances in biomedicine have been driven by the need to develop systems that can effectively 

encapsulate, protect and deliver an active agent with specific kinetics [134]. At the same time, distinct 

classes of biomolecules are widely available and related to the treatment of several diseases or the 

development of new biomedical devices. Ideally, a biomolecule carrier should act as a compartment 

with tunable drug permeability. The multilayered capsule systems described above are ideal for such 

drug delivery applications, including the associated methods to load and control the release of 

therapeutic molecules and growth/differentiation factors. The adequate loading efficiency and controlled 

release of the molecules of interest, such as growth factors, are necessary to ensure the survival of cells 

in tissue engineering applications. Erel et al. [135] fabricated hydrogen-bonded multilayers of micelles 

of poly[2-(N  - morpholino)ethyl methacrylate-block-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PMEMA-b   -

PDPA), a dicationic block copolymer, encapsulating pyrene onto a surface with tannic acid. The films 

were dual responsive and released pyrene upon increasing either temperature or pH. Crouzier et 

al. [136] developed crosslinked films of PLL and HA as reservoirs loaded with a recombinant human 

BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) to control the differentiation of myoblasts into fibroblasts. They demonstrated that the 

amount of loaded rhBMP-2 could be regulated by film thickness and assembly conditions. Also, the 

rhBMP-2 loaded in the films retained its bioactivity and was protected for three consecutive cultures. 

Another particular area being targeted for multilayer drug delivery systems is cancer treatment, where 

the uncontrolled systemic administration of chemotherapeutics comes with several drawbacks to the 

patients. Zhao et al. [137] developed CHI/ALG microcapsules loaded with doxorubicin, an effective 

anticancer drug, and demonstrated that the apoptosis of HepG2 tumor cells could be induced in vitro 

by incubating with loaded microcapsules. A suspension of microcapsules was also injected directly to 

tumors induced in mice, inducing a higher tumor inhibition compared to free drug administration. De 

Geest et al. [138] demonstrated that polymeric multilayer capsules (PMLCs) increase antigen delivery 

toward antigen-presenting cells in vivo, enforcing antigen presentation and stimulating T-cell 

proliferation. Poon et al. [139] recently addressed the stability and biodistribution of electrostatic self-

22 

assembled nanoparticles for systemic administration and off-body tracing by imaging techniques. They 

provided evidence of the importance of a larger number of layers and the role of the terminating layer in 

terms of functional retention. A formulation of PLL and dextran films topped with a final layer of HA 

assembled onto gold nanoparticles or quantum dots. In mice, these coated particles had a blood 

elimination half-life of 9 hours and low liver accumulation. These reports represent a step forward the 

use of LbL systems in in vivo applications such as cancer treatment, and augment the mounting 

evidence that such systems can be designed to have minimal or no negative effects on living organisms. 

1.4.5 Biomineralized multilayers 

Developing systems with LbL technology to facilitate bone regeneration or to improve the mechanical 

properties of substrates is an active area of research. Such research is adding versatility to 

biomineralization processes by developing controlled nanostructured assemblies that tune the kinetics 

of calcium phosphate, apatite formation, and ultimately bone regeneration [140-142]. 

Bioactive coatings on orthopedic implants may create an environment compatible with osteogenesis 

and provide bone-friendly interfaces for forming natural bonding junctions between the implant and host 

bone [143]. Couto, Alves and Mano [33] developed hybrid films of CHI and bioactive glass 

nanoparticles that mimicked the brick-and-mortar layered structured of nacre. They showed that the 

incorporation of BNPs rendered the substrates prone to mineralization upon immersion in simulated 

body fluid (SBF) solution. The mineralization was also more pronounced with an increasing number of 

layers. Fukui and Fujimoto [144] described a hybrid nanocapsule templated in phospholipids that 

encapsulated phosphate ions (Figure 1.4). The phospholipids were coated using CHI, dextran or DNA 

and then incubated in a solution containing calcium ions. They demonstrated that the chemical surface 

change could influence the counter-ion diffusion and therefore the mineralization rate.

1.5 Conclusion 

For the past 20 years, the use of LbL as a processing technique has evolved from traditional surface 

modification on two-dimensional (2D) planar surfaces to three-dimensional (3D) environments. The 

procedure can even be performed using mild conditions and in a cell-friendly environment. The most 

recent results show that LbL may be used to encapsulate cells, control cell adhesion and metabolism, 

tune the release of encapsulated molecules, render a substrate with smart responsiveness, and 

enhance mineralization. We believe that the technology will follow two trends in the near future. The first 

trend will involve using existing nanostructured multilayer devices in more in vivo applications that take 

advantage of the spatial organization and bioactivity, adjustable stiffness and chemistry, or adjustable 

stiffness and bioactivity, of multilayer devices. The other trend will involve the development of more 

intricate structures with hierarchical complexity embedded in devices with multiple functionalities, such 

as controlling the diffusion of gases and nutrients to cultured cells. Higher levels of functionalization 

should enable the development of systems exhibiting intelligent responses to external stimuli. For 

example, drug release systems could respond to an external stimulus by releasing encapsulated drugs 

and therefore influencing cellular metabolism on demand. The inclusion of specific ligands or metallic 

particles could enable the development of targeted delivery strategies for cell therapies and transplant.

In summary, research on nanostructured multilayer devices will likely result in innovative low-cost 

technologies to meet critical biomedical needs.

Abstract 

Layer-by-layer (LbL) was first introduced as a surface modification technique based on the sequential 

spontaneous adsorption of at least two distinct materials to planar substrates. In the last two decades, 

this technique has evolved to the coating of more convoluted geometries with high levels of tailored 

functionalization or with structural purposes. In this review, the potential uses of LbL films in biomedical 

engineering based mainly in the assembly of polyelectrolytes are reviewed. Examples of recent 

developments are provided, from the modification of substrates to improve their biointegration or to add 

specialized properties, to the three-dimensional extrapolation of this technique as more complex 

structures for cell seeding, drug delivery devices, biosensors and customizable microreactors. Future 

strategies and opportunities are compared with current medical and laboratorial methodologies. 

Through them, it is expected that LbL will contribute greatly to the development of new functional 

devices with high perspectives of return for the administration of active agents, biosensing and 

construction of microtissues and disease models in laboratory.

2.1 Introduction 

Surface modification is a prominent field of engineering of utmost importance for biomedical 

applications. When having in mind the contact of a medical device with the human body – resulting 

from surgical or topical implantation – the reaction to this “foreign body” must be considered. The 

surface of a medical device is the first contact with the biological environment. Upon contact, a series of 

bio-recognition processes (such as protein/cell adhesion and inflammatory response) occur between 

the surface of biomaterials and the biological environment [1-5]. It is evident that such interface defines 

whether the device will be accepted or rejected by the body, and therefore the surface properties play 

an extremely important role in its success. 

Surface engineering has been commonly achieved through techniques such as plasma [6], polymer 

grafting [7], micro/nanofabrication [8] and Langmuir-Blodgett [9]. Each one of them, different as they 

may seem, often aim for the same goal: to modify the characteristics of a selected surface while 

retaining the properties of the bulk materials. Using the example of artificial prosthesis, the surface 

could be improved for better biointegration through the enhancement of its antimicrobial properties, 

biocompatibility, degradation resistance and drug loading capability [10-12], while preserving the native 

mechanical properties. 

It is notable how surface modification in biomedical applications has motivated so much interest in the 

scientific community. Nowadays, modifying a surface is no longer limited to the improvement of an 

implant’s integration. Technological ramifications have allowed producing surfaces that respond to 

stimuli, tune cell adhesion, mineralize and adjust the permeability of active agents’ carriers [13-16]. In 

particular, surfaces containing nano- or micro-scale features in a well-controlled manner have been 

shown to influence cellular adhesion and metabolism [17]. In this sense, surface modification has also 

become a synonym of “control”. 

Taking Nature as the greatest of inspirations, scientists and engineers have developed many biomimetic 

concepts based on the constant evolutionary improvement of designs and functionalities of natural 

occurring materials [18]. One example is the layered organization found in natural materials, such as 

the case of nacre found in the shells of sea animals. Nacre consists in a hierarchical and layered 

structure of calcium minerals capable of dissipating high amounts of mechanical energy [19-21]. In an 

attempt to mimic natural layered structures, a strategy consisting in the alternate adsorption of 

polyelectrolytes onto solid surfaces – polyanions and polycations – was introduced. In this process, two 

or more constituents can be added on top of a substrate sequentially with nanometric precision as 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

40 

many times as desired, until stacks of numerous layers give rise to multilayered thin films. This concept 

was first introduced by Iller [22] in 1966, who assembled alternate layers of positively and negatively 

charged colloidal particles (such as silica and alumina) onto solid smooth surfaces. Later, Decher and 

Hong [23] expanded this concept using anionic and cationic bipolar amphiphiles containing rigid 

biphenyl cores, and adsorbed them alternately onto a positively charged planar surface. They 

demonstrated the construction of a film with 35 amphiphile layers accounting for a total thickness of 

170 nm. After completion of their follow-up work [24,25] this strategy became known as layer-by-layer 

(LbL). Since its introduction, it has become one of the most prominent surface engineering strategies in 

materials science, capable of providing a reliable, easy, versatile and cost-effective way of tuning 

interfaces. Furthermore, a wide variety of constituents can be selected. The only requirement is that 

multipoint interactions – such as electrostatic contacts, van der Walls forces, and hydrogen bonding – 

exist between each of them to enable their sequential adsorption [1,26-30]. It is a simple and versatile 

technique that allows producing robust coatings, even in substrates with convoluted and three 

dimensional geometries. Harmful solvents (e.g., crosslinkers, organic solvents) and harsh processing 

conditions (e.g., high temperatures, extreme pH values) are seldom required, making LbL an attractive 

technique for biological-based applications. Specialized biomaterials and ligands, such as cell adhesion 

enhancers, may be used in order to mimic biological structures and functions, rendering a substrate 

more instructive for cell behavior [27,31]. Multilayered films can also act as drug reservoirs: active 

agents may be embedded in the multilayer constitution while preserving their bioactivity, especially 

when the protection of drugs until their delivery is desired [32,33]. 

Due to the broad scope and fast development of LbL, dozens of review articles have contributed to this 

topic in the last decade. In 2006, Kotov and coworkers [30] focused on a comprehensive review about 

the bioactivity of multilayer films for biomedical applications, such as superhydrophobic surfaces, 

biosensors, drug delivery, protein/cell adhesion, mediation of cellular functions and implantable 

materials. These authors estimated that LbL could be extrapolated to the third dimension in the 

following years in order to conceive scaffolds with specific embedded growth factors, receptors, or 

ligands. Their expectations have been met as several works have showed the production of complex 

geometrical structures using this technology. Another review by Picart and coworkers [1] in 2010 

reminded us of the fundamentals of LbL and how the experimental conditions affect the final properties 

of a multilayer films. Namely, the mechanism of exponential growth, which describes an alternative non-

linear model of thickness growth per layer, was reflected upon. In 2012, Tong, Song and Gao [34] 

reviewed the construction of spherical containers (namely capsules) for drug delivery, biosensing and 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

41 

confining chemical reactions, showing how LbL has surpassed the simple idea of improving interfaces 

and creating functional surfaces. 

In this review, we intend to discuss the state-of-the-art developments of LbL-based strategies, especially 

those with applicability in the biomedical field. Through selected recent examples from the literature, we 

will discuss how LbL has been established as a conventional surface modification technique in little 

more than 20 years thanks to this technique’s capability to address a wide range of biomedical 

applications. Simultaneously, it is our intention to open the question of whether LbL, as it stands now, 

surpasses other existent technologies and what potential is still reserved for the future development of 

multilayered biomedical devices with value for biomedical applications. 

2.2 Fundamentals of the layer-by-layer technique 

2.2.1 Layer-by-Layer as a tool for surface modification 

LbL adsorption relies in the interaction between two or more distinct materials that possess 

complementary interactions, i.e. that the properties of both materials result in their mutual attraction. 

The most exploited buildup mechanism of multilayer films is the assembly driven by electrostatic 

interactions of oppositely charged components, as depicted in Figure 2.1.  

 

 

Figure 2.1. Schematics of layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes based on an electrostatic 

mechanism deposition. The procedure is based on the contact of the substrate with a solution with an 

oppositely charged polymer. In the depicted example, negatively charged round substrates are 

submerged in an aqueous solution of a polycation, followed by a solution containing a polyanion. Each 

adsorption stage is separated by a rinsing step, to remove loosely adsorbed molecules. 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

42 

Besides electrostatic assembly, constructing multilayer films may rely on short-range interactions, such 

as van der Walls forces and hydrogen bonding [35-37]. Nowadays it is acknowledged that the gain in 

entropy due to the release of counterions plays a key role in the LbL adsorption process. Its outcome is 

often the organization of the layers in a more coiled and interdigitated conformation, leading the 

polyelectrolyte molecules to lose degrees of freedom [38-40]. 

Many types of charged molecules and nano-objects are suitable for deposition by electrostatic 

interactions, from nanoparticles [41-43], carbon nanotubes [44,45], clay platelets [46], 

dendrimers [47,48], polysaccharides [49-51], polypeptides [52-54], nucleic acids [55,56] and viral 

components [57,58]. Special emphasis has been given to synthetic polyelectrolytes, such as the widely 

investigated poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system – considered so 

far as a model of multilayered thin films [1]. Synthetic materials are usually highly versatile materials 

with well-defined structures with tailored properties, such as molecular weight and charge density [59]. 

Thanks to their tailored properties these systems have been used as a means to determine the 

influence of several construction conditions involved in the LbL buildup. For example, it is known that 

varying the pH of weak polyelectrolytes also varies the protonation state of their ionizable groups, this 

way influencing the availability of charged groups; additionally, a moderate ionic strength can help 

reducing electrostatic repulsion between charged groups and favor electrostatic assembly [60-62]. 

Another parameter is temperature, which increases the mobility of the adsorbed molecules and the 

chances of finding more energetically optimal binding sites at the deposition site [63]. 

Synthetic materials have served their purpose, but for biomedical applications materials that exhibit 

biological features should be more appropriate. Natural materials are intricate structures which have 

risen from hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Comparing to our current technology, Nature was 

able to conceive structures more multifaceted than man-made materials, forming complex arrays, 

hierarchical structures and multifunctionality [11,64,65]. Natural materials often avoid triggering 

chronic or immunological reactions and toxicity, and are therefore appropriate multifunctional 

ingredients for constructing multilayer films and coatings with improved interface with the biological 

environment [66]. 

2.2.2 Moving LbL toward faster production 

The number of parameters that may influence the buildup of multilayer films is broad: LbL requires 

complementarity between the multilayer constituents, but the strength of the forces driving the 

assembly may be influenced by other parameters. Intrinsic properties – such as the molecular weight of 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

43 

polymers or size of inorganic particles, charge density and polarity – and external properties – such as 

temperature, pH of the solvent and ionic strength – may facilitate or hinder a constituent’s adsorption. 

The result depends on the original properties of the materials. For instance, varying the pH of a weak 

polyelectrolyte above or below its acidic constant (pKa) will greatly impact on its overall charge density 

and ultimately electrostatic interactions [67,68]. Therefore, the construction of multilayer films based on 

new and not much used constituents may require a thorough preliminary screening process. 

Nonetheless, as soon as this temporal hardship is overcome, the optimal conditions will be determined 

and they can be applied in the mass-production robust nanostructured coatings. 

Despite all the presented advantages of LbL, this technique has one fundamental drawback: it is 

generally a time-consuming process. To construct a multilayer film, the adsorption time to assemble a 

single layer may vary with the nature of the constituents. A standard time of 10 minutes is usually 

acceptable, plus a rinsing step that may take an equivalent time scale. Surprisingly, the effect of 

reducing the processing times (sacrificing some mass deposition) was never properly addressed as a 

way to accelerate the fabrication of the films. In a scale-up perspective, and when large numbers of 

layers are required, automated devices have been proposed for the production of multilayer films. The 

most common devices are dipping machines, which allow parallel construction of several films at once. 

They function similarly to manual dipping in every aspect but its automated nature permits not only the 

repetition of multiple adsorption cycles over long construction times but also the parallel assembly of 

multiple films. This way, thicker multilayer films with several micrometers can be obtained in high 

quantities [69-71]. 

One could argue that, although many films can be fabricated in parallel, the fabrication time is still too 

long. An alternative procedure is a sputtering-based strategy which, rather than dipping, sprays the 

surface. The fabrication time of the latter has been reported to be greatly shortened due to enhanced 

adsorption by the spray pressure. Schlenoff, Dubas and Farhat [72] showed the construction of 

poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PDADMAC/PSS) multilayer films by 

spraying the respective solutions onto silicon wafers. For that purpose, they used a sprayer as simple as 

a hand-operated “plant mister”, making it possible for each layer to be adsorbed in a matter of seconds. 

Their morphology, uniformity, and chemical composition were similar to coatings made by dipping. 

Izquierdo et al. [70] followed a similar spraying strategy for the assembly of PSS/poly(allylamine) 

hydrochloride (PAH) multilayers, where they reiterated the findings of the previous authors. 

Although the process of LbL started as being an inherently slow processing method that requires a 

lengthy preliminary screening stage, these drawbacks have been addressed and reduced to a minimum 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

44 

in the last decade [73]. Furthermore, the use of automated devices, including unconventional 

sputtering-based approaches, have made it possible to construct multilayers a lot faster (about a factor 

of 250 in the latter example) and are appropriate for future industrial mass-production with low risk of 

stock shortage. 

2.3 Surfaces with specialized properties 

2.3.1 Surfaces containing adhesive constituents 

Multilayer films and coatings can exhibit higher forms of specialized properties by selecting functional 

materials as their components. One such example is the use of polymers that are known to exhibit 

adhesive properties in nature. Without much effort, a great source of adhesive natural materials can be 

found in the sea, such as the polysaccharides chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG). CHI is derived from 

chitin, found in the exoskeleton of shellfish or crustaceans, like shrimp and crabs, and ALG is a 

structural component found in brown algae. These two polysaccharides share a marine origin and 

exhibit important properties for biomedical applications – biocompatible, adhesive, nontoxic, 

bacteriostatic, fungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic [66,74] – which proved to be useful in drug 

delivery, implants and wound dressings [75-77]. Another strategy to obtain adhesive materials is to 

produce synthetic analogues based on natural systems, such as the adhesive proteins rich in 3,4-

dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA). DOPA, also a precursor of dopamine, can be found in the threads 

expressed by mussels, which have been shown to attach to many types of inorganic and organic 

surfaces thanks to the exhibition of catechol hydroxyl groups [78,79]. Catechol-modified biomimetic 

polymers can be used to aid in the construction of the multilayer film itself. As demonstrated by 

Lee et al. [80] catechol-functionalized poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA) adsorbed could 

be adsorbed onto any sort of substrate, namely poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), silicon and gold. 

Karabulut et al. [81] exploited the iron(III) (Fe3+) crosslinking mechanism of catechol groups to tune the 

mechanical properties of films made of carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibrils modified with dopamine. 

The adhesive forces were measured using a silica probe demonstrating that, in the presence of Fe
3+

, 

dopamine-functionalized films are more resistant to deformation than films prepared from unmodified 

nanofibrils. Wu et al. [82] prepared multilayers of PAH and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), the latter modified 

with dopamine, and crosslinked the films by an oxidation reaction mediated by sodium periodate for 

better stability. These coatings could be peeled by a sodium hydroxide solvent, providing undamaged 

free-standing membranes. Curiously, DOPA and its analogues have been used as a mechanism to 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

45 

improve the construction of LbL films, rather than increasing adhesiveness to surrounding tissues. It is 

however expectable that the adhesiveness of such films is indeed augmented, judging by how catechol-

modified gels and membranes behave.[83-85] 

Adhesive materials can be found in places other than the sea. For instance, Costa et al. [86] assembled 

multilayer films made of CHI and phosphonate-modified levan, a fructan exopolysaccharide produced by 

the halophilic bacterium Halomonas smyrnensis sp. nov. AAD6T. The adhesiveness of this polymer 

comes from their hydroxyl groups that form strong adhesive bonds with various substrates [87,88]. The 

adhesiveness of these films was verified by lap shear bonding stress between two overlapped films with 

100 bilayers assembled onto glass slides, meaning that no peeling was attempted. In comparison to 

CHI/ALG films used as controls – two polysaccharides often regarded as good natural adhesives – the 

detachment force of the levan-functionalized surfaces was about 3 times higher than the control 

(2.5±0.3 MPa and 0.9±0.1 MPa, respectively). The cell adhesion for 24 h conducted using a fibroblast 

cell line also showed that cells were sensitive to the incorporation of levan and adhered mostly to these 

coatings (110 cells?mm
-2

 in comparison to 20 cells?mm
-2

 in the control). 

The technology of LbL films using adhesive materials has the potential to address issues related to 

wound healing, namely in the performance of medical adhesives. Many synthetic adhesives currently 

approved present limitations, which include poor adhesion in the presence of biological fluids, allergic 

response and inflammation [89]. Therefore, the use of natural adhesive constituents may help in the 

development of wound healing dressings and surgical biomaterials with improved adhesiveness to 

organs and tissues. 

2.3.2 Mineralization control 

Bone regeneration and integration is probably one of the most researched areas in biomedical 

engineering and a variety of systems have been proposed for this purpose [90-92]. Using the recurrent 

example of orthopedic bone implants, coatings that exhibit biomineralization capability may provide a 

favorable environment for osteogenesis and a bone-friendly interface between the implant and host’s 

bone [93,94]. 

Biomineralization can be achieved following two strategies: (i) addition of inorganic components (e.g. 

silicate-based particles), or (ii) incorporation of osteoinductive molecules (e.g. polymers and proteins). 

An example of (i) are bioactive glasses. These materials have been subject of much research in the last 

decades because when in contact with physiological or simulated body fluids they form a surface 

apatite layer.  Such apatite layer permits an adjusted bonding of the implant to bone in vivo, preventing 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

46 

the formation of a fibrous capsule and promoting a stronger osseo-integration. Ultimately, this layer can 

bind to the collagen of connective tissue cells, like osteoblasts [95]. In the case of (ii), bone 

morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are well-known growth factors which have been widely used for bone 

repair and are known to stimulate the proliferation, migration and differentiation of stem cells [96]. 

One would not expect LbL devices to be used as systems aimed to integrate or regenerate a hard tissue 

such as bone, since most polymeric multilayer films do not exhibit mechanical properties equivalent to 

the bone. However, it may be used to engineer an appropriate interface between an implantable device 

and bone, since LbL allows incorporating distinct classes of materials in their structure. Thus, strategies 

can be devised to convert a “soft” multilayer to the purpose of triggering biomineralization. 

Couto, Alves and Mano [41] constructed multilayer films that contained bioglass nanoparticles as an 

inorganic ingredient that provided biomineralization capability in vitro. The synthesized nanoparticles 

had a charge of -25 mV, which enabled them to interact with the polycationic CHI via electrostatic 

interactions. Using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM), they demonstrated that films up to 10 bilayers 

could be successfully assembled. Using a simulated body fluid (SBF), they showed that it was possible 

to induce the formation of apatite crystalline layers, similar to the ones found in the inorganic 

component of bone. The mineralization was also more pronounced with increasing number of layers. 

Fukui and Fujimoto [97] described the conception of a nanocapsule templated in phospholipids that 

encapsulated phosphate ions. The phospholipids were coated using CHI, dextran sulfate or DNA and 

then incubated in a solution containing calcium ions. They demonstrated that changes in the surface 

chemistry could influence the counterion diffusion and therefore the biomineralization rate (Figure 2.2). 

Despite the efforts made so far, biomineralization-inducing multilayers still remain a largely unexplored 

approach. Most likely the reason lies within the fact that immobilizing particles inside a multilayer 

structure is not an easy task. While a polymeric film may have only a few nanometers but an 

interpenetrated structure, a nanoparticle can be very large in comparison. Thus, it is likely that the 

production of biomineralizing surfaces will be limited to the loading of osteoconductive agents.

For instance, Hu et al. [98] took another approach by adding bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) 

and fibronectin to a CHI/gelatin (GEL) multilayer formulation. Disks and rods of a titanium alloy were 

first subjected to the adsorption of a layer of GEL conjugated with dopamine – a fine example of how 

dopamine and its analogues can be used as the starting layer of any substrate, as previously 

demonstrated by Lee et al. [80] Next a combination of CHI, unmodified GEL, recombinant human bone 

morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and fibronectin was used. The in vitro release of rhBMP-2 showed 

that 30% of the initial adsorbed amount was released within 2 hours and around 50% after 6 days. After 

2 weeks, around 20% was still retained at the surface. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded 

onto these substrates up to 21 days and showed higher production levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 

mineralization and expression of osteogenic genes compared to a control of bare titanium substrate. In 

vivo studies using a rabbit femur model were carried out up to 12 weeks and were shown to increase

48 

the density and formation of bone. More examples of multilayered systems containing BMPs will 

provided later in this review, in the context of drug delivery systems (Section 2.5.3). 

2.3.3 Stimuli-responsive surfaces 

Higher degrees of functionalization can be achieved by introducing stimuli-responsive constituents. 

Usually, a surface – modified or not – is perceived as a static interface, that is, no structural changes 

occur upon switching environmental parameters. However, stimuli-responsive surfaces are dynamic and 

undergo conformational changes upon variations of specific external factors. An elegant example found 

in Nature exhibiting such mechanism is skin. Skin is the largest organ of the human body and it can be 

perceived as the ideal multifunctional membrane that responds to every variation in its environment – 

heat/cold, humidity, chemical/mechanical stress and even light [99]. Exploiting external stimuli has 

been extensively researched for several devices, such as grafted surfaces and hydrogels [100], but not 

as much in multilayer systems for controlling biological events, like cell attachment/detachment 

mechanisms. Some works described films made of CHI and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a 

recombinant class of elastin-like polymers (ELPs). ELRs are genetically modified polypeptides that 

undergo a phase transition when in solution dependent on temperature: below a critical transition 

temperature, the free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations; above it, they fold into an 

organized structure known as ?-spiral [101]. Using this polysaccharide/polypeptide formulation, both 

bilayer coatings [102] and multiple responsive multilayers [27] were made. In the latter, variations of 

pH, ionic strength and temperature triggered a transition of wettability between a moderately 

hydrophobic character (contact angle around 70º) to a superhydrophilic surface (contact angle of 0º). 

These variations were observed above pH 11, ionic strength 1.25 M in NaCl, and temperature of 50ºC. 

The genetic nature of ELRs permitted the inclusion of the cell adhesion sequence arginine-glycine-

aspartic acid (RGD), the minimal sequence required for recognition by cell membrane integrins [103]. 

The adhesion of osteoblast-like cells was higher in these films than in films ending in CHI or a 

scrambled nonfunctional RDG analogue. Although cell adhesion was influenced by the exhibition of 

specialized bioactive groups, the possibility to use external stimuli to control the attachment or 

detachment of cells was not explored. The reason lies in the fact that the variation of the surface 

properties evaluated in terms of wettability variations only occurred at values that are simply not 

suitable for biological experiments. However, in another report from the same group [104], a multilayer 

film made of ALG and CHI modified with poly(N - isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) was developed to 

reproduce the cell-sheet technology developed by Okano and coworkers [105], which allows a thin layer 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

49 

of cells to be harvested for reculture, transplantation or differentiation. Human osteoblast-like cells were 

seeded until confluence was achieved at 37ºC and the temperature was lowered afterwards to 4ºC. 

Cells started to peel and detached from the surface as a thin layer, which occurs due to the extension 

of the PNIPAAm chains and increase of hydrophilicity. These cell-sheets could be harvested and seeded 

again in a different culture support to demonstrate their viability. A similar approach was demonstrated 

by Zahn et al. [106] who used an ion-induced detachment of myoblast cell layers through the eroding 

effect of ferrocyanide on PLL/HA multilayers. 

Temperature, ionic strength, and pH can be easily manipulated to influence the response of 

“intelligent” materials contained within the LbL formulation. However, sharp variations of the last two 

may be aggressive to cells as they are not capable of withstanding hypotonic/hypertonic and extreme 

acid/alkaline conditions. Temperature changes, on the other hand, are usually more tolerated by cells 

for temperatures up to 37ºC,  and the example of cell-sheet technology is a fine example of that [107]. 

Another stimulus that may be exploited is light. The use of light would be a convenient way of 

controlling a surface’s properties since it can be easily emitted or blocked on demand. Moreover, 

biomedical applications could benefit from its noninvasive character, capability of deep tissue 

penetration and fine spatial control over its intensity [108]. One example of light-responsive films is the 

work of Ahmad, Saqib and Barret [109], who developed films containing anionic azobenzene-

functionalized polyelectrolytes. The polyelectrolytes were distinct and exhibited different 

hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity character, which ultimately reflected upon the ultraviolet (UV)-visible 

absorption spectrum of each film. Azobenzenes linked to hydrophilic groups exhibited higher absorption 

maxima (423–440 nm) than azobenzenes linked to hydrophobic groups (407–414 nm), in both cases 

values slightly higher than the maximum UV wavelength of 400 nm. Multilayer systems that respond to 

light are seldom referred in the literature. This may be related to the fact that most light-sensitive 

molecules respond mostly to light in the UV spectrum, which is harmful to biological cells. Nevertheless, 

the presented example shows how the inclusion of light-responsive groups linked to distinct radical 

groups may help shifting the maximum absorption wavelengths toward the visible spectrum. 

2.4 Coating of implantable devices 

The modification of implantable medical devices is perhaps the most evident application resulting from 

LbL strategies in the biomedical field. The versatility of LbL and the possibility of developing surfaces 

with specialized properties have already been applied as a means to improve the integration and to 

adjust the biorecognition of implantable devices, such as prosthesis and stents. Currently, most of the 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

50 

improvements in the performance of an implant are possible thanks to the development of more 

anatomically-shaped geometries. This is particularly evident in the case of bone implants, which are 

increasingly easier to attach to the bone and provide more comfort for the patients [110-112]. Besides 

design, it is known that an efficient integration is determined mainly by the surface characteristics of the 

implantable device (surface microstructure and chemical/biochemical nature), which influence the 

subsequent adhesion of proteins and cells. It is common to find metallic implants (e.g. steel or titanium) 

during surgical interventions [3,10,113]. However, it is difficult to assume that a metal with no 

resemblance to biological materials provides appropriate integration and recognition by the body. 

Therefore, LbL constitutes an adequate methodology to modify the surface of implantable devices, as it 

could be employed regardless of their geometry. 

2.4.1 Coating of synthetic implantable devices 

Most metallic alloys are negatively charged, like other common materials found outside the medical 

field (e.g., glass), and thus provide support for the formation of a multilayer coating by adsorbing a 

primer polycationic layer [30]. Zhankovich et al. [114] proposed to coat a titanium alloy using multilayer 

coatings of either CHI/GEL or CHI/HA to improve osseo-integration. Their study was based on prior 

conclusions by the same group that had shown showed that while CHI/GEL coatings stimulated the in 

vitro adhesion and proliferation of human osteoblasts, CHI/HA coatings reduced it [115]. So, using a 

rat tibia model, shear strength analysis did not show any biomechanical difference between the coated 

implants and a control of uncoated implants after 3 weeks. However, after 8 weeks, compared to the 

titanium alloy control, shear strength was increased up to 1.84-fold and 1.86-fold for CHI/GEL and 

CHI/HA, respectively, indicating improved osseo-integration of the implant to the surrounding tissue. 

Interestingly, these results contradicted their expectation to observe significantly higher integration with 

GEL-coated implants. The explanation to this similar osseo-integration observed in the rat tibia model 

could be due to the long-term exposure of the coating to a biological environment. This exposure could 

have led to the partial dissolution of the outer HA layer and its inhibitory effect decreased. CHI would 

then come in contact with the biological tissue and promote osteoblast proliferation. Both works 

demonstrate the potential of LbL modified implants in orthopedic implant surgery, even using very 

simple biopolymers, where a regulated osteointegration is desirable to avoid early loosening, especially 

when osteoporotic fractures are involved. 

Aiming for the treatment of coronary artery diseases, stents have been coated with polymeric 

films [116,117]. Stents with no modification can trigger thrombosis and cytokines secretion, leading to 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

51 

in-stent restenosis – a particular refractory form of neointimal hyperplasia [118]. Schweizer et al. [119] 

coated nitinol stents with a multilayer formulation of CHI and heparin, a well-known glucosaminoglycan 

with anticoagulant properties. First, tubes made of the stent bulk material were coated and bent in a 

37º angle, showing that the LbL coating could be maintained and withstand mechanical loading. Then, 

they conducted a mineralization study by immersion in a calcium nitrate and ammonium phosphate 

bath in agitation for one week. The formation of calcium phosphate particles with less than 100 nm was 

observed in the coated stents, while in the control large microcrystals were formed. Large calcium 

phosphate crystals may be dangerous if released and transported into the blood stream, but 

nanocrystals are not expected to trigger high thrombogenicity. Furthermore, they may help to increase 

the mechanical stability of the assembled multilayers. In the same study, titanium samples were coated 

and studied simultaneously. Surprisingly, crystals on the order of 10 ?m were observed on coated 

samples, much larger than in the case of coated nitinol ones. This conclusion alerts to the role of the 

substrate used, since it is likely that synergistic effects occur between not only the coating constituents 

but also between the assembled coating and the substrate’s chemistry. The use of CHI/heparin films 

may also result in antibacterial activity and suppression of blood clot formation, respectively. In fact, 

Meng et al. [120] had previously shown that stainless steel coronary stents with the same coating has a 

better hemocompatibility and more efficient re-endotelyzation than bare metallic samples, using a 

porcine coronary injury model. 

Lin et al. [121] tested the hypothesis that a stent that promotes the adhesion of endothelial cells – 

either circulating in the blood or migrating from neighbor tissues – facilitates its integration and reduces 

risk of stent failure. Stainless steel stents were coated with heparin/collagen multilayers, which could be 

or not be further functionalized with an anti-CD34 antibody. Both types of samples and a control of 

uncoated stents were implanted in rabbit femoral arteries. While no significant difference of neointimal 

hyperplasia was observed between uncoated metal stents and heparin/collagen multilayer modified 

stents, neointimal hyperplasia on the anti-CD34 antibody-functionalized multilayer coated stents was 

significantly inhibited and provided an accelerated adhesion of both vascular and endothelial cells 

(Figure 2.3).

Post-surgical infection due to bacterial contamination constitutes another major issue that leads to 

implant failure. Bacteria can form biofilms on the surface of implants, therefore compromising the 

performance of the device [122]. Therefore, it is crucial that initial bacteria adhesion to an implant’s 

surface is prevented. Building multilayer films that exhibit antifouling properties is a possible solution for 

this problem. Rendering a surface non-fouling can serve as immuno-‘‘camouflage’’ to prevent immune 

rejection of implanted biomaterials or to enhance the efficiency of injected drug delivery vehicles [123-

125]. Reisch et al. [126] demonstrated that films containing PAH and a PAA containing 

phosphorylcholine side chains resisted the adsorption of albumin, which served as an estimation of 

cellular adhesion. Caruso and coworkers [127] demonstrated that PSS/PAH multilayer films with a 

terminal layer of PSS-b- poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were up to five-fold more resistant to bovine serum 

albumin (BSA) adsorption than PSS-terminated films. Moreover, the binding of coated polystyrene 

particles to human colorectal cancer cells was reduced 6.5-fold in comparison to native PSS-terminated 

particles. However, since LbL allows the inclusion of active agents to the formulation of a multilayer 

coating, the most straightforward strategy to avoid deleterious effects caused by microorganisms is 

perhaps the addition of antimicrobial agents. For instance, Hammond and coworkers [128] coated 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

53 

silicon substrates with N,N - dodecyl,methyl-poly(ethylenimine) (DMPEI) as a polycation with microbicidal 

activity and a polyanion, such as PAA. The surfaces proved to be lethal against airborne and waterborne 

bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and viruses (influenza virus, strain H1N1). 

2.4.2 Cells as supports for the assembly of multilayer coatings 

Cell therapies based on bioencapsulation strategies have recently found utility in the treatment of 

numerous pathologies, such as for diabetes, bone and cartilage defects, and cancer. Usually, ALG is 

the most frequently employed biomaterial for the encapsulation of cells due to its abundance, water 

solubility, mild gelling properties, high biocompatibility, and resemblance to the natural extracellular 

matrix (ECM). However, the diffusion of essential molecules in hydrogels is usually less efficient than in 

liquefied environments, which may compromise cell survivability [129,130]. 

Developing a device that provides immune protection and selective permeability is an important and 

ambitious step in the development of an effective encapsulating barrier [131-133]. In the field of LbL 

implantable devices, cells or cell agglomerates can be used as suitable substrates for the buildup of 

multilayers. Therefore, cell surface engineering offers great potential to improve clinical outcomes 

associated with this promising class of therapeutic devices. 

An application that would benefit greatly of such approach would be the treatment of diabetes. The 

widespread clinical solution for this disease is that of islet transplantation, but this brings problems such 

as immune rejection, inflammation, thrombosis, hypoxia and weakened revascularization [134-136], 

leading ultimately to the destruction of the encapsulated cells. Krol et al. [137] demonstrated that 

Langerhan cells could be effectively coated with the polycations PAH or PDADMAC. Coating pancreatic 

cells with multilayers is an alternative to the conventional microencapsulation approaches within highly 

viscous ultrapure alginate droplets [138-140]. By taking advantage of the negative charge provided by 

the peri-islet capsule, polycations could be adsorbed to the membrane of the cells, followed by the 

polyanionic PSS. The multilayer coating succeeded in providing immunological protection to the cells. 

They also retained their insulin secretory function in vitro up to 4 days and diffusion was allowed 

through the coating. Furthermore, insulin release increased when high quantities of glucose were 

present. This is a very promising approach of LbL for the development of effective cellular therapies, 

which seemed promising to solve diabetes related problems, and their application in vivo was most 

anticipated. 

Recently, Wilson et al. [141] presented a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) comprised of ALG and 

poly(L-lysine) (PLL)-g-PEG to coat the surface of pancreatic islet cells. The surface engineered islets 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

54 

were introduced through the portal vein and into the liver microvasculature in diabetic mice. Two weeks 

after transplantation, 47% of the mice receiving the coated islets converted from a diabetic to an 

euglycemic state, while 25% of mice that received uncoated cells showed improvements. 

Given these examples, one can see that LbL-based strategies have the potential to improve the 

integration of diverse types of implants. It can be easily applied to existing biomedical devices implants 

and even to biological materials like cells for transplantation purposes. The possibility to introduce 

functionalized and bioactive materials to a surface may lead ultimately to a good integration in a living 

system and constitutes an advantage in comparison to other conventional techniques (e.g., temperature 

and plasma treatments). The possibility to coat biological structures directly is unusual and may have a 

great impact in the management of cellular viability prior and after implantation. This technology may 

be extended to develop cellular strategies, for instance in the form of cell infusions that may be injected 

intravenously for delivery to targeted tissues, such as the heart, or with other therapeutic functions, 

such as immunoregulation or systemic production of growth factors. 

2.5 Engineering biomedical devices 

2.5.1 Construction of films for wound healing 

With LbL, one can develop films with just a couple of layers or hundreds, with obvious implications in 

the films’ thickness. Thin coatings with several nanometers or membranes that may reach tens of 

micrometers can be obtained this way. When considering the production of membranes, film casting 

and hot-melt extrusion are the most recurrent used techniques [142]. However, these techniques are 

not completely compatible with biological applications: the use of organic solvents in film casting and 

the addition of plasticizers in hot-melt extrusion may cause adverse reactions when introduced in a 

biological environment. Since LbL-based strategies disregard the use of such agents, thick multilayer 

films appropriate for biological applications can be constructed. 

2.5.1.1 Development of nanostructured substrate-free membranes 

Multilayers adhere strongly to the underlying substrate and usually cannot be harvested without risk of 

damaging the film. Thus, many strategies were developed to produce films that could be detached, 

which are usually referred to as free-standing films. These free-standing films resemble membranes but, 

unlike conventional membranes, they are nanostructured and exhibit nanoscale precision thanks to 

their organization in layers. Such a device offers all the advantages of multilayered coatings and is 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

55 

useful for applications such as wound healing and drug delivery, with the added benefit of manual 

handling [143-145]. 

A typical approach to fabricate free-standings is through the use of sacrificial layers or substrates that 

can be dissolved after the buildup [42,146,147]. Ott et al. [147] used silicon wafers precoated with PEI 

to assemble chemically polymerized polyanions bearing aldehyde groups and polycations with 

4-methylpyridinium moieties. After crosslinking, the film could be detached easily from the substrate by 

salty solutions. The salt weakened the PEI interactions with the silicon wafers, after which robust free-

standing films could be harvested. 

Using salty solutions is preferable to chemical solvents, since the latter may cause both chemical and 

physical changes to the film during this stage. However, even salt may interfere in the internal 

structures of the multilayers [68,148,149]. Consequently, other strategies have been introduced as 

alternatives to the solvent-assisted detachment of multilayer films more recently. Larkin et al. [145] 

used planar substrates of Teflon and polypropylene to assemble polymeric free-standing films. 

Polymeric constituents and these substrates form weak van der Waals interactions, which make it 

possible to peel the films safely without risk of damage. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated for 50 

bilayers of CHI/HA, crosslinked by glutaraldehyde to increase their stability in aqueous solutions. A 

unique feature of these detachable free-standing films was their optical transparency. The transmission 

of light is critical for microscopy observations and makes them suitable to be used as cell culture 

substrates. Indeed, in that work fibroblasts were seeded and could be observed under light microscopy. 

Caridade et al. [150] recently developed CHI and ALG free-standing films assembled on distinct low 

surface energy substrates. In comparison to the work of Larkin et al. [145] no crosslinking was made. 

Instead, 100 bilayers were assembled (around 35 ?m). They also exploited the possibility to produce 

free-standing films exhibiting asymmetrical properties, that is, distinct properties in each face of the 

membrane. After the assembly was concluded, one side of the membrane was effectively made of ALG 

and the other of CHI. This property is useful if one envisages having two distinct properties in distinct 

faces of the same membrane. In this regard, the in vitro adhesion of myoblasts showed that cells 

adhered more to the ALG face (200 cells?mm
-2

) than to the CHI face (40 cells?mm
-2

), showing how the 

simple selection of the starting and ending constituents can significantly influence the biological 

performance of free-standing films.

2.5.1.2 Healing of tissue defects in vivo 

Free-standings may also result from hybrid approaches using LbL together with other techniques. Not 

only that, they can be associated with an additional substrate that helps in the posterior application of 

the membrane to a wound. In this sense, free-standings may serve as protective coating for wounds, 

requiring ultimately that a film is harvested and used independently of the substrate. 

The group of Takeoka and coworkers has developed a LbL-assisted strategy involving spin-coating and 

casting for the purpose of healing wounds in animals. One of their first works reported the use of a 

“spin-coating”-assisted-LbL subsequently followed by casting [151]. Shortly, CHI and ALG were 

sequentially adsorbed onto spinning silica substrates to obtain a film 75 nm thick. Poly(vinyl alcohol) 

(PVA) was cast over the bilayered films and left at room temperature during a cure time of 12 hours. 

Together with this PVA layer, with a thickness around 70 ?m, the CHI/ALG film could be easily peeled 

from the silica substrates, making it easier to carry and place over a tissue defect (Figure 2.4a).

The authors performed a minimally invasive procedure to repair a visceral pleural defect in beagle dogs: 

the PVA/(CHI/ALG)n complex was placed in contact with the defect. Next PVA was dissolved using non-

aggressive aqueous solvents, such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Over a period of 24 hours after 

the defect repair, this thin membrane resisted the pressure of respiration and blood circulation, and 

was able to sustain the stress due to ventilation (Figure 2.4b). Problems such as the reduction in the 

pulmonary tissue volume due to suture, and pulmonary air leakage could benefit from the use of 

multilayer thin films as protective membranes and sealants [152].  Later, this hybrid LbL technique and 

ingredient formulation was used to develop tetracycline-loaded films with antimicrobial effects in a 

murine cecal punctured model (Figure 2.4c) [153] and nanosheets as a protective membrane for full-

thickness burn-wound infection in a murine model (Figure 2.4d) [154]. Their production differed slightly 

from the first proposed strategy, in the fact that tetracycline was cast in the opposite face to that of the 

PVA, followed by a spin-coated layer of poly(vinyl acetate) and dissolution of PVA. 

These two last examples are particularly important for the translation of such approach to humans. 

Burn injuries are perhaps one of the most common skin defects. Such an injury creates a large skin 

area which is susceptible to bacterial colonization, leading ultimately to infections, systemic sepsis, 

severe septicemia and, if left untreated, death [155,156]. Full-thickness burn wounds may require 

tissue grafting [157]; thus it is important to have an effective protective barrier that protects the wound 

until grafting is carried out. The necessity for bacterial protection takes greater proportions when 

considering gastro-intestinal lesions, where the presence of multiple microorganisms may lead to 

bacterial peritonitis [158]. The presented examples were able to circumvent such problems and have 

great potential for future wound treatments in human patients. 

Although the technology of LbL membranes has the potential to act as wound healing dressings, there 

has been little research on LbL coatings in vivo. Based on the existing animal tests with hybrid “spin 

coating-LbL-casting” technology and on the robustness of films made purely with LbL, its broad 

application may be a matter of time. Additionally, this evolution may benefit from the use of biomimetic 

approaches and natural sources of adhesive ingredients (as mentioned in Section 2.3.1) for dressings 

with improved mechanical and biological performances. 

2.5.2 Multilayer coatings for enhanced cell adhesion on flat surfaces 

The surface of an implant is the first contact with the biological environment, and its modification – if 

any – will dictate the extent of its integration and long-term stability. Modifying surfaces is not limited to 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

58 

devices currently used in surgical practice but also to more sophisticated ones for tissue engineering 

and regenerative medicine. 

The versatility of LbL can help achieving better cellular attachment by tuning a variety of factors. One of 

those is the stiffness of the multilayer film. It was demonstrated by Schneider et al. [159] how films of 

PLL and HA were assembled and crosslinked with increasing concentrations of a water-soluble 

carbodiimide. Higher concentrations of carbodiimide allowed achieving higher crosslinking degrees and, 

consequently, higher elastic moduli, as well as higher surface roughness. The cellular adhesion was 

affected by the stiffness: human chondrosarcoma cells adhered and spread preferentially in stiffer films. 

Using the same mechanism, Phelps et al. [160] assembled films of PLL and polyglycolic acid (PGA) and 

selectively crosslinked it by exposing only the outermost layers to carbodiimide. This interface was 

turned into a rigid external skin that promoted the adhesion of pre-osteoblast cells, while leaving the 

interior of the film unaffected. Although unexplored, this structure could be useful to encapsulate an 

active agent within. Because the crosslinking is selective and not fully uniform, the deactivation of 

embedded bioactive species due to crosslinking may be avoided. 

Martins et al. [161] used CHI/ALG films crosslinked with glutaraldehyde, to study the adhesion and 

proliferation of osteoblast- and fibroblast-cell lines during 1 week. In the first case, the cells proliferated 

in a rate similar to cells seeded onto CHI-ending films, but appeared as more elongated and with a 

higher metabolic activity. In the case of fibroblast-like cells, the proliferation was inhibited in crosslinked 

films. The results of these authors show that films with higher stiffness are not always clearly beneficial 

to cells and that different cell types may behave differently when contacting with different substrates. In 

fact, the authors justified that the reduction of positive charges due to CHI crosslinking affected both the 

attachment and adhesion of this cell line – L929 human fibroblast-like cells – which are known to favor 

their adhesion. 

The addition of bioactive compounds is another form of tuning the adhesion and metabolism of cells in 

a surface. Lee and Kotov [162] incorporated delta-like 1 Notch ligands (DL-1) at the surface of PEM 

films. The Notch ligands stimulated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to differentiate into T-cell 

lymphocytes and progressively develop their own ECM. Gribova et al. [31] developed PLL/PGA films to 

study the effect of the stiffness and the exhibition of RGD-modified PGA on muscle cell differentiation. It 

was shown that uncrosslinked films exhibiting RGD were the most appropriate to induce the 

differentiation of myoblasts, while crosslinked films – with and without RGD – inhibited it and exhibited 

an excessive cell confluence that led to detachment. 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

59 

Aiming to use multilayer coatings in living organisms, Picart et al. [163] tested the performance of 

CHI/HA coatings – either crosslinked with a carbodiimide or uncrosslinked – in vitro and in vivo. By 

using a QCM and fluorimetry, degradation of the films in situ was followed upon their contact with an 

enzyme solution containing lysozyme, chitosanase and hyaluronidase. The in vivo degradation was 

studied by implanting both types of films in mouse peritoneal cavity for 1 week. In both cases, 

crosslinked films were more resistant to degradation in comparison to native films, which showed 

almost complete degradation by the end of the studies. 

The use of LbL-based substrates for cell expansion is an ever-evolving field. In contrast to the case of 

implantable devices, which consist on the improvement of already existing devices, the reviewed works 

pushed forward toward new ways of improving cell adhesion. Most of the times it involved the 

development of new types of substrates, such as the example of ligand-functionalized surfaces. It is 

debatable whether the modification of 2D surfaces using LbL is a solution or an alternative to already 

existing approaches. For the simple purpose of cell adhesion, conventional techniques such as grafting 

or plasma can achieve the same result, usually with much faster processing times. As will be debated 

in Section 2.6.1, the future innovations brought by LbL may lie in the coating of substrates with 

increasingly complex geometry and the addition of bioactive or smart constituents that may further 

extend the functionality of 3D multilayer cell substrates. 

2.5.3 Multilayer reservoirs for drug loading and delivery 

The technological advances in drug delivery have been driven by the need to develop systems that can 

effectively encapsulate, protect and deliver an active agent with specific kinetics, such as micelles, 

liposomes, polymersomes, and polymer particles/capsules [164-168]. Such wide availability of delivery 

systems – not to mention the quantity of drugs available in the market – are proof enough that there is 

need to develop drug delivery strategies capable of improving the efficacy and bioavailability of bioactive 

agents. 

2.5.3.1 Films loaded with active agents 

Picart and coworkers have performed several works consisting on the assembly of PEMs loaded with 

BMPs. First, PLL/HA films crosslinked with carbodiimide were doped with rhBMP-2 after 

construction [169]. Myoblast cells were seeded on these films and showed differentiation into 

osteoblasts, as evidenced by the increasing secretion of ALP. Consecutive in vitro cultures showed that 

rhBMP-2 retained its bioactivity for the length of 3 successive experiments. Recent works using the 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

60 

same formulation assembled onto tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (TCP/HAP) macroporous 

granules [170] and titanium [171] demonstrated the osteoinductive character of the BMP-loaded 

multilayers in a rat ectopic model. Furthermore, these coatings could be stored up to 1 year without 

significant loss of bioactivity. By studying the secondary structure of rhBMP-2, Gilde et al. [172] showed 

that this growth factor retained its bioactivity when the films were stored in the hydrated and, to a lesser 

extent, in the dry state. 

Hammond and coworkers also developed a series of multilayer formulations for the loading and release 

of various growth factors. They constructed a multilayer composition of polycationic poly(?-amino-

esters) and noncytotoxic polyanions – heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate – intercalated with 

fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2, negatively charged below pH 9.6) [173]. Assembling more layers 

equaled to more FGF-2 loaded and also a faster release. The bioactivity of the growth factor was 

retained, as revealed by in vitro biological assays. Using films built with distinct constituents, the 

released FGF-2 promoted the proliferation of a preosteoblastic cell line up to 12 days in culture. Loading 

multiple growth factors is a strategy that may help, for instance, to accelerate joint implant integration 

and reduce recovery time and failure rates by delivering active agents that intervene in the multiple 

biological events. In another report [174], multiple growth factors – rhBMP2 and a recombinant human 

vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) – were loaded by adsorption into multilayers assembled in 

macroporous polycaprolactone/?-tricalcium phosphate. The release of rhBMP-2 was sustained over a 

period of 2 weeks, while it took 8 days for rhVEGF to elute from the films. Using a rat ectopic bone 

model, films loaded with both growth factors were able to potentiate the formation of de novo bone, to 

an extent 33% higher than films loaded solely with rhBMP-2 was introduced.  

2.5.3.2 Polyelectrolyte capsules with tunable permeability 

From all the 3D shapes that can be coated with LbL, the simplest is the sphere. When coated, spherical 

multilayer shells surround particles that can often be dissolved to produce hollow capsules. Multilayer 

capsules present several advantages that are not coupled so often in other conventional fabrication 

techniques: (i) they can be prepared under mild conditions of pH and temperature, avoiding the 

denaturation of sensitive species and thus allowing encapsulation in high quantities [175]; (ii) a wide 

variety of drugs can be encapsulated, regardless of their water solubility [176]; (iii) they allow tuning the 

release kinetics of an encapsulated agent to the external environment simply by adding a variable 

number of layers and selecting the shell constituents [177]; and (iv) specialized functions can be 

attributed by using stimuli-responsive or biofunctional materials with relevant biological interest [178].

Combining distinct ingredients in the coating provide different properties to the shell, such as controlled 

permeability and, if smart materials are included, stimuli-responsive behavior. Costa et al. [179] 

constructed microcapsules of CHI/ELR bilayers adsorbed onto inorganic calcium carbonate sacrificial 

microparticles (around 5 µm in diameter) preloaded with BSA (Figure 2.5a).

After the assembly, the template was dissolved by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), resulting in 

a hollow multilayer microcapsule encapsulating BSA. The inclusion of such a temperature responsive 

polypeptide was expected to provide smart-responsiveness, and so, by changing the temperature 

between 25 and 37ºC, the mean diameter of the microcapsules varied between 5.5 and 3.2 µm, 

respectively (Figure 2.5b and Figure 2.5c). The release of BSA was also affected by temperature: the 

release of this protein was more sustained in the latter case due to the temperature response of the 

ELRs, which in the case resulted in a permeability decrease of the multilayer shells. The influence of the 

number of layers was also studied. As expected, having more layers resulted in an added barrier to the 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

62 

protein diffusion, that is, a high number of layers reduced the shell permeability (Figure 2.5d and Figure 

2.5e). 

Kainourgios et al. [180] developed PSS/PDADMAC multilayer shells using silica nanoparticles (around 

500 nm in diameter) as templates. Following the dissolution of the template by ammonium fluoride and 

hydrofluoric acid, hollow spheres were obtained. After chelation, two additional layers (PAA and 

methoxy-polyethylene glycol amine) were deposited on their surface and crosslinked. Daunorubicin was 

loaded and released at distinct pHs, showing a high quantity release at acidic pH values (pH=4, around 

70%) in comparison to pH 7.4 (around 15%). The reduced release at pH 7.4 was attributed to the 

electrostatic interactions between the sulfonate group of the PSS – which is negatively charged at this 

pH value – and the amino group of the daunosamine sugar of daunorubicin, which is positively charged. 

The cytotoxicity of these structures towards breast cancer cells was dose-dependent and higher for 

increasing daunorubicin content. 

Recently, Shen et al. [181] fabricated BSA-gel capsules via a two-step procedure. First, calcium 

carbonate microparticles entrapping BSA were coated with PAH/PSS bilayers, followed by removal of 

the sacrificial core. Afterwards, a heat treatment at 80ºC converted BSA into gel. By exploiting the 

isoelectric point of BSA (pI=4.8), loading and releasing doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug could be 

tuned. At a pH higher than 4.8, the negatively charged BSA allowed a favorable loading of the 

polycationic DOX and its release upon lowering the pH below 4.8. Thus, rather than exploiting the 

permeability of the LbL shell to load and release bioactive agents, as described by Kainourgios and 

coworkers [180], they relied on the jellified interior to retain DOX. Melanoma models were created in 

the lungs of mice and after injection of DOX-loaded BSA-gel capsules they were more effective in the 

reduction of the number of melanoma metastatic nodules than injected free DOX. 

Ingredients other than polymers can be used to render capsules stimuli-responsive. For instance, 

Liu et al. [182] used an emulsification method to produce magnetic alginate microspheres with around 

600 nm in diameter and coated them with PAH/PSS multilayer coatings. After the assembly, the 

emulsified alginate was liquefied by EDTA but remained entrapped within the coatings, along with the 

iron oxide nanoparticles. DOX (cationic) was post-loaded by diffusion from concentrated solutions to the 

interior and was immobilized by electrostatic interaction with alginate (anionic), with an entrapment 

efficiency of about 56%. Applying a high-frequency magnetic field resulted in an increase of the internal 

temperature, resulting in an increase in shell permeability and DOX release with higher kinetics. 

Furthermore, increasing times of exposure to the magnetic field resulted in increased released 

quantities.

2.5.3.3 Capsules for the intracellular delivery of encapsulated agents 

Multilayer microcapsules have been demonstrated to be suitable carriers for drugs and to deliver them 

either by conventional mechanisms of diffusion to the surrounding environment or by delivering them 

directly to the intracellular environment. The latter possibility is particularly interesting. In theory, the 

delivery of an active agent directly to the cells ensures that higher drug quantities will be available at the 

targeted cell or tissue. Szarpak et al. [168] constructed microcapsules using HA and either PAH or PLL. 

The microcapsules were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and co-incubated for 2 hours 

with mouse macrophages, being both types internalized, deformed, and excreted by lysosomes. Caruso 

and coworkers [167] reported that the shape of the capsules influences the internalization rate: 

spherical capsules were more prone to undergo cellular uptake by human cervical cancer cells than 

cylindrical ones. 

Parak and coworkers [183] demonstrated the internalization of degradable dextran sulfate/poly(L-

arginine) and non-degradable PSS/PAH by embryonic fibroblasts for a period of 5 days. The 

intracellular degradability of each capsule type could be followed thanks to the encapsulation of a 

fluorescent compound, DQ-ovalbumin. Due to a characteristic self-quenching mechanism, this 

compound exhibits a red fluorescence characterized by the close proximity of the fluorescent dyes, but 

it shifts to a bright green upon proteolysis. After a culture time of up to 5 days, the biodegradable 

capsules exhibited a green fluorescence, while the PSS/PAH capsules were in their majority red (Figure 

2.6). This results showed that, although both types of microcapsules could be delivered to cells, the 

availability of DQ-ovalbumin was higher when encapsulated within dextran sulfate/poly(L-arginine) 

microcapsules. 

The results from Parak and coworkers suggest that it is not enough to ensure that a drug is delivered to 

cells: after delivery, the encapsulated agent needs to be available to the cellular machinery. Moreover, 

with this strategy the release of the drug is mediated by the degradation of the capsule inside the cell, 

making external control over this process not possible. In this regard, Palankar et al. [184] devised a 

strategy to release an encapsulated agent on demand upon cellular uptake using infrared light. A 

peptide ligand of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules was encapsulated 

within PDADMAC/PSS microcapsules (around 2 ?m in diameter) doped with gold nanoparticles.

Upon internalization by monkey kidney epithelial cells and chinese hamster ovary cells, an infrared 

laser was irradiated over cells individually. This caused the disruption of the microcapsules’ walls due to 

heating release by the gold nanoparticles and consequently the release of the encapsulated peptide. 

Moreover, contrary to what occurs with UV light, infrared light did not result in any adverse 

consequence to the cells. With this strategy, bioactive agents may be encapsulated in nondegradable 

microcapsules that protect them until their release is desired and triggered on demand. 

The stability and biodistribution of electrostatic self-assembled nanoparticles for systemic administration 

and off-body tracing was recently addressed by Poon et al. [185] by imaging techniques. They 

evidenced the importance of a larger number of layers and the role of the terminating layer in terms of 

functional retention. A formulation of PLL and dextran films capped with a final layer of HA assembled 

onto gold nanoparticles or quantum dots showed a blood elimination half-life of 9 hours and low liver 

accumulation could be observed in mice. 

A lot of effort has been done in the context of drug delivery devices made with LbL. This approach has 

potential for the construction of nano- and micro-carriers that provide tunable release by varying not 

only the number of layers but also external parameters, such as temperature and pH. It is even possible 

to exploit mechanisms of delivery directly to the intracellular environment. Judging by the reviewed 

works, multilayer microcapsules can be inherently uptaken by cells without requiring specific

functionalization wit bioactive materials. However, the intracellular degradation kinetics should be taken 

into account since capsules made of nondegradable materials may limit the bioavailability of the 

encapsulated agents. Much research has been carried out using DOX as a model drug. These reports 

represent a step forward the usage of LbL systems in actual in vivo applications, such as in cancer 

treatments, and their low or even absent negative impact in a living organism. Given the extensive 

knowledge of such systems using chemotherapeutics to target cancerous cells, it is likely that cancer 

treatments will be the most studied application using this class of carriers in the short term. 

2.5.4 Biosensors 

Biosensors are analytical devices that incorporate biological sensing elements. Screening metabolites 

present in biological fluids and in the human body is of growing importance for medical analysis, rapid 

disease diagnosis and drug discovery [186-188]. This concept has been transcribed to the LbL 

technology, mainly in the form of capsules, where metabolite-sensitive fluorophores are immobilized 

inside a carrier, resulting in a measurable response upon contact with a specific biological agent. Parak 

and coworkers [189] developed microcapsules delimited by PSS/PAH multilayers and magnetite 

nanoparticles that encapsulated seminaphtho-rhodafluor-1-dye (SNARF-1)-dextran conjugate as mobile 

pH sensors. The purpose of using magnetite particles was to enable a magnetic separation of capsules 

during their construction. SNARF-1 exhibits a pH-responsive fluorophore that emits green fluorescence 

under acidic conditions and red under alkaline ones. Using this combination, they exploited the 

mechanism of cellular intracellular uptake by fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. First, due to the 

alkaline properties of the culture medium, the microcapsules exhibited red fluorescence. After 30 

minutes of incubation, capsules internalized by lysosomal/endosomal compartments turned from red to 

green, due to the acidic pH found inside the intracellular environment. The cells retained their viability 

and capacity to divide and proliferate. Although two types of cells were used to study this biosensor, 

there seemed to be no difference in the fluorescence response observed upon cellular uptake. In the 

future, it could be interesting to have a biosensor of this class capable of measuring physiological 

parameters in distinct types of cells with clear distinct signals. 

This simple formulation is one of the pioneer works of LbL microcapsules that act as biosensors, 

namely toward physical physiological parameters like pH. However, different approaches may allow 

identifying other parameters such as biochemical signals. Pan, Zhang and Li [190] presented films 

made of single-walled carbon nanotubes and CHI-dispersed tin disulfide nanoparticles assembled onto 

glassy carbon electrodes by electrostatic interactions. While bare electrodes did not provide a clear 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

66 

distinct electrochemical signal for individual compounds – dopamine hydrochloride and uric acid, in the 

presence of ascorbic acid – the multilayer coating enabled the identification of clear separate 

electrochemical voltammetric signals. Thus, the assembly of the coating allowed identifying 

simultaneously two distinct compounds. This strategy could be useful for the fabrication of tailored 

electrodes in a rapid and simple way that allow detecting and quantifying multiple specific metabolites 

present in biological fluids. 

Yu et al. [191] presented gold substrates coated with multiple dendritic stars of opposite charge 

finished with an ending layer containing negatively charged carboxyl groups. These groups could be 

functionalized with by carbodiimide and N - hydroxysuccinimide which allowed binding covalently 

fluorophore-amino-modified single stranded DNA via amidation. Using this strategy, it was possible to 

distinguish and quantify DNA hybridization behaviors between one mismatch and complementary target 

DNA molecules, showing that such devices could be interesting DNA biosensor platforms. 

Another approach is the use of reservoirs made by LbL that encapsulate sensing molecules. One such 

example is the encapsulation of enzymes as sensing molecules. Enzymes are versatile biocatalysts 

which have a wide range of important catalytic and sensing applications [192]. Kazakova et al. [186] 

presented PSS/PAH microcapsules that acted as multilayer biosensors and as reservoirs of (i) glucose 

oxidase, (ii) lactate oxidase or (iii) both enzymes. PSS was labeled with tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-

phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) dichloride complex (Ru(dpp)) –  a well-known dye used in luminescence-

based oxygen sensors – and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) – a non-fluorescent molecule that yields 

rhodamine123 which, in the presence of peroxidase, emits green fluorescence upon oxidation by 

hydrogen peroxide. Oxygen-, glucose- and lactate-dependent spectrofluorimetric assays dependent on 

concentration were conducted, showing reliable detection at the millimolar range in all cases. 

The problem with enzymes is that they lack long-term stability and limited reusability for biosensing 

purposes [193,194]. We described before how Parak and coworkers [189] introduced magnetite to 

allow separation and harvesting during microcapsule production, but this concept could be used to 

retrieve and reuse enzyme-encapsulating devices until the enzymatic content is depleted. 

Garcia et al. [192] presented a thorough study in which they developed BSA-functionalized magnetic 

nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with biotin- and avidin-modified horseradish peroxidase (HRP) layers 

(Figure 2.7a and Figure 2.7b). The enzymatic activity of peroxidase adsorbed as a single layer was 

compared to that of peroxidase in solution, revealing that the enzymatic activity was similar in both 

cases. However, peroxidase activity increased linearly with the number of layers, exhibiting a four-fold 

total activity upon the assembly of 5 layers in respect to the solution control (Figure 2.7c).

deprotonated form – due to the decrease of pH from the formation of gluconic acid. Adapted with

These results suggest that LbL-immobilized enzymatic molecules do not block any active site in the 

enzyme, since the enzymatic activity increased with the number of layers, and is therefore adequate for 

biosensing activities. The authors studied this system further. They showed that these biosensors could 

be retrieved by magnetic-assisted harvesting and reused up to 10 consecutive cycles without loss of 

enzymatic activity. Then, this system was turned into a bi-enzymatic system by the incorporation of 

biotin-activated glucose oxidase (GOX) as the ending layer. Two enzymatic reactions could then be 

exploited for the detection of glucose. Shortly, the degradation of glucose by GOX results in gluconic

acid and hydrogen peroxide, which is a colorless reaction (Figure 2.7d). In the presence of peroxidase, 

Amplex red reacted with hydrogen peroxide producing resorufin, a pink-colored product observable in 

the visible spectrum. Increasing concentrations of glucose could be detected and measurable by the 

increasing absorbance of pink in the retrieved samples (Figure 2.7e). This work presents potential for 

applications concerning the detection of glucose, namely to diagnose and follow diabetes, which 

account for approximately 85% of the world market for biosensors [187]. 

 

The use of colorimetric biosensors is particularly interesting. A patient could use it for rapid screening 

purposes conveniently at home without any specific operation training. Colorimetric changes could 

provide a quick indication of whether a person suffers from a specific disease. In a recent highlight from 

McShane and Ritter [195] the potential of colorimetric biosensors was discussed. With the advent of 

portable devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs, it would be possible to install multiple 

diagnostic software tools that permitted to identify and rate a response from a biosensor based on 

colorimetric scales. Smart tattoos – color changing particles intended for a minimally invasive dermal 

implantation – could react to the metabolites present in the interstitial fluids, resulting in measurable 

shifts of their optical properties. Then, an external device could read that response, give a diagnostic 

and even send it directly to a physician. Given the potential of LbL devices for biosensing and the 

present technological advances, it is likely that this concept will grow, accompanied by a miniaturization 

of biosensors, commodity and ease of use. LbL will contribute to this evolution since this technique 

allows achieving higher levels of functionalization, customization and measurement of multiple 

metabolites at once. 

2.5.5 Implantable structural devices with tubular shape 

LbL allows coating substrates with distinct geometries to obtain devices from thin coatings to 

membranes and three-dimensional objects. Those could have adequate anatomic shapes that could be 

used to replace or regenerate tissues or organs. Particular interesting examples of such devices are 

tubular structures, which constitute another three-dimensional shape that can be obtained by LbL 

besides spheres. 

One typical approach to construct tubular structures is to coat the interior of cylindrical pores, which 

usually lead to the fabrication of tubes with low caliber, in the order of nanometers. Liang et al. [196] 

were able to conceive hybrid polyelectrolyte/nanoparticle tubes templated on the pores of 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

69 

polycarbonate membranes, each pore with around 400 nm in diameter and maximum pore length of 

10 ?m. The membrane was first functionalized with a PEI solution that acted as the primer layer and as 

support for the assembly of PAA and PAH layers. The membrane was then dissolved with 

dichloromethane, leaving intact only the coatings of the inner pores with tubular shape. To give 

mechanical stability to these structures, the tubes were crosslinking with high temperatures (160ºC) or 

in alternative they could be assembled with gold or cadmium telluride nanoparticles intercalated 

between bilayers. Their inclusion could play an essential role in providing mechanical reinforcement, 

affecting the properties of small blood vessels substitutes and the structure of cells. In both cases, 

hollow tubes could be formed with an outer diameter similar to the size of the pore and wall thickness 

ranging from about 50 to 80 nm. Yang et al. [197] studied the in vitro biological properties of CHI/ALG 

tubes with around 400 nm of diameter and estimated wall thickness of 80 nm (thickness for 16 

bilayers), fabricated using polycarbonate porous membranes. Their biodegradability in pancreatin 

carried out overnight resulted in a diameter reduction to 160 nm, attributed to the CHI degradation due 

to lipase present in pancreatic fluids. Cellular assays using human cervical cancer cells or breast cancer 

cells demonstrated their low cytotoxicity. They also carried out cellular uptake experiments with each 

cell type, showing that after 24 h the tubes could be found inside the cells. Due to the small size of 

these nanotubes, such tubular structures could be useful as drug carriers for the intracellular delivery of 

active agents. 

Another approach for construction tubular structures is by coating sacrificial templates with cylindrical 

shape to assemble multilayer coatings. Since this approach relies on the use of physical shapes, it is 

possible to develop tubes with larger calibers that could be useful as blood vessel substitutes. Mueller, 

Daehne and Fery [198] used tubular templates for the fabrication of hollow LbL tubes instead of porous 

membranes. Glass fibers ranging from 5 to 10 ?m were coated with PDADMAC and PSS, after which 

the fibers were dissolved by hydrogen fluoride. However, the authors warned for the possibility of 

pearling instability, that is, the deterioration of a liquid cylinder into a series of droplets, also known as 

the Rayleigh instability. This effect results from the tension of the wall surface provoked by a high ionic 

strength at the time of template dissolution. To solve this issue, they added an additional layer of PAH, 

which is known to withstand high concentrations of salt. Indeed, the addition of this material eliminated 

pearling instability, resulting in the formation of stable hollow tubes. The tubes were dried and shown to 

be resistant, with a Young’s modulus of around 200 MPa. Curiously, He et al. [199] took advantage of 

the pearling instability to construct tubes that transform into capsules. They used the polycarbonate 

porous membrane template to assemble PSS/PAH multilayer tubes. Then, by increasing temperature 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

70 

up to 138ºC, tube segments separated, closed and formed capsules. This interesting tubular-derived 

capsular formation strategy can be useful for other applications, such as delivery of drugs or genes and 

for the preparations of reactors or biochemical sensors [200]. 

In the work of Silva et al. [201] CHI/ALG hollow tubes were developed using glass tubes (around 1 mm) 

as templates. Glass was first coated with a thin sacrificial layer of paraffin, which served as the 

substrate to adsorb 100 bilayers. Upon assembly, the paraffin was dissolved by dichloromethane, 

resulting in hollow cylindrical structures with a caliber comparable to the template (Figure 2.8a). 

Afterwards, some tubes were crosslinked by genipin (Figure 2.8b) which provided structures with 

storage and Young’s moduli about twice the uncrosslinked tubes when immersed in PBS (Figure 2.8c), 

an important property for implantable devices. In vitro biological studies up to 7 days using a fibroblast-

like cell line demonstrated that the cells adhered preferentially to crosslinked films, showing a more 

elongated and spread morphology (Figure 2.8d) in comparison to native films.

The synthesis of hollow tubular structures has the potential to mimic the structure of blood vessels. The 

tuned permeability of the multilayered walls potentiates the control of gas and nutrient exchanges from 

and into circulating fluids. They could help in cases of coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases, 

which are still a cause of high mortality in western societies. Usually, autologous vessel grafts are the 

standard treatment when small diameter vessels are involved. However, to many patients this option is 

limited due to the lack of suitable vessels or because of a previous harvest [202,203]. Moreover, their 

large surface area makes them appealing for other applications such as catalysis, sensing or tissue 

growth supports [204-206]. 

Tubular LbL structures still remain a largely unexplored area. A possible reason for this is the difficulty 

associated with their fabrication: collapsing of the internal wall and pearling instability, which are 

phenomena not encountered for simpler structures, such as the 2D films and 3D spheres and scaffolds. 

Most of these studies also focus on the morphological, mechanical and in vitro biological 

characterization, but, to our knowledge, attempts of cellular colonization of multilayer tubes’ interior has 

yet to be attempted. Indeed, LbL tubular structures may be envisaged as blood vessels, but one must 

be aware that blood vessels – artery, vein, capillary – have different calibers, with capillaries being 

suggested to have a mean diameter of 5 ?m [207]. 

The possibility of LbL to control the constituents with each adsorbing layer may be used to mimic the 

structure of blood vessels, which is organized in three layers: intima, media and adventitia. In each 

layer, distinct percentages of collagen and elastin are found to supply the arterial wall matrix with 

strength and elasticity [203,208]. Furthermore, besides the conventional approaches of sacrificial 

templates coated with PEMs described herein, tubular multilayer structures may be produced with new 

strategies that disregard the dissolution of templates and may even incorporate natural constituents of 

blood vessels. In respect to the latter, as we will be discussed in Section 2.6.2, Akashi and coworkers 

have been exploring hybrid multilayers containing cells and ECM components to fabricate tissue 

analogues in vitro, including analogues of blood vessels. 

2.5.6 Compartmentalized environments 

With the successful extrapolation of LbL to 3D, multilayer films have started to be perceived not as 

coatings but as boundaries that delimit and confine an internal environment. One can find such analogy 

in Nature in the elegant example of cells. Cells are unique for their hierarchical and compartmentalized 

organization. Delimited by the phospholipidic membrane, the cytoplasm provides a balanced 

intracellular environment where the organelles are maintained and execute various specialized functions 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

72 

such as the transport of numerous compounds, synthesis of proteins and regulation of enzymatic 

reactions. Thus, besides compartmentalization, cells also exhibit multifunctionality thanks to the 

specialized structures confined within [209-211]. 

Although cells may seem a complex inspiration to follow, some strategies have already been proposed 

to mimic their structure using multi-shelled organic and inorganic capsules prepared by template-

assisted strategies [212-214]. However, as they are often accompanied by harsh processing conditions, 

compartmentalized assemblies of polymeric multilayer nano/microcapsules within larger partitions have 

been achieved by using non-aggressive bottom-up strategies [215], among them LbL [216,217]. In a 

simplistic structural organization, cells can be transcribed to a compartmental model, where a large 

compartment confines a liquefied environment in which subcompartments are suspended. Each 

compartment exhibits a distinct function and is delimited by its own membrane. In any case, 

multilayered or not, compartmentalization has allowed combining properties and confining reactions 

that could not be achieved simply with single-component assemblies [218]. 

2.5.6.1 Confined enzymatic reactions 

The concept of multilayered multicompartments was first demonstrated by Sukhorukov and 

coworkers [219] who developed concentric shell-in-shell nanostructured microcapsules. They used 

calcium carbonate microparticles produced by co-precipitation of calcium chloride and sodium 

carbonate, during which fluorescent-tagged human serum albumin (HSA) and magnetite nanoparticles 

were entrapped. As observed in Figure 2.9a, the microparticles were coated with PSS/PAH multilayers 

and, instead of dissolving this sacrificial template afterwards, they submitted the coated particles to a 

second coprecipitation stage. At this stage, HSA tagged with another fluorophore was also present. This 

way, a second calcium carbonate inorganic layer was assembled around the first one while entrapping 

HSA separated from the underlying core by the PSS/PAH multilayers. In this formulation, the magnetite 

was used for magnetic separation and harvesting of ball-in-ball structures. After chelation of both 

inorganic sections, fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of a shell-in-shell structure, each of 

them containing HSA tagged with the distinct fluorophores (Figure 2.9b). Following the same procedure, 

the authors used this concept to encapsulate also GOX in the outer compartment and peroxidase in the 

inner compartment. Upon the addition of glucose to the surrounding medium, the enzymatic reaction 

could be detected by the Amplex Red fluorescence in the inner compartment due to the formation of 

resorufin (Figure 2.9c). This is a similar situation to that reported previously by Garcia et al. [192] in 

single-compartment capsules, where an identical enzymatic reaction was identified by the visible optical

properties of Amplex Red, but with the added advantage of confining the whole enzymatic reaction in a 

confined and controlled environment.

Other complex structures can be obtained through similar approaches. Instead of concentric 

compartments, Tong et al. [220] produced PAH/PSS coatings around calcium carbonate microparticles 

pre-doped with polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) micelles. After chelation with EDTA, it was 

possible to observe the free micelles (around 30 nm) suspended inside the PEM microcapsules (around 

3 ?m). In contrast to Sukhorukov and coworkers [219], in this work not just one “ball” was 

encapsulated inside a larger one. Instead, several smaller containers were suspended within the larger 

multilayer compartment. They also demonstrated the loading capability of water soluble and water 

insoluble drugs. Namely, the hydrophobic triclosan was encapsulated in the micelles’ cores and the 

water soluble DOX in the microcapsule’s interior by association with the negatively charged PAA corona 

of the micelles. This strategy has clear potential for the simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic and 

hydrophilic drugs. 

Hosta-Rigau et al. [221] constructed LbL-based capsosomes – polymer capsules containing liposomal 

subcompartments – as carriers of therapeutic molecules. Silica microparticles (around 3 ?m) were 

coated with a precursor PLL layer followed by the adsorption of liposomes containing thiocoraline (TC), 

a hydrophobic antitumoral drug. Two liposome layers were assembled, each separated by a PEM of PLL 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

74 

and poly-(methacrylic acid)-co-(cholesteryl methacrylate) (PMAc) and this structure was then protected 

by adding additional polymer layers to hold the liposomes in place. In comparison to the other 

described works, this approach was developed to show compartmentalization organization at an 

interfacial level, rather than in the interior of the microcapsules. Incubation with colon cancer cells 

showed an increased anti-carcinogenic activity of capsosomes containing TC-loaded liposomes, when 

compared to capsosomes without TC. In the presence of the former, cells exhibited a reduction of 

viability as high as 43%. 

2.5.6.2 Customizable environments with multifunctional components 

Compartmental devices are useful in fields such as catalysis, sensors, multiple drug delivery, disease 

models, energy storage and microreactors,  which often require complex phenomena to occur 

simultaneously [34,222,223]. In particular, this technology permits adding materials that respond to 

external stimuli either in the composition of the coatings or in the interior of three dimensional 

structures. This opportunity opens chances for customization of compartmentalized devices rather than 

being limited to the confinement of enzymatic reactions and drug encapsulation. Costa et al. [224] used 

a hybrid ionic gelation strategy assisted by LbL to fabricate temperature and magnetic responsive 

compartmentalized capsules with hierarchical organization from the nano- to the macro scales. First, 

CHI/ELR multilayers coated calcium carbonate microparticles (3 ?m) entrapping superparamagnetic 

nanoparticles (MNPs, 10 nm). Afterwards, they were encapsulated within ALG beads (2 mm) by ionic 

gelation, which were further coated with CHI/ALG films. EDTA was then used to chelate the calcium 

carbonate that served as template for the microcapsules and liquefy the jellified ALG. The result was a 

multilayer-confined liquefied alginate environment encapsulating smaller microscopic compartments 

with both temperature and magnetic responsive materials. Each of the capsular compartments was 

loaded with rhodamine. Release studies at 25 and 37ºC showed that the rhodamine release was more 

sustained at physiological temperature (71%, in comparison to 84% at room temperature), being this 

behavior in accordance with the previous work of the same group with BSA-loaded microcapsules [179]. 

MNPs, which were confined within the microcompartments, were shown to attribute magnetic 

responsiveness towards external magnetic fields to the whole compartmentalized device, allowing their 

spatial mobilization and immobilization. One could think that a millimetric device delimited with a 

nanometric coating would be unable to withstand the stress of carrying a cargo. The authors, however, 

also showed that the millicapsules were capable of withstand centrifugal stress and handling without 

rupturing the LbL external membrane. This is a useful and convenient property, which makes it easy to 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

75 

transport and transfer these devices between different containers if necessary (e.g., well-plates, Petri 

dishes). This class of customizable hierarchical systems can be envisaged to control the release of 

several biomolecules simultaneously, their spatial immobilization in targeted therapies and the control 

over a multitude of cellular in controllable reactors. The authors studied the two stimuli in separate and 

did not explore the mixed influence of temperature and magnetic response in the release of 

encapsulated molecules. Nonetheless, it may be possible to explore their combined effect for amplified 

hyperthermia treatments such as those found in cancer treatments [225] and studying its effectiveness 

in killing cancer cells inside such a millimetric model reactor for drug discovery and screening. 

Compartmentalized systems inspired on cells are still in an early infancy but their future potential as 

drug delivery and enzymatic reactors has already been proved. The potential of such devices may allow 

for this technology to advance in terms of functionality and customization by coupling functionality that 

is not found together in Nature. In Section 2.6.3, we will show that mammalian cells may be 

encapsulated and form microtissues inside such liquefied capsules that could be explored in tissue 

engineering applications. 

2.6 Engineering tissues in vitro 

Presently, when a patient’s organ fails the only treatment available is transplantation. However, organ 

availability for transplantation is limited and in many cases the waiting leads to the patient’s death. As a 

response, tissue engineering has appeared as a multidisciplinary field that applies principles of biology, 

chemistry, physics and engineering, culminating in life and health sciences [226]. The ultimate 

objective of this field is not only to help biological structures to regenerate for themselves but also to 

produce tissues and organs in lab that could serve as functional substitutes for damaged tissues and 

organs. For that purpose, it is typical for tissue engineering strategies to combine cells, scaffolds that 

provide a three-dimensional environment and biochemical signals, such as growth factors. 

2.6.1 Three-dimensional porous structures 

LbL can be used to coat substrates with complex and convoluted geometries other than simple planar 

surfaces. Three-dimensional substrates may be coated and eventually provide a porous structure to be 

populated by cells for the development of alternative cell growth platforms for tissue engineering 

applications. This feature is particularly important when considering the development of environments 

resembling the spatial arrangement of cells in native tissues and organs as much as possible. 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

76 

It is possible to construct convoluted three-dimensional structures made exclusively with LbL 

constituents with porosity for cell seeding. For example, Sher, Custódio and Mano [227] developed 

porous scaffolds using leachable PEI-functionalized paraffin wax particles as template. Aggregates of 

paraffin wax particles were packed together and coated with CHI/ALG films using a perfusion-assisted 

LbL strategy. Afterwards, the particles were dissolved by dichloromethane, leaving only the PEM 

structure with porosity and interconnectivity. They served as substrates to seed human osteoblast-like 

cells, which adhered and proliferated within 7 days. Following an identical approach to produce 

scaffolds, Silva et al. [228] developed 3D structures of CHI and chondroitin sulfate multilayers for 

bovine chondrocytes and multipotent bone marrow derived stromal cells. Both types of cells were able 

to proliferate significantly and retain their viability for as long as 35 days. Histology on scaffolds seeded 

with bovine chondrocytes showed that the number of cells per section increased with the time of culture 

and started to show a more homogeneous dispersion after 14 days of culture. Lacunae formation was 

also observed in the matrix surrounding these cells, indicating the maintenance of the chondrogenic 

phenotype. Similar results were obtained for scaffolds seeded with the stromal cells, accompanied by 

the deposition of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs), an indicator of chondrogenic differentiation. 

Instead of a 3D template, it is possible to modify pre-existing structures with LbL to improve the 

biological performance upon contact with the cells. Ye et al. [229]  used a decellularized porcine aortic 

valve that acted as support for heparin and CHI multilayers (Figure 2.10a). In comparison to uncoated 

matrices, they exhibited lower platelet adhesion and activation, lower adhesion of leukocytes and 

significantly higher whole-blood clotting time (Figure 2.10b and Figure 2.10c). Human blood derived 

endothelial progenitor cells were seeded into the coated matrix for 5 days and showed almost full 

coverage of the available surface with a well-spread morphology and maintenance of the endothelial 

phenotype (Figure 2.10d). Therefore, a matrix with anti-thrombotic properties and good repopulation 

capability by endothelial cells was obtained and it constitutes a viable alternative to current valve 

transplantation alternatives.

The internal structure of a porous scaffold can also be modified using LbL to create new hierarchical 

microstructures. Oliveira et al. [230] presented a strategy in which the formation of fibrillar structures is 

was induced across the pores’ walls of diamine-modified poly(?-caprolactone) scaffolds. Using a 

custom-made dipping robot, the pores were coated with ALG/CHI multilayers from solutions with 

different concentrations (0.5–5 mg?mL
-1

) and rinsing times (5–40 minutes). After the assembly, the 

scaffolds were frozen at -80ºC, which led to the formation of ice crystals that caused localized 

compression, shear and stretching on the assembled layers. Consequently, the coating would 

experience displacement from the walls toward the center of the pores, resulting in fibrillar structures of 

ALG/CHI multilayers. High rinsing times inhibited the formation of such structures: a lengthy washing 

step did not allow excess polyelectrolyte solution to remain inside the pores which would lead to the 

formation of complexes and fibrillar structures. Moreover, the use of the most concentrated solutions 

led to an increase in the formation fibrillar structures and more uniformly spread than with more diluted

78 

solutions. With these structures, it could be possible to increase the surface available area for cell 

growth. In fact, using osteoblast-like cells, they demonstrated that cells adhered and proliferated 

preferentially in scaffolds containing fibrils that resulted from shorter rinsing times and concentrated 

polyelectrolyte solutions. 

2.6.2 Cells as components in the LbL construction 

Akashi and coworkers have followed an elegant LbL-based approach to develop hybrid polymeric and 

cellular constructs capable of providing a three-dimensional environment and simulate the hierarchical 

organization of tissues. In an early report [231], they started by seeding a monolayer of fibroblasts on a 

fibronectin-functionalized cover glass, followed by the adsorption of seven fibronectin and GEL bilayers. 

Fibronectin is a well-known ECM glycoprotein related to the adhesion, migration and differentiation of 

cells. They are also known to interact with materials of the collagen class, like GEL, which was exploited 

to drive the LbL assembly between these two materials. The preparation of this multilayer was expected 

to provide an interface similar to the natural ECM to seed a second layer of cells. Following this pattern, 

they were able to construct 4 cell layers intercalated by fibronectin/GEL bilayers with controlled 

thickness (around 6 nm). More recently, using a similar multilayer construct, they intercalated human 

primary dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vascular endothelial cells to evaluate their stability and 

function, including after a heat shock of 45ºC [232]. They observed that the layered structure provided 

a protective and biologically suitable environment for the cells in comparison to the ones seeded in 

culture dishes. Using a similar approach, Kim and Rajagopalan [233] focused on hepatic-related 

applications by seeding a rat hepatocyte monolayer over a collagen gel-coated substrate, followed by a 

coating of CHI/HA multilayers. Afterwards, a layer of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (rLSECs) was 

added. The CHI/HA served as an analogue of the Space of Disse, a separator between the endothelium 

and the epithelium which helps in the diffusion of nutrients to the hepatocytes. Its role helps 

maintaining the hepatic functions of the liver cells and their differentiation state. It was expected that 

such construct would provide hepatocytes with a hepatic three-dimensional adequate environment that 

would prevent their dedifferentiation. Thus, in comparison to a cultured monolayer of rLSECs, rLSEC-

PEM-hepatocyte cultures maintained their differentiated state over 12 days, whereas in the former case, 

rLSECs lost their phenotype within 3 days. 

The use of ECM components and cells opens the way for LbL to be used in the fabrication of tissues in 

vitro by allowing cells to be stratified in a 3D environment. Akashi and coworkers have been very active 

in the development of devices that could help achieve such a three-dimensional cell organization for 



Chapter 2. Polyelectrolyte multilayered assemblies in biomedical technologies 

 

79 

transplantable constructs or angiogenesis models. Recently [234], they presented layered 

polyelectrolyte/cell structures as blood vessel analogues. To achieve this purpose, hydrogels of ?-PGA 

containing spatially arranged silica tubes (up to 620 ?m in diameter) were used. The tubes were 

removed afterwards, thereby resulting in a gel containing uniaxial pores with inner diameter of around 

700 ?m. Fibronectin/GEL films were then assembled by perfusion, followed by a suspension of human 

umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, another polymeric film, and finally human umbilical vein 

endothelial cells. With these two types of cells, the typical composition of blood capillaries and the 

intima and media layers – containing endothelial and smooth muscle cells, respectively – could be 

mimicked. The permeability of this capillary analog was assessed by following the perfusion of BSA 

from the capillary lumen to the hydrogel template. The coating of the microchannels was able to act as 

a barrier to the diffusion of this high molecular weight protein (around 66 kDa) with a diffusion rate 

constant about 7 times inferior to uncoated microchannels. In contrast with the conventional approach 

of tubular constructs involving sacrificial templates, this work did not take such an approach. Instead, 

they demonstrated that LbL can be used to construct blood vessel analogues within three-dimensional 

porous hydrogel networks. This way, it may be possible to develop a three-dimensional device with 

enhanced perfusion of nutrients, oxygen and also delivery of bioactive molecules to cells confined within 

the gel. 

Another strategy to construct 3D multilayer structures consists in the rapid cell-accumulation technique. 

This approach consists in the assembly of ECM components directly at the surface of cells and the 

consequent cell self-organization into layers. For this purpose, Akashi and coworkers [235] assembled 

fibronectin and GEL layers (with an estimated total thickness of 6 nm) onto the membrane of various 

types of cells (Figure 2.11a). Coated mouse fibroblast cells were able to organize themselves into 8 

dense and homogeneous layers (around 35 ?m), in comparison to a tattered and porous structure 

obtained using noncoated cells. The authors justified that since fibronectin/GEL films assembled on 

individual cell surfaces provide an interactive property with the ?5?1 integrin receptor of the cell 

membrane, the cell-cell adhesion of all seeded cells in three-dimensions can be induced at the same 

time. Their study proceeded with an attempt to produce 3D cell structures with in which endothelial 

tube networks could be formed. The cell accumulation technique allows “sandwich” structures 

containing different cell types to be made. A cellular construct consisting of 8 layers of human dermal 

fibroblast cells divided by 1 intermediate layer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was 

constructed in a controlled manner by adjusting the number of cells that were incubated simultaneously 

(Figure 2.11b). After 7 days of incubation, a highly-developed capillary networks and a tubular

The presented examples show that LbL has made a step toward the engineering of tissues in vitro by 

mimicking the ECM composition and 3D organization of tissues, effectively creating tissue analogues 

such as blood vessels and liver. This technology may be adapted to produce analogues for other kinds 

of tissues with interest in tissue engineering, such as the pancreas and heart. 

2.6.3 Production of microtissues in confined environments 

In tissue engineering, the use of alginate as templates for the fabrication of millimetric capsules permits 

the incorporation of cells for the formation of microtissues, drug discovery, and to conduct fundamental 

studies using complex cellular microenvironments. Mano and coworkers used liquefied ALG 

environments delimited by coatings made of CHI, ALG and PLL for cell encapsulation

purposes.[236,237] The encapsulation of fibroblasts was achieved by suspending them in the ALG 

solution prior to ionic gelation (Figure 2.12).

The subsequent ionic gelation of alginate in calcium chloride solution was not harmful for the cells, 

making it an appropriate technique for cell encapsulation. However, it is known that often cells require 

anchorage points that allow them to attach, spread and proliferate, otherwise risking cellular 

death [238]. To increase available surface area inside the capsules, plasma-functionalized poly(L-lactic

acid) (PLLA) microparticles were co-encapsulated in the ALG medium along with fibroblasts, which 

ensured that cells survived up to 28 days. In principle, such devices could be adapted to include more 

complex features such as microparticles, they could be able to deliver bioactive agents inside the 

capsules or the combination of multiple cellular populations. 

2.7 Conclusions 

The multitude of multilayer devices developed so far show how LbL-based strategies have surpassed 

the simple purpose of modifying surfaces. It is clear that LbL permits achieving high degrees of 

functionalization and complexity, both in bioactivity and geometry, for various biomedical applications. 

We summarized the factors that influence the construction of PEMs, with pH and ionic strength being 

the factors most often manipulated to improve the assembly output. Also, we described the efforts 

made to minimize the lengthy construction times that are necessary to obtain not only thicker films but 

films in sheer quantity, an important feature when envisaging future mass production of multilayered 

biomedical devices. 

Emphasis was given to discussing an exhaustive list of potential biomedical applications that may 

benefit from LbL-based approaches. Implantable devices, such as coated prosthesis cells, may have 

facilitated biointegration in a living organism. Surfaces may be modified to exhibit “special” properties 

that result in improved mechanical properties, or with stimuli-responsiveness that may help tuning the 

adhesion of cells or tissues to PEMs. Moreover, being LbL a versatile technique, convoluted three-

dimensional PEM arrangements can be obtained throughout all dimensional scales: 0D (nanoparticles 

and fibers), 1D (nanotubes), 2D (thin coatings and membranes) and 3D (tubes, capsules, scaffolds). 

Free-standing membranes may act as wound healing dressings, porous scaffolds as novel cell 

expansion supports for tissue engineering, and tubular structures as analogues for blood vessels. Also, 

the use of cells as multilayer constituents may allow building hybrid constructs that resemble tissues 

both in function and structure. From all 3D devices explored, spherical capsules have been by far the 

most studied. They offer possibilities of drug delivery and biosensing either by diffusion or by targeting 

cells, while degradation and cargo release/reactivity can be finely controlled by a variety of mechanisms. 

Finally, structures mimicking natural structures, such as that of biological cells, can be constructed in 

the form of compartmentalized structures exhibiting organization at distinct size scales. Although 

generally limited to confining enzymatic reactions, they may be customized and act as multifunctional 

microreactors to simulate specific events, such as disease models and microtissue production. It is 

expected that LbL will continue to contribute to technological advancements in the biomedical field.

Both in conventional medicine and in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the possibilities 

opened by LbL will allow developing devices with superior performance when compared to the 

technology currently in use.

 Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules

3.1 General introduction 

Scientists have long discovered that macromolecules are the best option for obtaining highly functional 

and complex materials. Hierarchical organization, self-assembly, or “intelligence” are common to many 

natural macromolecules and desirable for several applications in biology and biotechnology. Proteins, 

nucleic acids, and polysaccharides are fine examples of structures that have been employed in many 

biomimetic concepts displaying such properties. 

In biomedicine, several advances have been made in the last decades regarding the design and 

conception of new state-of-the-art devices with great potential for future in-depth studies and, ultimately, 

use in human healthcare services. Some of them emerged from the increasing use of elastin-derived 

materials, consisting in viable and functional protein-based molecules as alternatives to the conventional 

polymers used in biomedical applications, including in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 

(TERM). 

Elastin-like macromolecules are genetically engineered materials rooted in the repeating sequence of 

natural elastin, a vital protein component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in various mammalian 

tissues [1]. As biomaterials, they became popular for exhibiting excellent mechanical properties [2-6] 

and biocompatibility [7-10]. They have also shown potential to self-assemble and respond to changes of 

the environment or under physiological conditions [11-14]. 

Because of their genetic-engineered origin, they are often called elastin-like polymers or, more recently, 

elastin-like recombinamers [15]. This class of materials can be modified to virtually include any desired 

peptide sequence, especially functional sequences with relevant biological role [16-18], and has already 

been studied extensively for applications in drug delivery [19-21], and cell and tissue engineering [22-

24]. In the following sections, a comprehensive discussion of the importance of elastin-like 

macromolecules in the conception of TERM devices will be presented. Here, not only their properties 

will be presented but also their origin and natural inspiration.

3.2 Materials engineering – an overview on synthetic and natural biomaterials 

Biomaterials have been applied in Medicine since the early 1950’s and expanded in four traditional 

directions: metals, polymers, ceramics, and combinations thereof – composites [25,26]. More recently, 

biological or natural materials, found in animals and plants, were added as a fifth direction. Natural 

materials are intricate structures which have risen from hundreds of millions of years of evolution. 

Comparing to our current technology, Nature was able to conceive structures more complex than 

man-made materials, forming complex arrays, hierarchical structures and multi-functionality [26,27]. 

According to Wegst and Ashby [28], natural materials can be categorized into four groups: (i) ceramics 

and ceramic composites – shells, bones or any material where the mineral component is prevalent; (ii) 

polymer and polymer composites – e.g. ligaments and silk; (iii) elastomers – elastic soft tissues in the 

body which undergo large stretches or strains; and (iv) cellular materials – typically light-weight 

materials prevalent for example in feathers, wood and cancellous bone. 

Upon implantation, natural-based biomaterials can be recognized by the body and process it through 

established metabolic pathways [29,30]. The metabolic products end up being simple sugars, amino 

acids or minerals. This eliminates the possibility of cytotoxic and inflammatory response from the host, 

a situation occurring with wear particles of long-term orthopedic joint prostheses made of metal or 

synthetic polymers [31]. In this regard, inspiration was found in Nature to develop new materials and 

new methods of processing. In particular, the scientific community has been exploiting biological 

systems to produce tailored materials. Such synergy between the idealized material and its final 

construction is the basis of Biomimetism [32,33]. This principle has already started to be applied 

through genetic engineering, through the construction of specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 

sequences in order to obtain a desired peptide [34]. Elastin-like macromolecules are one successful 

example of this methodology, mimicking natural elastin, which will be discussed in the following 

sections. 

3.3 Elastin as a source of inspiration for nature-inspired polymers 

Elastin is a vital biopolymer with elastic properties. It can be found in the structures that require 

elasticity as part of their function, stretching and relaxing more than a billion times during life [1]. For 

instance, the content of elastin in skin is 5–10%, in ligaments is 10–15% and in the aorta it is as high 

as 40–50% [35].

3.3.1 Genetic coding 

The elastin gene is a single copy gene found in chromosome 7 in humans [36]. Tropoelastin is the 

product of this gene and the precursor of human elastin. It is a 72 kDa soluble precursor with 760 

residues [37,38], and is expressed by various cell types during the pre- and neonatal stages of 

development, including smooth muscle [39] and endothelial cells [40], fibroblasts [41] and 

chondrocytes [42]. Currently, the full amino acid composition of tropoelastin is known for several 

species besides humans, like rats and bovines. Although some variations exist, there is still a similarity 

of 70% among the different tropoelastin species [36,43-46]. 

The elastin gene possesses 36 exons, encoding two major alternating domains: hydrophobic 

(responsible for elasticity) and hydrophilic crosslinking domains. The composition of the hydrophobic 

domains is a combination of glycine (G), valine (V), proline (P), alanine (A), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) 

residues – being the first two the most abundant – often repeated in sequences of (GVGVP), (GVPGV) 

and (GVGVAP). The hydrophilic domains contain several lysine (K) and A residues, which show an 

important role in the crosslinking of tropoelastin.[1,36,47] 

In order to synthesize the mature elastin, the precursor must undergo a process called elastogenesis 

(Figure 3.1), a highly complex phenomenon comprising all the events that lead to the synthesis of a 

fully functional elastic fiber [48]. The process starts with the synthesis of tropoelastin itself, in the rough 

endoplasmic reticulum. As soon as they are formed, a galactolectin – an elastin-binding protein – acts 

as a chaperone that prevents premature intracellular aggregation [48]. This association lasts until the 

complex is excreted into the extracellular medium. The binding protein has a higher affinity for 

galactosugars of the microfibrilar component of the extracellular medium. Outside the cells, the 

microfibrils act as scaffolds for the deposition and alignment of tropoelastin molecules, which end up 

cross-linked to each other in K-containing sites [49,50]. Crosslinking is the culmination of elastogenesis, 

resulting in mature elastin, which is insoluble but extremely stable. In fact, it is one of the most stable 

proteins known and has a half-life of from 40 to 70 years [51,52].

proceeding to its alignment by microfibrils. 

3.3.2 Characteristics of elastin 

Mature elastin is an insoluble polymer composed by several or more tropoelastin molecules covalently 

bound to each other by crosslinks. Despite its essential hydrophobic nature, elastin can be highly 

hydrated by water molecules from both hydration and solvent water. In between the very rigid 

crosslinking domains, the hydrophobic segments exhibit a considerable mobility [36,53]. 

Despite several decades of research, elastin’s own nature has hindered the study of its properties and 

structure, mostly due to the insolubility in water and backbone mobility. Nevertheless, scientists were 

able to obtain important knowledge regarding this polymer. For example, calorimetric studies have 

shown that entropy is the primary source of its remarkable elasticity and swelling capability in vivo [54-

56]. 

There are two main models that attempt to explain elastin’s behavior: the single-phase model (also 

known as random-chain model) and the two-phase model. The latter can be further divided into the 

liquid-drop and the oiled-coil models. The single-phase model considers elastin to be like a typical 

rubber with randomly distributed polymeric chains in any solvent system [55,57]. The two-phase 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

107 

models state that water-swollen elastin is composed of hydrophobic domains between cross-linked 

proteins and the aqueous solvent is driven to the spaces between its domains. Specifcally, the liquid-

drop model [58] assumes that the peptide segments between the crosslinks are globular domains. The 

oiled-coil model [59] is similar to the liquid-drop model, but assumes that the so called “oiled-coils” are 

broader in comparison and composed of a series of ?-turns between the crosslinking domains. 

Unfortunately, none of the models described provide sufficient insight regarding the molecular basis for 

its elastomeric properties at atomic level. The groups of Urry and Tamburro carried out a variety of 

physical-chemical studies using synthetic elastin-based pentapeptides to investigate the relationship 

between its structure and function [4,56,60,61]. Their studies led to the conception of yet another two-

phase perspective: the ?-spiral or fibrillar model, stating that there is one type II ?-turn per pentameric 

unit, stabilized by intra-spiral, inter-turn, and inter-spiral hydrophobic contacts. The repetition of this 

conformational unit results in an organized helical arrangement called the ?-spiral, hence the name of 

the model. 

3.3.3 Elastin disorders 

Mutations involving elastic fibers are important for understanding the function of elastin and the process 

of elastogenesis and associated disorders. Congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a 

pathological condition associated with a mutation in the elastin gene. The symptom is the obstruction of 

the outflow from the left ventricle narrowing of the arterial lumen, due to a failure to regulate cellular 

proliferation and matrix deposition of elastin [62-64]. At the molecular level, the cause is a lack of some 

crosslinking domains or deficient coacervation of tropoelastin molecules [62,65]. SVAS can be inherited 

as an autosomal dominant trait or as part of the Williams’ syndrome, a developmental disorder 

involving the central nervous system and the connective tissues [66]. Another pathology linked to the 

elastin gene is cutis laxa, a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by abnormally branched and 

fragmented elastic fibers with reduced tropoelastin deposition in the elastic fibers and few microfibrills 

in the dermis. The symptoms are inelastic loose-hanging skin, hernias, and emphysema [67,68]. 

Changes in other molecules found in elastic fibers may also result in deficient elastogenesis or 

abnormal structures. Marfan’s syndrome, for example, is an autosomal dominant disorder associated 

with mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, characterized by pleiotropic manifestations in the ocular, 

skeletal, and cardiovascular systems [69].

Elastin can be used as a biomaterial in different forms. It can be found in its insoluble form in purified 

elastin preparations, or it can be hydrolyzed to obtain soluble elastin ones. One problem associated with 

elastin use in biomedical devices is calcification because it serves as a nucleation site for mineralization, 

a problem to be considered especially in cardiovascular implants. Fortunately, it can be controlled by 

using molecules that prevent calcification, like ethanol/ ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 

treatments or the addition of glycosaminoglycans or basic fibroblast growth factor [70-72]. 

Naturally, elastin can be found also in autografts, allografts, xenografts and decellularized ECM’s. Well-

known examples are split-skin autografts for burn wounds, autologous saphenous veins and umbilical 

vein allografts for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and aortic heart valve xenografts. Incorporation 

of elastin in biomaterials is especially significant when its elasticity or biological effects can be exploited. 

3.3.4.1 Skin 

Skin is the largest organ of the human body. It is composed by two layers: epidermis and the dermis, 

which lay on subcutaneous fat. The epidermis consists mainly of layers of keratinocytes scattered with 

other cell types, among them melanocytes and Langerhans cells. It is separated from the dermis by the 

basement membrane. The dermis is comprised of papillary and reticular compartments which contain 

an ECM made of collagen, reticulum fibers, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans. The cellular constituents 

are mainly fibroblasts [73,74]. 

Skin substitutes are usually applied to treat either burn or chronic wounds. There are several 

commercial solutions currently available, like Apligraf
®
, among others [75]. Apligraf

®
 is a type I collagen 

gel cultured with human neonatal foreskin dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and has been used for 

the treatment of venous leg [76] and diabetic foot ulcers [77]. Like others, it contains little elastin, so 

autologous skin grafting is still the gold standard for skin substitutes. Other solutions have still been 

investigated. Hafemann et al. [78] developed a membrane of collagen and elastin of porcine origin to 

serve as a matrix for neo-dermis growth with acceptable morphology and function. Using rats as animal 

models, these membranes showed complete vascularization and colonization with fibroblasts and cells 

from the immune systems within three weeks. 

More recently, Nillesen et al. [79] designed an acellular double-layered skin construct, both cross-linked, 

to improve wound regeneration. The epidermal layer was essentially made of collagen containing 

heparin and a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 7 to stimulate the proliferation of keratinocytes. The dermal 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

109 

layer was porous and consisted of type I collagen fibrils, solubilized elastin from equine ligamentum 

nuchae, dermatan sulfate, heparin, FGF-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Using a rat 

model, and in comparison to another commercial skin substitute, Integra
®
DRT, the double-layered 

construct showed more cell influx, significantly less contraction and increased blood vessel formation at 

early time points. As late as 112 days, it also contained the most elastic fibers and hair follicle- and 

sebaceous gland-like structures could be identified. This work addressed a current problem of wound 

closure, which requires minimal contraction, vascularization, and elastogenesis in the early stages. 

3.3.4.2  Vascular constructs 

Type I collagen and elastin are the main components present in the arterial wall matrix supplying the 

artery with strength and elasticity, respectively. Blood vessels are structured in three layers: intima, 

media and adventitia. In the typical three-layered architecture, elastin is found in the intimal and medial 

layers. Collagen is also found in the media and adventitia sites [80,81]. 

Coronary artery and peripheral vascular diseases cause high mortality in western societies. The 

conventional treatment is surgery to restore blood flow using autologous vessels or valves [80,82]. 

Although autologous vessels remain the standard for small diameter grafts, many patients do not have 

a vessel suitable for grafting because of vascular disease, amputation, or previous harvest. Artificial 

grafts made from expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) or Invista Dacron
®
 are an alternative 

option [83,84], but for smaller vessels (diameter less than 5 mm) the possible formation of clots from 

thrombotic events may rapidly close them. In the past two decades, tissue-engineered solutions have 

emerged, using elastin as a crucial ingredient. Stitzel et al. [85] have developed vascular graft scaffolds 

fabricated by electrospinning using polymer blends of type I collagen from calf skin, elastin from bovine 

neck ligament, and poly (D,L-lactide-co -glycolide) (PLGA). The scaffolds were tested both in vitro and in 

vivo, using a mice model, and showed an absence of elicit local and systemic toxic effects. They also 

possessed a tissue composition and mechanical properties similar to that of native vessels. Koens et 

al. [80] developed a triple layered construct consisting of an inner layer of elastin fibers, a middle 

(porous) film layer of collagen fibrils and an outer scaffold layer, also made of collagen. The substitute 

did not evoke platelet aggregation in vitro. The structure could also be sutured and was considered 

adequate for in vivo application.

3.4 Nature-inspired biosynthetic elastins 

Typically, aggressive methods of extraction are used to isolate elastin from tissues. Those can comprise 

the use of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 98ºC, or autoclaving [86,87]. More recent approaches 

follow stepwise protocols under mild conditions by peptide-bond cleavage [88]. However, the yield of 

these approaches is usually low. Based on the exploitation of biological systems, one was developed 

that helps addressing this problem by the production of tailored molecules mimicking natural elastin 

through genetic engineering. The pentapeptide poly(VPGVG) was the first to be extensively studied, for 

being the most abundant sequence in natural elastin, but variations of this model soon followed. It was 

possible to produce recombinant peptides with precision over the primary amino acid content, being 

able to introduce relevant functional sequences, for example to improve cell adhesion, trigger 

biomineralization and vascularization.  Due to their characteristics and peptide sequence, these 

molecules are known as elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), a recombinant class of elastin-like polymers 

(ELPs) [15]. 

3.4.1 General properties of elastin-like recombinamers 

ELRs are a promising class of biocompatible protein-based polymers inspired in the mammalian elastin 

protein sequences, or modifications thereof [4,34,89]. In aqueous solution and below a certain 

transition temperature (Tt), the free polymer chains are disordered, consisting in fully hydrated random 

coils, mainly by hydrophobic hydration. This kind of hydration is characterized by ordered clathrate-like 

water structures surrounding the nonpolar moieties of the polymer with a structure somewhat similar to 

that described for crystalline gas hydrates, although a more heterogeneous one that varies in terms of 

perfection and stability [4,13]. When the temperature is increased above Tt, the structure loses the 

water molecules from hydrophobic hydration and the chains fold and assemble. A phase-separated 

state is formed, consisting of 63% water and 37% polymer, in weight. In this self-assembled separated 

state, the chains adopt a regular non-random structure known as ?-spiral conformation [60,61,90]. 

Urry studied this phenomenon and stated that a polypeptide with a correct balance of polar and 

nonpolar amino acids can be soluble in water at low temperatures, yet undergoing a phase separation 

from the aqueous medium upon raising temperature [91]. In the latter case, the structures assemble 

into anisotropic fibers due to hydrophobic associations between the ?-spirals. This folding is completely 

reversible if the temperature of the sample is decreased again below Tt [4,34]. This transition 

phenomenon is called inverse temperature transition (ITT) and has become the key issue in the 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

111 

development of new peptide-based polymers as molecular machines and materials [92]. Although the 

phenomenology of ELRs is similar to that of amphiphilic polymers with a lower critical solution 

temperature (LCST), the presence of an ordered state above the Tt led to the usage of the term “inverse 

temperature transition” as a descriptive term for these polymers’ behavior [92,93]. 

The self-assembly of ELRs is also dependent on others factors and external stimuli besides temperature. 

There is a strong dependence of the Tt on concentration in the range of 0.01 to 5–10 mg.mL
-1

, 

showing a decrease in Tt with increasing macromolecule concentration, due to the facilitated 

aggregation of molecules in higher number [13,34]. Above this range, the Tt does not show further 

significant changes with increasing concentrations up to 150–200 mg.mL
-1

 [13,94]. Increasing the 

ionic strength of an ELR solution also influences the Tt and is particularly useful to trigger the ITT 

phenomenon when its concentration is low. Reguera et al. [95] suggested that an increase in the salt 

concentration increases the polarity of the solvent. This creates a higher difference in polarity with 

respect to the hydrophobic moieties of the polymer, recruiting more and more ordered water molecules 

to surround the polymer chains. Increasing the molecular weight of the ELR has also been 

demonstrated to decrease the Tt [96,97]. ELRs can be modified in order to exhibit smart behavior 

towards other stimuli. By modifying the composition of the polymer it is possible to conceive materials 

that react to stimuli like pH, redox reactions and even light [90,98,99]. 

Some ELR systems have been developed, being successful in maintaining some of the main 

characteristics of natural elastin. For example, the cross-linked matrices of these polymers retain most 

of the mechanical properties of elastin [100,101], which becomes important when this behavior is 

accompanied by other interesting properties, such as biocompatibility, stimuli-responsive behavior, and 

the ability to self-assemble. 

3.4.2 The principle of genetic engineering – a powerful tool for engineering 

materials 

In the last decade protein biosynthesis showed the ability to directly produce high molecular weight 

polypeptides of exact amino acid sequence with high fidelity. Its usefulness to biosynthesize ELRs 

proceeds with near-absolute control of their macromolecular architecture in size, composition, 

sequence, topology, and stereochemistry [102,103]. There are a few limitations, however, in respect to 

the sequence and its final properties. In the general model (VPGXG), X does not support 

proline.[15,104] Substitution of amino acids in other positions is also limited. For example, 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

112 

poly(APGVG) becomes an irreversible granular precipitate instead of a reversible viscoelastic coacervate 

upon increasing the temperature [105]. 

Recombinant DNA technology and bacterial protein expression have been employed for the biosynthesis 

of repetitive polypeptides based on the 20 naturally occurring amino acids with no direct parallels in 

Nature [91,102,106]. It is a technology that clearly opens infinite possibilities, with far more potential 

than most common synthetic ways of production, limited only by the living molecular machinery itself. 

Urry has presented five essential axioms to conceive protein-based macromolecules capable of 

undergoing hydrophobic folding and assembly due to inverse temperature transitions, presented in 

Figure 3.2. Shortly, the axioms describe that the ITT depends on an ELR aminoacid composition and 

that external factors can also influence its conformation and Tt. 

 

The manner in which a guest aminoacid, alters the transition temperature, Tt, of a 

hydrophobic folding and/or assembly transition is a functional measure of its

hydrophobicity.

Raising the temperature above Tt results in hydrophobic folding and assembly and

can be used to perform useful mechanical work – thermomechanical transduction.

At a constant temperature, lowering the Tt to below an operating temperature, by

decreasing its hydrophobicity, also results in hydrophobic folding and assembly.

Temperature, pressure, chemical concentrations, charged state of functional side

chains, redox states and light-elicited changes in the structure can be used to alter Tt. 

Distinct functional groups sensitive to any of the above mentioned factors can be

coupled by being part of the same hydrophobic folding and assembly domain.

All the mentioned energy conversions can be demonstrated to be more efficient

when carried out using more hydrophobic protein-based polymers.

Typically, ELRs are produced by Escherichia coli strains through bacteria fermentation, accounting for 

nearly 80% of the cell’s volume by the end of the process within cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies. It can 

achieve low production costs by producing an elastin sequence via the machinery of living cells, 

independently of its complexity. The production cost of those materials is not related to their complexity 

since the most costly task in terms of both time and money is the gene construction. However, once the 

plasmid is inserted in the microorganism genetic information, the fast and cheap production of the 

polymer rapidly compensates for the costs associated with the molecular biology steps. This intrinsic 

advantage also has environmental benefits, since recombinant protein-based materials are obtained by 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

113 

an easily scalable technology fermentation that uses only moderate amounts of energy and 

temperatures, with water as the only solvent [15,91,107,108]. 

3.4.3 From genetic construction to molecules with tailored bio-functionality 

The design of an appropriate strategy at the gene level is critical for the efficient synthesis of the protein 

encoding sequence and to produce a uniform protein product with an optimal quality and yield. The 

biosynthesis of any artificial protein generally includes: (i) design and construction of a coding synthetic 

gene for the protein of interest in a plasmid with close transcription control; (ii) the cloning of a 

recombinant gene with the necessary transcriptional regulatory elements into competent host cells; (iii) 

the screening of plasmids containing the desired clones and verification of their DNA sequence; (iv) 

transformation of the chosen plasmids into expression-competent host cells; (v) the growth of 

appropriate volumes of host cells and induction of protein expression; and (vi) purification of the protein 

of interest from cell lysates [109]. 

Molecular biology techniques are typically employed to self-ligate monomer DNA fragments in an 

oligomerization process that relies on restriction-enzyme-based approaches when designing genes that 

encode repetitive recombinamers. In this case, the monomeric fragments must be oligomerized in a 

“head-to-tail” orientation and can either be seamless in sequence or contain intervening linkers between 

the desired repeats. Approaches to oligomerization can be classified as: (i) iterative, where a DNA 

segment is oligomerized in a series of single, uniform steps. Each step extends the oligomer by one unit 

of length of the monomer gene; (ii) random method or “concatemerization”, where an uncontrolled 

number of monomer DNA segments are oligomerized in a single step to create a population of 

oligomerized clones with different lengths. This method creates a library of genes of different lengths 

that encode oligomeric polypeptides with the same repeat sequences but sacrifices the precision of the 

oligomerization process; finally, (iii) recursive directional ligation (RDL), an alternative method in which 

DNA segments with two different restriction sites flanking the insert are joined in sequential steps, with 

the length of the ligated segments growing geometrically in each step. This approach is suitable for the 

synthesis of repetitive polypeptides with a specific and predetermined chain length as it seamlessly 

joins the two monomeric inserts and also eliminates the restriction sites placed at either end of the 

dimerized gene [110]. 

An obvious disadvantage of oligomerization would seem to be the incapability to generate biopolymers 

with unnatural aminoacids, such as those not encoded by conventional codons or ones containing 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

114 

chemical modifications, cyclic aminoacids, aromatic amino acids or ?-amino acids, amongst others. 

Fortunately, this problem can be resolved by native chemical ligation [111,112]. Recently, Liu et 

al. [113]  have developed a new approach that allows incorporating unnatural amino acids to be 

genetically encoded in mammalian cells.  

One of the main goals in the materials field is to develop materials with an increasing and 

programmable degree of complexity which is closely related with the application. More complex 

materials are capable to perform more complex and tailored functions (Figure 3.3).

various applications. Recombination techniques allow obtaining several degrees of complex: the

sequences and blocks with distinct properties; (c) the inclusion of a bioactive motif or; (d) the inclusion 

of more than one in the same peptidic formulation. 

 

The primary sequence of ELRs is responsible for the formation of well-defined secondary structures, 

such as ?-helices, ?-sheets or ?-turns, assembling into supramolecular structures. Furthermore, they 

can be switched by several factors, such as temperature, pH and light in aqueous solution and can 

include crosslinking or self-assembling domains and diverse bio-functionalities along the polypeptide 

chain. Those may include targeting ligands, cell adhesion or specific biodegradation sequences, 

fluorescent or contrast agents. Combined with their good expected biocompatibility and favorable 

degradation rate and products, they constitute promising materials for multiple applications, with 

particular emphasis in biomedical and nanotechnological applications [114,115].

3.4.4 Biocompatibility of ELRs 

The biocompatibility feature of ELRs, which is relevant for their use in advanced biomedical applications, 

was evaluated by the complete series of the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) generic 

biological tests for materials and devices in contact with tissues, tissue fluids and blood [101,116,117]. 

Regarding these biopolymers, it has not been possible to obtain monoclonal antibodies against them; it 

would seem that the immune system cannot distinguish them from the natural elastin. In a more 

detailed interpretation of this effect, Urry et al. [118] have suggested that the ?-spiral strongly 

contributes to prevent the identification of these foreign materials by the immune system. Additionally, 

the secondary products of its biodegradation are just simple and natural amino acids that can be 

metabolized by the body to produce non-toxic degradation products. More detailed examples of their 

biocompatibility and multifunctional possibilities will be discussed in the next section. 

3.5 ELRs as advanced materials for biomedical applications 

ELRs have found widespread use due to their good biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity in the 

fields of drug delivery and tissue engineering. As they can be genetically synthesized, the precisely-

defined molecular weight is ideal for drug delivery, because the molecular weight is a key parameter in 

the route of clearance from the body and in vivo half-life of the polymer [104]. The ability to display 

stimuli-driven variations in their structure as consequence of their self-assembling behavior in aqueous 

solution has been exploited into useful functional structures and devices combining these properties, 

with an adequate arrangement of specific building blocks and physicochemical and mechanical 

properties. 

3.5.1 Tissue engineering 

New classes of materials with additional tissue-specific properties or ones which could be tailored to 

several tissue systems are required for TERM. The ECM is an important model for the design of 

biomaterials. The goal of mimicking the ECM structure and biological functions requires the design of 

artificial scaffolds that reproduce one or, preferably, more properties and functionalities of the natural 

tissue [119,120]. The scaffold must be biocompatible and biodegradable and it should own properties 

that support tissue morphogenesis. This generally requires a multifunctional artificial ECM that can 

supply temporary mechanical support until the engineered tissue has sufficient mechanical integrity to 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

116 

support itself. Future advances in tissue engineering will depend on the development of biomimetic 

materials that actively participate in the formation of new functional tissues [27]. 

Recombinant DNA technologies allow designing and expressing artificial genes to prepare artificial 

analogues of ECM proteins with controlled mechanical properties that incorporate domains to modulate 

cell behavior. Crosslinked ELRs of poly(VPGVG) resulted in a matrix showing a mechanical response 

similar to the natural elastin [116], which is an important factor to provide a structural basis that 

properly transmits the forces from the environment to the growing tissue. However, these cross-linked 

matrices showed anti-fouling properties limiting cell adhesion. Although lacking bio-functionality that 

would promote unspecific cell adhesion, the poly(VPGVG) concept matrix was used as starting material 

with good mechanical and biocompatible properties, and short peptides having specific bioactivities 

were inserted into the polymer chain, even though by chemical synthesis. Once genetic engineering 

techniques became the production method of choice, the molecular design started to increase in 

complexity. To increase the complexity of ELRs, a simple substitution of the amino acid X in the elastin 

repeated unit (VPGXG) results in the addition of cross-linking domains to obtain more stable substrates, 

which are usually based on lysine residues [2,121-123]. 

Several modular ELRs have been designed to include bioactive peptides into the polymer chain such as 

the well-known, general purpose cell-adhesion sequence RGD [124], found in several ECM proteins 

[18,125-127], and arginine-(glutamic acid)-(aspartic acid)-valine (REDV) [128], included in the CS5 

domain of fibronectin and specific for endothelial cells [17,129]. An extra feature – namely degradation 

responsiveness – has been included into more advanced versions of ELRs for tissue repair to allow the 

renovation and replacement of natural ECM by living tissue [17,130]. In this regard, ELR-hydrogels have 

been obtained by different cross-linking methods such as photo-initiation [131], irradiation [132], or 

enzymatic cross-linking [121]. The physical properties can be tuned by the cross-linking conditions and 

degree, while retaining the stimuli-responsive behavior. This way, appropriate bioactive substrates can 

be obtained for a wide range of applications. Highly porous hydrogels have been conceived by chemical 

cross-linking of ELRs containing REDV sequence: a salt leaching/gas foaming was performed to obtain 

suitable 3D scaffolds promoting infiltration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) inside 

the porous network (Figure 3.4) [133].

phenylindole (DAPI) staining; and (b) SEM magnified view. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from

Another potential application of these bioactive ELRs is the preparation of films to be used for ocular 

surface tissue engineering [134,135]. Recently, Srivastava et al. [135] have successfully investigated 

the use of ELRs as a substrate to maintain the growth, phenotype, and functional characteristics of 

retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro to obtain a suitable carrier for transplantation in the treatment of 

age-related macular degeneration. 

Hybrid scaffolds composed of collagen and different proportions of this ELR-REDV have been obtained 

by enzymatic cross-linking by tissue transglutaminase, affecting physical properties such as porosity, 

thermal behavior and mechanical strength. Such approach led to a differential colonization of the 

scaffolds with diverse cell lines, which is very useful for vascular-tissue and skin-wound healing [121]. 

Other complex hybrid scaffolds were created to obtain an acellular arterial substitute as artificial vessel-

like platforms: they were produced by the combination of several layers of an ELR matrix reinforced with 

collagen microfibers, resulting in constructs with appropriate mechanical properties, such as 

compliance or suture retention strength [136]. Other types of smart bilayer scaffolds of an ELR 

containing RGD and collagen have also been investigated – foams, fibers and foam-fiber bilayer 

scaffolds [137]. The study of the structural and mechanical properties indicated that the incorporation 

of ELRs into the scaffold improved the uniformity of the pore network and decreased the fiber diameter. 

The culture of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells in these scaffolds showed the positive contribution 

of the bioactive ELR on the proliferation of both cell types, compared to a collagen foam. These results 

were promising for the reconstruction of full-thickness skin and oral mucosa equivalents. 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

118 

Other strategies consist in the incorporation of ELR coatings onto different materials to improve cell 

attachment or stimuli-responsiveness. Barbosa et al. [138] developed chemically cross-linked chitosan 

hydrogels with an ELR coating containing an osteoconductive sequence inducing precipitation of 

calcium phosphate when the gels were soaked in simulated body fluid. More recently, an ELR 

incorporating octaglutamic acid with well-defined charged backbone has been used to design 

multifunctional bone cements resulting in materials with hydroxyapatite binding ability and improved 

mechanical strength [139]. Prieto et al. [140] have designed a set of ELRs containing the SNA15 

statherin analog domain. In vitro mineralization showed interesting results in the effect of the ELR 

composition as a key parameter to control the calcium phosphate nucleation. These studies show the 

high potential of ELRs for biomedical hybrid materials development. 

Another attractive alternative is based in the thermal behavior of modular amphiphilic ELRs to form in 

situ stable gels under physiological conditions [141,142]. They constitute low viscosity solutions below 

their Tt and form physically cross-linked hydrogels by self-assembling that are suitable for fixing 

materials and biological elements in specific sites in the body through minimally invasive procedures. 

When greater mechanical integrity is desired, the mechanical properties can be enhanced by including 

additional chemical crosslinking domains in the ELR chain [117,143]. Sallach et al. [144] have also 

highlighted the good biocompatibility of these ELR physical gels showing a minimal inflammatory 

response and robust in vivo stability for periods exceeding 1 year. These self-gelating materials offer the 

possibility to obtain multifunctional bioactive versions, which can be also used as carriers for controlled 

drug release or as biocompatible surface coatings. Oliveira et al. [145] used an ELR containing the RGD 

cell adhesion domain to fabricate cell-induced microparticle aggregates as scaffolds for TERM. Using a 

SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cell line and microparticles with varying degrees of crosslinking, they have shown 

that for higher degrees of crosslinking the cell proliferation was more favorable and formed cell-induced 

aggregation scaffold. 

3.5.2 Drug- and gene- delivery 

Drug delivery carriers have several advantages over free drug delivery systems such as specific site 

targeting, sustained release, minimized systemic exposure and reduced toxicity. In order to be effective, 

systemic drug delivery carriers must be biocompatible and have controllable composition and molecular 

weight. Although a wide range of materials have been employed for controlled and targeted drug 

release, the most common carriers are polymeric-based systems [146,147]. 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

119 

ELRs exhibit several properties that can be useful for drug delivery purposes, such as precise control 

over molecular weight and composition, self-assembly and stimuli-responsive behavior, as well as 

biocompatibility, non-toxic properties and efficient pharmacokinetics. In addition, their genetic nature 

allows incorporating targeting ligands, cell membrane fusion sequences or reactive sites for drugs 

conjugation [21,148,149]. Their self-assembly can also be designed in response to an extrinsic 

temperature stimulus, such as the local application of heat, ultrasound or light, or intrinsic to the site 

environment, such as low extracellular pH or up-regulated protease expression for cancer drug 

delivery [150]. 

The ability of ELRs to form stable micro- and nano-particles that are able to trap active substances has 

facilitated the development of smart systems for therapeutic release. Poly(VPAVG) was shown to form 

stable particles in water solution with a size below 3 µm above its Tt. They exhibited hysteresis behavior 

and were capable of encapsulating significant amounts dexamethasone phosphate with a sustained 

release profile for about 30 days.[151] Later, two bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and BMP-14) 

were encapsulated for combined release in a sustained way for 14 days, promising for bone tissue 

engineering [19]. Electrospraying has been used by Wu et al. [152] to generate stimuli-responsive ELR 

nanoparticles (300–400 nm in diameter) that can encapsulate drugs. The molecular weight and 

solution concentration of the ELRs were found to have a significant influence on the morphology and 

size distribution of the nanoparticles. Doxorubicin, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, was released by 

the ITT-driven solubility of the particles at 37ºC. In other recent report, Dash et al. [153] have fabricated 

tunable monodispersed cross-linked ELR hollow spheres ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm by using a 

template-based method. Plasmid DNA and polyplexes were efficiently loaded inside hollow spheres by 

diffusion and charge interactions. These polyplex-loaded spheres displayed controlled release and 

transfection ability in their use as gene transfection agents, with the possibility to include future 

functionalities to the spheres for targeted gene delivery applications. 

Some of the recent studies are more focused on controlling the size and monodispersity of ELR 

particles, since these are two key factors in improving therapeutic efficacy. Genetic engineering of 

protein-based block copolymers is a suitable way to program defined polypeptide block sequences to 

study the influence of macromolecular architecture in the hierarchical structural organization and 

morphology. ELR-based amphiphilic block copolymers undergo ordered nanoscale self-assembly 

forming protein-like micellar systems with controlled structure and function. Strategies that describe 

stable monodispersed ELR particles include those of Chilkoti and co-workers [150,154,155] who 

fabricated sub-100 nm sized micelles conjugated to diverse hydrophobic molecules and 



Chapter 3. Elastin-like macromolecules 

 

120 

chemotherapeutics. The goal of these studies was to investigate the design rules for tuning the self-

assembly of different ELRs forming multivalent spherical micelles within the clinically relevant 

hyperthermic temperature range 37 to 42ºC and target cancer cells. Similarly, Kim et al. [156] 

improved the stability of micelles from ELR-diblock copolymers incorporating cysteine residues at the 

core-shell interface, which undergo covalent cross-linking through disulfide bond formation. Most of 

these studies involve diblocks, although there are some examples based on triblocks, such as one that 

relies upon a reversible switch of secondary structures [157]. The triblock-ELR copolymer can form 

monodispersed temperature-responsive micelles in dilute solutions below its Tt and an abrupt increase 

in the micelle compacticity with a reduction in particle size occurs upon raising the temperature. 

3.5.3  Surface engineering 

In the field of biomaterials science the control and modification of surfaces and interfaces has opened 

novel frontiers for developing advanced materials and devices with distinct and specific features for 

biomedical applications [158,159]. Surfaces can be functionalized by multiple approaches involving 

physical or chemical modifications, such as coatings and grafts. They allow introducing small biological 

ligands, like peptides or proteins with fouling/anti-fouling features, specific groups for cell-material 

interactions, smart behavior (stimuli responsive or environmentally sensitive), or micro- and nano-

patterns [160-162]. 

Surfaces modified with stimuli-responsive polymers, called “smart surfaces”, undergo physical and 

chemical changes in response to external variations [163-165]. In this regard, ELRs exhibit some 

additional advantages that make them excellent candidates for the development of smart surfaces: their 

stimuli-responsive behavior can depend on other factors such as pH, light, or ionic strength, amongst 

others. Genetic engineering also allows for a precise control of the reactive sites on the polypeptide 

chain for use in surface grafting, leading to an extensive potential of the self-assembly exhibited by 

these polymers. Biosensing surfaces displaying topologically modified self-assembly with ELRs have 

been developed by Chilkoti’s group. The “thermodynamically reversible addressing of proteins” (TRAP) 

technology obtained by covalent micro-patterning of ELRs onto glass surfaces against an inert 

background allows a reversible, spatio-temporal modulation of ligand-binding triggered by the phase 

transition of the ELR at a solid-liquid interface. Such technology can be applied in different systems for 

bio-analytical sensors in order to detect single biomolecules [159,164]. Fluorophore-labeled glutamine 

binding proteins (QBPs) and derivatives - which can be coupled to a designed hydrophobic polypeptide - 

can be constructed and adhered onto solid surfaces [166]. Another novel fusion protein for controlling

cellular functions combines the RGD sequence, epidermal growth factor (EFG), and a hydrophobic 

sequence into a single molecule: it was shown to exhibit both cell-adhesive and growth-factor activity. In 

addition, the hydrophobic sequence contributed to self-assembly of the RGD, retaining its activity on a 

solid-phase surface and proving its use for wound healing [167]. 

For tissue engineering, novel temperature-responsive culture surfaces coated with ELR has been 

developed for cell harvesting. By reducing the temperature using a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 

membrane, the cell sheet was detached from the coated surface and subsequently transferred to new 

surfaces, suggesting its potential for the fabrication of multilayer cell sheets for transplantation.[24] For 

bone tissue engineering, an ELR-RGD has been adsorbed onto micro-patterned poly(N -isopropyl 

acrylamide) films displaying a positive maintaining of the cell attachment in the scaffolds under dynamic 

culture conditions [168]. Na et al. [169] have also developed a lysine-containing ELR conjugated onto 

aldehyde-glass surface by micro-patterning. The sharp and controllable phase transition of ELR enabled 

reversible cell adhesion on the surface by changing the temperature or salt concentration, 

demonstrating potential applications for cell-based micro-devices. 

Other techniques using ELRs include the alternating adsorption of polyelectrolytes. This is a simple 

technique for generating bioactive surfaces, driven by complementary forces occurring between two 

distinct materials [170]. These ultra-thin nanoscale coatings promote cell adhesion and proliferation 

and the results show that the thickness and mechanical integrity of the multilayer assembly modulates 

the cell response. Swierczewska et al. [170] have reported the use of ELRs – modified either with 

poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) to provide positive or negative charge, respectively – 

to conceive films in a sequential fashion. Another similar work described a similar approach but with 

ELRs containing negatively charged residues [171]. Costa et al. also reported the construction of thin 

coatings [172] and nanostructured multilayers [173] made of chitosan and RGD-containing ELRs with 

smart properties towards temperature and pH (Figure 3.5) and also improved cell adhesion. These 

examples opened up a field where polymeric coatings include specific biofunctional responses. 

Progress in the last few years combining surface chemistry with microfabrication techniques has 

provided new tools to study cell-material interactions with their environment. Using lithography and 

patterning techniques, peptides and proteins can be deposited with absolute spatial control on specific 

regions of a surface [174,175].

The ability to obtain nano- and micro-structured surfaces of patterned biomacromolecules is of great 

importance for several applications, including biological assays, miniaturized biosensors, and 

biomedical diagnostics. In this regard, ELRs have been employed in the design and development of 

biosensors and microfluidic bioanalytical devices, as reported by Nath and Chilkoti [176]. 

Nanostructured surfaces taking advantage of the self-assembly properties of ELRs have been obtained 

for capturing and releasing proteins by combining ELRs and dip-pen nanolithography. 

Recently, the replica molding method has been adapted to obtain 3D micro-structured thermo-

responsive ELR hydrogels by Martín et al. [123]. In this study, the thermally responsive behavior of 

macroscopic and micro-patterned features with different dimensions and spacing was studied, showing 

dimensional changes with no alteration of the topography. This feature could be used during cell culture 

adjusting the Tt in the correct range to study cell behavior by changing the dimensions of the micro-

pattern and subsequent mechanical properties. 

3.6 Conclusions 

Elastin is the root of inspiration for a class of versatile materials with physical and biological properties 

of great interest for TERM applications. The cumulative studies of elastin and elastin-like 

macromolecules now provide the required background for understanding in more detail structure-

related aspects of such biomaterials from a functional point of view.

Taking advantage of genetic recombination approaches, one can easily “engineer” a peptide-based 

macromolecule exhibiting characteristics that can be tuned for specific fields: skin substitutes, vascular 

constructs, drug delivery devices and functional interfaces. Their functionality can be further expanded 

by adding sequences with biological relevance to the common elastin structure, like cell adhesion-, 

tissue-specific- and degradation-motifs. Complex, well-defined and tailored polymers can be obtained 

with a wide range of properties and possibilities for new devices. One could say that such degree of 

complexity is only limited by the imagination of the scientist: it still needs to be faithful to the original 

properties of elastin-like macromolecules, though, since an unfavorable modification can lead to a non-

functional polypeptide. 

The study and use of elastin-like macromolecules is leading to the design of new cutting-edge and more 

complex ones emerging as promising candidates for future treatments. Their smart behavior and self-

assembly properties may be exploited for further tuning and ultimate control of the performance of an 

elastin-based system, like how a specific cell phenotype will bind to a substrate, or how an active agent 

will be released under stimuli variations and biological conditions.

4.1 Introduction 

Surface engineering is a field of expertise dealing with the modification and improvement of interfaces. 

In conventional medicine, the surface properties of an implantable device are regarded with the utmost 

importance since the first contact with the organism is mediated by the interface with the organism. 

This interaction is what drives the subsequent tissue and cellular events, including protein adsorption, 

cell adhesion, and inflammatory response [1-3]. 

A device which surface is modified is often perceived as a static product that gives rise to an improved 

interface while retaining the mechanical bulk properties. However, specific applications may require that 

such interface is dynamic. In these cases, a surface should be able to respond towards external factors 

and considered as a step forward when developing systems with increasing complexity in healthcare, 

biomedicine and tissue engineering applications. An example of such a dynamic system is our own skin. 

Skin can be perceived as a multifunctional membrane that responds to its environment. Its reaction is 

different when exposed to distinct conditions – heat/cold, humidity, chemical/mechanical stress and 

light – and constitutes an elegant example of a sensorial stimuli-responsive structure found in 

Nature [4]. Such mechanism can be found in many other living processes: they can use 

macromolecules as construction elements or parts of cell machinery, including proteins/enzymes, 

polysaccharides and nucleic acids that typically exhibit a clear non-linear and reversible behavior. Some 

are stable along wide ranges of some external variables and undergo drastic conformational changes 

upon narrow variations around given critical points [5-7]. 

Inspired by natural examples, stimuli-responsive surfaces have been developed in the past two decades, 

often recurring to materials that exhibit reversible property switchability. These surfaces are capable of 

reversibly changing their properties depending on the environmental conditions, such as temperature, 

pH, ionic strength, light, electrical fields and biomolecules [8-10]. Thanks to their properties, stimuli-

responsive materials have been used to develop “smart” surfaces with significant potential in the fields

of material science and biotechnology for the spatial and temporal control of the attachment of cells, 

microorganisms or biomolecules, biosensor or diagnosis, or to control de diffusion of encapsulated 

molecules for drug delivery and bioseparation [4,11-14]. 

4.2 Surface modification methodologies: how to render substrates with stimuli 

responsiveness 

Many processing techniques have been suggested and employed for the purpose of modifying 

substrates. Most of them often rely on the use of physical or chemical methods, such as plasma and 

ion-beam sputtering [15]. However, in most cases, they are not suitable to produce stimuli-

responsiveness. Meanwhile, other techniques were introduced with capability of rendering a substrate 

with smart properties and will discussed in the following sections. 

4.2.1  Self-assembled monolayers 

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are ordered molecular assemblies formed by the self-assembly of 

an active surfactant onto a solid surface. In these two-dimensional systems, order is achieved by a 

spontaneous chemical synthesis at the interface [16]. The self-assembling molecules consist generally 

of three groups: (i) a head group, (ii) an alkyl chain and (ii) a terminal end group. The head group is 

responsible for the anchoring of the molecules onto the substrate (see Figure 4.1a). The alkyl chain, or 

spacer group, provides the stability of the monolayer, through van der Waals interactions. The terminal 

end group introduces chemical functionality into the monolayer system and is important for the overall 

properties of surfaces [17]. 

Surface chemistry represents an important tool for the preparation of a large variety of differently 

functionalized SAMs bearing a diversity of functional groups. There are three main approaches one can 

follow to obtain a suitable functional surface: (i) nucleophilic substitution, (ii) click chemistry and (iii) 

supramolecular modification. The first is a process through which a nucleophile (such as hydroxide, 

cyanide and ammonia) attacks an atom with a positive or partially positive charge connected to a 

negative or neutral leaving group [18]. Click chemistry generates substances by joining small units 

together with heteroatom links. Kolb, Finn and Sharpless [19] first introduced click chemistry as a 

technique that uses C–C bonds as a “currency”. Finally, the supramolecular modification is achieved by 

the functionalization of surfaces with tailor-made supramolecular binding motifs through specific 

interactions with the surface [20].

SAMs can be assembled by adsorption of a variety of functional organic molecules onto suitable solid 

substrates. For instance, long-chain alkanethiols bearing a terminal functional group spontaneously 

assemble onto gold to form densely packed and ordered monolayers [21]. They are the most commonly 

used materials for SAMs and – besides gold – can be assembled onto noble metals, such as silver and 

platinum [22,23]. Other combinations of adsorbates and substrates include silane compounds onto 

silicon oxide and titanium [24,25], and phosphonic acids onto titanium [26]. 

Unfortunately, the specificity of SAMS is a shortcoming: they can only be fabricated upon the adsorption 

of specific molecules onto specific surfaces. Furthermore, the resulting monolayers show generally a 

limited stability under ambient and physiological conditions, leading to facile exchange and “stripping” 

of the adsorbates [27]. Nonetheless, SAMs have thrived because they are easy to prepare as they do 

not require any specialized equipment for their preparation and can be constructed on objects of 

different size and shape such as thin films, nano-particles/wires/cages in colloids, with clear impact in 

nanoscience and nanotechnology. In particular, SAM-modified surfaces have been constructed to exhibit 

smart properties towards external stimuli such as electrical fields (due to the desorption of 

alkanethiolates) [28], light (by the inclusion of azobenzenes or spiropyrans) [29], redox reactions (by the 

inclusion of supramolecular rotaxanes) [30] to obtain surfaces for protein separation, diagnostic and 

with switchable wettability.

4.2.2  Thin polymer network films 

Nanostructured thin network films are structures in which surface confinement brings a range of 

opportunities for engineering stimuli-responsive properties. These are polymeric networks – in many 

cases very thin hydrogel films prepared from water-soluble polymers chemically linked to a surface, 

resulting in a soft surface with well-defined mechanical, physical and biochemical properties (see Figure 

4.1b) [31]. This kind of polymer network provides a soft three-dimensional scaffold similar to that of 

macroscopic hydrogels, capable of hosting a wide-array of functionalities, ranging from proteins to 

inorganic nanoparticles, but typically produced at the nano- and micro- scales. They can undergo 

substantial swelling and contraction in response to external stimuli, making them excellent candidates 

for “smart” surfaces with sensing and actuating characteristics [13]. 

The advantage towards their macroscopic counterparts is that gel thin films exhibit a fast swelling and 

shrinkage kinetics. In fact, this behavior was predicted by the Tanaka and Fillmore’s model which states 

that the characteristic time of the swelling transition is directly proportional to the square of the linear 

size of the gel [32]. A critical issue for understanding and predicting the properties of surface-attached 

polymer networks is the impact of confinement on their swelling behavior. Chemical linkage of the thin 

gel to a surface prevents swelling in the parallel direction to that of the substrate, effectively confining 

the volume change to one dimension. Such an effect has an impact in properties such as the structure, 

mechanical properties, dynamics, and permeability of the network [33]. Additionally, the swelling 

behavior of the polymer network is also influenced by the crosslinking degree of the film, as well as the 

nature of the polymer, e.g. if it is stimuli-responsive. 

An interesting property of thin gel polymer networks is that they are not limited to surfaces: they can 

also be processed in the form of freestanding films if neither adhesion or covalent bonding to the 

surface is triggered [4]. Therefore, it is possible to synthesize thin responsive membranes that can be 

used in the selective separation of molecules and particles. While traditional membranes can perform 

this function based on parameters like size and charge, responsive membranes can demonstrate a 

gating function controlled by external stimuli. For instance, pores in the membrane can be switched 

between an “open” or “closed” state and allow the passage of specific solution components at a 

specific time in function of one or more stimuli [34,35]. 

Summarizing, thin polymer networks have a fast swelling/shrinking response and can accommodate in 

their bulk various chemicals, biomolecules and nanoparticles. These properties make of thin gel 

polymer networks attractive systems in microtechnology, namely as selective membranes, intelligent 

drug delivery devices and biosensors [36-38].

4.2.3  Grafting 

Grafting is a technique by which a polymer is attached to a substrate, usually solid [39]. The bound 

polymer chains are often called “grafts” or “brushes” and lend their properties to the substrate (see 

Figure 4.1c). There are two major approaches of grafting that can be applied: “grafting-to” and 

“grafting-from” [40-42]. 

The “grafting-to” method refers to a chemical reaction between an end-functionalized polymer and a 

suitable surface containing complementary functional groups, and requires that the polymer is modified 

beforehand. Reactive end-functionalized polymers can be obtained through techniques such as 

controlled/living radical polymerization (CRP), group transfer and ring opening metathesis 

polymerizations [43-45]. A drawback of the “grafting-to” approach is the low density yield of the grafted 

chains: steric repulsions between polymer chains hamper the formation of dense polymer brushes [46]. 

Another drawback is that with increasing molecular weight of the polymer’s the reaction between the 

polymer end-group and the complementary group on the substrate becomes less efficient [47]. 

Nevertheless, “grafting-to” is simple to perform and, thanks to the covalent bond formed between 

surface and polymer, the brushes are robust and capable of withstanding both chemical and physical 

efforts. 

The “grafting-from” method refers to the preparation of polymer brushes in which the polymerization is 

triggered by initiator-functionalized surfaces. The immobilization of initiators on the surface can be 

achieved by treating the substrate with plasma or glow discharge in the presence of a gas or forming 

initiator-containing SAMs on the substrates. It can produce tethered layers of higher grafting densities 

than the “grafting-to” approach since the active centers (radicals, ions, and ion pairs) of the growing 

chains at the surface are easily accessible for monomer molecules in the swollen brush during the 

course of polymerization [48,49]. 

Regardless of the method – “to” or “from” – the principles are common to both: (i) the grafting 

techniques imply chemical attachment of polymers to the surface; (ii) the reaction occurs under 

appropriate reactive conditions, which are usually specific for the kind of materials and substrates 

involved; (iii) the polymers can be grafted to distinct types of surfaces, e.g. metals, glasses and silica, 

and not limited to planar substrates but also applied to spherical ones; and (iv) the substrates often 

assume the properties of the grafted polymer, with stimuli-responsive grafts rendering a smart-

responsive surface. 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

144 

A grafted polymer brush can be composed of chains from a single homopolymer – single-component 

homopolymer brushes – two or more different homopolymers – mixed brushes – or block-copolymers – 

block-copolymer brushes. In the first case, when dealing with smart surfaces, the responsive behavior 

originates from the inherent properties of the grafted polymer chains, their grafting densities, or by 

changes in the balance between polymer–polymer and polymer-solvent interactions [50]. In mixed 

polymer brushes, response comes from phase segregation, which causes the switching of the spatial 

distribution of the functional groups that are exhibited by the brush exterior. Consequently the materials’ 

properties can be switched between among the ones of the constituent polymers [51]. The responsive 

behavior of block copolymer brushes (as in mixed brushes) is based on the phase segregation of the 

different blocks. The combination of different polymeric blocks in the responsive film broadens the 

range of properties upon switching, so that the surface changes from the property of one polymer to the 

property of the second polymer, or is locked in some intermediate state [52]. Graft-modified surfaces 

with stimuli-responsive behavior have been extensively used in biology and nanotechnology. The cell-

sheet technology achieved through the attachment of poly(N -isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm), a 

thermoresponsive polymer, is one of the most representative examples of the grafting approach in 

tissue engineering [50]. Other applications based on other and stimuli (e.g. pH and ionic strength) have 

also been addressed, such as the switchable wettability of substrates, controlled release of drug delivery 

devices and sensors. 

4.2.4  Layer-by-layer 

Layer-by-layer (LbL) is a self-assembly-driven surface modification strategy that allows the construction 

of nanostructured films onto distinct geometries, from simple bidimensional surfaces to more complex 

three-dimensional porous structures. The principle behind it lies in the existence of multiple 

intermolecular interactions where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the most 

important role (see Figure 4.1d) [11,53,54]. Constructing a multilayer film usually has two 

requirements: (i) a reactive surface as the assembly support and (ii) a combination of two or more 

ingredients for the constitution of the film that can interact with each other. The buildup process is 

initiated by dipping the substrate in a solution of one ingredient that shows complementary interactions 

with the surface, forming therefore the first layer. Then another ingredient follows, interacting with the 

preformed layer, assembling a second one. Between each dip, a rinsing step is performed to remove 

excess of non-adhered material from the interface. In comparison with SAMs and polymer brushes, 

usually neither the surface nor the ingredients require modification prior to the LbL construction since 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

145 

assembling the layers rely on the intrinsic properties of each counterpart and their spontaneous 

assembly. 

Usually the most important requirement is that two distinct materials possess complementarity, i.e. that 

the properties of both materials result in attraction. In other words, LbL is a generic surface 

modification technique with which (in theory) any material and surface can be used for this end, in 

opposition to the methods described in the previous sections. The most representative buildup 

mechanism relies on electrostatic interactions among surface/ingredient and ingredient/ingredient. For 

instance, a polycation can be adsorbed to a negatively charged surface to form a layer. A polyanion can 

then adsorb to the now positively charged interface, rendering it with a negative charge [55]. This 

process can be repeated as many times as necessary under aqueous conditions to construct films with 

thickness at the order of a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. Although electrostatic self-assembly 

(ESA) is the most exploited mechanism, other interactions can be present, such as hydrophobic 

interactions and hydrogen bonding [53,56]. 

LbL offers ease of preparation at mild conditions of temperature, pressure and pH, versatility, fine 

control over the materials structure and robustness under physiological conditions. Additionally, the 

mild and non-aggressive processing conditions of LbL make of it an appealing technique for tissue 

engineering applications. There is a vast choice of available materials that one can add to a multilayer 

formulation, such as proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and virus particles, as well as various 

organic polymers, molecular assemblies [57-59]. and inorganic substances (e.g. clay platelets [60], 

grapheme [61] and glass nanoparticles [62]). Furthermore, although LbL has been first introduced as a 

surface engineering technique of planar surfaces [63], the concept has been extrapolated to 3D. The 

sequential mechanism of layer adsorption can be extrapolated to construct thick membrane-like films 

with tens of micrometers assembled on non-adhesive substrates (e.g. through van der Waals 

interactions with polypropylene) to produce freestanding films [64]. Other types of complex geometries 

with distinct shapes and sizes and as a result, devices such as porous scaffolds and drug delivery 

capsules can now exhibit new properties with the option of further tuning by varying the nature of the 

LbL ingredients and number of layers [65,66]. 

LbL films and shells can contain stimuli-responsive ingredients in order to render a system with a smart 

response. Exploiting the advantages of LbL and intelligent multilayer systems have already been 

proposed for different biomedical applications, including for biomimetic composite-like coatings, to 

control the release of drugs, or to manipulate the adhesion of attached cells. In particular, systems 

assembled using weak polyelectrolytes (e.g. chitosan and alginate) are inherently responsive towards 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

146 

ionic strength and pH responsive, since they interfere with the electrostatic balance within the internal 

structure of the film [58,67,68]. In similarity with polymer brushes, multilayer films with temperature 

responsive properties have also been fabricated to control the cell attachment/detachment to a surface 

for cell sheet technology, and to fabricate surfaces with acute wettability transitions [69,70]. 

4.3 Exploitable stimuli and model smart biomaterials 

4.3.1  Physical stimuli 

4.3.1.1  Temperature 

Among the stimuli used to control the response, temperature has been extensively studied in the 

biomedical field as certain diseases manifest temperature changes and this factor can be easily 

controlled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Thermo-responsive systems have a critical 

solution temperature at which the phase of the polymer and solution is discontinuously changed 

according to their composition.[8] PNIPAAm is the thermo-responsive polymer most used for conferring 

thermo-responsiveness to surfaces. It exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at about 

32ºC in aqueous solution, changing sharply from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state upon heating [71]. 

It is believed that this transition involves the breakage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the 

water molecules and the amide groups in the polymeric chains, which are replaced, above the LCST, by 

intramolecular hydrogen bonds amongst the dehydrated amine groups. PNIPAAm has been 

copolymerised with hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers in order to control the kinetics of the 

response [72,73]. 

Typically, above the LCST of PNIPAAm based surface-grafted polymers, surface wettability decreases 

and the thickness of the grafted layer decreases (deswelling). The work of Shi and co-workers [74] 

illustrates this behavior for bioactive composites of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) reinforced with Bioglass
®
 

(BG) and grafted with PNIPAAm through the use of plasma activation. The water contact angle for the 

PNIPAAm modified PLLA+10% BG composite was 51.9±2.4º, at 25ºC and at 37ºC it changed to 

58.8±2.4º, being consistent with the increase in the surface hydrophobicity above the LCST. The range 

of wettability can be further amplified to the super- hydrophobic/hydrophilic regimen by using 

substrates with increasing roughness [75], which is also predicted in the Wenzel model [76]. 

Besides the grafting of PNIPAAm-based polymers on distinct substrates, LbL assembling has also been 

used to confer temperature-responsiveness to surfaces. Serpe et al. [77] were the first to apply the LbL 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

147 

technique to produce temperature-responsive PNIPAAM/-co-acrylic acid (AA)/polyallylamine coatings. 

Since then, LbL surfaces containing PNIPAAm have already been suggested for cell sheet 

engineering [70]. 

Other thermo-responsive polymers may be used instead of PNIPAAm. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) 

is another thermo-sensitive polymer that can be deposited onto surfaces, which possesses very 

interesting properties for biomedical applications such as solubility in water, biocompatibility, a 

transition temperature around 31ºC and its cytoxicity has been referred as being much lower than the 

one of PNIPAAm.[78,79] Thermo-sensitive films based on triblock copolymers have also been 

prepared [80]. 

Nature also houses inspiration for the development of new polymers. Elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) 

– a recombinant class of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) – are genetically engineered peptide-based 

materials that mimic the structure of natural elastin [81]. By exploiting microorganism systems, tailored 

recombinant elastins based on the pentapeptide poly(VPGVG) can be produced and, thanks to their 

recombinant nature, recombinant peptides with precision over the primary aminoacid content is 

possible, being able to introduce relevant functional sequences, for example to improve cell adhesion, 

trigger biomineralization and vascularization [82-84]. 

In aqueous solution, and below a certain transition temperature (Tt), the free polymer chains are 

disordered, consisting in fully hydrated random coils. When the temperature is increased above Tt, the 

structure loses the water molecules from hydrophobic hydration and the chains fold and assemble into 

a ?-spiral conformation [85-87]. Although often associated with temperature-responsive polymers, the 

fact is that such transition phenomenon can occur due to other stimuli, such as pH, ionic strength, 

redox reactions and in specific modifications even due to light. In this perspective, ELRs could be 

classified as a multiple-responsive material, and surfaces modified with this kind of macromolecules 

have already been demonstrated to respond towards temperature, pH and ionic strength at the same 

time [69]. 

Biosensing surfaces displaying topologically modified self-assembly with ELRs have been developed by 

Chilkoti’s group. The “thermodynamically reversible addressing of proteins” (TRAP) technology obtained 

by covalent micropatterning of ELRs onto glass surfaces against an inert background allows a reversible, 

spatio-temporal modulation of ligand-binding triggered by the phase transition of the ELR at a solid-

liquid interface. Such technology can be applied in different systems for bio-analytical sensors in order 

to detect single biomolecules [88,89]. 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

148 

Smart thin coatings using an ELR containing RGD sequences are also a new and interesting example of 

thermo-responsive surfaces. These coatings can be fabricated through simple deposition of the ELR 

dissolved in aqueous-based solutions onto chitosan membranes [82]. It was shown that the 

conformational changes suffered by the ELR at its inverse temperature transition modified the 

topography at the nanoscale and the wettability of the polymeric substrate, which could be potentially 

used to control cell adhesion and protein adsorption (see Figure 4.2).

4.3.1.2  Light 

Light could be an interesting stimulus in the context of stimuli-responsive surfaces, as it is widely used 

in Nature as a source of energy. Photo-responsive polymers change their properties when irradiated 

with light, due to light-induced structural transformations of specific functional groups (e.g. 

chromophores) along the polymer backbone or side chains [90-92]. An important aspect of photo-

sensitive polymer systems is that using irradiation as a stimulus is a relatively straightforward, non-

invasive mechanism to induce a responsive behavior. The most well studied examples of photo-

responsive polymers are those that contain azobenzene groups. Azobenzene is a well-known 

chromophore with an irradiation-induced cis -to-trans isomerization that is accompanied by a fast and 

complete change in electronic structure, geometric shape, and polarity. By incorporating azobenzene 

derivatives into polymer structures, materials with variable shape, polarity, and self-assembly behavior 

can be obtained [91].  Azochromophores have been incorporated into a variety of polymeric 

systems [10,91]. Other chromophores, namely spiropyran and its derivatives have been incorporated 

terminally or pendantly to confer light sensitivity [93,94]. Spiropyran groups are relatively non-polar, but 

irradiation with the appropriate wavelength of light leads to the zwitterionic merocyanine isomer that has 

a larger dipole moment. 

Illustrative works where photo-responsive LbL films were prepared can be found elsewhere [91,95]. The 

studies related with photo-responsive LbL systems have shown that the photoresponsive cis –trans -

isomerization rates in the layers are highly dependent on the functional groups attached to the 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

149 

chromophores [91]. Most of the works regarding photo-responsive polymers require isomerization 

induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation or visible light. Recent years have also seen a growing interest in 

employing near-infrared (NIR) radiation as a trigger to activate delivery of encapsulated material from 

LbL systems [96]. The use of NIR light is particularly attractive in biomedical applications because of 

the weak absorption of NIR radiation by most tissues. 

Photo-isomerizable monolayers applied to surfaces can also be used to control surface properties, such 

as wettability [97]. In this case, the water contact angle was found to be lower for the spiropyran-

modified surfaces after irradiation with UV light, when compared with the contact angle found for visible 

light. This was ascribed to the changes in the surface energy of the surfaces correlated to the switching 

of the surface-bound spiropyran molecules between polar, zwitterionic and nonpolar forms. 

4.3.2  Chemical stimuli 

4.3.2.1  pH 

“pH” has also been extensively studied in the biomedical field because this factor can be easily 

controlled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo conditions. It is well-known that there is a pH change 

along the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach (pH=1–3) to the intestine (pH=5–8) and chronic 

wounds and tumor tissue are also slightly acidic. So, for example, pH-responsive systems can be used 

for releasing drugs in the intestine in order to avoid their degradation in the environment of the 

stomach [8]. They have also been investigated for gene delivery and gene therapy. “pH”-responsive 

polymers contain ionizable groups that can accept and donate protons in response to a pH change. 

Examples of pH-responsive polymers are chitosan, alginate, hyaluronic acid, PAA, poly(ethyleneimine) 

(PEI), poly(N,N-dyakylamino ethylmethacrylates (PDAAEMA) and poly-lysine [98]. Grafting of pH-

responsive polymers has been used to confer pH-responsiveness to a surface. For example, chitosan 

was grafted onto the surface of PLLA/BG composites [99]. In an acidic medium, chitosan becomes 

positively charged due to the protonation of the free amine groups. The pH-responsive behavior of the 

PLLA/BG composites modified with chitosan was confirmed by contact angle measurements. After 

modification, the contact angle changed from 88.9±4.05º at pH 7.4 to 67.6±2.3º at pH 5.4. The 

unmodified PLLA/BG composites revealed a hydrophobic character, presenting a contact angle of 82º, 

independently of the pH. 

In LbL, the growth of polyelectrolyte-based coatings is dependent on pH [100,101]. For instance, for 

chitosan/alginate films, a value of 56 nm was obtained for the final thickness of the films built at a pH 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

150 

of 7.0 and 34 nm for the multilayers assembled at a pH of 5.5 [101]. When the charge density of the 

adsorbing species decreases (i.e., chitosan at a pH of 7.0), more polyelectrolyte chains are needed to 

overcompensate and invert the surface charge, explaining the higher thickness associated with the 

deposition of polymers at pH 7.0. Also, LbL coatings of polyelectrolytes respond intrinsically to pH. 

Multilayer films conceived with chitosan and ELRs were demonstrated to be pH-responsive [69]. At high 

pH values, the roughness of the substrates increased due to the triggering of the ELR self-assembly 

mechanism into aggregates, besides the variation of the internal electrostatic interactions. 

Micro- and nano-scale porosity can be introduced in LbL films by pH variations, thus allowing to control 

film permeability [102,103]. 

4.3.2.2  Ionic strength 

Polymers that contain ionizable groups are typically sensitive to ionic strength. In fact, due to the 

attractive Coulombic interactions between oppositely charged species, such polymers may be insoluble 

in deionized water but soluble in the presence of a determined oncentration of added electrolytes where 

the attractive charge/charge interactions are shielded, as higher ionic strength solutions reduce the 

range of electrostatic interactions [104]. So, changes in the ionic strength can lead to changes in the 

polymer solubility and, therefore, in the length of the deposited polymer chains. Ionic strength is also an 

important parameter that allows controlling film swelling. In the case poly-lysine/hyaluronic acid LbL 

films prepared at an ionic strength of 0.15 M in NaCl, reversible swelling and deswelling occurs when 

the ionic strength is cycled between 0.15 and 0.225 M [105]. Ionic strength has also been used to 

control the permeability of LbL films as ionic variations can introduce porosity [106]. 

4.3.3  Biochemical stimuli 

4.3.3.1  Antigens 

Antigen-antibody interactions have been also explored under the scope of stimuli-responsive surfaces. 

Such interactions are quite specific and associated with the complex immune responses that help 

recognize and neutralize foreign infection-causing objects in the body. 

Ai and co-workers [107] showed that platelets coated with anti-“immunoglobulin G” (IgG) multilayers 

could be targeted to IgG-coated surfaces. An antigen responsive membrane based on dextran grafted 

with both a fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antigen and anti-FITC IgC antibody was 

proposed by Zhang and co-workers [108]. When free sodium fluorescein was added to the membrane, 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

151 

antibody-antigen crosslinks were broken by competitive binding of the free antigen. The disruption of the 

crosslinks caused the reversible swelling of the membrane. So, such membranes could be used as 

gates for selective diffusion controlled by the presence of an antigen. 

4.3.3.2  Enzymes 

Bacteria located mainly in the colon produce reductive enzymes (e.g. azoreductase) or hydrolytic 

enzymes (e.g. glycosidases) capable of degrading various types of polysaccharides, such as pectin, 

chitosan, amylase/amylopectin, cyclodextrin and dextrin [109-111]. For example, polymer systems 

based on alginate/chitosan are responsive to chitosanase and azoaromatic bonds are sensitive to 

azoreductase [112,113]. Enzyme responsive polymers present the advantage of not requiring an 

external trigger for decomposing, exhibit high selectivity and work under mild conditions, although is not 

straightforward to determine the beginning of degradation. An interesting example regarding enzyme-

responsive surfaces are the ones developed by Todd and co-workers, which present cell adhesive 

arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences on-demand, that is, by enzymatic hydrolysis of inactive 

RGD containing precursors that carry cleavable steric blocking groups [114]. 

4.3.3.3  Glucose 

Glucose-responsive polymers can be specifically used in the controlled relase of insulin and for glucose 

sensing. Typically, glucose oxidase (GOX) is conjugated to a pH-sensitive polymer [115]. GOX oxidizes 

glucose to gluconic acid, inducing a pH change and the corresponding release of the insulin 

encapsulated in the pH-system. For example Imanashi and co-workers [116] grafted GOX-conjugated 

PAA onto a cellulose film. At neutral and high pH the PAA chains were extended due to the negative 

charged of the carboxylate groups, occluding the pores of the cellulose membrane. The gluconic acid 

that resulted from the addition of glucose led to a local pH decrease, protonation and subsequent 

collapse of the PAA chains, leading to the insulin release. 

4.3.4  Multiple responsive surfaces 

Smart surfaces that respond simultaneously to more than one stimulus could be particularly interesting 

regarding biomedical applications and could be used, for instance, to control in a more effective way 

drug release or cell response. Some representative works where this type of surfaces was developed will 

now be given. For example, dual responsive coatings of chitosan-graft-NIPAAm and alginate were 



Chapter 4. Stimuli-responsive surfaces for biomedical applications 

 

152 

built [70]. AFM analysis confirmed that PNIPAAm is able to reconform upon temperature swaps even 

when combined with other layers in a polyelectrolyte multilayer, demonstrating that the nano-

assemblies are thermo-responsive. In another work, a smart and stable polymer brush interface based 

on PNIPAAm, PAA and poly(NIPAAm-co-AA) was able to reversibly respond to temperature, ionic 

strength and pH, independently or simultaneously [117]. 

Thermo- and pH- sensitive films of poly(N,N -dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate)-poly(propylene oxide)-

poly(N,N -dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate)/PAA ((PD-PPO-PD)/PAA) were prepared by Tan and co-

workers [80]. These films present a thickness of 2150 nm at 6ºC and of 941 nm at 20ºC, when they 

were deposited from distilled water at pH 7. This volumetric transition does not occur any more when 

the same films were prepared from water at pH 4 because PPO already forms hydrogen bonds with 

PAA (mostly in the protonated, neutral form) which are not available any more for water molecules. 

Other interesting example of multi-responsive coatings are the PNIPAAm-co-AA copolymers sensitive to 

pH and temperature that were prepared by Xia and co-workers [75]. The combination of this dual 

stimuli-responsive coating combined with surface micro and nanostructure enabled the water contact 

angle (CA) of the surface to be controlled over a range of 150º. On a flat surface, however, the CA 

change was only 13º and 9.6º for a temperature range of 21–45ºC and a pH range of 2–11, 

respectively. 

4.4 Biomedical applications of smart surfaces 

4.4.1  Smart coatings for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and drug 

delivery applications 

Smart coatings can be used to control the properties of the surface of a substrate, such as an implant, 

by changing the surface chemistry, topography and/or hydrophobicity, and therefore modifying protein 

adsorption and cell adhesion. These coatings can be simultaneously used to release a drug or bioactive 

compound in a controlled way. Some representative examples of smart biomaterial coatings will now be 

presented. 

Protein adsorption on PNIPAAm coatings has been investigated by distinct authors, showing that 

adsorption is typically unfavorable below the LCST, being stronger above the LCST [118-120]. For some 

proteins and some conditions, protein adsorption might become irreversible, inhibiting repeated 

switching. It was found that protein adsorption reversibility on PNIPAAm coatings depends whether the

phase transition back to the hydrated protein resistant state is energetically more favorable than the 

interactions formed between chains and the protein in the collapsed state [119]. 

Several studies have focused on the influence of the LbL film composition on protein 

adsorption [121,122]. For instance, the adsorption of human serum albumin (HSA) onto 

chitosan/alginate multilayer assemblies was assessed in situ using QCM-D [123]. It was found that the 

behavior of human serum albumin (HAS) on biomaterials surface can be tuned by adjusting parameters 

of the polyelectrolyte system such as pH, layer number, crosslinker and polymer terminal layer. The key 

role of electrostatic interactions during HSA adsorption was evidenced in that work, since oppositely 

charged surfaces were more effective in promoting protein adhesion. Also, novel protein-based systems 

have been developed by self-assembly, introducing the possibility to prepare, in a controllable way, thin 

reservoirs of proteins [124] and, by embedding biologically active proteins, film functionalization can be 

achieved [125]. The LbL approach has enabled protein encapsulation to release active proteins in a 

way that is applicable to objects of any desired geometry and size scale [126]. Moreover, microcapsules 

with a hierarchical shell-within-shell structure of different proteins entrapped in polymeric layers have 

been developed [127]. 

In the field of active molecule release, it is also very interesting to develop LbL films in which one of the 

components hydrolyses above a critical pH value leading to film erosion and release of the active 

molecule. This concept has been used for the pH triggered release of anionic polysaccharides and of 

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from poly-(?-amino ester)-DNA films [67,128]. The decomposition or 

release of active compounds can also occur through enzymatic hydrolysis [129]. For example, DNA and 

non-activated DNAase were co-encapsulated in hollow polyelectrolyte capsules. The enzyme can be 

activated by a chemical trigger which diffuses through the polyelectrolyte membrane, activating the 

enzyme, the subsequent hydrolysis of DNA and the diffusion of small oligonucleotides through the 

capsule wall [130]. LbL can also be used to coat inorganic microspheres to conceive smart 

microreservoirs. Huang and Chang [131] developed multilayer microcapsules made of azido- and 

acetylene-functionalized PNIPAAm that shrunk upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 50ºC 

(Figure 4.3). These microcapsules were also permeable to low-molecular weight substances, such as 

dextran.

There are many other interesting examples related with the field of active molecule release. For 

instance, pH-responsive polymers may be used to deliver fragile biomolecules such as peptides or 

oligonucleotides to the cytoplasm of macrophages, as the work of Murthy and co-workers 

evidenced [132]. They used pH cleavable acetal linkages to remove poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafts 

that mask the delivery vehicle and disrupt the endosome causing the delivery of biomolecules into the 

cytoplasm before they are degraded in the lysosomes. PNIPAAm/-co-AA microgels/polyallylamine 

coatings retained their thermo-responsiveness within the multilayer and allowed their use for thermally 

triggered release of insulin [133]. An antimicrobial coating that can simultaneously discourage bacteria 

attachment to the implant surface and release, in a tuneable dosage and rate, antibiotics into the 

surrounding tissues has also been developed [134]. 

Regarding the use of smart surfaces to control cell response, several works can also be found in 

literature. For example, Picart et al. [135] investigated the effect of grafting an RGD peptide onto distinct 

LbL films on the adhesion of primary cells, and observed an enhanced cell proliferation for the 

functionalized films. Boura et al. [136] evaluated the adhesion properties of endothelial cell on two 

types of polyelectrolyte films ending either by polylysine, or poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and 

compared them to data obtained on polylysine  or PAH monolayers, glass and fibronectin-coated glass. 

They found that the cells seeded on the LbL films showed a good morphology and resisted to 

physiological shear stress better, when compared to the cell seeded on glass or fibronectin. 

Photo-responsive layers composed of made of PNIPAAm and spiropyrans have been used to tailor cell 

adhesion by switching light on or off [95]. Cell adhesion has also been photo-chemically controlled

using RGD-functionalized azobenzene poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces [137]. It was found 

that azobenzenes enhanced cell adhesion but, upon UV-irradiation-induced trans -cis isomerization, 

which shortened the distance of the RGD-containing peptides from the surface, cell adhesion decreased. 

Nakanishi et al. [138] built self-assembled monolayers having photo-cleavable 2-nitrobenzyl groups that 

could be used to template cell adhesion. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), inert to cell adhesion, was 

adsorbed over this monolayer. Upon exposing defined regions with UV light, BSA was released from 

such regions. Finally, fibronectin, a protein promoting cell adhesion, was then incubated and covered 

the irradiated regions. This method allowed producing patterned regions for cell adhesions and by 

subsequent illumination it could be also possible to induce cell migration and proliferation. 

4.4.2  Smart biomineralization 

In medical devices for orthopaedic applications, either under traditional replacement concepts or 

regeneration strategies, such as tissue engineering, it is important to promote the production of 

bonelike apatite onto the biomaterial’s surface. It has been shown that surface biomimetic 

mineralization may be triggered by either temperature or pH [74,99]. For PNIPAAm modified composite 

PLLA film with 10% BG, it was found that the conformational changes occurring at the surface affect the 

mineral formation below and above the LCST [74]. No mineral phase could be observed at 25ºC after 2 

weeks in simulated body fluid (SBF). However, at 37ºC the treated film could form dense precipitates 

with the typical cauliflower morphology, containing needle-like nanometric structures, characteristic of 

biomimetic-formed apatite. Moreover, by exposing some regions of the surface to the plasma treatment, 

a patterning could be made to combine stimuli and spatial control of biomimetic apatite [74]. This 

allowed the insertion of PNIPAAm in specific chosen areas. Again, no apatite formation was observed 

for these modified films at 25ºC. On the other hand, apatite aggregates were formed at 37ºC, with a 

circular shape and randomly distributed over the composite surface, being consistent with the 

PNIPAAm patterning generated during the plasma activation step. These apatite patterned surfaces 

could be used in fundamental studies on differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and cell-cell signaling of 

bone-related cells. These surfaces could also be used in fundamental co-culture studies involving bone 

cells and other cell types [139,140]. 

For chitosan-modified PLLA/BG composites no apatite formation was found at pH 5.4 [99]. On the 

other hand, a dense apatite layer of a carbonated apatite mineral similar to the major mineral 

component of vertebrate bone tissue was formed at pH 7.4. For the unmodified substrates an apatite

layer was formed at both pH. Temperature and pH were chosen in the above mentioned works, but this 

concept of smart apatite formation can be extended for other source of responsiveness and for other 

type of mineral deposition. 

4.4.3  Cell sheet engineering 

The use of smart surfaces, specifically thermo-responsive surfaces, has been applied to the so-called 

“cell sheet engineering”. This technology has been proposed to construct ideal transplantable tissues 

composed exclusively of cells [141]. Initially, Okano and co-workers proposed temperature-responsive 

cell culture polystyrene substrates prepared by the grafting of PNIPAAm onto these surfaces, which 

allow the culture of confluent cell monolayers at 37?C and their recovery as single cell sheets when the 

temperature is below the LCST of PNIPAAm. Afterwards, they have combined these smart surfaces with 

patterning, with the aim of producing complicated three-dimensional tissues [142-145]. For instance, 

micropatterned dual thermo-responsive surfaces that enable the culture and recovery of patterned 

heterotopic cell sheets were proposed [142,143]. 

Okano and co-workers have shown that it is possible to obtain cell sheet constructs with five layers, 

where the viability of the transferred cells and the adequate organization of the functional cell-cell 

junctions were demonstrated [144]. Direct transplantations of cell sheets have been already 

successfully applied to corneal epithelia, mucosal epithelia, periodontal ligament cells, bladder epithelia 

and esophageal epithelia [141]. Cell sheets have also been layered in order to successfully recreate 

thicker tissue-like constructs such as cardiac and more recently bone [146]. 

The LbL approach has also been explored as a potential alternative to the traditional grafting techniques 

employed for cell sheet engineering. It was shown that (chitosan-graft-NIPAAm)/alginate LbL films 

enabled the attachment and proliferation until confluence of cells at 37ºC and the spontaneous 

detachment of cell sheets along with their deposited extracellular matrix by simple temperature 

modulation (Figure 4.4) [70]. Thus, these multilayered thermo-responsive surfaces could potentially be 

used in cell sheet engineering. The mild conditions and the absence of harmful solvents, the simplicity 

of the method and the ability to modulate cellular adhesiveness by controlling the “nanometric” 

thickness of the coatings are some of the advantages of this novel strategy. A completely new strategy 

for cell culture focusing on the design of three-dimensional smart surfaces by supercritical fluid 

technology has also been recently proposed based on supercritical carbon dioxide [147]. This approach 

might overcome the limitations on cell expansion and harvesting of currently existing techniques.

4.5 Conclusions 

The latest advancements in healthcare have emphasized the need to develop dynamic devices that can 

adjust themselves to a specific situation. Although many of these concepts are still under development 

in the lab bench, substrates modified with stimuli-responsive properties have already been proposed for 

controlling the adhesion of cells or proteins, microfluidics and biosensors. 

From the literature, it is clear that such advances are owed to the variety of methods that one can use 

to modify an interface and to the wide array of materials that can be used to build it. Thus substrates 

that respond to distinct physical, chemical and biochemical stimuli can be made with potential for new 

cutting-edge applications in biology and biotechnology. In the next decade, we expect to assist to the 

rise of dynamic smart systems with new designs and complexity moving further into the third dimension. 

Switchable surfaces exhibiting alternating biological active signals will be used to develop new cell 

culture protocols. Substrates with dynamic molecular conformation upon the contact with a specific 

biochemical agent will be used as biosensors for rapid diagnostic. Stimuli-responsive interfaces built 

onto drug reservoirs will be further optimized to tune and control better the release of encapsulated 

therapeutic molecules. With such nature, smart surfaces offer opportunities for a wide array of 

applications in medicine and tissue engineering where an interface with switchable properties is needed.

 Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

Many of the materials used in this thesis – both polymeric constituents and reactives – were either 

purchased or obtained by biological processes. The detailed specifications of the suppliers can be found 

in the experimental subsections of each chapter of Section III. Likewise, equipment suppliers are also 

discriminated in those subsections. 

5.1 Materials 

5.1.1 Polysaccharides 

Several polysaccharides were used for the conception of multiple layer-by-layer (LbL) constructs. 

Namely, chitosan (CHI) was used in every experimental work, throughout chapters 6 to 11. CHI is a 

biodegradable linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed N -D-glucosamine and N -

acetyl-D-glucosamine, linked by ?-(1-4) glycosidic bonds (Figure 5.1a). It is obtained by partial 

deacetylation of chitin – which is found in the exoskeleton of shellfish, like shrimp and crabs – in the 

solid state under strong alkaline conditions or by enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of a chitin 

deacetylase. In this process, named N - deacetylation, the acetyl functional groups of chitin are removed. 

Conventionally, the compound is called “chitosan” when the degree of deacetylation of chitin reaches 

about 50%. CHI undergoes a conformational transition in solution around a pH value of 6. Its amine 

groups, as is characteristic of polybases, are protonated at pH below the pKa and deprotonated at 

higher pH values [1-3]. 

Levan is a linear ?-(2-6)-linked fructose polymer (fructan) exhibiting hydroxyl groups that form strong 

adhesive bonds with various substrates (Figure 5.1b). This polymer – which was used along CHI in 

Chapter 6 – can be produced by almost every fructan synthesizers: one particular example is levan 

produced by extremophilic and halophilic bacteria Halomonas smyrnensis (Figure 5.2). They are found 

in highly saline environments to provide adhesion and protection. The fact that superior 

bioadhesiveness can be achieved under such harsh conditions points to the excellent adhesive 

properties that levan and its derivatives can provide. In comparison to petrochemically-derived 

adhesives, levan is biodegradable, biocompatible, nonallergic, nontoxic and water-soluble, useful 

properties for high-value biomedical applications [4-6]. 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

174 

Occasionally, alginate (ALG) was also used as a multilayer constituent, in Chapters 6, 7 and 11. ALG is 

a linear anionic copolymer composed of two monomers: ?-D-mannuronic acid, ?-L-guluronic acid 

(Figure 5.1c). It can be obtained from the cellular wall, accounting for up to 45% of the dry weight of 

these seaweeds. ALG has stimuli-responsiveness toward pH. The carboxylic acid groups from the 

guluronate and mannuronate monomers can be deprotonated above pH values of 3.2 and 4, 

respectively. Thus, alginate behaves as polyacid and exhibits polyanionic behavior above these pKa 

values [7-10]. ALG and also CHI, which share a marine origin, both show biocompatibility, adhesiveness, 

nontoxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, fungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic activities [10-12]. These 

properties make of these polysaccharides suitable constituents for multilayer formulations that resort to 

natural materials.

All materials used in the present thesis were bought from specialized commercial distributors. Among 

the purchased materials were CHI and ALG: medium molecular weight chitosan (Brookshield viscosity 

200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae (molecular 

weight 100-200 kDa). The sodium salt group enabled ALG to solubilize in water more easily, in 

comparison to its unmodified form. Levan was obtained by biological processes, as described below. 

Chitosan as-received often contains impurities and debris resulting from the deacetylation process of 

chitin and requires a purification procedure. Purification of CHI exploits the fact that it undergoes a 

conformational transition in solution around a pH value around 6, making it soluble below this value 

and precipitate above it. For purification a method described by Signini and Filho [13] was adapted. A 

CHI solution at 1% (w/v) using acetic acid at 1% (v/v) as solvent was prepared. The solution was 

vacuum-filtered twice through filter papers with 20–25 ?m of pore size, to remove impurities. The 

filtered solution was neutralized using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at a molar concentration of 1 M and 

was added drop-wise until pH was 8. The precipitated chitosan was then repeatedly rinsed in distilled 

water until the pH of the residual waters meets the same value of distilled water (around pH 7). CHI 

was rinsed with ethanol, vacuum-filtered and stored at -80 ºC before being lyophilized. 

5.1.1.1 Microbial levan production 

For Chapter 6, levan was produced by halophilic Halomonas smyrnensis AAD6T batch cultures using 

pretreated sugar beet molasses as substrate. For this, molasses subjected to tricalcium phosphate, 

sulphuric acid and activated carbon pre-treatment was added to sterile production medium (7 g?L

 final carbohydrate concentration and after inoculation, 

cells were incubated in an orbital shaker set at 37ºC and 180 rotations per minute (rpm) agitation rate. 

Afterwards, cells from the stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 11000g for 20 

minutes and the supernatant phases were treated with an equal volume of ethanol, held at -18ºC 

overnight, and then centrifuged at 16000g and 4ºC for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge. The 

pellets were dissolved in hot distilled water, dialyzed against several runs of distilled water for 3 days 

and lyophilized. The typical results of this procedure is a levan polymer with a molar mass of at least 

1000 kDa [14].

5.1.1.2 Levan phosphonate modification 

Levan as-produced does not possess groups exhibiting electrostatic charge. For the purpose of 

producing multilayer films with CHI driven by electrostatic interactions, phosphonate groups were 

introduced in the structure of levan. This way, it was expected that the introduced groups provided 

negative charge for interaction with the polycationic CHI. For the production of phosphonated levan 

(Ph-levan), 4 g of levan was dissolved in 100 mL of pyridine by vigorously mixing on a magnetic stirrer 

for 48 hours at ambient conditions and then the solution was cooled down to 0ºC. In an ice bath, 4 mL 

of phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) was added slowly in a drop-wise manner to the well-stirred solution. 

After stirring for 30 min under ambient conditions, 100 mL of saturated sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) 

was added. The aqueous phase containing the modified polymer was separated and freed from pyridine, 

and then subjected to dialysis against distilled water for at least 4 consecutive days with frequent 

exchanges of the solvent (3–5 times per day). The polymer was freeze-dried and an overall recovery 

yield of about 50% was achieved. 

5.1.2 ELR expression and purification 

Elastin-like recombinamers are genetically-engineered polypeptides that can exhibit precise amino acid 

length and sequence, and stimuli-responsiveness toward external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, 

ionic strength, and some toward light. An exhaustive description of elastin-like macromolecules has 

already been provided in Section I, as Chapter 3. 

From Chapter 7 to Chapter 11, ELRs were used as one of the constituents of the multilayer films and 

coatings. Expression conditions and purification protocols were adapted from Meyer and Chilkoti [15] 

and Girotti et al. [16]. ELRs were obtained by the induced gene expression from a stock of recombinant 

Escherichia coli strains containing the desired expressing gene. This stock of recombinant bacteria had 

been previously obtained. The artificial nature of ELRs means that it is necessary to design and 

synthesize their genes de novo in order to obtain them. It is impossible to obtain a complete synthetic 

gene, through an approach involving genetic engineering. The repetitive structure of recombinamers 

implies that a monomer deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) segment or “monomeric gene” encoding a 

specific polypeptide sequence can be created and subsequently seamlessly joined independently of the 

presence of restriction sites in the target DNA to generate multimerized genes that express the whole 

recombinamer. Three strategies can be employed to obtain the polymeric genes. One is 

concatemerization method, a random, directional concatenation of the monomeric gene. This method 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods

allows multimeric genes with a defined distribution and discrete lengths to be obtained in a single 

cloning cycle. The other is the iterative-recursive method, which allows complete control of the size and 

distribution of the individual blocks that play central roles in formation of the supramolecular structures. 

Finally, recursive directional ligation (RDL), an alternative method in which DNA segments with two 

different restriction sites flanking the insert are joined in sequential steps, with the length of the ligated 

segments growing geometrically in each step (Figure 5.3) [17].

Nine distinct ELRs were produced, differing in their amino acid sequence, length and, in most cases, 

bioactivity. Table 5.1 lists the desired ELR sequences produced throughout this thesis. The acronyms 

were given in accordance to their specific amino acid sequence. Gene expression was induced in 12 L

of terrific broth medium (TB) with 0.1% of carbenicilin and 0.1% of glucose, under controlled conditions 

of temperature (37ºC) and pH (7.00). The fermentation was stopped after registering an optical density 

variation at 600 nm inferior to 0.25, within 1 h. Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested 

by centrifugation, resuspended and lysed by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by 

centrifugation and the cleared lysate was subjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations, 

of 4 and 40ºC, respectively. All the purification steps were carried out in a sodium chloride (NaCl) 

solution at 0.5 M. The polymer in solution was then frozen at -24ºC and freeze-dried.

All ELRs exhibited groups that could undergo protonation and exhibit electrostatic charge, except for 

V84. This polypeptide was submitted further to a chemical modification to neutralize its three lysines (K), 

in order to use a neutral ELR in LbL formulations. For that, V84 was modified by amidation of the 

?-amine group of the biopolymer with pentynoic anhydride as an acylating agent. The reaction was 

performed in trifluoroethanol (TFE) with 10 equivalents of pentynoic anhydride per ?-amine group and 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

179 

1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC; 5 equivalents) as catalyst. Pentynoic anhydride 

was synthesized previously from pentynoic acid in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl 

ether in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days at room 

temperature. After this time, the functionalized polymer was precipitated into increasing fractions of 

diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 24 h. Once dry, the modified V84 

was solubilized in cold water and the crude product purified by exhaustive dialysis against water, then 

frozen and finally freeze-dried. 

5.1.3 Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles 

For the purpose of constructing LbL-based systems with magnetic response in Chapter 11, magnetic 

nanoparticles (MNPs) were first synthesized. MNPs are structures susceptible to magnetic fields, often 

used to enhance medical imaging diagnosis of soft tissues (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and 

temperature-mediated treatments such as hyperthermia and tissue ablation [19-21]. Their magnetic 

responsiveness also allows spatial mobilization/immobilization dependent on the application of a 

magnetic field on demand. In a typical synthesis of spherical iron oxide MNPs, 10 mL of a solution 

containing 1.2 g of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3?6H2O) and 0.6 g of iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate 

(FeCl2?4H2O) was added drop-wise to 25 mL of ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, made of 33% 

ammonia, NH3, in H2O) over 4 h under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The products of the reaction 

were collected by magnetic separation and washed three times with ethanol and water. The last 

washing step was made with ethanol, after which the products were left to dry at room temperature. 

5.2 Characterization of the materials 

Many characterization techniques were specific for each of the materials used: CHI, Ph-levan, ELRs and 

MNPs. 

5.2.1 Degree of deacetylation of chitosan 

After the purification of CHI – which was recurrently used in every experimental work – it was necessary 

to determine the precise degree of deacetylation (DD) of the obtained stock. For that purpose, 

hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (
1
H-NMR) spectra were recorded for a sample of purified CHI. 

NMR is a common technique used to determine the structure of unknown organic structures, by 

applying a nuclear magnetic resonance with respect to hydrogen-1 nuclei within the molecules of a 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

180 

substance. Among other things, it allows determining the number of protons in a molecule, different 

types of hydrogen atoms (e.g., protons bonded to carbon atoms that are attached to different functional 

groups), and the number of “neighbor” hydrogen atoms a proton has [22]. Thus, 10 mg of chitosan 

was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and 20 µL of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl) to 

form a viscous solution. An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube and the spectrum 

recorded at 60ºC. The calculation of the DD, in percentage (%), was based on the report of Hirai, Odani 

and Nakajima [23] and is presented in equation 5.1:

hydrogen atom is identified from 1 to 6. 

5.2.2 Phosphonate-levan modification assessment 

To assess if the modification of levan into Ph-levan was successful in Chapter 6, two techniques were 

used: energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, for the elemental analysis of phosphorous, and 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, by comparing both modified and unmodified levan samples 

within wavelength values of 400–4000 cm
-1

. EDS is performed using a scanning electron microscope 

(SEM) which, besides the morphology and surface of a sample, allows determining its elemental 

composition. When the electron beam bombards a sample, X-rays are produced as a result of the 

ionization of an atom by high-energy radiation. Consequently, an inner shell electron is removed. To 

return an ionized atom to its ground state, an electron from a higher energy outer shell fills the vacant 

inner shell and, in the process, releases an amount of energy equal to the potential energy difference 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

181 

between the two shells. The excess energy is unique for every atomic transition and allows determining 

the atomic element in analysis [24]. In FTIR, infrared radiation passes through a sample: some of this 

radiation is absorbed by the sample some of it is transmitted through. The detected infrared spectrum 

is the result of transitions between vibrational energy states, which can range from simple coupled 

motion of two atoms in a diatomic molecule to a more complex atomic motion in a large polyfunctional 

molecule. Thus, it is possible to detect functional groups, for instance, in a modified polymer by 

measuring characteristic absorption spectra, in respect to an unmodified sample [25]. 

5.2.3  Elastin-like recombinamers bioproduction assessment 

ELRs used throughout Chapters 7 to 11 were characterized following a multitude of techniques. To 

assess that the desired ELR was appropriately synthesized and produced, amino acid composition 

analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy 

were used. The amino acid composition was determined according to the AccQTag Waters method and 

the derivatized amino acids analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In general, 

an ideal derivatizing reagent must consist of an appropriate reactive group and a strong fluorophore. 

Typically, the protocol of the manufacturer requires the use of 6-aminoquinolyl-N -hydroxysuccinimidyl 

carbamate to react with primary and secondary amines to produce unsymmetrical urea derivatives that 

are highly fluorescent. Such conjugates can be separated in chromatographic columns and be detected 

sensitively using ultraviolet fluorescence detectors [26,27]. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used to 

determine the molecular weight of the produced ELRs. In MALDI-TOF, proteins are liberated in an 

ionized form from a target surface by firing a laser pulse at crystallized proteins. The ionized proteins 

are accelerated through a vacuum tube by an electrical field and reach a detector. Smaller proteins are 

accelerated to higher velocities than heavier proteins, and the “time-of-flight” is proportional to “m/z”. 

The charge “z” of ionized proteins is often 1, making the m/z value equal to the mass value [28]. 

5.2.4 Magnetization of MNPs 

Magnetic particles can be classified as ferromagnetic and paramagnetic/superparamagnetic. Whereas 

the former exhibit a permanent magnetic dipole moment, with a paramagnetic particle a magnetic 

dipole moment is induced only when an external magnetic field is applied [29-32]. The magnetization of 

the MNPs was therefore measured as a function of an applied external magnetic field. Typically, a 

vibrating sample magnetometer is used, which is capable of generating a magnetic field and detect the 

magnetization exhibited by a tested material. 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

182 

The shape and morphology of the magnetite nanoparticles were determined using high resolution 

transmission electronic microscope (TEM). TEM is a microscopy technique that detects a beam of 

electrons transmitted through a specimen. A microscope of this class is capable of imaging at a 

significantly higher resolution than conventional light microscopes, thus it was appropriate to observe 

such nanometric structures [33]. The samples were prepared by dropping a dilute aqueous solution 

(1 mg?mL
-1

) of the nanoparticles onto a 200-mesh copper grid and allowing the solvent to evaporate. 

5.2.5 Measurement of charges 

The charge exhibited by each polymer in aqueous solution was determined by the measurement of zeta 

(?)-potentials using laser Doppler electrophoresis. When a solid surface is in contact with an aqueous 

solution, the formation of an interfacial charge causes a rearrangement of the local free ions in the 

solution to produce a thin region of nonzero net charge density near the interface. The arrangement of 

the charges at the solid-liquid interface and the balancing counter-ions in the liquid is usually referred to 

as the electrical double layer. This region consists in a thin layer of counter-ions immediately next to the 

charged solid surface, called the compact layer, or Stern layer. The counter-ions in the compact layer 

are immobile due to the strong electrostatic attraction, while counter-ions outside the compact layer are 

mobile. This last part of the electrical double layer is called the diffuse layer. The ?-potential is the 

electrostatic potential at the boundary dividing the compact layer and the diffuse layer [34]. This 

potential may depend on the polymer concentration, pH and ionic strength. Thus, solutions of each 

polymeric material were prepared considering one of two situations: (i) the conditions that would be 

used afterwards for the construction of the LbL films and coatings, in an attempt to relate both charge 

and successful or unsuccessful multilayer construction, or (ii) the conditions in which the developed 

coatings are placed after their construction, to determine their behavior at, e.g., physiological conditions. 

Aqueous solutions of each ingredient were tested all the times at 25ºC, 0.15 M of sodium chloride 

(NaCl), with varying concentrations and pH values. Regarding (i) they were: 1 mg?mL

Ph-levan and CHI (Chapter 6); 100 ?g?mL

and CHI (Chapter 8); 100 ?g?mL

5.2.6 Temperature responsiveness of the polymers 

Differential scanning microscopy (DSC) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS) were used to evaluate the 

stimuli-responsiveness. DSC was used in Chapter 8 to determine the transition temperature of a sample 

of 3K-VRGDV. This technique measures the change of the difference in the heat flow rate to a sample 

and to a reference sample while they are subjected to a controlled temperature program. It provides 

direct, model-independent determinations of the transition properties, such as enthalpy, entropy, and 

transition temperature, and is an appropriate technique to study the inverse temperature transition of 

ELRs [35,36]. Experiments were performed with water solutions of 3K-VRGDV at 50 mg?mL
-1

 were 

prepared at pH 7.4. In a typical DSC run, 20 ?L of the solution were placed inside a standard 40 ?L 

aluminum pan hermetically sealed. The same volume of water was placed in the reference pan. All 

samples were equilibrated for 5 minutes at 5°C inside the sample chamber just before the beginning of 

each experiment. A heating rate of 5ºC?min
-1

 was used. 

Dynamic laser scattering (DLS) consists in the emission of a laser light over particles, emulsions or 

molecules dispersed or dissolved in a liquid. The interaction of this laser with the particles causes the 

light to be scattered at different intensities. The light intensity measured at the other end of the 

detectors in then interpreted and provides an estimation of the size of the samples dissolved or 

dispersed in solution [37]. It was used to determine the formation of polymeric aggregates in various 

solutions at various temperatures. In Chapter 9, 3K-VRGDV aggregate sizes were measured in the 

temperature range 25–37°C after stabilization for 5 minutes, to determine the transition temperature of 

the polypeptide. Samples were prepared at 300 µg?mL
-1

 in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.4). 

A total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to obtain a final average value at constant 

temperature. In Chapter 11, the reversibility of the temperature-induced phase transition of the same 

ELR-RGD was evaluated. For solutions prepared under the same conditions, measurements were 

performed first at 25ºC, then 37 ºC and finally back at 25ºC. A total of 20 runs were performed for 

each sample to obtain an average value at stabilized temperature. In the same chapter, ALG and CHI 

were also submitted to the same measurements, although CHI – due to this polybase’s pKa – had to be 

tested at pH 5.5. Nonetheless, it was not expected that temperature influenced significantly the 

response of CHI, regardless of the pH value.

5.3 Assessment of LbL films’ growth 

5.3.1 In situ monitoring 

In order to determine if a set of ingredients can be used to construct multilayer films and coatings, a 

quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used in Chapters 6, 7 and 8, a 

technique that is able to detect adsorbed surface density changes in the order of ng.cm
-2

 and measure 

the viscoelastic properties of the resulting surface in real time. In this technique, a sensor is composed 

of a thin AT-cut quartz disk sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Quartz allows exploiting the 

piezoelectric which makes it possible to convert an electric AC voltage across its electrodes into 

mechanical motion, exciting the quartz to oscillation at a fundamental frequency of 5 MHz. Therefore, 

the use of quartz sensors for QCM requires the use of “chips” that are coated by the electrode material, 

which can be one of a number of metals but being gold the one mostly used. An AT-cut quartz crystal 

can be excited at its fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and at several overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, 

corresponding respectively to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz, although different overtones can be 

monitored, depending on the equipment’s supplier. When a thin film is deposited onto the sensor 

crystal the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid, the decrease in frequency (?F) is 

proportional to the mass of the film. However, when using polymers, the adsorbed film is not rigid and 

this relation is not valid. At the same time, monitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film’s 

viscoelastic properties. An increase in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous 

component and damping properties typical of “soft” polymeric LbL films. The dissipation values for a 

soft film are higher due to increased energy loss from the crystal, whereas smaller dissipation values 

are obtained for a rigid film. It is this dampening to the crystal’s oscillation that is registered as 

dissipation, ?D [38-42]. 

The adsorption of polymeric layers was studied onto gold-coated quartz crystals in situ, cleaned with 

acetone, absolute ethanol and 2-propanol prior to the experiments. The quartz crystals were excited at 

multiple overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. For all monitoring experiments, adsorption took place at 

25ºC, using solutions at 0.15 M NaCl. Each multilayer constituent was flushed sequentially to the inside 

of the chamber where the sensor was immobilized at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min
-1

, being each 

adsorption step separated by a 10-minute intermediate rinsing step with 0.15 M NaCl, as depicted in 

Figure 5.5.

 for CHI/ELR and ELR/ALG films 

(Chapter 7), being CHI and ALG always adsorbed first and second, respectively. Except for the latter 

chapter, the frequency of each overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the 

quartz crystal, by dividing it by ? (where ? is the number of the overtone). In the specific case of 

Chapter 7 – Appendix, CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock films (herein designated as HAP3 and 

H3A20H3, respectively) were assembled at a pH value of 4.5, with the rest of the solution parameters 

being similar to the ones in the main chapter. 

5.3.2 Estimation of films’ thicknesses 

The Voigt-based viscoelastic model was used to estimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D 

monitoring data. The obtained frequency and dissipation values were converted to their estimated 

thickness using the Voigt-based viscoelastic model [43], which is integrated into the QTools software 

from Q-Sense (supplier of the equipment), based on equations 5.2 and 5.3:

Iterations of the model were performed using at least three overtones. The model requires three 

parameters, namely solvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity

was therefore fixed at 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and the film density at 1200 kg.m
-3

 (often assumed 

to return the lowest calculation error) [44-46]. The solvent density was varied by trial and error until the 

total error, ?
2
, was minimized. The solvent density values that allowed obtaining the minimum error was 

determined to be within 1000–1015 kg?m
-3

 for levan-based films (Chapter 6) and 1000–1060 kg?m
-3

 

for ELR-based films (Chapters 7 and 8). The area density, a rough approximation of the mass adsorbed 

on top of a gold-coated quartz sensor was calculated by multiplying the thickness by the films density 

(1200 kg.m
-3

). 

5.4 Assembly and characterization of multilayer films 

5.4.1 In planar substrates 

After determining if a set of constituents provided a favorable multilayer construction, they were 

reproduced outside of the QCM-D. Hybrid multilayer films based on the diverse polymeric materials 

used herein were constructed by dipping alternately glass substrates into the polyelectrolyte solutions 

for 10 min, with an intermediate rinsing step of 5 (Chapter 6) or 10 min (Chapter 7 - Appendix and 

Chapter 8) in NaCl 0.15 M. In similarity to most metallic alloys, glass is negatively charged, and thus 

provided support for the formation of a multilayer coating by adsorbing CHI as a polycation primer 

layer [47]. 

In Chapter 6, fresh CHI and Ph-levan polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared (1 mg?mL
-1

, 0.15 M NaCl, 

pH 5.5). Commercial glass from a local store were acquired and cut into 100×20 mm
2
 slides and 

cleaned thoroughly by immersion in a sequence of absolute ethanol, 2-propanol and chromosulfuric 

acid for 24 h. The construction was assisted by an in-house developed dipping robot that allowed the 

automated assembly of each layer in a programmed manner. The construction proceeded until 100 

layers (50 bilayers) were adsorbed. Films consisting of CHI and ALG were produced in parallel under 

the same experimental conditions for control purposes. In Chapter 7 – Appendix, films of CHI and 

either HAP3 or H3A20H3 were assembled onto glass pieces (1 cm
2
). The number of CHI/HAP3 and 

CHI/ H3A20H3 bilayers assembled was defined based on the results from the QCM-D screening stage. 

In Chapter 8, five pairs of CHI and ELR-RGD were prepared by manual dipping at the surface of regular 

glass microscopy slides cut into 1 cm
2
 pieces after undergoing a cleaning stage with acetone, absolute 

ethanol and 2-propanol.

5.4.1.1 Adhesiveness of the films 

In Chapter 6, the adhesiveness of “Ph-levan”-based films was studied by measuring the lap shear 

adhesive strength between two individual films. This technique determines the force that causes an 

adhesive to slide on a surface in the direction parallel to the plan of contact [48], as depicted in Figure 

5.6.

Figure 5.6. Experimental setup for the measurement of the lap shear adhesive strength. 

 

As soon as the construction of the films was concluded, two coated glass slides were put in contact 

face-to-face with an overlapping area of 20×10 mm
2
. To promote better adhesion, a weight of 6 kg was 

applied perpendicularly to the joint area and after a curing time of 24 h, the weight was removed. The 

bonded glass slides were placed in a universal mechanical testing machine according to the ASTM 

D1002-05 standard method and fixed by one binder grip in each extremity. A crosshead speed of 

5 mm?min
-1

 was employed and the samples were stressed until enough force was applied to trigger 

their detachment and pull them apart. The same setup was used to evaluate the adhesiveness of 

CHI/ALG films for the purpose of comparison. The lap shear bonding strength was then determined 

from the maximum of the force-deformation curve obtained. The average and standard deviations were 

determined using the results from five bonded substrates. Values reported reflect means±standard 

deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were 

considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. 

5.4.1.2 Contact angle measurements 

The wettability of a surface can be quantified by the measurement of contact angles. The contact angle 

of a liquid drop on a solid surface is the angle at which a liquid/vapor interface meets a solid surface. It 

is defined by the mechanical equilibrium of the drop under the action of three interfacial tensions and 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

188 

allows quantifying the wettability of a solid surface by a liquid via the Young equation. Surfaces with high 

energy typically exhibit a low contact angle, whereas hydrophobic surfaces exhibit low surface 

energy [49].   

In Chapter 7 – Appendix, PBS-contact angles were measured for coatings of CHI/HAP3 and 

CHI/H3A20H3 at 4 and 50ºC. The number of layers was defined based on the results from the QCM-D. 

The coatings were immersed in PBS placed under each temperature condition. After periods of 10 min 

of immersion in each temperature condition, the samples were withdrawn and contact angles were 

measured. If wettability did not change significantly, the samples were placed in immersion for an 

additional period of 10 min at the same temperature. 

In Chapter 8, coatings up to 10 layers – 5 pairs of CHI and 3K-VRGDV – were characterized for their 

wettability for each layer assembled using the sessile drop method, at 37ºC and pH 7.4. These 

measurement conditions were chosen to simulate the behavior of the films under physiological 

conditions of temperature and pH for each assembled pH. An approach described by Park et al. [50] 

was used to measure contact angles dependent on several temperature, pH and ionic strength 

conditions: the samples were immersed in a beaker of PBS placed under each condition. After 1 hour, 

the samples were withdrawn and contact angles were measured (Figure 5.7). The time of 1 h was 

determined to be enough to have a stable surface. Therefore, measurements were performed for a pH 

range from 4 to 12, ionic strength from 0 to 1.5 M of NaCl, and three relevant temperatures: 25, 37 

and 50ºC. Upon determining the wettability transition parameters, three cycles were performed by 

changing the transition values above and below each transition value.

5.4.1.3 Surface topography 

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in LbL-coated glass slides cut into 

pieces of 1×1 cm
2
, in Chapter 7 – Appendix and Chapter 8, following a similar protocol to that of 

contact angle measurements, in both cases scanning an area of 1×1 µm
2
. This technique is a 

synthesis of the mechanical profilometer, using mechanical springs to sense forces, and the scanning 

tunneling microscopy (STM), using piezoelectric transducers for scanning. In force microscopy, a 

probing tip is attached to a cantilever-type spring. In response to the force between tip and sample, the 

cantilever is deflected. This deflection is then translated into a visual image [51]. 

In Chapter 8, 5 pairs of CHI/3K-VRGDV were immersed in PBS for 30 min. To assess the influence of 

pH in the coatings, the samples were immersed in PBS at two pH values: 7.4 and 11. To avoid the 

formation of crystals during the acquisition, the samples were immersed shortly in ultrapure water for 

removing excess of saline solution. The samples were then retrieved and introduced in the device. 

Values reported reflect means±standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed 

using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. 

In Chapter 7 – Appendix, CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock samples were immersed in PBS at room 

temperature and 50ºC and then retrieved and introduced in the device. “pH” was also analyzed, for 

values of 7.4 and 12. 

When a multilayer film is rough, viscous and/or thick, AFM may not be appropriate technique to scan 

its topography. In these cases, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) – a technique that allows observing 

the surface of an object by bombarding it with an electron beam – presents itself as a viable alternative. 

SEM was used in Chapter 6 to evaluate the topography of CHI/Ph-levan and CHI/ALG films. The 

surfaces to be observed were left to dry overnight at room temperature and sputtered with gold prior to 

SEM observations. 

5.4.2 In three dimensional substrates 

5.4.2.1 Preparation of spherical microparticle templates 

Multilayer combinations made of CHI and 3K-VRGDV were extrapolated to the third dimension in the 

form of capsules. For this purpose, microparticles of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) served as spherical 

templates, which are easily obtained and provide a very simple three-dimensional structure to perform 

LbL. Microcapsules made of these constituents were constructed in Chapters 9, 10 and 11. Prior to the 

shell assembly, the template microparticles were produced. Typically, aqueous solutions of sodium 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

190 

carbonate (Na2CO3) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared at 1 M. Co-precipitation of both 

solutions was performed by adding a volume “V” of Na2CO3 followed by a volume “V” of CaCl2 to a 

variable volume of a precipitation medium/bath under rapid stirring for 30 seconds. The volume of the 

precipitation medium was of “2V” (Chapters 9 and 11) or “4V” (Chapter 10). Stirring was then stopped 

and the suspension of newly synthesized CaCO3 microparticles left to react and precipitate for 15 min. 

The supernatant was then removed and the particles washed twice or three times with ultrapure water 

to remove residual salts. 

The co-precipitation could occur in a precipitation medium that, besides water, contains an agent for 

encapsulation. The encapsulation is achieved due to the physical entrapment of such agent in the newly 

formed solid microparticles. In Chapter 9, a the entrapment of a “fluorescein isothiocyanate”-tagged 

bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) entrapment was achieved following the method described by 

She et al. [52], by preparing a precipitation medium with a FITC-BSA concentration of 5 mg?mL-1. In 

this work, SEM was used to evaluate the morphology of the sacrificial templates. Specimens were pre-

coated with a conductive layer of sputtered gold and micrographs recorded at 10 kV. In Chapter 10, 

DQ-ovalbumin was entrapped from a medium at 160 ?g?mL
-1

. DQ-ovalbumin is a protein chemically 

saturated with BODIPY dyes. The close proximity of the dye molecules causes a self-quenching 

mechanism characterized by the exhibition of red fluorescence. However, upon enzymatic degradation, 

their proximity is revoked and dye-labeled peptide fragments are released, exhibiting a fluorescence shift 

from red to green [53]. It is therefore an excellent agent that can be used to follow cellular uptake and 

intracellular traffic by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence emitted. Finally, in Chapter 11, a 

precipitation medium containing either rhodamine-B isothiocyanate or MNPs was prepared at 

500 ?g?mL
-1

 using the same method. 

5.4.2.2 Construction of the multilayer shells 

The templates – either doped or empty – were immersed alternately in CHI and 3K-VRGDV solutions 

(300 µg?mL
-1

, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of NaCl) for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5). 

Centrifugation was avoided to avoid damage and aggregation of the particles each time the samples 

were to be retrieved from solution; simple precipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). 

In Chapter 10, where the internalization by cells was to be studied, each adsorption step was followed 

by three washing steps with 0.15 M NaCl, pH 5.5, with the first being accompanied by 4 sequential 

ultra-sound pulses of 3 seconds each to disaggregate the substrates. This extra step was performed in 

order to ensure a more thorough washing, microcapsule separation and therefore avoiding major 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

191 

biological shock due to undesired residues and aggregation. This construction process was repeated to 

increase the number of bilayers until the desired coating had been obtained. In Chapter 9, the effect of 

the number of layers in the multilayer shell permeability was object of study, thus samples with 1, 3 

and 5 bilayers were constructed. In Chapters 10 and 11, the coatings were constructed with 2 and 3 

bilayers, respectively. After construction, three approaches were followed: (i) in Chapter 9, the CaCO3 

core was immediately dissolved with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.2 M, pH 5.5), which is a 

known chelating agent of metal ions, like calcium ions, and washed twice PBS; (ii) in Chapter 10, the 

microcapsules followed a washing procedure with EDTA (0.2 M, pH 7.4) and four with ultrapure water, 

with centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 25 min in between and ultrasound pulses timed as described above. 

Although centrifugation should ideally be avoided, the extra washing steps to which the microcapsules 

were submitted could lead to increased losses in microcapsules’ number. In the case of microcapsules 

intended for cellular contact rather than microscopic observations, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium 

(DMEM) was used for the washings instead of water. The result is a batch of hollow multilayer shells 

entrapping a desired agent inside. A schematic of this procedure can be found in Figure 5.8; (iii) in 

Chapter 11, the coated particles were left intact for the time being to be employed further in the 

construction of compartmentalized devices. 

5.4.2.3 Compartmentalized structures 

Following point (iii) of the previous paragraph, in Chapter 11 a 1% (w/v) solution of ALG was prepared. 

In a typical experiment, the (CHI/3K-VRGDV)3-coated microparticles were suspended in 1 mL of ALG 

solution and the resulting suspension extruded through a 25G needle, at a rate of 0.33 mL?min
-1

, into a 

0.75% (w/v) solution of CaCl2 under mild stirring. ALG beads containing coated microparticles were 

formed by calcium-mediated ionic gelation of alginate (Figure 5.9). The beads were coated with a 

Chi/ALG multilayer shell. They were immersed alternately in CHI and ALG solutions (300 µg?mL
-1

, pH 

5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M) and this 

process was repeated until three bilayers were assembled, (CHI/ALG)3. After the coating was 

assembled, the beads were immersed in EDTA. At this point, the CaCO3 sacrificial templates were 

chelated simultaneously with the liquefied alginate bead.

Liquefied alginate beads coated with (CHI/ALG)3 multilayers loaded with not only empty microcapsules 

and rhodamine in the ALG medium were also constructed. Rhodamine was suspended alongside 

microcapsules without any content and encapsulated in the ALG bead compartment instead of in the 

inner microcapsules. The mass of encapsulated rhodamine at this stage was determined by first 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

193 

calculating the construction losses resulting from the rhodamine-loaded microcapsules within the 

external alginate macrocapsule. 

5.4.2.4 Encapsulation losses and pre-loading efficiency 

It should be noted that for drug delivery studies in Chapters 9 and 11, described below, all 

supernatants were collected during the diverse construction stages of the multilayer microcapsules, 

from the synthesis of the sacrificial templates to the chelation stage. This was necessary in order to 

calculate the BSA or rhodamine losses during each construction stage and determine the pre-loading 

efficiency. 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into a white, opaque 96-well plate in triplicate. Distilled water 

was used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths used for the calibration curve 

and FITC-BSA mass calculations were 485 and 528 nm, respectively. All supernatants collected during 

entrapment, construction and chelation were measured and quantified. The percentage of FITC-BSA 

mass lost was plotted both for each stage and cumulatively. The encapsulation efficiency was 

calculated by subtracting the cumulative losses of each architecture (i.e., microcapsules with distinct 

number of layers) from the initial FITC-BSA mass. A similar approach was followed for rhodamine, for 

which the excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths were 530 and 590 nm, respectively. 

5.4.2.5 Microscopy evaluation of the structures 

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to evaluate the structure of the produced 

capsular microstructures. This is a technique that allows observing optical and fluorescence images 

with depth sensitivity, i.e., a sample can be scanned plane-by-plane in the z-axis. CHI/3K-VRGDV shells 

with 5 layers capped with a final layer of rhodamine B (assembled from a solution at 10
-6

 M) and 

encapsulating FITC-BSA (Chapter 9) or 3 layers encapsulating FITC (Chapter 11) were produced. In the 

first case, in the intent of evaluating morphological changes dependent on temperature, all samples 

were stabilized at either 25 or 37ºC and observed under hydrated conditions. In the second case, 

samples were observed only at 25ºC. 

The morphology of the produced microcapsules in Chapter 10 consisting in 2 bilayers of 

CHI/3K-VRGDV or CHI/3K-VRDG

V was determined using an environmental scanning electron 

microscopy (ESEM). With this technique, it is possible to observe a sample without a coating of 

sputtered gold.  A number of 2.2×10

 microcapsules suspended in 200 ?L of H2O was placed on top 

of a silicon wafer (1 cm
2
) and dried overnight at 37ºC before the analysis. The samples were placed 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

194 

inside the equipment in a platform with a 20º tilt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to 

obtain images of the multilayer coating. Prior to the observation, a number of 10
4
 microcapsules 

suspended in 60 ?L of H2O was pipetted onto a TEM grid and left to dry overnight at room temperature. 

TEM was also used in Chapter 11 to determine the distribution of MNPs within the microcapsules. Prior 

to the observation, a volume of 60 ?L of microcapsule suspension was pipetted onto a TEM grid and 

left to evaporate overnight. Both MNP-loaded and empty microcapsules were observed. Fluorescence 

microscopy was used to evaluate the morphology of the coated liquefied ALG beads. In contrast to 

CLSM, this technique scans the fluorescence exhibited by the surface. If translucid, the interior can also 

be observed. Based on this consideration, (CHI/ALG)3-coated liquefied beads were observed using 

transmitted light and fluorescence microscopy for rhodamine-loaded external compartments. The latter 

also containing FITC-loaded microcapsules were observed to assess the distribution of the 

subcompartments within the macrocapsules. 

5.5 In vitro release studies from three-dimensional capsules 

The microcapsules in Chapter 9 were resuspended in PBS at either 25 or 37°C. The upper limit of five 

bilayers for the microcapsule architecture was chosen to study the effect of temperature along with 

small changes in the number of different layers. This study was conducted over 14 days, removing the 

surrounding PBS from each container every 24 h. An additional sample was taken after 12 h from the 

start of the study. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, and 100% FITC-BSA was considered to be 

the total mass remaining in the microcapsules after their construction. The release experiments were 

performed under mild agitation to improve the diffusion of FITC-BSA through the incubating medium. All 

experiments were performed in triplicate (n=3), with each sample containing the number of capsules 

resulting from the attempted encapsulation of 1 mg of BSA. To determine the type of release profile for 

each condition, the release kinetics were determined using the Korsmeyer kinetic model (equation 5.4): 

n
Kt/M

t
M ?

?
 (5.4) 

where Mt /M? is the fraction of protein released at time t, K is the rate constant for the Korsmeyer 

model, and n is the exponent that characterizes the release mechanism [54]. The Korsmeyer model is 

used when the release mechanism from a swellable polymeric device is not well-known or when more 

than one type of release phenomenon could be involved. The latter was a possibility since the phase 

transition of these ELRs is a complex phenomenon, allied to a similarly complex hybrid and three-

dimensional shell. The fitting was performed for all architectures and for each temperature. As a means 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods

of comparison, fitting with other models was also made: zero-order (equation 5.5), first-order (equation 

5.6) and Higuchi (equation 5.7):

The compartmentalized systems from Chapter 11 were suspended in PBS at either 25 or 37ºC, with 

rhodamine being encapsulated in one of two hierarchical locations: the internal (CHI/3K-VRGDV)3 

microcapsules (with rhodamine added during the co-precipitation stage) or the external liquefied 

alginate (CHI/ALG)3-coated macrocapsules (with rhodamine added to the initial alginate solution). The 

study was conducted for 2 h to assess the early release profile in 3 mL of PBS, with 600 ?L of 

surrounding PBS being removed every 10 min and the container being refilled with the same volume of 

PBS pre-stabilized at the corresponding temperature. 100% of Rhod was considered to be the total 

mass remaining in the compartmental systems after taking construction losses into account. The 

studies were performed three times (n=3). 

5.6 Mechanical resistance of compartmental units 

A centrifugal rotation test was performed with the samples suspended in PBS to measure the 

mechanical resistance of the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules (Chapter 11). 100 samples were placed in 

centrifuge tubes and rotated at a starting centrifugal load of 500g. After 5 min, the number of intact 

beads was counted. Those that remained intact were submitted to incremental centrifugal loads (500g 

incremental steps) up to a maximum of 5000g. This experiment was performed three times. 

5.7 Magnetic responsiveness assays 

Macrocapsules containing MNP-loaded microcapsules were suspended in a PBS-filled square 

polystyrene Petri dish placed upon a 1×1 cm

 grid (Chapter 11). A 1.3 T permanent neodymium

196 

(NdFeB) bar magnet (diameter: 4 mm; length: 2.5 cm) was used to apply the external magnetic field. 

Ten samples were placed 3 cm away from the magnet, with the latter placed at a height of 1.4 cm from 

the PBS surface. The movement was recorded on video and the mean normalized distance traversed by 

the samples plotted as a function of time. 

5.8 In vitro biological studies 

5.8.1 Cell seeding 

The biological response of cells to biomaterials in vitro is critical to estimate if a harmful reaction is 

triggered upon contact of a newly developed system with a living organism, common when biomedical 

applications are envisaged. Herein, cells were either seeded onto a substrate modified with multilayers, 

or seeded first onto a cell culture support and incubated in the presence of microcapsules in 

suspension in the culture medium. 

In Chapter 6, L929 cells – a murine fibroblast cell line – were routinely cultured with DMEM 

supplemented with 3.7 g?L
-1

 sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% 

penicillin-streptomycin at pH 7.4. Cells were grown in 75 cm
2
 tissue culture flasks and incubated at 

37ºC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). Every 3–4 days fresh medium was 

added. At 90% of confluence, L929 cells were washed with PBS and subsequently detached by 

trypsin-EDTA at 37ºC. To inactivate the trypsin effect, cell culture medium was added. Cells were then 

centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the medium was decanted. A 50 µL cell suspension with 2×10
4
 

cells was added to glass slides with 1×1 cm
2
 modified with 50 (CHI/Ph-levan) or 50 (CHI/ALG) bilayers 

(in triplicate), previously sterilized by ultraviolet (UV)-radiation for 30 min. Surfaces were then incubated 

at 37ºC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% CO2 and after 4 h culture medium was added. The 

experiment was maintained for 24 h, after which the cellular adhesion was quantified. 

In Chapter 8, cell adhesion was studied using SaOs-2 cells – a human osteosarcoma cell line – 

envisaging the use of these coatings in orthopedic applications in order to improve host integration. Cell 

studies were performed onto coatings of 5 pairs of layers, ending in 3K-VRGDV, CHI or 3K-VRGD

V 

(negative control), assembled at the surface of glass coverslips with 1 cm in diameter. Tissue culture 

polystyrene (TCPS) was used as a positive control. Cell adhesion was studied using the SaOs-2 

osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line. Cells were seeded on the surfaces (5×10
4
 cell?mL

-1
) and 

incubated in serum free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), loaded with 1% 

antibiotics/antimicotics at 37ºC, 5% CO2. The substrates were analyzed at different time points: 4 h, 24 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

197 

h and 3 days. At each time point, cells on the coated surfaces were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 

formalin (3.7%). 

In Chapter 9, L929 cells were used for the biological assays. They were cultured in DMEM with phenol 

red supplemented with 10% of FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimicotic in a humidified atmosphere with 5% 

CO2 at 37°C. For the cell viability test, 2×10
3
 cells were seeded on 48-well plates and incubated at 

37°C, 5% CO2. After 24 hours, microcapsules were added to the culture medium in a ratio of 40 

microcapsules per cell. The incubation was maintained for 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days. 

In Chapter 10, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were used for the purpose of evaluation the 

cellular uptake of CHI/ELR microcapsules. Mesenchymal stem cells are hypoimmunogenic and 

pluripotent able to differentiate in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, into multiple cells types such as 

osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, neurocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes, and hematopoietic-

supporting stroma. The option to use hMSCs in this work a model of internalization of CHI/ELR 

microcapsules have the potential to be applied in transplantation, local implantation, gene therapy, drug 

delivery and stem cell differentiation [55,56]. “hMSCs” were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%

 and suspended in culture 

medium. Cell counts were evaluated using a standard Trypan Blue exclusion assay and seeded at

 on numerous circular cover glasses (diameter: 10 mm) and then incubated during 24 

hours in standard conditions. Afterwards, the culture medium was refreshed by serum-free medium 

containing CHI/ELR microcapsules, either functionalized with 3K-VRGDV or 3K-VRDG
(-)

V. After 3 h of 

CHI/ELR microcapsules co-incubation, the cultures were maintained for longer times (3 days and 10 

days), by supplementing the microcapsule suspension with additional fresh medium to reach the final 

serum concentration of 2% FBS. 

5.8.2 Staining of cells adhered to bidimensional surfaces 

In Chapters 6, 8 and 9, the cells adhered to the respective films were prepared for 4',6 diamidino-2-

phenylindol (DAPI) staining. DAPI stains preferentially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 

DNA-DAPI complexes emit strong blue fluorescence when excited by ultraviolet light so that even very 

small amounts of DNA [57]. After each cell culture time-point, the films seeded with L929 cells were 

prepared for DAPI fluorescence assay. Briefly, samples were washed with PBS and formalin (3.7–10% 

concentration range) was added to each well. After 15–30 min at 4ºC, formalin was removed and 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

198 

samples were washed with PBS. Then, a solution of PBS containing DAPI (1:1000) was added to each 

well and let to react for 5 min at room temperature and protected from light. Ultimately, samples were 

washed with PBS and visualized in the dark by fluorescence microscopy. For the specific case of 

Chapter 6, the nuclei were counted to quantify L929 cells adhered to CHI/Ph-levan and CHI/ALG films: 

adhered cells were assessed by analyzing fluorescence pictures in triplicate using the software ImageJ 

(provided by NIH). Values reported reflect means±standard deviation (SD) of three independent 

experiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant 

at p-value less than 0.05. 

Additionally, SaOs-2 (Chapter 8) and L929 (Chapter 9) cells were also stained with 

(tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-phalloidin (TRITC-phalloidin). Phalloidin binds tightly to 

polymerized actin filaments and, when conjugated with a fluorophore (like rhodamine), they can be 

observed under fluorescence microscopy [58]. After fixation, cells were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin 

(10 ?g?mL
-1

) for 45 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were observed under fluorescence 

microscopy. 

5.8.3 Cellular uptake of three dimensional microcapsules 

For the assays regarding the internalization of microcapsules in Chapter 10, hMSCs were seeded onto 

deposited in a 48-well plate and incubated during 24 h in standard conditions. (CHI/3K-VRGDV)2 and 

(CHI/3K-VRDG
(-)

V)2 microcapsules pre-loaded with DQ-ovalbumin were added to the culture. After 3 or 

72 h of incubation, samples were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) three 

times. Samples for microscopy analysis – confocal, phase-contrast, epifluorescence, and differential 

interference contrast (DIC) microscopy – were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized 

with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI following a similar protocol as described above. A 

confocal microscope was used for analyzing microcapsules inside the cells. Z-series were performed 

with a Z-step of 1 µm. The images of each fluorophore and phase contrast were overlaid to obtain a 

multilayer image using ImageJ software. Bright field and fluorescence microscopy were performed 

using blue, green and red fluorescence filters in order to determine the distribution and intracellular 

degradation of each multilayer microcapsule type. 

To quantify microcapsule internalization, 1.5×10
5
 hMSCs were seeded in a 25 cm

2
 flasks and cultured 

as described above. (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules were added at a 

microcapsule-to-cell ratio of 10:1 and incubated during 72 h. The cell cultures dissociated by 

Accutase
TM

 treatment – specially developed for gentle and effective cell dissociation – were washed, 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods 

 

199 

counted, suspended in DPBS, 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 5% 

FBS and analyzed in a flow cytometer. Flow cytometry is a technique for making rapid measurements 

on particles or cells as they flow in a fluid stream through a sensing point one by one. It is routinely 

employed in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering [59]. The assay 

was repeated three times. Values reported reflect means±standard error (SE) of three independent 

experiments. The influence of microcapsules/cell ratio on cell viability was analyzed using one-way 

analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of Bonferroni, considered to be statistically significant at 

p-value less than 0.05. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. 

5.8.4 Cell metabolism and viability 

In Chapter 8, to access cell viability, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-

sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay was performed. MTS and other tetrazolium dyes are 

bioreduced in cells by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, in its reduced form (NADH), in the cytosolic 

compartment. This reduced product can be detected for by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm, and 

is therefore directly proportional to the number of living cells in the substrates [60]. After each culturing 

period, samples were washed twice with PBS. A 250 ?L aliquot of FBS-free culture medium and 50 ?L 

of MTS reagent were added to each well. A cell-free well was used as control. Plates were incubated for 

3 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, protected from light. After incubation, 100 ?L of this solution was transferred to a 

96-well plate and the plate read using a microplate reader in 490 nm absorbance mode. In Chapter 9, 

for the cell viability test, 2×10
3
 L929 cells were seeded on 48-well plates and incubated at 37ºC, 5% 

CO2. After 24 h, microcapsules were added to the culture medium in a ratio of 40 microcapsules per 

cell. After each culturing period, the MTS method was performed as described above. In both chapters, 

values reported reflect means±standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments, and analyzed 

using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. 

In Chapter 10, metabolic activity was evaluated by Alamar Blue
®
 and cell viability by LIVE/DEAD

®
 

assays. Similarly to the MTS assay, Alamar Blue
®
 is reduced in living cells, after which it yields not only 

a colorimetric product but also a very strong fluorescent one, which can be more than ten times as 

sensitive as the colorimetric assay [61]. The relative number of hMSCs metabolically active within each 

experimental condition was evaluated by the Alamar Blue
®
 assay according to the manufacturer 

guidelines. 24 hours after cells seeding, cells culture was washed and then (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and 

(CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules in serum-free culture medium were added in incremental ratios of 5 

to 100 microcapsules per cell. After 3 and 72 h of microcapsules co-incubation, the fluorimetric 



Chapter 5. Materials and methods

reduction of 10% Alamar Blue
®
 reagent in culture medium was measured with a microtiter plate reader. 

Non-treated cells were employed as positive control and their fluorescence was considered as the 100% 

of cells viability. Values reported reflect means±standard error (SE) of four samples of four independent 

cell culture viability experiments at 3 or 72 hours of incubation. The influence of microcapsules/cell 

ratio on cell viability was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of 

Bonferroni. All treatment-related effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less 

than 0.05. All data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. 

The viability of cells co-incubated with CHI/ELR was also examined by a LIVE/DEAD
®
 assays. Ten 

microcapsules per cell of both CHI/ELR microcapsule types were added to the cell culture. The ratio of 

microcapsules per cell was selected after obtaining the results of the cell viability assays. In this assay, 

the co-incubation with calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 allows distinguishing the cytoplasm of live 

cells (with esterase cleavage of calcein accompanied by green fluorescence), and dead cells (which 

compromised membranes enable to stain nucleic acids with red fluorescence) [62]. LIVE/DEAD
®
 

assays was carried out at different time points (0, 72 and 240 h) according to the manufacturing 

specifications. 

5.8.5 Alkaline phosphatase assays 

The activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is evaluated using a p-nitrophenol assay. Paranitrophenyl 

phosphate, which is colorless, is hydrolysed by alkaline phosphatase at pH 10.5 and 37ºC to form free 

paranitrophenol, which is colored yellow. The expression of the enzyme ALP by osteoblasts, whether in 

a membrane form or in secretory form, is a characteristic of these cells and therefore its expression can 

be a strong indicator of these cells in culture [63]. For alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, samples 

collected on each time point were washed with PBS and immersed in 1 mL of ultra-pure water to lyse 

the cells. To each well of a 96-well plate were added 20 µL of sample plus 60 µL of substrate solution 

(0.2% (w/v) p-nytrophenyl (pNP) phosphate/1 M diethanolamine hydrochloric acid (HCl), at pH 9.8). 

The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 min at 37ºC. After the incubation period, 80 µl of a 

stop solution (2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/0.2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), was 

added to each well. The absorbance was then measured at 405 nm using p-nitrophenol as standard. 

For each experiment, a standard curve was constructed from reference suspensions at known cell 

concentrations. Values reported reflect means±standard deviation (SD) of three independent 

experiments, and analyzed using t-student test. All results were considered to be statistically significant 

at p-value less than 0.05.

Abstract 

Medical adhesives and sealants often require that long-term adhesiveness is achieved. In this work, 

nanostructured coatings consisting of chitosan and the adhesive bacterial exopolysaccharide levan are 

fabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. Taking advantage of the electrostatic self-assembly 

mechanism of LbL, the charges of both chitosan and a phosphonate-derivatized levan (Ph-levan) are 

measured and the feasibility to construct hybrid films is monitored and confirmed using a quartz crystal 

microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The adhesive properties between two identical 

bonded films with a total of 100 layers are compared to control films in which Ph-levan is replaced by 

alginate, revealing that the detachment force of the former is about 3 times higher than the control. 

Scanning electron microscopy of the films surface shows that the surface of Ph-levan films is smooth 

and homogeneous. Cell adhesion tests were conducted using a L929 cell line. Early cell adhesion is 

significantly higher in chitosan/Ph-levan films when compared to chitosan/alginate controls. These 

findings establish levan derivatives as bioinspired ingredients for conceiving medical adhesive devices 

that allow achieving enhanced mechanical and biological performance.

6.1 Introduction 

Wound healing, robust adhesion and protection towards external physical and pathological harm are 

essential characteristics of medical adhesives and sealants, especially when long-term performance of 

such devices is required [1-3]. However, many synthetic adhesives currently approved present 

limitations, which include poor adhesion in the presence of biological fluids, allergic response and 

inflammation [4]. Overcoming these shortcomings requires the use of materials that can provide 

sufficient cohesive strength and trigger adequate biological response to cells and tissues. 

Nature gives us a wealth of resources that can be exploited in biomedicine and tissue engineering 

applications. In contrast with synthetic materials, natural-based polymers are similar to biological 

macromolecules, avoiding triggering chronic or immunological reactions and toxicity [5]. 

Macromolecular compounds such as collagen, cellulose, and fibrin are used as ingredients for 

adhesives and sealants [4,6-8]. Namely, chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG) have been widely used in 

biomedical applications including burn dressings, drug delivery and implantation [9-11]. These two 

polysaccharides share a marine origin derived from materials existing in shells of crustaceans and in 

algae, respectively, and show biocompatibility, adhesiveness, non-toxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, 

fungistatic, antimicrobial and hemostatic activities [5,11]. 

While the sea is a good source of natural bioadhesive materials, it is possible to find interesting 

materials in other less conventional sources such as extremophilic environments. An elegant example is 

levan, a linear ?(2-6)-linked fructose polymer (fructan) exhibiting hydroxyl groups that form strong 

adhesive bonds with various substrates [12-14]. It has many advantages over petrochemically derived 

adhesives, including that it is biodegradable, biocompatible, non-allergic, non-toxic and water-soluble. 

Levan is also a bioactive polymer mainly associated with high-value biomedical applications [15,16] and 

has been credited together with xanthan, curdlan and pullulan as the most promising microbial 

exopolysaccharides for various industrial sectors [12]. Though microbial levan is produced 

extracellularly from sucrose-based substrates by various microorganisms, of special interest is the 

halophilic bacterium Halomonas smyrnensis sp. nov. AAD6T which was reported as the first 

extremophilic producer of levan [17,18]. Excreting high molecular weight levan by this halophile to a 

highly saline environment for adhesion and protection points to the superior bioadhesive properties of 

levan that were retained under such unusual conditions. Besides its potential use as a bioflocculating 

agent [19] and in drug nanocarrier systems [20], levan produced by Halomonas smyrnensis, as well as

applications

its aldehyde-activated derivative, were successfully deposited by matrix-assisted pulsed laser 

evaporation (MAPLE) resulting in uniform, homogeneous, nanostructured, biocompatible, thin films [14]. 

In light of the properties of levan, we intend to demonstrate that this exopolysaccharide can be used as 

a promising ingredient to conceive new adhesive devices for biomedical applications. 

Film casting and hot-melt extrusion are common techniques for manufacturing adhesive membranes, 

with the former being undoubtedly the most widely used [21]. However, the use of organic solvents in 

film casting and the addition of plasticizers in hot-melt extrusion are common concerns when 

considering the use of such membranes in biological environments. The layer-by-layer (LbL) sequential 

assembly of macromolecules is an approach with the potential to address these issues. LbL techniques 

are perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-apply of the numerous surface modification tools currently 

available as they are based on the spontaneous adsorption of ingredients – generally a polymer, 

biomolecule or inorganic particle – onto a substrate. For instance, the adsorption of charged 

macromolecules (polyelectrolytes) is driven by electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) between two ingredients 

and allows the sequential formation of a multilayer film [22-26]. Furthermore, this technique allows 

robust nanostructured coatings to be produced on substrates with complex geometries and, as it does 

away with the need for harmful organic solvents, it is of great interest in tissue engineering applications, 

such as biomimetic composite-like coatings, controlled drug release or manipulation of adhesion, 

differentiation, proliferation and even function of attached cells [25,27-29]. Because this technique is so 

versatile, it is possible to synthesize adhesive films by proper selection of its ingredients. 

The objective of this work is to demonstrate that a phosphonate-modified levan – henceforth referred to 

as Ph-levan – can be used in electrostatic LbL adsorption to construct nanostructured films with 

adhesive properties. For the proof-of-concept, Ph-levan and chitosan were sequentially assembled onto 

glass using an in-house developed dipping robot and their adhesiveness was studied by measuring the 

shear strength necessary for two adhered films to detach. Their cell adhesion properties were evaluated 

in vitro, as well as the surface morphology. We hypothesized that these nanostructured hybrid films 

could have superior adhesive properties when compared to similar films made of the commonly 

regarded adhesive polysaccharides CHI and ALG.

6.2 Experimental section 

6.2.1 Materials 

Medium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (ref. 448877, Brookshield 

viscosity 200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and purified by a series of filtering steps and 

precipitation in water and ethanol, followed by freeze-drying. Alginate – alginic acic sodium salt from 

brown algae – was purchased from Fluka (ref. 71238, molecular weight 100-200 kDa). 

Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), low glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), sodium 

bicarbonate and 4’,6-diaminidino-2-phenylindole-dilactate (DAPI, 20 mg?mL

) were purchased from 

Sigma-Aldrich. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin and trypsin- ethylenediamine 

tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution were purchased from Invitrogen. The immortalized mouse lung 

fibroblast cell line (L929) was purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. 

6.2.2 Microbial levan production 

Microbial levan production was performed with the halophilic Halomonas smyrnensis AAD6T batch 

cultures [18,30] using pretreated sugar beet molasses as substrate [31]. For this, molasses subjected 

to tricalcium phosphate, sulphuric acid and activated carbon pre-treatment was added to sterile 

production medium (7 g?L

concentration and after inoculation, cells were incubated in a Certomat BS-1 orbital shaker (B. Braun, 

Germany) set at 37ºC and 180 rotations per minute (rpm) agitation rate. For the purification of levan, 

cells from the stationary phase cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 11000g for 20 minutes and 

the supernatant phases were treated with an equal volume of ethanol, held at -18ºC overnight, and then 

centrifuged at 16000g and 4ºC for 30 min using a refrigerated centrifuge. The pellets were dissolved in 

hot distilled water, dialyzed against several runs of distilled water for 3 days and lyophilized. The 

resultant high molecular weight polymer has a molar mass of at least 1000 kDa [17].

6.2.3 Phosphonate modification of levan 

For the production of phosphonated levan, 4 g of levan was dissolved in 100 mL of pyridine by 

vigorously mixing on a magnetic stirrer for 48 hours at ambient conditions and then the solution was 

cooled down to 0ºC. In an ice bath, 4 mL of phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) was added slowly in a drop 

wise manner to the well-stirred solution. After stirring for 30 min under ambient conditions, 100 mL of 

saturated sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was added. The aqueous phase containing the modified polymer 

was separated and freed from pyridine and then subjected to dialysis against distilled water for at least 

four consecutive days with frequent exchanges of the solvent (3–5 times per day). The polymer was 

freeze-dried and an overall recovery yield of about 50% was achieved. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 

spectra of levan samples were obtained with Nicolet 6700 Spectrometer within (400–4000) cm
-1

. 

Elemental analysis of phosphorous was estimated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis 

performed on the JEOL JSM-5910 LV electron microscope. 

6.2.4 Measurement of charges 

The ?-potentials of the polysaccharides were determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United 

Kingdom), at 25ºC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient were used, at 1 mg?mL
-1

, 0.15 M NaCl and 

pH value of 5.5. 

6.2.5 Construction of hybrid self-assembled films 

A Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring system 

was used to monitor the adsorption of chitosan and phosphonated levan onto gold-coated quartz 

crystals in situ. The quartz-crystal was excited at multiple overtones: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, 

corresponding respectively to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz. Adsorption took place at 25ºC, using 

solutions at 1 mg?mL
-1

, 0.15 M NaCl and at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min
-1

, with an adsorption 

time of 10 min (starting with chitosan) and an intermediate rinsing step of 10 min. The frequency of 

each overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the quartz crystal, by dividing 

it by ? (where ? is the number of the overtone).

applications 

 

215 

6.2.6 Estimation of the films’ thicknesses 

The Voigt model contained in the software QTools from Q-Sense (version 3.0.15.553) was used to 

estimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D monitoring data. Iterations of the model were 

performed using at least 5
th

, 7
th

 and 9
th

 overtones. The model requires three parameters, namely 

solvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity was therefore fixed 

at 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and film density at 1200 kg?m
-3

. The solvent density was varied by trial 

and error between 1000 and 1015 kg?m
-3

 until the total error, ?
2
, was minimized. 

6.2.7 Preparation of hybrid multilayer films 

Fresh polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared by dissolution of chitosan and phosphonated levan in the 

same conditions as the ones prepared for the QCM-D. Commercial glass from a local store were 

acquired and cut into 100×20 mm
2
 slides. The slides were cleaned thoroughly by immersion in a 

sequence of absolute ethanol, 2-propanol and chromosulfuric acid for 24 h. Hybrid multilayer films of 

the two polysaccharides were constructed by dipping alternately the glass substrate into the 

polyelectrolyte solutions for 10 min, with an intermediate rinsing step of 5 min in NaCl 0.15 M. The 

construction was assisted by an in-house developed dipping robot that allowed the automated assembly 

of each layer in a programmed manner. The construction proceeded until 100 layers (50 bilayers) were 

adsorbed. Films consisting of chitosan and alginate were produced in parallel under the same 

experimental conditions for the purpose of comparison. 

6.2.8 Adhesiveness of the films 

As soon as the construction of the films was concluded, two glass slides were put in contact face-to-face 

with an overlapping area of 20×10 mm
2
. To promote better adhesion, a weight of 6 kg was applied 

perpendicularly to the joint area and after a curing time of 24 h, the weight was removed. The bonded 

glass slides were placed in a universal mechanical testing machine (Instron model 5540, USA) 

according to the ASTM D1002-05 standard method and fixed by one binder grip in each extremity. A 

crosshead speed of 5 mm?min
-1

 was employed and the samples were stressed until enough force was 

applied to trigger their detachment and pull them apart. The lap shear bonding strength was then 

determined from the maximum of the force-deformation curve obtained. The average and standard 

deviations were determined using the results from five bonded substrates.

6.2.9 In vitro cell culture 

L929 cells were routinely cultured with DMEM supplemented with 3.7 g?L
-1

 sodium bicarbonate, 10% 

FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at pH 7.4. Cells were grown in 75 cm
2
 tissue culture flasks and 

incubated at 37ºC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). Every 3–4 days fresh 

medium was added. At 90% of confluence, L929 cells were washed with PBS and subsequently 

detached by trypsin-EDTA at 37ºC. To inactivate the trypsin effect, cell culture medium was added. 

Cells were then centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the medium was decanted. Prior to cell seeding, 

the surfaces were sterilized by ultraviolet (UV)-radiation for 30 minutes. A 50 µL cell suspension with 

2×10
4
 cells was added to glass slides with 1×1 cm

2
 modified with 50 (CHI/Ph-levan) or 50 (CHI/ALG) 

bilayers (in triplicate). Surfaces were then incubated at 37ºC in a humidified air atmosphere of 5% CO2 

and after 4 h culture medium was added. 

6.2.10 Nuclei-staining fluorescence assay 

After 24 h of incubation, the film samples seeded with L929 cells were prepared for DAPI fluorescence 

assay. Briefly, samples were washed with PBS and 10% formalin was added to each well. After 30 min 

at 4ºC, formalin was removed and samples were washed with PBS. Then, a solution of PBS containing 

DAPI (1:1000) was added to each well and let to react for 5 min at room temperature and protected 

from light. Ultimately, samples were washed with PBS and visualized in the dark by fluorescence 

microscopy. DAPI stains preferentially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by delineating cells 

nuclei in blue. Adhered cells were assessed by analyzing fluorescence pictures in triplicate using the 

software ImageJ (NIH, version 1.46r). 

6.3 Results and Discussion 

Phosphorylation is a feasible method for modifying the dissolution properties and bioactivities of 

polysaccharides. Phosphorylated polysaccharides have found use in various applications as flame 

retardant additive, cation exchanger, thickener and binder for biomolecules [32-34]. As such, a wide 

range of potential applications were also proposed for phosphorylated derivatives of the levan 

polysaccharide [16]. Considering these facts and the limited literature on levan derivatives, Ph-levan has 

been chosen as a promising biopolymer and its suitability for the fabrication of adhesive multilayer

coatings has been investigated within the scope of this study. The protocol used to modify levan 

followed the reaction scheme is shown in Figure 6.1.

The obtained Ph-levan was then characterized by FTIR and EDS. In the FTIR spectrum (Figure 6.2), 

several stretching vibration bands were detected: the hydroxyl (OH) stretching vibration bands around 

3200 cm-1, two bands around 2900 cm-

 corresponding to carbon-hydrogen (C-H) stretching 

vibration of fructose residues, bands in the region of 1430 cm-1 that were assigned to C-H plan 

deformation vibration combined with aromatic skeletal vibrations, bands at 1120 cm
-1

 and 1000 cm
-1

 

that were dominated by the stretching vibrations of the glycosidic linkage contributions of C-O-C and C-

O-H, as well as the 920 cm
-1

 band resulting from the stretching vibration of pyran ring. These bands 

are all characteristic of levan polysaccharides reported earlier [31]. By comparison, in the FTIR 

spectrum of Ph-levan, more bands could be identified: a band at 2360 cm
-1

 corresponding to the P–H 

bond, another one at 1200 cm
-1

 corresponding to the P=O bond, a shoulder at 1045 cm
-1

 attributable 

to the P–OH bond and bands around 875 cm
-1

 corresponding to the P–O–C bonds [32-34]. 

EDS was performed to further evaluate the efficiency of the modification. From the spectrum in Figure 

6.3, a peak of phosphorus was detected and the EDS analysis resulted in an atomic ratio of 

C:O:P=44:51:3. Thus, both FTIR and EDS pointed towards the production of a Ph-levan stock to be 

used in the construction of the intended multilayer films.

Prior to the QCM-D study, the ?-potential of CHI and Ph-levan was measured, showing values of 

+16.8±0.8 mV and -13.1±0.3 mV, respectively. CHI is a well-known polycation due to the protonated 

state of amine groups in acidic conditions [3]. The negative charge of Ph-levan is possible thanks to the 

introduction of phosphonate groups to a macromolecule that is otherwise uncharged in nature.  This

219 

modification allows the reaction with CHI via electrostatic interactions. The ability of CHI and Ph-levan to 

adsorb in a sequential fashion by relying on ESA was monitored by QCM-D. This technique is able to 

detect mass changes in the order of nanograms per square centimeter and measure the viscoelastic 

properties of the resulting surface [35]. Figure 6.4A shows the normalized frequency, ?F?/? (where ? is 

the overtone) and dissipation (?D) variations for the 5
th

 overtone (25 MHz) after the construction up to 

6 layers onto gold-coated quartz sensors. During QCM-D, a favorable and successful construction is 

usually identified by a decrease in ?F caused by mass adsorption at the top of the sensor. The ?F?/? 

decreased upon flushing the substrate with the sequence of polyelectrolytes, due to the deposition of 

polymer on the surface of the crystal, to an approximate absolute value of 38 Hz. At the same time, 

monitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film’s viscoelastic properties. For instance, an 

increase in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous component and damping 

properties that characterize a “softer” film. As observed in Figure 6.4A, the ?D increased to around 

17×10
-6

. Therefore, the assembled multilayer film is not rigid and exhibits the typical viscoelastic 

behavior, a typical situation when using macromolecular systems.

The QCM-D data was used to estimate the thickness variations of the film with each adsorption cycle. 

Figure 6.4B shows how the thickness varied with each deposition cycle calculated using the Voigt 

model [36]. After the deposition of 6 layers, the film had a mean thickness of 50±7 nm, corresponding 

to an approximate total area density of 6.0±0.9 ?g.cm
-2

 (obtained by multiplying the thickness by the 

layer density, 1200 kg?m
-3

). The results obtained through QCM-D measurements demonstrate that 

Ph-levan can be used successfully with CHI to conceive a viscoelastic polymeric thin coating using the 

LbL approach. 

Afterwards, films of 50 bilayers were assembled onto glass slides – henceforth referred to as (CHI/Ph-

levan)50 – for the characterization of their surface and adhesive properties. For the sake of comparison, 

multilayer films consisting of 50 bilayers of CHI and ALG, (CHI/ALG)50, were also constructed and 

tested under the same experimental conditions. The formulation of this control film consists of well-

known adhesive materials which properties were compared with those of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 films. 

Additionally, it was seen before that this multilayer film can be easily assembled using the experimental 

parameters utilized in this work.[37,38] 

The surface of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 and (CHI/ALG)50 films was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM). Figure 6.5 demonstrates that the former presented a flat surface with few morphological 

features (Figure 6.5A) in comparison to the (CHI/ALG)50 control (Figure 6.5B). In both cases it is clear 

that the multilayer films completely coated the surface of the substrates.

It is noteworthy that the more flat surfaces are the ones exhibiting the best adhesive properties. For 

solid/viscoelastic contacts, it has been reported that if a surface – either the adhesive or the substrate 

– is rough, the contact between the two surfaces may be incomplete (i.e., the real contact area is lower 



Chapter 6. Adhesive nanostructured multilayer films using a bacterial exopolysaccharide for biomedical 

applications 

 

221 

than the apparent contact area) and evolve with contact time, leading to surfaces to unbind [39,40]. For 

elastic surfaces, surface roughness is also known to decrease adhesion [41]. The current work is a 

case of contact between viscoelastic surfaces, a known property of polymer-based multilayer films [35]. 

Fitting only partially on the described roughness/adhesiveness models, the roughness observed in 

Figure 6.5 may have little influence in the adhesion mechanism of these films which, due to their 

viscous nature, will depend mainly on the strong adhesive bonds formed by the hydroxyl groups. 

Most in vitro methods for screening the adhesiveness rely on the measurement of either tensile or 

shear strengths. The first usually tests the perpendicular force necessary to separate two surfaces, 

while the second determines the force that causes an adhesive to slide on a surface in the direction 

parallel to the plan of contact [42]. Although the first is the most commonly used, an adhesive or 

sealant in contact with a biological tissue is more prone to undergo shear stress than tensile, due to 

inherent muscular movements. In light of this, two glass slides bearing either (CHI/Ph-levan)50 or 

(CHI/ALG)50 hybrid films were overlapped as soon as the adsorption of the layers was concluded. After 

a cure of 24 h, the lap shear adhesive strength was tested. Figure 6.6 shows that the lap shear strength 

necessary to separate two (CHI/Ph-levan)50 films was 2.5±0.3 MPa. (CHI/ALG)50 films required a lap 

shear strength of 0.9±0.1 MPa until detachment was observed.

Also, notice that the shear modulus (estimated from the slope of the graphics in Figure 6.6A) of both

222 

multilayer films is similar, but the final displacement of (CHI/Ph-levan)50 is higher, giving rise to a 

higher adhesive strength compared with the control, (CHI/ALG)50. For clinical procedures, 

cyanoacrylates have been shown to provide a strong adhesiveness, appropriate for wound closure 

(around 68 kPa). Fibrin-based materials are weaker (around 13 kPa) are applied as sealants combined 

with suturing. Hydrogels and other polymer-based devices are also considered weak (ranging from 4 to 

17 kPa) and often used as topical wound dressings or as sealants when mechanical properties are of 

less concern [43]. Independent studies on adhesive and sealant products available in the market have 

been made. For instance, Tisseel
TM

 – a fibrin-based sealant – and Dermabond
TM

 – a cyanoacrylate-

based glue – showed shear adhesive strengths around 20 kPa [44] and 180 kPa [45], respectively. 

However, the authors used actual bovine tissues and not glass substrates, although other works 

describe experimental conditions similar to the presented herein. Yamada et al. [46] showed that the 

shear stress between two glass slides overlapped together with dopamine-modified chitosan was over 

400 kPa, while unmodified chitosan conferred no adhesive strength. Ishihara et al. [47] also developed 

a photocrosslinkable chitosan hydrogel with a shear adhesive strength around 3 kPa. (Ph-levan)-

containing multilayer coatings adhesives surpass these examples. In comparison with the product 

exhibiting the highest adhesive properties (dopamine-modified chitosan, 400 kPa) the lap shear 

strength is about 6 times higher. Thus, levan derivatives provide an enhanced adhesive character to 

these multilayer films that could be useful in applications where strong adhesiveness to a substrate is 

necessary. 

In order to understand how cells interact with films containing Ph-levan, the biological performance was 

evaluated in vitro using L929 cells. In biological applications, an adhesive film could be useful to readily 

provide fixation to a tissue either externally as a wound healing bandage or internally as a surgical 

sealant for tissues and organs. In order to study the early cell adhesion on (CHI/Ph-levan)50, we 

investigated the density of cells adhered onto the films after 24 h of culture and compared it to the 

(CHI/ALG)50 case. A noticeable difference could be observed: cells adhered mostly to (CHI/Ph-levan)50 

than to (CHI/ALG)50 (Figure 6.7).

Quantitatively, the mean cell area on the former was around 110 cells?mm

, a high value when 

compared to the latter, with only around 20 cells?mm
-2

. The results demonstrated that the biological 

process of L929 cells adhesion was sensitive to the incorporation of Ph-levan into the LbL surfaces. In 

order to optimize biomaterials/cellular interactions this effect is of great importance, since those 

interactions are based on cell surface receptor/substrate ligand binding, which influence different 

cellular responses. We believe that levan surfaces will lead to new findings in cell/materials interactions, 

contributing to promote and control specific cellular responses. 

6.4 Conclusions 

In this work, the feasibility to construct nanostructured multilayer films containing an exopolysaccharide 

from an unconventional source, namely from extremophile microorganisms, was demonstrated. Relying 

on electrostatic interactions, hybrid films containing this fructan along with chitosan were compared 

with a formulation of chitosan and alginate, two natural ingredients widely regarded as good adhesives: 

the incorporation Ph-levan led to the conception of films that required higher strength for detachment to 

occur due to shear stress. Furthermore, cells were sensitive to this polysaccharide and adhered in 

higher number. In the context of biomedical and tissue engineering, these films could provide enhanced 

adhesiveness and protection to a new generation of wound healing bandages or to surgical sealants 

and also surfaces with optimized cell/substrate interactions, fabricated by a versatile and cost-effective 

multilayer technology.

Abstract 

Nanostructured films consisting of polysaccharides and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) are 

fabricated in a layer-by-layer manner. A quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) 

is used to follow the buildup of hybrid films containing one polysaccharide (chitosan or alginate) and 

one of several ELRs that differ in terms of amino acid content, length and biofunctionality in situ at pH 

4.0 and pH 5.5. The charge density of the ingredients at each pH is determined by measuring their ?-

potential, and the thickness of a total of 36 different films containing five bilayers is estimated using the 

Voigt-based viscoelastic model. A comparison of the values obtained reveals that thicker films can be 

obtained when working at a pH close to the acidity constant of the polysaccharide used (near-pKa 

conditions), suggesting that the construction of such films is more favorable when based on the 

presence of hydrophobic interactions between ELRs and partially neutralized polysaccharides. Further 

analysis shows that the molecular weight of the ELRs plays only a minor role in defining the growth 

tendency. When taken together, these results point to the most favorable conditions for constructing 

nanostructured films from natural and distinct recombinant polypeptides that can be tuned to exhibit 

specialized biofunctionality for tissue-engineering, drug-delivery, and biotechnological applications.

7.1 Introduction 

Surface engineering is a field of expertise concerned with the modification and improvement of 

interfaces [1-3]. In the past decades, this technique has been widely applied in the field of biomedical 

and tissue engineering, where the properties of substrate surfaces need to be tuned to promote cell 

expansion, improve the interface between an implantable device and its biological environment, and 

add stimuli-responsiveness for on-demand surface property switching [4-7]. Layer-by-layer (LbL) 

techniques are perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-apply of the numerous surface-modification tools 

currently available as they are based on the spontaneous adsorption of ingredients onto a substrate, 

generally a polymer, biomolecule or inorganic particle, and allow the sequential formation of a 

nanostructured film. This technique allows robust coatings to be produced on substrates with complex 

geometries and, as it does away with the need for harmful organic solvents, it is of great interest in 

tissue-engineering applications [5,8-10]. As such, LbL methods have already been employed in cell-

sheet technology [11,12], for drug delivery [13-15] and for the creation of three-dimensional scaffolds 

for cell culture [16]. 

Exploiting strong, long-range electrostatic interactions (e.g., attraction between oppositely charged 

polyelectrolytes) [17] is by far the most widely used LbL construction mechanism, often referred to as 

electrostatic self-assembly (ESA). LbL synthesis is not restricted to this mechanism: this technique relies 

on the existence of multiple complementary intermolecular interactions that allow the LbL concept to be 

widened to include hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (often referred to as secondary or 

nonelectrostatic interactions) [18-20]. Nowadays, it is assumed that the gain in entropy is also a key 

phenomenon for LbL construction which results from the release of counter-ions. The outcome of such 

a mechanism is often the organization of the layers in a more coiled and interdigitated conformation 

and loss of degrees of freedom from the polyelectrolyte molecules [19-21]. 

Herein we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of LbL synthesis using natural marine-based 

polysaccharides [chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG)] and nature-inspired polypeptides, in this case 

elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), which are the recombinant analogs of elastin-like polymers (ELPs). 

The polycationic chitosan and polyanionic alginate are well-known polysaccharides derived from marine 

crustaceans and brown algae, respectively [22]. Both polymers are non-toxic and exhibit adhesive, 

bacteriostatic, fungistatic, hemostatic and antimicrobial effects that make them suitable for use in 

wound dressings and drug-delivery systems [23-25]. ELRs are genetically modified biocompatible and

232 

stimuli-responsive polypeptides that mimic natural elastin, the extracellular elastic protein found in 

higher classes of animals [26-28]. These polypeptides exhibit a transition temperature (Tt) in aqueous 

solution above which free polymer chains adopt random coil conformations and separate from the 

solvent. ELRs follow the standard repeating structure of elastin, namely valine-proline-glycine-valine-

glycine (VPGVG), a sequence with no electrostatic charge. Besides their smart nature, the most 

attractive property of ELRs is their ability to be engineered to contain amino acid sequences with charge 

and even bioactivity. Indeed, it has proven possible to construct ELRs containing sequences that 

enhance cell adhesion [29,30] or biomineralization [31]. One could thus consider that such materials 

may be able to act as versatile and fine-tuned models for protein systems, including nanostructured 

coatings for highly specific tissue-engineering applications. 

A great deal of time and effort has been dedicated to the widely investigated poly(styrene 

sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system, which is currently considered to be a 

model of how multilayered thin films are built, over the past 20 years [5]. The fact that most studies in 

this field have been based on the application of ESA interactions to synthetic materials with controllable 

properties has hindered a more in-depth understanding of the secondary construction mechanism. As a 

consequence, extrapolation to new tailored materials that are more suitable for tissue-engineering 

applications, as is the case for ELRs or proteins in general, has been limited. In this regard, classical 

ESA has been unable to explain fully the formation of multilayer thin films and the role of secondary 

interactions has been brought into question. A report from Cini and co-workers [32] – to which also 

contributed Decher, one of the pioneers of LbL – have also proposed that the construction of 

poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium phosphate) (PSP) “violates almost all the rules” 

of LbL, thereby suggesting a possible contribution from hydrophobic interactions. Our group has also 

considered that the formation of an ELR-containing multilayer film is almost certainly driven, at least in 

part, by hydrophobic interactions [29]. However, to the best of our knowledge, studies that could 

systematically and extensively confirm the role of such interactions in the construction of multilayered 

films have yet not been reported. 

In this work we intended to study the conditions needed to successfully obtain a hybrid, biomimetic LbL 

film that combines the properties of natural and genetically modified polymers. We resorted to a quartz-

crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), a technique that is able to detect adsorbed 

surface density changes in the order of ng?cm
-2

 and measure the viscoelastic properties of the resulting 

surface in real time. Based on the piezoelectric effect, QCM has proven to be a powerful technique for

combinatorial approach 

 

233 

evaluating the growth of multilayer films as well as for monitoring the effect of factors such as 

concentration, molecular weight and pH during or after their assembly [33-37]. Thus, our objectives 

were (i) to study the influence of ESA and secondary interactions in the buildup mechanism of the 

proposed hybrid films by means of charge variations dependent on pH, (ii) study the influence of 

distinct ELR molecular weights (Mn), (iii) compare the feasibility of the construction when using two 

distinct polysaccharides, CHI and ALG, and (iv) extend the knowledge of LbL mechanisms to the class 

of ELRs. 

7.2 Experimental section 

7.2.1 Materials 

Medium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (reference 448877, Brookshield 

viscosity 200-800 cP, molecular weight 190-310 kDa) and purified by a series of filtering steps and 

precipitation from water and ethanol, followed by freeze-drying. To determine the degree of 

deacetylation (DD) of chitosan, hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (
1
H-NMR) was performed using 

a Varian MR-400 spectrometer. 10 mg of chitosan was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and 

20 µL of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl). An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube 

and the spectrum recorded at 60°C. The calculation method of DD was described elsewhere [38] and 

was determined to be 82%. Alginate (alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae) was purchased from 

Fluka (reference 71238, molecular weight 100-200 kDa). ELRs were obtained by the induced gene 

expression of recombinant Escherichia coli strains containing the expressing gene. Each ELR was 

induced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter, in terrific broth medium (TB) supplemented with carbenicillin 

(0.1% v/v) and glucose (0.1% v/v), under controlled conditions of temperature (37 ºC) and pH (7.00). 

Fermentation was stopped after registering an optical density variation at 600 nm of less than 0.25, in 

a time-frame of 1 hour. The culture was then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended and lysed by 

ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was 

subjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations (4 and 40ºC, respectively). All purification 

steps were carried out in sodium chloride solution (0.5 M). The polymer in solution was dialyzed against 

ultrapure water, frozen at -24ºC and freeze-dried.

7.2.2 Assessment of the ELR compositions 

The molecular weight and amino acid composition of the samples obtained were determined by matrix-

assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and amino acid 

content analysis, respectively. These methods, and their results, are described in more detail in the 

Supporting Information. The percentage of residues subject to ionization and the proportion of positive 

and negative charges were also calculated. 

7.2.3 Measurement of the charges 

The ?-potentials of the polysaccharides and ELRs were determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern 

(United Kingdom), at 25ºC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient were used, at 100 ?g?mL
-1

, 0.15 M 

NaCl and pH values of 4.0 or 5.5. 

7.2.4 Construction of hybrid self-assembled films 

A Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring system 

was used to monitor the adsorption of polysaccharides and ELRs onto gold-coated quartz crystals in situ 

(Q-Sense, reference QSX301). The assembled films consisted of a series of polysaccharide/ELR 

combinations at pH values of either 4.0 or 5.5, thus resulting in a total of 36 different conditions. 

Combinations containing chitosan had this polycation as the first layer, whereas those containing 

alginate had this polyanion as the second layer. The quartz-crystal was excited at multiple overtones (1, 

3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, corresponding to 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 MHz respectively). Adsorption 

took place at 25ºC, using solutions at 100 ?g?mL
-1

, 0.15 M NaCl and at a constant flow rate of 50 

mL?min
-1

, with an adsorption time of 15 minutes and an intermediate rinsing step of 10 minutes. 

7.2.5 Estimation of the film thicknesses 

The Voigt-based viscoelastic model contained in the QTools software from Q-Sense (version 3.0.15.553) 

was used to estimate the thickness of the films from the QCM-D monitoring data. Iterations of the 

model were performed using at least three overtones. The model requires three parameters, namely 

solvent density, solvent viscosity and film density, to be fixed. The solvent viscosity was therefore fixed 

at 0.001 Pa?s (same as water) and the film density at 1200 kg.m
-3

 (often assumed to return the lowest 



Chapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a 

combinatorial approach 

 

235 

calculation error) [29,37,39]. The solvent density was varied by trial and error between 1000 and 1060 

kg?m
-3

 until the total error, ?
2
, was minimized. 

7.3 Results and discussion 

7.3.1 Characterization of the polysaccharides and ELRs 

We selected nine ELRs for this study as the genetically engineered origin of these compounds allows a 

class of materials that can differ in terms of sequence, length and bioactivity without significantly 

altering the original elastin backbone to be studied. The properties of each ELR are summarized in 

Table 7.1 according to their molecular weight, Mn, amino acid sequence and proportions of 

charged/uncharged and positive/negative residues. The acronyms were assigned on the basis of their 

distinct sequence, function and variations on the repeating (VPGVG) sequence. The experimental amino 

acid composition and MALDI-TOF values can be found in Supplemental Information (Supplemental 

Table 7.1, Supplemental Table 7.2, Supplemental Table 7.3, Supplemental Figure 7.1) showing that 

the experimental Mn and number of amino acids agree well with the theoretical values of Table 7.1. 

Arginine (R), histidine (H) and lysine (K) are positively charged when protonated and aspartic acid (D) 

and glutamic acid (E) are negatively charged when deprotonated. The properties of these residues were 

taken into account when calculating the charged and amino acid proportions. A closer look at each ELR 

sequence shows that they are all distinct and that some even exhibit motifs with biological relevance 

that could make them useful for current therapies and applications: 3K-VRGDV and H-RGD6, for 

example, contain the RGD sequence, which promotes cell adhesion. 3K-VRDG
(-)

V is the negative control 

of the former as it contains the same sequence but with a scrambled, non-functional RDG motif. 

Similarly, HAP3, H3A20 and H3A20H3 exhibit sequences that promote biomineralization, organized as 

single, double and triple blocks, respectively, with the alanine-block (A20 portion) being highly 

hydrophobic. GEG15 and IK24 contain E and K residues, which confer anionic and cationic behavior, 

respectively. Finally, the neutralized V84 lacks ionizable residues and is therefore uncharged. 

Although the original sequence of V84 contains three K-residues, which in theory should confer a 

positive charge on this ELR, it was neutralized in order to use it as a neutral control (see Supplemental 

Information, “neutralization of V84”). This sequence was used to analyze the buildup of a neutral ELR 

hybrid film in comparison with ELRs that are susceptible to ionization.

Like most proteins, the ionizable residues in the backbone of these ELRs represent only a small fraction 

of the whole sequence (maximum of 11.4% in the case of HAP3). Therefore, although ELRs can be 

modified to include specific peptide sequences, they still retain the basic properties of this class of 

polymers. This is a relevant property for the present study, considering that the nonionizable residues 

may interact by hydrophobic interactions. Despite the fact that these interactions are weaker and have a 

shorter range than their electrostatic counterparts, they nevertheless have been shown to play an 

important role in stabilizing the internal structure of multilayers containing uncharged groups, such as 

most proteins, which contain large numbers of hydrophobic groups [40-42]. 

Using a group of ELRs with such distinct properties, we expected to be able to identify the properties 

that are essential for the construction of this kind of hybrid nanostructured film, especially films 

containing complex ELRs with bioactivity and practical relevance. 

7.3.2 Effect of the charged state by means of the ?-potential 

One of the parameters to be studied was the influence of electrostatic interactions – or lack of them – 

during the growth process. To this end, we measured the charge of each ELR and polysaccharide prior 

to the QCM-D experiments by determining their ?-potentials at pH 4.0 and 5.5. The results are shown in  

Table 7.2.

In the case of the polysaccharides, CHI exhibited a positive and ALG a negative charge as expected and, 

since both contain ionizable groups, their charge varied with the pH, with their potential decreasing at 

the pH value closest to their respective pKa as their charges were progressively neutralized [close to the 

pKa of ALG (?3.2–4) [43] and CHI (?6) [25], respectively]. As for the ELRs, it is interesting to note that, 

irrespective of the pH, in general they are all negatively charged despite the fact that all ELRs, except 

GEG15, have a higher proportion of residues that are susceptible of exhibiting a positive charge, with 

the highest being H-RGD6 (84.4%) and IK24 (96%), in comparison to the number of negative ones. 

One would expect that some ELRs should exhibit positive values, especially at pH 4.0, where the 

availability of uncharged protonated –COOH groups would be higher. The complexity of the ELR 

polypeptide family may explain why this did not occur: characteristics such as chain conformation and 

residue exhibition/inhibition may vary among different peptide sequences. Indeed, previous studies 

have shown that the pKa of ionizable side-chains may change significantly, for example with small 

changes in the amino acid sequence [44,45]. However, such a characterization was not in the scope of 

this work since only the effective charge of each polymer in solution was considered when reaching the 

conclusions presented below. The IK24 and H-RGD6 ELRs are indeed positively charged at pH 4.0. In 

the case of the former, although it has an E-residue that can be ionized with a negative charge, the fact 

that the K-residues are in excess does not allow for a charge sign inversion below pH 5.5. A similar 

situation was found for neutralized V84, which contains no ionizable residues, although in this case the 

small charge fluctuation is due to the effect of pH on the N– and C–termini. In contrast, the block-ELRs 

(H3A20 and H3A20H3) are more negative at pH 4.0 than at pH 5.5. Again, it is likely that a different 

conformation arises as a result of organization of the ELR into blocks and their amphiphilic nature. 

Currently, two models are accepted to explain LbL growth driven by electrostatic interactions. One 

states that the LbL ingredients should have a minimum charge density with opposite signs, whereas the 

other states that, rather than having a minimum charge density, it is the charge balance that favors the 

buildup, i.e., that two ingredients are equally and symmetrically charged. Also, the gain of entropy can 

be hypothesized. For instance, it is known that, when using weak polyelectrolytes, polymers with a 

higher number of charged and polar groups tend to be adsorbed as a thin layer with a flat chain 

conformation whereas more neutral ones tend to be adsorbed as a thicker layer and to form loop-type 

structures [46-48]. Since the ELRs used herein are modified versions of the basic repeating block of 

elastin (some with charged amino acids) they would appear to be the ingredient with the most 

hydrophobic backbone rather than the polysaccharides, and thus have a higher contribute to the 



Chapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a 

combinatorial approach 

 

239 

entropy mechanism due to the formation of loopier and interdigitated layers. Moreover, changing the pH 

of weak polyelectrolytes, namely the polysaccharides used, will also vary their ionizable state, making 

them more charged or less charged. However, unlike the presence or absence of electrostatic charges, 

the real weight of the entropic gain in the LbL mechanism cannot be directly measured, and thus was 

left out of the discussion presented below. In light of the above, we defined 36 test conditions. Each 

condition is a combination of a polysaccharide (CHI or ALG) with one of the nine ELRs. Each one of 

these combinations was then studied at two pH values: 4.0 and 5.5, close to the pKa of ALG and CHI, 

respectively. This allowed combinations containing fully charged/ionized or partially charged (near-pKa 

conditions) forms of polysaccharides with ELRs to be compared. For convenience, each permutation 

combining ELRs and either ALG or CHI at pH 4.0 or 5.5 will henceforth be referred to as ALG40 or 

CHI40 and ALG55 or CHI55, respectively. 

Our first step was to represent graphically the ?-potentials of the polysaccharides and ELRs at each pH 

in Figure 7.1, in order to estimate the influence of the above-mentioned models. In this graphic, each 

end of the column represents the charge of each ingredient used in each of the 36 combinations. 

Lighter colors are used when the ingredients possess the same charge sign. First, identifying the 

potential combinations meeting the first ESA theory mentioned above is simple, since the only 

requirement is that the ingredients possess charge with opposite sign. Most CHI permutations meet the 

criteria, with only a few ALG ones. Second, we analyzed the charge balance under each condition. For 

CHI combinations, in general the ?-potential of the highly charged chitosan is not matched by the 

weakly charged ELRs under CHI40 conditions. This situation can be seen graphically by the different 

lengths of the bars on the positive and negative sides, or by bars represented in only one charge side. 

However, at pH 5.5, CHI becomes less charged (+13.1±0.3 mV, in comparison to +16.8±0.8 mV) and 

at the same time the charge of the ELRs shifts to a more negatively charged state (notice that the 

charge of CHI and the block polypeptides H3A20 and H3A20H3 are balanced in either condition), thus 

leading to a more effective net charge balance. A similar trend is observed for ALG combinations. ALG 

at pH 4.0 is partially neutralized and the ?-potentials of the ELRs shift toward more positive values. This 

way, a more favorable electrostatic situation between ALG and ELRs is achieved but in a different 

manner than when using CHI: whereas with CHI55 balance is achieved by a decrease of its positive 

charge and an increase in the negative charge of the ELRs, with ALG40 a reduction in the electrostatic 

repulsion arising from a lower ionization state of ALG and the ELRs is observed, thereby representing a 

shift toward a situation where uncharged group interaction is maximized.

the charge balance between each polymer in terms of positive (red) and negative (blue) proportion of 

the whole bar length. Bars depicted in light blue and purple represent combinations in which both 

polymers exhibit potential with the same signal. For example, in the first column, where CHI and 3K-

column, where ALG and V84 were used at pH 5.5, the ?-potentials were -15.5 mV and -1 mV, 

respectively. 

 

Given the potential mechanisms at work under the different polysaccharide/ELR/pH permutations, we 

have resorted to the QCM-D in order to determine the type of mechanism in which the construction of 

hybrid polysaccharide/ELR films majorly depends. 

7.3.3 QCM-D data acquisition 

Each experiment was conducted using a QCM-D to monitor the sequential adsorption of a single 

polysaccharide and an ELR. In each experiment, the pH of the solutions used (polymeric and rinsing) 

was adjusted to either 4.0 or 5.5. Also, in order to avoid the induction of conformational changes and 

data acquisition noise from the layers that had assembled previously, the pH values of the solutions 

used in each experiment were adjusted to the same value. Typical graphs of frequency (?F) and

dissipation (?D) variations are depicted for five bilayers of CHI/ELR (Figure 7.2A and Figure 7.2C, 

respectively) and ELR/ALG (Figure 7.2B and Figure 7.2D, respectively) at different pH values. The 

example presented (the combinations using H-RGD6) shows the data obtained for the fifth overtone, 

which corresponds to an excitation frequency of 25 MHz, and is representative of all 36 

polysaccharide/ELR/pH conditions. The graphics obtained for each combination studied can be found

During QCM-D acquisition, a favorable and successful construction is usually identified by a decrease in 

?F caused by mass adsorption at the surface of the gold-coated quartz sensor. At the same time, 

monitoring of ?D gives an indirect indication of the film’s viscoelastic properties. For instance, an 

increase in ?D represents a shift towards a film with a higher viscous component and damping 

properties that becomes “softer”, which is typical of polymeric LbL films. The dissipation values for a 

soft film are higher due to increased energy loss from the crystal, whereas smaller dissipation values 

are obtained for a rigid film. It is this dampening to the crystal’s oscillation that is registered as 

dissipation, ?D [49,50]. A closer look at Figure 7.2 allows the most favorable conditions for LbL 

construction of these hybrid films to be identified, namely pH values close to the pKa of the 

polysaccharide used, i.e. conditions ALG40 and CHI55, with absolute ?F5 values of around 225 and 

200 Hz, respectively. Under these conditions, the amplitude of ?F is greater than for the others. A 

similar trend is observed for ?D. 

7.3.4 Data modeling and thickness analysis 

The data acquired allowed the thickness of the films obtained under each of the 36 conditions to be 

estimated. When constructing rigid films, the frequency values are related to the adsorbed film mass 

(?m) and that mass is directly related to ?F, a relation that is given by the well-known Sauerbrey 

equation (equation 8.1): 

n

FC
m

??
???  (8.1) 

where C is the mass sensitivity constant and n is the overtone number. However, this relation cannot be 

used for soft films that exhibit viscoelastic properties since the water content and swelling behavior are 

also reflected in ?F and must be taken into account. Therefore, in order to compare every combination 

in this study, the obtained frequency and dissipation values were converted to their estimated thickness 

using the Voigt-based viscoelastic model [51], which is integrated into the QTools software from Q-

Sense, based on equations 8.2 and 8.3:

where, considering a total of k thin viscoelastic layers, ?0 and h0 are the density and thickness of the 

quartz crystal, ?3 is the viscosity of the bulk liquid, ?3 is the viscous penetration depth of the shear wave 

in the bulk liquid, ?3 is the density of liquid, ? is the elastic shear modulus of an overlayer and ? is the 

angular frequency of the oscillation. Together with the integrated Voigt-based viscoelastic model, QCM-D 

constitutes a technique that is both precise and simple to use, allowing one to obtaining a film’s 

properties quickly when comparing to other techniques, such as ellipsometry and surface plasmon 

spectroscopy. The thickness results can be found in Figure 7.3. Also, the numerical thickness and ?
2
 

values associated with the model fitting can be found in Supplemental Figure 7.3. The results for CHI 

and ALG combinations were subsequently analyzed separately in order to avoid an analysis of 

construction mechanisms that cannot be solely explained by the thickness and potential but are also 

influenced by the specific nature of the polymer itself.

Voigt-based viscoelastic model, for each polysaccharide/ELR permutation at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5. 

Deviation bars represent two standard deviations. 

 

In LbL growth, different materials tend to adsorb with distinct kinetics and conformations, thus meaning 

that although both CHI and ALG are polysaccharides, they will react differently with ELRs in a multilayer 

hybrid film. The series plotted in Figure 7.3 represent the results obtained when using ALG at pH 4.0 or 

pH 5.5 and CHI at the same pH values. Some combinations were performed in triplicate, leading to an 

estimated maximum standard error of 12% (estimated from HAP3 at ALG40). 



Chapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a 

combinatorial approach 

 

244 

First it can be seen that the overall thickness values are higher for combinations containing CHI as the 

polysaccharide: the sum of all thickness values for CHI is 566 nm, while that for ALG is 456 nm. If we 

consider solely the role of ESA interactions, the overall construction of the films is more favorable with 

CHI than when using ALG since the former is a polycation and most ELRs are negatively charged. For 

films made of H-RGD6, IK24 and HAP3, ALG40 conditions are actually more favorable than CHI55, but 

this observation can be explained by their exhibited charge, with the first two being positive at pH 4.0 

(1.8 and 3.5 mV, respectively) whereas the third is nearly neutral (-0.4 mV). The overall construction 

phenomenon looks dependent on the charge sign among the ingredients. However, it should be noted 

that the analysis resulting from Figure 7.1 shows that most ALG/pH permutations do not meet the 

criteria to follow a construction based on a minimum charge density, i.e., the ingredients do not 

possess opposite charge sign and the ingredients are all negatively charged. Despite this fact, LbL was 

still possible when using ALG and thus the mechanism of construction must depend on additional 

factors. A more specific look at each polysaccharide combination will allow further data to be obtained 

regarding the growth mechanism at work. 

When analyzing the CHI and ALG combinations separately, another trend was identified. For each 

polysaccharide/ELR condition, the thickness is higher when the polysaccharides were only partially 

charged, i.e., at near-pKa conditions. Following again the example of H-RGD6, for instance, the 

thickness of films at CHI40 and CHI55 conditions were 22 and 51 nm, whereas at ALG40 and ALG 55 

they were 65 and 11 nm, respectively. In the case of CHI/ELR films, the model of charge balance and 

symmetry alone could explain the construction mechanism, but for ALG permutations such model is not 

valid, as denoted above. At pH 4.0, there is less electrostatic repulsion between ALG and ELRs are 

electrostatically more balanced than at pH 5.5. The fact that the majority of permutations involve 

ingredients with the same charge sign means there is no charge symmetry, and thus also conflict with 

the charge balance model. This result suggests that the proposed hybrid multilayer construction 

depends on a lower charge density of the polysaccharides, regardless of charge sign, by increasing the 

availability of neutral binding sites, and therefore materials with a low charge density are a key factor for 

the construction of polysaccharide/ELR films. In this case, we hypothesize that secondary hydrophobic 

interactions are a key force driving LbL growth. The block-ELRs H3A20 and H3A20H3 are a good 

example of this mechanism. As observed in Figure 7.1, these polymers are electrostatically well-

balanced with CHI at both pH values (CHI40/H3A20: +16.8/-13.3 mV; CHI55/H3A20: +13.1/-10.7 

mV; CHI40/H3A20H3: +16.8/-17.7 mV; CHI55/H3A20H3: +13.1/-15.0 mV). Although their ?-

combinatorial approach 

 

245 

potentials would favor ESA balance in both cases, thicknesses are higher at CHI55 than at CHI40, 

where the availability of charged groups is lower in comparison. To further consolidate this observation, 

we have also studied the growth mechanism with the neutralized V84, which has no ionizable groups. It 

is noteworthy that favorable LbL growth under near-pKa conditions is also observed for this ELR. 

Therefore, whereas ESA interactions are present in all other ELRs, the successful construction of 

polysaccharide/(neutralized V84) films relies solely on the density of hydrophobic groups under ALG40 

and CHI55 conditions. 

7.3.5 Effect of molecular weight 

Due to the complexity of the ELR samples tested, several parameters, namely molecular weight, pH, 

zeta-potential, charge density and charge balance between each film component, must be considered to 

determine their contribution to film growth. In this regard, we have tested the obtained data against 

these parameters assuming that hydrophobic forces play an important role in the self-assembly process. 

First of all, we plotted thickness as a function of the ?-potential and Mn of the ELRs for each set of 

polysaccharide/pH combinations. The variations of thickness with ?-potential (Supplemental Figure 

7.2A) and Mn (Supplemental Figure 7.2B) are represented, which shows no clear trend in either case. 

At this point, it was assumed that ELRs with a similar Mn exhibit different potentials, and vice-versa. For 

instance, 3K-VRGDV (Mn=31371 Da) has a charge of -8.4±0.3 mV at pH 5.5, whereas another ELR with 

very similar Mn like neutralized V84 (Mn=35191 Da) has a charge of only -1.0±0.1 mV. The ELRs were 

therefore grouped according to their mean charge and their thickness plotted as a function of Mn for 

each defined charge range (see Figure 7.4). 

In general, one would expect that a higher Mn would lead to a thicker film. Thus, whereas a small 

molecule adsorbs in an extended conformation, a lengthier polymer tends to adsorb in a more “loopier” 

manner, thereby providing more anchoring sites for the next layer to adsorb and, potentially, higher 

interpenetration capabilities than smaller ones [52]. For each ?-potential range selected, the use of fully 

charged polysaccharides (ALG55 and CHI40) leads to a thickness decrease with increasing Mn. Under 

near-pKa conditions of ALG, the overall thickness of the films increases with Mn.

V and 3K-VRGDV films (Mn=31371 Da) is represented. 

 

However, this observation was valid for all ALG40 combinations but not all CHI55 ones, with three of 

the 36 conditions tested being atypical. It can be seen from Figure 7.4D that the thickness under CHI55 

conditions decreases from 49 to 42 nm. The ELR in question is H3A20H3 (Mn=71462 Da), which is 

organized into two charged blocks separated by another non-polar block of alanine residues (A). We 

therefore hypothesize that, during LbL growth, the charged blocks are the first to contact with the 

underlying surface whereas the highly neutral and nonpolar block containing a high number of A-

residues (hydropathy index of 1.8) [53] is much less likely to interact with the hydrated film. Although it 

is true that all ELRs possess hydrophobic residues in their backbone, block-ELRs are spatially organized 

with one block completely charge-free, thus limiting its interaction with aqueous solvents. 

The other two anomalous situations can be seen in Figure 7.4F. The first, at CHI55 for IK24 

(Mn=51970 Da), shows a thickness decrease to 22 nm. IK24 exhibits the highest percentage of 

positively ionizable residues. As such, even when CHI is only partially deprotonated, it is plausible to 

assume that the positive charges of both ingredients (which are stronger and longer in range) repel, 

thereby minimizing the interaction between shorter range hydrophobic groups. The second, at ALG55 

for the same ELR, shows a thickness increase to 27 nm. Under these conditions, the positively charged 

IK24 may interact well with ALG as a result of ESA interactions. Note that these Mn-dependent 



Chapter 7. Layer-by-layer film-growth using polysaccharides and recombinant polypeptides: a 

combinatorial approach 

 

247 

exceptions do not conflict with the fact that, for each polysaccharide/ELR combination, adsorption is 

more favorable under near-pKa conditions: ALG55 is still a less favorable condition than ALG40, even 

for the polycationic IK24. 

It is unclear why the trend in this behavior does not completely match the molecular weight model for 

LbL assembly and is distinct among many of the studied conditions. Therefore, in light of the uncertain 

influence of Mn on multilayer construction, the fact that it is only favorable in specific cases leads to the 

conclusion that it is not a primary influence on the growth mechanism. 

7.3.6 General model for hybrid multilayer growth 

We have shown that a shift toward near-pKa conditions for both polysaccharides, although of different 

nature, favors the construction of hybrid nanostructured polysaccharide/ELR films. The same 

arguments rule out the theory of minimum charge density, since LbL growth is observed even when 

charges of the same sign are present. Based on this extensive analysis, the LbL growth of hybrid 

polysaccharide and ELR films cannot be explained by ESA interactions alone, thus meaning that 

secondary hydrophobic interactions must be taken into account. The arguments presented herein are 

also valid for the control ELR (neutralized V84). As this ELR exhibits no ionizable groups, the 

construction of films with neutralized V84 was also more favorable under near-pKa conditions, thus 

further clarifying the role of nonelectrostatic forces. A schematic depiction of our findings is provided in 

Figure 7.5.

7.4 Conclusions 

The contributions of the molecular weight and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to LbL film 

growth have been extensively studied using a QCM-D method. Thus, a comparison of the thickness of 

36 films formed under different conditions (polysaccharide and ELR combinations and the charges of 

each intervening ingredient) has shown that the growth of such hybrid nanostructured films is more 

favorable when the polysaccharide used is partially neutral, i.e., near its pKa. Under these conditions, 

hydrophobic groups prevail over charged ones, thus highlighting the greater importance of short-range 

hydrophobic interactions when compared with ESA interactions. The molecular weight appears to have 

little effect on LbL growth. Future studies that focus on other parameters, such as ionic strength and 

temperature, should be considered in order to determine whether additional factors affect this 

combination model. These conclusions are important in order to correctly predict the most favorable 

parameters for constructing nanostructured films from natural and nature-inspired materials, especially 

since the use of genetically engineered polypeptides could lead to films with tailored properties and 

biologically relevant functions for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biotechnology that 

require precise and improved specificity. 

7.5 Supplemental information 

7.5.1 Neutralization of V84 

The ELR V84 was chemically modified by amidation of the ?-amine group of the biopolymer with 

pentynoic anhydride as acylating agent. The reaction was performed in trifluoroethanol (TFE) with 10 

equivalents of pentynoic anhydride per ?-amine group and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) 

carbodiimide (EDAC; 5 equivalents) as catalyst. Pentynoic anhydride was synthesized previously from 

pentynoic acid in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether in the presence of 

dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 

The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days at room temperature. After this time, the functionalized 

polymer was precipitated into increasing fractions of diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum oven at room 

temperature for 24 h. Once dry, the modified V84 was solubilized in cold water and the crude product 

purified by exhaustive dialysis against water, then frozen and finally freeze-dried.

Abstract 

In the present work, chitosan (CHI) and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were used to conceive 

nanostructured thin films driven by sequential electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL), a simple and versatile 

technique that discards the use of harmful reagents. Two similar ELRs were engineered to contain 

negatively charged amino acids and organized and a single monoblock or a triblock. The buildup of the 

films was monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-

D). Wettability transitions were observed from a moderate hydrophobic surface to an extremely wettable 

upon increasing the temperature to 50ºC, accompanied by topography changes at the nanoscale as 

assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, the dependence on time for the surface 

molecular rearrangement was studied for the films with each ELR. The potential of this technology may 

stimulate the development of devices and biomaterials for biomedical applications in the near future, 

such as surfaces with tunable and patterned cell adhesion, while the use of ELRs will allow developing 

polypeptides with biological significance.

7A.1 Introduction 

The modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, including cell 

expansion, development of biomaterials and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine [1-3]. 

The surface is the first contact with the organism and dictates the subsequent biological events, namely 

the cellular events and biointegration. This is an approach with potential impact not only on the 

properties of current healthcare systems but also in more cutting-edge ones in tissue engineering. 

Although several techniques may be used to modify a surface, the last decade has emphasized non-

harmful and versatile techniques to modify polymeric substrates: the sequential adsorption of proteins 

and polysaccharides is one of the most promising today. This approach is known as layer-by-layer and 

is driven by a multitude of intermolecular interactions – such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic 

interactions, and hydrogen bonding – that may occur between two distinct materials [4-6]. 

Much work has been done in multilayered systems using poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine 

hydrochloride) and CHI/hyaluronan [7]. However, the knowledge obtained from such systems is not 

always easily extrapolated to other materials and that limits the use of potentially more relevant 

combinations for LbL in biomedical applications. In this work, we aimed to apply the concept of LbL to 

CHI used along with ELRs to conceive multilayered substrates driven by electrostatic interactions. While 

chitosan is a well-known biocompatible polycation of natural origin [8,9], ELRs are genetically 

engineered polypeptides mimicking the sequence of natural elastin, showing smart behavior towards 

external stimuli, among them temperature and pH [10]. We hypothesized that different ELRs, although 

similar in nature and sequence, would display distinct adsorption kinetics. Therefore, we biosynthesized 

a negatively charged ELR organized as a single block, and an ELR organized into three blocks – two 

containing the negative residues and one nonpolar – henceforth designated monoblock and triblock, 

respectively. Furthermore, we studied the stimuli-responsive properties of the assembled coatings in 

terms of wettability and topography variations. 

7A.2 Experimental section 

7A.2.1 ELRs expression and purification 

Gene expression of recombinant Escherichia coli strains were induced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter 

under 37ºC and controlled pH (7.00). Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested and lysed

with acute stimuli-responsive behavior 

 

274 

by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble remains were removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was 

subjected to purification based on temperature cycles. The polymer in solution was then freeze-dried. 

7A.2.2 Buildup kinetics monitoring 

An E4 QCM-D, from Q-Sense (Sweeden) was used to monitor the adsorption of CHI and the ELRs. 

Aqueous solutions of each polymer were prepared at concentrations of 100 µg.mL
-1

, pH 4.5 and in 

0.15 M NaCl. The combinations of CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock and their depositions were studied 

in parallel at the surface of gold-coated sensors, at 25ºC. The adsorption time was 10 minutes. 

7A.2.3 Contact angle measurements 

Contact angles were measured in a DataPhysics OCA15 system using a phosphate-buffered saline 

(PBS) solution for sessile drop experiments. Coatings of CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock assembled 

onto glass (1 cm
2
) were tested for their wettability at 4 and 50ºC. The number of layers was defined 

based on the results from the QCM-D. The coatings were immersed in PBS placed under each 

temperature condition. After periods of 10 minutes of immersion in each temperature condition, the 

samples were withdrawn and contact angles were measured. If wettability did not change significantly, 

the samples were placed in immersion for an additional period of 10 minutes at the same temperature. 

7A.2.4 Topography studies 

AFM tests were conducted in a MultiMode STM microscope controlled by a NanoScope III from Digital 

Instruments system, operating in tapping mode at a frequency of 1Hz. A similar protocol to that of 

contact angle measurements was adopted. To assess the influence of pH in the coatings, a similar 

protocol to the contact angle measurements was followed. The samples were immersed in PBS at room 

temperature and 50ºC and then retrieved and introduced in the device. “pH” was also analyzed, for 

values of 7.4 and 12. The analyzed area was 1 ?m

7A.3 Results and discussion 

7A.3.1 ELRs peptide sequence 

Under the scope of electrostatic LbL, we developed two ELRs containing negative amino acids – namely 

aspartic acids (D) and glutamic acids (E) – in order to bond with the protonated amine groups of CHI, 

positively charged under acidic conditions. Other amino acids are present, however, like lysines (K), 

although in lower number. Their final sequence is justified by the fact that these recombinamers include 

motifs with potential for biomineralization, which may prove to be useful for future bone regeneration 

applications. The representative structures of the monoblock and triblock are shown in Appendix Figure 

7.1, along with the corresponding amino acidic sequence. 

 

 

Appendix Figure 7.1. Representative structure of the featured ELRs and corresponding block peptide 

sequence. 

 

The genetic nature of ELRs ultimately allows constructing macromolecules that are more appropriate for 

coatings of medical devices, allowing even to include sequences of biological relevance. However, their 

use for such purpose falls short of expectation and few works exist that use ELRs as ingredients for thin 

films [11-13]. Comparing both recombinamers, the triblock is different from the monoblock as it 

contains a polypeptide based on the pentapeptide VPAVG in the middle of the structure. This variation 

was introduced to evaluate if the buildup kinetics changes from the use of one ELR to another along 

with CHI for LbL, although their peptide sequence is similar, and to predict if other types of 

modifications would have the potential to be more favorable for multilayered buildup. 

7A.3.2 Buildup monitoring of the films 

The ability of CHI and each ELR to adsorb in a sequential fashion was first monitored by QCM-D. This 

technique is able to detect the adsorption of molecules in the order of ng.cm-2 manifested by the 

decrease of the oscillation frequency of the sensor. It can also measure the viscoelastic properties of

with acute stimuli-responsive behavior 

 

276 

the resulting surface [14]. Appendix Figure 7.2 shows the frequency and dissipation variations (5
th

 

overtone, 25 MHz) for CHI/monoblock and CHI/triblock combinations. 

 

 

Appendix Figure 7.2. QCM-D monitoring of the frequency (?) and dissipation (?) variations for a) 

CHI/monoblock and b) CHI/triblock. The dashed lines mark the end of the adsorption of one bilayer. 

 

The first case, depicted in Appendix Figure 7.2a, shows a progressive decrease of frequency, ?F, to an 

approximate value of 200 Hz, upon flushing the sensors with the sequence of CHI and the monoblock, 

up to 5 bilayers. Simultaneously, the overall dissipation, ?D, increases, showing that the film exhibits 

viscoelastic behavior, typical of macromolecular systems [14,15]. It is worth mentioning that the 

dissipation decreases during the adsorption steps of the monoblock, corresponding to an increase of 

rigidity of the film. This characteristic may be usefull for the conception of coatings where a more rigid 

film is advantageous, like for bone regeneration devices. 

Appendix Figure 7.2b, the monitoring of the CHI/triblock buildup is shown. As observed, only 1 bilayer 

of these polyelectrolytes was successfully adsorbed, up to a ?F of aroud 80 Hz. The ?F after the 

attempt to deposit a second bilayer displays approximately the same value, therefore the following CHI 

and triblock molecules did not adsorb to the interface. This behavior can be explaned by the 

organization of the ELR: since the negatively charged blocks bond with the polycationic CHI, the 

nonpolar one does not intervene in the electrostatic-driven buildup. Therefore it faces outwards the 

interface of the film, rendering it uncharged, limiting the buildup to a single bilayer. When the 

adsorption of CHI is attempted, it does not adsorb because of the absence of negative aminoacids from 

the ELR. The results from the QCM-D show that, although the selected ELRs are similar in nature and 

peptide sequence, the buildup kinetics along with CHI is different, as previously theorized.

7A.3.3 Wettability variations of the films 

ELRs have an intrinsic smart response towards temperature in aqueous solutions. Therefore we 

expected to observe some variation of the wettability of each film with the temperature. The study of the 

buildup kinetics of CHI along with a monoblocked or triblocked ELR was shown in the previous section. 

Based on the QCM-D data, we tested coatings made of 5 bilayers of CHI and the monoblock – 

(CHI/monoblock)5 – and 1 bilayer of CHI and the triblock – (CHI/triblock)1. Contact angle 

measurements are easy and quick to perform and may give useful insight about the molecular 

arrangement of a polymer at a planar surface. It is particularly convenient when the wettability between 

two arrays of conditions is significantly different. Appendix Figure 7.3 shows the contact angle variations 

caused by cyclic changes of the temperature – from 4ºC to 50ºC and vice-versa – and their evolution 

with time. 

 

 

Appendix Figure 7.3. Contact angle variations of (CHI/monoblock)5 (?) and (CHI/triblock)1 (?) upon 

temperature changes and evolution with time. 

 

At start, the samples were at equilibrium at 4ºC and displayed a moderately hydrophobic feature, 

around 65º. Upon increasing the temperature to 50ºC, a transition was detected to a completely 

wettable surface in both cases. We have previously demonstrated that this observation is the result of 

the ELR transition at the surface due to the triggering of its self-assemble [12]. As a result of such 

phenomenon, there is a molecular rearrangement that favors the exposure of charged residues to the 

aqueous surroundings, while burying the hydrophobic amino acids underneath. 

The transition time was different for each sample, though. While in the case of (CHI/monoblock)5 the 

superhydrophilic regimen was observed after 60 min, for the (CHI/triblock)1 it took 100 min. This 

longer time can be explained by the exposure of the nonpolar alanines at the interface: the molecular

with acute stimuli-responsive behavior 

 

278 

rearrangement is more delayed, since at first the free charged amino acids are present below the 

nonpolar block of the ELR, hindering the rearrangement. The transition is only later fully achieved. This 

does not happen with the monoblock, since its structure does not contain the highly hydrophobic 

portion (see Appendix Figure 7.1). Upon decreasing the temperature to 4ºC, both films recovered the 

moderately hydrophobic feature within 20 min. This result reflects the stimuli-responsive behavior of the 

films due to the properties of ELRs in aqueous solutions. Such behavior is retained and is cyclic when in 

the form of bidimensional substrates. 

7A.3.4 Topography analysis 

We determined that the monoblocked ELR is appropriate for constructing multilayered films. Having in 

mind that we intend to use ELRs using a multilayer approach along with polysaccharides, we studied 

the topography of CHI/monoblock films with different number of layers. The wettability variations found 

in the previous section should be accompanied by topography changes. Appendix Figure 7.4 shows the 

images obtained by AFM for 1, 3 and 5 bilayers. The variations of the topography with temperature 

were also studied, for 25 and for 50ºC. Appendix Table 7.1 shows the root-mean-square roughness 

(RMS) values for each case. As observed, independently of the temperature, the roughness increases 

with increasing number of layers due to the increase of mass at the surface, a typical observation of 

several LbL systems [5].

In Appendix Figure 7.4a to Appendix Figure 7.4c the topographies at room temperature show no 

apparent organization for any of the number of layers. Upon increasing the temperature to 50ºC, the 

formation of nanostructures was detected, caused by the triggering of the ELR self-assembly and 

consequent formation of larger and organized structures. The roughness values also increased in 

accordance. These results relate well with the contact angle measurements: the detected 

nanostructures result from the molecular rearrangement of the ELR, where their cores are mainly 

composed of nonpolar amino acids, while exposing the charged residues to the outer regions. Therefore, 

these are micelle-like structures which organization favors the affinity of the films to water. It is also 

worth mentioning that similar topography and roughness results were obtained for the variation of pH, 

which is also known to trigger the transition of ELRs containing lysines (pka ranging 9.4–10.6 [16]). 

Such organization at the nanoscale may be used in the future development of patterned substrates for 

tunable cell adhesion. 

7A.4 Conclusions 

The presented work shows that polysaccharides and ELRS can be successfully combined following a 

multilayer approach to conceive nanostructured films. Both ELRs are similar in nature and peptide 

sequence; however the buildup kinetics is different, being limited to only 1 bilayer in the case of the 

triblock. Acute wettability variations were observed as a function of temperature for coatings of 

(CHI/monoblock)5 and (CHI/triblock)1, caused by a molecular rearrangement of the ELRs at the surface. 

Topography changes were detected at the nanoscale, where micelle-like structures were formed due to 

the increase of temperature or pH. The properties of the films may be exploited in the future for 

substrates with patterned and tunable cell adhesion. Furthermore, the recombinant nature of such 

elastin-like macromolecules may enable tuning their sequence to favor LbL constructs and even adding 

biological relevant motifs.

Abstract 

In this work, biomimetic smart thin coatings using chitosan and a recombinant elastin-like 

recombinamer containing the cell attachment sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) are 

fabricated through layer-by-layer. The synthetic polymer is characterized for its molecular mass and 

composition using mass spectroscopy and peptide sequencing. The adsorption of each polymeric layer 

is followed in situ at room temperature and pH 5.5 using a quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation 

monitoring, showing that both polymers can be successfully combined to conceive nanostructured 

multilayered coatings. The smart properties of the coatings are tested for their wettability by contact 

angle (CA) measurements as a function of external stimuli, namely temperature, pH and ionic strength. 

Wettability transitions are observed from a moderate hydrophobic surface (CAs approximately from 62º 

to 71º) to an extremely wettable one (CA considered as 0º) as the temperature, pH and ionic strength 

are raised above 50 ºC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. Atomic force microscopy is performed at pH 7.4 

and pH 11 to assess the coating topography. In the latter, the results reveal the formation of large and 

compact structures upon the aggregation of ELRs at the surface, which increase water affinity. Cell 

adhesion tests are conducted using a SaOs-2 cell line. Enhanced cell adhesion is observed in the 

coatings, as compared to a coating with a chitosan-ending film and a scrambled RDG biopolymer. The 

results suggest that such films could be used in the future as smart biomimetic coatings of biomaterials 

for different biomedical applications, including in tissue engineering or in controlled delivery systems.

8.1 Introduction 

The modification of surfaces has been a key aspect in biology and biotechnology, including cell 

expansion, biomaterials development and preparation of substrates for regenerative medicine) [1-3]. In 

the field of implantable devices, the surface is the first contact with the organism and dictates the 

subsequent biological events, namely the cellular behavior and biointegration. Thus, surface 

engineering is of the utmost significance to lead to the conception of devices with an improved 

biological performance [4-6]. 

Surface modification has been also implemented to produce stimuli-responsive surfaces for a variety of 

applications, including in biomineralization control [7], cell sheet engineering [8,9], surfaces with 

extreme wettabililty transitions [10], and microfluidics [11], mostly based on variations of the hydration 

state of polymeric films deposited at the surfaces. Usually, the modification is performed by grafting 

stimuli-responsive polymers onto a substrate, which are typically synthetic and nonbiodegradable, such 

as poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) [12]. A good example of the latter is the work developed by 

Okano et al. [9] regarding cell-sheet engineering.  

In more recent years, emphasis has been given to non-harmful and versatile techniques to modify 

polymeric substrates: the sequential adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides, known as layer-by-

layer (LbL) adsorption, is one of the most promising today. The principle behind LbL adsorption lies in 

the existence of multiple intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic contacts, hydrophobic 

interactions, and hydrogen bonding, where the cooperative effects of multipoint attractions play the 

most important role. It is a simple and versatile technique which allows producing robust coatings, even 

in substrates with complex geometries; because it discards the need of organic and harmful solvents, it 

is an attractive technique for tissue engineering applications [13-15]. Multilayer systems have already 

been proposed for different biomedical applications, including for biomimetic composite-like coatings, to 

control the release of drugs, or to manipulate the adhesion, differentiation, proliferation and even 

function of attached cells [16-19]. 

In this work, we plan to conceive coatings using natural and nature-inspired macromolecules in a 

multilayered fashion using the LbL approach at mild processing conditions. Natural materials are 

intricate and multifunctional structures that often inspire scientists to design novel classes of 

materials [20]. It is the case of elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs), also designated as elastin-like 

polymers (ELPs). This family of peptide-based polymers was developed by Urry, relying in genetic

engineering techniques, and have their basic structure rooted in elastin, the extracellular elastic protein 

of higher animals [21-23]. In aqueous environment they are known to have self-assembly behavior and 

exhibit a transition temperature (Tt): below Tt, the free polymer chains adopt random coil 

conformations; above it, they fold into an organized structure known as ?-spiral. Although ELRs respond 

primarily to temperature, the effects of other stimuli, such as pH, ionic strength and concentration, also 

affect the transition phenomenon [24]. Their recombinant nature is one of their attractive properties 

because it allows tuning their physicochemical properties and introducing sequences to extend their 

functionality, including biologically relevant domains [25,26]. The work of Girotti et al. [27], who were 

able to biosynthesize an extracellular matrix analogue enclosing the cell attachment sequence arginine-

(glutamic acid)-(aspartic acid)-valine (REDV), is an example of such versatility. Thus, ELRs are an 

attractive option over the most commonly used formulations in LbL adsorption. 

Swierczewska et al. [28] have previously reported the use of ELRs for LbL thin films. However, the 

peptides were modified and conjugated with either poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) 

to provide positive or negative charge, respectively. Our groups have also shown that ELRs can be 

successfully combined with polysaccharides to conceive coatings and some may even be applied using 

a multilayer approach [29,30]. In order to explore the potential of ELR properties and the advantages of 

LbL, we intend to conceive nanostructured thin coatings made from the sequential adsorption of a 

polysaccharide and an ELR modified with the arginine-glycine-(aspartic acid) (RGD) cell adhesion motif, 

labeled ELR-RGD. RGD is expected to increase the cell adhesion in vitro and prove useful in the design 

of devices with tunable cell attachment or even improved host integration. We selected chitosan (CHI) 

because, besides being a well-known biocompatible material, it is one of the few polysaccharides 

exhibiting positive charge (at acidic conditions), is abundant, and its production is environmentally 

safe [31,32]. 

The proposed system will also allow expanding the concept of multilayered films to a new attractive 

class of peptide-based polymers, making them more robust than simple monolayers, and could bring 

new possibilities in the development of nanostructured coatings of materials in tissue engineering. The 

buildup of the multilayers will be monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance with 

dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Distinct techniques, such as contact angle measurements, atomic 

force microscopy (AFM), and cell adhesion tests will be used to characterize it. We hypothesize that 

coatings containing this ELR may exhibit changes both in topography and wettability, depending on

287 

several stimuli, namely temperature, pH and ionic strength, and improved biological in vitro 

performance. 

8.2 Experimental section 

8.2.1 ELR-RGD expression and purification 

The featured ELR monomers of RGD were designated as ELR-RGD. Expression conditions and 

purification protocols were adapted from Meyer and Chilkoti [33] and Girotti et al. [34]. Gene expression 

of a recombinant Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) containing the expressing gene of ELR-RGD was 

induced in a 12 L Applikon fermenter, in terrific broth medium (TB) with 0.1% of carbenicilin and 0.1% 

of glucose, under controlled conditions of temperature (37ºC) and pH (7.00). The fermentation was 

stopped after registering an optical density variation at 600 nm inferior to 0.25, in a time-frame of 1 h. 

Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested by centrifugation, resuspended and lysed by 

ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was 

subjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations, of 4 and 40ºC, respectively. All the 

purification steps were carried out in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution at 0.5 M. The polymer in 

solution was then frozen at -24ºC and freeze-dried. 

8.2.2 ELR-RGD characterization 

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a Mettler Toledo 822e (United 

States) with a liquid nitrogen cooler accessory. Both temperature and enthalpy were calibrated with an 

indium standard at the same experimental conditions used for the studied materials. Water solutions of 

ELR-RGD at 50 mg?mL
-1

 were prepared at pH 7.4. In a typical DSC run, 20 ?L of the solution were 

placed inside a standard 40 ?L aluminum pan hermetically sealed. The same volume of water was 

placed in the reference pan. All samples were equilibrated for 5 minutes at 5°C inside the sample 

chamber just before the beginning of each experiment. A heating rate of 5ºC?min
-1

 was used. To assess 

the biopolymer molecular weight, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) 

mass spectroscopy was performed in a Voyager STR, from Applied Biosystems, in linear mode and with 

an external calibration using bovine serum albumin (BSA). Amino acid composition determination was 

previously used to assess the composition of ELRs [27].

288 

8.2.3 Buildup and characterization of the self-assembled coatings 

Medium molecular weight grade CHI was purchased from Sigma and purified. Solutions of purified CHI 

and ELR-RGD were prepared at 0.1 mg?mL
-1

 in 0.15 M NaCl. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 

5.5. ?-potential of each solution was determined using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom), at 

25ºC. A Q-Sense E4 quartz-crystal microbalance (Q-Sense AB, Sweden) with dissipation monitoring 

system was used for monitoring in situ the deposition of CHI/ELR-RGD multilayers at the surface of 

gold-coated crystals. This technique has previously been extensively described [35-37]. Very briefly, an 

AT cut quartz crystal can be excited at its fundamental frequency (5 MHz) and at several overtones: 25, 

35, and 45 MHz (fifth, seventh, and ninth overtones, respectively). When a thin film is deposited onto 

the sensor crystal the frequency decreases. If the film is thin and rigid the decrease in frequency (?F) is 

proportional to the mass of the film. However, when using polymers, the adsorbed film is not rigid and 

this relation is not valid: the film begins dissipating energy and exhibiting the typical viscoelastic 

behavior, which is evident by the change in the dissipation (?D). The crystals were first cleaned in an 

ultrasound bath at 30ºC, and immersed successively in acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol. Adsorption 

took place at 25ºC and pH 5.5 and at a constant flow rate of 50 mL?min
-1

. Starting with the CHI 

solution, each one was pumped into the system for 10 minutes. Each deposition cycle was followed by 

a rinsing step with 0.15 M NaCl, at pH 5.5, for 10 min, and ?F? and ?D were monitored in real time. 

The frequency of each overtone was normalized to the fundamental resonant frequency of the quartz 

crystal, by diving it by ? (where ?=5; 7; 9). The thickness of the films was estimated using the Voigt 

model through the Q-Tools software, from Q-Sense [38]. The area density was calculated by multiplying 

the thickness by the layer density (1200 kg.m
-3

 led to obtaining calculations with the best fitting). 

8.2.4 Contact-angle measurements 

Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contact angles were measured in a DataPhysics OCA15 system. The 

coatings were prepared at the surface of regular glass microscopy slides, from Marienfeld (Germany). 

The glass was cleaned using the same protocol to which QCM-D crystals were submitted. Coatings up 

to 10 layers – 5 pairs of CHI and ELR-RGD – were characterized for their wettability for each layer 

assembled, at 37ºC and pH 7.4. An approach described by Park et al. [39] was used to measure 

contact angles dependent on several temperature, pH and ionic strength conditions. The 

measurements were performed for a pH range from 4 to 12, ionic strength from 0 to 1.5 M of NaCl, 



Chapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings 

with multiple stimuli-responsive properties 

 

289 

and three relevant temperatures: 25, 37 and 50ºC. The samples were immersed in a beaker of PBS 

placed under each condition. After 1 hour, the samples were withdrawn and contact angles were 

measured. The time of 1 h was determined to be enough to have a stable surface. Upon determining 

the wettability transition parameters, three cycles were performed by changing the transition values 

above and below each transition value. 

8.2.5 Atomic force microscopy measurements 

AFM measurements were performed in a MultiMode STM microscope controlled by the NanoScope III 

from Digital Instruments system, operating in tapping mode at a frequency of 1 Hz. Glass slides were 

cut into pieces of 1×1 cm
2
 and used as substrates for multilayer adsorption. Surfaces coated with 5 

pairs of CHI/ELR-RGD were immersed in PBS for 30 min. To assess the influence of pH in the coatings, 

a similar protocol to the contact angle measurements was followed. The samples were immersed in 

PBS at two pH values: 7.4 and 11. To avoid the formation of crystals during the acquisition, the 

samples were immersed shortly in ultrapure water for removing excess of saline solution. The samples 

were then retrieved and introduced in the device. The analyzed area was 1×1 µm
2
. 

8.2.6 Cell culture studies of SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells 

Cell studies were performed onto coatings of 5 pairs of layers, ending in ELR-RGD, CHI or ELR-RDG
(-)

 

(negative control), assembled at the surface of glass coverslips with 1 cm of diameter. Tissue culture 

polystyrene (TCPS) was used as a positive control. Cell adhesion was studied using the SaOs-2 

osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line. Cells were seeded on the surfaces (5×10
4
 cell?mL

-1
) and 

incubated in serum free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), loaded with 1% 

antibiotics/antimicotics at 37ºC, 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). The substrates were analyzed at different 

time points: 4 h, 24 h and 3 days. At each time point, cells on the coated surfaces were washed with 

PBS twice, fixed in formalin (3.7%) and nuclei of the cells stained with 4',6 diamidino-2-phenylindol 

(DAPI), and the actin was stained with phalloidin. 

For alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, samples collected on each time point were washed with PBS 

and immersed in 1 mL of ultra-pure water to lyse the cells. To each well of a 96-well plate were added 

20 µL of sample plus 60 µL of substrate solution (0.2% (w/v) p-nytrophenyl (pNP) phosphate/1 M 

diethanolamine hydrochloric acid (HCl), at pH 9.8). The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 min 



Chapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings 

with multiple stimuli-responsive properties 

 

290 

at 37ºC. After the incubation period, 80 µl of a stop solution (2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/0.2 mM 

ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), was added to each well. The absorbance was then measured 

at 405 nm using p-nitrophenol as standard. For each experiment, a standard curve was constructed 

from reference suspensions at known cell concentrations. To access cell viability, (3-(4,5-

dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay was 

performed. MTS is bioreduced by cells. The values for absorbance of this reduced product at 490 nm 

are directly proportional to the number of living cells in the substrates. 

8.3 Results and discussion 

8.3.1 ELR-RGD characterization 

For the past two decades, much work has been done on the widely investigated poly(styrene 

sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) system – considered so far as a model of 

multilayered thin films – and CHI/hyaluronan [16]. However, the buildup mechanism is not always 

straightforward to every material and distinct or several forces may influence the construction [40,41]. 

Furthermore, coatings for tissue engineering applications should ideally contain other materials with 

more relevant features, including biological activity. It is the case of the biopolymer used in this work, 

which contains the RGD cell adhesion motif, depicted in Figure 8.1a. 

The ELR-RGD, with 371 aminoacids and theoretical molecular weight of 31371 Da, contains 2 

monomers of RGD, 2 aspartic acids, and 3 lysines isolated at the amino-terminal and exhibits a Tt of 

around 23ºC in solution at physiological pH (data not shown). In contrast to our previous work [30], this 

ELR-RGD was engineered to facilitate electrostatic interactions during the multilayer buildup. In Figure 

8.1b, MALDI-TOF spectrum shows a high intensity peak at 31229 Da, which is approximate to the 

theoretical value for this biopolymer. 

In order to confirm if the produced ELR matched the theoretical amino acidic composition, peptide 

sequencing tests were performed. In Table 8.1, it can be confirmed that the produced biopolymer 

composition matches well the predicted amino acid composition. These results point to the 

bioproduction of a stock of ELR-RGD retaining the desired amino acid sequence.

8.3.1 Analysis of CHI/ELR-RGD film buildup 

The ability of CHI and ELR-RGD to adsorb in a sequential fashion was first monitored by QCM-D. This 

technique is able to detect mass changes in the order of ng.cm
-2

 and measure the viscoelastic 

properties of the resulting surface [35-37]. Due to the recombinant nature of ELRs, it is possible to tune 

their structure to appropriately fit a multilayer approach and design coatings for tissue engineering 

substrates. Figure 8.2a shows the normalized frequency (?F?/?, where ? is the overtone) and 

dissipation (?D) variations for the 5
th

 overtone (25 MHz) after the construction of 20 layers onto gold-

coated sensors. The ?F?/? decreased with time upon flushing the substrate with the sequence of 

polyelectrolytes, to an approximate value of 40 Hz. On the other hand, the ?D increased, revealing that 

the film is not rigid and exhibits the typical viscoelastic behavior, a common situation when using 

macromolecular systems [36,42].

=0.99824). 

 

At the working pH of 5.5, we relied on the protonation state of the ELR-RGD aspartic acids: under such 

conditions, these residues are deprotonated and negatively charged (pKa ranging from 3.0–4.7) [43]. 

This would allow them to interact by electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) with the positively charged amine 



Chapter 8. Layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and recombinant biopolymers into biomimetic coatings 

with multiple stimuli-responsive properties 

 

293 

groups of CHI. Prior to the monitoring, the ?-potential of CHI and ELR-RGD solutions was measured at 

working conditions (pH=5.5 and ionic strength at 0.15 M), showing a charge of +17.0±0.6 

and -8.4±0.33 mV, respectively. ELRs are essentially hydrophobic by nature but can be modified to 

include specific charged residues. CHI is also insoluble in water and can only be dissolved at acidic 

conditions, below its pKa (approximately 6) [44]. It has been reported that electrostatic deposition 

demands appropriate matching of the charge density of the used polyelectrolyte pair, rather than a 

minimum charge density [13,45], but in this case the ?-potential showed no charge balance (i.e. equal 

absolute values). Although ESA was a driving force of construction, other forces, like hydrophobic 

interactions, are likely to participate on the assembling phenomenon. In fact, Figure 8.2a shows the 

successful combination of the used pair, at the assembly pH of 5.5, near the pKa of CHI. We can 

assume that a fraction of already deprotonated amine groups interacts with the hydrophobic residues of 

the ELR-RGD structure and allow the construction of the coating. 

The QCM-D data was used to estimate the thickness variations of the film along with the adsorption 

cycles. Figure 8.2b shows the results calculated using the Voigt model implemented in the Q-Tools 

software from Q-Sense [38]. It can be observed that the thickness increased linearly during the buildup, 

in accordance with the evolution of ?F? and ?D variations. After the deposition of 20 layers, the film 

had a thickness of 81 nm, corresponding to an approximate total area density of 9.6 µg.cm
-2

 

(multiplication of thickness by the layer density. 1200 kg.m
-3

 allowed for the best fitting). Figure 8.2b 

also shows the thickness of each layer (“thickness increase” in the graphic). Overall, the increase of 

thickness is higher for the adsorption steps of ELR-RGD. This is the result of the lower charged exhibited 

by the recombinamer, which requires that more material is needed to overcompensate the charges of 

the underlying CHI ones. The results obtained through QCM-D measurements demonstrate that ELR-

RGD can be used successfully with CHI to conceive a viscoelastic polymeric coating using the LbL 

approach. 

8.3.2 Characterization of the self-assembled coatings 

When a material adheres to a substrate, it is expected that such phenomenon will result in 

physicochemical changes at the surface [46,47]. The measurement of contact angles is an easy 

method that allows a quick assessment of the modification of a surface in terms of wettability, and its 

usefulness is even higher when such wettability is significantly different for each layer. Figure 8.3 shows 

the contact angle variation of the CHI/ELR-RGD film with the buildup, up to 10 layers.

with multiple stimuli-responsive properties 

 

294 

 

Figure 8.3. Evolution of the contact angle of the films obtained with sequential adsorption of CHI and 

ELR-RGD, up to 10 layers Odd numbers correspond to films ending in CHI and even numbers to films 

ending in ELR-RGD. Error bars represent two standard deviations (n=9). 

 

The films were adsorbed onto glass (contact angle of 28.6±2.9º). Each measurement was performed 

after 1 hour of immersion in PBS at 37 ºC. While films ending in ELR-RGD retained their moderate 

hydrophobic behavior (approximately between 62º and 71º), the ones ending in CHI increased gradually, 

from 20.4±4.4º in the first layer to 40.1±3.9º in the fifth (layer 9). The increasing values of contact 

angles obtained for CHI-ending films can be explained by the influence of the underlying adsorbed 

layers on the coating interface. When using weak polyelectrolytes, the most charged polymer tends to 

be adsorbed as a thin layer with flat chain conformations, while the less charged polymer tends to be 

adsorbed as a thicker layer, forming loopier-type structures [48,49]. Since ELR-RGD is a modified 

version of the basic repeating block of elastin with charged amino acids, CHI appears as the most 

charged polymer, as already presented by the ?-potential measurements. Furthermore, the thickness 

increase of each layer displayed in Figure Figure 8.2b helps to demonstrate that the ELR-RGD layers are 

overall thicker than the ones of CHI. Thus, the surface properties of the CHI layer may reflect the effect 

of the underlying ELR one, even in terms of wettability, while the opposite does not occur. 

The featured films were conceived using a recombinant ELR, a biomaterial exhibiting stimuli-responsive 

properties in solution. It would be interesting to observe how the wettability of the films behaves when 

they are exposed to several stimuli. To achieve this goal, we have measured the contact angles of 5 

pairs of layers ending in ELR-RGD, labeled (CHI/ELR-RGD)5, assembled in glass substrates, at different

values of temperature, pH, and ionic strength (using NaCl as the ionic component). After the assembly, 

the coatings were placed at different conditions of each studied stimulus (taking 25 ºC, pH 7.4, and 

ionic strength of 0.15 M as starting values), in order to determine if their variation triggers a transition 

that could be detected by differences in wettability. Figure 8.4 shows the contact angle values 

measured upon cyclic variations of temperature (25ºC to 50ºC), pH (7.4 to 11) and ionic strength 

(0.15 M to 1.25 M).

Figure 8.4. Contact angle measurements as a function of temperature (?), pH (?), and ionic strength 

(?) in a (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 film. Three cycles are represented. Error bars represent two standard 

deviations (n=9). 

 

Taking the case of the temperature, at 25ºC an initial wettability exhibiting values of 67.1±4.7º was 

measured, corresponding to a moderate hydrophobic surface. However, upon increasing the 

temperature to 50ºC, the contact angle values decreased to those of a superhydrophilic surface, 

corresponding to a totally wettable surface. ELRs show a phase transition in solution above Tt, similar to 

the transition of other temperature-sensitive polymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST). 

However, the hydrophobicity of such a surface did not increase with the switch to high temperatures. In 

fact, while the hydrophobicity of surfaces modified with LCST polymers increases [9], the behavior of 

ELRs when adsorbed onto a surface is opposite to the expected, more in accordance to the case of 

polymers with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which become more hydrophilic [50]. 

Such atypical wettability behavior of ELR-RGD temperature-responsive coatings has been previously 

observed in a thin ELR monolayer adsorbed onto CHI substrates [30]. We have shown that upon the 

transition, the collapsed biopolymer aggregates into micelle-like structures, as suggested by topography

measurements. They assume a conformation where the hydrophobic chains are directed to the inside 

and the charged residues to the outside of such organizations. Additionally, while the properties of such 

surfaces change at 50ºC, the polymer in solution shows a transition at 23ºC, where the association is 

much more facilitated than at the surface, to which the polymer is tightly connected. 

Similar results to that of temperature response were obtained for pH and ionic strength, and even 

exhibiting similar contact angle values. In the case of pH, ELR-RGD has lysines in its structure, which 

amine groups are protonated below the pKa values ranging 9.4–10.6 [43]. Above the pKa, the amine 

groups are deprotonated and the hydrophobicity of ELR-RGD increases. It is known that the more 

hydrophobic the ELR the lower the Tt in solution is [34]. Thus, with the increase of pH, the mean 

hydrophobicity of ELR-RGD also increases, up to a pH of 11. At this value, the transition to a 

superhydrophilic regimen was detected, as depicted in Figure 8.4. In the case of ionic strength, 

Reguera et al. [51] suggested that an increase in the salt concentration increases the polarity of the 

solvent. This creates a higher difference in polarity with respect to the hydrophobic moieties of the 

polymer, causing more and more ordered structures surrounding the polymer chains. As observed, a 

transition was detected upon the increase of ionic strength to 1.25 M, which is in accordance to the 

behavior of this family of polymers. These results show that the wettability of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films are 

strongly dependent not only on temperature but also on pH and ionic strength, which influence the Tt of 

ELRs in aqueous solutions as well. Furthermore, the films were submitted to three cycles of variations 

and still retained full reversibility and similar contact angle values, showing that the films are robust and 

capable of withstanding sharp changes of the environment, while retaining functionality. 

The results presented so far reflect the nature of the studied ELR, and characterize the conceived film 

as a stimuli-sensitive coating that could prove to be useful in the development of controlled release 

systems and in surfaces capable to control cell behavior. In order to have full understanding of this 

behavior, the wettability was further studied for several arrays of conditions, consisting in the 

combination of pH and ionic strength, at three relevant temperatures: 25ºC (room temperature), 37ºC 

(temperature of the body), and 50ºC (determined to be the temperature of transition of ELR-RGD at the 

surface). The diagram of Figure 8.5 is the graphical representation of the measurements performed in 

(CHI/ELR-RGD)5, in an attempt to characterize the coating wettability.

Figure 8.5. Map of the wettability of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films as a function of condition arrays of 

temperature, pH, and ionic strength stimuli. Open symbols stand for a moderate hydrophobic surface 

(contact angle of about 67º) and closed ones for a superhydrophilic surface. The blue squares 

represent measurements performed at 25ºC and 37ºC and the red circles measurements at 50ºC. 

 

To our knowledge, this is the first time that ELR-adsorbed surfaces are extensively characterized for 

their responsive character towards external stimuli. There are two areas represented, or phases: (i) one 

represented by open squares and full circles and (ii) the other represented by full squares and full 

circles. Blue squares and red circles stand for 25ºC/37ºC and 50ºC, and open/full symbols stand for a 

moderate hydrophobic (characteristic CA of 66.8±3.5º) or a completely wettable surface, respectively. 

The measurements performed have revealed the conditions of wettability transition for temperature, pH, 

and ionic strength: 50ºC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. The transition was also revealed to be rapid and 

independent of the contribution of the other stimuli: an “all-or-nothing” response towards external 

stimuli. In other words, the wettability of these systems shifts from a moderate hydrophobic regimen to 

superhydrophilic only when a stimulus equals or exceeds the above mentioned values, and there is no 

evidence of cross-dependencies between the three variables. Therefore, observing Figure 8.5, one can 

easily identify the parameters of transition at room temperature and 50ºC. In the former, the wettability 

shifts at pH 11 or ionic strength 1.25 M, as previously stated; in the latter, 50ºC is already the 

temperature at which the wettability shifts, therefore any combination of the other two stimuli can be 

disregarded.

The measurements performed at 37ºC are of particular interest for biomedical applications, since 

ultimately these coatings are intended to be used in a biological environment. In the graphic, the 

wettability of the surfaces at 37ºC is similar to the case at room temperature, showing transitions 

dependent on pH and ionic strength at 11 and 1.25 M, respectively. However, our measurements 

showed that in the range of pH 10–11 and of ionic strength 1–1.25 M, intermediate values could be 

observed (CAs of 30.5 ±20.6º). Such behavior is an interesting one: upon heating an ELR in solution 

above the Tt, aggregation occurs and the solution becomes cloudy; given a few hours, or further 

increasing the temperature, the aggregates gradually settle and the result is a clean phase separation of 

solvent and polymer [52]. At the studied surfaces, the equivalent to this “cloudy point” could only be 

observed for this small range of values and the wettability shift is only fully achieved – and quickly, not 

gradually as in solution – for pH 11 and ionic strength 1.25 M, as is the case at room temperature. 

Thus, the diagram summarizes the response of the films ending in ELR-RGD as a function of three 

distinct variables, showing an independent and immediate effect of three of the parameters influencing 

the conformation of ELRs. 

The molecular organization of a surface may give valuable information about the physical properties of 

a substrate. Figure 8.6 shows the surface roughness for the 5
th

 pair of layers assembled in glass, 

ending in either CHI (layer 9) or ELR-RGD (layer 10), and AFM images of (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 films at 

physiological and transition pH values. An approach similar to that of contact angle measurement was 

followed: the samples were placed at room temperature in PBS buffered at two distinct pHs – 7.4 and 

11 – and withdrawn for immediate topography image acquisition. We expected that with increasing pH 

the surface roughness would increase as well, due to the triggering mechanism of CHI and ELR-RGD 

transitions above each pKa. The AFM images in Figure 8.6 show the topography changes of (CHI/ELR-

RGD)5 and reveal the formation of large and compact structures upon the aggregation of ELRs at the 

surface – “micelle-like” structures which  increases the water affinity at the interface by the exposure of 

hydrophilic groups. In fact, such organization is predicted even by the earliest theories of the natural 

elastin conformation [53].

The analysis of the roughness showed that it increased with pH, from 3.6±0.3 nm to 4.9±0.3 nm ((root-

mean-square roughness, RMS), showing that the topography of the films responded to pH changes, 

regardless of the last adsorbed layer. As a side note, the corresponding contact angle of the (CHI/ELR-

RGD)4CHI films displayed a value of 64.3±3.6º upon increasing the pH, higher than the value obtained 

for layer 9 due to the deprotonation of CHI. Such result reinforces the fact that the properties of a 

modified surface reflect mainly those of the material present at the interface, as is often expected upon 

after such approach. The effect of pH on roughness was greater when the last layer was composed of 

ELR-RGD, as evidenced by the higher values displayed at each condition. Such structural changes were 

more visible when the ELR-RGD is deposited as the last layer, since the macromolecular segments 

exhibit more degrees of freedom for conformational rearrangements. “pH” and ionic strength may 

influence the electrostatic interactions between each layer but similar results were obtained for 

temperature changes. We suggest that such similar results evidence that the aggregation of the ELR is 

the factor that contributes the most to the increase of roughness. Similar results were also obtained in 

previous studies [30]. 

The rough character of the surface also contributes to the atypical extreme hydrophilic nature of the 

substrate, based on a simple lotus effect. In fact, the Wenzel model predicts that the change from a

hydrophobic surface towards a more hydrophilic one is amplified in substrates exhibiting nano/micro 

scale roughness [54]. 

8.3.3 Cell culture studies of SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells 

Smart surfaces have been used in different fields in situations where it is relevant to control the 

adhesion of cells or microorganisms, protein adsorption or transport properties for the release of 

bioactive agents. In many cases, it is desirable that the substrate interacts favorably with cells. It has 

been reported that the RGD sequence is the minimal sequence required for recognition by cell 

membrane integrins, such as ?5?1 and ?V?3 integrins [55-57]. The affinity of cells for materials should 

be improved with the incorporation of a peptide having this sequence. 

So far, we have been able to expand the concept of LbL to a class of materials that is not commonly 

used in literature. We also presented results showing that the films display distinct properties for 

different conditions of temperature, pH and ionic strength. This feature could be exploited to modulate 

protein and cell adhesion by playing with one of the mentioned stimuli. Unfortunately, the presented 

transition values are simply not suitable for most biological applications. We expect to take advantage 

on the recombinant nature of ELRs in the near future to produce films that could be triggered at lower 

values. Nonetheless, the biological performance of the current films was analyzed in order to determine 

if this kind of multilayer film is suitable for future tissue engineering devices with good response from 

cells, without any hazardous reaction. 

In vitro studies were performed using SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells. Although other possibilities could be 

explored, one of the uses we envisaged for these coatings is in orthopedic applications in order to 

improve host integration. To prove that the superior cell attachment was due to a specific interaction 

with RGD, the cell behavior was compared to surfaces with a negative control of ELR containing a 

scrambled RDG sequence, labeled RDG
(-)

, in the form of 5 bilayers with CHI, (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)5. The 

scrambled RDG sequence has been previously shown to have significantly less cellular adhesion [58] 

and is similar to ELR-RGD in all aspects, except for the position of the G and D aminoacids. 

The SaOs-2 cell viability on ELR-RGD and CHI ending films – (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 and (CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI 

respectively – was assessed at different time points. Independently of the wettability changes of the 

coatings, cell culture was performed at 37ºC, at which the surface is moderately hydrophobic (see 

Figure 8.5), under serum-free conditions. Cell viability and activity was assessed through MTS and ALP

assays. A qualitative evaluation of the cell number attached to the surfaces was performed using optic 

microscopy and with DAPI and phalloidin staining of cells. 

Figure 8.7a shows the MTS assay in the different surfaces after 4 h, 24 h and 3 days (note: contact 

angles showed that the films still retain their properties during the studied time-frame).

Data are means±SD (n=3; *p&lt;0.05). 

 

The results show that, for every time point, all tested samples are non-cytotoxic towards the SaOs-2 cell 

line, and therefore the materials used to construct the multilayers did not cause toxicity problems 

neither to the attached cells nor to the cells suspended in culture. Among the various biological 

functions of osteoblasts, secretion of ALP is an important indicator determining the activity of the cells. 

The statistical analysis of the data (Figure 8.7b) shows significant differences in SaOs-2 activity adhered 

to (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 in comparison to (CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI coatings, at 4 h, and (CHI/ELR-RDG

(CHI/ELR-RGD)4/CHI at 24 h. After 3 days the differences in cell activity become more evident in the 

surface with ELR-RGD in comparison to films ending in ELR-RDG
(-)

 or CHI. 

Differences in the number of cells attached to the different surfaces were also observed, as seen in 

Figure 8.8.

Comparing the microscopy images, after 4 h of incubation, ELR-RGD surfaces show a significant 

attached number of cells, compared with non-modified surfaces or the negative analog RDG. Based on 

the cell densities of the samples at 24 hours and 3 days, it is possible to verify that (CHI/ELR-RGD)5 

coatings demonstrated a very significant cell proliferation in comparison to the coatings ending in CHI 

and in (RDG)
(-)

. Besides the higher number of cells on the surfaces with RGD, cells seeded on those 

substrates spread significantly more than the ones on chitosan or the negative control. Thicker and well 

organized filamentous actin bundles were observed in cells growing on RGD surfaces. From our results, 

adsorption of ELR-RGD has shown to enhance cell adhesion and activity when compared to the CHI-

ending films substrates and the scrambled RDG sequence, showing good in vitro performance of the 

presented films.

8.4 Conclusions 

Our results show that ELRs containing biologically relevant peptide sequences can be successfully 

combined with CHI in a sequential multilayer approach based on electrostatic and hydrophobic 

interactions. QCM-D results allowed us to study the construction of the polymeric films and its 

properties, showing the buildup of a film with a linear growth. Although glass was used to assemble 

such coatings, it is expected in the future that such straightforward surface modification technique will 

allow us to coat other substrates with more complex geometries, including scaffolds or particles. The 

stimuli-responsive properties of the films were extensively studied, showing acute and independent 

cyclic response towards temperature, pH and ionic strength; the values of transition for each stimulus 

were identified: 50ºC, 11, and 1.25 M, respectively. Below each critical transition point, the surfaces 

were more hydrophobic. Above those, the surface acquired a very hydrophilic character due to the 

biopolymer chain collapse and subsequent exposure of charged residues to the outer region of the 

coating. The transition was also evident in the changes in the topography of the surfaces as we 

increased the pH of the film above the transition values, increasing their roughness due to the 

aggregation of ELR chains on the top layer. 

SaOs-2 osteoblast-like cells were used to test the biological performance of the multilayered system 

studied in vitro of the films. The cells showed increased adhesion and activity with ELR-RGD ending 

coatings, in comparison to the ones ending with both CHI and the non-bioactive ELR-RDG
(-)

. This work 

demonstrates the potential to use natural and nature-inspired macromolecules to modify surfaces 

taking advantage of a simple layer-by-layer technique, which can be further extrapolated to more 

complex devices. The potential of this technology can further stimulate the development of other similar 

biomedical products in the near future, such as devices entirely processed through layer-by-layer for the 

delivery of pharmaceuticals, cell culture or structures for tissue engineering.

Abstract 

Multilayer capsules conceived at the nano- and micro-scales are receiving increasing interest due to 

their potential role as carriers of biomolecules for drug delivery and tissue engineering. Herein we report 

the construction of microcapsules by the sequential adsorption of chitosan and a biomimetic elastin-like 

recombinamer into nanostructured layers on inorganic microparticle templates. The release profile of 

bovine serum albumin, which was studied at 25 and 37°C, shows higher retention and Fickian diffusion 

at physiological temperature. The self-assembled multilayers act as a barrier and allowed for sustained 

release over 14 days. The capsules studied are non-cytotoxic towards L929 cells, thereby suggesting 

multiple applications in the fields of biotechnology and bioengineering, where high control of the delivery 

of therapeutics and growth/differentiation factors is required.

9.1 Introduction 

Recent advances in biomedicine have been driven by the need to develop systems that can effectively 

encapsulate, protect and deliver an active agent with specific kinetics [1-5]. Such need comes at a time 

when various classes of biomolecules of interest for the treatment of several diseases and the 

development of new biomedical devices are becoming widely available. With this increasing availability, 

the use of smart materials to control the delivery and release of specific agents has followed a similar 

trend. 

Ideally, a biomolecule carrier should act as a compartment in which the permeability of a drug to the 

exterior can be tuned as this would allow the release rate to be controlled when concerning both 

therapeutics in traditional drug-delivery applications as well as tissue engineering agents that influence 

the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of macromolecules – 

a simple, versatile and inexpensive surface-engineering technique that can be used, under mild 

conditions, to encapsulate sensitive active agents and biomaterials by either manipulating the 

architecture of a device or by way of external stimuli – is an approach with the potential to address this 

issue. These “capsules” could then deliver the encapsulated agents to the target cells by making use of 

simple release mechanisms into the biological environment [6-9] or by digestion of the cells 

themselves [10-13]. Although often applied to flat surfaces, LbL can be used to coat surfaces with 

complex geometries and shapes and can be extrapolated to three dimensions [14-19]. Hollow 

multilayer capsules are a good example of 3D structures that can act as drug carriers. Inorganic 

particles are typically used as templates for this purpose as they can be chelated under non-aggressive 

conditions [20-22]. The use of LbL techniques will therefore ultimately allow control of both the release 

profile of a specific agent and the permeability of the system by varying the materials and number of 

layers in the capsule architecture. 

The concept of post-construction permeability is of great interest for drug-delivery and tissue-engineering 

applications as a carrier must be able to retain and preserve the drug but also release it when 

necessary and in a controlled fashion. An ability to switch the permeability of a multilayer capsule 

between an “open” and a “closed” state has been demonstrated previously [23-25], but has yet to be 

fully validated. Temperature, for example, has been suggested to be a possible mechanism for post-

loading therapeutic agents using temperatures as high as 50 to 70°C [26-30]. However, such 

temperatures are not suitable for biological applications. Herein we intend to demonstrate the

entrapping properties of self-assembled coatings with varying numbers of nanolayers combined with the 

response of a biocompatible system towards an external temperature-based stimulus. 

In light of the likely benefits of natural and nature-inspired biomaterials combined with stimuli-

responsiveness [31,32], we aimed to construct a new generation of therapeutic containers using a 

multilayer approach. Chitosan (CHI) and a biomimetic elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) – a recombinant 

version of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) – were used as constituents for the microcapsule shell. CHI is a 

well-known natural material with cationic behavior [33]. whereas ELRs are genetically engineered 

polypeptides that mimic natural elastin and exhibit a primary smart response towards temperature. 

These recombinant macromolecules are soluble below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) in 

an aqueous medium, but undergo a phase separation characterized by the dominant presence of 

hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions above it [34-38]. They also allow fine control over the 

peptide structure, thus making it possible to introduce motifs with biological relevance, such as cell-

adhesion and mineralization promoters, into their primary valine-proline-glycine-valine-glycine (VPGVG) 

sequence [14,39,40]. 

The primary structure of the ELR used herein was designed to present a bioactive behavior by the 

inclusion of L-arginine-glycine-L-aspartic acid (RGD) residues, while exploiting the negative aspartic acid 

moieties to enable subsequent self-assembly with chitosan into nanostructured multilayers (schematic 

structure can be found in Supplemental Figure 9.1). The present work focuses on our ability to 

construct CHI/ELR microcapsules and to use the temperature-responsive nature of ELRs to control the 

permeability of engineered multilayer systems. The resulting microcapsules were characterized for their 

encapsulation efficiency of a model protein, namely bovine serum albumin (BSA). The permeability of 

the BSA-loaded microcapsules with a varying number of layers was studied at 25 and 37°C, and the 

biocompatibility of these structures was evaluated in vitro. 

9.2 Experimental section 

9.2.1 Materials for the microcapsule composition 

Medium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma (reference 448877) and purified by a 

series of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, followed by freeze-drying. ELR 

bioproduction was induced using a fermentation process from an Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) 

containing the appropriate expression gene. Subsequent to fermentation, the culture was harvested and

lysed by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate 

was subjected to several cycles of cold and warm centrifugations. The polymer in solution was stored at 

-24°C and then freeze-dried. The detailed methodology has been described previously [35]. 

9.2.2 ELR aggregate-size measurements 

ELR aggregate size was measured using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) in the temperature 

range 25–37°C after stabilization for 5 minutes. Samples were prepared at 300 µg?mL
-1

 in phosphate 

buffer solution (PBS, Sigma reference P4417), pH 7.4. A total of 20 runs were performed for each 

sample to obtain a final average value at constant temperature. 

9.2.3 Entrapment of BSA in calcium carbonate particles 

BSA entrapment was achieved following the method described by She et al. [8]. Thus, to encapsulate 1 

mg of BSA, aqueous solutions of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3 granular, ?99.5%, Sigma 

reference 222321) and calcium chloride (CaCl2 anhydrous powder Reag. Ph Eur, VWR reference 

1.02378.0500) were prepared at 1 M. Co-precipitation of both solutions was performed by adding 100 

µL of Na2CO3 followed by 100 µL of CaCl2 to 200 µL of BSA tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate 

(FITC) (66 kDa, Sigma reference A9771) at 5 mg?mL
-1

 and stirring rapidly for 30 seconds. Stirring was 

then stopped and the suspension of newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles left to 

react and precipitate for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed and the particles washed twice 

with ultrapure water to remove residual salts and non-entrapped protein. Each supernatant was retained 

for fluorescence measurements and determination of entrapment losses. 

9.2.4 Construction of the multilayer shells and microcapsule formation 

The CaCO3 sacrificial templates entrapping FITC-BSA were immersed alternately in chitosan and ELR 

solutions [300 µg?mL
-1

, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of sodium chloride (NaCl, Reag. Ph Eur, Panreac reference 

131659] for 10 min each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5). Centrifugation was avoided to avoid 

damage and aggregation of the particles each time the samples were to be retrieved from solution; 

simple precipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). This process was repeated to 

increase the number of bilayers until the desired coating had been obtained (1, 3 and 5 bilayers). After 

construction, the CaCO3 core was removed by chelation with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA

the delivery of active molecules 

 

314 

powder, ACS reagent, 99.4–100.6%, Sigma reference E9884; 0.2 M, pH 5.5). Each supernatant and 

solution was retained for fluorescence measurements and determination of losses during the 

construction and chelation stages. 

9.2.5 Determination of pre-loading encapsulation efficiency 

Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Synergie HT microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, 

USA). Thus, 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into a white, opaque 96-well plate in triplicate. Distilled 

water was used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) wavelengths used for the calibration 

curve and FITC-BSA mass calculations were 485 and 528 nm, respectively. All supernatants collected 

during entrapment, construction and chelation were measured and quantified. The percentage of 

fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-BSA mass lost was plotted both for each stage and cumulatively. The 

encapsulation efficiency was calculated by subtracting the cumulative losses of each architecture from 

the initial FITC-BSA mass. 

9.2.6 In vitro biological performance 

A murine fibroblast cell line (L929, European Collection of Cell Cultures) was used for the biological 

assays. Thus, L929 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen 

reference 42400-028) with phenol red supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, 

reference 10270-106) and 1% antibiotic/antimicotic (Gibco reference 15240062) in a humidified 

atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37°C. For the cell viability test, 2×10
3
 cells were seeded 

on 48-well plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 24 hours, microcapsules were added to the 

culture medium in a ratio of 40 microcapsules per cell. After each culturing period, samples were 

washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A 250 ?L aliquot of fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free 

culture medium and 50 ?L of (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-

2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) reagent were added to each well. A cell-free well was used as control. Plates 

were incubated for 3 h at 37ºC, 5% CO2, protected from light. After incubation, 100 ?L of this solution 

was transferred to a 96-well plate and the plate read using a Synergie HT microplate ELISA reader 

(BioTek, USA) in 490 nm absorbance mode. 

Visualization of the actin cytoskeleton was performed using (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-

phalloidin (TRITC-phalloidin, Sigma reference P1951). After each culture period, samples were washed 



Chapter 9 – Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for 

the delivery of active molecules 

 

315 

twice with PBS and fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells 

were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin (10 ?g?mL
-1

) for 45 min and washed three times with PBS. To 

stain the nucleus, the cells were incubated with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma reference 

D9564) (1 ?g?mL
-1

) for 5 min then washed with PBS. Cells were observed under an Axioimager Z1M 

Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). 

9.2.7 Quantification of FITC-BSA release 

The microcapsules were resuspended in PBS at either 25 or 37°C. The upper limit of five bilayers for 

the microcapsule architecture was chosen to study the effect of temperature along with small changes 

in the number of different layers. This study was conducted over 14 days, removing the surrounding 

PBS from each container every 24 h. An additional sample was taken after 12 h from the start of the 

study. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, and 100% BSA was considered to be the total mass 

remaining in the microcapsules after their construction. The release experiments were performed under 

mild agitation to improve the diffusion of BSA through the incubating medium. All experiments were 

performed in triplicate (n=3), with each sample containing the number of capsules resulting from the 

attempted encapsulation of 1 mg of BSA. To determine the type of release profile for each condition, 

the release kinetics were determined using the Korsmeyer kinetic model (equation 9.1): 

n
Kt/M

t
M ?

?
 (9.1) 

where Mt /M? is the fraction of protein released at time t, K is the rate constant for the Korsmeyer 

model, and n is the exponent that characterizes the release mechanism [41]. The Korsmeyer model is 

used when the release mechanism from a swellable polymeric device is not well-known or when more 

than one type of release phenomenon could be involved. The fitting was performed for all architectures 

and for each temperature. 

9.2.8 Microscopy characterization of the CaCO3 microparticles and multilayered 

microcapsules 

A Leica Cambridge S360 scanning electron microscope (United Kingdom) was used to evaluate the 

morphology of the sacrificial templates. Specimens were pre-coated with a conductive layer of sputtered 

gold and micrographs recorded at 10 kV. An Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope 

(CLSM, Germany) was used to evaluate the morphology of (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules loaded with FITC-

316 

BSA. A final layer consisting of a cationic dye (rhodamine B, 10
-6

 M) was further adsorbed. All samples 

were stabilized at either 25 or 37°C and observed under hydrated conditions. 

9.3 Results 

In order to evaluate the thermal response of the featured ELR, the size variations of peptide aggregates 

in aqueous solution were measured as a function of temperature. The results, which are plotted in 

Figure 9.1, show an increase in aggregate size from around 10 to 3000 nm in aqueous PBS solution. 

This variation occurs at a Tt of 29°C and is accompanied by an increase in solution turbidity, thus 

showing that this ELR possesses a Tt in solution above the working room temperature and below the 

physiological one of 37°C.

25–37°C. Means±standard deviation (SD) are represented. Insets show a transparent solution below 

29°C and increased turbidity above it. 

 

CaCO3 particles were prepared by co-precipitation of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 solutions under vigorous 

stirring in a BSA medium and subsequently tagged with FITC. The resulting inorganic particles, with a 

diameter of around 5-6 µm (Figure 9.2A), were used as BSA-containing sacrificial templates for the 

alternating incubation with aqueous chitosan and ELR solutions. After construction, the core was 

chelated with EDTA to form hollow microcapsules, as confirmed by CLSM Figure 9.2B).

microcapsule containing FITC-BSA after chelation. (C) A graphic showing the stage losses measured 

during construction of the microcapsules. Data represent mean±SD (n=3; *p&lt;0.05). 

 

Structures with one, three and five bilayers, henceforth referred to as (CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and 

(CHI/ELR)5, were constructed to study the effects of capsule architecture on the subsequent release of 

BSA at 25 and 37°C. In order to determine the total encapsulation efficiency, the fluorescence of each 

supernatant was measured at each stage and the losses calculated with respect to the initial FITC-BSA 

content in the precipitation medium (1 mg). Although a loss of 9% was registered during the entrapment 

stage (Figure 9.2C), losses during the construction stage were higher for capsules with fewer layers. 

The effect of the shell architecture became more evident during the chelation stage, with our 

observations showing a “burst-release” of 13% for (CHI/ELR)1 and 10% for (CHI/ELR)5. 

CLSM images of (Chi/ELR)5 microcapsules at 25 and 37 °C are shown in Figure 3. The capsules are 

significantly smaller at 37 °C (Figure 9.3B, 3.21±0.63 µm) than at 25 °C (Figure 9.3A, 5.51±0.56 

µm), most probably due to a layer rearrangement as a result of the effect of different solvent 

temperatures on the stimuli-responsive ELR molecules.

final layer was tagged with rhodamine B. Right: size distribution and fractional frequency (f ). The 

normal distribution approximation, which fits a 95% confidence interval, is depicted. 

 

The cytotoxicity of these microcapsules was determined to ascertain whether they could be used in 

biological systems. Thus, an in vitro biological evaluation was carried out using the L929 mouse 

fibroblast cell line. The cell viability was assessed by MTS after culture in a microcapsule-containing 

medium (either loaded with BSA or unloaded). The graphic in Figure 9.4A shows a quantitative 

comparison with the lone L929 control and confirms that the cells cultured in the presence of 

(CHI/ELR)5 retained their viability at every time-point (24 h, 3 days and 7 days). Furthermore, 

fluorescence microscopy of cells cultured in the absence (Figure 9.4B) and presence (Figure 9.4C) of 

BSA-loaded (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules confirmed that the cell morphology remained unchanged when 

in contact with the microcapsules. This was the case for both BSA-loaded and -free microcapsules.

The ability to retain an active agent and protect it until delivery is one of the most important features of 

a drug-delivery system. Our results showed BSA retentions of greater than 70% of the initial 1 mg after 

construction of the microcapsules, with cumulative losses of 28%, 26% and 25% for (Chi/ELR)1, 

(CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5, respectively (see Figure 9.2C for stage losses, and Supplemental Figure 

9.3 and Supplemental Table 9.1 for detailed cumulative calculations). However, an ability to release this 

active agent in a controlled manner after encapsulation is equally important. As such, the influence of 

the total number of layers and temperature on the release profile of BSA from the capsules was 

investigated. BSA release at different temperatures was studied over a period of 14 days, and the 

cumulative release profiles for (CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5 capsules loaded with BSA at 

room (25°C) and physiological temperatures (37°C) can be seen in Figure 9.5.

During this sub-study, 100% of BSA was considered to be the total mass remaining in the 

microcapsules after their construction. The estimated number of microcapsules in each tested sample 

was approximately 8×10
8
, as calculated by dividing the volume occupied by the precipitated 

microcapsules (around 70 ?L) and the volume occupied by a single microcapsule (diameter of 

5.51 ?m), disregarding the empty spaces between them. PBS was fully refreshed at each time point, in 

order to simulate a biological environment in which the delivered therapeutic agent is taken up by the 

targeted cells. Irrespective of the temperature and number of layers, an initial analysis of the profiles 

shows that BSA release is sustained over the period studied, with a visible absence of significant burst 

release at the initial time-points. The release kinetics were markedly influenced by the temperature (see 

rate constants, K, in Table 9.1), with smaller quantities of released FITC-BSA being detected from 

microcapsules incubated at 37°C. In the case of the more permeable (CHI/ELR)1 capsules, these 

structures showed a cumulative release of 79% at 25°C after 14 days in PBS, while a value of 52% was 

obtained at 37°C. The same trend was observed for (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5. 

Release was also dependent on the number of layers in the capsule architecture. Thus, irrespective of 

the temperature, more layers resulted in greater BSA retention. This finding confirms the shell’s ability 

to act as a tunable barrier against the diffusion of an encapsulated agent. The Fickian or non-Fickian 

release behavior of BSA was given by the exponent of the Korsmeyer kinetics model, n, shown in Table 

9.1.

Fitting with other models (zero-order, first-order and Higuchi) can be found in the Supplementary 

Information (Supplemental Figure 9.6 to Supplemental Figure 9.11). The data for capsules incubated at 

25°C fit an anomalous (non-Fickian) mode of diffusion (n &gt; 0.43), thus suggesting a combination of 

pure protein diffusion and shell relaxation/swelling mechanisms under these conditions. The 

(CHI/ELR)5 capsules were an exception to this, with a Fickian mode of diffusion (n &amp;lt;0.43). The 

capsules also follow a Fickian diffusion model at 37°C. In comparison to the capsules at 25°C, a pure 

diffusion mechanism occurs under physiological conditions. This effect results from the restructuration 

of the film which occurs upon deposition of each additional layer [42]. The result is a more densely 

packed multilayer structure with decreasing polymeric mobility and no anomalous relaxation/swelling 

mechanism, together with a more compact and stable shell. 

9.4 Discussion 

The development of drug-delivery systems that can encapsulate, protect and deliver a therapeutic 

molecule or growth factor in a controlled fashion is of major importance for both current healthcare 

applications and in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Herein we have exploited 

temperature and the smart response of ELRs as an actual drug-release mechanism for a pre-

encapsulated model protein. Furthermore, our aim was to develop a system that is able to respond at a 

temperature which will be useful for future applications in human biological studies. 

We have conceived and developed biocompatible thermoresponsive microcapsules by taking advantage 

of the self-assembly properties of chitosan and an ELR using a multilayer approach. The fact that the 

majority of LbL studies performed to date have involved conventional polyelectrolytes has hindered the 

extrapolation of this technology to systems exhibiting other capabilities and complexities, including those 



Chapter 9 – Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for 

the delivery of active molecules 

 

322 

that could respond to external stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that, unlike most conventional 

multilayer combinations, combining these two materials is more favorable when both electrostatic and 

hydrophobic interactions are exploited, thus allowing for the construction of films as thin as 40 nm 

(considering a total of five bilayers) [43]. This is feasible if construction is performed under conditions 

close to the pKa of the polysaccharide, where both protonated and deprotonated groups can be used. 

Our results, especially those observed in CLSM (Figure 9.2B and Figure 9.3), demonstrate that it is 

possible to extrapolate this technology from 2D to 3D and to construct micrometric devices using a non-

conventional combination of polymers. 

In order to determine the pre-encapsulation efficiency (see Figure 9.2C), all three construction stages 

were screened for each architecture [(CHI/ELR)1, (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ELR)5]. There was no 

difference between any of the cases studied during the entrapment stage. Note that at this stage the 

shell has not yet been assembled, thus meaning that the encapsulation efficiency is solely dependent 

on the protein/CaCO3 interaction, which at this point in the process is common for all groups. In the 

following construction stage, and in contrast to our expectations, the losses were higher for thinner 

capsules. As more adsorption steps and manipulation are involved as construction proceeds, we 

expected to find higher protein losses for (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules since BSA should diffuse 

continuously from the sacrificial core, even if only in insignificant quantities. The explanation for our 

finding may reside in the fact that the protein lost to the polymer incubation solutions may be retaken 

up during the addition of subsequent layers to the shell. Indeed, using CLSM we were able to identify a 

high concentration of FITC-BSA near the capsule shell (see Figure 9.2B). As for the chelation stage, 

although there is a statistically significant difference between (CHI/ELR)1 and (CHI/ELR)3, the 

numerical difference is not meaningful (12.7% vs. 11.3%, respectively). Thicker capsules are also able 

to retain more protein than those with a lower number of bilayers since multilayer shells can act as 

barriers that hinder the diffusion of molecules from the inner cavity to the surrounding medium [8]. 

The microcapsules described herein have been shown to undergo temperature-dependent size 

variations, with two possible shrinkage mechanisms explaining the shrinkage observed upon increasing 

the temperature. Thus, as discussed previously, the ELR collapses to a more ordered, self-assembled 

state upon increasing temperature above Tt [35-37], although it is also likely that shrinkage is further 

amplified by a thermodynamic rearrangement of the layers. Such a rearrangement is driven by the 

tendency of shells with an even number of layers (1:1 ratio of electrostatic forces) to minimize the

the delivery of active molecules 

 

323 

shell/water interface [30]. This is the same mechanism used for post-loading procedures, which have 

been reported to take place at typical temperatures in the range 50–70°C [27-30]. 

Despite the fact that such structures have been reported to respond to temperature changes, this has 

only been applied as a means to post-encapsulate molecules within pre-formed microcapsules. 

However, other than the exploitation of post-encapsulation procedures, the temperatures required for 

this are not suitable for biological applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that 

such a significant size reduction has been observed at temperatures as low as 37°C. For example, 

using oppositely charged copolymers of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) 

(PAH) with poly(N -isoproprylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), Glinel et al. [27] have reported a size reduction of 

only 15% at 60 °C, whereas the present work shows a reduction of 42% at 37°C. Furthermore, these 

microcapsules retain a temperature response over a relevant temperature range and the changes occur 

under physiological conditions, similar to what has been demonstrated for the ELR in solution (Figure 

9.1). These results allow us to anticipate future applications in the field of biomedicine in areas such as 

drug delivery, cell/tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. 

In order to be used in biomedicine, it was important to assess whether the microcapsules and their 

content were harmful to cells. The biological performance in vitro is presented in Figure 9.4. This study 

showed that the viability of L929 cells in contact with the capsules (loaded and unloaded) was 

comparable to those used as positive control. The morphology of lone L929 cells and cells in contact 

with loaded (CHI/ELR)5 microcapsules was also similar. These results show that these structures are 

non-cytotoxic towards L929 cells and can therefore be safely used in biomedical applications. Such 

applications could include the simple release of a biomolecule from a drug release device, with the 

microcapsules being compacted to form a tablet that can be administered orally. Since these 

microcapsules are highly retentive at physiological temperatures, they could release specific active 

agents in quantities within a therapeutic time window. Further possibilities include transcutaneous 

vaccines for the delivery of biomolecules into the skin, and the local application or injection of 

microcapsules loaded with growth factors at a defect site in a tissue or organ to facilitate its 

regeneration. This site could also be a tumor, with low molecular weight anti-cancer drugs being loaded 

into these reservoirs to kill tumor cells [44]. It should be noted that the temperature at tumor sites is 

usually slightly higher than 37°C and hyperthermic treatments are used to further increase the 

temperature locally. For the specific use of these microcapsules in cancer treatments, experiments at 

slightly higher temperatures (e.g., up to 42°C) using low molecular weight molecules (most 



Chapter 9 – Nanostructured and thermoresponsive recombinant biopolymer-based microcapsules for 

the delivery of active molecules 

 

324 

chemotherapeutic drugs have low molecular weights) should be performed in the future. Growth factors, 

which tend to have a higher molecular weight than chemotherapeutic agents, are also of interest for 

tissue-engineering applications, where they could be used in vitro to control cell metabolism and 

proliferation and to trigger stem cell differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, around 40 

kDa), for example, has shown great potential in angiogenesis, one of the most relevant mechanisms in 

tissue-engineering applications. Similarly, human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, around 20-30 

kDa) is one of the most active factors in cell migration and differentiation. However, the success of 

these growth factors in therapeutic applications often requires a spatiotemporal controlled-release 

system for delivery [45]. This could be achieved by diffusion of the encapsulated load into the medium 

and by internalization of individual capsules by the cells. The latter case would require the cells 

concerned to be larger than the individual microcapsules. We did not observe the uptake of capsules by 

L929 cells in this study, most probably because the size difference between L929 (around 5 to 10 µm) 

and microcapsules at 37°C (3.21±0.63 µm, Figure 9.3B) is too small for such a phenomenon to occur. 

In contrast, some stem cells, such as adipose stem cells, may reach 50 µm, thus meaning that 

applications which envisage their differentiation may be exploited in the future using this kind of 

micrometric device. 

Figure 9.5 shows the BSA-release properties of microcapsules with different numbers of layers at 

distinct temperatures, together with the Korsmeyer model fitting parameters calculated in Table 9.1. It 

should be noted that these systems were not designed to operate in an “on/off” basis, such as when 

exploiting a temperature-dependent post-loading approach, but rather to achieve distinct release profiles 

that could prove to be useful for the sustained release of molecules in the body or in vitro. 

The permeability of BSA to the exterior was easily tuned by varying the number of layers. Thus, similarly 

to the chelation stage during construction, the multilayer shell was able to act as a more effective 

barrier as the number of layers in it increased, thus allowing for a more sustained release and retentive 

microcapsule. The results obtained at 25 and 37°C were also interesting as the capsules proved to be 

more retentive at the latter. These results relate well with the size variations observed in Figure 9.3: the 

thermoresponsive effect of the CHI/ELR microcapsules results in a reduction in both their size and their 

permeability, thus making them more retentive. It is notable that, regardless of the test conditions, 

100% of the BSA contained in the microcapsules was not released, most likely due to an interaction 

between the protein and the nanostructured shell. It is possible that a combination with enzymatic

the delivery of active molecules 

 

325 

degradation, a mechanism which has been used previously [6,46,47], could lead to total release of the 

load. However, such a study was outside the scope of this work. 

9.5 Conclusion 

In summary, size and permeability variations have been achieved by exploiting the temperature 

response of the ELR, which is amplified by a thermodynamic rearrangement of the multilayer structure 

at the molecular level. The use of different numbers of layers has allowed the permeability of the shells 

to be tuned, thus resulting in distinct release profiles for each architecture tested. We envisage the 

exploitation of these properties at physiological temperature for applications where a long-term release 

with low initial drug burst is desired. Similarly, the degradation mechanisms of a cellular environment 

can be simulated to release an active agent completely over the appropriate time period. Due to 

micrometric size of these capsules, delivering small quantities of growth factors or differentiation agents 

directly to the cells by digestion is envisaged. The genetically encoded nature of ELRs offers the 

possibility to engineer molecules containing biologically relevant motifs that could be recognized by 

specific cells, such as the present case of RGD inclusion. All these possibilities, together with their non-

cytotoxic character, make these microcapsules a promising alternative for more highly effective drug 

delivery and tissue engineering.

Abstract 

Multilayered microcapsules of chitosan and biomimetic elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were 

prepared for intracellular delivery of active agents. Two ELRs containing either the bioactive RGD 

sequence or a scrambled nonfunctional RDG were used to construct two types of functionalized 

polymeric microcapsules, both with spherical shape around 4 ?m in diameter. Cell viability studies 

using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were performed for microcapsule/cell ratios between 

5:1 and 100:1. After 3 and 72 hours of incubation no cytotoxicity was found. Nonetheless, cells 

incubated with RGD-functionalized microcapsules exhibited higher mean viability values than RDG ones. 

Internalization efficacy and bioavailability of encapsulated proteins was assessed by monitoring 

fluorescence changes of DQ-ovalbumin. The data showed that microcapsules’ surface functionalization 

did not influence significantly the internalization by hMSCs, although DQ-ovalbumin was degraded faster 

from within RGD-functionalized microcapsules. The developed microcapsules let foresee strategies for 

targeting intracellular drug delivery and to increase drug efficacy.

10.1 Introduction 

In the field of drug delivery, there has been great interest in the development of nano- and micro-

carriers of active agents, such as micelles, liposomes, polymersomes, and polymer capsules [1-3]. 

Such devices may control the release of encapsulated biomolecules and also their efficacy by delivering 

them to the location where they are most needed. In particular, the use of nanostructured nano- and 

micro-capsules made using layer-by-layer (LbL) strategies has been studied as a method to encapsulate 

and deliver drugs in a controlled manner [4-8]. The principle behind LbL adsorption lies in the existence 

of intermolecular interactions attracting distinct polymer chains, such as electrostatic contacts, 

hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding, which drive the assembly of layers with only a few 

nanometers onto a surface [9-11]. With this simple and versatile technique, robust coatings can be 

assembled into bidimensional templates and even complex three-dimensional substrates. For instance, 

spherical nanostructured microcapsules have been conceived resorting to sacrificial silica (with 500 nm 

to 5 µm, dissolved in hydrogen fluoride) and porous calcium carbonate particles (with 3 to 5 µm, 

dissolved in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, EDTA) [12]. These structures have already been found to 

be useful as drug carriers – including of stem cell differentiation promoters – with release kinetics 

dependent on the number of layers or external stimuli, and as biosensors [13-15]. 

Multilayer microcapsules may encapsulate and deliver bioactive agents to cells or tissues following 

conventional release mechanisms to the biological environment [16] or by digestion within the cells 

themselves [17]. The latter possibility is particularly interesting: by delivering an active agent directly to 

the cells, where the whole metabolic machinery is found, high drug concentrations could be made 

available to the targeted tissue using minimal cargo amounts during its encapsulation. Moreover, it 

could also be possible to circumvent undesirable side effects to circumventing tissues or cells due to 

premature drug leakage. 

Carriers such as dendrimers, micelles and biodegradable nanoparticles have been frequently developed 

for the intracellular delivery of bioactive agents [18-21]. As carriers, multilayer-coated capsules present 

several advantages that are not often found together in other conventional fabrication techniques: (i) 

they can be prepared under mild conditions, what makes it possible for large amounts of sensitive or 

easily denatured biological molecules [22] and even cells [23] to be encapsulated, (ii) it is possible to 

encapsulate drugs with low water solubility [5], (iii) they allow controlling better the release kinetics by 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically

varying the number of layers and their composition [24], and (iv) the shell can provide a high degree of 

functionality by selecting biofunctional constituents that may participate in biological mechanisms [25]. 

The primary objective of the present work is the design of multilayer microcapsules made of natural and 

nature-inspired macromolecules exhibiting bioactive sequences for intracellular drug delivery. Namely, 

chitosan (CHI) and elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were used as constituents of the multilayer shells 

which were assembled onto spherical particles of calcium carbonate. CHI is a well-known polycationic 

polysaccharide of marine origin which shows biocompatibility, adhesiveness and nontoxicity, as well as 

bacteriostatic, fungistatic, anti-microbial and hemostatic activities [26]. ELRs, a recombinant type of 

elastin-like polymers (ELP), are temperature-responsive and biomimetic polypeptides that are soluble in 

aqueous media below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) but undergo a phase separation 

above it [27]. Their recombinant and modular nature is most likely their most attractive property 

because it allows tuning their physicochemical properties and introducing selected relevant amino acid 

domains to extend their physiological functionality [28,29]. LbL adsorption can be exploited using ELRs 

alongside polysaccharides, such as CHI and alginate, by taking advantage of strong electrostatic 

interactions and the stabilizing effect of weaker hydrophobic interactions [30]. 

Herein, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were incubated with ELR-functionalized 

microcapsules with the cell adhesion motif arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). The inclusion of the 

loop RGD motif of the human structural protein fibronectin in the primary structure of the ELR was 

expected to add bioactive character to the microcapsules, while exploiting the negatively charged 

aspartic acids to enable the electrostatic self-assembly mechanism with CHI to occur. It has been 

reported that the RGD sequence is the minimal sequence required for recognition by the cell adhesion 

receptor integrins [31].  It is also known that nano/micro-particles modified with RGD show enhanced 

internalization [32-34]. However, this comparison is often made with unmodified  controls, that is, do 

not undergo any functionalization. Therefore, in addition to RGD, we also constructed microcapsules 

functionalized with an ELR containing a nonfunctional scrambled RDG sequence. To our knowledge, this 

is the first time that the internalization efficacy of RGD-functionalized LbL microcapsules is compared 

with a microcapsule type that substitutes the bioactive group with a nonfunctional analogue, similar in 

every aspect except for the position of the G and D residues, instead of removing it. 

The resulting microcapsules will be characterized in terms of morphology, and cytotoxicity after 

incubation with hMSCs. The internalization efficacy of the microcapsules will be quantified by flow 

cytometry in order to identify the existence – or absence – of a receptor-mediated uptake and 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules 

 

341 

consequent influence in the intracellular processing between each microcapsule type. Furthermore, 

Capsules loaded with DQ-ovalbumin will permit to follow the availability of this protein inside the cells by 

monitoring the fluorescence changes of the capsules. 

10.2 Experimental section 

10.2.1 Materials 

Medium molecular weight chitosan (ref 448877), sodium carbonate anhydrous (Na2CO3, ref 222321) 

and EDTA (ref E9884) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chitosan was further submitted to a 

purification stage consisting in a series of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, adapted 

from the method described elsewhere [30], followed by freeze-drying. The final degree of deacetylation 

was determined to be 82% by 
1
H-NMR. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) was purchased from VWR (ref 

1.02378.0500). Two custom-made ELRs containing either a RGD or RDG sequence – henceforth 

referred to as ELR-RGD and ELR-RDG
(-)

, respectively – were purchased from Technical Protein 

Nanobiotechnology (Spain). The characterization of the molecular weight and amino acid composition of 

the acquired batches were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass 

spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and amino acid content analysis, respectively, and can be found 

elsewhere [25]. DQ-ovalbumin (ref D12053) was obtained from Invitrogen. 

Paraformaldehyde (ref P6148), Triton X-100 (ref T9284) and Accutase
TM

 (ref A6964) were purchased 

from Sigma-Aldrich. Human mesenchymal stem cells from human adipose tissue, (hMSCs, ref R7788-

115) its basal medium, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ref 31966-021), fetal bovine 

serum (FBS, ref 16000-044), penicillin streptomycin solution (ref SV30010), trypsin-ethylenediamine 

tetraacetic acid (EDTA, ref SV30010), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, ref 14190-136), 

4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, ref 15630049), Trypan Blue stain 0.4% (ref 

15250061), Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (ref A12379), LIVE/DEAD
®
 Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit, for 

mammalian cells (ref L3224), Alamar Blue

10.2.2 Measurement of the charges 

The ?-potentials of the ELRs were determined using a Nano-ZS equipment from Malvern (United 

Kingdom), at 25ºC. Aqueous solutions of each ingredient in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4) 

were used, at a concentration of 300 ?g?mL
-1

. 

10.2.3 Synthesis of calcium carbonate sacrificial templates 

Aqueous solutions Na2CO3 and CaCl2 were prepared at a concentration of 1 M. Typically, the 

coprecipitation of both solutions was performed by adding 1 mL of Na2CO3 solution followed by 1 mL of 

CaCl2 to 4 mL of ultrapure water (Milli-Q) under heavy stirring for 30 s. The stirring was then stopped 

and the suspension of the newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles was left to 

precipitate and react for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the particles were washed three 

times with 0.15 M sodium chloride (NaCl) adjusted to pH 5.5. To produce microcapsules preloaded 

with a protein cargo, the medium where the precipitation occurs consisted of an aqueous solution of 

DQ-ovalbumin at a concentration of 160 ?g?mL
-1

. Unless otherwise stated, all changes of solutions 

during the template synthesis and construction of microcapsules were performed by leaving the particle 

suspension precipitating for 10 min, followed by removal of the supernatant and replacement with the 

next solution – polymeric or for washing. 

10.2.4 Construction of the multilayer shells and microcapsule formation 

The CaCO3 sacrificial templates were immersed alternately in solutions of CHI and one of the ELRs 

(300 µg?mL
-1

, pH 5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 min under mild stirring. Each adsorption step was followed 

by three washing steps with 0.15 M NaCl, pH 5.5: to disaggregate the substrates, the first was 

accompanied by four sequential ultrasound pulses of 3 seconds each, with the following being just 

rinsed. This process was repeated until 2 CHI/ELR bilayers were assembled. After the construction of 

the multilayers, the CaCO3 core was dissolved by EDTA, at 0.2 M, pH 5.5. From this point on, the 

precipitation of the microcapsules was aided by centrifugation steps (1000 rpm, 25 min) and 

ultrasound pulses timed as described above. The newly formed hollow microcapsules then followed a 

washing procedure with EDTA (0.2 M, pH 7.4) and four with ultrapure water. The microcapsules were 

stored at room temperature until use for a maximum of 24 h in a renewed medium of ultrapure water. 

In the case of microcapsules intended for cellular assays – loaded with DQ-ovalbumin – DMEM was 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules 

 

343 

used for the washings and storage instead of water. The microcapsule production yield resulting from 

the mixture of 1 mL of Na2CO3 and CaCl2 was estimated to be with a total of 1.1×10
6
 microcapsules 

by microscopy observation. 

10.2.5 Characterization of the hybrid microcapsules 

The morphology of the produced microcapsules – designated (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 – 

was determined using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) (FEI Quanta 200FEG). A 

number of 2.2×10
4
 microcapsules suspended in 200 ?L of H2O was placed on top of a silicon wafer 

(1 cm
2
) and dried overnight at 37ºC before the analysis. The samples were placed inside the 

equipment in a platform with a 20º tilt. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained 

using a JEOL JEM-1011 HR instrument operating at 80 kV. Prior to the observation, a number of 10
4
 

microcapsules suspended in 60 ?L of H2O was pipetted onto a TEM grid and left to dry overnight at 

room temperature. A confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Olympus FV1000, Germany) was 

used to evaluate the morphology of the microcapsules. For this, a final solution of a cationic dye 

(rhodamine B, 10
-6

 M) was further adsorbed after the normal construction of the microcapsules. All 

samples were stabilized at 37°C and observed under hydrated conditions. The fluorescence intensity 

profiles of 3 distinct microcapsules were plotted using ImageJ software (to assess the formation of 

spherical hollow structures (provided by NIH, version 1.47v). 

10.2.6 Cell culture 

hMSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U?mL

streptomycin replaced every two day and maintained at 37ºC in a 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) humidified 

environmental chamber. Near-confluence cells (passages 2–6) were harvested after enzymatically 

treatment with trypsin/EDTA or Accutase
TM

 and suspended in culture medium, cell counts were 

evaluated using a standard Trypan Blue exclusion assay and seeded at 3×10

 on the diverse 

surfaces utilized and then incubated during 24 hours in standard conditions. Afterwards, the culture 

medium was refreshed by serum-free medium containing a suspension of CHI/ELR microcapsules. 

After 3 h of CHI/ELR microcapsules co-incubation, the cultures were maintained for longer times, by 

supplementing the microcapsule suspension with additional fresh medium to reach the final serum 

concentration of 2% FBS.

10.2.7 Cell viability assays 

Metabolic activity was evaluated by Alamar Blue
®
 and cell viability by LIVE/DEAD® assays. The relative 

number of hMSCs metabolically active within each experimental condition was evaluated by the Alamar 

Blue
®
 assay according to the manufacturer guidelines. Briefly, 24 hours after cells seeding, cells culture 

was washed and then (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules in serum-free culture 

medium were added in incremental ratios of 5 to 100 microcapsules per cell. After 3 and 72 h of 

microcapsules co-incubation, the fluorimetric reduction of 10% Alamar Blue
®
 reagent in culture medium 

was measured with a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax M2e Molecular Devices). Non-treated cells 

were employed as positive control and their fluorescence was considered as the 100% of cells viability. 

The viability of cells co-incubated with CHI/ELR was also examined by a LIVE/DEAD
®
 assays. Ten 

microcapsules per cell of each CHI/ELR microcapsule type were added to the cell culture. The ratio of 

microcapsules per cell was selected after obtaining the results of the cell viability assays. In this assay, 

the co-incubation with calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 allows distinguishing the cytoplasm of live 

cells (with esterase cleavage of calcein accompanied by green fluorescence), and dead cells (which 

compromised membranes enable to stain nucleic acids with red fluorescence). LIVE/DEAD
®
 assays was 

carried out at different time points (0, 72 and 240 h) according to the manufacturing specifications. 

10.2.8 Statistical analysis 

Values reported reflect means±standard error (SE) of four samples of four independent cell culture 

viability experiments at 3 or 72 hours of incubation. The influence of microcapsules/cell ratio on cell 

viability was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the post test of Bonferroni. All 

treatment-related effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. All data 

was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).  

10.2.9 Internalization and intracellular processing experiments 

hMSCs were seeded on circular cover glasses (diameter: 10 mm; Thermo Scientific CB00100RA1) 

deposited in a 48-well plate and incubated during 24 h in standard conditions. (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and 

(CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules were added to the culture. After 3 or 72 h of incubation, samples 

were washed with DPBS three times.

engineered macromolecules 

 

345 

Samples for microscopy analysis – confocal, phase-contrast, epifluorescence, and differential 

interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (Nomarski) – were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, 

permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with DAPI. A confocal microscope (Leica 

Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH, microscope confocal Leica SP5) was used for analyzing 

microcapsules inside the cells. Z-series were performed with a Z-step of 1 µm. The images of each 

fluorophore and phase contrast were overlaid to obtain a multilayer image using ImageJ software 

(National Institutes of Health). Bright field and fluorescence microscopy were performed in a NIKON 

Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope, equipped with a digital camera system (Digital sight DS-2MBWc), 

using blue, green and red filters.

 treatment – specially developed for gentle and 

effective cell dissociation – were washed, counted, suspended in DPBS, 25 mM HEPES 5% FBS and 

analyzed in a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The assay was repeated three times. All treatment-

related effects were considered to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05. All data was 

analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).  

10.3 Results and discussion 

First, CaCO3 microparticles were coated with two bilayers of chitosan and the ELRs containing either 

the motif RGD or RDG. Hollow capsules were produced by their subsequent incubation with EDTA and 

chelation of the sacrificial core – henceforth referred to as (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 or (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2, 

respectively. The morphology of the microcapsules was evaluated by CLSM and SEM, and the capsules’ 

wall by TEM (Figure 10.1). TEM (Figure 10.1A), which was used solely to observe the wall delimiting the 

interior and exterior of the microcapsules, showed a multilayer shell that could be distinguished at the 

borders of the structure. For the morphological analysis, the samples for microscopy observation were 

prepared at 37ºC.

It is known that this kind of polysaccharide/polypeptide microcapsules experience size variations 

according to the temperature of the incubation medium. Costa et al. [36] demonstrated that this class 

of microcapsules have a diameter of 5.5 ?m at room temperature but shrink when incubated at 37ºC, 

to around 3 ?m. Therefore, this temperature was chosen to prepare the samples and assess their 

morphology under a temperature similar to that of a biological environment. 

The preparation of individual polymeric capsules while avoiding aggregation is difficult but necessary for 

applications that require cellular uptake and survival. Figure 10.1B shows several CHI/ELR 

microcapsules observed under CLSM. All microcapsules showed diameters of 3–4 ?m and had their 

own individual walls (which served as polymeric reservoirs for the rhodamine dye) and hollow interior 

(hence not dyed after the 10 minutes treatment). The graphic in Figure 10.1C, where the fluorescence 

intensity is plotted as a function of the length of the lines drawn, confirms that the interior was empty 

and thus the dissolution of the CaCO3 core was successful. In Figure 10.1D, the morphological analysis 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules 

 

347 

of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules shows that the integrity of the wall was maintained through the 

process of its construction to the moment of their use. This observation indicates that the used 

operational conditions permitted to obtain individual spherical microstructures. No signs of aggregation 

were found, what makes the produced microcapsules suitable for the subsequent cellular studies. In 

Figure 10.1E, microcapsules made of CHI and the ELR-RDG
(-)

 can be observed. Unlike RGD, RDG is a 

nonbioactive motif similar to RGD in all aspects, except for the position of the G and D amino acids. As 

such, the scrambled RDG sequence was previously shown to have significantly less cellular adhesion in 

respect to its functional RGD counterpart [37,38]. These microcapsules resembled in morphology and 

size the (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules (Figure 10.1D). With such similarity, it was expectable that 

differences in the mechanism and efficacy of internalization of these two microcapsule types – if any – 

would be solely caused by their peptide sequence bioactivity rather than by a morphological 

discrepancy. 

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are hypoimmunogenic and pluripotent able to differentiate in in vitro, 

ex vivo and in vivo, into multiple cells types such as osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, neurocytes, 

hepatocytes, myocytes, and hematopoietic-supporting stroma. These characteristics have been 

considered crucial factors when aiming to develop new candidates for clinical use, especially in tissue 

engineering and regenerative medicine applications, such as transplantation, local implantation, gene 

therapy, and drug delivery [39,40]. Cellular therapies in particular can be envisaged in order to 

internalize molecules with the aim to control cellular behavior, such as the induced differentiation of 

MSCs into osteoblasts [41]. Therefore, the option to use hMSCs in a model of internalization of 

CHI/ELR microcapsules could open the direct applicability of the methodology described herein. 

In order to demonstrate if this kind of hybrid nanostructured microcapsules are suitable for biological 

applications, we analyzed the in vitro viability of hMSCs by means of their metabolic activity in the 

presence of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2. We studied the dose-dependent response effect 

for two experimental times: 3 h and 72 h. hMSCs were co-incubated with increasing microcapsule/cell 

ratios within a range of 5 to 100 units per cell. In Figure 2, the cell viability is represented normalized in 

respect to the positive control, that is, cells cultured without microcapsules. As observed in Figure 

10.2A and Figure 10.2B, after 3 h and 72 h of incubation with (CHI/ELR-RGD)2, the metabolic activity 

did not vary significantly for the studied ratio range in respect to the positive control.

)2 microcapsules for (A, C) 3 h and (B, D) 72 h. Data represent means of 

four experiments, each performed in quadruplicate, normalized in respect to the positive control. Error 

bars represent one standard error (mean+SE). No significant statistical differences were found (p-value 

higher than 0.05). 

 

In light of our results, (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 hybrid microcapsules are not only noncytotoxic for hMSCs but 

can also help maintaining a high cellular metabolic activity over a high ratio of microcapsules in respect 

to the number of cells. A similar trend was observed for ELR-RDG
(-)

-functionalized microcapsules. For 

both time-points (Figure 10.2C and Figure 10.2D), there were no apparent metabolic activity differences 

in respect to the positive control as a function of microcapsule concentrations. 

Analyzing the graphics for 72 h of incubation (Figure 10.2B and Figure 10.2D), one can observe that 

there is a decrease in the mean metabolic activity of cells incubated with either microcapsule type for 

the highest microcapsule/cell ratios. This decrease can be seen for a ratio higher than 50:1 for 

(CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and 60:1 for (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules. When considering cell viability, one 

could expect that a large quantity of microcapsules will reduce nutrient and gas exchanges between the 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules 

 

349 

internal cellular compartment and the culture medium, eventually leading to cell death [42]. Although 

the microcapsules presented herein are noncytotoxic towards hMSCs even for the highest studied ratios, 

it is plausible to affirm that a large number of microcapsules will have negative impact in the metabolic 

activity of the cells. 

Despite the high metabolic activity observed in comparison to the positive control, it was also apparent 

that cells incubated with (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules were less viable than their biofunctional 

analogues. For instance, after incubating 10 microcapsules per cell during 72 h with hMSCs, a viability 

of 139% (ELR-RGD-based elements) was estimated in comparison to 105% (ELR-RDG
(-)

-based elements), 

accounting for a reduction of 24%. 

In Figure 10.3, the metabolic activity measurements for every microcapsule/cell ratio were coupled 

together and their mean was calculated to estimate the cellular viability for each microcapsule type.

In the case of the longest incubation time (72 h), hMSCs incubated with RGD-functionalized 

microcapsules exhibited a mean metabolic activity of 114%, while RDG

102%. These differences in bioactivity do not account for a significant difference between each

microcapsules type, although the mean bioactivity values of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 are higher for all time-

points. This small disparity could be the result of RGD-induced integrin activation in the dorsal region of 

the cells, a non-selective interaction, which is known to be involved in several metabolic pathways, such 

as those of proliferation and differentiation [43,44]. 

In light of these results, it seems possible to apply rather large amounts of hybrid microcapsules to 

hMSCs without severely affecting their viability, even when using the non-functional RDG analogue. The 

lowest microcapsule/cell ratios also provided the most favorable conditions for hMSCs incubation with 

both types of functionalized microcapsules. Given these results, we selected a concentration of 

10 microcapsules per cell for all subsequent experiments. This way, it would be possible to keep the 

microcapsule/cell ratio to a minimum while avoiding a massive and systematic microcapsule 

administration and ensuring a high cellular metabolic activity in respect to the positive control. 

Cell viability assays by LIVE/DEAD

 were carried out to complement the metabolic activity data for a 

time-frame of 10 days and can be observed in Figure 10.4.

In respect to the (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules effect, after an incubation period of 72 h, the green 

calcein staining confirmed that the cells were alive and well-spread on the surface (Figure 10.4B). The

351 

same trend is observed for the (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 (Figure 10.4E), with no visible differences between 

each case. In order to assess if the cells could remain alive after being cultured in the presence of 

hybrid microcapsules, complete DMEM was added after 72 h to the co-incubation medium. Then this 

mixture was maintained for another 168 h to a total of 10 days of culture before LIVE/DEAD
®
 assays 

were performed. As observed in Figure 10.4C and Figure 10.4F, no dead cells were encountered, 

clearly indicating that hMSCs viability was not affected by the incubation with the foreign microcapsule 

components – as supported by the metabolic activity assays – even after a longer exposition time. 

In order to determine if this class of hybrid microcapsules could be internalized by cells, hMSCs were 

co-incubated first with (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 for 72 h. To aid in this microscopy visualization, the 

microcapsules were loaded with DQ-ovalbumin. This commercially available product is a conjugate of 

ovalbumin heavily labeled with BODIPY dyes. Due to a characteristic self-quenching mechanism, it 

exhibits a bright red fluorescence characterized by the close proximity of the fluorescent dyes, but it 

shifts to a strong green upon proteolysis. This means that it would be possible to follow the 

internalization of the microcapsules and the intracellular processing of the cargo by fluorescence assays. 

Confocal microscopy (Figure 10.5) confirmed the presence of internalized RGD-functionalized 

microcapsules after 72 h of incubation. A yellow color (resulting from the simultaneous fluorescence 

emission of red and green) could be observed in different planes of the cells, evidencing that the 

microcapsules containing DQ-ovalbumin were processed by the hMSCs. In Figure 10.5A, the arrows 

point to bright green dots, indicating the presence of fully degraded microcapsules. To reflect upon the 

electrostatic interactions between capsules and cellular membrane, the charges of ELR-RGD and 

ELR-RDG
(-)

 in aqueous solution were determined by ?-potential measurements. They were shown to 

have a charge of -5.7±1.2 mV and -6.3±1.2 mV, respectively, in PBS. One could argue that the negative 

charge of the ELR outer layer could potentially hinder the internalization by conflicting with the 

electrostatic nature of the cellular membrane [45]. However, electrostatic interactions alone were 

previously unable to account for cellular adhesion to surfaces modified with polycations [46] and thus is 

expected to have little influence in comparison to the bioactive properties of the used macromolecules. 

Therefore, these results show that cellular uptake of CHI/ELR microcapsules can be achieved and that 

their intracellular degradation can be followed by the used fluorophore.

After confirming that cellular uptake of this class of microcapsules can be successful, the cells that 

could effectively internalize microcapsules loaded with DQ-ovalbumin were quantified by flow cytometry. 

Figure 10.6 shows the results obtained by flow cytometry and the quantification of the internalization 

efficiency for both microcapsule types. For this analysis, the study of Semmling et al. [47], who 

performed a “flow cytometry”-based assay to analyze the uptake of polyelectrolyte capsules, was taken 

into consideration. In the case of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules, in Figure 10.6A, viable hMSCs after 

72 h of incubation were represented by the area delimited in yellow. Viable cells include cells that were 

either empty (with low side-scattering intensity, Iss) or internalized microcapsules (with high Iss). Outside 

these borders, cellular debris, apoptotic cells and microcapsule debris are usually identified here.

ovalbumin-loaded microcapsules in every of these processing stages, that is, DQ-ovalbumin exhibiting 

red, green, or both. Thus, events with high intensity in either of these spectra corresponded to cells

354 

containing DQ-ovalbumin in distinct stages of intracellular processing: intact, degraded, or in process of 

degradation. Within the delimited area in Figure 10.6B are found empty cells, verified from a control of 

cells cultured without microcapsules. The data indicate that 63±17% of the hMSCs have internalized 

(CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules, as depicted in Figure 10.6E. 

This same analysis was performed for (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 (see Figure 10.6C and Figure 10.6D), after 

which an internalization efficiency of 53±10% was determined. No statistical differences were found 

between both cases, indicating that the exhibition of RGD did not influence the incorporation of the 

microcapsules by the hMSCs, in respect to microcapsules exhibiting RDG. Nonetheless, the mean 

internalization efficacy for (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 was higher than its nonbioactive counterpart, which may 

indicate a minor contribution of receptor-mediated interactions in the cellular uptake. 

Our results indicate that the internalization of LbL microcapsules is not affected significantly when 

coupled with biofunctional components, contrary to what was demonstrated by other authors.[48,49] 

For instance, Caruso and coworkers [48] showed that poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine 

hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) capsules (around 500 nm in diameter) functionalized with humanized A33 

monoclonal antibodies could be internalized specifically by LIM1215 colorectal cancer cells. However, 

in another work, De Koker et al. [50] inhibited different endocytic pathways and actin polymerization in 

bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Their results demonstrated that microcapsules with around 3 ?m 

are internalized via macropinocytosis – a nonspecific endocytosis mechanism for foreign materials 

roughly between 500–2000 nm [51]. Therefore it is likely that macropinocytosis was the major 

endocytosis mechanism involved in the cellular uptake of carrier devices of this class and size (around 

3–4 ?m in diameter), to which surface functionalization does not play a determinant role. 

Upon internalization of a drug carrier, it is important to ensure that the agent is not only delivered but 

also available for use by cells. Thanks to the use of DQ-ovalbumin, the consumption of this cargo by 

cells could be conveniently assessed by fluorescence changes. After quantifying the cellular uptake, the 

bioavailability of DQ-ovalbumin was evaluated by co-incubating cultured hMSCs with each kind of 

microcapsules in parallel for 3 and 72 h. In Figure 10.7, representative bright-field and fluorescence 

microscope images can be observed for (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 microcapsules loaded 

with DQ-ovalbumin. The schematic representation in Figure 10.7A shows the various stages of cellular 

uptake and intracellular processing of encapsulated protein. Until the cargo reaches a fully degraded 

state, the intensity of green fluorescence increases and red decreases: their simultaneous emission 

results in the orange and yellow intermediate colors observable under the fluorescence microscope.

This observation was common for both (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG

10.7B and Figure 10.7D). A closer observation permits to detect some green dots after 3 h of 

incubation, like in the case of (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules (Figure 10.7B). Such observation is 

consistent with the work of Rivera-Gil et al. [17], in which the same fluorescent protein was used. In 

their work with nonbiodegradable poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PSS/PAH) 

microcapsules, they concluded that a green fluorescence exhibited in capsules that are not expected to 

degrade – hence efficiently protecting their cargo – would still be permeable and prone to this 

fluorescence change. Variables such as the pH and ionic strength influence the permeability of the 

polyelectrolyte capsules, thus DQ-ovalbumin would still be able to diffuse through the multilayer shell 

and exposed to proteases and be degraded. 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically 

engineered macromolecules 

 

356 

After 72 h of incubation, a higher amount of microcapsules were detected interacting with the cells, in 

comparison to the shorter time-point, with a predominant presence of yellow capsules found in the case 

of hMSCs incubated with RGD-functionalized microcapsules and red capsules in the case of cells 

incubated with the non-functional analogue ones. This observation indicates that, even after 72 h of 

incubation, distinct stages of microcapsule/cell internalization and intracellular processing could be 

found. However, judging by the intense yellow and occasional green dots in Figure 10.7C, the 

bioavailability of DQ-ovalbumin encapsulated within (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 microcapsules seemed higher. 

The microscopy comparison between both types of microcapsules (Figure 10.7) seems to indicate that 

both (CHI/ELR-RGD)2 and (CHI/ELR-RDG
(-)

)2 situations bear little difference in respect to the number of 

apparent internalized carriers. Nonetheless, a dominant emission fluorescence towards the green 

spectrum – that of cleaved DQ-ovalbumin – was dominant in the former. This result shows that the 

cargo of RGD-functionalized microcapsules was processed faster, evidencing a higher bioavailability of 

DQ-ovalbumin for this carrier type. In this sense, the bioavailability rate of the cargo does not follow the 

results from the cellular uptake quantification shown in Figure 10.6: the internalization efficacy does not 

seem much influenced by the surface functionalization, whereas the intracellular processing of their 

cargo does. The study of the internalization mechanism and intracellular processing has not been much 

researched. It is true that the role of macropinocytosis was previously demonstrated [50] but it is known 

that functionalizing an interface can mediate specific integrin interactions [52]. Given that the surface 

functionalization in this work had little influence in the internalization efficacy, one would expect that the 

degradation of their cargo would be similar after the studied time of exposure. It could be suggested 

that the distinct functionality of the adsorbed recombinamers triggers distinct proteolytic pathways, just 

as RGD may active proliferation- and differentiation-related integrins. However, the study of such 

mechanism was out of the scope of this work. Such mechanism should be studied in the future in order 

to properly determine carrier and cargo fates upon cellular uptake, especially for carriers of the same 

class internalized by similar endocytic mechanisms. With these results, we conclude that CHI/ELR 

microcapsules can be internalized by hMSCs, regardless of their surface functionalization, and may act 

as suitable carriers for the intracellular delivery of active agents. 

10.4 Conclusion 

We presented the fabrication of multilayer microcapsules made of natural and nature-inspired polymers 

for intracellular delivery of active agents. Thanks to the nature of the constituents, the microcapsules 



Chapter 10 – Cellular uptake of multilayered capsules produced with biomimetic and genetically

were noncytotoxic as their degradation does not result in harmful products for the cells. Cellular uptake 

was demonstrated, showing their potential as carriers for drug delivery directly to the cellular machinery. 

In the future, this way of delivery may help minimizing drug losses and increasing their delivery control 

and efficacy. The internalization efficacy demonstrated for hMSCs lets foresee their use in cell/tissue 

engineering and regenerative medicine where it is important to control the differentiation of stem cells 

into specific phenotypes. This work confirmed that CHI/ELR microcapsules could interact and be 

internalized by cells, but experiments with microcapsules loaded with actual active agents are envisaged, 

such as molecules that trigger the differentiation of cells into specific phenotypes. The mechanism of 

internalization of the microcapsules at this scale did not depend on the surface functionalization. They 

were internalized via macropinocytosis although the ELR functionalization suggested a minor role of 

integrin-mediated mechanisms. In this context, the recombinant nature of ELRs will be of interest to 

further study the microcapsules’ endocytosis mechanism. In particular, it is possible that the production 

of smaller capsules by using nanotemplates may increase the influence of RGD and facilitate 

internalization [53]. The inclusion of bioactive motifs other than this generic motif may constitute a 

strong advantage of using such recombinant technologies, allowing exploring not only specific 

recognition processes but also degradation pathways for targeted delivery and increased drug efficacy. 

Therefore, multilayer microcapsules using biomimetic ingredients for intracellular delivery let foresee 

new strategies to increase the availability of molecules of interest in cells and for targeted biomedical 

applications.

Abstract 

Inspired by the cells’ structure, we present compartmentalized capsules with temperature and 

magnetic-based responsiveness, and hierarchical organization ranging from the nano- to the visible 

scales. Liquefied alginate macroscopic beads coated with a layer-by-layer (LbL) chitosan/alginate shell 

served as containers both for model fluorophores and microcapsules, which in their turn encapsulated 

either another fluorophore or magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The microcapsules were coated with a 

temperature responsive chitosan/elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) nanostructured shell. By varying the 

temperature from 25ºC to 37ºC, the two-hour release of rhodamine encapsulated within the 

microcapsules and its diffusion through the external compartment decreased from 84% and 71%. The 

devices could withstand handling and centrifugal stress, with 50% remaining intact at a rotation speed 

of 2000g. MNPs attributed magnetic responsiveness towards external magnetic fields. Such 

customizable system can be envisaged to transport bioactive agents and cells in tissue engineering 

applications.

11.1 Introduction 

Considerable research efforts have been focused on miniaturized compartmental engineering systems 

with optimized properties over the past decade due to their wealth of potential applications in fields 

such as catalysis, sensors, drug delivery, disease models, energy storage and microreactors [1-3], 

which often require complex phenomena to occur simultaneously. Such a multifunctional device that is 

capable of addressing several reactions at once would, however, be difficult to develop. Perhaps not 

surprisingly, nature gives us an elegant example of a multifunctional entity in the form of biological cells. 

Due to their unique hierarchical and compartmentalized organization, they allow numerous compounds 

to be transported, proteins to be synthesized and enzymatic reactions to be regulated within their 

cytoplasm. However, building artificial cells is still a technology in its infancy. In an attempt to mimic 

cells, a great deal of research has focused on hierarchical nano- and microcompartments [4-6]. Multi-

shelled organic and inorganic capsules prepared by template-assisted strategies are usually 

accompanied by harsh processing conditions [7-9]. In contrast, compartmentalized assemblies of 

polymeric multilayer nano/microcapsules within larger partitions have been achieved by using non-

aggressive bottom-up strategies [10-14]. In any case, compartmentalization has allowed combining 

properties and confine reactions that could not be achieved otherwise with single-component 

assemblies [4]. 

The most attractive characteristic of compartmentalized devices does not necessarily involve their 

potential ability to mimic intracellular reactions, such as confining drugs and enzymatic reactions into 

partitions [15-17]. Compartmental systems should ideally be customizable by assembling 

subcompartments which exhibit functions that are not coupled naturally. Moreover, following a proper 

selection of the constituents, the range of such functions could be widened by exploiting the properties 

of stimuli-responsive materials [18]. Some examples that would benefit from such approach are the 

release control of several biomolecules delivered simultaneously for enhanced drug delivery [19], the 

immobilization of such a device spatially for targeted therapies [20], and the control over a multitude of 

cellular events that lead to stem cell differentiation [21]. 

In our goal to construct a hierarchical multifunctional device, we aimed to demonstrate that both 

molecular compounds and inorganic iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles can be encapsulated in distinct 

compartments. We report the construction of liquefied microcapsule-containing gel beads manufactured 

using a hybrid “ionic gelation” strategy of alginate assisted by a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach. LbL is a

to the macro-scales 

 

366 

simple and versatile technique which allows producing robust coatings, even in substrates with complex 

geometries. Because it discards the need of organic and harmful solvents, it is an attractive technique 

for tissue engineering applications [22-24]. In three-dimensional structures, namely spherical capsules, 

the semi-permeable nature of multilayer coatings can be used to tune the permeability of molecules of 

interest in or out, or to completely confine them [13,25-27]. Herein, liquefied alginate macrocapsules 

delimited by multilayer shells of chitosan/alginate (CHI/ALG) were intended to containing 

microcapsules made of CHI/”elastin-like recombinamer (ELR)” inside. The latter, on their side, 

contained either magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) or model molecular compounds, such as the model 

low molecular weight fluorophores fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine. 

CHI and ALG are two well-known polysaccharides of marine origin which show biocompatibility, 

adhesiveness, non-toxicity, as well as bacteriostatic, fungistatic, anti-microbial and hemostatic 

activities [28,29]. ELRs, a recombinant type of elastin-like polymer (ELP), are temperature-responsive 

polypeptides that are soluble in aqueous media below a specific critical transition temperature (Tt) but 

undergo a phase separation above it [30-32]. Lastly, MNPs are structures susceptible to magnetic fields. 

They are often used to enhance medical imaging diagnosis of soft tissues (e.g., magnetic resonance 

imaging, MRI) and temperature-triggered treatments such as hyperthermia and tissue ablation [33-35]. 

In light of the potential applications of compartmentalized structures, we have studied the properties of 

each of the structures that can be found at the nano-, micro- and macro-scales, the permeability of the 

multilayer shells at distinct temperatures (namely the coatings containing the temperature-responsive 

ELR) and the response to external magnetic fields. We hypothesized that such systems could be 

fabricated and customized to display smart tunable permeability and spatial 

mobilization/immobilization. 

11.2 Experimental section 

11.2.1 Materials 

Medium molecular weight chitosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (ref 448877) and purified by a 

series of filtration and precipitation in water and ethanol steps, adapted from the method described by 

Signini and Filho [36], followed by freeze-drying. The degree of deacetylation was determined to be 82% 

(Supplemental Figure 11.1). Alginic acid sodium salt from brown algae was purchased from Sigma-

Aldrich (ref 71238) and used as received.

11.2.2 Bioproduction of the elastin-like recombinamers 

An ELR containing a L-arginine-glycine-L-aspartic acid (RGD) motif was bioproduced using a 

fermentation process from an Escherichia coli strain BLR(DE3) containing an appropriate expression 

gene, obtained using an appropriate protocol for gene design [37]. After fermentation, the culture was 

harvested and lysed by ultrasonic disruption. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the 

cleared lysate was subjected to several cycles of cold (4ºC) and warm (40ºC) centrifugations, at 

10000 rpm for 10 minutes each. Finally, the polymer was dialyzed against ultra-pure Milli-Q water at 

4°C in dialysis membranes with a 12 kDa molecular weight cut-off for a minimum of 6 hours, after 

which the water was changed. After 4 changes of water, the biopolymer was frozen and freeze-dried. 

Characterization of the bioproduct was done previously [22,38]. 

11.2.3 Synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles 

In a typical synthesis to synthesize spherical iron oxide MNPs, 10 mL of a solution containing 1.2 g of 

iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3?6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich ref. 236489) and 0.6 g of iron(II) chloride 

tetrahydrate (FeCl2?4H2O, Sigma-Aldrich ref 220299) was added drop-wise to 25 mL of ammonium 

hydroxide solution (NH4OH, made of 33% ammonia, NH3, in H2O) over 4 h under an inert nitrogen 

atmosphere. The products of the reaction were collected by magnetic separation and washed three 

times with ethanol and water. The last washing step was made with ethanol, after which the products 

were left to dry at room temperature. 

11.2.4 Characterization of the MNPs 

The shape and morphology of the magnetite nanoparticles were determined using high resolution 

transmission electronic microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-1011, operating at 200 kV). Samples were 

prepared by dropping a dilute aqueous solution (concentration = 1 mg?mL
-1

) of the nanoparticles onto a 

200-mesh copper grid and allowing the solvent to evaporate. The magnetization of the MNPs was 

measured as a function of the applied external magnetic field (maximum value 10 kOe) using a 

vibrating sample magnetometer (PPMS, Quantum Design) at 300 K.

11.2.5 Temperature-induced aggregate measurements 

The aggregate sizes of chitosan, alginate and ELR in solution were measured using the dynamic light 

scattering (DLS) from a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) for temperatures 25ºC/37°C after 

stabilization for 5 min. The samples of alginate and ELR were prepared at 300 µg?mL
-1

 in 

phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. In the case of chitosan, the solvent was acetic acid at 

1% (w/v) and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration of 0.15 M, pH 5.5. Measurements were performed 

first at 25ºC, then 37ºC and finally back at 25ºC. A total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to 

obtain an average value at stabilized temperature. 

11.2.6 Synthesis of the calcium carbonate sacrificial particles, either empty or 

entrapping fluorophores/MNPs 

Aqueous solutions of anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, Sigma-Aldrich ref 222321) and calcium 

chloride (CaCl2, VWR ref 1.02378.0500) were prepared at 1 M. In a typical co-precipitation reaction, 

100 ?g of a desired material was entrapped in a medium of 200 µL of H2O by adding 100 µL of 

Na2CO3 followed by 100 µL of CaCl2 with rapid stirring for 30 seconds. The H2O precipitation medium 

contained the material to be entrapped at a concentration of 500 ?g?mL
-1

. Three distinct ingredients 

were added to the H2O precipitation medium: fluorescein-5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC, 389 Da, Sigma-

Aldrich ref F3651), rhodamine-B isothiocyanate (Rhod, 536 Da, Sigma-Aldrich ref R1755) and MNPs. 

As a control, empty microcapsules were also fabricated by using solely ultrapure H2O. Stirring was 

stopped after 30 s and the suspension of newly synthesized calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles 

left to react and precipitate for 15 min. The supernatant was then removed and the particles washed 

twice with ultrapure water to remove residual salts and non-entrapped materials. Unless stated 

otherwise, all supernatants were retained for fluorescence measurements and quantification of losses 

until the construction of compartmental capsules was completed. 

11.2.7 Construction of the microparticle multilayer coating 

The CaCO3 sacrificial templates (empty or entrapping either a fluorophore or MNP) were immersed 

alternately in CHI and ELR solutions (300 µg?mL
-1

, pH 5.5, 0.15 M of NaCl) for 10 min each, then 

washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M). Centrifugation was avoided to prevent damage and 

aggregation of the particles each time the samples were to be retrieved from solution; simple

nano- to the macro-scales

precipitation of the suspension was used instead (3 to 5 min). This process was repeated until three 

bilayers had been assembled, (CHI/ELR)3. For the sole purpose of confocal microscopy 

characterization described below, the CaCO3 cores were chelated at this point by immersion in 

ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich ref E9884; 0.2 M, pH 5.5) for 30 min. 

11.2.8 Construction of multilayer coated external subcompartment-containing 

beads 

A 1% (w/v) solution of alginic acid sodium salt was prepared. In a typical experiment, the 

(CHI/ELR)3-coated microparticles were suspended in 1 mL of alginate solution and the resulting 

suspension extruded through a 25G needle, at a rate of 0.33 mL?min
-1

, into a 0.75% (w/v) solution of 

CaCl2 under mild stirring. Alginate beads containing coated microparticles were formed by calcium-

mediated ionic gelation. The beads were immersed alternately in CHI and ALG solutions (300 µg?mL
-1

, 

pH 5.5, 0.15 M NaCl) for 10 minutes each, then washed with 0.15 M NaCl (pH 5.5 at 0.15 M). This 

process was repeated until three bilayers had been assembled, (CHI/ALG)3. After the coating had been 

assembled, the beads were immersed in EDTA. At this point, the CaCO3 sacrificial templates are 

chelated simultaneously with the liquefied alginate bead. 

Liquefied alginate beads coated with (CHI/ALG)3 multilayers loaded with not only empty microcapsules 

and Rhod in the ALG medium were also constructed. Rhod was suspended alongside the empty 

microcapsules and encapsulated in the ALG bead compartment instead of in the inner microcapsules. 

In a typical experiment, Rhod was suspended in ALG at 15 ?g?mL
-1

. This value was determined by first 

calculating the construction losses resulting from the Rhod-loaded microcapsules within the external 

alginate macrocapsule in order to minimize concentration-dependent artifacts (see Supplemental Figure 

11.3 for details). 

11.2.9 Characterization of the compartmental units 

The morphology of the FITC-loaded (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules was determined using an Olympus 

FV1000 confocal microscope (Germany). TEM images of both empty and MNP-loaded microcapsules 

were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 HR instrument operating at 80 kV. Prior to the observation, a 

volume of 60 ?L of microcapsule suspension was pipetted onto a transmission electron microscopy 

(TEM) grid and left to evaporate overnight. An Axioimager Z1M Zeiss microscope (Germany) was used to

observe (CHI/ALG)3-coated liquefied beads using transmitted light and fluorescence microscopy for 

Rhod-loaded external compartments. The latter also containing FITC-loaded microcapsules were 

observed to assess the distribution of the subcompartments within the macrocapsules. 

11.2.10 Mechanical resistance of the external compartments 

A centrifugal rotation test was performed with the samples suspended in PBS to measure the 

mechanical resistance of the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules. 100 samples were placed in centrifuge tubes 

and rotated at a starting centrifugal load of 500g. After 5 min, the number of intact beads was counted. 

Those that remained intact were submitted to incremental centrifugal loads (500g incremental steps) 

up to a maximum of 5000g. This experiment was performed three times.  

11.2.11 Rhodamine release studies 

The compartmentalized systems were suspended in PBS at either 25 or 37ºC. Prior to this study, Rhod 

was encapsulated in one of two hierarchical locations: the internal (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules (with 

Rhod added during the co-precipitation stage) or the external liquefied alginate (CHI/ALG)3-coated 

macrocapsules (with Rhod added to the initial alginate solution). The study was conducted for 2 h to 

assess the early release profile in 3 mL of PBS, with 600 ?L of surrounding PBS being removed every 

10 min and the container being refilled with the same volume of PBS pre-stabilized at the 

corresponding temperature. 100% of Rhod was considered to be the total mass remaining in the 

compartmental systems after taking construction losses into account. The studies were performed three 

times (n=3). 

11.2.12 Magnetic-based responsiveness 

Macrocapsules containing MNP-loaded microcapsules were suspended in a PBS-filled square 

polystyrene Petri dish placed upon a 1×1 cm
2
 grid. A 1.3 T permanent neodymium (NdFeB) bar 

magnet (diameter: 4 mm; length: 2.5 cm) was used to apply the external magnetic field. Ten samples 

were placed 3 cm away from the magnet, with the latter placed at a height of 1.4 cm from the PBS 

surface. The movement was recorded on video and the mean normalized distance traversed by the 

samples plotted as a function of time.

11.3 Results and discussion 

The conception of a multifunctional compartmentalized device may involve using several ingredients 

from distinct classes of materials, depending on the functionalities desired from a system of this kind, 

and require a huge number of fabrication operations. An illustration of the proposed system is 

illustrated in Figure 11.1. 

 

Figure 11.1. Hierarchical organization of the multicompartmental capsules. Liquefied alginate beads, 

delimited by a (CHI/ALG)3 coating, are visible to the naked eye. Multilayer microcapsules of (CHI/ELR)3 

and molecular compounds can be suspended within the aqueous polymer phase. The former can 

further contain other types of molecular compounds and MNPs. 

 

The borders between compartments consist of multilayer shells with three bilayers for the purpose of 

proof of concept. Our proposition comprises the fabrication of alginate beads by calcium-promoted ionic 

gelation separated from the environment by a multilayer coating of three CHI and ALG layers, 

(CHI/ALG)3, with thickness around 40 nm [39]. Prior to ionic gelation, the microscopic 

subcompartments are suspended in an ALG solution to form beads containing small spherical 

structures. These microcapsules are templated in CaCO3 microspheres and delimited by a coating of 

three CHI and ELR layers, (CHI/ELR)3, with thickness around 25 nm [22]. In the subcompartments we 

encapsulated further components of smaller scales – fluorophores and MNPs. Since the synthesis of 

the CaCO3 templates results from the co-precipitation of equimolar solutions of Na2CO3 and CaCl2, 

various substances can be added to the co-precipitation medium and entrapped within it. After the 



Chapter 11. Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the nano- 

to the macro-scales 

 

372 

assembly of all compartments, the inorganic template is removed by treatment with EDTA, which also 

liquefies the alginate bead to a highly viscous medium. The final product is an external macrocapsule 

containing internal microcapsules – henceforth referred to as external (EC) and internal compartments 

(IC), respectively – with each partition being delimited by multilayer membranes. 

To ensure that we could assemble structures from different size scales, the hierarchical organization of 

the proposed system was characterized initially. MNPs, ICs and ECs were observed resorting to distinct 

microscopy techniques and are shown in Figure 11.2. Note that for every experiment performed, ECs 

are always loaded with empty ICs, i.e., without any fluorophore encapsulated, unless otherwise 

specified. Using TEM, the MNPs (Figure 11.2a) were found to have a diameter of about 10 nm which, 

along with the model molecular compounds, represents the smallest scale present in this system. FITC 

was encapsulated within (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules and could be observed by confocal laser scanning 

microscopy (CLSM) upon removal of the CaCO3 template (Figure 11.2b). We have previously 

constructed multilayer films made of chitosan and ELRs. Characterization of this ELR – amino acid 

sequence, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), and differential 

scanning calorimetry (DSC) – which contains a RGD motif, can be found elsewhere.[22,38] 

Although used previously to enhance cell adhesion, the primary reason for using this specific ELR 

herein was to enable LbL construction due to the negative charge provided by the aspartic acids (D), 

with a pKa ranging from 3.0–4.7 [40], thus exploiting the biological function of this sequence was not in 

the scope of this work. The average size of the ICs was 3 ?m, what places them at a microscale level. 

The external compartments act as containers where both ICs and molecular compounds can be 

entrapped. Encapsulation of the fluorescent molecule Rhod showed that the (CHI/ALG)3 macrocapsules 

have a diameter of 2 mm (Figure 11.2c) and are therefore representative of the visible scale.

The proposed formulation contains ingredients that respond to external stimuli. Namely, the polymeric 

constituent ELR is known to respond to temperature, while MNPs to magnetic fields. These properties 

were studied and the results are presented in Figure 11.3. The response to temperature of the 

polymers used herein – CHI, ALG and ELR – was assessed by means of aggregate size measurements 

at 25ºC and 37ºC. In Figure 11.3a, it is shown that the size of ELR aggregates at 25ºC is about 

200 nm. In contrast to this situation, at 37ºC aggregates of around 2000 nm were formed due to the 

temperature transition of ELRs above their Tt (in Supplemental Figure 11.2, the Tt was determined to 

be 29ºC).

measurements by DLS of CHI (pH 5.5), ALG and ELR (pH 7.4) at 300 µg?mL

 for a temperature cycle 

of 25–37–25ºC; (b) magnetization assay of MNPs. 

 

Upon decreasing the temperature to 25ºC once again, it was observed that the aggregate size 

decreases to around 300 nm, confirming that the polypeptide used herein exhibits a reversible 

response towards temperature. Thus, the use of ELRs in such multilayer coatings may mean that the 

permeability of the subcompartments can be tuned simply by switching between room and 

physiological temperatures. As expected, CHI and ALG were not significantly influenced, since they are 

not temperature-responsive. For CHI, the working pH was of 5.5, as the pKa of this polysaccharide is 

around 6. Nonetheless, CHI is not a temperature responsive biomaterial, therefore pH is not expected 

to alter its response to this variable. The use of temperature responsive macromolecules could help in 

controlling the permeability of a carrier coating based on temperature variations, when the release of a 

specific molecular compound needs to be more sustained or pronounced. At the same time, the use of 

CHI and ALG allows herein the assembly of a static coating, i.e. that is not stimuli-responsive under the 

temperature-dependent experimental conditions used further on, used solely for the purpose of 

encapsulating the rest of the components in its interior. 

The other constituent of this system are MNPs. Magnetization measurements with the MNPs are shown 

in Figure 11.3b. Magnetic particles can be classified as ferromagnetic and 

paramagnetic/superparamagnetic. Whereas the former exhibit a permanent magnetic dipole moment, 

with a paramagnetic particle a magnetic dipole moment is induced only when an external magnetic field 

is applied [41-44]. The MNPs showed a saturation magnetization of 40 emu?g
-1

 and the typical 

sigmoidal curve of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, thereby confirming their response to magnetic 

fields and potential use for spatial mobilization/immobilization of a host device. In particular, it is known 



Chapter 11 – Multifunctional compartmentalized capsules with a hierarchical organization from the 

nano- to the macro-scales 

 

375 

that the success in therapeutic applications of growth factors often requires a release system for 

delivery with spatiotemporal control [45]. Thus the magnetic component may help achieving a better 

efficacy of the encapsulated agent and reduce losses to surrounding fluids. 

Another important characteristic of these systems is their mechanical resistance. The ECs are visible to 

the naked eye and can therefore easily be handled. However, it is important to determine whether the 

external LbL coating can withstand handling whilst retaining the liquefied ALG. The integrity of the 

(CHI/ALG)3 coating was assessed by submitting the macrocapsules to incremental centrifugal stress. 

Figure 11.4 shows that these macrocapsules can withstand centrifugal stress, with 50% of them 

remaining intact at a rotation speed of 2000g.

stress, with two standard deviations represented. 

 

At a maximum of 5000g, nearly every macrocapsule was disrupted, with only 5±3% of samples 

remaining intact. The resistance to handling was also assessed by manipulating them using a Pasteur 

micropipette. They can be easily and safely manipulated without disrupting the wall integrity, which is 

an important property when considering not only handling but also transportation or transfer between 

distinct containers, and biological implantation. 

Compartmentalized systems may be useful for entrapping a multitude of molecular compounds with 

tunable permeability. Figure 11.5a shows the distribution of FITC-loaded ICs within an EC, with the 

latter encapsulating Rhod.

(a) This image was obtained by loading the former with FITC and the latter with Rhod. Separate green 

(b) and red (c) filters are shown. 

 

The separate fluorescent channels are shown (Figure 11.5b and Figure 11.5c). It is clear that the ICs 

are homogeneously distributed in the ALG liquefied medium, showing that a compartmentalized 

structure is definitely conceived. 

To further explore the permeability of the compartments, early release studies were performed by 

loading either the ICs or the ECs with Rhod and plotting the cumulative release of this compound from 

the (CHI/ELR)3 and (CHI/ALG)3 compartments at 25ºC (Figure 11.6a) and 37ºC (Figure 11.6b) as a 

function of time. One important finding from this study was that the release of Rhod encapsulated in the 

ICs was more sustained at 37ºC than at 25ºC (84% and 71%, respectively, after 2 h). This phenomenon 

results from the temperature response of the ELR: at the temperature of 37ºC – above Tt – its transition 

to a more ordered state is triggered and is manifested by the decrease in the shell permeability, an 

effect previously demonstrated for CHI- and ELR-based microcapsules entrapping bovine serum 

albumin (BSA) [46]. Such decreased permeability of the microcapsules can therefore be used as a 

mechanism to control the release of molecular compounds. As such, it could be useful in the field of 

sustained drug-delivery devices for targeting a therapeutic window, micro-reactors confining chemical 

reactions, and sensors for the simultaneous detection of macromolecules or gases by diffusion (in or 

out). It should also be noted that the release of Rhod from the ECs did not change significantly since 

CHI and ALG are not temperature responsive (90% at 25ºC and 92% at 37ºC)

Figure 11.6. Kinetics of Rhod release when encapsulated in the internal (CHI/ELR)3 microcapsules 

(? ) and the external (CHI/ALG)3 compartment (?) at (a) 25ºC and (b) 37ºC for a time, t, of 2 h, with 

two standard deviations represented. Some standard deviations are too small to be distinguished from 

the symbol. 

 

Another important finding was that the release of Rhod from the ICs decreased after an initial burst 

detected at the first time-point. Namely, the Rhod release rate decreased between 10-20 minutes 

(25ºC) and 10–30 minutes (37ºC), with this decrease being more pronounced in the latter case. This 

could be due to the fact that molecules encapsulated within the microcompartmental system have to 

diffuse through the IC coating to the alginate medium and then through the external coating to the 

external environment. This would explain the existence of a time-gap that is not present when Rhod is 

encapsulated within the ECs. Figure 11.7 depicts the proposed mechanism for the initial burst release 

detected in the IC case. 

We hypothesize that this phenomenon results from the release of Rhod by diffusion into the alginate 

medium during construction of the ECs containing Rhod-loaded ICs, mainly at the chelation stage. At 

the start of the release studies, this fraction would behave similarly to the EC case at the first time point, 

with an initial burst similar in magnitude to that of the ECs. The remaining Rhod is released from the 

ICs at a slower rate. In this regard, in Figure 11.5 we had separated the fluorescence channels of FITC 

and Rhod. Indeed, immediately after construction of the multicompartmental device, there is a diffusion 

of FITC throughout the alginate medium, as evidenced by diffuse green zones Figure 11.5b.

Figure 11.7. Burst mechanism for Rhod loaded within internal microcompartments. (i) At first, Rhod 

is physically entrapped within CaCO3 templates. (ii) After chelation, a fraction of Rhod is lost and 

quantified. The samples are rinsed to remove the lost fraction. However, another fraction remains free 

within the alginate. (iii) At the start of the release studies, the free Rhod diffuses to the exterior and is 

readily detected. ICs keep releasing Rhod to the alginate medium at a slower rate, and this Rhod is 

detected later in the experiment. 

 

The existence of two release rate constants is consistent with the "double barrier" effect recently 

evidenced by Lecommandoux and co-workers for polymersome-in-polymersome systems [47]. In their 

work, doxorubicin was encapsulated in inner or outer compartments. The fabrication method differed 

from our LbL mechanism: they were fabricated by nanoprecipitation and an emulsion/centrifugation 

process, respectively. They observed lower release kinetics when doxorubicin was encapsulated within 

the internal nanovesicles in comparison to the latter case. 

Theoretically, if such initial burst did not occur, a more prolonged time-gap would be visible from the 

beginning before Rhod from the ICs could be detected. This burst-type release is not necessarily a 

drawback as some applications may benefit from it. For instance, a higher fraction of antibiotics/anti-

inflammatories can be released in the first few minutes after administration when they are most needed, 

with the rest of the load being released subsequently within a therapeutic window. The release of more 

than one molecule from a reservoir with independent and tunable rates may be important in drug 

delivery systems, when the delayed delivery of one active substance with respect to another is desired, 

or to circumvent premature drug leakage [48]. Moreover, tuning the release rate of a molecular species 

could be accomplished further by varying the number of layers of the coating: a substance could diffuse 

through the multilayers with higher release kinetics for thicker coatings, in comparison to a thinner

coating [27,46]. Although the primary interest in compartmental devices has focused on systems for 

the delivery of therapeutic molecules, other applications have been proposed in fields ranging from 

actuators to biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [18]. 

The encapsulation method for CaCO3 entrapment was also used to incorporate MNPs within the ICs. 

Figure 11.8a shows MNPs observed by TEM homogeneously distributed within these microcapsules.

height of 1.4 cm on top of a polystyrene cover. The red color is characteristic of the MNPs within the 

hierarchical structure. Squares are 1×1 cm

. 

 

Empty microcapsules were used as a control for MNP-loaded ones. In comparison, Figure 11.8b shows 

empty ICs, where no spherical structure could be detected. As they are empty and the electronic 

density is lower than MNP-containing ICs, the multilayer shell can be discerned, with creases and folds 

which are characteristic of collapsed ultrathin walls due to the drying process. 

In light of our initial findings, we conducted an experiment where MNP-containing ICs were loaded into 

ECs and attracted by a magnet placed at a distance of 3 cm (Figure 11.8c). This strategy adds further 

value to the proposed device in terms of biomimetism. Besides its multicompartmental nature inspired 

by natural cells and self-assembly mechanism of constituents in which the LbL strategy is based upon, 

the use of MNPs can be considered to be a biomimetic approach inspired by unique structures with 

magnetic properties, such as magnetotactic bacteria [49-51]. Magnetic alginate beads have been used 

previously for applications such as water pollution remediation [52] and magnetic hyperthermia-

enhanced doxorubicin release [53], although the magnetic character was not exploited primarily for

380 

spatial mobilization. It took 42 s for all the beads to travel this distance and be completely immobilized. 

As soon as the magnetic compartmental units were exposed to the external magnetic field, they 

became attracted to the position at which the maximum magnetic field value was available to them at 

the surface of the PBS medium. As they got closer to the magnet they were exposed to a stronger 

magnetic field and the attraction increased. Movement stopped abruptly once they reached the position 

below where the magnet was placed. The normalized mean distance traveled by MNP-loaded ICs within 

ECs is represented in Supplemental Figure 11.4. This observation shows how the internal 

subcompartments can be customized to possess distinct functions, including distinct types of smart 

responsiveness. Specifically, the entrapment of superparamagnetic nanoparticles within microcapsules 

could be envisaged for applications that require immobilization, such as localized therapies, and 

magnetic resonance imaging. The developed devices should also permit the incorporation of living 

microorganisms and cells inside the EC, as its processing is performed in mild conditions [39]. 

11.4 Conclusion 

In conclusion, we presented a multifunctional system characterized by hierarchical organized spherical 

compartments. We showed that compartmentalized structures delimited by multilayer coatings can be 

customized to exhibit properties that are not found coupled in nature. Although the present work was 

limited to the proof of concept, we envisage that it can be improved in the future. Namely, the 

multilayer organization makes it possible to tune the permeability of the coatings just by changing the 

number of layers. Other stimuli could be coupled together: for instance, temperature, pH or light (e.g., 

from the incorporation of azobenzenes or spiropyrans) could be combined for multifunctional 

biosensors confining reactions. The genetic nature of ELRs further allows synthesizing biofunctional 

polypeptides for advanced applications, such as increased cell adhesion or enhanced biomineralization. 

Cells have been previously encapsulated within alginate beads, but we envision that coupling biological 

material with functionality such as controlled release of growth factors and provision of adhesion sites 

may improve cellular sustained survivability over time. Moreover, the addition of magnetic components 

provides such compartmentalized system potential for biotechnological and biomedical applications 

where spatial immobilization, high local availability of an active agent or monitoring by magnetic 

imaging is required.

11.5 Supplemental information 

11.5.1 Deacetylation degree of chitosan. 

Hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (
1
H-NMR) spectra were recorded using a Varian MR-400 

spectrometer to determine the degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan. Thus, 10 mg of chitosan was 

dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated water (D2O) and 20 µL of deuterated hydrochloric acid (DCl) to form a 

viscous solution. An aliquot of this solution was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube and the spectrum recorded 

at 60°C. 

The calculation of the DD is presented in Supplemental equation 11.1:

where Ix is the area of each of the peaks (x) identified in Supplemental Figure 11.1. The DD of the 

purified chitosan used was 81.6%. 

11.5.2 ELR transition temperature 

The aggregate sizes of ELR in solution were measured using a Nano-ZS from Malvern (United Kingdom) 

in the temperature range 25–37°C after stabilization for 5 min. Samples were prepared at 

300 µg?mL

 in PBS, pH 7.4. A total of 20 runs were performed for each sample to obtain an average 

value at stabilized temperature. 

In order to evaluate the thermal response of the featured ELR, the size variations of peptide aggregates 

in aqueous solution were measured as a function of temperature in small increments. It can be seen 

from Supplemental Figure 11.2 that the ELR forms aggregates of 4.4±2.8 nm at 25ºC and 

1290±113 nm at 29ºC. This abrupt size variation gives a Tt of 29ºC for the ELR. ELR self-assembly 

progresses further with increasing temperature

11.5.3 Rhodamine encapsulation losses 

The encapsulation efficiency of Rhod in either the inner or the external compartments was determined 

by fluorescence measurements of the retrieved supernatants during their construction using a Synergie 

HT microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA). Thus, 150 ?L of sample was pipetted into white, opaque 

96-well plates in triplicate. Ultrapure water was used as blank. The excitation (?exc) and emission (?em) 

wavelengths used for Rhod mass calculations were 530 and 590 nm, respectively. All supernatants 

collected during entrapment, construction and chelation stages were measured and quantified. The 

percentage Rhod loss was plotted for both each stage and cumulatively. 

All the supernatants collected during the construction of Rhod-loaded compartments (either internal or 

external ones) were used to calculate the losses occurred prior to the commencement of the actual 

release studies. The graphic in Supplemental Figure 11.3 shows the stage and cumulative Rhod losses 

with respect to the initial encapsulated mass.

When Rhod was loaded within the inner compartments, the construction process consisted of four 

stages: (i) entrapment within the CaCO3 particles (orange in the graphic), (ii) buildup of the (CHI/ELR)3 

multilayer (yellow), (iii) buildup of the external (CHI/ALG)3 multilayer (purple), and (iv) simultaneous

CaCO3 chelation and alginate bead liquefaction (grey). When Rhod was loaded within the external 

compartments, losses are only present in stages (iii) and (iv), when Rhod is introduced into the system. 

The sacrificial template was maintained until the end of stage (iii) to prevent early diffusion during the 

construction. Thus, Rhod could be protected and physically retained within the sacrificial template until 

the final stage of chelation. 

As mentioned previously, the quantity of Rhod loaded initially differed depending on whether it was 

encapsulated within the internal or the external compartments. As a result, we first quantified the Rhod 

losses during the construction of ECs containing Rhod-loaded ICs and found that 85% of Rhod had been 

lost at the end of the construction, thus meaning that only 15 ?g of the initial 100 ?g were effectively 

encapsulated at time-point “0”. In an attempt to encapsulate roughly the same mass of fluorophore in 

the ECs, we loaded them with the equivalent quantity of 15 ?g of Rhod during the ionic gelation step of 

1 mL of alginate. Note that this value disregards the subsequent loss of 47% that was further quantified 

following liquefaction of the bead. Furthermore, empty CaCO3-coated particles were loaded at the same 

time to keep the same subcompartmental structure.

Figure 11.8c depicted the magnetic responsiveness of the MNP-loaded ICs within ECs. As expected, a 

group of eight compartmental units were attracted by a magnet placed 3 cm away from their starting 

point. The normalized distance traveled by each capsule is plotted as a function of time in

As soon as the magnetic compartmental units were exposed to the external magnetic field, they 

became attracted to it. Subsequently they were exposed to an increasingly stronger magnetic field value 

and the attraction increased. Movement stopped abruptly once they reached the position at which the 

maximum magnetic field value was available to them.

 Chapter 12. Major conclusions and future perspectives 

The surface modification technique known as layer-by-layer (LbL) was employed successfully in 

accordance to the hypothesis of this thesis. Various substrates – both planar and three-dimensional – 

were coated with natural or biomimetic polymeric constituents distinct in functionality but sharing 

natural roots. It was then possible to develop multilayer devices intended for a wide range of biomedical 

applications, namely adhesive films, coatings for biomaterials, drug delivery carriers – for delivery either 

by drug diffusion or by cellular uptake – and microreactors with customizable properties. 

First, it was demonstrated that multilayer films can retain and exhibit the properties of their natural 

constituents. A phosphonate derivative of levan, a fructose polymer obtained from extremophilic 

microorganisms, allowed fabricating multilayer films with chitosan (CHI) that exhibited superior 

adhesive properties in comparison to a multilayer formulation of CHI and alginate (ALG) – two 

polysaccharides of marine origin widely regarded as good adhesive ingredients. The advantage of using 

levan was also evident by the superior cell adhesion to films containing this polymer, in comparison to 

CHI/ALG films. Future developments of levan-functionalized multilayer films may include tests using 

actual animal tissues to further evaluate their potential as wound healing coatings and tissue sealants 

for post-surgical procedures. 

Elastin-like recombinamers (ELRs) were used as a polypeptide constituent of most multilayer 

formulations presented herein. Its genetic origin, rooted in natural elastin, allowed using constituents 

exhibiting a precise amino acid content, sequence, length, and, most importantly, bioactivity. By using 

an ELR containing the bioactive sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), substrates with 

enhanced cell adhesion were made. Given the multiple stimuli-responsive nature of ELRs, it was 

demonstrated that, like in the case of levan, films containing these polypeptides also retained such 

responsiveness, namely toward temperature, pH and ionic strength. Raising any of these parameters 

above an upper threshold triggered the transition of the ELR adsorbed at the surface, leading it to 

exhibit charged amino acids toward the interface. This phenomenon was translated by an increase of 

hydrophilicity and surface roughness. 

The buildup feasibility of this ELR-RGD with CHI in a multilayer structure was monitored in situ using a 

quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM). Although a construction based on strong electrostatic interactions 

was first anticipated, there was evidence that weaker hydrophobic interactions could play an important 

role in this process between polysaccharides and polypeptide-based polymers. Resorting to the QCM 



Chapter 12 – Major conclusion and future perspectives 

394 

and the mathematical Voigt-based model for viscoelastic films, several distinct ELRs were combined 

with either CHI or ALG for the construction of hybrid films at distinct values of pH. The estimation of 

each of the films’ thicknesses led to the conclusion that not only electrostatic but also hydrophobic 

interactions drive the self-assembly of this type of multilayer films, judging by how thicker films could be 

obtained when using partially neutralized polysaccharides. This result provides a consistent basis to the 

development of future devices based on this class of coatings by ensuring that the best construction 

parameters are used in order to achieve thick films across various scales – nano to micro – and 

stability. 

LbL extrapolation to 3D was successful in the form of spherical microcapsules of CHI and ELR for the 

purpose of drug delivery, envisaging two forms of administration. The first consisted in the 

pre-encapsulation of a high molecular weight protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), within the 

microcapsules and its release by diffusion under distinct temperatures. It was demonstrated that the 

permeability of the multilayer shell was dependent on the temperature and on the number of layers. 

Thanks to the incorporation of ELRs in the multilayer formulation, its temperature-triggered phase 

transition led the microcapsules to be more retentive at physiological than at room temperature, a 

phenomenon also accompanied by a significant shrinkage of the capsular structures. As expected, a 

higher number of coating layers also provided a more effective barrier to the diffusion of the 

encapsulated agent. The reduced release rate verified at physiological temperature may help in the 

delivery of active agents (e.g., chemotherapeutics) that are necessary locally in small but controlled 

doses, i.e., within a therapeutic window. Varying the number of layers provided an additional means of 

control over the release kinetics, what helps further to achieve an appropriate drug release and 

bioactivity. Future developments may investigate the potential use of these carriers for the delivery of 

active agents instead of model proteins for a wide spectrum of molecular weights. Ideally, these should 

be studied under sink conditions, which ensure that the release medium is not saturated by drug so 

that its release is controlled solely by the delivery system and is not affected by its solubility. 

The second mechanism consisted in the delivery of microcapsules directly to the interior of the cells, 

where the whole cellular machinery is located. Using RGD- and RDG-functionalized microcapsules (with 

the latter being a nonfunctional analogue of the former) it was possible to determine that the 

mechanism of internalization of these capsules by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was due 

majorly to a mechanism of macropinocytosis and not due to the surface functionalization. This is an 

important mechanism of drug delivery since the delivery of drug carriers directly to the cells diminishes 

potential active agent losses to the extracellular environment by diffusion. Furthermore, drugs may be

395 

delivered to where they are most needed, ensuring a high drug availability and efficacy. However, the 

intracellular degradation – hence potential drug availability – was faster for RGD-functionalized 

microcapsules. Future experiments may focus on determining the mechanism behind the distinct 

intracellular processing rates, which seemed dependent on the surface functionalization of the 

microcapsules. Furthermore, growth factors and other differentiation agents may be encapsulated to 

exploit stem cell differentiation mechanisms dependent on controllable dosages and carrier size. 

Finally, it was shown that LbL allows achieving higher levels of functionalization, difficult to achieve 

using the most conventional surface modification strategies. Macrocapsules observable with a naked 

eye were delimited by CHI/ALG multilayers. This macrodevice exhibited compartmentalization and 

hierarchical organization from the nano- to the macro-scales. ELR-functionalized microcapsules served 

as microcompartments suspended within a confined ALG liquefied environment. The microcapsules 

could be loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, which provided the possibility to guide spatially the whole 

compartmentalized structure by applying an external magnetic field, which could be useful in 

applications that require mobilization to and immobilization at a site (e.g., guided therapies). 

Compartmentalization was exploited to encapsulate rhodamine as a model low molecular weight 

molecule either in the interior of the microcapsules or in the ALG medium. Release studies at distinct 

temperatures showed that rhodamine when encapsulated in the microcapsules was released at a lower 

rate at physiological temperature, thanks to the use of ELRs. When encapsulated in the ALG 

compartment, the release kinetics was not significantly affected. Incorporating distinct functions in a 

same system by carefully selecting its constituents lets foresee the construction of customizable 

microreactors that may exhibit other types of response, for instance, toward temperature, pH or light. 

Such a device could also be used as a platform for the development of microenvironments that 

simulate the formation of microtissues or the treatment of diseases at a laboratorial level. 

The work developed herein shows how LbL-based strategies have surpassed the simple purpose of 

modifying a surface. From the results obtained in each of the chapters of this thesis, it is clear that LbL 

permits to achieve high degrees of functionalization and complexity, both in bioactivity and geometry, 

for various distinct biomedical applications. Despite the potential of LbL, this technology has been 

limited to the fabrication of bidimensional devices – some already in medical use. Thus, it is expected 

that the superior functionalization may result in the development of strategies useful not only for 

conventional medical applications but also more cutting-edge ones in biomedical engineering, such as 

tissue engineering.
