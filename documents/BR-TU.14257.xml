Abstract
Background: Anesthesia for pediatric cardiac surgery is systematically performed in severely ill patients under abnormal 
physiological conditions. In the intraoperative period, there are significant variations in blood volume, body temperature, 
plasma composition, and tissue blood flow, in addition to activation of inflammation, with important consequences. Serial 
measurements of blood glucose levels can indicate states of exacerbation of the neuroendocrine-metabolic response to 
trauma, serving as prognostic markers of morbidity in that population.

Objective: To correlate perioperative blood glucose levels of children undergoing cardiac surgery with the occurrence of 
postoperative complications, and to compare intraoperative blood glucose levels according to perioperative conditions.

Methods: Information regarding the surgical/anesthetic procedure and perioperative conditions of patients was collected from 
the medical records. The mean perioperative blood glucose levels in the groups of patients with and without postoperative 
complications and the frequencies of perioperative conditions were compared by use of odds ratio and non-parametric 
univariate analyses. 

Results: Higher intraoperative blood glucose levels were observed in individuals who had postoperative complications. 
Prematurity, age group, type of anesthesia, and character of the procedure did not influence the mean intraoperative blood 
glucose level. The use of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was associated with higher blood glucose levels during surgery. 
In procedures with ECC, higher blood glucose levels were observed in individuals who had infectious and cardiovascular 
complications. In surgeries without ECC, that association was observed with infectious and hematological complications.

Conclusion: Higher intraoperative blood glucose levels are associated with higher morbidity in the postoperative period of 
pediatric cardiac surgery.(Arq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379)

Keywords: Heart defects, congenital; thoracic surgery; postoperative complications; blood glucose.

several defense mechanisms, defined as “neuroendocrine, 
immune, metabolic response to trauma”, aimed at surviving 
the initial injury. The endocrine changes and immune 
responses triggered lead to a set of metabolic changes 
to protect the major physiological functions2. However, 
similarly to other adaptive mechanisms, the exacerbation 
of that response can contribute to the perpetuation of 
the pathological state and occurrence of clinical-surgical 
complications3. 

Hormone variations to stress, such as elevations in 
circulating catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, and growth 
hormone, trigger a state of tissue resistance to the effect of 
insulin, with gluconeogenesis and catabolism of lean body 
mass4,5. The hyperglycemia generated, which has been 
long underestimated and considered a secondary event, is 
currently recognized as a predictive factor of poor prognosis 
in critical patients6,7. Studies in adults, investigating the 
intraoperative elevation in blood glucose levels in cardiac 
surgery, have also evidenced a positive correlation with 

Introduction
The perioperative period of pediatric cardiac surgery 

represents a crucial moment in the outcome of children 
with congenital and acquired cardiopathies. In that period, 
patients undergo significant changes in blood volume, body 
temperature, plasma composition, and tissue blood flow, 
with important pathophysiological consequences1. Additional 
aggressions, often inevitable, such as extracorporeal 
circulation (ECC) and total circulatory arrest, contribute 
to further aggravate the organic disarrangement in the 
intraoperative period1. The stress generated by surgery evokes

postoperative morbidity and mortality, both in diabetic and 
non-diabetic individuals8-10. 

Similarly to that which occurs in adults, the elevation in 
blood glucose levels in children is expected to be an early 
biological marker of clinical-surgical outcome, enabling the 
identification of groups at risk, even in the intraoperative 
period. The interpretation and management of such 
alterations, however, are adaptations of conclusions and 
generalized observations without the appropriate pediatric 
confirmation. The present study aimed at analyzing 
perioperative blood glucose levels of children undergoing 
low- and moderate-risk cardiac surgery, and at comparing 
them according to surgical/anesthetic conditions and the 
occurrence of infectious, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, 
neurological, and hematological complications, and of death 
in the postoperative period.

Methods
After approval by the Committee on Ethics and Medical 

Research, 160 consecutive cardiac surgeries performed in 
different children aged up to 16 years at the São Rafael 
and Ana Neri hospitals in the city of Salvador (state of 
Bahia), in the years 2007 and 2008, were retrospectively 
studied. All type 1, 2, and 3 procedures according to the 
Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) 
score were selected for the study11. 

The perioperative variables were collected in a 
standardized sheet with information regarding demographic 
data, preoperative conditions, type and complexity of 
the procedure performed, type of anesthesia, use and 
duration of ECC, and use of blood components. All 
patients underwent arterial catheterization for continuous 
measurement of arterial blood pressure, and samples 
were collected at least twice in the intraoperative period 
(right after arterial catheterization and at the end of the 
procedure) and at the surgical/anesthetic team’s discretion. 
Diuresis, insensitive losses, and the volume of crystalloids 
and colloids administered were computed in the final 
calculation of fluid balance, and the weight of surgical pads 
and gauzes, aspirated volume, estimated loss in the ECC 
circuit, and volume of blood components administered 
were used in blood balance.

Regarding preoperative conditions, the following data 
were collected: gender; age; prematurity; weight; primary 
cardiopathy (with greater clinical impact on the child); 
associated diseases (including secondary cardiopathies); 
presence of cyanosis; pulmonary hypertension; congestive 
heart failure or mechanical ventilation prior to surgery; 
and character of the procedure (elective or emergency). In 
addition, the last preoperative laboratory exams, including 
fasting blood glucose levels, were also assessed.

During surgery, the following data regarding the 
surgical/anesthetic act were collected: type of anesthesia 
(general anesthesia alone x general anesthesia with spinal 
anesthesia); surgery performed; ECC data; administration 
of blood components; use of vasoactive drugs, insulin 
and corticosteroids; and administration of glucose at any 
form or dilution. The laboratory exams of the period were 

performed in an automate blood gas analyzer (Radiometer 
Medical ABL 700, Copenhagen) of the same brand and 
model in both hospitals studied, with blood sample 
collected from the invasive arterial blood pressure system 
or from the arterial line of ECC. The mentioned blood gas 
analyzer measures not only the blood gas profile of the 
sample (pH, PCO

, PO

-, and BE), but also blood 

glucose levels, erythrogram (hematocrit and hemoglobin), 
lactatemia, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, 
and chloride). Because of the large variability in the 
number and time of intraoperative samplings, the initial 
and maximum blood glucose levels were recorded during 
surgery, as was the mean of the blood glucose levels 
collected during the period. 

In the postoperative period, the occurrence of death 
and complications was assessed based on the report of 
events in the medical record until the patient’s discharge 
from hospital. The types of complications were recorded 
in correlate groups according to the following pre -
established definitions: infections: confirmed situations 
or suspicion of infected site with the use of antibiotics; 
cardiovascular complications: occurrence of arrhythmias, 
total atrioventricular block, cardiac tamponade, use 
of vasoactive drug for more than 24 hours (infusions 
greater than 15 µg/kg/min of dopamine or any value of 
continuous infusion of noradrenaline and/or adrenaline), 
inotropic drug use for more than 24 hours (infusions up 
to 15 µg/kg/min of dopamine or any value of continuous 
infusion of dobutamine or milrinone), low cardiac output, 
and systemic arterial hypertension requiring sodium 
nitroprusside for blood pressure control for more than 24 
hours; respiratory complications: embolism, pulmonary 
edema, mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours 
in the postoperative period, and acute pulmonary injury; 
renal complications: acute renal failure (elevation greater 
than or equal to twice the baseline creatinine serum level) 
and/or dialysis need; neurological complications: coma, 
convulsion, neurological deficit, and stroke; hematological 
complications: coagulopathy (prothrombin and activated 
partial thromboplastin times greater than twice the normal 
value or fibrinogen lower than 100 mg/dL and/or platelet 
count lower than 80,000/mm3), hemorrhagic events with or 
without coagulopathy and need to return to the operating 
room for hemostasis review. A combined event was the 
occurrence of at least one of the complications listed. 

In the intensive care units (ICUs), the routine measurements 
of postoperative blood glucose levels obtained with digital 
glucometers (reagent strip – glucose oxidase method) were 
assessed. The values on admission and the mean value of 
the measures obtained on the first postoperative day were 
used in the analysis, because of the variation in measurement 
times (performed at least four times a day). The ICUs in 
the hospitals studied had a routine of at least 24-hour oral 
fasting after surgery with glucose administration (infusion rate 
between 5 and 10 mg/kg/minute) in the intravenous solution 
of hydro-electrolyte replacement during that period. Insulin 
therapy to control glycemia was used at the discretion of the 
physician in charge, being usually initiated in the presence 
of blood glucose levels over 250mg/dL.

Alves et al
Blood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery

The values of initial, maximum and average intraoperative 
and preoperative blood glucose, as well as the average of the 
values of the 1st postoperative day of patients who had or 
not complications were compared using the Mann-Whitney 
test. The effect of intraoperative blood glucose average on 
the chance of complications was calculated by binary logistic 
regression, adjusted according to the estimated risk (RACHS-1), 
and values were expressed as odds ratio with confidence 
intervals of 95%. The different mean intraoperative blood 
glucose levels according to prematurity, type of anesthesia, 
surgery character, and use of ECC were compared by use of 
the Mann-Whitney test. The mean intraoperative blood glucose 
levels according to age group and risk group were compared 
by use of Kruskal-Wallis test. The chi-square test was used to 
compare the relative frequencies of ECC use and complication 
rates according to risk groups. Effects and differences were 
considered statistically significant when p &amp;lt;0.05. 

Results
Of the 160 patients studied, 85 were of the male sex (75 

females), 90 had another associated disease, and only five 
were premature babies. Median age and weight were 36 
months and 13 kg, respectively, with a large variation range 
in sampling (15 days to 16 years, and 2.3 to 67 kg of weight). 
Most procedures (81% of the cases) were considered elective, 
general anesthesia alone being the most commonly used 
anesthetic procedure (76.8%) as compared to combined 
anesthesia (general plus spinal anesthesia). Extracorporeal 
circulation was used in approximately half of the surgeries 
(48%), with a median duration of 70 minutes and median 
aortic clamping time of 55 minutes. In 62.5% of the cases, 
transfusion of any type of blood components was required, 
and the patients had a median intraoperative diuresis of 3.67 
mL.kg-1 and median fluid and blood balances of +140 mL and 
+20 mL, respectively. The preoperative use of corticosteroid 
and the intraoperative administration of glucose or insulin were 
uncommon events in our sampling. Because of the surgical 
protocol of methylprednisolone use (30mg/kg) in ECC, the 
intraoperative corticoid administration rate was identical to the 
ECC use rate (Tables 1 and 2).

Graph 1 shows the evolution of blood glucose levels at 
different times in the perioperative period in patients with 
and without at least one of the previously listed complications 
(combined event). A statistically significant difference is 
observed in the maximum and mean blood glucose levels in 
the intraoperative period, with higher levels being observed in 
those evolving with a morbid event. Because the mean blood 
glucose level obtained from all samples during surgery probably 
better reflects the metabolic status than the unitary measures 
of blood glucose peak in that period, we chose to analyze its 
association with postoperative complications and the impact 
of possible confounding variables on it. 

Tables 3 and 4 show that prematurity, surgery character, 
type of anesthesia, and age group were not associated with 
differences in the mean blood glucose level during surgery. 
Extracorporeal circulation, with the concomitant administration 
of high doses of corticosteroid, however, was associated with 
significantly higher blood glucose levels in the period (Table 4).

The estimated RACHS-1 surgical risk11 has also influenced 
those values, with lower blood glucose levels in group 1, 
constituted by lower complexity surgeries (Table 5). Although 
the RACHS-1 score categorizes pediatric cardiac surgeries 
into six groups according to short-term mortality (in increasing 
order), the greatest blood glucose means were evidenced in 
group 2, with intermediate risk, and not in group 3, with a 
higher presumed risk. This probably reflects the higher ECC 
use rate in group 2 surgeries (Table 5), which concentrated the 
long-term intracavitary procedures, such as total correction 
of tetralogy of Fallot. In the present sample, group 3 was 
constituted mainly by short-term vascular procedures with

no ECC and a complication rate, such as pulmonary artery 
cerclage and systemic-pulmonary anastomoses, similar to 
that of group 2. Because of the presumed impact of ECC 
on intraoperative blood glucose levels, the surgical sampling 
was subdivided according to its use for a better analysis of 
the groups.

Table 6 shows that, in the surgeries without ECC, the patients 
experiencing infectious and hematological complications had 
higher means of intraoperative blood glucose levels than 
those without such complications. In the surgeries requiring 
ECC (Table 7), that association was evidenced for infectious 

and cardiovascular complications and combined events 
(occurrence of at least one of the complications mentioned). 
The death rate did not associate with the mean intraoperative 
blood glucose level in procedures with and without ECC.

Discussion
Although in adults higher blood glucose levels in the 

intraoperative and postoperative period of cardiac surgery 
are associated with higher morbidity and mortality6-10, little 
is known about that relation in the pediatric population. 
A large number of possible confounding factors, such as

Blood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery

prematurity of the physiological systems, greater availability of 
surgical procedures, and less uniformity in preoperative clinical 
conditions, makes conclusive results difficult to obtain. 

Figure 1 shows the perioperative variation of blood glucose 
levels in patients without intercurrences and those with at least 
one of the complications analyzed in the postoperative period. 
The mean and the maximum value found during surgery 
showed a positive statistical association with the occurrence of 
complications, which was evidenced neither in the measurements 
on ICU admission nor in the mean of the first postoperative 
day. This is the opposite of the result reported by Polito et al12, 
who found no association between severe complications and 
intraoperative blood glucose levels, but showed greater blood 
glucose levels in the first 72 postoperative hours among those 
with complications. Other studies13-15 have also shown higher 
postoperative blood glucose levels in children with morbidities 
after cardiac surgery. However, Rossano et al16, studying neonates 
recovering from the surgery to correct transposition of the great 
vessels, have reported that those who maintained, on the first 
postoperative day, blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/
dL for a long period (more than 50% of the time), had a higher 
risk of adverse events than those who maintained blood glucose 
levels over 200mg/dL. 

As previously mentioned, several confounding variables 
should be considered when assessing the results, and the sample 
should be subdivided for better analysis. Figure 1 shows the data 

of the general population studied, and the differences found in 
the mean and maximum blood glucose levels in the intraoperative 
period can be explained by the use of high doses of corticoid and 
of ECC. Both factors are associated with inherent complications 
and usually indicate clinical and surgical situations of higher 
risk, requiring a specific analysis of the subgroups. Regarding 
the mean blood glucose level of the first postoperative day, 
which did not differ in patients with or without intercurrences, 
other non-controlled variables, such as insulin use or glucose 
administration rate at the ICU at the discretion of the physician 
in charge, can have influenced the blood glucose levels of the 
two groups, hindering their interpretation and comparison with 
data in the literature.

When analyzing the clinical and surgical factors that can 
theoretically influence intraoperative blood glucose levels, the 
following were not associated with differences in the mean blood 
glucose level in the period: prematurity; age group; elective or 
emergency character of the procedure; and type of anesthesia 
used (general alone or general with spinal anesthesia). The 
use of ECC, however, was associated with significantly higher 
intraoperative blood glucose levels (Table 4). Although the 
corticosteroid dose of the protocol can explain that association, 
ECC per se is one of the major triggers of pro-inflammatory 
activity in surgery, with substantial elevations in cytokines and 
circulating interleukines17, thus, higher blood glucose levels are 
expected with ECC use. Thus, patients were subdivided according 
to ECC use in the surgical procedure for analyzing the relation 
between the mean intraoperative blood glucose level and the 
occurrence of specific complications of the major body systems 
in each situation (Tables 6 and 7). 

Based on the analysis of postoperative complication rates 
according to ECC use, this study showed that infectious 
complications were associated with higher intraoperative blood 
glucose levels, regardless of ECC use. In procedures without ECC, 
hematological complications were associated with higher blood 
glucose means during surgery, while in procedures with ECC, that 
association occurred with cardiovascular complications.  

When comparing with studies in the adult population, 
some differences in the subtypes of complications can be 
observed. Ouattara et al9, in a prospective analysis, have 
reported that a poor intraoperative blood glucose control, four 
consecutive measures over 200 mg/dL, was associated with 
greater rates of death and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and

Blood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery

neurological, but not infectious, complications in diabetic adults 
undergoing myocardial revascularization with ECC. Gandhi et 
al8, in myocardial revascularization surgeries, have reported 
greater intraoperative blood glucose means in individuals who 
developed renal and pulmonary disorders, but not cardiovascular, 
neurological, or infectious disorders, and/or died. Duncan et al18, 
however, have reported a positive association between a blood 
glucose level over 200 mg/dL during different cardiac surgeries 
with ECC in adults and the occurrence of infection and prolonged 
mechanical ventilation, even after multivariable analysis with 
control of probable confounding factors. In children, the studies 
usually approach the complications jointly, like combined events, 
focusing on the postoperative period of complex procedures with 

ECC. In some of the few studies on that population, Ghafoori 
et al19 have reported a greater risk of mediastinitis in individuals 
whose blood glucose peaks exceeded 130 mg/dL in the first 
24 postoperative hours, while Székely et al14 have reported a 
higher rate of heart failure and severe infections in children with 
hyperglycemia after cardiac surgery.

Diabetic patients represent a group at higher risk for 
postoperative infection in several surgical procedures. Even 
though the noxious effects of chronic hyperglycemia in the 
immune and vascular systems are known to increase the 
likelihood of infectious complications, acute hyperglycemia 
also has its own adverse effects. Experimental studies have 
shown the suppression of several aspects of immunity, such as

chemotaxis, phagocytosis, generation of free radicals, and the

in blood glucose levels. The increase in the concentration of 
circulating inflammatory cytokines has also been reported in 
acute hyperglycemia21, causing a pro-inflammatory state with 
reduced immune function, justifying higher infection rates in 
such situations.  

The reduction in the production and release of endothelial 
nitric oxide, the increase in angiotensin II levels, and the changes 
in vascular reactivity, also associated with hyperglycemia4, can 
cause disorders in the systemic and pulmonary circulations 
with consequent cardiovascular complications. Even 
arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunctions after cardiac surgery 
with ECC can be attributed to inflammatory changes in the 
heart parenchyma22, presumably proportional to the intensity 
of the inflammatory state.

Platelet dysfunctions due to a decrease in the nitric-
oxide-induced antiaggregating activity have been reported 
in hyperglycemic patients with acute coronary syndromes23. 
Hypercoagulability associated with an elevation in blood 
glucose levels has been demonstrated in situations of 
endotoxemia induced in humans24 and in patients with 
septic shock25. Such alterations in coagulation can explain 
the association observed between higher intraoperative blood 
glucose levels and coagulopathy in the postoperative period 
of surgeries without ECC, since both events are related to 
the magnitude of tissue trauma and the size of the wound 
area. In surgeries with ECC, the higher intensity of the 
anticoagulation used and the negative impact of ECC itself 
on the physiological systems of hemostasis constitute the 
major causes of postoperative coagulopathy1, which probably 
surpasses any effect of blood glucose levels in such situations.

The present study has the limitations expected from a 
retrospective study. Although positive associations between 
hyperglycemia and postoperative complications have been 
observed, causality cannot be established. The lack of institutional 
protocols to measure and control blood glucose levels hindered a 

longer postoperative follow-up and a more detailed assessment 
of possible intraoperative influencing factors (relationship of the 
markers with ECC variables, impact of specific anesthetic or 
surgical measures). The impact of other confounding variables, 
which were not assessed, cannot be eliminated in data analysis, 
since other elements can justify the associations found.

Several advances in medical knowledge and improvement 
in perioperative care have contributed in a favorable way to 
reduce morbidity and mortality in pediatric cardiac surgery. 
The intraoperative and immediate postoperative periods are 
important for the adoption of measures and managements that 
can favorably influence the clinical outcome of patients. Thus, 
laboratory markers of prognosis should be actively pursued to 
help the surgical/anesthetic team to improve their therapeutic 
decisions. As demonstrated in our study, higher blood glucose 
levels during cardiac surgeries in children did not correlate 
with mortality, but were associated with a higher occurrence 
of infectious, cardiovascular, and hematological complications 
depending on ECC use in the procedure. However, the impact 
of specific measures for controlling blood glucose levels, such 
as insulin administration in hyperglycemia, has not been 
consistently established in the literature, and further studies are 
required for its determination.
