Estruturas porosas, vidro, vitrocerâmicos, cristalização, funcionalização  
 
 
 

Na chamada cirurgia reconstrutiva decorre, presentemente uma notável 

mudança de paradigma em que se tende a passar da utilização de tecidos 

transplantados e implantes sintéticos, para uma abordagem de engenharia de 

tecidos que tem como objetivo regenerar tecidos danificados, usando para isso 

células do corpo e biomateriais porosos, que orientam o crescimento do novo 

tecido. 

O foco central desta tese foi a produção de estruturas porosas vitreas ou 

vitroceramicas, que exibem um comportamento bioativo e biocompativel, com 

reatividade superficial específica em fluidos fisiológicos sintéticos e interações 

célula-matriz alteradas pela composição e tratamentos térmicos aplicados. 

Entender o comportamento de sinterização e da interação entre os processos 

de densificação e cristalização do vidro foi fundamental  para avaliar as 

condições de sinterização ideais para a obtenção de uma estrutura porosa para 

aplicações em engenharia de tecidos. Foi realizado um estudo abrangente da 

sinterização, identificando o efeito da distribuição de tamanho de particula do 

pó de vidro e das variáveis do ciclo de sinterização na  produção de scaffolds 

de vidro com microestruturas funcionais. 

As estruturas porosas desenvolvidas, preparadas pelo método de sinterização 

com sal usando o sistema vitreo 3CaO.P2O5 - SiO2 - MgO, com adições de 

Na2O e um porogéneo, NaCl, apresentam uma elevada porosidade, 

interconectividade, distribuição de tamanho de poros e resistência mecânica 

apropriada para aplicações em estratégias de  regeneração óssea.  

A substituição de 6 % de MgO por Na2O na rede vitrea permitiu adequar a taxa 
de dissolução e bioactividade dos suportes porosos de vidro. Quanto à 
avaliação biológica, da incorporação de sódio na composição ocorreu uma 
inibição da resposta celular para períodos curtos. No entanto, foi demonstrado 
que, após 21 dias, a resposta celular é semelhante para ambas as 
composições. O comportamento in vitro dos suportes de vidro foi testado 
através da introdução destes em fluido corporal simulado (SBF) durante 21 
dias. A espectroscopia  por energia dispersiva de raios-X e as análises de SEM  
provaram a existência de precipitados de fosfato de cálcio sobre ambas as 
composições. 
 
A cristalização de whitlockite por ceramização das matrizes vítreas afectou o 

comportamento de dissolução em SBF. Em consequência dos diferentes 

tratamentos térmicos efectuados, foi possível produzir diferentes estados de 

cristalização e alterar a bioactividade e biocompatibilidade dos suportes 

porosos. 

Para recuperar e ajustar a bioatividade dos vitrocerâmicos com 82 % de fase 

cristalina foram aplicados diferentes métodos de modificação superficial 

incluindo a funcionalização com 3-aminopropil-triethoxysilane (APTES). A 

superfície do vitrocerâmico modificado exibiu a formação de uma camada de 

hidroxiapatite cristalina após 21 dias de imersão em SBF, enquanto que no 

vitrocerâmico base não se detetou a formação de fosfato de cálcio até 5 meses.

 As estruturas porosas ceramizadas apresentaram uma resistência mecânica 

adequada à sua aplicação em engenharia do tecido ósseo e degração  a uma 

taxa adaptável. Considerando-se a avaliação biológica, as estruturas porosas 

demonstraram um efeito indutivo sobre a proliferação celular, cujas células  

apresentaram uma morfologia normal e elevada taxa de crescimento. 

Este estudo abre novas possibilidades de utilização de vidros do sistema  

3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO para o fabrico de várias estruturas, ajustando 

simultaneamente a sua bioactividade e controlando o teor da fase cristalina. 

Além disso, o comportamento in vitro destas estruturas em contacto com 

células indicia o seu  elevado potencial  para  utilização no campo da 

regeneração do tecido ósseo.

Abstract 

 

Scaffold, Glass, glass-ceramic, crystallization, functionalization 

 

 

A paradigm shift is taking place from using transplanting tissue and synthetic 
implants to a tissue engineering approach that aims to regenerate damaged 
tissues by combining cells from the body with highly porous scaffold 
biomaterials, which act as templates, guiding the growth of new tissue.  

The central focus of this thesis was to produce porous glass and glass-ceramic 
scaffolds that exhibits a bioactive and biocompatible behaviour with specific 
surface reactivity in synthetic physiological fluids and cell-scaffold interactions, 
enhanced by composition and thermal treatments applied. 

Understanding the sintering behaviour and the interaction between the 
densification and crystallization processes of glass powders was essential for 
assessing the ideal sintering conditions for obtaining a glass scaffolds for tissue 
engineering applications. Our main goal was to carry out a comprehensive 
study of the bioactive glass sintering, identifying the powder size and sintering 
variables effect, for future design of sintered glass scaffolds with competent 
microstructures.  

The developed scaffolds prepared by the salt sintering method using a 
3CaO.P2O5 - SiO2 - MgO glass system, with additions of Na2O with a salt, NaCl, 
exhibit high porosity, interconnectivity, pore size distribution and mechanical 
strength suitable for bone repair applications.  

The replacement of 6 % MgO by Na2O in the glass network allowed to tailor the 
dissolution rate and bioactivity of the glass scaffolds. Regarding the biological 
assessment, the incorporation of sodium to the composition resulted in an 
inibition cell response for small periods. Nevertheless it was demonstrated that 
for 21 days the cells response recovered and are similar for both glass 
compositions. The in vitro behaviour of the glass scaffolds was tested by 
introducing scaffolds to simulated body fluid for 21 days. Energy-dispersive X-
ray spectroscopy and SEM analyses proved the existence of CaP crystals for 
both compositions. 

Crystallization forming whitlockite was observed to affect the dissolution 
behaviour in simulated body fluid. By performing different heat treatments, it was 
possible to control the bioactivity and biocompatability of the glass scaffolds by 
means of a controlled crystallization. 

To recover and tune the bioactivity of the glass-ceramic with 82 % crystalline 
phase, different methods have been applied including functionalization using 3-
aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES). The glass ceramic modified surface 
exhibited an accelerated crystalline hydroxyapatite layer formation upon 
immersion in SBF after 21 days while the as prepared glass-ceramic had no 
detected formation of calcium phosphate up to 5 months.  

A sufficient mechanical support for bone tissue regeneration that biodegrade 
later at a tailorable rate was achievable with the glass–ceramic scaffold. 
Considering the biological assessment, scaffolds demonstrated an inductive 
effect on the proliferation of cells. The cells showed a normal morphology and 
high growth rate when compared to standard culture plates. 

This study opens up new possibilities for using 3CaO.P2O5–SiO2–MgO glass to 
manufacture various structures, while tailoring their bioactivity by controlling the 
content of the crystalline phase. Additionally, the in vitro behaviour of these 
structures suggests the high potential of these materials to be used in the field 
of tissue regeneration.

CHAPTER I 

PREFACE 

I.1.  Introduction 

Advances in medicine have provided the man not only an increase in life expectancy, as well as 

the desire for a better quality of life. This has generated an increase in demand and consequently 

the development of new materials for use in grafts to restore function, remodel or even enhance 

bone structures.  

The restrictions related with the used of biological graft has led to the development of a newly 

emerging field of biomaterials called ‘tissue engineering’. One approach is to use three-

dimensional, porous, degradable scaffolds, which provide support while allowing the ingrowth of 

new bony tissue as the scaffold degrades. 

The developed biomaterials for bone regeneration are intended to interact with the tissue in a 

specific way, through the cellular and molecular stimuli, combining bioabsorption and bioactivity 

properties in the same material. The use of bioactive glasses has proved advantageous because it 

rapidly bonds to bone and degrades over time, releasing soluble products that are thought to 

stimulate osteoprogenitor cells. There are several methods which can be utilized to obtain porous 

scaffolds, and one of the simplest is the particulate leaching technique after the salt sintering 

method.

I.1.1. Research Objectives 

The central focus of this thesis is to develop porous glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds using the 

salt sintering method.  

To achieve these goals, the following issues were addressed: 

? Development and optimization of the sintering processes tailoring specific scaffold 

parameters affecting microstructural architecture, namely pore size, pore network 

geometry, hierarchical microstructures, and anisotropy of internal pore structures. 

 

? Changement of the base glass composition in the CaO?P2O5?SiO2 system by suitable 

additives (such as Na2O as modifier and MgO as stabilizer), aiming to obtain glass melts 

of controlled viscosity and workability to enlarge the “working window” for sintering. 

 

? Evaluation of the characteristics of surface reactivity and mechanical resistance of 

selected compositions.  

 

? Understanding of the effect of crystallization and functionalization on the surface 

reactivity in acellular medium and in cell cultures to allow assessing the best compromise 

in the fabricated scaffolds. 

 

I.1.2. Structure of the thesis 

This dissertation is structured in eleven chapters. Chapter I provides a succinct introduction, the 

research objectives and an outlook of the content of each chapter. Chapter II presents an extensive 

literature review that range from bone structure, to bioactive glasses, sintering and crystallization 

procedures and functionalization. Chapter III outlines the research methods used in testing the 

goals presented in Chapter I. 

The outcome of the experimental work is divided in the next seven chapters and correspond to 

the manuscripts resulted from the research activity that had been published or submitted to ISI 

journals. Finally, Chapter XI present the overall conclusions of the dissertation and describes 

potential future directions.

CHAPTER II 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

II.1. Bone Repair 

II.1.1. Bone tissue 

Bone tissue is a specialized connective tissue, which composition, organization and dynamics 

allow to participate in the mechanical functions of support, protection and mobility and mineral 

homeostasis in the body. According to the macroscopic structure, the bone may be divided into 

two categories, trabecular bone, also known as cancellous or spongy bone and cortical (or 

compact) bone. The major difference between these two types of bone is on the basis of porosity 

and the unit microstructure [1]. Cortical bone tissue is denser with low porosity (10 %) and 

surrounds the marrow space, whereas trabecular bone is composed of a honeycomb-like network 

of trabecular plates and rods interspersed in the bone marrow compartment, with an 

interconnected porosity between 50 and 90 %.  Both cortical and trabecular bone are composed 

of osteons, Fig. II.1. The osteon consists of a central canal called the osteonic (haversian) canal, 

which is surrounded by concentric rings (lamellae) of matrix. The osteonic canals contain blood 

vessels that are parallel to the long axis of the bone. These blood vessels interconnect, by way of 

perforating canals, with vessels on the surface of the bone [2]. 

 

 

 

Fig.II.1. The structure of bone [3] 

The bone mechanical loading functions and protection are achieved by both, the bone mineral 

phase which confers strength and stiffness while the organic phase, collagen, is responsible for

bone toughness and ductility. The cancellous bone works mainly in compression while cortical 

bone must withstand compressive forces, tensile and shear. The mineral component of bone are 

calcium phosphates, being the most important constituent, hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The 

association of the hydroxyapatite crystals with a size between 10-100 nm, with the collagen fibres 

is responsible for the hardness and strength characteristics of the bone tissue. The bone apatite 

structure also contains small amounts of fluorine, chlorine, sodium and magnesium [4].  

II.1.2. Bone cells 

The bone cells are responsible for producing, maintaining and modifying the structure of bone 

tissue. Distributed as a layer over the bone matrix are the osteoblasts, lining cells and osteoclast 

whereas osteocytes permeate the mineralised interior of the bone, as shown in Fig.II.2.  

 

 

Fig.II.2. Schematic diagram of bone structure at cellular level [5] 

II.1.2.1. Osteoblasts  

The osteoblasts are considered responsible for the synthesis and mineralization of bone during 

both initial bone formation and later bone remodelling. [6]. They produce many cell products, 

including the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and collagen, part of the organic unmineralized 

component of the bone called osteoid. Eventually the osteoblast is surrounded by the growing 

bone matrix, and, as the material calcifies, the cell is trapped in a space called lacuna. Thus 

entrapped, it becomes an osteocyte.  

II.1.2.2. Osteocytes 

The osteocyte is the most common cell. As mentioned before, they derive from osteoblasts which 

become enclosed within the bone matrix during bone formation. Each osteocyte communicates 

with its neighbours by means of gap junctions, through small channels in the bone matrix called 



II – Literature review 

7 

 

canaculi. Osteocytes are therefore in close communication with osteocytes and osteoblasts, 

supplying nutrients [7,8] 

II.1.2.3. Osteoclasts  

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells as they are formed from two or more cells that fuse together, 

which can resorb bone. They come from the bone marrow and are related to white blood cells. 

They are found on the surface of the bone mineral next to the dissolving bone [9]. 

II.2. Bone tissue regeneration 

The bone has the ability to promote its spontaneous regeneration and remodel its micro and 

macrostructure, through processes of osteogenesis (bone formation) and bone resorption [10]. 

However, when bone regeneration is required in large quantity, such as for skeletal reconstruction 

of large bone defects created by fracture or diseases, alternatives to complement the ‘insufficient’ 

bone-regeneration process are on demand. Autologous bone (bone removed from the patient) are 

still being considered as the “gold standard” bone-grafting material [11]. Since this kind of grafts 

is osteoconductive (provides a scaffold on which bone cells can proliferate), osteoinductive 

(induces proliferation of undifferentiated cells and their differentiation into osteoblasts), and 

osteogenic (provides a reservoir of skeletal stem and progenitor cells that can form new bone). 

Allografts obtained from human cadavers or living donors, is an alternative allogeneic bone 

grafting, which bypasses the problems associated with harvesting and quantity of graft material 

present in autologous bone [12]. Although bone repairs are still mostly performed by grafting, 

there are issues of immunogenicity and rejection reactions, possibility of infection transmission, 

and cost [13]. Due to the numerous constraints that such grafts exhibit bone graft substitutes were 

developed. Scaffolds made of synthetic or natural biomaterials, where developed to promote the 

migration, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells for bone regeneration [14–19]. While 

various biomaterials have been introduced to respond to this need, it is considered impossible to 

develop a biomaterial to fulfil the requirements to all desired applications [20–22]. 

One of the great challenges that biomaterials science faces today stems from the increasingly need 

of implants use, coupled with the significant increase in Human life expectancy. In fact, an 

increasing fraction of patients live beyond the expected life of your implants, so that new materials 

should present a durability of around 20 to 30 years, twice that found in materials used until the 

present. 

The target of tissue engineering is to restore structure and function to a defect and not only for 

replacement thereof [23], using the body’s natural healing response in addition to treatment with 

one or more of three elements: cells, signalling molecules and scaffolds [24]. There are two 

general strategies in the field of tissue engineering: the first focuses on in vitro seeding and 



II – Literature review

culturing specific cell types in a scaffold. The cells grow outside the body, become differentiated, 

and mimic naturally occurring tissues. These tissue-engineered constructs are then implanted into 

patients to replace diseased or damaged tissues. With time the scaffolds are resorbed and replaced 

by host tissues. The second strategy involves using the scaffold as a growth factor/drug delivery 

device using the body’s own systems, where regeneration of tissues is induced in vivo. After 

implantation cells from the body are recruited to the scaffold site and form tissue upon and 

throughout the matrices. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be easily 

combined [25].  

II.3. Scaffolds – Requirements 

Scaffolds are three dimensional (3D) structures that should exhibit tailored porosity, pore size and 

interconnectivity, providing an environment and architecture specific to favour tissue integration 

and vascularisation [26]. The material composition and structural characteristics such as the 

internal and external architecture are of crucial importance for the success of the tissue 

engineering strategies [27,28]. Ideally, scaffolds should favour cell attach, growth and 

differentiation [29]. The scaffolds must be constructed in order to allow the mimic of the 

regeneration process and should have an external shape adapted to the size and geometry of the 

defect [25]. After implantation, the scaffold should allow neovascularization, stimulate bone 

tissue formation and must be biodegradable or resorbable to allow for replacement of newly 

formed tissue [2]. It is desirable that in addition to the features previously mentioned, the matrix 

mechanical behaviour presents compatibility with the bone [4]. These properties should be 

maintained as matrix degrades and new tissue growth occurs [30]. Finally, the synthetized 

material and fabricated scaffold should be suitable for sterilization and the production technology 

must be scalable and cost-effective. These requirements will further be developed in the next 

points. 

II.3.1. Porosity 

Ideally scaffolds should have a high interconnected porosity to allow tissue and cell ingrowth and 

also vascularization of tissue, significant diffusion of nutrients and metabolic waste resulting from 

the activity of cells which will grow, meantime, in the scaffold [28, 31–33]. However, the degree 

of porosity also influences other properties, such as mechanical stability, and should therefore be 

balanced with the needs of mechanical deployment location, for use in vivo. The pore size is also 

of great importance, especially the implementation of the bimodal porosity for the effective 

scaffold vascularization and for bone ingrowth [34]. If the pores have a reduced size, pore 

occlusion occurs with the anchor of cells, which in turn will prevent cell penetration, production 

of extracellular matrix and neovascularization of the internal area of the scaffold.

To discuss the pore morphologies of the scaffolds it is necessary to stablish the size classification 

of pores. The International Union of Pure Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification of pore size 

for Catalysis application is micropores &amp;lt;2 nm, mesopores 2-50 nm and macropores &gt; 50 nm [35]. 

The follower pore size classification [33,36,37], is commonly used for scaffolds to be employed 

in bone regeneration, 1–20 ?m as micropores and macropores &gt; 100 ?m, even though the scale 

range of these dimensions are higher than those of IUPAC. 

Regarding the ideal size of pores, most authors consider advisable a diameter larger than 100-150 

?m to allow host cell components and extra-cellular bone tissue and blood vessels. Ensuring the 

supply of blood and providing a more effective and healthy growth of bone tissue (osteogenesis 

without preceding cartilage formation) [33,38–40],  and micropores (? 2–10 ?m) for cell 

adhesion, migration and osteointegration [41]. However, other authors [42] believe that bone 

reconstruction is obtained only through a 3D matrix with temporary interconnected macropores 

in the range of 1.2–2.0 mm. The latter approach reduces the mechanical resistance limiting the in 

vivo applications of these matrices [43].  

II.3.2. Surface 

The superficial properties of the materials namely chemical and topographical determine the ionic 

exchange dynamics and the protein adsorption. They also can control and provoke cellular 

adhesion, proliferation and differentiation [44–46]. A bioactive material induces the formation of 

a carbonate apatite layer biologically active on its surface, creating a compatible environment 

with osteogenesis. This mineralized interface assures the linking between the material and the 

bone tissue, resulting in the tissue regeneration [44]. Roughness mainly improves mechanical cell 

attachment, although the correlation of this event – increasing roughness – with cell attachment 

remains unknown [47–50]. Increasing the specific surface area and pore volume of bioactive glass 

may greatly accelerate the apatite formation and therefore enhance the bioactive behaviour [51]. 

II.3.3. Mechanical Properties and Biodegradability 

Strength is another important property of scaffolds considered for the replacement of load-bearing 

bone. The mechanical properties of the scaffold is strongly influenced by internal architecture 

[39,52–54] and must be carefully designed [55,56] to be suitable for bone regeneration. Ideally, 

it should be equivalent to bone in terms of the characteristics shown in Table II.1.

In addition to strength and elastic modulus, other mechanical properties such as fracture toughness 

are of crucial importance when implanted in load-bearing bone defects. The intrinsic brittleness 

and low fracture toughness limits the use of some materials in load-bearing implants. The 

mechanical properties should allow scaffolds to resist the pressure and maintain the porosity 

needed for cell growth and matrix production [4,21,52].  

At the same time, scaffolds should not only have similar mechanical properties to that of the host 

tissue, but also be able to degrade with time in vivo, preferably at a controllable biodegradation/ 

bioresorption rate (chemical dissolution or decomposition of biomaterials under physiological 

environments), without the need for surgical removal. The rate of degradation should vary based 

on its application and can be affected by several factors. Generally, it depends upon the chemical 

composition of the scaffold, the solubility of degraded products and the local pH of the 

surrounding environment. It also depends on the scaffolds crystallinity and physical arrangements 

like porosity pore size and distribution.  

The maintenance of the strength and stability of the interface during the breakdown and 

reconstruction of natural host tissue and the matching of the degradation rate of the support with 

the growth rate of new bone tissue are some of the difficulties in the development of scaffolds 

materials [53,58,59]. 

II.3.4. Biocompatibility 

One of the primary requirements of any bone scaffolds is biocompatibility a term that has been 

described in many ways. Biocompatibility of a scaffold is described in the William dictionary of 

biomaterials [60] as its ability to perform its desired function, that is, to support normal cellular 

activity with an appropriate response in a specific application.  

An ideal bone scaffold must be osteoconductive where the scaffold allows the bone cells to adhere, 

proliferate, and form extracellular matrix on its surface and pores. The scaffold should also be 

able to induce new bone formation through biomolecular signalling and recruiting progenitor cells, 

a property known as osteoinduction [61,62].  

II.4. Bioactive Glasses 

Several materials have been used with the aim of producing scaffolds mostly polymers of natural 

or synthetic origin and some ceramics/glasses [37,63–65]. Of all materials used in the 

manufacture of scaffolds, we will focus on glasses, the object of study of this thesis.  

The first glass to be approved for biomedical use, in 1985, was developed by Hench for use in 

middle ear surgery and is commercially available as Bioglass®, also designated as 45S5. The 

name ‘45S5’ refers to both the SiO2 content (45 wt. %) and the Ca/P molar ratio. Developed in 



II – Literature review 

11 

 

1969 it was produced like conventional glass in which the basic components are SiO2, Na2O, CaO 

and P2O5. The bioactivity of these materials refers to the special response that they induce upon 

contact with the physiological environment.  

Bioactive glasses develop on its surface a biologically active hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) 

layer which provides a bonding interface with the tissue, chemically and structurally equivalent 

to the mineral phase in bone [64,66–68].  

According to Hench [69,70], the process of apatite formation on silica-based bioactive glasses 

surfaces is divided into five stages, Fig. II.3: 

 

- Rapid exchange of Na+ and/or K+ from glasses with H+ or H3O
+ from solution, leading to 

a high pH local environment (stage I) 

Si–O–Na+ + H+ ? Si–OH + Na+ (Eq. II.1) 

- Loss of soluble silica in the form of Si(OH)4 and Si–OH, due to breaking of Si–O–Si 

bonds by the attack of H+ (stage II) 

Si–O–Si + H2O ? Si–OH + OH–Si (Eq. II.2) 

- Condensation and repolymerization of silanols Si(OH)4 to form a SiO2-rich layer depleted 

in alkali and alkaline-earth cations (stage III) 

- Precipitation of Ca2+ and PO4
3- ions on the silica-rich layer to form an amorphous calcium 

phosphate-rich layer (stage IV) 

- Crystallization of the amorphous film by incorporation of OH- and CO3
2- anions (stage V)

Fig.II.3.  Schematic representation of the process of apatite formation on bioactive 

surfaces in contact with SBF [71] 

The presence of this HCA layer is considered to be useful but not critical for bone mineralization 

[72,73]. Bioactive glasses [68,74,75] typically contain less than 60 wt. % of SiO2 and large 

amounts of alkali and alkaline-earth oxides. The alkali and alkaline-earth ions are exchanged with 

H+ (or H3O
+) ions from the solution, leading to the hydrolysis of the silica groups and the creation 

of silanol (Si?OH) groups on the glass surface. The increase in pH (or OH? concentration) leads 

to attack of the SiO2 glass network, and the dissolution of silica, in the form of silicic acid, Si(OH)4, 

into the solution, and the continued formation of Si?OH groups on the glass surface, which 

decreases the leaching of ions. At this stage, Ca2+ and PO4 groups migrate from the fluid to 

the silica-rich layer, and finally a CaP-rich layer is deposited on top of the glass which crystallizes 

to hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) [2].  

The 45S5 composition consists of a silicate network (45 wt. % SiO2) incorporating 24.5%Na2O, 

24.5%CaO and 6 % P2O5 (wt. %). The high amounts of Na2O and CaO, as well as the relatively 

high CaO/P2O5 ratio make the glass surface highly reactive in physiological environments. Over 

the years other compositions were developed with additional elements incorporated in the silicate 

network, (table II.1) such as fluorine [76], magnesium [77,78], strontium [79–81], iron [82], silver 

[83–86], boron [87–91], potassium [92] or zinc [18,93,94]. The development of new biomaterials 

has recently concentrated on SiO2-free glasses [91,95–98].  

The first materials incorporating magnesium oxide were Ceravital glasses (40?50 SiO2, 10?15 

P2O5, 5?10 Na2O, 0.5?3.0 K2O and 2.5?5 MgO (wt. %)) and the resulting glass-ceramic materials. 

Kokubo et al. [43] worked with glasses of SiO2–CaO–P2O5-MgO. Vogel and Holand [99] 

developed the Bioverit family of glass ceramic in which MgO content is in the range 6 ? 28 mol. %. 



II – Literature review 

13 

 

Regarding to MgO, its contribution to the bioactivity is controversial [100]. MgO has been 

documented to decrease apatite formation in SBF [101] but also, on the other hand, to improve 

the early stages of mineralization [102] and contribute to an intimate contact with living tissue, 

showing that it is possible to design glasses with high MgO content (~ 18 %) without loss of 

bioactivity [103].  

The development of phosphate glasses for biomedical application in the early 80's, introduced by 

Gilchrist [104], allowed an adjustment of the chemical composition to the mineral phase of bone, 

and a wide range of degradation rates as a function of this composition, adaptable to the required 

application [58,59].  

Recent studies have shown that the ionic products, resulting from glass dissolution, enhance 

osteogenesis by regulating osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression 

[7,25,68,80,105,106]. In vitro testing of biomaterials is used to provide rapid data on the 

biological interaction of materials with cells. This in vitro and also the in vivo tests showed that 

there is a sequence of bioactive glass reaction with tissues [2,107], and 6 more stages were added 

to the 5 presented before: 

 

- Adsorption of biological moieties in the SiO2-hydroxycabonate apatite layer from 

surrounding tissues (stage VI) 

- Action of macrophages to remove debris from the site allowing cells to occupy the space 

(stage VII) 

- Attachment of stem cells on the bioactive glass surface (stage VIII) 

- Differentiation of stem cells to form bone growing cells, such as osteoblasts (stage IX) 

- Generation of extra cellular matrix (stage X) 

- Mineralization of matrix through crystallisation of inorganic calcium phosphate matrix to 

enclose bone cells in living structure (stage XI) 

II.5. Bioactive Glasses Applications 

The first clinical applications of a bioactive glass were solid plates [43] for replacing the bones 

of the middle ear, 1985, but most current applications are based on particulates [64,74]. The first 

particulate material cleared for sale was PerioGlas®, in 1993 in USA and in Europe in 1995. Their 

initial clinical applications were to restore bone loss resulting from periodontal disease [64,108] 

and in middle ear surgery [109]. Bioglass® particulate is also used for the treatment of dentinal 

hypersensitivity, incorporated into toothpaste, or used with an aqueous vehicle and applied to the 

tooth surface around exposed root dentin [110]. Building on the successes of PerioGlas®, a 

Bioglass® particulate for orthopaedic bone grafting, in non-load-bearing sites, was introduced in 



II – Literature review 

14 

 

clinical applications in the European market in 2000, under the trade name NovaBone®. In 

orthopaedic applications, the development and improvement of these glasses were directed 

mainly to the enhancement of the mechanical properties, through the preparation of glass-

ceramics (section II.8).  

In the form of scaffolds, the porosity allows new bone tissue to grow into the porous structure, 

providing an adequate biological fixation [111–114]. The interest in bioactive glasses has been 

expanded since their initial discovery and now it is also focused on tissue engineering applications.  

All compositions, in Table II.2, were or are being used in scaffold production.

The large range of compressive strength values reported (0.3–140 MPa) can be interpreted by the 

differences in the fabrication method, glass composition, pore morphology and size distribution, 

and thickness of the struts, as well as on the mechanical test parameters employed (sample 

geometry, size and loading speed).  

Generally, Bioglass® composition is unsuitable for the production of glass scaffolds, because a 

sintering process is employed in all known methods for the processing of scaffolds. The sintering 

process requires temperatures above the glass transition temperature of the glass, in order to 

initiate the densification of the powder and, the Bioglass® crystallises immediately above its glass 

transition. Even after crystallization, most of the compressive strength values are out of the range 

obtained for trabecular bone, as can be seen in Table II.1.   

The following section is a short review of the common scaffold fabrication methods presented on 

Table II, including the advantages and disadvantages of each. 



II – Literature review

II.6.1. Polymer foam replication   

The replication method involves the preparation of glass green bodies’ foams by coating a 

polymer foam with a glass slurry. The polymer, having the desired pore structure, simply serves 

as a sacrificial template for the glass coating. The polymer template is immersed in the slurry and 

the excess slurry squeezed out leaving a more or less homogeneous coating on the foam struts. 

After drying, the polymer is slowly burned out in order to minimise damage to the glass coating. 

Once the polymer has been removed, the glass network is sintered to a desired density. Their 

microstructure depends on the initial morphology of the preformed foam. The foam replica 

technique has the ability to produce foams with a highly porous structure and adjustable pore 

dimensions. Moreover irregular shapes can be produced to match the size and shape of the bone 

defect. 

By using the described method, different types of scaffolds with tailored gradient of porosity were 

fabricated. Chen et al. [118] were able to prepare a porous 45S5 bioactive glass-ceramic scaffold 

with 89 to 90 % porosity by using a polyurethane template. With the introduction of magnesium 

and potassium, a 13–93 glass-ceramic scaffold was prepared by the same method with similar 

porosity and a compressive strength of 11 ± 1 MPa [131], which match the highest values reported 

for human trabecular bone (Table I). These compressive strengths values are more than 10 times 

higher than the reported for 45S5 Bioglass® based scaffolds [118] as a result of the glass 

composition that improves the viscous flow characteristics of 13–93 glass and the glass 

densification prior to crystallization. 

II.6.2. Glass fibers 

Sintering bioactive glass fibers is also an interesting method to achieve a scaffold with 

interconnecting porosity. In this process, the scaffold is formed by thermally bonding a loose and 

random packing of fibers in a mold. The relative porosity, pore size and strength of these scaffolds 

can be controlled by changing certain parameters such as the size of the fibers, temperature and 

sintering time [154,155]. Pirhonen et al. [155] used the glass system 53SiO2–6Na2O–12K2O–

5MgO–20CaO–4 P2O5 (wt. %) to obtain fibers with 100 mm in diameter and 3 mm length. 

Through the glass fiber technique, scaffolds were obtained with 80 % porosity and pore average 

size of 420 ?m, by sintering at 690 °C. Porosity in the form of interconnected pore space is 

provided by the pore space between the glass fibers. With the increase of sintering temperature, 

the densification of the structure increases, reducing the relative porosity and pore size with 

consequent loss of pore interconnectivity.  



II – Literature review

II.6.3.  Foam glass 

The use of foaming agents to the sol-gel has been studied by several authors [123,128,156,157]. 

Yuan, et al. have adopted H2O2 as a foaming agent to prepare and manufacture 45S5 bioactive 

glass scaffolds, with pore sizes ranging from 100–600 ?m [157]. The H2O2 decomposition process 

leads to a random distribution of interconnected pores. An increment in the porosity, pore size 

and interconnectivity degree was observed by Navarro et al. [123] with the increase of H2O2 

content. The hydrogen peroxide lead to the formation of pores with a particular morphology, 

elongated at lower concentrations and more spherical at higher concentrations. The scaffold with 

higher porosity (55 %) obtained with the addition of 60 % H2O2 showed pore size greater than 

500 ?m.  

The produced scaffolds belongs to the porous SiO2 (100S), SiO2–CaO (70S30C) and CaO–P2O5 

–SiO2 (58S) systems, have a specific surface area between 106 to 283 m
2 g-1 because of the 

nanopores in the glass that are inherent to the sol–gel process, mechanical strength of 2.2 – 2.4 

MPa, similar to spongy bone and porous hydroxyapatite used clinically [128,156]. Consequently 

they are suitable for substituting defects in low-load sites only. In the foam glass technique, as the 

temperatures increase the glasses become substantially crystallized and their degradability will 

decrease. It is also difficult to control the percentage and pore size, and the interconnectivity of 

the prepared materials making it challenging to obtain geometries and porosity appropriated to 

the desired application. 

II.6.4. Burning out method 

As a porosity promoter, it is also possible to use organic particles such as sucrose [126], gelatin 

[158], naphthalene [159], polyethylene [135], corn, potatoes and rice starches [78,149]. The 

organic phase can be added to ceramic powders and subsequently it is thermally removed during 

sintering. PEG-glycol particles of different sizes and amounts were used to retrieve a porous 

bioactive glass after sintering [160]. The sintering occurs only at temperatures higher than the 

firing temperature of the porogen. This approach presents low production costs, however 

controlling the composition of the finished products is difficult because of glass tendency to 

crystallize during thermal treatment, resulting in problems of homogeneity and reproducibility. 

In addition, it is difficult to achieve highly porous samples with adequate mechanical properties. 

A porosity value between 50 and 70 vol.% has been reported for glass-ceramic scaffolds based 

on a SiO2–CaO–K2O system [126,135]. However, lower porosity values are often reported 

[78,149]. Macroporous glass-ceramics of the CaO–P2O5–Na2O–TiO system were obtained by 

pressing and sintering a mixture of glass particles with sucrose (particle diameter &gt; 500 µm). Low 

sintering temperature, high sucrose glass ratio, and small glass particles size provide high porosity, 

approximately 80 to 90 %. However, the use of low sintering temperatures, impairs the

mechanical strength of the structure [126]. Another similar process consists in mixing particles 

of camphor (C10H16O) with Bioglass
® 45S5 [146]. Macropores were obtained with a diameter 

between 200 – 300 µm. However, this technique yielded only 21 % of the total porosity with 

isolated pores, not being thus possible to simulate the intertrabecular bone. Soundrapandian et al 

[159] have produced 63 – 66 % porous bioactive glass scaffolds based on SiO2–Na2O–ZnO–CaO–

MgO–P2O5 system (BGZ and MBG) for drug delivery using naphthalene as a porogen. The 

naphthalene was evaporated from the samples via very slow drying up to 80 ºC, followed by 

sintering at approximately 725 ºC. 

Li Nas et al. [125] prepared macroporous sol–gel bioglasses using granular polyethylene glycol 

(PEG) as pore former with 60 – 70 % porosity. The pore diameter was distributed around 10 – 

200 ?m containing mesopores of 2 – 50 nm. The volume and size of pore former can control the 

porosity and the macropore diameter. 

II.6.5. Leaching particle/Salt sintering process 

This is a simple way to make a porous scaffold using water-soluble particles such as salts NaCl, 

K2SO4 and MgSO4 that are dissolved leaving pores of the same size as the salt. The pore structures 

can easily be manipulated by controlling the size and fraction of the porogen. Unless sufficient 

porogen is used it may be difficult to leach it from the glass, and at high percentages, the 

mechanical properties of the scaffold are substantially reduced. The most common porogen used 

is NaCl. Depending upon the glass / salt ratio, this technique allows to obtain values of porosity 

of about 75 % [151,152]. The scaffolds thus obtained have a very low mechanical strength of 0.29 

MPa [151].  

The selected salt must have a suitable particle size, melting temperature higher than the 

temperature of densification of the glass and a high solubility in a solvent in which the glass is 

insoluble. The added salt should not induce the formation of new phases in the glass composition 

during sintering. Regarding this technique, it can be established that the densification of the 

sintered material is greater, the smaller the size of the glass particles with respect to the salt.  

This technique has the advantage of being quite simple, but the results were still not satisfactory 

since the control of processing variables and their effect on sintering characteristics of the 

supports has not been investigated. Further studies are necessary and will be performed in this 

thesis. 

II.6.6.  Solid freeform fabrication 

Solid freeform fabrication (SFF), also referred to as rapid prototyping (RP), describes a group of 

techniques used to manufacture 3D objects from a computer aided design (CAD) file, without the 

use of traditional tools such as dies or molds. The technique can be used to predesign the scaffold

architecture structure on a computer. Several SFF techniques have been used for scaffold 

fabrication, but there is little information on the production of glass scaffolds based on these 

techniques. Recently, scaffolds of apatite–mullite glass–ceramics, 13–93, and 6P53B glasses have 

been manufactured using freeze extrusion, selective laser sintering and robocasting methods 

[124,153]. In the last method, an aqueous paste of 6P53B bioactive micron-sized glass powder is 

extruded through a fine nozzle, printing lines as thin as 30 ?m, and deposited over the previous 

layer, obtaining a scaffold with a compressive strength of 136 MPa, comparable to human cortical 

bone [65].  

II.6.7. Freeze casting of suspensions 

The freeze casting route involves rapid freezing of a ceramic slurry, poured into a mould and 

subsequent freeze drying to sublimate the solvent under vacuum, avoiding the drying stresses and 

shrinkage that may lead to cracks and warping during normal drying. After drying, the compacts 

are sintered in order to fabricate a porous material with improved strength, stiffness and desired 

porosity. The result scaffold has a complex and often anisotropic porous microstructure. By 

controlling the growth direction of the ice crystals, it is possible to impose a preferential 

orientation for the porosity in the final material. A benefit of the oriented microstructure is higher 

scaffold strength in the direction of orientation, compared to the strength of a scaffold with a 

randomly oriented microstructure. Unidirectional freezing of aqueous suspensions has been used 

recently to produce oriented bioactive glass scaffolds. The process commonly results in the 

formation of porous constructs with a lamellar microstructure. However, the width of the slot-like 

pores (10 – 40 µm) is considered to be too small to support tissue ingrowth. Both 45S5 and 13–

93 glass scaffolds have been prepared using this technique [129,141]. Bioactive glass 13–93 was 

used in the fabrication of scaffolds with pore diameters of 100 – 150 ?m and oriented columnar 

microstructures by unidirectional freezing of camphene-based suspensions. It has also been 

shown that the addition of an organic solvent such as 1, 4 - dioxane to the aqueous solvent, results 

in a change of the lamellar microstructure to a columnar microstructure with an increase in the 

pore width.  

II.7. Sintering 

In all the methods used for the production of 3-D structures from glass particles it is necessary to 

resort to sintering. During the heat treatment the viscosity of glass dramatically decreased. 

Because of surface tension effects, that vary as a function of surface curvature, material flows are 

driven toward the particle necks, thus densifying a powder compact into a ceramic solid.  

The overall sintering process was roughly divided in three steps, fig. II.4, that have been analyzed 

by Frenkel (initial stage) [161,162], Scherer (intermediate stage) [163,164], and Mackenzie – 



II – Literature review 

21 

 

Shuttleworth, MS model (final stage) [165,166]. These stages are defined according to the 

porosity and grains morphology. 

The initial stage consists of fairly rapid interparticle neck growth by diffusion, vapour transport, 

plastic flow, or viscous flow. For a powder system with an initial density of 50 – 60 % of the 

theoretical density, this corresponds to a linear shrinkage of 3 to 5 % or to a relative density of 

65 %. In the intermediate stage pores form a network of channels between the interconnected 

particles. This stage ends when the relative density reaches about 94 %, that is, when the open 

pores gives rise to closed pores. During the final stage, all the porosity becomes isolated and the 

increase in density of the compact is not as high as in previous stages. The number of pores tends 

to decrease. In some cases, these closed pores may trap gases, making their elimination difficult.  

 

 

Fig.II.4.  Illustrations of the stages of sintering: initial package (a), initial stage (b), 

intermediate stage (c) and final stage (d) [167] 

A few models and a variety of experiments have been proposed and conducted on viscous flow 

sintering. The first work on the sintering of glass was originated from the theory of viscous 

sintering by Frenkel. Using a simple energy balance (the energy dissipated by viscous flow is 

equal to the energy gained by the reduction of surface area during sintering), the Frenkel classical 

model for the isothermal densification successfully described parts of the sintering process. After 

a sintering time t, the linear shrinkage (?L) of the sample relative to the original length, L0, is 

given by Eq.II.3 



II – Literature review 

22 

 

                               Eq. II.3 

Where ?(T) is the temperature-dependent shear viscosity, ? is the glass-vapor surface energy 

(whose temperature dependence is very weak), and r is the initial particle radius. Eq.II.3 

demonstrates that the initial shrinkage rate is inversely proportional to the viscosity and particle 

size. 

The non-isothermal sintering investigation has been performed by dilatometry, using a variety of 

heating rates, in order to expand beyond the isothermal mechanistic approach to initial stage sinter 

modeling. 

Venkatu [168] developed an initial stage sintering model which includes the heating rate. The 

focus of the work was to determine which of the six sintering mechanisms were the cause of 

dimensional change during heating, Eq. II.4. 

                   Eq. II.4 

where Q' is a constant with the value of 24.27 kJ mol-1, for the viscous flow, ? is a constant that 

only depends on the material and of the sintering mechanism and p is the sintering exponent, 

which presents the values of p = 1 for viscous flow, p = 2 for volume diffusion and p = 3 for the 

diffusion mechanism by grain contour.  

An inhibition source of densification is the crystallization of the particles. In the optimum 

sintering process, glass full densification should occur before the onset of crystallization. In the 

glass sintering, densification occurs in the interval between glass transition temperature and the 

onset of crystallization. If this interval is too small, the glass may not have time to fully 

densification prior to initiating crystallization [174]. Crystallization brings a marked reduction in 

the densification by viscous flow, for approximately 10 % of crystals formed, the apparent 

viscosity increases about 100 times, resulting in a sudden reduction in the viscous flow with stop 

of the shrinkage, which can be observed in dilatometric curves [175].  

The densification prior crystallization of 10 ?m glass particles is affected by the heating rate as 

showed by Boccaccini et al. [176] in the Ba–Mg–Al–Si–O system. They used two heating rates, 

one at 15 and another at 1 ºC min-1. The crystallization was delayed to higher temperature in the 

sample heated at a faster heating rate, and a full densification was obtained. However, at 1 ºC min-

1, a densification of 89 % was obtained at the same final temperature.  

Shrinkage is also affected by the initial particle size factor [169,170] and consequent degree of 

particle orientation. Glass particles with mixed size distribution sintered about five times faster 

than glasses with equivalent average particle size and spherical uniform size distribution. In

general, the particle orientation contributes to inhomogeneous green packing and consequent 

anisotropic shrinkage behaviour [171,172]. The effects of particle shape (ball-milled and 

spheroidized), uniaxially pressed powders effects on shrinkage anisotropy during sintering of 

cordierite-type glass [173], showed that both types of particle compacts exhibited around 0.7 

anisotropy factor, but that spheroidizing reduced the shrinkage rate.  

Anisotropy of shrinkage is a common phenomenon in the sintering practice. When sintering a 

cylindrical sample, for example, it can be observed that the shrinkage in the axial direction differs 

from that in the radial direction [171,172,174]. Anisotropic shrinkage appears not to be a simple 

particle shape effect but may be related to particle packing and size distribution in the axial and 

radial directions [175,176].  

II.8. Crystallization 

Despite the discovery of Bioglass in 1971, there is still no vitreous scaffold structure successfully 

produced [177]. Bioglass crystallizes immediately above the glass transition temperature, yielding 

a glass ceramic scaffold, resulting in the formation of Na2Ca2Si3O9 as the main crystalline phase 

[178,179]. A secondary minor phase, Na2CaSi3O8, is sometimes suggested [180]. Glass-ceramics 

are obtained by using an appropriate thermal treatment on the parent glass [57,64,181,182]. The 

composition of the crystalline phases and the crystallite sizes, within the residual vitreous matrix, 

define the properties of the final material [182].  

Many bioactive glass-ceramics have reached commercial success (table II.4). Ceravital (apatite-

devirrite) was the first glass-ceramic material for clinical applications, developed in 1973 [109]. 

Clinical use of this bioactive material was limited, due to instability of the crystal phase 

boundaries in the glass-ceramic.  

One of the glass-ceramics of higher clinical success is Cerabone ® A-W (apatite-wollastonite), 

introduced by Kokubo in 1982 [43]. So far, the clinical use in vertebral replacement and spinal 

repair has provided acceptable results [183]. In 1983, Holand et al. [70,99], of the University of 

Jena, developed a new series of bioactive glass-ceramics, called Bioverit® I (mica–apatite) and 

Bioverit® II (mica).

The effect of crystal phases in the bioactive mechanisms is still under debate. The mechanism of 

apatite formation on glass-ceramic A-W is essentially the same as that on Bioglass in the Na2O–

CaO–SiO2–P2O5 system. However, glass-ceramic A-W forms an apatite layer on its surface 

without forming a silica gel layer first as showed by Kitsugi et al. [185]. 

The effect of crystallinity on the apatite formation on Bioglass® surfaces in vitro [186] revealed 

that the crystal phase Na2Ca2Si3O9 slightly decreased the formation kinetics of such layer on the 

glass sample surface but it did not totally suppress it [118,149,187]. It has been suggested that the 

precipitation of the apatite layer depended on the presence of a residual glassy phase in the glass-

ceramic [188]. On the contrary, it was found [189] that fully crystallized samples could also 

develop a crystalline HCA layer, but that the reaction rate significantly reduce with the degree of 

crystallization, for crystallization values higher than 60 vol. % [190,191]. It is possible that the 

bioactivity is due to the presence of the Na2Ca2Si3O9 [118], since this crystal phase is bioactive

by itself [70,192], through the transformation of the crystalline phase into a reactive amorphous 

phase.  

  

Boccaccini et al. [193] modelled the degradation mechanisms of 45S5 glass-ceramics in three 

basic steps: 

(i) Preferential dissolution takes place at the interface between Na2Ca2Si3O9 crystallites 

and residual glassy phase. The so-produced gaps allow the physiological solution to 

penetrate into the material and to promote a diffused ion leaching from the crystalline 

phase.  

(ii) Crystallites progressively break down into very fine grains and the amorphous matrix 

is dissolved as a consequence of the ion exchange.  

(iii)  As a consequence, in the end, the crystalline phase changes into an amorphous phase. 

If the crystallization slowed down the bioactivity, it is possible to adjust this parameter through 

controlled crystallization to match the natural healing rate of bone tissue, through low dissolution 

rates as well as low resorptions, according to the requirements of the application. If the bioactive 

behaviour is hindered due to crystalline phases, it is possible to improve the resorption behaviour 

by modifying the surface of the material. 

II.9. Functionalization 

The surface properties of the glass ceramics are sometimes different from those required by 

biomedical applications. Several approaches have been investigated to optimize the performance 

of biomaterials, namely glass ceramics in contact with living tissues [194]. The biomaterial 

surface can be modified by mechanical, physical, chemical or biological treatments, in order to 

induce an appropriate tissue response. Indeed, the variation in chemical functional groups is 

known to affect hydrophobicity, Fig. II.5, which in turn affects protein adsorption and 

conformation, subsequently affecting various cellular responses [195].

Fig.II.5.  Illustrations of the surface wetting types a) Ordinary Surface “typical wetting, 

b) Hydrophobic “poor wetting” and c) Hydrophilic “good wetting” [196] 

Among the variety of methods, silanization has been recently investigated [119,197–201]. Silica 

surface interacts with the silane reagent to form a covalent bond with the surface, Fig. II.6. 

 

Fig.II.6. Schematic of APTES adsorption to the glass-ceramic surface [202,203] 

This attachment, of functional organosilanes to silica and glass substrates, has proven to be an 

efficient means of immobilizing antibodies and cellular receptors [201,204]. Successful and 

reproducible conditions require a silane uniform monolayer deposition on the glass surface that 

requires a cleaned surface. The cleaning treatment process is important to promote both surface 

removal of contaminants and exposure of reactive hydroxyls. Several cleaning methods have been 

proposed in the literature, such as the use of acetone [205,206], acids or alkali treatments [207]. 

The acids commonly used include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, and nitric 

acid. Alkali treatment involves immersion of the implants in either sodium or potassium 

hydroxide followed by heat treatment and rinsing in distilled water.  

After surface activation silanization can be performed. The most common silane coupling agent 

used is 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) [208,209], which reacts with the free hydroxyl 

groups of activated carriers to generate silane modified surfaces, Fig. II.6. The amine groups of 



II – Literature review 

27 

 

the silane modified surface react with a dialdehyde cross linker forming an aldehyde derivatized 

surface, which further reacts with the free amino groups of the antibody/protein to be immobilized.  

Since bioactive glasses have the ability to undergo ion-exchange processes which, in contact with 

simulated body fluid (SBF) [210–213], leads to the formation of silanols, and then to the further 

steps of hydroxyapatite formation, it seems to be possible to pre-activate the surface to enhance 

the cell responses [194,206]. However, the fast condensation of silanols to silica gel imposes a 

deep control of surface cleaning and activation to preserve the presence of free -OH groups on it.  

The Bioglass® derived glass-ceramic scaffold [206] was exposed to surface functionalization 

(acetone + APTES) and further grafting with alkaline phosphatase, to disrupt the stable 

Na2Ca2Si3O9 crystalline phase, further enhancing the formation of the calcium phosphate phase 

in SBF.

The present chapter deals with the experimental procedures and techniques used in the course of this work. 

Each of the following seven chapters has a section on “Materials and Methods”, but due to constraints of 

article length, this section is short. A description of the experimental aspects from the production of the 

glasses, sample preparation and sample characterization is presented.   

 

Chapter III 

Materials and Methods 

 

III.1. Materials 

In this thesis four compositions of calcium phosphate glasses were produced which are presented in 

Table III.1.  

Table III.1. Glass composition (mol. %). 

mol. % CaO P2O5 SiO2 MgO Na2O 

G31N0 32.68 10.89 25.43 31.00 - 

G29N2 32.68 10.89 25.43 29.45 1.55

G25N6 32.68 10.89 25.43 24.80 6.20 

 

The glasses were prepared by melting mixtures of carbonates and different oxides in platinum 

crucibles at temperatures between 1400 and 1550 °C using an electrically heated furnace. The 

melt was kept at this temperature, for 2 h, to ensure the attainment of high homogeneity. 

All the reagents presented analytical purity and were not submitted to further purification Table 

III.2.

Table III.2. Reagents and purity. 

Reagents Suppliers Purity 

SiO2 Fluka 99.9 % 

MgO Fluka 99.9% 

CaCO2 Fluka 99.9% 

Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O Fluka ?99% 

Na2CO3 Sigma ?99.5% 

NaCl BDH ?99% 

 

A water soluble salt, sodium chloride, supplied by BDH, having a purity of 99 % was used as 

porogen for the production of scaffolds. The function of the salt is to act as an intermediary phase 

among the glass particles, being easily removed by dissolution after the thermal consolidation of 

the part. 

III.2. Sample preparation 

Glasses were prepared in both bulk and frit form.  

III.2.1. Bulk samples 

The bulks were obtained by pouring the melt into a stainless steel plate to obtain glass blocks 

followed by glass annealing at temperatures above Tg, for 30 minutes, and then slow cooled to 

room temperature. The dimensions of the blocks were approximately 40 × 30 × 7 mm3. The 

annealed bulk glass samples were cut into slices (~4mm thickness) using a low speed (275 rpm) 

diamond saw (Buehler ISOMET 1000 Precision Saw). The slices were cleaned in an ultrasonic 

bath with alcohol for 15 minutes. 

III.2.2. Glass powder 

The glass powders were produced from glass frits, which were obtained by quenching the glass 

melts in cold water. The frits were dried in a heating chamber at 60 º C, then milled for 20 to 30 

min, depending on the composition and particle size distribution, in an agate mill, and sieved in 

order to obtain a fine powder with particle size ? 20 ?m. 

 

 



III – Materials and methods 

47 

 

III.2.3. Glass powder compacts 

Rectangular bars (5 x 5 x 10 cm3) with a green density of 1.60 ± 0.01 (corresponding to 0.60 of 

relative density) were obtained by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa, for 30 s, using a hydraulic press 

(CARVER Laboratory Press – Model C). 

The samples were sintered up to 850 ºC, in non-isothermal conditions.  

Some glass compact samples have been mounted in thermosetting resin (before and after sintering) 

and dried in air atmosphere. After mounting, the glass sintered compact samples were ground with 

abrasives in order to obtain the desired surface finishing. After that, a fine polishing was performed 

using 6, 3 and 1?m diamond pastes, for further microstructural studies. 

III.2.4. Glass scaffolds 

Glass-salt mixtures with NaCl average particle sizes in the range of 212-500 ?m, and varying 

weight contents (0, 10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 90 and 100 wt. %) were mechanical mixed, during 15 min, in 

a turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. The weight amount of the glass and salt powder in 

the mixture was estimated using the rule of the mixtures of binary composites. 

Before sintering, the mixture powders were uniaxially pressed in a 10 mm diameter die. Cylindrical 

glass/salt compacts with an initial geometrical density of 1.60 ± 0.02 g.cm-3 were obtained by 

uniaxially pressing at 175 MPa. 

The best conditions for thermal cycling were established from the dilatometric curves. 

After sintering, the salt crystals were leached using distilled stirring water at 30 ºC for 1 day to 

form the scaffold pores. The water was changed at intervals of 1 hour for the first 6 h and 

approximately 2 h for the remaining immersion time.  

The pore size can be controlled by the size of the salt crystals, and the porosity by the glass/salt 

weight ratio. The samples weight was recorded after and before sintering, in order to control the 

salt losses and ensure that all the salt had been leached to avoid unexpected impact on cells in 

future studies. 

III.2.5. Glass-ceramic bulk and scaffolds crystallization 

Bulk and scaffolds glass-ceramics samples were prepared following a one-stage crystallisation 

process. The glass samples were heated at 5 ºC min?1 up to the optimum crystallisation temperature, 

as revealed by DTA studies, and held for the optimum crystallisation time. After heat treatment, the 

bulk samples were polished with diamond pastes of 15, 6, 3 and 1µm particle size.

III.3. Samples Characterization 

III.3.1. Powders particle size distribution and specific surface area 

In order to determine the morphological characteristics of the glass powders, powder particle size 

distributions were carried out by a laser particle size Coulter LS Particle Size Analyser 230, 

Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA. The particle size distribution of the sodium chloride was 

carried out by sieving with cuts at 212 and 500 micrometres. 

The specific surface area of the glass powders, salt and scaffolds were determined by physical 

adsorption of nitrogen gas, using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a 

Quantachrome Quantasorb equipment, Germany, was used, and before determining the volume of 

adsorbed gas, samples were kept under vacuum at 200 °C, for 4 h.  

III.3.2. Density 

The real powder density of glass powders was determined by helium pycnometry (Accupyc 1330 

pycnometer).  

The density of the CaO–P2O5–SiO2–MgO glass system compacts, at given temperatures during 

sintering, was determined from the green density and the measured shrinkage using the relation, 

given by Eq. III.1, 

? =
?0

((1??a/a0)
2 (1??h/h0))

                            (Eq. III.1) 

where h and a are the length and width of the samples. 

The final density of the sintered compacts was also determined by using the Archimedes principle. 

 

The green density of the glass/salt mixtures was geometrically measured. The theoretic density of 

the glass/salt mixture was estimated using the rule of the mixtures, equation III.2, 

1

??,?

?????
?????

+
???

???
 (Eq. III.2) 

where ?t,m- theoretic mixture density, ?salt – salt density,  ?fr  - glass density,  frf  - glass powder 

volume fraction and saltf - salt powder volume fraction. 

The apparent scaffold density of the sintered scaffolds was determined geometrically.

III.3.3. Thermal analysis 

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glasses and of the salt was performed at a constant 

heating rate of 5 ºC min-1 in a SETARAM LABSYS equipment, in order to identify the nature of 

the reactions that occur during heating and the corresponding temperatures. For the glass system 

CaO–P2O5–SiO2–MgO, this analysis was performed within a range of heating rates from 5 to 40 °C 

min-1 to study the crystallization mechanism and calculate the relevant parameters associated. The 

onset of crystallization peak temperature (Tc), the crystallization peak temperature (Tp) and the 

heating rate (?) were used to discern the crystallization behaviour of glasses in this system. 

 

Dilatometry allows the in-situ monitoring of any sample dimensional changes with the temperature 

variation. It was performed on pressed glass, salt and glass/salt mixture powders. This 

characterization was done up to 1000 °C, at constant heating rate conditions in a horizontal Bahr 

Thermo Dilatometer DIL801L, Hüllhorst, Germany. For the glass system CaO–P2O5–SiO2–MgO, 

this analysis was performed within a range of heating rates from 5 to 20 °C min-1 to study the 

crystallization mechanism and calculate relevant parameters associated. 

The mean values and the standard deviations (SD) presented for the thermal expansion coefficient 

(CTE) determined for all glasses in the studied compositions, have been obtained from the 

characterization on each of three samples, using compact powders (10 mm diameter and 5 mm 

thick). 

III.3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  

The crystallographic characterization was performed at room temperature in a Geigerflex powder 

diffractometer Rigaku D / Max SérieC equipped with a curved graphite monochromator using 

CuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02º s-1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

technique was used to evaluate the presence of crystalline phases in the powder compacts. The 

identification of crystalline phases was made using the base PDF (Powder Diffraction File) data 

provided by JCPDS / ICDD (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards / International 

Centre for Diffraction Data, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, USA). 

 

The amount of the crystalline phase (crystallized volume fraction) contained in the glass-ceramic 

bulk and scaffold samples was determined according to the procedure used by Krimm and 

Tobolsky [1]. The percent crystallinity, CI, was calculated by the ratio of the crystalline area, CA, 

present in the diffractogram of the glass-ceramics and the total area, TA (amorphous + crystalline), 

present in this diffractogram using Eq. III.3 [2]:

                      CI = (CA/TA) x 100                                           (Eq. III.3) 

III.3.5. High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) 

The formation of the crystalline phases within the glass powder was also followed by high 

temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) using a Philips X'Pert diffractometer, model MRD and 

also Cu-Ka radiation. Data were collected in a continuous scan type from 10º to 70º, with a step 

size of 0.02º and a counting time of 1 s per step. The in situ analysis was performed on glass 

powders each 10 ºC while being heated in air, from 770 to 900 ºC, using a heating rate of 10 ºC 

min-1 and a dwell time of 45 min per scan.  

III.3.6. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy provides information about the chemical bonding or 

molecular structure of materials. The spectra were collected using a FTIR, Brucker tensor 27. For 

this purpose, the glass powder and scaffolds (reduced to powder) samples were mixed with KBr 

(ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using a hand press.  

The FTIR spectra of the bulk samples was recorded using a Golden Gate single reflection diamond 

ATR system, with no need for sample preparation.  

All spectra were collected over a region of 4000–400 cm?1 and are the average of two independent 

measurements with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1. 

III.3.7. Magic angle spinning-Nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) 

Glasses containing 6 and 0 % sodium oxide were investigated by 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance 

(MAS-NMR) spectroscopy to determine the distributions of SiO4 structural units, Qn, where n is 

the number of bridging oxygen atoms bound to other Si atoms, as a function of composition. 29Si 

MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ASX 400 spectrometer operating at 79.52 MHz (9.4 

T) using a 7 mm probe at a spinning rate of 5 kHz. The pulse length was 2 µs and a 60s delay time 

was used. Kaolinite was used as the chemical shift reference. 

III.3.8. Beam bending method - Viscosity 

Viscosity, ?, is probably one of the most important properties in glass making because it strongly 

influences the melting, fining and pouring conditions of the glass. During glass forming processes 

the viscosity must be tightly controlled to maintain a high product quality. A three point beam 

bending method was used to evaluate the viscosity. The measurements were performed in a Bahr 

Thermo analyse equipment (type 401), carried out under a stress of 0.45 MPa at 10 ºC min-1, in the

51 

 

glass transition range as described in ISO 7884-4 [3] and ASTM C1350 [4]. These analysis were 

performed in the Otto Schott Institute of Materials Research (OSIM) at the Friedrich Schiller 

University of Jena, Germany. 

III.3.9. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was the technique utilized to perform the microstructural 

characterization of all samples. The SEM equipment used is a Hitachi, Model SU-70, with a 

maximum acceleration potential of 25 KeV and a resolution of 15Å, coupled with X-ray energy 

dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). 

For glass powders observation, a drop of powder suspension in 2-propanol (0.1g/10ml) was 

deposited on aluminum sample holders further dried at 60 °C.  

Sodium chloride powders were deposited on a double-sided carbon tape-adhesive.  

The crystalline phases were observed by SEM using fracture surfaces of the compacts and scaffolds, 

under HCl acid attack for 3 seconds. All compact and bulk samples were fixed with glue carbon 

(Neubauer Chemikalien, Münster, Germany). 

All samples were coated with a thin carbon film by deposition on Emitech K950 equipment. The 

elemental compositions of the samples were qualitatively identified by EDS in the SEM. 

III.3.10. ImageJ analysis 

ImageJ is a Java based image processing and analysis software developed by the U. S. National 

Institutes of Health, of public domain (available from http://imagej.nih.gov/). Parameters like grain 

size, median aspect ratio (defined as the major axis divided by the minor axis) and orientation 

distribution were determined through image analysis of SEM micrographs, using the ImageJ 

freeware, as detailed in Chapter IV. Editing functions used comprise contrast manipulation, 

sharpening, and edge detection. The calculation of area and pixel value statistics were performed 

using analysis functions.  

To perform the image analysis, SEM micrographs were generally modified in the following way: 

contrast enhancement, median filtering and thresholding to obtain suitable binary images, Fig. III.1. 

The particles’ sections were manually drawn and evaluated before and after thresholding to avoid 

errors in particles’ area, Fig. III.1b. An elliptical shape was assumed for the quantitative analysis of 

grain shape and orientation, Fig. III.1c.

manual drawing of particles and binarization, (c) resulting ellipses. 

An orientation factor was assumed to quantify the degree of shape anisotropy and orientation of the 

particles. Concerning particle orientation analysis, the direction perpendicular to the press 

conformation (x-plane direction) corresponds to 0° and the parallel direction to 90 º. This 

orientation factor is defined as the fraction of weighted cumulative lengths (sum of the length 

multiplied by the aspect ratio) of particles with orientation in the ranges 0°- 45° and 135º - 180º, as 

schematically represented in Fig. III.2.

planes (a) and scheme of the orientation range (0 º - 45 º and 135 º -180 º) considered in 

the orientation factor) (b). 

Around 900 particles in 3 micrographs were considered for every sample. The error was 

determined by the standard deviation of the values obtained from the different images. 

III.3.11. Static contact angle 

In order to study the changes of the wettability of the glass-ceramic surfaces after surface 

modification treatments, static contact angle measurements were obtained by the sessile drop 

method [5] using a contact angle meter OCA15+ with high-performance image processing system 

from DataPhysics Instruments, Germany.  

Ultrapure water (with a resistivity of 18.2 MU cm) obtained with a Milli-Q Ultrapure water 

purification system (Millipore, Bedford MA, USA) was added by a motor driven syringe, at room

temperature. Three measurements were taken in different regions and an averaged on each of five 

samples for each surface modification treatment, was considered.  

III.3.12. Scaffold Porosity 

The porosity of the scaffolds from each experimental group (n = 5 to 10 per group) was determined 

from the ratio of the measured apparent scaffold density and calculated theoretical scaffold density.  

Mercury intrusion porosimetry was also performed to characterize the macropores in the porous 

structure, based on the phenomenon of capillary rise of non-wetting liquid like mercury. Pressure is 

needed for the mercury to overcome the capillary force and intrude into the pores. To fill smaller 

pores, higher pressure is required. Therefore, the mercury volume intrusion into pores as a function 

of applied pressure reveals the information of the pore size distribution. 

In principle, the mercury intrusion porosimeter can measure the pore size from 6 nm to 350 ?m, 

which is determined by the highest pressure and lower pressure of 4.45 and 0.5 psia, respectively. 

However, there is always some inter-space between the sample and the wall of the chamber, where 

mercury cannot enter during the pre-filling. This makes the high-end measurement accuracy of 

large pores questionable. On the other hand, for the low end of the measurement, the high pressure 

might crack the fragile small pores walls, which could make the results inaccurate.  

Overall, for our porous glass material, the practical range of this technique was from 100 nm to 300 

?m. It was used an AutoPore IV 9500 V1.07 serial 734 porosimeter (Micromeritics) in Institute 

Pedro Nunes, Coimbra. A pressure of 0.5 psia (0.0034 MPa) was applied to pre-fill the chamber 

with mercury. The pressure then increases step-wisely for generating intrusion curve, which was 

used to calculate pore size distribution. 

III.3.13. Scaffold water absorption 

Water absorption measurements were performed on the sintered porous samples. The mass of 

leached samples was measured under various conditions: dry (

measurements were made after immersion in water, removing excess water from the sample 

surface with a plain paper, not very absorbent. The water absorption (WA) is given by equation

III.3.14. Scaffold Mechanical properties 

The study of the mechanical properties of the produced bioactive glass scaffolds was focused on 

the mechanical response in compression loading only, giving values of the compressive strength 

and of the elastic modulus for the selected deformation rate. Six cylindrical leached samples, 

with 10 mm diameter and 10 mm thick were subjected to compression tests in a universal 

mechanical testing machine Zwick / Roell Z020, at 0.5 mm min-1 and a cell load of 20 KN. Prior to 

mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth parallel 

surfaces.  

The elastic modulus from compression tests was determined from the initial linear region of the 

stress–stain curve and the average compressive strength, taken as the highest stress on the stress–

strain curve, for six samples tested.  

III.4. In vitro evaluation 

III.4.1. Bioactivity studies  

The definition of bioactive was given by Hench [6], who initiated this subject of research with his 

colleagues in the early 1970s, “a bioactive material is one that elicits a specific biological response 

at the interface of the material which results in the formation of a bond between the tissues and the 

material”. The use of simulated body fluid (SBF) as first proposed by Kokubo et al. [7], allows to 

make an in vitro evaluation of the ability to precipitate calcium phosphates on its surface, the first 

indication of a potentially bioactive material.  

III.4.1.1. Simulated body fluid (SBF) 

Conventional simulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) was chosen as proposed by the Technical Committee 

ISO 23317 of International Organization for Standardization, in 2012, for in vitro evaluation for 

apatite-forming ability of implant materials [8]. The SBF was synthesised by adding the reagent-

grade chemicals in the order listed in Table III.3 into distilled water, and buffered at pH 7.40 with 

trishydroxymethyl-aminomethane ((CH2OH)3CNH2) and 1.0M hydrochloric acid at 36.5 ºC. This 

SBF is an aproteic and acellular solution with pH and composition simulating those of the human 

plasma (Table III.4). The SBF solution was prepared according to the formulation of Kokubo and 

Takadama [9].

The in vitro bioactivity was assessed by soaking the bulk and porous samples in SBF for periods 

from 1 h up to 28 days. To better understand the nature of the precipitated layer and also to obtain a 

sufficiently representative thickness layer, crystalline bulk samples were also analyzed for 10, 20, 

30 days and 5 months. Subsequently, the samples were placed in polyethylene bottles containing 

SBF, and kept for various periods of time, without shaking, in an incubator at 37 ºC, in accordance 

with a protocol referred in literature [10–13]. Four samples were used for each immersion time, 

chapter VI to VIII. A constant specimen surface area to solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1 was used 

in the immersion tests, previously filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. For the scaffolds it 

was considered the value of the surface area given by the BET method. After removal from the 

SBF, the samples were washed in distillated water and dried at 60 ºC.

III.4.1.2. Apatite layer characterization 

After SBF immersion, the apatite layer deposited on the samples was detected by SEM/EDS. The 

microstructural observation of the samples’ surface, before and after immersion in SBF, was 

carried out by SEM in the equipment referred in Section III.3.9.  

Surface modifications of the materials after immersion were also studied by XRD, reducing the 

samples to powder. 

The chemical structure of the glass and glass-ceramic surfaces, before and after SBF immersion, 

was analysed by Fourier transform attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  

III.4.1.3. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) 

Elemental concentrations of the SBF before and after soaking of the glass and glass-ceramic 

samples (plates and scaffolds) were measured as a function of the immersion time [14], using 

inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Jobin Yvon 70 Plus, France), at the 

Laboratório Central de Análises from the University of Aveiro. 

III.4.2. Biocompatibility studies 

Biocompatible glasses and glass-ceramics are desired to generate the most appropriate beneficial 

cellular or tissue response in a specific situation. However, the definition does not explain what 

type of glass dissolution behaviour is desired in various applications. To understand the influence 

of the presence of biomaterials on cells, osteoblast cells have been used in different tests. Cell 

morphology, adhesion and proliferation were examined and then, cell activity was tested by 

measuring the amount of some specific enzymes produced, in this study, alkaline phosphatase.  

III.4.2.1. Human bone marrow cells 

In order to study the morphology, attachment and proliferation, Fig. III.3, of osteoblastic cell 

cultures over the glass bulk slices and scaffold surfaces, a human bone marrow (HBM) osteoblastic 

cell culture was used. 

Human marrow cells, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed 

consent), was cultured, in ?- Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10 % Fetal 

Bovine Serum (FBS, Biochrome, Germany) and 100 mg.ml-1 penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin and 2.5 

mg ml-1 fungizone, in controlled atmosphere conditions (37 ºC, 5 % CO2, 100 % humidity). 

Detachment of confluent low passage cells was performed using 0.05 % tripsin and 0.25 % EDTA 

solution (Sigma, USA), for 10 min at 37 ºC. Subsequently, HBM cells were cultured over samples

57 

 

in a concentration of 105 cell ml-1 and incubated in controlled atmosphere conditions for 24 h and 6 

days (results in Chapter VII) and up to 21 days (chapter IX).  

After each incubation period, samples were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Sigma, 

USA) solution and fixed in Gluteraldehyde 2.5 % (V/V) for observation by means of CLSM, 

Leica SP2 AOBS. After fixation, samples were dehydrated in crescent ethanol concentrations 

(50 %, 70 %, 90 % and 100 %), air-dried and sputter-coated with gold. 

 

Fig. III.3. Cell attachment and spreading mechanism [15]. 

 

III.4.2.2. Cell viability/proliferation 

Cellular cytotoxicity and viability/proliferation at each time period, was measured on triplicate 

samples by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrasodium bromide) colorimetric 

method, first developed by Mosmann [16]. 

This test is based on the capacity of viable cells to metabolize tetrazolium salt by forming purple 

formazan crystals, which can be dissolved and quantified by measuring the absorbance of the 

solution at 600 nm in an ELISA reader (Synergy HT; Biotek) and is commonly used for cell 

viability evaluation. Cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere 

containing 5 % CO2 with 0.5 mg.ml
-1 of MTT, followed by material samples wash with PBS for 

macroscopic surface area observation. Results were evidenced by the formation of a dark purple 

staining and expressed as A.cm-2. 

III.4.2.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity 

The colonized materials were treated with 0.1 % triton in water (to lyse the cell layer) and the cell 

lysates were evaluated for alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and total protein content. ALP was 

assessed by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol phosphate in alkaline buffer solution, pH 10.3, for 30 

min at 37 ºC. The resultant products are phosphate and p-nitrophenol. The last, turns the resultant 

solution into yellow, which can be measured by colorimetric determination at k = 405 nm. Results 

are expressed in nanomoles of p-nitrophenol produced per min per µg of protein (nmol min-1/µg 

protein).

III.4.2.4. Statistical analysis 

Statistical significance between groups was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 

followed by Tukey multiple comparison test post-analysis to evaluate statistical differences among 

samples. All values are expressed as mean and SD. A p-value below 0.05 was considered 

significant.

CHAPTER IV 

EFFECT OF PARTICLE SIZE IN THE ANISOTROPIC SINTERING OF THE 

3CAO.P2O5-SIO2-MGO GLASS POWDER 

Abstract 

Understanding the sintering behaviour and the interaction between the densification and 

crystallization processes of glass powders during sintering is essential for assessing the ideal sintering 

conditions for obtaining a glass scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Our main goal was to 

carry out a comprehensive study of the bioactive glass sintering, identifying the powder and sintering 

variables effect on densification, for future design of sintered glassy materials with competent 

microstructures for functional applications in biological systems. This study was performed by 

dilatometric measurements, at different heating rates, using glass powders with different particle size 

distributions and detailed microstructural analysis with quantification of anisotropic parameters. The 

glass powder compacts could be densified at sintering temperature below 800 ºC through viscous 

sintering. The activation energy of sintering, Es, was evaluated by the application of Venkatu’s 

equation for non-isothermal conditions and similar values were found for compacts with different 

particle size distributions. 

When using the dilatometer, the load exerted on the sample by the dilatometer push-rod induced a 

significant increase of shrinkage anisotropy. The measured value of k for sintering under the 

dilatometric load and for the free sintering were always k&gt;1, i.e., the samples shrank less in the 

direction of shaping pressing of green compacts. However, an interesting finding was that by a small 

adjustment of particle size distribution and decrease of the average powder particle size, from 6.8 to 

3.5 µm, very different sintered microstructures could be obtained. Near full densification and 

negligible microstructural anisotropy was reached before crystallization in the finer glass compacts, 

whereas the coarser glass powder compact presents reduced final density and microstructural 

anisotropy.

IV.1. Introduction 

Sintering of glass powder is a physical process that occurs by viscous flow [1]. It has the advantages 

of the attainment of different controllable porosities and complex forms, varying the format of the 

pressing mold, which cannot be acquired by the usual techniques of glass conformation. In scaffold 

fabrication to understand the sintering conditions of the base glass powders and the interaction 

between sintering and crystallization of the material is essential. By knowing the thermal behaviour 

and, consequently, the structural transformations of glasses, the process can be optimized to achieve 

the highest possible densification of the scaffold. Densification of the glass prior to crystallization is 

particularly important since the crystallization brings an accented reduction of densification for 

viscous flow: for about 10 % of the crystals formed, apparent viscosity increases about 100 times, 

implying an abrupt reduction of the viscous flow with shrinkage stopping that is observed in 

dilatometric curves [2]. If the crystallization stage begins before or during the sintering process, the 

resultant compact will have sufficiently porosity and heterogeneities due to the existence of 

crystalline phase in the glass matrix. In the glass sintering, if the interval between Tg and Tc 

(crystallization temperature) is too small, the glass will not have enough time for completely 

densification before crystallization. In the contraire, if the sintering stage finishes before the 

beginning of crystallization, a denser compact will be gotten with lower porosity [3].  

The particle size is an important factor in the sintering of the glass [3–5]. Compact density increases 

with the biggest and smallest particle size ratio. Cutler and  Henrichsen [6] had verified that glass 

particles with a varied distribution sizes and raised superficial area densified about five times more 

quickly than glasses with an equivalent average particle size but with a much uniform size 

distribution. 

The ability to predict the final shrinkage of a sintering compact along its axes will enable to control 

the shape of the final product. Some equations, based on the Frenkel’s model [7,8], had been 

proposed to describe the linear shrinkage in the initial stage of sintering and have been used in some 

crystalline or amorphous systems, namely in non-isothermal conditions, with constant heating rates. 

However, anisotropic sintering is often observed in porous glass systems and in this case the 

Frenkel´s model fails in the prediction of the overall shrinkage [9–11]. Anisotropic green 

microstructure can be formed during the shaping process as a result of many factors, the most 

frequent being non-equiaxed particle shape, particle alignment and non-uniform packing [11–13] 

which will give rise to anisotropic shrinkage behavior during sintering. Although an increased 

attention and relevant comprehensive studies have being done in anisotropic sintering of different 

systems, more research is yet missing for a full understanding of the factors governing the anisotropic 

densification.

In this work the anisotropic sintering of a Ca-P-Si-Mg glass powder with different particles size 

distributions was investigated. The effects of the particle size distribution on the particle alignment 

during shaping and of the packing characteristics together with the heating rate on the shrinkage 

behavior were investigated. 

IV.2. Material and Methods 

Reagent-grade powders of SiO2, CaCO3, Ca(H2PO4)2 and MgO were mixed in the required 

proportions to obtain a glass with the nominal composition (wt. %) 54.89 % 3CaO.P2O5 ? 24.81 % 

SiO2 ?  20.30 % MgO. The raw materials were wet mixed in ethanol in an agate mill, for 45 min, and 

dried at 60 ºC. Batches of 80 g were melted in a platinum crucible at 1500 ºC, for 2h, in air, and then 

quenched into cold water. After quenching in water, a homogenous, transparent glass was obtained. 

The amorphous state of the glass was confirmed by XRD analysis of powdered samples, in a Rigaku 

Diffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C, Japan, at room temperature with CuK? radiation at a scan speed 

of 0.02º s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2? range of 10?80 degree. 

The glass was crushed in an agate ball mill for different periods of time and sieved to collect a fine 

fraction bellow 20 µm and an average particle size d50 of 3.5 and 6.8 µm using alcohol as solvent. 

The particle size measurements of the powdered glasses were carried out by a laser particle size 

Coulter LS Particle Size Analyser 230, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA.   

DTA analysis of the glass particles was performed in order to assess the temperature range suitable 

for thermal treatments. The analysis was performed in a differential thermal analyzer Labsys Setaram 

TG-DTA/DSC, France, at a heating rate of 10 ºC min-1 from room temperature to 1000 ºC in air, 

using alumina (Al2O3) as a reference.  

The density of the glass was determined as 2.65±0.05 g cm-3 at 25 ºC by helium pycnometry in a 

QuantaChrome equipment and further taken as theoretical density under the assumption that no 

closed porosity was present in the measured particles.  

Rectangular bars (5 x 5 x 10 cm3) with a green density of 1.60 ± 0.01 (corresponding to 0.60 of 

relative density) were obtained by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa, for 30 sec, as represented in Fig. 

IV.1.

The sintering behavior in non-isothermal conditions was investigated at constant heating rate 

dilatometry, using a Bahr Thermo Analyse DIL 801 L, Germany and heating rates from 5 to 20 ºC 

min-1 until a maximum temperature of 850 ºC.  

The density of the compacts at given temperatures during sintering was determined from the green 

density and the measured shrinkage using the relation, given by Eq. IV.1,  

? =
?0

(1??? ?0? )
2 (1??? ?0)?

                (Eq. IV.1) 

The final density of the sintered compacts was also determined by using the Archimedes principle. 

Average values of  x- and y- shrinkage were calculated from 5 samples. With this data, the coefficient 

of shrinkage anisotropy, K, can be defined by the ratio between perpendicular and parallel strains, 

according to Eq. IV.2,  

       ? =

ln(? ?0? )

ln(? ?0? ))
                   (Eq. IV.2) 

In order to characterize the particles orientation, the microstructure of the cross-sections in the y- and 

x- planes was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM in a Hitachi, Model SU-70 equipment 

at an accelerating voltage of 25 KeV. Prior to SEM analysis, the planes of sintered specimen were 

finished with diamante slurry and sputtered with carbon.  

From the original micrographs a binary image was created, with the grains in blank and the pores or 

resin in black, as exemplify in Fig. IV. 2. For the image analysis, the software ImageJ was used by 

defining a threshold value to convert the micrograph into binary pictures (Fig. IV. 2b). The shape of 

the particles was detected automatically and the desired information determined, not taken into 

account the particles located at the edge of the picture. To measure the degree of particle orientation 

and aspect ratio it was used the “best-fit ellipse method”, Fig. IV.2c.

IV.3. Results and Discussion 

The amorphous nature of the as quenched glasses was confirmed by XRD, curve not shown. The 

particle size distributions of the glass powders, after milling and sieving are represented in Fig. IV.3. 

It is possible to observe a particle size distribution varying between ~0.04 up to ~20 ?m with an 

average particle size at 50 vol. % of 3.5 ?m for G3 and a slight wider distribution for G6, with a 

larger fraction of coarser particles extending up to ~33 ?m and an average size of 6.8 ?m. 

 

 

The thermal behaviour of the glass powder G3 was characterized by DTA and dilatometry at 10 ºC 

min-1 and the respective curves are shown in Fig. IV.4. The beginning of sintering occurred at ~710 

ºC, after the endothermic occurrence in DTA curve, which corresponds to the glass transition region 

in the range of 708?730 ºC.  

It can be observed two regions of shrinkage in the dilatometric curve: the first one, region I, where 

the densification predominantly occurs (~14 % of shrinkage was attained) with the ending fairly 

close to the onset of the crystallization temperature (Tc), ~825 ºC. The second regimen, region II, 

occurred in competition with the devitrification process, presenting a slow densification process, 

leading to ~2 % of additional shrinkage.

 Shrinkage kinetic analysis  

The shrinkage (y) and shrinkage rate (dy/dt) of the two powder compacts with varying heating rates 

are presented in Fig. IV.5. Shrinkage curves show a sigmoidal characteristic shape with temperature 

and shifted to higher temperatures with increasing heating rate [14,15]. 

The influence of the particle size distribution on the sintering rate was also clearly observed. A 

maximum shrinkage of 8 % was obtained for the coarser powder at 810 ºC (2 ºC min-1), while 11.5 % 

densification was reached for the finer powder, at the same heating rate and temperature. This effect 

is correspondent to a higher shrinkage rate for the finer powder as can be observed in Fig. IV.4b. By 

comparing the maximum of the shrinkage rate at the same heating rate, it is very clear its increase 

with the decreasing of the average particle size, as expected from the sintering kinetic laws [5]. Above 

the maximum shrinkage rate, two processes occur in simultaneous competing between itself, namely 

the viscous flow and the nucleation and growth of crystalline phase. It seems that the higher the 

heating rate is, the higher the onset temperature for the crystallization, as already observed elsewhere 

[16,17].  

Boccaccini et al. [16] fully densified glass particle compacts when heated at ? = 15 °C min–1 to 

1050 °C, however, the same powders densified to only 89 % at ? = 1 ºC min–1, thus confirming that 

high heating rates favored sintering in detriment to crystallization.

Using the data from the dilatometric experiments, it is possible to calculate the apparent activation 

energy and the kinetic exponent, characteristics of the densification mechanism involved in the 

sintering. The equation used, Eq. IV.3, for the calculation of the apparent activation energies and 

sintering exponent was proposed by Venkatu [18], valid for the initial sintering stage y ? 2 %:

only depends on the material and of the sintering mechanism and p it is the sintering exponent, which 

presents the values of p = 1 for viscous flow, p = 2 for volume diffusion and p = 3 for the diffusion 

mechanism by grain contour. The application of this equation is limited to a range of shrinkage (y ?

ln ?, for constant values of temperature, where the slope is equal to -1/p. The value gotten of p = 1.3 

and 1.2, for G3 and G6, respectively, are approximately p ? 1, which corresponds to viscous flow. 

Equivalent average value for the viscosity activation energy, Es, of 521±6 kJ mol-1 and 511±24 kJ 

mol-1 were found for glass particle size of 3.5 µm and 6.8 µm respectively.

 Effect of the heating rate and particle size on the final sintered density and 
anisotropy 

The effect of the heating rate, ?, and of the particle size on the final density, attained during sintering 

in the dilatometer up to 850 ºC, is shown in Fig. IV.6. The final density of the compacts was not 

significantly affected at the heating rates of 5 and 10 ºC min-1, but at high heating rates, ? &gt;10 ºC 

min-1, the density tends to decrease with increasing the heating rate, due to the reported shift of the 

shrinkage curves to higher temperatures, Fig. IV.5. For lower heating rates the shrinkage stops earlier 

do to the onset of crystallization. A densification of 97 % and 89 % was obtained for G3 and G6, 

respectively, for the compacts sintered at 10 ºC min-1.

Shrinkage anisotropy can be quantified by the shrinkage anisotropy factor (k). Equation IV.2 

describes a form to calculate the coefficient of anisotropy [11]. 

A value equal to 1 or near indicates isotropy. The more moved away from the coefficient value of 1, 

the biggest anisotropy will be.  

As indicated by the K values, in Fig. IV.7, the shrinkage anisotropy increases with the heating rate, 

?, for both compacts and is higher for the coarser powder compacts, G6.   

  

 

The variation of the shrinkage anisotropy factor (k) with the temperature performed at 10 ºC min-1 in 

the dilatometer is presented in Fig. IV.8, together with free sintered samples, without the dilatometric 

load. It was observed that x- shrinkage was always higher than the y- shrinkage.  

In the dilatometer samples the k values for G3 compacts are lower than that for G6, and the shrinkage 

anisotropy factor decreases to a value near 1, i.e., the sintering becomes 'more isotropic' in nature, 

and therefore, the creep strain, according to Eq. IV.2, decreases. The shrinkage anisotropy factor 

decreases continuously during sintering and reaches a value close to 2.5 and 1.2 at 850 ºC for G6D 

and G3D respectively. In the early stages of sintering, the relative x-axes shrinkage was higher as 

much as three and two times that of y-axes shrinkage, for G6D and G3D respectively.   

It is possible that with the sintering process, the neck length grows in the direction of the longer axis 

at a faster rate, resulting in the reduction of shrinkage in this direction and consequently of the 

anisotropy.  

The shrinkage of the free sintered samples is nearly isotropic for G3, however, anisotropic shrinkage 

for G6 samples is observed (k~1.5). Without the applied load of the dilatometer, free sintering, the 

anisotropy factor k is smaller and  seems to remain nearly constant throughout sintering, in agreement 

with the literature on glass compacts [13].

These results are consistent with the literature result, elongated particles or pores lead to anisotropic 

shrinkage and the shrinkage is larger in the direction perpendicular to the shaping pressure. 

Anisotropic shrinkage is believed to come from green particle preferential orientation. The conditions 

for such can be found in uniaxial pressed compacts of irregular particles, which is here the case. If 

particles are oriented in the x- direction, the initial shrinkage rate will be higher in this direction 

because of the higher necks per unit length. However, as sintering progresses, the neck length grows 

at a faster rate. This results in the reduction of shrinkage in this direction and consequent reduction 

of shrinkage anisotropy as sintering progresses, because the rate of particle coalescence is a strong 

function of neck length. This can explain the reduction of shrinkage anisotropy in the final sintering 

stages, though the microstructure still has some anisotropy. 

Considering that when applying a mechanical load, the degree of shrinkage anisotropy mentioned 

above was seen to increase, the main differences between G3 and G6 powder sintering may come 

from the particle size distribution, since other factors affecting shrinkage anisotropy, as pressing 

pressure, packing density, dilatometer stress and sintering cycles, are equivalent. It seems probable 

that finer particles can be packed with less preferential orientation, as shown for G3F and G6F 

samples.  

When in presence of dilatometric load, Boccaccini and Olevsky [9], show that if the effective stress 

due to the dilatometer load is kept below 5 KPa, the shrinkage anisotropic factor will be nearly 

constant with the progress of sintering, confirming the free shrinkage results. 

Anisotropy in densification occurs normally in uniaxial pressed samples, where a higher shrinkage 

in the radial direction (for cylindrical samples) is observed as in the case of cordierite type glass

powder [19] and on non-spherical [20] and spherical [21] borosilicate powder glass, although, on 

soda-lime glass [22] it was observed a higher contraction in the axial direction.  

 Micrographs analysis of the anisotropy 

To verify this matter and its relation to the compact densification, micrographs obtained from the 

compact impregnated with resin are present on Fig. IV.9. The x-plane (perpendicular the pressing 

direction) and y-plane (parallel to the pressing direction) were examined.  

The particles, in the x- direction, in both systems, have their longer axes oriented, especially for the 

larger particle size system, as is revealed in the micrographs, Fig. IV.10. The shorter axes were 

observed in the y- direction.  

Micrographs in Fig. IV. 10 revealed that the particles are of irregular shape and not equiaxed. When 

assimilated to two-dimensional (2D) ellipses, as present in Fig. IV.2, their median aspect ratio 

(defined as the major axis divided by the minor axis) was, for green samples, 1.63 and 1.67 for y- 

and 1.91 and 2.40 on x- direction, for G3 and G6 series respectively, table IV.1. This feature is 

important, as this intrinsic particle anisometry can lead to microstructural anisotropy in the sintered 

body if particles are aligned during the manufacturing process, which lead to the anisotropic 

shrinkage, evidenced by G6 experimental data in Fig. IV.10.  

In the G3 particle distribution, with more isometric particles, no specific orientation was observed, 

the green glass powder was more uniform, leading finally, to a lower shrinkage anisotropy.  

It can also be seen that the degree of particle orientation increased with temperature for both G3 and 

G6, probably due to the dilatometric process load, in the y- direction, that led to a significant increase 

of the necks per unit length in this direction and consequent coalescence of particles.

The densification using ImageJ was successfully correlated with the relative density of the samples 

using Eq, IV.1, confirming the suitability of the evaluated images as well as the reliability of the 

image analysis method used. Such output data can also be used to analyse particles or pore size, 

shape packing, and orientation within the sample. These results are summarised in Table IV.2. 

Around 900 particles in 3 micrographs were considered for every sample.

In order to analyse the effect of particle size and the development of anisotropy during densification, 

we introduce the following particle orientation factor, which is defined as the fraction of weighted 

cumulative length (sum of the length multiplied by the aspect ratio) of particles with orientation in 

the ranges 0 - 45 ° and 135 - 180 º. If the particles are aligned in the x-axes direction the angle is 0º 

or 180º, an angle of 90º corresponds to the z- direction. In a randomly oriented isotropic material, a 

value of 0.5 would be expected [13].  

In order to examine the correlation between particle alignment and shrinkage, the orientation of the 

particles with temperature was determined, Fig. IV.10. For both particle sizes distributions more than 

50 % of the particles are oriented in the x- direction. That indicates that a preferred orientation exists. 

In the x-plane, G3 particles were more or less randomly distributed at the beginning but at the end 

they seem to be more aligned along the x-axis, which is the perpendicular to the load direction. In 

the G6 system, particles are mainly oriented along the x-axis. This result shows an important 

anisotropy in this plane, certainly induced by the manufacturing process. Fig. IV.10. A preferential 

orientation is induced, in lower degree in G3 system, leading to anisotropic viscous properties that 

should also affect the particle morphology during sintering. 

 

 

For the early stages of sintering, the shape of the particles and their nonhomogeneous spatial 

arrangement in the compact are the major variables affecting the shrinkage behaviour in the green 

body, as a result of the uniaxial pressure used, as seen in Fig. IV.1. The difference in the number of 

nearest-neighbour contact points along the x- versus y- planes, especially for G6, with a preferred 

spatial distribution, increases the area and number of particle’s contacts site, consequently inducing 

an increase in shrinkage anisotropy.

The results clearly demonstrates the influence of the particle size distribution and, in addition, of the 

powder preparation and sintering on the degree of particle orientation and consequent densification 

of the final samples. The results suggested that changing the microstructure of the green body, by 

varying the morphology and size of the starting powders used, should lead to a change in the degree 

of shrinkage anisotropy, thus transforming the shrinkage behaviour from anisotropic to isotropic. 

IV.4.  Conclusion 

The sintering behavior for 3CaO.P2O5-MgO-SiO2 system glass was investigated. The glass powder 

compacts can be densified at the sintering temperature below 800 ºC through viscous sintering, 

without the present of crystalline phases. Significant effect of the heating rate is observed on the 

relative rates of densification and crystallization. Increasing the heating rate leads to higher 
anisotropic shrinkage, for the same temperature, before the optimum temperature of sintering. Near 
full densification before crystallization was reached by a small decrease of the glass particle size 

from 6.8 ?m to 3.5 ?m. Comparing the effect of particle size in the particle orientation, a distinctive 

interrelation can be found between the degree of orientation and particle shape. Coarser powders 

compacts exhibited a higher degree of particle orientation, perpendicular to the shaping force 

direction, as those from finer powders.

CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS OF A SI-CA-P-MG BIOACTIVE 

GLASS BY NON-ISOTHERMAL METHODS 

 

Abstract 

In this work the crystallization process of a 3CaO.P2O5 – SiO2 – MgO glass was studied by non-

isothermal measurements using differential thermal analysis carried out at various heating rates.  X-

ray diffraction at room and high temperature was used to identify and follow the evolution of 

crystalline phases with temperature. The activation energy associated with glass transition, Eg, the 

activation energy for the crystallization of the primary crystalline phase (Ec) and the Avrami 

exponent (n), were determined under non-isothermal conditions using different equations, namely 

from Kissinger, Matusita &amp;amp; Sakka and Osawa.  

A complex crystallization process was observed with associated activation energies reflecting the 

change of behaviour during in-situ crystal precipitation. It was found that the crystallization process 

was affected by the fraction of crystallization (x), giving rise to decreasing activation energy values, 

Ec(x), with the increase of x. Values ranging from about 580 kJ mol-1 for the lower crystallized 

volume fraction to about 480 kJ mol-1 for volume fractions higher than 80 % were found. The Avrami 

exponents, calculated for the crystallization process at a constant heating rate of 10 ºC min-1, 

increased with the crystallized fraction, from 1.6 to 2, indicating that the number of nucleant sites is 

temperature dependent and that crystals grow as near needle-like structures.

V.1. Introduction 

The biocompatibility of many calcium-phosphate glasses and their controllable solubility in 

physiological fluids make them attractive candidates for biomedical applications [1–3].  A sensible 

way to control degradation of glasses is to promote the in-situ crystallization of adequate crystalline 

phases towards the production of a glass ceramic. The nature and relative amounts of crystalline 

phases and remaining glassy matrix determine the type of dissolution products and influence the 

response of these glasses when facing biological systems [4]. Crystallization of glasses depends on 

composition [5–14] but it is mostly affected by the time-temperature programs used in the 

development of the in-situ crystalline phases. Understanding the crystallization kinetics of bioactive 

glasses is thus of major importance because it will allow the optimization of the processing 

parameters and the tailoring of the microstructure that will provide the properties required for each 

specific application.  A number of glasses from the SiO2 ? 3CaO.P2O5 ? MgO system has been studied 

by our group  [15–17] with confirmed biocompatibility and in vitro bioactivity [16,17]. In some 

compositions the surface reactivity in a synthetic physiological fluid associated with the precipitation 

of an apatite-like layer becomes dramatically depressed when crystallizing the glass [18] and this 

may lead to distinct interfacial responses when in contact with living structures. The aim of this work 

is to study the crystallization process of the bioactive glass composition 25Si ? 33Ca ? 11P ? 31Mg 

(mol. %) by determining relevant parameters, such as activation energy and Avrami exponent, 

through a non-isothermal method – differential thermal analysis (DTA). Kissinger [19], Matusita et 

al. [20], and Ozawa [21] equations were used to calculate the kinetic parameters and to examine its 

dependence on the fraction of crystallization [22]. The apparent activation energy associated with 

glass transition was also assessed from Kissinger and Ozawa methods [19,23,24].  

V.2. Materials and Methods 

A glass of molar composition 25Si ? 33Ca ? 11P ? 31Mg was produced by the conventional melt 

quenching technique. A calcium to phosphorus molar ratio of 3:1, close to the equivalent ratio in the 

natural bone was used. The raw materials consisting of SiO2 (99.9 %, Fluka), CaCO3 (99.9 %, Fluka), 

Ca(H2PO4)2 (85 %, Fluka)  and MgO (99.9 %, Fluka); were ball-milled in an agate mill jar and melted 

in a platinum crucible at 1500 ºC, for 2 h in air, and poured into water to obtain a frit. The frit was 

dried, ball milled, and sieved to produce particle sizes ? 20 ?m. Viscosity measurements were carried 

out in a beam bending viscometer Bahr Thermo analyse VIS 401) using 5 x 5 x 40 mm3 samples and 

a heating rate of 10 ºC min-1. For the crystallization kinetics studies and glass transition analysis,

differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed in a L81Thermobalance-Linseis thermoanalyser, 

using 25 mg powdered samples with Al2O3 powder as reference material and employing heating rates 

of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 °C min–1 in open atmosphere. The instrument was calibrated for the 

temperature range of 30?1300 °C, using a sample of ?-A12O3 powder alone.  

  The crystalline phases, developed after 2 hours stages at the temperature peaks revealed by DTA, 

were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Rigaku “Geigerflex” D/Max- Series C 

diffractometer with CuK? radiation. The microstructure of the crystallized samples was observed by 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in a Hitachi, Model SU-70 equipment at an accelerating 

voltage of 25 KeV using fracture surfaces under HCl acid attack for 3 seconds, carbon coated before 

observation.  

The formation of the crystalline phases within the glass was followed by high temperature X-ray 

diffraction (HT-XRD) using a Philips X'Pert diffractometer, model MRD and also Cu-Ka radiation. 

Data were collected in a continuous scan type from 10º to 70º, with a step size of 0.02º and a counting 

time of 1 s per step. The in-situ analysis was performed on glass powders while being heated in air, 

each 10 ºC from 770 to 900 ºC, using a heating rate of 10 ºC min-1 and a dwell time of 45 min per 

scan.

DTA traces obtained at different heating rates from 2 to 40 ºC min-1 are represented in Fig. V.2. All 

curves exhibit an endothermic peak associated to a glass transition (not always obvious in the graphs 

but found with software help from the slope changing in the region 700 ? 730 ºC) followed by two 

distinct exothermic crystallization peaks at higher temperatures strongly dependent on the heating 

rate. The relevant results concerning the thermal behavior of the glass are depicted in Table V.1. It 

is observed that the glass transition temperature increases with the increase in the heating rate, and  

the crystallization peak temperatures are also shifted towards higher values at faster heating rates 

[25]. It should be emphasized here that, although commonly designated by glass transition 

temperature or Tg, the heating rate dependent temperatures corresponding to the endothermic events 

in the DTA traces rather refer to fictive temperatures. Tg is defined on the basis of viscosity, i.e., Tg 

equals the temperature where viscosity is 1012 Pa.s, independently of the heating rate. To measure 

Tg from DSC or DTA, the respect of ASTM Standards is required, i.e., the heating rate of 10 ºC min-

1. This kind of analysis of the fictive temperature dependence on the heating rate, based on DTA 

traces, is commonly presented in the literature  [26,27] because it can provide valuable insights into 

the understanding of structural relaxation phenomena near the glass transition temperature. In this 

study we will also adopt the designation Tg for the fictive temperatures associated with the different 

heating rates.

In order to identify the crystalline phases associated with the exothermic DTA peaks, powder 

compact samples were heated at 5 ºC min-1 until 800, 820 and 920 ºC and kept at those temperatures 

for 2 hours for subsequent XRD analysis at room temperature.  The results revealed that no detectable 

crystallization was achieved before 800 ºC as suggested by the DTA traces and the crystalline phase 

associated to the first peak corresponds to whitlockite, CaMg(PO4)2. The second peak is related to 

the formation of both forsterite and enstatite as minor Mg-silicate phases as shown in Fig. V.3 and 

Table V.2. The same crystalline phases were found when the powder compact samples were heat 

treated at 40 ºC min-1 until 885 and 965 ºC and kept at those temperatures for 2 hours, as shown in 

the XRD pattern, Fig. V.3b.

The cross sectional SEM micrographs represented in Fig. V.4 show the crystallization of a needle-

like phase after heating up to 840 ºC (Fig. V.4a), probably corresponding to the whitlockite-type 

phosphate, together with a distinct phase, of polyhedral shape, detected after heat treating the glass 

at 1000 ºC (Fig. V.4.b), attributed to a magnesium silicate phase. A semi-quantitative elemental 

analyse by EDS in SEM was performed on the whitlockite and forsterite crystals. The determination 

of elements in the second phase was more difficult because of the surrounding signal of the primary 

phase, whitlockite. The two EDS traces are presented below the SEM images in Fig. V. 4, confirming 

the Ca/P ratio near 1.4 of whitlockite phase and Si/Mg ratio near 2 of the forsterite phase.

powder compact at 10 ºC min-1 up to a) 840 ºC, 2h and b) 1000 ºC, 2h. (Fracture surfaces

Crystallization was also followed by performing HT-XRD at the heating rate of 10 ºC min-1. As 

shown in Fig. V.5, crystallization was detected earlier at 760 ºC being the primary crystalline phase 

the calcium phosphate phase, whitlockite. Forsterite started to precipitate at 900 ºC being more 

evident at 1000 ºC, associated with the presence of three peaks at 25.4º, 59.0º, and 66.9º. Comparing 

with the data from the XRD analysis at room temperature, it is shown that both techniques indicate 

the formation of the same crystalline phases, although at different temperatures. This discrepancy is 

a consequence of the different thermal cycles used in each analysis and different types of samples 

(loose powder for the HT-XRD analysis and broken samples previously heated at specific 

temperatures in the other case).

V.3.1. Glass transition kinetics   

The study of the glass transition kinetics may be carried out through the analysis of activation energy 

values for thermal relaxation obtained from the variation of fictive temperatures (here generally 

designated by Tg)  with the heating rate, ?, using the Kissinger equation and the Moynihan model 

[24].  

According to Kissinger equation, Eq. V.1, the apparent activation energy associated with the glass 

transition may be deduced from

??(? ??
2? )  versus 1/Tg should be a straight line, from the slope of which Eg can be determined, as 

represented in Fig. V.6. The value obtained for Eg is 1105 kJ mol
-1. 

Another empirical method, suggested by Moynihan et al. [24], to calculate the activation energy for 

the glass transition, Eg, can be expressed according to the Ozawa method [23] by

The difference between Eq.s V.1 and V.2 lies in the first member. Since Tg is ? dependent the straight 

lines given by the plot of ln (?/Tg2) versus 1/Tg (Eq. V.3) or by ln ? against 1/Tg (Eq. V.2) may yield

different slopes thus giving different values for Eg. So, the use of Eq. V.2 requires that before 

submitting the glass to a heating process of rate ?, it must be cooled to well below the glass transition 

region at a rate that should be similar to the heating rate. A plot of ln ? against 1/Tg (Fig. V.6) yields 

an approximate straight line with a slope of –Eg/R, corresponding to an activation energy for the 

glass transition of 1128 kJ mol-1.  

 
Fig. V.6. Plot of ln(?.Tg-2) and ln ? versus 1/Tg for the glass, according to the Kissinger 

and the Ozawa methods 

Both methods give very close values for  the activation energy associated with the glass transition, 

indicating that the thermal behaviour of the glass on heating was dependent on the heating rate but 

not significantly affected by the previous thermal history, i.e., by the rate at which the glass was 

cooled below the glass transition region. 

V.3.2. Crystallization kinetics 

DTA results were used to calculate relevant kinetic parameters of the glass-crystallization 

transformations, such as the overall crystallization activation energy (Ec) and the order of the reaction 

or Avrami exponent (n). The analysis was focused on the first exothermic peak. Three different 

equations were used, namely, Kissinger [19], Matusita et al. [28,29] and Ozawa [30]. In all of them, 

it is assumed that the variation of the peak crystallization temperature, Tp, is directly related to the 

heating rate, ?, and that the glass composition does not change as crystallization takes place [14]. 

Although the first criterion seems to be not questionable, the second condition is difficult to fulfill 

since composition of the glassy matrix is changing as crystalline phases form. Despite these 

limitations the proposed analysis is usually accepted because it gives an important contribution for 

the understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in glass systems. From the Kissinger method, the

activation energy for crystallization, Ec, is determined using Eq. V.3 equivalent to Eq. V.1 for the 

glass transition activation energy, Eg

where Tp is the crystallization peak temperature at the maximum of crystallization peak and ? is the 

DTA heating rate. A plot of ln (?/Tp2) vs. 1/Tp should be a straight line, from the slope of which Ec 

can be determined. This equation assumes that the crystal growth occurs on a fixed number of nuclei 

that does not change during heating in the DTA measurements. If the number of nuclei continuously 

varies while heating the samples, the obtained values for Ec may be incorrect. For this case a 

modified Kissinger equation has been proposed by Matusita et al. [29].

where n is the Avrami constant and m is a numerical factor related with the dimensionality of the 

crystal growth. The values of n and m for various crystallization mechanisms are shown in Table 

V.2. The value m = 1 is considered for one-dimensional growth of crystals or for surface 

crystallization and m = 3 for three-dimensional growth when the crystallization is predominantly 

bulk. When the number of nuclei is constant during DTA runs at different heating rates, m = n but 

when nucleation occurs during DTA, m = n - 1, being the number of nuclei in the glass inversely 

proportional to ?. In addition, m = n = 1 for the particular case of surface crystallization.

where x is the fraction of crystallized glass, as given by the partial area of the crystallization peak, 

obtained at a fixed temperature from the DTA plot for the heating rate ?. For the various heating rates 

(2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 ºC min-1) typical sigmoidal curves are obtained (Fig. V. 7a) for the fraction 

of crystallization, x, versus temperature. At high temperatures, or in cases where crystallization 

fractions are large, a nonlinear behaviour is seen for all heating rates. This nonlinear character can 

be attributed to the saturation of nucleation sites in the final stages of crystallization [32,33]. 

According to Eq. V.5, the plot of ln[-ln(1-x)] versus 1/T for each heating rate should be a straight 

line [32] of slope (n-1)Ec/R. In Fig. V.7, the obtained trends are non-linear independently of the 

heating rates. This suggests that i) the crystallization mechanism changes with the heating rate (with 

the number of nuclei most probably varying during heating) and ii) during each DTA run performed 

at a given heating rate, the crystal growth mechanism depends on the volume fraction of crystallized 

glass (related with temperature as depicted in Fig. V.7 a. Under a practical point of view, this means 

that the activation energy, Ec, and the Avrami parameter, n, should vary during the non-isothermal 

crystallization process of the glass which is further investigated in this work.

V.3.3. Local activation energy 

In the present case, as in few other glass systems, the activation energy for crystallization was seen 

to be dependent on the fraction of crystallization [34,35]. The value of the activation energy should 

thus reflect the variation of the crystal nucleation and growth mechanism with the volume fraction 

of crystallized glass. For these cases, the activation energy associated to a crystallization fraction x,

Ec(x), is referred as a local activation energy [36] and it can be obtained from the method introduced 

by Ozawa [23], which is based on Eq. V.2, now written as:

where Tx is the temperature corresponding to a fixed value of the crystallized fraction, x, at a given 

?. Using the data in Fig. V. 7 b, at a fixed value of the crystallized fraction, x, the value of Ec(x), can 

be deduced from the slope of ln (?) plotted against 1/Tx .This process can be repeated for various 

degrees of conversion, allowing to obtaining the Ec(x) values as a function of x. If the crystallization 

energy Ec(x) is not significantly different for various crystallized fractions x, the existence of a single-

step reaction can be concluded. In contrast, different values of Ec(x) with x may indicate a complex 

non-isothermal crystallization process  [34].  

Fig. V. 8 represents the Ec(x) versus x dependence, showing that the crystallization fraction has a 

significant influence on Ec(x), decreasing as x increases. At the initial stages of crystallization of the 

glass, for example x = 0.1 Ec is 581 ± 10 kJ mol-1 and in the range of x = 0.2?0.7, Ec(x) decreases 

rapidly to about 495 ± 13 kJ mol-1. Beyond this point, the decrease of Ec(x) is rather slow, reaching a 

quasi-constant value of 482 ± 14 kJ mol-1 for crystallization fractions higher than 0.8.  

 
Fig. V.8. Dependence of Ec(x) on the crystallization fraction 

The apparent activation energy values found in this work are in fact close to those obtained for other 

bioactive glasses [37, 38] from systems similar to the one studied in this work. A value of 447 kJ 

mol-1 was found by Yu et al. [39] for the crystallization activation energy in a 32CaO?18P2O5?

35SiO2?10MgO?5Al2O3 (wt. %) glass composition. For a AW glass-ceramic composition the

95 

 

activation energy of apatite crystallization has been reported as 514 ± 57 and 482 ± 36 kJ mol-1, for 

coarse and fine particles respectively [38]. In the commercial bioactive glass, 45S5, the 

crystallization of Na2CaSi2O6, in fine or in coarse powder, was associated with activation energy 

values of 338 to 230 kJ mol-1, respectively [37]. Although in most literature, activation energy for 

crystallization is usually compared to activation energy for viscous flow, E?, there is no consensus 

in this matter [40,41]. As discussed by Fokin et al [42] the similarity between both values is just an 

indication that the thermal processes involved are associated with analogous molecular motions, even 

when considered in different temperature ranges. In fact, this was observed in some glass systems 

and compositions such as SiO2?Li2O [29]  but for the 45S5 bioactive glass such similarity was not 

found [43,44]. 

 For the present glass composition the dependence of viscosity from temperature in the range 710 ?

750 ºC is described in Fig. V.10 by the Arrhenian dependence

From the experimental viscosity data the glass transition temperature (corresponding to the viscosity 

of 1012 Pa s) is 710 ºC, which agrees with Tg value obtained from DTA trace as shown in Table V. 

1.  

Within that temperature range (710 ? 750 ºC) the value obtained for E? is around 1700 kJ mol-1 .This 

value is  much  higher than the apparent activations energies determined before for other temperature

intervals, emphasizing the idea that temperature and thus viscosity should be accounted for to 

understand molecular diffusion processes in glass systems [42], as discussed in the following 

paragraphs.  

The viscosity data in Fig. 9 can be used for further calculations aiming to interpret the observed 

crystallization mechanism. The temperature dependence of ? may be described by fitting the Vogel 

Fulcher Tammann  (VFT) equation [45],  

log ?=A+B/(T-T0)                                        (Eq. V.8) 

where A, B and T0 are constants that depend on the glass composition, and T is the temperature in 

degrees centigrade. Fitting the experimental data by the least squares method one obtains the values 

A = -11.85, B = 5902.29 and T0 = 463.31 in the viscosity range between 10
9 and 1012.  

Figure 10 represents a tentative viscosity?temperature curve based on the VFT equation, Eq. V.8, 

described for the fitting parameters found. Together with the depicted experimental viscosity data, it 

is emphasized the region corresponding to the crystallization events, i.e., from 825 to 898 ºC as 

indicated in Table V.1, for the heating rate of 10 ºC min-1.

crystallization takes place 

A key question is to know which structural units control crystallization and viscous flow. Being both 

phenomena controlled by diffusion it should be relevant to have a clear indication on 1) the size and 

nature of the diffusing building species and 2) the diffusion coefficients of those species in the glass-

forming liquid [41].  In a Si?Ca?P?Mg glass, any of the cations and the anion O2- may behave as 

migrating species. Diameters of all these species are well documented, but diffusion data are scarcely

97 

 

found in the literature. In the particular case of Ca2+ and Mg2+, it is generally accepted that these ions 

diffuse faster than Si4+ and O2-, but this conclusion is inferred by analogy among silicate glasses. In 

our study, the activation energy for viscous flow E? in the range 109?1012 Pa.s (i.e., 710 ? 750 ºC) is 

1700 kJ mol-1 and the apparent activation energy for crystallizations lies in the range 480 ? 580 kJ 

mol-1 depending on the crystallized volume fraction. This difference indicates that it is likely that the 

migrating species at the temperatures at which the viscosity data was collected are not the same that 

diffuse in the range of temperatures at which crystallization takes place. In fact, larger structural units 

such as (SiO4)4 – tetrahedral in different bridging coordination may control viscous flow, and their 

higher diameter could explain the higher viscosity data measured. Information on the ionic bond 

strenghts of cation-oxygen pairs in the glass structure may as well give an additional contribution for 

the understanding of the crystall precipitation within the Si ?Ca?P?Mg system [6]. Based on the ionic 

bond strenghts of P ? O and Si ? O which are 465 ? 368 and 443 kJ mol-1 respectively [31,44,46,47], 

the apparent activation energy values obtained in this work suggest that during crystallization a 

significant amount of the P ? O and Si ? O bonds are being restored towards the formation of 

whitlockite, CaMg(PO4)2, forsterite, Mg2SiO4 and Enstatite, MgSiO3.  

V.3.4. Avrami exponent

fraction of crystallization, x, is represented, being clear that it increases from 1.6 ± 0.1 for low x to 

2.0 ± 0.1 for high x. The results indicate that as crystallization proceeds, and thus the crystallized 

fraction increases, the Avrami exponent increased, corresponding to a crystallization with one-

dimensional growth associated to a bulk nucleation with varying number of nuclei, as suggested by 

the values depicted in Table V.3.  In fact, observation of SEM micrographs in Fig. V. 4 suggests that 

crystals of the primary precipitated phase, whitlockite, appear as long needles in agreement with a 

preferential one-dimensional growth.

The crystallization of a 3CaO.P2O5?MgO?SiO2 glass was followed by DTA performed at various 

heating rates. Whitlockite, forsterite and enstatite were the crystalline phases forming on heat treating 

the glass. The crystallization of the Si?Ca?P?Mg glass starts with the whitlockite phase, and this 

process was found to be dependent on the amount of the crystallized fraction. The local activation 

energy values showed to decrease with the increase of the crystallized fraction, from 580 kJ mol-1, 

for low volume fractions, to about 480 kJ mol-1 for volume fractions higher than 80 %. The Avrami 

parameter increased with increasing crystallized fraction, from 1.6 to 2, indicating that crystallization 

is mostly in volume and occurs with one-dimensional growth, as confirmed by SEM, from a number 

of nucleant sites that probably varies during the thermal treatment.

INCREASED SURFACE AREA DURING SINTERING OF CALCIUM 

PHOSPHATE GLASS AND SODIUM CHLORIDE MIXTURES 

 

Abstract 

Glass scaffolds were obtained by the salt sintering method, using mixtures of calcium phosphate 

glass, 25.42 % SiO2 – 10.89 % P2O5 – 32.68 % CaO – 31 % MgO (mol. %), and salt, NaCl, pressed 

and sintered bellow the salt melting point, followed by leaching of the salt in water. The sintering 

behaviour of glass/salt powder mixtures was followed by dilatometry, BET and SEM. It was found 

that the specific surface area (SSA) of supports sintered between 700 – 750 ºC and leached, can be 

15 – 50 times higher than that of the glass precursor powder, a very surprising behaviour because it 

presents the opposite tendency of a typical sintering process. Dilatometric curves showed an 

unusual expansion from ?450 ºC until ?700 ºC, followed by shrinkage at higher temperatures. 

This expansion accompanies the observed increase of SSA and the microstructures showed a clear 

effect of reaction between the glass and the salt with remarkable wrinkling of the glass particle 

surfaces. This phenomenon was further investigated by using DTA, XRD and FTIR.

VI.1.  Introduction 

The use of scaffolds plays a key role in the process of regeneration in tissue engineering [1,2]. The 

scaffold has to meet certain criteria related to the internal porosity architecture, available surface 

and mechanical properties. For bone related purposes the scaffold material should also have a 

suitable rate of degradation and biocompatibility with the bone to be replaced [1–4]. Materials such 

as metals, polymers, ceramics and composites are commonly used in the manufacture of scaffolds, 

each one with their advantages and disadvantages [3]. The use of phosphate glasses as scaffolds 

can be viable, once they have already been used as bioabsorbable implants. A major advantage is 

their easily adjustable solubility, predictable degradation structure and similar mineral composition 

to bone tissue [5]. Bioactive glasses are very interesting as they possess both osseointegration and 

osteoconductive properties although their intrinsic mechanical weakness may represent a serious 

disadvantage. This critical point can be optimized by microstructural design using the sintering 

variables [6,7].  Despite the large potential of glass or glass-ceramic scaffolds for bone regeneration 

applications, the research in those materials is yet incipient [8–10], limiting their application, in 

contrast with the widespread use of ceramic scaffolds, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) [11–13] and 

related calcium phosphates (CaP) (e.g., ?-tricalcium phosphate) [14–16]. 

Various methods are commonly used for the preparation of scaffolds with suitable porosity for 

applications as tissue engineering templates [17,18], such as foam replica technique [10,12,19–21], 

incorporation of volatile organic particles [22], sol-gel [23], gel-casting techniques [24,25], and salt 

sintering [26], among others. In all the methods to produce 3D structures from glass particles it is 

necessary a sintering step to consolidate the scaffold [8,9,26]. As a result of the relatively high 

temperatures required for sintering [19], the achievement of porous supports with adequate 

mechanical resistance and keeping the former glass structure is a challenging task. More and 

deeper research on the processing understanding and control is clearly missing. 

Among the several available methods, the salt sintering process appears as very attractive due to its 

versatility and simplicity. The method consists of mixing glass particles with a certain proportion 

of soluble salt particles which serves as porogen, such as NaCl, MgSO4 and K2SO4 [27,28]. This 

mixture is then compressed and sintered. After sintering, the salt particles are dissolved in water, 

leaving interconnected pores in the structure. This technique, initially used in the manufacture of 

glass membranes for microfiltration, to remove contaminants from agro-industry, showed the 

ability to be further applied in the production of materials for various areas of biotechnology and 

medicine. Depending on the ratio glass/salt and particle size distribution, the salt sintering 

technique allows the preparation of porous materials with large amount of interconnected 

macroporosity, up to 75 vol. % [27,28]. The selected salt must have a suitable particle size, a

melting temperature higher than the temperature needed for the scaffold consolidation and a high 

solubility in a solvent in which the glass is insoluble. The pore size distribution will be dependent 

on the size distribution of the salt particles. In this work, the sintering of calcium phosphate glass 

and sodium chloride powder mixtures to obtain porous glass scaffolds was investigated by 

following the salt sintering method. 

VI.2.  Material and methods 

A 32.68 % CaO ? 10.89 % P2O5 ? 25.43 % SiO2 ? 31 % MgO (mol. %) glass was produced via the 

conventional melt quenching technique. The raw materials were ball-milled in agate mill jars and 

melted in a platinum crucible at 1500 ºC, for 2 h, in air, and poured into water to obtain a frit. The 

frit was ball milled, and sieved to produce a glass powder with particle size below 20 µm. Sodium 

chloride was used as porogen, supplied by BDH, Middle East LLC, with a purity of 99 %. 

The evaluation of the particle size distribution of the glass was made by laser diffraction in a 

Coulter LS 230 Particle Size Analyser, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA. The specific 

surface areas of the glass powder and salt were determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, 

using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb 

equipment, Germany, was used, and before determining the volume of adsorbed gas, powders were 

kept under vacuum at 200 °C, for 4 h. The real density of the glass powder was evaluated by a 

helium pycnometer model Accupyc 1330-Micrometrics.USA. 

The microstructures of the glass and salt powders were characterized by scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM), in Hitachi, Model SU-70, Germany. For the observation of glass powders, a 

powder suspension (0.1g/10ml 2-propanol) was prepared and deposited on an aluminium sample 

holder. For the observation of powdered sodium chloride, the salt was deposited in a double-

adhesive tape face of carbon. All samples were coated with a carbon thin film by deposition in an 

EMITECH K950 device.  

Mixtures of glass and salt in varied proportions, from 10 up to 90 wt. % NaCl, were prepared by 

mechanical mixing, during 15 min, in a turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. The mixtures 

were designated in accordance to the amount of salt, as presented in Table V.1. The theoretical 

density of the glass: salt mixtures was calculated by the mixture rule, taking into account the 

determined real density of the glass powder, and the sodium chloride density indicated by the 

supplier. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glass, salt and mixtures were performed in a 

Labsys Setaram TG-DTA, France, using 25 mg powdered samples, Al2O3 powder as a reference 

material, and a heating rate of 5 ºC min?1, from 25 to 900 ºC. Cylindrical green bodies (10 mm 

diameter and 10 mm thick) of the glass/salt mixtures were shaped by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa,

for 30 sec. The green density for the GS50 compacts was geometrically determined to be 1.64 g

The sintering behaviour of the compacts was investigated by dilatometry, using a Bahr 

DIL801L dilatometer, Hüllhorst, Germany, at a constant heating rate of 5 ºC min-1, until a 

maximum temperature of 800 ºC, in air. The sintered samples were leached in a water bath, at 30 

°C, for 3 days, to remove the salt fraction and produce a structure with interconnected pores. The 

microstructure of the obtained scaffolds was observed by SEM and the specific surface area was 

determined by BET with the above refereed equipment.  

The apparent density of scaffolds with high enough consolidation to maintain the structural 

integrity after immersion in water was calculated by the geometric measurement of the apparent 

volume. The correspondent porosity was calculated considering the measured value of 2.65 g cm?3 

for the glass real density. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were 

collected using a Bruker IFS 28 EQuinox spectrometer, Germany, in transmittance mode in the 

mid-IR region (4000 – 650 cm?1). Room temperature XRD analysis (Rigaku D/Max-B, Cu K?, 

Japan) was also conducted to investigate the possible crystallinity of the fabricated glass powder 

and scaffolds.

VI.3. Results and Discussion 

VI.3.1. Characterization of the glass and salt powders 

The glass powders, after crushing and sieving, Fig. VI.1a, are predominantly composed of 

angular particles with irregular shape. The glass particles have a wide size distribution, ranging 

from ~0.04 to 20 µm and average particle size, D50 = 6.8 µm, as determined by laser diffraction. A 

value of 0.8 m2.g-1 was found for the specific surface area, Table VI.2.  

 

 

Fig. VI.1. SEM micrographs of the glass (a) and salt particles (b) 

Fig. VI.2 shows the DTA curve for the glass powder obtained at a heating rate of 5 ºC min-1. It can 

be observed in Fig. VI.2a, for the glass powder, an endothermic deflection in the temperature range 

of 706 – 726 ºC, which corresponds to the glass transition region, with an average value at 716 ºC. 

Later, an exothermic phenomena starting near 817 ºC is observed, with two peaks at 837 and 

903 °C in the curve of Fig. VI.2a. These exothermic peaks are associated with the complex 

crystallization phenomena of this glass, occurring in two stages, as reported in another study [29]. 

Those and other characteristics of the glass powder are summarized in Table VI.2.

The SEM micrograph of the salt particles, after sieving, Fig. VI.1b, shows that they have a 

polyhedral shape with dimensions varying between 220 and 500 ?m and are aggregates of smaller 

crystals. Fig. VI.2b presents the DTA curve of the salt with a well-defined endothermic peak near 

800 ºC, corresponding to the salt melting. Other physical characteristics of the salt powders are also 

summarized in Table VI. 2.

VI.3.2. Thermal Behaviour of the Glass and Salt Mixtures 

It can be observed in Fig. VI.2c, that the endothermic deflection, corresponding to the glass 

transition region, shifts to a lower temperature range, 675-705 ºC, average 690 ºC in Table VI.2. 

The onset temperature of crystallization, ~795 ºC occurred also at lower temperatures when 

compared with the glass curve in Fig. VI.2a and the respective temperature in Table VI.2. The 

anticipation of both phenomena, glass transition and crystallization, suggests that the glass structure 

is probably affected by the presence of the salt. 

The hastening of the glass crystallization in the presence of salt was confirmed by the XRD 

spectra of a mixture GS50, after sintering at 5 ºC min-1 up to 760 ºC and 800 ºC and leaching, when 

compared with the XRD of the glass powders submitted to sintering up to 800 ºC, in Fig. VI.3. It 

can be observed that the glass presents an amorphous structure up to 800 ºC, whereas the peaks 

corresponding to the calcium phosphate crystallization, although incipient at 760 ºC become 

defined at 800 ºC in the spectrum of the glass after heated with the salt.

Fig. VI.3. Diffractogram of the glass, G, after heating until 800 ºC and of the mixture 

GS50 after sintering up to 760 and 800 ºC and leaching 

Fig. VI.4 shows the dilatometric curves of glass-salt pressed compacts with different salt 

contents, from 10 until 90 wt. %, heated at 5 °C.min-1 to a maximum temperature of 800 °C. For 

comparison, it is also shown in Fig. VI.4a, the dilatometric curves of a glass compact, G, to a 

maximum temperature of 900 ºC and another of a salt compact, S. It is observed in Fig. VI.4 that 

the addition of salt increases the thermal expansion of the compacts, as expected by the effect of 

the higher thermal expansion coefficient of the salt, when compared with that of the glass: a linear 

thermal expansion coefficient of 8 x 10-6 °C-1 was determined for the glass in the range of 100 ? 

400 °C, whereas a value of 43 x 10-6 ºC-1 ( ~5 times higher) could be calculated for the salt particles 

compact (S) and an intermediate value of 29 x 10-6 °C-1, Table VI.2, was found for GS50 in Fig. 

VI.4. 

In addition, for compacts with salt contents from 30 to 70 wt. % and temperatures in the range of ~ 

450 to 720 °C, the dilatometric curves present a sharp expansion at those temperatures, losing the 

quasi-linear behaviour of the characteristic curves for salt or glass compacts. This expansion is not 

reported in literature and will be further analysed ahead. It is also observed that the total shrinkage 

is progressively decreasing when increasing the level of added salt, suggesting that the salt particles 

act as rigid inclusions hindering the glass viscous flow and, consequently, the densification of the 

compact. The glass compact shrinks up to ~ 850 ºC with a total amount of shrinkage ~ 14.5 %, 

whereas the glass/salt compacts densify until ~ 780 ºC and exhibit much lower shrinkage values: 

for 30 wt. % salt the shrinkage percentage is ~ 4.7 % and above this percentage, from 50 to 70 

wt. % salt, the compacts exhibit even lower shrinkage values of ~ 2 % (the shrinkage values were 

calculated considering the difference between the length of the sample at the maximum expansion

and the length at the maximum shrinkage in the dilatometric curves, normalized for the initial 

length).   

 

 

 

Fig. VI.4. Dilatometric analysis of samples with a) 0, 50 and 100 % salt and b), different 

percentages of salt at a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 

Another interesting observation is that the shrinkage of the glass in Fig. VI.4a  significantly 

decelerates at temperatures of 820 – 830 ºC, a behaviour which, in viscous sintering, is normally 

associated to the sudden decrease of mobility within the glass due to the beginning of the glass 

crystallization [30,31]. With the introduction of salt, shrinkage decelerates earlier, at ~ 790 ºC. This 

behaviour is in accordance with the observed hastening of the onset of crystallization shown in the 

DTA and XRD results, and is associated to reaction effects between the glass and the salt during 



VI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures 

115 

 

the heating stage. Dilatometric analysis is a good tool to detect many thermal reactions upon 

heating [32,33]and the above reported expansion can be related to those reaction effects, as well.  

Further investigation of the expansion phenomena during the sintering of the glass-salt mixtures 

was performed on the GS50 mixture. Table VI.3 shows the linear expansion, ?l/l0, and the 

corresponding specific surface area, SSA, and porosity of the leached porous structures sintered at 

different temperatures and holding times. Values for SSA of known glassy porous structures from 

other works are not greater than 1.6 m2 g?1 after sintering, typically an order of magnitude below 

the values here reported [34]. The obtained values of SSA are significantly increased up to 700 - 

740 ºC, Table VI.3 and Fig. VI.5. Above 740 ºC, the reduction of the specific surface area indicates 

that the effect of sintering in decreasing the surface area overlaps the effect produced by the 

presence of salt during heating. Accordingly, the reduction of SSA is accompanied by shrinkage of 

the sample, Fig. VI.5, and correspondent decrease of porosity, Table VI.3. Despite the limited pore 

removal during sintering of the glass/salt mixtures, well consolidated glass scaffolds can be reached 

by sintering at temperatures in the range 700 – 760 ºC, as shown in Fig. VI.6, with reported 

mechanical resistance compatible with its application in bone tissue engineering [7].

SEM observation of the fracture surfaces of GS50 compacts sintered at 750 ºC, for 10 min, 

after salt leaching, was performed and representative images are shown in Fig. VI.6a-c.  In Fig. 

VI.6a it can be observed, the general microstructure of the scaffold presenting a consolidated 

porous glass structure with large pores up 500 ?m. These large pores were created by the salt 

leaching after sintering. By inspecting the pores surfaces in Fig. VI.6 b and c it can be observed 

that they present high roughness, suggesting again that during the thermal treatment the sodium 

chloride reacted with the glass surface, promoting the wrinkling of the surface with the consequent 

increase of the respective area. For comparison, the microstructure of a glass compact, G, also 

sintered at 750 ºC is presented in Fig. VI.6d and, in this case, a high dense microstructure with 

particles of irregular shape but a smooth surface are observed.

VI.3.3. Glass/salt reaction 

To study the glass/salt reaction, porous structures GS50 were sintered (i) at 450 ºC, where the 

abnormal expansion phenomenon becomes significant in Fig. VI.4, and (ii) after the maximum of 

expansion effects, at 760 ºC. After leaching, all samples were analysed by FTIR.  For comparison, 

it was also analysed the parent glass powder, G, without heat treatment and sintered at 760 ºC, 

respectively. The spectra of all the samples are presented in Fig. VI.7 and Table VI.4 summarizes 

the main bands found in those spectra.  

In the glass without heat-treatment, G, and glass sintered  at 760 ºC, the main absorption band at 

1000 – 1200 cm?1 corresponds to Si ? O ? Si stretching vibration [35,36]. The bands from 940 to 

925 cm-1 are assigned to the Si ? O symmetric stretch (non-bridging oxygen, NBO) with one non- 

bridging oxygen per SiO4 tetrahedron (Q
3 groups) [37–39]. The band, centred at 551 cm-1 can be 

assigned to the presence of bending modes of PO4 amorphous phosphate.  For the glass sintered at 

760 ºC, there’s also the band centred at 603 cm-1, attributed to the presence of PO4 groups. The 

band seen at 1370 cm-1 in G is attributed to (CO3)
2- groups present due to the superficial 

carbonation of calcium in atmospheric CO2. By comparing the two spectra of the glass without and 

with heat-treatment at 760 ºC, it can be concluded that they are similar and at this temperature the

glass is essentially amorphous, in agreement with the DTA results, Fig. VI.2a, where the 

crystallization process was identified to start at ~825 ºC and the XRD results, in Fig. VI.3, showing 

that the glass doesn’t present phase crystallization up to 800 ºC.  

When the glass was sintered in the presence of salt, GS50, at 450 ºC, the bands are essentially the 

same as observed for the glass, G, before and after sintered, although some peaks at 558 and 605 

cm-1 start to form and are attributed to the formation of an amorphous phosphate phase. However, it 

is for the glass sintered in the presence of salt at 760 ºC, that a well differentiated spectrum is 

observed, clearly distinct from the one of the glass, G, and also from that of the GS50 at 450 ºC. 

First of all, all the bands are sharper than in the other spectra, indicating a higher degree of 

structural organization, the beginning of crystallization suggested in Fig. VI.3. Additionally, the 

peaks attributed to the phosphate phase, at 560 and 606 cm-1, are now well defined and a shoulder 

appears at 571 cm-1 which is associated with the asymmetric stretching vibrational mode of 

phosphate groups (P ? O ? P) related to the presence of crystalline phosphates in the glasses, in 

agreement with the expected first crystallization of a phosphate-based at temperatures close to 760 

ºC (DTA and XRD results, Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, Si ? O bands, from 750 – 1100 cm-1 are 

now clearly splitted into sharper bands with peaks in the range 850 – 950 cm-1 corresponded to Si –

O ? 2NBO (non-bridging oxygen) vibrational modes associated with alkali ions in the glass 

network and two well-defined bands at 1050 and 1090 cm?1, attributed to the symmetric stretching 

mode Si ? O- and to the asymmetric stretching mode Si ? O ? Si, respectively, which are indicative 

of disintegration of the glass structure surface in contact with the salt.

These results clearly show that relevant physical and chemical reactions have occurred during the 

thermal processing of the glass/ salt mixture in the regions of contact between the salt particles and 

the glass, as already confirmed by the DTA and XRD, together with the dilatometric curves and 

SEM analysis presented before. 

The calcium phosphate crystalline phase is formed from the glass structure but it is likely that the 

sodium chloride react with the glass surface, inducing the occurrence of surface crystallization. The 

detection by FTIR of organized phosphate ions and the formation of non-bridging oxygen, incipient 

after sintering at 450 ºC but well defined at 760° C, and the earlier glass crystallization in the XRD 

spectrum, together with the effect of expansion in dilatometric curves are strongly indicative of a 

disruption of the glass structure surface in contact with the salt. The chemical composition of the 

glass and porogen used favour the occurrence of a reaction between the glass and the salt, which 

extent will be dependent on the salt fraction in the mixture and other processing variables, namely 

temperature and time of heat treatment. This reaction is responsible for the unusual surface 

modifications of the glass particles that gives rise to the exceptional specific surface area of the 

obtained porous structures. This is a unique feature, since it was obtained during the sintering heat 

treatment, which commonly occurs with reduction of SSA and not with the significant increase of 



VI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures 

 

120 

 

that parameter, as here observed. The increase of the SSA was physically correspondent to an 

unusual wrinkling of the inner walls of the macropores, as observed in Fig. VI.6.  

Based on the reported results, a reaction involving the vitreous network and the alkaline salt 

(alkaline reaction) is proposed which is schematically represented by, Eq. VI.1. 

 

 

           (Eq. VI.1) 

 

 

This reaction will produce the disruption of the glass structure at the particles surfaces and the 

formation of chlorine gas causing the expansion phenomenon observed in the dilatometric curves, 

Fig. VI.4, and the wrinkling of the surfaces. Additionally, these changes in the glass structure 

promote the decrease of the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the anticipation of the 

organization of the amorphous structure towards a crystallized one at lower temperatures.  

This phenomenon of glass-salt reaction is of high technological interest for the production of glass 

and glass-ceramic supports for different applications, namely for bone tissue engineering purposes. 

The exceptional surface area available after sintering provides a higher contact with the 

surrounding physiological fluids and cells, creating the required conditions for a sustainable 

formation of new bone. Increasing the specific surface area and pore volume of bioactive glass 

scaffolds greatly contributes for the acceleration of mineralization  and therefore enhances  its 

bioactive behaviour [42].  Studies in this area are a vast field of research to be explored in the 

future. 

VI.4. Conclusion 

Glass scaffolds were produced by the salt sintering method, using a mixture of calcium phosphate 

glass, 25.42 % SiO2 ? 10.89 % P2O5 ? 32.68 % CaO ? 31 % MgO (mol. %), and NaCl as porogen, 

in proportions varying from 10 up to 90 wt. %. The porous supports were obtained by pressing and 

sintering the mixture bellow the salt melting point, followed by the leaching of the salt particles in 

water.  

The sintering behaviour of the glass: salt mixtures was investigated by dilatometric analysis and 

showed an unusual expansion from ~450 ºC until ~760 ºC in the mixtures of glass and salt, 

followed by shrinkage at higher temperatures where sintering is prevalent. This expansion is 

accompanied by an increase of the scaffolds specific surface area, SSA, during heating up to ~760 

ºC, and it was found that the SSA values for the supports made from mixtures with 50 wt. % of salt,

121 

 

after sintering at temperatures between 700 – 750 ºC and leaching, are 15 – 50 times higher than 

the corresponding to the glass precursor powder, a very surprising behaviour because it presents the 

opposite tendency of a typical sintering process. The microstructural analysis of these supports by 

SEM also showed a remarkable wrinkling of the glass particle surfaces. Additionally, results of 

differential thermal analysis, DTA, of the mixtures and X-ray diffraction, XRD, Fourier-transform 

infrared spectroscopy, FTIR, of supports sintered at different  temperatures showed net alterations 

of the glass structure during heating in the presence of salt, with lowering of the glass transition 

temperature, Tg, and anticipation of the glass crystallization phenomena. Based on the reported 

results, a reaction involving the glass network and the alkaline salt is proposed, in which, a 

structural disruption of the glass surfaces takes place, with formation of chlorine gas that causes the 

expansion phenomenon observed in the dilatometric curves. That reaction would be also 

responsible for the increase of the SSA by the wrinkling of the surfaces and for the creation of 

preferential crystallization sites at the surface. This phenomenon of salt–glass reaction is of high 

technological interest for the production of glass based scaffolds for many purposes including bone 

related biomedical applications where the exceptional surface area available after sintering can 

provide a high contact surface with the surrounding biological system, promoting the sound 

integration of the newly formed bone.

EFFECT OF GLASS COMPOSITION ON THE PROCESSING 

AND PROPERTIES OF CA-P-MG-SI SCAFFOLDS 

 

Abstract 

Glass scaffolds in the system CaO ? P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO ? Na2O, with an open interconnected porosity, 

favourable for bone tissue ingrowth, were produced by a salt sintering process. The effect of Na2O 

additions to 3Ca.P ? Si ? Mg glasses, from which scaffolds were produced, have been investigated 

with regard to sintering behaviour, densification and compressive mechanical properties.  

The introduction of Na2O by substitution of MgO in the glass composition, decreased the glass 

transition (Tg) and the onset of crystallisation (Tc) temperatures of the glass/salt mixtures. The 

addition of sodium has enabled the scaffolds (glass/salt mixture) to be treated at a lower temperature. 

An assessment of their sintering window indicate an improvements in the densification of the glass

VII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds

 Introduction 

The challenge of manufacturing scaffolds from glass particles, is to obtain a good compromise 

between densification, pore size and interconnectivity and mechanical properties [1–4]. It is 

important to be able to adjust and to control the sintering working range of the glass, to ensure easy 

manufacturing. As a bioactive glass scaffold, its increased specific surface area and pore volume may 

greatly accelerate the kinetics of the deposition process of hydroxyapatite and, therefore, enhance the 

bone-forming activity of these glasses [5,6]. There is no agreement as to the ideal specification for 

the pore network of the scaffolds [7,8]. It is widely accepted that the optimal pore size for bone in-

growth within a biomaterial scaffold is 200–400 ?m [9] with a minimum pore diameter of at least 

100 ?m, interconnected, important for allowing migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and 

mesenchyme cells and ultimately tissue formation [10], whereas microporosity (&lt;10 µm pores) 

allows body fluid circulation. 

The salt sintering process method is a common and simple way to produce glass scaffolds [11–13]. 

This method implies a heat treatment that can induce a devitrification of the glass, namely in some 

compositions of the 3CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO system [13]. In the salt sintering process one should 

sinter the salt/glass mixture at a relatively low temperature, bellow salt particles fusion and glass 

crystallisation onset. However, sufficient densification by sintering at low temperatures is difficult 

and therefore very fragile scaffolds are produced [11].  

The addition of alkali metal oxides, can be used to sinter at low temperatures yet getting extensive 

densification of the struts and mechanically competent scaffolds [14–16].  

In this work, we investigate the influence of adding Na2O to the glass composition on the sintering 

behaviour of glass/salt mixtures, thermal properties, microstructures and mechanical properties of 

the scaffolds. The relationships between the sintering temperatures, porosity and mechanical 

behaviour evolution of the glass scaffolds with various Na2O contents are also discussed. 

 Material and methods 

VII.2.1. Glass preparation  

From a base composition 32.68% CaO ? 10.89% P2O5 ? 25.43% SiO2 ? 31% MgO (mol. %) three 

other compositions were investigated with a constant Ca/P molar ratio of 3 and the substitution of 

MgO content by Na2O up to 20 %. This was the highest percentage possible, without phase separation.

These compositions, presented in Table VII.1, were designated hereafter as G31N0, G29N2, G28N3 

or G25N6 where the number after G means the molar % of MgO and the digit after N refers to the 

mol. % of Na2O. The criterion for the choice of these values was the substitution of the initial MgO 

molar percentage, by 5, 10 and 20 % of sodium oxide.

Glasses were obtained by a melt-quenching route. The chemicals used for the preparation of the 

glasses were reagent-grade CaCO3, Na2CO3, SiO2 and Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O. The mixed powders were 

melted for 2 h in a Pt crucible at temperatures in the range of 1550 to 1450 ºC (depending on the 

sodium content in the composition). Glasses were quenched in water to obtain frits. Then the glass 

frits were dried and milled in an agate mill and sieved to obtain a glass powder with a particle size 

smaller than 20 ?m and a mean size of 3.5 µm, as determined by the light scattering technique 

(Coulter LS 230, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA).  

VII.2.2. Glass powder characterization  

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the glass powders was performed using a Rigaku Diffractometer 

Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed 

of 0.02º s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2? range of 10-60 degree to evaluate the 

amorphous nature of the as-prepared glasses (Fig. not shown).  

The true density was measured by helium pycnometry in a model Accupyc 1330-Micrometrics, USA, 

equipment. The specific surface area was determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, using 

the Brunauer, Emmettand Teller (BET) method. For these tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb 

equipment, Germany, was used and powders were previously kept under vacuum, at 200 ºC, for 4 h.   

Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glasses was performed in a Labsys Setaram, France, using 

25 mg powdered samples, at a heating rate of 5 °C min-1, from 25 to 1000 °C, using Al2O3 powder

as a reference material, to obtain the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the onset of crystallization 

temperature, Tc, of the glasses. 

The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the powder compact glasses and mixtures was measured 

by dilatometry in a Bahr Thermo Analyse DIL 801 L, Germany at 5 ºC min-1, using (10 mm diameter 

x 10 mm thick) cylindrical samples. 

VII.2.3. Structural characterization of the glass  powders  

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra were collected using a FTIR, Brucker tensor 27. 

For this purpose, the glass samples were mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using 

a hand press. All spectra were collected over a region of 4000–400 cm?1, with 256 scans and 

resolution of 4 cm?1. 

29Si MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a MSL400P Avance Bruker spectrometer, 9.4 T, wide-

bore, Germany, operating at 79.49 MHz, using 7 mm zirconia rotors at a spinning rate of 5 kHz at 

room temperature, with powdered glass samples. The pulse length was 2 µs and a 60 s delay time 

was used in order to prevent the different relaxation times between glasses. Kaolinite was used as 

the chemical shift reference. 

VII.2.4. Glass scaffold preparation  

Following the salt sintering method, [13,17], the glass powders with a mean particle size of 3.5 ?m 

were mixed with NaCl salt, with particle sizes between 212-500 µm, supplied by BDH, Middle East 

LLC, with a purity of 99 %. Mixtures of glass and salt with 50 wt. % NaCl, were prepared by 

mechanical mixing, during 15 min, in a turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. Cylindrical 

green bodies (10 mm diameter and 10 mm thick) of the glass/salt mixtures were shaped by uniaxial 

pressing with a geometrically initial density of 1.62 ± 0.02 g.cm-3. The thermal expansion coefficient 

(TEC) of the glass-salt mixtures was measured by dilatometry at 5 ºC min-1, using a Bahr DIL801L 

dilatometer, Hüllhorst, Germany. The dilatometry was performed from 25 to 800 ºC, to evaluate the 

effect of glass composition on the shrinkage of the mixtures. The optimal sintering temperature was 

determined from the derivative of the dilatometric curve of the glass/salt compacts, when viscous 

flow sintering dominates and no undesired structural changes, due to crystallization, is detected. 

The samples were heated up to the optimal sintering temperature, at 5º C min-1 and held during 10 

min at these temperatures and then left to cool inside the furnace. The salt was used as a porogen, 

remaining unaltered during the entire sintering process, being easily removed by leaching after the 

heat treatment. Leaching was performed by immersing the salt glass mixture samples during one day 

in water at 30 ºC and 175 rpm. This operation was followed by one day drying in a furnace at 100

ºC, giving rise to a scaffold. These scaffolds, obtained from the mixture of each glass composition 

with the salt porogen, were designated hereafter as GS31N0, GS29N2, GS28N3 or GS25N6 based 

on the names of the respective glasses. These designation is also used for the glass/salt mixtures. 

VII.2.5. Glass scaffolds characterization  

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the crushed scaffolds were performed to confirm the amorphous 

nature of the scaffolds.  

The total porosity was calculated from Eq. VII.1. The apparent density of the scaffolds (? scaffolds) 

was determined from the apparent volume and mass measurements taken on 6 samples and the 

density of the glass. The porosity P was then calculated by 

? = 1 ?
?????????

??????
= 1 ? ?????????                               (Eq. VII. 1) 

Mechanical properties at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 testing machine. 

Six cylindrical scaffolds per composition were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-1. Prior to 

mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth parallel 

surfaces. The elastic modulus from compression tests was determined from the initial linear region 

of the stress–stain curve and the average compressive strength, taken as the highest stress on the 

stress–strain curve, for six samples tested. 

 Results and Discussion 

VII.3.1. Glass / salt sintering behaviour  

Fig. VII.1 shows the linear shrinkage vs. temperature of the 50 wt. % glass/salt mixtures for a heating 

rate of 5 ºC min-1. For the GS25N6, GS28N3, and GS29N2 and GS31N0 the shrinkage starts at 

temperatures ~ 630, 648, 652 and 700 ºC respectively, as shown in Table VII.2, designated as Ts. 

Glass scaffold GS31N0 exhibits the lower densification, while the highest is shown by GS25N6.  

The thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the mixture compacts with 50 wt. % salt, were 

calculated between 100 ? 400 ºC and are summarized in Table VII.2. It is observed that the addition 

of the salt as porogen increases the thermal expansion of the compacts, when compared to the 

dilatometric behaviour of the base glasses alone, as expected by the effect of the higher thermal 

expansion coefficient of the salt, 43 x 10-6 °C-1, near 6 times larger than that of the base glasses, as 

already discussed elsewhere [11]. This effect is higher for the GS31N0 composition and decreases

with the increase of sodium content in the glass composition. This will be discussed, further, in the 

structural section.

The dilatometric results of the mixtures also show that the introduction of sodium into the 

composition of the glasses, also promotes an earlier onset of crystallization, of the glass/salt mixture 

compacts Table II, as expected by the thermal analysis of the base glasses. The introduction of Na2O 

to the composition of the glasses decreased the Tg and the Tc, Fig. VII.3, and increased the TEC of 

the glass compact powders. 

The derivative of the dilatometric curve, Fig. VII.2, of the GS25N6 shows that the shrinkage starts 

near 630 ºC. The shrinkage rate then increases rapidly and steadily up to 712 ºC, and then more 

slowly up to 722 ºC, when it starts to decrease significantly due to the increase of viscosity and 

structural changes due to the onset of crystallization. Dilatometry shrinkage rate results, confirmed 

that the optimum sintering temperature for GS25N6 compacts lies in the interval 712–722 ºC. The 

optimal sintering temperature was chosen at 720 ºC. The same procedure was performed for all 

compositions.

The sintering window, defined as the temperature interval where the viscosity allows sintering 

without undesired structural changes [18], of the mixture compacts increased by the addition of 

sodium to the composition of the glass, Fig. VII.1 and Table VII.2. In the absence of the porogen, 

DTA analyses of the glass powders, Fig. VII. 3 show that the Tg of the glasses, decrease from 706 

to 635 ºC for G31N0 and G25N6 respectively, and the onset of crystallization temperature also 

decreases from 817 to 724 ºC. Consequently, the glass working windows (?T = Tc ? Tg) decrease 

from 111 ºC to 89 ºC for glasses G31N0 and G25N6 respectively, Table VII.2. As shown in literature,

devitrification can be avoided and thus the working window enlarged by decreasing the amount of 

alkali, or by increasing the amount of alkaline earths [15].  

 

Fig.VII. 3. DTA curves of the base composition G31N0 and G25N6, at 5 ºC min-1 

It should be emphasised that the main goal of this work is to increase the sintering window of the 

glass scaffolds. The salt porogen fusion starts near 795 ºC and promotes an earlier crystallization of 

the GS31N0 glass structure, detected at 760 ºC as reported in a previous work [13]. In the presence 

of the salt porogen, the sintering window decrease from 111 ºC, as shown by DTA analysis to ~ 55 

ºC, as confirmed by the dilatometry of the scaffold, Fig. VII.1, the lowest sintering window of all 

mixtures, as resumed in Table VII.2.  

Results showed that the addition of Na2O was beneficial to the densification of the glass/salt mixture 

compacts, due to the decrease of the onset of densification and increase of sintering window, without 

the presence of crystallization. 

VII.3.2. Glass scaffolds characterization  

Cylindrical scaffolds were obtained by the salt sintering process and lixiviation of the salt porogen. 

Sintering of the 50 wt. % salt mixtures was performed near the maximum shrinkage temperature at 

a velocity of 5 ºC min-1. As the densification of the compacts with time occurs especially in the first 

minutes, with a drastic decrease of specific surface area values, as studied before [13], samples were 

held for 10 min at the maximum selected temperature. The sintering conditions are presented in table 

VII.3.  

From Table VII.3 it is observed that with the addition of sodium oxide, to the base glass composition, 

and a reduction of 50 ºC (GS29N2) to 30 ºC (GS28N3 or GS25N6) from the initial sintering treatment,

(750 ºC  for GS31N0), the porosity of the scaffolds decreased from 65.5 % for GS31N0 to 60.8 % 

GS25N6.  

The compressive strength increased from 1.3 (GS31N0) to 1.4, 1.7 and 1.8MPa for the GS29N2, 

GS28N3 and GS25N6 scaffolds respectively, as summarized in table VII.3.

The addition of sodium, a glass network modifier, has enabled the scaffolds (glass/salt mixture) to 

be treated at a lower temperature, comparing with the sodium-free composition GS31N0, increasing 

at the same time the sintering interval of the compacts (Table VII.2), and the densification and 

consequently the mechanical behaviour of the scaffolds, important for further applications, namely 

for tissue engineering.  

Since the porogen (NaCl) is responsible for the macroporosity, and given that the salt content is the 

same in all compacts, the observed higher densification is probably due to the diminishing of 

micropores percentage occurring during the sintering process. 

Fig. VII. 4 compares the effect of sodium addition on the specific surface area of the as-prepared 

glass powders, without the porogen presence, and of the corresponding scaffolds, sintered at the 

conditions presented in table VII.3. As the content of sodium in the glass composition increases, the 

surface area of the correspondent scaffolds decrease.

Fig.VII. 4. Effect of sodium content on the S.S.A of the glass powder (before sintering) and 

corresponding scaffolds obtained at the optimum sintering temperature during 10 min at a heating 

rate of 5 ºC min-1 

As discussed in a previous work [13], the porogen favour the occurrence of an alkaline reaction 

between the glass surface particles of G31N0 and the salt, producing the expansion phenomenon 

observed in the dilatometric curves, Fig. VII.1 and the increase of the specific surface area of the 

obtained porous structures, Fig. VII.4. These results show that the effect of sodium porogen on the 

glass surface becomes less evident with the increase of sodium content in the glass.  

To understand this observation, transmittance FTIR spectroscopy was performed on the as-prepared 

G31N0 and G25N6 glasses, and corresponding glass scaffolds, being the obtained spectra shown in 

Fig. VII.5. FTIR spectra of both glasses, reveals a main absorption band at 1000 – 1200 cm-1 

corresponding to Si ? O ? Si stretching vibration and a shoulder at 890-960 cm-1 assigned to Si – O 

symmetric stretch (non-bridging oxygen, NBO). Another peak was observed at 455 – 476 cm-1 which 

is due to Si ? O ? Si bending vibration. The peaks at 560 cm-1 in the P – O – P bending mode, suggest 

the presence of an amorphous calcium phosphate phase, confirmed by XRD (Fig. not shown) [20–

23].  

After the contact with the salt, the peak attributed to the phosphate phase, split in two, at 557 and 600 

cm?1, for both compositions, due to the formation of a phosphate phase, still amorphous. The 

GS31N0 spectra is more affected, in the presence of salt, Fig. VII.5b. To the shoulder associated to 

Si – O stretch, with one non-bridging oxygen (Si – O – NBO), a new is added, near 850 cm?1 assigned 

to the Si – O(s) with two non-bridging oxygen per SiO4 tetrahedron (Si – O – 2NBO), also called 

Q2 groups associated with alkali ions in the glass network, which are indicative of disintegration of 

the glass structure in contact with the salt [24,25].

MAS-NMR results of the 29Si spectra are presented in Fig. VII. 6. The centre of Q2 peak shifted from 

-80.9 ppm for the base glass to -82.1 ppm for the glass with 6 % Na2O, thus suggesting a slight 

decrease polymerization of the silicate glass network. The addition of alkali oxides to the base glass 

composition, G31N0, modified the network structure by replacing bonding oxygen’s (BO) by non-

bridging oxygen (NBO), thus opening the glass structure.

These results confirm that the salt porogen attack, to the glass structure of the particles surfaces 

during sintering, is more effective when there is no sodium in the glass composition. It is possible 

that the presence of sodium in the composition creates the higher allowable amount of non-bridging 

oxygens in the glass structure thus reducing the possibility of the porogen NaCl to react with the 

glass surface by a salt-glass alkali reaction, as suggested in a previous work [13].

 Conclusion 

Five scaffolds with different chemical compositions, in the 3CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO ? Na2O, have 

been successfully prepared by the salt sintering method, with 60 to 66 % porosity. The scaffolds with 

higher sodium content showed a compressive strength near 2 MPa, close to the minimum value for 

natural trabecular bone.  

The addition of Na2O to the glass composition increased the sintering ability of the glass scaffolds 

which led to denser struts with higher mechanical strength. The sintering window for the processing 

of the new glass scaffolds, when compared to sodium-free glass scaffolds, increased by 4 ºC, 18 °C 

and 37 °C with 5, 10? and 20 mol. % MgO substitution by Na2O, respectively.  

Therefore, the produced scaffolds can be proposed as effective candidates in the field of bone tissue 

regeneration due to their mechanical strength, porosity, SSA and easy tailoring.

CHAPTER VIII 

EFFECT OF GLASS COMPOSITION ON THE IN VITRO BIOACTIVITY 

AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF CA-P-MG-SI-NA SCAFFOLDS  

 

 

Abstract 

Porous glass structures with an open interconnected porosity favourable for tissue ingrowth were 

produced by a salt sintering process and characterized in terms of their in vitro behaviour both in 

acellular and in cellular media. The in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds was tested by soaking them 

in a simulated body fluid (SBF) and by subsequent characterization of the materials surface by SEM, 

EDS, and X-ray diffraction and of the immersion fluid by ICP. The replacement of 6 % MgO by 

Na2O in the glass network allowed to tailor the dissolution rate and bioactivity of the glass scaffolds 

and to obtain significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. 

Regarding the biological assessment, the incorporation of sodium to the composition resulted in a 

poor cell response for small periods. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that for 21 days the cells on 

the glass containing sodium surface recovered, are in a similar number and differentiated stage 

compared to those growing over non-sodium glass. This shows that the cells exhibit full functionality 

after adaptation to the scaffold containing sodium, which takes a few days. This scaffold does not 

negatively affect osteoblasts proliferation rate as shown by the increasing ALP activity and presence 

of mineralized deposits. 

The results showed that scaffolds with different bioactivity and degradation rates can be achieved by 

replacing 6 % of MgO in silicate phosphate bioactive glass with Na2O.

VIII.1 Introduction 

There has been an increasing interest in the development of porous structures for bone tissue 

engineering applications that allow cells to attach, proliferate, differentiate and organize into healthy 

bone tissue as the scaffold degrades [1–4]. Great attention has been paid to bioactive glasses, because 

they have the ability to build a strong interface between the material surface and bone tissue, through 

the formation of a carbonated hydroxyapatite layer on their surface [5]. The bioactivity and 

biocompatibility of these bioactive glasses are strongly affected by their degradation rate and 

associated ion release [6–8]. Therefore, it is expected that the chemical durability and the dissolution 

rates can be tailored by adjusting for example, the oxide composition of the glasses, to suit with their 

end application [9–14]. Several studies showed that addition of B2O3 to phosphate glasses improved 

there chemical durability [14,15]. Incorporation of boron by replacing Na2O into the P2O5?CaO?

Na2O?MgO?B2O3 glass system showed favourable effects on the cell metabolic activity, 

proliferation, and morphology. The ALP activity improved for glasses containing 0 – 5 % B2O3 [14]. 

Substituting Na2O with CaO yielded less degradable glass in the (40-x)Na2O?xCaO?60P2O5 systems 

[16]. An increase of the cross-linkage or the introduction of highly insoluble ions, makes the glass 

structure less susceptible to solution attack. Reducing the degradation rate, concomitant with the 

reduction in the release rate of certain ions, has led to better biocompatibility [17].  

In the previous chapter it was reported the effect of Na2O addition on the processing, structure and 

some properties of glasses within the Ca?P?Mg?Si?Na system. Although the incorporation of Na2O 

in the CaO?P2O5?SiO2–MgO glass composition was advantageous for the scaffolds production, one 

of the main problems associated with high alkali content is its high dissolution rate, when exposed 

to a biological fluid and consequent rapid release of soluble ionic species that regulate the cells 

response [18]. This rapid lixiviation can cause faster bone resorption that may negatively affect the 

balance of natural bone regeneration. Thus compromising the usefulness of the glass behaviour in 

vivo [18,19]. 

The aim of this study is focused on the influence of 6 mol. % MgO substitution by Na2O, on the 

surface reactivity, and biocompatibility of similar scaffolds produced by the salt sintering process 

from glasses of the Si–Ca–P–Mg–Na system.

VIII.2 Materials and method 

VIII.2.1. Glass scaffold preparation 

Glass scaffolds designated by GS31N0  and GS25N6  were prepared via salt sintering process, as 

previously described [20]. Cylindrical green bodies (10 x 10 mm2) of mixtures consisting of glass 

particles (average size 3.5 µm) and 50 wt. % salt particles (212–500 ?m) were shaped by uniaxial 

pressing with an initial density of 1.60±0.02 g.cm-3. 

The compositions of the glasses are presented in Table VIII.I.

G25N6 32.68 10.89 25.43 24.80 6.20 

 

The cylindrical glass/salt powder compacts were heated in an electric furnace up to 750 ºC and 710 

ºC for GS31N0 and GS25N6 respectively, at a heating rate of 5 ºC min-1 and held during 10 min at 

these temperatures. Samples were left to cool inside the furnace until room temperature. The salt was 

removed by leaching in water bath at 30 ºC and 175 rpm, followed by one day drying in a furnace at 

100 ºC, giving rise to the scaffolds. 

VIII.2.2. Glass scaffold characterization  

The amorphous nature of the glass particles for the scaffolds was confirmed by X-ray diffraction 

(XRD) analysis using a Rigaku Diffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? 

radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02º s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 

2? range of 10–60 degree.  

The specific surface area of the scaffolds was determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, 

using the Brunauer, Emmettand Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb 

equipment, Germany was used, small pieces of broken scaffolds were previously kept under vacuum, 

at 200 ºC, for 4 h.   

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra were collected using a Bruker IFS 28 EQuinox 

spectrometer, Germany. For this purpose, the glass samples were mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and 



VIII–Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of 

Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds 

149 

 

pressed into a pellet using a hand press. Transmission spectra of the KBr pellets were collected over 

a region of 4000 – 400 cm?1, with 256 scans and resolution of 4 cm?1. 

Porosities of the scaffolds were measured by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry, using an AutoPore IV 

9500V1.07 serial 734 Penetrometer. Sample weight varied from 0.25 to 0.3 g.  

Mechanical properties of the scaffolds at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 

testing machine. Six cylindrical samples (10 x 10 mm2) were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-

1. Prior to mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth 

parallel surfaces. The elastic modulus was determined from the linear region of the stress vs. strain 

response. 

VIII.2.3. Bioactivity in SBF 

The preparation of the SBF was carried out following the procedure proposed by Kokubo [21,22]. In 

vitro tests were performed under static conditions soaking the glass scaffolds samples in sealed 

polyethylene bottles with SBF solution at 37 ºC, with a constant specimen surface area to solution 

volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1, considering the value of the surface area given by the BET method. The 

samples were kept immersed for different periods of time between 1 hour and 21 days at 37 ºC. After 

each time point, the solution was filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. The samples were 

studied by XRD, FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. A scanning electron microscope attached with an 

energy dispersive electron probe X-ray analyser (SEM-EDS, Hitachi Su-70, Germany system) was 

used to analyse both microstructure of scaffolds before and after immersion into SBF. All samples 

were coated with carbon using an EMITECH K950 device coater, prior to observation.  

The changes in the concentration of Ca, Si, P and Mg ions in SBF solution were determined by 

Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy (ICP, Jobin Yvon, JY70 Plus) at different soaking times. 

VIII.2.4. Biocompatibility studies 

Human bone marrow, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed consent), 

were cultured in in ?-Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 

serum, 100 mg ml-1 penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin, 2.5 mg ml-1 fungizone, at 37 ºC in a humidified 

atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air. For subculture, phosphate-buffered saline (SBF) was used to wash, 

twice, the cell monolayer and then incubated with a trypsin–EDTA solution (0.05 % trypsin, 0.25 % 

EDTA) for 10 min at 37 ºC to detach the cells. Material samples were sterilized by autoclaving at 

120 ºC and the cells were re-suspended in culture medium and seeded (105 cells cm-2) over the 

materials surface for up to 6 days in the experimental conditions described above.

scaffolds

Colonized materials were evaluated at days 7, 14 and 21 for cellular viability/proliferation and 

observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Leica SP2 AOBS), to evaluate throughout 

the culture time the cell morphology, cell viability/proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity 

and ability to form calcium phosphate deposits. Control cultures and seeded material samples were 

cultured for 7 and 21 days in the presence of 50 ?g ml-1 ascorbic acid, 10mM ?-glycerophosphate 

and 10 nM dexamethasone. This experimental conditions reported to allow the osteoblast 

differentiation in this culture system [23]. All the experiments were performed in the first subculture, 

since the sequential passage of bone marrow cells results in a progressive loss of the osteoblastic 

phenotype [24]. 

ALP results are expressed in nanomoles of p-nitrophenol produced per min per lg of protein (nmol 

min-1/lg protein). Values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicates and 

were compared using the student’s t-test, with a significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05. 

VIII.3 Results and Discussion 

VIII.3.1 Scaffold characterization 

SEM micrographs of the scaffolds GS31N0 and GS25N6, Fig. VIII.1, clearly show an interconnected 

macroporosity with smaller pores distributed throughout the structure within larger pores. The two 

samples are quite similar from a macroscopic point of view, as expected, since the size of the 

macropores is controlled by the NaCl particle sizes (250-350 µm). The macropores with size ranging 

from 60 to 500 µm, were 3 dimensionally opened and continuously connected.

(larger than 400 µm) for a) GS31N0 and b) GS25N6  

To assess the microstructural pore features of the GS31N0 and GS25N6 porous glass samples 

mercury porosimetry was performed, providing the total pore volume and the pore size 

characterization as summarized in Table VIII.2. The pore size smaller than 10 µm correspond to the 



VIII–Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of 

Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds 

151 

 

micropores resulting from the sintering process, increasing the interconnectivity of the porous 

structure.  

Macroporosity volume of the two scaffolds was identical, as expected, since it is a result of the same 

salt content present in the mixture. The larger pores were distributed between 60 and 350 µm. This 

pore size was well below the observed in SEM, Fig. VIII.1. The discrepancy between the observed 

values by microscopy and porosimetry is well known, and is attributed to the fact that porosimetry 

technique measures the size of the constrictions of the pores, resulting in an underestimate pore size. 

The median pore diameter ~ 90 ?m of the constrictions is near 100 ?m. The diameter of 

interconnecting pores seems to dictate the quality of tissue growing into the pores. Although there 

are different views, literature compromise seems to be that the optimal pore size for mineralized bone 

ingrowth varies between 100 and 400 µm. 

The resulting porous glass cylinders also showed an open porosity of about 63 % for both GS31N0 

and GS25N6, with about 12 % porosity caused by micropores (&amp;lt;10 µm). The porosity of the 

scaffolds is higher than the theoretical one (45 percent of the pore-foaming agent), which indicated 

that sintering procedure promotes the appearance of some microporosity as shown in the SEM and 

mercury porosimetry. The microporosity &amp;lt;10 µm with a median pore ~2 µm is also important since 

scaffolds involving both micro and macro porosities can perform better than only macro porous 

scaffolds [25].

For bone tissue engineering applications, the diameter of the interconnecting pore structures is one 

of the most important parameters. It should be greater than 100 µm to allow bone tissue ingrowth 

and eventually vascularisation. In this study a median pore diameter near 90 µm was obtained. 

The main goal of this work was to prepare two similar scaffolds with different composition. By 

decreasing the sintering temperature of 750 ºC for the GS31N0 in 40 ºC for the GS25N6, it was 

possible to produce scaffolds with similar porosity. Nevertheless, the resulting scaffolds presented, 

a higher strength and elastic modulus for GS25N6, as resumed in Table VIII.3. The compressive 

strength is inside the range of trabecular bone, 0.1–16MPa [26] and near the Young’s modulus 0.05–

0.5GPa [27].

VIII.3.2 In vitro bioactivity studies in SBF 

The in vitro tests in SBF were performed on both glass scaffolds, to evaluate the composition effect 

on bioactivity, in acellular media. The FTIR absorbance spectra for the glass scaffolds, before and 

after immersion into SBF are shown in Fig. VIII.2, for 3 and 7 days immersion.   

Before soaking, both scaffolds showed intense silicate group absorption bands. The intense bands at 

~1020 and ~920 cm-1 are assigned to the Si – O – Si asymmetric stretch and Si – O (NBO) symmetric 

stretch respectively. The peaks at ~ 594, 552 and 600 cm-1, correspondent to the P – O bending, were 

present in both samples. GS25N6 also presented an additional peak at ~459 cm-1 correspondent to 

the Si – O – Si bending.  

The FTIR spectra of the GS31N0, after 3 days of immersion in SBF, showed a decrease in 

transmittance intensity and a split into a weak twin band around 570 and 600 cm?1 which corresponds 

to the bending mode of P – O bonds in the amorphous calcium phosphate [28,29]. After 7 days, 

another set of peaks formed at 1460, 1420 and 870 cm-1, was attributed to the formation of C – O 

bonds [30].  

In the GS25N6, a behaviour similar to that of GS31N0 was observed at 3 days immersion. After 7 

days immersion, the peaks related with the presence of calcium phosphate phase 602 and 506 cm-1, 

became sharper which is related to the presence of apatite crystalline phase [31] as a consequence of 

the reaction with the SBF. CO2 is incorporated from the solution, producing a broad peak near 870 

cm-1. The C – O bonds (at 1460 and, 1420 cm-1) have undergone peak splitting.  

The presence of P – O and C – O bonds suggests the formation of apatite and indicates the in vitro 

SBF bioactivity of the scaffolds [32]. All glasses exhibited the splitter band at 1412 and 1460 cm-1 

and the band at 875 cm-1 which indicate the presence of CO3 groups whereas the bands observed at 

1040 – 1050, 602 and 563 cm-1 were assigned to PO4/HPO4 groups (crystalline HCA). The P – O 

bending peak pronunciation indicates the growth of the hydroxyapatite-like layer [33].

 FTIR data after immersion of the prepared glass scaffolds in SBF for 3 and 7 days; a) 

GS31N0  and b) GS25N6   

The X-Ray diffractographs of the scaffolds after 1 hour, 3, 7 and 14 days immersion in SBF are 

presented in Fig. VIII. 3. After 1 hour immersion, both scaffolds are essentially amorphous, with 

some insipient apatitic peaks, observed especially on GS31N0.  

After 3 days soaking the diffraction planes (2 1 3), (2 1 1), and (0 0 2), of GS31N0  and GS25N6, 

corresponding to the peaks at 49º, 32º, and 26º respectively, indicate that small apatitic crystals 

precipitate after immersion, Ca5(PO4)3(OH) according to the card No. 01-086-0740, the X’Pert 

HighScore database,  confirming the previous FTIR results. Also incipient peaks of whitlockite 

(Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2) appear in the GS31N0, at (2 1 4), (0 2 10), (1 2 8) and (2 1 10) corresponding 

to the peaks 28º, 31º, 33º and 36º, according to the card No. 01-087-1582.  

After 14 days immersion, both scaffolds presented, together with the apatite phase diffraction planes, 

new diffraction peaks for 13.7º, 17º and 58º assigned to the reflection (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (3 3 9) of 

whitlockite.  It is possible that magnesium is incorporated into the atomic structure of HA and that 

HA phase cohabites with whitlockite. The precipitation of these two phases (apatite and whitlockite), 

was also observed in the literature, on the surface of glasses containing Mg when exposed to SBF 

[34–36]. The increased intensity of the hydroxyapatite peaks with soaking time is indicative of the 

growth of an apatite layer of enhanced crystallinity.  

By 14 days, in GS25N6, it was no longer possible to observe the amorphous halo, in the range of 20-

30 degrees, promoted by the presence of an amorphous phase on the sample probably due to the 

completely covered of the surfaces by the HA layer. The mechanisms of the interaction between both 

glass scaffolds compositions and the SBF seem basically the same. In the first 3 days the presence 

of HA was higher on GS31N0, although the development of hydroxyapatite seems to slow down on 

GS31N0, for longer immersion times. The presence of the amorphous halo is particularly evident 

even after 14 days of immersion on the GS31N0 while on GS25N6 it disappears, been covered by 

the crystalline phases present.

 XRD of the scaffolds after immersion in SBF, for 7 and 14 days for a) GS31N0 and b) 

GS25N6  samples 

The surface modifications observed after immersion of the scaffolds in SBF were accompanied with 

microstructural observation. Fig. VIII.4 shows the SEM micrographs of the surface of the scaffolds 

GS31N0 and GS25N6, after soaking in SBF for 3, 7 and 21 days. The macroporous structure for all 

scaffolds was intact after soaking, although the surfaces of these scaffolds have presented important 

changes.  Soon after 3 days, some agglomerates formed on the surface of the scaffolds and after 7 

days a dense layer was found on both surfaces. Needle-shaped crystallites fully covering the surfaces 

can be observed after 21 days. The morphology of the precipitated layer on GS31N0 is somehow 

different from that on GS25N6, probably due to the different degrees of crystallinity of the calcium 

phosphates formed on the scaffolds, slightly higher on GS31N0, as suggested by the XRD patterns, 

Fig. VIII.3.

EDS analysis to the precipitated layers confirmed that their chemical compositions can be assigned 

to a hydroxyl apatite phase. Fig. VIII. 5, shows for 14 days soaking a Ca/P ratio of 1.6 and 1.7 for 

GS31N0 and GS25N6 respectively, while in the stoichiometric HA Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 is 1.67.  

The above results indicate that these scaffolds can induce the formation with different rates, of a 

HCA layer on their surface in SBF, confirming the bioactivity of the scaffolds and their capacity as 

a material for bone tissue engineering.

The ion release profile of the glass scaffolds in SBF provides an outline of the degradation behaviour 

of all ions of the glass, Fig. VIII.6.  

After the initial short period, in which phosphorus ions dissolution occurs, it is observed for GS25N6 

a decrease of P ion concentration in solution, together with the drop of Ca2+ concentration, soon 

after 1 day, Fig. VIII.6a.  

In the base glass scaffold, GS31N0, it was found that the concentration of calcium increased up 7 

days followed by a gradually decrease. After 1 hour immersion, phosphate ions remain almost 

constant up to 7 days followed also by a decreased. 

The GS25N6 release the greatest amount of Si in the first hour and Mg in the first day, Fig. VIII.6b. 

After the first hour, Si dissolution profile was similar for both scaffolds. Si concentration increased 

during the first 7 days immersion, and then no significant changes took place, Fig. VIII.6b. The 

Mg concentration release on GS25N6 was lower than that observed for GS31N0 as a consequence 

of the lower content of MgO in the composition of the G25N6 glasses. The decrease in Mg2+ 

concentrations in the SBF after reaching maximum can also indicates that such ions could be 

incorporated in the HA layer formed on the surface of the glasses, as confirmed by XRD presence 

of apatite and whitlockite phases, for 14 days immersion.

scaffolds

The pH variation with time, Fig. VIII.6c, strongly increased during the first 72 h for GS25N6, 

reaching a value of 8.2 after 14 days. The increase of pH on GS31N0 was slower, increasing up to 

8.2 after 7 days immersion and then no significant change took place. This increase probably 

results from the reduction in the concentration of H+ ions due to their exchange with the cations in 

the glasses (Ca2+, Mg2+ and also Na+ in the GS25N6). The stabilization of the Ca2+ concentration 

in SBF can be explained by considering two opposite processes. In one hand, the release of Ca2+ 

from the glass, and in the other hand, the consumption of these ions due to the formation of the 

apatite-type layer, as confirmed by SEM images in Fig. VIII.5.  Together with this process the 

increase of hydroxyl concentration in the solution contributes for the attack of the silica glass 

network, resulting in the breaking of Si – O – Si bonds and consequent formation of Si – OH 

(silanols) on the glass/solution interface (FTIR results, Fig. VIII.2b. The condensation and re-

polymerisation of a SiO2-rich layer on the surface of the scaffolds may explain the stabilization of 

Si and pH, Fig. VIII.6c, in the solution.  

The formation of apatite due to the crystallization of the amorphous calcium phosphate by 

incorporation of OH and CO3
2- anions from the solution, is confirmed by FTIR, XRD and EDS.

and calcium content and (b) silica and magnesium content and (c) pH values. Lines are to guide 

the eye 

With the introduction of sodium in the glass composition to produce the GS25N6 scaffold, the 

network connectivity reduces and the glass solubility tends to increase. In fact substituting 

MgO with Na2O usually produces more degradable glasses, since Na
+ ions have less stronger

field strengths than Mg2+ ions [37]. This seems to facilitate the higher concentration of Mg 

and Si in the first hours and consequent higher pH, in the first 72 hours. 

The lower rate of the calcium phosphate layer formation, due to the presence of Mg observed 

in the GS31N0 composition in the first hours, is also reported in literature [34], with glasses 

containing MgO above 7 mol. %. The role of Mg2+ is interpreted as an inhibitor in the formation 

of the silica gel  [38], due to the suppressing effect on the calcium dissolution. Marie Vallet-Reg?? et 

al [34] also reported a whitlockite-like phase together with the apatite-like phase and an increase in 

thickness of the formed HA layer with the height content of MgO. 

VIII.3.3 Biocompatibility studies 

Human bone marrow cells, cultured in experimental conditions that favour the osteoblastic 

differentiation [23,24] were seeded over the glass scaffold (GS31N0 and GS25N6 ) samples up to 

21 days. Fig. VIII.7 shows the results for viability/proliferation and the ALP activity observed over 

the materials. Cell viability/proliferation increased throughout the 21 days culture time on both 

scaffolds. At day 7, values observed on GS25N6 were significantly lower indicating the presence of 

a lower number of cells, compared to that on GS31N0. This observation suggests some deleterious 

effects in the adhesion of the cells on GS25N6 and on the subsequent proliferation during the first 

days of culture. This is most probably due to the high dynamics of the interactions between this 

scaffold and the medium observed during the first days, as described above, leading to a surface 

instability which hinders cell adhesion. However, after that period, cells proliferated with a high 

growth rate and, at day 21, values were only slightly lower than those observed on GS31N0. The 

progressive establishment of a more stable surface environment on GS25N6, with time, created 

favourable conditions for cell proliferation.  

ALP activity also increased with culture time in both scaffolds, suggesting the on-going of 

differentiation osteogenic pathway. ALP is an early marker of osteoblast lineage cells, and is known 

to have a determinant role in the mineralization of the extracellular collagenous matrix, by providing 

phosphate ions that, with calcium ions are used in the formation of the cell-mediated mineralized 

matrix [39]. Compared to GS31N0, ALP activity was significantly lower on GS25N6 at days 7 and 

14. However, at day 21, the enzyme activity was only slightly lower. These results suggest that, after 

the initial delay, cultures recovered tending to behave similarly to that observed on GS31N0.  

Colonized scaffolds were observed by SEM up to day 21. At day 7, both scaffolds presented well 

spread cells, adapting to the irregular underlying topography, and evidence of cell growth inside the 

pores. GS25N6 presented lower number of attached cells. At day 21, a more abundant and organized 

cell layer was noticed on both scaffolds and, in close association, the presence of mineralized deposits 

was observed (slightly lower in GS25N6).

Biocompatibility observations are in line with those reported in the bioactivity studies performed in 

SBF (Figs. VIII.4 and 5). Both glass scaffolds compositions GS31N0 and GS25N6 were able to 

support the formation of cells mediated mineralized deposits. The globular structures associated with 

the cell layer, seen at day 21 (Fig. VIII.8 (c and f)), contain Ca and P peaks. The observed rough 

surface, due to the sintering with salt, is a key factor in the attachment and proliferation of bone cells, 

increasing the surface area of the scaffold. 

The higher concentration of magnesium present in the ICP measurements in the first days due to the 

faster degradation on the glass scaffolds containing sodium, may result in a negative effect on 

adhesion and initial cell proliferation.  

From the results above, it is indicated that the composition modification of the scaffolds had a 

deleterious effect on the attachment and proliferation of HBMC’s during the first days. As referred 

above, the faster degradation originates highly dynamic ion exchange reactions, which is 

deleterious for cell attachment, as the ionic environment influences the interaction of cells and 

materials. However, the progressive stabilization of the cell surface allowed a fast recovery of the 

osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. In vivo, it is believed that this initial effect might be 

greatly attenuated, due to the continuous circulation of the body fluids, improving cell response 

[5,18]. 

VIII.4 Conclusions 

Two similar glass scaffolds with different chemical compositions in the system 3CaO.P2O5- SiO2-

MgO-Na2O have been successfully prepared by the salt sintering method. The scaffolds exhibited in 

vitro bioactive behaviour, as a hydroxyapatite layer was formed on samples surface after soaking in 

simulated body fluids.  

Cell culture studies of the glass scaffolds using HBM cells showed that both scaffolds possessed 

good cellular response in terms of cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation.  

Substitution of MgO by Na2O in the base glass network, lowered the scaffolds chemical durability, 

which explains the faster degradation rate and formation of surface HA. The faster degradation 

originates highly dynamic ion exchange reactions, with deleterious effect on the attachment and 

proliferation of HBMC’s during the first days. A rapid recover of the Na containing scaffold 

promote similar results for longer times. Therefore, the produced scaffolds can be proposed as 

effective candidates in the field of bone tissue replacement due to their easy tailoring, bioactivity and 

biocompatibility.

CHAPTER IX 

CRYSTALLIZATION EFFECT IN THE IN VITRO BIOACTIVITY AND 

BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF A CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE-BASED 

GLASS BULK AND SCAFFOLD 

 

 

Abstract 

The mineralization of glasses and glass-ceramics in an acellular medium is related with the ability to 

form an apatite layer on their surfaces. Glass-ceramics and glasses have significant differences in the 

formation of this layer due to distinct surface reactivities. The surface reactivity is related with the 

rate of glass dissolution and with the nature and amount of crystalline phases in the glass-ceramics. 

The in vitro behaviour of the 3CaO.P2O5–SiO2–MgO glass and glass-ceramics bulks and their 

corresponding scaffolds, were studied in this work. FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDS analysis of the 

samples after immersion in simulated body fluid showed the presence of an apatite layer on their 

surfaces, which formed faster on the glass than on the glass-ceramics. In addition, biocompatibility 

studies were investigated by in vitro cell culture with human bone marrow cells. The cells showed a 

normal morphology and high growth rate in the glass when compared to standard culture plates. 

Contrarily, lower cell proliferation occurred in the glass-ceramics, especially on the bulk probably 

due to high Mg ionic concentration in the cell culture medium as a consequence of the degradation 

of the amorphous phase. Therefore, the goal of an ideal scaffold that provides good mechanical 

support temporarily while maintaining a tailorable bioactivity and biocompatibility can be achieved 

with the development of glass-ceramic scaffolds.

IX.1. Introduction 

Since the development by Hench et al. [1,2], of the designated 45S5 Bioglass, with a composition of 

45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.4% CaO and 6% P2O5 in wt. %, many different compositions have been 

explored over the years for bone repair applications. Bioactive glasses constitute an interesting group 

of inorganic materials to be used as bone repair scaffolds, due to their high bioactivity, 

biocompatibility, osteoconductive and osteoproductive properties [3,4]. These materials are able to 

bind with bone and soft tissues through their unique ability to form a hydroxyl carbonate apatite 

(HCA) layer on the surface as a result of their chemical reactivity in physiological media. The release 

of ionic species from bioactive glasses, due to dissolution, is the first step of a sequence of events 

that lead to the precipitation of HCA on the glass surface in vitro [5,6] and in vivo [7,8], creating a 

favourable environment for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation thus stimulating new bone 

formation. This sequence of events, reactions on the material surface, are explained in detail by 

Hench [2,9,10]. The degradation kinetics of the glasses should match the regeneration kinetics of 

new bone in vitro and/or in vivo. A further requirement, particularly in bone engineering, for a 

scaffold, is a controllable interconnected porosity that can provide greater surface area for 

vascularization, and bone in-growth [11,12].  

Developing biocompatible glass and glass scaffolds with adequate degradability and appropriate 

mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications remains a challenge for biomedical 

engineers [13–15]. Controllable dissolution rates and suitable strength can be achieved by the 

production of glass-ceramics through controlled glass crystallization [16]. 

Chen et al [17] have successfully synthesized highly porous, mechanically competent, bioactive and 

biodegradable 45S5 Bioglass-derived glass–ceramic scaffolds for bone engineering, with fine 

crystals of Na2Ca2Si3O9. After immersion in simulated body fluid for 28 days, this crystalline phase 

was transformed into an amorphous calcium phosphate phase. By controlling the crystallinity 

fraction, authors found that the biodegradable rate could be tailored since the degradation rate and 

conversion to an HA-like material of 45S5 glass-ceramics become very slow with crystallization 

increase [18].  

Previous work on the crystallization process of a 3CaO.P2O5–SiO2–MgO glass has shown that the 

crystallization of this glass starts with the whitlockite phase (in fact magnesium whitlockite – 

(Ca2.589MgO0.411)(PO4)2), also known as ?-TCMP [19].  

It has been reported [20] that the presence of magnesium in ?-TCP, significantly decreases the 

solubility due to the partially replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+, a smaller cation that promotes increased

bonding and consequent stability. Recently, the Mg-containing ?-TCP [21,22] has been gain much 

attention, improving bone metabolism and biocompatibility [23,24] when compared to ?-TCP. 

The aim of this work was to modulate the glass surface reactivity through carefully controlled thermal 

treatments obtaining a glass-ceramic, with only one crystalline phase, whitlockite. The effect of 

crystallinity degree on the in vitro behaviour was attested in simulated body fluid SBF and through 

human osteoblast cells response. The effect of microstructural characteristics on the bioactivity of 

the glass–ceramics (bulk and porous scaffolds) was also discussed. 

IX.2. Materials and Methods 

 Glass and glass-ceramic bulks  

Glass with molar composition 32.7 % CaO, 10.9 % P2O5, 25.4 % SiO2 and 31 % MgO (mol. %)  was 

produced by conventional melt quenching technique, mixing the required amounts of analytical grade 

SiO2, Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O, MgO and CaCO3 and melting at 1500 ºC in Pt crucible for 2 h in air.  

The glass was cast in a stainless steel mould and annealed for 30 minutes at 740 ºC. The bulk glass 

samples were prepared with dimensions of 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm3, polished with sandpaper grain size 

successively thinner and finished with diamond paste of 15, 6, 3 and 1 µm particle size. The polished 

samples were cleaned in ultrasonic bath, first with alcohol and then with ultrapure water.  

The samples were further treated, based on DTA data obtain in previous work [19], at 840 and 910 

ºC for 2 hours at a heating rate of 5 ºC min-1 in order to crystallize the glass samples. The amorphous 

bulk specimens were designated G31 and the glass-ceramics were denominated G31C-84 and G31C-

91 in accordance with their respective heat treatment, at 840 and 910 ºC, respectively. After heat 

treatment the samples were polished with diamond paste of 15, 6, 3 and 1µm particle size. 

 Scaffolds  

Glasses were also prepared in frit form for scaffolds production using the salt sintering technique 

[25]. The frit was dried and then milled and sieved to obtain glass powders with mean particle size 

of 3.5 µm, as determined by the light scattering technique (Coulter LS 230, Fraunhofer optical model, 

MA). A mixture of glass particles and 50 wt. % NaCl (212-500 ?m) was prepared. The mixture was 

pressed and sintered at 750 ºC for 10 min. After sintering, the incorporated porogen was removed 

through aqueous washing, thus resulting a porous glass scaffold, denominated GS31, with ~ 65 % 

porosity, containing macropores with diameters between 150 and 500 ?m and micropores with 

diameter &amp;lt;60 ?m.  



IX – Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold 

171 

 

Crystallization of the glass scaffolds was performed by heating the samples in an electric furnace up 

to 900 ºC, at a heating rate 5 ºC min–1, and maintained at this temperature for 30 min, in order to 

crystallize the glass scaffolds. These heat-treatments were chosen based on dilatometric and DTA 

analysis of the glass/salt mixture, as studied before [25]. These glass-ceramic scaffolds were 

denominated GS31C-90.  

Mechanical properties of the scaffolds at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 

testing machine. Six cylindrical samples (10 x 10 mm2) were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-

1. Prior to mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth 

parallel surfaces. 

Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry, was used to measure both porosity and pore sizes using an AutoPore 

IV 9500V1.07 serial 734 Penetrometer. Sample weight varied from 0.25 to 0.3 g. Given that the 

porosimeter measurement determines the intruded volume of mercury per gram sample, it is assumed 

that this value gives the open porosity i.e., is equal to the porous volume (V) per gram sample. 

 Phase analysis 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed in all samples using a Rigaku Diffractometer 

Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed 

of 0.02º s-1. Data was obtained in the 2? range of 10-80 degree to investigate the characteristic phases 

and crystallinity amount of the fabricated samples. For XRD measurements, the samples were ground 

and measured in powder form. 

The amount of the crystalline phase (crystallized volume fraction) contained in the glass-ceramic, 

bulk and scaffolds, was determined according to the procedure used by Krimm and Tobolsky [26] 

and recently by Daguano et al  [27]. The percent crystallinity, CF, was calculated by the ratio of the 

crystalline area, CA, present in the diffractogram of the glass-ceramics and the total area, TA 

(amorphous + crystalline), present in this diffractogram using the following equation [28]: 

CF = (CA/TA) x 100                                (Eq. IX.1) 

The crystallized phases were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi Su-

70, Japan system. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were also used on bulk glass-ceramics. 

 In vitro bioactivity  

The in vitro behaviour was assessed by soaking glass and glass-ceramic bulk and porous samples in 

simulated body fluid (SBF) for periods from 1 hour up to 14 days. The SBF solution was prepared 

according to the formulation of Kokubo and Takadama [29]. A constant specimen surface area to

172 

 

solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1 was used, considering the value of the surface area given by the 

BET method. Glass-ceramic bulk samples were also analyzed for longer times, 10, 20, 30 days and 

5 months. Subsequently the samples were placed in a polyethylene bottle containing SBF solution, 

and kept for various periods of time, without shaking, in an incubator at 37 ºC, in accordance with a 

protocol referred to in literature [30–32]. Four samples were used for each immersion time. After 

removal from the SBF, samples were dried at 60 ºC. The assessment of the samples dissolution 

profile, ionic concentration changes in SBF, was based on data from inductively coupling plasma 

spectrometry (ICP) testing using a Jobin-Yvon JY70 Plus, France. The pH changes were evaluated 

at the different soaking times. 

SEM and XRD were used as described previously. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was 

applied to analyze the elemental composition of the surface of the samples immersed in SBF at 

different time intervals. For EDS analysis the samples were carbon sputtered under high vacuum (6.7 

x 10-3 Pa).  

FTIR analysis, were also used to characterize the HA-like layer formed on all samples after 

immersion in SBF. Bulk samples were recorded in a Brucker tensor 27 spectrometer, using a Golden 

Gate single reflection diamond ATR system, with no need for sample preparation. Scaffolds were 

reduced to powder and mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using a hand press. All 

spectra were collected over a region of 4000 – 400 cm?1 and taken as the average of two independent 

measurements with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1. For comparison purposes samples without 

immersion were analysed as well. 

 Osteoblastic cytocompatibility  

IX.2.5.1. Human bone marrow cell cultures 

Human bone marrow, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed consent), 

was cultured in ?-Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 

100 mg/ml penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin, 2.5 mg ml-1 fungizone, at 37 ºC in a humidified 

atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air. For subculture, the cell monolayer was incubated with a trypsin–

EDTA solution (0.05 % trypsin, 0.25 % EDTA) for 10 min at 37 ºC to detach the cells. Cells were 

re-suspended in culture medium and seeded (5 x 104 cells cm-2) over the material samples 

(previously sterilized by autoclaving at 120 ºC).  Seeded material samples were cultured for 21 

days in the presence of 50 ?g ml-1 ascorbic acid, 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate and 10 nM 

dexamethasone. This experimental conditions are reported to allow the osteoblast differentiation in 

this culture system [33]. All the experiments were performed in the first subculture, since the 

sequential passage of bone marrow cells results in a progressive loss of the osteoblastic phenotype

[34]. Colonized materials were evaluated for cell morphology, cell viability/proliferation, alkaline 

phosphatase (ALP) activity and ability to form calcium phosphate deposits.   

IX.2.5.2.  Cell viability/proliferation 

Cell viability/proliferation was evaluated by the Resazurin assay. Resazurin (7-Hydroxy-3H-

phenoxazin-3-one 10-oxide), a non-fluorescent blue component is reduced in the mitochondria of the 

living cells to the pink fluorescent component resorufin. This is a non-destructive assay, alloying the 

same samples to be followed throughout the culture time. At each time-point, culture medium was 

removed, and fresh medium with 10 % (v/v) of resazurin was added to the cells. Cultures were 

incubated at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO2 for 3 h. Then, 100 µL of the 

culture medium were transferred to a 96-well plate and the fluorescence intensity was measured in a 

microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek, USA) at 535 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm 

emission wavelength. The results were expressed in relative fluorescence units.  

For celular observation, samples were fixed (1.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.14 M sodium cacodylate 

buffer, pH = 7.3, 10 min), dehydrated in graded alcohols, critical-point dried, sputter-coated with a 

Au/Pd thin film (SPI Module Sputter Coater equipment), and observed in a High resolution 

(Schottky) Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Quanta 400 FEG ESEM) with a X-ray 

energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) microanalysis capability. 

IX.2.5.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity 

ALP activity was evaluated in cell lysates (0.1 % Triton X-100, 5 min) by the hydrolysis of p-

nitrophenyl phosphate in alkaline buffer solution (pH ~10.3; 30 min, 37 ºC) and colorimetric 

determination of the product (p-nitrophenol) at 400 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Synergy HT, 

Biotek). ALP activity was normalized to total protein content (quantified by Bradford’s method) and 

was expressed as nmol/min.?g protein-1.  

IX.2.5.4. Statistical analysis 

Values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replicates and were compared using 

the student’s t-test, with a significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05.

IX.3. Results and discussion 

 Bulk and scaffolds characterization 

The XRD patterns of all the samples, glass and glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds are shown in Fig. 

IX.1a and 1b, respectively. All glass-ceramics studied in this work presented a whitlockite phase 

with Ca substituting Mg, (Ca,Mg)O·P2O5 solid solution or  ?-TCMP, according to the card No. 01-

087-1582 in the X’Pert HighScore database. As can be observed in Fig. IX. 1, a higher degree of 

crystallization was obtained in the glass-ceramics bulk by increasing the temperature from 840 to 

910 ºC, with a holding time of 2 hours. The XRD pattern of the glass-ceramic scaffold, GS31C-91, 

after heat treatment at 910 ºC, 30 min, were also shown in Fig. IX.1.  

Glass-ceramic G31C-84 presents an amount of 39 % crystal phase, calculated according to Eq. IX.1. 

The crystallinity (CF) increased considerably to 82 % with the treatment at 910 ºC, G31C-91. Glass-

ceramic scaffolds presented an amount of 76 % crystal phase. As observed in previous work [25] the 

salt sintering method promote an earlier crystallization of the glass scaffolds when compared to the 

glass heat treatment without salt. In this case, it is possible to obtain the same crystalline phase with 

a treatment 10 ºC lower and a holding time 90 min shorter. Although the goal of the work was to 

prepare a glass-ceramic bulk and scaffold with the same crystalline fraction, due to experimental 

difficulties (presence of a second crystalline phase on the scaffold) we choose to work with a 

difference of 6 % crystalline fraction between the G31C-91 and the GS31C-90.

The development of a crystalline phase in the bulk samples with increasing temperature could be 

also observed on the micrographs obtained by SEM, Fig. IX. 2.

Glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds present a similar microstructure, namely porosity with 

interconnected pores in the range of 100 – 500 ?m, Fig. IX. 3a) and b).  

These results were confirmed by the intrusion data determined by mercury porosimetry, Table IX.1. 

The glass and glass-ceramic scaffold present a porosity of 63 % and 68 % respectively (pores &amp;lt;400 

?m), with similar microporosity (13 % &amp;lt;10 um). 

 

Fig.IX.3. Microstructure of the glass scaffold, GS31 (a) and of the glass-ceramic scaffold 

after heat treatment at 5 ºC min-1, for 30 min at 900 ºC, GS31C-90 (b) 

The obtained glass-ceramic scaffold presented an increase on the compression strength compared 

with the untreated glass scaffolds, from 1.3±0.2 to 5.9±0.1 MPa. Since the porosity of the glass and 

glass-ceramics are similar, the significant increase mechanical behaviour was provided by the 

presence of the crystalline phase on the scaffold.

 In vitro bioactivity  

IX.3.2.1. In vitro bioactivity of bulk samples  

During the first SBF soaking hour it was observed mainly the dissolution of the glass bulk, G31, Fig. 

IX.4a and 4b. With one day immersion, Fig. IX.4c, it was already observed a completely formed 

layer. Finally, for 5 and 7 days immersion the precipitated layer takes a form of plates with reasonable 

dimensions, Fig. IX.4d, weakly adherent to the glass surface (without effort the layer stands out).

IX.3.2.2. In vitro bioactivity of the bulk glass-ceramic  

In the first soaking hours of the glass-ceramic samples, G31C-84 and -91, it was observed the 

dissolution of sample. G31C-84 dissolution occurs primarily between crystals of calcium phosphate, 

as can be seen in Fig. IX.5a and 5b. With the immersion time, the amount of small deposits 

considerably increases. With 30 days immersion, Fig. IX.5c, it was clearly seen the formation of

177 

 

precipitates on the surface, with approximately 8 µm wide. To better understand the nature of the 

precipitated layer and also to obtain a sufficiently representative thickness layer, a 5 months 

immersion was performed, wherein the SBF was replaced monthly. A large precipitate amount was 

observed on the surface of the glass-ceramics, Fig. IX.5e, where a part of the glass-ceramic was 

partially covered by a fissured layer, apparently with no separation from the substrate.  

The G31C-91 with an IC of 82 % had a slower dissolution. During the thirty days of immersion in 

SBF it wasn’t detected any formation of precipitates, Fig. IX.5d, in G31C-91 while on the surface of 

G31C-84, Fig. IX.5c, globular structures and cracks are noticed.  

The same results are observed only after 5 months, for the G31C-91 in Fig. IX.5f. During immersion 

in SBF, the onset time of the precipitate layer formation changed from 1 day, for the original bulk 

glass, to 5 months for the 82 % crystallized sample. The reaction rate was reduced with increase 

crystallization degree.

IX.3.2.3. In vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds 

SEM micrographs of the glass scaffolds exhibited, soon after 3 days in the SBF solution, Fig. IX.6a, 

a detectable surface precipitate. After 7 days immersion, Fig. IX. 6c), it was observed a complete 

coverage of the surface of the porous structure. Glass-ceramic scaffolds also present spherical 

particles aggregates that for 7 days almost fully cover the surface.  For soaking times below 7 days 

there was no clear difference on the surfaces of the glass and glass-ceramic scaffold, i.e., there are 

no obvious effect of crystallinity on the precipitated structures of the scaffolds.

IX.3.2.4. Analysis of the precipitated layer 

The XRD analysis, Fig. IX.7, presented on the glass bulk samples after 7 days immersion and on 

glass-ceramics after 5 months immersion, the diffraction peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite at 

2?= 25.9º, 31.6º, 32.7º, 34º, 50º and 53º attributed to reflections (0 0 2), (1 2 1), (3 0 0), (2 0 2), (2 1 

3) and (0 0 4) respectively accordingly to the card No. 01-073-2567. 

After 5 months immersion in SBF, both glass-ceramic bulks presented in addition to the growing 

peaks of hydroxyapatite-like phase, the decrease crystallinity of the whitlockite phase. The sharp 

diffraction peaks of the whitlockite phase, observed in Fig. IX.1, disappeared from the XRD

spectrum of the G31C-84 leaving a typical broad halo (produced by an amorphous phase) overlapped 

by the sharp diffraction peaks of the HA phase. This indicates that under the detection limits of XRD, 

the G31C-84 was mainly composed of an amorphous phase and crystalline apatite. 

In the glass scaffold, Fig. IX.7b, after 3 day immersion it was detected the characteristic peaks of 

crystalline hydroxyapatite. After 14 days immersion, the scaffold GS31 present increased intensity 

of the characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite, 2? = 25.9º, 31.6º, 32.7º, 34º, 50º card No.01-073-2567. 

Also incipient peaks of whitlockite (Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2) appear in the GS31 at the peaks 28º, 31º, 

and 36º, corresponding to the planes (2 1 4), (0 2 10) and (2 1 10) according to the card No. 01-087-

1582.  

The difference between G31 and GS31 bioactivity are more evident in XRD. For 7 days immersion 

the apatite layer on the G31 was more crystalline than that on GS31. 

The glass-ceramic scaffold presented after 3 days, a decrease intensity of the whitlockite peaks, but 

no detectable apatite phase peaks. After 7 days immersion, the whitlockite was still present with 

lower intensity and the diffraction peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite emerge with increase 

intensity after 14 days immersion. The peaks characteristic of whitlockite phase almost disappears 

after 14 days immersion. 

The transformation of a crystalline phase to a degradable amorphous phase prior to CHA layer 

deposition, observed in this work for all glass-ceramics, was also observed in the literature on 45S5 

glass-ceramics [35], HA and related calcium phosphates ceramics in an in vivo environment [23].  

As the crystallization fraction increase the time required for HA layer formation on the material 

surface was higher. The glass-ceramic scaffold high surface area increased the kinetic of this 

transformation, lowering the onset of HA formation when compared to the bulk glass-ceramics.

immersion and respective glass-ceramics with 5 months immersion, b) glass scaffold 

GS31 and c) glass-ceramic scaffold, GS31C-90, after immersion in SBF  

The FTIR spectra of the bulks before SBF immersion, G31, G31C-84 and G31C-91, are shown in 

Fig. IX. 8a, 8c and 8d respectively and the glass-ceramic scaffolds spectra, before and after 

immersion, in Fig. IX.8b. 

The control spectra of the G31, Fig. IX.8a, contained wide vibrational bands assigned to the Si – O 

– Si stretching and P – O bending at ~1000 and 554 cm?1, respectively. The broad resonance in the 

range 850–950 cm-1 correspondent to the Si – O – NBO (non-bridging oxygen) vibrational mode was 

associated with the Ca ions in the glass network. 

The bulk glass-ceramics before immersion presented a peak at 1060 cm?1 and a double peak at 565 

and 603 cm-1, attributed to the P – O bending vibrations due to the presence of whitlockite phase 

[36].  

In the glass bulk, Fig. IX.8a, after 7 days, the appearance of the double peak from P – O bending 

bonds at 565 and 605 cm-1 revealed the presence of HA. The C ? O stretching band at 800–890 cm-1 

and P – O stretching at 910–1040 cm-1 are due the crystalline nature of HCA layer [37].  

The increased definition of the peaks related to PO vibrations, P ? O bend ( at 565, 603 1 and 1050 

cm-) and the apperence of a P ? O stretch (at 1120 and 945 cm-1) is indicative of an increase in the 

crystallinity of the precipitated HCA layer [37], on the glass-ceramic scaffold, after 7 days immersion. 



IX – Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold 

181 

 

In the G31C-84 spectrum, Fig. IX.8c, as the crystalline Ca-P layer grows, the double peaks 

correspondent to P ? O bend (at 565, 605 and 1050 cm-1) become sharp and dominate the FTIR 

spectra after 5 months immersion, indicating the growth of crystalline apatite in vitro. 

The G31C-91, Fig. IX.8d, samples does not show modification of the structure after 7 days. Well 

established hydroxyapatite were present at 5 months, as evidenced by the pronounced dual P – O 

peaks near 602 and 575 cm-1 in the glass-ceramic and the presence of the peaks at 1450 and 1410 

cm-1 and a third at 870 cm-1, due to the presence of CO vibration.  

These results suggest that the apatite formed on the surface of all bulk samples, after 7 days and 5 

months immersion in SBF, for glass and glass-ceramic bulks respectively, was carbonated apatite, 

which is similar in composition and structure to bone apatite.  Glass-ceramic scaffolds results after 

7 days immersion were similar to the glass bulk. 

The characteristic bands of the hydroxyl carbonate apatite layer (HCA) after 5 months immersion 

completely overlays the peaks related to Si – O bonds.

G31C-84 and c) G31C-91 before and up to 7 days immersion in SBF. The glass-ceramic 

bulk spectrums after 5 months soaking are also presented.  

The EDS pattern for the bulk glass, G31, Fig. IX.9, reveals that after 5 days immersed in SBF (value 

not shown) the precipitated layer observed on Fig. IX.3c, has a Ca/P ratio of 1.30 near an octacalcium 

phosphate OCP (Ca/P = 1.33) that gradually changes to hydroxyapatite (Ca/P = 1.66) between 14 



IX – Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold 

 

182 

 

and 21 days immersion. This value is very similar to the Ca/P molar ratio characteristic of 

stoichiometric HA - 1.67. 

For the glass-ceramic bulk, G31C-84, the OCP layer was only observed at 7 days immersion where 

a Ca/P ratio of 1.32 was detected on the precipitates observed at Fig. IX.3c. Up to 21 days, the 

precipitated layer exhibit a pronounced increase in the Ca and P signal, with a Ca/P ratio of 1.60. 

In the G31C-91, the kinetic deposition rate decreased, since the analysis of the precipitated layer on 

the surface of the glass-ceramic, for 5 months immersion, only detected the presence of a Ca/P ratio 

of 1.57. The presence of higher crystalline phase has a slowdown effect on the in vitro behaviour of 

the glass-ceramics. 

Glass scaffold, after 1 day immersion, present a Ca/P ratio near 1, due to the presence of brushite. 

Between 14 and 21 days the Ca/P ratio increased from 1.62 to 1.67. In the glass-ceramic scaffolds, 

it was detected a Ca/P ratio of 1.54, after 14 days immersion. After 21 days a Ca/P of 1.63 was 

detected. The high surface area of the glass-ceramic scaffolds make possible that the transformation 

of whitlockite into the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate occurs at a reasonably faster rate than 

that on bulk glass-ceramics, since in fact the bioactive reactions only occur at the surface of the bulk 

solid glass-ceramics. For the same reasons, the glass scaffold present higher dissolution rate than the 

bulk glass. For 14 days immersion there is no difference between G31 and GS31 samples, both 

present a Ca/P ~ 1.6.

183 

 

The bulk glass-ceramics G31C-84 and -91, exhibit similar dissolution profiles between them. When 

compared with the bulk glass, G31, calcium and phosphorous ions are released faster from the glass 

bulk, reaching a maximum after 24 hours and then decreases with the development of a Ca-P rich 

layer as confirmed by SEM/EDS and DRX results. On both glass-ceramic bulks Ca ions continue to 

increase in the solution as the other ions.  

The higher dissolution rate of Si and Mg from glass scaffold, compared to G31 can be explained 

by the increase of the surface area.  

The glass-ceramic scaffolds dissolution profile shows no release of phosphorous species from the 

scaffolds, on the contrary, after 14 days immersion, most of the phosphorous was removed from the 

SBF. The same behaviour was observed for the Ca ion except in the first hour. The decrease 

concentration of calcium species, after 1 hour immersion, from 110 to 50 mg.l-1 after 14 days, implies 

that calcium ions deposited on the glass-ceramic surface after 1 h immersion.  

The higher magnesium dissolution observed in Fig. IX. 10, for both glass-ceramic bulk and glass 

scaffold when compared with bulk glass may retard the crystallization of hydroxyapatite by replacing 

calcium in the structure.  

Fig.IX.10. Variation of ionic concentration in SBF due to immersion of the parent glass and 

correspondent glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds. Lines are to guide the eye. 

Fig. IX. 11 represents the variation of pH with soaking time for the glass and glass-ceramic bulk and 

scaffold samples. All testing solutions with exception to the glass-ceramic scaffold GS31C-90, 

showed a decrease in pH after 1 hour immersion. The bulk glass-ceramic G31C-84 showed the largest

184 

 

decrease achieving the pH of 7.3. After that, for all samples, the pH increased rapidly during the 

first 125 h of immersion, slowed up and reached a nearly constant, limiting value above 10 days 

immersion. The glass scaffold showed the same trend, stabilizing earlier, after 7 days immersion, 

with a final pH of 8.2. Subsequently, the pH remained constant over the remaining weeks of 

immersion, reaching a saturated state.  The lowest change in the pH-value was observed for the 

solution containing the GS31C-90 increased from the initial value 7.4 to 7.8 at the end of incubation 

period. The highest change was observed for bulk glass-ceramic G31C-91. 

During soaking in SBF, Mg and Ca cations are leached from the sample surface in exchange for 

H+ ions from the solution (from dissociation of water into H+ and OH?) resulting in an increase of 

the pH-value. The phosphate ions can be exchanged against OH? ions, removing hydroxyl ions from 

solution and providing phosphate ions which buffer the effect of alkali ion release.  

Hence, the higher phosphate concentration in the first hour of G31C-91 immersion results in a 

decrease of pH-value. In the case of GS31C-90 the high calcium and phosphate release promote a 

much lower increase of the pH-value. The similar dissolution profile of Ca and P ions dissolution in 

the bulk G31 promote the slowest increase of the pH value.

G31 and glass-ceramics G31C-84 and G31C-91 and the scaffolds GS31 and GS31C-90. 

Lines are to guide the eye 

Taken together, SEM/EDS and XRD analyses indicate that the glass G31 precipitate HCA after 7 

days immersion. Evaluating the sequence of reactions observed during the formation of the HCA 

layer, it can be noted that the time required for the glass-ceramics bulk G31C-84 was higher than the 

glass bulk and, occurs only after 5 months immersion for G31C-91.  

In comparison with the G31C-84, there was a decrease in the amount of precipitate layer on the 

G31C-91, which can be connected to the decrease in the amount of amorphous phase still present in

the material. The inhibitory effect of crystallization on the in vitro bioactivity of these kind of 

materials, was also observed in other systems [35]. This can be linked to the large amount of Mg 

released from the glass to the solution [38–40]. However, in the current work, it was observed that 

the formation of HCA was delayed, but not hindered. The ability to control the degradability of these 

glasses, by crystallization, makes them potentially clinically helpful for tissue engineering, 

IX.3.2.6. Biocompatibility studies 

Human bone marrow cells, cultured in experimental conditions that favour the osteoblastic 

differentiation [33,34] were seeded over the glass and glass-ceramics bulk (G31, G31C-84 and 

G31C-91) and scaffold (GS31 and GS31C-90) samples for 21 days.  

Fig. IX.12 shows the results for viability/proliferation (a) and the ALP activity (b) observed over the 

materials. For the bulk glass and glass-ceramics, results were compared to those on the standard 

tissue culture plate, and were normalized to the surface area. Compared to the polystyrene culture 

plate, the G31 glass and the glass-ceramic G31C-84 presented higher viability/proliferation values, 

with a statistical significance at days 14 and 21. However, the glass-ceramic G31C-91 showed lower 

values throughout the culture time. Among the bulk samples, values were similar for G31 and G31C-

84 samples, and were significantly higher than those on G31C-91.  

ALP activity was low at day 7 for all samples. At day 14, compared to the polystyrene surface, values 

were significantly higher on G31 and G31C-84 and lower on G31C-91, particularly at day 14. At 

day 21, values were similar in the culture surface, G31 and G31C-84, but they were slightly lower 

on G31C-91. 

Regarding the two tested scaffolds, cell viability/proliferation and ALP activity increased throughout 

the culture time, and the pattern of behavior was similar to that seen on the corresponding bulk 

samples, i.e., values were significantly higher on GS31 compared to that on GS31C-90. Differences 

were higher at day 14 compared to that observed at day 21. ALP is an early osteoblastic marker and 

has a key role in the mineralization of the extracellular matrix, by providing phosphate ions for the 

formation of the calcium phosphate deposits [41].

scaffold GS31C-90), for 21 days.*Significantly different from control 

Samples were observed by SEM at day 21. Fig. IX.13 shows the appearance of the bulk glass and 

glass-ceramics. The surface of the three bulk materials was covered by a cell layer, which was clearly 

thicker on G31 and G31C-84, compared to that on G31C-91. On high magnification images, the three 

bulk surfaces showed elongated cells and a well-organized fibrillar matrix with associated calcium 

phosphate mineral deposits, as shown on the EDS spectrum Fig. IX.13.g and 13.h.  

The matrix mineralization was much lower on the G31C-91 glass-ceramic, compared to that on G31 

and G31C-84.  

Regarding the scaffold samples, cell growth was also observed on GS31 and GS31C-90, although, 

similar to that observed on the bulk samples, GS31C-90 presented lower cellular proliferation. 

However, on both scaffolds, there was evidence of cell growth inside the pores and the cell layer was 

able to successful adapt to the underlying surface. In addition, the presence of calcium phosphate 

deposits closely associated with the cell layer was observed on both scaffolds, Fig. IX.13.i, 

although with higher abundance on GS31.

The higher concentration of magnesium present in the ICP measurements of the G31C-91 due to the 

degradation, may result in a negative effect on cell proliferation. However, literature have shown that 

cytotoxicity in vitro, is not always observed in vivo, since, the effects of ion release under static 

conditions is different from the dynamic body fluid system in which the continuous circulation 

attenuate the local chemical changes, preventing the excessive level of ions at the interface 

cell/material [21,42].

The level of hydroxyapatite crystallisation (surface reactivity), the HCA rate formation and the 

surface characteristics could influence cell adhesion and the subsequent proliferation and 

differentiation events. Also Ca, P and Si ionic concentration during sample incubation with cells, 

could influence osteoblastic differentiation [43].  

The scaffold topography property plays a crucial role not only on the reactivity of the material, but 

also on the ability to trap the new array and facilitate the migration of osteogenic cells and anchoring 

to the surface of the material [5]. When this migration occurs the temporary fibrin matrix will suffer 

contraction and consequently will detach from the surface if it is not well secured to the surface [6], 

as observed in the bulk glass sample G31 and G31C-84. Other studies have shown [6, 7] that 

‘‘rougher’’ surface will be able to imprison the fibrin matrix, better than a smoother one, and hence 

facilitating the migration of osteogenic cells to the materials surface. The bulk and scaffold glass-

ceramics were proven non-cytotoxic and have good cytocompatibility in vitro. The mineralised 

nodule formation is basically considered to be the final result of differentiation and function of the 

osteoblasts. It is interesting that the final ALP activity were equivalent, bearing in mind the 

differences in cell number and proliferation observed for each sample at day 14. This may be due to 

the cellular reaching maximum levels on all surfaces due to overgrowth of cells in each culture prior 

to day 21 of analysis. The formation of this HCA layer was related to the amount of existing residual 

glassy phase since it is a source of ions through the dissolution of this phase.  

IX.4. Conclusion 

The studied glass and glass-ceramic samples presented the ability to induce the precipitation of 

calcium phosphate compounds on its surface, when immersed in synthetic physiological fluids, 

indicating that all are potentially bioactive. Bulk glass samples exhibited, after 7 days, a significant 

precipitate formation on the surface rich in Ca and P, as confirmed by FTIR, SEM-EDS and XRD, 

although, the corresponding glass-ceramics G31C-84 only formed an equivalent layer after 21 days 

incubation. 

The kinetics transition of the whitlockite phase to amorphous in the glass-ceramic scaffold seems to 

be sufficiently fast for application of the material in bone engineering and can be controlled by factors 

such as initial crystallinity and porosity.  

Mg ions concentration in SBF have slow down the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate phase 

and retarded the crystallisation of HCA on the glass surface. 

The comparative study of glass and glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds showed that all presented good 

performance regarding bioactivity and osteoblastic cytocompatibility. The higher surface area of the 

scaffolds attenuated the effect of crystallization observed for bulk glass-ceramics. The cell layer

growing on the materials exhibited high ALP activity and a well-organized mineralized matrix, 

suggesting that these glass and glass-ceramic may have a stimulatory effect on bone formation in 

vivo. These considerations, suggest the possibility of performing heat treatments, in order to obtain 

scaffolds with slower degradation. It is possible to control and tune the bioactivity and 

biocompatability by means of a controlled crystallization according to the requirements of the 

application.

CHAPTER X 

SURFACE MODIFICATION OF SI-CA-P-MG GLASS-CERAMIC: A 

BIOACTIVITY STUDY 

 

Abstract 

When the surface properties required for a glass-ceramic are different from those which are intrinsic 

of the material these can be modified. Indeed, the variation in chemical functional groups is known 

to affect hydrophobicity, which in turn affects protein adsorption and conformation, subsequently 

affecting various cellular responses. Different activation methods have been applied to a glass-

ceramic G31C-91, where whitlockite was the crystalline phase detected, with a crystallinity percent 

of 82 %, in order to expose hydroxyl groups. The formation of silanols on the surface of the activated 

glass-ceramic, with acid, basic or neutral aqueous media, was investigated. The cleaned glass-

ceramics were then functionalized using 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES).  

The acetone pre-treated (G31C-91-1) and further silanized (G31C-91-1S) glass-ceramic surfaces 

presented the highest contact angle indicating that the acetone pre-treated glass-ceramic surface was 

more hydrophobic and that APTES immobilization was successful. The recover bioactivity of the 

acetone treatment before and after silanization, compared with the “as-prepared” glass-ceramic 

bioactivity, was investigated using simulated body fluid (SBF) tests up to 21 days. The post-soaking 

samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy 

(EDS) and FTIR. Both glass-ceramic surfaces exhibited an accelerated crystalline hydroxyapatite 

layer formation upon immersion in SBF after 21 days while the “as-prepared” glass-ceramic G31C-

91 had no detected formation of calcium phosphate up to 5 months.

X.1. Introduction 

Bioactive glasses have the characteristic of bonding to bone provided by the formation of a 

biologically active apatite layer due to the rapid rate of surface reactions. In the last decades, 

increasing effort has been directed toward potential applications of glass-ceramics and to understand 

if this is a common characteristic to bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics [1–4]. It was demonstrated 

in a previous work [5] that when the bioactive glass (mol. %) 32.7% CaO, 10.9% P2O5, 25.4% SiO2 

and 31% MgO was transformed into a glass-ceramic, the formation of the surface apatite layer 

depended on the relative amount of residual glassy phase in the glass-ceramic. The glass-ceramic 

with 18 % of residual glassy phase exhibited no formation of a surface HCA layer, when exposed to 

SBF solutions, during thirty days. Only after 5 months immersion it was formed a large plate of 

calcium phosphate. It was observed that the high concentration of Mg ions in SBF, slow down the 

formation of amorphous calcium phosphate phase (?-CaP) and greatly retarded the crystallisation of 

HCA on the glass surface, as also observed in literature [6,7]. Although some authors underline the 

inhibitory effect on bioactivity due to crystallization [1], most of the findings agree that crystal phase 

slightly decreases the kinetics of HCA layer formation on the implant surface [8], but there is no loss 

in bioactivity, even with crystallinity up to 100 % [9]. The reaction rate observed in the 45S5 glass-

ceramic was found to be up to seven times faster than that reported for A/W glass-ceramics with 

respect to the formation of crystalline HCA [9]. Even if the kinetics of apatite formation is slower, 

the preserved bioactivity of the derived glass-ceramics offers new interesting opportunities, since 

crystallized systems are mechanically more reliable than the original parent glass [10]. Moreover, 

the reaction rate of the biomedical device can be adjusted by surface modification [11,12]. 

For the aforementioned reasons, it is important to investigate the proper cleaning methods for the 

activation of a bioactive surface on the G31C-91 glass-ceramic before silanization.  

Glass-ceramic surfaces can then be silanized, as they contain hydroxyl groups which attack and 

displace the alkoxy groups on the silane thus forming a covalent Si – O – Si bond [13]. Silanization 

through 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) has been used as a process for modification of the 

surface, by forming a monolayer of aminosilane for further bio-functionalization [2]. The active 

amino groups (–NH2) facilitate the further functionalization and can covalently bond with other 

active groups, such as the carboxyl (–COOH) that can conveniently conjugate with enzyme.

X.2. Materials and methods 

X.2.1. Glass fabrication 

Glass with molar composition 32.7 % CaO, 10.9 % P2O5, 25.4 % SiO2 and 31 % MgO (mol. %) was 

produced by conventional melt quenching technique, as reported elsewhere [14–16]. The obtained 

bulk was annealed for 30 minutes at 740 ºC. Slices samples were prepared with dimensions of 1 x 1 

x 0.5 cm3 polished with sandpaper grain size successively thinner, finished with diamond pastes of 

15, 6, 3 and 1µm particle size.  

The samples were further heat treated to obtain glass ceramics with 82 % crystallized fraction. Glass-

ceramic samples were denominated G31C-91 or “as-prepared” glass-ceramics. After heat treatment 

the samples were polished with diamond pastes of 15, 6, 3 and 1µm particle size.  

X.2.2. Glass-ceramic surface hydroxyls exposition 

The first step of functionalization process is a cleaning treatment able to promote both the surface 

removal of contaminants and the exposition of reactive hydroxyls. The polished slices have been 

cleaned by the following three different methods: 

1) Sonification for 5 min in a solution of acetone in H2O (95 vol. %) in order to remove surface 

contaminants and subsequently 3 times for 5 min in distilled water in order to expose reactive 

groups. The samples subjected to this treatment were designated G31C-91-1.  

        

2)  The same procedure as in point 1, followed by further soaking for 1 min in acid solution 

H2SO4 at pH = 4 followed by rinsing in distilled water (three times for 5 min each in 

ultrasonication apparatus). These samples were designated G31C-91-2. 

 

3) The same procedure as in point 1, followed by further soaking for 3 min in basic solution 

NaOH 0.1M followed by rinsing in distilled water (three times for 5 min each in 

ultrasonication apparatus). These samples were designated G31C-91-3. 

The three methods have been adapted from those described in the literature [17–19] and have been 

compared with each other to assess their efficiency in the activation of bioactive glass-ceramic 

surfaces.

199 

 

X.2.3. Surface silanization 

After cleaning, all samples (G31C-91-1, -2 and -3) have been silanized with APTES following two 

protocols reported in the literature, depending on the previous cleaning method. 

 

1S) After cleaning with acetone, the slices were soaked for 6 h in an ethanol solution (95 

vol. %) containing 35 µL of APTES. After soaking, samples was rinsed in ethanol, thermally 

treated at 100 ºC for 1 h, to consolidate the bonding between the silane and the glass surface, 

and stored in a dry box. (G31C-91-1S)  

 

2S) After cleaning with H2SO4 or NaOH, the silanization was carried out by soaking the 

samples for 3 min in 102 mL of ethanol solution containing 3 mL of APTES. After soaking, 

each sample was rinsed in ethanol, thermally treated at 100 ºC for 1 h, and stored in a dry 

box. The samples were designated G31C-91-2S and G31C-91-3S, for glass-ceramic surfaces 

pre-cleaned with H2SO4 and NaOH, respectively. 

X.2.4. Characterization of surface modification 

The activated and functionalized glass-ceramic surfaces were investigated using Attenuated Total 

Reflection (ATR) spectroscopy on a Brucker tensor 27 spectrometer, using a Golden Gate single 

reflection diamond ATR system, with no need for sample preparation. All spectra were collected 

over a region of 4000–400 cm?1 with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1.  

The influence of surface modification and functionalization on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic 

behaviour of glass slice was estimated via static contact angle measurements with distilled water at 

room temperature using the sessile drop method, where the angle was determined from the tangent 

made to the drop curvature at the base, through image analysis of the drop profile. All the 

measurements have been performed on the mirror polished glass-ceramic slice surfaces, before and 

after each cleaning step, and after silanization. The instrument, using a charge coupled device (CCD) 

camera and an image analysis software, was purchased from DataPhysics OCA - Series. The 

distilled water (Milli-Q, Integral; Millipore, USA) droplet volume was 1 ?L, and the contact angle 

was measured 5 s after the drop deposition on the sample surface. The measures were performed on 

each glass-ceramics samples in triplicates always using fresh surfaces. For each slice sample, the 

reported value is the average of the results obtained on three droplets.

X.2.5. In vitro bioactivity  

The in vitro bioactivity was assessed by soaking all samples in a solution of simulated body fluid 

(SBF) for periods from 1 day up to 21 days prepared according to the formulation of Kokubo and 

Takadama [17]. It was used a constant specimen surface area to solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1, 

previously filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. The samples were placed in a polyethylene 

bottle containing SBF solution, and kept in an incubator at 37 ºC, without shaking, in accordance to 

a protocol referred in the literature [18–21]. Four samples were used for each immersion time. After 

removal from the SBF, the samples were dried at 60 ºC. SEM and XRD were used to analyze the 

structure of the reacted samples, using the conditions described previously. Energy dispersive X-ray 

spectroscopy (EDS) was utilized to analyze the elemental composition of the converted layer on the 

surface of the samples immersed in SBF at different time intervals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis 

was performed using a Rigaku Diffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? 

radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02º s-1. Data was obtained in the 2? range of 

10-60 degree to investigate the crystalline phases of the grinded samples.

range between 4000 – 1400 cm-1 was chosen because it contains most important peaks of –CH 

stretching and functional groups without overlapping with glass characteristic peaks Si – O – Si. 

The FTIR spectra of the “as prepared” glass-ceramic G31C-91 reveals at around 3500 cm-1, the 

absorption band of the ?OH bonds and the combination of the Si – O – Si stretch (asymmetric) at 

1200?970 cm-1 band, Si ? O stretch band at 940?860 cm-1 and the bending Si – O – Si at 500 ? 400 

cm-1 [20]. The FTIR also show the additional bands at wavenumbers 560 and 601 cm-1 a peak at 1060 

cm?1 correspondent to the P–O bending  and symmetric stretch vibrations, respectively, due to the 

presence of whitlockite [21].  

With cleaning treatments the bands assigned to P ? O stretching asymmetric decrease intensity. The 

new Si – O band at ~ 930 cm?1 (with two non-bridging oxygen) was detected in the samples G31C-

91-1 and -2.  

The cleaned samples G31C-91-1 and G31C-91-2 showed increased transmittance bands of the 

vibrational modes due to Si ? O stretch, showing an enrichment in Si – OH bonds, as proposed.

For silane-modified glass-ceramic surfaces Fig. X.1b, in the FTIR range between 4000 – 1400 cm-1, 

no differences were found in the G31C-91-2S and -3S samples. In the same range, APTES gave to 

G31C-91-1 new peaks at ~ 3451 cm
?1 due to ?NH stretching [24,25]. It can also be observed the 

presence of the antisymmetric and symmetric ?CH2 stretching vibration bands 2930 and 2860 cm
?1, 

respectively, mainly related to the presence of propyl chain added with APTES on the glass-ceramic

surfaces [26,27]. The vibration at 1484 and 1635 cm?1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric 

?NH3
+ deformation modes, indicative of amine group protonation when the samples were exposed 

to air. In addition to these modes, NH2 scissor vibration found at 1570 cm
?1 confirms the presence of 

the terminal groups of the APTES molecules after grafting [26]. Remain spectra, between 1400 and 

400 cm-1, Fig. X.1b, include a positive contribution in the spectral range at 1008?1070 cm-1 due to 

extra Si – O – Si modes correspondent to the presence of siloxane on the surface of G31C-91-1. 

These stretching modes confirm the adsorption of the silane on the modified acetone surface G31C-

91-1.

The micrographs of the glass-ceramics before and after the different modifications treatments are 

present in Fig. X.2. With the cleaning treatment, it is observed that the glass matrix dissolves leaving 

the crystalline particles exposed on the surface, as seen in Figs. X.2b, 2c and 2d. The treatments with 

acidic or basic solutions caused a very strong dissolution of the glass matrix.

The silanization performed on the three different glass surfaces previously cleaned did not modify 

significantly the surface of the glass.

X.3.2. Surface characterization-contact angle analysis 

The contact angle characterization has been used for accessing the presence of –OH on the glass-

ceramic surfaces as a result of their chemical modifications, Fig. X.3.  

The contact angle measurements results as a function of the chemical groups added to the surfaces 

are summarized in Table X.3. All washing treatments produced a decrease of the contact angle when 

compared with the as-prepared glass-ceramic slices. The first method (acetone) was more effective 

than the others with a contact angle bellow 8º, a significant difference when compared with the 

reference “as-prepared G31C-91”. As expected, the washing step induced a higher hydrophilicity of 

the glass-ceramic surface, with respect to the as-prepared one, because of the ?OH groups presence, 

whereas silanization enhances its hydrophobicity, due to the configuration of the silane at the surface 

which is assumed to bend and orient its polar NH2 head toward the surface, driven by the formation 

of strong hydrogen bonds with the glass hydroxyl groups. This configuration leaves the ethylene

sequences exposed at the surface, thus providing the assessed hydrophobic character, coherent with 

the literature dealing with alkyl silane modifiers for glass and glass-ceramic surfaces [28–31].

 Based on the results, the relative hydrophobicity increased in the following sequence of chemical 

groups: hydroxyls &amp;lt;“as-prepared G31C-91” &amp;lt;amines. Surface activation and contamination 

removal by acetone pre-treatment method revealed the best results, where surfaces were free of 

hydrophobic contaminants with low contact angles ranging from 4° to 8°, producing a very 

hydrophilic surface with low water contact angles, prone to silanization. The surface of silanized 

glass should be much more hydrophobic than that of the pre-treated glass. In the present study, the 

acetone pre-treated silanized glass surface presented the highest contact angle indicating that 

silanized glass was more hydrophobic and that APTES immobilization on the silanized glass was 

successful. Glass surfaces cleaned using H2SO4 and NaOH method, had a mean contact angle value 

after silanization significantly lower than those from acetone method, indicating poor silanization, 

confirming the FTIR results.

The role of the different cleaning media on the surface modification of the glasses can be understood 

by the capability of the glass to be leached when in contact with an aqueous medium, by the breaking 

of an oxygen bridge and the forming of two terminal –OH.  

The first washing method should be able to activate hydroxyls on the glass-ceramic surface. An acid 

environment (method 2) can be more effective on the ion exchange step. A basic environment 

(method 3) could promote the hydroxylation of the glasses through the catalytic effect of ? OH ions 

in the solution. This action probably induced poor hydroxyls exposition reducing silanization as 

observed in Fig. X.1. 

The silane attachment on glass-ceramic surfaces requires the presence of hydroxyl groups for 

attachment of the molecules. The ?OH on the surface can react with APTES as the process shown in 

Fig. X.4b. The silane molecule was first hydrolysed to form reactive silanol groups that further 

condense with surface hydroxyl groups to form Si – O – Si bonds or with other hydrolysed silane 

molecule to form Si – O – Si cross-linking.  

The three hydrolysable ethoxy groups of the APTES, allows for multiple points of surface attachment 

and polymerization with APTES molecules in both horizontal and vertical directions. 

The pre-cleaning with acetone surface produces significant improvements in the APTES coating. It 

has been reported that the thicker the water layer at silicon oxide surfaces, the more significant the 

growth of silane at the surface and also the most stable the silane layer can be [27].

APTES on a silica substrate [32] 

The acetone treatment G31C-9-1 seems to be the best treatment for surface functionalization and 

further bioactivity evaluation. The stability and structural alteration of the APTES upon exposure to 

SBF was monitored using FTIR, since other studies shown that the silane layer was not stable in 

buffered solutions [35].

X.3.3.  Bioactivity studies 

The samples submitted to acetone and the correspondent silanization were used for further bioactivity 

and stability studies following the protocol reported by Kokubo [33].  

After 1 day immersion in SBF, the FTIR analysis, Fig. X.5, shows the decrease of the intensity 

vibration bands of  Si – O – Si (stretch and bending),when compared with the G31C-91-1 in Fig. X.1. 

The vibration peaks of the P ? O stretch at 1030 and P?O bend mode at 560 and 600 cm-1 increased 

intensity. The bands at 1090 cm-1  assigned to the Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching mode and the band 

at 476 cm-1 assigned to the Si – O – Si symmetric bending mode tends to decrease it’s intensity with 

HCA phase formation.  

For 14 days soaking, the peaks correspondent to the Si ? O groups, present in the G31C-91-1.1D, 

disappeared with the repolymerization process. Two peaks at 1450 and 1410 cm-1 and a third at 870 

cm-1 increased intensity, due to the incorporation of CO2 from the solution, during the crystallization 

of HCA.   

The increased definition of the peaks related to PO vibrations, P ? O bend (560 and 602 cm-1) and 

the apperence of a P ? O stretch (1050 cm-1) and of a P ? O bending peak at 460 cm-1 was indicative 

of an increase in the crystallinity of the precipitated HCA layer [34] for 14 days immersion while in 

the as-prepared glass-ceramic HCA was only detected after 30 days [5]. 

Therefore, it can be stated that the developed procedure for altering the surface properties based on 

chemically changing the surface of glass-ceramic G31C-91 was effective. 

The vibration modes related with absorbed silane molecules like CH3, CH2 and NH2 were barely 

observed at the first 24 hours but increased intensity after 14 days. The peak at 730 cm-1 could be 

assigned to –NH vibration. The corresponding stretching mode of NH at ~3400 cm-1 was too weak 

to be discernible in the spectra. The stability of aminosilane layer in SBF was observed.

The XRD spectra for all investigated samples are shown in Fig. X.6. The ‘‘as-prepared’’ spectra 

represent the results for crystalline sample. Before immersion in SBF, all samples (with and without 

surface modification) exhibited sharp diffraction peaks, which were identified as diffractions of the 

whitlockite phase ((Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2 according to the card No. 01-087-1582 in the X’Pert 

HighScore database).  

After 7 days immersion in SBF, the as prepared G31C-91 with an IC of 82 % had no detected 

formation of calcium phosphate (Fig. X.6a) showing only a reduction in crystallinity. After 30 days  

in SBF, the sharp diffraction peaks of whitlockite crystalline phase are overlapped by a broad halo, 

consequence of the presence of an amorphous phase, and some incipient peaks of HA were detected. 

The same process was observed in the surface modified samples with a remarkably faster process 

(Fig. X.6b and 6c) than in the as-prepared samples (Fig. X.6a). XRD analysis confirmed that the 

overlapped of the whitlockite by an amorphous phase was accelerated to 3 days (in surface-modified 

samples), and that after 3 weeks, HA peaks are identified in the surface modified samples. The XRD 

spectra suggest that hydroxyapatite did not detach from the glass-ceramic surfaces after prolonged 

soaking times. The surface treatment played a critical role in the acceleration of the reaction.

The microstructural evolution, upon immersion in SBF, of the as prepared glass-ceramic and 

modified surfaces with acetone and after silanization is illustrated in Fig. X.7. 

After soaking in SBF for 1 day, it is clear a faster dissolution of the glass phase in the modified 

G31C-91-1compared with the as-prepared sample G31C-91. 

After 3 weeks, HA-like bulbs were precipitated on the surface of the modified surface (in a ratio 

close to 1.67) in which the crystalline phase was not clear due to an amorphous glass matrix that 

embedded the surface, in agreement with the results of XRD analysis (Fig. X.6b and 6c).  

 

 
Fig. X.7. Surface microstructure of the as prepared glass-ceramic G31C-91 (a, b), acetone 

G31C-91-1 (c, d), and acetone + silane G31C-91-1S (e, f) samples after immersion in 

SBF for 1 day (a, c and e) and 3 weeks (b, d and f) 

The surface modification plays a key role in speeding up the formation of HCA layer. The reasons 

for this behaviour are the faster dissolution of the glass phase compared with the as prepared sample. 

In the acetone treated surface without APTES (Fig. X.7c), the glass matrix dissolves faster, such that 

the crystalline particles are exposed on the surface. When modified with APTES (Fig. X.7e), the 

surface is covered by a layer of APTES molecules, which reduces the dissolution rates of the glass 

matrix.  

Preferential dissolution is observed in the gaps between the glass matrix and crystalline particles. 

This narrow interstices seems to be attack by the SBF solution, forming cavities indorsing the 

whitlockite crystals to detached from the matrix, leaving pores (Fig. X.7a, 7c) in the glass matrix.  

As confirmed by XRD, the establishment of the HA is not observed in the 3 weeks immersion in 

SBF of the as-prepared glass-ceramic, G31C-91. However, in the acetone-treated and silane surface-

modified samples, the HA formed at almost the same rate, since silanization does not significantly 

alter material reactivity.

The stability of aminosilane, with a dense surface free amine functional group, is crucial for tissue 

engineering applications. Currently, APTES is the most widely used aminosaline in the field but it 

can self-polymerize in humid environments and result in a heterogeneous surface [31,35]. 

Interestingly, our FTIR analysis did not confirmed this result on the surface of the glass-ceramics 

using the acetone cleaning treatment. 

X.4. Conclusion 

Surface modification of the Si-Ca-P-Mg based glass-ceramic monolithic was carried out by different 

cleaning methods and further chemical functionalization by reaction with the APTES.  The washing 

treatment is necessary to induce surface activation by free ?OH exposition. The results of this study 

indicate that the acetone treatment during the surface-modification process must be considered in the 

glass–ceramic bioactivity improvement. Both acetone aqueous treatment and APTES molecules 

surface-functionalization process expedites the subsequent bioreaction of the glass-ceramics in SBF 

and must be considered in the design of glass-ceramic scaffolds with tailored bioactivity and 

biodegradability. The surface-functionalized samples are ready for protein immobilization and can 

be used to fabricate glass-ceramic scaffolds for protein release studies.

CHAPTER XI 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS &amp;amp; FINAL REMARKS 

 

XI.1. General Conclusions 

The main goal of the present thesis was to investigate the fabrication, mechanical properties and 

in vitro performance of bioactive glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds from compositions of the Si?

Ca?P?Na?Mg system using the salt sintering process for applications in bone regeneration. 

The sintering behavior of the base 3CaO.P2O5-MgO-SiO2 system glass was investigated. The 

glass powder compacts can be densified through viscous sintering, without the present of 

crystalline phases. Near full densification was reached by a small decrease of the glass particle 

size from 6.8 ?m to 3.5 ?m, decreasing the degree of particle orientation and shrinkage anisotropy. 

In the initial stage of the densification the activation energies of sintering, Es, were comparable 

for both particle size distributions.  

A complex crystallization process was observed in the same glass system, with associated 

activation energies reflecting the change of behaviour during in-situ crystal precipitation. 

Whitlockite, forsterite and enstatite were the crystalline phases forming on heat treating the glass. 

It was found that the crystallization process was affected by the fraction of crystallization (x), 

giving rise to decreasing activation energy values, Ec(x), with the increase of x, for the first 

crystalline phase whitlockite. As the crystallization proceeds, and thus the crystallized fraction 

increases, the Avrami exponent increased, corresponding to a crystallization with one-

dimensional growth associated to a bulk nucleation of the whitlockite phase, in agreement with 

the long needles observed by SEM. 

During the scaffold processing a reaction involving the glass network and the alkaline salt was 

proposed, in which, a structural disruption of the glass surfaces takes place, with formation of 

chlorine gas that causes an expansion phenomenon responsible for the increase of the SSA by the 

wrinkling of the surfaces and the creation of preferential crystallization sites at the surface. This 

phenomenon of salt–glass reaction is of high technological interest for the production of glass 

based scaffolds for many purposes including bone related biomedical applications where the 

exceptional surface area available after sintering can provide a high contact surface with the 

surrounding biological system.

The base glass composition in the 3.CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO system was changed by Na2O 

addition, aiming to obtain glass melts of controlled viscosity and workability to enlarge the 

“working window” for sintering. A small addition of Na2O to the 3.CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO 

system was crucial to enhance the densification behaviour and mechanical strength. The partial 

replacement of MgO by Na2O enhanced the trend towards depolymerisation, reflected by an 

increase in Q2 at the expense of Q3 and Q4 units, as supported by MAS-NMR spectra. The selected 

glass systems allow variation of properties, such as degradation tendency through minor chemical 

adjustments and adequate heat treatments. 

The mechanical reliability of bioactive glass scaffolds remain as limiting factors for applications 

in loaded bone repair. The crystallization was proposed for improving the toughness of bioactive 

glass scaffolds. Besides the study of the scaffold processing, the understanding of the effect of 

crystallization on the mechanical behaviour and surface reactivity in acellular medium and in cell 

cultures allowed assessing the best compromise in the fabricated scaffolds. The crystallization of 

glass improved the mechanical properties of the obtained glass-ceramics scaffolds but it 

compromised their surface chemical reactivity hindering bioactivity, especially on bulk samples. 

To counterbalance this drawback, surface functionalization of the glass-ceramics appears as a 

promising solution. Only after 3 weeks, crystalline hydroxyapatite peaks were identified in the 

surface of glass-ceramic modified samples while the as prepared glass-ceramic had no detected 

formation of hydroxiapatite up to 5 months. 

This possibility seems to be of major importance not only for the manufacturing of implant 

materials with resorption rates matching the growth rates of bone, but also for satisfying results 

in cell experiments and tissue engineering having in mind that the optimization of the degradation 

rate facilitates cell proliferation and improved biocompatibility. 

XI.2. Directions for Future Research 

For bone regeneration, the biggest challenge is to fabricate scaffolds with suitable mechanical 

properties capable of load transmission, induction of vascularisation and tailored degradability. 

Future research is needed to broaden the choice of glass compositions, thermal treatments and 

porogen so that scaffolds can be tailored to distinctive applications. 

Furthermore, another desirable modification to these scaffolds is the incorporation of bioactive 

substances, like growth factors. However, once these scaffolds undergo fast degradation rates we 

believed that a significant higher kinetic release of the growth factors will be generated. Therefore 

it seems essential to develop the adequate techniques to retain an appropriated amount of the 

incorporated factors for a later release.

A focus of future work should be the creation of strong and tough bioactive glass-ceramic 

scaffolds and their evaluation in loaded and non-loaded bone defect sites in animal models. 

Moreover, the application of surface modification and use of protein adsorption provide a scope 

of tailoring the scaffold biocompatibility. 

Based on the biodegradable and biocompatibility results there would be room for simulating the 

degradation and resorption kinetic of the process and based on these factors, to manufacture 

scaffolds which could fulfil the desired function properly.
