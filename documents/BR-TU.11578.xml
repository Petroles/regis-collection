ABSTRACT. The Araneidae is a speciose family including web-spinning spiders that are very abundant in various terrestrial ecosystems. Several 
studies demonstrate that changes in vegetation surrounding rivers, streams and brooks affect the associated araneofauna. The aim of this research 
was to compare differences found in diversity (abundance and richness), composition and phenology of Araneidae spiders sampled in different 
habitats in four riparian forest catchments in southern Brazil. Samples were taken from riparian forests in four rivers of Rio Grande do Sul State: 
Piratini, Camaquã, Sinos and Maquiné rivers, each in a different hydrographic basin. Samples were taken twice seasonally on each basin during two 
years, sampling the araneofauna of the tree-shrub strata with beating tray. Six transects were employed on each basin, two per habitat: edge with 
grassland, forest interior and river edge. Araneids totalled 20 genera and 65 species. Comparing riparian forests significant differences are found. 
Spider abundance differed among riparian forests as well as species richness. Overall, Piratini river riparian forest had the higher abundance and 
richness for Araneidae; the lower values were in Sinos river forest. The stronger degradation and fragmentation of the riparian forests of Sinos river 
probably influenced the results, with human disturbance gradients associated negatively to web building. We present data on the diversity of these 
spiders, which were very abundant in the riparian forest interior and very rich in species in the grassland/riparian forest edge. Species composition 
also differs among the studied habitats (the above plus river/riparian forest edge). For the most abundant species the phenological pattern across 
the seasons was also analysed.

KEYWORDS. Spiders, habitats, Rio Grande do Sul, abundance, richness.

RESUMO. Diversidade, composição e fenologia de aranhas construtoras de teias (Araneae, Araneidae) associadas com matas ciliares no sul 
do Brasil. Araneidae é uma das famílias com maior número de espécies, incluindo aranhas construtoras de teias que são muito abundantes em diversos 
ecossistemas terrestres. Vários estudos demonstram que mudanças na vegetação circundante de rios, córregos e riachos pode afetar a araneofauna 
associada. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar aspectos sobre a diversidade (abundância e riqueza), composição e fenologia de aranhas Araneidae 
foram amostradas em diferentes habitats em quatro bacias de mata ciliar no sul do Brasil. Foram coletadas amostras de matas ciliares em quatro rios 
do Rio Grande do Sul, todos em diferentes bacias hidrográficas: nos rios Piratini, Camaquã, dos Sinos e Maquiné. As amostras foram realizadas 
duas vezes por estação em cada bacia, durante dois anos, a amostragem da araneofauna do estrato arbóreo-arbustivo foi realizada com guarda-
chuva entomológico. Seis transecções foram empregadas em cada mata ciliar, dois por habitat: borda com campo, interior da floresta e borda do rio. 
Araneídeos totalizaram 20 gêneros e 65 espécies. Comparando-se as matas ciliares houve diferenças significativas. A abundância de aranhas diferiu 
entre as matas ciliares, bem como a riqueza de espécies. No geral, a mata ciliar do rio Piratini teve a maior abundância e riqueza para Araneidae; os 
menores valores foram no rio dos Sinos. A degradação e fragmentação da mata ciliar do rio dos Sinos, provavelmente influenciaram nos resultados, 
a partir da perturbação humana agindo de forma negativa nas aranhas da família Araneidae. Apresentamos dados sobre a diversidade destas aranhas, 
que foram muito abundantes no interior da mata ciliar e muito ricas em espécies na borda da mata com o campo. A composição de espécies também 
difere entre os habitats estudados. Para as espécies mais abundantes, o padrão fenológico em todas as estações do ano também foi analisado.

PALAVRAS-CHAVE. Aranhas, habitats, Rio Grande do Sul, abundância, riqueza.

Riparian forests are key elements in the landscape, 
being one of the few to remain, although quite altered, 
after agroecosystem “development” in many different 
environments. Riparian forests have an important function 
as corridors, potentially helping araneofauna dispersal 
between distant areas (RaizeR et al., 2005). Nevertheless, 
the spider fauna of this ecosystem remains poorly known, 
and few inventories and ecological researches have been 
developed there (for an exception, see RodRigues &amp;amp; 
Mendonça, 2012; RodRigues et al., 2014).

Riparian forests are good corridors also because they 
are usually relatively narrow strips accompanying rivers 
(HaRpeR et al., 2007), and have been further reduced in 
their extension by human impacts. Thus, they are especially 
amenable to edge effects (MuRcia, 1995), and this could 
impact the spider fauna in different ways. For example, 

pioneer plants occupying edges, along with changed abiotic 
factors, could help augment insect herbivore activity 
on forest edges, which could positively impact spiders 
(WiRtH et al., 2008). On the other hand, plant structure 
(RodRigues et al., 2014) and species richness (BaldisseRa 
et al., 2004) is essential to web building spiders and thus 
would generate an expectation for more abundant and 
richer spider assemblages on the forest interior.

The family Araneidae is the third in number of 
genera and species globally (WoRld spideR catalog, 2015), 
including ecribellate, entelegyne, three-clawed spiders, 
having eight eyes in two rows. They are also notable for 
building orb webs (levi, 2002), which renders them easy to 
sample since they can be viewed and collected from webs, 
and puts them into a single functional hunting guild among 
spiders. They have a relatively large size and are colourful,

being thus interesting ecologically and evolutionarily in 
terms of the value associated to these colours. They are 
quite well known taxonomically in the Holartic Region, and 
not surprisingly the Neotropical araneids are still largely 
undescribed and unknown.

Spiders in this family are generally among the most 
abundant and speciose of those sampled from the tree-
shrub plant strata in faunal inventories in southern Brazil, 
even from distinct ecosystems (indRusiak &amp;amp; kotzian, 
1998; BaldisseRa et al., 2004; RodRigues, 2005; silva 
&amp;amp; aRaujo, 2005; Bonaldo et al., 2007; podgaiski et al., 
2007; BaldisseRa et al., 2008; RodRigues et al., 2014). A 
species list was presented by indRusiak &amp;amp; Buss (2003) for 
the central region of Rio Grande do Sul State, and in the 
list of spiders species of Rio Grande do Sul State (Buckup 
et al., 2010) cite Araneidae as the family with the highest 
number of species to the State (210  species).

Araneidae is one of the few spider families of the 
Neotropical Region with a relatively well-known taxonomy. 
The available lists already paint a general picture of this 
fauna in the region, allowing comparisons not available 
for other spiders and even for other invertebrate groups. 
However, few species have ecological patterns known, 
such as occurrences and abundance in distinct habitats, 
phenology and so forth, Thus, the aim of this study was 
to evaluate aspects of diversity (abundance and richness), 
composition and phenology of Araneidae spiders species 
sampled from different habitats in four riparian forest 
catchments in southern Brazil. How environmental 
differences influence araneid spiders was also evaluated. 
Our expectations are that different araneid spider abundance 
and richness will be found on rivers to the north, within 
the Atlantic forest biome, given simply the latitudinal 
differences between this and the Pampa biome, to the 
south. Under the biological edge hypothesis, river edges 
and grassland/pasture edges are expected to differ in their 
effect on araneid spider diversity and different composition, 
given the distinct nature of these edges.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Samples were taken from riparian forests in four 
rivers of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, each in a different 
hydrographic basin. 

In Piratini river sampling points were in the 
lower course, Arroio Grande municipality, southern 
part of the Coastal Plain macroregion (31°54’06.47”S; 
52°39’08.29”W). The sampled sector is approximately 
14 m a.s.l. and is 39 km long in the fluvial valley, with a 
forest area of 4,000 ha, representing the largest continuous 
native riparian forest segment still extant in the southern 
half of the Coastal Plain.

In Camaquã river the left margin of the lower 
course was chosen, in Cristal municipality (31°01’01.7”S; 
51°56’42.0”W), centre-south part of the Coastal Plain. It is 
also approximately 14 m a.s.l. This area is well preserved, 
with continuous forest over the plains. This place is affected 

by natural intermittent flooding with few indications of 
anthropic disturbance.

The riparian forest of Sinos river is in Parobé 
municipality on the right river margin (29°41’06.94”S; 
50°51’05.98”W), between 6–10 m a.s.l. The forest is not 
continuous, with fragmentation along the river, but the 
chosen sampling sector includes a fraction of forest still 
in good condition. The forest on the right margin is taller, 
but with flooding plains, swamps and pastures nearby. 
On the other margin the forest was partially cut and the 
local people use the area for sunbathing and swimming 
(daniel, 1991).

The sampled sector of the riparian forest along 
Maquiné river is also reduced to a fragment, in Maquiné 
municipality (29°40’47.99”S; 50°11’20.03”W). With 
an approximate area of 622 km2, it is an enclave in the 
slopes of the highlands. This region is in the Atlantic Forest 
Biosphere Reserve as recognised by UNESCO, included 
in the Serra Geral Biological Reserve. It is considered of 
extreme importance to the conservation of the Brazilian 
Atlantic forest (conseRvation inteRnational do BRasil et 
al., 2000), because of its biodiversity and risk of anthropic 
change.

Field trips occurred during two years (01.
August.2007-06.June.2009), with two sampling dates per 
season (spring, summer, autumn, winter) on each river, 
totalling eight samples per year, and 64 samples overall. 
Six transects (approximately 30 m each) were set up in 
each river basin. Therefore, there were two transects per 
habitat per area. Each transect was a straight line 4 m wide. 
Three habitats were contemplated: the forest-river edge (as 
close to the border between forest and river as possible, 
RE); the forest interior (FI) and the forest-grassland edge 
(along the border between forest and adjacent vegetation, 
usually grassland but occasionally fallow land close to 
agriculture areas, GE). Spiders on the shrub-tree strata 
were collected with a beating tray (70 cm x 70 cm) on 
each transect during 45 min. Overall, 24 transects were 
sampled per field trip across all rivers; 288 h of sampling 
were completed for the whole period.

Spiders were identified in the Laboratório de 
Aracnologia and deposited in the spider collection of 
Museu de Ciências Naturais of Fundação Zoobotânica do 
Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil (curator: R. Ott).

Analytical species richness estimator Jackknife1 
was calculated to verify sampling sufficiency, as suggested 
by toti et al. (2000). For this we used EstimateS 8.0 
(colWell, 2005) with 500 randomisations. To test for 
conjunct differences in sample species richness and 
abundance among riparian forests (rivers) and habitats 
(edges and forest) a two-way MANOVA (with Pillai’s 
Trace statistic) was employed (calculated with SPSS® 13.0). 
To illustrate spider species composition comparisons two 
ordinations were plotted (Non-metric MultiDimensional 
Scaling – nMDS), one using a qualitative similarity index 
(Simpson) and another a quantitative one (Bray-Curtis). 
To test for statistical differences among spider assemblage

composition for the above similarity indexes, we applied 
two one-way ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) with 
Bonferroni correction, one for each factor (habitat and river) 
(claRke &amp;amp; WaRWick, 1994). Phenograms were built for 
species with more than 10 individuals sampled, except for 
Eustala (a genus currently being revised, Maria Rita Poeta, 
MCTP, pers. comm.), to illustrate patterns of distribution 
in time across the two years of sampling.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Of a total 42,057 spiders sampled (adults and 
juveniles) in this riparian forest for Rio Grande do Sul 
State, 5,020 belonged to Araneidae (533 adults and 4,489 
juveniles), the third most abundant family. More females 
(360) than males (173, sex ratio 1:0.48) were captured. 

Twenty genera and 65 species were found (Tab. I), 
among rare species 25 were singletons (more than 38%) 

and seven were doubletons (10.8%). Similar work with the 
same method varied in this percentage of rare species for 
the family, silva &amp;amp; aRaújo (2005) found high values (82% 
singletons), but indRusiak &amp;amp; Buss (1998) found low (8%); 
other work remained between 30-40% (RodRigues, 2005; 
Bonaldo et al., 2007; podgaiski et al., 2007).  coddington 
et al. (2009), comparing several inventories, estimated for 
spiders an average percentage of 37.2% singletons, very 
close to what was found here.

The species richness estimator (Jackknife1) 
returned 44.1 (+3.32, 95% CI) species for Piratini river 
(70.2% of the spider fauna would have been sampled 
for that environment); 41 (+4.11) species for Camaquã 
river (63% sampled); 36.1 (+4.08) species for Sinos river 
(63.7% sampled) and 39.2 (+3.21) species for Maquiné river 
(71.3%) sampled. Even after two whole years of sampling, 
a high number of species (in RS, the only one below the 
work by podgaiski et al., 2007) and with new records for 

Tab. I. Spider species list for the Araneidae, sampled during two years (01.August.2007-06.July.2009) from three habitats in riparian forests of 
southern Brazil (GE, grassland edge; FI, forest interior; RE, river edge).

southern Brazil, in all rivers estimates were below 75% 
of the Araneidae fauna being sampled.

About differences in the araneid spider abundance 
and richness found on rivers, comparing riparian forests 
(MANOVA) for average, significant differences are found 
(Pillai’s Trace, value = 1.16; F = 5.53; p = 0.001). Spider 
abundance differed among riparian forests (MANOVA, F 
= 18.976; p &amp;lt;0.0001, Fig. 1) as well as species richness (F 
= 9.93; p = 0.001, Fig. 2). Overall, Piratini river riparian 
forest had the higher total abundance (N = 1900, Nadults = 
222) and richness (S = 31) for Araneidae; the lower values 
were in Sinos river forest (N = 749, Nadults = 90; S = 23). 
The stronger degradation and fragmentation of the riparian 
forests in Sinos river probably influenced the results, with 
human disturbance gradients associated negatively to web 
building. There are previous demonstrations that anthropic 
changes to the environment influence the spider fauna 
(laeseR et al., 2005; Benati et al., 2005).

Six species were common among all riparian 
forests: Araneus omnicolor (Keyserling, 1893), Cyclosa 
machadinho Levi, 1999, Eustala taquara (Keyserling, 
1892), Mangora strenua (Keyserling, 1893), Micrathena 
guanabara Levi, 1985 and Scoloderus cordatus 
(Taczanowski, 1879). Maquiné river forests had the higher 
number of exclusive species (11) (Tab. I). Among the 
Araneidae recorded for riparian forests in southern Brazil, 
59 were determined to the species level (91%). Among 
those, more than 60% were shared with two spider fauna 
lists for Rio Grande do Sul State: indRusiak &amp;amp; Buss (1998), 
in Santa Maria, in the centre of the State, where one of 
the sites studied was a riparian forest as well, and with 

RodRigues (2005) in Capão do Leão, south of the State, 
studying a restinga (sandy soil sclerophyllous) forest. A 
comparison with Bonaldo et al. (2007), studying various 
environments, among them five sites in riparian forests, 
yields 53% similarity for the Araneidae fauna. 

Comparisons with different ecosystems reveal a 
distinct Araneidae fauna, podgaiski et al. (2007) studied 
the araneofauna for the northwestern forests of RS, with 
high species richness, but recording only 38,7% of shared 
araneid species with ours. The same is valid for BaldisseRa 
et al. (2008) considering mixed broad-leaved/Araucaria 
forests and Pinus plantations, sampling manually from the 
tree-shrub layer, attaining 37% similarity only with our data.

Comparing habitats (MANOVA), significant 
differences are again found (Pillai’s Trace, value = 0.90; 
F = 4.86; p = 0.005). Among habitats, forest interior had 
the highest abundance (N = 1,922), followed by grassland 
edge (1,843) and river edge (1,257) spider abundance 
differed among habitats (MANOVA, F = 9.90; p = 0.001, 
Fig. 3); the same pattern holds for adult spiders only (FI 
= 256; GE = 169; RE = 108). Species richness was higher 
in the grassland edge (GE, richness mean = 10.63; S = 
45), followed by forest interior (FI, richness mean = 9.13; 
S = 30) and river edge (RE, richness mean = 7.13; S = 
25); species richness differed among habitats (F = 7.62; 
p = 0.007, Fig. 4). RodRigues (2005) recorded a similar 
pattern, with higher Araneidae abundance within the forest 
but higher species richness in the ecotone, here equivalent 
to the edge. BaldisseRa et al. (2004) recorded higher 
Araneidae abundance in the forest interior, with richness not 
differing from the edge. The same author considers that orb

weaving spiders can be strongly influenced by the edge 
effect, especially given microclimate changes. A higher 
abundance in the forest interior can be a result of a lower 
stress in terms of lower wind speeds and light intensity, 
however the higher richness in the edge requires an 
alternative explanation (see RodRigues et al., 2014).

Web building sites requires not only specific 
microclimates, but also space (Foelix, 1996), which in 
the grassland edge appears nearly unlimited; besides, this 
habitat had a high number of exclusive species (S = 23) but 
a high number of species shared with the forest interior. A 
gradient in abiotic conditions could be responsible for this, 
with certain species being able to withstand the edge and 
occur in both habitats, but some only finding appropriate 
conditions in the proper edge.

The forest interior registered 13 exclusive species, 
river edge had five and ten species were common to all 
habitats. Most of these species were represented by a few 
individuals (singletons or doubletons), preventing a proper 
assessment of environment preference.

Faunal similarity, compared among habitats in 
the riparian forests, recorded significant differences for 
both indexes used: qualitative (ANOSIM: Simpson, R = 
0.222; p = 0.040) and quantitative (Bray-Curtis, R = 0.274; 
p = 0.033). The forest interior is the most distinctive in 
species composition, differing from edges both for the 
qualitative (p = 0.02) and the quantitative (p = 0.03) index 
(Figs 5, 6). That is, even with the grassland edge richer in 
species, araneid species composition between the edges is 
similar, but the forest interiors are distinct. It appears that 
environmental factors related to the edge itself are more 
important than those related to the nearby habitat or matrix 
(grassland or river).

The temporal distribution of the Araneidae along 
two years shows a clear summer peak in numbers, valid for 
both sexes. Males appeared more homogeneously across 
time, but females are unequal in their time distribution 
(Fig. 7). Species richness was higher in the first year during 
spring (S = 21), as found by podgaiski et al. (2007) for 
Araneidae; however in the second year summer had the 
higher richness (S = 19). Winter had the lowest richness 
for both years (S = 6 and 7, respectively, Fig. 8). 

For the most abundant araneid species the 
phenological pattern across the seasons was also analysed. 
Mangora was the predominant genus in riparian forests, 
both in abundance and richness. The most abundant species 
was M. strenua (N = 134; 25% of all sampled adults), 
recorded in many samples with both males and females, 
peaking during summer and autumn both in the first and 
second years; it had a low frequency for winter and spring 
(Fig. 9). Most individuals were found in the forest interior 
(75%).

Scoloderus cordatus was sampled from all riparian 
forests and was the second most abundant Araneidae (N = 
69; 12.9%). Females of this species peaked in spring and 
summer, although males were registered more commonly in 
spring (Fig. 10). This species is among the most abundant in

other inventories as well (podgaiski et al., 2007; BaldisseRa 
et al., 2008), being known from grass and scrub vegetation 
(levi, 1995). This holds true here as well, since most (45%) 
of these spiders were found in the grassland edge.

Two Micrathena species were abundant: M. spitzi 
(N = 41; 7.69%) and M. guanabara (N = 13; 2.44%). 
In the first, both sexes occur only during summer and 
autumn (Fig. 11), being represented mostly in the forest 
interior (66%), but not recorded in Sinos riparian forests. 
It has been sampled from restinga shurbland and seasonal 
deciduous forest in RS State (RodRigues, 2005; podgaiski 
et al., 2007). Micratena guanabara was recorded from all 
rivers also with a preference for forest interior (92%); it 
was not recorded for either autumn or winter (Fig. 12).

We found nine Alpaida species, three being 
singletons. A. octolobata (N = 16; 3%) and A. citrina (N = 
10; 1.88%) were the most abundant. Alpaida octolobata had 
its higher peak in numbers in the third sample during spring, 

however, only during summer and autumn both sexes were 
recorded together (Fig. 13). This species was found only in 
the more southern rivers, Piratini and Camaquã and only for 
forest interior. Alpaida citrina had males and females only 
for the second sample during winter (Fig. 14); this species 
was exclusive for Maquiné river in the grassland edge.

Seven Cyclosa species occurred, the most abundant 
C. machadinho (N = 16; 3%), recorded in all riparian 
forests, and then C. fililineata; both were found mainly 
in the forest interior. Cyclosa machadinho had males and 
females only for the fifth sample, during summer (Fig. 15); 
but females peaked at various times along the samples. 
Cyclosa fililineata had two summer peaks, with male and 
females together only for the summer of the first sampling 
year (Fig. 16). podgaiski et al. (2007) registered both 
species for the seasonal deciduous forest of high Uruguai 
river in RS and Levi (1999) cites C. fililineata as occurring 
in gallery forests.

Araneus was represented by five species, with A. 
omnicolor the most abundant (N = 13; 2,44%) and the 
only in the genus to be found from all riparian forests, 
with individuals present only during summer and autumn 
(Fig. 17), and mostly in the forest interior (77%). Araneus 
omnicolor according to levi (1991) is to be found in 
humid forests; it has been recorded in various studies 
from different ecosystems in RS State (indRusiak &amp;amp; Buss, 
2003; RodRigues, 2005; silva &amp;amp; aRaújo, 2005; podgaiski 
et al., 2007).

The two species registered for Testudinaria were 
sampled exclusively from Maquiné river, T. lemniscata 
(N = 10; 1.88%) was again exclusive to the forest interior 
and appeared in several samples, but only during summer 
males and females occurred together (Fig. 18). Testudinaria 
quadripunctata was a singleton in the grassland edge. 
levi (2005) cites this species as well represented in varied 
environments and vegetation strata, but as their webs are 
nocturnal, this might explain its low representation here. 

The results show that the Araneidae fauna of Rio 
Grande do Sul State is becoming well known taxonomically, 
however, more work focusing on ecological aspects are 
necessary. Our expectations about different araneid spider 
abundance and richness on rivers were confirmed, and the 
biological edge hypothesis, considering the distinct nature 
of edges, evaluated here, was also confirmed. We need to 
better understand the life histories of the spiders from this 
family in different ecosystems and their habitats in southern 
Brazil. We hope the increasing amount of information 
on Neotropical spiders being produced will allow us 
nevertheless to paint a picture of the relationships of araneid 
spiders and riparian forests, fostering the understanding of 
the ecosystems they live in as well. They can be invaluable 
for conservation efforts, given their important ecosystem 
function and even its public appeal.
