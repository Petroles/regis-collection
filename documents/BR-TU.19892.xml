RESUMO 

RODRIGUEZ, Monica Rebelo, Análise de Competição em Licitações Brasileiras de Áreas de 

Exploração e Produção de Petróleo. Departamento de Engenharia de Petróleo: Faculdade de 

Engenharia Mecânica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 2010. 185 p. Tese de Doutorado. 

Há 10 anos da quebra do monopólio para a exploração e produção (E&amp;amp;P) de petróleo no Brasil o 

mercado se mostrou estável, competitivo e gerando resultados positivos que atraem o interesse 

das companhias nacionais e estrangeiras a investir no setor de “upstream”. O processo de cessão 

de direitos e obrigações sobre as áreas de E&amp;amp;P é conduzido pela Agência Nacional de Petróleo, 

Gás Natural e Bio-combustíveis (ANP) por meio de licitação pública, com regras bem definidas, 

onde o vencedor assina um contrato de concessão com a ANP. Esta pesquisa apresenta e analisa o 

histórico destas licitações para áreas de exploração e produção e áreas inativas com acumulações 

marginais, dentro do cenário econômico brasileiro e do potencial exploratório do país, e compara 

o desempenho das empresas no Brasil e no Golfo do México Americano, segundo os 

investimentos realizados para aquisição dessas áreas. Apresenta, ainda, um modelo estocástico 

para estimava do valor dos blocos desenvolvido a partir das ofertas realizadas para áreas da Bacia 

de Campos em licitações pretéritas. Para analisar o nível de competição esperado para essas áreas, 

este estudo descreve também o desenvolvimento de um sistema especialista com a ferramenta 

Exsys Corvid®, baseado no julgamento de 36 especialistas da indústria do petróleo que trabalham 

em 20 companhias de pequeno, médio e grande porte. A aplicação desta metodologia permite que 

estas companhias estimem o nível de competição (alto, moderado, ou baixo) para áreas da Bacia 

de Campos. Conhecendo o valor das áreas e a estimativa do nível de competição, é possível 

subsidiar o processo decisório na elaboração de estratégias de oferta que permitam uma melhor 

alocação financeira dos recursos e a gestão ótima do portfólio exploratório pretendido pela 

companhia.

ABSTRACT 

RODRIGUEZ, Monica Rebelo, Análise de Competição em Licitações Brasileiras de Áreas de 

Exploração e Produção de Petróleo. Departamento de Engenharia de Petróleo: Faculdade de 

Engenharia Mecânica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 2010. 185 p. Tese de Doutorado. 

After 10 years of the ending of petroleum exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) monopoly in Brazil, 

the market for those activities has shown to be stable and competitive, providing positive results 

which attracted both national and international investment for the upstream oil and gas sector. 

The regulatory agency promotes public licensing of E&amp;amp;P areas through a competitive sealed bid 

auction, whose rules are clear and known in advance by the companies. This research describes 

and evaluates the historical data for these E&amp;amp;P licensing, as well as for tenders of marginal 

oilfield accumulations, under the Brazilian economic scenario and the geologic potential of the 

country. It also compares oil companies performance regarding investment made in acquiring 

areas in Brazil to those in US-Gulf of Mexico. A stochastic model for block-value estimation is 

presented and applied to previous data from Campos Basin licensed areas. In order to estimate the 

level of competition expected for those areas, an expert system was built using Exsys Corvid®, 

based on the knowledge captured from 36 specialists in Brazilian public licensing working for 20 

oil companies. The proposed methodology is applied to the case of Campos Basin areas and 

showed to properly estimate the levels of competition expected (high, moderate or low) in the 

bid. By knowing the block-value and the expected level of competition, decision makers are 

better prepared for formulating bidding strategies that can result in better resources allocation and 

yield a better exploration portfolio management.

companies already have economic results from their exploration activities and are in the column 

of development and production. This is a picture of Brazilian players, but not definitive, because 

of the intrinsic and complex game of the oil industry with potential mergers, acquisitions of 

companies, as well as companies´ international strategies which are dynamic and almost 

unpredictable and push companies to play around the world …………………………………... 22

1. INTRODUÇÃO 

1.1. Motivação 

Na indústria brasileira do petróleo, bem como em vários países do mundo em que o estado 

é o proprietário dos recursos minerais existentes no subsolo, a transfer6encia de direitos e 

obrigações para explorar e produzir petróleo se dá por meio de licitações públicas de áreas pré-

determinadas, e segundo regras pré-estabelecidas pela agência reguladora. 

As companhias de petróleo qualificadas para participar desses processos licitatórios 

competem entre si pela aquisição dessas áreas para compor / recompor seu portfólio exploratório 

ou explotatório. Portanto, para vencerem a competição entre si, essas companhias devem 

apresentar a oferta mais competitiva, cuja elaboração se baseia em dois aspectos críticos: a 

valoração técnico-econômica da área e a análise da competição esperada para a área de interesse.  

Cada companhia faz sua estimativa de valor da área e compromete uma fração deste valor 

como oferta na licitação. A estimativa desta fração ótima é dada por modelos matemáticos, 

amplamente divulgados na literatura, que visam determinar a oferta ótima capaz de maximizar os 

investimentos da companhia. Esses modelos adotam como premissa, dentre outras, que exista 

competição pela área. Entretanto, não são conhecidos na literatura modelos que permitam realizar 

esta análise de competição considerando a percepção dos decisores. Sabendo que a análise de 

competição é um fator que pode modificar consideravelmente a oferta que a companhia 

apresentará para uma área, esta pesquisa se dedicou ao desenvolvimento de ferramentas para o 

cálculo da oferta ótima e estimativa do nível de competição esperado nas licitações brasileiras.

1.2. Objetivos 

A presente pesquisa objetiva desenvolver um método de estimativa do nível de competição 

esperado em uma determinada licitação pública brasileira para áreas de exploração e produção de 

petróleo (E&amp;amp;P), localizadas em uma bacia sedimentar marítima com sistema petrolífero ativo.  

Sua contribuição para a indústria do petróleo, dentre outras, é auxiliar os decisores nos 

processos de elaboração de estratégias de oferta mais competitivas que maximizem os 

investimentos e/ou aumentem a chance das empresas adquirirem áreas de E&amp;amp;P. 

1.3. Estrutura do Trabalho 

 
Para se alcançar o objetivo pretendido, esse trabalho contou com uma extensa pesquisa 

bibliográfica sobre licitações brasileiras de áreas de exploração e produção de petróleo (E&amp;amp;P), 

sobre modelos e processos de licitação no mundo, e ouviu a opinião de especialistas com 

experiência em leilões no Brasil e no mundo. Todas as observações aqui apresentadas consideram 

os conceitos da teoria dos leilões, da teoria dos jogos e de como se desenha um modelo de 

licitação que atenda as necessidades do governo e da indústria. 

O desenvolvimento da pesquisa e seus resultados são apresentados na forma de artigos 

técnicos publicados em congressos e revistas nacionais e internacionais, compondo os capítulos 

subsequentes, exceto o capítulo 6, ainda não publicado, cujo texto será submetido à apreciação da 

revista Resources Policy. A organização desses artigos (capítulos) segue a sequência da pesquisa 

e não sua ordem cronológica de publicação, permitindo assim, se ter um entendimento da 

evolução do trabalho  

O capítulo 2 apresenta o artigo publicado na revista Terrae, v. 6. no.1, em 2009, e discorre 

sobre como a agência reguladora brasileira (ANP) formatou o processo de licitação de áreas de 

E&amp;amp;P após o fim do monopólio estatal exercido pela Petrobras. Inicialmente, é mostrado o cenário 

de preço do petróleo mundial, em queda a partir da década de 80, e os resultados de sucesso 

exploratório alcançados simultaneamente pela Petrobras com a descoberta de campos gigantes de 

óleo na Bacia de Campos, que motivaram empresas estrangeiras a participarem das licitações

instituídas quando da sanção da Lei 9478/97 pelo governo. A idéia central deste capítulo é 

mostrar que o modelo adotado pela ANP, em função dos resultados das licitações, é considerado 

sucesso dentro dos conceitos teóricos que analisam o número de participantes no processo 

(competidores), a quantidade de área adquirida e o montante de bônus arrecadado pelo governo. 

Após seis anos licitando com sucesso as áreas exploratórias, a ANP ofereceu ao mercado 

áreas inativas com acumulação marginais de petróleo sob um modelo muito semelhante ao já 

consagrado. O capítulo 3 apresenta as informações sobre este modelo e os resultados das duas 

licitações realizadas até então, mostrando que devido ao caráter de baixos volumes recuperáveis, 

o número e o perfil das companhias que competem por essas áreas difere daquelas que se 

qualificam para as licitações exploratórias. Em geral, são companhias brasileiras de pequeno 

porte que competem pelas áreas, preferencialmente consorciadas entre si, e que não têm perfil de 

atuação conhecido no segmento “upstream” da cadeia do petróleo. O objetivo dessa seção, cujo 

artigo foi publicado na Revista Brasileira de Geociências, v. 38, no. 2 em 2008, além de 

apresentar os dados compilados destas licitações, é mostrar que a análise de competição é um 

estudo a ser feito para qualquer processo decisório de aquisição de área via licitação pública. 

Entretanto, as áreas inativas com acumulações marginais não foram alvo deste estudo devido à 

ausência de um número de dados estatisticamente significativo para a aplicação dos métodos de 

valoração e competição aqui propostos. 

Assim sendo, tais métodos foram desenvolvidos para as licitações de áreas exploratórias da 

Bacia de Campos, por esta ter sido ofertada em oito das dez licitações promovidas pela ANP, 

existindo, portanto, uma massa crítica de dados que permitiram estudar os processos decisórios de 

aquisição de áreas. A tomada de decisão sobre qual a oferta mais competitiva a apresentar precisa 

considerar o valor ótimo da oferta a ser comprometida como bônus de assinatura, o montante de 

programa de trabalho exploratório (PEM) e o nível de competição esperado para cada área. O 

capítulo 4 mostra que a busca por métodos que maximizem as ofertas apresentadas pelas 

companhias é objeto de estudo de vários autores, conforme indicado na literatura deste artigo 

publicado na AAPG Bulletin, v. 92, no. 10 em 2008. Dentro dos conceitos de eficiência alocativa, 

maximização de receitas e multidimensionalidade das informações e das propostas foi 

desenvolvido um método, baseado na simulação estocástica utilizando o método de Monte Carlo,

para calcular a oferta ótima a partir das informações públicas (simétricas) existentes. Os 

resultados simulados são comparados aos bônus efetivamente realizados e a análise das 

estratégias adotadas pelas companhias, permite o decisor identificar como é possível elaborar 

uma estratégia de oferta competitiva utilizando diferentes valores da fração do valor monetário 

esperado (VME) da área. 

A partir deste ponto da pesquisa duas questões suscitaram interesse em se investigar: 

a) a primeira se refere aos valores de oferta que as companhias de petróleo estão oferecendo para 

as áreas da Bacia de Campos. Partindo da premissa da licitação competitiva selada, ou seja, que 

tais companhias não conhecem os valores que seus competidores irão oferecer pela área, nem 

quais são estas áreas de interesse, nem quantos e quais são estes competidores, foi testada a 

hipótese de que as empresas que participam de uma licitação brasileira realizam investimentos 

para aquisição de áreas similares aos realizados para áreas no Golfo do México Americano; 

b) a segunda diz respeito ao processo decisório em si que requer uma análise de competição 

robusta para que a oferta mais competitiva seja  vencedora, sem entretanto, deixar um montante 

de dinheiro desnecessário sobre a mesa ou que permita a companhia não ser vítima da maldição 

do vencedor (pagamento de bônus muito elevados que não retornarão os investimentos 

realizados). 

 O capítulo 5 aborda o teste de hipótese supracitado, tendo sido escolhido o Golfo do 

México Americano (US-GOM) por ter suas áreas licitadas, segundo um modelo com dinâmica de 

oferta semelhante às licitações brasileiras, por mais de 40 anos, apresentando áreas com 

resultados de sucesso exploratório, campos em produção com infraestrutura de escoamento, e 

características geológicas para acumulação de hidrocarboneto, similares as da Bacia de Campos 

(BC). A análise comparativa entre as ofertas do US-GOM e da BC considerou os valores de 

bônus e PEM e teve seus resultados publicados sob o no. SPE 113696 dos anais do 2008 SPE 

Europec / EAGE Annual Conf. and Exhibition. A análise foi conduzida para ofertas por áreas de 

águas rasas e profundas, onde se observou que as empresas internacionais adquirem as áreas da 

BC desembolsando valores “upfront” comparáveis aos bônus pagos por áreas no US-GOM, 

porém comprometendo valores adicionais a título de PEM como pagamento de longo termo.

 No capítulo 6 é apresentada a metodologia desenvolvida para auxiliar os decisores no 

processo de estimativa de competição que suporta a escolha da melhor estratégia de oferta. Esta 

seção, estruturada sob a forma de artigo técnico ainda não foi publicada, mas seu conteúdo foi 

submetido à apreciação do editor da revista Resources Policy. Com o intuito de identificar como 

os decisores estimam a competição, alguns métodos de pesquisa operacional baseados em análise 

mutliatributo foram investigados (matriz de decisão e processo analítico hierárquico) com o 

suporte acadêmico do Prof. Dr. Michael Walls na Economic and Business Division da Colorado 

School of Mines. Porém, tais métodos, apesar de lidar com a preferência dos decisores, não 

incorporam processos cognitivos como o julgamento de cada decisor (raciocínio lógico 

construído a partir de suas experiências e conhecimento). Métodos como sistema especialista, 

ramo da inteligência artificial, capturam tais julgamentos, sendo capaz de auxiliar as tomadas de 

decisão a partir da construção de uma base de conhecimento e da formulação de regras que 

representam a lógica racional dos decisores. A construção do sistema especialista se deu a partir 

da captura do conhecimento de 36 representantes da indústria do petróleo familiarizados com os 

processos de licitação no Brasil. Profissionais de empresas de pequeno, médio e grande porte 

foram convidados a responder um questionário inédito desenvolvido especificamente para 

abordar a competição por áreas da Bacia de Campos, o qual permitiu quantificar a percepção com 

relação a formação de parcerias e outros. Transformando este conhecimento em variáveis, regras 

e blocos lógicos com a plataforma Exsys Corvid®, foi possível estimar o nível de competição 

esperado para cenários variáveis do tipo de áreas ofertadas, do número e perfil de companhias 

participantes e quanto ao tipo e proveniência das informações que circulam durante o período de 

licitação e que podem impactar a análise de competição. 

 Toda a metodologia desenvolvida nesse trabalho se voltou para as licitações brasileiras de 

áreas de exploração e produção sob o modelo de concessão adotado pela ANP. Entretanto, 

motivada pelo novo marco regulatório que determina a assunção do modelo de Partilha de 

Produção (PSC) para licitar áreas exploratórias da camada do pré-sal, esta pesquisa capturou o 

julgamento dos especialistas quanto ao possível impacto que este modelo e suas regras poderiam 

causar na competição por estas áreas. Os resultados são apresentados e discutidos ainda no 

capítulo 6.

Abstract 

This article proposes a method to estimate the competition level in future Brazilian petroleum 

leases, built upon Campos Basin history data. The method can be applied to all competitive 

licensing structures, independently of the type of exploration agreement used (concession or 

production sharing contracts). The level of competition in both agreement models is broadly the 

same, but there are some intrinsic differences, widely reviewed by the literature, that could lead to 

changes in the licensing results. The estimation of the competition level is directly related to the 

definition of the winning offer. In Brazilian licensing procedures the winner bid results from a 

combination of three attributes: (1) signature bonus value; (2) minimum exploration program; and 

(3) local content level. This combination makes the estimation of competition level a key issue for 

decision-makers to strategically define the most competitive offer that could enhance the 

possibility to win the area. The proposed methodology is based on the capture of knowledge 

expert's to build a knowledge automation expert system, using EXSYS CORVID® software, that

Campos Basin - the most successful exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) pool for the last 30 years in 

Brazil. The method collected the judgment of 36 professionals occupying different hierarchy

majors and independent petroleum companies. The results brought to light by this study allow 

companies to use a reliable method to objectively estimate competition level for Brazilian

1. Introduction  

 
This article proposes a method to estimate competition level for future Brazilian petroleum 

leases, built upon Campos Basin history data. 

 

The method can be applied to all competitive licensing structures, independently of the type of 

exploration agreement used (concession or production sharing contracts), but varying the premises 

adopted. The level of competition in both agreement models is broadly the same, but there are 

some intrinsic differences, widely reviewed by the literature, that could lead to changes in the 

licensing results. 

 

The estimation of the competition level is directly related to the definition of the winning offer. 

According to Capen et al. (1971) and Lohrenz (1987), the optimal bid estimation is based on the 

highest signature bonus value. However, for the Brazilian licensing procedures, the winner bid 

results from a combination of three attributes: (1) signature bonus value; (2) minimum exploration 

program; and (3) local content level. This combination makes the estimation of competition level a 

key issue for decision-makers to strategically define the most competitive offer that could enhance 

the possibility to win the area. 

 

Achieving more with less requires formulating and deploying sound strategies. Today’s 

Exploration and Production (E&amp;amp;P) Licensing competition demands excellence both in strategy and 

in its execution by senior management to win the bid. One of the most important process for a 

petroleum company when planning to participate in an E&amp;amp;P Licensing  acreage is estimate the 



 

83 
 

  

level of competition it should face. As part of a whole decision making process that has long-term 

implications and short time to decide, top managers should consider not only the well known 

mathematical techniques, but human perceptions and judgments involved to reach high risk 

decisions. The focus should be on developing a comprehensive methodology for solving strategic 

level decision making problem which are at present tackled in an ad-hoc manner.  

 

The proposed methodology consist in capturing competitor’s knowledge to build a 

mathematical model based on expert system, which should help decision-maker estimate the level 

of competition in a licensing sale. The method for capturing expert’s knowledge uses both 

interviews and questionnaires, was developed specifically for this purpose. These tools took into 

consideration aspects raised from the literature that are identified as fundamental on the estimation 

of competition level. Having captured these expertise and using a computer program - EXSYS 

CORVID®, based on an expert system, which is a branch of artificial intelligence, it was possible 

to develop a knowledge automated expert system using the questionnaires´ answers to build the 

rule-based logic and blocks logic in order to bring the best recommendation, instead of either a 

guess or a trivial solution.  

 

The questionnaire, used to investigate the main competition variables, adopted a hypothetical 

scenario considering a Brazilian licensing sale for petroleum acreage located at Campos Basin, a 

mature offshore sedimentary basin because it has been: (1) offered in eight out of ten licensing 

sales held in the country, providing a significant amount of unbiased data on bid results; (2) the 

offshore basin with higher number of competitors bidding for areas; and (3) a successful 

exploration pool for the last 30 years, presently accounting for around 85% of the total Brazilian 

petroleum production, which positively impacts the evaluation companies  have about the areas 

offered in each lease sale.  

 

The method applied to estimate competition level for Campos Basin areas in Brazilian leases 

takes into account: (1) the judgment of 36 staff individuals of super-majors, majors and 

independent petroleum companies, positioned at different hierarchy levels; (2) the petroleum 



 

84 
 

  

potential areas in each lease round; (3) E&amp;amp;P corporate strategies, structure and size of the licensing 

qualified companies; and (4) the overall scenario of worldwide E&amp;amp;P activities. 

 

The results brought to light by this study allow companies to use a reliable method to 

objectively estimate competition level for Brazilian petroleum lease sale, helping decision-makers 

to develop bidding strategies aligned with companies’ exploration portfolio long term strategies. 

 

This article is organized in four sections. The first section explains the role of competition in a 

licensing sale, followed by another chapter dedicated to present the methodology developed to help 

decision making estimates the expected level of competition. The third section points out the 

results obtained with the expert’s knowledge captured, which is the base of all research on 

competition. A set of conclusions wraps up the research project performed and the results 

achieved. 

 

2. The Role of Competition in Petroleum Licensing Environment 
 

Auctioning petroleum rights is a game where players take strategic decisions considering 

other players´ behavior, turning competition evaluation into a focal point for bidding strategies. 

The game theory literature contains a number of papers about optimal common value auctions that 

maximize revenues, as well as the importance of the game rules and characteristics of the 

economic environment for equilibrium models. It also assumes that bidder’s private information is 

symmetrically distributed or bidders have no uncertainty over what the auctioned asset is worth to 

them (Porter, 1995).  

    

According to Cramtom (2005), offering exploration acreage through auction is advantageous 

due to the tendency this process has to transfer rights and obligations to the most capable 

companies to explore them. This can be reached through the existing competition among players. 

Oil companies estimating higher value for a specific area can make a better offer enhancing their 

chance to win the willing acreage  

 



 

85 
 

  

Another advantage of competition in sealed bid auctions is to grant the success of the 

licensing process. As stated by Cramtom (op.cit.), highly competitive bids always grant 

government higher financial return drift resulting from the success of a sealed bid auction. 

Whenever there are more players bidding in the auction game, more amounts of cash signature 

bonuses are committed as a result of companies' geological evaluation of available areas. These 

bonuses reveal the companies' value for the area, suggesting that competitors are aware of 

companies' perception which may result in higher offer values in the upcoming auctions. As the 

level of competition increases, more aggressive optimal bids are offered, leading to the conclusion 

that the best competitive bid could be a good predictor of an asset’s value (Rothkopf &amp;amp; Harstad, 

1994) 

 

Depending on the number of players (competitors), companies risk aversion, technical 

expertise and the economic criteria of each company, the offer presented for each exploration area 

reflects a fraction of a market value for each company evaluation, and may vary significantly. 

 

Competition is a parameter used by Reece (1979) to evaluate which kind of licensing model 

grants a higher rent of return to the government. He developed a mathematical model using the 

number of competitors as a variable that represents competition. The assumptions adopted 

considered that companies are not acting in a “cartelized” manner they focus the maximum rate of 

return, make independent offers, and know the associated costs of the area they are bidding for. 

Reece (op.cit.) also assumes identical bidding strategies for all companies. 

 

After analyzing the revenues captured by the government in models based on signature 

bonus, profit share and royalty taxes, Reece (op.cit.) concluded that the higher slice of total rent is 

obtained when adopting a Production Sharing Contract model and the lowest return is obtained 

with a Signature Bonus model for any number of competitors playing the game. In a Signature 

bonus model, from competitors’ side, Capen et al. (1971) suggest that they should present lower 

offers whenever there are a higher number of players in a particular petroleum auction to avoid the 

winner’s curse. According to their analyses a higher number of players implies in more acreage 

acquired, but with low value spent per area. As the number of players increases, competitors tend 



 

86 
 

  

to enhance their offers paying higher values than the worth one, consequently letting money on the 

table. Another negative aspect of committing a higher bonus bid is the possibility of winner’s 

curse. According to its technical and economic evaluation one company overestimates forecasted 

reserves bidding a higher bonus value for this acreage. E&amp;amp;P activities show results below the 

expected bidding profitability, i.e., the volumes are lower than forecasted causing a lower internal 

rate of return. This phenomenon is known as winner’s curse (Figure 1). 

 

 

Figure 1 – Schematic diagram from acreage evaluation up to obtain a proved reserve bearing a 

winner’s curse 

 

Johnston (1994) states that for a bidder having success on the auction and still have some 

profits with the activities developed over the winner area it should bid below the expected 

monetary value (EMV). The bonus (b) corresponds to a fraction (c) of the EMV (equation 1). This 

“c” value (bid fraction) should be comprised between 0 and 1 for EMV values ranging from 0 to 

100%.  Capen et alii (1971) assume “c” as representative of a fraction of the market reserve value 

that should vary from 20% to 30% (c=0.2 up to 0.3) due to the area attractiveness, available 

information and reserve uncertainties to avoid a winner’s curse. 

b = c x EMV                                                      (Equation 1) 

The increased competition produces increased allowance for a winner’s curse. According to 

Rothkopf &amp;amp; Harstad (1994), the winning bidders expect profit to decline approximately as the 

square of the number of bidders and decreases when estimating accuracy increases.  

 

Hartsock (1977) developes a mathematical model to help companies with bidding strategies 

based on their behavior on US-GOM tenders. He was looking for answers to questions like: Should 

a bid combine spend companies leasing budget by bidding very high on a few low-risk area, thus

enhancing their chances of winning some area, or should they distribute the budget over more areas 

by bidding less on each area while reducing the chances of winning any single area? And, is it 

more beneficial for a company to bid with a group, thereby spreading the risk by reducing the 

expected cost, or should a company bid alone assuming the full risk?   

Hoffman et al. (1991) analyze auction games in which companies developed partnership 

(consortium) to present only one offer, apparently to share risk capital and information. They use 

direct correlations of an auction measurement and concluded that competition is positively 

correlated with market variables. Besides this, they observe that variables such as "number of 

competitors" and "number of offers" should be considered independently one from another when 

analyzing auction results in order not to mask the game comprehension. 

 

Literature widely states that companies pool to split technical risk and commit more cash 

value for the offer (Iledare et al., 2004; Saidi &amp;amp; Marsden, 1992). Hoffman et al. (1991) observe a 

positive correlation between the number of players (company presenting offer in a licensing sale) 

and the number of consortium attesting that making a joint bidding offer not necessarily reduces 

the total number of players presenting offer. Repsold (2003) points out that consortium have a 

tendency to unify the proposals toward the higher one, and to, along time, disclose companies 

techniques and strategies, allowing an important knowledge on competitors behavior. Conversely, 

Rothkopf &amp;amp; Harstad (1994) conclude that firms have concern about revealing information to rivals 

that will create disadvantages during the current auction and they may go to great effort to withhold 

private information which is a key to future bidding profitability.  

 

Saidi &amp;amp; Marsden (op.cit.) identify that consortia formed through the association of two, 

three, or even four companies presenting one offer for a specific area, tend to be the winner against 

offers made by sole companies. Consortium could associate companies with different profiles and 

financial support, allowing more competitive offers that could result in the area acquisition with a 

lower capital exposition for each company. In this sense, consortium can be considered more 

aggressive enhancing the likelihood to win their higher priority acreage or buying higher number of 

low priority areas with considerable money left on the table. 

 



 

88 
 

  

Emphasizing that companies participating in a petroleum exploration licensing are: a) serious 

and competent for doing E&amp;amp;P activities; b) legal, technical and financially qualified for the 

licensing; and c) have a firm intention to present offers and acquire acreage aligned with their 

strategies; divergence of opinions among competitors could result from reasons such as the 

existence of information. 

 

Porter (1995) discuss the role of information in the Outer Continental Shelf lease sales, and 

posted that it can play a crucial role in auctions, as information level varies among competitors. 

Part of the information is available for all players, but others are restricted to few companies. The 

available information is called public, and is generally sold by the regulatory agency for the players 

interested in making an offer which shall pay for the geological data. The restricted or private 

information one is known only by the companies performing E&amp;amp;P activities around the area 

offered in the licensing. In this sense it is right to state that public information generates symmetry 

among competitors while private one, creates an asymmetry which is favorable for the well 

informed company (Tavares, 2000). 

 

Reece (1979) observes that in licensing where players have the same level of information, i. 

e., only symmetric information, companies tend to obtain similar values for the auctioned area, and 

government revenue fractions are higher than the competitors, independent of the licensing model 

applied. For Sunnevåg (2000), to estimate competition through the number of competitors is 

irrelevant when only public information is available. In petroleum licensing with asymmetric 

information, companies´ evaluation may vary significantly, resulting in different values for the 

asset auctioned. The strategic variable, in this case, is the number of companies possessing private 

data. Therefore, any asymmetric information is a competitive advantage for one company over the 

others, enhancing its possibility to make profits. 

 

It is reasonable to consider that information has a fundamental role in reducing uncertainties 

on acreage technical and economic evaluation. Companies with more data and knowledge can 

make more precise evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of an area, and decision-makers feel 



 

89 
 

  

more confident in ranking the areas they will bid for, and how much should be committed as 

signature bonus for each one. 

 

Although all the authors above mentioned agree that the three more important variables to 

analyze competition in a licensing round are: a) the area auctioned, b) the qualified companies, and 

c) the available information; in general, they developed their mathematical models for bidding 

optimization. Academics are interested in a methodology that could give a better offer estimation 

to win the bid paying as less as possible to not left money on the table. Competition is mainly 

evaluated from a revenue return point of view.  

 

The purpose of this study is, using these three main variables, estimate the expected level of 

competition in a Brazilian licensing sale. 

 

3. Research Methods and Methodology to Estimate Competition Level 
 

The main purpose of this study is to estimate the expected level of competition in a particular 

petroleum exploration licensing sale, based on the capture of experts knowledge which are directly 

involved in the decision making process. These experts are the ones who define the most 

competitive offer that could result in winning the bid for the specific acreage.  

 

Despite the fact that professionals of the oil industry usually do not document the way they 

estimate competition in the specialized literature, all companies participating in an E&amp;amp;P 

competitive bid perform competitive analyses. Artificial intelligence and Operational Research 

methods (OR) can be pointed out as the most common methods applied. 

 

Different from the standard optimization techniques, which are appropriate to solve problems 

for predictable environments, deterministic behavior of people, or for small and narrow contents - 

the multi-criteria decision making process have been studied under the general classification of OR 

problems. Its purpose is to deal with taking decisions in the presence of a number of often 

conflicting criteria, and is divided into two groups: multi-objective and multi-attribute decision 

making (Bhushan &amp;amp; Rai, 2004). As multi-attribute deals with discrete decision spaces, where 



 

90 
 

  

decision alternatives are predetermined, two analytical methods were tested to estimate the level of 

competition: 1) the weighted sum method (WSM), and 2) the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). 

WSM is a decision matrix approach used to evaluate each alternative with respect to each criterion 

and then multiplies that evaluation by the importance of the criterion. AHP is a structured 

technique for dealing with complex decisions. Rather than prescribing a "correct" decision, AHP 

helps decision-makers find the one that best suits their needs and their understanding of the 

problem (Saaty, 2008). Despite that these methods catch some characteristics of the decision 

making process, both AHP and WSM do not reach reliable results, but allow a better understanding 

of the decision making process and the variables involved. They do not capture the decision-maker 

judgment, which is a fundamental element when analyzing competition. Some of those methods 

deal with preferences that differ from judgment, a cognitive aspect of the decision making process 

(Bazerman, 2006). 

 

As artificial Intelligence encompasses many aspects of human behavior such as speech, 

language, movement, among others, knowledge automation expert systems - a branch of Artificial 

Intelligence, which focuses on the capture and dissemination of problem solving knowledge via 

computer programs – tends to be a powerful tool for estimation of the level of competition. These 

expert systems are used to advise, diagnose, or troubleshoot problems that were once only 

performed by humans. This option will be used by this research project. 

 

The method adopted by this research to collect data can be divided into two groups: 

quantitative or qualitative research, and deskwork or fieldwork. Among the existing research 

approaches, surveys were adopted to collect data by asking pre-established questions in a specific 

order to a group of individuals who are representative of a targeted population. This research 

project applies two types of survey: questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. 

 

• Questionnaires, as observed by Blaxter et al. (1996, in: Asrilhant, 2001), are one of the most 

commonly used research techniques in the social sciences. They are mainly used for collecting 

primary data, whether they are quantitative or qualitative. Questionnaires are usually posted, 

but they can also be administered by telephone, e-mail or face-to-face. Questionnaires must 



 

91 
 

  

involve properly framed questions, so that the respondents can clearly and unequivocally 

understand them. A researcher must also test and amend a questionnaire before its 

administration. There are two formats of questions: closed and open-ended. A type of closed 

question is the forced-choice question. This allows the respondents to select one or more 

responses from an exhaustive and mutually exclusive list of alternatives. The other type of 

closed question uses a response options format. Finally, open-ended questions allow for free 

answers; 

• Interviews, another research technique, represent an extensively applied method of 

investigating the participants’ experiences, perspectives and understandings in some depth. 

Interviews are categorized into different formats, such as structured, semi-structured or 

unstructured. A structured interview is a formal instrument based on an interview schedule. It 

comprehends a set of clear instructions, and questions are asked in a specific order. The semi-

structured interview is less formal, including open-ended questions. Questions are not posed in 

a rigid order, and can be re-worded for a specific interview. Unstructured interviews do no 

impose clear rules. They are based on an interview agenda where open-ended questions are 

developed during the interviews (Clarke and Dawson, 1999a, in: Asrilhant, 2001). 

The proposed research methodology is divided into three phases: 1) the exploratory 

investigation, (2) the knowledge capture, and (3) the expert system development. The methodology 

began with a qualitative approach. A set of semi-structured, preliminary face-to-face interviews 

were carried out to give a sense of reality to the research problem, motivate the design of the next 

steps of the proposed research methodology and support the reviewed literature to describe the 

research hypotheses. The exploratory investigation was followed by a quantitative approach. A 

questionnaire, which was the main source of data in the current study, tested the research 

hypothesis, generalized the exploratory findings, consolidated the overall findings, and supported 

the development of the logic base rules to build the expert system model. Finally, a computer work 

was performed based on the principles of artificial intelligence incorporating the expert knowledge 

captured by the questionnaire to help decision-makers estimate the level of competition. In this 

research project, the presence of the interviewee during the questionnaire application was 

fundamental to explore relevant issues that could give more details regarding the issues 



 

92 
 

  

investigated by the questionnaire. Table 1 summarizes the phases of the proposed research 

methodology. 

 

3.1 Exploratory Investigation 

 

The exploratory investigation consisted of the pilot testing of the questionnaire. It was set as 

a transition from theory to method which relates and checks theory with practice, as a prototype of 

the core investigation, and motivated the design of the next phases of the current research 

methodology. The exploratory investigation was performed in two stages: (1) exploratory 

deskwork, and (2) exploratory fieldwork (Table 2). The exploratory deskwork aimed to seek a 

correspondence between the elements obtained from theory and practice, defining the set of main 

elements to be placed within a conceptual framework. The exploratory fieldwork is the part of the 

research dedicated to obtain from experts their consent on the deskwork mapped variables. The 

definition of fieldwork should consider the current fast technological evolution aggregating such a 

kind of work done virtually, such as telephone interviews and e-mailed questionnaires.

Exploratory Deskwork 

 

The exploratory deskwork target was to search for the identification of a set of relevant 

elements from the literature and seek a correspondence between theory and practice. The elements 

should be supported by the literature to ensure their completeness and credibility in order to be 

effective and acceptable. Elements must be carefully examined in order to assess the extent to 

which they are included, and whether any element should be combined, eliminated or re-stated, 

along with the examination of potential interrelationships amongst them.  

 

Widely discussed by the theory presented in Section 2, the elements identified were grouped 

in four main sets. The first one is related to the importance of the geological and economic 

potential of the area been offered in a particular tender (prospectivity, proximity to existing 

production facilities, among others). The second set refers to possible competitors (number of 

qualified companies, strategies, past tender behavior, E&amp;amp;P activities in the basin, among others). 

The third group focuses on information (symmetric or asymmetric, amount and quality, confidence 

on information source). The last category holds joint bidding arrangements envisaging area 

acquisition. 

 



 

94 
 

  

These necessary and sufficient sets of relevant elements for the estimation of competition 

level in decision making process are the basis for the exploratory fieldwork, which follows. 

 

Exploratory Fieldwork  

 

The main purpose of the exploratory fieldwork is to check and calibrate the elements 

identified for estimating the level of competition in E&amp;amp;P licensing acreage. Interviewing experts, 

whose knowledge rose from the business world of upstream oil and gas sector, helped achieve this 

purpose. 

 

The exploratory fieldwork was conducted interviewing eight professionals of the upstream 

oil and gas industry. It was carried out doing seven semi-structured face-to-face interviews and one 

e-mailed questionnaire for group of decision-makers holding top, medium and junior positions 

(two executive directors, two senior advisors, two business consultants, and two technicians). Each 

interview lasted, on average, one hour. The relevant elements and their operational definitions were 

produced, based on the ranking of the most important elements, such as: (1) the geological 

potential of auctioned asset, (2) the total number of companies qualified and their E&amp;amp;P profile; and 

(3) the available information on companies´ E&amp;amp;P strategies. During the questionnaire testing a 

second round of contact was conducted by e-mailing the questionnaire to four professionals, 

among the eight previously interviewed. This second approach supported the re-examination of the 

proposed set of elements and the possible interrelationships amongst them, helping the design of 

the final version of the questionnaire.  

 

3.2 Knowledge Capture 
 
 

This is the core investigation methodology on this research and consisted of design and 

administration of a questionnaire. 

 

According to Awad (2003), knowledge is human understanding of a specialized field of 

interest that has been acquired through experience and study. Davenport and Prusak (2000) define 



 

95 
 

  

knowledge as a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, and expert insight 

that provides a framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. 

Hence, a knowledge base is a set of facts and inference rules for determining new information and 

“smarter” knowledge to support decision making. It is not a simply database. It is an understanding 

gained through study that includes perception, skills, training, common sense, and experience.  

 

Intelligent behavior implies the ability to understand and use language and store and access 

relevant experience. Humans acquire expertise, learnt via experience. Expertise incorporates the 

ability to reason and make deductions as well as common sense (unreflective opinions of ordinary 

human beings). Knowledge is neither data nor information. Although it is related to both, it 

embraces a wider sphere than information. Data are unorganized and unprocessed facts. 

Information has meaning, purpose and relevance. Therefore, evaluated data becomes information 

when meaning or value is added to improve the quality of decision making.  

 

A questionnaire is the main tool to capture expert’s knowledge in the domain of competition 

for petroleum acreage acquisition. It must be able to address the research question, test the research 

hypothesis, and catch respondents´ know-how to support the building of an expert system for 

expected level of competition estimation helping decision-makers elaborate the strategies to 

enhance their companies chances to win the bid. The questionnaire aimed to identify: (1) the 

elements to which decision-makers pay considerable attention while estimating competition level; 

(2) the inter-relationship among these elements; (3) the level of expected competition; and (4) 

decision-makers opinion about competition level and the licensing model applied by government. 

 

The knowledge capture comprised three stages. The first stage was the questionnaire design, 

which consisted of four steps: (1) sampling procedure; (2) questionnaire structure; (3) 

measurement and operational definition of the research variables; and (4) questionnaire reliability 

and validity. The second stage referred to the questionnaire administration, which consisted of 

three steps: (1) primary access; (2) pilot testing; and (3) main survey.  

 

 



 

96 
 

  

Questionnaire Design 

 

It describes the sampling procedure, as observed by Chou (1998), refers to the selection of a 

subject from a population of interest. The sampling procedure is divided into four areas of 

consideration: (1) unit of analysis; (2) sample size; (3) sample frame; and (4) sample design, as 

discussed in the following. This research project aims to estimate the level of competition to be 

used in a decision making process to define the most competitive offer for a specific area in a 

petroleum exploration lease. Sample size is an important step in the sampling procedure. The 

assumption of normality is, according to Hair et al. (1997), an influential constraint in dealing with 

basic statistics. The characteristics of the distribution (e.g. mean and standard deviation) and t- and 

F-tests are generally based on the premise of a normal distribution. According to the Central Limit 

Theorem, a sample size of at least thirty observations is necessary to take normality for granted. 

Samples with less than thirty observations are considered small and require special tests to 

determine statistically significant findings. 

 

This project research has a sample size of thirty-six valid observations. The sample frame 

refers to the identification and description of the targeted population. The focal population of this 

study is the Brazilian upstream oil and gas sector. The selection of the representative companies of 

the population was based on two complementary criteria: (1) concessionaires of E&amp;amp;P offshore 

areas; and (2) corporate structure and size. The concessionaire criteria was based on the number of 

current companies technically qualified by the petroleum regulatory agency to explore and produce 

oil and gas offshore Brazil. Consulting the petroleum regulatory agency data base (ANP, 2010) the 

number of current 77 concessionaires could be split into 46 companies performing onshore 

activities and, 31 operators or partners for E&amp;amp;P shallow or deepwater areas. A total number of 20 

offshore concessionaires was sampled corresponding to 65% of the total oil and gas companies 

currently working offshore Brazil. The second criterion was used to pick up those 20 

concessionaires according to their corporate structure and size. Six groups were formed to be 

representative of the diversity profile of companies and Public or Government Agencies operating 

in the Brazilian petroleum upstream sector: Super Majors, American Independents, International 

Oil Companies, Domestic Companies, and International Regional Companies. 



 

97 
 

  

 

As it occurs in most of the companies, the decision making process is generally done by 

more than one expert directly involved in the competition evaluation, it is important to sample as 

much experts as possible to obtain different judgments on competition. On the other hand, as 

petroleum licensing is a competitive process and any piece of information is considered to be a 

competitive advantage, experts must be confident on an interviewee’s ethical behavior. This 

research surveyed 36 experts, which were assured confidentiality by not disclosing their particular 

and professional identities, opinions and name of companies surveyed. Only the findings of this 

study are to be published as a whole. 

 

The main purpose of the questionnaire applied in this study is to capture how experts 

estimate competition level on a Concession Contract Licensing model. Considering that there were 

no existing questionnaires available for this purpose, the current questionnaire was an useful 

exploratory, descriptive instrument. The structure of the ten-page questionnaire consists of: a) 

cover letter, including a guidance for completing the questionnaire and a hypothetical petroleum 

exploration licensing round scenario; b) three sections of closed questions, and c) a fourth section 

comprised of one open-ended question. The guidance for completing the questionnaire included 

the aims of the research, fixed values and numbers of some discretionary variables in order to 

restrict the universe of dependent variables and some variables' definitions. When presenting the 

questionnaire face-to-face, the interviewee usually stated that they only need to answer questions 

which were relevant to them, and, if they had not been involved in any petroleum competitive 

bidding process they could either introduce the interviewee to another expert or forward the 

questionnaire to someone who had been involved with this subject. 

 

The questionnaire is structured in three main sections related to the three most important 

issues to be evaluated in competition level estimation: a) information; b) acreage; and c) 

companies’ profile. The first section of the questionnaire referred to the companies qualified for 

the licensing bid sale. The idea of this part is to capture expert judgment about the identification of 

potential competitors they could face according to their financial position and strategies for that 

specific licensing sale. The second section referred to the areas on offer by the regulatory agency in 



 

98 
 

  

the specified mature sedimentary basin. The purpose of the third section was to assess how 

information affects the competition level evaluation. These three sections also contain questions 

that mix the subjects, i.e., questions involving potential area with information, and/or number of 

potential competitors. The rationale behind these questions was to investigate the inter-

relationships of those variables and how they may change expert's perception on the competition 

level. The fourth section, composed by just one open-ended question, envisaged to capture the 

industry perception on how the new regulatory policies could impact the level of competition in the 

new Brazilian licensing model such as the Production Sharing Contract, under government 

analysis. Finally, respondents were advised that the research findings will be published after 

analyzed, and respondents will be notified about the publication.   

 

A total number of 25 multiple-choice questions plus some related questions were considered 

in the questionnaire. The multiple-choice type questions are either excludent (yes or no questions) 

or ranking scale questions. According to DeVellis (1991, in: Asrilhant, 2001), there are several 

formats for the scale items, such as the binary and the semantic differential, which are applied in 

this study and briefly discussed here. The binary scale involves a “yes-no” format, and the semantic 

differential scales adopt a five response options.  

 

Besides obtaining relevant information, another main goal of a questionnaire design is to 

collect this information with maximum reliability and validity (Warwick and Linninger, 1975 in: 

Key, 1997), because in scientific research accuracy is of great importance. Generally, scientific 

researches measure physical attributes, to which precise values can be assigned. As this study deals 

with experts’ knowledge it is essential to remind that values assigned to mental attributes can never 

be completely precise. The related imprecision is often looked upon as being too small to be of a 

practical concern. However, the magnitude of imprecision is much greater in the measurement of 

mental attributes than in that of physical attributes. This fact turns very the determination of the 

reliability of a measuring instrument (Willmott and Nuttall, 1975 in: Key, 1997).   

• Reliability is the tendency toward consistency found in repeated measurements, as defined by 

Carmines and Zeller (1979). A reliable research instrument is the one that yields the same 

results on repeated trials. Although unreliability is always present to a certain extent, 



 

99 
 

  

consistency could be reached with the results of a quality instrument gathered at different 

times. There are three main methods for measuring the reliability of an instrument: retest, 

alternative, and internal consistent (Key, 1997). Although pilot testing increase the consistency 

of the questionnaire, two administrations of the same instrument for a small group was 

performed to compare their past and present responses allowing the measurement of a 

reliability coefficient. The retest method was applied to 20% of the previous participants, and 

the average index of reliability reached 77%, proving the questionnaire design to be reliabie; 

• Validity is the extent to which a measuring instrument measures what is supposed to measure 

and can be checked through three basic approaches: content, criterion-related and construct 

validity (Carmines and Zeller, 1979). The content validity measures the degree to which the test 

items represent the domain of the trait been measured. It is strongly suggested to use a panel of 

experts in the field to be studied to identify a content area (Key, 1997). Interviews during the 

exploratory fieldwork and the pilot testing of the questionnaire done with some experts 

contributed to checking the questionnaire’s content validity. The current questionnaire is 

believed to have sound content validity. 

The total amount of 36 questionnaires was responded by qualified experts and is reliable and 

valid for the purpose of this research project. 

 

Questionnaire Administration 

 

It is appropriated to state that obtaining a significant number of potential respondents who 

would be willing to answer the questionnaire was a critical issue in this research. As the first 

author of this paper is an expert involved for more than ten years analyzing competition and 

partnerships developed in Brazilian E&amp;amp;P acreage sales it was straightforward to establish a list of 

contact and invite qualified professionals in a wide range of companies to participate in this 

research. Some experts that are doing similar business all over the world were also contacted and 

freely accepted to contribute in both pilot test and questionnaire administration phases. 

 



 

100 
 

  

        The methods or tools chosen for knowledge capture is not a straightforward routine, and 

depend on the nature, personality and attitude of the expert and whether the expert system will be 

built around a single or multiple experts, both have advantages and limitations. In spite of a single 

or multiple expert interviews the knowledge developer should be aware of different levels of 

expertise that influence communication quality. Higher level experts generally give concise 

explanations, but often skipping vital details. Moderate level experts tend to provide detailed 

explanations, being quick to give answers. Conversely, new experts tend to offer brief, fragmented 

answers, suggesting shallow knowledge. One possibility to improve knowledge capture by the 

developer is eliciting an expert’s knowledge through concrete case situations or scenarios.  

 

In this study the choice was to capture knowledge by applying a face-to-face questionnaire 

for multiple experts with different levels of knowledge, working for a wide range of petroleum 

companies, such as international oil companies, majors, and government agencies, among others.  

 

The tactic adopted was to contact experts that have already done business together in, at 

least, one of the ten previous Brazilian E&amp;amp;P Licensing Sales. Nineteen individuals invited by 

phone calls freely accepted to contribute with this research project. Eight were also selected to 

participate in the pilot testing of the questionnaire. These experts work for different oil companies 

and hold diverse positions on the hierarchy. Acting respect and trustfully with the research project, 

they recommended other experts working inside their companies or even working for other oil 

companies and/or petroleum institutions. A total number of 36 experts responded the 

questionnaire, and five refused to participate in the research, despite their awareness of the identity 

privacy and disclosing information policy of the project. The knowledge developer built a 

hypothetic scenario, presented in the questionnaire which was, even for the different companies, 

subject to the same boundary conditions in order to narrow the possibility of widening answers.  

 

The adopted scenario considered a fixed oil price, knowing licensing date and period, and 

determined number and profile of qualified companies that could potentially bid for areas in a 

petroleum mature sedimentary basin, such as Campos Basin. Data like oil price, fiscal system, 



 

101 
 

  

among others were set fixed to avoid considering economic and political risks that could imply in 

spread responses out. 

 

The thirty-six questionnaires were grouped according to companies´ corporate structure 

(Figure 2), meaning that, out of the twenty companies surveyed, 10% of the total number of 

questionnaires was responded by Super Majors workers, 15% from American Independents, 15% 

from Public or Government Agencies, 15% from International Regional Companies, 20% from 

Brazilian Companies and 25% from International Oil Companies. 

 

Figure 2 – Distribution of the 20 petroleum companies and government entities surveyed. 

 

Figure 3 presents the distribution of respondents within the 20 petroleum companies and 

agencies. Three out of five pieces of the graphic show a percentage around 20% consultants, 

technicians and directors collaborating in this project. The smaller fraction corresponds to the 

amount of CEOs listened (11%) and the greatest proportion is represented by the managers sample 

(29%).  

 

Listening to a wide range of view points allows the knowledge developer to consider 

alternative ways of representing knowledge. An additional advantage was that scheduling a formal 

meeting frequently creates a better environment for generating thoughtful contributions. However, 

the greater the number of participants involved, the harder to retain confidentiality and get a 

consensus opinion, which could jeopardize the success of the survey. The method used to approach 



 

102 
 

  

experts was based on individuals formal meetings, believing that it could guarantee enough privacy 

to experts freely share information and answer the questionnaire, besides building up a trustful lie 

between expert and knowledge developer based on ethical behavior. The option to present the 

same questionnaire for all interviewees aims to avoid noise and uncertainties on the information 

captured granting a better translation of experts’ judgment into logic rules. Another benefit of a 

structured interview is to eliminate experts’ bias getting the same understanding through a 

standardized questionnaire, which ensures its validity and comparability. 

 

Individuals are imperfect information processors tending to form a preference for one 

outcome justifying this preference on a fair basis. This introduces to the decision making process a 

bias according to their self-interest. What should be an impartial judgment than become an 

unconscious and powerful systematic bias leading the decision making process to fail (Bazerman, 

2006). Understanding and limiting this bias in judgment could break some decision making 

patterns avoiding mistakes when taking decisions.

3.3 Building an Expert System 
 

This step of the methodology is a confirmatory investigation phase. The knowledge capture is 

the investigative experimental process, involving interviews and protocol analysis, used to build a 

knowledge automation expert system, which consists of: 

• Using an appropriate tool to elicit information from an expert – the questionnaire; 

• Interpreting the information and inferring an expert’s underlying knowledge and reasoning 
process; and 

• Using the interpretation to build the rules that represent an expert’s thought processes or 
solutions. 

Generally, academics suggest that a knowledge automation expert system aims to learn how an 

expert’s mind works and how tough problems are conceived. It is also viewed as an engineering 

approach to problem solving using rules of thumb. Psychologists believe that rely heavily on 

modeling human cognition. Such a program normally uses rules of thumb (heuristics) described as 

logical statements to capture the decision making processes of the human expert (Awad, 2003). 

 

The goal was to design a computer-based system that could capture and emulate a human 

decision making process. A machine that can work as well as a skilled human been. However, the 

distinction is that computer software can perform only that task and cannot handle new situations 

that require innovation or intuition. Expert systems tend to be more effective than other computer 

based applications, because they:  

• may combine the knowledge of many experts in a specific field; 

• can store an unlimited amount of information, and works much faster, than a human;  

• are  available 24 hours, and can be used at a distance over a network;  

• are able to explain their information requests and suggestions;  

• can process a client's uncertain responses and, by combining several pieces of uncertain 
information, may be able to make good recommendations; and 

• can accumulate the knowledge of high level employees for any company, which is  especially 
useful  when they retire or leave company.  



 

104 
 

  

Although an expert system includes several key components (Figure 4), the essential one is the 

knowledge base - an organized collection of facts, heuristics and other information on the subject 

of a system's domain. An expert system is built in a process known as knowledge engineering, 

during which knowledge about the domain is acquired essentially from human experts. The part of 

the expert system that applies the knowledge to the problem's solving is called the inference 

engine. The explanation system explains the basis for the conclusion, reached by the expert system.  

 

The intellectual editor is a tool for correction, learning or self learning of the knowledge base. 

A friendly user interface enables inexperienced users to specify problems for the system to solve 

and understand the system's conclusions. 

 

Figure 4 - Key components of an expert system based on the judgment view (knowledge-based) of 

petroleum experts on competitive in petroleum lease acreage.  

 

Aiming to verify if this methodology could be applied to estimate the level of competition for 

E&amp;amp;P acreage acquisition, a method for capture expert knowledge was developed in order to build 

an expert system. 

 

The first step to build an expert system is to identify the problem domain to be solved. If the 

problem requires years of experience and cognitive reasoning to solve, or should be considered a 

judgment maker rather than a calculation processor then, the domain is a qualified candidate for 

expert system methodology. The second one, and most important, is to capture tacit knowledge by 



 

105 
 

  

knowledge developers who should have an understanding of an expert’s level of expertise (Awad, 

2003). 

 

One of the features of a knowledge expert system is to transform information into practical 

advice. Hence, it is a powerful methodology to handle complex decision making processes, as it is 

a competitive estimation for a particular petroleum licensing. 

 

Exsys Corvid® was the computer platform elected to build the expert system. It provides tree 

structures to organize related rules, and logic blocks to organize the related trees. When 

interviewing the experts, the knowledge developer should be directly related to the amount of time 

used to capture and convert knowledge into rules that computers can use. The decision making 

logic is stated by “if/then” rules, in the same way as explaining to another person how to make a 

decision. 

 

The software applied uses an "object-structure" approach to design the system. Rules are 

defined using various types of variables that have related methods and properties, providing a wide 

range of flexibility and power. Some advantages of a full object-oriented approach are provided 

without having to understand complex programming, or describing a solution with many classes. 

This is similar to the concept used in Visual Basic, widely used and accepted. The object-

structured nature of this software allows it to provide the optimum balance between power, 

flexibility and use. 

 

The software inference engine runs the rules. It supports both backward “goal driven” and 

forward “data driven” chaining, or combinations of the two approaches. Backward chaining makes 

it particularly easy to build systems. If a system has a rule relevant to the current goal or variable, it 

will be automatically found and used by the system. All developer has to do is to add the rules 

anywhere in the system. Questions will be focused, only asking what is needed, yet never 

overlooking anything that might be relevant, combining and analyzing the user information, and 

displaying the system recommendations. Probabilistic logic ("fuzzy logic") is supported with many 

ways to combine confidence factors, allowing systems to find the "best" solution, and 



 

106 
 

  

probabilistically rank multiple possible solutions. Despite this power, the inference engine is small 

and efficient. 

 

The knowledge automated expert system built as a result of this research is valid under a 

specific scenario stated at the beginning of the questionnaire to restrict the wideness of possible 

answers and different interpretations. The assumptions adopted refer to some bidding 

characteristics, as listed in Annex 1. 

 

The creation of a knowledge base consisted in transforming an expert’s knowledge acquired 

by the questionnaire into variables and rules which allow the inference engine to run the command 

block for estimating the level of competition. A total of 14 variables was defined assuming static or 

numeric values. Some of them have their values set by the user while running the software. As it is 

an automated program, it interacts with users searching for those answers. The variables 

description, including questions made by the program, is displayed in Annex 1.  

 

These variables are used by the knowledge developer to build in the “if/then” format rules. 

Each group of rules represents a logic block built according to each aspect of the licensing should 

be under analysis. In this study, five logic blocks were built: 1) petroleum price scenario; 2) 

number and profile of competitors; 3) acreage attractiveness; 4) strategic information available; 

and 5) estimation of competition level. Annex 1 also shows the name and details for each logic 

block built. Annex 2 presents the method applied specifically to the logic block 

ESTIMA_COMPET to help the knowledge developer to structure 72 logic rules, representing all 

possible licensing cases, each of them resulting in one of the three levels of competition. 

 

Once the logic blocks are built it is imperative to structure the inference engine – a group of 

commands to perform the competition estimation. Although Awad (2003) has mentioned the use of 

backward chaining as the most applied procedure while building an expert system, this study’s 

expected results were achieved applying forward chaining. Figure 5 is the image of Exsys Corvid® 

command block constructed to estimate the level of competition for the Brazilian Licensing. This 

routine ask for both variables and logic blocks, in a sequence defined by the knowledge developer, 



 

107 
 

  

to run the software using forward rules procedures to calculate: 1) the number of competitors, 2) 

the area attractiveness, 3) the effect of strategic information over competition, and 4) the level of 

competition. Any user answering the question posed by the software can fast and easily reach the 

results.

In 1997, after almost 45 years of monopoly of petroleum E&amp;amp;P activities performed by the 

National Oil Company - Petrobras, the Brazilian Government established a new petroleum fiscal 

regime in the country. It sanctioned the Petroleum Law 9.478/97, and also created the Petroleum 

National Agency (ANP) to regulate upstream and downstream activities. ANP adopted a 

Concession Contract model to transfer E&amp;amp;P from Federal Union to oil companies. The 

Government is the subsurface natural resources´ owner and concessionaires are the production 

owners. Government take and free commercialization of the hydrocarbon produced are both 



 

108 
 

  

concessionaires´ obligations and rights. This right is one of the concession model rules that mostly 

attract the oil industry attention. 

 

Since 1999, with oil prices raising, the Brazilian Government slice of petroleum revenues has 

increased and the public debt has started its decline, positively impacting the government budget, 

reaching 0.76% of the 2006 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Figure 6). According to Santos 

(2009), this is the best criterion to evaluate the success of the new institutional system established 

by the Petroleum Law. 

 

Figure 6 - Evolution of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Government Take from petroleum 

revenues since 1994. The increasing of Government Take after 1998 reflects the change from a 

royalty tax based fiscal system to a mix of royalty, rentals, income and special participation taxes.  

 

The next section presents the results achieved when applying the methodology to the Campos 

basin licensing data base for the last 10 years of petroleum acreage lease through a Concession 

Contract model. 

 

4.1 Competition under Current Concession Contracts 

 

Define a winner offer in a Brazilian E&amp;amp;P acreage auction is not a simple task as it is for the 

most part of Concession Contracts lease sales worldwide. Up to the fourth licensing sale ANP 

transferred the rights and obligations of an area to the oil company which presented the higher 



 

109 
 

  

bonus value. Furtado (2004) detailed the method applied by ANP, the characteristics of the tenders 

and performed statistical analysis to estimate each tender index of success. From the fifth auction 

onwards, some adjustments were made to auction rules, where the establishment of a working 

program, the most relevant biddable factor, consequently reducing the bonus weight in the bidding 

process (Rodriguez &amp;amp; Suslick, 2009). 

 

The success of ANP licensing model and the political stability, fiscal incentives and low risk-

country factors lead to the promotion of two auctions for mature oilfields located onshore Brazil, 

positively impacting competition among small and national oil companies (Rodriguez et alii, 

2008). Along these ten years of acreage licensing, competition varied according to the area 

potentials, companies´ strategies, and the level of information available. Considering competition 

and the winner offers for Campos Basin, deep and shallow water areas, Furtado et alii (2008) 

presented a methodology to estimate the areas´ values that helps decision-makers define the 

bidding strategies. Focusing the same sedimentary basin, because more than 85% of Brazilian 

petroleum production come from oil and gas reservoirs found in both deep and shallow water 

areas, Rodriguez &amp;amp; Suslick (2008) made a comparison between Campos Basin areas´ values and 

US Gulf of Mexico winner offers, for the same period of time. The results achieved showed that oil 

companies bidding for Outer Continental Shelf areas are assigning a similar an amount of money to 

those spent by oil companies for deep and shallow waters acreage, while adding the total value 

committed as a minimum exploratory working program (PEM). 

 

Brazilian E&amp;amp;P acreage auctions have a different way of defining the winner offer, while 

compared to a simple bonus system applied to lease sales worldwide, where the bonus is a fraction 

of the expected monetary value (EMV) of the area. The possibility to commit PEM and local 

content, besides the signature bonus allows companies to make long term investment in the area, 

instead of committing short term cash payment. Local content accounts for 20% of the total offer 

weight and was considered irrelevant for the scope of this study. However, bonus and PEM 

account for 40% each and therefore, are a focal point defining the most competitive offer. The 

whole process of ANP licensing E&amp;amp;P areas is presented in Rodriguez &amp;amp; Suslick (2009). 

 



 

110 
 

  

Dealing with both PEM and signature bonus became essential for companies´ success, and 

competition analyses should be precisely performed to help decision-makers develop bidding 

strategies. Envisaging competition evaluation a hypothetical licensing scenario was built and 

presented through a questionnaire for experts involved with the Brazilian licensing process. The 

results of this evaluation are discussed in this section and an automated expert system was built 

allowing users to perform their own estimation of competition level for the defined scenario. For 

Brazilian licensing with different assumptions from ones listed in Annex 1, the expert system could 

not grant reliable results. It should be, therefore, adapted. 

 

According to experts’ judgment collected from the questionnaire some relevant conclusions 

can be reached in two main issues: a) what impacts the participation of a petroleum company in a 

particular tender; and b) how competition can be estimated using experts knowledge. 

 

Table 3 shows five parameters experts believe could impact the decision making of a company 

to participate or not in an auction. They were classified according to their degree of importance and 

will be discussed as a result of the experts’ opinions. Three, out of five parameters, were selected 

to build the rules of the expert system: (1) basin and areas on offer; (2) number and profile of the 

qualified companies; and (3) information about companies’ strategy (selling and buying petroleum 

assets). The expert system was run to yield estimation of the expected level of competition for four 

simulated licensing cases. Finalizing this section, some evidences confirming experts’ findings 

about the variable that has a negative impact on competition – potential changes on game rules - 

will be presented.    

 

Despite the Rodriguez et alii (2006) observation of a positive influence of the licensing 

period on the Brazilian 7th Licensing Round results when compared with international 2005 

tenders, around 45% experts pointed out the lower relevance of the tender period for competition 

evaluation (Table 3). Specialists (55%) reason according to their companies’ strategy, which focus 

Brazil for reserve replacement. These companies will bid for acreage independently of tender’s 

period promoted around the world. On the other hand, 63% of experts mentioned the impact of the 

licensing period on competitor’s participation on Brazilian lease, because they are not completely 



 

111 
 

  

aware of competitor’s strategy. Maybe Brazilian tender was considered to be one among some 

potential countries for acreage acquisition for 37% of the experts.

Almost all experts (88.6%) do believe on world petroleum prices scenarios and reserve over 

production ratio (R/P) as important criteria for competition level analyses (Table 3). The majority 

of respondents correlated the higher bids for petroleum acreage with increasing oil prices for the 

same potential acreage. This is seen as consequence of oil industry needs to enhance R/P using the 

profit from petroleum marketing as bidding budget. Chances of winning more acreage increase 

with higher bids. 

 

Regarding the areas selected by the government agency to be offered, experts were almost 

unanimous identifying this variable as the most important when evaluating competition. Knowing 

about the areas’ location makes the difference for estimating competition. If they belong to a 

mature sedimentary basin with a proved active petroleum system or to a new frontier basin, if there 

is positive results such as exploration discoveries or fields under production, and if exists flowing 

system infra-structure, besides the hydrocarbon potential of each block itself, are critical 

information for all companies. 

 



 

112 
 

  

ANP always set a minimum bonus value per block offered. Previously set as a constant value 

according to the location of the block (onshore, offshore shallow and deep water), since 2003 it 

varies according to the hydrocarbon potential of each block. Generally, blocks located in High 

Potential (EP) or in New Frontier areas have the same minimum bonus value per area, except for 

those which ANP’s technical and economic evaluation indicated higher EMV. However, expert’s 

opinion can be grouped into two classes: a) those who believe on the credibility of minimum bonus 

information of block’s geological potential (46%); and b) those that are not confident on ANP 

technical studies (54%). Figure 7 shows that while requested to estimate competition considering 

the existence of blocks with high minimum bonuses, 52% of experts stated that this information 

does not impact their competitive analyses if blocks are located in EP areas. Therefore, almost 63% 

of the experts considered that information to have a negative impact, reducing the level of 

competition for the blocks in new frontier areas. These results can be explained by companies´ risk 

aversion. When bidding for areas located on EP areas, companies are more confident on their own 

geologic and economic evaluation, and are aware of the petroleum system and production facilities, 

which may reduce their financial exposure. Contrarily, in new frontier areas where geological 

uncertainties and technological challenges should be first solved, companies prefer not to bid for 

blocks with high minimum bonuses values to avoid a winner’s curse. 

 

According to experts’ opinion, mapping qualified companies’ strategies and behavior are 

very important variables for competition estimation (see Table 3 for reference). Evaluating the 

bidding history of each company can help the identification of potential competitors. This is 

reinforced by analyzing companies’ behavior of buying and selling petroleum assets in the basin, in 

Brazil or worldwide. For example, one company that has never bided for Campos Basin bought its 

geological and geophysical data or acquired working interest by faming out. This potential non- 

competitor (SPC) - a company that is familiar with Brazilian licensing, but have never bid for 

Campos Basin - has an increasing interest for the basin, according to around 90% of specialists, but 

only little percentage believes SPC will not present an offer (Table 4). On the other hand, if a 

company is a well known potential competitor (CC), meaning companies that usually bid for the 

basin, although 50% of experts pointed out the increasing interest for the basin, and 40% stated 

that CC participation on the licensing is unpredictable.

Besides companies´ activities on acquiring and selling acreage previous to a bid round, it is 

elementary to analyze companies´ international strategies, financial health and reserve figures. The 

questionnaire asked specialists about three different companies SPC, CC and NE – a company that 

has never bided in Brazil and is not used to the Brazilian fiscal system (Table 5). Regarding SPC 

profile, 43% of the experts stated they prefer to monitor its behavior and they do not expect SPC as 

a strong competitor with aggressive offers. However, respondents consider very important mapping 

NE, because although not knowing its strategy, they do believe in an unexpected aggressive 

bidding or in a strategic alliance with a potential competitor (CC). 

 



 

114 
 

  

Companies, despite of being SPC, CC or NE, could bid alone or in consortia according to 

their bidding strategies. Sunnevåg (2000) and Saidi &amp;amp; Marsden (1992) analyzed 40 years sales data 

bank of Outer Continental Shelf (US-GOM) and revealed that companies associate among 

themselves to share information and investments. So, consortium formation reduces risk of 

financial loss and aggregates geological knowledge, enhancing the possibility a consortium has to 

win acreage.

COMPANIES’ PROFILE VERY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT NO IMPORTANT 

CC 83% 17% 0%

When argued about this issue, 80% of experts indicated that companies also associate to 

avoid competition, besides the two above mentioned reasons. In Brazilian petroleum leases the 

number of players and the number of acreage offered differ by one order of magnitude when 

compared to US-GOM leases (Rodriguez &amp;amp; Suslick, 2008), which is a possible explanation. The 

low availability of acreage leads companies to jointly bid reducing the number of potential 

competitors, as well as enhancing their possibility to win some area.  

 

Trying to understand how companies estimate competition in a situation where competitors 

associate to bid, a set of specific questions were made: 

 a) Specialists were argued about how they classify information on companies’ strategies for 

a licensing. According to Figure 8, it is remarkable that information given by decision-makers is 

classified as very important (83%), suggesting that companies rely each other. This is reinforced by 

69% experts, who consider “important” all information disclosed by companies’ representatives 

other than decision makers. If information is obtained from newspaper, specialized magazines, 

among others, respondents split their opinion between “less important” (43%) to “not relevant” 

(34%), although 23% still grade as important. The explanation stands on the source of information, 



 

115 
 

  

i.e., news given by a trustful person or entity should be taken into account, otherwise is rumor, as 

well as those coming from comments raised during the licensing period. 

b) Specialists were invited to play a game for estimating competition in a scenario where 

information was released by newspapers, the acreage is the same for all cases, and are offered 

according to the same rules. Table 6 shows the outcomes for five different cases reflecting experts’ 

judgments on competition estimation when companies bid jointly. 

 

Figure 8 - Expert’s evaluation by information source. An information gave by a decision-maker is 

very important when compared with some extracted from a newspaper, for example, which is 

considered irrelevant by 34% experts.

Cases 1 to 3 are scenarios of high competition and specialist’s company is assumed to 

participate in all bids. Nevertheless, Case 2 splits expert’s opinion into high and moderate. This 

can be explained by the association of the specialist’s company with another CC, reducing 

competition as per the experts’ perception. From their point of view, as their company is jointly 

bidding with a CC they assess more information and enhance budget, mitigating competition and 

becoming a stronger competitor.  

 

Cases 4 and 5 deal with situation where newcomers and non-competitors profile, 

respectively, are also players in the bidding game. Both cases present the same conditions such as 

number of companies, consortia and offers, differing exclusively by the presence of a NE (Case 4) 

and SPC (Case 5). Experts consider a consortium formed between a CC and a NE to be a stronger 

competitor than another formed between CC and SPC. They estimate competition as moderate to 

high for Case 4 (57%) and 74% of specialists indicate an essentially moderate competition for Case 

5, when a SPC associates with any other company. This observation is in accordance to specialists´ 

opinion on SPC relevance as a player in Brazilian licensing, as previously expressed. 

 

The game, above described, directly revealed experts’ estimation of competition for a 

particular licensing scenario when there is information regarding consortium formation. 

 

Another set of questions retrieved valuable data on experts’ knowledge, later on treated to 

build the automated computer program able to infer the expected level of competition for a specific 

petroleum lease. The Corvid® Expert System resulting from this research, i.e., considering expert’s 

judgment on a variety of issues concerning historical Brazilian licensing, proved to be a powerful 

tool for non-specialists interested in analyzing competition in tenders with characteristics similar to 

those mentioned in Annex 1. Software outcomes for four bidding cases are presented in Table 7. 

 

In Case 1 user is willing to investigate competition for a lease sale with eight qualified 

companies competing with the user’s company. Four of them are potential competitors (CC), two 

newcomers (NE) and two companies with non-competitor profile (SPC). User’s company is 



 

117 
 

  

interested in bidding for blocks located in high potential sector and close to areas with recent 

exploratory successful results (variable EXPSUC_EP = yes). Recently it was announced some 

hydrocarbon discoveries in the basin, then the variable DESCBAC was set as “yes”. The results 

achieved for CASE 1 revealed a high plus number of competitors, area of very high attractiveness, 

release of strategic information that stimulates competition, leading to an estimation of a High 

competition. 

 

Cases 2 and 3 show two different licensing bid simulations, presenting the same estimation 

result - a Moderate level of competition. For Case 2, there were three potential competitors 

companies (CC) and one newcomer (NE), besides the user’s company, aiming to bid for blocks 

close to the ring fence of oilfields located in high potential areas (RFDP_EP=yes). The third 

variable that lead expert system to estimates a moderate competition was the information about a 

recent discovery in a similar play, but in another basin under evaluation by user’s company 

(DESCPLAY=yes). Despite the fact that the release of strategic information stimulates competition 

(DESCBAC=yes) in both cases, what differs Case 2 from Case 3 is the number of competitors - 

Medium level for Case 2 and Medium Minus for Case 3 (1 SPC, 2 NE and 2 CC), and the 

attractiveness of the area, which is High for Case 2 and Median for Case 3, due to the existence of 

recent results of exploratory success in new frontier areas (EXPSUC_NF=yes). 

 

The last case, Case 4, presents the bidding conditions for a Low level of competition, which 

is reached whenever the area has low attractiveness and the number of competitors is medium 

minus. It means, the block user’s company is interested in evaluating competition is located in a 

new frontier area close to ring fences of oilfields (RFDP_NF=yes) and there is no potential 

competitors (CC) qualified for the licensing round, with only 1 SPC and 3 NE.                                                                                                                                                                                 

 

This study revealed positive aspects on a petroleum lease sale that could impact competition, 

and the area attractiveness was unanimously pointed out as the most impacting parameter to attract 

companies’ attention. Nevertheless, there was one question addressed to specialists dedicated to 

assess if there was any issue they recognize as of a negative impact on lease tenders.

Table 8 shows that, despite the attractiveness of the acreage on sale potential changes on 

game rules are enough to create a risky environment for exploration investment. What experts do 

remark as strongly impacting the participation of any oil company, more than the possible 

presence of potential competitors or newcomers, is the Brazilian fiscal and legal environment for 

performing E&amp;amp;P activities. Any changes made by the Government on the fiscal system, the 

regulatory framework, or to the licensing rules, could immediately cause a retraction on 

companies’ intention to participate.

The Brazilian petroleum lease history data presents unusual results regarding companies 

bidding for acreage on the 5th Licensing Round that could be assumed as an example of that 

expert perception. Rodriguez &amp;amp; Suslick (2009) pointed out that only three oil companies, 

amongst the eighties used to participate in Brazilian auctions, made offers in that licensing round 

characterizing a low competitive bid. These authors correlated this with: a) the changes on the 

fiscal system (Noel and Valentin Laws), and b) the new licensing model approved by ANP, which 

introduced new criteria to define the winner offer, and changed some technical concepts (PEM as 

biddable factor, area size, relinquishment policies, exploration phase duration, among others). 

 

Although these changes have negatively impacted competition on the 5th Licensing Round, 

the oil industry reacted positively, returning to the game in the following leases. This behavior 

can be assigned to the success of the petroleum exploration activities observed then. Some 

constrains established for the 8th licensing round, so as the number of area acquired by the same 

operator, caused its suspension sine die. Just before starting the 9th Bid Round, ANP withdrew 



 

 

  

120 
 

from the auction portfolio areas with subsalt potentials after Tupi wildcatd results (Berman, 

2008). These unstable procedures promoted a revision on the current auction model. 

The Petroleum Law 9478/97, in force for over 10 years, proved that auctioning acreage through 

Concession Contract agreements is a model that stimulated high risk investments in a period 

when oil prices raised from US$12,00/bbl to US$130,00/bbl. This investment in petroleum 

exploration lead to oil and gas field discoveries, such as Tupi - a super-giant oilfield - located in 

deep water Santos Basin, with pre-salt reserves estimated from 5 to 8 Billion boe (Berman, 2008). 

 

Recently, in the same geologic play and region, a series of similar potential oilfields were 

discovered, leading Brazilian proved reserves from 14.2 Billion boe to a total reserve estimated 

from 70 to 100 Billion boe. These discoveries opened a new oil frontier, motivating the Federal 

Government to review the petroleum regulatory policy to protect Brazilian oil and gas reserves. 

The proposal considers changing from Concession Contracts licensing to a Production Sharing 

Contracts, for all acreage to be licensed in areas where the pre-salt horizons occur. 

 

4.2. Competition Expectation under Production Sharing Contracts 

Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) is a petroleum exploration licensing system conceived by 

the oil industry to have the rights and obligations to explore attractive acreage in high risk 

countries, such as those located in Asia and Africa. Based on sharing all oil and gas produced 

from an area, it is a competitive licensing process as the Concession Contract.  

 

Almost all petroleum contracts in effect worldwide provide for Government Take to be a mix 

of financial revenues and production entitlement. As shown in Figure 9, countries adopt different 

contract models the most commom being PSC and Concession Contracts. Europe and particularly 

USA have more open systems for the E&amp;amp;P activity. Middle East is the most protectionist region. 

One of the most common legal arrangements between a Government (or its National Oil 

Company - NOC) and a private company is the PSC. The main difference between Concessions 

and PSC Contracts is that under the former the Company is entitled to the hydrocarbons before or 



 

 

  

121 
 

upon them being produced (Johnston, 1994). Table 9 presents more details on both models of 

contracts.  

 

Figure 9 - Map with the countries that promote licensing of exploration acreage applying 

Concession Contract and Production Sharing Contract models. 

 

Although Brazil has been successful in differentiating itself from its Latin America 

neighbors, a new regime is to be introduced through amendments to the existing Petroleum law 

(Law 9478/97), the creation of a National Oil Company (Pré Sal Petróleo S.A. - PPSA), and a 

Social Fund at a Federal level. This new legal framework should be applied exclusively to the 

pre-salt areas, being the remaining onshore and the offshore shallow or deepwater areas subject to 

the current regime. 

As this new licensing model is still under discussion and the associated regulatory policy is 

essentially different from that applied for the well known Concession Contract rules, listening to 

the oil industry experts about their perceptions on the expected level of competition for the new 

licensing model was very opportune.

All 36 experts were unanimous in referring to PSC as a familiar contract model that could 

be applied for pre-salt areas with no major effect on the contractors’ side. They recognized that 

this licensing program, theoretically, is as competitive as the concession contracts in force. 



 

 

  

123 
 

Among the interviewees, some reported that majors and super majors are used to explore in 

countries with PSC licensing agreements, and are familiar to Brazilian political and economic 

culture - once they are concessionaires of E&amp;amp;P Brazilian assets – will comfortably deal with the 

regulatory changes, and consequently, continue to compete for the pre-salt acreage. On the other 

hand, independents and regional companies should bid in a more conservative way or make a 

tight sensitivity risk analysis indicating not to present an offer in the bid process. 

 

The last question of the questionnaire was created to cover this subject. Although a 

multiple-choice question, with two "yes" and two "no" options, participants were encouraged to 

give their opinion regarding what is expected in terms of competition after changing the licensing 

policy. 

 

The statistics obtained during this enquire is shown in Figure 10. Sixty-four percent of 

experts (64%) believe that this change will reduce the level of competition, but 20% do not see 

any impact. Both 8% figures reflect a percentage of experts that prefer not to respond the question 

and those which state that there are some aspects of the policy that could motivate companies to 

compete and others that could promote the opposite effect. It means that most part (64%) believes 

in a negative impact reducing the level of competition, but 20% do not see any impact. A small 

group of experts (8%) states that the policy could motivate companies to compete or to decline 

offer. The remaining eight percent (8%) represents experts that prefer not to respond the question.

change on the current licensing policy.  



 

 

  

124 
 

 

Regarding the “no” responses (20%), all experts but one, indicate the high potential of pre-

salt areas as the main factor to keep competition at similar levels of such observed in previous 

concession contracts bids. One expert believes in the maintenance of competition level because 

these changes do not significantly affect companies´ interest even when loosing rights to oil 

property and having a maximum working interest limited to 70%.  

 

In respect of the “yes” answers, which account for 64%, most of the respondents expect a 

change on the level of competition with the approval of the amendments on the Petroleum Law 

currently in force, implementing the PSC as the licensing model for the pre-salt areas. 

Nevertheless, among these experts it is possible to group participants with different opinions.  

 

Within 64%, only 10% of the experts believe on the reduction on competition due to 

restriction for hydrocarbon production entitlement to companies. Despite the majority not expects 

lack of transparency in the conduction of PSC licensing agreement among Brazilian Government 

and petroleum companies, twenty percent (20%) of the “yes” population related this negative 

aspect with a possible impact on competition level. Their opinion are supported by Cramtom 

(2005) who reported that PSCs are often associated to lack of transparency, because the 

negotiations between the Principal and each Contractor or Consortium while selling E&amp;amp;P assets 

are developed in different occasions. However, what reinforces the majority of participants not 

expecting any kind of collusion and/or corruption in the process of selling areas within the new 

legal framework is ANP´s ability in sale E&amp;amp;P acreage for the past 10 years under clear rules 

previously established, and Brazilian stable fiscal system. 

 

The large majority (70%) of oil industry representatives interviewed agreed that a change 

from a Concession Contract model to a Production Sharing is definitely not the issue when 

analyzing competition. What really could impact the level of expected competition are the rules 

adopted for the PSC structure. They are mainly concerned with two aspects of the new regulatory 

policy: 1) the power delegated to PPSA, the company proposed to be the NOC in the PSC model, 

and 2) the designation of Petrobras, a Brazilian state company which had the monopoly to 



 

 

  

125 
 

perform E&amp;amp;P activities in Brazil for around 45 years, as the sole operator for all acreage to be 

licensed under the PSC rules. 

 

Among the four amendments seeking for congress approval, the creation of a NOC – PPSA, 

which has privileges on the voting procedure for both technical and operational decisions, is 

pointed out as the detrimental aspect of the process. Moreover, another key issue raised by 

experts is the establishment of Petrobras as the unique operator of all pre-salt areas to be licensed. 

A quick wrap-up of the judgment of the 33 experts giving opinion on such subject (Figure 11), 

lead to the conclusion that Brazilian Government intention to change the licensing model, 

envisaging strategic protection of the pre-salt high oil volumes zone, is acceptable by 77% of all 

upstream companies currently searching for oil and gas offshore Brazil.  

 

 

Figure 11 - Graphic showing total 33 "yes" and "no" answers on policy changes on the current 

licensing model. "No" answers (23%) are related to the high potential pre-salt areas and to the 

working interest limited to 70%, as proposed by PSC rules. The "yes" answers (77%) as per 

expert’s opinion are associated with hydrocarbon entitlement and lack of transparency, and 

mainly with the voting procedure and unique operatorship. 



 

 

  

126 
 

 

However, the establishment of rules that could prevent them to fully operate E&amp;amp;P assets 

and voting against or in accordance with the consortium decisions, without the interference of a 

purely administrative company, as PPSA is supposed to be, could significantly impact the 

competition level, as perceived by experts. 

 

5. Conclusions 

 

Analyzing competition in a petroleum lease sale is not an easy task, and this is the reason 

why the literature to generally consider its existence as an assumption for mathematical models 

developed to define optimal bids, such that maximize revenues in a simple bonus bidding system. 

However, Brazilian licensing model is more complex and besides bonus, deal with both working 

program and local content as biddable factors. So, defining the optimal bid becomes more 

complicated, pushing companies to do a better job while evaluating competition, and helping 

decision-makers find suitable bidding strategies.  

 

This study targets to understand how oil companies’ representatives, used to participate in 

Brazilian lease, perceive competition, and also build a practical tool that could estimate the 

expected level of competition in a Brazilian tender. 

   

The first objective was reached by the development of a questionnaire applied to 36 

specialists from 20 oil companies and governmental entities to investigate specialists’ opinion 

about competition. Questions were formulated using a database built based on ANP results in the 

last eight licensing rounds in which Campos Basin acreage was offered. This method proved to be 

effective in assessing experts judgment on the main licensing variables that directly impact the 

decision making process. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that limitations on 

intelligence and perception constrain the ability of decision-makers to accurately calculate the 

optimal choice from the available information (Bazerman, 2006). The main conclusions of the 

current research project are the following: 



 

 

  

127 
 

• The questionnaire successfully captured experts knowledge and is robust enough to allow a 

comprehensive understanding in how specialists mind deal with technical data, strategic 

information and licensing rules to estimate competition; 

• There is no bias observed on the questionnaires answers neither per specialists business 

position nor for their companies profile. This can be correlated to past professionals 

experience of the interviewed team; 

• According to 94% of the assessed experts, what grants the success of a petroleum lease sale is 

the quality of the auctioned asset. High potential areas attract competitors interest.  Since the 

80’s Brazil is discovering giant to super-giant oilfields, attracting oil industry attention to 

Brazilian hydrocarbon potential acreage (Moraes Jr et al., 2004). This is confirmed by the 

high levels of competition for assets located at Campos Basin as shown by Furtado et al. 

(2008), exception made for the 5th Licensing Round;  

• What do really cause a negative impact reducing competition are uncertainties, not those 

related to acreage, but to the policies, as happened during the year of the 5th tender. An 

unstable fiscal system or a licensing process conducted without transparency is unanimously 

identified by industry representatives as key  that reduce the success of a bid round; 

• Almost all interviewees indicated high level of competition for acreage located in high 

potential areas or even in new frontiers, since they are prospectively sit on a sedimentary 

basin with active petroleum system, and have production flowing systems available close by;  

• More than 90% of respondents, the proper evaluation on qualified companies characteristics 

(strategies, budgets, exploration portfolio, etc), which is crucial for a calibrated competition 

estimation. Experts stated they should be aware of potential competitors (CC) movement, i.e., 

companies that usually bid in Brazil for mature basins where they already perform E&amp;amp;P 

activities and are qualified for the round. Companies that have never bided in the country, i.e. 

newcomers (NE), meaning not being familiar with ANP and Brazilian policies, prefer to 

associate with CC to avoid losing the bid if they make offers alone and based only in the 

symmetric information they acquired from ANP database. On the other hand, companies used 

to bid in Brazilian tenders, but acquired data for a mature basin where they never bid before 

(SPC), do not demand experts attention. They do not expect SPCs competing against CCs, 



 

 

  

128 
 

which has asymmetric information, but farming into opportunities in the basin, other than 

effectively participating in the licensing. 

 

The second goal was accomplished by the development of an automated expert system, using 

Corvid® platform, which works with a knowledge database build from experts’ judgment on 

competition issues that were transformed into rules. It proved to be an efficient tool, as per the 

findings obtained for the four theoretical cases implemented on the software. The expert system 

was able to properly estimate the level of competition level expected for each case, showing 

coherent outcomes when run by non-specialists. Users must be aware that this expert system was 

developed for Brazilian lease of Campos Basin acreage in a period of time when average oil price 

was US$40,00/bbl. Results may vary according to the assumptions adopted. 

 

The last conclusion refers to a current discussion about the newly proposed regulatory 

licensing policy. As shown by this study, competition granted the success of licensing promoted 

by ANP under the Concession Contract model. For licensing acreage under Production Sharing 

Contract model, specialists (64%) expect an impact in competition level due to the rules adopted 

by the government and not because of the model. PSC is a well known model applied in many 

countries worldwide, which facilitates the bid for companies familiar with its rules. In Brazil, 

experts pointed out two main reasons for reducing competition: a) the decision to have 

PETROBRAS as the unique operator for all acreage licensed, and b) the voting procedures for the 

NOC (Pré-Sal) who can reject both technical and economic issues. If the regulatory changes are 

approved as is, then competition level may be affected.

CRITERIA USED TO DEFINE CUT-OFFS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF 

COMEPTITION ACCORDING TO ALL POSSIBLE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN 

NUM_COMPETIDORES, ATRATIVIDADE_AREA AND INFO_ESTARTEGICA 

VARIABLES 

 

The questionnaire first answer was used to classify and prioritize the variables that should 

be applied to estimate the level of competition. Three variables, among the five listed on Table 10 

and, as suggested by the literature, were selected to perform competition analyses. Setting values 

to: a) the degree of importance of basin and area on offer; b) number and profile of qualified 

companies; and c) to companies’ strategic information variables, was possible to calculate 

weights for these variables. The next step consisted in giving notes for each variable value, as 

seen on Table 11. A competition scale was defined multiplying weights per grades for each of the 

72 licensing cases (possibilities to combine the three variables), as shown on Table 12.

respectively. The cut-off parameters that limit low competition level situation to moderate and 

from moderate to high are 15.5 and 22.5, respectively. These cut-offs, when applied to each 

licensing case, allow the estimation of the level of competition (Table C).

These ranges of competition supported mapping the viable licensing cases reducing 

knowledge developer work when building knowledge base rules on CORVID® expert system. 

Combination such as NUM_COMPET = high, ATRAT_AREA = high and INFO_ESTRAT = 

stimulate, do not affect perception and do not stimulate (5 – 4 – 3/2/1), presents the same 

expected level of competition, independent on the value of INFO_ESTRAT. Then, whenever a 

variable does not contribute for changing the result of expected level of competition, the 

combination was written as a single rule on the logic block ESTIMA_COMPET. 

 

Some theoretical licensing cases do not represent real situation, as per experts judgments, 

such as NUM_COMPET = Plus high, ATRAT_AREA = median and INFO_ESTRAT = stimulate 

(6 – 3 – 3). In this specific example, a situation of ATRAT_AREA = median can only occur when 



 

 

  

147 
 

NUM_COMPET is equal to Low, Medium Minus or Medium Plus (1 – 3 – 3 or 2 – 3- 3 or 4 – 3 

– 3). Once identified these cases, the corresponding rules were cut from the logic block 

ESTIMA_COMPET. The final structure and rules of the logic block are presented next.

7. CONCLUSÕES E RECOMENDAÇÕES 

Dentre os fatores que atestam o sucesso das licitações de áreas para exploração e produção 

(E&amp;amp;P) de petróleo no Brasil destacam-se a qualificação de um número elevado de companhias, 

que implica em competição pelas áreas, e a qualidade do portfólio exploratório ofertado que, com 

suas conseqüentes descobertas de hidrocarbonetos, atrai o interesse dessas companhias. Aliados a 

esses fatores, o baixo risco-país, a existência de um regime fiscal estável e a clareza nas regras 

das licitações promovidas pela ANP, propiciaram um ambiente mais seguro para os investimentos 

das empresas de petróleo de pequeno, médio e grande porte, gerando benefícios ao País, tais 

como o desenvolvimento de setores da indústria do petróleo e o recolhimento de participações 

governamentais, dentre outros tributos. 

O modelo de licitação competitivo selado adotado pela ANP é considerado eficiente e 

difere da maioria das licitações internacionais por prover ao governo: a) receitas “upfront” 

decorrentes do pagamento de bônus para aquisição de área; b) informações sobre as 

características geológicas das áreas e seu potencial petrolífero, resultante das atividades 

exploratórias, e comprometidas pelas companhias, como o Programa Exploratório Mínimo 

(PEM); e c) o desenvolvimento da indústria nacional a partir da oferta de um percentual de 

contratação de bens e serviços domésticos para a execução das atividades de E&amp;amp;P.  

Em todas as dez licitações de áreas exploratórias e nas duas licitações de áreas inativas com 

acumulações marginais observam-se movimentos de cooperação, com a formação de parcerias 

para dividir os riscos técnicos e financeiros, reduzindo, assim, o número de competidores – e 

movimentos de competição entre as firmas - onde a companhia detentora de informação 

assimétrica possui uma vantagem competitiva em relação às demais na disputa pela aquisição de 

uma área.

Historicamente, analisando as ofertas para as áreas da Bacia de Campos, é possível observar 

os comportamentos de cooperação e competição entre as companhias. Nas áreas de maior 

potencial geológico e nas chamadas de “golden blocks”, as companhias tendem a realizar ofertas 

associadas entre si e a oferecer valores próximos a um (1,0), que são muito maiores que as 

frações do valor monetário esperado (VME) que a literatura recomenda como oferta ótima (0,3) 

para enfrentar a competição. Para essas áreas, quantificar o “dinheiro deixado sobre a mesa” ou 

considerar a possível “maldição do vencedor” são dados sem valor para as próprias empresas e 

para a ANP, sendo apenas uma informação que revela o grau de aversão ao risco das empresas: 

alto risco x alto prêmio x alto investimento. Entretanto, para ofertas realizadas para as áreas de 

potencial geológico médio e baixo, o modelo de simulação estocástico construído mostrou ser 

uma ferramenta robusta para auxiliar os decisores na definição do bônus ótimo. A estimativa do 

valor de VME/km2 permite as firmas elaborarem ofertas competitivas para o bloco de seu 

interesse, em um cenário de alta volatilidade de preços de petróleo e incertezas nos determinantes 

do mercado. De acordo com a simetria entre os valores de VME/km2 efetivamente realizados e os 

estocasticamente simulados pode-se concluir que quanto maior o número de competidores, 

maiores os valores de VME/km2 ofertados pelas companhias, em situações em que há simetria de 

informações. Quando há assimetria, apesar de não ter sido objeto desta pesquisa, observou-se que 

as companhias menos informadas, em geral, realizam poucas ofertas, porém são mais agressivas 

nos valores apresentados. Esta metodologia pode revelar a expectativa exploratória das 

companhias, como verificado nas licitações da Bacia de Campos, tornando visível seu 

comportamento em termos de estratégias de oferta, alocação financeira de recursos e formação de 

consórcios com suas preferências. O modelo estocástico proposto pode ser aplicado para áreas em 

outras bacias, mesmo que localizadas fora do Brasil, desde que licitadas sob um modelo 

competitivo selado. 

Observando-se que os valores pagos pelas firmas para as áreas da Bacia de Campos eram, 

por vezes, elevados, efetuou-se uma análise comparativa entre estas ofertas e as realizadas pelas 

empresas para áreas do Golfo do México Americano (US-GOM), com o intuito de quantificar o 

interesse das empresas no Brasil. As licitações escolhidas para análise, realizadas em 2004 e 

2005, consideraram a existência de um mesmo cenário de preços de petróleo e potencial 

geológico das áreas. Mesmo o US-GOM, atraindo o interesse de um número de companhias de 



 

 

  

151 
 

três a quatro vezes maior que no Brasil, e tendo um número de áreas ofertadas entre 200 e 400% 

maior que o montante de áreas ofertadas no Brasil, identificou-se que as empresas oferecem o 

dobro do valor por unidade de área para as áreas de águas profundas brasileiras. Em 2004, as 

empresas pagaram US$55.000,00/km2 para as áreas localizadas em lâmina d´água superior a 

400m de profundidade e US$25.000,00/km2 em áreas semelhantes do US-GOM. Em 2005 estes 

valores foram US$160.000,00/km2 contra US$80.000,00/km2, respectivamente. Ressalta-se que, 

para as áreas do US-GOM os valores são obtidos dividindo o bônus de assinatura pelo total de 

área arrematada com esses bônus. Para as ofertas brasileiras esses números foram calculados 

adicionando ao bônus, o montante comprometido como PEM, após converter as unidades de 

trabalho (UT) em valores monetários. Tais números confirmam a atratividade da Bacia de 

Campos, e do Brasil, no cenário mundial de oportunidades exploratórias, atraindo assim, os 

investimentos da indústria do petróleo. 

Entretanto, para as companhias realizarem esses investimentos e adquirirem as áreas que 

atendem ao seu portfólio exploratório, ou seja, aquelas que podem maximizar suas receitas, além 

da valoração técnica e econômica da área, se faz necessária uma avaliação rigorosa do nível de 

competição esperado. 

Para estimar o nível de competição, construiu-se um sistema especialista cujo insumo foi 

um questionário desenvolvido para capturar o conhecimento de 36 especialistas que atuam como 

técnicos, gerentes, consultores, diretores e presidentes em 20 companhias de petróleo de pequeno, 

médio e grande porte. Tal questionário propiciou ainda, conhecer como as companhias lidam com 

as informações técnicas, regulatórias e estratégicas para estimar a competição, além de permitir a 

quantificação das variáveis que impactam a competição nos modelos licitatórios de concessão e 

de partilha de produção. 

Para 94% dos entrevistados o que mais estimula a competição é a qualidade das áreas 

oferecidas pela ANP, ou seja, a oferta de áreas de elevado potencial geológico localizadas em 

bacias sedimentares com sistema petrolífero ativo e dispondo de infraestrutura para escoamento 

da produção de petróleo e gás natural sugere elevada competição. Por unanimidade, o que 



 

 

  

152 
 

negativamente impacta a competição são incertezas do tipo regime fiscal instável e/ou falta de 

transparência nas regras da licitação. 

 O perfil estratégico, financeiro e exploratório das companhias qualificadas nas licitações, 

bem como seu histórico de atuação no Brasil (compra e venda de ativos de E&amp;amp;P) foi identificado 

por 90% dos especialistas como sendo a segunda mais importante variável de impacto na 

estimativa de competição. Ao se analisar a competição para as áreas de elevado potencial e de 

novas fronteiras da Bacia de Campos, 83% dos especialistas indicaram como potenciais 

competidoras (CC) as companhias qualificadas atuantes no país e que já possuem exposição 

exploratória na bacia. Entretanto, companhias qualificadas que atuam no Brasil, mas que nunca 

apresentaram oferta para esta bacia, foram consideradas por 46% dos especialistas como sem 

perfil de competidoras (SPC) por disporem apenas de informações simétricas, ou seja, aquelas 

que qualquer empresa pode adquirir do banco de dados da ANP. Segundo 14% dos especialistas, 

as companhias conhecidas como novas entrantes (NE), i.e., aquelas que nunca participaram de 

uma licitação brasileira, preferem competir em associação com as CC para terem acesso a 

informações privilegiadas (assimétricas) sobre a bacia, que lhes garanta uma vantagem 

competitiva. 

Essas percepções, adquiridas através do questionário, foram transformados em regras para a 

construção de um sistema especialista, utilizando a plataforma Exsys Corvid®, capaz de estimar 

o nível de competição para áreas da Bacia de Campos em um cenário de preço de petróleo pré-

estabelecido a US$40,00/bbl. 

A simulação de quatro casos teóricos em que se variou: 1) o tipo de área em oferta, 2) o 

número e o tipo de companhias qualificadas, 3) a existência ou não de informações sobre campos 

em produção, descobertas de petróleo na bacia ou em plays análogos, e 4) a estabilidade do 

sistema fiscal e regulatório, mostrou resultados coerentes. Além da estimativa robusta do nível de 

competição, outra vantagem da ferramenta desenvolvida é sua interatividade que permite a 

qualquer usuário não especialista nas licitações brasileiras, através de respostas a perguntas pré-

estabelecidas, conhecer o nível de competição para a área que deseja avaliar. 



 

 

  

153 
 

Por fim, questionados sobre o impacto da nova regulamentação do setor petróleo na 

competição pelas áreas do pré-sal, 64% dos especialistas acreditam em uma diminuição na 

competição, não pelo modelo de Partilha de Produção adotado, pois este é mundialmente 

reconhecido como válido, apesar de ser considerado pouco transparente, mas sim pelas regras 

estipuladas que conferem à Petrobras a operação exclusiva das áreas licitadas, e o poder de veto à 

companhia estatal - Pré Sal Petróleo S.A..  

Como recomendações para trabalhos futuros sugere-se: a) desenvolver novos questionários 

que possam capturar o julgamento dos especialistas em licitações brasileiras com relação ao 

cenário de preço de petróleo variável e a competição em bacias terrestres, por exemplo; b) 

incorporar as consequentes respostas desses novos questionários ao sistema especialista existente,  

ampliando seu escopo, de forma a estimar o nível de competição em outras bacias brasileiras, ou 

outras licitações mundiais, ou sob quaisquer modelos regulatórios onde exista a competição; e c) 

desenvolver modelos com base na teoria dos jogos visando definir estratégias de oferta mais 

competitivas que usam bônus e PEM, para as licitações brasileiras considerando as metodologias 

aqui desenvolvidas de valoração da área e de estimativa de competição.
