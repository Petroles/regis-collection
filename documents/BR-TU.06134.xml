Não agradeço: 
 
Ao Conselho Directivo da Faculdade Ciências de Lisboa (CD/FCUL)  
 
 
Por sacrificar os doutorandos com propinas claramente inflacionadas face ao serviço 

prestado, propinas essas que não são investidas na melhoria das condições para o 

desenvolvimento de ciência, mas sim para pagar despesas correntes.  

 

Pela má informação prestada relativamente a alguns assuntos que dizem respeito ao 

programa doctoral, com grave prejuízo para os doutorandos.  

 

A FCUL deveria não só formar e inovar, mas também promover o humanismo e a boa 

relação entre todos que aí trabalham, investigam, ensinam e estudam. E isso não 

aconteceu na relação entre o CD e os doutorandos.  

 

Esta postura do CD está a desvincular doutorandos da FCUL e dos seus centros de 

investigação.

Abstract 

_____________________________________________________ 

The European wildcat Felis silvestris is a threatened species in Europe, where suitable 

management of forests has been considered crucial for its conservation. However, this 

recommendation may not be general due to the lack of studies that test this hypothesis 

in the Mediterranean area, where landscapes are very different from those of central-

north Europe. Nowadays, the European wildcat is distributed in Europe in a number of 

fragmented populations threatened by destruction of their natural habitats, persecution 

and crossbreeding with free-ranging domestic feral cats. The conservation of wildcat in 

the constantly changing, human-altered landscapes of Southern Iberia requires therefore 

a clear understanding of the species limits and capabilities in these environments. My 

thesis focused on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by human-

related activities. In natural areas the wildcat constrains are link to human actions and 

activities. First step was to build a model that incorporates the advantages of correlative 

and mechanistic models to develop large-scale determinants that express the local 

individual requirements for wide range wildcat distribution. The results obtained 

suggest the importance of small mammals as prey for the species, as well the negative 

influence of human disturbance. Human disturbance is reflected in changes in the land 

use, direct persecution and the expansion and dimension of domestic cat populations. 

The presence of domestic species in natural areas often represent a conservation 

problem due to competition with and predation of wild species, because they act as 

reservoirs for many diseases and even due to the potential hybridization with the wild 

ancestor types. The impact of domestic cats depends on where they can be found and on 

the factors controlling their numbers and space use. In this Thesis were described the 

patterns of presence, abundance, spatial behaviour and human constraints (food 

resources) associated to domestic cats. Human activities and domestic cat population 

structure, that implies different scenarios for wildcat conservation, were discussed in the 

last Chapter of this Thesis.  

Key-words: domestic cat Felis catus, European wildcat Felis silvestris, People and cats 

distribution, wildcat conservation

Resumo 

_____________________________________________________ 

Nas últimas décadas verificou-se uma preocupação crescente com as questões 

ambientais globais, resultantes da degradação do meio ambiente, como consequência da 

utilização de práticas não sustentáveis no uso dos recursos naturais, levando à perda 

acelerada da diversidade biológica. Cerca de 44% de todas as espécies de plantas 

vasculares e 35% de todas as espécies de quatro grupos de vertebrados (anfíbios, 

répteis, aves e mamíferos), estão confinadas a 25 “hotspots” de biodiversidade que 

ocupam apenas 1,4% de toda a superfície da Terra. Entre estes “hotspots” está a bacia 

Mediterrânica, sendo parte significativa dessa área a metade sul da Península Ibérica. 

No Mediterrâneo, ocorrem 38 espécies de mamíferos, alguns endémicos com destaque 

para o lince Ibérico Lynx pardinus, o felino mais ameaçado do Mundo. Localizada na 

parte mais ocidental do Mediterrâneo, a Península Ibérica caracteriza-se por ter estações 

do ano bem marcadas, com verões quentes e secos, e invernos amenos e chuvosos. Em 

termos gerais, apresenta dois grandes planaltos no centro, dominados por agricultura 

extensiva de cereais, intercalados por manchas de vegetação esclerófita, constituídos na 

sua maioria por sistemas agro-florestais. No Norte e Noroeste da Península Ibérica, as 

florestas folhosas e mistas são a vegetação dominante, intercaladas por parcelas de 

pastagens, dando origem a uma diversificada comunidade de predadores e presas. O 

gradual desaparecimento da floresta original, substituída pelo aumento da área ocupada 

por matos e matagais, em combinação com a diversificação da paisagem ao longo do 

tempo, afectou não só a distribuição das espécies, mas também a sua diversidade 

genética. Durante a segunda metade do século XX, as áreas rurais da Península Ibérica 

sofreram uma emigração em massa para as cidades, com o abandono dos tradicionais 

usos agrícolas. A causa desse abandono foi a intensificação da agricultura em áreas 

planas, devido ao aumento da produtividade causada pela mecanização, uso de 

fertilizantes químicos e novos mecanismos de irrigação. Estas alterações levaram à 

redução da área de distribuição e efectivo populacional de numerosas espécies, algumas 

das quais se encontram actualmente distribuídas por populações fragmentadas e de 

pequena dimensão. Com uma ampla distribuição no passado o gato bravo Europeu Felis 

silvestris distribuía-se por todas as regiões florestadas da Europa, do Cáucaso e da Ásia. 

Actualmente ocorre em populações fragmentadas de Portugal, Espanha, França, Itália e 

Alemanha, Balcãs, Cárpagos, Cáucaso e Ásia, além de algumas populações insulares, na  



 xvi 

Escócia e Sicília. Por causa do declínio em várias áreas da sua distribuição na Europa, o 

gato bravo encontra-se limitado às zonas montanhosas de baixa e média altitude, com 

pouca perturbação humana, onde se encontra associado a ambientes florestais (zona 

Atlântica) ou com coberto arbustivo (zona Mediterrânea). Nas zonas Mediterrâneas da 

Península, as áreas de mosaico constituídas por um misto de pastagens intercaladas com 

manchas de matos, para além da grande disponibilidade de presas (especialmente coelho 

bravo Oryctolagus cuniculus) também proporcionam abrigo e refúgio. Apesar dos 

micromamíferos serem a base da alimentação do gato bravo na maioria da sua área de 

distribuição, em ambientes mediterrâneos são substituídos como presa-base pelo coelho 

bravo. De entre os factores de ameaça, para além daqueles que são comuns a outras 

espécies de carnívoros, como a perda de habitat, diminuição das populações presa, e 

perseguição humana através do controlo de predadores associado à actividade 

cinegética, acresce aqueles que têm que ver com a expansão das populações de gato 

doméstico Felis catus em áreas naturais. De facto, a hibridação introgressiva com o gato 

doméstico é referida como a mais grave ameaça à conservação do gato bravo. No 

entanto, e ao contrário de outras regiões da Europa, as populações de gato bravo na 

Península Ibérica apresenta baixos níveis de hibridação, conferindo-lhes um alto valor 

de conservação. A presença de gatos domésticos em áreas naturais muitas vezes 

representa um problema de conservação, também, devido à competição e predação de 

espécies selvagens, para além das suas populações funcionarem como reservatórios para 

muitas doenças. Sabendo que o sucesso do gato doméstico em colonizar novas áreas 

está associado à expansão humana, torna-se importante avaliar a relação entre o gato 

doméstico e o homem em áreas naturais importantes para a conservação do gato bravo, 

confrontando essa análise com o que se conhece da ecologia espacial e trófica do gato 

doméstico em toda a sua área de distribuição. Deste modo, esta Tese focou os requisitos 

ecológicos do gato bravo e os constrangimentos relacionados com a presença humana e 

as suas actividades, em quatro capítulos (Caps. 3, 4, 5 e 6) correspondentes a quatro 

artigos científicos. No capítulo 3, foi feita a avaliação dos principais descritores da 

distribuição de gato bravo em Espanha (uma vez que não existe informação em Portugal 

para se poder fazer essa análise). Para tal, foram construídos modelos para a zona 

Atlântica, Mediterrânica e Espanha Continental usando um conjunto de descritores 

baseados na informação a uma escala mais fina. De onde resultou que, os descritores 

mais relevantes para o gato bravo à escala mais fina mantêm-se à grande escala 

(Espanha), e em diferentes biomas: Atlântico e Mediterrâneo. O número de espécies de 



 xvii 

micromamíferos e a diferença de altitude (este descritor está indirectamente associado à 

ocupação humana) são as variáveis mais importantes para descrever a distribuição de 

gato bravo na Peninsula Ibérica. Nesta perspectiva, a presença humana é uma questão-

chave nas estratégias de conservação do gato bravo, o que justifica o investimento no 

conhecimento sobre as interacções entre os primeiros, os gatos domésticos e, 

consequentemente, os seres humanos. No capítulo 4, foi usada a informação da presença 

de gatos domésticos em 128 herdades da Zona Especial de Conservação de Moura-

Barrancos para analisar os factores ambientais e humanos que afectam a presença e o 

número de gatos em cada herdade, com recurso à utilização de modelos lineares 

generalizados. Para além disso, foi feito o rádio seguimento de oito gatos domésticos (5 

machos e 3 fêmeas), cuja informação relativa ao tamanho das suas deslocações diárias 

foi relacionado com um grupo de variáveis independentes (sexo, estação do ano, habitat, 

factores humanos) recorrendo à utilização de modelos generalizados mistos. Como 

resultados mais relevantes deste trabalho salienta-se a dependência do gato doméstico 

em relação à ocupação humana, estando a sua abundância associada aos recursos 

alimentares fornecidos pelas pessoas. Em relação à dimensão dos seus movimentos 

diários estes reflectem uma relação negativa com a presença de outros carnívoros, em 

particular com a raposa Vulpes vulpes. No capitulo 5, foi feita a análise ao conteúdo de 

407 excrementos de Felis sp recolhidos em nove latrinas situadas no, e perto, do Sítio 

Moura-Barrancos, sendo as mesmas caracterizadas de acordo com a sua distância a 

casas. Com recurso a análise multivariada os excrementos foram agrupados com base na 

diferença dos itens que os constituem. Os restos da alimentação humana, associados aos 

excrementos recolhidos em latrinas perto de casas, e o consumo de coelho bravo, 

associado às latrinas afastadas de casas, deram o contributo mais significativo para a 

diferenciação dos grupos de excrementos. O mesmo tipo de abordagem e análise foi 

feita com recurso a uma revisão bibliográfica de estudos (n=57) sobre a ecologia trófica 

do gato doméstico no Mundo, que revelaram similitudes entre as zonas urbanas e 

naturais, em oposição às ilhas. Em ambas as análises, escala da área de estudo e 

mundial, ficou expressa a dependência do gato doméstico pelos recursos alimentares 

disponibilizados pelo homem. No capítulo 6, foram utilizados vinte cinco artigos 

publicados com informação sobre a prevalência de seis agentes virais (FcoV – 

Coronavírus Felino, FIV - Imunodeficiência Felina, FeLV – Leucémia Felina, FPV – 

Panleucopénia Felina, FCV - Calicivírus Felino e FHV – Herpesvírus Felino) nas 

populações de gato doméstico, gato bravo, gato do deserto Felis Margarita e o gato 



 xviii 

leopardo de Iriomote Felis irimotensis em trinta e seis áreas distribuídas por cinco 

continentes. Para entender a influência do ambiente (ilhas, áreas naturais, rurais e 

urbanas), da espécie, e da prevalência de cada um dos seis agentes virais na ocorrência 

de cada um dos seis vírus, foram utilizados modelos lineares generalizados, em que a 

variável dependente corresponde à presença/ausência de cada tipo de vírus por amostra. 

O ambiente e a espécie estiverem presentes nos melhores modelos para FIV, FCoV e 

FPV, enquanto a prevalência de outros vírus foi significante para os modelos de FeLV, 

FCV e FHV. A prevalência de FIV aparece correlacionada com a sociabilidade da 

espécie, com incidência para as zonas rurais e urbanas. A ocorrência de FIV e FeLV, 

que necessitam do contacto para a propagação, afecta a ocorrência de outros vírus.   

Finalmente, no capítulo 7 (discussão) faz-se um resumo das implicações para a 

conservação do gato bravo mediante vários cenários de ocupação humana em áreas 

naturais, de acordo com os impactos das suas actividades (agricultura, pecuária e 

cinegética) e presença /abundância de gatos domésticos.

1. General Introduction 

1.1 HUMAN PRESENCE AND NATURAL VALUES IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA 

Conservation of natural values is one of the major concerns in the modern world. It does 

not merely deal with the preservation of endangered species, but also with dramatic 

changes in ecosystems and landscapes (Deem et al. 2001). In recent years the concept of 

biodiversity is gaining popularity, with the ecosystems as the principal conservation 

targets, combining genetic diversity within populations, community structure (species 

richness and composition), and landscape heterogeneity. In this context, the 

Mediterranean Basin is one of the richest places in the world in terms of animal and 

plant species and was recognized as one of 34 biodiversity hotspots with almost all taxa 

exhibit high levels of diversity, at both the specific and subspecific levels (Mittermeier 

et al. 2004). 

Contrasting with most taxa, the mammal fauna of the Mediterranean is largely derived 

from the Eurasian and African biogeographic zones and therefore exhibits relatively low 

levels of endemism, once most species tend to have very wide ranges (Temple and 

Cuttelod 2009). However, in the Mediterranean thirty eight carnivore species can be 

found, two of which endemic with the highlight towards the world’s most endangered 

felid - the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus (Temple and Cuttlelod 2009). The evolutionary 

mechanisms of such diversification have been related to conditions and opportunities 

ultimately generated by the environmental and historical peculiarities offered by the 

geographic location and configuration of the Mediterranean areas (e.g. insularity, 

peninsula-rich shoreline, climatic seasonality, habitat heterogeneity, etc) (Garcia-Barros 

et al. 2002). Located in the West of the Mediterranean region, the Iberian Peninsula is

characterized by well-marked seasons, with dry and hot summers and wet and mild 

winters. Broadly, the region encompasses two plateaus in the centre, dominated by 

extensive cereal farming interspersed by patches of sclerophylous vegetation, agro-

forestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean scrubland and forest. Dividing 

and surrounding these plateaus, several mountain systems are found, where large areas 

of Mediterranean scrublands and forests are preserved. In North and Northwest Atlantic 

areas of Iberia, the mixed and broad-leaved forests of deciduous species are the 

dominant vegetation, with imbibed patches of pastureland, allowing for a rich 

community of predators and prey in these landscapes. All these landscapes are the result 

of millenary transformations, product of the interaction between natural, antropic, and 

historical factors, as these ecosystems have experienced a long and intense history of 

human influence (Blondel 2006). Early hominids (eg, Homo erectus) migrated out of 

Africa, through Mediterranean lands, into Europe and Asia. Thereafter, modern humans 

colonized the Mediterranean Basin (Mannion 1999) c. 10 000 years ago. This was a 

turning point in cultural and environmental history. Humans domesticated certain plants 

and animals, such as wheat, barley, sheep, cattle and goats, and the ecosystems were 

subject to modification. Land management was in the context of a self-sufficient 

economy in which exchanges with the outside world were scarce (ovine transhumance 

and few agricultural and metal imports), leading to a highly humanised landscape with 

great ecological and cultural diversity (Crowling et al. 1996, García-Ruiz and Valero 

1998). The progressive replacement of deciduous broad-leaved forests by evergreen 

sclerophyllous forests and scrubland, in combination with increasing habitat patchiness 

over time, affected both the distribution of populations and species and their genetic 

diversity (Blondel 2006).

1.1.1 Effects of landscape humanisation on wildlife 

During the second half of the 20th century, the rural areas of the Iberian Peninsula 

suffered the massive emigration of people towards cities and the consequent 

abandonment of traditional agricultural uses, with the consequent decrease in livestock 

numbers (Lasanta et al. 2006, MacDonald et al. 2000). The cause of this 

marginalization was the intensification of agriculture in flat areas, due to an increased 

productivity caused by mechanisation, use of chemical fertilisers and irrigation 

mechanisms (Preiss et al. 1997, Macdonald et al. 2000). As a consequence, the 

agricultural production in mountainous areas was less competitive, with higher 

production costs because of smaller property sizes, higher complexity in property 

structure, higher difficulty in using machinery and lower soil fertility. At this point, 

conflicts between people and wildlife, particulary predators intensified because of 

competition for shared, limited resources due to landscape changes (Odden et al. 2002, 

Graham et al. 2005, Kaartinen et al. 2009). This includes deforestation, intensification 

of pastoral agriculture, loss of arable agriculture, disturbance of natural fire regimes, 

mining, urbanization, tourism, pollution and the introduction of alien species 

(Perevolotsky and Seligman 1998, Rodriguez and Delibes 2004, Oliveira et al. 2008). 

The actual landscape of Iberia is therefore the result of a subtle interaction between 

ecological and anthropogenic processes occurring at each successional stage, and many 

species opportunistically took advantage of the gradual changes induced by people in 

the landscape, becoming hostages of agricultural and grazing activities. At this stage 

and over time, people conducted small shrub removal to facilitate cattle grazing or 

accede to new exploitation areas, contributing to shape a highly diverse landscape. For 

species, such as the wolf Canis lupus signatus, some large ungulates are reduced due to 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction

hunting and habitat changes (Graham et al. 2005), but this was compensated with the 

abundance of live livestock and their carcasses (sheep, goats, Iberian pigs and cattle) 

and increased populations of wildboard Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus 

(Vos 2000). The traditional farming system, therefore, beyond promoting heterogeneity 

in the landscape, represented an important food resource for large predators and 

scavenging species (Vos 2000, Lasanta et al. 2006). European rabbits are native to the 

Iberian Peninsula (Monnerot et al. 1994), and from the late Pleistocene until Classic 

Antiquity, they were mostly restricted to the place of origin. Because of that, in Iberian 

Mediterranean ecosystems, rabbits are a keystone species for approximately 40 Iberian 

predators (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008), including two highly endangered species: the 

Iberian lynx and the Spanish Imperial eagle Aquila adalberti. 

1.1.1.1 Interactions between people and carnivores  

The traditional agriculture practices promoted the existence of edges between different 

types of habitat, with particular relevance when it relates to pastures and high-cover 

vegetation. Many game species, like rabbits and red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa, 

use this mosaic landscape and are followed by a diversity of predators. Responding to 

these sustainable rural activities, several carnivore species became directly or indirectly 

linked to the landscape changes made by man that influenced their population trends. In 

fact, of the 15 species of existing Iberian carnivores (Temple and Cuttelod 2009), six 

(red fox Vulpes vulpes, common genet Geneta geneta, Egyptian mongoose Herpestes 

icnheumon, European badger Males males, stone marten Martes foina and weasel 

Mustela nivalis) managed to adapt to these changes, in some cases even taking 

advantage of the opportunities provided by human activities (Treves and Karanth 2003). 

Inversely, for other carnivore species, human activities had a strong negative impact on 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 7 

their populations, especially for those highly sensitive to disturbance, like brown bear 

Ursus actus, the Iberian Lynx and the European wildcat Felis silvestris (Rodriguez and 

Delibes 1990, Stahl and Artois 1994, Naves et al. 2003). Not all human activities, 

and/or its intensity, had equal effects on sensitive carnivores and if some clearly 

promoted population reductions (e.g persecution, shelter reduction) (Villafuerte et al. 

1998, Rodriguez and Delibes 2004), other favoured some species expansion by 

providing additional food resources. Traditional agricultural practices, for instance, 

increased the landscape mosaics, promoting the diversity and abundance of prey, and 

generated new opportunities for carnivores (Lozano et al. 2003). Even some of the more 

sensitive medium-sized carnivores (such as Iberian lynx and wildcat) compensate the 

impact of human disturbance with prey resources offered in these traditional small-scale 

agricultural landscapes, such as wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and rodents. 

Recent studies reinforce the association between Mediterranean vegetation and 

carnivore’s requirements, directly as shelter and indirectly through its relation with food 

resources availability (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995, Lozano et al. 2003, Fernández et 

al. 2006). For example, the wildcat and the Iberian lynx are known to use habitat 

ecotones as foraging areas due to their higher rabbit abundance (Lozano et al. 2003, 

Fernández et al. 2003, Fernández 2005, Fernández et al. 2006) or rodents in forest edges 

(Biró et al. 2004, Klar et al. 2008). However, extensive activities such as those related 

with the plantation of production forests (e.g. eucalyptus) or that of cereals, may have 

caused local extinctions or, at least, significant population size reductions (Andren 

1994, Inchausti et al. 2005).

1.1.1.2 People - carnivore conflicts 

Livestock predation by mammalian large carnivores is one of the most frequent sources 

of conflict between humans and wildlife throughout the world (Graham et al. 2005, 

Kaartinen et al. 2009). Perceived economic losses due to livestock depredation often 

lead to retaliatory responses by agro-pastoralists. For example, the main problem faced 

by Iberian wolf conservation is the high level of livestock depredation throughout the 

Iberian Peninsula (Petrucci-Fonseca 1990, Reig et al. 1985, Cuesta et al. 1991, Vos 

2000). In the case of the brown bear, forestry and agricultural practices and intensive 

grazing led this carnivore to prey on livestock and, because of cattle abundance and 

foraging competition, the conflict increased (Clevenger et al. 1994, Naves et al. 2003). 

Roads and other infrastructures represent the new impacts on species, with great 

relevance in carnivore populations (Ferreras et al. 1992). In fact, there is a close 

relationship between the occurrence of preferred carnivore habitats and low human 

disturbance levels with the number of carnivore fatalities, and the vulnerability of some 

species to particular features of roads. As the road network extends across the landscape 

and traffic volumes intensify, researchers have documented that roads and traffic may 

affect some carnivore populations in three general ways: they may increase mortality, 

limit mobility including access to resources, and decrease the habitat amount and 

quality (e.g. Trombulak and Frissell 2000, Grilo et al. 2009). Because carnivores have 

small populations, tend to live at low densities and occupy large home-ranges, they are 

particularly vulnerable to roads expansion. Road mortality is a major threat for 

European wildcats (Klar et al 2009) and roads may also have a repulsive effect on 

wildcats influencing their habitat selection (Klar et al. 2008).

Several decades ago in the Iberian Peninsula, hunting was an important cultural and 

social activity, which was mostly non-commercial. The number of private areas devoted 

to big game hunting is increasing in Portugal and Spain. Management of these areas 

may thus neglect smaller hunting species (e.g., wild rabbits, Iberian hares Lepus 

granatensis and red legged partridges), and especially in the case of intensively 

exploited areas (Rodríguez and Delibes 2004, Lozano et al. 2007), where modern 

agriculture change the original landscape matrix to a homogeneous landscape of 

irrigated crop fields or promotes large scrubland extensions for big game. Nevertheless, 

in many areas the small game hunting still is an important activity, particularly in poor 

rural areas, and plays an important socio-economic role, generating income and 

providing employment and recreation, particularly in rural areas, leading to new 

problems for carnivore populations. Besides habitat modification and release of farm-

reared game, the most common game management practices in small game areas 

include legal and illegal predator control (Virgós and Travaini 2005, Beja et al. 2008). 

This practice was more intensive in the past, with the state-sponsored campaigns to 

eliminate predators  during late 1930s to late 1960s in Portugal and from 1950s to the 

mid 1970s in Spain (Villafuerte et al. 1998, Beja et al. 2008), resulting in drastic 

population declines and regional extinctions (Garzón 1974). The use of poison, snares 

and traps was widespread, resulting in the strong decline of some carnivore species 

(Rodriguez and Delibes 1990, Duarte and Vargas 2001, Álvares 2003). Although state-

supported and legal killing ended in the mid-1970s, this activity continues, both through 

legal methods (shooting or trappings of Egyptian mongooses and red foxes in Portugal 

and red fox in Spain) and illegal and non-selective techniques. (Duarte and Vargas 

2001, Virgós and Travaini 2005, Beja et al. 2008).

1.1.1.3 Role of domestic carnivores as reservoirs of infectious agents to 

wildlife   

The expansion of agriculture and livestock production near or inside natural areas 

promotes contact between human populations and their livestock with wild carnivores 

(Macdonald et al. 2000). This close contact facilitates the spread of infectious agents 

and parasites to new hosts and environments, thus establishing new relationships 

between hosts and parasites, and new ecological niches in the chain of disease 

transmission (Altizer et al. 2003). The host-pathogen relationship has therefore suffered 

an imbalance caused mainly by environmental changes due to human activity (Daszak 

et al. 2000, Deem et al. 2001), frequently associated with the introduction of pathogens 

into wild populations and changes in the host’s susceptibility to infections (Grenfell and 

Dobson 1995). Incidence itself depends on the relation between population size, density, 

and rate of contact for efficient disease transmission. An important factor is the social 

organisation of domestic hosts, that can influence parasite prevalence and population 

dynamics. For example, although the prevalence of FeLV increased with group size in 

domestic cats, FIV prevalence decreases with increasing group size (Fromont et al. 

1997). FeLV transmission is enhanced in larger groups with non-aggressive contacts. 

FIV is transmitted by biting and occurrs almost exclusively among adult males that 

fought to maintain dominance hierarchies. Some epidemics originated in reservoir 

species caused important declines in endangered species. Examples of this are the 

canine distemper outbreak in the last remaining wild colony of black footed ferrets 

Mustela nigripes in 1985, that was transmitted by feral dogs and killed over 70% of the 

population, (Thorne and williams 1988), the canine distemper epidemic of 1994 in the 

Serengeti lion Panthera leo population, transmitted by domestic dogs from people 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 11 

populations adjacent to Massai Mara national park that caused mortality in 

approximately 30% of individuals (Roelke-Parker et. al 1996), and  the decline of 

African wild dog population Lycaon picus, during a canine distemper epizootic in 

domestic dogs in the Serengeti (Alexander and Appel 1994). Beyond virus, bacterial 

infections are also important causes of mortality in wild carnivores. In felids, the 

infected carcasses (cape buffalo, deer, fallow deer or wild board) with bovine 

tuberculosis are considered to be the primary route of infection by Mycobacterium 

bovis. In some regions of Kruger National Park, up to 90% of the lions have been 

exposed to tuberculosis and the disease has spread to cheetahs and leopards presumably 

due to scavenging of buffalo carcasses (Keet et al. 1996). In southern Iberian Peninsula, 

there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis in wild ungulates and wild boards related to 

the high density of animals in hunting or protected areas (Gortázar et al. 2008). 

However, the potential role of wild animals in the maintenance and spread of M. bovis 

infection in domestic livestock is of particular importance in countries where 

eradication programs have substantially reduced the incidence of bovine tuberculosis 

but sporadic outbreaks still occur. The best-known examples are the European badger in 

the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (Nolan and Wilesmith 1994, Gallager 

and Clifton-Hadley 2000) and the possum Trichosurus vulpecula in New Zealand 

(Coleman and Cooke 2001). Transmission of infectious agents from cattle to wildlife 

(and vice versa) may have several routes. First, the territories of wild and domesticated 

animals overlap because they share feeding grounds and drinking ponds, and crowding 

of animals at watering ponds, may facilitate close contact and thus may lead to 

increased transmission by the respiratory route (Aranaz et al. 1996, Cosivi et al. 1998). 

Second,  the persistence in infected animals after death may be a source of infection for 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 12 

scavengers, providing the large dose of microorganisms needed for infection by the 

alimentary route (Aranaz et al. 1996). 

 1.2 THE EUROPEAN WILDCAT 

1.2.1 Distribution and spatial ecology 

With a wide distribution in the past, the European wildcat probably covered all the 

forested regions of Western, Central and Southern Europe, Caucasus and Asia (Stahl 

and Artois 1994). Extinction events in many areas of its range, which took place 

between the end of the eighties and the early twenties, led to the decline and 

fragmentation of the original population and justify the present high vulnerability faced 

by the species. Thus, the wildcat is now only present in less populated and relatively 

isolated areas (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Germany), the Balkans, 

Carpathians, Caucasus and Asia, in addition to a few island populations in Scotland, 

Sicily, and probably Corsica (Stahl and Léger 1992). Because of the species decline in 

several areas of its European distribution, the wildcat is now limited to mountains of 

medium and low altitude with little human disturbance (Stahl and Artois 1994). The 

species habitat requirements are still not well known but several evidences link the 

wildcat to high understorey vegetation cover (Lozano et al. 2003, Mangas et al. 2008), 

although it also uses riparian galleries along the rivers and stream valleys, among other 

high-cover habitats, as well as rocky areas, (Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009). In 

the Mediterranean environments, at landscape level the species seems mainly associated 

to mosaics of scrubland and pastureland and at the microhabitat level to high shrub 

cover (Lozano et al. 2003). Like most felines wildcats are solitary and largely nocturnal 

resting in hidden thickets, dens or forests by day and patrolling and hunting at night 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 13 

(Sandell 1989). Males and females come together solely to mate in mid-winter and for 

the rest of their lives the cats are alone (Sandell 1989). Although physical encounters 

are rare, wildcats regularly communicate with each other through scent, and territorial 

boundaries are marked with faeces or sprays (Stahl and Leger 1992). The wildcat home 

range size varies along its distribution range and even locally in the same region, with 

values ranging between 1.95 and 50.17 km2 for males and 0.69 to 13.85 km2 for females 

(Stahl and Artois 1994, Biró et al. 2004, Monterroso et al. 2009).  

1.2.2 Food requirements 

Despite consuming a large diversity of prey, from insects to rabbits, the stable prey 

species for the wildcat in most of its range are small mammals (Condé et al. 1972, 

Sládek 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Moleón and Gil-Sánchez 2003, Carvalho 

and Gomes 2004). However, in Mediterranean-type environments, such as those found 

in the centre and south of the Iberian Peninsula, wild rabbits appear as the main prey for 

the wildcat (Ferreira 2003, Malo et al. 2004, Lozano et al 2006). 

1.2.3 Main threats 

In 1992, the European Council underlined two main threats that relate to the extinction 

risk for wildcat: habitat destruction, resulting in population fragmentation and isolation 

(Stahl and Artois 1994, Nowel and Jackson 1996, Lozano et al. 2003, Klar et al 2008), 

and hybridisation with domestic cat, which may threaten the status of wildcat as a 

genetically distinct species (Hubbard et al. 1992). The intense land-cover transformation 

of Central European landscapes has left forests as almost the only sheltering vegetation, 

decreasing the amount of available habitat for the wildcat and the distance to human-

related land use types like settlements, single houses and roads (Klar et al. 2008). For 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 14 

example, Langley and Yalden (1977) stated that wildcat population decline in the 

British Isles was a consequence of deforestation, despite claiming that wildcat was not a 

typical forest species. This reduction of vegetation cover in large areas had 

consequences to wildcat populations that resulted in the disappearance of the species in 

several European areas and population isolation in the regions with more conservation 

value (Stahl and Artois 1994). This situation promotes the contact with domestic cats 

and, as consequence, introgressive hybridization occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996). 

Extensive hybridization was described in Hungary and Scotland (Beaumont et al. 2001, 

Daniels et al. 2001, Pierpaoli et al. 2003), contrasting with the low levels of 

hybridization found in wildcat populations of Iberia, Germany and Italy (Randi and 

Ragni 1991, Lecis et al. 2006, Oliveira et. al 2008) that therefore have high 

conservation value and should be actively protected (Pierpaoli et al. 2003). Many 

encounters between wildcats and domestic cats are agonistic, with wildcats sometimes 

killing the latter and this could be a barrier to hybridization (Hubbard et al. 1992). 

Another important threat to wildcat is predator control activities, especially in small 

game hunting areas (Virgós and Travaini 2005). 

 

1.3 THE DOMESTIC CAT 

1.3.1 Domestication, range expansion and “feralization”  

Domestic cats have accompanied humanity in all phases of exploration and 

colonization, and have been accidentally or deliberately introduced to many terrestrial 

ecosystems of the world (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986, Fitzgerald and Turner 2000). In 

rural areas, the available food is less than in urban and suburban areas and cats depend 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 15 

greatly on people to feed them. Cat populations exhibit varying degrees of dependence 

on people. Stray cats - cats found in and around cities, towns and rural properties 

depending on some resources provide by people. Feral cats – cats that live and 

reproduce in the wild and survive by hunting or scavenging. People satisfy none of their 

needs intentionally. Recruitment to the stray and feral groups from the domestic 

population constantly occurs from the pet population. However, it is important to 

remember that all are domestic species Felis catus and that stray and feral cats are 

simply an introduction of that domestic species to the urban, suburban and natural 

environment.  

1.3.2 Distribution and population numbers 

Domestic cats, as dogs, are the carnivore species with a wider distribution range, 

occurring in all continents, and are currently one of the biggest problems and challenges 

of wildlife conservation (Macdonald and Thom 2001). In contrast with wildcats, 

domestic cats easily find food and shelter in human settlements (Barratt 1997, Germain 

et al. 2008). It is in populate cities, with an inexhaustible source of food that domestic 

cats reach unimaginable numbers; for example in the streets of the United States there 

are about 30 million ‘stray’-‘feral’ cats (Grimm 2009). There are however large 

variations in the relation between people and domestic cats, from urban to rural areas 

where they have total freedom of movement and probably less control by man. Human 

settlements can be quite diverse in their resource availability for domestic cats 

(Bradshaw et al. 1999): large villages and cities concentrate human structures and 

support higher human densities and consequently of cats, while rural villages and farms 

show a more dispersed pattern of occupation with lower rates of human population 

distributed over a larger area and less cats. Free-ranging domestic cats live close to 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 16 

human settlements, and their home-range size varies with human density and with food 

availability and distribution (Liberg and Sandell, 1988). At very low densities (less than 

10 cats km-2), as in low humanised natural-rural areas, the cats home ranges are larger 

and the intra-specific encounters are uncommon (Kerby and Mcdonald 1988); in high-

density areas these environments favour the contact between domestic cats and other 

carnivore species. Size and stability of domestic cat populations depend therefore on a 

local combination of favourable environmental variables providing food and refuge that 

allow, on average, a positive population growth. Other important factors for domestic 

cats population growth are the interactions with other local species (mainly predation 

and competition), the dispersal abilities of the species between the population groups 

(Soberon and Peterson 2005, Soberon 2007) and disease dynamics. 

1.3.3 Main impacts on wildlife 

In many cases, domestic cats have adapted with great success to the ecosystem where 

they were introduced and have become dominant predators, as documented in many 

islands (Nogales and Medina 1996), where their impact is quite relevant particularly on 

breeding seabird colonies (Matias and Catry 2008) and endemic species (Rodriguez-

Moreno et al. 2007). In addition to the predatory impact on other species, this successful 

invader acts as reservoir in the transmission of numerous diseases (Artois and Remond 

1994, Courchamp et al. 1995, Fromont et al. 1997, Daniels et al. 1999). An extreme 

example of this impact is that of the Iberian lynx, the most endangered feline of the 

world, which transmission of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may be explained by close 

contacts with domestic cats (Jessup et al. 1993, Millán et al. 2009). Another motif of 

concern, as already mentioned (see 1.3.3), is introgressive hybridization with wildcats. 

Much of the hybridization probably occurr in rural areas where the contact between the 



CHAPTER 1. General Introduction 
 
 
 

 17 

two species is more common. In fact, urban domestic cats consistently occupied smaller 

home rangers than rural domestic ones (Devillard et al. 2003), and wildcat males 

probably mated with female domestic cats.  

 

1.4 AIMS AND STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS  

The European wildcat is a threatened species in most Europe, particularly in the central-

north areas where suitable management of forests was considered crucial for its long-

term conservation (Stahl and Artois 1994). However, this recommendation may not 

apply at the global level due to the lack of studies that support this assumption in the 

Mediterranean region, where landscapes and the presence of people in natural areas are 

very different from those in central-north Europe. No study has specifically addressed 

the indirect effects of anthropogeneity (land use, hunting, cattle raising and “ferality” of 

domestic carnivores such as cats) on wildcat conservation. The conservation of wildcat 

in the constantly changing, human-altered landscapes of Southern Iberia requires 

therefore a clear understanding of the species limits and capabilities in these 

environments. People provide food and shelter for domestic cats and persecute 

carnivore species, like wildcat, during predator control campaigns. Domestic cat 

populations are formed by small family groups around farms or/and in near villages, 

where they can reach high densities, compared to nearby wildcat population densities. 

The domestic cat is then a host of, and the main vehicle for the transmission of disease 

into the wildcat, if the probability of contact between the two species is high. Once 

wildcat populations do not reach high densities of individuals the inverse transmission 

is less probable. The same occurs with hybridization between the two species, probably

as result of domestic males moving into natural areas (dashed arrows in Figure 1 

represents these scenarios).         

 

Figure 1.1. Wildcat, domestic cat and human interactions in natural-rural areas. 

My thesis focused on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by 

human-related activities. In natural-rural areas the wildcat constrains are clearly linked 

to human actions and activities, which determine the size and distribution of domestic 

cat populations, which will have an impact on wildcat-domestic cat interactions (Figure 

1). To achieve these general objectives, habitat evaluation and ranking schemes, as well 

as GIS-based modelling procedures, were combined with conventional and recent 

techniques in the study of wildlife ecology of carnivores (trapping, radio-tracking and 

photo-trapping). To analyse the data I applied statistical modelling and developed 

distribution (wildcat and domestic cat) and spatially explicit models (domestic cat) to 

understand how species interact with landscape, human presence, other carnivores and 

prey.

The thesis is organised in five Parts that include seven chapters, including four 

independent papers submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals (Chapters 3 to 

6) plus the general introduction (Chapter 1), the study area description (Chapter 2) and a 

summary of the main findings supporting the discussion of its implications to wildcat 

conservation (Chapter 7). 

 

PART I  - INTRODUCTION  

In this part, was made a general introduction (chapter 1) about the topic and aims of this 

thesis. The study area (chapter 2) was also described in this section.  

 

PART II – LARGE SCALE REQUIREMENTS OF WILDCAT  

In this part, that includes chapter 3, the main wildcat requirements at large scale are 

analysed, including prey availability, vegetation cover and human disturbance, based on 

regional/local species knowledge: 

Chapter 3 - Ferreira JP, Fernández N, Santos-Reis M and Revilla E (submitted). Large 

scale determinants of European wildcat distribution on Mediterranean and Atlantic 

areas. Ecography 

 

PART III – HUMAN INFLUENCE IN RURAL POPULATIONS OF DOMESTIC CATS.  

In this part the main goal was to understand the role of man in the maintenance of 

domestic cat populations in natural-rural areas. To achieve this we focus on domestic

Chapter 5 - Ferreira JP, Leitão I, Maldonado C, Santos-Reis S and Revilla E (final stage 

of preparation). Different cats, different places, different diets?  

 

PART IV – DOMESTIC CATS AS DISEASE RESERVOIRS TO WILDLIFE: THREATS TO 

WILDCATS IN NATURAL-RURAL AREAS 

In this chapter a review of feline-associated virus was performed at worldwide level and 

prevalence related with environment-type (natural, rural, urban or island), carnivore 

species and other virus occurrence at population level: 

Chapter 6 - Ferreira JP, Maldonado C, Santos-Reis S and Revilla E (in prep). Virus 

Prevalence in cat populations: Implications for wildlife conservation, wildcats in 

particular.. 

 

PART V  - DISCUSSION. LESSONS FOR WILDCAT CONSERVATION 

In this part, that include chapter 7, was made a general resume of the main findings of 

this thesis, as well proposals for wildcat conservation.

2. Study Area 

This thesis was conducted at two spatial levels. One corresponds to a large-scale analysis, 

using the Iberian Peninsula as the study area (Paper I), and another at a finer-scale, 

concentrating in a natural area of south-eastern Portugal. (Papers II and III)  

Iberian Peninsula 

The Iberian Peninsula is located in the 

extreme southwest of Europe, being 

bordered by the Mediterranean Sea at the 

southeast and east, and by the Atlantic 

Ocean on the north, west and south-west 

(Figure 2.1). The mountain system of the 

Pyrenees, form the northeast edge of the 

peninsula, separating it from the rest of 

Europe. In spite of its relatively small size, 

the Iberian Peninsula is not a homogeneous 

area neither in terms of climate nor in terms of vegetation. Its geographical location, exposure 

to marine influences, and hydrographic and orographic peculiarities, together with an ancient 

human occupation, originated a diverse mosaic of landscapes variying from arid to alpine -

type ecosystems (Castro et al. 1997). In fact, Iberian Peninsula encompasses two major 

biogeographic regions: the Mediterranean, occupying the majority of the territory, and the 

Atlantic, more localized in the northern and north-western edges (Figure 2.2).

CHAPTER 2. Study area 
 
 
 

 35 

Mediterranean area of Iberian Peninsula - The Mediterranean-type area, which 

occupies most of Iberian Peninsula, is characterized by well-marked seasons with dry, 

hot summers and wet, mild winters (Castro et al. 1997). Broadly, this area encompasses 

two plateaus in the centre, dominated by extensive cereal farming interspersed by 

sclerophylous vegetation, agro-forestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean 

scrubland and forest. Several mountain systems are found dividing and surrounding 

these plateaus, where large fragments of Mediterranean scrublands and forests are 

preserved. Forests are typically dominated by Quercus spp., mainly holm oak Quercus 

rotundifolia- or coniferous mainly pines Pinus spp (Castro et al. 1997). In these 

systems, wild rabbits are abundant and represent a key-prey for many carnivores and 

raptors, including the wildcat, (Malo et al. 2004, Moreno et al. 2004, Lozano et al. 

2006). Other preys inhabiting the region include small mammals (13 species of 

insectivores and rodents, according to (Palomo et al. 2007). Besides wildcat, 10 other 

species of carnivores can be found in this region, including two top-predators: the 

Iberian wolf and the Iberian lynx.  

Atlantic area of Iberian Peninsula - The Atlantic-type area occupies the mountainous 

areas of northern Spain and the north-western corner of Portugal, being relatively wet, 

with mild winters, warm summers and regular precipitation throughout the year. In 

contrast to the Mediterranean areas, natural landscapes are dominated by mixed and 

broad-leaved forests of deciduous species. The agriculture is mainly restricted to 

altitude pastures, occurring in patches that are imbibed in a diversified matrix of 

forested areas. Topography is rough, limiting human occupancy in many areas. The 

structure and diversity of the landscape promotes a rich community of small mammals 

(21 species of insectivores and rodents – Palomo et al. 2007), which is followed by an

also diverse guild of carnivores (13 species – wildcats and wolves included). Wildcats 

in the Atlantic region feed mostly on small mammals, and are less dependent of the wild 

rabbit that lives at lower density and does not constitute a key- prey for predators. 

Moura-Barrancos Natura 2000 Site 

The finer-scale research was conducted in a natural area of Guadiana river basin, 

characterized by a Mediterranean landscape. Located in the southeast of the Portuguese-

Spanish border, between 38º13’N - 37º57’N and 7º24’O - 6º59’O, the Moura-Barrancos 

Natura 2000 Site has an overall area of 43309 ha (10000 ha of an evolving agro-forestry 

system) dominated by holm oak woodlands, scrubland patches and rocky areas along 

the main valleys (Figure 3). Rivers, streams and creeks, with intermittent character, flow 

through scrubland areas of Mediterranean sclerophylous vegetation mixed with rocks. 

Besides other natural values, the Moura-barrancos site was created because it was one 

of the last strongholds of the Iberian lynx in Portugal (Pires and Fernandes 2003). 

Included in Mediterranean region, the site as a climate is characterized by mild winters 

and extremely hot summers (Carmel and Flather 2004), with average temperatures 

between&amp;lt;18 and &gt;22°C, respectively (Chicharo et al. 2001). Annual precipitation 

levels vary between 400–600 mm (Chicharo et al. 2001). Land-use is dominated by an 

agro-silvo-pastoral system, characterized by the combination of open tree cover with 

cattle grazing underneath. The human population density is low (between 10.7 and 17.1 

hab/km²) concentrated in five small villages. Human settlements are concentrated in 

villages and several farmhouses can be found scattered throughout the landscape, 

although most currently abandoned. Human activity is restricted to cattle raising, 

agriculture and game hunting. These conditions offer a very suitable habitat for 

wildcats, due to the presence of well preserved vegetation patches and connectivity

elements (e.g. river valleys) along the landscape. Because of human occupancy, that 

translates into the presence of stray-feral cats, the landscape context presents the ideal 

conditions for hybridization events with wildcats.

Abstract 

Mechanistic and correlative models presents some problems, related with the scale of 

application, either because of the local/regional species linkage variables changed along biomes 

and global predictors have problems of interpretation. A set of models were run in two different 

biomes, Atlantic and Mediterranean, and in all Continental Spain using a group of descriptors 

based on fine scale information. The approach incorporated the advantages of correlative and 

mechanistic models to develop large-scale determinants that express the local individual 

requirements for wide ranging species occurring in distinct biomes. The best accuracy models 

revealed that the effects of the relevant descriptors at fine scale studies still appear at large scale, 

and in distinct biomes. To address this, was selected the European wildcat that has a large 

geographical range and some ecological tolerance, but suffering a constrained in its distribution 

range. The generalized idea that the European wildcat shows different requirements along its 

distribution range, and that differences are stronger across biomes, mainly between temperate 

forest and Mediterranean vegetation were not observed at large scale using information from 

fine-scale. The more important descriptors for wildcat presence, the number of small mammals 

and elevation range, in Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes still occur in Continental Spain. This 

is the first large scale modeling that analyses the main wildcat requirements, including prey 

availability, vegetation cover and human disturbance, based on regional/local species 

knowledge.

3.1. INTRODUCTION 

Understand the relationships between the distribution of species and environmental 

variability is one of the biggest issues in ecological research. The quantification of 

species-environment relationships not only represents the core of predictive 

geographical modelling in ecology: also, it has important applications in conservation 

practice (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Schadt et al. 2002). Species distributions 

respond to ecological processes operating simultaneously over a wide range of scales, 

from the spatial scale of individual movements to the scale of variability in species-level 

environmental constrains, e.g. climate (Karl et al. 2000, Fernández et al. 2003). Several 

authors have identified correlative models as more appropriate at global, regional and 

landscape scales than mechanistic models, which seem to be more accurate at finer 

spatial scales (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Johnson and Omland 2004, Helmuth et 

al. 2005). Nevertheless, the two model approaches presents some difficulties: the local 

scale of mechanistic models have problems in application across areas of distinct 

biomes and the correlative approaches, with large scale application, have problems of 

interpretation as a consequence of predictors changes across biomes. Many distribution 

models have been performed based on limiting factors at large spatial scales, like 

climatic variables (Thuiller et al. 2004), not incorporate individual selection 

requirements. Other models linkage the species distribution, at fine resolution, to 

variables that are assumed to be relevant to individuals presence (Engler et al. 2004, 

Pearce et al. 2001). Nevertheless, the significance of those variables in terms of 

individuals requirements (resources) or limited population (ie mortality factors) is not 

always clear.  



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 43 

Regional scale predictive modelling is being used increasingly to identify the factors 

conditioning species distribution and to provide primary information for regional 

conservation programs (Mladenoff et al. 1999, Schadt et al. 2002, Naves et al. 2003, 

Klar et. al. 2008). These models are generally developed to test various hypotheses, as 

to how environmental factors control the distribution of species and communities 

(Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). Some models correlate environmental abiotic 

variables influencing species ecology with presence/absence data distribution to identify 

suitable areas for the species (correlative approach), while others considered to underlie 

the observed correlations with environmental attributes (mechanist approach) by using a 

detailed knowledge of the target species (Robertson et al. 2003).   

Moreover, the distribution of a species is an expression of the regulatory mechanisms 

acting at the individual level, regarding species as requiring a set of resources and 

conditions in order to function (Fernández et al. 2003). This approach explicitly takes 

into account functional relationships between species and essential resources and/or 

conditions in their environment rather than using general vegetation types as surrogates 

for species habitat (Vanreusel and Van Dyck, 2007).  

With detailed knowledge at fine scale of target species, namely data on individual 

requirements (resources) and population limitations (e.g., mortality factors), we can 

formulate hypothesis that the species distribution reflects the regulatory mechanisms 

acting at the individual level. The distribution of these requirements can explain the 

distribution of a species, knowing that other factors, like historical and geographical, 

also play an important role in species distribution range (Gaston and Fuller 2009).        

Thus the main goal is to test the hypothesis: Can species distribution at large scale to be 

model using fine scale information, knowing that species requirements vary across 

biomes?  



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 44 

For that was choosing a European Wildcat Felis silvestris, a species with a large 

geographic range, occurring in different biomes, but had suffered a contraction in their 

historical range. 

The widespread decline of wildcat populations between late eighteenth and early 

twentieth centuries, results in the fragmentation and extinction of many populations of 

Western and Central Europe (Stahl and Leger 1992). Previous studies indicate that the 

species selects areas with low density of humans, settlements and transport 

infrastructures (Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) (Szemeyhy 1992, Klar et al. 

2008) (Klar et al. 2008, Santos et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) and dense 

vegetation cover (Lozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006, Klar et al. 2008, Santos et 

al. 2008). Few studies exist in Mediterranean landscapes, where the species seems 

mainly associated to mosaics of scrubland and pastureland (Lozano et al. 2003). 

Regarding resource requirements, wildcats consume a large diversity of prey but small 

mammals are dominant in their diet in most areas of its distribution range (Condé et al. 

1972, Sládek, 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Moleón and Gil-Sánchez 2003, 

Carvalho and Gomes, 2004). However wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) become the 

main prey in most of the Mediterranean environments, such as the central and southern 

regions of the Iberian Peninsula (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et al. 1999, Lozano et al 

2006, Monterroso et al. 2009). 

To accomplish the proposal goal was test if habitat factors operating at the level of 

individuals explain broad-scale distribution patterns of the wildcat. The fine scale 

variables that had great influence in species presence were included in more general 

descriptors that can be interpretive across the species distribution range. For this, was 

assessed the agreement between predictions from resource-based habitat selection 

models and the broad-scale species distribution in Spain. The fine scale descriptors 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 45 

directly linked to resource requirements by individuals were used to create broader 

descriptors: vegetation cover, food availability and human disturbance to evaluate the 

following hypotheses:  

H1) Prey diversity (small mammals and wild rabbits) is the single explanatory factor of 

wildcat distribution; H2) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and human disturbance 

interact; H3) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and vegetation cover providing 

refuge/shelter are the limiting factors, human disturbance being not important; H4) All 

three factors are equally. These descriptors reflect the more important variables for 

wildcat in fine scale studies, with special relevance for prey availability that is reference 

for most autors (Lozano et al. 2006). The human disturbance seems to play as well an 

important role in wildcat distribution (Klar et al. 2008, Santos et al. 2008, Monterroso 

et al. 2009).  

Moreover, we explored whether a single correlative-mechanistic hybrid model may 

predict the species distribution across distinct biomes. The wildcat explore different 

resources in the various biomes where occurs. In Atlantic areas the wildcat prey mainly 

rodents while in Mediterranean the main prey is the rabbits (Lozano et al. 2006). The 

habitats preferred by the species in Atlantic areas are mixed and broad leave forest 

selecting the sclerophylous vegetation in the Mediterranean (Klar et al. 2008, Lozano et 

al. 2003).   

The evaluation of model performance in distinct biomes was necessary to evaluate the 

effects of the various descriptors, and related hypothesis, with wildcat distribution 

range.  The challenge is to incorporate the advantages of both approaches to develop 

large-scale models that express the local requirements for wide-ranging species 

occurring in distinct biomes.

3.2 METHODS 

3.2.1 Study area 

The wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula was study, which includes a 

representation of two biomes: Atlantic and Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region, 

which occupies most of the continental Spain, is characterized by well-marked seasons 

with dry, hot summers and wet, mild winters. Broadly, the region encompasses two 

plateaus in the centre, dominated by extensive cereal farming interspersed by 

sclerophylous vegetation, agro-forestry systems and some formations of Mediterranean 

scrubland and forest. Several Mountain systems are found dividing and surrounding 

these plateaus, where higher fragments of Mediterranean scrublands and forests are 

preserved. Forests are typically dominated by Quercus spp. manly holm oak Quercus 

Rotundifolia- or Pinus spp. Various studies have shown that wild rabbit are a key-prey 

for wildcats in these systems. Other preys include smaller mammals: 13 species of 

insectivorous and rodent mammals are present in the Mediterranean region. The 

Atlantic region occupies the mountainous areas of Northern Spain, being relatively wet, 

with mild winters, warm summers and more regular precipitation throughout the year. 

In contrast to Mediterranean areas, mixed and broad-leaved forests of deciduous species 

are dominant in natural areas. The agriculture are mainly pastures patches that imbibed 

in a diversify matrix with associated forest areas, to these landscape structure is 

associated a rich community of small mammals. Topography is rough limiting human 

occupancy in many areas. Wildcats in the Atlantic region mostly feed on small 

mammals, which constitute a richer community of 21 insectivorous and rodent species 

bellowing to groups usually predated by carnivores. Wild rabbits are at low population 

densities and do not constitute a significant prey in Atlantic ecosystems.

 47 

3.2.2 Wildcat distribution data 

Distribution data of wildcat was compiled on the basis of a 10x10km UTM (Universal 

Transverse Mercator) grid. For Spain was used data from the National Atlas of 

Mammals CITA, which congregates data collected after 1980 originating from 

published information, museum collections, research centres, universities, besides a 

questionnaire addressed to technicians belonging to the Natural Areas Network (for 

more details see Palomo et al. 2007). Each evidence of presence was criteriously 

evaluated and excluded when considered not reliable. As for Portugal, a similar effort 

was made using data from Natural history Museum of Lisbon and Instituto de 

Conservação da Natureza e Biodiversidade (ICNB) data base. The sampling effort could 

result different is diluted once only 335 of the total 5327 squares for Spain include more 

than one evidence of wildcat presence. 

 

3.2.3 Predictors of wildcat distribution 

The four hypothesis established reflected the known information collected at fine scale, 

most according the individual selected resources, like habitat selection and diet of the 

wildcat studies. Base on these data we built tree main descriptors (food availability, 

Vegetation cover and human disturbance) that could surrogates the influence of fine 

scale variables in species distribution at large scale, with the ultimate goal to model 

wildcat distribution in different biomes (Atlantic and Mediterranean) and in all 

Continental Spain, using a common simple predictors derived from local level of 

information.

3.2.3.1 Food descriptors 

Wildcats consume a large diversity of prey, but the stable prey species in most locations 

are the small mammals (Lozano et al. 2006). With the exceptions of Scotland and the 

most of the Mediterranean areas of Iberian Peninsula were the rabbit abundances are 

high, the rodents and insectivorous (except bats) mammals represents the stable prey for 

wildcat along is distribution range (Condé et al. 1972, Sládek 1973, Hewson 1983, 

Sarmento 1996, Moleón and Gil-Sánchez 2003, Carvalho and Gomes 2004, Malo et al. 

2004). In fact, the marked Mediterranean Iberia the rabbits represents the stable prey for 

wildcat (Aymerich 1982, Sarmento 1996, Malo et al. 2004, Lozano et. al. 2006). The 

higher trophic diversity in wildcat diet in Mediterranean climates is closely associated 

with the wild rabbits consumption in opposite with lower trophic diversity in high 

latitudes were the rodents are more consumed (Lozano et al. 2006). These corroborates 

the idea that the rodents are more “staple-key-prey” than wild rabbits, witch is 

accomplish the consumption of more secondary preys. The availability of a higher 

number of species (mainly Microtinae) enables greater independence from fluctuating 

population of prey species.  Suggesting that the number of small mammals species 

determines the presence of wildcat, with exception for Mediterranean areas were the 

diversity of rodents is lower and the rabbits abundance is very important for the feline 

occurrence, these two main prey were considered as represent the food resources. 

The small mammals diversity (Sm_N) represents the number of species of Insectivorous 

and Rodents presents in each 10x10 km squares of Spain. The Insectivorous species 

belong to Soricomorpha Order, with the exception of Pyrenean desman Galemys 

pyrenaicus and Neomys Genus that were not incorporated, once they are not referred as 

wildcat prey. In Rodentia Order, and for similar reason, the Alpine marmot Marmota 

marmota was excluded. The rodents, insectivores and wild rabbit presence/absence data 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 49 

were obtained from the Spanish Atlas (Palomo et al. 2007). The rabbit (Rb_p) presence, 

once data of species abundances for all 10x10km of Spain has not available, is an 

important food descriptor in most areas of Mediterranean Spain. 

3.2.3.2 Vegetation descriptors 

Apparently the type of vegetation cover is not a determinant factor in the distribution of 

wildcat; this follows from the fact that the species be more generalist in the use of the 

habitat and not strictly forestry, according to fine scale studies (Stahl and Artois 1994, 

Lozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006 Monterroso et al. 2009). Nevertheless, fine 

scale studies suggest that wildcat preferential use broad leave and mixed forest (Ragny 

1981, Stahl and Artois 1994, McOrist and Kitchener 1994, Klar et al. 2008) in high 

latitudes, like Spanish Atlantic biomes and scrubland in Mediterranean regions (Lozano 

et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006, Monterroso et al. 2009). So, we aggregated the 

vegetation types selected at fine scale by wildcat individuals in the two differentiate 

biomes; Forest types from Atlantic and scrubland in Mediterranean, in one major 

vegetation descriptor representing the vegetation cover as explanatory factor of wildcat 

distribution. 

To test the hypothesis of the relevance of habitat quality in wildcat distribution was 

included a set of land use/land cover variables derived from the Corine Land Cover 

2000 map, representing a more fine-scale (scale 1:100 000. 150 m positional accuracy 

and with 25 ha minimum mapping unit) (EEA 2005) than the UTM 10x10 Km square. 

According to the wildcat favourable vegetation types the original eighteen Corine Land 

Cover classes were reclassified in Vegetation Cover (Veg_cover) integrates 5 classes: 

including Broad-leaved Forest, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Transitional 

Woodland/Shrub and Sclerophylous Vegetation (Table 3.1).  



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula

3.2.3.3 Human disturbance predictors 

Because of the decline of their populations in several areas of its European distribution, 

the wildcat is limited to mountainous areas of medium and low altitude, undisturbed by 

human activities (Stahl and Artois 1994, Heltai et al. 2006). The importance of 

elevation range as a positive predictor of threatened species richness globally may result 

from influence of topography on the occurrence of species at fine scale (Jetz et al. 2004, 

Monterroso et al. 2009) and their inherent associated vulnerability (Manne et al. 1999). 

Alternatively, in some cases this occurrence may result from range contractions from 

human-impacted lower elevation areas leaving remnant populations in more 

mountainous regions. Nevertheless, the number and distribution of households and 

human settlements can differ from people density. These human structures changed in 

shape distribution: large villages and cities concentred the human settlements and 

highest values of people density, or a dispersal occupation with lower rates of human 

population but distributed by a largest area represents different disturbance scenarios for 

the wildcat. In both cases the elevation range represents areas with lowest people 

densities and human settlements. Other human impacts are related with habitat 

destruction (Santos et al. 2008, Klar et al. 2008, Monterroso et al. 2009) and road 

kill/disturbance (Vogt 1985, Klar et al. 2008, Klar et al. 2009). Fine-scale monitoring 

showed that wildcats were aware of roads as an obstacle and only a limited number of 

major roads can be tolerated within a wildcat home range (Klar et al. 2009).  

As human disturbance descriptors we used, besides the land cover of NNA classes, the 

roads length (Road_l) and the elevation Range (Elev_range) that indirectly reflects the 

human presence. The Non Natural Areas (NNA) integrates the 13 sub-classes of the 

Artificial Areas Class of Corine Land Cover 2000. Roads length, correspond to the 

length of highways and main roads in each 10x10 km square at the 1/10000 scale. 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 51 

Elevation range was obtained from the difference between maximum and minimum of 

altitude in each 10x10Km square, using raster data with a geographic accuracy of 

1000m (Table 3.1). The data with land use, roads and elevation maps were clipped to 

10x10 km UTM grid of Spain. ArcView 3.2, and its extensions Spatial Analyst, Patch 

Analyst and 3D Analyst, were the GIS software applications used.

Following hypotheses:  

H1) Prey diversity (small mammals and wild rabbits) is the single explanatory factor of 

wildcat distribution; H2) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and human disturbance 

interact; H3) Prey (small mammals and wild rabbits) and vegetation cover providing 

refuge/shelter are the limiting factors, human disturbance being not important; H4) All 

three factors are equally (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.2). 

 

Figure 3.1. Model designed based in four hypotheses in order two 3 main factors: food 

availability, Vegetation cover and Human disturbance. Considering the Food availability 

fundamental to wildcat presence and are present in the 4 hypotheses

3.2.4 Data analyses  

Binary logistic regression was performed using the four hypotheses based on food, 

habitat and human disturbance descriptors to model of wildcat occurrence in 

Continental Spain and in the Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes. To accomplish that 

was used a training data sets that corresponded to a random subsets (n=2559, 1280 

presences and 1279 absences) (n=2052, 1025 Presences and 1027 absences) and 

(n=507, 255 Presences and 252 absences). The variables strongly correlate were 

excluded from the analysis, when rs &gt; 0.7, considering in the selection their correlation 

with wildcat presence and biological meaning. The Regression modelling performed 

using SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 2004) generate 22 models: 6 for Continental Spain and 6 

and 10 for respectively Mediterranean and Atlantic Spain biomes (Table 3.3). Candidate 

models were then confronted according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to 

assess model fit to the distribution data (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Briefly, under 

this approach each hypothesis is represented by one or several competing statistical 

models which are formulated a priori based on biological knowledge, and AIC provides 

an objective tool to rank these models and thus quantify the evidence for each 

hypothesis (Burnham and Anderson 2002).  

The predictive accuracy of the most parsimonious models was evaluated from Receiver 

Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots after plotting sensitivity values (true positive 

fraction) on the y-axis against their equivalent (1-specificity) values (false positive 

fraction) for different thresholds in x (Liu et al. 2005). The AUC measure from ROC 

curve is considered useful for comparing the performance of wildcat presence-absence 

model in a threshold-independent fashion (Fielding and Bell 1997). The ROC procedure 

offers a way of identifying an optimum probability threshold by simply reading the 

point on the curve at witch the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximized (Zweig 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 56 

and Campbell 1993). For this, was examined the model sensitivity (i.e., the probability 

of wildcat presence) and the specificity (probability of detecting only absences). 

 

3.3. RESULTS 

Models results (Table 3.4) for Continental Spain and for Mediterranean and Atlantic 

Spain biomes revealed that the number of small mammal species and elevation range 

had the highest and positive contribution for wildcat presence in Spain. In Atlantic 

biome elevation range was the most important predictor of wildcat presence. The 

importance of rabbit differed between Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes: it was 

positively correlated with wildcat presence in Spain and in the Mediterranean biome but 

not in the Atlantic when considered separately. Vegetation cover had positive (but less 

important) contribution for wildcat presence in the Continental Spain and in both 

biomes. Mediterranean and Atlantic. Non natural areas contributed negatively in Spain 

and Mediterranean areas but were positive in the Atlantic biome. Road length also 

contributed negatively to wildcat presence in Spain but not in Atlantic areas (Figure 3.3 

and Table 3.4). The application of the bests models for Continental Spain and Atlantic 

and Mediterranean biomes included tree common variables: Sm_N, Elev_range and 

Veg_cover (Table 3.4). In fact, the crosstab (Table 3.5) of best models accuracy in 

Continental Spain and the Mediterranean and Atlantic biomes show very similar 

performances.

3.4). The P value that maximized correct prognoses for Continental Spain (68.5%) was 

0.46 that correctly classifies presences (75.9%) and absences (61.2%). The same P 

value maximized the correct prognoses for Mediterranean biome (67.7%) that classifies 

75.8% of presences and 59.6% of absences. The P value for the best model for Atlantic 

biome was 0.5 with 77.9% of correct prognoses (79% presences and 76.9% of absences) 

(Figure 3.4). The classifications accuracy of the most parsimonious models for 

Continental Spain and Mediterranean and Atlantic biomes were then tested in 

independent data samples (i.e. n=1085, 542 Presences and 543 absences – Spain; 

n=982, 491 Presences and 491 absences – Mediterranean; n=507, 252 Presences and 

255 absences – Atlantic) reserved for model evaluation purposes. The classification on 

these new samples, to corresponding cut off’s, did not differ significantly from the 

training data sets and prognoses 69.8% of correct classifications for Continental Spain, 

74.1% for Mediterranean and 83.9% for Atlantic biomes. Respectively, the Spearman 

correlation between prediction and wildcat presences correlated significantly, rs = 0.429, 

0.415 and 0.552, P = 0.01 (Figure 3.4).

3.3.2 Mapping wildcat presence probability  

The probabilities of wildcat occurrence in Continental Spain show a highly fragmented 

pattern, with the species mostly restricted to Cantabrian, Basque and Pyrenees mountain 

range in North Atlantic regions, Central and Iberian mountains around the Northern 

plateau, and Subbetic and Penibetic mountains in southeast Spain (Figure 3.2b). 

Discordance is observed when comparing the resulting maps using presence probability

 63 

and the true presences, mainly in South Mediterranean regions, where the highest values 

of occurrence probability were scarce and fragmented. (Figure 3.2 a and b). 

In Mediterranean biome the probabilities shape clearly show a more negative scenario 

for wildcat presence, with the areas of central Spain presenting lowest classes of 

probability (Figure 3.2 d).  For the Atlantic Spain the wildcat occurrence probability 

show high values in all his range with the exception of Galicia region (Figure 3.2 c).  

 

3.4. DISCUSSION 

A set of models were run in two different biomes, Atlantic and Mediterranean, and in all 

Continental Spain using a group of descriptors based on fine scale information. The 

approach was to incorporate the advantages of correlative and mechanistic models to 

develop large-scale determinants that express the local individual requirements for wide 

ranging species occurring in distinct biomes. To address this, was selected the European 

wildcat that has a large geographical range, some ecological tolerance, but suffering a 

constrained in its distribution range (Stahl and Artois 1994). First step was to list all 

relevant information about the species, analyzed identical features between same types 

of descriptors and built new predictors. In fact, the mechanistic and correlative models 

presents some problems, related with the scale of application, either because of the 

local/regional species linkage variables changed along biomes and global predictors 

have problems of interpretation (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Johnson and Omland 

2004, Helmuth et al. 2005). The success of developed models that incorporates 

advantages of correlative and mechanistic model approaches depends greatly of detailed 

biological information on target species. Nevertheless, large-scale approaches may 

disregard landscape patterns important for regional conservation of the species habitat, 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 64 

which can be found at fine-scale (Fernández et al. 2003). This is particularly for habitat 

models, once the large-scale don’t reflect the landscape structure features selected at 

individual home range level that high probably correlates with prey resources. The 

relation between fine scale landscape predictors and prey density can be interpreted as a 

likely mechanism to explain habitat quality at a higher level (Fernández et al. 2003). 

The inclusion of prey predictors in this model approach revealed the importance of fine 

scale landscape features through the weak predictive power of large types of vegetation. 

At large scale model this kind of landscape detailed is not available, so was taken to 

incorporate a predictor that relates to main prey resources.  

What are the main factors that affect wildcat distribution in Spain using a “hybrid” 

mechanistic-correlative model approach? 

Wildcat natural history and behaviour obtained from ecological research at fine scale 

suggests the importance of small mammals as prey for the species, as well the negative 

influence of human disturbance. In fact, recent study performed at fine scale in south of 

Portugal (Monterroso et al. 2009), reveal that that topographic unevenness were also 

considered key features for wildcat distribution, and with prey availability explained up 

85% of species occurrence in the study area (Monterroso et al. 2009). 

The generalized idea that the European wildcat shows different requirements along its 

distribution range, and that these differences are stronger across biomes, mainly 

between temperate forest and Mediterranean vegetation (Stahl and Artois 1994, McOrist 

and Kitchener 1994, Lozano et al. 2003, Biró et al. 2004), were not observed at large 

scale using information from fine-scale. It is true that, Atlantic areas have a distinct 

habitat composition from Mediterranean biome, the vegetation types are clearly 

different, such as the minor extend of agriculture areas, opposed to large extensions of 

agriculture fields in Mediterranean. The positive relation of Non natural with wildcat 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 65 

presence in output models of Atlantic biome, in contrast with a negative association of 

this variable in Mediterranean areas; reflect the expression of this descriptor in different 

biomes at large scale. The differences reflect the importance of habitat variables to prey 

availability, with the smallest patches of pasture in the Atlantic linkage to rodent 

availability and the largest extension of agriculture fields in Mediterranean with the 

lower rabbit density. Once the prey availability predictors were included in the model 

construction the influence of habitat as descriptors of wildcat presence decreased.    

In fact, the more important descriptors (Sm_N and Elev_range) for wildcat presence in 

Atlantic and Mediterranean biomes still occur in Continental Spain. This is the first 

large scale study that analyses the main wildcat requirements, including prey 

availability, vegetation cover and human disturbance, based on regional/local species 

knowledge. The inclusion of food resources is a very important step, once these reveal 

the true relation between wildcat and its habitat, as well as species-prey type selection. 

Apparently the type of vegetation cover is not so important in the distribution of the 

wildcat; this is reinforced by the fact that the species is more habitat generalist than first 

suspected, not behaving as strictly forestall (Stahl and Artois 1994, Sarmento 1996, 

Lozano et al. 2003, Sarmento et al. 2006). Lozano et al. (2003) refers the relevance of 

scrublands for wild-living cats, in particularly the scrub-pastureland mosaic landscape 

were wild rabbits are more abundant, and high shrub cover at a microhabitat scale, 

rather than forests at a macro habitat scale. But for a species more generalist in the use 

of habitat types, the vegetation predictors many times are linkage to prey availability, 

not reflect the real importance for species occurrence. Klar et al. (2008) refer the 

importance of forest for the wildcat, referring that alone does not fully explain the 

species habitat use, once the riparian areas within forest, as edge habitats often provide 

higher diversity and abundance of small prey mammals than the interior forest. The 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 66 

relationship between prey availability and vegetation structure, namely the importance 

of pastures – scrubland mosaics for the wild rabbit in Mediterranean areas of Iberian 

Peninsula (Lozano et al. 2003) is a good example how the wildcat presence is indirectly 

relate to vegetation type, as consequence of main prey-vegetation link.  

The marked Mediterranean areas, dominated by sclerophylous vegetation, are usually  

related with a main “single-key-prey” - wild rabbits (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et 

al. 1999, Lozano et al 2006, Monterroso et al. 2009), inversely to Atlantic regions, 

mainly covered, by mix and broad leaved forests, in which “grouped-key-preys – small 

mammals”, are more available. These leads to a fundamental issue, that is the role of 

habitat, nearest related to prey availability and composition, and the main difference 

between Atlantic and Mediterranean areas, since both vegetation types provide good 

conditions for sheltering (Stahl and Artois 1994, Revilla et al. 2001, Lozano et al. 2003, 

Sarmento et al. 2006). In fact, habitat edges define a transitional line between different 

types of habitat, particularly relevant when relating to pastures and cover vegetation. 

Many rodents, birds and wild rabbits use these ecotones, and they are followed by a 

diversity of predators. Nevertheless, the importance of small mammals for the wildcat, 

well marked in Atlantic areas, still occurs in Mediterranean areas, where these prey 

represents the most relevant predictor for species occurrence, opposed to the idea of 

rabbit specialization in Mediterranean areas. Probably the wildcats take advantage of 

local wild rabbit’s abundance.  

Besides food and shelters, human disturbance is very important to explain the shape 

pattern of wildcat occurrence. In fact, the elevation up to a certain range can ensure 

optimal conditions for wildcat: low disturbance, food and shelter resources. In the 

Atlantic Spain elevation range represents the most relevant descriptor for wildcat 

presence, suggesting that these mountains region probably protected the species from 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 67 

the human activities, these explain the high level of shape probability for wildcat 

occurrence in this area. This importance appears reflected in Mediterranean areas where 

the mountains show high probability for species presence. Mermod et al. (2002), 

suggest that the European wildcat in Switzerland uses high elevations in summer for 

two reasons: they are able to obtain food resources and there are fewer human 

settlements. Alternatively, in some cases this occurrence may result from range 

contractions from human-impacted lower elevation areas leaving remnant populations 

in more mountainous regions. Nevertheless, the number and distribution of households 

and human settlements can differ from people density. Large villages and cities 

concentring human settlements and highest values of people density, or a dispersal 

occupation with lower rates of human population but distributed by a largest area, 

represents different disturbance scenarios for the wildcat. 

Wildcat conservation implications 

Broad scale predictors of wildcat distribution are essential to address global 

conservation strategies, with the ultimate goal of a defined action plan for the species in 

the Iberian Peninsula. The large scale results confirm the variety of habitats used by the 

wildcat, and this probably reflects the foraging behaviour on the search for small 

mammals and rabbits. Nevertheless, fine scale studies should still be performed; in fact 

the fine scale landscape analysis is very relevant to understand patterns of breeder 

abundance, and consequent local habitat management (Vanreusel and Dyck 2007, 

Fernández et al. 2003). The conservations measures for the wildcat must promote prey 

availability; which is dependent of natural vegetation and low levels of agricultural 

intensification. Over decades, in rural areas, people conducted small-scale shrub 

clearing by cattle grazing or by facilitating access to exploitation areas, resulting in a 

highly diverse landscape matrix. These landscape mosaics promote prey availability, 



CHAPTER 3. Large scale determinants of European wildcat distribution in the Iberian Peninsula 
 

 

 68 

specially rabbits and rodents (Bolger et al. 1997, Lozano et al. 2003). The modern 

world changes in agriculture practices, transforming natural and small diverse 

agriculture patches into large monocultures, reduced the prey availability for the 

wildcat. The same situation occurs when large amounts of private areas are devoted to 

big game hunting, with a landscape matrix dominated by shrubs and high density on big 

game species, lead to decreasing prey abundance, especially rabbits (Delibes-Mateos et 

al. 2008, Lozano et al. 2007). Environmental measures aiming wildcat conservation 

have to focus on the increase of prey, specially rodents and rabbits. Global changes, like 

land-use and climate change, could promote the contraction range for rodents species 

and irregular oscillations in their populations abundance, especially those with high 

level of specialization, depending on specific conditions to occur. This will pronounce a 

particular impact for species that have rodents as key-prey; witch is the case of wildcat. 

Another important aspect is the role of human disturbance, still poorly known, but 

probably highly complex, once they reflect direct (persecution) and indirect human-

wildcat interactions (habitat fragmentation, domestic cats hybridization). Understand 

these interactions and the level how they affect the wildcat occurrence is highly priority 

in species conservation. The present work can be used as a powerful tool to assess the 

conservation value of sites for the wildcat occurrence in Iberia Peninsula and contribute 

to effective conservation planning for the species.

Abstract 

Domestic cats ranging freely in natural areas are a conservation concern due to competition, 

predation, disease transmission or hybridization with wildcats. There is little information on the 

factors affecting their numbers and space use in natural areas, impairing our ability to design 

effective control policies. We describe the patterns of cat presence, abundance and space use 

and analyse the associated environmental and human constraints in a well-preserved  

Mediterranean natural area with small scattered local farms. We failed in detecting cats in areas 

away from human settlements (trapping effort above 4000 trap-nights), while we captured 30 

individuals near farm houses. We identified a total of 130 cats, all of them in farms still in use 

by people (30% of 128 farms). All cats were free-ranging and very wary of people. The main 

factor explaining the presence of cats was the presence of people, while the number of cats per 

farm was mostly affected by the occasional food provisioning with human refuse and the 

presence of people. The home ranges of eight radiodiotagged cats were centred at farms. Males 

went furthest during the mating season (3.8 km on average, maximum 6.3 km), using farms as 

stepping stones in their mating displacements (2.2 km of maximum inter-farm distance moved). 

All cats showed a strong preference for human settlements, followed by areas at less than 200 m 

from roads and with a lower slope. In their daily movements cats notably avoided entering areas 

with high fox density.  

Synthesis and applications. Contrary to our expectations, we failed in detecting cats living 

independently of people. The presence, abundance and space use of cats was heavily dependent 

on human settlements. Any strategy aiming at reducing their numbers in natural areas should 

limit the presence of people and avoid any access to human refuse. The number of individuals 

moving into well preserved areas can be controlled by increasing the distance between 

settlements and by preserving the community of native carnivores. When controlling human 

presence is not possible, the alternative would be neutering and vaccinating the cats, especially

4.1. INTRODUCTION 

The presence of domestic species in natural areas often represents a conservation 

problem due to competition with and predation of wild species, because they act as 

reservoirs for many diseases and even due to the potential hybridization with the wild 

ancestor types (Gittleman et al. 2001). The domestic cat Felis catus is no exception and 

is currently considered a major conservation problem. It is the carnivore species with a 

wider distribution range, being present in all continents and in many islands, including 

several subantartic islands (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986, Matias and Catry 2007, 

Bergstrom et al. 2009). Cats have accompanied humankind in all phases of exploration 

and colonization, and have been accidentally or deliberately introduced to most of the 

terrestrial ecosystems of the world (Fitzgerald and Turner 2000). In some cases, they 

have adapted with great success to new environments such as island ecosystems where 

they became a successful invader being today dominant predators that cause a very 

relevant impact on breeding seabird colonies and endemic species (Rensburg and Bester 

1988, Nogales et al. 2004). In mainland areas, house cats also have a record as a 

subsidised exotic predator of native species (Woods et al. 2003). In addition to their 

predatory impact, domestic cats act as reservoirs in the transmission of numerous 

diseases to other species (Artois and Remond 1994, Daniels et al. 1999). In the case of 

the Iberian lynx, the most endangered feline of the world, the transmission of Feline 

Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) by domestic cats 

may become a serious threat to their populations (Meli et al. 2009, Millán et al. 2009). 

A recent outbreak of FeLV in one of the two surviving Iberian lynx populations resulted 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 79 

in the infection of 13 individuals (24% prevalence) and in the subsequent death of 6 of 

them. The phylogenetic analyses of the virus strains indicated that the infection most 

likely originated from the domestic cats invading the lynx habitats (Meli et al. 2009). In 

contrast to the reservoir role of the domestic cat, FeLV was highly virulent to lynxes. 

Another major problem of free ranging domestic cats is introgressive hybridization with 

wildcats Felis silvestris (Randi and Ragni 1991, Hubbard et al. 1992). Extensive 

hybridization has been described in Hungary and Scotland, contrasting with occasional 

interbreeding in Italy and Germany (Beaumont et al. 2001, Daniels et al. 2001, 

Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Oliveira et al. 2008). Much of the hybridizations probably 

occurred in areas where the contact between the two species is more common. The 

impact of domestic cats depends on where they can be found and on the factors 

controlling their numbers and space use. Pet cats are found in large numbers in urban 

and suburban areas around the globe. However, the main conservation threats are posed 

by cats whose needs are not satisfied by people (at least not intentionally). Stray and 

feral cats live and reproduce with little or no human intervention and survive by 

scavenging or hunting. The almost unlimited food supplies that cities provide allow for 

the presence of vast numbers of feral cats; for example about 30 million cats are 

estimated to live in the streets of the United States (Grimm 2009). The number of feral 

cats follows the gradient of availability of human-related food resources form urban and 

suburban to rural areas, where the availability is much lower than in cities. Within this 

gradient, cat populations exhibit varying degrees of dependence on humans, and it is 

generally assumed that feral cats can live and reproduce freely in well preserved natural 

areas (Paltridge 2002, Biró et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2007). The most dangerous 

domestic cats are precisely those living or expending time in natural areas, where they 

have an easier access to rare or endangered prey, may get in contact with wild 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 80 

endangered carnivores and may interbreed with wildcats. In this paper we investigate 

the factors associated with 92 the presence, abundance and space use by domestic cats 

in a gradient between a well-preserved natural area and a rural area with very low 

human density distributed in isolated farm settlements within a heterogeneous 

Mediterranean landscape in the South of the Iberian Peninsula. The area is 

representative of well preserved Mediterranean habitats where wildcats can still persist 

and where reintroduction programs of Iberian lynx are expected to be implemented 

(Anonymous 2008). We aim at describing the patterns of occurrence and abundance of 

domestic cats, as well as to evaluate home range, movements and habitat use and the 

environmental and human constraints associated to them. A priori, we expected that cats 

will be heavily dependent on human-related descriptors for individuals inhabiting near 

human settlements, while environmental features, such as those describing the 

availability of food and/or protection, should become much more relevant for cats living 

independently far from settlements. The information on those human and environmental 

determinants should prove useful when managing populations of domestic cats in the 

most sensitive natural areas. 

 

4.2. METHODS 

4.2.1. Study area 

The study was carried out in Moura-Barrancos Natura 2000 site (43,309 ha) and part of 

a Bird Special Protection Area, encompassing the agroforestry areas around the village 

of Barrancos in the Southeast Portuguese-Spanish border (between 38º13’N - 37º57’N 

and 7º24’O - 6º59’O, Figure 4.1). This landscape is a typically well-preserved 

Mediterranean forested area, dominated by holm oak woodlands (Quercus rotundifolia), 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 81 

patches of sclerophylous scrubland and rocky areas and boulders along the main rivers 

and streams. Elevation ranges between 200 and 400 m. There are no villages within the 

Natura 2000 site and human settlements are reduced to isolated traditional farm houses. 

The climate is characterized by dry and hot summers and cold winters. Human activity 

is restricted to cattle rising, traditional agriculture and game hunting in an agro-silvo-

pastoral system characterized by a heterogeneous combination of patches with open tree 

cover for cattle grazing (montado or dehesa) and shrubby forest patches. Moura-

Barrancos Natura 2000 study site belongs to two municipalities: Barrancos, with a 

single village occupied by about 1,800 people (with a municipal density of 10.7 

inhabitants/km²) and Moura, that encompasses five small villages close to the study area 

(17.1 inhabitants/km²). The study area offers a very suitable habitat for wildcats and the 

gradient between no human occupation to isolated farm houses offers a landscape 

context where hybridization between wild and domestic cats might occur. The Natura 

2000 site was created, among other reasons, because it was one of the last strongholds 

of the Iberian lynx in Portugal (Pires and Fernandes 2003).

4.2.2. Distribution of domestic cats 

4.2.2.1 Live-and photo-trapping 
 

In order to estimate the presence of cats we implemented a live-trapping program both 

in scrubland areas and at farm houses. In the first case we selected areas with potentially 

high quality for wildcats in a range of distances to the nearest farm house (with a range 

of 1.3 to 4.5 km to the nearest house). Trapping occurred between February and July 

2006 and March and July 2007 with 14 box-traps (model 608, Tomahawk Live Trap 

Co., Wisconsin, United States of America). Traps were baited with a live pigeon to 

maximise the capture probability of both domestic and wildcats. The pigeon was fed 

and protected inside the trap to avoid being captured by cats. We located box-traps in 

places 140 with thick vegetation or rocky cover, separated by 300-500m of distance. 

Traps were checked daily after sunrise. Additionally, we performed two campaigns of 

phototrapping in the same areas. In the first site we used nine cameras (Cam TrakkerTM 

143 , Watkinswille, GA, USA) from March to May 2006, while in the second area we 

used 11 cameras from May to August 2006. Cameras were also baited with a protected 

pigeon. The trapping campaign at farms occurred in January and May 2007 in 10 farms 

within our study area. Live trapping was carried out around households using five traps 

per farm. Traps were baited with fresh fish and were checked twice a day (sunrise and 

sunset). The animals captured were weighted after being anaesthetized with an intra-

muscular injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitors, Espoo, Finland; 

0.1mgmL-1150 ) and ketamine hydrochloride (Imalgenes, Lyon, France; 1 gmL-1151 ) 

in a 2:1 proportion. After handling, 0.08 mg/kg of Antisedan was administered for 

reversal. The age (young/adult) of animals was estimated from body weight and 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 84 

dentition. We considered adults those animals with full adult dentition and a weight 

above 2.5 kg or 3.5kg for females and males respectively (Liberg et al. 2000). 

 

4.2.2.2 Cat presence and abundance at farms 
 

We identified all farms inside our study area and evaluated the presence and number of 

cats during survey visits. We complemented this information with interviews to the 

owners/workers to obtain information on their use of the farm, the number and type of 

non seen cats and on their relationship with cats (including food provisioning). We used 

a ground-validated 1:5,000 orthophoto (year 2005) to build the digital cartography on 

land cover. We considered three land cover classes: human settlements, corresponding 

to the building areas in farms and other human settlements; natural vegetation, including 

sclerophylous vegetation, coniferous forests and riparian vegetation, and agro-forestry 

areas, which consisted in the oak montado-dehesas without understory and olive groves 

(Table 4.1). Additionally, we used a digital elevation model (DEM) in raster format (10 

m resolution) obtained from a 1: 25,000 vectorial topographic map. Slope was derived 

from the DEM using second-order finite differences, and ranged from 0 to 41º. Roads 

and rivers were digitised from 1: 250,000 maps, corresponding to the length of paved 

roads and main rivers. Environmental and human-related variables were determined 

within a circle centred at each farm with an area of 1km² (Table 4.1).

4.2.3. Analyses 

We analysed the environmental and human-related factors affecting the presence of cats 

at farms using generalised linear models with a binomial error distribution and a logit 

link function in R software. We considered that two variables were strongly correlated 

when rs &gt; 0.7, using only the one with a higher correlation with the dependent variable. 

In total we generated 17 a priori models of cat presence at farms based on three groups 

of hypotheses depending on the combination of variables: 1) human influence; 2) 

environmental variables; or 3) a combination of both (Table 4.2). In the case of cat 

abundance we used a Poisson distribution with a log link. Following the same procedure 

we generated 16 candidate models (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). We used the Akaike 

Information Criterion (AIC) to rank the models according to their capacity to 

parsimoniously describe the data (Burnham and Anderson 2002).

4.2.3.1 Domestic cats space use 
 

In order to describe the patterns of space use and the factors associated 187 with it we 

radio tagged eight domestic cats captured at four farms in 2007. All the farms are well 

preserved game areas (Figure 4.1): Noudar Castle (NC), which with 980 ha is located 

inside the Natural Park; Coutada Frades (CF) with 468 ha and Contenda Forest Area 

(CFA) with 5309 ha, and Russianas (RUS) with 1480 ha, both of which are partially 

devoted to grazing. The eight cats (5 males, 3 adults and 2 subadults; 3 adult females) 

were fitted with radio-collars with activity sensors (Telonics model 105, Telonics Inc, 

Mesa, AZ, USA). We located cats by triangulation using two bearings taken at less than 

10 minutes apart to minimize errors caused by animal movements. Only bearings 

between 60º and 120º were accepted. Fixes were calculated by LOCATE with 95% 

error ellipses using length maximum likelihood estimators. We evaluated the location 

error (~64m) during trials when the cats were in known locations inside the farms. The 

animals were located on average 2-3 times per day at any time in the 24h. On average 

we tracked cats for 10 ± 0.7 (±SD) months, obtaining an average of 176 ± 14.8 fixes per 

animal.  

4.2.3.2 Home range 
 

We estimated the home range utilization distribution of the radio-marked animals using 

a kernel estimator (kernelUD function, adehabitat package in R software). The 

utilization distribution is the bivariate function giving the probability density that an 

animal is found at a given point according to its geographical coordinates. Using this 

model, the home range can be defined as the minimum area in which an animal has 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 88 

some specified probability of being located. Individual home ranges were estimated for 

the 95% utilization distributions. 

4.2.3.3 Habitat selection 
 

We investigated the habitat use of cats using five covariates which expand in habitat 

categories (Table 4.1). We compared between the habitat used by the tracked cats and 

the habitat available within their home ranges. First we used a compositional analysis to 

obtain a rank order of preferences, testing the overall significance of the selection with a 

Wilks lambda and then building a ranking matrix. Additionally we used the 

eigenanalysis of selection ratios and the graphical approach developed by Calenge and 

Dufour (2006) to describe habitat selection. This method undertakes an additive linear 

partitioning aiming at maximizing the difference between habitat use and availability in 

the first factorial axes. The habitat types with a selection ratio between 0 and 1 are used 

below their availability while those above 1 are positively selected. The analyses were 

computed using the adehabitat package in the R software v.9.1. 

 
4.2.3.4 Daily movements 
 

We analysed the environmental and human-related factors affecting the length of the 

movements of the radiomarked cats using the displacements built with one location per 

day (we selected the two consecutive locations as close as possible to 24 hours). We 

used generalised linear mixed models using the length of the daily displacement as 

response variable and a group of independent variables related to sampling features 

(sex, season) and environmental and human-related factors (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). Each 

displacement was divided by location error (64 m) in order to standardize the length size 

and avoid overdispersion. In this way the analysis will show mostly the determinants of 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 89 

longer displacements. The variables quantifying the percentage of land use classes along 

the displacements were built using a 5 m buffer around each displacement vector (Table 

4.1). We included several variables describing the probability of encountering other 

carnivores during the displacement. With this purpose we performed a total of 54 

transects of 1 km in which we surveyed signs of carnivore presence within the minimum 

convex polygon defined by all the locations of the marked cats. Transects were located 

randomly in areas in which we had entrance granted by landowners, along dirt roads or 

foot-paths facilitating the surveys. We built a kernel utilization distribution for each 

species using all the signs of presence detected and an additional one for all the species 

combined. We used the number of kernel probability isolines (in 5% increments) 

crossed by cat displacements as a proxy of potential competition between wild 

carnivores and domestic cats (Table 4.1). Again, we removed one independent variable 

when it showed a strong correlation with other one, retaining the one with the higher 

correlation with the dependent variable. We used a code identifying each individual as a 

random factor in all models, obtaining a total of 22 a priori models according to the 

potential factors that could affect the displacements (Table 4.2). Models were run using 

Lme4 package in R software v.2.9.1.

n= 22 in respect to movements. The best models for each hypothesis are represented by an 

alternative statistical model, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) provides an objective tool 

to rank the models. The best models present lowest AIC value (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).

4.3. RESULTS 

4.3.1 Domestic cats distribution 

In spite of our initial expectations and efforts we were unable to detect any cat in the 

two trapping sites selected in the natural area away from farms (Figure 4.1). At the 

northern trapping site, with an effort of 1464 trap-nights we live-captured seven 

common genets Genetta genetta, seven red foxes Vulpes vulpes, three Egyptian 

mongooses Herpestes ichneumon, three badgers Meles meles and two stone martens 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 91 

Martes foina. At the same site, we obtained a total of 498 photos with a total effort of 

612 trap-nights. Considering only one capture per day and camera we photo-captured 15 

wildboars Sus scrofa, 13 red foxes, eight badgers, eight genets, seven mongooses and 

four stone martens. Similarly, at the Southern site, with an effort of 1117 trap-nights, we 

live captured 12 red foxes, five mongooses, three badgers, two genets, and two stone 

martens. Photo-trapping provided a total of  photos with a total effort of 814 trap-nights, 

including 22 red deer Cervus elaphus, eight wildboars, nine foxes, eight genets, seven 

mongooses, five badgers, and two stone martens. On the contrary, at the ten farms 

where we carried out a total trapping effort of 297 trap nights we captured 30 different 

cats: 12 males (of which eight were adults) and 18 females (12 adults).  

4.3.1.1 Cats presence and abundance at farms 

In total we identified 128 farms within our study area of which 86 (67.2%) had no 

resident people. Many of them were abandoned or even in ruins. There were no cats in 

the abandoned houses. The average distance to the nearest house was 1.1 ± 5.51 km. 

The 42 farms in use (32.8%) give a density of 0.09 farms km-2. Cats were present in 39 

of them (92.5%), with a total of 130 individuals (3.3 ± 1.85 cats per farm) and a density 

of 0.26 cats km-2 274 (this density excludes the area of the village of Barrancos and a 

buffer of 3 km around). The sex ratio of 88 individuals (29 males, 59 females) was 

1M:2F but for the remaining 41 individuals sex was unknown. The average nearest 

distance between farms with cats was 2.7 ± 12.7 km. Farm owners or residents 

considered all cats to be free ranging i.e., they were no kept as pets. In none of the farms 

the cats received veterinary support. Food provisioning was never provided on a regular 

basis, with 33 farms feeding cats only sporadically with human refuse (84.6 % of the 

occupied houses). Except for one cat out of the 130, farm owners defined them as very 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 92 

wary (cannot be captured by hand, fleeing when approached). The best model 

describing the presence of domestic cats in farms included the presence of people and 

the length of roads and rivers around the farm (explained 30.5% of the deviance); the 

next best model included only the first two variables (models A8 and A17, Table 4.2). 

The most important predictor of cat presence was the occupation of farms by people, 

accounting for 90.6% of the deviance explained by the best model (Table 4.3). The 

other two predictors are also associated to the farms that are more intensively used by 

people, either because they are better communicated (road length) or because the area is 

more suitable for small-scale traditional agriculture (river length). These results go 

against our initial expectation that presence of cats in natural sites far from urban, 

suburban and rural areas would rely more heavily on environmental than on human-

related variables. In the analysis of the variables that influence the number of domestic 

cats all models with the highest support included food supplementation by people and 

the presence of people (Table 4.2). The most supported model (B8, Table 4.2) also 

included the mean slope around the farm, which had a negative effect (Table 4.3). 

Together the two human related variables explain 83.2% of model deviance, with partial 

contributions of 45.1% and 38.2%, respectively for cats_feed and people. As in the 

analysis of cat presence, human factors seem to have the greatest influence in the 

number of cats per household farm, while environmental factors are probably linked to 

farm location.

4.3.2 Space use 

4.3.2.1 Home range 
 

The area covered by all the radiolocations of the marked cats was 10,416 ha (calculated 

as the minimum convex polygon). All individual home ranges included the farm where 

each cat was captured (Figure 4.1). The average of the maximum distance between the 

capture site  (farm) and the furthest radio location was 2.9±1.8 km, ranging between 1.2 

and 6.3 km. Male home range sizes were larger than those of females, with 430 ha 

(range 71 - 1476) and 87 ha (41 – 113), respectively. There was a substantial inter-

sexual home range overlap (Figure 4.1). Home ranges were centred in farm buildings, 

but in some occasions males moved away to another farm or to the village. In fact, the 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 94 

furthest distances away from the farm belong to males during the mating season 

(autumn-winter), on average 3.8 ± 2.2 km (with a maximum of 6.4 km) vs 1.6 ± 0.7 km 

out of the mating season; for females the average furthest distance was 1.2 for both 

seasons (± 0.4 and ± 0.3, respectively). The maximum distances that males travelled are 

associated to the distance to the nearest farm with cats (r2 = 0.67) only during the 

mating season (r2 = 0.0 outside the season). Males used farms as stepping stones in their 

mating displacements; the maximum inter-farm distance moved was 2.2 km while the 

male that never made any excursion to other farm was 3.4 km away from the nearest 

occupied farm. None of the females moved between farms. 

4.3.2.2 Habitat selection 
 

The radio-tracked cats did not use the habitat within their home ranges at random (? = 

0.0122, P = 0.0080). The compositional analysis showed that there was a clear 

preference order headed by human settlements (House), followed by areas at less than 

200 m from roads and with a smaller slope (Table 4.4). Steep areas, far from roads and 

covered with natural vegetation were the less preferred (Table 4.4). The eigenanalysis of 

selection ratios confirmed those clear preferences. The results for the first two axes 

explain 93.3 % of the information (74.4 % for the first axis and 18.1 % for the second, 

Figure 4.2 in Supporting Information). House was the land-use type more used by cats; 

in fact seven of the eight individuals made it their first choice as shown by the highest 

selection ratios (Table 4.4). The selection ratios for the remaining habitats show that 

human settlements play an important role because cats spent most of their time in the 

areas around the houses, i.e, close to roads and with low slope (Table 4.4).

4.3.2.3 Daily movements 
 

We obtained a total of 339 daily displacements with a mean length of 605 ± 743 m, and 

an average time span of 20 ± 8 hours. The results of the linear mixed model showed that 

sex did not affect the daily displacements and that season only appeared in 3 of the 7 

models with wAIC&gt;0.05 (Table 4.2). Environmental variables seem to be very relevant 

in explaining the length of the daily displacements. In fact, the most supported model 

includes the average number of red fox 5% kernel isolines crossed, the elevation range, 

the number of roads and rivers crossed and the number of patches of natural vegetation 

crossed. The most important variable in all models was the proxy for red fox encounter 

probability, having a strong negative effect on daily displacement (Table 4.3). The 

positive effects of elevation range and number of roads and rivers crossed probably 

represents the differences in elevation when the animals moved far away from farms, 

since the households where we marked the cats are located at elevated places, and the 

further they moved away, the more probable it was that they crossed a road or a river. 

 

 

 

4.4 DISCUSSION 

 

Initially we expected to find cats living in a range of densities following the gradient of 

human occupation of the landscape. We also expected that cats living in natural areas 

far away from human settlements and living independently of people, i.e. relying on 

natural resources, should be more affected by environmental variables. However, we 

were unable to detect cats living freely far away from people. Our trapping effort was 

large enough to assume that in our natural area there were no cats living independently 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 97 

of people. The presence and number of cats was dependent on the presence of people 

and the resources they provide. In fact, the area around buildings was the preferred land 

use type for cats, as confirmed by the highest value of selection ratios. Many of the 

farms were abandoned along the past century, when human density in natural areas was 

higher. At the maximum of farm occupation cat density was probably much higher than 

nowadays (three times higher assuming the same distribution of cats per farm). 

Nowadays, the reduced pressure of domestic cats in Mediterranean natural areas can be 

relevant for the conservation of wildcats and Iberian lynx. Cats do not live far away 

from people in our area. However, it is generally assumed that feral cats can live 

independently of people in well preserved natural areas, as demonstrated by studies in 

some islands and in Australia (eg. Rensburg and Bester 1988, Paltridge 2002, Phillips et 

al. 2007). The evidence for other areas is very poor. In Scotland, Daniels et al. (2001) 

found that their putative wildcats were in contact with farm cats; in a natural area of 

Hungary the marked feral cats were close to farms, and their home ranges were at less 

than 2 km from one city and a village (Biró et al. 2004); and in northern France, 

domestic cats centred their home ranges in a village or around farms (Germain et al. 

2008). Studies on feral cats are commonly located in urban and suburban areas (eg. 

Barrat 1997, Say and Pontier 2004) and even in inhabited small islands feral cats tend to 

rely on people (Yamane et al. 1996). It is therefore clear that high human density 

supports higher cat densities in natural or semi-natural areas, linking the expansion 

success of cats to different levels of human occupation. It remains to be explained how 

feral cats can live in islands on their own. We all have seen domestic cats roaming in 

natural areas far away from any human settlement. Cat home ranges are centred on 

farms, but males can make long displacements in search of females during the mating 

season (see also Barratt 1997, Germain et al. 2008). In fact, female distribution and 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 98 

density is the primary factor determining male range size (Liberg et al. 2000), as 

demonstrated by the relation between the maximum distance travelled in a season and 

the distance to the nearest farm with females. The furthest excursion by a male was 6 

km away, but in this case the cat was using several farms as stepping stones. There 

seems to be a 3 km distance threshold between farms above which males cannot connect 

them. Germain, Benhamou and Poulle (2008) detected one male mating excursion 

between farms separated by 2.5 km. In summary, in natural areas cats can live strictly 

depending on only wild resources, as in some deserted islands, but the general pattern is 

that they do not, and they have the capacity to move long distances away from 

households, but they restrict their movements to the vicinity of human settlements. Like 

in islands, cats living in farms do not compete with other carnivores, but unlike the 

confined environment of islands, in many mainland areas they have to share space with 

other predators when moving away from houses. Our interpretation is that the 

differences in presence, abundance and movements of cats in natural areas of islands 

and mainland are also mediated by the presence and abundance of competing predators. 

Our results on the daily movements of cats show that they strongly avoided entering the 

areas with higher red fox density. In a study in New South Wales, after fox removal cats 

showed a significant resource shift, suggesting a strong interspecific competition 

mediated by both exploitation and interference (Molsher 1999). Foxes prey on cats and 

their kittens and cat remains have also been observed in fox diet samples in Europe and 

Australia (Fuchs 1972, Martin et al. 1996, Risbey et al. 1999).During our study all 

kittens from one female in Noudar Castle were predated by an Egyptian mongoose. In 

summary, feral or free ranging cats are more likely to be rare or absent in regions with 

well preserved wild predator populations. However, in areas with no other predator, 

such as many islands, or weak predator communities, such as humanized areas, feral 



CHAPTER 4. Environmental and Human Controls of Domestic Cats in Natural Areas 
 

 99 

cats may become the dominant predator and often exist at much higher densities than 

native predators. Our study provides a clear linkage between the distribution, numbers 

and movements of cats and several human and environmental factors that can be 

managed to reduce the pressure of domestic cats into natural areas. The presence of 

people is the first most important variable to be managed. The existence of small 

settlements or even isolated houses or farms represents a bridge allowing the intrusion 

of cats into the surrounding areas. The key here are those occupied by people and 

located in well preserved natural areas where we can find other species of conservation 

concern. The distance between houses is another key element that should be controlled 

since cats use them as stepping stones when moving. Even when residents do not own 

pet cats and do not directly provide food, there is a clear effect on cat presence. If we 

cannot manage the presence of people living in the field, in order to maintain low cat 

numbers, food provisioning should be banned while the access of cats to human refuse 

must be controlled. In the worst case scenario in which people is living in a network of 

well connected settlements and provisioning cats with food, males should be neuter to 

reduce the distances they move away from houses and to reduce the probability of 

hybridization, while veterinary support should be provided to reduce the prevalence of 

diseases in the population of domestic cats. In addition to these measures, an effective 

strategy for controlling hybridization and the transmission of diseases to other species 

involves maintaining the community of native predators, including red foxes. Finally, 

because private landowners are the ultimate controllers of their land, providing them 

with information is essential to increase the awareness of people before the 

implementation of any measure.

Abstract 

The knowledge of domestic cat Felis catus feeding ecology in natural and semi-natural areas is 

fundamental to understand the mechanisms that promote or limit the survival and expansion of 

this species in nature conservation places. Historical differences in human association with 

domestic cats and the wildcat Felis silvestris possibly reflect distinct foraging behaviours. A 

total of 407 scats were collected from nine latrine sites located in southeast Portugal. A random 

sample of field-collected scats of each latrine site was genetically analysed to ascertain their 

origin as genus Felis individuals. To further obtain an overview of domestic cat diet along its 

distribution range we analysed 57 studies, published since the forties, which report information 

on the species food regime in different places of the world. Human refuse was the most frequent 

item (76.05%) in scats collected from latrines located near the houses and rabbits (71.43%) were 

more frequent in scats found far from houses. Multivariate analysis confirmed the separation of 

two groups of scats based on prey items differentiation, near and far from houses. In a global 

evaluation of domestic cats’ diet, mammals revealed as the most important food item, and 

similarities were found between urban and natural areas, as opposed to findings in insular 

populations. Diet of the domestic cat expresses its dependence on people, even in natural areas, 

where prey diversity and availability is higher. Clear separation of scats collected in latrines 

near houses and those found far from human settlements and located in natural areas, typically 

associates with domestic and wildcats, respectively. To decrease domestic cats abundance in 

rural-natural areas of Iberian Peninsula, thus contribution to wildcat conservation, is crucial to 

limit food sources provided, directly or indirectly, by man.

5.1. INTRODUCTION 

The domestic cat Felis catus may be the most widespread predator in the world. Cats 

with dependable food sources are not, as other carnivores, vulnerable to changes in prey 

populations (Fitzgerald 1988). Moreover, unlike many native predators, domestic cats 

are not strictly territorial. As a result, cats can exist at much higher densities and may 

out-compete native predators for food (Bradshaw et al. 1996). Studies on the feeding 

habits of free-roaming domestic cats, conducted over the last decades in Europe, North 

America, Australia, Africa, and many islands, show that they prey on local wildlife, 

especially in “islands” habitats such as suburban and urban parks, and other areas 

surrounded by human development. In addition, it is in these habitats where the cats 

have more success as an opportunistic carnivore, preying on a vast range species and 

eating a wide variety of resources, revealing its versatility and unusual ability to utilize 

a broad spectrum of prey types and sizes (Pearre and Maass 1998). 

The largest number of studies regards places where the species represents a serious 

conservation problem, such as in islands, urban environments and Australia (Barrat 

1997, Arnaud et al 1993, Dowding and Murphy 2001). Since mid-nineties ~ 70 studies 

were carried out on the diet of domestic cat, but only 6 relate to Europe mainland 

natural/rural areas, inside European wildcat Felis silvestris distribution range. 

Moreover, assumptions on domestic cat vs European wildcat competition by food 

resources are rarely discussed (Daniels et al. 2001, Biró et al. 2005) and only two 

studies compare species diet (Corbett 1979, Biró et al. 2005). However, to establish an 

effective wildcat conservation strategy, knowing that its relations with domestic cat may 

pose a serious conservation problem, we have to concentrate in species interactions, 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 107 

including the hypothesis of a possible trophic niche overlap as emphasided already by. 

Corbett (1979) and Biró (2005). 

Regarding food requirements, wildcats consume a large diversity of prey but small 

mammals are the stapple prey in most areas of its distribution range (Condé et al. 1972, 

Sládek, 1973, Hewson 1983, Sarmento 1996, Moleón and Gil-Sánchez 2003, Carvalho 

and Gomes, 2004). However, these are replaced by wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus 

in most of the Mediterranean environments, such as the central and southern regions of 

the Iberian Peninsula (Malo et al. 2004, Gil-Sanchez et al. 1999, Lozano et al 2006). 

For domestic-cats to establish feral populations in natural areas, it is necessary that they 

are able to feed exclusively on natural prey, like wildcats. In rural areas, however, 

humans provide domestic cats maintenance resources that other predators do not receive 

(Coleman and Temple, 1993). As a result, they may exist in higher densities and exert a 

greater predatory effect than natural predators. Also, cats are opportunistic predators 

Coman and Brunner, 1972), both in terms of time and space (Barratt, 1997), meaning 

they will depredate whatever prey item they encounter. However, most studies link the 

success of cats’ predation on wildlife to places where they have a surplus of food 

provided directly or indirectly by people, or to areas where they not co-evolved with 

prey species, like in islands. Besides that, the presence (or absence) of other carnivore 

species must be taken into consideration when analysing the effects of domestic cats in 

wildlife, wildcats included. The disappearance of larger carnivores from a region can 

lead to what is known as “mesopredator release” (Fitzgerald 1988), in which the cats are 

free to roam freely and fill the ecological niche left by the first preying on smaller wild 

vertebrates. 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 108 

To understand man’s role on the survival of domestic cats in low humanised natural 

areas we used the information on scat contents from nine latrine-sites and analysed it 

relatively to distance from human settlements. Three hypotheses were upfront defined: 

1) In natural areas domestic cats feed on wild prey and are not dependent on 

resources made available by humans; 

2) Domestic cats do not roam and feed far from farm houses; 

3) Latrines found in the middle of scrubland-woodland habitat patches, far from 

farm houses, are wildcat-originated; 

To test these, we investigated if the worldwide food regime of domestic cats reveal any 

pattern that can be comparable to the scat results found at the fine scale (study area), 

e.g. is domestic cat regime prey-based as like rodents and rabbits in the wildcat diet. In 

addition, in areas where it is associated with man, as in urban areas, the basis of their 

diet is the resources provided by man. Moreover, in species so close is to be expected 

that in natural environments, with low human presence, occurs a feeding niche overlap.  

Despite the very tenuous morphological differences between the two species, that can 

lead to trophic niche overlap, the historical domestic cat - human association determines 

different eating behaviours. In terms of wildcat conservation, to know the food regime 

of domestic cats in natural areas is a key issue.

Spanish border (between 38º13’N - 37º57’N and 7º24’O - 6º59’O, Fig. 5.1), and is 

inhabited by species of carnivores with high conservation value. Moura-Barrancos 

Natura 2000 site belongs to two municipalities: Barrancos, with a single village 

occupied by about 1,800 people (resulting in a municipal density of 10.7 

inhabitants/km²) and Moura, that encompasses five small villages close to the study 

area (overall municipal density is 17.1 inhabitants/km²). Human settlements are 

represented by traditional farm houses scattered throughout the landscape, which offers 

a very suitable habitat for wildcats and contacts with domestic cats and other carnivore 

species might occur. The region is characterized by a highly fragmented and complex 

landscape structure, dominated by holm oak Quercus ilex and scrublands-woodlands, 

where three main rural activities are pursued simultaneously in a single space (livestock 

husbandry, agriculture and hunting). Interspersed with the major forestry type, there are 

agricultural fields (cereal, vegetables and olives) and forest plantations (eucalyptus and 

pines). A large range of temperatures, with mild winters and hot summers, characterizes 

the climate of this region. Precipitation levels are between 400-600mm per year, with 

average temperatures&amp;lt;18ºC in the coldest months and &gt;22ºC in the warmest months 

(Chícharo et al. 2001). Water is concentrated in rivers, streams and creeks, which have 

an intermittent regime.

travelled by domestic cats in the study area (Ferreira et al. submitted - Paper II of this thesis).   

 

 

5.2.2 Cats diet in the study area 

The diet of cats was investigated through the analysis of scats, routinely collected from 

latrines sites. A total of 407 scats originated from nine latrine sites, six monitored during 

2002 (N=173 scats) and three in 2007 (N=234). A random sample of field-collected 

scats of each latrine site was genetically analysed to ascertain that they were from 

individuals of the genus Felis, using a recently developed protocol with species-specific 

mitochondrial DNA markers for Iberian carnivores (Fernandes et al 2008). Distance 

between each latrine and the nearest human settlements was assessed using a 1km 

buffer around the latrine centre.. Three main groups were defined: i) the latrine was 

located in the middle of houses, ii) the latrine buffer included houses inside, and iii) the 

latrine buffer did not included any house. Then, each scat was analysed as a single 

sample. For the analysis, scats were immersed in water and all remains examined to 

separate bone fragments, teeth, hair, feathers, insect pieces, or other prey remains. The 

prey items categories considered in the analysis were rabbits, rodents, other small 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 111 

mammals, ungulates, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, other invertebrates and human 

refuse. Rodents and insectivores were identified to species level from their teeth 

(Santero and Alvarez, 1985) and hair (Teerink, 1991). As reported in most carnivore 

studies, results were expressed as the frequency of occurrence (FO) of the different prey 

items (Reynolds and Aebischer, 1991). To investigate if resources consumption was, 

directly or indirectly, associated with human presence, in opposition to the wild-prey 

based diet of wild carnivores such as wildcats, a linear discriminant analysis was 

performed using the three categories of latrine sites above described and a total of 18 

food resources categories: rabbitsD (rabbits in dry season), aposylD (wood mouse in dry 

season), musD (Mus sp. in dry season), passeD (passeriformes in dry season), alerufD 

(red-legged-partridge in dry season), repteilsD (reptiles in dry season), insectsD (insects 

in dry season), crayfishD (crayfish in dry season), human_refuseD (human refuse in dry 

season), rabbitsW (rabbits in wet season), aposylW (wood mouse in wet season), musW 

(Mus sp. in wet season), passeW (passeriformes in wet season), alerufW (red-legged-

partridge in wet season), repteilsW (reptiles in wet season), insectsW (insects in wet 

season), crayfishW (crayfish in wet season) and human_refuseW (human refuse in wet 

season). All items resulting in small samples sizes (n &amp;lt;20) were excluded from 

statistical analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis was also used in order to generate 

groups of scats based on the complete dataset (N=407). For pairs of correlated variables 

the one less significant to the dependent variable was excluded from further analysis. To 

test the null hypothesis of no significant difference in the mean of the dependent 

variable for the different groups (cluster plots), formed by categories of the explanatory 

variables (prey items), a multivariate analysis of variance – MANOVA, was performed. 

Significant differences resulting from multivariate analysis were examined with 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 112 

univariate F tests at the variable level to allow interpretation of the respective effect. 

Statistical analysis were performed with MASS package of R software. 

5.2.3 Domestic cat diet in the world 

For the overview of domestic cat diet along the distribution range we analysed fifty 

seven studies published since the forties that report information about the species food 

regime around the world (Table 5.1). To homogenize the sample and allow results 

comparison from different geographical areas we used some exclusion criteria from the 

sample: studies with small samples sizes (n &amp;lt;30) and data refering to a single season. 

Few other had also to be excluded, either because data was obtained by inquiries to cats’ 

owners (Woods et al. 2003, Baker et al. 2005) or FO values could not be estimated 

(Barrat 1997, Giles and Clout 2003). Prey types were rearranged to homogenize the data 

for comparative purposes, and FO was calculated when necessary. Seven prey items 

were considered: Rabbits, Rodents, Other Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Invertebrates and 

Human Refuse. Thirty one studies (54.3%) refer to insular habitats, sixteen (28.2%) to 

natural/rural areas and ten (17.5%) to urban areas. Of the studies referring to 

natural/rural areas, only four respect to areas out of Australia. The frequency of 

occurrence was the commonest measure made available by authors and was considered 

valid for comparative purposes (Reynolds and Aebischer, 1991). The prey items 

reported in the literature were collected and tabulated separately for each study. In some 

studies the food obtained by scavenging, or household is referred but data on the 

frequency of consumption is not available (Rodríguez-Moreno et al. 2007, Campos et 

al. 2007). Data compiled per study were: (i) type of food consumed (species and/or 

categories); (ii) frequency of occurrence [FO = (number of scats or gut samples with a 

particular item x 100)/(total number of scats or gut samples)]; (iii) number of carnivore

species (&gt; 2kg) that occurs in each study area. A linear discriminant analysis was 

performed using the data set of the 57 worldwide studies, classified as either to three 

types of areas: Islands, Urban or Natural area. To test the null hypothesis of no 

significant difference in the mean of the dependent variable for the different groups 

(cluster plots), formed by categories of the explanatory variables (prey items), a 

multivariate analysis of variance – MANOVA, was performed. Again, the significant 

differences resulting from multivariate analysis were examined with univariate F tests at 

the variable level to allow interpretation of the respective effect.

5.3 RESULTS 

5.3.1Cats diet in the study area 

The results of scat contents from latrines sites near and far from houses are summarised 

in table 5.2. Scats collected far from natural areas contained in average 1.44 different 

food items, while those near houses had 1.63. Human refuse was the most frequent item 

(76.05%) in scats collected at latrines close to houses but was absent in scats collected 

in latrines away from houses. Inversely, rabbits (71.43%) were the most consumed 

resource in scats found far from houses, showing little relevance (3.36%) in scats 

collected in latrines near human settlements. Rodents were the main vertebrate (58.8%) 

found in scats near the houses, with Mus sp (probably the house mouse – Mus 

domesticus) dominating (37.81%). This result contrasts with rodents’ frequency of 

occurrence (17.14%), in particular that of Mus sp. (4.0%), detected in scats collected in 

natural areas away from houses. The wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, on the contrary, 

was most consumed (9.71%) in areas away from houses (3.28% in scats near houses). 

These differences in the consumption of house and wood mice relate to the preferred 

habitats of each species, with the house mouse being associated to humanized 

environments and the wood mouse to bushes and forested areas (Blanco 1998). A fact to 

be emphasised was the occurrence of wild carnivores remains (two of common genets 

Geneta geneta and one of stone marten Martes foina) in scats collected at latrines 

placed far from human settlements. Birds, like insects, occurred in similar frequency in 

the scats collected at the latrine groups, near and far from houses. Reptiles were clearly 

more frequent (13.14% vs. 2.94%) in scats far from houses, and amphibians and 

crayfish, were only found in the scats collected far from households.

Figure 5.2. resulting from the linear discriminant analysis for the three groups of 

latrines, in spite of some overlap show a clear separation between the groups of latrines 

located near and far from human settlements, but those with houses inside the 1km 

buffer show an intermediate position along the gradient overlapping with both the 

previous groups.

function explains 95.7% of all variability, with the greatest contributions from the 

positive partial coefficients of reptilesW (2.31), rabbitsW (2.00), rabbitsD (1.99) and 

negative of crayfishD (-1.87), crayfishW (-1.87), human_refuseD (-1.12) and 

human_refuseW (-1.06) (Figure 5.3, Table 5.3a).  

 
Figure 5.3. Cluster dendogram based on items in each scat, calculated with Hierarchical Cluster 

Analysis 

 

The hierarchical cluster analysis, at the highest break point, generates two groups, 

corresponding to 259 and 147 scats respectively. The larger is dominated by scats 

collected near the houses (88%); in fact, 97.4% of scats collected in the vicinity of 

households are included in this group. Inversely, the small group is mostly composed by 

scats originated from natural places far from houses (82%), and 96.5% of that scat 

sample is here included. At a second level the small plot again subdivided in two other 

(N=129 and N=18) composed mainly (96.12% and 94.4%) by scats collected in latrines

from natural places far from houses. The differences of two plots were compared 

through MANOVA showing significant main effects between the two first-level groups 

(Pillai-Bartlett Trace=0.906, F1,404=208.05, P &amp;lt;0.001). RabbitsD (F1,404=206.56), 

aposylD (F1,404=11.12), musD (F1,404=19.22), Human_refuseD (F1,404=49.01), RepteilsD 

(F1,404=18.81), crayfishD (F1,404=114.35), rabbitsW (F1,404=198.73), crayfisW 

(F1,404=26.39), alerufW (F1,404=35.96), insectsW (F1,404=9.82) and Human_refuseW 

(F1,404=17.02) were the resources significantly associated to the main effects, with P 

values &amp;lt;0.001. The same applies to the second-level groups (Pillai-Bartlett 

Trace=0.906, F1,404=207.44, P &amp;lt;0.001), as well for the independent variables.  

Being the rabbit known as the main prey for wildcat in Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula, 

and appearing as a significant item in the results of previous analyses, we investigated if 

there was a relation between this species occurrence (presence/absence) and the number 

of items per scat. No significant relationship was found (r2 = -0.0047, F1,404=0.79, 

P=0.373), contrarily to what occurred with human refuse occurrence (r2 = 0.142, 

F1,404=66.12, P&lt;0.001).

5.3.2 Domestic cat diet in the world 

In a global evaluation of domestic cats’ diet in the world, mammals appeared as the 

most consumed resource although dominating species varied with habitat. Rabbits occur 

more frequently (number of areas that was the item with the biggest FO) in islands 

(35.4%) and natural areas (40%), being replaced by rodents (60%) in urban places. The 

second item that appears more times with the biggest FO, in islands, were birds 

(22.3%). In Natural areas were rodents, human refuse and insects (11.4% each) and 

invertebrates (30.4%) in urban places. Nevertheless, birds are the most frequent item 

(number of areas where the item occurred) in world cats diet in islands (100%) and 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 124 

natural areas (94.1%), and human refuse (100%) in urban places, followed by rodents in 

Islands (74.2%) and birds in urban places (90%), substitute by insects in natural areas 

(76.4%). The consumption of rabbits is more frequent in islands (48.4%) and natural 

areas (64.7%), alike human refuse in urban places (100%) and in natural areas (53.3%). 

The studies revealed that cats consumed in average 4.8 ± 1.8 (±SD) resource types (of a 

maximum of seven categories considered) in islands, 4.6 ± 1.7 items in urban places and 

5.1 ± 1.4 in natural areas. A significant relationship was found between the number of 

prey items and rabbits consumption in islands (r2 = 0.406, F1,29=21.54, P&lt;0.001) and 

natural areas (r2 = 0.330, F1,15=8.89, P&lt;0.01). The same was found for human refuse in 

islands (r2 = 0.360, F1,29=17.92, P&lt;0.001), but not in urban places (r
2 = -0.122, 

F1,8=0.02, P=0.89) and natural areas (r
2 = 0.161, F1,15=4.08, P=0.07). Using all the 

studies as a unique dataset, a significant relationship was obtained between the number 

of prey items and the consumption of human refuse (r2 = 0.201, F1,56=15.39, P&lt;0.001) 

and rabbits (r2 = 0.373, F1,56=34.98, P&lt;0.001).  

Figure 5.4, that illustrates the linear discriminant analysis for the three groups of studies, 

shows a greater similarity between domestic cat diet in urban and natural areas, 

relatively to the islands. The prior probability of each group is 59.0% for islands, 29.5% 

for natural areas and 11.4% for urban places. The first linear discriminant function 

explains 71.4% of all variability, with the greatest contributions from the partial 

coefficients of human refuse (0.0481) and birds (-0.0129), while reptiles (-0.0487) and 

rodent (0.0219) consumption contributes most for the second discrimant function that 

explains 28.6% of variability (Table 5.3b).

The hierarchical cluster analysis first separated two groups (A: 52.3%  and B: 47.7% of 

all studies), with greater representation of studies made in natural (25.8%) and urban 

(22.5%) areas in group A (decreasing in group B to 17.6 % and 11.7%, respectively), 

while those relating to islands were mostly included (70.5%) in group B (Figure 5.5). At 

the second hierarchical level, three groups are evident (group A and two new resulting 

from the sub-division of plot B (B1: 53% and B2: 47%, respectively). Studies in islands 

represent 77.7% of the dataset of B1, and natural areas 50% of those in B2. Urban places 

had a smaller and similar representation in both groups (11.1% in B1 and 12.5% in B2). 

The MANOVA show significant main effects between groups A and B (Pillai-Bartlett 

Trace=0.840, F1,59=39.83, P &amp;lt;0.001) with a significant contribution of mammals 

(F1,59=270.09, P &amp;lt;0.001), rabbits (F1,59=8.38, P &amp;lt;0.01) and reptiles (F1,59=6.03, P &amp;lt;

0.05). Significant effects were also found between the three groups formed at the second 

hierarchical level (Pillai-Bartlett Trace=0.871, F1,59=51.03, P &amp;lt;0.001), having as 

associated explanatory variables the mammals (F1,59=199.96, P &amp;lt;0.001), rabbits 

(F1,59=37.29, P &amp;lt;0.001), birds (F1,59=5.15, P &amp;lt;0.05) and reptiles (F1,59=6.38, P &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

 

5.4 DISCUSSION 

The results lead to the exclusion of hypothesis 1, has it appears to be a clear 

differentiation between prey items from latrine groups, according to its distance from 

houses. This is reinforced by the pattern of trophic regime of domestic cat in the world 

where there are similarities between urban and natural areas, as opposed to the islands. 

That is, the diet of the domestic cat expresses its dependence to people, even in natural 

areas, where the diversity and prey availability is higher. So, we can say that the results 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 127 

best fit hypotheses 2 and 3. In fact, feeding data resulting from scats collected away 

from homes are in accordance with the trophic regime described for the wildcat (Lozano 

et al. 2006) and that resulting from scats found near houses are close  to those 

describing domestic cat diet in worldwide studies. Nevertheless, a group of latrines that 

was not located near the human settlements, but included houses in the 1km buffer, did 

not show a relation with any of the two other groups, probably because they didn’t had a 

strong influence of the most significant items, rabbits and human refuse. The 

importance of human refuse for the group of latrines located near the houses, is 

reinforces by the fact that a study in the same area showed an association between 

domestic cat distribution and human presence, and their abundance with the food 

resources provided by humans (Ferreira et al. submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). A 

success strategy to reduce feral cats in natural areas is to limit their access to human 

refuses, once this will have effect on their distribution and density (Ferreira et al. 

submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). 

The results of the fine scale study (study area level) revealed that Felis sp. scats 

collected from latrines sites at different spatial influence of human settlements, revealed 

two important food items, rabbits and human refuse, with the presence of the first 

associated to scats collected in natural areas and the later from latrines near houses. 

Also, differences were found in the specific composition of rodents consumed by cats 

using latrines sites near and far from human settlements. The gender Mus sp., most 

probably the house mouse, was the species with highest occurrence in scats collected at 

latrine sites near houses, while the wood mouse was most found in those located in 

undisturbed natural areas. Biró (2005) analysed the wildcat-feral domestic cat food 

regime in Hungary and found that no human-related prey items occurred in the diet of 

the wildcat but were preyed by feral cats. The results from the worldwide overview on 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 128 

cats diet are in accordance with thouse found by Liberg (1984), Fitzgerald (1988) and 

Biró et al. (2005), in which feral domestic cats are described as generalist and 

opportunist species. Wildcats, on the other hand, are considered selective predators that 

have a facultative feeding strategy, specializing on rabbits when present or on rodents 

when abundant and rabbits lacking, and shifting to alternative prey, such as 

invertebrates or reptiles, when rabbits are absent and rodents not very abundant (Lozano 

et al. 2006).  

Worthwhile mention was the occurrence of two carnivore species in cat scats found far 

from human settlements, probably evidencing intraguild-predation events as already 

reported (e.g. Palomares and Caro 1999). No study on the diet of domestic cats refers 

the predation on midsize carnivores, already verified in wildcat diet studies – domestic 

cat (Tryjanowski et al. 2002, Biró et al. 2005), common genet and stone marten 

(Moleón and Gil-Sánchez 2003). These are predation evidences, although scavenging 

should also be an option similarly to what have might happen relatively to the ungulate 

remains found in 9.71% of scats originating from the same group of latrines. The 

differences between wildcat and feral domestic cat diets are reflected in the analysis of 

prey items found in this study, separating most of the scats from latrines near houses 

from those far from human settlements and located in natural areas, typically associated 

with domestic and wildcats, respectively. In continental landmasses, as the case of 

Europe, where prey species co-evolved with a great diversity of predators, like the 

wildcats, the domestic cats accompanies the man distribution that offers a plenty of food 

resources that they do not have to share with other predators (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 

1986). In the wild, co-existing carnivores have to compete for prey and because of that 

intra-guild predation may occur. The differences in domestic cat and wildcat diet reflect 

their relation with humans, showing the domestic cat less dependent of the prey density. 



CHAPTER 5. Diferent cats, different places, different diets? 
 

 129 

Inversely the wildcat depends on an optimal hunting strategy for they main preys 

(Liberg 1984).  The overview of the world domestic cat diet confirmed mammals as the 

more frequent main prey, represented by rabbits in the islands and natural areas and 

rodents in urban places. Nevertheless, birds are the most frequent (number of areas 

where the item occurred) item in world cats diet in islands and natural areas, substitute 

by human refuse in urban places. Another interesting data is that the number of different 

items consumed by domestic cats increased with the human presence, reinforcing the 

nature of a generalist and opportunistic species. This positive relation, found in islands, 

is consequence of the increase prey diversity due to the presence of exotic species, 

linked to human presence, like house mice and rabbits in many islands (Nogales and 

Medina 1986). However, this result may be biased by the larger representativity of 

studies in islands. Identical results, were obtained in the fine scale analysis (latrine 

groups) where human refuse was significantly related to the number of prey consumed, 

possibly because human settlements promote the presence of opportunistic prey, like 

house mice. Unlike wildcats, domestic cats mainly eat young rabbits and the hunting 

techniques appear not to be adapted to exploiting adult rabbits (Liberg 1984, Catling 

1988). Our worldwide review confirmed that the consumption of rabbits is associated 

with an increase in the diversity of items consumed. The same applies to the wildcat 

diet, with trophic diversity increasing with the inclusion of alternative prey such as 

rabbits (Lozano et al. 2006). The urban and natural areas seem to describe better the 

food regime of domestic cat in continental land mass, with a diet pattern that is 

consequence of the relationships between domestic cat and humans. The food regime of 

domestic cats in islands, on the other hand, must be analysed in the context of meso-

diversity of available resources, that in many islands is lower. The number of carnivore 

species with more than 2kg, which may compete and/or predate domestic cats, and 

potentially occur in the geographic areas of each study, represent in islands an average 

of 0.22 ± 0.4 carnivore species, 1.7 ± 1.0 in urban places and 2.3 ± 1.1 in natural areas. 

This knowledge is relevant in the context of extensive ecological studies. Variation in 

feeding behaviour among domestic cat populations over a broad scale of environmental 

conditions, is quite important to understand the relation between domestic cats and food 

resources in continental natural areas, as well as potential competitive effects with the 

wildcat. Nevertheless, the small sample of studies in continental natural areas, with the 

exception of Australia, limits the analysis on the feeding ecology of the species due to 

the lack of robust results. This information is vital to know more about the mechanisms 

that limit the capacity of expansion and colonization of natural areas by domestic cats. 

In these areas, prey developed anti-predatory strategies and are preyed by several 

carnivore species with which domestic cats have to compete. Furthermore, human 

absence implies that human refuse and comensal prey species, like house mice, are not 

available for domestic cats, thereby limiting their expansion in these areas.  

Implications on wildcat conservation 

This study supports the idea that, in continental natural areas of Iberian Peninsula, the 

domestic cat depends on human refuse and comensal prey, reinforcing the results 

obtained in the study on domestic cats spatial ecology in the study area (Ferreira et al. 

Submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). On the other hand, rabbits formed the main 

component of the diet of wildcats in Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (Gil-Sánchez et 

al. 1999, Lozano et al. 2006) and species distribution depends greatly on rabbit’s 

abundance (Ferreira et al. 2003, Monterroso et al. 2009). Unlike, wildcat, the feral

domestic cats only occasionally consumed lagomorphs (Borkenhagen 1978 and 1979, 

Fitzgerald 1988), eating mostly juveniles and sick individuals, and only on exceptional 

occasions rabbits were the main prey item (Liberg, 1984). Nevertheless, if the food 

resources associated with human presence disappear or became limit, the domestic-feral 

cats may start foraging in wildcat habitats and compete for shared resources (Biró et al. 

2005). Additionally, this will promote direct encounters with wildcat and other 

carnivore species, and increase the risk of hybridization and disease transmission 

(Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Biró et al. 2004, Germain et al. 2008). To decrease domestic cats 

abundance in natural areas of Iberian Peninsula is therefore crucial for wildcat 

conservation.

Abstract 

The domestic cat Felis catus is the natural host of several viruses that infect feline populations 

worldwide and, sometimes, other wild carnivores. The most important viruses carried by 

domestic and wild cats, and that of concern in this study, are feline calicivirus (FCV), feline 

herpes virus (FHV), feline panleukopenia (FPV), feline coronovirus (FCoV), feline leukaemia 

virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). To obtain a global overview of feline-

important virus prevalence in domestic (Felis catus) and wild cats (Irimote cat Felis 

iriomotensis, sand cat Felis margarita, and European wildcat Felis silvestris) we analyzed the 

data of twenty five studies published in five continents (Europe - n=11, Asia - n=6, Australia – 

n=1, and America - n=7), referring to a total of 36 areas. Hypotheses tested are: 1) Species 

density and social structure affects prevalence: high species densities promote high prevalence 

for the milder diseases, and prevalence rates increases in social groups; 2) Virus occurrence is 

related with other virus prevalence. To understand the influence of environment (island, natural, 

rural and urban), cat species and global viral prevalence in the occurrence of the six focal virus 

under analysis we use generalised linear models and the presence/absence of each virus type per 

cat sample. The environment and species were present in the FIV, FCoV and FPV best models, 

while other virus prevalence was significant for FeLV, FCV and FHV. The best model for FIV 

corroborates the hypothesis 1), with a “positive” contribution of urban and “negative” of natural 

areas, as the more important descriptors for virus occurrence. Further, FIV prevalence appears 

correlated with species sociability, being higher in rural and urban areas. The hypothesis 2), that 

the occurrence of a certain type virus is relate with other virus prevalence, was confirmed in the 

models for all six viruses, with special relevance for FeLV contributions. The most virulent 

virus (FIV and FeLV) need host direct contacts for propagation and once established, their 

prevalence affects other virus occurrence. And for some virus, like FeLV, the distribution of 

cats nucleus in natural areas is a determinant factor for virus propagation. In natural areas the

6.1 INTRODUCTION 

The domestic cat Felis catus is the natural host of several viruses that infect feline 

populations worldwide and sometimes even other wild carnivores (Driciru et al. 2006, 

Millán et al. 2009b). The most important viruses carried by cats are feline calicivirus 

(FCV), feline herpes virus (FHV), feline panleukopenia (FPV), feline coronovirus 

(FCoV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) 

(Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegger et al. 1999, Fromont et al. 2000, Millán et al. 2009a). 

The high variability in virus prevalence is influence to cat social organization and 

mating system, which can be explained by the mode of transmission of these viruses 

(Courchamp et al. 1998, Fromont et al. 2003). The most common ways of FeLV 

transmission are bites, nasal secretions, mutual grooming, shared food and water. The 

adult cats are more resistant to FeLV than kittens, which are infected by the positive 

females during gestation or shed virus in milk (Green 1990, Arjona et al. 2000). FeLV 

related immunosuppression causes increased susceptibility to bacteria and other viral 

infections, and his persistence in the environment does not exceed a few hours (Green 

1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Quimm et al. 2002). Like FeLV, FIV has a worldwide 

distribution and is related to cat density. The primary mode of FIV transmission, that is 

also not viable in environment, is through bite wounds, and casual non aggressive 



CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations 
 

 144 

contact among cats rarely results in the spread of the virus. In fact, the infection is 

characterized by risk factors linked to aggressive behaviour: old mature male adults 

having dispersed are more likely to be infected (Fouchet et al. 2009). The maternal 

transmission occurs primarily when the female is exposed to FIV and becomes infected 

during gestation or lactation. Spread of FIV through sexual contact is an uncommon 

event. The prevalence of FIV affects, in general, between one and three percent of the 

population (Green 1990). Another virus that needs contact between individuals to 

spread is FHV since cannot exist outside of the host; the way of transmission is through 

respiratory and oral secretions (Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Packer et al. 1999, 

Quimm et al. 2002). Mortality rates are higher in kittens or if individuals are 

immunocompromised for another reason (e.g. cats with FeLV or FIV, stress, illness) 

(Packer et al. 1999). Neonatal kittens are exposed to FHV during birth if their mother is 

infected with the virus (Quimm et al. 2002). Other group of viruses (FPV, FCV, FCoV) 

does not need contact between individuals and mode of transmission, besides oral, nasal 

and ocular secretions, can be through faeces for FCV and FCoV, and also urine for FPV 

(Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Packer et al. 1999, Quimm et al. 2002). In addition, 

fleas may transmit FPV from infected to susceptible cats during the acute stage of the 

disease (Green 1990). Nevertheless, they present different environmental persistence: 

FCV can survive for as long as one week, FCoV from hours to weeks and FPV until a 

year (Green 1990, Packer et al. 1999). FCV is very common in kittens and multicat 

households and affects all cat breeds. FCoV is a very contagious virus and usually infect 

cats under 3 years of age, however almost never crosses the placenta to the unborn 

kitten (Green 1990). Most kittens usually become infected between 5-7 weeks of age, 

when the protective antibodies that they receive from their mother's milk are no longer 

active (Green 1990). FPV infection can be a fatal primary disease, affecting cats of all 



CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations 
 

 145 

ages, and it is primarily a disease of kittens (Green 1990, Murphy et al. 1999, Steinel et 

al. 2001). The characteristics of the disease may vary considerably from population to 

population and from outbreak to outbreak. In susceptible populations, the disease may 

affect nearly 100 percent of individuals, resulting in a mortality rate that may vary 

between 25 to 75 percent (Packer et al. 1999). 

Cats are found in a wide variety of ecological conditions and have developed highly 

variable population structures, ranging from solitary living individuals in low-dense 

populations to social groups in high-density populations (Liberg and Sandell 1988). 

Infectious agents play a relevant role in ecosystems, and are an important element in the 

dynamics of host populations (Altizer et al. 2003). Nevertheless, host-pathogen 

relationship has being disturbed mainly by environmental changes caused by human 

activity (Daszak 2000, Deem et al. 2001). This is frequently associated with the 

pathogen introduction into wild populations by man, or with a change in the host’s 

susceptibility to infections (Grenfell and Dobson 1995). Incidence itself depends on the 

relation between population size, density, and rate of contact for efficient disease 

transmission. Characteristics like density and spatial structure of domestic cats 

populations depend on the abundance and distribution of resources linked to human 

presence (Kerby and McDonald 1988). In fact, there are notable differences in the 

organization of cat populations in terms of dispersal pattern, mating system and 

individual behaviour, according to resources distribution. At very low density (less than 

10 cats km-2) as in low humanized natural-rural areas, individual home ranges are larger 

and intra-specific encounters among adult cats are uncommon (Kerby and Mcdonald 

1988). However, these environments favour the contact between domestic cat and other 

carnivore species and two types of interactions may occur: intraguild predation, 

particular in encounters with red foxes Vulpes vulpes, Iberian lynxes Lynx pardinus or 



CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations 
 

 146 

other large carnivores, or agonistic behaviours and hybridization with wildcats (e.g. 

Europena wildcat Felis silvestris).  

The occurrence and prevalence of viral pathogens varies because of several factors like, 

habitat structure, human presence, domestic cat and carnivore species population size 

and distribution. For example in Scotland, were the contacts between the domestic cats 

and the wildcats were frequent, the later were commonly infected with the major viruses 

of the domestic cats, except for FIV (Daniels et al. 1999). Low prevalence of diseases 

was found in Slovenian wildcats, suggesting a low level of contact between both 

populations (Ra?nik et al. 2008), but domestic cat populations change their density, 

sociability and size of family groups in function of availability of resources (Liberg and 

Sandell 1988).  

Our interest focused on six (FeLV, FIV, FHV, FCV, FPV and FCoV) most common 

virus affecting domestic cat and wildcat populations (Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegger 

et al. 1999, Fromont et al. 2000, Millan et al. 2009a) in order to test the a priori 

hypotheses:    

1. Species density and structure affects prevalence;  

i. High species densities promote high prevalence for the milder diseases;    

ii. The prevalence rates increase in social groups. 

2. The occurrence of a virus is related with other virus prevalence

CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations

The studies that used clinical data from house cats were not selected in our analysis 

because they were not representative of urban-feral populations. Fourteen studies (56%) 

refered to natural areas, seven (23%) to urban, two (8%) to rural areas, and two (8%) to 

islands The studies were performed in areas that exemplify different cats densities, 

ranging from natural habitats, with lower densities, to urban areas characterized by 

high-density populations (Liberg and Sandell 1988). To understand the influence of 

environment, cat species and other virus prevalence in the six focal virus occurrence, we 

used generalised linear models with a binomial error distribution and a logit link 

function in R software. Presence/absence of each virus per cat sample was related with 

cat species, environment (island, natural, rural and urban) and the other virus prevalence 

in the sampled population, using direct logistic regression analyses in which all 

predictors entered the equations simultaneously (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996). Before 

fitting these models, we calculated a correlation matrix among all the predictor variables 

using Spearman rank coefficients (Sokal and Rohlf 1995); candidate models containing 

highly correlated predictors (R &gt;0.7) were modified or eliminated from the dataset. 

Candidate models were compared according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 

that provides an objective tool to rank these models and thus quantify the evidence for 

each hypothesis (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Knowing that species sociability 

increases contacts between individuals, we correlate the social behaviour of species 

(domestic cat, Irimote cat, sand cat and wildcat) with virus occurrence and prevalence. 

Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, domestic cats do not have a social survival 

strategy (Bradshaw et al. 1996). Nevertheless, we used the term sociability in the 

perspective of the existence of groups of individuals that cohabite, and regularly share 

resources. Therefore, we consider domestic cat as a social species and the other as no 

social species.

6.3 RESULTS 

The worldwide average prevalence rates in cat populations in natural areas was 21.9% 

for FIV, 29.9% for FeLV, 39.7% for FCV, 7.7% for FHV, 2.3% for FCoV and 17.5% 

for FPV. From the twenty five worldwide studies addressed to analysed virus 

prevalences in urban, rural, natural areas and islands, FCV and FeLV presents the 

mayor number of positives, mostly from natural areas. In contrast, FIV with lower 

confirmations for FIV (Table 6.2).  

 

Table 6.2.  Number of addressed worldwide studies, of the total dataset (n=25), performed in 

Urban (U), Rural (R), Natural (N) and Islands (I), that analysed prevalence of six virus types: 

Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), Feline Leukaemia (FeLV), Feline Herpesvirus (FHV), 

Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV), Feline Calicivirus (FCV) and Feline Corona Virus (FeCoV). 

 

 

 

 

The FCV, FeLV and FIV seem to have higher prevalence rates then the other virus, 

inversely to FCoV that showed the lowest value. However, this analysis may be biased 

by the size of the samples (Table 6.3). In the worldwide studies of cat populations FCV 

presents the higher values of virus prevalence in domestic cats from natural areas and 

second more high, after FeLV, in wildcats.

(Figure 6.1). Modeling results (Table 6.4) for the occurrence of each virus revealed that 

FeLV prevalence was present in all best models for the other five viruses, being the

The environment and species was also retained in best models for FIV, FCoV and FPV, 

but the first was only significant for FIV while species was for FPV. Other virus 

prevalence are the unique variables in the best models for FeLV, FCV and FHV, with 

FeLV and FIV viruses representing the only descriptors in models selected for FCV and 

FHV. In the FeLV best model, the contributions of FHV and FPV were highly 

significant, pvalue &amp;lt;0.001 and pvalue = 0.007 respectively, with a negative influence of FHV 

prevalence for FeLV occurrence. Natural environments, negatively influenced FIV 

occurrence, while in urban areas show a positive contribution. The occurrences of FCV, 

FHV and FCoV were significantly associated with FeLV prevalence. Also, for the FPV 

presence is still influent, together with the host species and the environment where the 

host population is located (Table 6.5). A significant positive correlation was found 

between species sociability and FIV (Spearman’s rank correlation test: rs = 0.703, P &amp;lt;

0.0001, n = 40) and FHV (rs = 0.556, P &amp;lt;0.03, n=15) prevalences, and negative with 

FeLV (rs = -0.508, P &amp;lt;0.0023, n=34.  

 

 

6.4 DISCUSSION  

In our hypothesis, high species densities promote high prevalence for milder diseases, 

which increases with the existence of social groups. Our results support this hypothesis 

once, the best model for FIV includes the “positive” contribution of urban and the 

“negative” of natural areas, as the more important descriptors for the virus occurrence. 

Moreover, the FIV prevalence appears correlated with species sociability, reflecting the 

worldwide data where the virus prevalence is higher in rural and urban areas (see Figure 



CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations 
 

 154 

1). Courchamp et al. (1998) refers that FIV is practically solely transmitted by bitting 

and therefore social behaviour of species can favour virus transmission in rural areas 

where cats show a well-marked polygynous mating system. However if cats nucleus are 

small and spaced, encounters between individuals may be a very rare event, especially if 

the habitat environmental is not favourable (less humanized) for domestic cat 

movements. Our second hypothesis, that virus occurrence is influenced by the 

prevalence of other virus, seems to be confirmed in the models for all six viruses, with 

special relevance for FeLV. The, negative correlation found between FeLV and species 

sociability, could be the expression of virus impact in populations with polygynous 

mating systems, once the fertility of viremic females is strongly reduced, resulting in 

high rates of abortion, and the few live kittens are viremic at birth and die early (Hoover 

et al. 1983). In natural or rural populations, when farms are connected to villages or 

when several surrounding populations lead to high numbers of feral cats roaming 

between populations, FeLV could be continuously present in the area (Fromont et al. 

2003). Therefore, the impact of FeLV in domestic cats population growth increases and 

disease may act on distant populations through dispersal (Frommont et al. 2003), like 

wildcat populations in natural areas. In a detailed study that assessed FeLV risk, 

Fromont et al. (1998) hypothesized, that small population size may be responsible for 

too few contacts among cats to maintain persistent infection. The negative contribution 

of FHV prevalence  to FeLV occurrence reinforces the idea of virus interactions. 

Therefore, we expect an increase of virus prevalence in high-density populations where 

the contacts between individuals are more frequent, specially in species with well-

marked social behaviours.  

Moreover, each viral agent has its mode of propagation, which is dependent on 

individual interactions in the host populations. In wildcat populations, the virus 



CHAPTER 6. Virus Prevalence in Cat Populations 
 

 155 

prevalence depends largely on stress conditions of their populations, if we exclude 

contact with domestic cats. These in turn, exhibit different population structures 

according to the type of occurrence areas: urban, rural and natural areas. Accordingly, it 

is expected that viruses respond to this change in host population structure. The 

domestic cat serves as a vehicle for dispersion of viral agents between their colonies and 

the wildcat populations. Therefore, free-ranging cats hosting viral agents in natural 

areas have more opportunity to interact with other carnivores and therefore increase the 

risk of diseases transmission (Millán et al. 2009).  

Implications on wildcat conservation 

The occurrence and prevalence of viral agents are very dependent on the spatial and 

social structure of the host population (Fromont et al. 2003) and for some virus, like 

FeLV, the distribution of cats nucleus in natural areas is a determinant factor for virus 

propagation. In natural areas cats distribution and densities are associated to human 

presence, and resources availability provided, directly or indirectly, by man (Ferreira et 

al. submitted - Paper II of this Thesis). In addition, the human activities like agro-

forestry, agriculture activities and road densities favours domestic cat expansion, 

increasing the intra-specific and inter-specific contacts, and for the fragmentation of 

wildcat populations. This is quite relevant because the fragmentation of species 

populations, associate with human persecution, conduct to the existence of stress 

factors, that affects the virus prevalence (Pontier et al. 2009).

7. General discussion 

7.1  INTRODUCTION 

The idea behind the thesis relates to the factors that, by force of human presence and 

activities, may affect wildcat populations in Iberian Peninsula. In general, the factors 

that critically affect the survival of carnivores are the scarcity of food resources, 

habitat destruction and degradation, human persecution and infectious diseases. In the 

case of the wildcat we can add a fourth element which is the introgression with 

domestic cat (Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Oliveira et al. 2008), that may endanger the genetic 

integrity of their populations. Hybridization, transmission of viral diseases and 

competition due to trophic niche overlap, have all been associated with the domestic 

cat (Courchamps et al. 1995, Fromont et al. 2003, Pontier et al. 2009), which is in turn 

heavily dependent of human populations. In this perspective, humans are a key-issue 

in wildcat conservation strategies, justifying the investment in the knowledge on the 

interactions between wildcats, domestic cats and, consequently, humans. My research 

shed light on wildcat ecological requirements and constrains imposed by human-

related activities. Moreover, with this approach it is possible to learn important lessons 

about the mutual interactions among wildcats and domestic-free ranging-feral cats, and 

the effects of human land uses, that can be generalised to other similar situations.

7.2 OVERVIEW OF MAIN FINDINGS 
 

 
 

7.2.1Large scale requirements of wildcat distribution in Iberian 

Peninsula  

To evaluate the more important requirements in the wildcat Iberian distribution we 

used the advantages of correlative and mechanistic models to detect which are the 

large-scale determinants that express the local individual preferences (Paper I). 

Wildcat natural history and behaviour, obtained from ecological research at fine scales, 

suggest the importance of small mammals as prey, as well as a negative influence of 

human disturbance (Paper I). Apparently, habitat, coded as type of vegetation cover, is 

not influencing the distribution of the wildcat, thus reinforcing Lozano et al. (2003) 

opinion that the species is more habitat generalist than at first suspected, and is not 

behaving as a strictly forestall species (Stahl and Artois 1994). Moreover, at a large 

scale the wildcat does not show different requirements along its distribution range, 

with human disturbance and the number of species of small mammals as main 

descriptors for the wildcat distribution between temperate forest and Mediterranean 

vegetation (paper I). The relationship between prey availability and vegetation 

structure, namely the importance of pastures – scrubland mosaics for the wild rabbit in 

Mediterranean areas of Iberian Peninsula (Lozano et al. 2003), is a good example to 

show how the wildcat presence is indirectly related to vegetation type, because of the 

link between main prey and vegetation. In Mediterranean areas, dominated by 

sclerophylous vegetation, wildcats use rabbits as main prey (Malo et al. 2004, Ferreira 

2003, Monterroso et al. 2009), while in Atlantic regions, mainly covered by mixed and 

broad-leaved forests, small mammals are the staple food (Lozano et al. 2006). In spite 



 

 165 

of the importance of small mammals for the wildcat in Atlantic areas, we found that 

this group of prey represent the most relevant predictor for species occurrence also in 

Mediterranean areas, opposed to the idea of specialization on rabbits. Probably, 

wildcats just take advantage of local wild rabbit’s abundance, and its importance as a 

complementary food source is reinforced by the lower number of species of small 

mammals in Mediterranean areas. Represented by the relation of human occupation 

with elevation range, human disturbance is another important variable explaining the 

pattern of wildcat occurrence (Paper I). The negative relation between wildcat 

occurrence and human presence suggests a strong impact of human activities most 

probably through habitat destruction, direct killing and increasing contacts with 

domestic cats. Nevertheless, the impact of human presence is hard to quantify, given 

the multiple factors that act on the species, especially direct killing, which is not 

reported due to its illegality. This is particularly relevant in natural-rural areas where 

the number and distribution of human settlements and households can differ in terms 

of human density, representing different disturbance scenarios for wildcat populations 

(Papers I and II).  

7.2.2  Humans and domestic cats relationships in rural-natural areas 

High human density supports higher cat densities, linking the expansion of cats in 

nature to different levels of human occupation. The pattern of farm occupation by 

people is the main factor determining the distribution and abundance of domestic cats 

in natural or semi-natural areas (Paper II). Space use by domestic cats in our study area 

showed that females centred their home ranges on farms and males made long travels 

to find available females in the mating season (Paper II, see also Barratt 1997, 

Germain et. al. 2008). In fact, the distribution and density of females are the primary 



 

 166 

factors determining male range size (Liberg and Sandell 1988), and the maximum 

distances travelled in a season are associated to the distance to the nearest farm with 

females (Paper II). On the other hand, the daily movements of domestic cats was only 

constrained by red fox density that may translate into a high risk of predation (Paper 

II). Predation of cat offspring was observed during this study in Noudar Castle where 

the pups of the tracked female F310 were killed by an Egyptian mongoose (pers. 

obsv.). In fact, feral or free ranging cats are more likely to be rare or absent in regions 

with well-preserved wild predator populations (Macdonald and Thom 2001). Domestic 

cats may move between farms but they have to share space with other carnivores, 

increasing the probability of interaction. Then it is more advantageous for farm cats to 

stay near secure shelters (farms) and avoid these interactions, especially with species 

that are more competitive or with predators. Dependence on people is also visible in 

the diet of the domestic cat, even in the vicinity of natural areas, where the diversity of 

potential prey is higher (Paper III). Domestic cats temporarily linked to humans may 

consume alternative prey (Fitzgerald 1988) around human settlements during the 

periods of natural food shortage, but they depend on human presence for their 

populations to increase. In continental landmasses, as the case of Europe, where prey 

species co-evolved with a great diversity of predators, like wildcats, the domestic cat 

benefits from staying in the proximity of people because they offer plenty food 

resources that they do not have to share with other predators. The differences found in 

the diets of domestic and wildcats illustrates well this relation between wild prey, 

predators, and man. 

 

 



 

 167 

7.2.3 Spatial structure of domestic cat populations in natural-rural areas 

and relation with virus prevalence  

The spatial occupation of farmhouses and human changes in the landscape are 

responsible for the distribution and displacements of domestic cats in natural-rural 

areas, and this potentially leads to the spreading of diseases to wildlifes (especially 

FIV and FelV) and hybridization with the wildcat (Courchamp et al. 1995, Fromont et 

al. 1997, Daniels et al. 1999, Leutenegge et al. 1999). The occurrence and prevalence 

of viral agents are very dependent on the spatial and social structure of the host 

population (Fromont et al. 2003) and the existence of stress factors (Pontier et al. 

2009). Moreover, each viral agent has its mode of propagation, which is dependent on 

interactions between individuals. In wildcat populations, if we exclude contact with 

domestic cats, disease prevalence depends largely on stress conditions of the 

population.. Domestic cats in turn, exhibit different population structures according to 

the type of environment where they occur, being this either urban, rural or natural 

areas (Paper IV). Accordingly, it is expected that viruses go hand in hand with changes 

in the population structure of the host. The domestic cat serves as a vehicle for 

dispersion of viral agents between their colonies and the wildcat populations. 

Therefore, free-ranging cats in natural areas are likely to transmit diseases due to the 

opportunities to interact with other carnivores (Millán et al. 2009). The structure that 

characterizes polygamous colonies of cats in natural and rural areas is the one that 

most closely approximates that of the wildcat populations. Therefore, the impact of 

virus on domestic cats populations increases, including the transmission of the disease 

to distant populations through dispersal (Frommont et al. 2003), including wildcat 

populations in natural areas. Apparently, FeLV occurrence have large influence on the 

prevalence of other viruses (Paper IV) and is probably the most dangerous virus for 



 

 168 

wild feline populations in Europe. In natural areas with rural-farms connected to 

villages, either by the proximity or by their density, the number of cats roaming 

between the various colonies increases, contributing to a continued persistence of 

FeLV in the area. When the villages are far from rural-farms, the contacts between 

domestic cats, which determine FeLV persistence, will depend on their dispersal 

hability and the distance between active farms (Fromon et al. 2003) (Paper II). High 

dispersal rates will promote the contacts between domestic cats-domestic cats and 

domestic cats-wildcats, and as a result the probability of transmission and prevalence 

of FeLV and other viruses will increase (Paper IV).  

 

7.3 IMPLICATIONS FOR WILDCAT CONSERVATION 

7.3.1Habitat management and prey restocking / recovery 

For a long time the conservation of wildcat focused on two main threat factors: loss of 

forested habitats and hybridisation with the domestic cat. In large part, this was due to 

the fact that most of the knowledge on the species originated from outside the Iberian 

Peninsula (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Only more recently, it was shown that the 

association between wildcat and Mediterranean vegetation, was not merely a 

consequence of its direct role as shelter, but resulted also from the indirect effect of 

providing an abundant food resource – the wild rabbit (Moreno and Villafuert 1995, 

Lozano et al. 2003, Fernández et al. 2006). Over decades, in rural areas people 

conducted small shrub removals for cattle grazing or to facilitate access to new 

exploitation areas, shaping a highly diverse landscape. These landscape mosaics 

promote prey diversity and availability, especially in terms of rabbits and rodents, the 



 

 169 

staple food of wildcats worldwide (Lozano et al. 2003, Fernández et al. 2003, 

Fernández 2005, Klar et al. 2008). The traditional farming system was highly diverse, 

combining the production of several types of grazing species (sheep, goats, Iberian 

pigs and cattle). However, changes in the agricultural policies that started in the 60’s, 

have led to a larger investment in cattle production with the consequent decrease in the 

numbers of small ruminants (Joffre et al. 1988). A good example of this changing 

process can be seen in vast areas of the ‘montado’system (or ‘dehesa’ in Spain), the 

landscape matrix of most southern Iberia, where the intensification of cattle production 

leaded to extensive clear-cutting of understorey, and consequent decrease in prey 

availability. This in turn decreased the abundance of prey and increased disturbance, 

due to intense cattle grazing. The opposite situation occurs when large amounts of 

private areas are devoted to big game hunting and shrubs are allowed to growth to 

provide better shelter opportunities to game species. In immediate terms, this 

management option may also have a positive effect in the wildcat in face of its high 

cover requirements (Stahl and Artois 1994). However, the absence of a mosaic 

structure in the landscape and the usually  high densities of big game species, also 

decreases prey abundance, especially rabbits (Lozano et al. 2007), a already declining 

species due to other threats. In the last decades wild rabbit  populations suffered a high 

decline (Malo et al. 2004), mainly as consequence of mixomatosis and hemorrahagic 

diseases (RHD), with direct consequences on the reproductive success of predators 

(Rodriguez and Delibes 1992). The recovery of rabbit populations is a hard task in 

conservation and species restocking is frequently carried out for hunting purposes, 

with thousands of individuals being introduced every year, often ending in failure 

(Calvete et al. 1997). Small mammals, the other key prey for wildcats, in many 

communities show preference for habitats with high vegetation cover (Kotler and 



 

 170 

Brown 1988), a fact that is closely related with the perceived predation risk (Díaz 

1992), and consequently are also affected by changes in the traditional farming system. 

However, a proper understanding on how human-induced changes in habitats and 

landscapes affect small mammal populations is still lacking, albeit being crucial to 

undertake the management and conservation of Mediterranean ecosystems. As shown, 

although needing cover the wildcat is not a specialist in a particular vegetation type 

(Paper I), but the composition, quantity and shape of vegetation cover, is important in 

determining prey availability. Human activities, namely agro-pastoral-forestry and 

hunting practices, have therefore a large influence in the habitat suitability for the 

species. In table 7.1, I summarise the main features that relate land management 

options with prey availability and disturbance for wildcats.  

Table 7.1. Different scenarios of land management options and their implications for wildcat 

conservation in Mediterranean areas 

 



 

 171 

The immediate conservation needs for the wildcat in the Mediterranean region must 

therefore concentrate in promoting prey availability; which in turn is dependent of 

maintaining natural vegetation patches and low levels of agricultural intensification. 

To re-established sustainable land uses that incorporate the conservation of natural 

values it is necessary the maintenance of an equilibrium occupancy between the 

scrubland and agriculture patches. The multi-uses of landscape, instead of a large 

matrix with a unique use, will promote the diversity and abundance of prey. Important 

habitats that in many situations, usually forme small parts of the landscape and are 

often the focus of intensive human activity, are the riparian habitats. In fact, besides 

presenting numerous challenges for land managers, these habitat offer, in 

homogeneous landscapes, the ultimate conditions for species occurrence, increasing 

prey availability in the matrix.  

7.3.2 Limiting domestic cats density and movements in rural farms 

The most effective strategy for decreasing rates of hybridization involves, not only, 

habitat restoration that allows a healthy community of native carnivores to persist, but 

also eliminating or reducing the factors (farm resources) that promote domestic cats 

increase in numbers. Farm occupation by people is the main factor determining 

domestic cat distribution and abundance in natural Mediterranean areas (Paper II). 

Other anthropogenic structures, like roads and households, also favour domestic cat 

expansion to natural areas. Furthermore, because private landowners are the ultimate 

controllers of their land, they may be carrying out a wide variety of actions that could 

influence the distribution and abundance of cats. This information is therefore vital to 

better understand the mechanisms that limit the capacity of expansion and colonization 

of new areas by the domestic cats. In natural areas with no people, cats are strictly 



 

 172 

dependent of wild prey, while in urban habitats human refuse and opportunistic prey 

species like the house mice constitute the bulk of the cats diet (Paper III). A success 

strategy to reduce feral cats in rural-natural areas is therefore to limit the access by cats 

to human refuse. Moreover, in natural or rural areas the pattern of house farms 

distribution affects the distribution and numbers of domestic cats. In fact, until the 

early twenties human density in rural areas of the Mediterranean was much higher than 

today, with rural farms fully active, and typically including farm cats to control 

rodents. Cat densities in these areas were probably much higher at that time. 

The distribution and abundance of domestic cat females are determined in first place 

by the resources provide by people (Devillard et al. 2003). However, for males, the 

main factor is the distribution of females (Liberg and Sandell 1988). With increased 

distances between operative farms, where cats still concentrate, males have to travel 

longer distances and spend more energy in mate guarding. Table 7.2, presents different 

scenarios depending on active farms location and landscape features, with different 

implications on domestic cat distribution and population dynamics, leading to different 

levels of threats to wildcat populations. In general, the spatial distribution of active 

farms, the quantity and quality of available resources and the characteristics of the 

landscape determines the impact on wildcat populations.

 174 

To reduce free-ranging cat populations it is essential not to provide direct food for cats, 

prevent access to the barns, which provides them safe shelter, and an additional prey 

source-house mouse. The rodents inside the barn can be controlled by barn owls Tyto 

alba, simply by the existence of windows located in places inaccessible to cats. At the 

same time, it is important that natural habitats be protected because this limits the cats 

displacements, and increase the probability of predation on them.   

7.3.3 Information gaps and research needs 

A disagreement seems to exist in what concerns the conservation status of the wildcat in 

different areas of its southern European range, in spite of the fact that identified threat 

factors operate at large scale. In Europe, the IUCN classifies the species as Least 

Concern (IUCN 2006) while in Portugal the wildcat is considered Vulnerable (Cabral et 

al. 2005) and in Spain Near Threatened (Palomo 2007). Nevertheless, there is no data 

on the distribution of the species based on systematic surveys despite of the 

recommendations of the Council of Europe to Portugal and Spain (Council of Europe 

1992). The Red Data Book of Vertebrates of Portugal refers to non-natural mortality 

(as consequence of road kills and illegal hunting), hybridization with domestic cat and 

habitat destruction as the main threats (Cabral et al. 2005). However, in the absence of 

robust data on small mammals and rabbit distribution and abundance it is impossible to 

develop a predictive model for wildcat distribution in Portugal which, in view of the 

apparent rareness (particularly in the south), elusive character, and similarity of signs of 

presence with the domestic counterpart, is a crucial tool to further develop a pro-active 

conservation strategy. Another important information gap is the role of human 

disturbance, still poorly known due to its high complexity, mainly in relation with data 

on wildcat direct persecution. Future, fine scale studies should focus on the aspects 



 

 175 

related to human disturbance and direct killing, mostly associated with small game 

hunting practices (predator control practices). These aspects must be reflected in a large 

scale predictor that, in addition with those relate to wildcat requirements (food and 

shelter), contribute to built an predictive model to map potential distribution of wildcat 

in Iberia Peninsula.
