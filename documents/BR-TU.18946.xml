Abstract 

Advances on forest-based composites, shows a growing trend in the use of lignocellulosic materials as 

filler and/or reinforcement in plastic composites.  Cork-Polymer Composites (CPC) is one of the most 

promising fields in cork technology to produce new materials based on sustainable development. Cork 

combined with polymer matrices, has the prospective of lead to composite materials with better 

properties. In this context, new fields of application where cork cannot compete alone might be 

reached.  

The present thesis focuses on the investigation of engineering properties of the thermoplastic matrices, 

such as High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Polypropylene (PP), combined with cork trough melt 

based technologies, by taking advantage of their intrinsic properties to create cork-based composites. 

Towards to reach more bio-based composite materials, cork was combined with biodegradable aliphatic 

polyesters mainly, PolyhydroxyButyrate-co-HydroxyValerate (PHBV); Poly(L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA); Poly-?-

CaproLactone (PCL) and Starch-Poly-?-CaproLactone (SPCL).  

Cork and its by-products obtained from finishing industrial operations and end-of-life products were 

compounded, promoting added-value to cork based composites. The process methods used to create 

CPC were either pultrusion or twin-screw extrusion processes. Whereas, compression moulding and 

injection moulding were used to obtain the final composite product. During this process, the 

compatibility and adhesion between the polar cork and the non-polar polymer is one of the key 

challenges. Reinforcement strategies show that the lignocellulosic–matrix compatibility was improved by 

(i) via the structure of matrix, by employing coupling agents (CA) based on maleic anhydride, (ii) the use 

of natural fibre, or by modifying the fibre surface (i.e. hybrid composites). Indeed, all of them lead to 

cork based composites with considerably better mechanical properties. In addition, the interfacial 

adhesion of cork-polymer was also improved either using suberin or lignin isolated from cork by-

products as bio-based coupling agents with significant benefits for the environment.  

The findings presented in this thesis show that the general properties of CPC materials reveals the 

required: (i) dimension stability with reduced water absorption, (ii) homogeneous distribution and 

dispersion of the cork particles in the polymer matrix, (iii) improved fire resistance to the matix, good 

thermal and acoustic insulation properties and (iv) an interesting range of mechanical properties. As for 

as bio-based composite materials, it was engineering a class of cork biocomposites more sustainable 

with acceptable in-service performance and tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation.

Lignocellulosic materials such as natural fibres and cork also offer economic and environmental 

advantages over traditional inorganic reinforcements and fillers. The work described in this thesis brings 

new knowledge and contribute to a deeper understanding in the promising cork-polymer composites 

(CPC) materials field. Overall, the findings presented in this thesis make a significant contribution to 

better understand the CPC materials. Therefore, the combination of cork with polymeric matrices 

reveals to be a significant added-value to cork based materials, with high potential for a wide range of 

innovative applications.

Resumo 

Avanços em compósitos de base florestal, mostram uma tendência de crescimento no uso de materiais 

lenhoccelulósicos como carga e/ou reforço em compósitos de plástico. O campo dos materiais 

compósitos cortiça-polímero (CPC) é dos mais promissores da tecnologia cortiça para produzir novos 

materiais com base no desenvolvimento sustentável. A cortiça combinada com matrizes poliméricas, 

apresenta o potencial de obter materiais compósitos com melhores propriedades. Neste contexto, 

novos campos de aplicação onde a cortiça não pode competir por si só podem ser alcançados. 

A presente tese centra-se na investigação das propriedades de engenharia das matrizes termoplásticas, 

como o polietileno de alta densidade (HDPE) e o polipropileno (PP), combinadas com a cortiça através 

de tecnologias baseadas na fusão, tirando proveito de suas propriedades intrínsecas, para criar 

compósitos à base de cortiça. No sentido de obter materiais compósitos de origem natural, a cortiça foi 

combinada com poliésteres alifáticos biodegradáveis principalmente, polihidroxibutirato-co-

hidroxivalerato (PHBV), Poli(L-ácido láctico) (PLLA), poli-?-caprolactona (PCL) e Amido poli-?-

caprolactona (SPCL). 

A cortiça e os seus sub-produtos obtidos a partir de operações de acabamento industriais e produtos 

em fim de vida foram misturados, com o intuito de potenciar valor acrescentado aos diferentes 

compósitos com cortiça. Os métodos de processamento usados para criar CPC são processos de 

extrusão de duplo-fuso ou pultrusão. Tendo em consideração que a moldação por compressão e 

moldação por injecção foram usadas para obter o produto compósito final. Durante este processo, o 

grau de compatibilidade e de adesão entre a cortiça polar e o polímero não-polar é um dos principais 

desafios. Estratégias de reforço mostram que o grau de compatibilidade lenhocelulósico-matriz foi 

melhorado (i) através da estrutura de matriz, pelo emprego de agentes compatibilizandores (CA) com 

base no anidrido maleico, (ii) pela utilização de fibras naturais, ou modificando a superfície da fibra 

(isto é, compósitos híbridos). Na verdade, todos eles levam a compósitos de cortiça com 

consideravelmente melhores propriedades mecânicas. Além disso, a adesão interfacial da cortiça-

polímero também foi melhorada quer utilizando suberina ou lenhina isolada a partir de sub-produtos da 

cortiça como agentes compatibilizantes de base florestal, com vantagens significativas para o ambiente. 

Os resultados apresentados nesta tese mostram que as propriedades gerais dos materiais CPC 

revelam a necessária: (i) a estabilidade dimensional com reduzida absorção de água, (ii) distribuição 

homogénea e dispersão das partículas de cortiça na matriz polimérica, (iii) melhorada resistência ao

fogo da matriz, boas propriedades de isolamento térmico e acústico e (iv) e um conjunto interessante 

de propriedades mecânicas. Quanto aos materiais compósitos com bio-poliesters, foi desenvolvida uma 

classe de engenharia de biocompósitos de cortiça mais sustentáveis, com desempenho aceitável em 

serviço e tendência de rápida biodegradação fora-de-serviço. 

Materiais lenhocelulósicos, como as fibras naturais e a cortiça também oferecem vantagens 

económicas e ambientais sobre os materiais de reforço ou de cargas inorgânicas tradicionais. O 

trabalho descrito nesta tese traz novos conhecimentos e contribui para uma compreensão mais 

profunda no campo dos promissores materiais compósitos de cortiça -polímero (CPC). No geral, os 

resultados apresentados nesta tese contribuiem significativamente para uma melhor compreenção dos 

materiais CPC. Portanto, a combinação de cortiça com matrizes poliméricas revela ser uma mais-valia 

significativa para materiais com base na cortiça, com alto potencial para uma ampla gama de 

aplicações inovadoras.

Introduction to the thesis format 

The format of the thesis is divided into 4 main sections that are organized according with the defined 

aims, the nature of the work developed and the results achieved. The high potential of the cork-polymer 

composites (CPC) to obtain sustainable materials; the complexity to compound high volumes of cork 

through melt based technologies; the reinforcement strategies using hybrid systems (i.e. based on cork 

and natural fibres) to improve the mechanical response and the improvement of cork-polymer adhesion, 

were the key issues considered in this work to potentiate a wide range of innovative applications for 

cork based products. The thesis is sub-divided in 10 chapters, being 7 of them experimental work and 1 

literature review that is based on peer-reviewed papers published / submitted for publication. All papers 

are identified in the front page of each chapter. In this sense, each thesis chapter is the published, 

submitted or an adapted version of these, in order to maintain the global structure of the work. Finally, 

and in appendix format, are provided 2 international patents developed during this thesis 

complementing in more detail some parts of the work. Figure A shows the structure of the thesis 

divided in the 4 main sections. The contents of each chapter are summarized below. 

 

 

Figure A. Scheme representing the structure of the thesis. 

 

SECTION I (Chapter 1): The first section consists of a comprehensive and detailed literature review 

about bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources and their potential uses particularly in the

xliv 

biomedical field. The review highlights the potential of different lignocellulosic components as 

reinforcement at the nanometer level in different structures. This review combined with the 

introductions presented in the section III (i.e. chapter 3 up to chapter 9) aims to give a higher 

consciousness, the recent developments and potentialities of this technological area, where the main 

issue is the lack of knowledge on cork-polymer composites (CPC) through melt based technologies. 

 

SECTION II (Chapter 2): The second section describes in detail the materials used, the processing 

techniques employed to develop the different CPC and the characterization techniques used to evaluate 

and understand the characteristics of the developed CPC. The objective was to complement the 

provided information in each of the following experimental chapters. 

 

SECTION III (Chapter 3 to 9): The third section includes 7 chapters, corresponding to the results and 

discussion sections of 7 research papers. As previously pointed, the introduction of each chapter 

intends to support the reader on the subject, providing information of the state-of-art on the area and 

the central motivations of the work.  

 

Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, are devoted to the development of cork based polyolefin composite pellets by 

pulltrusion process followed by compression moulding. In both chapters, high consumption 

thermoplastic materials (i.e. polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE)) were tested to obtain cork-based 

composites (50-50) wt.% with a competitive cost. Moreover and accounting with the polar behaviour of 

cork and the non-polar behaviour of the polyolefin, a small amount of coupling agent (2 wt.%) based on 

maleic anhydride (i.e. PE-g-MA or PP-g-MA) was used to improve the adhesion. 

 

Chapter 3 focuses on the potential of different cork by-products from the industrial process, creating 

added value to cork and a profitable alternative to storage or burn of cork powder to generate energy in 

industrial process. 

 

Chapter 4 describes a comparative study between a selected cork-polymer composition previously 

developed in Chapter 3, with the well-established commercial products, namely high-density fibreboard 

(HDF) and medium density fibreboard (MDF) products. An extensive characterization of these systems

included water absorption and thickness swelling of the materials, warping and density, morphology, 

mechanical and thermal properties and other specific tests such as fire resistance and acoustic tests. 

 

Chapter 5 focuses on the use of cork particles and cork powder compounded with polypropylene (PP) 

by co-rotating twin-screw extrusion and further processed by injection or compression moulding.  Thus, 

a different technology to compound the CPC pellets was evaluated. The addition of polypropylene-graft-

maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid were also tested as coupling agents. The influence of cork 

on the melt viscosity, on morphological particle distribution, physical and thermal properties is 

described. The mechanical response before and after water immersion tests was also analysed to 

evaluate the potential of application. Moreover, the maximum incorporation of cork in the composite 

was also accessed. 

 

Being the compatibility between cork-polyolefin one of the key issues, Chapter 6 proposes the use of 

suberin and lignin isolated from cork powder as bio-based coupling agents through a reactive extrusion 

process, in order to overcome the insufficient adhesion between cork and a polyethylene matrix with 

environmental benefits. To evaluate their potential as an adhesion promoter, the properties of the new 

functionalized composites are compared with those of an equivalent system using a coupling agent PE-

g-MA. 

 

Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 were devoted to reinforcement strategies using short natural fibres to improve 

the mechanical response of the cork based composites. It was developed and tested hybrid CPC 

systems using counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion followed by compression moulding, maintaining a 

high cork content. Special emphasis was given in both chapters to obtaining higher mechanical 

properties by increasing the amount of the natural component in the final composite. In addition, the 

need of low amount of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (2 wt.%) was tested. In Chapter 7 

cork powder-polymer composites (50-50) wt.% reinforced with coconut fibre were evaluated.  

 

Following a similar strategy, in Chapter 8, it was selected a fibre with higher mechanical performance to 

reinforce the developed composites.  In this chapter, we investigated the use of short sisal fibres, with 

and without alkali treatment as a strategy to reinforce cork granules-polymer (40-60) wt.% composite

materials. Weibull cumulative distribution was employed to accurately predict the mechanical failure of 

the hybrid cork based materials.  

 

Pursuing more sustainable materials and the constant concern as a research group that envisages the 

use polymers from natural resources in noble applications in the biomedical field, the natural evolution 

was to design cork biocomposites. Chapter 9 addresses the preparation of biocomposites combining 

different biodegradable aliphatic polyesters with granulated cork 30 wt.%. Cork was compounded with 

poly(L-lactic acid), (PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) 

and starch-poly-?-caprolactone (SPCL) using co-rotating twin-screw extruder followed by injection 

moulding. The contribution of cork to the composite density and mechanical performance was 

evaluated. Biodegradation of these cork biocomposites under water and soil conditions accessed by 

means of morphology and by the physico-mechanical behaviour was described. 

 

SECTION IV (Chapter 10): This thesis ends with Chapter 10, which consists on the summary and the 

overall conclusions of the research work developed under the scope of this thesis with some 

recommendations and future perspectives on the cork-polymer composites (CPC) area.

Abstract 

The selection, synthesis, modification and shaping of biomaterials are complex tasks within the 

biomedical field. Human and plant tissues, such as, wood, bone and cartilage are structured at the 

nanometer level and exhibit a hierarchical structure up to the macroscale. Their morphological 

similarities enable the exploitation of lignocellulosic materials in the development of nanostructured 

composites targeting tissue engineering and regeneration. In this review, lignocellulosic materials and 

their chemical constituents are highlighted as promising alternatives for the development of drug-

delivery vehicles and for the engineering or regeneration of bone and cartilage. Special focus is given to 

the recent developments of lignocellulosic bionanocomposite supports that induce cell attachment and 

proliferation. Chemical modifications techniques as well as composite processing methodologies that 

enhance the biomaterial performance are reviewed. It is anticipated the increasing interest in 

nanocellulose, bacterial cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from natural resources as added-value 

biomedical materials in the near future.

trends for their use in the biomedical field

1.1 Introduction 

The Bionanocomposites are usually defined as a combination of two or more materials or phases in 

which one of the phases has at least one dimension in the nanometer range (1–100 nm) [1-4]. The 

terminology usually refers to a matrix for the more concentrated component that enables a phase 

continuum, while reinforcements are components that induce an enhanced performance (e.g. 

mechanical, thermal, etc.) from the composite. Matrices may be biodegradable polymers (e.g. chemical 

modified cellulose systems), ideally derived from renewable resources (e.g. plants). In terms of 

reinforcements, they might include plant fibers and by-products from lignocellulosic renewable 

resources or synthetic inorganic materials, as well as natural or modified clays. Plant-based 

nanocellulose and bacterial cellulose [5] are included in this definition. Moreover, blended polymers 

that act as matrices in a composite perspective are also included. The reviewed constructs target the 

development of biocompatible medical devices, or biodegradable materials under a complete tissue 

regeneration approach. The interest in lignocellulosic polymers, in particular the cellulose-based ones, is 

due to their reinforcement capacity and biodegradability. Moreover, cellulose-based materials have 

proven to present excellent biocompatibility [6, 7]. Being the term biocompatibility defined as the ability 

of a material to perform with an appropriated host response in a specific biomedical application [8].This 

set of characteristics are the most relevant to consider these materials as good candidates for tissue 

engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) applications, both as scaffolds or as drug-delivery carrier 

systems. Nanotechnology can be applied across different application areas, allowing the development of 

the so called enabling science. The ability to control the material features at the nanoscale and the 

evaluation of their influence in the micro and macroscopic properties provides the opportunity to 

develop new bionanocomposite systems in a previously unimaginable dimension. Bionanocomposites 

are attractive materials for biomedical applications due to the matching of the length scales of: their 

structure and the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Under these conditions, the 

development of nanostructured biomaterials for medical applications implies a multidisciplinary 

research approach that combines engineering, chemistry, physics, biology and life sciences. 

In this review we have compiled the research executed with lignocellulosic materials in the biomedical 

field, with particular emphasis on drug-delivery systems and scaffolds relevant in the scope of TERM. 

The main focus will be on the development of bionanocomposite structures formulated with 

lignocellulosic components within the previously described fields of application. Nanostructured

trends for their use in the biomedical field

pyrolyzed lignocellulosic structures will be also discussed as carbon templates for scaffold development. 

The addition of plant-based and bacterial-based cellulose (BC) to enhance thermal and mechanical 

properties, as well as the biodegradability of biomaterials is also analyzed. The use of cellulose, 

hemicellulose and lignin as components of bionanocomposite systems are described, with special focus 

on micro and nano-sized reinforcements. It is also highlighted the use of chemical modified 

lignocellulosic materials, focusing on the advantages of these modifications in order to promote 

biocompatibility. Moreover it is compiled the available processing methodologies and their impact in the 

properties of the bionanocomposites.  

This review intends to show that biomaterials from lignocellulosic sources have potential to play an 

important role in human health. An overview of the current and potential applications of lignocellulosic-

based bionanocomposites is performed and includes the research relevant mainly for bone and 

cartilage engineering and regeneration; although, their application as drug-delivery carriers and wound 

dressing systems are also described. Complementary information can be found in literature reviews that 

focus on the potential of cellulose-based nanocomposites in different areas such as: food packaging 

materials and films [2, 9, 10]; printing and paper industry [2, 3, 11]; optical, light-responsive 

composites and other electronic devices [3, 9, 12-14]; advanced composites manufacturing [10, 12]; 

pharmaceutical and medical applications [3, 5, 13]. Additionally it is also possible to find reviews on the 

properties and potential of cellulose nanofibers and its composites [10, 15]; on BC-based materials [11, 

16-18], and methodologies to control their physical and chemical structure targeting their application as 

scaffolds and wound healing systems, as well as, within the scope of tissue engineering (TE) [19, 20]; 

and lignocellulosic-based hydrogels, including biodegradation of some cellulose derivatives [21-23]. 

1.2 Bone and cartilage tissue regeneration 

1.2.1 Materials properties 

The selection of biomaterials is particularly relevant within most of the TE strategies. Its main function is 

to act as a support for the colonization by cells in the intervened area, promoting the formation of new 

tissue.  In this perspective, the biomaterial should present a set of adequate mechanical, thermal, 

morphological, chemical and biological characteristics [24-26]. 

In a mechanical point of view the support biomaterial should withstand the mechanical stresses within 

the tissue to be repaired. Most of the biomaterials (e.g. metals, high performance polymers, etc.) used

trends for their use in the biomedical field

to substitute the bone/cartilage possess a higher stiffness than the tissue to be intervened. This usually 

imposes additional stresses to the surrounding biological tissue enhancing the probability of its 

mechanical failure [27]. There is thus the need for the development of materials that present 

mechanical performance similar to the tissue to be repaired enabling a better mechanical integration of 

the constructs in the biological tissue. The mechanical properties of different biological tissues are 

summarized in Table 1.1, including examples of references [28-33].

a Strongly viscoelastic. 

The cortical bone usually possesses a compressive strength between 131 and 205 MPa; typical values 

for its flexural and tensile strength is between 53 and 135 MPa and its modulus is between 3 and 18 

GPa [28]. Although, it is relevant to notice that, in vivo, the performance of the biomaterial-based 

structure is not only derived from the mechanical resistance of the biomaterial itself, but from the 

complex mixture of biomaterial, ECM components (e.g. proteins) and cells [27]. 

In TE, it is common the use of a regenerative approach that intends to promote the formation of new 

tissue while the original biomaterial is being degraded. In this strategy, it is common the use of porous 

scaffolds that allow cell colonization in the bulk of the constructs [24]. Porosity is mandatory not only to 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

8 

allow the accessibility of cells to the bulk but also to allow the exchange of nutrients and oxygen that are 

vital for cell survival under in vivo conditions [24, 34, 35]. 

Under this approach it is considered acceptable a lower mechanical performance than the original 

tissue, as long as, the scaffold itself will not be subject to loadings above is elastic regime. In fact, the 

mechanical performance of this type of scaffolds is significantly lower than the base biomaterial. It is 

common to occur a 10-fold reduction of different mechanical properties, e.g. modulus [36]. 

Other important factor in designing TE supports is its surface properties [37]. They are relevant to 

induce cellular attachment, differentiation and proliferation. The first response of the biological medium 

when in contact with the TE constructs is to coat the biomaterial with a layer of proteins. The 

composition of this layer is strongly affected by the biomaterial surface chemistry and energy [38]. This 

initial process is critical for the first steps of cell attachment. Although, it is often difficult to match the 

different bulk properties of the selected scaffold biomaterials with a surface chemistry/energy optimized 

to promote cell attachment. 

In order to achieve an appropriate surface chemistry/energy, surface modification techniques are often 

used to confer specific chemical groups that are known to promote cell attachment [39-41]. These can 

range from chemical grafting, plasma modification, surface coating or patterning approaches [42-46]. 

1.2.2 Biological requirements 

Depending on the target tissue there are a number of biological requirements that the support structure 

and the biomaterial should present. In the case of bone, the most relevant are related with [47, 48]: 

bioactivity; osteoproduction, osteoconduction and osteoinduction; angiogenic potential; and capacity to 

minimize the foreign body response.  

Bioactivity is defined as the capacity of the biomaterial to form a biologically active apatite layer on its 

surface [47, 49]. The formation of these types of layers occurs by a complex set of chemical steps that 

promote the surface immobilization of calcium and phosphate ions [48] and their subsequent 

organization into calcium phosphate phases. These phases are one of the responsible for a series of 

properties that are relevant for bone TE, namely, bone-bonding properties of the implanted device. 

Supports/biomaterials can present different biological characteristics that define their classification in 

terms of bioactivity. Biomaterials that only possess osteoconduction (capacity to stimulate bone growth 

at the biomaterials’ surface) are considered to be of class B. When a biomaterial possesses both 

osteoproduction (bone growth in the interior of the support) and osteoconduction it is said to present 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

9 

class A bioactivity [47]. An additional advantage is the promotion of not only the proliferation, but also 

the differentiation of progenitor cells (osteoinduction) into osteoblasts [50]. This can be achieved with 

the incorporation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) into the biomaterials [51-53]. There are a 

series of different BMPs that are relevant at different stages of bone/cartilage formation, healing and 

remodeling [54, 55]. As an example, BMP-2 appear to peak at one day after fracture; BMP-14 has a 

maximum of activity at one week during cartilage formation; finally, BMP-3, -4, -7 and -8 are more 

relevant between the second and third week of bone repair [55, 56]. These observations motivated the 

development of a series of strategies to achieve BMP controlled delivery from the support structures to 

the biological medium, with a profile that match their biological relevance [55]. 

In a bone TE perspective, a complete bone remodeling and growth is better achieved by biomaterials 

and supports that present the whole set of the discussed biological characteristics: bioactivity, 

osteoconduction, osteoproduction and osteoinduction. A highly relevant part of new bone formation in 

the interior of the support is the existence of a vasculature that is able to transport nutrients essential to 

cellular development [57]. It is known that osteocytes (the most common type of cells present in bone) 

possess intact capillaries at a distance lower than 100 µm. Additionally, the nutrient transport from the 

blood vessels to the cells is mainly governed by diffusion. As an example, theoretical modeling reveals 

that non-vascularized support structures with 1 cm can hold 1000 times lesser cells than native 

cancelous bone [58]. In this perspective, it is clear that the importance of angiogenesis is increasing 

with the dimension of the intervened area [35, 59]. Different strategies can be applied to increment 

angiogenesis, namely: the tuning of the construct geometry; the inclusion of angiogenic growth factors 

(e.g. VEGF, FGF); and the culturing of the structures in the presence of stem cells, endothelial cells, as 

well as the use of co-culture systems [53, 60-65]. 

Finally, the implantation of a biomaterial in the biological tissue always generates an inflammatory 

response related with the surgical procedure. The use of degradable supports can also increase 

inflammation due to the degradation products that are leached from the biomaterial [66]. Initial foreign 

body response can be minimized by surface modification of the biomaterials (e.g. surface chemistry, 

topography, roughness) [67, 68] or the use of bioactive compounds (e.g. anti-inflammatory drugs, 

growth factors) in their formulation [69-71].

1.3 Sources of lignocellulosic materials 

1.3.1 Plant based 

The use of cellular materials has the advantage of possessing good mechanical properties while 

presenting low density [72]. In nature, several materials present a cellular anisotropic structure, e.g. 

bone, wood, cork, among others; although, while bone is ceramic-polymer composite, wood is mostly a 

polymer-based composite.  

Wood is a natural composite material with a hierarchical architecture where biopolymers such as 

cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin form a highly porous anisotropic cellular microstructure, which 

exhibits unique combination of high strength, stiffness, toughness and low density [72, 73]. The 

chemical constituents of the wood cell wall, as well as other lignocellulosic-based materials are 

presented in Table 1.2, including their concentrations reported in the literature [73-80]. It’s clear that 

the concentration of each component can significantly differ depending on the plant species. In general, 

the major organic constituents are [73, 74, 79, 81-83]: 

- Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer and presents a long-chain polysaccharide structure 

composed by repeated units of d-glucose building blocks [81] see Figure 1.1. The polymeric chains are 

packed through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces forming fibrous structures called microfibrils. 

As a structural component in plants, cellulose is arranged as a system of fibrils embedded in a lignin 

matrix. The microfibrils are a few nanometers of diameter presenting highly ordered regions (i.e. 

crystalline phases) alternated with disordered domains (i.e. amorphous phases) [81, 84, 85]. A single 

fibril has a diameter of ca. 5 nm and a length up to tens of micrometers [81]. These fibrils are 

comprised of different hierarchical microstructures commonly known as nano-sized microfibrils with 

high structural strength and stiffness, being the crystalline part named nanowhiskers [1], or 

nanocellulose crystals [10, 86]. Cellulose nanowhiskers are defined as elongated crystalline rod-like 

nanoparticles with a diameter ranging from 2 to 20 nm, typically obtained by acid hydrolysis of cellulose 

fibers [14, 15, 87]. The hydrolysis conditions and the type of acid affect the properties of the 

nanocrystals, such as a longer reaction time leads to shorter nanocrystals [88, 89]. Furthermore, the 

use of sulfuric acid for the preparation of cellulose whiskers leads to more stable aqueous suspensions 

than the ones prepared using hydrochloric acid [12, 89, 90]. It promotes a negatively charged surface 

resulting from the surface oxidation promoted by the sulfate ions, so that the cellulose suspension 

forms a stable colloidal system [89, 91].

Moreover, cellulosic materials exhibit poor degradation in vivo [6]. Strategies to overcome this drawback 

are:  the enzymatic oxidation with peroxidase secreted by fungi as well as being degraded by bacteria, 

yielding non-toxic products [92]. The presence of amorphous regions can increase biodegradability.

Lowering the crystallinity and hydrophobicity of cellulose-based materials are known approaches to 

improve their biodegradability in vivo [6]. 

- Hemicelluloses, are located mainly in the secondary cell walls, and together with cellulose and lignin, 

they build up the structure of the plants in a fashion that generates the best combination of mechanical 

support and transport properties [82]. They are a group of branched polysaccharides (see Figure 1.1) 

that are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by presenting ?-(1?4)-linked repeating 

units of glucose, mannose or xylose [23, 83]. Cellulose and hemicelluloses contain free hydroxyl groups 

that confer to the wood its inherent hygroscopic character [85]. Since hemicelluloses are responsible 

for the interactions with water in wood, hydrogels using these materials have applications within 

different fields [82, 93].

- Lignin, is an amorphous polymer and its main role is to act as a structural support in plants. Lignin 

has a phenolic-based chemical structure; its high carbon and low hydrogen content suggests that it has 

a highly unsaturated and aromatic character. Lignin is characterized by its hydroxyl and methoxy groups 

[79] as it is represented in Figure 1.2. The chemical structure of lignin in natural fibers has not been 

completely established, although, most of its functional groups and units which make up the molecule 

have been identified [73, 79]. More than its potential as biomaterial, lignin has demonstrated 

antioxidant capacity; strong antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus; and other anti-

microbial activities [94, 95]. 

- Suberin, consists of a complex polyester structure composed by long chain fatty acids, hydroxy fatty 

and phenolic acids, linked by ester groups [73] present in the outer tissues of numerous vegetable 

species. It is mostly found in the cell walls of normal and wounded external tissues of aerial and/or 

subterranean parts of plants. It acts as a protective barrier between the organism and its environment

[74, 96]. The presence of terminal carboxylic and hydroxy groups and of side hydroxy and epoxy 

moieties on the long chains of suberin ‘‘monomers’’ makes them appropriate as building blocks for 

polymers with interesting properties. Suberin represents typically between 20 and 50% of the extractive-

free bark weight [74].

Like bone, lignocellulosic materials exhibit pores for the transportation of nutrients. Bone and wood 

present similar hierarchical structure from the nano to the macro-scale, (see the structure of both types 

of materials in Figure 1.3. Collagen is a fibrous structural protein that can be found in all vertebrates. It 

is present in bone, cartilage, skin, tendons and other tissues [30, 97]. Collagen in combination with 

hydroxyapatite (HA) offers mechanical support in bone; similarly, cellulose has the same function in

wood. Lignocellulosic materials and bone present porous networks in both biological materials, although 

different in size and connectivity, they provide channels for nutrient transport and exchange [98].

There are plant species that present similar chemical components in different sections of the tree, e.g. 

bark [75]. The extraction of bark, in some cases, can be executed without harvesting the whole tree, 

maintaining it alive. An example is the outer bark of Quercus suber, commonly known as cork. As wood, 

cork is a lignocellulosic material were suberin is the main chemical component, with concentrations 

between 30 and 50% [73]. Suberin is not present in the wood cell walls. This material presents a 

anisotropic closed cellular structure and a unique combination of properties, such as imperviousness to 

liquids, a high coefficient of friction, resilient, low density, viscoelastic, low thermal conductivity, fire 

resistance, high energy absorption and a near-zero Poisson coefficient [72, 73, 102]. The combination 

of these unique properties and the potential of the lignocellulosic chemical components has been issue 

of several studies for different purposes [74, 103-105]. 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future

15 

Moreover, lignocellulosic materials from plant fibers such as bamboo, sisal, hemp, among others, also 

present an anisotropic structure and they are a relevant source of cellulose and hemicellulose 

derivatives in the biomedical field. Just as an example it can be referred the use of bioactive ceramic 

coatings on bamboo [106] generating a material that presents mechanical properties close to the 

modulus of human long bone [107]. Bamboo has been tested for its in vitro cytotoxicity before and after 

heat or chemical treatments [107]. The results showed that ethanol, methanol and toluene can remove 

toxic and some extend leachable components from bamboo. More recently, the preparation of cellulose 

nanofibers from bamboo with diameters of 30-80 nm was achieved by chemical pretreatment and 

ultrasonication, followed by freeze-drying [84]. These nanofibers presented an organized structure 

composed by millions of parallel nanofibrils of 1-5 nm and several microns of length. The main 

composition of the produced nanofibers was based in cellulose due to the removal of non-cellulosic 

polysaccharides via conventional chemical treatment.  

The use of lignocellulosic structures and their components on the production of nanocomposites will 

open new opportunities for biomedical applications. 

1.3.2 Bacterial cellulose 

Bacterial Cellulose (BC) sometimes referred to as bacterial nanocellulose or microbial cellulose is a 

natural polymer whose properties are similar to the hydrogels produced from synthetic polymers; for 

example, it displays high water content (98-99%) and good sorption of liquids, it is non-allergenic, and 

can be safely sterilized. BC is synthesized by the acetic bacterium Acetobacter xylinum (or 

Gluconacetobacter xylinus), a gram-negative strain of acetic-acid-producing bacteria using a 

fermentation process [108, 109]. BC is a nanomaterial, having several characteristics that make it 

valuable for biomedical applications such as: a highly pure and crystalline structure, high mechanical 

properties, ultra-fine network, high hydrophilicity and biocompatibility and it has the advantage of in situ 

mouldability [81, 109-112]. The fibrous structure of BC consists of a 3D network of microfibrils 

containing glucan chains bounded together by hydrogen bonds. BC fibers of&amp;lt;100 nm in diameter have 

high mechanical properties, e.g. tensile strength and modulus. BC microfibrils have a density of 1600 

kg m-3, Young’s modulus of 138 GPa, and tensile strength of at least 2 GPa, which are almost equal to 

those of aramid fibers [113]. Its unique network structure is the main responsible for the previously 

described characteristics. The potential applications of BC are quite vast; it can be used in the

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

16 

preparation of materials targeting decellularised devices for wound healing or as scaffold for skin 

engineering after seeded with epithelial cells [19] or more recently in vascular grafts [114, 115]. 

In an in vivo study of subcutaneous BC implantation in rats [116] it was found that after 12 weeks, no 

fibrotic capsule or giant cells was detectable by microscopy, indicating that no foreign body reaction 

was occurring (see Figure 1.4). Furthermore, macroscopically, no redness, swelling, or exudate 

developed around the implantation sites was observed showing the biocompatibility and the potential of 

this nanomaterial.

the interface area at the porous side of BC, 12 weeks after implantation (b). Arrowheads show collagen

Another study performed by Klemm et al. [5, 16] evaluated the suitability of BC cylindrical conduits with 

an inner diameter of, approximately, 1 mm as artificial blood vessels. Bodin et al. [117] have also 

proposed BC as a potential meniscus implant being similar to human skin. BC can be produced in a 

meniscus shape and, through the promotion of cell migration, makes it an attractive material as a 

meniscus implant. BC can be also applied as skin substitute in treating extensive burns [118]. The 

nanostructured network and morphological similarities with collagen make BC very attractive for cell 

immobilization, cell migration, and the production of ECMs [5].

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

17 

As reviewed by Klemm et al. [5, 81, 108], celluloses with different functionalities clearly open novel 

fields of application e.g., nanoporous hydrophilic membranes, nanoscaffold-based composite materials, 

and medical implants for repair of hard and soft tissue, as well as cardiovascular substitutes. 

1.4 Reinforced nanocomposite structures 

1.4.1 Cellulose-based materials 

TE represents an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines biological, chemical, engineering and 

life sciences towards the goal of tissue regeneration [24, 119, 120]. Scaffolds with different 

architectures and pore sizes can be produced from synthetic or naturally occurring materials. BC and 

cellulosic nanofibers are widely used as biobased nanoreinforcements in several polymeric matrices 

owing to their superior mechanical properties [113, 121]. The high surface area to volume ratio of the 

nanofibers combined with their microporous structure favors cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and 

differentiation, all of which are highly desired properties for TE applications [122]. The development of 

nanofibers can be used to formulate bionanocomposites that can potentially mimic the architecture of 

natural human tissue at the nanometer scale. On a composite perspective, one of the main reasons to 

use cellulose nanofibers is based on their high stiffness, being highly relevant as a reinforcement 

strategy. For example, this can be achieved by breaking down the hierarchical structure of the plant into 

individualized nanofibers of high crystallinity, with a reduction of amorphous parts [10]. Studies have 

been reported the use of BC alone or combined with HA, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or cellulose 

nanowhiskers (CNWs) as reinforcement strategies, to create bionanocomposites [112, 121, 123-126]. 

MCC consists generally of stiff rod-like particles called whiskers, obtained from different natural 

resources such as eucalyptus [127], sisal [87], cotton [86, 128], spruce [91, 129], ramine [130], 

tunicin [131, 132], among others. The morphology of CNWs from different sources is shown in Figure 

1.5. 

CNWs possesses: very large surface to volume ratio; good mechanical properties, including high 

modulus, high tensile strength; low coefficient of thermal expansion; and formation of highly porous 

meshes compared to the commercial fibers [2, 10, 128]. In cellulose, each microfibril can be 

considered as a string of polymer whiskers having a modulus close to that of the perfect crystal of 

native cellulose, which is estimated to be 150 GPa, and possessing a strength of about 10 GPa [136].

General properties such as diameter, length and aspect ratio of various nanofiber types are presented 

in Table 1.3. Information related with the geometric characteristics of a specific fiber was recently 

reviewed by Kalia et al. [3]. 

BC fibrils are in the nanometer range and are microscopically similar to collagen fibers [138, 139]. 

Moreover, some studies [124, 140] point out the biological capacities of BC, which has shown, for 

example, osteoconduction properties. These characteristics make them particularly interesting to be 

used as a collagen-mimicking component in scaffolds. For example, HA with BC has been combined by 

Wan et al. [124, 141, 142] to prepared a novel class of bionanocomposites SEM observations 

demonstrated that HA crystals were uniformly distributed on the phosphorylated BC fibers after soaking

in 1.5 simulated body fluid (SBF) [124]. The 3D network structure revealed that the crystallite size of 

the HA crystals formed on the BC fibers after 7 and 14 days of soaking in 1.5 SBF are nano-sized, 

dimensions of 37 nm and 46 nm for 7 and 14 days, respectively [141].

Nanocomposites containing HA with structural features close to the biological apatites are attractive for 

applications as artificial bone supports within for TE [2, 141].  Research on BC-HA nanocomposites in 

the form of membranes demonstrated the potential application of these systems in TE and bone 

regeneration [123, 125, 143]. Fang et al. [123] showed that BC-HA nanocomposite scaffolds were 

biocompatible and could promote cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In this study the authors 

used stromal cells derived from human bone marrow (hBMSC), and real-time reverse transcription PCR 

results showed that their alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of osteopontin, 

osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and ALP mRNA were all higher for cells cultured for 7 days in the 

presence of the nanocomposites than for those cultured on pure BC with and without the presence of 

osteogenic supplements, such as, L-ascorbic acid, glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone. These 

results suggest that the developed scaffolds have potential for bone TE. Shaska et al. [125] also 

described the preparation of membranes composed by BC reinforced with HA and evaluated the 

biological behavior of these membranes for the regeneration of non-critical bone defects in rat tibiae, 

throughout a time period of 16 weeks. The nanocomposites were prepared from BC membranes and

incubated in solutions of CaCl2 followed by Na2HPO4. The work revealed that the membranes are 

effective for bone regeneration since they accelerated new bone formation. Recently, 

bionanocomposites scaffolds based on BC were prepared in a collagen solution followed by freeze-

drying. The resulted material presented biocompatibility [144]. Collagen was also combined with 

cellulose nanofibers to produce nanocomposites as implantable scaffolds in biomedical applications, 

more specifically, for ligament or tendon regeneration [126]. The methodology is based on 

gluteraldeyhyde crosslinking; the two composite phases (cellulose nanofibers and collagen) were 

prepared by solution casting followed by pH induced in situ partial fibrillation of the collagen phase. The 

collagen fibrils (50 nm of diameter) provided biocompatibility, fatigue resistance and elasticity while the 

cellulose nanofibers of 12-39 nm acted as a reinforcing phase. These composites, at room 

temperature, presented mechanical strength of 132–150 MPa and a modulus of 5–6 MPa, significantly 

higher than the collagen matrix. Moreover, biocompatibility studies indicated non-cytotoxicity for 

collagen-cellulose bionanocomposites and revealed that the composite surface is promising for cell 

adhesion. The main drawback of this methodology is the type of crosslinking agent due to its typical 

cytotoxicity. Additionally, collagen-cellulose ratio as well as crosslinking level for collagen phase needs to 

be further improved to match the mechanical performance of natural ligament or tendon. 

Some studies on bionanocomposites have been reporting the use of clay or modified clay as 

reinforcements to promote the mechanical (e.g., toughness) and interfacial adhesion in matrices 

relevant for the biomedical field, namely: polylactic acid (PLA); poly(butylene succinate) (PBS); 

polycaprolactone (PCL); polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB); and aliphatic polyesters blends [145-147]. On the 

reinforcement side, few studies have been published concerning the processing of cellulose nanofibers 

reinforced nanocomposites by conventional melt compounding, such as extrusion [121, 126, 129]. 

Most of these studies were not executed for TE purposes. The use of cellulose whiskers in 

bionanocomposites has been mainly limited to hydrophilic matrices due to their surface chemistry 

[129] and to its limited production enabling only a lab scale usage. In this sense their exploitation on 

nanoreinforcement in biopolymers requires the scale-up of their production in order to achieve higher 

amounts at an appropriated time and yield [91]. 

Lignocellulosic materials are quite sensitive to thermal degradation and start to degrade near 230 ºC, 

restricting the type of matrix that can be used in association with natural fillers [12, 148]. On the other 

hand, during processing, the hydrophilic nature of cellulose promotes the irreversible agglomeration 

and aggregation in nonpolar matrices. This is due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

21 

amorphous parts of the nanofibers. Surface modification of the whiskers, have been able to improve 

their mixability with the hydrophobic matrices. The addition of coupling agents, such as, polyethylene 

glycol (PEG) grafting [121]; or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [129] improves the dispersion of the nanowiskers 

into the matrix. Other chemical treatments have been also reported, and will be discussed in the section 

dedicated to modified cellulose. 

The preparation of CNWs reinforced PLA nanocomposites by melt extrusion was carried out by pumping 

a suspension of CNWs into the polymer melt during the extrusion process using a proper venting 

system, able to remove the solvent during extrusion [121]. MCC has been used and treated with N,N-

dimethylacetamide (DMAc) containing lithium chloride (LiCl) to swell the MCC and partly separate the 

cellulose whiskers. After extrusion the composite structure presented a partial dispersion of the CNWs 

mostly when PEG and maleated PLA were used.  The results showed that DMAc/LiCl is effective as 

swelling/separation agent for MCC, however it causes degradation of the composites at the high 

temperatures used during processing. The mechanical properties of the maleated PLA/PEG/CNWs 

bionanocomposites improved compared to PLA treated with DMAc. The elongation at break increased 

about 800%, the tensile strength 20% and the modulus decreased by 10%. An attempt to use PVA as a 

compatibilizer to promote the dispersion of CNWs within the PLA matrix has also been reported [129].  

PVA is a water-soluble polymer with high tensile strength. The authors hypothesized that the hydroxyl 

groups of the partial hydrolyzed PVA interact with the hydrophilic surfaces of cellulose and the residual 

vinyl acetate groups with the hydrophobic PLA. A small improvement was observed in the tensile 

modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break, indicating that the main responsible for the 

mechanical enhancement was derived from the PVA phase reinforced with CNWs and not from the PLA 

matrix. Although, microscopic analysis revealed inadequate dispersion of the CNWs in the PLA phase 

due to the immiscibility of the PLA and PVA. No relevant variation on the thermal performance was 

observed since the CNWs were more allocated to the PVA phase and only a negligible amount was 

located in the PLA phase. 

Replacing the clay reinforcement by cellulose in the form of microfibrils, CNW, BC or MCC leads to fully 

natural-based and renewable bionanocomposite materials with higher mechanical properties and with 

potential to be applied in biomedical field. 

CNWs from different plant species have been proposed as a reinforcement strategy in the development 

of bionanocomposites. Their combination with PVA nanofibers, starch/PVA sponges [128, 149], 

chitosan [127] and PLA [129, 150] has demonstrated potential to be used in the biomedical field. Not

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

22 

all of these studies have produced relevant reinforcement improvements in terms of dimensional 

stability, mechanical or thermal properties. Enhanced results were obtained with the production of 

honeycomb structures of starch with PVA using freezing-thawing technique [128]. This methodology 

produced stable sponges that were reinforced with CNWs for wound dressing and TE purposes. The 

CNWs were homogeneously distributed and restricted the packaging of the starch/PVA sponges, 

leading to an improvement of dimensional stability, compression strength and storage modulus. These 

bionanocomposites presented biocompatibility and the presence of CNW induced a small reduction on 

the swelling.  More recently, CNWs in the 5-10 nm range have demonstrated a more significant 

reinforcement effect on the aligned electrospun PVA fiber webs compared with the isotropic electrospun 

fiber webs.  The modulus and tensile strength of the aligned webs obtained by electrospining increased 

35% and 45%, respectively. The aligned fibers presented lower diameter when compared with the fibers 

produced with PVA alone. The addition of 15% of CNWs induced a 95% higher tensile strength and an 

increase of 118% in the modulus [149]. 

CNWs were recently used by Zhang et al. [151] to prepare a supramolecular hydrogel based on 

cyclodextrin/polymer inclusion. It was shown that the incorporation of 0.5 wt% of CNWs into the 

hydrogel enhances its gelation, mechanical strength and facilitates sustained release of drugs. The 

modulus of the bionanocomposite hydrogel was 50 times higher than that of the native hydrogel. 

Further evaluation of the bionanocomposite hydrogel, namely cell viability evaluation did not indicate 

any additional cytotoxicity. These results support their potential as smart drug delivery systems and as 

injectable biomaterial. 

Biodegradable nanocomposites were also obtained with layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique [120] 

using chitosan and CNWs from eucalyptus wood. Chitosan is a biodegradable cationic 

aminopolysaccharide derived from its acetylated form, chitin.  The interaction of chitosan and CNWs 

occurred due to the formation of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the sulfate 

groups on the whisker surface and the amine groups of chitosan. SEM analysis indicated a dense and 

homogeneous distribution of the CNWs with a formation of a porous network structure that increases 

the contact area and the interfacial adhesion between the rigid polymer and the nanofillers. Moreover, 

the cross section of the assembled films showed a nanometric thickness of ?7 nm per bilayer [127]. 

The relevant contributions of chitosan are its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antibacterial 

properties, making this polymer suitable for drug delivery, TE, wound healing applications, and as a tool 

to produce antimicrobial materials [152-154]. The authors of this study concluded that chitosan lacks

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

23 

the flexibility necessary for strong adhesion and efficient load transfer between the organic matrix and 

the clay platelets. However, CNWs is reported as an alternative to clay platelets as nanofiller for the 

preparation of multilayered nanocomposite films [127].  

The fabrication of nanoscale devices is currently the subject of a great deal of research; although, 

limited progress has been achieved. The nanoscale constructions using a bottom-up approach to build 

devices have many foreseeable applications in diverse areas, such as: miniaturized electronics; 

sensors; and biomedical devices [2, 10, 155]. CNWs are one of the most chemically versatile, 

abundant and inexpensive nanoparticles available for nanodevice development [10]. 

1.4.2 Modified celluloses and lignin-based materials 

The biocompatibility of cellulose, hemicellulose and their derivatives confers to them biomedical 

relevance. Different chemical modifications have been reported to the cellulose and lignin structures. A 

resume of the most relevant ones is compiled in Table 1.4. 

In relation to bone and cartilage TE, one of the most studied chemical modifications is the acetylation of 

cellulose hydroxyl moieties (Figure 1.6, Table 1.4), producing cellulose acetate (CA). CA has been used 

as isolated component or as part of composites or blends in the development of TE supports. Blending 

CA with starch produces starch cellulose acetate (SCA), a biocompatible material that exhibits 

biodegradability and biocompatibility [169]. A series of different CA combinations have been attempted 

to produce TE scaffolds [156-164], bone cements [165-168] and drug-delivery vehicles [170-172]. 

SCA and CA have been reinforced with HA and bioglasses in the perspective of generating composite 

structures with enhanced bioactivity [160, 161]. Moreover, the surface coating of SCA with a calcium 

phosphate (CaP) layer has been proposed as a surface modification technique to improve the surface 

bioactivity of SCA [159]. The compounding of SCA with nanosized HA, generates composite nanofibre 

meshes that improves the calcium deposition by the osteoblasts as demonstrated by Von Kossa 

staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity [160]. The microhardness of SCA immersed for 30 

days in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) decreases to, approximately, 94% of its initial value [156]; this 

variation was accompanied by a weight loss of 16% and a water uptake of 50%, being the highest 

variations compared to the starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) blend. It was reported by the authors that 

these variation has a more dramatic influence in the surface morphology and roughness, generating a 

negative impact in the osteoblast adhesion and proliferation.

In vivo studies were performed on the developed composites/blends showing the suitability of SCA-

based materials as TE scaffolds. SCA induced better biological response (through the formation of

(CaP) coated SEVA-C.

Boesel et al. [165-168] explored the use of SCA for the development of hydrophilic partially degradable 

bone cements. This set of studies used SCA has a filler of acrylic resins based on the combination of 

methylmethacrylate and acrylic acid. With the use of 55-60% of SCA the authors were able to produce a 

cement formulation that fulfills the requirements of the ASTM standard for acrylic bone cements [165]. 

The cement formulation was reinforced with bioactive glass compositions or HA and their mechanical 

behavior and bioactivity was significantly enhanced [166, 167]. 

CA phthalate-based formulations have been proposed as drug-delivery vehicles, for the controlled 

release of stimulants for bone formation (e.g. parathyroid hormone, simvastatin), and their efficiency 

has been proven both in vitro and in vivo [170-172].

Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and 

their silanized derivatives, has been proposed as a component for the preparation of injectable bone 

cements [174, 175, 177-181] and as 3D scaffolds for bone and cartilage regeneration [182-184]. In 

the bone cement formulations such materials are added at a percentage between 2 and 3% due to its 

gelification properties, being used as a carrier of the solid component, e.g. CaP phases. HPC has been 

reported to enhance bone formation when added to bone cement formulations [174]. HPMC is able to 

promote the formation of a crystalline CaP phase in the surface of biphasic CaP [179]. HPMC also 

proved to be non-cytotoxic in formulations of injectable hybrid bone cements, without altering the 

biological properties of the inorganic phase [180]. 

Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) reinforced with nano-sized HA has been tested as bionanocomposites 

[186] for bone regeneration in a TE approach. The addition of chitosan to these formulations was 

reported as a methodology to control the biodegradation rate of the composites [187]. Substitution 

materials for bone repair should have good biocompatibility and a suitable biodegradation rate, as well 

as higher mechanical properties to support the ingrowth of new bone tissue. Studies involving a tri-

component polyelectrolyte composite structure of chitosan and CMC with nano HA have demonstrated 

potential for that purpose [187, 188, 194].  In a first case using a co-solution method to produce the 

composites was possible to obtain a morphology and size similar to natural bone with improved 

compressive strength when compared to HA/chitosan based composites [188]. Combining nano HA 

with chitosan and cross-linking with CMC in a weight ratio (40/30/30) it was obtained an organic 

network structure of polyelectrolyte complexes with nanometer crystals of HA uniformly distributed. 

These structures presented a high compressive strength, acceptable biodegradation and high bioactivity 

[187]. Self-assembly of static electricity methodology was used to create polyelectrolyte complex 

membranes with similar compositions obtaining the previously improved mechanical, degradation, 

swelling and bioactivity characteristics. The combination of chitosan/CMC previously ionic cross-linked 

with 40 wt.% of nano HA presents a compressive strength near 120MPa that meets the requirement for 

bone repair material and can be used as biomimetic bone repair material [194]. 

Within the context of bionanocomposites, CNW has a largely unexploited potential within the biomedical 

field. Their high surface area to volume ratio may change drastically the properties of CNW through the 

manipulation of its surface chemistry [10]. One of the drawbacks of the CNW is its poor compatibility 

with nonpolar solvents or resins due to its hydrophilic nature [2], and the thermal degradation of the 

cellulosic components at high temperatures [121]; although, the presence of reactive hydroxyl groups

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

27 

enable a variety of chemical modifications mediated by organic solvents [130, 132], crosslinking agents 

[132, 195] or using surfactants [197]. 

The synthesis of BC in the presence of methylcellulose (MC) and CMC has been reported [191] to 

enhance the water adsorption capability of BC. MC was used in combination with the triblock co-

polymers P123 and F127 to generate mesopores and macropores in bioglass formulations developed 

as scaffolds for bone TE [192]. 

Svensson et al. [112] tested native and chemically modified BC as supports structures for cartilage TE. 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, and RNA expression of the collagen II from human 

chondrocytes seeded on the BC-based supports, indicated that unmodified BC induces the proliferation 

of chondrocytes. Moreover, it was observed by TEM the ingrowth of chondrocytes into the bulk of the 

BC scaffold. This work showed that BC is a promising material for the development of cartilage TE 

scaffolds. BC has been also modified with xyloglucan and RGD aminoacid sequence as a tool to 

promote endothelial cell adhesion. This strategy is highly relevant for bone TE in an attempt to promote 

vascularization [198]. 

Recently, Fillponen et al. [196] proposed the functionalization of cellulose through the adsorption of a 

surface layer of CMC modified with azide or alkyne moieties followed by a “click” chemistry strategy to 

functionalize the CMC surface with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or PEG. The authors report that this 

strategy can be also employed with other molecules, such as fluorescent dyes or other types of proteins. 

This methodology can be exploited in the biomedical field through the decoration of the cellulose 

surface with biochemical cues to induce different types of cellular responses. 

In contrast to cellulose-based materials, the lignin counterpart has not yet been significantly exploited in 

the biomedical field. However, its natural origin, and its abundance in renewable feedstocks motivated 

some attempts in recent years. 

Several chemical modifications on lignins are reported in the literature [28, 48, 55, 60, 199]; although, 

very few of them were already been tested in the preparation of materials with biological relevance 

within the field of bone and cartilage TE. However, Kraft lignin has been reinforced with HA and beta-

tricalcium phosphate (TCP) to produce composite structures for bone TE [193]. It was observed the 

formation of porosities between 50 and 100 µm upon sintering at 900 ºC. These pores were derived 

from the positions that lignin occupied before the thermal treatment and occur due to its degradation. 

The combination of conducting polymers with lignin can produce anti-oxidant materials capable of 

reducing the oxidative stress of the surrounding biological tissue. It has been shown that a combination

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

28 

of polyanyline (PANI), poly(anilinesulfonic acid) or polypyrrole (Ppy) with lignin generate materials with 

anti-oxidant capacity. These results lead the authors to suggested that this type of materials are relevant 

coatings of different polymeric scaffolds or biomedical implants with the capacity to reduce the foreign 

body response [200]. 

1.4.3 Pyrolised lignocellulosic structures 

Inspired by Nature and following a biomimetic approach, natural wood cellular structures have been 

selected to serve as a 3D porous scaffold for bone TE [98, 100, 201-203]. After appropriated material 

selection, including a characterization of the wood specie (balsa, oak, rattan, eucalyptus, pine, birch, 

among others), a development strategy was established through the controlled pyrolyzation (under inert 

atmosphere) of wood samples. This methodology produced a porous preform of carbon that is 

chemically infiltrated, generating a coated inner surface of the wood cell walls which gave rises to 

biomorphic oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, MnO and ZrO2) [204-208] or, alternatively, carbide phases (SiC, TiC 

and ZrC) [201, 209-211]. As an example, SiC structure is produced by the spontaneous reaction 

between molten infiltrated Si with the preform carbon to form SiC-based material. The result is a 

biomorphic SiC ceramic material (bioSiC) that replicates the highly interconnected microstructure of the 

wood cell wall [201, 203]. The biodiversity of natural wood offers a variety of morphologies and 

chemical compositions that can be exploited in the development of constructs relevant for the 

biomedical field. They have the potential to form structures with unique pore distributions, from the 

micro to nanometer scale. When developing this type of materials for biomedical applications it is 

relevant to analyze their osteointegration capacity and biocompatibility. In vitro bioactivity studies were 

performed by means of immersing these types of samples in SBF. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis 

(EDS) analysis confirmed the formation of a dense CaP layer, demonstrating that, coating the bioSiC 

with bioactive silicate glass it is possible to improve its osteoconducting properties [203]. Additionally, 

the culturing of human osteoblast-like cells in the presence of these materials demonstrated a cell 

proliferation rate similar to the positive controls without cytotoxicity response [212]. Additionally they 

have demonstrated good biomechanical performance [203, 213]. In vivo biocompatibility studies in the 

femur of rabbits were also performed. Histological results of a bioSiC construct after 12 weeks of 

implantation confirmed the existence of new bone within the bulk of the SiC porous matrix. Moreover, 

no tissue inflammation was detected in the surrounding tissue [213].

Recently it was proposed [202] a new process to transform the starting wood into a HA porous scaffold. 

After the decomposition of the wood organic components, the remaining structure was infiltrated with 

calcium vapor over the carbon structure to produce calcium carbide (CaC). Using a multi-step chemical 

and physical process, presented in the scheme of Figure 1.7, it was possible to convert the calcium 

carbide into a spongy carbonated HA scaffolds to act as artificial bone.

Rattan wood has a strong morphological similarity with bone (see Figure 1.8). This observation 

promoted the testing of Rattan-based scaffolds targeting bone TE. The developed structures are 

characterized to present a porosity of 85% and large pore sizes, 250 ± 40 µm. The constructs present 

channel-like pore system interconnected with smaller pores [202].  

In vivo tests carried out on skeletally mature, adult New Zealand White disease-free rabbits, confirmed 

the bioactivity and osteoconductivity of Rattan-derived biomorphic HA. Histological analysis confirmed 

the absence of inflammatory or histotoxic reactions. Additionally, the newly formed bone tissue (in the 

surface and bulk of the constructs) presented a regular architectural pattern surrounding the scaffolds 

without connective capsules or gaps [100].

1.5 Composite hydrogels from lignocellulosic materials 

Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks (3D) formed from hydrophilic homopolymers, copolymers, or 

macromers (preformed macromolecular chains) crosslinked to form insoluble polymer matrices [214]. 

In terms of materials requirements for regenerative medicine, hydrogels have received attention due to 

their intrinsic structural and compositional similarities to the ECM and their extensive framework for 

cellular proliferation and survival. Hydrogels are a class of biomaterials that have demonstrated great 

potential for biological and medical applications [22, 215-217]. These structures can absorb from 20% 

up to thousands of times their dry weight [216, 218]. They are highly relevant and appealing for 

biomedical applications since they usually are biocompatible, the aqueous environment of the hydrogel 

can protect cells and fragile drugs (such as peptides, proteins, etc.), they present good transport of 

nutrient to cells and metabolic products from the cells, they may be easily modified with cell adhesion 

ligands, or they can be injected in vivo as a liquid that gelifies at body temperature [216]. Usually they 

do not dissolve in water due to its permanent cross-linked network (chemical or physical). Some 

hydrogel systems have attracted significant attention in the biomedical field due to their stimuli-

responsive swelling-deswelling capabilities without disintegration, and their biocompatibility [23, 215, 

219]. Polysaccharides are one class of polymers that are able to form hydrogels that are highly 

hydrated and porous, being similar to living tissue. When implanted, these hydrophilic materials allow 

the permeation of water, metabolic products and chemical signals in the aqueous physiological 

environment [140]. Polysaccharides such as chitosan [64, 118, 220, 221], starch-based [222, 223],

gellan gum [17, 224, 225], hyaluronic acid [226-228] and alginate [50, 229] have been widely used to 

prepare natural hydrogels. They present the advantages of being biocompatible, biodegradable, low 

toxicity, and high availability from renewable resources [120, 219, 220]. The main areas in which 

hydrogels are used as biomaterials are in contact lenses, synthetic wound coverings, drug-delivery 

systems, permselective membranes, and in organ and tissue replacements, such as, skin, tendon, 

cartilage, heart valve stents, and bone [109]. Examples of the use of lignocellulosic-based hydrogels in 

the biomedical field, during the last decade, are presented in Table 1.5.

1.5.1 Cellulose-based materials 

Cellulose-based hydrogels are biocompatible and its modified systems may be considered 

biodegradable. Several water-soluble cellulose derivatives can be used as mono-component of multi-

component systems to form hydrogel networks possessing specific properties in terms of swelling 

capability and sensitivity to external stimuli [21]. They can be prepared from a cellulose solution 

through physical cross-linking. As it was pointed out before, cellulose has several hydroxyl moieties able 

to form an interlinked network stabilized by hydrogen bonding. However, it is usually difficult to dissolve 

cellulose in common solvents due to its highly extended hydrogen bonded structure, being one of the 

main challenges in the development of cellulose-based hydrogels. A recent work on cellulose hydrogels 

refers new solvents, such as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO), ionic liquids (ILs), and alkali/urea 

(or thiourea) aqueous systems that have been developed to dissolve cellulose, providing a set of new 

opportunities for the preparation of cellulose hydrogels [22]. The current trend in the design of 

cellulose-based hydrogels is associated to the use of non-toxic crosslinking agents or crosslinking 

chemical treatments, to further improve the safety of both the final product and the manufacturing 

process. 

BC was also used to prepare a nanostructured hydrogels for TE. BC has more than 200 times higher 

surface area than isolated softwood cellulose. Compared with cellulose from plants, BC possesses 

higher water holding capacity, higher crystallinity, higher tensile strength, and a finer web-like network 

[141, 185].   

Hutchens et al. [140] have used BC hydrogels as templates to form biomimetic calcium-deficient 

hydroxyapatite (CdHA). After the purification process, the cellulose was incubated in solutions of 

calcium chloride followed by dibasic sodium phosphate. An amount of apatite higher than 50% of total 

dry weight was incorporated throughout the hydrogel. Their results indicate that CdHA spherical clusters 

(1mm) are composed by nanosized crystallites that were formed inside the BC network. The formation 

of this bionanocomposite is similar to the physiological biomineralization of bone producing apatite

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

34 

crystals of comparable shape and size. XRD analysis showed that the CdHA is comprised of anisotropic 

10–50 nm elongated crystallites mimicking the geometry of bone apatite crystals. Combining the 

biocompatibility of BC with the bioactivity of CdHA, these bionanocomposites are promising materials to 

be used as scaffold for bone TE [235]. It was also observed that the CdHA implants are rapidly 

incorporated into the bone tissue due to its high biocompatibility and strong bioactivity [140]. 

Millon et al. [109, 245] have considered hydrophilic BC fibers combined with PVA to form a 

bionanocomposite that mimic the role of collagen and elastin, respectively. Their main objective was to 

evaluate its use as cardiovascular tissue replacements. More recently, Mohammadi [246] presented a 

novel technique to exploit the anisotropy and the non-linear mechanical properties of BC-PVA hydrogels 

in the development of heart valves. Hydrogels based on BC-PVA were prepared for cornea replacement, 

due to their high water content, high visible light transmittance, suitable UV absorbance, high 

mechanical strength and appropriated thermal properties [247]. However these systems require further 

improvements before being tested under clinical applications.  

After the discovery that electrical signals can regulate cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, 

researchers sought to incorporate conducting polymers into biomaterials to take advantage of the 

electrical stimuli [256]. Polyaniline (PAni) is a conductive electroactive polymer, where the reaction time 

of polymerization, the type and concentration of doping acids plays the main role in the electro-

conductivity properties of the composites. BC-PAni nanofiber composite is an electro-conductive 

hydrogel that combines the properties of hydrogels and conductive systems [248]. The study showed 

that PAni could be synthesized on the surface of BC nanofibers and assembled into a novel 3D 

membrane structure, enhancing considerably the composite electroconductivity.  The nanocomposites 

may potentially be used for flexible displays, biosensors, and platform substrates to study the effect of 

electrical signals on cell activity or to direct desirable cell function in TE applications. 

Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs), consist of a combination of two or more polymer networks 

synthesized in juxtaposition, i.e. a blend of two or more cross-linked polymers, which may be 

incompatible, but are physically interlocked, forming a 3D structure between its constituent phases 

[257]. IPNs can be divided into two specific forms [17, 22]: sequential IPN and semi-IPN. In the case of 

sequential IPN, cellulose is used as the first network and the second network is synthesized by 

polymerization in the presence of the cellulose network. When cellulose or its derivative is linear or 

branched in a cross-linked network, it is called as semi-IPN hydrogel [22]. In the biomedical field, high 

mechanical strength double-network (DN) hydrogels, combining BC and gelatin, has been prepared by 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

35 

Gong and coworkers [17]. Gelatin is a polypeptide derived from collagen, one of the main constituents 

of the ECM. A BC-gelatin system in the form of a gel can retain water and recover consecutively from 

compression [22]. The authors have prepared BC-gelatin hydrogels by immersing BC gel in aqueous 

gelatin solution, followed by cross-linking with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide 

hydrochloride (EDC), generating a sequential IPN hydrogel. The tensile strength of the DN hydrogel 

along the direction of the stratified layer and the compressive strength in the direction perpendicular to 

the stratified layer was about 112 times and 31 times higher than that of gelatin gels, respectively. A 

similar enhancement on the mechanical strength was reported for the combination of BC with other 

polysaccharides such as sodium alginate, gellan gum and carrageenan [17]. Moreover, these hydrogels 

present a low friction coefficient of the order of 10-3 and potential to be used as artificial cartilage. 

1.5.2 Modified cellulose-based materials 

Cellulose derivatives can be tuned to produce hydrogel structures, either reversible or stable, through 

their covalent cross-linking using aqueous solutions of cellulose ethers, such as, methylcellulose (MC), 

hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) 

[258]. 

HPC and its chemical derivatives have been proposed as smart responsive materials [29] for drug-

delivery applications [29, 173]. Its use as an oral administration vehicle with thermo- and pH-responsive 

capacity has been reported, showing stability at acidic pH and enhanced degradation rate at neutral pH. 

Additionally, the HPC hydrogels reduce their swelling rate with increasing temperature [29]. HPC was 

recently tested in a phase II clinical trial for the controlled release of FGF-2 targeting periodontal bone 

regeneration in patients diagnosed with periodontitis. The results showed a significant increase in the 

alveolar bone height, which was used by the authors as an argument to prove that these delivery 

systems in combination with FGF-2 stimulate bone regeneration [174]. A delay in the delivery of 

gentamicin from CaP bone cements was proposed by the addition of HPC to the formulation [176]. 

The delivery of cells using a noninvasive surgery can be achieved using injectable scaffolds [183]; 

although, the desired cell-based construct has to be retained at the repair site after being injected. 

Considering these requirements, some strategies were developed using a hydrophilic polymer able to 

exhibit self-reticulation properties in order to promote the mechanical integrity of the gel phase.  

HPMC grafted with silanol groups (Si-HPMC) is a self-hardening gel at the physiological pH and has 

been proposed to promote cartilage and bone regeneration [182, 183] also as injectable systems [184, 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

36 

259]. Si-HPMC hydrogels have been also proposed as injectable bone cements for the treatment of 

periodontal defects, with the advantage of being able to promote new bone formation 3 months after in 

vivo implantation. Additionally, it was reported that Si-HPMC promotes the fixation of the inorganic 

phase in the intervention area [181]. Vinatier et al. [184], proposed Si-HPMC hydrogels as TE supports 

capable of promoting chondrocyte proliferation. The study reported that chondrocytes were 

metabolically active, and were able to produce glycosaminoglycans. Overall, it was concluded that Si-

HPMC is a promising material for cartilage TE. More recently, it was proposed an injectable therapeutic 

strategy for the regeneration of articular cartilage using autologous rabbit nasal chondrocytes (RNC) 

with Si-HPMC hydrogel [241]. The use of nasal chondrocytes presents the advantages of reducing 

donor site morbidity while exhibiting greater chondrogenic potential than articular chondrocytes [260]. 

After 6 weeks of in vitro studies, histological analysis of autologous RNC transplanted in an articular 

cartilage defect revealed the formation of new cartilage tissue with a histological organization similar to 

that of healthy articular cartilage. Moreover, immunohistological analysis of type II collagen suggested 

that the new tissue was a hyaline-like cartilage [241]. 

Orthopedic devices made from biodegradable materials present advantages over metal or 

nondegradable materials since they can transfer stress over time to the damaged area as it heals, and 

there is no need of a second surgery to remove the implanted devices [256]. Cellulose phosphate (CP) 

has been investigated as a biomaterial for orthopedic applications to improve the osseointegration of 

cellulose. Granja et al. [231, 261] have studied the phosphorylation of regenerated cellulose hydrogels 

using MCC. Their work assessed the mineralization potential of CP, i.e. the ability of a material to 

induce the formation of an apatite layer in a SBF, revealing that only the Ca salt of CP promoted 

formation of apatite. It was reported that the interface between the polymer and the mineral layer was 

continuous [231]. Moreover, moderate degrees of surface phosphorylation were able to induce 

mineralization. 

In a different work, the pre-incubation of unmodified regenerated cellulose hydrogels with Ca resulted in 

the formation of a homogeneous apatite layer. However, in this case, the interface between the polymer 

and the mineral layer was not continuous [234, 262].  

Granja et al. [230, 232, 233] also studied the biocompatibility of CP under in vitro and in vivo 

conditions. Their in vitro biocompatibility was studied in cultures of human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells 

(hBMSC), showing that CP is not cytotoxic, independently of the phosphate content [233, 262]. In 

another in vitro study, it was reported that regenerated cellulose hydrogels showed good rates of 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

37 

hBMSC proliferation after 22 days in culture and it was observed an homogeneous colonizatrion of the 

surface of the materials [232].  It is important to indicate that these structures without cells do not 

mineralize. Animal implantation studies were performed in rabbits and the results revealed that both 

unmodified and phosphorylated cellulose were biocompatible and reveal osteoconductive properties 

[230]. A complete osseointegration was not observed, although some remodeling activity of the bone 

tissue was referred when CP was used. These works showed that regenerated cellulose hydrogels 

presented potential to be applied in different orthopedic applications. 

CMC hydrogels have been also tested for the containment of the inorganic phases in CaP bone 

cements. They presented degradation between 50 to 60% at the second week of experiment and no 

negative impact in the bioactivity of CaP. CMC-CaP formulations possess osteoinductive properties, 

allowing the formation of ectopic bone at the same level as the CMC-free CaP [50]. The coating of 

cellulose-based scaffolds with CMC induces the formation of CaP crystalline phases on their surface 

[162, 189], therefore promoting bioactivity. More recently, polyelectrolyte complexes composed by CMC, 

chitosan and polyglutamic acid presented significant antibacterial properties and limited in vivo foreign 

body response [190]. Additionally, polyelectrolyte hydrogels present a high sensitivity to their sorption 

capacity. This can be manipulated by varying the ionic strength and pH of the external solutions [21, 

239]. 

The smart behavior of some cellulose derivatives, such as, NaCMC and HPMC, in response to 

physiologically variables (i.e., pH, temperature, ionic strength) makes the lignocellulosic-based 

hydrogels appealing for in vivo applications in the field of TERM. Recently, Eyholzer et al. [217] have 

demonstrated the potential of nanofibrillated CMC in the preparation of hydrogels for the replacement of 

nucleus pulposus in intervertebral discs. The methodology consisted in the UV polymerization of N-vinyl-

2-pyrrolidone in a suspension of nanofibrillated CMC, using Tween 20 trimethacrylate as cross-linking 

agent. The results of the study showed that the developed hydrogels could successfully mimic the 

mechanical and swelling behavior of the nucleous pulposus. 

1.5.3 Hemicellulose and modified hemicellulose-based materials 

Hemicelluloses present sufficient hydrophilic functional groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl) on their 

backbones to act as reactive sites for chemical modification. They are widely available feedstocks and 

confer relevant properties to their corresponding hydrogels, e.g. renewability, biodegradability and 

biocompatibility [23]. Recently Albertsson et al. [251] presented a new method to prepare hydrogels 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

38 

from chemically modified hemicelluloses. The procedure used a freeze-dried hemicellulose rich fraction 

and can be described as a three-step procedure: (1) the synthesis of cross-linkable precursors by 

activating 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI); (2) the covalent 

attachment of the cross-linkable precursor to the polysaccharide backbones (DMSO); and (3) cross-

linking the hydrogels through the reaction between the HEMA-modified hemicellulose and free HEMA 

molecules. The developed hydrogels presented a swelling that is greatly dependent on the degree of 

HEMA substitution and the co-monomer to hemicellulose ratio. Swelling was found to reduce with 

increasing HEMA substitution degree [23]. The main drawback of this methodology is related to the 

high cost derived from the synthesis of the intermediate precursors. 

Galactoglucomannan (GGM) is the main hemicellulose in Norway Spruce (Picea abies), the most 

common raw material used in the thermochemical mills in Scandinavia. It can be used isolated after an 

established procedure involving microfiltration [249]. O-acetyl-GGM (AcGGM) is the major softwood 

hemicellulose, and the synthesis of AcGGM hydrogels can be achieved by chemical grafting of acrylates 

and their subsequent cross-linking. BSA was encapsulated into HEMA-grafted AcGGM hydrogels, and its 

release was studied as a function of the HEMA grafting degree and of the addition ?-mannanase to 

hydrolyze the hydrogel. The hydrogel preparation procedure involved the enzymatic modification of the 

AcGGM chains and synthetic coupling of HEMA. Two parameters were found to influence the release of 

BSA in water: the degree of substitution of HEMA and the presence of ?-mannanase [250]. While lower 

release of BSA occurred for an HEMA grafting degree between 0.10 and 0.36, the presence of ?-

mannanase increased the BSA release. This study demonstrated the potential of HEMA grafted AcGGM 

hydrogels as drug delivery vehicles. 

Hydrogels usually exhibits low mechanical resistance; therefore, a significant effort has been made to 

develop hydrogel reinforcement strategies that do not compromise their water absorption capacity. A 

type of strategy already mentioned for the cellulose-based hydrogels is the assembling of IPNs or semi-

IPNs. These strategies can produce hydrogels with enhanced mechanical performance [23]. Hydrogels 

based on semi-IPN of hemicellulose and chitosan have been investigated [220]. A recent work [23] 

reviews two distinct routes to prepare hydrogels based on semi-IPN of hemicellulose and chitosan. The 

first method is based on the mixing of two different solutions, of hemicellulose and chitosan, and 

subsequent cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The second method consists in mixing hemicellulose with 

chitosan in the dry form and then dissolving the mixture in acidified water. A recent work performed by 

Karaaslan et al., [220] using the first method, produced hydrogel films based on semi-IPN with high 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

39 

molecular weight hemicellulose and chitosan. The resulting hydrogel presented a pH-responsive drug 

delivery using riboflavin as a model active agent. These results demonstrated that hemicellulose-based 

hydrogels are capable to crystallize in the presence of 50 wt% of chitosan, acting as reinforcement 

component within the semi-IPN structure. Additionally higher swelling ratios were observed with the 

increase of hemicellulose content due to the lower degree of crosslinking and higher hydrophylicity [23, 

220]. 

1.5.4 Lignin-based materials 

The incorporation of lignin can lead to an increase on the thermal stability, hydrophilicity, 

biocompatibility and biodegradability of hydrogels [95]. Similar to the hemicellulose, lignin-based 

molecules can be used in semi-IPN hydrogels. A recent work [95] reports the development of 

superabsorbent hydrogels based on different types of lignin. These materials are semi-IPN hydrogels 

with structures between lignin and xanthan gum, an anionic extracellular bacterial polysaccharide 

known to be biocompatible, biodegradable and to exhibit gel-like properties. These lignin-based semi-

IPN hydrogels are prepared by a crosslinking reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by intensive 

washing to remove the unreacted crosslinking agent. The methodology leads to a biodegradable 

superabsorbent hydrogel with high swelling rate in aqueous media. The study revealed that the nature 

of lignin influences the thermo-oxidative stability and the swelling properties of the hydrogels. 

The performance of the lignin based gels could be improved by means of a chemical modification of the 

starting lignin [23]. As an example lignin hydrogels can be prepared by crosslinking it with polyethylene 

glycol diglycidyl ether [254]. The lignin-based hydrogels swells in water: ethanol mixtures and in alkaline 

solutions, and they shrink upon heating. The swelling properties of such materials are attributable to 

lignin. This study was not developed in a biomedical perspective, although, the results confirm that 

lignin-based hydrogels have a large unexploited potential for the development of drug delivery systems. 

Lignin has been also used in the development of a thermo-responsive hydrogel [255]. These “smart” 

materials have the ability to respond to temperature changes, modifying their gelling behavior [263]. 

Thermo-responsive lignin-based hydrogel were developed by Feng et al. [255]. This was achieved by 

reaction between acetic acid lignin with NIPA, generating NIPA-g-lignin. The developed material 

presented a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 31 ºC with tunable pore sizes (between 20 

and 100 µm) that is dependent on the percentage of lignin fraction.

1.6 Some recent applications in the biomedical field 

With the rapid diminishment of oil resources and serious environmental pollution caused by the refining 

of petrochemical products, alternative and sustainable resources have attracted a growing interest 

among researchers. The increase of knowledge on the lignocellulosic components acted as a leverage 

on its use as composites in the biomedical field. 

Wound dressing systems based on pure oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) have been developed 

such as Tabotamp® and as well as a mixture from collagen and ORC named Promogran®. Tabotamp® is 

a thin gauze layer from pure ORC that is used in acute wounds like trauma, surgical injuries and burns. 

It provides hemostatic and antimicrobial properties [264]. Collagen is recognized as the major 

component of the ECM and serves as a natural substrate for cell attachment, proliferation and 

differentiation.  Collagen has been employed as a matrix material for TE and wound dressing [265]. 

Promogran®, is a commercial spongy collagen matrix (55%) containing ORC (45%) that has been 

recently introduced in the US and European markets for the treatment of exuding diabetic and ulcer 

wounds [265, 266]. This product is a dressing consisting of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix and combines 

the properties of its components, such as fluid absorption and haemostatic properties.  

BC in the form of membranes has been applied for guided bone regeneration in: bone defects of critical 

and noncritical size [125]; in periodontal lesions [181]; and as a resorbable barrier membrane for 

preventing the invasion of fibroblast cells and fibrous connective tissue into the bone defects [123]. 

Results from the literature indicate that BC membranes promote effective bone formation at the site, 

besides being a low-cost treatment [125, 267, 268].  

The current trend in the design of cellulose-based hydrogels is related to the use of non-toxic 

crosslinking agents or crosslinking treatments, to further improve the safety of both the final product 

and the manufacturing process [21]. Hydrogels are considered optimum candidates to be used in 

wound dressings. In this sense hydrogels should be designed to maintain the appropriated moisture in 

the wound; relieve the pain, not adhere to the wound; and conform to the body shape [269]. Several 

systems based on natural or synthetic solutions are patented [270-272] or on the market [273, 274] 

offering additional characteristics, including non-adherent dressings or systems comprising 

antimicrobial agents in their formulations. Several of the hydrogels applied on wound dressing present 

water content between 70 and 95%. The most cited commercially available hydrogels designed as

wound dressing systems are listed in Table 1.6, including examples from the literature [21, 139, 140,

Several natural and synthetic wound dressings have been developed; however the search for an ideal 

wound dressing is still in progress. Some commercial products use silver particles on the hydrogel 

composition to confer antimicrobial activity. After approval from the Food and Drug Administration,

Xylos Corporation (USA) is commercializing a skin substitute based on BC (XCell). This material it 

referred to maintain the moisture balance in the wound and to speed up healing and epithelialization 

[140, 274]. BC has been widely investigated for wound healing due to its purity and high water 

retention capacity, and a series of BC-based wound dressings are currently on the market. Their 

potential as wound dressing has been reviewed by Czaja et al. [20, 139]. BC has been used in cartilage 

TE [112, 276], replacement of blood vessels in rats [16] and in wound healing processes [20, 139]. 

Hydrogels based on BNC mimic basic living processes and are of growing importance as bioactive 

scaffolds.  

From the large number of different cellulose derivatives, HPMC is the one that has been more 

commercially exploited as a pharmaceutical excipient and as vehicle for controlled drug delivery. The 

polymer molecular weight (Mw) is of significant importance due to its intimate relation with the delivery 

profile of the loaded drug. In this sense, by controlling the polymer Mw it is possible to adapt the drug-

release profile to the required timeframe and rate. This strategy has been recently reported in the new 

line of BenecelTM (Ashland Inc.) commercial HPMC excipients [273]. 

1.7 Concluding remarks and future trends 

The development of scaffolds that mimic the architecture of tissue at the nanoscale is one of the major 

challenges in the field of TE in the last 15 years. The development of nanofibers, has greatly enhanced 

the scope for fabricating scaffolds that can potentially meet this challenge. Agricultural fibers represent 

an abundant, inexpensive, and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic components that 

can be used integrated in a biorefinery process.  

Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth, which is an almost inexhaustible source of 

raw material for the increasing demand for environmentally friendly and biocompatible products. 

Therefore, cellulose based materials have become one of the most important bioresources in the 21st 

century. This increasing relevance induced the investment on bionanocomposites research targeting 

biomedical purposes. This also includes its purified, modified or biodegradable constituents that are 

used as matrix or nano-reinforcements. 

A relevant, and still unexplored, component of plants is suberin. Its general chemical structure is 

polyester-based, one of the most common type of FDA-approved synthetic biomaterial, e.g. PLA, PLGA, 

etc. Usually, these FDA-approved synthetic polyesters used in the development of biomedical materials 

are hydrophobic. Additionally, the chemical characterization of suberin structure has shown the 



Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field 

 

43 

presence of a high concentration of hydroxyl moieties [96]. This feature can be used as an added value 

due to the possibility of synthesizing suberin-based polyester structures with pendant hydroxyl groups 

that promotes some hydrophilicity [74]. Suberin or chemical modified suberin from bark was already 

applied in composites to promote adhesion between the phases and to enhance their mechanical 

performance [277]. It is envisaged a large spectrum of possible applications for these structures, 

although, polymerization studies need to be executed to understand the real potential of suberin-based 

polymeric structures in the biomedical area. Under the current environmental, societal and political 

status there is a pressing need for innovative, sustainable and recyclable materials. Figure 1.9 presents

Chapter 1 – Bionanocomposites from lignocellulosic resources: properties, applications and future 

trends for their use in the biomedical field

A significant effort is under way to match the properties of the lignocellulosic materials with the ones 

required for specific applications. In the field of TE it is relevant to mention that research is evolving by 

improving the mechanical resistance of the lignocellulosic-based constructs, namely, by applying 

different types of nano-reinforcements, e.g. HA or the different CaP phases; although, there are other 

properties that the materials should match, namely, biocompatibility, bioactivity, degradability (if a 

regenerative approach is targeted), among many others. 

As it was pointed out in this review, materials with a hierarchical structure, such as wood, provide a 

design strategy within the development of biomaterials. This biomimetic approach exploits the micro to 

nanoscale organization of the wood porous structure to design nanostructured materials with enhanced 

mechanical, chemical and biological properties. Additionally, the alternation of fiber bundles and 

channel-like porous areas also makes wood a material of choice to be used as a template in starting the 

development of new bone substitutes. In particular, some of the wood-derived structures were already 

tested as bioinert bone scaffolds [100, 213]. In this area more biological knowledge in terms of in vitro 

studies will be required to understand the potential of these structures, as well as, more investment is 

needed for the in vivo tests involving large animals.  

The current trend in the design of cellulose-based hydrogels is related to safety improvement issues, 

namely in the development of non-toxic crosslinking agents/treatments. It is expected that the origin of 

the lignocellulosic component will induce some differences in terms of swelling, chemistry, among 

others. These variations influence the behavior of the biomaterial. In this field it is expected the 

development of new approaches for modifying and crosslinking hemicellulose and lignin in order to 

improve the mechanical strength and adsorption capacity of their respective hydrogels.  

These new formulations are expected to present controllable physical properties that can be matched to 

address the specific biological and medical challenges. These developments will allow the formulation 

of, for example, novel injectable materials for non-invasive surgical procedures, presenting suitability 

mechanical and biological properties. Hydrogels applied within TE should be capable to provide 

adequate mechanical properties, as well as the biochemical cues to promote tissue regeneration. The 

nanoscale structuring of these hydrogels, such as, pore size and controlled degradation rate must be 

optimized. In the future, the incorporation of modified functional hydrogels from plant-based polymers 

into micro-devices will contribute to improve and provide new routes for fabricating enhanced TE based 

systems with efficient in vivo performance.

In drug delivery, the development of “smart” responsive bionanocomposites that can respond to 

changes in their surrounding environments will provide for new and improved methods of delivering 

molecules for therapeutic applications. The use of lignocellulosic components in drug-delivery systems 

is studied for several years [175, 218, 220, 278]. Additionally, the use of cellulose derivatives as 

excipients in drug formulations is already a standard in the pharmaceutical industry [273]. In the future 

it is expectable the appearance of commercial formulations that are able to control the release rate and 

timeframe of different drugs. These systems can be combined with biomedical devices typically used for 

bone and cartilage TE (e.g. bone cements). 

As schematically presented in Figure 1.9, it will be necessary to attract the industry to this growing 

market opportunity capable of creating sustainable technological improvements in bionanocomposites. 

The successful exploitation of these biomedical markets requires the commitment and interaction 

between industry and scientists. 

It is expected a growing interest in the development of bionanocomposite structures based on 

lignocellulosic materials that target the biomedical field. The positive results obtained within the 

academic activity with the proposed strategies to enhance the performance of the bionanocomposites 

will contribute to sustain these market developments. In this sense, it is important to validate: the most 

sustainable supplies of lignocellulosic materials; and the origins that present a more stable composition, 

better properties and lower variability. In addition, it is also relevant to create mechanisms to conduct to 

the certification of these nanostructured biomaterials according to common methods and standards.

 Materials and methods 

The main focus of this chapter is to describe in more detail the materials used, the experimental 

techniques and the characterization methodologies employed that allowed to obtained results presented 

in this thesis. Along with Chapter I and to the introductions of each chapter, it aims to be a guideline of 

the rationale for this research, namely on the aspects related with the selection of the materials, on the 

processing routes used, and characterization methodologies adopted. 

2.1 Materials 

2.1.1 Cork and cork by-products 

Cork oak produces three qualities of suberose tissue: “virgin cork”, “secundaria” and “reproduction 

cork”, corresponding to the first, second and subsequent debarks [1]. The first cork is used only for 

agglomerates, the second can be used to extract stoppers but with high production of disposals, the 

third and subsequent extractions produce regular cork tissue which is proper for stopper fabrication [2-

4].  Industrial transformation of cork generates up to 25 wt.% of cork dust as by-product [2]. Figure 2.1, 

shows the four classes of cork-by products used in this thesis. It was used “amadia” cork in the powder 

and granulated cork. Moreover, different cork by-products obtained from the industrial cork process 

were also studied and the principal characteristics are provide below.

? Cork 

The materials used in the thesis were cork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1 mm and 

specific weight of 166 ± 21 kg.m-3, moisture content of ~7.5 % and a cork powder, with an average 

particle size &amp;lt;500 µm, a specific weight of 157 ± 2 kg.m-3 and moisture content of ~5.4% were both 

supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio Oleiros, Portugal).  

 

? Cork by-products 

It was collected different cork powders obtained from the industrial cork process as a by-products being 

the qualities designed by grinding powder,  sanding/external powder, Corkstyle® powder and floating 

powder provide from Amorim Revestimentos, S.A. (Portugal). These powders are present in Figure 2.1 

and a small description of the principal characteristics is providing below. Since the sanding powder 

and the external powder are very similar, a mixture of the referred powders was used in the present 

thesis. 

 

Grinding powder was the one with higher specific weight. This powder is characterized by presenting a 

dark brown colour due to the fact that it consists mainly of the outer bark, denser and very similar to 

wood. Moreover, this powder presents contaminations with silica from the sandpaper, resins, varnish 

and paint pigments due to the incorporation of materials for recycling. This waste was also the one with 

the highest moisture content. 

Sanding/external powder is the powder with lowest specific weight and lower range of particle size. This 

kind of powder is mainly composed of cork particles of good quality and low density that can be 

obtained from the cork stopper waste. It may also present some contaminations with resins from the 

agglomeration glues and glue from the decorative process and some silica from the sandpaper but in 

very low amounts.  

Corkstyle® powder is composed of high density fibreboard (HDF) formed during the machining process 

of the dock and cork, with a greater amount of HDF powder. The density is very similar compared with 

the floating powder. 

Floating powder consists of cork and HDF particles. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles are also presents 

in small amounts. Some varnish, paint pigments, resin and sinter bonding motifs may be present.

2.1.2 Natural fibre boards 

Commercial well established underlayment materials used in this work such as, medium density 

fibreboard (MDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF) with 6 mm of thickness from Sonae Industria, were 

used as control to compare the advantages and disadvantages with the developed cork-polymer (50-50) 

wt.% composites. 

MDF (brown) and HDF (green) is a dry-formed panel product manufactured from lignocellulosic fibres 

combined with a synthetic resin such as urea formaldehyde resin (UF), phenol formaldehyde resin (PF) 

or isocyanate binder under heat and pressure in the presence of moisture [5]. Formaldehyde is an 

organic compound and is part of the aldehyde family and is part of the volatile organic compound (VOC) 

family. The main source of formaldehyde inside of buildings is in wood agglomerates, used frequently 

as a construction material and in furniture. All these agglomerates containing formaldehyde are subject 

to European standards (EN 120, EN 312-1, EN 662-1) which aim to regulate and control the maximum 

concentration of formaldehyde. 

2.1.3 Natural fibres 

Biofibres offer several advantages over the traditional ones, the most important are low density and low 

cost, good specific strength properties, nonabrasive during processing, CO2 neutral when burned and 

biodegradability [6-8]. The most efficient natural fibres have been considered those that have high 

cellulose content coupled with a low microfibrile angle, resulting in high mechanical properties of the 

fibre [8]. Depending of the natural origin there are six basic types of natural fibers. They are classified 

as follows: bast fibers (jute, flax, hemp, ramie and kenaf), leaf fibers (abaca, sisal and pineapple), seed 

fibers (coir, cotton and kapok), core fibers (kenaf, hemp and jute), grass and reed fibers (wheat, corn 

and rice) and all other types (wood and roots) [9]. 

In this thesis it was used coconut fibre (coir) from fruit and sisal from leaf origin. Moreover, it was also 

test short wood fibre and the results are reported in the appendix section, regarding the patent of the 

reinforce cork-polymer composites with natural fibres. 

 

 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

72 

2.1.3.1 Sisal fibre 

Sisal is a hard fibre is obtained from the leaves of an annually harvested plant, called Agave sisalana 

and is commercially produced in Brazil and East Africa [9, 10]. Chemically sisal is mainly composed by 

65 wt.% of cellulose, 12 wt.% of hemicellulose, 9.9 wt.% of lignin and 2 wt.% of waxes [9]. Sisal fibre is 

one of the most widely used natural fibres and accounts for almost half the total production of natural 

fibres [11]. The hydroxyl groups which occur throughout the structure of natural fibres make them 

hydrophilic, but many polymer matrices are hydrophobic so that natural fibre-polymer composites have 

poor interfaces. Moreover, the hydrophilic sisal fibres absorb a large amount of water in the composite 

leading to failure by delamination. Adequate adhesion across the interface can be achieved at desirable 

levels by better wetting and chemical bonding between fibre and matrix [7, 10, 11]. To improve fibre-

matrix adhesion chemical treatment of sisal fibre was employed and will be further indicated. The sisal 

fibre used in the thesis was from Madagascar, presents a diameter of 183 ± 35 ?m and moisture 

content of ~11.3 %. The samples were randomly and gently isolated from the fibre bundles. All isolated 

fibres were re-conditioned at 20-22ºC and 60% relative humidity before use. 

2.1.3.2 Coconut fibre 

Coir is a hard fiber found between the hard inner shell and the outer coat of coconuts, which grow 

extensively in tropic and subtropic regions of the world [7]. Chemically coir is mainly composed by 32 to 

43 wt.% of cellulose, 0.15 to 0.25 wt.% of hemicellulose and 40 to 45 wt.% of lignin [9]. Coir is a cheap 

fiber, even cheaper than sisal [11, 12]. Coir as natural reinforcing in polymeric matrices presents 

inferior performance due to several factors such as its low cellulose content, high lignin content, high 

microfibrillar angle and large variable diameter [11]. There are two types of coir, a white fiber derived 

from harvesting coconuts before they are ripe, and a coarser brown fiber derived from harvesting 

coconuts after they have ripened. Between the two, coir fiber production worldwide is calculated to be 

roughly 250,000 tons. While the fiber is considered a poor reinforcing fibre because of its low strength 

and modulus, it has found interest due to its low density, low thermal conductivity and high elongation 

[7]. The brown coconut fibre used in the work was from Hayleys Exports PLC (Kotugoda, Srí Lanka) 

presented a diameter of 277.4 ± 38.8 µm, a humidity of 8.2 % and specific weight of 845.1 ± 46.6 Kg 

m-3, was collected at Amorim Isolamentos S.A. (Vendas Novas, Portugal). The samples were randomly 

and gently isolated from the fibre bundles. All isolated fibres were re-conditioned at 20-22ºC and 60%

relative humidity before use. No pre cleaning treatment was used to the fibres (e.g. soaked in distilled 

water for a period of time under a normal indoor environment). 

2.1.4 Polyolefins 

Polyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are two of the most commonly used polymers 

with wide range of applications. They are normally defined as polymers based on alkene-1 monomers 

or ?-olefins, and are the most widely used group of thermoplastic polymers today. Based on their 

monomeric units and their chain structures, they can be divided into the following subgroups [13]: 

Ethylene-based materials – polyethylenes (PEs) – produced under low pressure conditions with 

transition metal catalysts of various types and showing a predominantly linear chain structure. This 

subgroup includes high density PE (HDPE), medium density PE (MDPE), linear-low density PE (LLDPE) 

and other varieties, which are distinguished through the regulation of density and subsequently 

mechanical properties through the incorporation of higher ?-olefins (mostly butene, hexene and octene) 

as comonomers.  

Another subgroup is the propylene-based polymers produced with transition-metal catalysts - 

polypropylene (PP) and its copolymers - showing a linear chain structure with stereospecific 

arrangement of the propylene units. A wide variation of material properties can be achieved with the 

incorporation of ethylene and/or higher ?-olefins in various fashions; single-phase and multiphase 

materials are possible.Table 2.1 presents the repeat structure and principal properties of both selected 

polyolefins used in the thesis.

Polyolefins are one of the preferred choices among the commercial polymers because of their excellent 

combination of chemical and physical properties along with the low cost, superior processability and 

good recyclability [15]. 

2.1.4.1 High-densitt polyethylene (HDPE) 

Polyethylene (PE) is conventionally synthesized by following either low-pressure or high-pressure 

polymerization, the products of which differ markedly in properties. Polymerization at high pressure 

leads to branched chains and the polymer has a low density 0.915 – 0.935 g.cm-3 with cristallinity 

between 40% and 50%. On the other hand, when ethylene is polymerized at low pressure, the chain 

branching is eliminated. The resulting material has a crystallinity of 60% - 80% and a density of 0.95 – 

0.965 g.cm-3 [16]. The density and modulus of polyethylene increase with crystallinity. The repeat 

structure of PE is written as (– CH2CH2 –)n, and is shown in Table 2.1. Properties of PE depend on: 

molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, as well as on the degree and type of branching [17]. 

Polyethylene, like, polypropylene, has many good properties, which make it a material of choice for a 

number of applications  and owing to this reason, the composites of polyethylene are continuously 

studied to expand the number of applications. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) exhibits good thermal 

stability, water vapour barrier (nonpolar), low glass transition temperature and high crystallinity, which 

make it suitable for instance in packaging frozen foods. Moreover is not is not attacked by most acids, 

bases, or solvents [16]. Since HDPE is relatively inert it is difficult to achieve good interfacial adhesion 

in composites. Often maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene is added to HDPE to improve interfacial 

adhesion to the reinforcing fibres [18]. In this thesis, it was used a high density polyethylene (HMA – 

025), HDPE, with a MFI of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), supplied by ExxonMobil™ (Germany). The 

melt flow index was carried out according to ISO 1133 [19]. 

2.1.4.2 Polypropylene (PP) 

Polypropylene is a linear hydrocarbon and the presence of a methyl group attached to alternate carbon 

atoms on the chain backbone can alter the properties of PP (see Table 2.1) as compared with the PE in 

different ways. The first effect leads to an increase in the crystalline melting point. Some aspects of 

chemical behaviour are also affected by the methyl group, for instance the ternary carbon atom 

provides a site for oxidation causing PP to be less stable than PE to the influence of oxygen. The most 

significant influence of the methyl group is its generation of different tacticity in the products, ranging

from the completely isotactic and syndiotactic structures to atactic molecules. The properties of the 

polymer depend on the size and type of crystal structure formed, which in turn is dependent on the size 

and type of crystal growth. The ratio of these two rates can be controlled by varying the rate of cooling 

and by incorporation of nucleating agents. In general, the smaller the crystal structures, the greater the 

transparency and flex resistance and lesser rigidity and heat resistance. PP has a number of 

advantages, such as low density (0.90 g.cm-3) and low cost. It has a higher softening point and hence a 

maximum service temperature and dimensional stability [16]. Moreover and since polypropylene is 

nonpolar, it absorbs very little water. Due to its Tg below room temperature, it exhibits good impact 

strength [18]. In this thesis, it was selected a polypropylene homopolymer (1374 E2), PP, with a MFI of 

20.8 g.10min-1 (200 ºC, 2.16 kg), supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany). The melt flow index was carried 

out according to ISO 1133 [19]. 

2.1.4.3 Recycled polymer 

Recycled and waste thermoplastics are some of the major components of global municipal solid waste 

(MSW) and they present a promising raw material source for lignocellulosic composites, especially 

because of the large volume and low cost of these materials [20]. High density polyethylene (HDPE), 

low density polyethylene (LDPE/LLDPE), polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 

polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the primary constituents of plastics in MSW. Reutilizing 

the post-consumed polymeric materials reduces the environmental impact and the consumption of 

virgin plastics [21]. In this thesis, a mixture of recycled polyolefins in the grinding form with a MFI of 2.4 

g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), provided by Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp;amp; Co., Germany was used 

for the preparation of cork-polymer composites. 

2.1.5 Bio-based aliphatic polyesters 

Thermoplastics are having more environmental impact than thermosets because of its recyclability. 

Contributing to develop higher sustainable materials, bio-based products obtained from renewable 

resources maintain carbon dioxide neutrally [12]. Figure 2.2 shows the classification of the 

biodegradable polymers dived in four families and used in this work, adapted from Averous L. and 

Boquillon N. [22]. The family 1 to 3 are obtained from renewable resources. The first family is agro-

polymers (e.g. polysaccharides such as starch and cellulose) obtained from biomass by fraction.

and Boquillon N. [22]). 

 

The second and third families are polyesters, obtained respectively by fermentation from biomass or 

from genetically modified plants (e.g. polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA) and by synthesis from monomers 

obtain from biomass (e.g. polylactic acid, PLA). The fourth family are polyesters, totally synthesized by 

the petrochemical process (e.g. polycaprolactone, PCL) [22, 23]. The selected bio-based matrices, 

physical properties and its chemical structure are presented in the Table 2.2:

2.1.5.1 Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) 

Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), one of the promising biopolymers, is a linear aliphatic thermoplastic polyester, 

which can be synthesized using renewable agricultural resources, such as sugar feedstock and corn [6, 

26]. They are composed of chains of lactic acid that are produced by converting starch into sugar which 

is then fermented. By removal of water lactide is formed which is then converted into PLA resins 

through solvent-free polymerization [6]. PLA have been the focus of attention because they are 

produced from renewable resources, they are biodegradable and compostable, and they have very low 

or no toxicity and high mechanical performance, comparable to those of commercial polymers [27]. 

However, the thermal stability of PLAs is generally not sufficiently high enough for them to be used as 

an alternative in many commercial polymers applications. PLA crystallinity, crystallization rate, 

transparency and degradation rate of finished products can be regulated by the copolymerization of the 

selected L- to D-isomer ratios of lactic acid [24]. For instance, the PLA homopolymer such as such as 

poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is a hard, transparent and crystalline polymer having a melting point around 

170 ºC and a glass transition around 55 ºC [25]. PLLA attracts much attention as matrix in 

biocomposites because of its easier processing and ecologically friendly nature [28]. Companies like 

Cargill Dow are confident that PLA polymers will compete on a cost-performance basis with certain 

polymers, like polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester [6]. The PLA used in this thesis was a PLLA 

with a L-lactide content of 99.6 % and a Mw of 69 000 g.mol-1, and was obtained from Cargill Dow LLC. 

2.1.5.2 Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) 

Polyhydroxyallanoates (PHAs) are produced directly from renewable resources by microbes [22, 24]. 

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biotechnologically produced polyester that constitutes a carbon reserve 

in a wide variety of bacteria and has attracted much attention as a biodegradable thermoplastic 

polyester [23]. It can be degraded to water and carbon dioxide under environmental conditions through 

natural microbiological mineralization and has much potential for applications of environmental 

degradable plastics [25, 29]. The PHB presents some disadvantages compared with conventional 

plastics, such as, brittleness and a narrow processability window. To improve these properties it was 

developed the copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) that is highly crystalline 

with melting point and glass transition temperature similar to polypropylene [6]. 

The PHBV used in this thesis, presents 12% HV content and molecular weight (Mw) of approximately 

425 692 g.mol-1 was provided by PHB Industrial, Serrana, Brazil.

2.1.5.3 Polyhy-?-caprolactone (PCL) 

Poly(?-caprolactone ) (PCL) is a petroleum-based linear polymer recognized as one of the few synthetic 

polymers that are completely biodegradable [24, 26]. PCL, is a partially crystalline linear polyester with 

a low glass transition temperature of -60 ºC and a low melting temperature of 60 ºC. PCL is a tough 

and a semi-rigid material at room temperature having a modulus between those of low-density and high-

density polyethylene [6]. Moreover, PCL has good water, oil, solvent, and chlorine resistance, low 

viscosity, and is easily processed thermally [24]. It has been shown that PCL is degraded by enzymes, 

lipases, secreted from microorganisms [6].  

The PCL used in this thesis was a PCL resin (commercially available as TONE® 787), with Mw of 125 

000 g.mol-1, was obtained from Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Division, New Jersey, USA. 

2.1.5.4 Starch polyhy-?-caprolactone (SPCL) 

Starch is an expensive, annually renewable material from corn and other crops [24]. Starch converted 

to thermoplastic material (starch plastics) offers an interesting alternative for synthetic polymers where 

long-term durability is not needed and fast degradation is an advantage [6]. Starches exhibits poor melt 

processability, are highly water soluble, difficult to process, brittle, and hence need a plasticizer to make 

them suitable for engineering applications. Plasticizers such as water or glycols make starches flow and 

suitable for thermoplastic processing [25]. Under the Mater-Bi trademark, Novamont of Italy today 

produces four classes of biodegradable materials, all containing starch and differing in synthetic 

components [6]. In this sense, blending starch with synthetic biodegradable constituents such as PCL 

may also reduce the production cost [24]. The SPCL used in this thesis was a blend of corn starch with 

PCL 30/70 wt.% (SPCL) was supplied by Novamont, Italy. It contained about 63 wt.% of PCL, 27 wt.% of 

corn starch and 10 wt.% of natural plasticizers. The Mw of PCL present in this blend is about 118 000 

g.mol-1. 

2.1.6 Chemical treatments 

2.1.6.1 Coupling agents 

Lignocellulosic composites using polyolefins (i.e. polyethylene and polypropylene) have gained 

increasing interest over the past two decades, both in the scientific community and in industry [30]. The 

main drawback with the use of natural based components such as natural fibres in polyolefin 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

79 

composites is their hydrophilicity due to the high surface hydroxyl groups concentration which leads to 

poor interface and moisture resistance in composite materials [11].  The fibre–matrix interaction can be 

improved either via the fibre, usually by modifying its surface, or via the matrix, usually by employing 

additives called coupling agents [30]. Coupling is a common method of chemical modification. A 

coupling agent contains chemical groups which react with the fibre surface and the polymer matrix [7]. 

In such case, the interfacial bonding between the two components results in enhanced mechanical 

properties. Maleated polyolefins are the most widely used coupling agents [9, 31, 32]. They contain two 

functional domains: one a polyolefin typically high density polyethylene or polypropylene, which is able 

to form entanglements with the polymer matrix, and the second group, maleic anhydride, which is able 

to strongly interact with the fibre at extrusion temperatures, covalently (apparently), via hydrogen, or 

ionic bonds [32]. A schematic representation of the reaction between the lignocellulosic material 

surface and the coupling agent is provided in the Figure 2.3. 

 

 

Figure 2.3. Representation of the interface reaction between the cork surface and the PE-g-MA (Adapted 

from Araújo J.R. et al. [33]). 

 

Before compound, special care should be taken into account that maleated polyolefins since they can 

slowly react with air moisture during storage, and form free acid. As a result, chemical reactivity of the 

coupling agents decreases. Hence, it should be keep the maleated polyolefins dry, or heat them up 

before usage in order to regenerate the anhydride chemical structure [32]. In the composite formulation 

containing natural reinforcements or fillers, the maleated polyolefins are usually used at 1-5% by weight 

[32-35]. In the wood plastic composites the maleated coupling agent is the most expensive component 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

80 

representing 4-20% of the total cost of the materials in the formulation, while the plastic represents 60-

80% of the formulation [32]. 

In the work presented in this thesis, two different coupling agents based on maleic anhydride from 

ExxonMobil, Germany were used, to improve the interfacial bonding between cork and matrix and 

improved the mechanical properties of cork composites. The first coupling agent a HDPE functionalized 

with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride, was Exxelor PE 1040, 

with MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 131.3 ºC. The second one a PP 

grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PO 

1020), with MFI of 110 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 1.2 kg), and a melting point of 156 ºC. 

2.1.6.2 Extraction of suberin and lignin 

Suberin and lignin are the main chemical constituents from cork [2, 3]. Suberin is a natural biopolymer 

typically found in the cell walls of plants [36]. The structure of suberin in cork is not yet fully understood. 

It has been proposed that suberin consists of a polyester structure composed of long chain fatty acids, 

hydroxy fatty and phenolic acids, linked by ester groups [2, 37, 38]. Lignin is totally amorphous and 

hydrophobic in nature. It is the compound that gives rigidity to the plants. The main difficulty in lignin 

chemistry is that no method has been established by which it is possible to isolate lignin in its native 

state from the fibre [23]. 

The extraction of suberin and lignin from the cork powder was as follows: Extractive free cork powder 

was obtained after three consecutive 6 h soxhlet extractions with dichloromethane, ethanol and water. 

The resulting material was used to obtain the suberin and lignin fractions. Suberin extraction procedure 

was adapted from Ekman R et al. [39] and Pinto PCRO et al. [40]. The product (1g to 13ml) was 

refluxed in Ethanol:Water (25:1) containing 0.5M sodium hydroxide for a period of 6 h. After cooling, 

the resulting mixture was filtered and the liquid fraction was acidified to pH 5-6 with hydrochloric acid. 

After filtration, the solvent was removed in a vacuum evaporator. The resulting solid residue was 

suspended in water and extracted with 3 times the volume in chloroform. The organic fraction was 

recovered and the solvent removed in a vacuum evaporator, resulting in a brownish paste-like material. 

The methodology for lignin extraction was adapted from Ekman et al. [39] and Browning BL [41]. The 

solid residue resulting from the suberin extraction was thoroughly washed with distilled water until 

neutral pH. 350 ml of a 72% sulfuric acid solution were added to 30 g of this residue and the mixture 

was maintained under agitation for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by the addition of 550 ml of 

distilled water and refluxing for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solid residue was 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

81 

recovered through filtration and washed with distilled water until neutral pH, a dark powdery material 

being obtained. 

2.1.6.3 Alkali treatment 

Mercerization or alkali treatment with strong alkali bases was developed as a method for cotton fibre 

modification by John Mercerin 1850 [30]. Is a usual method to produce high quality natural fibres, by 

removing the natural and artificial impurities.  The chemical treatment reduces the fibre diameter and 

thereby increases the aspect ratio [8]. Mercerization is usually performed applying aqueous solutions of 

NaOH, at reaction times of 30 min up to 3 hr. As a result of alkali treatment (use of sodium hydroxide), 

the following reaction (Equation 2.1) is presented [8]. 

 

Fiber – OH + NaOH ? Fiber – O – Na+ + H2O   (2.1) 

 

Theoretically, other alkali types can be used as well, but sodium atoms have been shown to provide the 

optimal diameter for cellulose swelling, meaning that the treatment with NaOH is most efficient [42]. In 

any case, excess alkali has to be removed by washing the modified fibres/fillers subsequently, followed 

by a drying step [30]. The aspect of the long sisal fibre is presented in Figure 2.4 a) and the cut sisal 

fibre after alkali treatment in Figure 2.4 b).

treatment and (c) sisal cut fibre. 

 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

82 

In this thesis, the preparation of alkali treated sisal (Sisal_NaOH) was as follows [43]: the sisal fibres 

were immersed in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (5% w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After that 

the fibres were washed with distilled water containing a few drops of acetic acid. Final washings were 

carried out with distilled water until neutrality (pH = 7), to remove the excess of NaOH present on the 

fibres, until this water no longer indicated any alkalinity reaction. Then, the fibres were air-dried at room 

temperature, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 70 ºC and after stabilise was stored in 

polyethylene bags for further characterization. 

2.2 Composites processing 

Composite material, is defined according to the standard ASTM D 3878 [44], as a substance consisting 

of two or more materials, insoluble in one another, which are combined to form a useful engineering 

material possessing certain properties not possessed by the constituents [44]. Composites using 

natural component such as the use of natural fibres to reinforce the polymeric matrix are manufactured 

using traditional manufacturing techniques that includes compounding, mixing, extrusion, injection 

moulding, compression moulding, and resin transfer moulding [9, 27]. In this work pultrusion, extrusion, 

injection moulding and compression moulding processes were used to proof their successability for 

producing cork-based composites and biocomposites with potential of application as sustainable 

products.  The production of natural fibre composites is strongly limited by the temperature and 

processing times begin seeing significant thermal degradation around 180 - 210 ºC, or over 175 ºC for 

long periods with a significant decrease on the mechanical properties [7, 45]. Therefore, the processing 

of these composites must be limited to temperatures at the lower range of this degradation range and 

for limited processing times avoiding significant fibre damage and reduced composite performance [7]. 

The moisture content at a given relative humidity also can have a great effect on the biological 

performance of a composite made from natural fibers [9]. The low moisture of cork can be regarded as 

one of the advantages of cork to be selected as natural component in the composites, since is a 

hydrophobic material with low moisture content. 

2.2.1 Pultrusion 

Pultrusion is an automated process to produce continuous, constant-cross-section composites [7]. 

Long-fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites granules are usually produced with the pultrusion 

process. At the exit of this system the cross-section of the strand is calibrated by a nozzle, then cooled 

and granulated [46]. 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

83 

 

  

Figure 2.5. Pultrusion system used to compound the CPC pellets [47]. 

 

In this work the different cork powders were mixed with the thermoplastics (in 50-50 wt% ratio) in the 

dry form and further compounded in an industrial pultrusion system (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany) as 

shown in Figure 2.5, to obtain cork-polymer composite pellets (Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp;amp; Co., 

Germany). In this process the material mixture is equally plastified with frictional heat and pressure. 

Resulting steam is vacuumed off. The pultruded material is pneumatically transported into a granulator 

which produces a homogeneous and uniform granule [47]. 

2.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion 

The extrusion process is used by the plastic industry for the production of granules and also in the 

continuous production of semi-finished products or components. Single screw as well as twin-screw 

extruders that run either co- or counter-rotating may be used for this process. Single screw extruders 

are used when the mixing effect does not have to be very high. The excellent mixing effect of twin-screw 

extruder the natural fibre materials can be homogenously distributed and wetted in the polymer melt [9, 

46]. For instance, counter-rotating twin-screw extruders are mainly used in the processing of wood fibre 

reinforced thermoplastics (WPC), because the screws run in opposite directions, a secure material feed 

and a defined compacting of the material can be achieved [46]. The principal characteristics of both 

systems to process natural fibre composite systems are compared in Table 2.3.

Downstream processing equipment these advantages and disadvantages must be considered and take 

into account to produce the novel cork-polymer composite pellets. In this thesis to produce cork-based 

composite pellets it was selected:  

 

? Counter-rotating twin-screw extruder 

This system was selected to produce cork-polymer composites materials with the highest cork content 

50 wt.% and 70 wt.% respectively. Moreover the hybrid cork-based composite pellets reinforced with 

natural fibres were also compounding using this system due to the high complexity of the different 

components (i.e. cork, natural fibres, thermoplastic polymer and coupling agent). 

In both cases, prior to compounding, all natural raw materials were dried at 80 ºC during 24 h to 

stabilise the cork moisture content. These compositions were compound in a counter-rotating twin-

screw extrusion machine (Carvex, Portugal), which had a screw diameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of 

18 with a nonintermeshing, mixing mode screw configuration. The barrel temperature profile was in the 

range 150 up to 190 ºC, and the screw speed was fixed at 30 rpm. The cork in the powder form and 

the grinding selected matrix (i.e. polyethylene or polypropylene) were pre-mixed and manually feed in 

the hopper system. No extrusion head was used in order to minimize the residence time and shear heat 

dissipation. The extruded material was cooled in air, granulated in a cutting mill to produce composite 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods

pellets. The pellets were stored in plastic bags and sealed and further conditioned at room temperature 

for further investigation. 

 

? Co-rotating twin-screw extruder 

The co-rotating twin-screw extruder system was selected to produce several varieties of cork-polymer 

composites pellets for different purposes, being: 

(a) To evaluate the effect of the cork addition to the polypropylene matrix, the effect of cork 

granulometry and addition of coupling agent on the properties of the composites. In this case, the 

compositions were compounded in a Leistriz LSM 30.34 intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder 

with a screw diameter of 33.7 mm and a length to diameter ratio L/D of 29, coupled to a die with a two 

cylindrical outputs with 4 mm diameter each. The extruder was equipped with two automatic volumetric 

feeders, for the addition of grinding PP with or without coupling agent (i.e. volumetric (Moretto)) and the 

other for the cork in the granules or in the powder form (i.e. gravimetric (K-tron)) as shown in Figure 

2.6. Generally, the polyolefin and the coupling agent were tumble-mixed and fed through the hopper. In 

all the experiments it was used a vacuum pump system and the feed rate was set for 2 kg/h.

die and (c) Leistriz LSM 30.34 twin-screw extruder (TSE) with the two feeders and the vacumm system. 

 

The temperature presents a decreasing at the end of the profile since it is compensated by the 

increased shearing which tends to increase the temperature of the composite. Part of the extrudate was 

cooled in water bath and subsequently ground by a Scheer (Germany) grinder in order to obtain pellets 

with length ? 5 mm. The pellets were dried in an oven at 80 ºC and further packed and sealed in 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

86 

plastic bags and conditioned at room temperature (23ºC, 55% relative humidity) at least for 48 hours 

prior to further investigation. 

 

(b) To evaluate the use of suberin and lignin as bio-based coupling agents through a reactive extrusion 

process. The extruder is an ideal reactor for polymer modification in that it serves as a pressure vessel 

equipped for intensive mixing, shear, control of temperature and residence time, venting of by-product 

and transport of molten polymer through the various sections of the extruder, each serving as a mini-

reactor. It is an economically attractive process since the extrusion and the processing are done in a 

single stage and without chemical solvents emissions [49]. 

In this case, and before compounding, the cork powder was pre-dried at 80 ºC in a vacuum oven until 

constant weight. The raw materials, including the pulverized polyethylene, the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 

and the coupling agent PE-g-MA, were pre-mixed. Compounding was performed in a prototype modular 

laboratorial mini intermeshing co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) as shown in Figure 2.7, with a 

screw diameter of 13 mm, and a length to diameter ratio (L/D) = 27, coupled to a rod die with a 

diameter of 3mm. The screw profile is built by sliding along a shaft conveying and kneading elements 

with a maximum channel depth of 1.5 mm.

The temperature profile along the barrel and die was set to 165/180/185/185/175°C for all the 

experiments, the feed rate was kept at 130 g/h, and the screws rotating at 70 rpm. The pre-mixed 

polymer and cork were feed upstream by a miniaturized volumetric feeder (based on a Moretto DVM 18 

L), together with the BPO initiator, or the PE-g-MA. Suberin and/or lignin were added as shown in Figure 

2.7 b) and c), by means of an automatic syringe pump (AL-1000, from WPI, USA), or manually, 

respectively. After air-cooling, part of the extruded composite was pelletized. 

 

(c) To produce biocomposite pellets with cork. 

The raw materials were pre-mixed and then were compounded in a Rondol SCF modular co-rotating 

twin-screw extruder (TSE) as shown in Figure 2.8, with the screws diameter of 16 mm, a length to 

diameter ratio (L/D) = 25 and a single strand die of 3 mm.

The mixture (i.e. granulated cork and bio-based polymer) was placed in the hopper and automatically 

feeded at a constant rate with a volumetric dosing unit from SHINI Plastics Technologies (Germany). 

Part of the extrudate was cooled in water bath and subsequently ground by a lab pelletizer SCHEER 

(Stuttgart) to produce composite pellets (see Figure 2.8 f) with length ? 5 mm for injection moulding. 

2.2.3 Compression moulding 

The pressure method is a common processing technique in the manufacture of natural fiber 

composites due to of its high reproducibility, simplicity and versatility [7, 9, 46]. Compression moulding 

materials combined with natural fibres are used in the automobile industry to produce car interior lining 

parts. The main reason for this application is the great strength and stiffness and the low composite 

density of the natural fibre composites [46].  

In this work, compression moulding process of the obtained dry pellets after pultrusion or twin-screw 

extrusion were processed using a hydraulic press from (Moore, UK) or (Carver, USA) to produce boards 

with 3 and 6 mm of thickness from the different compositions (see Figure 2.9).  A certain amount of 

pellets (approximately 70g) from each composition was collected and dispersed into a mold with a 

rectangular geometry (around 20x23cm2) and 3mm of thickness, containing on the top and on the 

bottom two removal covers.

(50/50) wt.% board with 6mm thick and (c) Cork-polymer composite board after CNC process to obtain 

the tensile specimens. 

 

Between the pellets and the top and bottom mold walls it was used two Teflon sheets to allow the 

unmolding. This system was placed in a hydraulic press at a temperature between 150-170 ºC, 

depending on the thermoplastic matrix (PE or PP) used to produce the pellets, for a period of 8min to 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

89 

allow the melting and homogenization of the pellets mass, and further pressed during 2min at a 

pressure of 11 ton followed by a cooling stage of 5 to 10min consisting on maintaining the pressure 

and using water to decrease the temperature aiming to decrease the temperature of the material inside 

the mold near to the room temperature. Finally, the pressure was removed and the small contraction 

that occurs on the board facilitates the unmolding of composite material. 

To produce rectangular cork-polymer composite boards of 220?220?6 mm3 it was applied similar 

conditions of temperature and pressure were the period of time was extended to 9-10 min followed by a 

period of 4-5 min under pressure before cooling and perform the mould release. Tensile bars in dog 

bone shape were obtained from these boards of 3mm thick using a computer numerical control CNC 

machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). The specimens were produced according to ISO 527–2 [50, 

51] and similar standard ASTM D 638 [52] as shown in Figure 2.9 c). 

2.2.4 Injection moulding 

It is possible to produce complex geometric components with functional elements fast and also in high 

volumes by this process [46].  Injection moulding is a major plastic forming process in which the 

components to obtain the final material passes through five stages: (1) mould closing, (2) filling, (3) 

packing–holding, (4) cooling and (5) mould opening are preceded repeatedly. The industry mostly 

adopted injection moulding for plastic processing since, as a cyclic process, it has rapid production rate 

on complex shape product with good dimensional accuracy and surface finishing [53]. It is a high-

pressure process with machine capital costs and tooling costs generally high compared to other 

composites processing routes. However, these costs can be recovered through inherent short cycle 

times, automation, and low labour costs [54]. 

Prior to injection moulding, the produced pellets were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 ºC until stabilize. It 

was used two different injection moulding machines to produce the tensile specimens as presented in 

Figure 2.10. The polypropylene and the PP/cork composite pellets were injection moulded in an ENGEL 

Spex Victory 50 (Austria GmbH) with 500 kN of clamping force.  

The neat polymers and the biobased composite pellets were injection moulded in a Ferromatik-Milacron 

K85 (Germany) with 850 kN of clamping force. The mould temperature was controlled through a 

thermal regulator Piovan THN 6P (Piovan, Italy).

specimens. 

 

In Both cases, the injection-moulded specimens were tensile bars produced according ASTM 638, with 

60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2×4 mm2, and a neck length of 20 mm. The 

samples were placed in polyethylene plastic bags and conditioned at ambient temperature. 

2.3 Characterization methods 

2.3.1 Physical properties 

2.3.1.1 Density of cork and cork composites 

? Cork 

The bulk density of the different cork powders was determined using a volumetric flask of 500ml were it 

was placed and compacted the material to minimise the possible empty spaces between the particles.  

      (2.2) 

 

The equation 2.2 was applied for density calculations were, d is the specific weight (Kg/m3) of the cork 

raw material, m is the weight of the compact cork powder and v is the volume occupied by the cork 

powder into the volumetric flask. Three measurements were performed for each cork powder. 

 

? Cork Composites 

The density of the natural fibres and of the different composite specimens was determined according to 

the standard ASTM D 792 [56], using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

91 

immersion vessel. Five specimens were weighted per each sample. It was used Propanol as immersion 

liquid and it was used the following equation: 

 

   (2.3) 

 

where ? is the specific gravity of the solid (g/cm3), G the Buoyancy of the plummet; ? (liq) is the density 

of the liquid and ? (liq. propanol) was 0,7982 g/cm3 (being the experimental value). The density of the 

natural fibres (i.e. coir and sisal) was also determined using this method. Due to the reduced weight of 

a single fibre it was used a small number of fibres to determine the fibre density per condition. 

2.3.1.2 Fibre diameter 

Natural fibres are quite different from the synthetic fibres. Natural fibres often consists of a bundle of 

elementary fibres, which results in an irregular shape depending on the number of elementary fibres 

and the way by which they are packed together [57].  

Figure 2.11 reveal a typical optical microscopic (OM) image of the morphology, showing the polished 

cross-section of a cork-polymer composite reinforced with the sisal after alkali treatment. The cross-

section shows elementary fibres and we observed that is not perfectly round. Furthermore, the natural 

fibers also can present a hollow structure, called lumen, which looks like a small open channel in the 

centre of the cell and maybe affect the actual fibre area under a mechanical loading. Thus, the 

diameter observed under OM can vary a lot depending on the view it is observed. 

 

Figure 2.11. Optical image of a polished cork-polymer composite cross-section reinforced with sisal 

fibre after alkali treatment. 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

92 

 

Since natural fibres presents irregular shape and are non-uniform along the fibre axis, it is difficult to 

obtain a good focus on the fibre image under OM to determine the fibre diameter. As shown in Figure 

2.12, it is not easy to achieve a good focus of such stack of elementary fibre bundle. 

Therefore, it is not surprised that this method often results in an inaccurate value of tensile strength 

with very high SD value for the natural fibres. 

 

 

Figure 2.12. Partial view of the software used to determine the fibre diameter. 

 

In this sense, and to reduce the variability of the experimental values, the diameter measurements of 

natural fibres were made in five spaced locations along the gauge length of 30 different specimens 

using an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP11, (Japan) 

digital camera. The measurements were performed used a software Leica Qwin Pro and a partial view 

of the program is shown in Figure 2.12, representing a sisal fibre. 

2.3.1.3 Moisture content 

The percentage of humidity of the different cork powders, or in the natural fibres was determined using 

a balance Sartorius (Sartorius AG, Germany) were the cork powder or the fibres were submitted to 105 

ºC during a period of 10min. This procedure was performed three times for each cork powder sample. 

The moisture content of the composite specimens was calculated as follows: 

 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

93 

   (2.4) 

 

where Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying 

(g). Averages of five specimens were used for WA and MC measurements. 

2.3.1.4 Water absorption 

Aiming to study the dimensional stability of the developed cork composites the water absorption tests 

were conducted according the ASTM D 570 [58]. 

To determine the water absorption, specimens (measuring 6mm in thickness, 60mm wide and 90 mm 

long) from the different materials were immersed in distilled water, at 23 ± 1 ºC and atmospheric 

pressure, for different time periods (up to 11 days). In the end of each time period, five specimens of 

each material were removed, gently blotted with tissue paper to remove the excess water on the surface 

and immediately weighed. The water absorption was calculated according to the equation (2.5):

where Wa = weight of the specimen after being immersed for a certain period of time and Wb = weight of 

the same specimen before immersion (g). 

 

2.3.1.5 Weight loss 

The weight loss (WL) of the developed specimens was calculated as follows: 

 

   (2.6) 

 

where Wi is the initial weight of the specimen (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying (g). For 

that purpose, the specimens were weighed using an analytical balance after being placed in a vacuum 

oven at 40 ºC for 48 h, cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days followed by reweighing of the 

specimens. Averages of five specimens in each time point were used for WL measurements.

using a digital micrometer Mitutoyo (Japan), with a precision of ± 0.001 mm. Three to five specimens 

per each condition were measured. 

2.3.1.7 Soil degradation tests 

The soil burial test can be considered a realistic approach to the biodegradation process in a waste 

landfill. To demonstrate the potential of the biodegradable injection moulded matrices and the 

biocomposite cork-polymer specimens (i.e. PLLA/Cork; PHBV/Cork, PCL/Cork and SPCL/Cork) were 

placed in vessels of 5 L used as soil containers and buried in soil. The physical and chemical 

composition of the compost used, indicates an organic matter higher than 70%. The specimens were 

monitored and removed at predetermined intervals of time test up to 4320 days. The average room 

temperature was 19 – 21 ºC and relative moisture was kept at least 50 % by pulverizing the soil with 

distilled water and allowing continuous aeration. Once removed, samples were withdrawn carefully, 

placed in small nets to avoid disintegration of the specimen and washed with distilled water. After that, 

the samples where dried at 40 ºC in a vacuum oven to constant weight and kept in a desiccator, and 

then measured in terms of thickness variation and weight loss before undergo to further 

characterization. It was used averages of 5 independent specimens in each time point per condition. 

2.3.1.8 Fibre crystallinity 

To detect the crystalline structure of cellulose in sisal, Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) 

diffractograms were recorded using the Bruker-AXS D8 Discover diffractometer in ?–2? geometry using 

Cu K?1,2 lines collimated with a Gobël mirror, a divergent slit of 0.6 mm, a detector slit of 1 mm and 

0.6 mm and a Ni filter. The data was collected from 6-50° with a step size of 0.04° and an acquisition 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods

time of 1º sec per step. The percentage of crystallinity (%Cr), performed using a fitting program, was 

calculated based on:  

 

% Cr = (Acryst / Atotal) × 100   (2.8) 

 

where,  Acryst is the area below the diffraction peak of the  (002) plane, peak at 2?  = 22.5º, and from the 

(101) and (10 ) plane, peak at (13-18º), and Atotal is the area below the whole region representing the 

amorphous material in the cellulosic fibres. 

2.3.1.9 Acoustic tests 

The building elements for acoustic tests consisted on a superior element from CPC or fibreboard with 

dimensions of 220X220X6 mm3 and an agglomerated cork underlay with thickness of 1.8 mm thick as 

it is presented in Figure 2.13. Commercially available silicone glue (thickness of 0.5-0.6mm) was used 

to fix the agglomerated cork underlay to the previously produced boards (CPC, HDF and MDF boards) 

(Figure 2.13 a). The aim of including this agglomerated cork underlay was to avoid reverberation sound 

and fix the boards. The pavement was submitted to a uniformly distributed load (20 to 25 kg.m-2). The 

tests were conduct in a reverberant chamber with a 7.25 m length, 5.88 m width, 4.65 m height and a 

volume of 202 m3 as presented in the scheme of Figure 2.14. The tests were conducted at atmospheric 

conditions 22 ºC and 66 % of humidity.

measurement testing: (a) silicone application on the CPC board b) normalized tapping machine on the

The equipment used for the measurements was a tapping machine Brüel &amp;amp; Kjaer (B&amp;amp;K, Germany) Type 

3204; B&amp;amp;K 2260 dual channel real-time frequency analyser and B&amp;amp;K 13 mm microphone model 4189. 

The microphone height was about 1.4 m.  

 

 

Figure 2.14. Scheme of the acoustic test performed in the reverberation chamber. 

 

The measurements of sound insulation were performed according the standard EN ISO 140-8 [59] and 

717-2 [60]. The measurements were taken at three locations of the tapping machine relative to the 

floor sample area of 2 m2 and 5 positions of microphone with to different lectures using one-third-octave 

bands, 100 Hz to 4200 Hz. The reduction of impact noise by floor covering on standard floor was 

determined according the equation: 

 

nn
LLL ???

0,    (2.9) 

 

where, ?L  is the reduction of impact sound pressure level, Ln,0 is the normalized impact sound 

pressure level in the absence of floor covering and Ln is the normalized impact sound pressure level 

with floor covering. The impact sound improvement index (?Lw) was determined according to the 

standard EN ISO 717-2 [60]. 

2.3.1.10 Warping 

Warping can result from an inferior product construction, wrong choice of materials or inadequate 

processing routes. Other reason that can cause this effect is the high moisture content in the air. After 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

97 

processing, CPC boards (220?220?6 mm3) obtained by compression moulding were submitted to a 

specific test to access the possible occurrence of warping effect. The obtained results were compared 

with the commercial fibreboard composites cut with the same dimensions. In Figure 2.15 is shown a 

schematic illustration of the performed test. 

 

 

Figure 2.15. Scheme of the specimen’s geometry with the measuring system for warping determination. 

 

Figure 2.15 shows the used system with a pointer p with precision capability of 0.01 mm of 

displacement. Two perpendicular measurements in each board were performed according the indicated 

directions a and b. At least 15 boards (in dry state) of each condition were analysed to evaluate the 

warping effect. 

2.3.1.11 Hardness 

To infer eventual morphological variations of the cork-based composite materials and to characterize 

the developed materials after compression moulding, it was attempted microhardness measurements. 

However, due to the small indentations on the composite surface and due to the recovery properties of 

cork, this test was not indicated. The hardness of the materials was determined by Shore-D Hardness 

Tester (model bareiss – Prüfgeräte, Germany). The hardness test was performed according the 

standard ASTM D 2240-05 [61]. This test method is based on the penetration of a specific type of 

indentor when forced into the material under specified conditions. It is recommended that Durometer D 

tests be used when Durometer A results are greater than 90 [61]. Ten measurements were performed 

per condition.

2.3.2 Morphological properties 

2.3.2.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

? Morphology of the natural materials  

The different qualities of cork powder obtained from the industrial processing were analyzed using a 

Quanta 400 FEG model (FEI, USA) ambiental scanning electron microscope with low vacuum to avoid 

any possible desire effect in the natural raw material structure. Since the several cork powders presents 

low dimension, the objective was to confirm that the vacuum effect does not affect the observation of 

the cellular structure of the natural materials. 

 

? Morphology of the composites 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the developed cork-polymer composites fracture surface was 

performed using a Leica-Cambridge S-360 (UK) scanning electron microscope. All the samples were 

sputter-coated with gold before being analysed.  

 

In addition, it was also used for examine the microstructure of the cork-polymer phases, fracture 

surfaces of the different specimens a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron 

microscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd 

alloy (80-20 wt.%) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). 

2.3.2.2 Optical microscopy (OM) 

In order to understand the nucleating ability of cork on the matrix, a single cork powder was 

sandwiched between two thin PP films and heated at 200ºC during 10min to erase the previous 

thermal history of the sample. Then, the sample was quickly shifted to a well-controlled temperature 

stage (Linkam, THMS-600) where the pre-determined crystallization temperature was maintained at 

140 ºC for 1h, to access to the crystallization process. A fast cooling was estimated to be 80ºC.min-1 

was used to reach the isothermal crystallization temperature. Dry nitrogen was introduced to eliminate 

any possible degradation in all cases. The crystallization of PP on the cork powder was observed on an 

optical microscope (Olympus B) connected to a Leica digital camera. 

In addition, to observe the distribution of cork particles on the PP matrix, after injection moulding, was 

observed on a transmission optical microscope (Olympus BH-2) connected to a Leica DFC 280 digital 

camera and corresponding software. To prepare the samples for the analyses, one slice with a

thickness of 15 µm was cut, using a Leitz 1401 microtome equipped with a glass slicing knife, from the 

longitudinal section of the tensile specimen as presented in Figure 2.16. The images were obtained 

from the middle section of the tensile specimen.

bright field and (c) image with color treatment to evidence the distribution of cork particles in the 

polypropylene matrix. 

 

Each sample slice was placed between a microscope glass slide and cover glass. To prevent them from 

curling up or corrugating, Canada balsam was used as a fixing resin. Special care was taken during the 

analysis to identify the cork particle distribution; the cork and the matrix domains as presented in Figure 

2.16 b) and c). All samples were left to cure under a simple weight pressure during at least 12 h prior 

to analysis. 

2.3.3 Chemical properties 

2.3.3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 

To confirm the extraction of suberin and lignin extraction; the chemical groups attributed to the natural 

fibres including cork and to confirm the chemical modification in sisal, the fibres were analysed using 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-

Prestige 21. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the 

spectra were acquired between 4400 cm-1 to 800 cm-1 using a resolution of 4 cm-1.

2.3.4 Mechanical properties 

2.3.4.1 Tensile properties of the composites 

? Tensile properties of the composites 

All the tensile tests were conducted using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 Universal 

Machine, USA) using a load cell of 1KN and a crosshead speed of 5mm min?1 was used up to a 

deformation at break.  All the mechanical results were obtained with a minimum of five to ten tested 

specimens.  The tensile tests were performed according the specifications of standard ISO 527 [50, 51] 

and ASTM 638 [52]. The test specimens were conditioned at 23 ± 2°C and 50 ± 5% relative humidity. 

The specimens with dog bone shape were obtained by compression moulding or by injection moulding. 

The specimen dimensions present 60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2×4 mm2, 

and a neck length of 20 mm. In the case of the compression moulded samples the thickness was 

slightly higher (3mm). In the tensile tests a force was taken as the maximum force in the force 

deformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated by extending the initial linear portion of the load-

extension curve and dividing the difference in stress corresponding to segment of section on this 

straight line by the corresponding difference in strain (average between 0.05% and 1%) using the linear 

regression method. According to the standard it can be also employed to determine the tensile modulus 

the secant method. The maximum tensile strength was determined by dividing the load at break or 

maximum load by the original minimum cross-sectional area.  The result is expressed in (MPa). The 

percent elongation at break is calculated by dividing the elongation at the moment of rupture by the 

initial gauge length and multiplying by 100. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 

48 h before testing.  

 

? Tensile properties of the Single fibres 

After the observation and diameter measurement using optical microscopy, fibres with apparent defects 

were removed in this process, since such defects are not representative for the fibre. Single fibre tensile 

tests were performed with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) using a 1 kN load cell, a crosshead 

speed of 1 mm min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. Prior to testing, fibres were mounted on 

sturdy paper frames using a high-strength hot melt glue and placed in a desiccators for a minimum 

period of 48 h. The tensile properties of the single sisal fibres were determined according to the 

standard ASTM C 1557 – 03 [62]. 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

101 

The observed fibres were temporarily fixed on the mounting card (see Figure 2.17) with thermal glue. 

The testing was then carried out as follows: 

1) The prepared samples were subjected to optical microscopy to examine an accurate diameter 

of the test specimens. The diameter was measured in three different positions along the fibre 

and the mean values were used for data processing; 

2) The samples were tested in a universal tensile test with mechanical grips; 

3) Both sides of the card were cut in the middle before sating the test; 

4) The test specimens were tested at a crosshead speed of 1mm/min with  30 mm gauge length; 

5) The stress and strain of the loaded test specimens were tested automatically with Instron 

software; 

6) Finally all the results (modulus, tensile strength and maximum deformation) were treated and 

recalculated using Microsoft Excel.

2.3.4.2 Flexural testing 

Three point static flexural tests were carried out using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 

Universal Machine, USA) with a load cell of 1KN in accordance with standard ISO 178 [63]. The 

dimensions of the specimens used were 120 mm length, 15 mm width and 6 mm thick as presented in 

Figure 2.18. The load was placed midway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. The 

crosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the core 

break.

Being, ?f1 the flexural stress measured at the deflection S1 and ?f2 the flexural stress measured at the 

deflection S2, both in megapascal. 

2.3.4.3 Impact testing 

The Charpy impact tests were performed according the standard ISO 179-1 [64] and to ASTM 259-04 

[65] on a Ceast Fractovis (Pianezza, Italy) instrumented falling weight impact tester with a pendulum 

energy of 2 J. The Charpy V-Notched specimens were rectangular bars with 120 mm length, 12 mm 

width and 6 mm thick.  The V-Notched angle was 45º. The absorbed energy during the crack initiation 

process is given in kJ/m2. It was tested a minimum of seven specimens per condition. 

2.3.5 Statistical analysis 

All results are provided as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The values obtained by tensile and flexural 

tests of the cork-polymer composites obtained by pultrusion followed by compression moulding were 

analysed in terms of the normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was evaluated using 

Shapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at p&amp;lt;0.05. The results were compared using a 

Two-Sample t-Test and differences were considered significantly different at p&lt;0.05.

properties before and after water immersion tests, the data were statistically analysed using IBM SPSS 

software v. 23.0 (Release 23.0 for Windows). Firstly, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used to ascertain about 

the data normality. The normality was rejected, since as observed by the p value (p &amp;lt;0.05). Therefore, 

nonparametric tests were used in further comparisons. Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to 

compare the medians of the tensile modulus, tensile strength and maximum strain for the composite 

specimens before and after immersion tests. Differences between groups were considered to be 

statistically significant at a confidence level of 95.0 %. 

In the development of hybrid cork-polymer composites containing coconut fibre one-way analysis of 

variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison tests was used to infer about 

significant differences between mean values of the mechanical properties in the developed cork 

composite materials. Assumptions of ANOVA such as normality were evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk test. A 

level of ? = 0.05 was used for statistical significance. 

In addition, in the development of hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre with and 

without coupling agents it was used Weibull to predict with more accuracy the tensile failure. In a first 

stage, the values obtained by tensile and flexural tests were analysed by the normality of the distribution 

of the mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at 

p&lt;0.05. The means were compared using a Two-Sample t-Test or the non-parametric Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test and differences were considered significantly different at p&lt;0.05 (*). Additionally and in 

order to predict the failure probability of the developed hybrid cork composites the values obtained from 

the tensile tests were statistically analysed by using the two-parameter Weibull model, where the 

cumulative distribution function is given by the equation [66]:

where F(x) is the probability of failure of a composite material subjected to a stress level x. In equation 

(2), ? and ? are two constants to be determined, known as the “scale parameter” or “characteristic 

strength” and the “shaper parameter”, respectively. Finally the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) was 

employed to evaluate the goodness-of-fit to the data points.

2.3.6 Thermal properties 

2.3.6.1 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 

The TGA involves weighing a small volume and weight of sample and exposing it to a heated chamber 

in the presence of nitrogen. The sample is suspended on a sensitive balance that measures the weight 

loss of the sample as the system is heated. Nitrogen or another gas (e.g. air), flows around the sample 

to remove the pyrolysis or combustion products. Weight loss is recorded as a function of time and 

temperature [67]. With the use of the computer software, the rate of weight loss as a function of time 

and temperature can also be measured. This is referred to as derivative thermogravimetric curve or 

DTG. 

TGA was performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the cork and the natural fibres to 

test the thermal stability. In the case of sisal fibre was used to confirm the chemical modification. The 

thermal stability was determined using a TGA Q500 series thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, 

USA). Experiments were performed in platinum pans, at a heating rate of 10 °C.min-1 from ambient 

temperature to 600 °C in nitrogen or in air atmosphere. In each chapter similar weight and geometry 

samples were tested. Analyses were performed in a minimum of two samples of each condition. 

2.3.6.2 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 

? Cork-polymer composite materials 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 

model (USA) equipment and using samples of 8–12 mg. DSC was conducted at a heating rate of 10 

ºC.min?1, under nitrogen atmosphere (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). For all materials, the first scan is used for 

eliminating the thermal history of the material. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting 

temperature (Tm) are determined from the second heating scan. The crystallisation temperature (Tc) is 

obtained from the cooling scan because the samples are not quenched. Tg is determined at the mid-

point of heat capacity changes, Tm at the onset peak of the endothermic and Tc at the onset peak of the 

exothermic. Two or three samples for each composite material were tested. By integration of the 

corresponding peaks, we have determined the different heats of melting and crystallization (?Hm and 

?Hc). These values (determined in J/g) can be corrected from a dilution effect linked to the fillers 

incorporation into the matrix e.g., see equation 2.14 where w is the cork fraction.

where ?H´m is the apparent enthalpy of fusion per gram of polymer and w is the weight fraction of cork 

in the composite. All the analysis were repeated at least once. 

 

? Bio-based composite materials 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the moulded specimens was assessed by 

DSC in a Perkin-Elmer, Pyris Diamond system at 20 ºC min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC 

scans were performed in bulk specimens cut from the central part of the rectangular cross-section of 

the tensile specimens. The glass transition temperature (Tg), cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc), 

melting temperature (Tm) and total enthalpy (?H) of all injection moulded materials were identified. The 

degree of crystallinity (?c) was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline a melting enthalpy of (?Hmº) 

of the used polymer and according to the equation: 

 

   (2.16) 

 

where ?Hrec is the enthalpy of recrystallization before melting; ?Hm the enthalpy of melting and w is the 

weight fraction of cork in the composite. All the samples were repeated at least once. 

2.3.6.3 Oxidation induction time (OIT) 

The polymer is oxidizes in the atmosphere including Oxygen which deteriorates mechanical strength 

and electrical property. This decomposition by the oxidation starts from the low temperature than 

decomposition in an inert gas. For instance in polyethylene, the oxidation decomposition starts below 

than 200 ºC in the air to the contrary of the thermal decomposition from the vicinity of 400 ºC in the 

nitrogen atmosphere. For this reason, antioxidizing agents are employed to protect polyolefins such as 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods

the polyethylene [68]. To determine if the addition of cork contributes to some positive effect the 

oxidation induction time (OIT) tests were concucted. OIT measurements were performed in a TA 

instrument DSC Q100 model (USA) equipment. Indium was used as calibration. The samples were 

heated at a rate of 20 ºC.min-1 up to 200 ºC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 4 min at 200 ºC, the 

atmosphere was changed to oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation induction time was 

measured during the isothermal period. The analyses were performed in three samples per each 

condition. 

2.3.6.4 Melt flow index (MFI) 

Melt Flow Index (MFI) also known as the Melt Flow Rate (MFR) is the output rate (flow) in grammes that 

occurs in 10 minutes through a standard die of 2.0955 mm diameter and 8.000 mm in length when a 

fixed pressure is applied to the melt via a piston and a load of total mass of 2.16 kg at a temperature of 

190°C (some polymers are measured at a higher temperature, some use different weights). The higher 

a MFI, the more polymer flows under test conditions.  

In the present work a Daventest (England) was used for obtaining data and allow determining melt flow 

index (MFI) of the neat polypropylene and of each composite material in the pellet form. Procedures 

were performed according to ISO 1133 [19] and ASTM D1238 [69], using 210 ºC and 2.16 or 5 kg. 

Each condition was repeated once. For all the materials tested, the respective MFI was calculated 

according to: 

 

    (2.17) 

In equation 2.17, T is the temperature, L is the load, m is the average weight of the extruded material 

and t is the time interval selected for the test. 

2.3.6.5 Fire resistance tests 

In designing building materials, fire resistance classification of the product is one of the most important 

features. Single flame fire tests were carried out according to the standard ISO 11925-2 [70]. The 

single flame source test was performed in specimens with dimensions of 188 x 119 mm2 and 6 mm 

thick. The specimen was held vertically and a flame was applied from the bottom edge of the specimen 

becoming more aggressive effect on the materials. According to the standard a burning time of 15 to 

20 seconds was applied and the burning dimensions after the test were registered. Three specimens 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

108 

were tested for each composite during a period of 20 seconds. A filter paper is placed beneath the 

specimen holder to monitor the falling of flaming fragments as represented in Figure 2.19. The fire 

resistance classification was attributed according of the standard fire test of building materials EN ISO 

13501-1 [71]. 

The classification for wall and ceiling products is based on the contribution to fire development the 

products will give in a scenario with a fire starting in a small room, by a single burning object. 

Classification for reaction to fire is in principle for products in their end-use application. The different 

classifications can be described as follows [72]: 

 

 

Figure 2.19. Scheme of the support type (a) presenting: 1) specimen holder; 2) specimen; 3) support; 

4) base of the burner from the Standard ISO 11925-2 [70]; (b) presents the experimental test in a MDF 

board and (c) in a HDPE-Cork powder (50-50) wt.%. 

 

Class A1 products will not contribute to the fire growth or to the fully developed fire; 

Class A2 products will not significantly contribute to the fire growth and fire load in a fully developed 

fire; Class B products will not lead to a flashover situation, however they will contribute to the fully 

developed fire; Class C products may lead to a flashover situation, but only in the second part of the 

reference scenario test, i.e. after more than 10 minutes; Class D products may lead to a flashover 

situation, within the first part of the reference scenario test, i.e. within 10 minutes; Class E products 

may quickly lead to a flashover situation, possibly within the first two minutes of the reference scenario 

test; Class F no test is required. 



Chapter 2 – Materials and methods 

 

109 

In addition to the main classification for contribution to fire growth, additional classification parameters 

are assigned to a product, for smoke production and flaming droplets and particles. 

2.3.6.6 Thermal conductivity and thermal resistance 

The aim of this section is to analyse the differences in thermal insulation of the developed cork-polymer 

composites and additionally compare their properties with commercial products such as MDF and HDF.  

 

The thermal conductivity and thermal resistance measurements were determined using the Fourier's 

Law that expresses the conductive heat transfer as: 

 

   (2.18) 

 

In equation 2.18, the amount of heat (Q) that passes through a certain sample area (A) in the time t is 

directly proportional to A, to the difference between the temperatures (T1 – T2) of the planes surfaces  of 

the board and to time t and inversely to the thickness of the measured sample e [73]. K is the 

coefficient of thermal conductivity that is measured in watts per meter kelvin (W/m.K). 

 

In many construction materials are composed by several layers that are joint together by stitching or by 

fusion. In all cases, the way the individual layers are connected substantially affects the resulting 

thermal properties of the final construct. The total thermal resistance (Rt) is a thermal-property of a 

material to resist the flow of heat and is given by the equation [74]: 

 

    (2.19) 

 

This parameter, calculated from the total thickness h1 and the resulting thermal conductivity, cannot 

always be considered as the algebraic sum of the thermic resistance of the individual layers. 

 

The thermal conductivity (?) of the processed board materials with 2 and 6mm of thickness were 

determined using the Alambeta instrument. In the present test the equipment was calibrated to use the 

following temperatures: T1 = temperature of the plane surface at 32 ºC and T2 = temperature of the

plane surface at 20 ºC. The sample thickness was automatically measured under constant pressure, 

which can be pre-set from 100 to 1000 Pa.

Abstract 

The cork industry produces high amounts of cork powders resulting from the final stages of cork 

processing or resulting from existing cork products. Usually these powders are burned and served to 

boilers in industrial processes. The main goal of this work is to transform this cork sub-product into a 

highly value composite product. The real value is dependent on the mechanical performance of this 

product. Thus the mixture between cork and thermoplastics, particularly the improvement of interfacial 

bonding, is an important topic, which needs to be developed. The interfacial affinity can be greatly 

increased, applying superficial modification of one of the components, or by the use of coupling agents. 

In this work, a high amount of cork powder (50wt.%) from different origins combined with different 

thermoplastic materials using melt based processes has been examined. Pultrusion was used to 

produce pellets and compression moulding to obtain boards to determine its properties. Coupling 

agents based on maleic anhydride (2wt.%) improved the tensile strength successfully, while the cork 

powder has an a important role in the stiffness. The morphology of the surface fractures indicated a 

good dispersion of the cork and a good adhesion between both phases. Thermal properties of the 

composites disclosed a nucleating effect promoted by cork.

3.1 Introduction 

Cork is the outer bark of an oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L. which is periodically 

extracted from the tree, usually every nine to twelve years, depending on the culture region [1-3]. Cork 

presents a homogeneous tissue of thin-walled cells, regularly arranged without intercellular space [3, 4]. 

The cells are rectangular prisms, mostly pentagonal and hexagonal like a honeycomb structure (see 

Figure 3.1), with their axes along the tree’s radial direction, stacked in columns [4, 5]. Like wood, cork 

is a lignocellulosic material were suberin an aliphatic polyester is the main chemical component of cork 

cell walls 30 - 50% [2, 6, 7] that is not present in wood cell walls. This anisotropic material has a unique 

combination of properties, such as a high coefficient of friction [8], resilience, imperviousness to liquids 

(excellent sealing ability), low thermal conductivity, low density [1], high energy absorption, excellent 

insulation properties, near-zero Poisson coefficient [9], fire resistant, among others, that makes it a 

adequate material for a variety of applications [3, 5, 10]. Every second, an area of rain forest 

corresponding to 19 tennis courts is lost [11], where the cork-tree offers the advantage of remain the 

only tree whose bark can regenerate itself after harvest, it is truly a renewable, environmentally friendly 

resource [2, 12].

The most important sub-product provided from the different processes of cork industry is the cork 

powder, which possesses a high heating value, serving as raw material to feed the boilers in industrial 

processes [3, 13] but its commercial value is insignificant. There exist diverse types of cork powders 

that present different features. The most important are: the grinding powder, from granulation or pre-

performance

grinding; the cleaning powder, without impurities; the finishing powder from cut and sanding operations  

or from cork disks and natural stoppers and finally the “burning powder” that comes from the mixture 

of these powders [13]. The degradation of cork is strongly dependent on temperature and mass losses 

become significant at 200 ºC [14] and the colour start to change to dark brown and at 300 ºC to black 

[15]. At lower temperatures 75 – 85 ºC, only a phase transition was assigned to the melting of waxes 

present in cork obtained by DSC that was corroborated by dielectric spectroscopy [16, 17].  

The aesthetical nature, the touch and the feeling of comfort promoted by the cork is also valued in 

several applications [18, 19] were its combination with other materials can improve their performance.  

Cork combined with polymers leads to composites with novel properties and presents a new field of 

applications that contributes for the sustainability of the forestry sector.  Cork-polymer composite (CPC) 

materials intend to combine the engineering properties of the thermoplastics with the unique described 

advantages of this natural origin material trough appropriated melt based technologies in order to 

develop products with new shapes from theses that cork can provide for acoustic, thermal insulation, 

energy absorbing or aesthetic applications. Earlier the industry saw in this natural material potential to 

be used in melt based technologies like extrusion [20-22] or to create a wood substitute material [22].  

In a study performed by  Barlow and Ashby [23], cork powders were mixed with different binding agents 

with a thermoplastic, a thermoset and a silicone rubber matrixes to create CPC. The mechanical 

performance of the composites decreases with the increase of cork content. 

In the last years there was an increasing interest on the CPC materials [24-27] for different uses. 

Another study combines polypropylene with cork that was previously submitted to a surface 

modification to improve cork-matrix adhesion, based on a water treatment at room temperature during 

1-3 h [28] and  more recently some applications are looking to the valorisation of the cork powders [29-

31]. The improvement of interfacial bonding, between the cork and the matrix is a field that needs to be 

further developed, for example by using superficial modification of one of the components or by the use 

of coupling agents. In other polymeric composites based on wood several studies propose different 

strategies to increase the interfacial adhesion  between the different composite phases[32, 33]. The use 

of these kinds of methodologies has been scarce in materials containing cork.  

 

In this study, cork powder with different qualities were mixed in high amounts (50wt.%), and were

were compressed moulded to obtain boards with a high dimensional stability. The effect of two coupling

agents based on a low percentage (2wt%) of maleic anhydride was analysed. The coupling agents were 

applied to promote adhesion between the cork-polyolefin phases, to improve tensile strength and the 

cork dispersion. 

3.2 Experimental section 

3.2.1 Cork materials 

Several cork powders, from cork processing stages were collected at the Amorim Revestimentos S.A. 

(Portugal) industrial facilities. All of them are cork based powders coming from the processing industries 

namely, grinding powder, or sanding powder, external powder, cork style powder and floating powder, 

with density raging from 157 to 400kg.m-3.  

Grinding powder is mainly composed by the outer bark. This sub-product is characterized by having 

high density and dark brown colour (Figure 3.2), resembling the wood bark in its visual aspect. 

Moreover, this powder presents contaminations with silica from the sandpaper, resins, varnish and 

paint pigments due to the incorporation of materials for recycling.  

Sanding/external powder is mainly composed of cork particles of good quality and low density. It may 

also present some contaminations with resins from the agglomeration glues and glue from the 

decorative process and some silica from the sandpaper but in very low amounts.  

Corkstyle® powder is composed of high density fibreboard (HDF) formed during the machining process 

of the dock and cork, with a greater amount of HDF powder. The density is very similar compared with 

the floating powder.  

Floating powder consists of cork and HDF particles. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles are also presents 

in small amounts. Some varnish, paint pigments, resin and sinter bonding motifs may be present.

3.2.2 Polymer materials and coupling agents 

A commercially available polyethylene (HMA – 025), PE, with a MFI of 8.2 g 10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg). 

A polypropylene homopolymer (1374 E2), PP, with a MFI of 20.8 g 10min-1 (200 ºC, 2.16 kg). Both 

polymers were supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany).  

A mixture of recycled polyolefins in the grinding form with a MFI of 2.4 g 10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), 

provided by Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH and Co., Germany was also used for the preparation of 

composites. All tests of melt flow index were carried out according to ISO 1133.  

Two different coupling agents based on maleic anhydride were used: 102 – 1 K1 MDEX for 

polyethylene and Po 1020 K1 for polypropylene respectively, supplied by A. Schulman GmbH, Germany. 

3.2.3 Composites processing 

The prepared compositions and processing conditions are summarized in Table 3.1. Before 

compounding all raw materials were pre-dried at 70 ºC over night to stabilise the cork powders in terms 

of moisture content. 

The different cork powders were mixed with the thermoplastics (in 50-50 wt.% ratio) in the dry form and 

further compounded in an industrial pultrusion system (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany) to obtain cork-

polymer composite pellets (Pallmann Maschinenfabrik GmbH and Co., Germany).  

In a further step, compression moulding of the obtained pellets using a hydraulic press from (Moore, 

UK) was applied to produce boards with 3mm of thickness from the different compositions. The mould 

temperature was around 150 – 170 ºC depending on the thermoplastic matrix and the pressure was 

1.42 MPa.  

Tensile bars were obtained from these boards using a CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). 

The specimens had a neck cross-section area of 3 mm × 4 mm and a gage length of 20mm. The 

specimens were produced according ISO 527–2. Nevertheless, its thickness is slightly higher (3mm) 

than the standard.

3.2.4 Cork and pellets density and humidity 

3.2.4.1 Cork density 

The bulk density of the different cork powders was determined using a volumetric flask of 500ml were it 

was placed and compacted the material to minimise the possible empty spaces between the particles.  



Chapter 3 – Cork based composites using polyolefins’s as matrix: morphology and mechanical 

performance 

 

125 

 

    (3.1) 

 

The equation 3.1 was applied for density calculations were, d is the specific weight (Kg/m3) of the cork 

raw material, m is the weight of the compact cork powder and v is the volume occupied by the cork 

powder into the volumetric flask. Three measurements were performed for each cork powder. The 

specific weight results and respective standard deviation are presented in Table 3.2. 

3.2.4.2 Pellets apparent density 

The apparent density of the different composite pellets, obtained after pultusion, was determined using 

the liquid displacement method based on the Archimedes principle. By this method, the volume of the 

sample is estimated by the mass of the volume that is displaced when the sample is submerged in a 

liquid. Thus, cork-polymer pellet samples weighting between 7 and 11g (the weight was determined 

with a precision nearest to 0.0001g) were it was added distillate water to fulfil the empty spaces 

between the pellets. Special care was taken to avoid the presence of air bubbles. This procedure was 

performed three times for each condition. 

3.2.4.3 Moisture 

The percentage of humidity of the different cork powders was determined using a balance Sartorius 

(Sartorius AG, Germany) were the cork powder was submitted to 105 ºC during a period of 10min. This 

procedure was performed three times for each cork powder sample and the results are presented in 

Table 3.2. 

3.2.5 Scanning electron microscopy 

The morphological characterization of the developed cork-polymer composites fracture surface was 

performed using a Leica-Cambridge S-360 (UK) scanning electron microscope. All the samples were 

sputter-coated with gold before being analysed. The cork powders were analysed using a Quanta 400 

FEG model (FEI, USA) ambiental scanning electron microscope with low vacuum to avoid any possible 

desire effect in the natural raw material structure. 



Chapter 3 – Cork based composites using polyolefins’s as matrix: morphology and mechanical 

performance 

 

126 

3.2.6 Thermal properties 

The differential scanning calorimetric experiments were performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model 

(USA), using a refrigerated cooling system and nitrogen as a purge gas (flux gas of ca. 50 ml min?1). 

Both temperature and heat flux were calibrated with Indium at a scanning rate of 10 ºCmin?1. The 

samples were obtained by cutting a small piece of material (with 5 to 5.5 mg weight) in the central 

region of the composite pellets parts. An effort was made to maintain the geometry of the different 

samples, in order to keep the same thermal resistance. All the experiments were performed at 10 

ºCmin?1, starting from room temperature. Only the second run was analyzed for melting temperature 

(Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm), which reflects the effect of the cork material contained in the 

composite avoiding the morphology effect developed during the processing. The crystallinity values of 

the polymeric phase were determined from the cooling cycle using the following equation:  

 

Degree of Crystallinity (%) = (?Hm /?Hm°) ×100    (3.2) 

 

Where, ?Hm is the melting enthalpy of the polymer and ?Hm° is the enthalpy of 100 % crystalline PP 

(?Hm° = 209 J/g) [34]. 

3.2.7 Optical microscopy 

To understand the nucleating ability of cork on the matrix, a single cork powder was sandwiched 

between two thin PP films and heated at 200 ºC during 10 min to erase the previous thermal history of 

the sample. Then, the sample was quickly shifted to a well-controlled temperature stage (Linkam, 

THMS-600) where the pre-determined crystallization temperature was maintained at 140 ºC for 1 h, to 

access to the crystallization process. A fast cooling was estimated to be 80 ºC min-1 was used to reach 

the isothermal crystallization temperature. Dry nitrogen was introduced to eliminate any possible 

degradation in all cases. The crystallization of PP on the cork powder was observed on an optical 

microscope (Olympus B) connected to a Leica digital camera. 

3.2.8 Mechanical properties and statistical analysis 

The tensile properties were determined using a Universal tensile testing machine (Instron 4505 

Universal Machine, USA) using a load cell of 1 KN. The tensile force was taken as the maximum force 



Chapter 3 – Cork based composites using polyolefins’s as matrix: morphology and mechanical 

performance 

 

127 

in the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress–strain 

curve (between 0.05% and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were conditioned at 

room temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A crosshead speed of 5mm min?1 was used up to a 

deformation at break. The average and standard deviations were determined using seven specimens. 

The normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test 

confirming their normal distribution at p&amp;lt;0.05. The results were compared using a two-sample t-test 

and differences were considered significantly different at p&lt;0.05 (*). 

3.3 Results and Discussion 

3.3.1 Characterization of the cork powders 

The different cork powders used on this study were physically and morphologically characterized before 

compounding. The used powders and some of their characteristics are presented in Table 3.2 and in 

Figure 3.2. Since the sanding powder and the external powder are very similar, a mixture of the referred 

powders was used in the work. Of the analysed cork powders, the grinding powder was the one with 

higher specific weight (409 ± 6 kg m-3). This residual powder was also the one with the highest moisture 

content (18%) probably due to the presence of the wood present from the outer bark that is more 

hydrophilic than cork. 

The sanding/external powder is the powder with lowest specific weight (157 ± 2 kg m-3) and lower range 

of particle size distribution (60% of particle size less than 0.25mm). This material was also the one 

presenting the lowest humidity (around 5.4%). 

The Corkstyle® powder and the floating powder presents a specific weight of 273 ± 6 kg m-3 and 256 ± 7 

kg m-3 respectively. In terms of humidity the values are very similar and regarding the particle size 

distribution, the floating powder has a higher content of small particles (around 58%) less than 0.25 

mm. Table 3.2 also reports the humidity present in the different powders before the preparation of the 

composite materials. Since the cork sub-products tend to absorb moisture, all the natural raw materials 

were pre-dried overnight in a vacuum oven to stabilize. The percentage of humidity present was around 

2.65 - 4.18%.

3.3.2 Composite morphology 

Fracture surfaces after mechanical tests of the cork-polymer composites, obtained by scanning electron 

microscopy, are shown in Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3. Morphology of the tensile-fracture surface of cork polymer composites. Figure a and b: PP-

SP2; c and d: RP-SP1; e and f: PE-SP2. 

 

In the micrographs is possible to observe the good dispersion of cork sanding powder in the different 

thermoplastic matrixes. At high magnifications the fracture surface of cork sanding powder with PP and 

2wt% of coupling agent (Figure 3.3 b) indicates good adhesion between both phases of the composite.  

The same behaviour was observe for the PE matrix (Figure 3.3 e and f); while the cork sanding powder 

mixture with the recycled polymers at a high magnifications (Figure 3.3 d) demonstrate some pull out of 

the polymeric phase and some regions with gap between both phases. This may be due to the lower 

mechanical properties of this matrix since is a mixture of different grade of recycled plastics that could 

contain some impurities and due to the absence of coupling agent to improve the interface bonding.

3.3.3 Pellets density 

Figure 3.4 indicates the apparent density of the cork-polymer composite pellets after the pultrusion 

process for all tested compositions presented in Table 3.1. The results indicate an important decrease 

in the density compared with the density of the matrix PE (964 kg m-3) and PP (900 kg m-3). 

 

 

Figure 3.4. Density of the CPC pellets after the pultrusion process. 

 

The pellets density is around 580-630 kg m-3 except for grinding cork powder with higher specific weight 

(see Table 3.2). The higher the density of the cork powder the superior is the density of the pellet 

composite. The production of composites by pultrusion process using high amounts of cork powder 

allows obtaining light weight composite materials. After compression moulding process of the pellets 

the final density of the composites is higher and very similar (1000 to 1060 kg m-3) independently of the 

cork sub-product used. 

3.3.4 Crystallization and melting properties 

Thermal properties of all materials prepared were investigated by DSC. Representative DSC curves for 

the composites and pure PP are shown in Figure 3.5. The results are summarized in Table 3.3.

Figure 3.5. Representative DSC thermograms, obtained at 10ºCmin?1 of the CPC materials using PP as 

matrix of the composite (a) second heating step and (b) first cooling step. 

 

Pure PP presents a onset crystallization temperature (Tc) of 119.7 ºC. Comparing the pure PP with the 

cork-polymer composites, the Tc shifted to higher temperatures in the case of the composites. The 

increase of Tc could be considered to be due to the nucleation effect of cork present in the composites.  

Melting temperatures (Tm) of pure PP was 153.5 ºC. The Tms of the PP was not significantly affected by 

the addition of cork during the pultrusion process. Therefore, the addition of cork powders in PP does 

not have a significant influence on the thickness of the crystalline lamellar of the matrix. Values of ?Hm 

provide important information about the crystallinity and shows significant variations in the composites. 

These results lead us to conclude that the addition of cork powder increases the crystallinity of the 

polymer in the most part of the compositions.

3.3.5 Optical microscopy 

Figure 3.6 presents the initial crystallization process of PP in the presence of the cork powder particle. 

The results suggest that this process takes place preferably at the surface sites of cork. Nevertheless 

once can observe simultaneously with this process the growth of individual of spherulites in the matrix. 

When cork is embedded into a thermoplastic melt it may act as a nucleating agent during the 

crystallization process. The result is more evident on Figure 3.6 c) in polarized light where it confirms 

the high number of spherulites around the cork. This nucleation effect is different from other fibres used 

in composites. In this case no transcrystalline layer on the cork usually found in semicrystalline 

thermoplastic composites with different synthetic or natural fibres [35-37] was observed. The present 

effect it is in accordance with the previous DSC results indicating the nucleation ability of cork.

3.3.6 Mechanical properties of composites 

In order to characterize the mechanical performance of the developed cork based composites, tensile 

tests were performed. Figure 3.7and Figure 3.8 summarizes the obtained results, in terms of tensile 

modulus and maximum tensile stress, for composites prepared with PP and PE matrices, respectively. 

One formulation consisting of recycled polyolefin’s and cork sanding powder was also compounded and 

characterized (Figure 3.8). All results are expressed as means ± standard deviation.

non-significant at 0.05. 

 

Considering the data from both Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8, it is clear that composites prepared using PP 

as matrix are the ones with better mechanical performance, being the condition PP-GP1 the one with 

the highest stiffness and strength absolute values.

significant at 0.05; ns: non-significant at 0.05.: 

 

Two reasons can be used to explain the better performance of this composition: (i) pure PP has better 

mechanical properties than PE; (ii) the grinding powder (Fig. 2) is mainly composed of the outer bark 

that is denser and very similar to wood and could work as a more effective reinforcement. In general, 

composites from PP exhibited mean tensile modulus and maximum stress values respectively in the 

intervals [523.6 – 650.5] MPa and [13.0 – 18.7] MPa, depending on the type of cork powder used. 



Chapter 3 – Cork based composites using polyolefins’s as matrix: morphology and mechanical 

performance 

 

136 

Composites prepared using PE as matrix and the different cork based powders displayed mean 

compressive modulus and maximum stress values respectively in the intervals [365.3 – 545.8] MPa 

and [12.4 – 16.0] MPa. Almost no correlation between the type of cork powders used and the final 

mechanical performance of the composites was observed. 

Considering the formulation with best performance for each type of matrix used, the addition of 50 wt.% 

of cork powder in the most part of the compositions did not affect significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) the modulus of 

the final product, especially for the composites prepared with PP. Nevertheless, a decrease higher than 

~50% on the strength was noticed.   

As expected, the addition of a small amount (only 2 wt.%) of coupling agents (102 – 1 K1 MDEX for PE 

and Po 1020 K1 for PP) resulted in a significantly improvement (p&amp;lt;0.05) of the mechanical 

performance in all the formulations studied. This effect is more pronounced on the strength of 

composites prepared using PP as matrix and increases up to 40.9 % (condition PP-FP2) were achieved 

with the addition of Po 1020 K1 coupling agent. This is a clear indication that the use of a coupling 

agent improved the interfacial adhesion between the matrix (PP or PE) and the cork based powder 

used. Several studies on the literature report the positive effect of using coupling agents on the 

mechanical properties of composites [31, 33]. 

3.4 Conclusions 

The following conclusions can be made base on the results presented in this work. SEM observation 

revealed well dispersed cork powders in the compression moulded samples after the pultrusion (pellets) 

and compression moulding processes. As expected, the tensile modulus and tensile strengths were 

significantly increased in the composites with the introduction low amounts (2 wt.%) of coupling agents 

to promote the adhesion between the cork-polymer phases. No significantly correlation between the 

type of cork powders used and the mechanical performance of the composites was observed. Cork 

powders that presents some wood particles induces similar stiffness only in the PP matrix, probably 

because the powder composition is based on outer bark and has higher density. The recycled polymer 

based on polyolefin’s combined with the cork sanding powder reveal the lowest mechanical 

performance. The increase of the crystallinity on the composites occurred due to the addition of the 

cork powder, where cork presents a nucleation effect. By polarized optical microscopy it was confirmed 

that cork accelerates the crystallization process. The results of the present work clearly show that cork 

powders and polyolefin’s can be successfully used to produce CPC with high cork content. In order to 



Chapter 3 – Cork based composites using polyolefins’s as matrix: morphology and mechanical 

performance

obtain cork based composite materials with enhanced mechanical properties, reinforcement strategies 

must be taken in consideration.

Abstract 

Cork powder (50 wt%) was mixed with polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE)  by pultrusion aiming to 

prepare cork-based composites. In a further step, samples were produced by compression moulding 

using the compounded composites. Bending strength, impact resistance, hardness, dimensional 

stability, thermal and acoustic properties of the developed cork-polymer composites (CPC) were 

determined and compared with commercially available products namely medium density fibreboard 

(MDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF). It was found that the CPC have good dimensional stability, 

lower water uptake, a better acoustic insulation performance and similar behaviour in terms of 

hardness and fire resistance when compared with both MDF and HDF. However, the mechanical 

strength is inferior comparing with both commercial materials based on fibres. It was also observed that 

addition of cork improved the flexural modulus, impact resistance and hardness on the developed CPC. 

Thus, the herein described CPC materials showed important characteristics to be considered as good 

candidates to be applied in the design of flooring and construction systems.

4.1 Introduction 

Wood polymer composites (WPC), have successfully proven their applicability in several fields, 

particularly in the construction sector, due to their aesthetics (similar to wood), easy processability and 

low maintenance costs [1]. The use of lingocellulosics materials as fillers and reinforcement with 

thermoplastics has been gaining acceptance in commodity plastic applications [2]. Similar to wood, 

cork is a natural, renewable and sustainable raw material [3-5] with an unexploited potential to be used 

on the development of partially or completely natural based composites [6-9].  

Cork is the bark of an Oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L. [10] which is periodically 

extracted from the tree, usually every nine to twelve years, depending on the culture region and is of the 

highest importance for the forest economy of the Southern European countries and China [4, 10]. The 

cork-tree offers the advantage of being the only tree whose bark can regenerate itself after harvest, 

making it a truly renewable material. In terms of morphology, cork can be described as an anisotropic 

material with close cellular structure and thin-walled cells. Furthermore, cork presents a alveolar 

structure similar to a honeycomb according the radial direction and in the other directions 

(transversally) is a isotropic material where the cells are described as rectangular prisms packed base 

to base in columns parallel to the radial direction of the tree [11, 12]. A thickness of 1mm corresponds 

about thirty layers of cells [13].  

Cork can be seen as a natural composite constituted by different groups of compounds. The chemical 

composition includes [4, 10]: suberin, an aliphatic polyester, usually present in high concentrations 33-

50%; lignin, an aromatic polymer, corresponding to the second most abundant structure in cork with 

13-29%; polysaccharides, including cellulose and hemicelluloses, that are usually present at 

concentrations in the range of 6-25%; and the extractable components at concentrations in the range 

8.5-24%.  

The structural properties of lingocellulosic materials like cork are strongly dependent on temperature. 

Thermal decomposition of cork has been studied by thermogravimetry [14] and the results have shown 

that the mass decreases about 30% upon heating at 300ºC and less than 10% at 200ºC [15]. It was 

also observed that the chemical degradation starts at about 250ºC, in air, indicating that cork can be 

heated up to 250ºC without inducing irreversible changes in its composition. Chemical methods [16, 

17] and scanning electron microscopy [16] were also applied and the results demonstrated that waxes 

and other soluble components of cork begin to decompose at ca. 150ºC and that cork is transformed 



Chapter 4 – Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with 

commercial available fibreboard materials 

 

144 

into ash for temperatures above 450ºC. Polysaccharides are considered the most heat sensitive 

component of cork [18]. Mass spectroscopy [19] and 13C solid-state NMR studies [17] reveal that at 

400°C cork has been transformed into coke with traces of partially decomposed suberin. 

The most important sub-products resulting from cork manufacturing are different types of cork powders. 

Part of these powders are used as fuel on industrial furnaces, while the remaining portions are usually 

disposed in landfills [20, 21]. The strategy of combining cork powder with polymeric matrixes [9, 21, 

22], to produce composites, has received little attention by the research community. However, cork 

properties can provide several advantages in the development of composites containing bio-based 

components. Among other advantages, cork has a low density (120 – 240 kg m-3), can be regarded as 

a hydrophobic and viscoelastic material, that possess high thermal and acoustic insulation properties, 

low thermal conductivity, fire resistance, aesthetic features and resistance to microbial activity [3, 4, 13, 

23]. Moreover, cork powder is widely available, sustainable, recyclable and of low cost. 

The development of appropriated methodologies for the valorisation of this bio-based resource is of high 

interest [9]. In this work two melt based technologies were used to produce cork-polymer composites 

(CPC) materials: pultrusion to compound and obtain pellets of two different composites (cork powder + 

PP and cork powder + PE, in both cases a 50/50 wt.% ratio was used) and compression moulding to 

produce boards with adequate characteristics to be applied as core in flooring systems, furniture and 

building applications. The use of a core based on CPC in alternative to the MDF could be regarded as a 

new type of flooring able to compete in the field of the floating floor coverings. For instance, wood-

plastic composites have shown distinctly better behaviour than the MDF and natural wood after 

moisture exposure [24]. The growing of environmental awareness has resulted in a renewed interest in 

the use of natural materials with environmentally friendly characteristics [25]. Formaldehyde-based 

adhesives are currently used for fibreboard manufacture where the major drawback of using this resin 

is the presence of volatile organic compounds harmful to human health [26, 27].  

In this study, different boards - produced using the CPC composites, the MDF and the HDF - were 

submitted to extensive characterization tests and the obtained results compared. The main goal was to 

prove and validate the potential of using the cork-based composites on the production of boards as core 

for floating floor coverings application. We selected to test MDF and HDF boards as control since they 

are the most widely used wood composites applied as building material, housing furniture and in 

laminated flooring [26-28].

4.2 Experimental section 

4.2.1 Cork powder and fibre materials 

The cork powder resulting from cork processing stages such as, sanding and external operations, was 

collected at Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (Oleiros, Portugal) industrial facilities. The cork powder 

presents a particle size of ? 250 µm, bulk density of 157 ± 2 kg m-3 and a humidity of ~5.4%. It was 

also used two different types of fibreboard materials as control: HDF with density of 920.3 ± 6.7 kg m-3 

and MDF with density of 822.7 ± 2.7 kg m-3 both of them with a resin content of 8 wt.% and supplied by 

Sonae Industria SGPS, S.A (Maia, Portugal). 

4.2.2 Polymeric materials 

A commercially available high density polyethylene (HMA – 025), HDPE, containing a thermal stabilizer 

and with a MFI of 8 g 10 min-1 and a polypropylene homopolymer (1374 E2), PP, with a MFI of 21 g 10 

min-1 were used on composites preparation. Both polymers were supplied by Exxon Mobil (Germany). 

More details on the properties of these polymers are reported in Table 4.1.

4.2.3 Composites processing 

Before compounding all raw materials were dried (at 70 ºC) over night in a vacuum oven (Binder, 

Germany). Before compounding the moisture content on the cork powder was ? 3 %. Two different cork-

based composites – one consisting of cork powder with PE and other consisting of cork powder with PP 

(in both cases 50-50 wt.% ratio was maintained) – were compounded using an industrial pultrusion 

system (Palltruder PFV 250, Germany). The CPC consisting of HDPE with cork powder will be referred 

as PE/Cork and the one from PP and cork powder as PP/Cork. 

The composites, as pellets, were further compression-moulded using a Moore hydraulic press (UK) to 

produce rectangular boards of 220?220?6 mm3. The principal processing conditions are reported in 

Table 4.2 and are similar to the ones used in previous work [9]. Flexural, impact and tensile bars were 

cut from these boards using a CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK).

4.2.4 Dimensional stability tests 

A Aiming to study the dimensional stability of the different materials, water absorption and thickness 

swelling tests were conducted according the ASTM D 570 [29]. To determine the water absorption, 

specimens (measuring 6mm in thickness, 60mm wide and 90 mm long) from the different materials 

were immersed in distilled water, at 23 ± 1 ºC and atmospheric pressure, for different time periods (up 

to 11 days). In the end of each time period, five specimens of each material were removed, gently 

blotted with tissue paper to remove the excess water on the surface and immediately weighed. The 

water absorption was calculated according to the Eq. (4.1):

where Wa = weight of the specimen after being immersed for a certain period of time and Wb = weight of

To determine thickness swelling after immersion, the thickness of each immersed specimen was 

measured in two different points using a digital micrometer (± 0.01 mm). The thickness swelling was 

calculated as follows:

where T2 = thickness of the specimen after immersion and T1 = thickness of the same specimen before

4.2.5 Warping and density 

Warping can result from an inferior product construction, wrong choice of materials or inadequate 

processing routes. Other reason that can cause this effect is the high moisture content in the air. After 

processing, CPC boards (220?220?6 mm3) obtained by compression moulding were submitted to a 

specific test to access the possible occurrence of warping effect. The obtained results were compared 

with the commercial fibreboard composites cut with the same dimensions. In Figure 4.1 is shown a 

schematic illustration of the performed test. Figure 4.1 a) shows the used system with a pointer p with 

precision capability of 0.01 mm of displacement.

148 

 

Two perpendicular measurements in each board were performed according the indicated directions a 

and b. At least 15 boards (in dry state) of each condition were analysed to evaluate the warping effect. 

The density of the materials was determined according the ASTM D 792 – 00 [30], using an analytical 

balance equipped with a stationary support for the immersion vessel. Five specimens were weighted 

per each sample. 

4.2.6 Mechanical tests 

The mechanical properties of the developed cork-based composites were determined performing 

flexural and impact tests. In more detail, three point static flexural tests were carried out in accordance 

with standard ISO 178 [31]. The dimensions of the specimens used were 120 mm length, 15 mm 

width and 6 mm thick. The load was placed midway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. 

The crosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. These tested were performed in an Instron 4505 Universal 

Machine (USA) equipped with a 1 kN cell load. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the 

core break. The Charpy impact tests were performed according the standard ISO 179-1 [32] on a Ceast 

Fractovis (Pianezza, Italy) instrumented falling weight impact tester with a pendulum energy of 2 J. The 

notched specimens were rectangular bars with 120 mm length, 12 mm width and 6 mm thick.  The 

hardness was determined by Shore-D Hardnes Tester (model bareiss – Prüfgeräte, Germany). For each 

sample, the value of Shore-D was calculated as the average of 10 indentations. All performed tests were 

carried out in a standard laboratory atmosphere of 23ºC and 50% of relative humidity and seven 

specimens of each material were tested. 

4.2.7 Morphology 

To investigate cork distribution on the composite matrix and the fibreboard specimens, the fracture 

surface was analysed using a stereoscopic lens microscope Olympus SZ-PT (Tokyo, Japan) equipped 

with a light source Olympus Europe Highlight 2000, (Germany) and an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital 

camera.  

For more detailed analysis of the microstructure of the cork-polymer phases, fracture surfaces of the 

different specimens were examined using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron 

microscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd 

alloy (80-20 wt.%) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK).

commercial available fibreboard materials 

 

149 

4.2.8 Thermal properties 

The thermal stability studies, determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to 

understand the degradation characteristics of the specimens using a TGA Q500 series 

thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in platinum pan, at a 

heating rate of 10 °C.min-1 from 50 °C to 600 °C in air atmosphere. Analyses were performed in two 

samples of each condition.  

4.2.9 Fire resistance 

In designing building materials, fire resistance classification of the product is one of the most important 

features. Single flame fire tests were carried out according to the standard ISO 11925-2 [33]. The 

single flame source test was performed in specimens with dimensions of 188 x 119 mm2 and 6 mm 

thick. The specimen was held vertically and a flame was applied from the bottom edge of the specimen 

becoming more aggressive effect on the materials. According to the standard a burning time of 15 to 

20 seconds was applied and the burning dimensions after the test were registered. Three specimens 

were tested for each composite. The fire resistance classification was attributed according of the 

standard fire test of building materials EN ISO 13501-1 [34]. 

4.2.10 Acoustic tests 

The building elements for acoustic tests consisted on a superior element from CPC or fibreboard with 

dimensions of 220X220X6 mm3 and an agglomerated cork underlay with thickness of 1.8 mm thick. 

Commercially available silicone glue (thickness of 0.5-0.6mm) was used to fix the agglomerated cork 

underlay to the previously produced boards (CPC, HDF and MDF boards).The aim of including this 

agglomerated cork underlay was to avoid reverberation sound and fix the boards. The pavement was 

submitted to a uniformly distributed load (20 to 25 kg m-2). The tests were conduct in a reverberant 

chamber with a 7.25 m length, 5.88 m width, 4.65 m height and a volume of 202 m3. The tests occur 

at atmospheric conditions 22 ºC and 66 % of humidity. The equipment used for the measurements was 

a tapping machine Brüel &amp;amp; Kjaer (B&amp;amp;K, Germany) Type 3204; B&amp;amp;K 2260 dual channel real-time 

frequency analyser and B&amp;amp;K 13 mm microphone model 4189. The microphone height was about 1.4 

m. The measurements of sound insulation were performed according the standard EN ISO 140-8 [35] 

and 717-2 [36]. The measurements were taken at three locations of the tapping machine relative to the

floor sample area of 2 m2 and 5 positions of microphone with to different lectures using one-third-octave 

bands, 100 Hz to 4200 Hz. The reduction of impact noise by floor covering on standard floor was 

determined according the equation 4.3: 

 

nn

where, ? L  is the reduction of impact sound pressure level, Ln,0 is the normalized impact sound 

pressure level in the absence of floor covering and Ln is the normalized impact sound pressure level 

with floor covering. The impact sound improvement index (?Lw) was determined according to the 

standard EN ISO 717-2 [36]. 

4.3 Results and discussion 

4.3.1 Dimensional stability tests 

The results from the water absorption and thickness swelling tests are shown in Figure 4.2 and Figure 

4.3 respectively. In the first 6h of immersion, the fibreboards samples absorbed 10.8 ± 0.4 % (HDF 

boards) and 14.8 ± 0.8 % (MDF boards). In the first 48 h of immersion the CPC samples absorbed less 

than 1% of water while the HDF and MDF ones absorbed 32.7 ± 1.5 % and 49.7 ± 0.7 % respectively. 

Moreover, after 11 days of immersion the maximum water absorption percentage of the developed CPC 

boards was 3.7 ± 0.6 % (for the PP/Cork) whereas the HDF and MDF boards absorbed, respectively, 

77.9 ± 2.4 % and 125.6 ± 0.9 %. These differences (more than 70%) can be explained by the high 

amount of polyolefin (50 wt.%) present in the CPC composition since, the non-polar polyolefin absorbs 

no or little water amount [25, 37] and the inner volume accessible for water and oxygen is essentially 

zero [38].

Figure 4.2. Water absorption behaviour for the tested specimens during the immersion time (a) and 

detail of the water absorption for the cork based composites (b). 

 

Moreover, cork can also be considered a hydrophobic material. These results clearly indicate that CPC 

boards are more hydrophobic and absorb much less moisture than the hydrophilic MDF or HDF ones. 

These results also point out that CPC boards are more suitable to be used on environments where the 

materials are exposed to high moisture content than the control samples. Similar behaviour was 

observed for wood polyolefin composites developed using melt based technologies [39, 40]. Like in 

wood composites, the water absorption in CPC materials occurs due to the presence of fine pores or 

lenticels in the cork particles (capillary absorption) and hydrogen bonding sites, or by some micro-

cracks or gaps in the interface between cork particles and the polymeric matrix. 

The thickness swelling results are shown in Figure 4.3. The values observed for both fibreboards are 

considerably higher than the ones observed for the CPC boards. After an immersion period of 264 

hours, the values of thickness swelling were, respectively, 0.5 ± 0.2 % and 0.8 ± 0.3 % for the PP/Cork 

and PE/Cork based composites, indicating good dimensional stability. On the contrary, for the same 

time period, the thickness swelling values of MDF and HDF were 85.3 ± 1.5 and 44.1 ± 1.0, 



Chapter 4 – Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with

152 

respectively. Moreover, for the fibreboard specimens, thickness swelling values followed a similar trend 

to water absorption behaviour: thickness swelling values increased with the immersion time (Figure 4.3).  

 

 

Figure 4.3. Thickness swelling of the fibreboard materials and the cork based composites during the 

immersion tests. 

 

The CPC materials had a different behaviour: the thickness swelling was very low and the variation 

between the different immersion periods is almost insignificant. As in the water absorption behaviour, 

the low thickness swelling values of CPC materials can be an advantage for its application on the 

development and construction of several products, including its application as core material for 

laminated floor applications. 

4.3.2 Warping and density 

The density and warping values for the different materials are shown in Table 4.3. The warping of the 

control fibreboards was near zero, with the mean value of 0.14% for MDF and 0.18% for the HDF. The 

developed CPC materials registered warping values of 1.26% for PE/Cork and 1.44% for PP/Cork. 

These values, although higher than ones registered for the fibreboards, can be considered small enough 

to classify the developed composites of high dimensional stability. The warping values were reduced 

with the addition of cork powder and are probably related with the crystallinity of the polymeric matrices 

(PP and PE) [38] where the presence of 50 wt.% of cork powder noticeably reduced the warping when it

was applied the compression moulded process. Additionally, thicker areas cooled slower and part 

distortion could occur [41]. In this last case the warping can be reduced by increasing the cooling time 

during the compression moulding process.

The density of the composites ranges from 1017.5 ± 3.3 Kg m-3 for the PP/Cork composites to 1060.6 

± 5.8 Kg m-3 for the PE/Cork composites. These values are higher than the ones observed for the 

fibreboards. To understand this effect is important to note that the cork cell wall density has been 

estimated to be 1200 kg m–3  [3, 4]. Previous work using similar cork-polyolefin formulations [9] 

indicates a bulk density of the CPC pellets after pultrusion  of around 590 ±  11.4 Kg m-3 to 602 ±  13.4 

Kg m-3. The densification occurs in the compression moulding step due to the high applied compression 

force of 1.42MPa. Studies on wood-polyolefin (50-50 wt.%) composites regarding thermal and photo-

oxidative stability indicate that the composite density controls the amount of air oxygen flowing into the 

pores of the composite matrix [38]. The higher density of a composite material blocks the access of 

oxygen and slows the oxidative degradation process. 

4.3.3 Mechanical tests 

Flexural, impact and hardness properties of the different materials were determined and the results are 

shown in Table 4.4. All results are expressed as means ± standard deviation. The flexural strength 

obtained for the fibreboard samples were higher than the results obtained with the CPC materials 

(Figure 4.4). The flexural strength and modulus of the control materials based on fibres where, 

respectively, ~58.9 MPa and ~5.3 GPa for the HDF and ~49.6 MPa and ~4.4 GPa for the MDF. The 

CPC materials presented modulus in the interval [1.8 – 1.3] GPa and strengths in the interval [19.1 –

154 

17.1] MPa. The better mechanical performance of the CPC prepared with PP as matrix was expected 

since this polyolefin has better mechanical properties than the used PE. The lower values observed for 

the CPC samples can be related with the lack of interfacial adhesion and bonding between the matrix 

and the cork powder. Due to this, no stress transfer occurs during deformation resulting in low 

mechanical performance.

Regarding the flexural strain, the differences between the materials are not so evident. The samples 

from PE/Cork are the most ductile of the tested materials with 2.46% deformation, where the MDF 

presents a close value of 2.30%. The high capacity of deformation of polyolefin is well known from the 

literature [42]. However, the addition of high percentages of cork (50 wt.%) reduced the maximum 

strain to less than 3%. The results are in accordance with other composite materials like wood-

thermoplastic composites, where the increase of wood content increases the flexural modulus and 

decreases the flexural strength and maximum strain values of the composites [1, 43].

Figure 4.4. Flexural stress-strain curves of the developed cork based composites and the fibreboard 

materials. 

 

The purpose of the impact tests was to measure and compare the resilience, i.e. the energy absorption 

capacity of the different materials. As expected, the Charpy notched impact strength of fibreboard 

samples, mainly the ones from MDF, exhibited better mechanical properties when compared with the 

developed CPC materials. The neat polymers present the lower value of impact strength of 4.4 kJ m-2 for 

HDPE and of 2.8 kJ m-2 for the PP. Nevertheless, the addition of 50 wt.% of cork powder to the HDPE 

and PP matrices increased, respectively, ~31% and ~51% the impact strength, indicating that the 

presence of cork in the composite reinforces the energy absorption capacity. The cellular and elastic 

structure of cork [3, 4] can be an explanation for these results. Regarding the CPC materials, the 

energy absorption capacity of PP/Cork composite was 20% higher than in the PE/Cork composite. 

Since it was used the same amount of cork powder (50 wt.%) and the processing conditions were 

similar, the higher MFI of PP contributed to a better dispersion of cork powder in the matrix and 

consequently increase in the absorption capacity. In terms of hardness, the specimens present similar 

values, around 49 to 51 Shore D, being the lower value corresponding to PE/cork and the high value to 

MDF material. When cork powder was added, hardness and the flexural modulus increased for both 

cases, probably due to the pultrusion process and the applied pressure of 1.42 MPa during the 

compression moulding process.

4.3.4 Morphology 

The fracture surface, after Charpy notched impact tests, of the studied materials was analysed by 

optical microscopy and the results presented in Figure 4.5.  

 

 

Figure 4.5. Fracture surfaces of the specimens after Charpy notched impact tests with a) PP/Cork (50–

50wt%), b) PE/Cork (50–50wt%), c) HDF and d) MDF.  

 

For both CPC materials, it was observed a good dispersion of the cork powder particles in the polymeric 

matrix. In the case of the CPC with PP matrix it seems that cork distribution is more homogeneous. A 

possible explanation is the higher MFI value of the PP when compared with the MFI of HDPE (see Table 

4.1). The fibreboard materials illustrate the well known fibrous aspect where the fibres are stacked like 

rows. This fibrous morphology is consistent with the previously reported results, namely the higher 

flexural mechanical performance and the ability of water to penetrate on these structures, inducing 

higher thickness swelling variations.  

SEM micrographs from the same fracture surfaces are presented in Figure 4.6. At low magnification 

(Figure 4.6 a and Figure 4.6 b) it is visible the high volume content of cork powder in the CPC materials.

Figure 4.6. Micrographs of the impact fracture surfaces of the (a, c) PE/Cork (50–50wt%) and (b, d) 

PP/Cork (50–50wt%) composites. 

 

The cork powder/polymer weight ratio used for the composites preparation was 50%, but the volume 

this ratio is respectively, 86 % - 14 %, respectively. In Figure 4.6 c is shown the morphology of the 

PE/Cork (50-50 wt.%) material, where is possible to see the stretching of the PE between the cork cell 

walls. The same effect was observed for the CPC with PP matrix (Figure 4.6 d). Both images suggest 

that the surface of the cork particles interacted well with the polymeric matrix since voids or empty 

spaces between the two phases were not detected. 

4.3.5 Thermal properties 

The results of the termogravimetric analysis (TGA), conducted under air atmosphere, and the respective 

derivate (DTG) are shown in Figure 4.7. Relevant data from all materials are summarized in Table 4.5.

curves of the thermograms (b) under air atmosphere. 

 

The cork powder showed an initial region of mass loss between room temperature and 100 ºC that is 

more significant for the two fibreboard materials corresponding to the elimination of water. In the case 

of the fibreboards the moisture content was higher, presenting at 100ºC values of around 6 % 

comparing with 3.4 % in cork. Nevertheless, as described in the literature, at 100 ºC the moisture 

present in cork is not totally eliminated [14]. As expected, the current thermoplastics did not present 

residual moisture and, when combined with cork powder the CPC materials presented a weight loss in 

this region of 0.6 - 0.7 %.

Considering the data presented on Table 4.5, the chemical degradation of cork starts at 258 ºC. This 

result suggests that the cork powder can be processed with polymers having melting temperatures 

lower than this value, such as the used polyolefin’s. However, other effects like colour change of cork, 

promoted by the temperature and the processing time, must be considered. Additionally, results from 

Figure 4.7 have shown that when cork powder is mixed with PP through melt-based technologies the 

thermal stability of the polymer increases. 

Analysing DTG curve from cork powder, two maximum peaks were detected, one at 348 ºC and other at 

458 ºC, being the first one of large intensity. The first peak corresponds to the two major constituents of 

cork (lignin and suberin fractions) and the second one can be attributed to suberin, the most thermal 

resistant component in cork. The polysaccharides composed by cellulose and hemicellulose have 

degradation temperatures in the range between 300 ºC to 400 ºC [44].  

The small values of weight loss (0.76 %) and the high onset temperature (274 ºC) (see Table 4.5) 

obtained for HDPE are consistent with the presence of the thermal stabilizer. Other effect can be 

identified if the DTG values from both CPC are compared. In the case of PE/Cork the decomposition 

temperature peak (Tmax1) occurred at 341 ºC with a weight loss of 28 %. For PP/Cork the Tmax1 occurred 

earlier, at 313ºC with higher weight loss of 59 %.  

Both fibreboard materials showed multi-stepped degradation processes due to the presence of different 

species on their composition (data not shown). Literature described that the pyrolysis of wood begins 

with an early decomposition of hemicelluloses, followed by an early stage of pyrolysis of lignin, where 

the major decomposition temperature is normally attributed to the degradation of the cellulose [45].  

Comparing all the tested materials, the most resistant is HDPE and PE/cork composite, since the used 

thermoplastic composition includes a thermal stabilizer. The fraction of the inorganic components, 

remaining from cork powder or from fibreboards, after exposed to 600 ºC, is minimal being 1% for cork 

powder and less than 0.6 % for the fibreboards. 

4.3.6 Fire resistance 

The burning rates of the two different CPC and fibreboard materials were determined by single flame 

fire test (table 6). The set-up procedure for testing the fire resistance is illustrated in Figure 4.8 a. In this 

test the flame takes contact at the edges of the specimen and start to burn in the vertical direction. 

When the neat HDPE was submitted to the flame (Figure 4.8) the material started dripping after a few

commercial available fibreboard materials 

 

160 

seconds and the integrity of the material was completely lost. The addition of 50 wt.% of cork powder to 

the polymeric matrix improved such behaviour and the composites maintained the integrity during the 

whole test. The presence of cork powder sustained the polymeric phase and acted as a fire retardant 

improving the performance of the composites. This behaviour reinforces and agrees with the results 

obtained with the TGA analysis.  The fire resistance tests conducted on the fibreboards revealed that 

these materials possess a self-extinguishing behaviour after removing the flame. This behaviour was not 

observed for the composite materials since the flame does not extinguish eventually (Figure 4.8c).

after fire test  of the PE/Cork (50–50wt%) specimen (c).

* Fire resistance classification according the standard fire test of building materials BS EN 13501-1. 

 

Small differences in the burnt area were found, being the fibreboard materials the ones with lower 

values. Between the two CPC composites no relevant differences were found. In our opinion, the effect 

of the cork powder is higher and overlaps with the thermal stabilizer in HDPE. 



Chapter 4 – Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with 

commercial available fibreboard materials 

 

161 

The results from the fire resistance tests (Table 4.6) indicated that all tested specimens possess a good 

behaviour regarding fire resistance since all the tested materials had a classification of E. 

4.3.7 Acoustic tests 

By measuring the impact sound pressure level reduction, ?L, of the different board materials (Figure 

4.9), it was possible to compare, as a function of the frequency, the behaviour of the different board 

systems. As expected, the sound pressure level reduction increased as the frequency increased. 

Moreover, it was found that, at high frequencies, the cork-based composite showed better behaviour 

when compared with the commercially fibreboard materials.  

 

 

Figure 4.9. Impact sound reduction ?L vs. frequency due to installation of the tested materials: (?) 

MDF; (?) HDF and (?) PE/Cork (50 – 50 wt%). Experimental results in the 1/3 octave band frequency 

domain. 

 

The impact sound attenuation index (?Lw), is useful for a direct comparison of the reduction in impact 

noise transmission by the floor coverings. The ?Lw values ranged from 18 dB (for MDF and HDF floor 

covering) to 20 dB for the (PE/Cork) floor covering. The obtained values are in the same range of 

values in the literature [46, 47]. The cellular and corrugated structure of cork together with the high 

volume percentage of this natural material (~ 86%) can be the key for the superior ?Lw value of 20 dB. 



Chapter 4 – Properties of new cork-polymer composites: Advantages and drawbacks as compared with 

commercial available fibreboard materials 

 

162 

The board density, which is described as a parameter affecting the sound transmission properties, can 

explain the improved behaviour of the MDF compared with HDF in terms of impact sound reduction 

especially for medium and high frequencies. In the literature is also pointed that the use of urea-

formaldehyde (UF) resin in the fibre based materials can also contribute to additional improvement on 

the acoustic properties [28]. 

In the present work the ?Lw of the all tested floor coverings was influenced by the use of silicon glue to 

fix the cork underlay to the boards. The silicon might also improve the soundproof properties providing 

a small increase on the impact sound attenuation index values for all tested boards. The commercial 

fibreboard tested materials also present a small percentage of UF resin. 

4.4 Conclusions 

The purpose of this study was to compare two different CPC materials with two commercially available 

fibreboard materials and detect its advantages and drawbacks. The obtained results showed the 

potential of this natural-based product on the development of composites with improved characteristics 

namely, low water absorption, fire resistance, impact resistance and insulation properties.  

Both CPC materials compounded by pultrusion and further processed by compression moulding 

presented a good dispersion and distribution of the cork powder particles in the thermoplastic matrix. 

Moreover, the CPCs reveal good dimensional stability with low water absorption in comparison with 

fibreboard materials.  

The mechanical properties of the fibre-based materials were considerably superior compared with the 

ones from the CPCs. With the addition of cork (50 wt.%), the flexural strength and strain were 

considerably reduced and the modulus was improved in both cases. The impact resistance tests 

confirm that the addition of cork powder improved the energy absorption capacity of the used 

polyolefin’s.  

The presence of cork presents the advantage to act as fire retardant in the thermoplastic composite 

materials. The acoustic behaviour revealed that CPC materials possess improved impact sound 

insulation properties, low water absorption and reduced thickness swelling. These materials proved to 

be good candidates to be used as underlay materials on floor applications. The developed cork 

composite materials present some promising properties, although reinforcement strategies to reach to 

higher stiffness and strength could be needed for specific applications.

Abstract 

Cork-polymer composites are one of the most promising fields of cork technology to create materials for 

a sustainable development. In this work, cork particles and powder were compounded with 

polypropylene (PP) by twin-screw extrusion and further processed by injection or compression moulding. 

The obtained PP/Cork injection moulded composites were used to investigate the tensile properties 

before and after water absorption (WA) tests. The addition of polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-

MA) and stearic acid was evaluated. The composites show good distribution and dispersion of cork with 

interesting aesthetic characteristics. Low cork content (5wt.%) reinforces the stiffness of the PP. The 

addition of PP-g-MA up to 8 wt.%  promotes an increase on the tensile strength while the stearic acid 

contributes only with a slight increase on the tensile strain. The thermo-physical properties were 

investigated and the composites present low WA. In general the tensile properties of the composites 

were not significantly affected after the WA tests. Moreover, the WA was found to increase with an 

increase in cork content and was reduced with the PP-g-MA and stearic acid. It was also found, that 

cork act as nucleating agent and promotes antioxidant protection to PP. Both properties ameliorate with 

the increase of the cork content. Low cork content improves the thermal resistance while increasing the 

bio-based component increases the composite density and the thermal conductivity. The maximum 

incorporation of cork on the PP matrix through extrusion process was 93% in volume.

5.1 Introduction 

Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic being widely applied in the industry and is usually combined with 

inorganic particles or fibres aiming to improve its mechanical properties and reduce cost [1]. The 

mostly used inorganic fillers includes talc [2, 3], mica [4], clay [5], calcium carbonate (CaCO3) [6], 

carbon and glass fibres [7, 8]. Combining or replacing the inorganic part by lignocellulosic materials 

would be highly beneficial from the point of view of the environmental sustainability. The rational on 

using lignocellulosic materials as filler and reinforcement of thermoplastic composites relies on its 

advantageous intrinsic properties including low density, low cost, favourable strength/weight, high filling 

levels, renewable and sustainable source, non-toxic, low hardness, low energy consumption, and 

recyclability [9-11]. Potential applications of these eco-friendly composites include automotive, building 

and furniture industry [10].  

Cork is the bark of the cork oak tree (Quercus suber L.) [12-14] and is a natural and complex polymeric 

composite material. Chemically, this plant tissue contains suberin (30-60 %), lignin (19-22 %), 

polysaccharides (12-20 %) and extractives (9-20 %) [13, 14]. Furthermore, cork presents closed cell 

structure and viscoelastic properties, exceptional insulation properties, is chemically inert, fire 

resistance and resistance to microbial decay [13, 15-17]. Nowadays, cork-polymer composites are one 

of the most promising fields under development in the cork industry aiming to create sustainable 

materials. Research involving cork and cork by-products combined with thermoplastics [15, 18, 19], 

thermosets [15, 20] and, more recently, with bio-based matrices [21, 22] can be found in the literature. 

As for other lignocellulosic composites, the final properties of these cork composites are highly 

dependent on the processing conditions. Thus, the final specifications of a cork composite can be 

tailored for a specific application by varying the compounding process, amount and cork particle size, 

chemical or surface treatment and type and amount of coupling agent [15, 23-25]. The ability to stress 

transfer from the thermoplastic matrix to the cork filler or reinforcement will depend essentially of the 

cork-polymer interactions that can be reduced due to the incompatibility between lignocellulosic 

materials and polymeric matrices. To overcome these limitations it is necessary to promote polymer 

modification with polar groups, such as maleic anhydride and their grafted polymers, stearic acid, 

silanes, zirconate, or titanate in order to enhance the adhesion between the polymeric matrix and the 

lignocellulosic component [26-29]. One of the most widely used coupling agents is polypropylene graft 

maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). It is pointed that the interactions between anhydride groups of maleated 

coupling agents and the hydroxyl groups of natural fibres can overcome the problem of incompatibility,

increasing the interfacial adhesion between both components and, consequently, the mechanical 

performance of the composites [30-32].  One of the main concerns on the use of natural fibres in 

composites is their susceptibility to moisture absorption and the consequent effect on the physical and 

mechanical properties. The characteristics of that moisture absorption are influenced not only by the 

nature of the fibre and the matrix but also by the relative humidity and manufacturing process [33]. 

Despite these studies, the effect of cork on the mechanical behaviour of composites after water 

immersion has not been addressed. Thus, the main objectives of this research are (i) identify a proper 

processing design to avoid degradation of the natural component and particle agglomeration, (ii) study 

the effect of cork granulometry and the addition of coupling agent on the mechanical performance of 

the composites, (iii) study the effect of adding cork on the thermal properties of the developed materials 

and (iv) access the maximum incorporation of cork in the polypropylene matrix without compromising 

the processability of the final product. 

5.2 Experimental section 

5.2.1 Cork, polymer and coupling agents 

Cork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1 mm and specific weight of 166 ± 21 kg.m-3, moisture 

content of ~7.5 % and a cork powder, with an average particle size &amp;lt;500 µm, a specific weight of 157 

± 2 kg m-3 and moisture content of ~5.4% were both supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio 

Oleiros, Portugal).  

The matrix was a polypropylene (PP) homopolymer, (1374 E2 from ExxonMobil, Germany), with a MFI 

of 20.8 g.10min-1 (200 ºC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 162 ºC, supplied by Pallmann 

Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp;amp; Co. (Germany) in the powder form. PP grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-

MA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PO 1020), with MFI of 110 g.10min-1 (190 

ºC, 1.2 kg), and a melting point of 156 ºC, was produced by ExxonMobil, Germany. Stearic acid in the 

powder form was supplied by Fluka.  

5.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion compounding 

Prior to compounding, all natural raw materials were dried at 80 ºC during 24 h to stabilise the cork 

moisture content. After this step, the moisture content, determined by oven-dry weight before 

processing, was found to be less than 2.5%. The prepared formulations and processing conditions are 

summarized in Table 5.1.

Generally, the polyolefin and the coupling agent were tumble-mixed and fed through the hopper. The

In all the experiments it was used a vacuum pump system and the feed rate was set for 2 kg/h. The 

temperature presents a decreasing at the end of the profile since it is compensated by the increased 

shearing which tends to increase the temperature of the composite. Part of the extrudate was cooled in 

water bath and subsequently ground by a Scheer (Germany) grinder in order to obtain pellets with 

length ? 5 mm. The pellets were dried in an oven at 80 ºC and further packed and sealed in plastic 

bags and conditioned at room temperature (23ºC, 55% relative humidity) at least for 48 hours prior to 

further investigation.

CPC 14 and CPC 15 compositions were compound in a counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion machine 

(Carvex, Portugal), which had a screw diameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of 18 with a 

nonintermeshing, mixing mode screw configuration. The barrel temperature profile was in the range 

155-180-190 ºC, and the screw speed was fixed at 30 rpm.

the differences (for the same weight) in volume between the three raw materials used. 

 

The cork powder and the PP were pre-mixed and manually feed in the hopper system. No extrusion 

head was used in order to minimize the residence time and shear heat dissipation. The extruded 

material was cooled in air, granulated in a cutting mill to produce composite pellets. The pellets were 

stored in plastic bags and sealed and further conditioned at room temperature for further investigation. 

5.2.3 Injection moulding 

The polypropylene and the PP/cork composite pellets (PP, CPC 1 to CPC 13) were injection moulded in 

an ENGEL Spex Victory 50 (Austria GmbH). The processing conditions were optimized and the 

parameters described in Table 5.2 were used in all conditions. The injection-moulded specimens were 

tensile bars produced according ASTM 638, with 60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 

2×4 mm2, and a neck length of 20 mm.

5.2.4 Compression moulding 

The PP/cork composite pellets were compression moulded using a hot press (Moore, UK) to produce 

plates with 186 × 118 mm2 and 2 mm of thickness. The mould temperature was 180 ºC and the 

material was kept 8 minutes in the mould without pressure followed by 2 minutes under 6 tones 

pressure followed by a cooling period with water under pressure. 

5.2.5 Morphology 

The distribution of cork particles on the PP matrix, after injection moulding, was observed on a 

transmission optical microscope (Olympus BH-2) connected to a Leica DFC 280 digital camera and 

corresponding software. To prepare the samples for the analyses, one slice with a thickness of 15 µm 

was cut, using a Leitz 1401 microtome equipped with a glass slicing knife, from the longitudinal section 

of the tensile specimen. Each sample slice was placed between a microscope glass slide and cover 

glass. To prevent them from curling up or corrugating, Canada balsam was used as a fixing resin. All 

samples were left to cure under a simple weight pressure during at least 12 h prior to analysis.  

5.2.6 Physical testing 

The physical tests involved accessing the dimensional stability by water absorption (WA), moisture 

content (MC) and density of the produced PP/Cork injection moulded composites and the plate

175 

contraction after compression moulding. The WA was measured according to the ASTM D 570. The 

specimens, previously obtained by injection moulding, were dried at 70 ºC oven night in a vacuum oven 

and stabilized in a desiccator before undergo the tests.  

The WA was calculated by weighting the specimens before and after immersed in distilled water at 

room temperature (23 ºC) and the tests were conducted up to 1344 h. The water absorption was 

calculated according to the Equation 1: 

 

  (5.1) 

 

where Wa is the weight of the specimen after immersion (g) and Wb is the weight of the same specimen 

before immersion (g). Since cork is a natural material that presents some hygroscopic behavior, it was 

necessary to determine the moisture content before WA testing. For that purpose, the specimens were 

weighed using an analytical balance before being placed in a vacuum oven at 50 ºC for 48 h. The 

specimens were then removed from the oven and cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days 

followed by reweighing of the specimens. The moisture content of the specimens was calculated as 

follows: 

 

    (5.2) 

 

where Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying 

(g). Averages of five specimens were used for WA and MC measurements. 

The density of the PP matrix and PP/cork injection moulded composites was determined according to 

the standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the 

immersion vessel using liquid propanol. Averages of five specimens were measured per condition. 

The plate contraction was accessed after the compression moulding process by comparing the 

dimensions of the metallic mould frame with the final dimensions of the 2 mm thick produced plates. 

5.2.7 Mechanical properties 

Tensile properties of the polypropylene and PP/cork composites were measured using an Instron 4505 

Universal Testing Machine, (USA) according to the standard ASTM D 638. The tests were conducted 

using a 1 kN load cell, with a gauge length of 20 mm and a crosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 until

176 

rupture. The tensile force was taken as the maximum stress in the stress-strain curve. Tensile modulus 

was estimated from the initial slope of the stress–strain curve (between 0.5 and 1% strain) using the 

linear regression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before 

testing. The average and standard deviations were determined using at least 5 specimens per condition.  

Data were statistically analysed using IBM SPSS software v. 23.0 (Release 23.0 for Windows) to infer 

about significant differences on the tensile properties of the developed composite materials. We first 

applied the Shapiro–Wilk test to test the assumption of Normality and the results showed that the data 

were not following a Normal distribution. Consequently, the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used 

to compare the medians of the tensile modulus, tensile strength and maximum strain for the composite 

specimens before and after immersion tests. Differences between groups were considered to be 

statistically significant at a confidence level of 95.0 %. 

5.2.8 Thermal properties 

A Daventest (England) was used for obtaining data and allow determining melt flow index (MFI) of the 

neat polypropylene and of each composite material in the pellet form. Procedures were performed 

according to ASTM D1238, using 210 ºC and 2.16 or 5 kg. Each condition was repeated once. 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidation induction time (OIT) measurements were 

performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model (USA) equipment and using samples of 8–12 mg. DSC 

was conducted at a heating rate of 10 ºC.min?1, under nitrogen atmosphere (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). 

Only the second run was analysed for melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm). The degree 

of crystallinity was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline PP a melting enthalpy of ?Hmº = 209 

J/g [34], according to the Eq. (3): 

 

    (5.3) 

 

where ?Hm is the apparent enthalpy of fusion per gram of composite and w is the weight fraction of 

cork in the composite. All the analysis were repeated at least once. 

OIT is a method to measure the stability of material against oxidation. Indium was used as calibration. 

The samples were heated at a rate of 20 ºC.min-1 up to 200 ºC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 4 min 

at 200 ºC, the atmosphere was changed to oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation

177 

induction time was measured during the isothermal period. The analyses were performed in three 

samples per each condition. 

Thermal conductivity, thermal resistance and sample thickness of the plates obtained by compression 

moulding were measured in an Alambeta, Sensora HDH (Czech Republic), at 21 ºC. The principle of 

the equipment is described in the literature [35]. In more detail, the experimental procedure consisted 

on measuring the heat flow passing through the composite due to the difference of temperature where 

the bottom measuring plate was set at 20°C and the measuring head (upper plate) was constant 

heated at 34 °C. All the measurements were repeated 3 times. The composite ability to conduct heat 

through its internal structure is given by the thermal conductivity (?) and is determined from the 

following equation [36]: 

 

     (5.4) 

 

where, Q is the amount of conducted heat, F is the area through which the heat is conducted,  is the 

time of heat conducting, ?T represents the drop of temperature and h the plate thickness obtained in 

this study by compression moulding. 

The thermal resistance is a property of materials and indicates how well a material insulates and it is 

represented by [36]: 

 

      (5.5) 

 

where, Rt is the thermal resistance and depends on the composite thickness h. 

 

5.3 Results and discussion 

5.3.1 Physical properties 

5.3.1.1 Water absorption and moisture content 

The moisture content (MC) of the injection moulded specimens was determined before the water 

absorption (WA) tests and the results are presented in Table 5.3. The results show that, the highest MC 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

178 

was 0.21 ± 0.02%, value obtained the CPC 3 composition containing 30 wt.% of cork powder. For all 

other compositions the MC value was less than 0.16 ± 0.02% being the reduced value of moisture 

obtain in the composites influenced by the processing methodology and the content of lignocellulosic 

material in the composite. The impermeability of cork to liquids and gases, derived from its closed cell 

walls that are made mainly of suberin, however it absorbs moisture at ambient relative humidity [12, 

13]. 

The WA behaviour of the injection moulded specimens determined by equation 5.1 is shown in Figure 

5.3. The obtained results suggest that the water uptake depends of several parameters, including cork 

amount and cork particle size as shown in Figure 5.3 a). The addition of cork particles increased the 

water uptake of the composites when compared with the neat polymer, being the composition CPC 3 

containing cork powder the one with higher WA. 

This behaviour was independent of the cork particle size. However, the influence of cork particle size 

was observed for the compositions prepared with higher cork content (30 wt.%), were the higher surface 

area of cork powder available to interact with water seems of significant importance. It was previously 

reported, that the contact angle of natural cork with water is around 84º and reduces with the time due 

to the WA [12]. We hypothesise that the hydrophilic polar hydroxyl and carboxylic groups present at the 

cork surface are responsible for the moisture uptake. Moreover, it was found that water absorption in 

lignocellulosic composites is mainly due to the presence of fine pores and hydrogen bonding sites in the 

bio-based component, gaps at the interfaces, and the micro-cracks in the matrix formed during the 

compounding process [37].

The effect of adding a coupling agent, PP-g-MA or stearic acid, on the water absorption behaviour of the 

composites was also analysed (Figure 5.3 b). For that purpose, the compositions containing cork 

powder (15 wt.%) and different amounts of coupling agent were selected. From the obtained results is 

clear that the water uptake was reduced with the addition of coupling agent. In the case of PP-g-MA, the 

decrease of WA was more pronounced with the increase of the coupling agent content. The functional 

groups [-(CO)2 O-] of maleic anhydride interact manly with the hydroxyl groups (-OH) [38] present in the 

lignocellulosic materials increasing the interfacial adhesion and reducing the available polar groups at 

the particle surface to absorb water. In the case of the stearic acid it is reported that the carboxyl group 

of stearic acid reacts with the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of the natural fibre and improves water 

resistance properties [39]. The improvement on the compatibility between cork-polymer may result in a 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

181 

reduction of possible micro voids resulting from the processing and consequently on a decrease on the 

WA. It should be highlighted that, even for the high cork content of 30 wt.%, the WA was very low being 

2.11 ± 0.17 % the highest value after 1344 h of immersion. 

5.3.1.2 Density of plates and of specimens 

The effect of the processing method, type and amount of cork particles on the final density of the 

different compositions was analysed, see results in Figure 5.4.  

 

 

 

Figure 5.4. Density of the different PP/cork composites after injection and compression moulding 

processes. 

 

Considering the density of the neat polypropylene 896 kg/m3, it was observed that the injection 

moulded composite specimens exhibit higher density when compared with the compression moulded 

ones, probably due to the higher pressures (per unit of volume) involved during the injection moulding 

process (see Table 5.2). Unexpectedly, it was also observed that, for both processing methods, 

formulations containing higher amount of cork (30 wt.%) have shown higher density. For both cases, 

this behaviour was more evident on the composites prepared using cork powder (985 kg/m3) than in 

the ones prepared with cork granules (967 kg/m3), representing an increase on the density of 10 and 

8% respectively. The presence and the amount of coupling agent during injection moulding promoted a 

small reduction on the composite density. This occurs probably due to the additional distributive 

capacity of the coupling agent that enhanced the dispersion of the cork particles during the extrusion 

process.  



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

182 

Applying compression moulding in the presence of coupling agent it was observed resulted in a small 

increasing on the composite plate’s density, especially when using cork powder. As explained before, 

this could be due to a possible reduction of micro-voids that may occur during this static process. 

However the selected pressure applied in compression moulding enables to take some advantage of 

this natural cellular material in terms of final density of the composites as compared with the neat 

polypropylene. The increasing on density was also observed for the two additional formulations (CPC 14 

and CPC 15) using higher cork amounts (50 and 70 wt.%) respectively. These compositions represent 

bio-based composites containing 85 and 93% of cork powder in volume. As presented in Table 5.4 

using 70 wt.% of cork powder the final composite plate density was 1044 kg/m3.  

One possible explanation is the densification of the cork particles due to the high pressures involve in 

both processing methods. Cork is a light weight material (see Figure 5.2 c)) and it is composed by a 

closed cellular structure. The density of the cork cell wall was never experimentally measured but it was 

estimated by the density of the different polymeric components to be 1150 kg/m3 [12, 17]. This may 

explain the effect of some densification that occurs using lignocellulosic materials such as cork 

combined with polyolefins after being processed by two melting processing steps.

5.3.1.3 Plate contraction 

The compression moulded plates were used to determine the contraction behaviour of the different 

compositions and the obtained results are indicated in Table 5.4. As expect, the 2 mm thickness plates 

prepared using only the neat polypropylene presented a high contraction of 4.0 % in the mould walls. By 

increasing cork concentration, the contraction was proportionally reduced, being 2.2% for the polymer-

cork powder (50-50) wt.% composition CPC 14. Moreover, increasing the cork particle size reduced the 

contraction in the mould. This are an important results for the design of composite materials since the 

use of low amount of cork particles can contribute for increasing the dimensional stability of the final 

product. 

5.3.1.4 Composite aesthetics 

The aesthetic properties of the produced PP/cork composite plates with 5 wt.% of cork and 2 mm 

thickness, obtained by compression moulding, are presented in Figure 5.5.  

 

  

Figure 5.5. Visual aspect of 2 mm thick PP/cork composite plates formed by compression moulding: a) 

CPC 1 containing PP with 5 wt.% of cork powder and b) CPC 4 containing PP with 5 wt.% of granulated 

cork. 

 

It was observed that both cork powder and granulated cork acts as a pigment promoting a brown colour 

(Figure 5.5 a). On the other hand, when granulated cork is used (Figure 5.5 b), it is possible to observe 

a homogeneous distribution of the cork granules promoting a better aesthetic on the final material. 

Taking aesthetics and environmental awareness as the main selection indices for a specific application, 

we can suggest that cork is one of the highest ranking candidates to be used in the development of 

sustainable materials.

5.3.2 Composite morphology 

Transmission optical microscopy was employed to evaluate the cork particles distribution on the 

PP/cork composite specimens. Figure 5.6 shows the bright field micrographs from the longitudinal 

sections (flow direction) of injection moulded samples, revealing good dispersion and distribution of the 

cork particles, also promoted by the twin-screw extrusion process. A few dark particles were observed; 

however, the used cork particles also present some dark brown particles as shown in Figure 5.2 a) and 

b) that can be resulted from the wood bark of the tree and not resulted from a thermal degradation 

process of cork. 

Increasing the cork bio-based content up to 30 wt% (Figure 5.6 d and g) no particle aggregation was 

observed, maintaining the homogeneous cork distribution and dispersion. It has been reported that one 

of the main problems in processing wood-thermoplastic composites is the tendency of untreated wood 

to form large aggregates, due to a high intramolecular bonding among the fibres [11]. Therefore, this 

may be a distinguishable feature of using cork if the proper extrusion conditions are used. 

Since cork is a compressive foam material and PP matrix presents higher hardness, it was also 

expected to see some voids at the polymer-cork interface due to the cutting process during samples’ 

preparation. On the contrary, the bright field microscopy micrographs showed a good cohesion of the 

cork particles in the structure film prepared for microscopy, revealing a good interfacial adhesion 

between cork and the PP matrix independently of the cork particle size or cork weight fraction or the 

use of coupling agent present in the composite. This absence of gaps or voids between cork-polymer 

without coupling agent may also be supported by the cellular structure at the cork surface allowing 

higher attachment of the PP during the melting compounding. The result also supports the low water 

absorption results of the composites containing cork. Several studies [11, 30, 31] using other 

lignocellulosic fibres or fillers without coupling agents showed lower interfacial adhesion with the 

presence of gaps between the matrix-fibre system at this magnification. Figure 5.6 b) and f) shows 

polarized light microscopic (PLM) micrographs of the PP/cork composites containing 5 wt%. of cork. 

These PLM images reveal a shell and a subshell that is formed due to a supercooling effect resulting 

from the low temperature of the mould during the injection moulding process. Moreover, in this region 

of the specimen were the composite material is in direct contact with the mould, it was found that cork 

particles are highly aligned in the longitudinal direction, though the flow direction, as indicated in Figure 

5.6 b). No significant differences on the cork distribution were observed in the presence of the coupling 

agent PP-g-MA or with the stearic acid.

of cork addition and its particle size and b) effect of the coupling agent on the composites containing

5.3.3.1 Effect of cork addition 

The effect of cork addition on the tensile properties of the composites was analysed and compared with 

the PP matrix in terms of percentage. The results are plotted on Figure 5.8 a, c and e). The addition of 

low amounts of cork (i.e. 5 wt.%) reinforced the stiffness of the polypropylene in 10%, while the use of 

cork up to 15 wt.% does not affect negatively the tensile modulus of the neat PP. When the cork content 

was increased to 30 wt.% an opposite effect was observed decreasing the composite stiffness.

Figure 5.8. Effect of addition of cork (a, c, e) as compared with the PP matrix and the effect of the 

coupling agent (b, d, f) as compared with the PP/Cork composite with 15 wt.% of cork powder (CPC 2) 

or granules (CPC 5) on the tensile properties of the developed composites. 

 

The tensile strength and the maximum strain were significantly reduced in all cases, where Figure 5.7 

a) and Figure 5.8 e) show the clear decrease in the maximum strain with the addition of the bio-based 

component. The decrease in tensile strength is partially due to the inherent incompatibility between 

cork particles and PP matrix.  As the load is applied to the composite material, the lack of interfacial 

adhesion between cork particles and the matrix will limit the load transfer process, thus, resulting in a 

decrease in the tensile properties. Additionally, the mechanical properties of cork under tensile load are 

lower when compared with the polypropylene matrix contributing to a diminishing of the tensile strength.

189 

5.3.3.2 Effect of PP-g-MA and stearic acid  

It is well known that the fibre–matrix interaction has a significant effect in the final mechanical 

properties of polymer composites. To improve the bonding strength between cork particles and the 

polymeric matrix, polypropylene graft maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) and stearic acid were tested as 

coupling agents. The results are presented in Figure 5.7, Figure 5.8 and summarized in Table 5.3. The 

effect of PP-g-MA on the tensile modulus is shown in Figure 5.8 b). The stiffness of the composite 

presents a small improvement for the granulated cork while in the powder form a small decrease on the 

stiffness was obtained. Increasing the coupling agent up to 8 wt.% the composites exhibited similar 

stiffness when compared to the control specimens (CPC 2 and CPC 5) containing 15 wt.% of cork 

without coupling agent. Tensile strength of the composites was significantly improved with the addition 

of the PP-g-MA (Figure 5.7 b) and Figure 5.8 d)), resulting in a composites with higher strength and 

toughness. Additionally, the increase on tensile strength was not proportional to the increase of the 

amount of coupling agent used indicating that the use of PP-g-MA in 8 wt.% does not promoted a 

relevant increase on the tensile strength as compared with the composites using 4 wt.% of PP-g-MA. 

These results suggest that the addition of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) improves the 

interfacial adhesion between both components promoting the load transfer from the matrix trough the 

cork particles resulting in an increase of the tensile strength. As it was pointed before, the MA interact 

manly with the hydroxyl groups of the lignocellulosic materials increasing the interfacial bonding of PP-

cork, which leads to a better stress transfer from the polymer to the cork resulting on the increase of 

the tensile properties. The maximum strain in PP/Cork (85/15) wt.% was also considerably improved 

with the addition of coupling agent (see Figure 5.8 d). 

On the contrary, the use of stearic acid as presented in Table 5.3 does not influence the tensile strength, 

reduced the tensile modulus and promoted just a slight increase on the maximum strain at break. 

Similar effect has been reported on the properties of PP/wood flour composites [40], where the stearic 

acid slight increased the strain at break and promoted better homogeneity and processability. In this 

study, it was also observed that the addition of stearic acid acted as a release mould agent during the 

injection moulding. The use of solid lubricants is recommended to reduce the friction coefficient of the 

natural fibre materials [41].

5.3.3.3 Effect of cork particle size 

The effect of cork particle size on the tensile properties of the PP/cork composites can be observed in 

Figure 5.8. In the absence of coupling agent and independently of the cork particle size, by increasing 

the cork content resulted in a reduction of the mechanical performance. Small differences were 

observed particularly the more pronounced reduction in the stiffness when it was used 30 wt.% of cork 

powder (Figure 5.8 a)). An opposite effect in the presence of PP-g-MA (Figure 5.8 b)) was observed. 

Higher content of coupling agent of 8 wt.% may contribute to reinforce the PP/Cork composite stiffness. 

The increase on tensile strength in the presence of coupling agent occurred independently of the cork 

particle size, however more significant in formulations prepared using cork powder. Furthermore, in the 

presence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent the maximum strain at break maintains (Figure 5.8 f) while the 

use of cork granules decreased the maximum strain in 60%. The result can be ascribed by the lower 

particle size of cork meaning a higher surface area of the bio-based fraction available to interact with 

the polypropylene matrix. It is expected that the use of coupling agent reduces the viscosity of the neat 

polypropylene increasing the contact of the thermoplastic with the cork particles and thus promoting 

higher tensile strength and strain at break in the final composite specimens. 

5.3.3.4 Ashby diagram 

The Figure 5.9 shows the Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against the 

specific tensile modulus of the PP and the PP/cork composites. It also  includes the tensile properties 

reported for cork (good quality), being the tensile modulus of 30.8 MPa, the fracture stress of 1.05 MPa 

and the density ranging from 0.148 to 0.178 g.cm-3 [42].

191 

 

Figure 5.9. Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against the specific tensile 

modulus of the polypropylene (PP) and the PP/cork composites obtained by extrusion followed by 

injection moulding. 

 

By normalizing the tensile properties by the density of each processed material two distinct regions 

were observed for the composites, being the region (1) containing the composites without coupling 

agent and with higher cork weight content (15 and 30 wt.%) and the region (2) the composites with 

coupling agent or with only 5 wt.% of cork. The addition of 5 wt.% of cork promotes a reinforcement on 

the PP matrix increasing the stiffness. Similar result was obtained using higher content of the coupling 

agent. The mechanical properties of the composites prepared with cork powder present higher variation 

as compared with the composites containing cork granules. However, higher tensile strength was 

achieved using cork powder with coupling agent. This result reinforces the idea of the lower the cork 

particle size, the higher the surface area and the interaction with the matrix due to the presence of PP-g-

MA, resulting in higher mechanical properties.  

 

5.3.3.5 Dry and wet tensile properties 

Mechanical tests were performed for all the specimens before and after water absorption studies.  

Figure 5.10 compares the tensile properties in terms of modulus, maximum strength and maximum 

strain of the PP/Cork composites before and after immersion in water during 1344 hours. The used 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

192 

Kruskal-Wallis statistical test compares the medians of tensile properties of the composites. p values 

less than 0.05, indicate statistically significant differences (*) between the medians at a confidence level 

of 95 %. In general, the mechanical properties are very similar before and after water saturation. This 

result is a clear advantage of cork composites since they can be used in wet conditions maintaining 

mechanical performance similar to dry environments. However, some statistical significant differences 

were observed and it is interesting to notice that, for several composite compositions, the ultimate 

tensile strength of wet samples is higher than that for dry samples, as shown in Figure 5.10.  b).This 

could be due to the fact that high amounts of water causes swelling of the bio-based material, which 

could fill the spaces between the cork and the polymer matrix interface and eventually could lead to an 

increase in the mechanical properties of the composites, as reported in studies of natural fibre-matrix 

composites [33, 43].

water absorption tests. (*) denotes significant statistical differences for 0.05 of confidence in pairwise 

comparisons between dry and wet specimens. 

 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

193 

On the contrary, it was observed a decrease on the tensile strain for the wet specimens (Figure 5.10 c). 

This effect is more evident for the composites containing low amounts of cork. Cork as a hydrophobic 

character with close cellular structure and is used as a sealant material [13, 14]; however it absorbs 

moisture, presenting low permeability to water. Once the moisture penetrates inside the cork particles 

tends to swell and after the saturation period it occurs an additional weakness of the cork-matrix 

interface which results in a clear loss on the maximum tensile strain. 

5.3.4 Thermal Properties 

5.3.4.1 Effect of the compounding method on the composite melt flow behaviour 

The effect of cork addition on the properties of the extruded composite pellets was accessed by means 

of melt flow index (MFI) and the results are presented in Table 5.4. Effective mixing during 

compounding is important to achieve a good dispersion and distribution of cork and, consequently to 

optimize the composite properties. The addition of 5 wt.% of cork to the PP matrix exhibits a reduction 

around 50% of the MFI. As expected, this result indicates that by increasing the cork content the MFI 

tends to reduce, revealing the higher shear forces that occur during the extrusion process. However, for 

the same amount of cork, the presence of PP-g-MA and stearic acid reduces the viscosity promoting the 

mixability of the cork with the PP and the consequent increase on the MFI. Comparing all composition, 

it was observed a correlation between the cork particle size and the MFI values, being the lower the 

particle size the smaller is the MFI. For the same amount, there is higher number of cork particles in 

the powder form per volume as compared with the cork granules therefore, more interfaces between 

cork-matrix to restrict the flow during the extrusion and consequent reduction of the melt flow index. 

When a high content of cork (50 to 70 wt.%) is used the viscosity of the composite increases even more, 

resulting in processing difficulties justifying the option in this work to compound the CPC 14 and CPC 

15 compositions without die. In addition, agglomeration of the cork as result of poor dispersion may 

also occur. 

5.3.4.2 Crystallization and melting temperature 

The thermal stability of composites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the 

obtained results are presented in Figure 5.11 and in the Table 5.4.  

 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

194 

 

Figure 5.11. DSC curves obtained during cooling of PP and its PP/cork powder composites. 

 

The differences to the neat PP were more relevant when the crystallization temperatures (Tc) were 

determined and compared from the first cooling cycling. The DSC curves show the effect of the cork 

powder on the crystallization of PP/cork composites. The PP/cork composites showed higher Tc than 

the neat PP being the increasing proportional to the cork weight fraction up to 50 wt.%. This result 

suggests that the crystallization process is favoured by the presence of cork particles. This effect is 

attributed to the nucleation effect of the cork: the particles act as sites for heterogeneous nucleation 

that induce the crystallization of the matrix. The nucleating ability of cork was also observed in a 

previous study [23] by optical microscopy and DSC using different cork powders, a by-product from 

cork industry, combined with polyolefins after pultrusion process. The addition of coupling agent based 

on maleic anhydride contributed also to increase the crystallization rate. This result implies that the 

coupling agent acted as a precursor increasing the crystallization. A previous study suggest that the 

crystallization of PP-g-MA is slightly hfaster than that of PP due to a possible chain branching of maleic 

anhydride and the better dispersion of the PP-g-MA in the polymer matrix [44]. Moreover, the results 

indicates that processing these PP/Cork composites needs less moulding time and energy than the 

neat PP. Table 5.4 also shows the melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (?Hm) corrected by the 

cork content, and percentage of crystallinity (?c) that corresponds to the values obtained in the second 

heating scans of the neat PP and PP/Cork composites containing 5, 15 and 30 wt.% of cork. The 

addition of the natural cork to PP has no significant effect on the Tm, and no correlation of the results 

with the cork loading can be established. The increase on the cork content up to 30 wt.% on the PP 

matrix promoted a small increase on the crystallinity (?c) of the composites independently of the cork 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

195 

particle size. A possible explanation for this observation is that, when cork is introduced into the PP 

matrix, the crystallinity of the polymer fraction increases, as a result new crystalline zones are formed 

around the cork particles through spherulitic crystallization on their surfaces. By increasing the cork 

content up to 50 wt.% the composite crystallinity (CPC 14) decreased to 42.5%. This result indicated 

that the crystallinity was reduced in 5.1% as compared to neat PP, probably due to the higher content of 

amorphous components that chemically constitute the cork. The presence of PP-g-MA in the 

composites seems to have influence on the enthalpy values: it was observed that the increase of 

coupling agent was followed by a slight increase on the crystallinity. This result was exhibited in all 

PP/Cork composites containing coupling agent. Thus, the increase on the crystallinity is also dependent 

of the degree of compatibility between the PP matrix and the cork. This behaviour was also observed in 

some different few natural fibres in the presence of polyolefin grafted with maleic anhydride [44-46] and 

supports the good interaction between the cork and the PP matrix in the presence of PP-g-MA as 

coupling agent observed in this study.  

5.3.4.3 Oxidation induction time 

Thermoplastics have points in its chain that are susceptible to the thermal oxidation during the 

processing and end use. On the other hand, lignocellulosic materials, such as cork, are sensitive to 

temperature and high shear rates during compounding that may cause degradation and consequent 

changes in the mechanical performance. The thermo-oxidative stability of the neat PP and the PP/cork 

composites in oxygen atmosphere was assessed by determining the oxidation induction time (OIT) at 

elevated temperatures, under isothermal conditions see results in Figure 5.12 and Table 5.4. The onset 

of oxidation on the matrix PP was detected immediately (after 2.7 min) as the atmosphere was changed 

from nitrogen to oxygen. Comparing with the matrix the increase in the OIT of the composites suggests 

that PP is stabilized by the addition of cork. The OIT values of the composites containing cork powder 

were considerably higher than the composites with granulated cork. It was found that increasing the 

cork content up to 30 wt.%, provides a higher antioxidative protection. The best results of OIT were 

obtained using cork powder (37.4 min), representing 12.9 times higher than the neat PP. This 

behaviour might be ascribed due to the higher surface area of the well dispersed cork particles available 

to interact with the matrix in combination with the higher composite density.

196 

 

Figure 5.12. Thermal oxidative stability of the neat polypropylene (PP) and PP/cork composites at 200 

ºC revealing the onset of decomposition.  

 

The higher density of the PP/cork composite material will block the access of oxygen and slows the 

oxidative degradation.  The literature also point some studies were lignins, obtained from different 

processes, were added in low amounts to stabilize polypropylene against thermoxidation [47, 48] since 

they can impart antioxidant properties. Chemically, cork presents phenolic compounds that are present 

in the suberin and lignin that may also contribute for this antioxidant protection. In addition, cork 

extractives are non-structural organic components of the cork cell wall around up to 18 wt.% and among 

other components presents phenolic compounds [12] that might be released during the extrusion and 

mixed with the matrix contributing also to this result. It has been reported that the use of some natural 

fibres does not promote higher antioxidant effect in thermoplastics [26]. Nevertheless, this study shows 

that the two factors that are relevant to prolong the lifetime of the PP/cork composites are i) the 

presence of antioxidants that blocks the free radicals and ii) the composite density that may control the 

amount of oxygen into the composite. However, it is expected that the use of polymers containing 

antioxidant or thermal stabilizer compounds in their composition present higher oxidation stability than 

cork can provide. In that case, the stabilizer molecules are slowly released with time, thus, contributing 

to an extended stabilizer lifetime. It can be suggested that cork will affect positively the behaviour of the 

thermoplastic materials preventing the oxidative degradation of the polypropylene during compounding 

and subsequent service.

5.3.4.4 Thermal resistance and thermal conductivity 

Thermal conductivity (TC) is a measure of the heat flux that will flow through the material if a certain 

temperature gradient exists over the material [49]. The small cells are an important feature of cork. The 

cells are much smaller than those in the polymeric foamed materials providing excellent insulating 

properties to the material [17]. The TC of the produced plates, as compared with the PP matrix, is 

presented in Table 5.4 and Figure 5.13. The results have shown that TC maintains or decreases only 

for the composites up to 5 wt.% of cork content. All the PP/cork composites present low TC, however, 

significant differences were observed in the composites. The results show that the TC increases with the 

increase of the cork weight fraction and the relationship being the stronger the smaller the filler particle 

size. The increase of TC of the PP/cork can be explained by the densification of cork on the composites 

after the two melt based processes. First, the higher shear forces during the extrusion and second due 

to the applied pressure in compression moulding. 

 

 

Figure 5.13. Thermal conductivity in function of the density of the plates obtained by compression 

moulding for the PP and PP/cork composites without coupling agent. 

 

The plot of TC against the composite density shown in Figure 5.13 gave the regression value (R2) to be 

0.9975 for the cork powder composite plates, which indicated a good correlation between these two 

properties. Furthermore, the coefficient value was found to be positive indicating an increase in the TC 

with the increase of the composite density. Increasing the cork particle size (formulations CPC 4 to CPC 

6) was not possible to infer significant differences between the cork particle size, since the compositions 

containing 15 and 30 wt.% tends to follow the same linear regression. The only outlier point was CPC 4 



Chapter 5 – Polypropylene-based cork-polymer composites: Processing parameters and properties 

 

198 

that contains only 5 wt.% of cork. In cellular materials different type of heat flow through the material 

can occur. The flow by conduction depends only on the amount of solid in the foam and not depends 

on the cell size. The flow by convection depends on the cell size, however for cells less than 1 mm in 

size, convection does not contribute significantly. Finally, the flow by radiation, also depends on the cell 

size: the smaller the cells, the more time the heat has to be absorbed and reradiated, and the lower is 

the rate of flow [17].  

On the contrary, the thermal resistance (TR) shows an opposite effect as presented in Table 5.4 and is 

also dependent of the plate thickness as presented in the equation 5.5. For the CPC 15, condition 

containing 70 wt.% of cork powder the TR is half as compared with the neat polypropylene, due to a 

high densification of the cork powder in the matrix were the TC increased 89% as compared with the 

neat PP. This may be an advantage in applications were the material need to promote the heat transfer, 

such as in radiating floors where these PP/cork composites can be used as structural layer or in 

hardware for electronics. Being cork an excellent thermal insulator this result was not expected, 

however this study shows that by playing with the cork weight fraction it is possible to increase or 

decrease the TR of the composite material. 

5.4 Conclusions 

Polypropylene-cork (PP/cork) composites were produced using twin-screw extruder followed by injection 

or compression moulding process. The effect of cork fraction and particle size and the use of coupling 

agent on the mechanical and thermo-physical properties PP/cork composites were investigated. The 

important results are summarized as follows: 

(1) The PP/cork composites exhibit reduced water uptake and the increase of cork fraction, 

increases the water absorption up to 2.3 wt.% after a period of 1344 hours. The increase of 

particle size of the cork tends to decrease the water uptake and the addition of coupling agent 

significantly reduces the composite water absorption. 

(2) The morphology of the PP/cork composites evaluated by optical microscopy revealed good 

dispersion and distribution of cork due to the twin-screw extrusion process, promoting good 

aesthetic characteristics. 

(3) The PP/cork composites exhibit higher density than the neat polypropylene and increases with 

the higher incorporation of cork. The use of coupling agent induces a slight decrease on the 

density due a better dispersion of the cork on the matrix.

(4) The tensile properties revealed a small reinforcement of around 10% in the stiffness provide by 

cork fraction 5 wt.%. For higher values an expected drop on the tensile properties was observed. 

The mechanical properties were enhanced by the addition of polypropylene graft maleic 

anhydride (PP-g-MA) preferably in terms of tensile strength and maximum strain, while the 

stearic acid promoted a slight increase on the maximum strain and acted as a release mould 

agent without significant negative effect on the mechanical performance. 

(5) Regarding the thermal properties, the PP/Cork composites had higher crystallization 

temperatures than neat PP, and their thermal stability was similar that of PP. Cork and PP-g-MA 

acts as nucleating agent during the crystallization process and does not affect the thermal 

stability of the composites. Cork promoted a small increase on the composite crystallinity upto 

30 wt.%, however the enhancement was also dependent of the degree of compatibility between 

the PP matrix and the cork. 

(6) Cork promotes an antioxidant effect to the polypropylene increasing the time to oxidation. 

Reducing the cork particle size and consequently increasing the surface area of the particles 

and the composite density contributes to a higher thermal-oxidative protection. Using 30 wt.% of 

cork powder the oxidation was delayed 12.9 times as compared with the neat PP. 

(7) The thermal conductivity of the plates increases with the increase of the cork weight fraction 

due to the increase of the density promoted by the addition of cork. This higher capacity for 

heat transfer may result in new potential applications for cork composites. 

(8) The addition of cork to the thermoplastic reduces considerably the viscosity and consequently 

the melt flow index (MFI), while the addition of the coupling agent PP-g-MA to the polyolefin-cork 

system promotes opposite effect improving mixability. 

(9) The maximum incorporation of cork to produce pellets was 70 wt.% (93% in volume) using cork 

powder compounded in a twin-screw extruder without die. 

In areas were environmentally concern, aesthetics, reduced plastic touch and construction capability 

are required, the composites containing cork constitute a viable and interesting possibility. Regarding 

these properties, the applications for the developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and 

insulation systems, hardware for electronics, toys for children, outdoor systems, in low content for 

automotive interior applications, among other sustainable applications.

Abstract 

High density polyethylene (HDPE) and cork powder were compounded in a co-rotating twin-screw 

extruder to obtain cork-polymer composites (CPC) with improved properties. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 

was used as initiator agent, and suberin or lignin isolated from cork enhanced filler-matrix bonding and 

promoted mechanical reinforcement with environmental benefits. The novel composites were 

characterized in terms of dimensional stability, evolution of morphology, thermal and mechanical 

properties and their performance was compared with that of composites containing polyethylene-grafted 

maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) as coupling agent. As expected, composites with coupling agent present 

higher mechanical properties, lower water uptake and thickness swelling variation. Suberin acts as 

plasticizer with antioxidant benefits, while lignin works as a coupling agent, improving tensile modulus 

and maximum strength. Increasing lignin content does not improve the mechanical properties but 

improves thermal stability.

6.1 Introduction 

The use of synthetic polymers combined with lignocellulosic materials has become a reliable alternative 

to develop new sustainable materials with good performance and reduced cost [1-3]. Cork is the outer 

bark of the Oak tree Quercus suber L. [4], where the harvesting of cork is a natural, renewable process 

that reduces subsequent carbon footprints. During industrial cork processing, up to 30 % results in sub-

products such as cork powder, which is used in small amounts low value added applications. Cork-

polymer composites (CPC) are usually prepared through melt based technologies. Increasing the 

percentage of cork in the composite without compromising the overall properties is seen as a desirable 

route towards sustainability. However, commodity thermoplastic matrices, such as polyethylene and 

polypropylene, are chemically incompatible with lignocellulosic materials, requiring the incorporation of 

coupling agents to improve interfacial adhesion. The addition  of functionalized polymers containing 

maleic anhydride (MA) groups  during  compounding showed to be an effective method to improve 

interfacial bonding, even when  using different cork qualities [5, 6]. The typical chemical composition of 

cork is about 40% of suberin, up to 22% of lignin, 18% of polysaccharides and up to 15% of other 

extractives [4, 7]. Suberin and lignin are thus the main constituents and in combination with  a closed 

cellular morphology account for cork’s unique properties, namely excellent insulation characteristics, 

low density and permeability, low thermal conductivity, high energy absorption, resilience, near-zero 

Poisson coefficient and high friction coefficient [7, 8]. Suberin is a natural biopolymer typically found in 

the cell walls of plants [9]. Cork suberin is constituted by a polyester structure of long chain fatty acids, 

hydroxyl and phenolic acids, linked by ester groups, with ferulic acid acting as a bridge between the 

aromatic and the aliphatic domains [10, 11]. Whether the aromatic domain is part of the suberin 

molecule is still a matter of debate [12]. The alkaline depolymerisation in an organic solvent results in 

the release of the aliphatic constituents through cleavage of the ester linkages and transesterification 

[11, 13, 14]. Full characterization of cork lignin is still incomplete because of the complex relation 

between true lignin and the aromatic fraction of suberin. Nevertheless, Marques et al. [15-17] found 

that cork is composed of a G type lignin with 94-96% guaiacyl, less than 3-5% syringyl and 2-3% 

hydroxyphenyl units [18]. In a previous study, the potential of suberin and chemically modified suberin 

to promote adhesion between low density polyethylene and cork was demonstrated [19]. Lignin has 

been proposed to reinforce the mechanical properties of composites [20, 21],  to promote adhesion in 

natural fibre composites [22], or, in combination with a coupling agent, to improve mechanical 



Chapter 6 – Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and 

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

208 

performance [21, 23]. In all cases, high amounts of lignin or the addition of a coupling agent were 

necessary to reinforce the composites.  

This work focus on the development of cork-polymer composites (CPC) using suberin and lignin  as bio-

based coupling agents through a reactive extrusion (REX) process, in order to overcome with 

environmental benefits the insufficient adhesion between cork and a high density polyethylene (HDPE)  

matrix. REX has the capability of functionalize, prepare the composite and produce pellets in a single 

step. No environmental or health hazardous solvents are used, low investment costs and high 

production yields are obtained [18, 24]. Initiators are usually required, the most widely used in grafting 

reactions being organic peroxides, including benzoyl peroxide (BPO). The work investigates for the first 

time: (i) the evolution of morphology during the compounding process; (ii) the dimensional stability and 

thermal properties of the composites; (iii) the effect of suberin, lignin, and initiator agent on the tensile 

properties. These properties are compared with those of an equivalent system using a coupling agent 

based on maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA). 

6.2 Experimental section 

6.2.1 Materials 

Cork powder, with an average particle size &amp;lt;500 µm, a specific weight of 157 ± 2 kg m-3 and a 

humidity of ~5.4% was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (Oleiros, Portugal).  

The matrix was a high density polyethylene HDPE, (HMA – 025 from ExxonMobil, Germany), with a MFI 

of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 136.6 ºC, containing a thermal stabilizer.  

HDPE grafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to 1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor 

PE 1040), with MFI of 1.4 g.10 min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), and having a melting point of 131.3 ºC, was 

produced by ExxonMobil, Germany.  

Benzoyl peroxide (BPO, 75%), USP grade, Luperox®, was obtained from Atofina Chemicals.  

The compositions prepared are presented in Table 6.1. The cork-polymer (20-80) wt.% ratio was 

maintained in all formulations.

6.2.2 Extraction of suberin and lignin  

Extractive free cork powder was obtained after three consecutive 6 h soxhlet extractions with 

dichloromethane, ethanol and water. The resulting material was used to obtain the suberin and lignin 

fractions. Suberin extraction procedure was adapted from Ekman R et al. [25] and Pinto PCRO et al. 

[26]. The product (1g to 13ml) was refluxed in Ethanol:Water (25:1) containing 0.5M sodium hydroxide 

for a period of 6 h. After cooling, the resulting mixture was filtered and the liquid fraction was acidified 

to pH 5-6 with hydrochloric acid. After filtration, the solvent was removed in a vacuum evaporator. The 

resulting solid residue was suspended in water and extracted with 3 times the volume in chloroform. 

The organic fraction was recovered and the solvent removed in a vacuum evaporator, resulting in a 

brownish paste-like material. 

The methodology for lignin extraction was adapted from Ekman et al. [25] and Browning BL [27]. The 

solid residue resulting from the suberin extraction was thoroughly washed with distilled water until 

neutral pH. 350 ml of a 72% sulfuric acid solution were added to 30 g of this residue and the mixture 

was maintained under agitation for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by the addition of 550 ml of 

distilled water and refluxing for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solid residue was

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

210 

recovered through filtration and washed with distilled water until neutral pH, a dark powdery material 

being obtained. 

6.2.3 Twin-screw compounding 

Before compounding, the cork powder was pre-dried at 80 ºC in a vacuum oven until constant weight. 

The raw materials, including the pulverized polyethylene, the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and PE-g-MA, were 

pre-mixed. Compounding was performed in a prototype modular laboratorial mini intermeshing co-

rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE), with a screw diameter of 13 mm, and a length to diameter ratio 

(L/D) = 27, coupled to a rod die with a diameter of 3mm. The screw profile is built by sliding along a 

shaft conveying and kneading elements with a maximum channel depth of 1.5 mm. As seen in Figure 

6.1, the configuration used in the experiments induces polymer melting in the first restrictive block 

upstream and dispersive and distributive mixing in the second kneading block, which comprises 8 discs 

staggered at -30º. The extruder is provided with sampling devices along its length which are capable to 

collect in circa 1 second small amounts of material from within the screw channel [28]. 

 

 

Figure 6.1. Twin-screw extruder set up. Screw profile is defined in terms of (pitch_length) of the various 

elements. A and B denote locations of material sampling. 

 

This allowed to obtain cork-polymer samples at locations A and B identified in Figure 6.1, i.e., where 

most of the dispersive mixing action should take place. The temperature profile along the barrel and die 

was set to 165/180/185/185/175 °C for all the experiments, the feed rate was kept at 130 g/h, and 

the screws rotating at 70 rpm.

Figure 6.2 shows the compounding methodology adopted. The pre-mixed polymer and cork were feed 

upstream (position 1) by a miniaturized volumetric feeder (based on a Moretto DVM 18 L), together with 

the BPO initiator, or the PE-g-MA. Suberin and/or lignin were added in position 2, by means of an 

automatic syringe pump (AL-1000, from WPI, USA), or manually, respectively. After air-cooling, part of 

the extruded composite was pelletized.

a) CPC 3 composition with 2 wt.% of suberin and b) CPC 5 with 4 wt.% of lignin as coupling agent in the 

pellet form. 

 

6.2.4 Chemical characterization 

Suberin and lignin were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The spectra were 

acquired between 4000 cm-1 and 500 cm-1 in a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 spectrometer, as the average of 

32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1. Suberin and Lignin spectra were obtained using the KBr pellet 

technique and cork spectra were recorded using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) module (PIKE 

Technologies).

6.2.5 Thermal properties 

The thermal stability of cork and of its major isolated chemical fractions was determined using a TGA 

Q500 Thermogravimetric Analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed at a heating 

rate of 10 °C.min-1 from 50 °C to 600 °C under air atmosphere. All tests were repeated once. 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidation induction time (OIT) measurements were 

performed in a TA instrument DSC Q100 model (USA) instrument on samples of 8–12 mg, at a heating 

rate of 10 ºCmin?1, under nitrogen atmosphere  (flux of ca. 50 ml min?1). Only the second run was 

analysed for melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (?Hm). The degree of crystallinity was 

calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline PE a melting enthalpy of ?Hmº = 293 J/g [29]. The 

analyses were performed in two samples of each condition. 

OIT measurements were conducted in the same equipment, with samples heated at a rate of 30 

ºC.min-1 up to 200 ºC under nitrogen atmosphere. After 2 min at 200 ºC the atmosphere was changed 

to oxygen (both gases at flux 50 ml.min-1) and oxidation induction time was measured during the 

isothermal period.  The analyses were performed in three samples of each condition. 

6.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy 

Fractured samples of the various composites were examined in a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) 

scanning electron microscope (SEM). Prior to the analysis, samples were coated with an Au/Pd alloy 

(80-20 wt. %) by ion sputtering in a high resolution sputter coater (Cressington 208HR, Watford, UK). 

6.2.7 Mechanical properties  

Three millimetre thick plaques were obtained by compression moulding in a hot press (Moore, UK) of 

the pellets of the various compositions at 150 ºC under an applied pressure of 1.42 MPa. The pellets 

were kept during a period of 8 minutes without pressure and 2 minutes with pressure, followed by a 

cooling period under pressure. Tensile bars according to ISO 527–2 (with a cross-section of 3 × 4 mm2 

at the neck) were machined by a Roland 3D Plotter (MDX-20, UK).  

The tensile properties were determined using a Universal tensile machine (Instron 4505 Universal 

Machine, USA) with a load cell of 1kN and a gauge length of 25 mm and a crosshead speed of 5mm 

min?1. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing and it was used 9 

specimens per condition. The tensile force was taken as the maximum force in the force deformation

lignin from cork as coupling agents

curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress–strain curve (between 0.05 

and 1% strain) using linear regression. The normality of the distribution of the mechanical results was 

evaluated using the Shapiro-WilK test confirming their normal distribution at p&lt;0.05. The results were 

compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Bonferroni multiple 

comparison tests to infer about the significant differences between mean values of the developed 

functionalized composites and the differences were considered significantly different at p&lt;0.05 (*).  

6.2.8 Dimensional stability 

Measurements of water absorption and thickness swelling were made according to ASTM D 570 on the 

specimens used for tensile testing, after vacuum-drying at 70 ºC and stabilization in a desiccator. Each 

specimen was immersed in distilled water, at ambient temperature, in falcon tubes of 14 ml for 

different time periods (up to 15 days). At the end of each period, five specimens of each condition were 

gently blotted with absorbent paper to remove the excess water on the surface, immediately reweighed 

and their thickness measured using a digital micrometer from Mitutoyo (Japan) (± 0.001 mm), and 

then re-immersed. Water absorption (WA) was calculated as:

6.3 Results and Discussion 

6.3.1 Chemical characterization 

The FTIR spectrum of cork presented in Figure 6.3 is dominated by the presence of absorption bands 

for hydroxyl (3400 cm-1), methylene (2920, 2850 and 1452 cm-1) and ester (1736, 1240 and 1150 cm-

1) groups. The absorption band at 1508 cm-1 is associated with the vibration of the aromatic skeleton. 

This is consistent with the existence of highly suberized cell walls characteristic of cork.  

 

 

Figure 6.3. ATR-FTIR spectra of cork and its major chemical isolated components used as coupling 

agent. 

 

The spectrum of suberin is similar to that of cork, retaining essentially the absorption bands related to 

the aliphatic ester moieties. Therefore, the suberin obtained by extraction probably has its constitutive 

aliphatic monomers transesterified or in oligomeric blocks arising from incomplete depolymerization. 

The lignin spectrum presents an intense band at 3400cm-1 due to hydroxyl groups, together with a 

shoulder at around 2570 cm-1. This configuration, in combination with the absorption band at 1714 cm-1, 

is consistent with the presence of carboxylic acid groups; the relatively intense 1610 and 1505 cm-1 

bands are related to the presence of aromatic structures.  

In summary, lignin and suberin partially retain the original cork structures. The aliphatic esterified 

domain is represented in suberin, whereas the aromatic domain in present in lignin.

6.3.2 Thermal properties 

6.3.2.1 Cork, suberin and lignin 

The thermogravimetric curves of cork and of its chemical fractions under air atmosphere are 

represented in Figure 6.4 in terms of weight loss and its derivative. A multi-step degradation process is 

evident. Cork and lignin show some weight reduction between room temperature and 150 °C, due to 

the loss of water molecules (suberin is hydrophobic).  

 

  

Figure 6.4. Thermogravimetric curves of cork and the principal chemical components under air 

atmosphere (a) and respective derivative curves (b). 

 

The thermal degradation of cork starts at approximately at 270 ºC, with the first intensive weight loss at 

~ 348 ºC and a second important region at circa 460 ºC (Figure 6.4 b). This pattern should correspond 

to the degradation of the major cork components. The derivative curves of the isolated cork fractions 

demonstrate that the thermal decomposition of suberin and lignin occur independently. Suberin 

displays good thermal stability up to around 259 °C, followed by a progressive weight loss, reaching 

nearly 45% at 338 °C and 87% at 494 ºC. Lignin shows a small shoulder at 193 ºC, a low temperature 

when compared with cork and suberin, probably due to the monomeric structures of lignin resulting 

from extraction. Its maximum decomposition takes place at about 515 ºC, confirming the higher 

thermal resistance as compared with suberin. At higher temperatures, the isolated cork fractions seem 

to present higher thermal stability. However, at 600 ºC no char weight residue was detected.

6.3.2.2 Composites 

The main features from the thermogravimetric analysis of the composites under air atmosphere are 

identified in Table 6.2. In all cases, the onset of degradation was higher than 265 ºC and the ash 

content was less than 0.3% at 600 ºC. Although the HDPE matrix contains a thermal stabilizer, the 

addition of PE-g-MA and of 4 wt.% of lignin seems to have acted as a thermal protective barrier to cork, 

enhancing the thermal stability up to temperatures as high as 387 - 395 ºC. This characteristic agrees 

well with the curves of Figure 6.4, where lignin showed higher thermal resistance. Thus, lignin could be 

eventually used as a flame retardant.

of suberin and lignin, and the coupling agent (PE-g-MA).

Table 6.3 lists the melting temperature (Tm), crystallization temperature (Tc), enthalpy (?H) and degree 

of crystallinity (Xc) of the neat polymer and composites, as determined from DSC curves.  The results 

show a slight increment of Tc and degree of crystallinity for composites CPC 1 and CPC 2, indicating 

that the presence of cork promotes crystallization. This nucleating ability of cork has been previously 

observed [5]. No significant changes in the Tm of the composites were detected. The composites 

containing suberin and lignin revealed lower melting enthalpy and crystallinity, probably due to BPO 

modification, which induces the formation of macro-radicals that may produce branching and chain 

extensions [30]. 

Oxidative induction time (OIT) measurements were performed at 200°C to compare the oxidation of the 

composites and analyse the effect of the proposed eco-friendly coupling agents. 



Chapter 6 – Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and 

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

217 

Table 6.3, shows high values of OIT for all tested composites due to the use of HDPE grade with 

thermal stabilizer. Significant differences in the onset decomposition time of the exothermic reactions 

were found, with the OIT varying from 54.2 to 74.6 min. It was found that the use of 2 wt.% of lignin 

CPC 4, does not influence significantly the thermal-oxidative stability of the composites under the 

isothermal conditions. However, the increase to 4 wt.% of lignin CPC 5, results in a reduction of the OIT. 

In despite of the reduction of the polymer %, the overall decrease of OIT is moderated by the presence 

of lignin.

The phenolic groups in the lignin can impart antioxidant properties which provide stability to the 

polymer against thermal- and photo-oxidation [31]. The clear increase on the OIT for the compositions 

with PE-g-MA (CPC 2) and containing 2 wt.% of suberin (CPC 3), is an indication that both substances 

may act and can be used as antioxidant on the composites. It is speculated that the existing aromatic 

domains of suberin contain various substituted phenolic groups [32], that may function as antioxidant.

6.3.3 Morphology 

6.3.3.1 Morphology evolution during compounding 

The morphology evolution during the twin-screw extrusion (TSE) process of the principal compositions 

after cryogenic fracture is presented in Figure 6.5. The zone B location corresponds to the intensive 

mixing zone of the TSE. Composite samples were collected rapidly at specific barrel locations with a 

special sampling device. It can be observed the high distributive mixing capacity during the melting of 

the co-rotating TSE: the cork particles are well distributed and dispersed in the polymer matrix upstream 

the die zone, in particular for the CPC 2 to CPC 7 compositions. This result demonstrates: (a) the 

importance of intensive mixing zones in the screw configuration to promote the efficient mixing of the 

monomer with the polymer, in this case a block of 4 kneading disks with a staggering angle -30º and 

(b) highlights the importance of the coupling agent based on PE-g-MA, suberin or lignin to promote 

dispersion of the natural phase.

extruder using the sampling device and collected after screw pulling in locations (A and B) and at the 

die at magnifications of ×100 and × 2400. 

 

Moreover, micro voids on the morphology were observed, in particular in the compositions using BPO. 

A proper venting design with vacuum or an efficient devolatilization system on the extruder may be 

necessary to eliminate the entrapped gas and the residual products generated during the reactive 

extrusion process. In addition, at high magnification the obtained extruded CPC pellets present good 

linkage between the cork and the HDPE independently of the processed composition and the presence 

of micro pores in the structure was considerably reduced.

6.3.3.2 Morphology of composites 

The composites present good aesthetic characteristics with a homogeneous visual distribution of cork. 

Figure 6.2 a) shows the visual aspect of a flexible extruded composition with 2 wt.% of suberin. The 

composite pellets containing lignin, presented in Figure 6.2 b), have a more intense brown colour with 

well dispersed lignin.  

The fracture morphology of the composites after tensile tests is presented in Figure 6.6. The tensile 

fracture of the unreinforced CPC is presented in Figure 6.6 b) and reveals high stretched elements of 

HDPE between the cork particles. Figure 6.6 c and d) shows the influence of the addition of PE-g-MA 

with the fracture occurring at the same level of the cork and the polymeric matrix, supporting the 

indication of good adhesion.  

Both results are in agreement with previous works using melt based technologies such as pultrusion 

and extrusion to produce cork based composites [6, 19]. The morphology of CPC 4 using 2wt.% of 

lignin presents similar fracture as compared with the composite using PE-g-MA. The composites with 

2wt.% of suberin in Figure 6.6 f ) two distinct zones of the polymeric phase can be observed: (i) a small 

portion of the polymeric matrix is stretched, probably due to the presence of suberin which is promoting 

additional ductility, also observed at lower magnification in Figure 6.6 e) and (ii) a fracture zone that 

occurs at the same level than cork phase due to the presence of the BPO. Moreover, during the 

extrusion process the visual aspect of the extruded composite surface containing suberin was smoother, 

reducing the shear during the extrusion. This effect may be related with a plasticizer capacity of suberin 

composed of esterified monomers and oligomers [9]. Additionally, we did not observe the presence of 

micro-voids on the different composites fracture, probably due to the temperature and pressure applied 

during the compression moulding to produce the composite boards.

Figure 6.8. Variation of the tensile properties comparing with the control non-reinforced cork-polymer 

(20-80) wt.% composition (CPC 1). 

 

It can be clearly observed that the use of a coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) 

considerably increases both strength and modulus of the materials and reduces the maximum strain. 

The MA may interact with the polar groups of cork (mainly hydroxyl groups (-OH)) of lignin and 

hemicellulose to form covalent or hydrogen bonding, providing chemical affinity and strong adhesion at 

the interface. The use of the BPO is represented in CPC 7, showed to act as a coupling agent without a 

negative effect on the maximum strain. During the extrusion process, BPO may initiate radicals which 

react with the cork surface and the polymeric matrix, promoting chemical bonding between the two 

phases. In the literature [33], it is referred that the grafting of peroxide radicals onto polyethylene could 

take place though an attack on the tertiary carbons and on the few double bonds present in the 

backbone chain. Alternatively, the combination of  peroxide groups and high temperatures could 

introduce polarity in the  polymer, thereby  increasing the adhesion  at polymer-fibre contacts [33]. Due 

to the chemical nature of cork, it is speculated that a similar action process can occur during the 

processing of the developed composites, resulting in an enhancement on the mechanical performance. 

In the functionalized CPC, the addition of 2 wt% of suberin promoted an increase of the maximum 

tensile strength, modulus and maximum strain comparing with the unreinforced CPC 1.  However and 

comparing with the CPC 7, the real effect of improvement was observed for the maximum strain with 

an increasing of 6.7%. It seems that suberin can act as plasticizer agent during the extrusion process, 

reducing the stiffness and contributing with some additional flexibility to the composite material. This 



Chapter 6 – Functionalized cork-polymer composites (CPC) by reactive extrusion using suberin and 

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

224 

effect of suberin on the composites resembles in part its function on the cork material, being 

responsible for the elasticity on the cork material [7]. Moreover, glycerol is the principal monomer of 

suberin [13], which is used as plasticizer on composite systems [34, 35]. The challenge on the 

production of CPC with a high cork content using extrusion is the poor processability of the components, 

which may result in inadequate properties of the resulting composite. The use of suberin acting as bio-

based plasticizer can reduce the high friction created by the cork, reducing the shear during the 

extrusion process.  

Surprisingly, the introduction of 2 wt% of lignin in the presence of BPO (CPC 4) increased the maximum 

tensile strength in 48% and the tensile modulus in 39% and decreased the maximum strain. The result 

confirms the high effectiveness of lignin as coupling agent, improving the interfacial adhesion and 

providing stress transfer from the matrix to the natural filler. The function of lignin as coupling agent is 

enabled by the presence of both aliphatic and polar hydroxyl groups, which provide compatibility 

between nonpolar polymers and lignocellulosic materials [22, 23, 36], such as cork. The increase of 

the lignin content (CPC 5) does not contribute to an additional increase on the mechanical performance. 

On the contrary, it results on a reduction of the maximum tensile strength.  On the other hand, we also 

found that the feeding of lignin in the hopper system of the extruder (CPC 6) is not so effective to 

promote strength but increases the maximum tensile strain. Probably, the higher residence time of the 

lignin in the extruder promoted a better dispersion of lignin and consequently of cork phase in the 

polyethylene matrix increasing the maximum strain in 5.7%. 

6.3.5 Dimensional Stability  

After processing, the moisture content of the developed composite specimens was determined, being 

the highest for CPC 1, with 0.313 ± 0.004 %, and the lowest for CPC 3, with 0.276 ± 0.011 %, 

corresponding to the functionalized composite with suberin. The functionalized CPC with the addition of 

lignin (CPC 4) presented 0.291 ± 0.009% of moisture content. 

The water uptake behaviour of the different CPC was examined as a function of the time see in Figure 

6.9. In the absence of coupling agent a faster water uptake was observed when compared with the 

functionalized composites due to the hydroxyl groups from cork which are available for interaction with 

water molecules.

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

225 

 

Figure 6.9. Water absorption behaviour of the HDPE-cork composites with and without coupling agent, 

being PE-g-MA the coupling agent based on maleic anhydride. 

 

Even for the maximum period of immersion studied (360 h), the water uptake for the composites was 

inferior to 1.7%, which is a clear advantageous property for many applications. The use of coupling 

agent significantly reduces the water absorption of the developed composites. The specimens with 

suberin and lignin absorb less water comparing with the unreinforced cork-polymer composition. In the 

firsts 24h of immersion in water the CPC 1 absorbed 0.59 ± 0.06 wt.% of water while the CPC 3 

containing 2 wt% of suberin only absorbs 0.40 ± 0.02 wt.%. This difference is more evident after the 7 

days of immersion were the CPC 3 absorbs less 32.5% of water comparing with the condition of the 

CPC 1 and less 66.3% comparing with the composite containing 2wt% of lignin (CPC 4). This result 

supports the idea that suberin and lignin can act as coupling agent, reducing the moisture content and 

the water absorption of the CPC in a similar way to what was observed for the composite containing PE-

g-MA. Moreover, suberin has a hydrophobic character that contributes to the low permeability of cork 

[4]. The addition of 1 wt.% of benzoyl peroxide could also be responsible to react with some hydroxyl 

groups from the cork structure, further contributing to reducing the water absorption.  

The thickness swelling variation for all the composites was less than 0.4% as presented in Figure 6.10. 

It was observed that the coupling agent effect promotes less thickness variation. Increasing the lignin 

content (CPC 5), leads to a lower thickness variation. For the functionalized CPC and after the period of 

15 days the thickness swelling variation tends to stabilize.

6.4 Conclusions 

The following conclusions can be drawn base on the results presented in this work. Suberin and lignin 

fractions, isolated from cork, presents sufficient thermal stability to be applied in melt based 

technologies such as extrusion and compression moulding. A reactive twin-screw extrusion process was 

used to obtain the cork-polymer composites (CPC) in a continuous process. The mechanical tensile 

tests indicated that the suberin and lignin can be successfully used as bio-based coupling agents in the 

presence of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to produce functionalized CPC with superior mechanical properties. 

Preferably, suberin acts as a plasticizer, improving the cork dispersion and reduces the composite 

stiffness, providing additional flexibility and formability to the composite. Lignin shows to act as a 

coupling agent and the use of 2wt% of lignin improved both maximum tensile strength and modulus in 

48% and 39% respectively. Increasing the amount of lignin to 4 wt.% reduces the mechanical 

performance of the composites. The extrusion process shows that the addition of lignin in the feed 

hopper of the extruder is not advantageous and only increases the maximum tensile strain. The tensile 

tests also reveal that the use of 2 wt% of PE-g-MA increases 34% the maximum strength, 30% the tensile 

modulus and reduces the maximum strain. Coupling agents in CPCs play a very important role in 

improving compatibility and adhesion between the polar cork material and the non-polar polymer 

matrices. The CPCs present low water uptake and thickness swelling variation. The use of coupling

lignin from cork as coupling agents 

 

227 

agent based on maleic anhydride or by adding suberin or lignin further reduces considerably the water 

uptake of the composites. The thermal properties showed that lignin can act as a thermal protective 

agent and suberin act as an antioxidant agent on the composites, while the PE-g-MA act as both. 

Coupling agents obtained from renewable resources may constitute a viable alternative to existing 

petroleum derivatives, contributing for a sustainable development of structural materials.

Abstract 

Composites from high density polyethylene filled with cork powder and coconut short fibres, in two 

different ratios, were prepared in a twin-screw extruder followed by compression moulding process. The 

main motivation of this work was to improve the mechanical performance without compromising the 

use of high weight percentage of natural component used in the preparation of cork-based composites. 

The morphology of the hybrid composites were more homogeneous in the presence of the coupling 

agent (CA) displaying enhanced fibre-matrix adhesion. Moreover, the use of CA based on maleic 

anhydride promotes a mechanical reinforcement effect on the tensile properties, including the 

elongation at break. The addition of coconut fibre resulted on an increase of 27% in elastic modulus and 

47% in the tensile strength when compared with the unreinforced cork-based (50 – 50) wt.% composite. 

This work clearly shows that the addition of 10 wt.% of short-coconut fibres, randomly distributed, can 

be effectively used as reinforcing strategy of cork-based composite materials, preferably in the presence 

of 2 wt.% of CA.

loading and coupling agent addition

7.1 Introduction 

Government regulations and a growing environmental consciousness throughout the world have 

generated a paradigm to move in the direction of designing materials compatible with the environment 

[1]. Over the past two decades, natural fibres have received considerable attention as a substitute for 

synthetic fibre reinforcements in polymeric materials. Natural fibres are increasingly used for 

reinforcement in thermoplastics over traditional reinforcing materials such as glass fibres and particle 

minerals (e.g. talc, CaCO3 and mica) due to their low cost, lightweight, good thermal and acoustic 

insulation, acceptable specific strength, reduced tool wear, corrosion resistance, availability, renewable 

resource and recycling possible with lower environment impact [2, 3], promoting the concept of 

sustainability. As a result of these advantages some of the plant fibre based thermoplastic composites 

have already found applications in furniture manufacture, non-structural building applications and as 

interiors parts in automotive industry [4-6]. Cork is the suberous covering tissue of the species Quercus 

Suber L., commonly known as the cork oak and the unique properties arise from the closed cell 

structure [7, 8]. During the last years there has been an increasing interest concerning cork based 

materials and its potential to be used in composite applications [5, 9, 10]. However, natural materials 

are inherently incompatible with hydrophobic thermoplastics such as polyolefins reducing the 

mechanical performance. Major limitations of using natural materials as reinforcements in such 

matrices include poor interfacial adhesion between polar-hydrophilic fibre and nonpolar-hydrophobic 

matrix, and difficulties in mixing due to poor wetting of the fibre with the thermoplastic matrix [11]. 

Previous studies on cork-polymer composites (CPC) have demonstrate that increasing the cork content 

the tensile mechanical properties are compromised and reduced [12, 13]. Reinforcement strategies of 

cork composites, such as the use of low amounts of coupling agent (CA) [14], or the use of 

conventional chemical modification methods of the natural component [15], can be applied to improve 

the compatibility and interfacial bonding between polymeric matrix and dispersed component. The 

motivation of this work was to prepare high performance cork based composites, in order to support 

tensile stresses developed in complex geometries or when submitted to finishing operations such as 

lamination, by using natural fibres preferably in combination with a CA. Additionally, studies involving 

hybrid bio-fibre systems containing cork powder through melt based technologies have not been 

addressed so far. Therefore composites comprising these two kinds of natural materials (e.g. cork and 

coconut fibre) may exhibit the desirable properties of the individual constituents. Coconut fibre, or coir,

loading and coupling agent addition

is a versatile lignocellulosic fibre obtained from coconut trees (Cocos nucifera), which grow extensively 

in tropical countries. Sri Lanka and India are considered to be the major coir fibre producers in the 

world. Coconut fibres may be decomposed in 20–30 years in the nature, and it may be regarded as an 

environmentally friendly material [16]. Chemical composition [7, 17-20] of both natural materials is 

presented in Table 7.1.

Coconut fibres as already been used to reinforce polyolefins [4, 21-23]. Both coconut fibres and cork 

are used as insulator material in thermal and acoustic applications [24, 25] and presents lower 

hydrophilic behaviour when compared with sisal fibre [26]. In this study, high density polyethylene 

(HDPE) was selected as the matrix to develop the hybrid cork-based composites because:  HDPE 

presents a good balance property range, is easy to process through melt based technologies, such as 

extrusion and compression moulding, and is a high consumption industrial polymer that presents low 

price in the market which is of significant importance to the ‘cost-performance’ assessment. 

Additionally, it requires a relatively low processing temperature, which is essential because of the 

relatively low thermal stability of both natural components. In this work, we report the effect of using 

coconut fibre as a reinforcement material, preferably in the presence of 2 wt.% of CA, to promote higher 

mechanical performance of the cork-based composites. 

7.2 Materials and Methods 

7.2.1 Natural Materials 

Cork sanding powder, with particle size &amp;lt;500 µm and specific weight of 157 ± 2 kg m-3 and a humidity 

of ~5.4% was collected at the Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio  Oleiros, Portugal) industrial facilities. 



Chapter 7 – Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre 

loading and coupling agent addition 

 

235 

The brown coconut fibre from Hayleys Exports PLC (Kotugoda, Srí Lanka) presented a diameter of 

277.4 ± 38.8 µm, a humidity of 8.2 % and specific weight of 845.1 ± 46.6 Kg m-3, was collected at 

Amorim Isolamentos S.A. (Vendas Novas, Portugal). 

7.2.2 Polymer materials and coupling agent 

A commercially available polyethylene (HMA – 025), HDPE, with a MFI of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 

kg), with a melting point of 132.5 ºC from ExxonMobil (Germany) was supplied by Pallmann 

Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp;amp; Co. (Germany) in the powder form with particle size between 125 ?m and 

1500 ?m. The used coupling agent, a HDPE functionalized with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 

0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride, was Exxelor PE 1040, with MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), 

and a melting point of 131.3 ºC, from ExxonMobil (Germany).  

7.2.3 Fibre diameter and density 

The diameter measurements of coconut fibres were made in five spaced locations along the gauge 

length of 30 different specimens using an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped 

with an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital camera. A histogram for the coconut fibre was performed and a 

normal distribution to characterize the coconut fibre diameter. Regarding cork powder, the particle size 

was determined used an analytical sieve (Retsch. AS 200, Germany) after a sieving period of 5 min at a 

medium amplitude. The density of the coconut fibres and of the hybrid cork based composites were 

determined according to the standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a 

stationary support for the immersion vessel using liquid propanol. 

7.2.4 Chemical characterization 

To confirm the existing differences in chemical composition, both natural materials were analysed using 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-

Prestige 21. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the 

spectra were acquired between 4400 cm-1 to 800 cm-1 using a resolution of 4 cm-1.

7.2.5 Composites processing 

Before compounding all natural raw materials were pre-dried at 80 ºC during 24 h to stabilise the cork 

and the coconut fibres in terms of moisture content. The moisture content, determined by oven-dry 

weight before processing, was found to be 1.5-3%. The prepared compositions and processing 

conditions such as barrel temperature and screw speed are summarized in Table 7.2.

The compounding was performed in a counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion machine (Carvex, Portugal), 

which had a screw diameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of 18 with a nonintermeshing, mixing mode 

screw configuration. The barrel temperature was in the range 130-160 ºC, and the screw speed was 

fixed at 30 rpm. The cork powder and the grinding HDPE were pre-mixed and manually feed in the 

hopper system with the cut coconut fibres. No extrusion head was used in order to minimize the 

residence time and shear heat dissipation. The extruded material was cooled in air, granulated in a 

cutting mill to produce the composite pellets with dimensions ? 7 mm. In a further step, the obtained 

pellets were compression moulded using a hydraulic press (Moore, UK) to produce boards with 186 × 

118 mm2 and 3 mm of thickness from the different compositions. The mould temperature was 150 ºC 

and the material was 8 minutes without pressure followed by 2 minutes under pressure of 1.42 MPa. 

Tensile bars in dog bone shape were obtained from these boards using a computer numerical control

237 

CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK). After cut the hybrid composites are compact and do not 

present macroscopic porous or voids. The specimens were produced according to ISO 527–2. 

Nonetheless, its thickness is slightly higher (3 mm) than the standard. 

7.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy 

The morphology of the natural fibres and the fracture surface of the tensile tested composite specimens 

were analysed using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron microscope (SEM). 

Before being analysed all the specimens were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd alloy (80-20 wt.%) 

in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). 

7.2.7 Mechanical properties 

Tensile properties of the bundle coconut fibres were measured with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, 

(USA) using a 1 kN load cell, a crosshead speed of 1 mm.min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. 

Prior to testing, fibres were mounted on sturdy paper frames using a high-strength epoxy adhesive and 

placed in a desiccator for a minimum of 48 h.  

The tensile properties of the developed cork based composites reinforced with coconut fibres were 

determined in the same equipment according the standard ISO 527–2, using a gauge length of 20 mm. 

The tensile force was taken as the maximum force in the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was 

estimated from the initial slope of the stress–strain curve (between 0.05 and 1% strain) using the linear 

regression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A 

crosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 was used until rupture. The average and standard deviations were 

determined using 8 specimens per condition. To allow for a comparison of the material property profiles 

in terms of the potential for reinforcement of the mechanical performance, the Ashby plots for the 

specific tensile modulus against the specific strength are illustrated for absolute property values with the 

respective standard deviations. 

7.2.8 Statistical analysis 

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison tests was used to 

infer about significant differences between mean values of the mechanical properties in the developed

238 

cork composite materials. Assumptions of ANOVA such as normality were evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk 

test. A level of ? = 0.05 was used for statistical significance. 

7.3 Results and Discussion

The main absorption bands are attributed to the presence of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, 

characteristic of natural fibres (Table 7.1), being cellulose (43 wt.%) the principal component of the 

coconut fibre and suberin (33 - 45 wt.%) the one for cork. In both native materials, the IR spectrum 

shows a large band in the 3200–3600 cm-1 range that is attributed to the axial deformation of the O–H 

group. The absorption spectrum on the infrared region of the coconut fibre presents a characteristic 

band at 2920 cm-1 that is related to the axial deformation of C–H group. The carbonyl group of the 

hemicelluloses appears at 1620 cm-1, while the band at 1236 cm-1 is associated to the presence of C–

O–C in cellulose chain. The strong absorption band at 1047 cm-1 is related to the C–OH stretching 

vibration. Concerning to cork spectrum (Table 7.1) and, according to the literature [19], the bands at 

2920 cm-1 and at 2852 cm-1 are related to suberin, cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, low molecular weight 

compounds and polysaccharides. The C=O elongation at 1738 cm-1 is characteristic of the ester group 

present on the suberin chain.

Cork powder, obtained from the sanding process, is composed of: a high percentage (88.2 wt.%) of 

particle with a size lower than 250 µm, a small fraction (11wt%) between 1 mm - 250 µm and a 

residual part (less than 1wt%) between 2-1mm (Figure 7.2 a). The histogram of Figure 7.2 c) shows the 

diameter distribution of coconut fibre, with the mean value of 277.4 µm and a gaussian fit distribution.  

The coconut fibre used to reinforce the cork-based composites presents a broad fibre diameter 

distribution of [71.8 – 465.6? ?m for a confidence interval of 95%. Cork powder presents reduced 

density and lower initial moisture content when compared with the coconut fibre as presented in Table 

7.3.

The determined density of the used coconut fibres is similar to the HDPE matrix, although the literature 

typically reports higher values of 1150 kg/m3 [17] for this natural fibre. The morphological analysis 

revealed that cork powder presents several cells despite its reduced particle size (Figure 7.2 b). This 

anisotropic foamed material presents a close cellular structure [7] where the section of the cork particle 

shows preferentially the radial direction. The morphology of the coconut fibres was also analysed and 

the results are shown in Figure 7.2 d). The obtained SEM image shows a representative top surface of 

the coconut fibre displaying many pinholes on the surface (‘rotten wood’-like appearance) [26].  The 

inset image presents the cross-section of the coconut fibre, which can be more or less cylindrical, 

containing axially oriented cells/fibrils of around 10 µm diameter. These observations are in accordance 

with the results reported in literature [22, 26]. The mechanical tests of the coconut fibres revealed an 

higher mechanical performance than the thermoplastic matrix (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.3). The coconut 

fibres have a maximum tensile strength of 134.3 ± 34.5 MPa and tensile modulus of 2.16 ± 0.62 GPa. 

It was also observed that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the fibres is inversely proportional 

to the fibre diameter: both properties decrease with increasing fibre diameter (Figure 7.3). According to 



Chapter 7 – Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre 

loading and coupling agent addition 

 

241 

the linear regression analysis, this result was observed for 81% of the tested fibres. The strain at break 

for coconut fibres was 34.4 ± 4.7%. This higher failure strain capacity of the coconut fibres, as 

compared with other natural fibres, can also contribute for a better strain compatibility between the 

fibres and the polyethylene matrix, making them and interesting material to be used in short-fibre filled 

composites.

The micrographs of the cork-polymer composite (50 - 50) wt.% or CPC 1 composition (Figure 7.4 b) 

shows the cork powder cell walls in contact with the polyethylene matrix. This image reveals also a 

fragile fracture that is the result of the high volume content of cork powder. Moreover, the tensile 

fracture discloses that the cellular structure of cork powder is maintained but with a more compact 

morphology after the two processing steps of extrusion and compression moulding, explaining the 

densification that occurs on the lignocellulosic composites. The fracture surface of the composite 

prepared with the same cork/PE ratio and reinforced with 10 wt.% of short coconut fibre (CPC 5) was 

analysed and the results are shown in Figure 7.4 c) and d). From these images is possible to conclude 

that the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the polymeric matrix is poor. The untreated fibres 

appear to be free of any matrix material adhering to them. It can be also observed the presence of 

cavities between the coconut fibre and the cork-polymer components. Additionally, significant coconut 

fibre breakage was observed during pelletization process after conventional melt mixing, reinforcing the 

idea of low adhesion between coconut fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. Nevertheless, the addition of 

2% of maleic anhydride produced an opposite effect. The micrographs from the fracture surface of CPC 

6 of (Figure 7.4 e and f) show a good interfacial adhesion between the coconut fibres (10 wt.%) and the 

polymeric matrix. In this last case, the fracture of the coconut fibre occurred preferentially at the same 

level of the composite fracture. Generally, chemical coupling agents are molecules pocessing two 

functions [6]: the first is to react with the hydroxyl groups of cork and of cellulosic fibres (OH groups) 

and the second is to react with functional groups of the matrix. The expected result is the reduction of 

these groups that contribute to the hydrophilic character, promoting the compatibility between the 

matrix and the natural component. 

7.3.4 Composite mechanical properties 

7.3.4.1 Tensile properties and density 

Tensile tests were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the envisaged strategy aimed for 

improving the mechanical performance of the cork-polymer composites (CPC). Table 7.4 presents the 

experimental mean values with the standard deviation, the improvement on the mechanical properties 

in terms of variation (%) when compared with the CPC 1 cork-polymer (50 – 50) wt.%, the coefficient of 

variation (Cv) for each tested group and the density of the composite materials. In addition, Figure 7.5

loading and coupling agent addition

shows the tensile properties of the developed composites with the statistical relevant differences for a 

confidence level of 95%.  

The density of the cork based composites was in the range between 1032 to 1070 kg/m3. The 

presence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent (CA), promotes a positive effect.  This is shown by a slight 

decrease on the composite density, probably due to a better dispersion of the natural phase on the 

matrix.

with statistical significant differences (p&lt;0.05) and (ns) not significant, as using the one-way ANOVA 

method. 

 

Comparing the CPC 1 and CPC 2 is possible to observe an increase of 12.5% in the maximum tensile 

strength promoted by the CA. The results are in accordance with  the previous work using different 

qualities of cork powders with polyolefins processed by pultrusion [14]. When 5 to 10 wt.% of short 

coconut fibres (CPC 3 and CPC 5) were used an increase of 18.1 to 21.6% on the tensile modulus was 

achieve being the hybrid composites more stiffer. However, no significant differences were observed on 

maximum strength. Therefore, the use of fibres, without any additional physical or chemical treatment 

or additive, showed less efficiency than expected from their strength properties (see Table 7.3) due to 

the poor adhesive interaction between the matrix and coconut fibres. This was reflected on the almost 

insignificant increase on the tensile strength and reduction on ductility (Table 7.4). These results are in 

accordance with the morphological observations. On the other hand, the use of coconut fibres in 

combination with 2 wt.% of CA resulted in an significant increase of the tensile properties, independently 

of the amount of fibres used. These effect was more pronounced when it was used the higher fraction 

10 wt.% of coconut fibre (CPC 6), resulting in an increase of 46% on maximum strength and 27% on 

tensile modulus and higher maximum strain at break when compared with the unreinforced cork-

polymer composite (CPC 1). This considerable increment on the tensile properties is justified with the 



Chapter 7 – Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre

enhancement of the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibres promoted by the CA based 

on maleic anhydride that improves its ability to transfer stresses across the interface resulting on an 

increase of the mechanical properties of the final composite. The Cv percentages reported in Table 7.4, 

shows the weight of the standard deviation over the distribution.  The maximum and minimum values 

registered were 6.2% and 1.6% for tensile strength and, 9.8% and 3.3% for tensile modulus. The lowest 

Cv values were obtained for the composite with higher mechanical performance (CPC 6). This is a clear 

indication that the produced boards had low variation on the mechanical properties, supporting the idea 

of homogeneous hybrid composites with good distribution of the natural component in the matrix. 

7.3.4.2 Ashby diagram 

The mechanical properties of the different formulations were additionally organized in an Ashby diagram 

by plotting maximum tensile strength versus tensile modulus of the CPC with the respective both 

standard deviations (Figure 7.6).  

 

 

Figure 7.6. Ashby plot presenting the specific maximum tensile strength against specific tensile 

modulus of the cork-polymer composites (CPC) obtained by extrusion followed by compression 

moulding. 

 

The results plotted in the graph can be divided in three distinct regions: a first region corresponding to 

the mechanical properties of the cork based composites with and without the CA (CPC 2 and CPC 1 



Chapter 7 – Novel cork-polymer composites reinforced with short natural coconut fibres: Effect of fibre

respectively); a second region corresponding to the composites just reinforces with fibres (CPC 3 and 

CPC 5); and a third region corresponding to composites reinforced with fibres and treated with maleic 

anhydride - composites with higher tensile strength (CPC 4 and CPC 6). In Figure 7.6 the results were 

also divided just in two regions: a bottom region corresponding to the composites prepared without CA 

and presenting lowest values of tensile strength but similar tensile modulus; and a top region 

corresponding to the composites with highest values of tensile strength and tensile modulus. 

Interestingly, the diagram highlights the importance of the combine effect of CA based on maleic 

anhydride and the addition of coconut fibres as reinforcement strategy on cork-polymer composites. 

7.4 Conclusions 

The mechanical reinforcement strategy of cork powder composites using random discontinuous 

distributed coconut fibres through melt based technologies was investigated. The morphological 

observations were in accordance with the mechanical results, showing the improved effect of fibre-

matrix adhesion in the presence of 2 wt.% of coupling agent (CA) based on maleic anhydride. The Ashby 

diagram supported to identify the best developed composite formulation and to visualize the 

improvement over the cork powder - polymer (50-50) wt.% composite. The incorporation of 10 wt.% of 

coconut fibre in the presence of 2 wt.% of CA on the cork-based composites presented an increase of 

46% on the mechanical properties in terms of tensile maximum strength of and 27% in terms of tensile 

modulus comparing with the unreinforced cork-polymer composite solution. Additionally, the presence 

of CA increases the maximum strain values in all processed composites.  

The maximum values registered in terms of coefficient of variation for this reinforced cork-based 

composite solution was 3.3% for the tensile modulus and 1.6% for the tensile strength properties. The 

lower coefficient variation supports the homogeneous properties in terms of short fibre distribution on 

the novel hybrid cork-based composites. With this strategy it was possible to both improve the 

mechanical performances of cork-based composites and to increase the natural component up to 54 

wt.% on the novel hybrid cork-based composite materials.

Abstract 

In this study, we investigated the use of short sisal fibre with and without polyethylene-graft-maleic 

anhydride (PE-g-MA) as a strategy to reinforce cork-polymer composite (CPC) materials. The use of 

alkali treatment of sisal to improve fibre-matrix adhesion was evaluated. High density polyethylene 

(HDPE) was used as matrix and the composites were produced in a two-step process using twin-screw 

extruder followed by compression moulding. FTIR, TGA and XRD were used to confirm the sisal fibre 

modification. Additionally, morphology, density, diameter and tensile properties of the fibres were 

evaluated before processing. The hybrid composites containing cork powder (40wt%) and randomly 

distributed sisal fibres were evaluated in terms of morphology and mechanical properties. The use of a 

10 wt.% sisal fibre in the presence of a 2 wt.% coupling agent based on maleic anhydride, has shown to 

improve the tensile and flexural properties of the composites. The higher mechanical properties were 

achieved by using alkali treated sisal fibres and PE-g-MA. In the presence of the coupling agent the 

composite morphology revealed good interfacial adhesion between the natural components and the 

polypropylene matrix, being in accordance with the mechanical results. Weibull cumulative distribution 

was successfully used to accurately predict the tensile strength failure of the hybrid CPC materials.

8.1 Introduction 

In the last years, natural fibres reinforced composites have received high attention due to their low 

density, excellent thermal properties, low cost, biodegradability, availability, non-toxicity and absorbing 

CO2 during their growth [1-4]. Although, certain drawbacks, like incompatibility with the hydrophobic 

polymer matrix, the tendency to form aggregates during processing and the low resistance to moisture, 

reduce the potential  of using  natural fibres as reinforcement in polymers [2, 3, 5]. The incompatibility 

may cause problems in the composite processing and in the material´s properties. The highly polar 

character of natural fibres has inherently low compatibility with nonpolar polymer matrices, especially 

hydrocarbon matrices such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) [5]. As a result, the polymer 

matrix is unable to transfer the stress to the filler through the interface when submitted to mechanical 

load, being the reinforcement efficiency reduced. Moreover moisture makes the use of natural fibre 

reinforced composites less attractive. Applying pre-treatments to the natural fibres can clean and 

chemically modify their surface, reduce the moisture absorption and increase surface roughness. These 

methods are able to ameliorate the fibre-matrix adhesion with a positive effect on the mechanical 

properties [4, 6-9]. A classic method of cellulose fibre modification is mercerization, which is an alkali 

treatment where the natural and artificial impurities are removed, leading to fibrillation of the fibre 

bundle to smaller fibres [6, 10, 11], meaning lower fibre diameter and increasing the aspect ratio [10] . 

The proper conditions of mercerization ensure the improvement of the tensile properties [3, 11, 12]. 

Cork is the bark of the oak (Quercus suber L.) which is periodically harvested each 9 to 12 years [13]. 

This lignocellulosic material holds environmental benefits to be applied on a new generation of 

composite materials [14-16]. Just a few studies were performed to improve the cork-matrix 

performance of cork based composites using different strategies, including: (i) chemical modification of 

cork [15], (ii) the use of coupling agents [15, 17] to promote cork-matrix bonding and (iii) the use of 

different natural or synthetic fibres to reinforce cork-polymer matrices [18-20]. The incorporation of 

different types of fibres into a single matrix has led to the development of hybrid composites. Hybrid 

composite materials that contain two or more types of fibre combine the advantages of one type of 

fibres with the lacking of properties in the other. As a consequence, a balance in cost and performance 

could be achieved through proper material design [21]. The properties of a hybrid composite depend on 

parameters such as fibre content, length and orientation of the fibres, fibre to matrix bonding and 

arrangement of the different fibres. The strength of the hybrid composite is also dependent on the 



Chapter 8 – Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre 

treatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction 

 

254 

failure strain of individual fibres. Maximum mechanical performance results are obtained when the 

fibres are highly strain compatible [22]. Sisal fibre is a cellulosic fibre obtained from leaves of an 

annually harvasted plant, called Agave sisalina and is one of the strongest of all plant fibres [8, 23].  

The aim of this work was to develop strategies to reinforce cork based composites with natural fibres, 

with and without chemical treatment, in the presence of low amounts of the coupling agent to 

ameliorate the mechanical properties. The production of hybrid composites was tested to obtain a 

composite with enhanced performance that could be used in complex geometries without failure, where 

cork cannot compete alone. Additionally one and two step extrusion processes were tested to evaluate 

the correct form to obtain the hybrid cork-polymer pellets reinforced with sisal fibres, to be applied in 

the compression moulding process in order to produce specimens of reinforced cork composites.  The 

properties of the composites depend on the individual components and fibre-matrix interfacial 

compatibility. The Weibull distribution provides a reliable possibility to predict the tensile strength of a 

needed composite material, and this should be taken into account by the designer [24, 25]. Therefore, 

in this work we also consider the Weibull distribution to be a viable tool to predict the tensile strength 

failure of the novel hybrid composites under analysis. 

 

8.2 Experimental section 

8.2.1 Materials 

Cork powder, with an average particle size &amp;lt;500 µm a specific weight of 157 ± 2 kg m-3 and a humidity 

of ~5.4% was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio Oleiros, Portugal). The sisal fibre from 

Madagascar, presents a diameter of 183 ± 35 ?m and moisture of ~11.3 %. The chemical composition

The matrix was a high density polyethylene, HDPE (HMA – 025) from ExxonMobil (Germany), with a 

MFI of 8.2 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 136.6 ºC. The coupling agent, a HDPE 

grafted with maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA), containing 0.5 to1.0 wt% of maleic anhydride (Exxelor PE 

1040) with MFI of 1.4 g.10min-1 (190 ºC, 2.16 kg), and a melting point of 131.3 ºC, produced by 

ExxonMobil (Germany). The polymer and the coupling agent were supplied by Pallmann 

Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp;amp; Co. (Germany) after use a pulverizing system for plastics with particle size of 

250 ?m to 1.2mm.  

8.2.2 Sisal fibre surface modification - Alkali treatment 

The preparation of alkali treated sisal (Sisal_NaOH) was as follows [28]: the sisal fibres were immersed 

in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (5% w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. After that the fibres were 

washed with distilled water containing a few drops of acetic acid. Final washings were carried out with 

distilled water until neutrality (pH = 7), to remove the excess of NaOH present on the fibres, until this 

water no longer indicated any alkalinity reaction. Then, the fibres were air-dried at room temperature, 

followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 70 ºC and after stabilise was stored in polyethylene bags.  

8.2.3 Composite production 

Before compounding all raw materials were pre-dried at 80ºC during 16h to stabilise the cork and the 

sisal fibres in terms of moisture content. After that the sisal fibres were cut in dimensions &amp;lt;20 mm. 

The prepared compositions and processing conditions are summarized in Table 8.2. The compounding 

was performed in a counter-rotating twin-screw extrusion machine (Carvex, Portugal) which had a screw 

diameter of 52 mm and an L/D ratio of 18. The barrel temperature was in the range 130-160 ºC, and 

the screw speed was fixed at 30 rpm. The cork powder and the grinding HDPE were pre-mixed and 

manually in small portions and feed in the hopper system with the sisal fibres. No extrusion head was 

used in order to minimize the residence time and shear heat dissipation. The extruded material was 

cooled in air, granulated in a cutting mill to produce hybrid composite pellets with dimensions ? 6 mm. 

In a further step, compression moulding of the obtained pellets using a hydraulic press (Moore, UK) 

was applied to produce boards with 3mm and 6mm of thickness for tensile and flexural tests 

respectively.

The mould conditions included temperature of 150 ºC during 8 minutes and a pressure of 1.42 MPa 

was applied during the last 2 minutes. In the case of boards with thickness of 6mm the temperature 

was increased to 160 ºC. The cooling with water occurs in the mould under pressure [19]. Tensile and 

flexural specimens were obtained from these boards (see Figure 8.1), using a computer numerical 

control CNC machine (Roland 3D Plotter MDX-20, UK).

8.2.4 Fibre characterization 

8.2.4.1 Chemical characterization 

To confirm the chemical treatment, the fibres were analysed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 

spectroscopy. All the spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21. The attenuated total 

reflectance (ATR) methodology (PIKE Technologies) was used and the spectra were acquired between 

4400cm-1 to 800cm-1 using a resolution of 4cm-1. 

8.2.4.2 Crystallinity 

To detect the crystalline structure of cellulose in sisal, Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) 

diffractograms were recorded using the Bruker-AXS D8 Discover diffractometer in ?–2? geometry using 

Cu K?1,2 lines collimated with a Gobël mirror, a divergent slit of 0.6 mm, a detector slit of 1 mm and 

0.6 mm and a Ni filter. The data was collected from 6-50° with a step size of 0.04° and an acquisition 

time of 1º sec per step. The percentage of crystallinity (%Cr), performed using a fitting program, was 

calculated based on:  

 

%Cr = (Acryst / Atotal) × 100    (8.1) 

 

where  Acryst is the area below the diffraction peak of the  (002) plane, peak at 2?  = 22.5º, and from the 

(101) and (10 ) plane, peak at (13-18º), and Atotal is the area below the whole region in the XRD spectra 

representing the amorphous material in the cellulosic fibres.

The diameter measurements of sisal fibres with and without chemical treatment were made in five 

spaced locations along the gauge length of each specimen using an optical microscope Olympus BH-2 

(Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP11, (Japan) digital camera. A histogram for each type of 

sisal fibre was performed and a normal distribution to characterize and compare the properties of the 

fibre with and without chemical treatment. The density of the sisal fibres was determined according to 

the standard ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the 

immersion vessel. Five fibres were weighted per condition.

8.2.4.4 Thermal degradation 

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the 

sisal fibres and confirm the chemical modification. The thermal stability was determined using a TGA 

Q500 series thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in 

platinum pans, at a heating rate of 10 °C.min-1 from 50 °C to 600 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. All 

tests were repeated once. 

8.2.4.5 Mechanical properties of sisal fibres 

Single fibre tensile tests were measured with a Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) using a 1 kN 

load cell, a crosshead speed of 1 mm.min?1, and a fibre gauge length of 30 mm. Prior to testing, fibres 

were mounted on sturdy paper frames using a high-strength hot melt glue and placed in a desiccators 

for a minimum period of 48 h. The tensile properties of the single sisal fibres were determined 

according to the standard ASTM C 1557. 

8.2.5 Morphology of the fibres and the composites 

The morphological characterization of the natural fibres and the developed reinforced cork polymer 

composites fracture surface were examined using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning 

electron microscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with 

an Au/Pd alloy (80-20 wt. %) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). 

8.2.6 Mechanical properties of composites 

8.2.6.1 Tensile tests 

The tensile properties of the developed cork based composites reinforced with sisal fibres were 

determined in the same machine according the standard ISO 527–2. The tensile bars had a neck 

cross-section area of 3 × 4 mm2 and a neck length of 20 mm. The tensile force was taken as the 

maximum force in the force deformation curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of 

the stress–strain curve (between 0.05 and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were 

conditioned at room temperature for at least 48 h before testing. A crosshead speed of 5 mm.min?1 was

treatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction 

 

259 

used up to a strain at break. The average and standard deviations were determined using eight 

specimens per condition.  

8.2.6.2 Flexural tests 

Three point static flexural tests were carried out in accordance with standard ISO 178. The dimensions 

of the specimens used were 132 mm length, 13 mm width and 6 mm depth. The load was placed 

midway between the supports with a span (L) of 80 mm. The crosshead speed was 2.56 mm/min. The 

tested specimens were performed in an Instron 4505 Universal Machine (USA) equipped with a 1 kN 

cell load. For each condition, the specimens were loaded until the core break. The average and 

standard deviations were determined using 7 specimens.  

8.2.7 Statistical analysis 

The values obtained by tensile and flexural tests were analysed by the normality of the distribution of 

the mechanical results was evaluated using Shapiro-WilK test to evaluate their normal distribution at 

p&lt;0.05. The means were compared using a Two-Sample t-Test or the non-parametric Kolmogorov-

Smirnov (K-S) test and differences were considered significantly different at p&lt;0.05 (*). Additionally and 

in order to predict the failure probability of the developed hybrid cork composites the values obtained 

from the tensile tests were statistically analysed by using the two-parameter Weibull model, where the 

cumulative distribution function is given by [29]:

where F(x) is the probability of failure of a composite material subjected to a stress level x. In equation 

(2), ? and ? are two constants to be determined, known as the “scale parameter” or “characteristic 

strength” and the “shaper parameter”, respectively. Finally the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed 

to evaluate the goodness-of-fit to the data points.

8.3 Results and Discussion 

8.3.1 Sisal fibre properties 

8.3.1.1 Chemical characterization 

Natural fibres are chemically treated to remove lignin, pectin and waxy substances covering the external 

surface of the fibre cell wall [30]. The chemical composition change at the sisal fibre surface structure 

by the chemical treatment was characterized using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 8.2 shows the 

spectra region between 800 and 2000 cm-1 relative to unmodified fibre (Sisal), alkali treatment 

(Sisal_NaOH) which   revealed that some changes did occur. In agreement with other previous works, 

the significant weight loss of sisal fibre after alkali treatment (see Table 8.3) can be attributed to the 

partial dissolution of hemicellulose [31], lignin and pectin [11]. The FTIR spectra confirm the 

disappearance of the carbonyl band (between 1660 and 1760 cm-1), when the fibre was treated with 

NaOH.

It was also reported before that alkali treatment reduces hydrogen bonding due to removal of the 

hydroxyl groups by reacting with sodium hydroxide [30]. The slightly diminished intensity of around 

1610 cm-1 for the treated fibres could be attributed to the removal of some aromatic lignin-like 

impurities [31]. 

8.3.1.2 Crystallinity 

The result of X-ray diffraction present in Figure 8.3 reflects the influence of the surface treatment on the 

sisal fibres between the amorphous and crystalline regions.

treatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction 

 

262 

The spectra were almost similar; however, alkali-treated fibre peaks were more intense than untreated 

sisal peaks, which mean that the chemical treatment was able to remove part of the amorphous 

material covering the fibre, thus exposing the cellulose. Table 8.3 shows that a small increase on the 

cellulose crystallinity (% Cr) occurred when the sisal fibre was submitted to chemical treatment. The 

untreated sisal fibre has a %Cr of 24.1% that increases to 29.6% after chemical modification with NaOH. 

When the sisal fibre receives the alkali solution chemical treatment, the crystalline fraction of cellulose 

increased due to the partial elimination of  lignin during alkaline treatment, losing part of its amorphous 

component [11]. This result is in accordance with the FTIR analysis. In the literature it is also indicated 

that thermal treatments on sisal fibres does not change significantly the chemical composition for 

temperatures below 200 ºC and increases the degree of crystallinity [32], therefore it is also expected 

the occurrence of this phenomenon during the melt based processes of extrusion and compression 

moulding involving the use of sisal fibres. 

8.3.1.3 Diameter, density and morphology 

The fibre diameter variation and its morphology of both sisal fibres are present in Figure 8.4 and in 

Table 8.3. The Figure 8.4 refers to the diameter variation of the fibres in terms of mean and standard 

deviation, where the average fibre diameter decreases slightly with the surface treatment. Taking in 

consideration the Gaussian fit curve obtained from the histograms performed for the sisal fibres and 

presented in Figure 8.4a), the unmodified sisal fibre presents a diameter of [117.3 - 234.5? ?m for a 

confidence interval of 95%. The diameter of the Sisal_NaOH fibre presented in Figure 8.4c) was smaller 

than the unmodified sisal ranging from [85.3 – 197.7? ?m due to the alkali chemical treatment. The 

small increase on density was observed probably due to increase of the crystallinity after chemical 

treatment. In terms of morphology, the sisal fibre (Figure 8.4 b) consists of aligned fibrils with materials 

cementing the fibres together. After the chemical treatment a small reduction on the cell wall and fibre 

diameter (see Figure 8.4 d) was noticed. The alkali treatment leads to fibrillation of the fibre bundle into 

smaller fibres, reducing the diameter and increases the roughness [10].  After chemical treatment of 

the fibres, seems to be cleaner when compared with the unmodified sisal fibres.

micrographs) for: (a, b) sisal fibre; (c, d) sisal fibre with alkali treatment. 

 

8.3.1.4 Thermal degradation 

The TGA and DTG (first derivative of the TGA) curves of sisal fibres with and without chemical 

modification under nitrogen atmosphere are presented in Figure 8.5 a) and b) respectively. The TGA of 

the sisal fibre shows a two-step degradation process with a initial transition around 100°C is due to 

moisture evaporation. Cellulose is the main constituent of the cell wall of several lignocellulosic fibres 

such as wood and sisal. It is established in wood that the cellulose contains numerous hydroxyl groups 

that are strongly hydrophilic [33].

Figure 8.5. TGA curves of untreated and treated sisal fibres (a) and respective derivative curves (b). 

 

In the inset graph of Figure 8.5 a) evidences the lower moisture content in the fibres after alkali 

treatment that induces the hydrophobicity of the fibre. The onset degradation temperature of the alkali 

treated fibre is very similar to the untreated sisal fibre. With the TGA was possible to confirm that the 

chemical modification does not induce a negative effect on the thermal resistance of the fibres. Figure 

8.5 b) presents the derivative curve and was noticed in the fibre with alkali treatment the disappearing 

of the shoulder around 296 – 298 ºC that is attributed to the removal the hemicellulose [34], while 

lignin decomposition extended to the whole range from 200 ºC until 700 ºC, due to different activities of 

the chemical bonds present on its structure [11, 35]. The more intense degradation peak around 

351ºC to 364 °C presented in both fibres could derive from the degradation of cellulosic components 

present on the sisal fibres. In terms of residual mass at 595 ºC the sisal fibre presents 19.8% 

comparing with 24.2% for the alkali sisal treatment. 

8.3.1.5 Mechanical properties of sisal fibres 

The tensile properties of the single sisal fibre before and after chemical treatment are presented in 

Table 8.4. It is clear the higher tensile properties of the sisal fibre comparing to the thermoplastic 

polymers such polyethylene and polypropylene. Comparing the properties between the different fibres 

the mean values of maximum strength of the unmodified sisal is higher compared with the modified 

fibres. This may be related with the alkali chemical treatment that promoted the reduction of the fibre 

thickness and some removing of the hemicelluloses and lignin as discussed in the chemical 

characterization, promoting a more intense yellow colour to the sisal fibre.

The obtained high standard deviations values on the tensile test are in part related with the variation in 

the fibre diameter of the selected natural fibres. 

8.3.2 Composite morphology 

The properties of short fibre polymer composites are strongly dependent on the fibre volume fraction 

and on the orientation distribution. The fracture morphology of the cork based composites after tensile 

tests, obtained by scanning electron microscopy is presented in Figure 8.6. In the micrographs of 

Figure 8.6 a) and b) it is possible to observe the good adhesion between the cork and the polymeric 

matrix promoted by the use of the coupling agent. When the sisal fibres are added to the cork-polymer 

without the use of coupling agent (Figure 8.6 c and d), the fracture reveal voids from the pull-out of the 

sisal fibre indicating lower adhesion between the sisal fibres to the matrix. Additionally and at high 

magnification it was also observed the polymeric phase presents some stretching as compared with the 

previous composite CPC 2. Similar observation after mechanical tests was registered in a previous work 

using cork based composites obtained by pultrusion (pellets) follow by compression moulding [16]. 

Regarding the fibres with the alkali treatment we clearly observe at high magnification (Figure 8.6 f) 

particles of cork that are in contact along to the sisal fibre and there is a good linkage between the 

fibres and the matrix. The improvement of the adhesion was obtained by the combine effect of the low 

amount of coupling agent 2 wt% and the chemical modification of the sisal fibres.

8.3.3 Mechanical properties of composites 

8.3.3.1 Tensile tests 

Tensile tests were performed in order to evaluate the mechanical performance of the novel hybrid cork 

composites. Figure 8.7 summarizes the obtained properties, in terms of tensile modulus and maximum 

strength for the composites with polyethylene matrix.  

 

 

Figure 8.7. Mechanical properties of the reinforced cork-polymer composites with sisal fibres, when 

submitted to uniaxial tensile load. (*) Significant at 0.05; ns: non-significant at 0.05. 

 

The statistical significance between samples with and without sisal fibre reinforcement was compared, 

being CPC 2 the cork-polymer composite reinforced with 2 wt.% of coupling agent. Considering the data 

of Figure 8.7, it is clear the effect of the coupling agent on the increase in terms of tensile strength 

(16.8%) for the composites CPC 1 and CPC 2 containing polymer and cork as main constituents. This 

result it is in agreement with a previous study [17] when it was used 50 wt.% of cork powder from 

different industrial processes by pultrusion and compression moulding on the development of 

composites. The addition of 10 wt.% of unmodified sisal fibre (CPC 3), leads to a significant 

reinforcement in terms of modulus of 23%. Additionally, the sisal fibres and the cork act as filler since it 

reduces the strength due to the increase of the natural component on the hybrid composite. CPC 4 

presents the same composition as CPC 3 where the difference was the two extrusion step process to 

produce the composite pellets. The cork-polymer were first compounded into composite pellets and 



Chapter 8 – Hybrid cork-polymer composites containing sisal fibre: Morphology, effect of the fibre 

treatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction 

 

268 

then short sisal fibres were added in the cork-polymer composite pellets, to produce the hybrid 

reinforced composite. We observed that no improvements were noticed when we used a two-step 

extrusion process to produce the same hybrid composites. CPC 5 and CPC 6 are similar in terms of 

composition (see Table 8.2), where the important difference was the fibre treatment. Regarding the 

CPC 5 we can observe that the addition of 10 wt.% of sisal fibres in the presence of coupling agent 2 

wt.% improved significantly both stiffness  in 22% and the tensile strength in 28% of the hybrid 

composite. The improvement on the tensile properties was even higher by using the alkali treated sisal 

fibres, being 29 and 49% respectively due to the chemical surface modification and increase of surface 

roughness. Comparing with the polyethylene matrix, the developed hybrid cork based composites 

presents similar modulus values but a reduced strength performance. In the literature it is pointed that 

the use of coupling agents based on maleic anhydride (MA) increases the tensile strength of the 

composites due to the esterification reaction between sisal fibre hydroxyl groups and anhydride part 

which causes a reduction in interfacial tension and an increase in interfacial adhesion between 

thermoplastic and the fibre [36]. Similar hydroxyl groups are present in the chemical composition of 

cork and sisal fibres. The combined effect of the sisal fibre treatment with the presence of coupling 

agent based on MA for effective stress transfer across the interface enhances the adhesion between the 

interphases and consequently reinforces the tensile properties of the hybrid cork-polymer composites. 

8.3.3.2 Flexural tests 

Figure 8.8 displays representative stress-strain curves of the polyethylene matrix and the prepared cork 

composites with and without the reinforcement of sisal fibres after a three-point bending test. Figure 8.9 

presents the corresponding flexural modulus and the maximum strength mean values with the 

respective standard deviation for comparison.  Similar to the tensile behaviour results of the composites, 

the addition of 10 wt.% of sisal fibre without coupling agent (CPC 3) improves the stiffness; however it 

reduces significantly the flexural strength (see Figure 8.9) and reduces the strain at break as showing in 

Figure 8.8. The addition of coupling agent promotes mainly the flexural strength and the elongation at 

break (CPC 5). After chemical modification the resulting sisal fibres present a rough surface topography, 

with removal of surface impurities and removal of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups [30] improving the affinity 

with the thermoplastic matrix. The combined effect of the chemical modification of sisal and the use of 

2 wt.% of coupling agent (CPC 6) result in  hybrid composites with enhanced flexural performance. 

Comparing with the unreinforced composite CPC 1, it has higher stiffness 33%, higher flexural strength

98% and higher elongation at break due to the improvement on the interfacial adhesion between the 

matrix and the natural component.

270 

Additionally, it was possible to reinforce the high density polyethylene matrix in terms of modulus (16%) 

and strength (11%) at flexural load mainly after the sisal fibres alkali treated. In the literature it was 

found that the sisal fibre after alkali modification improves the dispersion of the fibres but not their 

adhesion to the polymer matrix, due to a higher availability of OH groups in the particles surface [37]. 

Alkali treatment may leads to fibre fibrillation i.e. breaking down of fibre bundles into smaller fibres; 

which increases the surface area available for contact with the matrix [32]. The treatment is in 

accordance with the morphology results obtained, leading to a considerable enhancement on the 

mechanical properties. Higher improvements might be achieved by using higher amount of the natural 

fibre based in the presence of coupling agent. However, the high increase of the viscosity will make 

difficult the melt based processes of formulations riches in natural materials based on fibres and 

particles. 

8.3.4 Weibull statistical analysis 

Tensile strength life distribution diagrams have been obtained by using the cumulative Weibull 

distribution function (Eq. 2) for cork-polymer composite reinforced with sisal fibres. Figure 8.10 

presents the reliability probability of survival (F) and can be found easily corresponding to any stress 

value from the diagram. The Weibull fit method was used to modelling the failure data of the hybrid 

composites when submitted to tensile load and compare the increase on the strength promoted by the 

sisal chemical modification. A very good agreement between the estimated strengths and experimental 

values is evident in Table 8.5, confirming the efficiency of the Weibull distribution in prediction the 

tensile strength failure properties of the developed hybrid composites. The tested composites present 

strength higher than 12.65 MPa see Figure 8.10. Comparing the estimated strength or probability of 

failure at 95% of confidence present in Table 8.5 for the cork-polymer composites (40-60) wt.%, the use 

of coupling agent improved in 20% the strength of the composite. The addition of the untreated sisal 

fibres with coupling agent (CPC 5) presents a higher improvement of 34% comparing with CPC 1 and 

an increase of 12% comparing with the CPC 2. The best results were obtained with sisal treated fibres, 

mostly using the sisal modified with NaOH that presents an increase of 55% and 30% comparing with 

the CPC 1 and CPC 2, respectively. Several methods, such as Chi-square, the Anderson–Darling test, 

allow to determine the goodness of fit of a probability distribution to a set of data [24, 38].

271 

 

Figure 8.10. Tensile strength of the cork-polymer composites reinforced with sisal fibre. Lines show 

Weibull distribution with parameters values shown in Table 8.4. 

 

In this study, the goodness-of-fit test was carried out by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test that is 

used for statistical analysis of composites. The procedure was partially adapted from [39]: 

(1) Since the K-S is a distance test, it was determined the maximum deviation Dn = Fn – F0 and Dn- 

= F0 – Fn-1. Being Fn the cumulative observed values and F0 the Weibull cumulative distribution 

function present in the equation 2. 

(2) K-S tables of critical values (CV) are valid when the distribution parameters are known. Since 

the distribution parameters were estimated from the experimental data the CV will be 4 ? ? 

value [24], i.e. for a significance level of ? = 0.05 that means ?´ = 0.20. For n=8 and a 

significance level of ? = 0.05, the Dnc = 0.358. 

(3) If Dn &amp;lt;Dnc, the null hypothesis that the observed data follow the Weibull distribution is accepted. 

The Weibull parameters and K-S goodness-of-fit test are listed in Table 8.5. The K-S statistic Dn values 

presented in Table 8.5 and obtained after the test are between 0.17 and 0.23, indicating that the 

tensile strength of the developed hybrid composites is strongly explained by the Weibull cumulative 

distribution because it departs significantly from the value of significance level ? = 0.05 and a sample 

size of n=8 for which the K-S of fit test was performed.

8.4 Conclusions 

Cork-polymer composites (CPC) reinforced with sisal discontinuous fibres has shown to be a viable 

strategy to obtaining structural materials with improved mechanical performances in terms of tensile 

and flexural properties. The improvement on the mechanical properties was effective when a 2 wt.% of 

coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA) was used, since the mechanical properties increased in 

terms of stiffness, strength and elongation at break.  The improvement of the interfacial adhesion 

between the matrix, the cork and sisal fibres was also confirmed by the fracture morphology. In terms 

of processing to obtain the hybrid CPC pellets, there is no advantage in the use of two melt extrusion 

steps and add the sisal fibres only in the second step. This study demonstrates that the mechanical 

properties of CPC can be improved by: 1) the addition of a 2 wt.% of the coupling agent based on MA; 

2) the sisal fibres addition (10 wt.%) without the use of a coupling agent, resulting in a hybrid CPC with 

similar modulus properties and with lower thermoplastic content and 3) by the  combined effect of the 

addition of alkali treated sisal fibres with the use of the coupling agent resulting in composites with 

considerably higher mechanical properties. Under flexural load and using alkali treated sisal fibres with 

coupling agent in the new composites an increase of 33% in modulus and an increase of 98% in 

strength were obtained when compared with unreinforced cork composites. Comparing the improved 

mechanical properties of the hybrid CPC with the polyethylene matrix, it was possible to reinforce the 

matrix in terms of stiffness and strength at flexural load manly after the sisal fibres alkali treatment. In 

terms of tensile strength, they present similar stiffness and lower strength when compared to the

treatment on the mechanical properties and tensile failure prediction 

 

273 

polyethylene matrix. The Weibull diagram was used to reliably identify the composites safety limits. The 

tensile strength of the hybrid reinforced CPC was found to be in agreement with the Weibull cumulative 

distribution, which can be used to accurately predict the mechanical performances in terms of strength 

of the developed hybrid cork composite materials.

 Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, 

mechanical, morphological and thermal properties8 

Abstract 

This work addresses to the preparation of biocomposites combining different biodegradable aliphatic 

polyesters with cork 30 wt.%. The lignocellulosic biomass was compounded with poly(L-lactic acid), 

(PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) and starch-poly-?-

caprolactone (SPCL) using twin-screw extruder prior to injection moulding into tensile samples. The cork 

biocomposites were engineered to satisfy acceptable stiffness, strength, and in-service durability while 

maintaining the tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. The physico-mechanical and 

morphological properties and thermal stability of the matrices and the bio-based cork composites were 

investigated. Moreover, the biodegradability of the materials under static water immersion and in soil 

burial tests was also monitored. This study shows that cork contributes to lightweight composite 

materials using PLLA and PHBV matrices and promotes an increase on the stiffness of PCL. Cork 

increases the thermal stability and the crystallinity degree of the biocomposites. The weight loss, 

thickness variation and the reduction in tensile properties of biodegradable composite in soil are 

significantly greater than those in water. The materials present low water absorption and the highest 

values corresponded to the biocomposites. The presence of cork contributes for the initial degradation; 

however at long time it slows the biodegradation rate due to cork microbial resistance. As expected, the 

use of starch biomass accelerates the biodegradation rate of the materials. Composites using 

biodegradable polymers with cork will contribute to increasing their market acceptance and for the 

development of novel sustainable products.

9.1 Introduction 

Lignocellulosic biomass represents a renewable, biodegradable, lightweight, abundant and cheap 

source of raw, making them attractive for the development of sustainable products [1-5]. Cork is the 

outer bark of an oak tree known botanically as Quercus suber L; being the major chemical constituents 

suberin (33-50%); lignin (13-29%); polysaccharides, (6-25%); and extractives (8.5-24%) [6, 7]. Cork 

reveals an anisotropic closed cellular structure as shown in Figure 9.1. It is composed of an aggregate 

of cells, about 42 million per cubic centimeter [8]. Cork is a lightweight material, elastic and 

impermeable to liquids or gases, good thermal, acoustic and electrical insulator, sound and vibration 

insulator and exhibits a near-zero Poisson coefficient, which found applications from the stoppers to 

aeronautics [6, 9-11].

and radial direction (R). 

 

Furthermore, cork composites are one of the most promising fields of cork technology [9]. The 

combination of cork biomass with polymers trough melt based technologies brought added-value to cork 

based materials that can open a wide range of innovative applications. Studies can be found on the 

combination of cork and cork by-products with polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene 

(PP) and the effect of coupling agent in the mechanical properties [12, 13], chemical surface 

modification to improve cork-polymer compatibility [14] and hybrid cork composite systems reinforced

with natural fibres [15-17]. Recently, the combination of the unique properties of cork with 

biodegradable matrices [18, 19] was also evolved to the production of more sustainable materials 

containing cork. A sustainable product is a product which will gives as little impact on the environment 

as possible during its life cycle [20]. One of the main drawbacks pointed to composites is the low 

sustainability due to the separation problems of the mixed materials [20]. One interesting approach is 

to consider the re-manufacturing of old products or the use of biodegradable polymers as matrices 

combined usually with biofibres as reinforcing element, to produce fully biodegradable materials, the so 

called biocomposites or green composites [1, 5, 21]. 

Biodegradable polymers and bio-based plastic products from renewal resources can form sustainable 

and eco-friendly products than can compete in the current market [4, 5, 22]. The worldwide capacity of 

bio-based plastics is expected to increase from 0.36 million metric ton (2007) to 2.33 million metric ton 

by 2013 and to 3.45 million metric ton in 2020 [2]. From the different biodegradable polymers it was 

defined 4 classes [23]: The agro-polymers (e.g. polysaccharides) obtained from biomass by 

fractionation such as starch and lignocellulosic products. The second and third are polyesters, obtained, 

respectively by fermentation from biomass or from genetically modified plants (e.g. 

polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) and by synthesis from monomers 

obtained from biomass (e.g. polylactic acid (PLA)). The fourth family are polyesters, totally synthesized 

by the petrochemical process (e.g. polycaprolactone (PCL)) [1, 3, 23]. The interest of these polymers 

has grown, since they present similar mechanical and thermal properties as compared with synthetic 

thermoplastic such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) [24]. The PLA and PHB reveal higher 

mechanical properties, with a modulus around 2.8 to 3.4 GPa and 1.0 to 2.1 GPa respectively [2, 4, 

25]. The aliphatic polyesters present proper mechanical and degradation properties that make them 

good candidates for several applications [21].  

The aim of this study was to produce and characterize different renewable resource derived-

biocomposites based on, poly(L-lactic acid), (PLLA); polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate, (PHBV); 

PCL and starch-poly-?-caprolactone (SPCL) combined with granulated cork through twin-screw extrusion 

followed by injection moulding. We hypothesized that by combining proper melt based technologies this 

study can provide information for basic properties of several cork biocomposites, as well as their major 

characteristics and degradation behavior under static water and soil burial conditions.

9.2 Experimental section 

9.2.1 Cork and polymer materials 

Cork granules, with an average particle size 0.5-1mm and specific weight of 166 ± 21 kg m-3, moisture 

of ~7.5 % was supplied by Amorim Revestimentos S.A. (S. Paio Oleiros, Portugal). The polymers used 

in the preparation of the cork based composites includes: i) PLLA used had L-lactide content of 99.6 % 

and a Mw of 69 000 g.mol-1, and was obtained from Cargill Dow LLC, USA; ii) PHBV polymer with 12% 

HV content and molecular weight (Mw) of approximately 425 692 g.mol-1 was provided by PHB Industrial, 

Serrana, Brazil; iii) PCL resin (commercially available as TONE® 787), with Mw of 125 000 g.mol-1, was 

obtained from Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Division, New Jersey, USA and iv) A blend of corn 

starch with PCL 30/70 wt.% (SPCL) was supplied by Novamont, Italy. It contained about 63 wt.% of 

PCL, 27 wt.% of corn starch and 10 wt.% of natural plasticizers. The Mw of PCL present in this blend is 

about 118 000 g.mol-1. 

9.2.2 Twin-screw extrusion compounding 

Prior to compounding all natural raw materials were pre-dried at 40 to 70 ºC during 24 h to stabilise in 

terms of moisture content and the polymers were thereafter reduced to a grain size less than 0.5 mm 

in a Ultra centrifugal mill from Retsch. The prepared compositions and processing conditions are 

summarized in Table 9.1. The raw materials were pre-mixed and then were compounded in a Rondol 

SCF modular co-rotating twin-screw extruder (TSE) with the screws diameter of 16 mm, a length to 

diameter ratio (L/D) = 25 and a single strand die of 3 mm. The mixture was placed in the hopper and 

automatically feeded at a constant rate with a volumetric dosing unit from SHINI Plastics Technologies 

(Germany). The temperature profile along the barrel to the die and the rotation screws was set 

according to the information present in Table 9.1. Part of the extrudate was cooled in water bath and 

subsequently ground by a lab pelletizer SCHEER (Stuttgart) to produce composite pellets with length ? 

5 mm suitable for injection moulding. Prior to this step, the produced pellets were dried in a vacuum 

oven at 50 ºC until stabilize.

9.2.3 Injection moulding 

The neat polymers and the biobased composite pellets were injection moulded in a Ferromatik-Milacron 

K85 (Germany) with 850 kN of clamping force. The injection-moulded specimens were tensile bars 

produced according ASTM 638, with 60 mm length, a constant rectangular cross-section of 2×4 mm2, 

and a neck length of 20 mm. The samples were placed in polyethylene plastic bags and conditioned at 

ambient temperature.  

9.2.4 Degradation testing 

The degradation tests involved both water and soil degradation tests. The water degradation tests were 

performed to determine the dimensional stability of the injection moulded specimens and to access to 

some biodegradability and the soil degradation tests were performed to monitoring the evolution of 

biodegradability of the specimens under soil conditions.

and thermal properties 

 

283 

9.2.4.1 Water degradation tests 

The dimensional stability tests included measurements of water absorption (WA), thickness swelling 

(TS), weight loss (WL) and moisture content (MC). The WA, TS and MC were measured according to the 

ASTM D 570. The specimens, previously obtained by injection moulding, were dried at 40 ºC in a 

vacuum oven during 48 h, stabilized in desiccator and the MC of the specimens was calculated as 

follows: 

 

   (1) 

 

where Ww is the weight of the specimen before drying (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying 

(g).  

Figure 9.2 a) represents the scheme of the water degradation tests. Each individual specimen was 

placed in a falcon tube containing 14 ml of distilled water. The water absorption (WA) was calculated by 

weighting the samples before and after immersed in distilled water at room temperature (23 ºC). The 

tests were conducted during 1440 h. 

 

 

Figure 9.2. Schematic representation of the degradation tests under a) water and b) soil conditions. 

 

The water absorption was calculated according to the Eq. (2): 

 

   (2) 

 

where Wa is the weight of the sample after immersion (g) and Wb is the weight of the same sample 

before immersion (g). The TS was determine by measured thickness of the sample before and after 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

284 

immersed in distilled water at room temperature (23 ºC) for different periods of time. The thickness 

swelling was calculated as follows: 

 

    (3) 

 

where T2 is the thickness of the sample after immersion (g) and T1 is the thickness of the same sample 

before immersion (g). The weight loss (WL) of the specimens was calculated as follows: 

 

   (4) 

 

where Wi is the initial weight of the specimen (g) and Wd is the weight of the sample after drying (g). For 

that purpose, the specimens were weighed using an analytical balance after being placed in a vacuum 

oven at 40 ºC for 48 h, cooled and stabilized in a desiccator several days followed by reweighing of the 

specimens. Averages of 5 specimens in each time point were used for TS, WA, MC and WL 

measurements. 

9.2.4.2 Soil degradation tests 

The injection moulded matrices and the biocomposite specimens were placed in vessels of 5 L used as 

soil containers and buried in soil. The physical and chemical composition of the compost is indicated in 

Table 9.2, indicating an organic matter higher than 70%.  

The specimens were monitored and removed at predetermined intervals of time test up to 4320 days 

as depicted in the scheme of Figure 9.2 b). The average room temperature was 19 – 21 ºC and relative 

humidity was kept at least 50 % by pulverizing the soil with distilled water and allowing continuous 

aeration. Once removed, samples were withdrawn carefully, placed in small nets to avoid disintegration 

of the specimen and washed with distilled water. After that, the samples where dried at 40 ºC in a 

vacuum oven to constant weight and kept in a desiccator, and then measured in terms of thickness 

variation and weight loss before undergo to further characterization. It was used averages of 5 

independent specimens in each time point per condition.

9.2.5 Composites density 

The density of the bio-based injection moulded specimens was determined according to the standard 

ASTM D 792, using an analytical balance equipped with a stationary support for the immersion vessel 

using liquid propanol. Fives specimens were measured per condition. 

9.2.6 Morphology 

The morphological characterization of the developed bio-based composites surface before and after 

degradation tests were examined using a NanoSEM 200 FEI (The Netherlands) scanning electron 

microscope (SEM). Before being analysed all the samples were coated by ion sputtering with an Au/Pd 

alloy (80-20 wt. %) in a high resolution sputter coater of Cressington 208HR (Watford, UK). 

9.2.7 Mechanical properties 

Tensile properties of the injection moulded specimens before and after water and soil degradation tests 

were measured using an Instron 4505 Universal Machine, (USA) according to the standard ASTM D 

638. The tests were conducted using a 1 kN load cell, with a gauge length of 20 mm and a crosshead 

speed of 5 mm.min?1 until rupture. The tensile force was taken as the maximum stress in the stress-

strain curve. Tensile modulus was estimated from the initial slope of the stress–strain curve (between 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

286 

0.5 and 1% strain) using the linear regression method. Samples were conditioned at room temperature 

for at least 48 h before testing. The average and standard deviations were determined using 5 

specimens per condition.  

9.2.8 Thermal properties 

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed to understand the degradation characteristics of the 

developed composites and their matrices. The thermal stability was determined using a TGA Q500 

series thermogravimetric analyser (TA Instruments, USA). Experiments were performed in platinum 

pans, at a heating rate of 10 °C.min-1 from 50 °C to 600 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. All tests were 

repeated once. 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the moulded specimens was assessed by 

DSC in a Perkin-Elmer, Pyris Diamond system at 20 ºC min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The DSC 

scans were performed in bulk specimens cut from the central part of the rectangular cross-section of 

the tensile specimens. The glass transition temperature (Tg), cold crystallization temperature (Tcc), 

melting temperature (Tm) and total enthalpy (?H) of all injection moulded materials were identified. The 

degree of crystallinity (?c) was calculated on the basis of a 100% crystalline a melting enthalpy of (?Hºm) 

of the used polymer and according to the Eq. (5): 

 

  (5) 

 

where ?Hcc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization before melting; ?Hm the enthalpy of melting and w is 

the weight fraction of the non-polymeric part in the composite. All the samples were repeated at least 

once. 

9.3 Results and discussion 

9.3.1 Degradation properties 

The physical properties of the injection moulded specimens include the moisture content (MC), water 

absorption (WA), thickness swelling (TS) and weight loss (WL) after water degradation tests and the WL

and TS after soil degradation tests. Additionally, it was measure the density of the specimens to 

determine the effect of the presence of 30 wt.% of cork on the produced materials. 

Figure 9.3 shows the schematic representation of the potential benefits of utilization renewable cork as 

forest biomass in bio-based products. In the scheme it is visualized the injection moulded specimens 

used in the tests.

We also present a fully bio-based polyerter cap for wine sealing with 30 wt.% of granulated cork 

obtained by injection moulding as prof of concept and as one of the potential uses for the developed 

fully natural products. 

 

9.3.1.1 Water degradation tests 

The MC of injection moulded specimens is present in Figure 9.4. It was observed the presence of some 

moisture in the specimens preferably in the biocomposites with cork. In the case of the biocomposites 

containing PLLA, PHBV and PCL as matrices the MC varied between 0.37 ± 0.03 and 0.55 ± 0.12 %. 

The SPCL matrix presents the high MC since the biomass starch is sensitive to moisture. In this case, 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

288 

the biocomposite containing SPCL as matrix showed a reduction in the MC of 0.25% where the 

hydrophobic character of cork promoted some stability to the material.  

 

Figure 9.4. Moisture contentin  the biodegradable polyesters and in the corresponding biocomposites 

after injection moulding.  

 

The behaviour of the specimens after water immersion tests are presented in Figure 9.5, revealing the 

water absorption (WA), weight loss (WL) and the thickness swelling (TS) variation in function of 

immersion time. The WA of the specimens shown in Figure 9.5 a) and b) was more sharp for the 

biocomposites containing 30 wt.% of cork. Since cork is a cellular material with closed cell structure [6, 

7], we suggest that the low water uptake up to 2 months is manly absorbed at the cork-polymer 

interface and in the available lenticular channels across the cells of cork. The lenticular channels 

constitute what is called the porosity of cork [7]. All the specimens tend to present higher values of 

water uptake in the first 15 days and after this period tend to reduce or approach to equilibrium. The 

lower sorption capacity of biocomposites seems to be related to the type of the biodegradable polyester 

used and with some possible cork-matrix interaction. Furthermore, the processing methodology may 

play an important role on the water absorption behaviour. In a recent study using PLA with 30 wt.% of 

cork powder compounding by melting mixing and followed by injection moulding, the materials 

exhibited WA values of 18% after 60 days [19]. In the present study, using a twin-screw extrusion 

followed by injection moulding, it WA was just 5.5 ± 0.1% . It is expected that the cork powder instead of 

the used granulated cork induced lower water resistance; however this difference of 3 times in the WA

and thermal properties 

 

289 

should also be the result of the processing methodology, revealing the adequated mixing effect 

promoted by the twin-screw extrusion process. 

  

  

  

Figure 9.5. Physical behaviour of the bio-based materials under water immersion tests: (a, b) water 

uptake, (c, d) weight loss and (e, f) thickness swelling variation.  

 

The SPCL blend contains around 30 wt.% of starch that is permeable to water, whereas the 

biocomposite PCL/Cork contains the same weight fraction in cork particles. Comparing in terms of 

water uptake in Figure 9.5 b), the absorption profile of the PCL/Cork biocomposite is more slowly in the 

first 7 days of immersion as compared with the SPCL. After a period of 2 weeks, they reach the 

maximum absorption with similar values and tend to stabilize. Furthermore, the weight loss graphic in 

Figure 9.5 d) displays that PCL/cork does not reveal a significant weight loss and follows the same 

trend as the PCL matrix, revealing a good physical interaction between cork and matrix. On the contrary, 

in the first 2 weeks of immersion, particles of starch are partially dissolved and released from the matrix 

surface due a lower interaction between starch and PCL and the weight loss occurs showing some

appetence to biodegradation in static conditions. In addition, the literature has evidenced that 

degradable synthetic polyesters, such as PCL are susceptible to hydrolytic degradation independently of 

the crystallinity fraction, because the ester groups are separated by CH2 groups, which impart some 

flexibility to the chain [24]. This polymer is definitely biodegradable but only under outdoor conditions. 

For instance, in the human body, it is slowly hydrolytically degradable [26]. Concerning the thickness 

swelling variation (TS) reported in Figure 9.5 f) the presence of starch tends to increase considerably 

the TS since the starch swells when immersed in water expanding the biocomposite. After the first two 

weeks, the blend with starch showed lower TS due to the obtained WL. The starch is a water soluble 

material [4, 27] and its consumption or release from the biocomposite might contribute to the decrease 

and stabilization of TS after the 30 days of immersion. The PLA and PHBV and its biocomposites does 

not showed significant WL or TS variation after the 2 months of immersion. 

9.3.1.2  Soil degradation tests 

The soil burial test can be considered a realistic approach to the biodegradation process in a waste 

landfill. The biodegradability of the injection moulded specimens with 2 mm thick under indoor soil 

burial conditions was monitored during 6 months. The evolution of biodegradation at different periods of 

time is shown in Figure 9.6 and the result of injection moulded specimens under test in Figure 9.7. The 

biodegradation of a polymer is described as a process that comprises the deterioration of its physical 

and chemical properties and a reduction of its molecular mass due to its conversion into CO2, H2O, and 

CH4 along with other low molecular weight products under the influence of microorganisms in both 

aerobic and anaerobic conditions [26]. The weight loss (WL) is one of is one of the most valuable data 

indicating the biodegradation of polymeric material after composting. Figure 9.6 a) and b) show that the 

WL of the specimens with PLLA and for the PLLA/Cork was negligible. Literature indicates that PLLA 

decomposes completely in proper compost environment to yield carbon dioxide and biomass [28]. In 

this work, the used soil and the temperature conditions may not be appropriated for the PLLA be 

decomposed by microorganisms such as fungi or bacteria. The soil temperatures were much lower 

(19–21 ºC) than the minimum temperatures inducing biodegradation of PLA (30 ºC, but better 40 ºC 

and higher, i.e. 58 ºC) simulating conditions at municipal and industrial composting facilities [29]. This 

explains why the rate of biodegradation of PLLA in burial soil conditions was rather low. After the period 

of 1 month the specimens containing PCL or SPCL as matrix starts to present a significant WL, around 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

291 

11% up to 18.5%, being more intense for the blend containing starch. At this stage, the WL of the 

biocomposites was lower since cork was not degraded. 

  

  
 

Figure 9.6. Physical behaviour of the bio-based materials under soil conditions: (a, b) weight loss and (c, 

d) thickness variation.  

 

Increasing the biodegradation time (2 months) lead to a WL of 10% for the PHBV and 8.5% for the 

PHBV/Cork, where in the case of the SPCL and its biocomposite the loss was around 40% of the initial 

weight. After 6 months, the biodegradationof the specimens decreased in the following order: 

SPCL/Cork &gt; SPCL &gt; PCL &gt; PCL/Cork &gt; PHBV/Cork &gt; PHBV &gt; PLLA/Cork and PLLA. At this stage a 

considerable increase on the WL for the PHBV and PHBV/Cork of 20% and 30% respectively was 

obtained. The biodegradation process of the injection moulded specimens was higher for the 

biocomposites, where the only exception to this behaviour was the PCL and its biocomposite, probably 

due to a chemical surface affinity between the ester groups present in cork and in the PCL monomer 

structure. The biodegradation process of the specimens is ascribed to (a) the soil composition including 

pH and soil temperature, (b) the hydrolytic degradation that are in contact with the produced materials 

and (c) the erosion process resulting in the release of the cork particles to the soil and the consequent 

higher WL for the biocomposites as compared with the matrices. The literature comprises studies 

showing that biodegradable polymers whether natural or synthetic materials may be susceptible to 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

292 

microbial and/or enzymatic degradation depending wish the repetitive unit, morphology (e.g. 

crystallinity and size of spherulites), hydrophilicity and surface area and presence of additives [30].  

The evolution of the biodegradation is clearly observed in Figure 9.7 were the PCL, SPCL and its 

biocomposites loses the integrity accompanied by change in colour with the biodegradation process 

under soil conditions. In this sense, the thickness variation of the specimens was also affected, see 

Figure 9.6 c) and d). The obtained results are consistent with the WL observations. The PLLA and the 

respective biocomposite do not present reduction of thickness, whereas a small thickness reduction 

was observed for the PHBV and its biocomposite. As expected the higher thickness variation was 

observed for the PCL and SPCL compositions, where after the 60 days, it was not possible to obtain any 

measurements for the blend with starch due to a disintegration of the specimens. In addition, the small 

increase in the thickness variation obtained for the SPCL/Cork after 30 days can be ascribed by the 

swelling of the starch leading to a faster WL followed by the disintegration of the composite structure. In 

spite of the results it is expected for the biocomposites a significantly lower rate of degradation at 

compostable environmental conditions as compared with the neat polymers.

9.3.2 Density 

The density of the injection moulded specimens, was determined in order to evaluate the effect of the 

30 wt.% addition of granulated cork in the bio-based polymers. 

Figure 9.8 shows that the density of the biocomposites containing cork with PLLA and PHBV is lower as 

compared with the neat polymers, in a range of 3.9 % and 1.7 % respectively. This behaviour is ascribed 

to the lower density of cork as compared with the used matrices. Lower density of the cork filled 

composites can result in increased specific mechanical properties (property/density). Moreover, 

features such as: reduced weight, increasing of the amount of renewable material, reduced material 

costs and the possibility to recycle are of considerable importance in the automotive industry. On the 

contrary, the PCL matrix presents a lower density value of 1110 kg.m-3, where the addition of cork 

increased the density in 4.5%. Comparing the effect of adding around 30 wt.% of starch  to the PCL (i.e. 

SPCL blend) and the same weight fraction of cork to the PCL (PCL/Cork composite) was obtained a 

reduction of 5.1%. This result reveals that the use of cork can be an environmental friendly approach to 

reduce the cost and promote aesthetic without compromise significantly the density of the PCL.

9.3.3 Morphology  

Figure 9.9 and Figure 9.10 reveal the surface morphology before and after water and soil degradation 

tests of the biocomposites and the used matrices. The pristine morphology of the neat injection 

moulded polymers exhibited a smooth surface with similar irregularities due to processing. Furthermore, 

the roughness tends to be more pronounced in the biocomposites due to the presence of cork particles 

that are in contact to the surface.

The essays conducted under water just revealed two relevant conditions of biodegradation: (i) the 

micrograph of PHBV after 60 days, presents smoother surface and some micro holes that justifies the 

small higher water uptake as compared with the PHBV/Cork biocomposite ; (ii) the SPCL micrograph 

after the same 60 days of immersion presents some smaller micro holes (indicated with circles in the 

micrograph) probably due to swelling and release of the starch particles from the surface. 

Biodegradation was found to occur primarily at the polymer surface and was more pronounced for the 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

296 

burial soil specimens. SEM micrographs of Figure 9.9 show that after 60 days under soil, PLLA was not 

affected and PHBV starts to loose thickness. For the fully bio-based PHBV composite deep cracks are 

observed, as well as cork exposure at the surface.  

After 180 days the PLLA presents similar surface characteristics, suggesting that the enzymes from soil 

microbes had no significant effects on the degradation of the PLLA specimens. Moreover, it was clearly 

observed for the PHBV/Cork the typical random shape morphology evidencing microbial activity and the 

presence of living organisms such as fungi. After 180 days both surfaces were colonized by hyphae as 

indicated (with arrows) in the PHBV/Cork of Figure 9.9. In polymers, the crystalline part is more difficult 

to degrade than the amorphous regions that have higher mobility of the polymeric chains and, therefore, 

are more accessible to the microorganisms. The presence of lignocellulosic particles distributed in the 

polymer matrix may act as channels and facilitate the microbial attack in natural cork semi-crystalline 

matrix composites. Moreover, soil results as revealed in Figure 9.10, showed that cork presents high 

fungi resistance; however it is known that the structural components of cork (e.g. suberin, lignin and 

cellulose) also present in other plants can be degraded by specific enzymes or bacteria [31-34]. 

In addition, several authors point the idea that lignocellulose-based fibres are the most widely used, as 

biodegradable filler [21, 35, 36], indicating their potential to be used in biodegradable applications. 

Since both constituents are biodegradable, cork combined with bio-based matrices, also can potentially 

origin fully biodegradable composites. For example, the materials based on PCL and SPCL showed that 

the biodegradation process is clear observed after 30 days. In the PCL and SPCL biocompsites after 60 

days, the cork particles are more visible. 

For the SPCL/Cork these elements appear more exposed due to the selective loss of starch from the 

matrix. After this period and for 180 days the disintegration and erosion of the specimens occurs due to 

the high rate of biodegradation and not allowed the SEM observation. The decomposition sequence for 

the biocomposites under soil can be described as follows. The biodegradable polymer at the specimen 

surface first decomposes, followed by exposure of the internal cork granules stacked in the polymer 

matrix. At the same time, the biodegradable polymer in cork-matrix interface decomposes, resulting in 

the formation of interfacial gaps that increases with time exposing considerably more the cork particles. 

Finally, we suggest that substantial decomposition of the biodegradable polymer occurs and on cork 

starts to occur.

9.3.4 Mechanical Properties  

9.3.4.1 Control and water degradation tests 

The tensile properties of the injection moulded biodegradable aliphatic polyesters and the 

biocomposites before biodegradation essays are shown in Figure 9.11 a) for the tensile modulus and in 

Figure 9.11 b) for the maximum tensile strength. Table 9.3 indicates the values and standard deviations 

of the tensile properties including the maximum strain of the materials. Two distinct groups of materials 

could be identified from these data. PLLA and PHBV present considerable higher stiffness and tensile 

strength as compared with the PCL or SPCL specimens.  

 

  

Figure 9.11. Mechanical properties of the neat polymers and the biocomposite materials under tensile 

load.  

 

In opposite sides, PLLA has brittle properties, i.e. high strength and low maximum strain at break, while 

PCL reveals a ductile behaviour with low tensile modulus and higher strain at break. The addition of 

cork to PLLA and PHBV reduces the tensile modulus probably due to the higher elasticity of cork as 

compared with the neat polyesters, contributing to some ductility. The effect of the elasticity of cork 

particles was preferably observed in PHBV and its biocomposite were the reduction of stiffness it was 

followed by an increase of the strain at break. In general, the modulus of a composite material is also 

related with the density of the obtained material. This finding was also observed in the biocomposites, 

where the addition of 30 wt.% of cork increases the tensile modulus  of PCL matrix in 33% and 

maintained the properties of the SPCL matrix as shown in Table 9.3. Moreover, cork promotes similar 

effect as the addition of starch to the PCL matrix. Regarding both PLLA and PHBV, the presence of cork 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

298 

reduces the tensile modulus in 32%. Since cork is a foamed material, the modulus is much lower, that 

the used bio-based polyesters: around 23.9 to 31.7 MPa depending of the direction [6, 7]. Concerning 

the maximum tensile strength, the addition of cork promoted a reduction up to 50.1% for the PLLA; 

28.7% for the PHBV; 28.1% for the PCL and only 13.5% for the SPCL matrix. Based on the mechanical 

properties of the control samples (matrices and its biocomposites), and in previous studies [12, 15, 16] 

using polyolefins as matrices, we observed that the tensile strength on cork-polymer composites is 

dependent preferably on the type of the matrix and on the compatibility between matrix and cork and its 

content, whereas the tensile modulus is influenced by the cork content and processing characteristics.

It should be also highlighted that, when natural cork is under tensile load in radial direction, the fracture 

occurs at stress values of about 1.1 MPa, corresponding to a strain of about 8% [7]. Moreover, the 

reduced strength of cork contributes to an inferior stress transfer between the cork-matrix and 

consequent lower mechanical properties. 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

299 

The tensile properties along the water degradation tests are shown in Figure 9.12, where it was 

observed in some cases a small reduction in the mechanical performance with time. Moreover, starch 

swells high water contents, so it was expected that both strength and stiffness tend to decline with the 

time. However in almost all conditions this was not significant due to the high standard deviations of the 

specimens indicating some variation on the materials surface as supported by the previous 

morphological results.  

  

  

Figure 9.12. Mechanical behaviour of the biocomposites under water during 60 days.  

 

Furthermore, it was found for a period up to 14 days an increase in the tensile modulus for the 

materials containing starch. This occurred probably due to a plasticizing effect promoted by the water 

absorbed by the starch and the presence of some plasticizers in the blend composition. Since the blend 

and its biocomposite were mechanically evaluated after drying we suggest the influence of sorption-

desorption mechanism effect. The drying process of the biocomposites may cause the drying of some 

residual water-filled cellular lumia in cork that causes shrinkage, contributing to some minor variation 

on the composite stiffness.

9.3.4.2 Soil degradation tests 

The loss of the mechanical properties of the injection moulded specimens was more pronounced under 

soil conditions. The relationship between tensile strength and burial period under soil is shown in Figure 

9.13. According to the tensile modulus the bio-based materials gradually loses the mechanical 

properties with the time. Even PLLA presented higher standard deviation in function of time essay that 

may indicate some chemical degradation of the polyester structure.  

  

  

Figure 9.13. Mechanical behaviour of the biocomposites under soil during 180 days.  

 

The mechanical properties were in agreement with the previous weight loss results and morphological 

observations, being the materials most affected the PCL and SPCL based materials. It was also 

observed after 14 days the increase in the tensile modulus for the SPCL materials around 20%. This 

occurred due to the high moisture content absorbed by the starch under soil conditions acting as 

plasticizer and by the presence of plasticizer in the SPCL blend composition. After the 14 days the drop 

on the mechanical properties was quite noticeable, especially in terms of maximum strength. It was 

possible to monitoring the behavior of the SPCL/cork biocomposite up to 60 days, while the SPCL 

blend after the 30 days loses the specimen integrity to be tested under tensile load. Furthermore, the 

mechanical response of the developed materials it confirmed that granulated cork decreases the 

biodegradation rate. This behaviour was also observed for the PCL matrix and its biocomposite as 

indicated in Figure 9.13 d), being evident the loss in the tensile strenght between 30 and 60 days, 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

301 

where PCL starts to lose more properties due to biodegradation. This mechanical failure is consistent 

with the higher porosity of PCL surface as compared with the PCL/Cork observed by SEM micrographs 

after the 30 days of burial soil test, see Figure 9.10. 

9.3.5 Thermal analysis  

The influence of cork on the thermal stability of the injection moulded biocomposites and the stability of 

the polyesters was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) essays. TGA results and the respective 

derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) are shown in Figure 9.14.  

 

  

  
 

Figure 9.14. Thermogravimetric curves of the neat polymers and the biocomposites. 

 

The initial degradation temperature (Tonset), maximum peaks obtained in the DTG curve and the ash 

content are shown in Table 9.4. The thermal degradation process of PLLA, PHBV and its biocomposites 

occurs in only one weight loss step, while for the PCL, SPCL and its biocomposites a multi-step 

degradation process was observed. In the presence of cork the curves are shifted to lower temperatures 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological 

and thermal properties 

 

302 

indicating a small decreasing in thermal stability of biocomposite. The only exception was with PHBV, 

where the addition of cork improved the initial thermal stability. This small increase on the thermal 

stability occurred despite of cork presented the lower initial degradation temperature of 246.3ºC as 

compared with the used polyester matrices (see Table 9.4). Some recent studies evidenced that the 

addition of nano-clay and natural fibres reduced or maintain, respectively, the thermal stability of PHBV 

[37, 38]. However in the present study cork promoted a slight and positive increase in 5.5% to the initial 

degradation temperature.

Furthermore, during the injection moulding process it was observed that PHBV presents a slow 

crystallization rate, inducing some warping in the samples that was ameliorated by the addition of cork. 

The TGA curves and Table 9.4 showed that thermal decomposition of SPCL started at 309?°C with the 

decomposition of starch and continued at 411?°C with the degradation of the PCL fraction. Comparing 

the effect of cork and starch on the PCL matrix, Figure 9.14 c) shows that cork revealed higher thermal 

stability than starch. This result was also confirmed by the DTG curve of

and thermal properties 

 

303 

  

  
 

Figure 9.14.  d) with the intense peaks appearing at 318.4 ºC for SPCL and 323.6 ºC for PCL/Cork. 

 

The TGA curves and the results of Table 9.4 indicated that thermal degradation of biocomposites is a 

combined phenomenon of thermal degradation of each of the components; i.e., the selected matrix and 

the granulated cork. The TGA findings also point that cork was the last material to be degraded 

promoting a slower thermal degradation to the biocomposites at higher temperatures resulting in a 

lower weight loss rate and higher ash content, from 6.3% up to 9.3%.  

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also provides relevant information about the thermal and 

structural characteristics of materials. In this study, DSC was performed to understand the effect of the 

cork on the nucleation and crystallinity of the bio-based polyesters, using for that the second heating 

scan. Thus, we are erasing any previous thermal story through the first heating cycle. The onset values 

of phase transition temperatures (crystallization temperature Tc, cold crystallization temperature Tcc and 

melting temperature Tm), glass transition temperature Tg  at the mid-point of heat capacity changes and 

enthalpies (?Hcc, cold crystallization enthalpy, ?Hm, melting enthalpy and ?Hc, crystallization enthalpy) 



Chapter 9 – Cork-polymer biocomposites: assessment of biodegradability, mechanical, morphological

recorded by DSC of the injection moulded materials are summarized in Table 9.5. The thermograms 

are shown in Figure 9.15.  

 

  

Figure 9.15. DSC termograms of the biobased composites with cork at 20 ºC min-1 showing: a) the 

second heating and b) the first cooling. 

 

In this study, we observed that the PLLA, PHBV and the respective biocomposites (Figure 9.15 a) 

displayed on heating three main transitions: glass transition, a cold crystallization exothermic followed 

by a melting endothermic event. We also observed the influence of cork on the Tg of the PLLA and 

PHBV polyesters. It has been found that Tg was slightly affected by the composition, with a small 

increase with the cork content, from 57.3 to 58.4 ºC and -0.6 to 4.6 ºC (see Table 9.5), suggesting 

confinement of the mobile amorphous phase. This finding, previously observed in the PHB using a 

different type of natural fibres [39], was explained by an intermolecular interaction between carbonyl (-

C=O) groups of the PHBV and hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the natural fibre that decreases the molecular 

flexibility of the polymer chains involved in the glass transition. 

The PLLA present an amorphous structure that might be related with the DSC cooling rate of 20 

ºC/min that could prevent crystallization of the material. In the case of the PLLA thermogram, the cold 

crystallization temperature peak was shifted to lower temperature with the addition of cork. This agrees 

with the finds in the literature [40] that the presence of some lignocellulosic materials such as wood 

can promote the initial cold crystallization temperature of the PLLA matrix. Moreover, the thermograms 

of the PLLA and PHBV show a single melting temperature peak event at 160.5 ºC and 170 ºC 

respectively.

For the biocomposites PLLA/Cork and PHBV/Cork the maximum melting peak occurs at a high 

temperature being 166.4 ºC and 171.2 ºC respectively. Moreover, for the biocomposites it was 

observed a second melting peak with smaller intensity and lower temperature. In different 

lignocellulosic biocomposites, the presence of two melting peaks almost completely overlapped were 

attributed to the presence and reorganization of a different type of crystals with higher order degree and 

stability [41]. Cork interferes in the crystal morphology of PLLA and PHBV during the melting as a result 

the nucleation growth of the bio-based polyester becomes more homogenised in presence of cork 

particles. The onset temperature of the crystallisation during the cooling tends to show a slight but not 

significant increase with the cork content in the semi-crystalline PCL and SPCL. In the PLC the Tc was 

found to occur at 29.6 ºC and for PLC/Cork at 29.1ºC, while the SPCL and SPCL/Cork showed it at 

27.5 and 28.1ºC, respectively. We observed that the heating of crystallization and the heating of 

melting of the bio-based matrices in all the biocomposites increased with the addition of cork indicating

an improvement in the degree of crystallinity (?c) as shown in Table 9.5. These findings suggest that 

cork may have the ability to modify the crystallisation by increasing the number of nucleating sites in 

the bio-based polyesters and enhancing its crystallinity degree. Moreover, the addition of starch to the 

PCL reduced the crystallinity in 5.8%, thus contributing to enhancing the biodegradation. 

9.4 Conclusions 

This study dealt with the effect of water immersion and soil degradation on the weight changes, tensile 

and morphological  properties of biodegradable polyester biomposites containing granulated cork (30 

wt.%) processed by extrusion followed by injection moulding. This environmental friendly approach of 

using a renewable material such as natural cork, promoted a reduction of PLLA and PHBV density 

resulting in lightweight biocomposites. All materials revealed low water absorption, being the higher 

values correspond to the biocomposites containing cork and preferably in the presence of the starch. 

Thermal properties by DSC have confirmed the positive effect on the use of cork that increases the 

crystallinity degree for all the used bio-based polyester matrices. Biodegradation of the specimens under 

burial soil during 6 months was significantly more severe than under static water conditions, as 

monitored from the loss of tensile modulus and maximum strength. As expected the use of starch 

accelerates the biodegradation rate also confirmed by morphological observation. Moreover, this study 

allowed comparing the contribution of cork and starch to the PCL polymer (i.e. SPCL and PCL/Cork). 

Cork contributes with higher hydrolytic and dimensional stability than starch. Both materials improved 

considerably the stiffness; however cork induces weight reduction and is less sensitive to moisture. TGA 

showed that cork presents higher thermal stability than starch. Regarding the degree of crystallinity, the 

DSC analysis revealed an opposite effect for both fillers were starch contributed to an increase of the 

amorphous phase supporting the higher biodegradation. This findings could demonstrate the benefits of 

combine cork with bio-based matrices that can origin fully biodegradable eco-friendly composites. 

Besides the cost reduction of bio-based matrices by adding cork, it is possible to provide aesthetic 

characteristics, or reduce matrix weight or even increase stiffness depending of the used biodegradable 

polymer. Cork biocomposites are good candidates for the production of sustainable products promoting 

added-value to cork biomass for a wide range of applications.

 General conclusions and future perspectives 

The investment in academic research and innovation, in Portugal, is far from being exploited by national 

companies, as a tool for sustainable growth. This thesis is part of the result of a straightforward 

collaboration with the industry to develop knowledge and new applications based on cork-polymer 

composite (CPC) materials. The main objectives of this thesis were:  

 

? to combine the engineering properties of the commodity thermoplastic matrices with the unique 

properties of cork trough melt based technologies and to create cork-based composites; 

? to promote an added-value to different cork by-products obtained from finishing industrial 

operations and from end life products,  

? to get the knowledge of compounding the lignocellulosic materials (i.e. cork and/or natural 

fibres) with thermoplastics, allowing high volumes of cork in the final material;  

? to reinforce the developed cork-polymer composites (CPC) using the potential of coupling 

agents based on maleic anhydride with good distribution and dispersion of the particles in the 

polymer matrix; 

? to isolate the major chemical components of cork powder (i.e. suberin and lignin) and use them 

as a coupling agent to promote the interfacial adhesion;  

? to improve the mechanical response of CPC using natural fibres, creating novel hybrid 

composite systems; 

? to engineering a class of cork biocomposites more sustainable with acceptable in-service 

performance and tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. 

 

Figure 10.1 shows an overall view of the integrating work performed with the CPC materials and their 

potential applications. The general conclusions of the research work produced in the present thesis, 

which extends from Chapter 3 to 9, are summarized as follows:

areas of application. 

 

Chapter 3 creates a viable and profitable alternative to storage or burn of cork by-products, such as 

powders from grinding, sanding, external industrial operations and from corkstyle or floating products. 

The moisture content of these by-products ranged from 5.4 up to 18.0%, being the lower values of 

moisture referents to the cork sanding/external powder. The moisture content on the natural 

component is an important issue during the compounding process. In this sense, a correct dry and 

stabilization of these components is fundamental, in order to avoid reduction of properties on the final 

product.  

In this study, different classes of cork powders were combined with high-density polyethylene, recycled 

polymer and polypropylene by pultrusion to created CPC pellets of cork-polymer (50-50 wt.%) followed 

by compression moulding to produce boards. The reduced density of the cork-based composite pellets, 

shows the potential of the pultrusion technology to develop pultruded products taking the advantages of 

the cork low density.  

Thermal analysis by DSC of the crystallization process, revealed the nucleating ability of cork, promoting 

an increase on the composite crystalinity. Microscopic optical observation confirmed a preferential

increasing of the spherulites around the cork particle in the thermoplastic matrix. Contrary to other 

lignocellulosic materials such as natural fibres, cork did not present evidence of the transcrystallinity 

phenomena.  

The mechanical performance showed that, in a number of properties polypropylene is superior 

compared to polyethylene, since it is lighter, stronger and stiffer. The use of cork powder in 50 wt.% 

reduces the mechanical properties of the polyolefin matrix. The use of polyolefins as matrices in the 

production of lignocellulosic composites can be limited by the lower affinity between the components. 

The addition of 2 wt.% of functionalized polymers containing maleic anhydride (MA) groups during 

compounding (i.e.PE-g-MA or PP-g-MA) showed to be an effective method to improve interfacial bonding, 

even when using different cork qualities. The tensile properties of the different CPC were considerably 

enhanced in terms of tensile modulus and tensile strength.  

The work shows that the use of recycled polymers combined with cork by-products from the cork 

industrial process revealed to be an interesting approach that contributes to higher sustainable products. 

However, the diminishing of the mechanical properties must be considered for the envisaged 

application.  

CPC produced by pultrusion clearly show that cork powders and polyolefin’s can be successfully used 

to produce CPC with high cork content. In order to obtain cork based composite materials with 

enhanced mechanical properties, reinforcement strategies must be taken in consideration. 

Another possibility to be explored the cork by-products, is to produce CPC on a flat-press like the 

traditional wood-based panels. The advantage of this technology is that only a relatively low pressure 

level is required as compared to the extrusion and injection moulding. 

 

Along with the previous Chapter 3, the work of Chapter 4 potentiates the use of cork-polymer composite 

materials for building applications such as underlay material in flooring systems and we compared their 

characteristics with the well-established high-density fibreboard (HDF) and medium-density fibreboards 

(MDF) materials. On HDF and preferentially on MDF, moisture problem arises due to wood being a 

naturally hygroscopic material. In service these products can be exposed to a range of environmental 

conditions. The relationship between moisture content and strength properties is very important, if 

panel products are to be used as structural materials subjected to atmospheric moisture conditions as 

is the case of flooring systems. The CPC obtained by pultrusion followed by compression moulding can 

take advantage, since they show much lower water absorption and lower thickness swelling variation. 

They are also free from formaldehyde emission when compared to the HDF and MDF.  



Chapter 10 – General conclusions and future perspectives

The morphological studies of cork based composites showed good dispersion and distribution or the 

cork along the matrix. Thus, the cork based composites presented reduced warping characteristics 

indicating good dimensional stability. Regarding the fibreboards, the fibrous morphology explains the 

superior mechanical properties obtained as compared with the CPC (50-50) wt.%. The addition of 

50wt.% of cork improves the flexural modulus of the thermoplastic matrix, while considerably reduces 

the flexural strength.  

The cork fraction represents around 86% in volume of the composite material. This fact supports the 

CPC good acoustic behaviour when compared with the commercial fibre boards. The CPC materials 

present similar acoustic performance to the fibreboards, however at high frequencies the behaviour of 

the CPC is superior, probably due to the cellular structure of cork.  

Cork presents the advantage to act as fire retardant in the polyolefins. According to the fire resistance 

tests and to the stands, the developed cork based composites presents the same “fire class” as 

compared with the HDF and MDF. Thus, CPC materials proved to be good candidates to be used as 

underlay materials on floor applications. More information related with the CPC process is provided in 

the Appendix 1 (patent WO2009072914 (A1)) of this thesis. Figure 10.2 shows a prototype of a 

laminated flooring system using CPC (50-50) wt.% as underlay.

Further work on the optimization of the compression moulding conditions of the CPC using a design of 

experiments (DOE) can be used to obtain the correct temperature, applied pressure and amount of 

coupling agent that are the principal parameters to optimize in order to obtain the appropriated 

mechanical response for the selected application. Furthermore, finishing operations in the prototypes, 

such as machining, lamination, cutting or gluing the CPC with other layer should be addressed.  

 

As compared with other lignocellulosic composites, the final properties of the CPC are highly dependent 

on the processing conditions. Thus, the final specifications of a CPC material can be tailored for a 

specific application by varying the compounding process, amount and cork particle size, chemical or 

surface treatment and type and amount of coupling agent.  

In Chapter 5, it was studied the polypropylene-cork (PP/cork) composites produced using co-rotating 

twin-screw extruder followed by injection or compression moulding process.  During the extrusion 

process it was avoided an aggressive mixing configuration in the screw profile with several mixing zones, 

since this fact may increase the density of the cork particles during the compounding.  

The effect of cork on the melt viscosity of the polypropylene was accessed by melt flow index (MFI). The 

addition of cork to the thermoplastic reduces considerably the viscosity and consequently the MFI. The 

addition of the coupling agent PP-g-MA to the composite promotes an opposite effect and improves the 

mixability.  

The injection moulded PP/Cork composites exhibit low water uptake and the increase of cork fraction, 

increases the water absorption up to 2.3 wt.% after a period of 1344 hours. It seems that the 

hydrophobic nature of cork may take some advantage over other natural fibre materials such as wood. 

It was possible to reduce the water uptake by: (a) increasing the particle size of the cork and (b) by the 

addition of coupling agent that significantly reduces the water absorption of the CPC.  

The morphology evaluated by optical microscopy revealed good dispersion and distribution of cork and 

a high good cohesion between cork and the polyolefin, even in the absence of coupling agent. No voids 

were observed in the different conditions. 

The composites density is higher than the neat polypropylene and increases with the higher 

incorporation of cork. The use of coupling agent induces a slight decrease on the density due to a better 

dispersion of the cork along the matrix. 

The mechanical properties under tensile load shows a small reinforcement of around 10% in the 

stiffness provided by incorporating cork at a 5 wt.%. For higher cork content (i.e. up to 30wt.%) the 



Chapter 10 – General conclusions and future perspectives 

318 

tensile properties are reduced. The ability to transfer the stress from the thermoplastic matrix to the 

cork or reinforcement will depend essentially of the cork-polymer interactions that can be reduced due 

to the incompatibility between lignocellulosic materials and polymeric matrix. To overcome these 

limitations it is necessary to promote polymer modification, with the use of polar functional groups, 

such as maleic anhydride. The mechanical properties were enhanced by the addition of polypropylene 

graft maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) in terms of tensile strength and maximum strain. A good balance of 

the mechanical properties was achieved by using 2 wt.% upt to 4 wt.% of coupling agent. The use of the 

stearic acid in 2 wt.% does not modify significantly the tensile properties, however a slight increase on 

the maximum strain was noticed. The stearic acid acts as plasticizer in the cork-polymer system. 

One of the main concerns on the use of lignocellulosic in composites is their susceptibility to moisture 

absorption and the consequent effect on the physical and mechanical properties. The tensile properties 

of PP/cork composites were compared before and after water immersion tests and revealed to be very 

similar, which is a clear advantage of the CPC materials. 

The use of DSC on the thermal properties of the PP/Cork composites revealed higher crystallization 

temperatures than neat PP, and their thermal stability was similar to that of PP. The results are 

according to the achieved in the cork composites obtained by pultrusion, where in this study cork and 

PP-g-MA acted as nucleating agents during the crystallization process. Cork promoted a small increase 

on the composite crystallinity up to 30 wt.%, however the enhancement was also dependent on the 

degree of compatibility between the PP and the cork. 

Polypropylene is more susceptible to oxidation when compared with polyethylene due to its chemical 

structure, requiring higher amounts of antioxidants and stabilizers. Thermal analysis by DSC at 200ºC 

revealed that the addition of cork promotes an antioxidant effect to the polypropylene increasing the 

time to oxidation. Reducing the cork particle size and consequently increasing the surface area of the 

particles contributes to a higher thermal-oxidative protection. By using 30 wt.% of cork powder the 

oxidation was delayed almost 13 times as compared with the neat PP. 

Cork is well known to be a good thermal and acoustic insulator material. Unexpectedly, the thermal 

conductivity of the PP/cork composites increases with the increase of the cork weight fraction. This 

effect is related with the high pressures applied in the melt based processes increasing the density of 

the final cork composite and consequently reducing the thermal resistance. The higher capacity for heat 

transfer on the developed cork composites may result in new potential applications in electric and 

electronic cover systems.

The maximum incorporation of cork on the polypropylene matrix was 70 wt.% that represents 93% in 

volume of the cork based composite. This was achieved using cork powder compounded in a counter-

rotating twin-screw extruder without die.  

Figure 10.3 shows the potential to obtain 3D cork-based composite structures obtained by the injection 

moulding process, where cork cannot compete alone. 

 

 

Figure 10.3. CPC materials (50-50) wt.% obtained by injection moulding. 

 

As future work, a better understanding of the rheological behaviour of the developed CPC should be 

addressed to improve the compounding process. The production of cork-polymer composites materials 

in a single melt based technology step such as extrusion of a profile must be considered to obtain the 

final product. In the development of cork-based composite flooring application, the incorporation of 

substances with the capability to promote electromechanical properties, motion sensors embedded in 

the composite, or the improvement of conductivity for heating flooring systems will be of high relevance. 

The developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and insulation systems, hardware for 

electronics, outdoor systems, among other sustainable applications. 

 

The need to improve the interface between cork-polymer was previously achieved by the use of coupling 

agent and it is well known that compatibility between lignocellulosic materials and the polymer matrix 

plays an important role in determining the properties of a composite. Lignocellulosic materials such as 



Chapter 10 – General conclusions and future perspectives 

320 

cork, which have polar hydroxyl groups on the surface, have difficulty to create bonded interfaces with a 

nonpolar polymer matrix such as polyethylene and polypropylene, limiting their use.  

In Chapter 6, the used methods from the literature allowed isolating the major fractions from cork (i.e. 

suberin and lignin) that were confirmed by chemical FTIR analysis. However, it is also known that the 

structure of the major components of cork has not been fully established.  

TGA analysis confirmed that suberin and lignin fractions, isolated from cork, present sufficient thermal 

stability to be applied in melt based technologies such as extrusion processes.  

The research methodology of using a reactive extrusion (REX) process as a reactor, allowed using 

suberin and lignin as environmentally friendly coupling agents to improve interfacial adhesion of cork-

polymer system. REX has the capability of functionalizing, preparing the composite and producing CPC 

pellets in a single step. 

The mechanical tensile tests indicate that the suberin and lignin can be used as bio-based coupling 

agents in the presence of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to produce functionalized CPC with superior 

mechanical properties. Suberin acts as a plasticizer, improving the cork dispersion and reduces the 

composite´s stiffness, providing additional flexibility and formability to the composite. Lignin shows to 

act as a coupling agent and the use of 2wt% of lignin improved both maximum tensile strength and 

modulus in 48% and 39% respectively. Increasing the amount of lignin to 4 wt.% reduces the 

mechanical performance of the composites. The use of 2wt% of PE-g-MA increases 34% the maximum 

strength, 30% the tensile modulus and reduces the maximum strain. Coupling agents in CPCs play a 

very important role in improving compatibility and adhesion between the polar cork material and the 

non-polar polymer matrices. 

All the developed functionalized CPC present low water uptake and thickness swelling variation, 

displaying similar behavior as compared with coupling agents based on maleic anhydride.  

Thermal properties by TGA and DSC reveal that lignin can act as a thermal protective agent and suberin 

act as an antioxidant agent on the composites, while the PE-g-MA act as both.  

Further work should be conducted to deeper understanding this complex system and which of the 

chemical groups are responsible to contribute to this enhancement on the mechanical properties.  

 

The research methodology present in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8, allowed the production of hybrid cork 

based composite materials reinforced with short natural fibres (i.e. coconut and sisal fibre). In both 

chapters, hybrid cork based composites using high density polyethylene as matrix were obtained by 

twin-screw extrusion followed by compression moulding and presented a cork ratio of 40 wt.% up to 50

wt.%. This reinforcement strategy shows that the lignocellulosic–matrix interaction was improved either 

via the use of natural fiber, or by modifying the fibre surface, or via the matrix, by employing coupling 

agents resulting in composites with considerably higher mechanical properties. 

The physical modification of the sisal fibres by using alkali treatment (or mercerization) was confirmed 

by FTIR, showing potential to dissolve some lignin and wax from the fibre surface promoting a cleaner 

fibre surface to interact with the matrix.   

XRD results reflect the influence of the alkali treatment and show a small increase on the crystallinity, 

confirming the surface modification of the sisal fibres.  

In terms of uniaxial tensile strength the mean values of maximum strength of the unmodified sisal is 

higher compared with the modified fibres. This may be related with the alkali chemical treatment that 

promoted the reduction of the fibre thickness and some removing of the hemicelluloses and lignin. 

The fracture morphology of the hybrid cork based composites reinforced with the short natural fibres by 

SEM was in accordance with the mechanical results, showing the improved effect of fibre-matrix 

adhesion in the presence of coupling agent. 

The improvement on the mechanical properties under tensile load of the hybrid composites with 

coconut and sisal was effective in the presence of coupling agent based on maleic anhydride (MA), 

revealing higher stiffness, strength and elongation at break. 

The flexural properties using alkali treated sisal fibres with coupling agent presents an increase of 33% 

in flexural modulus and an increase of 98% in the strength when compared with unreinforced cork 

composites. This alkali treatment leads to higher mechanical properties of the composites since 

cellulose has higher mechanical properties compared to lignin and also increases specific surface area 

leading to better interaction with the matrix. 

Comparing the properties of the hybrid CPC with the polyethylene matrix, it was shown that a 

reinforcement of the matrix in terms of stiffness and strength at flexural load is achieved mainly after 

the sisal fibres alkali treatment. In terms of tensile strength, they present similar stiffness and lower 

strength when compared to the polyethylene matrix. Higher mechanical properties where obtain using 

wood fibre with coupling agent based on maleic anhydride and the additional results related with this 

invention are provided in the Appendix (patent WO2011014085 (A3)) of this thesis. 

The low values of coefficient of variation of the mechanical properties of the hybrid CPC solutions, 

supports the homogeneous properties in terms of cork and fibre distribution on the composites. 

The Ashby diagram allowed to identify the best developed CPC composite formulation and to visualize 

the improvement over the CPC without fibre reinforcement.

Weibull diagram was used to reliably identify the composites safety limits. The tensile strength of the 

hybrid reinforced CPC was found to be in agreement with the Weibull cumulative distribution, which can 

be used to accurately predict the mechanical properties of the CPC composites. 

This reinforcement strategy shows the potential to obtain CPC with superior mechanical performance. 

This knowledge can be applied in the flooring system to reinforce complex geometries or to improve 

resistance, to machining or to apply the CPC as structural materials. 

Furthermore, different natural fibres should be tested and the cork surface modification attempted to 

promote cork-matrix compatibility. A deeper understanding of the complex nature of cork and natural 

fibers and their surface properties is still needed in order to optimize natural fiber surface modification 

processes. Using materials like natural based composites that reduce construction waste and increase 

energy efficiency would provide a solution to immediate infrastructure needs while promoting the 

concept of sustainability. 

 

Chapter 9 shows injection moulded biocomposites combining different biodegradable aliphatic 

polyesters (i.e. PLLA, PHBV, PCL and SPCL) with cork 30 wt.%. Cork combined with bio-based matrices 

can originate fully biodegradable composites for sustainable applications. The cork biocomposites were 

engineered to satisfy acceptable stiffness, strength, and in-service durability while maintaining the 

tendency for rapid out-of-service biodegradation. A possible application is shown in Figure 10.4 as 

biodegradable caps for wine bottles.

pellets and b) polystyrene (PS) cap and developed biodegradable solutions with cork. 

The lower density obtained in the biocomposites is one potential advantage to create lightweight 

sustainable materials in the automotive area with improved insulation properties.

The injection moulded materials revealed low water absorption, being the higher values corresponding 

to the biocomposites containing cork and preferably in the presence of the starch. 

Cork combined with PLLA and PHBV presents adequate mechanical properties, high dimensional 

stability under water and reduced density resulting in lightweight biocomposites.  

SEM micrographs show that biodegradation was found to occur primarily at the polymer surface and 

was more pronounced for the materials under burial soil. 

Biodegradation of the specimens under burial soil was significantly more severe than under static water 

with the loss of tensile modulus and maximum strength. After 6 months, the biodegradation of the 

biocomposites decreased in the following order: SPCL/Cork &gt; SPCL &gt; PCL &gt; PCL/Cork &gt; PHBV/Cork &gt; 

PHBV &gt; PLLA/Cork and PLLA. During soil burial tests, PCL, SPCL and its biocomposites revealed a 

sustained weight loss and diminishing on the mechanical properties in terms of tensile modulus and 

maximum strength with the time. On contrary, the durability of some biocomposites such as PLLA/Cork 

and PHBV/Cork, that shows lower rate of degradation, results in products that require less 

maintenance and a much longer life. 

The thermal characterization by DSC has evidenced that the presence of cork increases the crystallinity 

degree for all the used bio-based polyester matrices. The presence of starch decreases considerably the 

biocomposite crystallinity contributing to an increase of the amorphous phase supporting the higher 

biodegradation rate. The melting temperature of the cork biocomposites is higher as compared with the 

aliphatic polyesters due to the thermal resistance of cork material. This behaviour should be taken into 

account during the melt based process.   

TGA analysis confirmed that the biocomposites presented a multi-degradation process, where cork only 

was able to improve the thermal stability for the PHBV matrix. In the other polyester matrices the 

presence of cork reduces the initial degradation temperature, being the lower value of 266.9ºC for the 

PCL/Cork biocomposite. Moreover, it was confirmed that cork starts to degrade at 246.3ºC, however it 

contributes to a slower degradation rate of the biocomposites higher temperatures. TGA showed that 

cork presents higher thermal stability than starch. 

The results show the benefits of combining cork with bio-based matrices that can originate fully 

biodegradable eco-friendly composites. Besides the cost reduction of bio-based matrices by adding cork, 

it was possible to increase the composite stiffness depending of the used biodegradable polymer, 

reduce the matrix weight and improve aesthetic characteristics. 

 



Chapter 10 – General conclusions and future perspectives 

324 

Future work on innovative technologies and process solutions should be intensively researched to get 

the high strength engineering composites which are related to their new applications area. Strategies to 

reduce composite density, such as (i) the use of cork and (ii) the use of foaming agents in the matrix, 

without considerable loss on the mechanical performance, must be considered. Based on the literature 

review of this thesis, there is a great potential on nano structures obtained from lignocellulosic materials 

that present potential to reinforce these biocomposites, potentiating a new class of cork 

bionanocomposite materials. 

 

As a final remark, we can say that this thesis allowed developing different classes of cork-polymer 

composite pellets for different areas of application. In areas where environmental concern, aesthetics, 

reduced plastic touch and construction capability are required, the composites containing forest based 

materials such as cork constitute a viable and interesting possibility. Regarding these properties, the 

applications for the developed cork composites may include furniture, flooring and insulation systems, 

hardware for electronics, toys for children, outdoor systems, automotive interior applications, among 

other sustainable applications.
