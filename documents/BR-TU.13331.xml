Resumo 

 
 A cortiça tem propriedades mecânicas e físicas únicas, em particular uma 

elevada capacidade de absorção de energia, elevada fricção, baixa condução 

acústica e térmica, elevada hidrofobicidade e baixa densidade. Estas propriedades 

estão relacionadas tanto com a sua composição química como com a sua 

microestrutura. Neste estudo, inspirado por estas características e morfologia 

únicas da cortiça, desenvolveram-se novas espumas de origem renovável com 

elevado desempenho. Adicionalmente, devido à necessidade premente em 

desenvolver concomitantemente materiais sustentáveis e processos verdes, estas 

novas bio-espumas foram preparadas seguindo abordagens amigas do ambiente. 

Em concreto, elas foram preparadas por polimerização em emulsão de Pickering 

de óleo de soja epoxidado acrilatado (AESO) usando celulose bacteriana acetilada 

como estabilizante da emulsão. Adicionalmente, seguindo mais de perto a 

microstrura e composição da cortiça, prepararam-se espumas sustentáveis 

contendo concentrações elevadas de celulose e foram dados os primeiros passos 

no sentido destas espumas incorporarem compostos semelhantes à lenhina. 

As diversas emulsões preparadas bem como as espumas resultantes foram 

caracterizadas detalhadamente através de várias técnicas, tais como SEM, 

microscopia óptica, TGA, DMTA, FTIR, estre outras. Verificou-se que a 

composição ótima da emulsão água-em-AESO foi estabilizada com 70% de água 

o que corresponde a uma emulsão do tipo ‘High Internal Phase Emulsion’ (HIPE). 

A microestrutura celular das novas bio-espumas foi confirmada por SEM, 

verificado que dependendo da composição inicial das emulsões (rácio água/óleo) 

pode-se controlar as dimensões e densidades dos poros e assim ajustar a 

porosidade à da cortiça. Estudou-se o comportamento térmico das espumas via 

TGA, podendo-se concluir que elas têm um comportamento semelhante à cortiça. 

É ainda de realçar que em termos de análise por DMTA, verificou-se que a 

temperatura de transição vítrea varia entre 30-60 oC.

Abstract 

 
 

 Cork material have a very unique set of mechanical and physical 

properties especially high energy absorption, high friction, low acoustic and 

thermal conduction, good hydrophobicity and low density. These properties are 

strongly related to the chemical composition of cork, as well as its honeycomb-

like microstructure. In this study, inspired by these unique features, we have 

developed novel high performance bio-foams. Additionally, due to the urgent need 

to develop concomitantly sustainable materials and green processes, these novel 

foams were prepared using environment friendly approaches. In this study novel 

bio-foams mimicking cork were prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerisation 

of acrylated epoxydised soybean oil (AESO) using acetylated bacterial cellulose 

(Ac-BC) as an emulsion stabiliser.  

Following more closely cork structure and chemical composition, additional 

sustainable foams composed of higher concentrations of Ac-BC, were prepared. 

Also, the first steps towards the incorporation of lignin-like compounds in these 

foams were done. 

Both emulsions and ensuing foams were exhaustively characterised by means of 

several techniques, viz., SEM, optical microscopy, TGA, DMTA, FTIR, among 

others. The stabilisation of a 70% high internal phase water-in-AESO emulsion 

(HIPE) was verified. The cellular structure of the novel foams was confirmed by 

SEM analysis. It was found that depending on the ratio between water/oil we 

could tune pore dimensions and density, and hence to approach more closely cork 

microstructure. 

Moreover, the new foams thermal properties, especially in terms of thermal 

stability, were found to be close to cork behaviour. Furthermore, the mechanical 

properties of the foams were studied by DMTA, and the glass transition value was 

found to be between 30-60 oC.

Context 

 

 High performance materials combining multiple interesting properties are being 

more and more investigated. The main objective of this study was to prepare novel high 

performance bio-foam materials inspired by cork material, and determinate how changing 

the reaction condition and /or composition tunes the ensuing foam properties. 

 Moreover, in the past decades the increase of the global environmental awareness 

associated with sustainability and the crude oil depletion, gave rise to an increase interest 

in renewable-based materials and eco-friendly processes. In this context, the other aim of 

this study was to define an environmental friendly process to produce these new bio-based 

materials that will have the advantage of having a controlled homogeneity and cell size. 

  This thesis is divided in three main chapters focusing on describing cork and the 

processes chosen to produce the novel bio-foams, the experiments carried out, and finally 

the results are discussed in the last chapter. 

 In order to obtain a high performance material, we aim to mimic the chemical 

composition and structure of cork. The first section of Chapter 1 (1.1 What is cork?) 

describes cork material structure, composition and its properties. The second section of 

Chapter 1 (1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foam) describes the methodology used to 

produce the novel composite material. Specifically the Pickering emulsion polymerisation 

approach is described and different parameters and elements needed to prepare an 

emulsion are highlighted. Chapter 2 (2. Experimental part) details the materials and 

reagents, the methodologies and characterisation techniques used along this thesis. 

 The last chapter (3. Results and discussion) presents the characterisation techniques 

that were performed at each steps of the herein presented study, namely SEM, TGA and 

DMTA, and also describes how the processes were optimised in order to obtain a foam 

closer to cork’s microstructure and composition. This same chapter include also the 

discussion of these results and ensuing foams.

1. Introduction 

 The outer bark of cork oak tree is a natural closed cell material, usually simply 

called cork. Cork has interesting properties, like for example its hydrophobicity, thermal 

and acoustic isolation properties, energy-absorbing capacity, among others1. These 

characteristics make this natural occurring material suitable for a wide range of fields, 

including the traditional use in cork stoppers, but also in several modern technologic 

applications1. Among the latter, for example, engineers and researchers have already 

started to replace asbestos, in thermal isolation applications, by cork as an environmental 

friendly alternative and as a low specific gravity filler in the thermal isolation of space 

vehicles 2. Cork unique properties, together with its high-tech applications, makes it a very 

inspiring material, this study aims precisely to mimic cork microstructure and chemical 

composition in order to obtain innovative high performance composite materials. 

 In the first section (1.1. What is cork?), natural cork is described in terms of natural 

occurrence, and main applications through time, chemical composition, mechanical and 

physical properties. We will see that cork’s uncommon properties are due to multiple 

factors, including its hexagonal-based polyhedral microstructure. Moreover, its chemical 

composition is the key to its structure stability and plays a primordial role in its physical 

properties1. 

 Inspired by cork composition and structure, Pickering emulsion polymerisation is 

the process chosen in the herein presented study to create our new high performance bio-

foams. The second section (1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foam) describes the 

physical and chemical principles involved with this type of emulsion.

1.1 What is cork? 

 Cork is the outer layer of the bark of cork oak tree (Quercu suber L.), thus being the 

tree external protective layer, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Its growth is a reaction of the tree 

to the death of the initial phellogen, which can occur by natural accidents (fire, hot or dry 

periods, bacterial or environmental impact) or by removal of the cork layer (for 

harvesting). 

 

 The next paragraphs are dedicated to describe cork material; first a brief overview 

about cork’s growth (1.1.1 Formation and growth), afterward to give its history, production 

and applications (1.1.2 History, production and applications of cork), its structure and 

chemical composition (1.1.3 Structure of cork tissue and 1.1.4 Chemical composition), and 

finally, to describe its mechanical and physical properties.

1.1.1 Formation and growth 

The western Mediterranean basin is the cradle of cork oak forests due to cork oak 

environmental specific needs. Portugal is the main cork producer with 49.6% of the world 

annual production 3 (Figure 1.2).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Cork industry is considered as environmentally friendly 4,5, for example 83% of the 

cork oak trees harvested in Portugal are of pure stand (about the same ratio in Spain). 

Furthermore, these trees can live about 200 years and are not cut down to harvest the cork. 

It takes approximately 10 years for the cork layer to grow back thick enough, about 4 mm 

per year, to be harvest again. We can see in Figure 1.3 a picture of the harvesting of cork 

oak’s bark.

Ano 2015 6/59 

 Structure of cork oak’s tree can be divided in two parts: the inner part (the xylem) 

and the outer part (the bark). Cork layers grow as the external part of the bark, as what is 

usually called periderm. Contrary to other tree species, the outer protective layer of cork 

oak has specific properties that make it possible to produce cork in a sustainable way.  

 When the outer wall is damaged, for example after harvesting, the first phellogen 

(called traumatic periderm) forms very quickly during the first year after the damage. 

Under this first protecting layer, the phellogen start growing a high number of cork close 

packed cells at a regular speed and as a regular cylinder around the vertical axis. This 

makes the cork tissue very homogeneous around the axis. But also because of the 

transversal growth, the cells have a specific orientation in their shape (1.1.3. Structure of 

cork tissue). However, the growth rate decreases during harvesting years. Going from 

about 6 mm per year in the first year to hardly more than 2 mm after eight years 1. Even so, 

the growth rate increases during the early years of the trees but once they have reached 

their maturity, this rate decreases every year. For example on a 140 year cork oak, until its 

70th year the cork thickness increases from 1,8 cm to almost 3 cm every year, before 

decreasing to 1,5 cm growth during its 140th year1. This irregular growth rate during its life 

affects the homogeneity of the cork layer, and could affect its properties too. This 

variablility is a drawback associated to natural material, as cork is. 

 

1.1.2 History, production and applications of cork 

 Cork has a long history, dating its first uses to the ancient times where it was used 

as such, as raw material, but with the advances of science, its processing changed in order 

to enhance some of its properties. In the present section we will shortly describe cork 

history and the progress in production and applications as years went by. 

 In Egyptian time, cork was used as stoppers for casks. Ancient Greeks added to this 

use fishing net floats and sandals. Afterwards, Romans widely used cork in a variety of 

ways, including life jackets for fishermen, still focusing on its non-wettability and low 

density. Aware of cork’s low thermal conductivity, Mediterranean homebuilder built 

cottages, for hundreds of years with cork roofs and floors to keep out summer heat and 



Ano 2015 7/59 

winter cold, and to provide a soft walking surface1. 

 Since the ancient times of Greeks and Romans until today, cork is used as bottle 

stopper material; in order to produce this bottle stoppers cylinders are cut out of raw cork 

tissue. This process generates a lot of waste material in between each bottle stopper. 

However, in the late 19th century, a German company used this cork leftover, by adding a 

clay binder to cork particles and producing sheets of cork composites for use as insulation 

materials6. This technique was improved a few years later by removing the clay binder and 

creating a pure-cork agglomeration out of waste material by subjecting cork particles to 

heat and pressure. This started a new area of improvement to create cork composites. Many 

other techniques have been developed to produce cork-based material with a variety of 

properties and uses 7. 

  

Figure 1.4 summarises some of the applications of cork materials. As already 

referred, the most well-known application for cork material is as bottle stoppers, but cork is 

also used in multiple other fields. For example, white agglomerates of cork (obtained by 

grinding virgin cork) can be used as footwear, protective helmets, life jackets and floats, 

fishing rod handles, handbags and briefcases, and even as fabric for clothing and paper. Its 

high energy-absorption property makes it useful for industrial engines as mechanical joints 

or anti-vibration material. Black agglomerate (made from cork waste which is ground and 

heated at high temperatures) is used above all for thermal, acoustic, and vibration 

insulation purposes. These grains of cork can also be combined with rubber (rubbercork) 

and used as an elastic and strong material for automotive and electrical industries. In the 

building industry, sheets of cork composites are used as covering for floors and walls 

taking advantage of the thermal isolation properties and the hydrophobicity of cork.

1.1.3 Structure of cork tissue 

 Cork tissue is created layer by layer under the phellogen layer. Its cells are empty 

and arranged in a close packed way, without intercellular void. In that way cork tissue is, 

by definition, a closed cell material, with a mean value of 10% solid fraction. This very 

low value of solid fraction is associated with cork low density, approximately equal to 120-

170 kg/m3 1.  

 As previously mentioned, in section 1.1.1. Formation and growth, the phellogen 

mother cells create the cork cells. These mother cells have a hexagonal shape base from 

which they grow the periderm in a circular growth. Basically, cork tissue looks like a 

honeycomb (Figure 1.5).  

 

Figure 1.5: SEM pictures of the honeycomb structure of cork tissues (SEM images from The Museum of 

Palaeontology of The University of California at Berkeley and the Regents of the University of California). 



Ano 2015 9/59 

 

 Cork cells are, thus, a hexagonal prism with its face in the axial-tangential plan and 

with its axis symmetry on the radial axis. Its hexagonal base has in average edges of 20 

µm, and the average length of a cork cell is 40 µm. The average thickness of a wall is 

about 1 µm. The shape of the cork cells is sketched in Figure 1.6.  

 

 

 

 The radial growth of cork cells creates an intrinsic anisotropy. Besides the obvious 

radial axis symmetry of the hexagonal prisms inducing a shape-anisotropy, it creates a 

specific chemical repartition (which will be explained in the following section 1.1.4 

Chemical composition). These anisotropies play a primordial role in the various properties 

of cork.  

 Cork is an extremely complex closed-cell material, and its properties change along 

the radial growth axis during the year. Each of its particularities and changes has an effect 

on properties of the material. 

 This honeycomb like structure explains the well-known energy absorption of cork 

material in terms of mechanical compression, thermal conduction and acoustic conduction, 

this will be explain more in details in the section 1.1.5 (Mechanical properties of cork) and 

(1.1.6 Physical properties).

lines represent the edges of other cork cells surrounding the sketched cork cell. Notice that delimited by 

both blue and black edges we can count 14 faces of contact between cork cells (Telwin polyhedron). On the

1.1.4 Chemical composition  

 For a material with such a low density and such a complex structure, the fact that 

the cells can keep their shape without collapsing is unique. We have to learn more about 

the chemical composition of cork in order to explain this steadiness. Some of cork 

properties, like for example its chemical inertness, are only due to chemical composition. 

But most of its properties result from both chemical composition and architecture of the 

cell wall. 

 As any other wood tree, cork cell wall is constituted by two types of compounds: 

structural and non-structural compounds 1. The formers are polymeric macromolecules 

responsible for the microstructure of cork; meaning that if we remove them the cell would 

collapse, and in that way they are responsible for most of cork properties. The non-

structural compounds are, essentially, low molecular weight organic compounds or 

mineral, not having an important impact on structural behaviour of cork, mainly 

influencing its chemical and biological behaviour.  

 In this study we will focus on cork's structural components, because the non-

structural components represent only 2-3% 8 of cork's global chemical composition. 

Among the structural compounds of cork material, we can quote in decreasing order of 

weight percentage (wt. %): suberin (up to 58 wt. % 9 of cell wall composition), lignin (c.a. 

22 wt. % 9) and polysaccharides (c.a. 18 wt. % 9). The ratios of these compounds are 

represented in the Figure 1.7, with the comparison of wood and cork of cork oak.

cork oak wood 1.

 Figure 1.8 shows a model, proposed by Sitte10, about the structure of cork oak cell 

wall. In the outer layer (the primary wall) are lignin and cellulose linked to suberin 

polyphenolic domain and finally suberin polyaliphatic domain. The relations between these 

components will be detailed in the following sections.

wall, (W) waxes and suberin, (P) primary wall, (M) medium lamella, (Po) pore. 

  

 The following subsections are dedicated to a brief description of cork suberin 

(1.1.4.1), lignin (1.1.4.2) and polysaccharides (1.1.4.3) in order to understand better the 

effects of their chemical composition and architecture on cork's properties, in section 1.1.5. 

Mechanical properties of cork and 1.1.6. Physical properties. 

 

 

1.1.4.1 Suberin 

 

 In the literature, there are reported suberin amounts in cork oak bark ranging from 



Ano 2015 12/59 

37,8 % 9,11 up to 60-62 % 8,12, therefore suberin is the most important component of cork 

tissue. But, besides being the most abundant component of cork, suberin is the only 

structural compound of cork that is not present in the wood of cork oak (Figure 1.7). It 

takes part in the stability of the structure of cork cells, as it has been experimentally 

observed the collapse of the cells after partially removing it 9.  

 Suberin is also found in other plants and even in different morphological parts of 

the plants13. For example, this biopolymer is present in the underground part of plants (e.g. 

tuber phellem of potato) or in the wounded upper part of the plant, acting as a protective 

barrier between the plant and the environment 14 and, in some plant cells, providing water 

retention 15. In the last decade, the definition of suberin has been actively discussed. In the 

following section we will describe the broad-accepted model suggested by Bernards 15.  

 According to this model “suberin is a natural aliphatic–aromatic cross-linked 

polyester” 13. It is indeed composed by two domains: the suberin polyaliphatic domain and 

the suberin polyaromatic (or poly(phenolic)) domain, denoted by SPAD and SPPD, 

respectively 15. Several studies showed that SPAD and SPPD represent more or less 50% 

each of suberin 16,17. The two suberin domains are cross-linked by ester linkages and 

glycerol links. The importance of glycerol in the linkage and the chemical architecture has 

been taken into account very late in the study of cork suberin, and there is still a lot to 

determine about its role in suberized cells. Graça and Pereira 8 studies reported up to 14% 

of glycerol in their chemical analysis of cork suberin. 

 

 There were a huge number of studies 8,10–12,14,17,18 focused on determining the 

composition of suberin, however depending on the method used and the sensitivity of the 

analysis devices, and/or the sample analysed, the identified compounds, but especially their 

amounts changed. Gandini summed-up most of these studies in 2006 13. Anyway, all the 

results tend to have the same order of magnitude for the amount of each family of 

compounds in cork suberin. 

 The suberin polyaliphatic domain is mainly composed of long carbon chain fatty 

acids essentially ranging from C16 to C26. Typically, in decreasing order of weight 

percentage magnitude there is: ?-hydroxyalkanoic acids (representing up to 62% of 

suberin monomers 18), then ?, ?-alkanedioic acids (representing up to 46% 17), and finally 



Ano 2015 13/59 

aliphatic acids and fatty acids represent around 10 to 15%, respectively12. These long 

carbon chains (C16 to C26) are associated to cork tissue flexibility and hydrophobicity13, 

this suberin domain is also named waxes of suberin14. Some of the most abundant 

compounds found in the SPAD are represented in Figure 1.9. In the chemical architecture 

of suberin, all these monomers are linked within the SPAD, typically by ester links, 

creating the so-called suberin oligomeric blocks 14 .  

 

Figure 1.9: Representation of typical monomers composing the SPAD of cork, organised from top to 

bottom in the lowering concentration order 13. 



Ano 2015 14/59 

 

 For a long time, it was discussed the existence of suberin polyaromatic domain 19, 

also called suberin polyphenolic domain; it was considered at first that lignin had the role 

of the aromatic domain in suberized cells. However, several studies 20–22 have shown “that 

suberized tissues contain a significant amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and a relatively 

smaller amount of monolignols than that expected for a lignified tissue”15 , this discover 

have trigger the definition of this domain of suberin: the SPPD. As previously mentioned, 

the polyaromatic part of suberin is composed by cross-linked hydroxycinnamic acids, the 

phenolic precursors of this domain are represented in Figure 1.10.  

 

 

 This domain is segregated from the aliphatic domain of suberin but is covalently 

bounded to the latter, typically by glycerol units. The SPPD is contained in the primary cell 

wall of the cork cell, which means that it is also the link between suberin and lignin in the 

architecture of the cell wall (as represented in Figure 1.8). The linking between SPPD and 

lignin is still under study but some hypotheses consider it to be fused with lignin-cellulose 

matrix 10,13,23,24; Gandini stated in 200613: “This lignin-like suberin fraction, at least in the 

case of Q. suber cork cells, is embedded (not spatially segregated) in the lignin-

carbohydrate matrix of the primary cell wall”. These domains mainly composed by cyclic 

carbons monomers are taking part of the rigidity of cork material and so helping the 

steadiness of the structure of the cells. 

 Based on all these observations and the studies quoted in the previous paragraphs, 

Bernards proposed in 200215 a model of the chemical architecture of suberin embedded in 

the cell wall topography, this model is represented in the Figure 1.11. We can see the SPPD 

Figure 1.10: Phenolic precursors detected in the SPPD domain of cork 13. 



Ano 2015 15/59 

belonging to the primary cell wall and the SPAD is part of the suberin lamellae (Figure 

1.8).  

  

 

 In conclusion, suberin is the main (&gt;50%) 9 structural polymer of cork cell walls. It 

is composed of a cross-linked aliphatic domain (long carbon chains (50% of suberin)16,17) 

which give the flexibility of the cell wall and an aromatic part (mainly acids-based 

moieties like hydroxycinnamic acids) linked by esterification, ether linkage and glycerol 

cross-linking to the aliphatic domain, giving their rigidity to the cell walls. 

  

1.1.4.2 Lignin 
 It has been noticed also the occurrence of a second type of polyaromatic cork 

domain, the well-known lignin-fraction. Lignin is the second most important component of 

Figure 1.11: Suberin structure proposed by Bernard in 2002, we can see the aromatic domain of the 

suberin as the primary cell wall, and the aliphatic part as the lamellae suberin. 11 We can notice the 

presence of phenolic functions in the aliphatic domain of suberin underlining a complex 3D structure 

where these parts are fold and linked to the aromatic domain of suberin. 



Ano 2015 16/59 

cork material, representing around 22 wt% of the cell walls mass8. As it has been shown 

for suberin, if lignin is removed from the cell wall, the cork cell collapsed 9. In that sense 

lignin is also a structural polymer of the cork cell wall. 

  Lignin is the result of “the dehydrogenation of phenolic precursors, like coniferyl 

alcohol (Figure 1.12), via a free-radical coupling process” 25. Cork lignin is mainly (95%) 

composed of guaiacyl type lignin that is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol, as in 

softwoods. Radical-radical coupling between coniferyl alcohol can be done by various 

bonds. The different coupling between the phenolic precursors units and the aromatic 

carbon ring structure give to lignin a rigid chemical structure which contributes to the 

mechanical properties of cork material. 

 

 As shown in the Figure 1.8 and described in the previous section, lignin is a 

component of the primary cell wall: composing the matrix in which the polyaromatic 

domain of suberin is embedded. Other components of this matrix are polysaccharides. 

 

1.1.4.3 Polysaccharides 
 

 The third structural polymers of plant cells are cellulose and hemicelluloses, 

representing around 20% of dry mass weight in cork 9. Polysaccharides are quite less 

abundant in cork than in wood or in other bark tissues (around 70%) 9. Like for suberin and 

lignin, the structural importance of polysaccharides, was shown by removing them from 

cork cell and observing the collapse of the cells 9.  

 Cellulose is a linear homopolysaccharide of glucose molecules linked through ?-1-

4 glycosidic bonds (Figure 1.13). In cork cell, cellulose (approximately 10 %wt) is located 

in the primary (external wall) and tertiary (intercellular wall) walls.  

 

 

1.1.5 Mechanical properties of cork 

 

 The preceding description of the geometrical and chemical structure of cork is of 

upmost importance due to the fact that they have an enormous impact on the properties of 

this material including the mechanical properties described in this subsection. 

 We have to keep in mind the anisotropy of cork cells during all mechanical tests, 

even if the cell may answer in the same way to tangential and axial stresses, the radial 

response will surely be different, as we can see in the curves of tensile test shown in the 

graph of Figure 1.146.  

Figure 1.13: Cellulose unit cell, with a ? -(1-4) glycosidic bond. 

Figure 1.14: Stress–strain curves in tensile tests for cork, in all directions: T, tangential; A, axial; R, radial 6. 

 



Ano 2015 18/59 

 

 

 Typically, the stress vs. strain (? vs. ?) curves of cork are divided in three regions, as 

expected for cellular foam materials response to compression, and as illustrated in the 

curves of Figure 1.156. At low strains, inferior to 7% 6, is observed a relatively abrupt 

yielding corresponding to the elastic deformation of the cells, typically with a stress equal 

to c.a. 0,25 MPa in axial (A) and tangential (T) directions and c.a. 0,5 MPa in the radial 

(R) direction1. Increasing the strain, a second region is reached, corresponding to the 

elastic buckling of the cells (up to 50%6 strain, for 0,7 MPa in T and A directions and 1,2 

MPa in radial direction)1. The cell walls can buckle without fracture or permanent damages 

of the walls. Finally, at higher strains, the last region corresponds to a densification of the 

cork resulting from the collapsing of the cells. A maximum densification is observed up to 

85% strain (corresponding to more than 3 MPa1). Notwithstanding, even after total 

densification of the cork tissue, it was not detected fracture or fissures in the cell walls 6. 

 

 

Figure 1.15: Typical compressive stress vs. strain curve of cork 6. 



Ano 2015 19/59 

 

 As we have seen in the compression strain measurement, cork cells have the 

capacity to bend without breaking, originating a plateau in the stress-strain compression 

curves and it explain also the very low Poisson coefficient of cork in radial compression. 

Instead of transferring the force from a cell wall to the cell walls perpendicular to the force, 

the walls absorb the energy by collapsing. In non-radial direction, the Poisson coefficient is 

even negative, and by applying the force on the sides of the hexagonal base, these phases 

are squeezed which increase their radial dimension. 

 

1.1.6 Physical properties 

 In terms of physical properties, both cork chemical composition and structure play 

an important role. Cork has a low wettability to polar liquids (contact angle of 85° with 

water)1 but it has a high affinity with non-polar liquids, which can be easily understood 

having in mind its chemical composition, especially the nature of its main component, 

suberin. This affinity between cork and non-polar (macro)molecules can be interesting in 

composites processing. 

 Cork has also a high friction due to its high energy absorption capacity in 

compression and the high surface roughness. 

 Its low solid fraction and hollow cell-like architecture is associated with cork’s very 

poor heat transfer properties by absorption of gas convection and heat radiation. 

 

1.1.7 Interests of cork 

 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, cork is a low density, closed-cell, cellular 

material with a solid fraction of around 10 to 20%. Its growth takes several years. 

Furthermore, cork has several desired properties, like for example its hydrophobicity, heat 

and acoustic isolation ability, high energy absorption or friction. Cork is not only 

interesting in terms of mechanical performance, but also its physical and thermal properties 

are highly sought-after. In fact, apart from its traditional application in the production of 

cork stoppers, cork is starting to be implemented in several new technologies and high-tech 



Ano 2015 20/59 

fields. 

Cork is a very complex material. This complexity can be seen in multiple ways: structural 

arrangement of the mater, chemical composition, arrangement of the components in the 

cell walls in order to sustain the microstructure.  

It is also recognized that the mechanical and physical properties of cork are closely linked 

to its high complexity. 

 

 This study aims, precisely, to obtain an innovative bio-based material, with 

interesting properties, by mimicking cork composition and morphology. Hence, in order to 

achieve such a complex biomaterial we had to choose chemical processes that could create 

a porous material based on biopolymers, in which the cells are close packed and 

homogenous, and more, that uses environmental friendly conditions. 

 

 

1.2 Process chosen to prepare the bio-foams 

 

 Among the wide number of bio-based porous materials existing today, some of the 

most interesting ones are those based on cellulose, and more recently on nanocellulose due 

to their properties and multiple applications, like for example, immobilization of enzymes 

26, thermal and acoustic insulation materials, also in pharmaceutical and biomedical 

fields27. These porous materials can be prepared by several approaches, probably one of the 

most popular is by polyurethane foams synthesis, however, the increase of environmental 

awareness shifted the researches towards greener processes and green materials. Among 

those, cellulose is a bio-material easy to produce and to use. Thus in 1931, S. Kistler 28 

created new cellulose-based foams, specifically cellophane aerogels, this date marks the 

beginning of the development of a lot of other cellulose aerogels using distinct 

methodologies. 

Inspired by cork composition and structure, the Pickering emulsion polymerisation 

was selected aiming to create a close cell material. Nanocellulose was selected as stabilizer 

and Acrylated Epoxidised Soybean Oil (AESO) was selected to create a matrix that mimic 



Ano 2015 21/59 

the long chain fatty acids of suberin. 

 In the following section a background description of this process and the chemical 

mechanisms behind them will be provided. Firstly, the principles associated with 

emulsions and emulsion polymerisation will be described, then the specific emulsions 

chosen for this process, the Pickering emulsions will be explained. 

 

1.2.1 Emulsions  

 An emulsion is a dispersion of one liquid in another liquid, which are immiscible. 

There are several examples of emulsions which can be found in food, e.g., vinaigrette, 

milk, mayonnaise, among many others29. 

 Almost all emulsions involve water as one phase and an organic liquid as the other 

phase. The latter is usually referred to as the ‘oil’. Hence, there are two main types of 

emulsions, i.e., ‘oil-in-water’ (o/w) and ‘water-in-oil’ (w/o). In an emulsion, the two liquids 

stay immiscible, but one of the two phases is dispersed, as droplets, in the second one. The 

former liquid is called dispersed phase, and the latter liquid is designated by continuous 

phase. Figure 1.16 30 shows a schematic illustration of an emulsion. 

 

Figure 1.16: Sketch of an emulsion, here oil-in-water emulsion30. 

 

For example, if an oil is dispersed in water without the presence of a stabilizer, the 

stability of this o/w emulsion tends to be poor30. Hence, the oil droplets tend to coalesce. 



Ano 2015 22/59 

The introduction of a surfactant in the mixture creates micelles of one liquid, dispersed in 

the second liquid, stabilizing the emulsion. The separation between the dispersed phase and 

the continuous one is called the interface. This interface is composed by the emulsifier that 

is a substance helping the stabilization of the emulsion. They are usually amphiphilic 

molecules with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, which is why surfactants are good 

emulsifiers.  

 

1.2.2 Emulsion polymerisation 

 

 Emulsions have been used in several applications including the performance of 

polymerisation reactions, like for example radical or polycondensation polymerisation 

reactions31. As previously described, an emulsion contains two phases and a stabilizer, 

typically a surfactant. Based on that fact, there is a creation of micelles by one of the two 

phases which can act as reactors, to have a localized chemical reaction in one of these two 

phases. This is the principle of emulsion polymerisation, which is sketched in Figure 1.17.  

 

Figure 1.17: Emulsion polymerisation principle30. 



Ano 2015 23/59 

 

 For example, in a radical polymerisation conducted in an o/w emulsion, droplets of 

monomers are dispersed in water. The introduction of a surfactant creates smaller micelles 

of monomer. Then a water-soluble initiator is introduced. Because the micelles are smaller 

and in bigger number than the monomer droplets, their surface area is higher, and so the 

initiator diffuse in the micelles where it start the radical polymerisation. As the quantity of 

monomer in the micelle decreases, monomers diffuse from the monomer droplets toward 

the continuous phase, then toward the micelles. This process goes on until all the droplets 

of monomers have the same size as the micelles. 

1.2.3 Pickering polymerisation 

 

 In the early 20th century, Ramsden32 and Pickering33 observed that the stabilisation 

of an emulsion occurred not only with surfactants but also with the help of small, micro-

sized particles within the interface of the emulsion. Specifically, Ramsden32 observed the 

effect of the addition of a clay, while Pickering33 studied natural “emulsion with insoluble 

emulsifiers”, like cream/milk emulsion or the use of copper sulphate particles as 

emulsifiers. This type of emulsions took the name of one of the researchers: Pickering 

emulsions. An example from everyday life is mayonnaise, which is a Pickering water-in-oil 

emulsion where the vinegar is the dispersed phase, olive oil is the continuous phase, egg 

yolk is the emulsifier (a surfactant) and small particles of mustard help the stabilization of 

the emulsion. Pickering managed to create emulsions with up to 60% of oil as the 

dispersed phase using copper or iron sulphates33. 

 In 1923, Finkle wrote the so called Finkle rule, which describes “the correlation 

between the wettability of particles and their ability to stabilise emulsions”34. It also 

explained the stability of o/w or w/o emulsions depending on the contact angle between the 

different phases. We call phase inversion to the phenomena that after a certain phase ratio, 

the dispersed phase become the continuous phase and the continuous phase become the 

dispersed phase. By tuning the concentration of the different phases, we reach a maximum 

concentration of the dispersed phase before the phase inversion occurs and change the 



Ano 2015 24/59 

dispersed phase into the external phase; this maximum is “strongly dependent on the 

affinity of the particles for the initial continuous phase”34. To evaluate if the particles of 

emulsifier are stable at the interface between oil and water, we have to determinate its free 

energy of detachment. This energy is the difference between the surface free energy of the 

system before and after being absorbed by the interface. As represented in Figure 1.18 the 

free energy of detachment from the interface toward the water can be calculated as follow 

(1):  

 ?Gdetach =  ?owA
(2)

ow + ?pwA
(2)

pw – (?owA
(1)

ow + ?pwA
(1)

pw + ?poA
(1)

po)  (1) 

Where the ?po, ?pw, and ?ow are the particle-oil, particle-water and oil–water interfacial 

tensions, respectively. 

 We can see then, knowing Young's equation, that the contact angle of the particle 

with each liquid will impact the value of the free energy of detachment. Considering small 

size and spherical particles (radius R) and a chemically smooth and homogeneous surface, 

we can obtain from equation (1) the following equation of the free energy of attachment of 

the particle to the surface (- ?Gdetach):  

 

  ?Gattach= - ?R²?ow(1 - |cos(?)|)²      (2) 

 

 The value obtain via the equation (2) is negative for all the contact angles, which 

mean that the particles will accumulate at the interface. Like so, Pickering emulsions are 

very stable emulsion 34.

 Pickering stabilised emulsion polymerisations have been already used to produce 

nanofoams31,35–38. The possibility to stabilise an emulsion up to 70% internal phase 

(dispersed phase) compared to the external phase without undergoing a phase inversion has 

been shown by Blaker and Lee 37, using hydrophobized bacterial nanocellulose. Using such 

a template to realise a poly-Pickering-M/HIPEs (Medium/High Internal Phase Emulsions) 

39 could help us getting closer to the 20% solid fraction of cork. Figure 1.19 illustrate a 

SEM image of the acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) foam obtained using this 

method.

 More recently, in 2014, Tasset et al. 40 managed to produce a promising cellular 

foam “prepared by freeze-drying oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with cellulose 

nanocrystals”40. Figure 1.20 show the SEM picture of these cellular AESO foam obtained 

in this study. They also showed that the size of the cells can be controlled by the 

concentration of the oil and the thickness of the wall by the concentration of CNCs.

Inspired by these two studies, and by the need of environmental friendly methods to 

prepare biomaterials, this study mimics the microstructure and chemical composition of 

cork tissue by Pickering emulsion approaches using bio-based raw materials in order to

2 Experimental part 

 

 The following section describes in detail the materials and methods used 

throughout this study. Firstly the reactants and other chemicals are listed; followed by the 

comprehensive description of the procedures adopted. Finally, the techniques used for the 

analysis of the samples are described. 

2.1 Materials and reagents 

 The cellulose substrates used in this study were from two distinct natures, namely: 

i) bacterial cellulose (BC) (three-dimensional network of nano and microfibrils with 10-

200 nm width), in the form of wet membranes, produced at our laboratory using  the 

Gluconoacetobacter sacchari bacterial strain41,42 and following established culture 

procedures43; ii) microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), under the trade name Avicel PH-101 

(3–5 % moisture content), purchased from Fluka. 

 For the acetylation, the reagents used are: acetic acid anhydride from Chem-Lab 

(99% - 100% pure) and sulfuric acid from Acros Organics (solution in water, 96% pure). 

 The monomer used, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO, containing 4000 ppm 

of monomethyl ether hydroquinone as inhibitor), divinylbenzene with an 80% mixture of 

isomers, namely 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (DVB, &gt;98%), and 4-acetoxystyrene (&gt;96%) 

were purchased from Sigma Aldrich-Chemicals Corp. 

 The photo-initiators adopted to carried out the UV photo-polymerisation reactions, 

2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one (Irgacure 1173, old Darocur 1173), 2,2-di- 

methoxy-1,2-diphenylethan-1-one (Irgacure 651) and 1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl-ketone 

(Irgacure 184), were all purchased from BASF. 

 All the solvents employed were analytically pure and all other reagents were used 

as received.

2.2 Methodology 

 

2.2.1 Acetylation of BC 

 Prior to the acetylation reaction, BC fibres were disintegrated and solvent 

exchanged from water to ethanol. Briefly, the BC fibres were disintegrated using an Ultra-

Turrax equipment at 11 000 rpm, for 1 hour, as illustrated in Scheme 2-1. Afterwards, the 

BC dispersing solvent was exchanged, by centrifugation, from water to ethanol, and then 

from ethanol to acetone, using a centrifuge Rotofix 32A and a Pselecta mixta, at 4 500 

rpm, during 15 minutes. For each solvent the centrifugation step was repeated five times. 

The BC was then pressed and filtrated in order to remove the solvent in excess. 

 

Scheme 2-1: Scheme of the acetylation process. 

 

 The BC acetylation was carried out, following a procedure described by Gandini et 

al.44. Approximately 300 mL of acetic acid anhydride and 1 mL of H2SO4 were added to 20 

g of BC, the mixture was heated at 30 °C, during 4 hours, under a N2 atmosphere. Then, 

the reaction mixture was stirred with an excess of water and the acetylated BC (Ac-BC) 

fibres isolated and washed sequentially with cold acetone, ethanol, water, and finally again 

with ethanol. 

 Subsequently, aiming at removing any residual trace of acetic anhydride and/or 

other impurities, the fibres were Soxhlet extracted with ethanol, during 12 hours. The Ac-

BC fibres were dispersed in water and they were ready for the emulsion preparation acting 

as a stabiliser.

2.2.2 Pickering emulsion polymerisation of AESO 

2.2.2.1 Water-in-AESO Pickering emulsions 

 

 The water-in-AESO emulsions were prepared following an adapted procedure 

described by Blaker and Lee37. Typically, they were performed in a Falcon tube (50 mL) 

using approximately 10 mL of AESO and 10 ml of water containing 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC. 

The mixture was heated at 80°C, for 30 minutes, and promptly homogenized by hand 

shaking during 1 minute. This procedure was repeated every 12 hours, for 7 days. The 

ensuing product was a stable emulsion after 3 days (Figure 2.1) as will be explained, in 

detail, in the next section (3. Results and discussion). 

 

Figure 2.1: Stable water-in-AESO (above the red line) emulsion and ejected AESO (under the red line). 

 

 To polymerise the AESO with the MCC particles inside the matrix, the same 

procedure was used, but after adding the water, 1.1 g of MCC was added to the mixture. 

Then the procedure was carried out in the same way as the previous preparation. 

2.2.2.2 Water-in-AESO/cyclohexane Pickering emulsions 

  

Water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions were also prepared following the same procedure 

described by Blaker and Lee37. Typically, these emulsions were prepared in a Falcon tube 

(50 mL) using approximately 5 mL of AESO, 5 mL of cyclohexane and 10 ml of water 

containing 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC. First the 5 mL AESO and the 5mL of cyclohexane were 



Ano 2015 32/59 

homogenised using an ultrasound bath, for 1 minute. Then, the water and Ac-BC was 

added to the mixture, promptly homogenised by hand shaking, for 1 minute and allowed to 

rest for 12 hours, at about 4 °C. Finally, the mixture was re-agitated. The ensuing product 

was a stable emulsion after 3 days of resting, as illustrated in the picture of Figure 2.2. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.2.2.3 Photo-polymerisation of water-in-AESO emulsions. 

 

Typically, the UV-photoinitiator Irgacur 1173 (0.4 wt% relatively to AESO) was 

added to the water-in-AESO stable emulsions (4 days), the mixture was shaken by hand, 

and heated at 80 °C (capped and protected from light) until a stable emulsion volume 

(around 15 mL) was reached. Samples were then irradiated during 6 hours with UV light, 

using a mercury lamp (100 W and &gt;280 nm), to photopolymerise the AESO phase. The 

ensuing foams were removed from the Falcon tube and dried, during 24h at 50 °C.  Figure 

2.3 shows an illustrative picture of an AESO-foam obtained by this process.

2.2.2.4 Photo-polymerisation of water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions. 

 

The water-in-AESO/cyclohexane emulsions were polymerised using a similar 

process. The UV-photoinitiator Irgacur 1173 (0.4 wt% relatively to AESO) was added to 

the water-in-AESO/cyclohexane stable emulsions (4 days), shaken by hand, and left in the 

refrigerator (capped and protected from light) until a stable emulsion volume (around 15 

mL) was reached. The ejected oil phase (5 mL) was removed, then the samples were 

irradiated during 6 hours with UV light, using a mercury lamp (100 W and &gt;280 nm), to 

photopolymerise the AESO phase. The ensuing foams were removed from the Falcon tube 

and dried, during 24h, at 50 °C. Figure 2.4 shows an illustrative picture of an AESO-foam 

obtained by this process.

2.2.3 Photo-polymerisation of aromatic monomers  

 

 Divinyl benzene, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and acetoxy-styrene monomers were 

photo-polymerised according to the following process: approximately 0,4 g of each 

monomers were mixed with 0,4 wt% of photo-initiator (Irgacur 184, 651, 1173). The 

mixture was then deposited on a lamella, and exposed to a UV radiation (11 W, 280 nm) 

during 6 to 8 hours to photopolymerise the monomer. The obtained films were the washed 

with chloroform to remove any residues of monomer and/or initiator, and dried.

2.3 Characterisation 

 

 The obtained materials were characterised using several techniques including 

Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR), 

Thermogravimetry Analysis (TGA), Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA), 

optic microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).  

2.3.1 Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy 

 

 The ATR FTIR spectra were acquired using a Paragon 1000 Perkin-Elmer FTIR 

spectrophotometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate ATR cell. The spectra 

were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm-1, after 64 scans with a range of 1 cm-1. 

 

2.3.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis 

 

 TGA analyses were carried out with a SETSYS Setaram TGA analyser equipped 

with a aluminum cell. Typically, samples (~17 mg) were heated at a constant rate of 10 

oC.min-1, from 25 °C to 800 °C, under a nitrogen flow of 20 ml.min-1. 

 

2.3.3 Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis 

 

 DMTA measurements of thick specimens (1 x 1 x 0.6 cm3) were carried out with 

Tritec 2000 DMTA Triton equipment operating in the compression mode. Tests were 

performed at 1 and 10 Hz, and the temperature was varied from -50 to 200 °C at 2 °C min-

1. Each measurement was repeated up to three times. 



Ano 2015 35/59 

 

2.3.4 Optical microscopy 

 

 The optical microscope images were captured with an IDS UI124DML numerical 

camera mounted on an Olympus Microscope BX51, with options of magnification as 

follow: ocular x10 and objectives x5, x10 and x20. 

 

2.3.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy 

 

 SEM images of the cross-section of foam specimens were acquired using a field 

emission gun-SEM Hitachi SU70 microscope operated at 15 kV. Samples were deposited 

on a sample holder. Before observation, the samples were coated twice with evaporated 

carbon. The magnifications used to capture the pictures were x60, x130, x1500, x2500 and 

x15000.

3 Results and discussion 

 

 Cork is an interesting material with unique properties, as have been emphasised 

throughout this Thesis and in particular in Chapter 1. Inspired by cork unique features, in 

the present study, novel cellular foams based essentially on soybean oil and cellulose were 

developed. These foams were prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerisation of acrylated 

epoxidised soybean oil (Figure 3.1) selected as the continuous oil phase, because it is 

composed of fatty acids linked with glycerol, closely resembling the chemical composition 

of cork’s suberin. The dispersed phase was water. Additionally, we have selected Ac-BC 

nanofibrils for stabilising the Pickering emulsion in order to mimic the cork composition. 

Moreover, the nanofibers were embedded inside the foam, also resembling the architecture 

of cork. Hence, the ensuing emulsions were w/o. 

 

Figure 3.1: Structure of acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (AESO)45. 

 

 The stability of the emulsion and the water/oil ratio were assessed by visual 

inspection and optical microscopy. At each step of biomaterials preparation, the products of 

the reaction were extensively characterised by ATR FTIR and SEM. Additionally, The 

ensuing foams were characterised with SEM, TGA and DMTA. 

 The following sections present the main results and discussions of acetylation of 

bacterial cellulose nanofibers (section 3.1), stabilisation of Pickering emulsions (section 

3.2), the UV photopolymerisation of AESO (section 3.3) and finally the characterisation of 

the ensuing products (section 3.4). All the experimental details related with the present 



Ano 2015 38/59 

chapter are summarised in Chapter 2. 

 

3.1 Acetylation of bacterial cellulose fibres 

After purification and hydrophobisation of the cellulose nanofibrils, we can use 

them as a stabilizer of the Pickering emulsion. The nanofibrils will assemble themselves in 

a cellular template which will be the basis of the emulsion polymerisation of the AESO.  

 After biosynthesis, bacterial cellulose fibrils are naturally hydrophilic. In order to 

be used as stabilisers for w/o Pickering emulsions, the contact angle BC/water, also called 

advancing contact angle, had to be increased37, to do so they were hydrophobised by 

acetylation of the hydroxyl groups. The acetylation reaction was perform by adapting 

acetylation reactions conditions from litterature37,44. However, oppositely to the some 

acetylation procedures described in literature, such as the one by Blacker et al. 37, the one 

we have adopted is more environmentally friendly, avoiding accordingly the massive use 

of toxic solvents, pyridine or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and hard reaction conditions. The 

procedure adopted here was carried out using only acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid. 

The acetylation reaction is schematically represented in Scheme 3-1. 

 

  

 The success of this reaction was confirmed by ATR FTIR spectroscopy, as clearly 

shown in Figure 3.2, by the appearance of a new characteristic band near 1735 cm-1, 

typically ascribed to the stretching mode of the carbonyl ester groups (?C=O)
46. Besides the 

appearance of this band, a significant reduction of the O-H stretching modes (at 3342 cm-1, 

respectively) also confirmed the acetylation reaction occurred and moreover pointed out 

for an extensive acetylation of BC fibres, which most probably has occurred not only at the 

surface but also at the bulk. The impact of the degree of acetylation on the emulsion

stability and hence on foams morphology and related mechanical properties would be of 

upmost interest to be apprehended in further studies. 

 

 

Figure 3.2: FTIR spectra of BC before and after acetylation.  

 

 The hydrophobic nature of the Ac-BC fibres was evident by their low affinity to 

acetone, ethanol and especially water used during washing and solvent exchanges. In the 

work of Blaker et al.37, they reported an increased contact angle of 64° (from 11° to 75°) 

from neat BC to acetylated BC. The contact angle of the Ac-BC films were measured at 

roughly 77°, which confirm the hydrophobisation of the BC. 

3.2 Preparation of Pickering emulsions 

 

 In order to create a cellular material, the AESO monomers must be positioned at the 

interface of the Pickering emulsion embedding Ac-BC fibres, hence the emulsions will be 

water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions, using Ac-BC as stabiliser. Note that, although AESO was 

already used in the preparation of foam materials it has never been introduced directly in 

the emulsions before, instead AESO was added by long-time oil exchange procedures. 

The emulsions stability is of upmost importance for the ensuing foam properties, especially 



Ano 2015 40/59 

its morphology and related mechanical performance. Therefore, prior to polymerisation 

reactions, we have studied the stability of water-in-AESO emulsions (Figure 3.3). The 

emulsions stability is obviously strongly related with the selected oil, and the ratio 

oil/water; besides the properties of the Ac-BC.  

 We have studied the water-in-AESO emulsion stability, during 10 days, using 

optical microscopy; and also by visual inspection and measuring the volume of ejected oil. 

According to literature it can take between 3 days37 to 7 days47 to obtain a stable emulsion 

after mixing the soybean oil, water and Ac-BC and shaking this mixture for 1 minute by 

hand, every 12 hours. Before shaking by hand, the volume of the emulsion and the volume 

of ejected oil were measured and when the volume stayed unchanged for several days, the 

emulsion was considered stable. Table 3-1 summarises the various emulsions prepared in 

order to study the emulsion stability.

 In general, only after 3 days a stable water-in-AESO Pickering emulsion, prepared 

with a feed ratio of water/AESO equal to 50/50 (V/V %) and 0.5 wt% of Ac-BC (E1, E3 

and E5), was obtained. Figure 3.3 presents the average values of the tests done on the 

water-in-AESO emulsions beside a picture of the stabilised emulsion in the 45 mL Falcon 

tube.

 As we can see in Table 3-1 and Figure 3.3, the ejected oil ratio was about 60%, thus 

the remaining emulsion has around 60% internal phase. We can conclude that we have 

indeed prepared a High Internal Phase Emulsions (HIPEs)48. This condition is primordial, 

as cork material has a solid fraction of 10%, this HIPEs can produce a 30 to 40% solid 

fraction foam. 

 The optical microscopy imaging (Figure 3.4) allowed confirming the identity of 

each phase. Typical microscopy images of Figure 3.4 of the upper phase (usually called 

emulsion phase, visible in Figure 3.3) confirmed on the one hand that we have the 

characteristic appearance of a HIPE with micro-sized water droplets, and on the other hand 

the bottom phase (ejected oil phase) have a more homogeneous with only rare and small 

water and air droplets.

 Additionally, in order to have a higher surface area on the top of the reaction tube 

and hence, in the polymerisation step, to directly irradiate the sample in a higher surface 

area and, thus, to promote a more rapid and higher extension of polymerisation, 

stabilisation of emulsion in a larger tube (plastic cup with 150 mL) was tested. The 

emulsion E6, prepared in a 150 mL plastic tube, was compared to sample E5, prepared in a 

45 mL Falcon tube. However, stabilisation of this emulsion was not possible with such a 

wide surface of contact between the emulsion and the air. Non-homogeneous water phases 

were obtained with a few much bigger water droplets in the emulsion. 

 

 Additionally, we have also prepared water-in-soybean oil emulsions (E1 and E2) 

following exactly the procedure described by Bismark et al.37 (Table 3-1). However, this 

procedure involved a laborious step consisting of a phase-exchange from unmodified 

soybean oil to AESO. Another aspect of upmost importance is that these emulsions had a 

lower internal phase ratio (c.a. 50%) which qualified the emulsions as medium internal 

phase emulsions (MIPEs),48 oppositely to the water-in-AESO (E3-6).  

 

 The E5 emulsion had a concentration of cellulose of around 1% of BC in the final 

product. Comparing this value with the 20% of cellulose in cork material, it is obvious we 



Ano 2015 43/59 

had to find a way to increase the cellulose concentration in the final product. Table 3-2 

provides a comparison of emulsion E5 with the two emulsions prepared in order to 

increase the proportion of cellulose in the final foam.

 To increase the cellulose concentration in the obtained product we mixed the AESO 

with cyclohexane before preparing the emulsion E8. With an oil phase composed of equal 

volumes of AESO and cyclohexane, the concentration of cellulose in the final product was 

doubled, i.e., it reached 2 %. Figure 3.5 presents a picture of the obtained emulsion, 

showing the ejected oil at the top of the emulsion phase. 

 This ejected oil was removed before the photo-polymerisation reaction. However, 

for the water-in-AESO emulsion, removing the oil phase means putting a pipette through 

the emulsion phase and this procedure was found to destabilise the emulsion. From this 

observation, it was decided to perform the polymerisation with both phases and to cut out 

the ejected oil phase afterwards.

Figure 3.5: Emulsion E8 of water-in-AESO/cyclohexane 

 

 This new emulsion using a mixture of AESO and cyclohexane as the oil phase, in 

order to stabilise a higher internal phase emulsion, besides increasing the concentration of 

BC in the ensuing foam, also reduced the viscosity of AESO which allowed to simplify the 

emulsion preparation, avoiding thus the need for heating and also reducing the time needed 

to have a stable emulsion (around 2 days).  

 Another strategy was tried (E7) to increase the cellulose content in the obtained 

foam. We aimed to stabilise the emulsion with as much Ac-BC as it was tried in the 

literature37, i.e. 2wt% of the water phase, we added to this mixture the remaining mass of 

microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) needed to obtain an expected cellulose concentration of 

10%. However, we did not managed to create a stable emulsion, the introduction of MCC 

seems to destabilise the system. The hydrophilic microcrystalline cellulose was probably 

the cause of this destabilisation. 

3.3 Optimisation of UV photopolymerisation of AESO  

 Once the conditions needed to obtain a stable emulsion were optimised, i.e. 50/50 

w/o ratio with 3 days heating for water-in-AESO and 2 days rest for water-in-

AESO/cyclohexane, the photopolymerisation reactions were performed. In the following 

part, we describe and discuss the different foams produced by UV-photoplymerisation, and 

how from these observations we optimised the photopolymerisation of AESO.

  Choosing between two lamp (different powers) and the conditions of 

polymerisation, four samples were polymerised. The conditions of these experiments are 

summarised in the Table 3-3.

 Two mercury (?&gt;280nm) UV lamps with different powers (11 and 100 W) were 

used to photo-polymerise AESO monomer into the corresponding AESO polymer49 

(PPAESO). Using the 100W lamp, the ensuing foams (F2 and F4) were efficiently 

polymerised in all extent of its depth as confirmed by ATR FTIR. Figure 3.6 shows the 

FTIR spectra of F2’s PPAESO of the inside and outside of the foam compared with the one 

of AESO monomer. The success of the polymerisation was confirmed by the strong 

decrease in the intensity of the acrylate moiety related bands, the decrease of the C=C bond 

stretching at 1617–1636 cm-1; as well as the in-plane C-H deformation of C-H2 at 1406 cm

well as the ATR FTIR of the inside of the F2 foam (right). 

 

 The 11 W UV-lamp been faster and easier to manipulate it was our choice for the 

first polymerisation reactions: the F1 and F3 foams. However, after the polymerisation it 

was clear that the middle of the F1 foam was not polymerised. Figure 3.7 shows clearly 

this problem on the picture of the foam and on the comparison of the FTIR in different part 

of the foam, where we can see that the double bound C=C stretching band does not 

disappear in the FTIR spectra of the inside of the foam compared to the spectra of the 

AESO monomer.

 The polymerisation of the E8 emulsion was also firstly carried out with the 11 W 

lamp first (foam F3). As we can see on Figure 3.8, the polymerisation of the F3 foam was 

not totally successful; we can see that the inside of the sample is not well polymerised as 

expected from previous results. But the material obtained is cellular and the cyclohexane 

does not evaporate under the heat of the lamp quickly enough to destabilise the emulsion. 

And we can also see on the Figure 3.8 the full polymerisation of the F4 foam using a lamp 

with a higher power (100 W). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.4 Characterisation of the ensuing foams 

 

 This section is focused on the analysis of foams (F2 and F4) obtained after 

Figure 3.8: Picture of F3 (left) after a longitudinal opening compared with the transversal cut of F4 

(right).

optimisation of the procedures previously described. Both foams were characterised using 

SEM imaging and thermal stability was evaluated by TGA. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal 

Analysis (DMTA) was also performed to characterise the thermo-mechanical properties of 

the foam. These properties are comparable to cork material and improved as we bring the 

composition of the foam closer to the one of the later. 

3.4.1 SEM images 

 

 In Figure 3.9 two typical SEM images of F2 and F4 foams, at x60 and x30 

magnification, respectively, provide a general overview of their morphology. The SEM 

images were analysed using an image analysis software, the results of the cell count and 

measurement are shown in the table 3.4. The two foams have both the internal phase ratio 

of a HIPE. However, the cell size of the foams varies from 410 µm for F2 to the double 

(881 µm) for F4.

foam is smoother and with less porosity than in F4 foam. Figure 3.10 represents a close-up 

of the continuous phase of each foams. This characteristic is also shown by the standard 

variation % of the table 3-4. This difference is probably due to the evaporation of the 

cyclohexane from the oil phase after polymerisation of the AESO, we can also see this 

phenomenon on the side of the bigger cells.

 With a higher magnification on the side of a cell, we can see the embedding of the 

cellulose fibres in the matrix of the PPAESO. Figure 3.11 shows the magnification of the 

cell’s wall compared to SEM picture of modified bacterial cellulose x15000, on this 

pictures we can see the modified cellulose fibres showed by the black arrows.

3.4.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis 

 

 Thermogravimetric analysis was used to study the thermal stability of the 

nanocomposite foams and of the corresponding individual components.  

 Figure 3.12 shows the TGA curves of the bio-foams F2 and F4 as well as the TGA 

of Ac-BC and AESO monomer. Results revealed that this foam was thermally stable up to 

260 °C (at 5 % weight). The foam’s thermogram showed a three step weight loss profile 

displaying decompositions due to both modified BC and the AESO polymer, the main 

peaks of this curves are listed in the Table 3-5. Starting to degrade at around 130 ºC and 

reached their first maximum decomposition between 163-168 ºC (at 3% weight loss), 

probably due to the water release. The second degradation step of the nanocomposite 

corresponded to the degradation of the AESO and began at 253 °C with a maximum at 

381-384 °C as well as the last observed decomposition step have a maximum at 416-420 

°C, followed by a slower complete volatilization ending near 500 °C. The shift of the TGA 

peak at 380 °C can be explained by the presence of the Ac-BC peak at 361 °C.

 In comparison with cork material50, the first degradation around 170°C for 3.85% 

weight loss was also measured by A. Mir and his colleagues50. Also, the degradation 

around 380°C, correspond to the suberin degradation measured by Gandini et all13, as well 

as the 80% volatilization at 470°C (427°C in our case). 

 

3.4.3 Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis 

 

 DMTA analysis was performed in compression mode to investigate the mechanical 

properties of the new bio-foams. Figure 3.13 displays the storage modulus vs temperature 

and the tan ? vs temperature curves (E’ vs T and tan ? vs. T) of F2 and F4 foams. We can 

see that the storage modulus of both foams decrease with increasing temperature due to the 

softening of the material. This inflection of the E’ vs T plots is related with the occurrence 

of a relaxation process. The tan ? vs. T curves of both foams show two transitions, a first 

smaller one at sub-ambient temperatures and a second broader transition at higher 

Figure 3.12: Thermogravimetric trace of the foam F2, showing a three step degradation profile 



Ano 2015 52/59 

temperatures. Similar DMTA curve profiles (tan ? vs. T) were also described in literature 

for cork material51,52. 

 The tan ? vs T curve of F2 foam displays the second transition at a maximum 

temperature of approximately 30 °C (f = 1 Hz), while in the case of F4 foam, it was found 

at much higher values, ca 60 °C (f = 1 Hz), probably due to the highest amount of Ac-BC 

in the latter foam. Furthermore, this transition is frequency dependent (roughly 12 oC 

difference), and hence is ascribed to the glass transition temperature. 

 

 

 The shift of the second transition temperature (from 30 °C to 62 °C) could be 

explained by the increase in the crosslinking which is associated with the density decrease 

of AESO when mixed with cyclohexane. The full interpretation of DMTA behaviour still, 

however, needs further investigation.

Conclusion  

 For such an ancient material as cork is, the multiple ways of use and applications of 

cork are impressive. However, only in the last decades, with the increase interest on 

innovative bio-based materials for different technologies, cork has been used for other 

applications rather than bottle stoppers. Its properties, like hydrophobicity, thermal and 

acoustic isolation, high energy absorption, high friction among others, are due to cork 

microstructure and chemical architecture and these were a source of inspiration for the 

herein presented study. 

 Indeed, by mimicking this rare microstructure and chemical composition, bio-based 

high performance materials were developed, specifically in this study we used 

nanocellulose fibrils as stabiliser of a water in an acrylated soybean oil Pickering emulsion 

(w/o). 

 Novel bio-based foams, entirely based on renewable resources, were successfully 

produced by environment friendly approaches based on photo-polymerising water-in-

AESO emulsions. The cellular-like microstructure of these foams was confirmed with 

SEM imaging and it was found that cells had an average diameter ranging from 410 to 800 

µm. 

Moreover, it was found that this microstructure, especially the pore size and density can be 

simply tuned by changing the AESO/water ratio. The maximum decomposition 

temperature, determined by TGA, of the ensuing foams were found to be up to 427 oC. The 

mechanical properties of the foams were studied by DMTA, and the glass transition value 

was found to be between 30-60 oC, most probably associated with the amount of Ac-BC 

incorporated. 

 Finally, a few words to highlight that the present study, carried out during this 

thesis, above all contributes to the development of novel biomaterials inspired by nature, 

following the pertinent need to develop sustainable materials by eco-friendly approaches. 

Moreover, after this thesis, some future investigation directions were opened, representing 

new and stimulating challenges. In further studies it would be interesting to compare the 

impact of the degree of acetylation of BC on the stability of the emulsions and on porosity. 



Ano 2015 54/59 

Also, another challenge is the preparation of bio-foams, incorporating lignin-like 

monomers, such as DVB, which will have an impact in the foam properties, especially 

their thermal behaviour. 



Ano 2015 55/59 

Annexe 1 : 

UV-Polymerisation of aromatic monomers: 

 

 In order to closely mimic cork the novel biomaterial, should have in its chemical 

composition suberin-like monomers and cellulose, as the previously described foams, 

besides possessing an aromatic fraction, usually associated with lignin. Indeed, lignin has a 

primer importance in the structure and composition of cork material as described above in 

section 1.1.4.2 in more detail. In this study several aromatic-monomers were considered to 

mimic lignin-monomers, namely, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, acetoxystyrene and 

divinylbezene (DVB) (Scheme 1). Each of these monomers has an aromatic part and a 

vinyl group which allowed their radical polymerisation. DVB is also interesting 

considering the possibility of crosslinking while polymerising. 

 

                       

Scheme 1: From left to right: divinylbezene (DVB), acetoxystyrene and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. 

                   

 The polymerisation of DVB was carried out with three different initiators. The 

PDVB spectrums are represented on the Figure 1, the characteristic peaks of PDVB can be 

observed. The absorption peaks at 700-750 cm–1 are benzene ring deformation vibrations53;  

the absorption peaks at 1500, 1600 cm–1 are associated with benzene ring C = C stretching 

vibration53 and  the aliphatic C-H stretching vibration is observed at 2920 cm–1 whereas 

3030 cm–1 showed the characteristic peaks of aromatic C-H stretching vibration53.
