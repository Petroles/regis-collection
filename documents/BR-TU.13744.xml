resumo 
 

 

A biorremediação é tida como uma possível estratégia na recuperação de 
ecossistemas contaminados com hidrocarbonetos. A aplicação eficaz desta 
tecnologia é, no entanto, muitas vezes limitada pela natureza hidrofóbica dos 
contaminantes. O recurso a estirpes bacterianas simultaneamente 
degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos e produtoras de biossurfactantes apresenta 
um enorme potencial na reciclagem de compostos hidrofóbicos. Assim, o 
objectivo deste trabalho consistiu em avaliar o potencial biotecnológico do 
sistema estuarino da Ria de Aveiro quanto à presença de bactérias 
hidrocarbonoclásticas produtoras de biossurfactantes e a avaliação de várias 
combinações de inóculos ambientais e fontes de carbono para a obtenção de 
isolados bacterianos de interesse.  
Para tal foram realizadas experiências em meios selectivos (diesel, crude e 
parafina) a partir de inóculos de diferentes matrizes ambientais: amostras da 
microcamada superficial (SML), sedimentos estuarinos e rizosfera de bancos 
de Halimione portulacoides, uma planta halófita dos sapais da Ria de Aveiro. O 
desenvolvimento da cultura ao longo do período de incubação foi avaliado pela 
contagem de unidades formadoras de colónias (CFUs). A cultura selectiva com 
maior teor de bactérias cultiváveis foi a de crude-sedimento e aquela em que a 
abundância bacteriana foi mais baixa foi a de diesel-rizosfera. A partir da 
análise dos perfis de DGGE dos fragmentos do gene 16s rRNA do DNA total 
extraído das culturas selectivas verificou-se que no fim do período de 
incubação, o grau de semelhança entre as comunidades bacterianas das 
culturas selectivas é relativamente baixo. Pelo índice de diversidade de 
Shannon-Weaver a maior diversidade estrutural das comunidades bacterianas 
encontra-se nas culturas selectivas de parafina (2,5231), seguidas das de 
crude (2.2509) e das de diesel (1.6727). Das culturas selectivas, foi obtido um 
conjunto de isolados que foi testado quanto à capacidade de produção de 
biossurfactantes pelo método atomized oil. De 66 isolados testados, 17 
produziram resultado positivo (25,8%), sendo a água da SML a matriz 
ambiental com melhores resultados e o diesel a melhor fonte de carbono para 
o isolamento de bactérias produtoras de biossurfactantes. 
Tendo em conta o elevado número de isolados obtidos e a percentagem de 
produtores de biossurfactantes, pode concluir-se que na Ria de Aveiro, 
particularmente na SML, existem comunidades bacterianas adaptadas à 
utilização se substratos hidrofóbicos, com uma boa representação de 
produtores de biossurfactantes. Os resultados confirmam a perspectiva de que 
a SML da Ria de Aveiro é um microhabitat com elevado potencial 
biotecnológico para isolamento de estirpes de bactérias hidrocarbonoclásticas 
produtoras de biossurfactantes com promissoras aplicações em processos de 
biorremediação de regiões estuarinas e costeiras após contaminação acidental 
com hidrocarbonetos de petróleo.

abstract 

 
Bioremediation has proven to be an effective strategy in the recuperation of oil 
contaminated ecosystems. However most bacteria used in this processes, 
while being able to degrade a wide range of the oil hydrocarbons, have limited 
action due to the low water solubility of these compounds. Hence, a possible 
solution for this problem would be the use of biosurfactant-producing bacteria, 
since the presence of surfactants help improve the hydrocarbons dispersal, 
solubilization and bioavailability. The objective of this work was to assess the 
biotechnological potential of Ria de Aveiro estuarine system regarding the 
presence of hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria and to 
evaluate different combinations of environmental inocula and carbon sources 
for the isolation of biosurfactants producing bacteria. 
Selective cultures (diesel, crude and paraffin) were prepared using inocula from 
different environmental matrixes: samples from the surface microlayer (SML), 
bulk estuarine sediments and sediments of the rhizosphere of Halimione 
portulacoides, a characteristic halophyte from the salt marshes of Ria de 
Aveiro. During the incubation period, the development of the selective cultures 
was assessed by quantification of colony forming units (CFU). The highest 
value of CFU was obtained in the crude-sediment culture, while the lowest 
value was found with the diesel-rhizosphere combination. The DGGE profiles of 
the 16s rRNA gene fragments of the total community DNA extracted at the end 
of the incubation of the selective cultures, show that communities were different 
in terms of structural diversity. The values of the Shannon-Weaver index of 
diversity indicate that the higher diversity was achieved in the selective cultures 
with paraffin as carbon source (2.5231), followed by the crude oil (2.2509), and 
diesel (1.6726) selective cultures. From the selective cultures, 111 presumably 
hydrocarbonoclastic isolates were obtained after isolation and purification. Of 
these, 66 were tested for biosurfactant production by the atomized oil assay, 
with positive results for 17 isolates (25.8%). The environmental matrix with best 
results was the SML water and diesel was the most effective carbon source.  
Having in consideration the high number of isolates obtained from the selective 
cultures and the percentage of biosurfactant producers, the estuarine system of 
Ria the Aveiro, and in particular the SML, can be regarded as an  interesting 
seedbank for the prospection of hydrocarbonoclastic and biosurfactants 
producing bacteria. The SML microhabitat shows particularly high 
biotechnological potential for the isolation of bacterial strains with interesting 
properties for application in bioremediation strategies in coastal and estuarine 
areas.

1. INTRODUCTION 



 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Petroleum and its products 

Petroleum is a form of bitumen
1
 composed mainly of hydrocarbons and in nature is found 

in gaseous or liquid state, with crude oil, being the liquid part of petroleum [1]. 

The composition and characteristics of different types of crude oil vary considerably 

depending on the origin and age of the oil fields. These differences are due to the fact that 

although each kind of crude oil contains basically the same hydrocarbon compounds, the 

proportion of these hydrocarbons varies considerably from one crude to another [2].  

Crude oil is a heterogeneous liquid, consisting of hydrocarbons comprised almost entirely 

of the elements hydrogen and carbon in the ratio of 1.85:1 respectively. It also contains elements 

such as nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, all of which constitute less than 3 % (v/v). There are also 

trace constituents, comprising less than 1 % (v/v), including phosphorous and heavy metals such 

as vanadium and nickel [1, 3]. The smallest hydrocarbon molecule in crude oil is methane 

(MW=16) and the largest are asphaltenes, with molecular weights in the tens of thousands. In 

between these two compounds there are thousands of others with a wide range of structural 

complexity: alkanes (or paraffins), cycloalkanes (or naphthenes or cycloparaffins), alkenes (or 

olefins), and arenes (or aromatics) [1]. 

The main characteristics of heavy hydrocarbons, such as those found in crude oils and 

heavy fuels, are variable density, low biodegradability, low solubility, low volatility, high viscosity 

and high sorption in soils. On the other hand, commercial hydrocarbons, which are lighter and are 

found in petrol and diesel fuel, have lower density than water, have higher biodegradability, 

generally have low solubility, although some fractions can be more soluble than others, highly or 

moderately volatile, low to medium viscosity and variable sorption in soils [4]. 

Diesel fuel is a product of petroleum distillation and contains on average 90 % aliphatic 

hydrocarbons and 10 % aromatic compounds. The most soluble fractions makes up to 

approximately 5 % by volume. It is possible to find very small traces of the following potentially 

dangerous compounds: benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene [4]. More specifically, some 

                                                           
1
  “Native substances of variable color, hardness, and volatility, composed principally of the elements 

carbon and hydrogen and sometimes associated with mineral matter, the nonmineral constituents being 
largely soluble in carbon disulfide” [1].  



 
 
  
 
  Introduction

batches of marine diesel oil (Table 1), a product of variable toxicity, can have a very high content 

of aromatic fractions (40 % or more). Other toxic materials such as phenols and sulphur 

compounds may also be present [5].

1.2 Petroleum spillages and oil bioremediation approaches  

Petroleum and its products are 

used at a global scale in almost all sort 

of modern activities. Such widespread 

use requires its constant 

transportation, which ultimately results 

in accidental or intentional leakages to 

the environment (Figure 1). The major 

causes for accidental oil spills are oil 

well blowouts, maritime accidents, 

pipeline ruptures, and explosions or 

leakages at storage facilities [6]. On the other hand, intentional releases such as operational 

discharges, that are often small, deliberate and “routine”, can in most cases be controlled and/or 

avoided [7].  

The extent of the environmental and socio-economical impacts caused by an accidental 

oil spill can be determined by several factors [7]: 

? The amount, rate and type of oil spilled; 

? The location and the political and legal issues in place (which can influence the choice of 

the clean-up strategy adopted); 

? The vicinity to sensitive resources;

? The choice and effectiveness of cleanup strategies. 

Oil spills are one of major causes of ocean pollution caused by maritime transport of 

petroleum products, which most of the times end in ecological disasters of wide public concern 

[8, 9]. The resulting black tides can affect the environment in several ways. Although the groups 

that suffer the most are mainly birds, fish, sea mammals and several marine invertebrate species, 

due to negative effects in their physiology, immunology and development [10-12], some black 

tides can affect whole aquatic food chains [13]. As a consequence, oil spill can result in an 

accentuated decrease or disappearance of populations of marine fauna and flora within the 

affected area [14]. 

On land, the contamination of soils with petroleum or its products leads to a decrease on 

food productivity since it affects the germination and growth of some plants, as well as soil 

fertility [15, 16]. Also, crude oil contamination of land affects certain parameters of the soil, such 

as the mineral and organic matter content, the cation exchange capacity, the redox properties,  

and the pH [17]. 

Although large oil spills have higher ecological impacts than small scale events, it is also 

common for the later to have disastrous consequences in endangered species, especially when 

they occur in pristine areas [18]. It is also worth mentioning that, besides  environmental damage, 

there are also the consequential high costs to fisheries, agriculture, related industries, and 

tourism in the affected areas [19].  

Accidental spills have prompted the development of methodologies to deal with the 

resulting oil pollution both at sea and on land. These can be physical or chemical methods such as 

those illustrated in Figure 2, which are fairly well established, or biotechnological methods, which 

in the past decade have been subject to much debate and increasing research efforts. The later 

include such methods as the use of straw or plant material as an absorbent for oil, biosurfactants 

to clean oiled surfaces [20], biological polymers to coat surfaces and to prevent oil adhesion, and 

the addition of materials [21] (microorganisms or nutrients/fertilizers) to stimulate 

microbiological biodegradation of oil [22, 23].  

This last procedure, also known as bioremediation, can be defined as the process of 

adding materials (nutrients - biostimulation or microorganisms - bioaugmentation) to 

contaminated environments under controlled conditions to cause an acceleration of the natural 

biodegradation processes until the contaminated site becomes innocuous or the contaminant 

reaches levels below the concentration limits established by the regulatory authorities [21, 24].  



 
 
  
 
  Introduction 

11 
 
 
 

 

Successful bioremediation strategies can be a fairly complete solution to oil 

contamination, since the contaminants are converted into microbial biomass, water, and gases, 

primarily carbon dioxide, which form part of the carbon cycle [5, 25].  Physical methodologies only 

transfer the contaminant from one environmental compartment to another. For example, 

although some oil physically recovered from beaches may be recycled, in many cases it is stored 

in pits or landfills [22]. Additionally, in terms of the biota, bioremediation is one of the few 

processes that will actually remove toxic components from the environment. In fact, some field 

studies suggest that the natural rates of oil biodegradation on coastal shorelines can be 

stimulated two- to sevenfold by bioremediation strategies [22]. Nevertheless, it should be noted 

that bioremediation strategies are much slower to effectively remove the oil than intensive 

physical cleaning methods [22]. In cases of oil spills at sea, oil biodegradation rates are not 

sufficiently high, even when stimulated by the addition of nutrients or competent 

microorganisms, which makes this strategy unlikely to be used as a first response in these cases 

[26].  Bioremediation is also not the most adequate strategy to apply in cases where there are 

important environmental and/or political reasons to proceed with a quick decontamination. 

However, treatment options of the contaminated site should be considered regarding the overall 

benefits for the environment, weighting the gains of oil removal against the consequences of the 

cleanup strategy in each particular situation [22]. In this aspect, bioremediation tends to perform 

Figure 2 – Oil spill physical and chemical clean-up methods: a) beach clean-up by substratum removal; b)

well, considering that its application can usually be conducted at low cost, with limited personnel, 

and with relatively little or no environmental impact [24, 27]. 

The success of bioremediation strategies depends on several factors. The most relevant 

are the type of contaminated matrix (soil/water), the penetration of the fertilizer and/or 

microorganisms in the impacted environment, the presence and concentration of biodegradable 

petroleum hydrocarbons in oil, the presence of other toxic compounds besides crude oil 

components, the level of available oxygen and nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, the 

biodiversity of hydrocarbonoclastic and cometabolising bacteria on site, the nature of the 

bioremediation product, and the prevailing environmental conditions, particularly temperature 

and pH [17, 22]. Oil-degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in the environment [28, 29]. 

However, according to some studies, there is not a single microbial species that has the enzymatic 

ability to metabolize more than two or three classes of compounds typically found in a crude oil 

[30]. Therefore, consortia of several different bacterial species are often required to achieve 

significant levels of crude oil degradation after a spill [22]. Bioaugmentation strategies, involving a 

consortium of bacteria, are preferred to biostimulation in cases where pollutant toxicity or a lack 

of appropriate microorganisms, both in quantity and in quality, is important. The potential success 

of such strategy requires an understanding of the survival and activity of the added 

microorganism(s) and their genetics, as well as the knowledge of the general environmental 

conditions that control the biodegradation rates [23].  

1.3 Oil-degrading bacteria  

 Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are widely distributed in marine habitats. Still, their roles 

in a natural marine environment or in oil-contaminated sites, with or without treatments such as 

the addition of fertilizers to enhance microbial activity, are largely unknown [31]. Some studies 

have shown that the introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive 

blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera, usually obligate 

hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) (e.g. Alcanivorax), which are present at low or undetectable 

levels before the polluting event [32, 33]. As result, there is an increase of the degradation rate of 

many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by the addition of the limiting 

nutrients [34]. Marine hydrocarbon degraders are usually highly specialized obligate hydrocarbon 

users, while  terrestrial hydrocarbon degraders are more likely to be metabolically versatile and 

utilize a large range of organic substrates [31]. 



 
 
  
 
  Introduction

 Some of the most common bacteria found in oil-impacted marine environments belong to 

the genus Alcanivorax, and have been proven to be important to the biodegradation of 

petroleum, especially under bioremediation conditions [35]. These Gram-negative marine 

bacteria are known to produce biosurfactants when using n-alkanes as substrate [36]. 

Additionally, they cannot use carbohydrates and amino acids as growth substrates [37]. 

Alcanivorax borkumensis is considered the paradigm of OHCB, and as such, its genome 

sequencing and functional genomic analysis has proven to be very helpful in understanding the 

genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic 

pathways used in hydrocarbon degradation, and its ecological success [31]. 

 Other bacterial genera already known for their capacity to degrade hydrocarbons are 

Pseudomonas, Marinobacter, Microbulbifer, Sphingomonas, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Dietzia 

and Gordonia [23]. 

 The biodegradation potential of microorganisms is dependent of its genetic 

characteristics. Plasmids are thought to play a leading role in this aspect, since the ability to 

degrade more recalcitrant components of petroleum are generally plasmid generated [38]. 

Although catabolic plasmids are non-vital genetic elements, they provide a metabolic versatility 

not normally present in the cell (Table 2). Additionally, many of the bacterial catabolic pathways 

are associated to conjugative plasmids [39]. Since these plasmids are readily transferred laterally

into new host bacteria, other members of the community will acquire new degradation abilities 

leading to an increase of the metabolic potential in the ecosystem. It is such genetic potential that 

allows the evolution of integrated and regulated pathways for the degradation of hydrocarbons. 

Therefore, in an environment rich in a particular organic compound, the selective pressure may 

lead to the acquisition and maintenance of plasmids that encode the corresponding catabolic 

pathway [23]. For that reason, it is common to find degraders of exotic compounds in 

environments contaminated with such compounds. In some cases, the same catabolic genes may 

be located on a plasmid in one organism and on the chromosome in another, and these catabolic 

genes may influence the expression of other sets of catabolic genes present in the same cell [40]. 

1.3.1 Microbial degradation of oil hydrocarbons 

Petroleum oil biodegradation by bacteria can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic 

conditions, although by the action of different consortia of organisms. In both cases an exogenous 

electron acceptor is needed for the degradation of hydrocarbons (being fully reduced substrates) 

by the microorganisms. In aerobic conditions, this electron acceptor is oxygen in the initial attack, 

and in most cases, also the electron acceptor of the subsequent steps [23]. In the subsurface, 

where there is low availability of molecular oxygen, oil biodegradation occurs primarily under 

anaerobic conditions. In these cases, biodegradation of partially oxygenated intermediates is 

mainly mediated by sulphate or nitrate reducing bacteria, or other anaerobes using other kinds of 

electron acceptors as the oxidant [23, 41]. Petroleum hydrocarbons are known to persist under 

strict anaerobic conditions, however in certain types of coastal marine sediments, under sulphate-

reducing conditions some of these compounds are degraded. This kind of sediment when used to 

inoculate sediment that does not present the ability to degrade hydrocarbons under anaerobic 

conditions, induces the degradation of such components. This leads to believe that hydrocarbon 

contamination could be treated under sulphate-reducing conditions and that the inoculation with 

foreign microorganisms or equivalent samples of anaerobic microbial consortia adapted to 

specific hydrocarbons would be effective to stimulate the anaerobic biodegradation of these 

hydrocarbons [42, 43]. 

The inherent biodegradability of petroleum hydrocarbons depends on the chemical 

structures, physical state and toxicity of the compounds. For example, while n-alkanes are the 

group of petroleum components more readily biodegradable, the C5-C10 homologues are toxic to 

the majority of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, since as solvents they tend to disrupt lipid 

membrane structures of microorganisms [44]. The fact that petroleum hydrocarbons, both in 



 
 
  
 
  Introduction 

15 
 
 
 

 

crude oil and in refined products, occurs in complex mixtures, also affects the biodegradation rate 

of each component. This can have a positive or negative effect in the overall degradation process. 

In certain cases, some iso-alkanes are spared as long as n-alkanes are available as substrates, 

while, on other cases, some condensed aromatics are metabolized only in the presence of more 

easily utilisable petroleum hydrocarbons, a process referred to as co-metabolism [45]. 

As mentioned before there is a certain ubitiquity of gene clusters for the degradation of n-

alkanes and (poly)aromatic fractions of oil in bacteria (Figure 3). For instance the alkSB1GHJ gene 

cluster, which encodes for enzymes involved in the degradation of n-alkanes, is present in A. 

borkumensis strain SK2 as well as in several other bacteria [31]. The alkSB1GHJ clusters of 

Marinobacter aquaeolei and Oceanocaulis alexandrii are flanked by putative transposase genes 

which is consistent with a previous observation that gene clusters for alkane degradation can be 

transferred among bacteria via mobile genetic elements [46].  

As with alkanes, there is a similarity in the organization of genes associated to the 

degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons amongst different species of bacteria. Sequence analysis of 

Cycloclasticus sp. A5 revealed a cluster of phn genes involved in the degradation of naphthalene, 

methylnaphthalene, phenanthrene and dibenzothiophene. The phnA1, phnA2, phnA3 and phnA4 

genes encode, PAH dioxygenase, the enzyme involved in initial step of the degradation pathway 

[47].  PAHs possessing four or more fused aromatic rings have very low water solubility and tend 

to be adsorbed to solid surfaces. These characteristics make them recalcitrant to biodegradation. 

However, some Mycobacteria and Sphingomonas are known to degrade these heavier PAHs [3, 

35]. On the other hand, cycloalkanes, are degraded by a co-oxidation mechanism. These 

compounds are transformed by an oxygenase system to a corresponding cyclic alcohol, which is 

dehydrated into a cyclic ketone. Then, a monooxygenase system lactonises the ring, which is 

subsequently cleaved by lactone hydrolase. However, the two oxygenase systems usually never 

occur in the same organism, which makes necessary the use of synergistic actions by microbial 

communities to degrade cycloalkanes [48]. The degradation of substituted cycloalkanes seems to 

be less difficult than that of unsubstituted cycloalkanes [35].

1.3.2 Methods of isolation and characterization of oil-degrading bacteria 

The initial method to isolate and identify petroleum-degrading microorganisms involved 

the use of hydrocarbons incorporated into agar-based medium [30]. The major problem of this 

approach is that in some studies, only a low percentage of the isolates from agar-based media 

could be demonstrated to actually be capable of hydrocarbon utilisation [23]. Therefore it is 

advisable to use media without agar, for example, silica-gel oil medium, as well as to have counts 

of petroleum degraders be expressed as a percentage of the total population rather than as total 

numbers of petroleum degraders per se  [49].  

An alternative to the plate technique for the estimation of hydrocarbon is the Most

Probable Number procedure, since it eliminates the need for a solidifying agent and allows the 

direct assessment of the ability to actually utilise hydrocarbons. It also has the advantage that the 

use of liquid media permits removal of trace organic contaminants and allows for the chemical 

definition of a medium with just a kind of hydrocarbon as carbon source. For these reasons, this 

technique allows to specifically count only hydrocarbon users as well as eliminate the problem of 

counting organism growing on other trace organic contaminants [50]. 

Although standard culture methods are adequate for the evaluation of the ability of 

indigenous bacteria to degrade contaminants, a significant problem of culture techniques is the 

fact that most (90-99 %) of the species making up competent degrading communities do not form 

colonies when laboratory-based culture techniques are used [51]. A way to avoid this problem is 

the use of molecular techniques for the analysis of the microbial communities that take part in in 

situ hydrocarbon biodegradation.  The most commonly used are the measurement of lipid 

biomarkers, specifically, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), together with nucleic acid-based 

molecular techniques for fingerprinting the 16S rRNA component of microbial cells, such as DGGE 

[52, 53].  

1.4 Surfactants  

Surfactants are a diverse group of compounds that are economically important due to 

their tensioactive properties. They are mainly known for being the most common ingredient of 

detergent formulations and their primary function is to modify the interface between two or 

more phases in order to promote the dispersion of one phase into another. Surfactants are able 

to concentrate at interfaces due to their amphiphilic character, resulting from the combination of 

hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties within the same molecule [54, 55]. Surfactants are 

generally characterized by properties such as the critical micelle concentration (CMC), chemical 

structure, charge, and in the case of biosurfactants, also by their source organism and the 

hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) [54]. 

The most common classification of chemical surfactants is according to the charge of their 

hydrophilic component: nonionic if the hydrophilic component is not ionized, anionic if the 

hydrophilic component comprises a negatively charged group, cationic if the hydrophilic 

component comprises a positively charged group, and amphoteric if the hydrophilic group 

contains both anionic and cationic characters [55].  



 
 
 
 
Introduction 

18 
 
 
 
 

A property of surfactants is their ability to form aggregate structures [54]. This 

characteristic is dependent on the concentration of the surface-active compounds until the CMC 

is obtained and will influence the surfactant activity [56].  Above the CMC the surfactant 

molecules aggregate to form micelles, bilayers and vesicles which lead to the reduction of the 

surface and interfacial tension and increase the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic 

organic compounds by partitioning the hydrophobic substrates and allowing closer cell-substrate 

interactions [57]. The aggregates may also fuse directly with microbial membranes resulting in 

direct substrate delivery [58]. However it is also possible that changes to the hydrophobicity of 

the cell surface my increase repulsion, [59], or the formation of micelles encapsulating the 

substrate may decrease bioavailability resulting in either reduction in toxicity or decreased 

bioavailability [60]. Therefore, the CMC of a surfactant is a commonly used characteristic to 

measure its efficiency [56]. Surfactants with lower CMC values are considered to be more efficient 

since less surfactant is needed to decrease the surface tension (Figure 4)[61].  

Micelle formation also has a significant role in microemulsion formation [62]. This is 

particularly important in oil bioremediation strategies since microemulsions are clear and stable 

liquid mixtures of water and oil phases separated by monolayer or aggregates of surfactants, 

which are formed when one liquid phase is dispersed as droplets in another liquid phase, for 

example oil dispersed in water [61]. 

The HLB is another property of surfactants used to assess their effectiveness. This 

parameter is used to judge if a surfactant is related to oil-in-water or to water-in-oil emulsions, 

and specifies the portion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents in surface-active substances

[56]. The HLB value also gives indication of the suitable applicability of a surfactant, making it 

useful information when planning bioremediation strategies. Surfactants with low HLB are 

lipophilic and stabilize water-in-oil emulsification, whereas surfactants with high HLB are 

hydrophilic and confer better water solubility [61, 63]. 

1.4.1 Bacterial biosurfactants 

There are several microorganisms that are able to synthesise a wide range of surface-

active compounds, generally called biosurfactants. Therefore, biosurfactants are molecules that 

possess the same characteristics of chemical surfactants but are produced by microorganisms. 

These compounds are mainly classified according to their molecular weight, physico-chemical 

properties and mode of action [56]. The low-molecular-weight biosurfactants (e.g. lipopeptides, 

glycolipids and proteins) reduce the surface tension at the air-water interfaces and the interfacial 

tension at oil-water interfaces, whereas the high-molecular-weight biosurfactants, also called 

bioemulsifiers (e.g. polymers of polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides proteins and lipoproteins) 

are more effective in establishing oil-in-water emulsions [64]. 

The best studied biosurfactants are the glycolipids, which include the rhamnolipids (Figure 

5), the trehalolipids, sophorolipids and mannosylerythriol lipids. These compounds contain mono- 

or disaccharides, combined with long-chain aliphatic acids or hydroxyaliphatic acids. It is also 

important to refer that the major producers of rhamnolipids belong to the Pseudomonas genus 

[64].  

In microorganisms, biosurfactants are naturally involved in microbial competitive 

interaction, cell-to-cell communications, plant and animal pathogenesis, increasing of 

bioavailability of surface-bound subtracts and heavy 

metals (via direct interfacial contact and 

pseudosolubilization), avoidance of toxic elements and 

compounds,  motility and biofilm formation and 

maintenance [54, 64]. Usually they are secondary 

metabolites, produced at the end of the log phase 

and/or stationary phase. 

When compared with synthetic surfactants, 

biosurfactants have several advantages, such as, higher 

rates of biodegradability, lower toxicity, better 

foaming properties and better stability at extreme pH,

salinity and temperature values [65-67]. However, despite all these environmentally favourable 

characteristics, their commercialisation has not yet been fully achieved, since its production costs 

cannot compete with those of the chemical surfactants [64]. 

1.4.2 Biosurfactants and oil bioremediation 

A possible application of biosurfactants is in the remediation of environmental 

contamination with organic compounds, such as hydrophobic hydrocarbons. In this case, due to 

the fact that the contaminant is hydrophobic, there is relatively little area of contact between the 

water phase and the oil phase. In these circumstances the addition of biosurfactants aims to 

increase the bioavailability of the hydrocarbons (biosurfactant-enhanced bioremediation) or the 

mobilisation and removal the contaminants by pseudosolubilization and emulsification in a 

washing treatment [35, 64]. Biosurfactant addition to contaminated sites may also increase 

substrate bioavailability by increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface of the cell allowing 

hydrophobic substrates to associate more easily with bacterial cells [68]. As mentioned before, 

the production of biosurfactants can be activated as a response of the microorganisms to the 

need to use water insoluble substrates. In these cases biosurfactant production is necessary for 

specific adhesion mechanisms to large oil drops or for the emulsification of oil, followed by the 

uptake of submicron oil droplets [69, 70]. These mechanisms are present in many oil-utilising 

microorganisms, which produce cell wall associated or extracellular surface-active agents, to 

facilitate the hydrocarbon uptake through the hydrophilic outer membrane [71]. Such agents are 

mainly low molecular weight compounds, such as fatty acids, triacylglycerols and 

phospholipids.[3, 72] Cultures of these bacteria become brown and turbid as the oil slick is 

transformed into many small oil droplets. Bacterial cells are associated on the surface of the 

droplets, and such contact may facilitate the assimilation of petroleum components into the cells 

[35]. 

Several studies and field trials have proved that the introduction of external surfactants in 

contaminated environments will influence the degradation rate of oil components [3]. However, 

while in some cases the effect is stimulatory [73-76], in others it has proven to be inhibitory or 

neutral [77, 78]. This, added to the fact that chemical dispersants have caused further ecological 

damage to the ecosystems after application for removal of spilled oil, makes the use of 

biosurfactants, which are less toxic and partially biodegradable, preferable to use in 

bioremediation strategies [23, 79].

1.5 Environmental matrixes as a seedbank for surfactant-

producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria 

1.5.1 The sea surface microlayer  

 The sea surface microlayer (SML) represents the interface between the ocean and the 

atmosphere, where the transfer of material is controlled by complex physicochemical processes. 

It is considered as the uppermost 1st mm of the water column, and presents distinct 

physicochemical properties compared with subsurface water. This interface can serve as a sink of 

anthropogenic compounds, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, due to its unique chemical 

composition, enriched in biogenic organic molecules, such as lipids, proteins and polysaccharides 

[80]. Because of the particular features of the SML, such as the presence of the surface film and 

the high surface tension, it is considered to be a unique habitat and the living communities that 

develop in this compartment of the water column are referred to as the neuston. Bacterial 

communities that are present in the surface microlayer are known as the bacterioneuston. These 

microorganisms are subjected to both favorable (e.g. high concentrations of organic and inorganic 

nutrients) and detrimental factors (e.g. intense UV radiation, high concentrations of heavy metals 

and organic pollutants, temperature and salinity fluctuations). As a result, the SML is considered 

to be an extreme environment for microorganisms, which explains the occurrence of unusual 

species and taxa. Some of the bacterial strains isolated from SML are Proteobacteria and 

Actinobacteria, and include genera such as Pseudomonas, Chromobacterium, Aeromonas and 

Micrococcus [81, 82].  

 In areas associated with anthropogenic coastal activities, particularly shipping harbors, it 

is common to find high levels of PAHs in SML water. Results of several studies lead to believe that 

the amount of PAHs in the SML in these sites is related to the size of the port and intensity of 

shipping traffic [83]. The main causes are related to the discharge of waste water form shipping 

(proximity of the contamination source) combined with limited water exchange in the harbor 

(restricted hydrodynamics) [84-86]. However, atmospheric deposition of combustion residues and 

biogenic sources may also lead to the enrichment of PAHs in the SML [83]. 

1.5.2 Rhizosphere environments 

Plant roots are known to have important effects on the structural diversity of bacterial 

communities inhabiting soil and sediment closely attached the roots (rhizosphere effect).[87]. The 

microorganisms present in rhizosphere communities may have negative, positive or neutral 



 
 
 
 
Introduction 

22 
 
 
 
 

effects on the plant, influencing its growth and health [88]. The accumulation of microorganisms 

in the rhizosphere is supported by root exudates which make the surrounding soil rich in sugars, 

amino acids, hormones, sugar alcohols, organic acids, vitamins, terpenoids, coumarins and 

flavonoids [89]. However these secretions may also lead to a decrease of certain microbes [87].  

On the other hand the microbial community present in the rhizosphere deeply influences the 

plant by decomposition, affecting nutrient uptake, antagonistic effects in other microorganism 

and parasitism [88].  

Microorganisms in the rhizosphere are mostly found in biofilms rather than in the 

planktonic state [90]. However, bacterial interactions, growth and formation of biofilms on the 

root and sediment surfaces have been shown to involve complex mechanisms [91] and in some 

cases it is connected to biosurfactant production [92, 93].  In the rhizosphere, biosurfactant 

production has also been associated with swarming motility, zoosporicidal and antifungical 

activities [93-95] . 

1.5.3 Bulk sediments environments 

Soil not directly influenced by root activity is referred as bulk sediment or soil [87]. Most 

of the microbial communities present in bulk sediments are also found in rhizosphere. However, 

since in most cases there are less nutrients available in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere, 

commonly bulk sediment communities have lower diversity and quantity of microorganisms [87, 

96]. Estuarine sediments in particular, are known sinks of contaminants [97], with petroleum 

hydrocarbons being the most common contaminants [98].  

Microorganisms in sediments are fundamental to diagenesis of organic matter. An 

important ability involved in such processes is their capacity to form biofilms, on thesurface of 

sediment particle [99]. As in rhizosphere, the formation of biofilms by bulk sediment bacteria is 

associated with the production of biosurfactants [100, 101].

1.6 Goals and strategy 

Bioremediation has proven to be an environmental friendly and economically feasible 

strategy for recuperation of oil contaminated ecosystems. However the application of this 

technique is often limited by the hydrophobicity of the contaminants, making them hard to be 

metabolized by the bacteria used. Hence, a possible solution for this problem would be the use of 

hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria, since the presence of surfactants help 

improve the hydrocarbons dispersal, solubilization and bioavailability.  

Thus, the main goal of this study was to assess the biotechnological potential of 

hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing bacteria isolated from the estuarine system of Ria 

de Aveiro (Portugal). Selective cultures of hydrophobic hydrocarbons were prepared to stimulate 

the growth of potential hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producing isolates, using three 

different carbon sources (Arabian light crude oil, maritime diesel and liquid paraffin) and three 

different environmental matrixes (SML water, bulk sediment and rhizosphere) from Ria de Aveiro. 

The communities established in the different selective cultures were characterized in terms of the 

concentration of CFU and compared in terms of structural diversity by analysis of 16S rRNA DGGE 

profiles. A set of isolates was retrieved, typed by BOX-PCR and tested for biosurfactants 

production by the atomized oil assay.

2.1 Characterization of the study area and sampling site 

Ria de Aveiro is a shallow estuary-coastal 

lagoon system, located in north Portugal at 

approximately 40.7° N, 8.7° W. The physical system 

is characterized by many branching channels that are 

connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single tidal 

channel [102].  

All samples were collected on the 25
th

 

October 2010 at a  sampling site (40°37’32.0952” N, 

8°44’9.2832” W) located at the east margin of Mira 

channel, one of the main branches of the estuarine 

system of Ria de Aveiro (Figure 6). The Barra salt 

marsh encompasses approximately 2.2 hectares of 

vegetated area [103] and is located in the proximity 

of the commercial port of Aveiro, and several smaller 

harbors used by leisure and fishing ships. Analysis of 

sediment samples (superficial horizon 0-5 cm) of this 

site have shown that it is mainly constituted by clay 

and has a mean value of organic matter of 9 % [104]. 

The most common salt-marsh vegetation species 

found at this site are Halimione portulacoides (L.) 

Aellen, Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) A.J. Scott subsp. 

perennis, Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods, Juncus 

maritimus Lam. and Limonium vulgare Miller [105]. 

The rhizosphere of H. portulacoides harbors a dense 

bacterial community, because this particular micro-

habitat is thought to favorably meet bacterial 

requirements in terms of the availability of labile 

organic compounds [106]. Colonized sediments of the 

Ria de Aveiro are richer in fine particles and in inorganic nutrients, namely nitrogen and

phosphorus, than the nonvegetated area [102], which can provide for the main limiting nutrients 

for hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. 

2.2 Sampling 

2.2.1 Sea surface microlayer (SML) 

The SML sample was collected according to an adaptation of the glass plate method [107]. 

For that, a plexiglas plate was disinfected with ethanol (70 %), rinsed with sterilized dH2O and 

finally repeatedly immerse in water from the sampling site, immediately before the sampling. For 

collection of the SML, the plate was slowly submerged in an upright position, slowly removed in 

the same position (Figure 7-A). After allowing the plate to drip for 5 seconds, the water adhering 

to both surfaces was removed by forcing the plate between two Teflon wiper blades and 

collecting the water in sterilized glass bottles (Figure 7-B). This process was repeated several 

times until approximately 50 mL of SML water was collected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.2.2 Sediment 

 The sediment sample was obtained by scraping the upper 3 cm of unvegetated sediments 

at the lower limit of the intertidal area at the margin of Mira Channel with a sterilized spatula. The

sediments were transferred to sterilized plastic bags and brought to the laboratory in isothermal 

boxes.  

A previous study has determined that the sediment used present a water content of    

17.3 % in relation to sediment fresh weight and has classified the sediment as very fine silt sand 

with the fraction of fine particles corresponding to 35.2 % of the sediment dry weight [108]. 

2.2.3 Rhizosphere  

 Rhizosphere samples were obtained from a monospecific stand of the halophyte plant 

Halimione portulacoides.  Intact plant specimens were collected and the excess sediment was 

gently removed in the field. The plants were transferred to sterilized plastic bags and brought to 

the laboratory in isothermal boxes.  

 Oliveira et al. [108] determined that the sediment of Halimione portulacoides banks 

present at 3-4 cm a water content of 22.2 % for the month of September. In the same study the 

sediment was classified as mud with the fraction of fine particles corresponding to 94.8 % of the 

sediment dry weight. 

2.3 Extraction of microbial cells from the environmental matrixes 

In the laboratory, the roots of Halimione portulacoides specimens were carefully washed 

with distilled water in order to remove the loosely attached sediment. After washing, the roots 

were cut in 2-4 cm fragments with the aid of sterilized scissors and forceps. 

For the extraction of microbial cells, sub-samples of 5 g of sediment or 5 g of root were 

placed in Erlenmeyers with 45 mL of extraction solution (0,1 % Tween 80, Merck; and 0,1 % 

sodium pyrophosphate) and  5 g of glass beads (4 mm diameter). The suspensions were placed on 

a shaker incubator (model SI4-2, Shel Lab, U.S.A.) for 5 min at 100 rpm. After the agitation, 

particles were allowed to settle for 1 min. and the  supernatant was used as inoculum [109].  

The water of the SML did not suffer any process for extraction of microbial cells and was 

directly used as inoculum.   

2.4 Culture media  

Mineral Salts Medium (MSM), was obtained from a Base Mineral Medium (BMM, [110])

otherwise indicated. For liquid cultures, MSM was prepared without agarose. 

2.5 Carbon sources 

For this work, three hydrocarbon-rich carbon sources were tested: liquid paraffin (Merck), 

light Arabian crude oil and maritime diesel. Before being added to the mineral medium, the 

carbon sources were sterilized. by the following methods: paraffin was autoclaved for 20 min at 

121 °C; a small volume of Arabian light crude oil was transferred to a petri dish in order to obtain 

a thin layer that was exposed to UV radiation for 4 hours; maritime diesel was sterilized by 

vacuum filtration at 300 mmHg using PTFE membranes with Ø 0.2 µm pore size. 

2.6 Selective cultures with hydrocarbons  

To select for biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, hydrophobic carbon 

sources were used in the selective cultures using the different environmental inocula (Table 3). 

The cultures were prepared in sterile erlenmeyers by adding 1 mL (1 %) of the sterilized carbon 

source and 5 mL (5 %) inoculum (SML water or sediment/rhizosphere cell suspensions) to 94 mL 

of liquid MSM. The nine cultures were incubated in an orbital incubator at 26 °C and 130 rpm for 

2 months. At the end of the incubation, sub-samples of each culture were transferred to 50 mL 

Falcon tubes and preserved at -16 °C for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis.

2.7 Colony forming units (CFUs) 

Starting from the third week, the concentration of viable bacteria was assessed by the 

number of CFUs in non selective medium. Weekly, 100 µL of each culture were serially diluted in 

Ringer solution and aliquots of 100 µL of the appropriate dilution range were spread plated in 

triplicate in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates (Merck; 15 g/L casein peptone, 5 g/L soy peptone, 5 g/L 

NaCl, 15 g/L agar; pH 7.3±0.2) containing 0.1 g/L cicloheximide (VWR) to restrain the growth of 

fungi. The cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 2 days, after which the colonies were counted and 

the concentration of CFUs was estimated from the average counts in the most suitable dilution 

and corrected for the dilution factor.   

Statistical tests were performed using SPSS v15.0. Differences between the CFUs mL
-1

 

results obtained between the various carbon sources and matrixes through time were analyzed by 

two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Sphericity of the data was evaluated by the Mauchly's 

sphericity test. If the data met this criteria (p?0.05) it was directly subjected to parametric 

analysis of variances with Bonferroni adjustments, if not (p?0.05) Greenhouse-Geisser correction 

was used.  

2.8 Isolation and purification of bacterial strains 

Every week, during the 2 months incubation period of the selective cultures, 3 replicates 

of 100 µL of each culture were serially diluted in Ringer solution and spread-plated on solid MSM 

on which 50 µL of the corresponding carbon source had been previously spread. The plates were 

incubated at 25 °C for 2 weeks. From the plates of the most convenient dilutions of each 

combination of carbon source and environmental matrix, isolated colonies were selected based 

on morphology and color. For further isolation and purification, the selected colonies were streak 

plated in solid MSM amended with the corresponding carbon source. The plates were then 

incubated at room temperature (approx. 25 °C) for a week and the purification by streak platting 

was repeated 3 times. Isolates were then inoculated with a sterile loop in liquid MSM medium 

with 1 % of the respective carbon source. When the purity of the isolates was confirmed by 

optical microscopy after gram staining, the cultures were frozen with glycerol (15 %; AppliChem) 

and kept at 4 °C until processing.

2.9 Denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) 

2.9.1 DNA extraction of selective cultures 

Total DNA was extracted from the 2-month selective cultures according to the protocol 

described by Costa et al. [111]. A total volume of 10 mL of each of the selective was centrifuged at 

13,300 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was ressuspended in 500 µL of ethanol 96 %, mixed in the vortex 

and then transferred to Fast Prep tubes containing a mixture of beads with different diameters. 

The bead mixture was composed by 0.1 g of each kind of the following beads:  0.75-1.0 mm, 0.1 

mm, 0.25-0.5 mm and 2.85-3.45 mm glassbeads; and 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads. Previous to 

their use the glass beads were washed in the Fast Prep tubes. This consisted in covering the beads 

in the tubes with HCl solution (5.8 mM), mixing it well and incubating at room temperature for 1 

hour, with occasional agitation. The HCl solution was then removed with a micropipette and 

sterile dH2O was added to cover the beads. The beads were washed by agitating the tube for 30 s 

and dH2O was removed. The washing procedure was repeated 4 times. Finally the tubes were 

slightly opened and placed in an incubator at 65 °C overnight to dry. For the extraction, the tubes 

containing the bead mixture and the samples were agitated for 2 consecutive periods of 30 

seconds in the FastPrep FP120 bead beating system (Qbiogene, USA) at 5.5 m/s. 

The suspensions were then transferred to new microtubes and centrifuged at 13,300 rpm 

for 5 min. The supernatants were discarded and 1.2 mL of extraction buffer (100 mM sodium 

phosphate [pH 7.0], 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0], 100 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 1.5 M NaCl, 1 % CTAB and 

2 % SDS [112]) was added to the pellet. The mixture was gently homogenized then incubated at 

65 °C for 30 min. After a new centrifugation at 13,300 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were 

transferred to new tubes containing 1 mL of 21:1 chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution. The tubes 

were carefully mixed and then centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The resulting aqueous phase 

was then transferred to a new microtube containing 0.6 % isopropanol (vol/vol) and incubated for 

30 min at room temperature. After a final centrifugation at 13,300 rpm for 5 min, the resulting 

pellet of nucleic acids was washed twice with 0.5 mL 70 % cold ethanol and then air dried. The 

pellet was resuspended in 40 µL of TE buffer (10 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1mM EDTA.Na2, pH 

8) and stored at - 20 °C. All centrifugations were performed on a Heraeus Pico 17 centrifuge 

(Thermo Scientific).

2.9.2 PCR-amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments 

For PCR-amplification of the 16S rRNA gene fragments of the community DNA extracted 

from the selective cultures the primers U27F (5´-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3´) and 1492R (5´-

GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3´) [113] synthesized by IBA (IBA GmbH, Germany) were used. The 

composition of the reaction mixture (25 µL) was 1 µL of sample, 12.5 µL DreamTaq™ PCR Master 

Mix (Fermentas), 0.25 µL of each primer, 1.25 µL BSA (2 g L
-1

; Sigma) and 9.75 µL dH2O. The PCR 

cycle was composed by 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 25 thermal cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 

56 °C, and 1.5
 
min at 72 °C, and a final extension step

 
at 72 °C for 10 min. 

The PCR products were then submitted to nested PCR. The Bacteria domain specific 

primers used in the second PCR  are 968F -GC (5´-CGC CCG GGG CGC GCC CCG GGC GGG GCG GGG 

GCA CGG GGG GAA CGC GAA GAA CCT TAC-3´) and 1401R (5´-CGG TGT GTA CAA GAC CC-3´) [114] 

synthesized by IBA (IBA GmbH, Germany). The reaction mixtures had a total of 25 µL and were 

made of 0.5 µL sample, 12.5 µL DreamTaq™ PCR Master Mix (Fermentas), 0.5 µL of each primer, 

2.0 µL acetamide (Fluka) and 9.0 µL dH2O. For the second PCR reaction, the denaturation step 

took 4 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 thermal cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, and 2 min at 

72 °C, and finally an extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR reactions were conducted in a 

MultiGene Gradient Thermal Cycler (MIDSCI). 

The success of the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene fragments was verified by agarose 

(Gentaur) gel (1.8 %) electrophoresis, with 5.3x10
-6

 % (vol/vol) GelRed (Biotium) as DNA staining 

agent, at 80 V for 30 min in 1x TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; Fluka; pH 8.0). The 

presence of bands was visualized in a UV transiluminator (Benchtop UV). 

2.9.3 DGGE run and analysis 

DGGE was performed with the DCode System (C.B.S. Scientific). PCR products containing 

approximately equal amounts of DNA were loaded onto 6-9 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 1xTAE 

buffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; Fluka; pH 8.0). The 6-9 % polyacrilamide gel 

(bisacrylamide:acrylamide = 37.5:1) was made with a denaturing gradient ranging from 32 to      

60 %. Electrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 150 V at 60 °C in 1 x TAE buffer. Following 

electrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained [115]. Briefly, gels were fixed with 0.1 % (v/v) ethanol 

plus 0.005 % acetic acid (Merck), stained with 0.3 g AgNO3 (Merck) and developed with 0.003 % 

(v/v) formaldehyde (Merck) and 0.33 % Na OH (9 %)(Merck). A 0.75 % Na2CO3 (Fluka) solution was 

used to stop the development.

The bands with higher intensity or that were present in several lanes of different samples 

were cut from the gel and stored in microtubes at -20 °C for later cloning and identification. 

The profiles obtained were analyzed with GelCompar 4.0 software (Applied Maths, 

Belgium). The bands occupying the same position in the different lanes of the gels were identified. 

A binary (1/0) matrix was constructed taking into account the presence or absence of individual 

bands in each lane. Cluster analysis was performed using PRIMER v5 software (Primer-e, UK). The 

binary matrix was transformed into a similarity matrix (dendrogram) using the Bray Curtis 

measure. In order to compare the diversity between the different selective cultures, the 

Shannon–Weaver diversity index (H) was calculated as follows: H=??(pi) (log2pi), where i 

represents all the unique bands and pi is the relative abundance of band i [116] using software 

PRIMER v5.  

2.10 Molecular typing of the isolates by BOX-PCR 

2.10.1 DNA extraction of bacterial isolates 

Aliquots of  glycerol-amended frozen cultures were used to inoculate 1 mL of TSB (Merck) 

in a microtube, which was incubated overnight at 26 °C in an orbital shaker (model SI4-2, Shel 

Lab), at 120 rpm. The procedure for DNA extraction was based in the protocol described by 

Henriques et al. [117]. 500 µL of culture was transferred to new microtubes and centrifuged at 

13,300 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 100 µL of TE 

buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6-8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and 50 µL of 30 g L
-1

 lysozyme solution (Roche).  

After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, 50 µL of lyse solution (Genomic DNA Purification Kit, 

Fermentas) was added. The mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and after this period 20 µL 

of SDS 25 % was added. The mixture was further incubated at 65 °C for 10 min more after which 

50 µL of 5 M NaCl was added. The mixture was agitated in the vortex at maximum speed for one 

minute and 200 µL of chloroform was added. The mixture was homogenized by repeated 

inversion of the tubes and then centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then 

carefully pipetted to new microtubes in which 100 µL of isopropyl alcohol was added and then 

mixed by inversion. Finally the mixture was centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min and 100 µL of 

cold ethanol 96 % was added and mixed by inversion. After an incubation of 15 min at 4 °C the 

mixture was again centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the 

DNA-RNA pellet was washed with 100 µL of ethanol 70 %.  The reaction mixture was allowed to 

settle for 1 min and again centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and

the microtubes were open so that the pellet could dry at room temperature. Finally the DNA-RNA 

pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of TE buffer and the microtubes were kept at -20 °C. All 

centrifugations were performed on a Heraeus Pico 17 centrifuge (Thermo Scientific). 

2.10.2 BOX-PCR procedures and analysis 

BOX-PCR was conducted in order to identify isolates with similar genotypes and to group 

them in clones according to their similarity in order to spot suitable representatives for 

identification, thus reducing the DNA sequencing effort. The PCR mix used was composed of  

13.25 µL dH2O, 2.5 µL KCl buffer 10x, 2.5 µL dUTPs, 3.75 µL MgCl2, 1,25 µL DMSO, 0.25 µL Taq 

polymerase, 0.5 µL primer  BOX A1R (5’-CTA CGG CAA GGC GAC GCT GAC G-3’) and 1.00 µL 

template for 25.00 µL of reaction (all reagents from Fermentas). The cycling conditions used 

included a denaturation step of 7 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 thermal cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 

min at 53 °C, and 8 min at 65 °C, and finally an extension step at 65 °C for 16 min. PCR was 

conducted in a MyCycler Thermal Cycler (BioRad). The PCR products were stored at -20 °C. 

The PCR products were then run in agarose (Gentaur) gel (1.5 %) electrophoresis, with 

5.3x10
-6

 % (vol/vol) GelRed (Biotium), at 80 V for 3h in TAE buffer 1x (5Prime). The profiles were 

visualized in a UV transiluminator (Benchtop UV) and were photographed using a Canon 

Powershot G10. The profiles obtained were analyzed with GelCompar 4.0 software (Applied 

Maths, Belgium). A dendrogram relating all isolates was generated by clustering correlation using 

the UPGMA method with fine alignment. 

2.11 Analysis of biosurfactant production  

The isolates were tested as to their capacity to produce biosurfactants by the atomized oil 

assay [118]. This technique has proven to be more sensitive to lower amounts of biosurfactants 

than the commonly used drop-collapse method [118], and has also the advantage of allowing a 

quick screening of a high number of isolates. 

The isolates used were initially in liquid selective cultures (MSM with 1 % of the respective 

carbon source). Not all isolates grown in liquid selective cultures were considered to be pure by 

gram staining, and therefore due to time limiting factors and so that a more comprehensive 

analysis of the production of biosurfactants was conducted, the isolates that were grown in non-

selective TSB for the BOX-PCR analysis were also tested.  As such some isolates were tested twice, 

from the rich medium and from the selective culture, so that a preliminary study of the 

preference for rich or selective media for the production of biosurfactants by the bacteria could 



 
 
 
 
Material and Methods 

36 
 
 
 
 

be conducted. However for the calculus of the biosurfactant producers percentage all replicas of 

an isolate were counted as one. With the aid of a sterilized toothpick, the isolates were spotted 

on plates of Luria Bertani (LB) agar (10 g/L tryptone, Merck, 5 g/L yeast extract, Merck, 10 g/L 

NaCl, AppliChem, and 15 g/L agar, Liofilchem; pH 7.0 ± 0.2) and incubated overnight at 28 °C. 

Escherichia coli DH5? was used as a negative control [118] and solutions of commercial 

surfactants were used as positive controls:  0.008 mM Tween 80 (Merck), 10 mM SDS (BioRad), 

and 1.19 g L
-1

 surfactin (Sigma). Aliquots of 2 µL of each surfactant solution were spotted on the 

surface of the LB agar plates. The analysis was performed by using an airbrush (model BD-128P, 

Fengda, China) to nebulize liquid paraffin (Merck) at a constant range over the inoculated LB agar 

plates. The presence of biosurfactants was detected by the immediate appearance of a halo 

surrounding the colony, visualized under indirect bright light.

3.1 Selective cultures with hydrophobic substrates 

Nine different selective cultures were prepared with varying carbon sources and inocula. 

The original appearance of the liquid cultures was of an aqueous phase in the bottom and a very 

thin organic phase consisting of the hydrophobic substrate added as carbon source at the surface. 

During the course of the incubation, the organic phase became less distinct and the aqueous 

phase became turbid, especially in the crude and paraffin cultures (Figure 8). 

 

Figure 8 – Selective cultures using hydrocarbon–rich substrates as hydrophobic carbon sources, (A) 
maritime diesel, (B) Arabian light crude oil, and (C) liquid paraffin, were used for isolation of biosurfactants 
producing bacteria inhabiting SML water (a), bulk sediment (s) and rhizosphere (r), after 2 months of 

incubation at 130 rpm at 26°C.

3.2 Bacterial abundance of selective cultures  

The variation of the concentration of CFU/mL in the selective cultures from week 3 until 

the end of the incubation are represented in Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11. 

The selective culture with highest overall concentration of CFUs throughout the 

incubation period was the CS culture (average of 2,77x10
8
 CFU mL

-1
), and the lowest was found in 

the DR culture (average of 1,73x10
7
 CFU mL

-1
). Through statistical tests (two-way repeated 

measures ANOVA) all crude, diesel and paraffin cultures with different matrixes were shown to be 

significantly different between themselves (p&lt;0.05) except between CA and CR and PS and PR 

(p&gt;0.05).   In the crude cultures (Figure 9) the number of CFUs showed a tendency to decline over 

time, while in the diesel cultures (Figure 10) a relatively constant level of CFUs was maintained in 

the last 4 weeks, and in the paraffin selective cultures (Figure 11), with the exception of PS, a 

slight tendency of the CFUs values to increase was observed in the last weeks.  

All rhizosphere cultures (Figures 9, 10 and 11) have the lowest CFUs values, although in a 

relatively steady level throughout the incubation period. Statistical tests have shown that there is 

no significative difference between CR and PR regarding bacterial abundance (p &gt;0.05). Bulk 

sediment and SML water selective cultures present similar levels of CFUs except for the cultures 

with crude as carbon source in which the sediment culture had significantly higher CFU 

concentration. Statistical tests have found all sediment cultures to be significativily different 

among themselves regarding bacterial abundance (p&lt;0.05), as well as the SML water cultures 

except between PA and DA (p &gt;0.05). Bulk sediment selective cultures and SML water showed 

high CFU concentration in the first weeks and a steep decrease, followed by a relative stabilization 

in the later weeks of the incubation period, except for the PS and CA cultures. Post hoc tests 

confirmed this results showing that at the third week bulk sediment cultures presented 

significativily higher bacterial abundance than at the fifth week (p&lt;0.05). The SML water cultures 

also presents significativily higher CFU values for the fifth week in comparison to the last three 

weeks (p&lt;0.05).

suitable dilution and the error bars represent the standard deviation. 

 

3.3 Isolation and purification of colonies 

Having in consideration the different carbon source used, morphology and color of the 

colonies in selective medium, an initial set of 111 isolates was collected during the 2 months of 

incubation of the 9 selective cultures. Later, the 111 isolates were inoculated in liquid selective 

media only 32 could be maintained and kept pure in selective media. From the remaining that 

were found to be contaminated or extremely slow-growing in selective media, an additional set of 

34 isolates could be retrieved from the non-selective TSB cultures used for the BOX-PCR analysis. 

Finally a set of 66 isolates was achieved. During the isolation and purification procedures some 

isolates obtained from the crude selective culture produced colonies surrounded by a clearance 

zone  when grown on crude-amended solid medium (Figure 12).

The DGGE profiles obtained from the separation of products of amplification of 16s rRNA 

gene fragments of the different environmental matrices used as inocula are displayed in Figure

The dendrogram generated with the software PRIMER v5 from the DGGE profiles is 

presented in Figure 14.  

Two crude cultures (CA and CR) show a degree of similarity of approximately 40% and 

present little similarity with other samples. There are also two paraffin cultures (PR and PA) with a 

degree of similarity of approximately 60 %. In other cultures, there was not enhanced similarity in 

cultures with the same carbon source. Two sediment cultures (DS and PS) presented a similarity 

of a little over 60 % although amended with different carbon sources. The SML cultures were little 

similar among them, while all the sediment cultures share a minimum of 50 % similarity.

With the same data (number and position of bands representing different ribotypes) the 

Shannon-Weaver index of diversity was calculated for each selective culture (Table 4). The highest 

diversity was found in the selective culture of SML water containing paraffin as carbon source 

(PA). The average Shannon-Weaver index average is 2.5231 for the paraffin cultures, 2.2509 for 

crude cultures and 1.6727 for diesel cultures. Averaging by inoculum type, the Shannon-Weaver 

index of diversity is 2.3581 for bulk sediment, 2.2877 for SML water, and 1.8248 for rhizosphere.

3.5 Genetic typing of the isolates by BOX-PCR 

Genetic typing of the subset of 66 isolates resulted in the formation of 59 different 

genotypes (Figure 15). The isolate 36 was used a positive control through different 

electrophoresis gels. Since the similarity of the controls (isolate 36) is 90 % at the minimum, a 

cutoff of approximately 90 % was assumed as the threshold for identical strains. Five clusters of 

isolates with more than 90 % similarity (approx.) were identified. 

3.6 Screening of the isolates for biosurfactant production 

From the 111 isolates acquired through isolation and purification in MSM solid medium 

only the remaining 32 pure isolates in liquid selective medium and the 66 isolates in TSB used in 

BOX, were tested for the production of biosurfactants. Of these two groups there is an 

intersection of 32 isolates and in total 66 different isolates were tested.    

Of the 66 overall isolates tested with the atomized oil assay 17 were positive (25.8 %) for 

the production of biosurfactants. Since the aim of this test is to identify biosurfactant producers, 

the isolates that produced biosurfactants in one medium but not in the other were counted in the 

overall percentage as biosurfactant producers, that is, as a positive result. Those that presented 

just negative or positive results in both media were counted just once. From the total of 66 

different isolates tested, 4 positive results came from both media, 5 from the TSA medium and 11 

from the MSM subset.

In the subset of 32 isolates tested from both media 5 isolates from the TSA medium had 

positive results (15.6 %) while from the MSM isolates 11 were positive (34.4 %). 4 isolates were 

positive independently of the medium of origin. 

The percentages of positive results by carbon sources and ambient matrixes are 

presented in Table 5 . Considering the total percentages, the highest frequency of biosurfactants 

producing strains was observed in SML isolates and the lowest in isolates from the sediment 

cultures. Comparing the different carbon sources, biosurfactants production was more frequent 

in the subset of isolates obtained from the diesel cultures and less frequent among strains 

isolated from paraffin amended cultures.

4.1 Selective cultures with hydrocarbons as hydrophobic carbon 

sources 

Hydrocarbons have shown good results when used as subtracts for the selection and 

isolation of biosurfactant producing microorganisms [119]. For this reason, petroleum 

hydrocarbons were chosen as substrates for the selective cultures, since the aim of this work was 

to isolate biosurfactant producing bacteria. Additionally petroleum hydrocarbons were also 

chosen, instead of other hydrophobic hydrocarbons, such as frying oils, so that these isolates 

could also have high potential in hydrocarbon remediation strategies. 

After 2 months of incubation, the visual appearance of the selective cultures had changed 

from a biphasic suspension to a turbid culture medium without a clear separation between the 

hydrophobic and the hydrophilic phases. This was interpreted as a first indication of the presence 

of bioemulsifiers in the cultures, produced by the enriched bacterial populations, that reduced the 

interfacial tension between the two immiscible liquids [55]. Similar effects have been found in 

other hydrocarbon selective cultures with biosurfactant producing strains [120-122]. The 

emulsification effect has been interpreted as an increase of bioavailability of petroleum 

hydrocarbons which would be favorable to bioremediation strategies at sea [35].  

The emulsification effect was particularly visible in the crude selective cultures and was 

very clearly observed in the isolation cultures in solid media. The emulsification of the 

hydrophobic substrate, that in this case was crude, may have caused the halo effect that was 

observed around isolated colonies. Also, some crude biodegradation may have occurred in the 

liquid selective cultures, as well as in the solid isolation cultures, because the hydrocarbon-rich 

substrate was provided as sole-carbon source selecting for hydrocarbonoclastic microbes.    

4.2 Effect of the selective media on bacterial communities 

4.2.1 Culturability 

One of the objectives of this work was to select for the most suitable medium for the 

isolation of biosurfactant producing hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria from different environmental 

matrices. For that, a mineral medium was amended with one of 3 distinct carbon sources that 

were hydrophobic, selecting for biosurfactants producers, and rich in hydrocarbons, selecting for

microbes capable of using hydrocarbons as carbon sources. Fungi are a relevant component of 

the hydrocarbon-degrading microflora in the environment and to restrain their growth, 

cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms, was added to the 

selective cultures.  The colony counts (CFU) in non-selective media were used as an approach to 

determine the size of the community and not to the proportion of target organisms 

(hydrocarbonoclastic-biosurfactant producers) because the later may profit from the degradative 

activity of a few specialists, establishing complex syntrophic relations between community 

members[123]. Also, hydrocarbons can be toxic to non-degrading microorganism and the 

variation of the community size in the selective cultures ultimately reflects the balance between 

inhibitory and stimulatory effects of the different populations that compose each community 

[45]. The variation of the number of colony forming units from the third week to the end of the 

incubation, globally showed that the response of the culturable fraction depends on the origin of 

the inoculum and also on the carbon source provided.   

On average, the sediment inoculum produced the highest CFU counts, and the maximum 

was observed in the selective medium containing crude. In diesel cultures, there was a steep 

decrease during the first 5 weeks and the counts remained low to the end of the incubation and in 

paraffin, counts were always low and stable. This may be related to the richness and diversity of 

carbon sources found in crude versus the less complex composition of diesel [4]. The cultures in 

which bulk sediment was used as inoculum also showed the highest average value for Shannon-

Weaver index calculated from the DGGE profiles. Sediment bacterial communities are generally 

considered as highly diverse both in terms of community structure and physiological potential, 

with the capacity of using a wide range of carbon sources [124, 125].  

Although rhizosphere microbial communities are usually considered to be more diverse 

than the communities from unvegetated sediments [106], in this case, they were probably more 

adapted to the use of root-derived carbon sources and could not use crude as efficiently as the 

more eclectic community from bulk sediments. The culturable fraction of the communities in the 

rhizosphere selective cultures was quite stable during the incubation period, with only a slight 

decrease of colony counts in the crude selective culture, towards the end of the incubation period 

indicating that these communities was less responsive to the selective pressure than bulk 

sediment or SML bacterial communities.  

The SML micro-environment is considered to be enriched in hydrophobic substrates, 

namely some pollutants such as hydrocarbons [126]. Additionally, biosurfactant production is 

considered a widespread adaptation of bacterioneuston to the interfacial conditions of this

particular compartment of the water column [81]. After 3 weeks of incubation, the concentration 

of CFU in the cultures inoculated with SML water was still very high in the diesel and paraffin 

selective cultures. From the forth week on, there was a decrease in CFU in all the selective 

cultures using SML inocula but at the end of the incubation, the concentration of CFU was slightly 

higher in the paraffin selective cultures, in relation to the cultures with other carbon sources. 

The general trend was a decrease in CFU in all selective cultures during the course of the 

incubation, which may be interpreted as a toxic effect or as a depletion of nutrients because of 

insufficient hydrocarbon utilization in relation to the carbon demand of the community. However, 

the least stressing conditions as inferred from the higher CFU values at the end of the incubation 

were obtained in paraffin medium for the SML and the rhizosphere inocula and in crude medium 

with the bulk sediment inoculum. 

4.2.2 Structural diversity 

The relative diversity of the bacterial communities developing in the different selective 

cultures at the end of the incubation was determined using the data obtained from the analysis of 

the DGGE profiles. Because the imposition of a strong selective pressure, such as the availability 

of a sole carbon source, could shape different communities in a convergent direction, the 

dendrogram was analyzed to check the closest (structurally more similar) communities. With the 

exception of all the paraffin amended cultures the crude-selective cultures of SML water and 

rhizosphere bacteria (CR and CA), there was not an enhanced similarity between communities 

forced to use the same carbon source. On the other hand, bulk sediment cultures with different 

carbon sources (DS and PS) were more similar between each other than with cultures initiated 

from different inocula but amended with the same carbon source. A similar effect occurred in the 

DR and PR cultures. The results show that paraffin has a stronger effect in the shaping of 

microbial communities and that this effect imposes on the initial community structure, in the 

sense that, different communities became more similar after selective incubation in paraffin 

medium. This may indicate an active adaptation of the community to a simpler carbon source. On 

the contrary, diesel and crude do not exert the same degree of control over the structure of 

sediment and rhizosphere bacterial communities. The SML community seems to be extremely 

responsive to the carbon source with very low similarity between communities challenged with 

different carbon sources (DA, PA and CA). Studies have shown that blooms of specialized bacteria 

tend to appear in contaminated areas of the SML [31], which could explain the low similarity 

between cultures of the SML with different carbon sources.  



 
 
 
 
Discussion 

54 
 
 
 
 

The estimated values for the Shannon-Weaver index indicate that the PA selective 

cultures were the more diverse and that DR was the least diverse. These results are in line with 

the information extracted from the analysis of the dendrogram and confirm the high physiological 

diversity of bacterioneuston and the susceptibility of rhizosphere communities to convergent 

adaptation and reduction of diversity in response to the carbon source. The fact that SML-paraffin 

selective culture exhibited the highest biodiversity is probably also the result of higher 

biodegradability of paraffin, comparatively to more complex hydrocarbons. Since the structure of 

paraffins consist in long open chains of exclusive single bonds, while other more complex 

hydrocarbons present in diesel and crude often have double bonds or cyclic structures making 

them much less biodegradable [4].  The average values (3 cultures) for the Shannon-Weaver index 

for each carbon source was higher for paraffin cultures (2.5331) than for crude (2.2509) or for 

diesel cultures (1.6726). This supports the hypothesis that paraffin is a more accessible substrate 

thus causing a smaller impact on the community diversity. The SML is generally considered as an 

extreme environment for microbial life from the physical and chemical perspectives where 

bacteria are adapted to respond to very sharp variations of  environmental conditions [81]. The 

results may also indicate the higher degree of physiological redundancy of bacterioneuston, with 

different species adapted for the performance of similar ecological functions, in contrast with 

sediment bacterial communities in which a particular function may be conducted by a narrower 

range of physiological specialists.   

 The two communities with lowest Shannon-Weaver index correspond to the diesel 

selective cultures (DA and DR).  This is probably due to the lack of diversity of petroleum 

compounds in the maritime diesel used, their low biodegradability, and the presence of some 

toxic molecules such as phenols and sulphur compounds [4, 127]. 

4.3 Hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial isolates 

The fact that SML is a microenvironment where several kinds of chemical compounds, 

from surfactants to hydrophobic molecules accumulate [128], especially in semi-closed aquatic 

environments like estuarine systems and in close proximity to harbors and urban areas [83], 

makes it a prime place to find a high diversity of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. The main objective 

of this work was the search for biosurfactants producing bacteria but the option to use 

hydrocarbons as hydrophobic carbon sources also aimed the selection for hydrocarbon degrading 

bacteria.  



 
 
 
 
   Discussion 
  

55 
 
 
 

 

By making a pre selection of isolates with different colony morphology and color, matrix 

of origin and carbon source used, we expected to obtain a set of the culturable fractions 

representative of the bacterial communities in each selective medium. After selection by such 

criteria, 111 isolates were cultivated and stored for further studies although only a sub-set of 66 

isolates was actually typed by BOX-PCR for later DNA sequencing and screened for biosurfactants 

production. BOX-PCR results lead to a high number (58) of genetically different strains. Therefore 

it should be safe to assume that the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro has a diverse community of 

potential biosurfactant producers and oil hydrocarbon degraders. 

The largest subset of isolates was obtained from the crude selective cultures. This is 

probably due to the fact that crude oil is an extremely complex mixture of several kinds of 

hydrocarbons, and since each bacterial strain is only able to degrade up to two or three kinds of 

hydrocarbons compounds [22], a wider range of macroscopically different specialized strains is 

involved and a higher diversity of colonies was observed. Both the diesel and the liquid paraffin 

are much less complex mixtures with paraffin being much more easily degradable than some of 

the diesel compounds (some of them aromatic) due to its chemical structure. 

The rhizosphere sediment was the inoculum that produced the larger number of 

macroscopically different colonies, rather than the SML water as one could anticipate from the 

values of the Shannon-Weaver index and because of the documented adaptation of 

bacterioneuston to elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons at the SML [81]. However because 

the selection of colonies was based on their macroscopic characteristics, it is possible that the 

genetic diversity of bacterioneuston was highly underestimated in the selection process. 

Although the capacity for hydrocarbon degradation was not directly verified in the 

isolated strains, some of them were able to clear crude from the solid MSM plates. As previously 

referred, the clear zone around some of the colonies may be produced by processes of 

hydrocarbon solubilization by biosurfactants (removal and dispersion), hydrocarbon 

biodegradation (mineralization), or by a combination of both processes. Some of the isolates that 

produced halos in the MSM plates amended with crude tested positive for the production of 

biosurfactants by the atomized oil assay.  However, the assessment of their potential for 

degradation of oil hydrocarbons still needs to be accessed.

4.4 Biosurfactant production  

Of the initial set of 111 isolates, 66 were tested for the production of biosurfactants with 

the atomized oil assay [118], and from these, 17 (25.8 %) formed a halo surrounding the colonies 

characteristic of the presence of biosurfactant. The final number of 66 isolates tested resulted 

from the combination of the analysis of 32 isolates originated directly from selective pure cultures 

and 66 isolates from pure cultures in non-selective medium (TSB). 

A subset of 32 of the isolates were tested from both the selective and non-selective media 

and the results confirm the influence of the culture medium on the production of biosurfactants 

as detected by the atomized oil assay conducted in LB colonies. Seven isolates were able to 

produce biosurfactants only when they had originated from the selective medium and not from 

TSA cultures. On the contrary, only 1 isolate was able to produce biosurfactant after cultivation in 

non-selective medium and not when tested directly from the selective medium. In 4 isolates 

biosurfactants production was detected in both selective and non-selective cultures and in 20 

isolates, biosurfactants production was not detected. Some studies show that biosurfactant 

production can be enhanced by rich media [129, 130] while other studies use more complex 

carbon sources, such as PAHs [73, 131], which may explain the differences in biosurfactant 

production by the same isolates when transitionally cultivated in different media [132]. 

Similar percentual values of biosurfactants producing bacteria have been reported in the 

literature:  26.9 % from petroleum contaminated soil [122]; 23.8 % from hydrocarbon-

contaminated environments [119]; 22.86 % in water samples collected from oil reservoirs [133]. 

However, different recovery percentages are often reported when using other carbon sources. 

The use of the chemical surfactants SDS and CTAB as sole carbon sources  resulted in collection of 

surfactant-resistant bacterioneuston isolates from the Ria de Aveiro, 9.6 % of which were 

biosurfactants producers identified as Pseudomonads [134]. 

Overall, the environmental matrix from where the higher amount of biosurfactant 

producing bacteria were isolated was the SML, with 6 out of 15 (40.0 %) positive results. This 

result supports the fact that SML is a potentially rich source of biosurfactant-producing strains 

due to its particular physical-chemical properties. Bacterioneuston have to survive the surface 

tension of the air-water interface producing surface active compounds such as biosurfactants for 

that purpose. Also, the SML has structural analogies with biofilms and biosurfactant production is 

a common feature of biofilm organisms with important roles in the regulation of the 

tridimensional shape of the biofilm [135]. This also applies to rhizosphere bacteria that often form 

biofilms on plant root surfaces [136, 137]. The lowest percentage of biosurfactant producing 



 
 
 
 
   Discussion

isolates was found in the sediment subset, with only 3 positive results in 26 (11.5 %). These results 

are not unexpected since there is little selective pressure in the sediment matrix per se regarding 

the production of biosurfactants. In a study by Viramontes-Ramos et al. (2010) [138] only 17 

biosurfactant-producing isolates were found out of 324 (5,25 %) from samples of hydrocarbon-

contaminated soils. 

The percentage of biosurfactants producing isolates was highest among the subset 

isolated from the maritime diesel selective cultures, with 7 positive results out of 22 isolates 

tested (31.8 %). Maritime diesel is, of all the carbon sources tested, the most similar to the 

pollutants found in the proximity of the sampling site (due to the small harbors and leisure boats), 

therefore microbial communities may be more prepared to use it as a carbon source and use it to 

produce biosurfactants. Several bacterial strains have been isolated from diesel contaminated 

sites [139, 140]. Paraffin and crude oil selective cultures present the lowest proportions of 

biosurfactants producing isolates, both with 5 positive results in 24 (20.8 %) and 20 (25.0 %) 

isolates tested, respectively. However this value is not far from the other values detected in the 

selective cultures enriched with crude oil [122, 133]. 

In the overall analysis, the most successful combination for the isolation of biosurfactant 

producing bacteria was the bacterioneuston inoculum and diesel as hydrophobic carbon source. 

This combination produced the highest percentage of positive results with 4 positives out of 6 

(66.7 %) isolates tested. Also, it corresponds to the selective culture with the second lowest 

genetic diversity, which can be an indication of natural adaptation of the community. The least 

successful combination was the sediment inoculum with crude as carbon source, because none of 

the isolates retrieved from this selective culture tested positive for biosurfactant production.   

The metabolization of complex carbon sources such as hydrocarbons is often associated 

to the production of biosurfactants which in turn emulsify the hydrocarbons and enhance 

dispersal, making their transport into the intracellular compartment more easy and consequently 

accelerate biodegradation [141, 142]. In addition to the carbon sources, other growth conditions, 

such as temperature, pH, agitation, oxygen availability and nitrogen sources may influence the 

production of biosurfactants [61, 122]. It is possible that the conditions used in this work were still 

not optimal for the production of biosurfactants and biosurfactants production in isolates that 

tested negative with the atomized oil assay may not be completely ruled out. Some of the isolates 

may have produced small quantities of biosurfactant that were not detectable by the screening 

method used.

The results confirm that bacterioneuston communities represent a valuable seedbank for 

the prospection of microorganisms with interesting capacities from the biotechnological 

perspective and that is a worthy environment to explore in the search for efficient 

hydrocarbonoclastic biosurfactant-producers suitable for bioremediation approaches.

5. Conclusion 

The main objective of this work was to assess the biotechnological potential of bacterial 

communities from different matrixes of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro regarding their 

capacity to produce biosurfactants and to degrade hydrophobic hydrocarbons. Those bacterial 

strains could be used in the future in bioremediation strategies of hydrocarbon contaminated 

coastal and estuarine sites. Crude oil, maritime diesel and liquid paraffin were the carbon sources 

used because they are common contaminants and highly hydrophobic. The environmental 

matrixes used as inoculants were SML water, rhizosphere bacteria and bulk sediment, which are 

recognized as highly diverse microbial communities and in the first two cases as natural sources of 

biosurfactant producing bacteria. In this work 9 selective cultures were obtained combining all 

carbon sources with all matrixes, so that a comprehensive study comparing the community size, 

diversity and frequency of culturable biosurfactant-producers of the different cultures could be 

made. 

The findings of this study allow us to conclude that the all micro niches studied had bacterial 

communities with a high biotechnological potential for degradation of hydrophobic hydrocarbons 

and production of biosurfactants. The most suitable combination for the retrieval of 

biosurfactants producing bacteria was the use of diesel as carbon source and inoculum of SML 

water since it presented the highest percentage of biosurfactant producers (66.7 %), although it 

presented a low Shannon–Weaver diversity index when compared with the other selective 

cultures (1,5029). Bacterioneuston in particular, has shown great potential regarding the presence 

of biosurfactant producing potential hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria and community diversity, 

making it a prime place to isolate strains for future use in bioremediation strategies.
