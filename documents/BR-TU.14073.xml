Abstract  Leishmaniasis is  a typical parasite infection whose protective immunity depends on
macrophage activation. Susceptibility to Leishmania donovani infection was compared in H
(high antibody responder) and L (low antibody responder) mice from selection IV-A. H mice
infected intravenously with 107 amastigotes of L. donovani were more susceptible to infection
than their L counterparts. This higher susceptibility was characterized by a higher splenic and
hepatic parasite burden. An increased splenic index was observed in both lines after sixty days
of infection. This splenomegaly was caused, at least partially, by an increase in the number of
splenic cells as determined by  direct counts of cells from spleen. The results show that
selection IV-A is susceptible to visceral leishmaniasis, with the H line being more susceptible
than the L line.

Resumo  A leishmaniose é uma infecção parasitária cuja imunidade protetora envolve a
ativação de macrófagos. Neste trabalho avaliamos a susceptibilidade de camundongos H e L
(bons e maus produtores de anticorpos, respectivamente) da seleção IV-A, à infecção com o
protozoário L. donovani. Camundongos H infectados com 10 7 amastigotas por via intravenosa
foram mais suscetíveis, apresentando maior carga parasitária tanto no fígado quanto no baço.
Após 60 dias de infecção ambas as linhagens apresentaram um aumento no índice esplênico.
Esta esplenomegalia foi conseqüência, pelo menos parcialmente, de um aumento no número
de células esplênicas. Os resultados indicam que a seleção IV-A é susceptível à infecção com
L. donovani e que dentro desta seleção a linhagem H apresenta maior suscetibilidade do que
a linhagem L.

L e i s h m a n i a e are obligate intracellular
protozoan parasites of macrophages that cause
a spectrum of human diseases, including self-
healing skin lesions, diffuse cutaneous and
mucosal manifestations, or severe visceral
diseases. Important immunological features of
visceral leishmaniasis include circulating immune
complexes12, polyclonal B-cell activation with
elevated IgM and IgG levels1 5, immunosuppression
and absence of detectable cell-mediated immunity
during acute infection13.

High (H) and low (L) responder lines of mice
provide a useful model to investigate the
contribution of humoral and cellular immunity to
immune phenomena. H and Lantibody responder
lines of mice were produced by bidirectional
selective breeding of high and low responder lines
of mice to natural multideterminant immunogens
administered at optimal doses. The diff e r e n t
antigens used were sheep erythrocytes (SE)
and pigeon erythrocytes (Selection I), SE only
(Selection II), flagellar and somatic antigens of
Salmonellae (Selections III and IV respectively),
bovine serum albumin, and rabbit gamma
globulin (Selection V)3. Selection IV- A w a s
derived from F2 interline segregants between
HIV and LIV lines in response to SE 9. T h i s
a p p r o a c h  h a s  p e r m i t t e d  t o  e s t a b l i s h  t h a t
quantitative antibody production is a polygenic
trait regulated by a group of about 10 independent
loci2 14. The alleles separated in each line by
selective breeding have a nonspecific effect,
operating on the quantitative antibody response
to many unrelated immunogens3. Fundamental

immunological differences of H and L lines have
been described. The level of serum antibody is
markedly higher in H than L lines and T cell-
mediated immunity is of similar intensity in both
lines1 8. It was also demonstrated that humoral
and cell-mediated responses to the same
a n t i g e n s  a r e  s u b j e c t e d  t o  i n d e p e n d e n t
polygenic regulation21. The importance of these
immunogenetic characteristics for the general
strategy of anti-infectious immunity has been
hypothesized5. More recently, differences in T

p r o d u c t i o n  b y  H  a n d  L l i n e s  h a v e  b e e n
characterized10 22.

The resistance of H and L lines to various
bacterial and parasitic infections has been studied.
These studies demonstrated that H mice are
more resistant than L mice to infections in which
antibodies play a major protective role17 20. In
contrast, L mice are more resistant to infections
caused by intracellular pathogens11. Low antibody
responses in Lmice have been attributed to higher
catabolism of immunogens in the macrophages
and consequent decreased antigen presentation
by these cells. These macrophage catabolic
differences have been previously demonstrated
in selections I, II and IV-A16.

Considering that L. donovani is an intracellular
parasite and that the macrophage function is
altered in selection IV-A, the purpose of this
study  was to evaluate the susceptibility of H and
L mice from selection IV- A to infection with
L. donovani.

MATERIALAND METHODS

Animals. Twenty-nine H male mice and 29 L
male mice from selection IV-Aaged 8-10 weeks,
developed by the Immunology Section of the
Biological Institute of São Paulo and maintained
at the Animal Facility of the Department of
Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of
Biosciences, UNESP, Botucatu, were used.

P a ra s i t e s .  L .  d o no v a n i s t r a i n  1 S  w a s
maintained in vivo by serial passage in golden
hamsters. Amastigotes for inoculation into mice
were obtained from the spleens of chronically
infected hamsters, washed three times in
p h o s p h a t e  b u f f e r e d  s a l i n e  ( P B S ,  p H  7 . 2 )
and adjusted to a concentration of 5 x 10 7
amastigotes/ml.

Infection. Thirty eight mice (19 H and 19 L)
were infected by the intravenous route with 107
amastigotes. Groups of 8 (4 H and 4 L) infected

animals were sacrificed at 15, 20, 30 and 60
days postinoculation and their spleens and livers
collected to evaluate the different parameters.
Six mice (3 H and 3 L) were sacrificed 24 hours
after inoculation to establish the acute parasite
population growth rate in the liver. Twenty non-
infected mice (10 H and 10 L) were used as
normal controls. 

He pa t ic an d  s pl en ic par asi te burd e n .
Impression smears from livers and spleens were
stained with Giemsa to evaluate parasite burden.
The number of amastigotes per host cell nucleus
was determined by counting 1000 host cells as
previously described 6. The relative and total
numbers of parasites per organ, named Leishman-
Donovan Units (LDU) and total Leishman-
Donovan Units (total LDU). respectively, were
calculated according to the formula:

Total LDU = LDU x organ weight (mg) x 2.105

Splenic index. This index was determined
according to the formula:

Splenic index =

Splenic cell number. Spleens from normal
and infected mice were removed and cell
suspensions prepared by teasing the material
through a stainless steel sieve in PBS. The total
number of cells was counted in a Neubauer
chamber.

Statistical analysis. The Kruskall-Wallis non-
parametric test was performed to determine the
statistical significance of the data (p &amp;lt;0.05 was
considered significant).

RESULTS

Acute growth rate of L. donovani in H and L
mice from selection IV-A. Three and four mice
from the H and L lines were killed after 1 and 15
days of infection, respectively. Liver parasite counts
on the first day showed no difference between H
and L mice, with 138 LDU being the mean count
for both lines. After 15 days of infection the mean
parasite burden  was 1803 and 1500 LDU for H
and Lmice, respectively. These results, regardless
of the later course of infection, characterized H
and L mice from selection IV-A as intermediate
in terms of acute susceptibility when compared
with inbred lines of mice experimentally infected
with L. donovani6.

60 days of infection. As can be observed in
Figure 1a for the liver and 1b for the spleen, the
parasitic burden was always higher in the H than
in the L line. However, the difference between H
and L was statistically significant only after 20
and 30 days of infection. After 60 days of
infection, the last period evaluated, the parasitic
burden was similar in liver and spleen of both
lines.

Splenic index. The splenic index in normal H
mice was higher than in normal L mice. This
difference was preserved in infected animals
and was statistically significant during all periods
analyzed (Figure 2a). When evaluated in each

30 and 60 days of infection. In the L line the
increase in the splenic index was significant only
at 60 days of infection.

Quantitation of splenic cells. Spleens from
normal and infected H and Lmice were removed

and cell suspensions prepared and counted in a
Neubauer chamber. The results are presented
in Figure 2b. Control H mice had a significantly
higher splenic cell number than control L mice
and this difference was unchanged during the
first 30 days of infection. Also during this period

there was no alteration in total splenic cell
number. However, both lines showed a striking
increase in total splenic cell number after 60

days of infection. This increase was statistically
significant in relation to any of the other periods
analyzed in the same line.

DISCUSSION

In this work we used high (H) and low (L)
responder lines of mice from selection IV-A as
an experimental model for visceral leishmaniasis.

The H mice presented a higher parasite
burden in spleen and liver compared to their L
counterparts. This result is similar to those
obtained when the lines H and L were used as
experimental models for other intracellular
parasites such as Leishmania tro p i c a4 a n d
Salmonella typhimurium24 and Brucella suis11.
In our model we observed that after 20 and 30
days H mice were more susceptible than L mice
since H mice showed a significantly higher number
of parasites both in spleen and liver. However,
after 60 days of infection the parasite burden

was equivalent in H and Lmice. In addition, after
15 days of infection, the parasite burden in the
l i v e r, which has been used as an index to evaluate
acute susceptibility in experimental murine
leishmaniasis6, was identical in H and L mice. It
is possible that this difference  observed on the
20th and 30th day of infection was caused by a
delay in developing a specific immune response
able to partially restrain the parasite growth in H
mice. This possibility finds some support in the
fact that macrophages from the H line have a
lower metabolic and bactericidal activity16. This
may consequently delay the ability of these
macrophages to present antigens to Th cells or
to kill the intracellular leishmania amastigotes.

Another parameter evaluated was the splenic
index. Interestingly, normal H mice already
presented a significantly higher splenic index
compared to normal L mice and this difference
was maintained during infection. In each line
there was also an increase in the splenic index
from the 30th day of infection on. This increase
was highly significant after 60 days of infection.
Splenic hipertrophy is a classical description both
in human and experimental kala-azar 18 and has
been attributed to both monocyte recruitment23
and polyclonal activation7. In our study we  found
a very pronounced increase in the splenic cell
number at 60 days of infection in both mouse
lines. This result shows that both lines from the

IV-A selection, experimentally infected with L.
donovani, reproduce splenomegaly, which is the
hallmark for visceral leishmaniasis.

In view of the significant difference between
the H and L lines from selection IV-A in terms of
parasite burden after 20 and 30 days of infection,
the distinct immunological characteristics already
described for these two lines and the fact that
they represent extreme phenotypes found in a
natural heterogeneous (outbred) population, we
believe that this model could be used to study
the macrophage-Leishmania interaction and the
kinetics of the specific immune response to this
parasite.
