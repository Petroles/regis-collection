I have always looked up to teachers. They turn empty heads into a paradise of ideas,

knowledge and conscious opinions. They transform human beings into citizens. And,

yet, they get almost nothing back (especially nowadays, especially in Brazil). They

are not even respected by most of the students — or their parents, as a matter of fact.

Teachers have nothing but this unmeasurable passion for giving all they have in their

minds in the hope that a few of the listeners is going to grow to be a good person.

Today, I hope I am one of them. That is why I begin here by thanking all my teachers,

from my childhood to my adolescence. They made me understand that, in my own

words at that time, I wanted nothing but to be an eternal student.

My special thanks go to two teachers that made me want to be a scientist.

First, my father João, my Physics teacher, in whom I mirror myself to be as much

organized, determined and passionate about something as he is. I am very proud

to be a lot like him in this sense. Dad, I want you to know that everything your dad

expected you to be, you became: a scientist, a master, a bright mind, and on the top of

all that, an amazing parent. Second, my first Science teacher, Lucilia, who presented

me to this amazing world and always encouraged me to pursue Ocean Sciences.



Acknowledgments ix

I also thank all my professors at the University, especially the ones who

showed me what kind of professor I want to be some years ahead from now. To

my advisors — Rodrigo, Mauricio, and Ilana —, I give my sincere acknowledgements

for giving me the opportunity to learn from them in all kinds of situation. To McGill

University and my supervisor, Dr. Lawrence Mysak, my eternal appreciation for wel-

coming me at his research group for one year. Prof. Mysak showed me what is to

be an honest and respected scientist, an exceptional professor and advisor, and a

remarkable human being.

I am extremely grateful to my mother. Even with a broken heart from seeing

a child leave for so long and so far, she always supported me in my decisions and

comforted me when those were the wrong ones. My mom is always there, no matter

what. She is brave and loving, as every mother in the world should be. I thank my

sister for her love and her husband for our nerd talks. To my aunts, uncles, cousins,

and grandparents (the four of them), I thank to be part of this family. I still believe, as

a kid does, that our family is perfect.

To my husband-to-be, I thank for his endless love, patience, support, and

encouragement. I could not have done it without him. He never let me give up or

desperate when things got ugly. He is not only my sweetheart. He is my partner, he is

my team, he is my best friend. That is how I know we will be always together. To my

parents-in-law, I also thank for their love and support at every single moment of the

last three years.

I thank my friends, the scientist ones and the mentally-healthy ones too. Marc

and Ana Paula, in particular, thank you for sharing academic crises, deep conversa-

tions about life and science, and, of course, hilarious comics and cat videos.

Finally, I thank the FAPESP agency for allowing me to continue my academic

formation through the grants 2011/02047-9 and 2013/20977-9.

Each piece of this work exists because of you all.

Resumo

D
URANTE os últimos 21.000 anos, o planeta sofreu grandes mudanças. A

concentração de CO2 atmosférico aumentou cerca de 50% (Monnin et al.,

2001) e a temperatura média global aumentou 4,0±0,8?C até a época

pré-industrial (Annan and Hargreaves, 2013). Como consequência deste aqueci-

mento, os grandes mantos de gelo que cobriam a América do Norte, o norte da

Europa e parte da Eurásia derreteram e os oceanos polar e subpolar receberam

grandes quantidades de água doce destes mantos em retração. A entrada de água

doce altera gradientes de pressão na superfície do mar e também a densidade de

massas de água. Como a circulação oceânica é parcialmente forçada por diferenças

de densidade, a água de degelo tem o potencial de afetar esta circulação. Nesta tese

de Doutorado, os impactos da entrada de água de degelo no oceano desde o Último

Máximo Glacial em altas latitudes, especialmente do Oceano Atlântico, são estuda-

dos usando os resultados de uma simulação transiente dos últimos 22 mil anos com o

modelo NCAR-CCSM3. Os principais resultados mostram que: (1) a circulação de re-

volvimento meridional do Atlântico enfraqueceu durante eventos de descarga de água

doce próxima a regiões de formação de água densa; (2) a Água Profunda do Atlântico



Resumo xii

Norte (APAN) estava ausente no começo da deglaciação, enquanto sua versão inter-

mediária — Água Glacial Intermediária do Atlântico Norte (AGIAN) — era formada;

(3) AGIAN era uma massa d’água doce e fria, semelhante à Água Intermediária An-

tártica (AIA) no domínio termohalino atual; (4) as camadas profundas e de fundo da

bacia do Atlântico eram dominadas pela Água de Fundo Antártica (AFA) na primeira

metade da simulação; (5) a transição de AGIAN para APAN ocorreu após o Heinrich

Stadial 1; (6) quando a APAN apareceu, cerca de 12 mil anos atrás (ka), a AFA retraiu

e ficou limitada às camadas de fundo; (7) a presença de uma camada de baixa salini-

dade na superfície do Oceano Austral há ?14 mil anos impedia a liberação de calor

das águas profundas para a atmosfera, aquecendo a AFA; (8) a Corrente Costeira

Antártica foi intensificada pela descarga de água de degelo proveniente do manto

de gelo Antártico. Usando o Oceano Índico como comparação, foi observado que

o Atlântico Norte afetou o Índico oeste tropical através de processos atmosféricos,

enquanto variações climáticas associadas ao Hemisfério Sul foram transmitidas via

oceano — especialmente através das camadas intermediárias. Embora as condições

iniciais dos oceanos glacial e moderno sejam diferentes, este estudo pode ser usado

para prever as possíveis respostas do oceano ao presente derretimento acelerado

de geleiras e mantos de gelo associado a mudanças climáticas abruptas.

Abstract

D
URING the last 21,000 years, the planet underwent major changes. The

atmospheric CO2 concentration increased ?50% (Monnin et al., 2001)

and the mean global temperature increased 4.0±0.8?C until pre-industrial

times (Annan and Hargreaves, 2013). As a consequence of this warming, the huge

ice sheets that covered North America, Northern Europe and part of Eurasia melted

and the polar and subpolar ocean surface received a large amount of freshwater from

these retracting ice sheets. The input of freshwater alters pressure gradients on the

sea surface and also the density of water masses. Since the ocean circulation is par-

tially driven by density differences, the deglacial meltwater has the potential to affect

the ocean circulation. In this PhD thesis, the impacts of meltwater input since the

Last Glacial Maximum into the high latitudes, especially of the Atlantic Ocean, are

studied using the results of a transient simulation of the last 22 thousand years with

NCAR-CCSM3. The main results show that: (1) the Atlantic Meridional Overturn-

ing Circulation (AMOC) slowed down during freshwater discharge events near dense

water formation regions; (2) North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) was absent in the

beginning of the deglaciation, while its intermediate version — Glacial North Atlantic



Abstract xiv

Intermediate Water (GNAIW) — was being formed; (3) GNAIW was a fresh and cold

water mass, very similar to the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the thermo-

haline domain; (4) the deep and abyssal Atlantic basin was dominated by AABW in

the first half of the simulation; (5) the transition from GNAIW to NADW occurred after

the Heinrich Stadial 1; (6) when the NADW appeared, around 12 thousand years ago

(ka), AABW retracted and was constrained to lie near the bottom; (7) the presence of

a low-salinity layer in the Southern Ocean surface around 14,000 years ago prevented

the release of heat from deep waters to the atmosphere, warming the AABW; (8) the

Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC) was reinforced by the meltwater discharge from the

Antarctic ice sheet. Using the Indian Ocean as a comparison, it was observed that the

North Atlantic affected the western tropical Indian through atmosphere, while climatic

variations associated with the Southern Hemisphere were transmitted via ocean —

especially through intermediate waters. Although the initial conditions in the glacial

and modern ocean are different, this study may be used to foresee the possible re-

sponses of the ocean to the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice sheets, which are

associated with dramatic climate changes.

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

T
HE impact of human activities on the climate has never been so evident. Ac-

cording to IPCC 5th Assessment Report (2013), more than a half of the

observed increase in the global mean surface temperature from 1951 to

2010 was caused by anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentra-

tions and other anthropogenic forcings together. The climate system is responding

to this warming: over the last twenty years, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets

have been losing mass and glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide. Be-

tween 1992 and 2011, the melting of ice sheets has contributed to a sea level rise

rate of 0.59± 0.20 mm/yr (Shepherd et al., 2012). Moreover, the projections for fu-

ture climate point out that current glacier extents are out of balance with the present

climatic conditions, indicating that glaciers will continue to shrink even without further

temperature increase. Meanwhile, the oceans are receiving all this melted ice and

the scientific community is concerned about the changes in ocean circulation that this

meltwater input may trigger (e.g., Swingedouw et al., 2006; Driesschaert et al., 2007;



2

Hu et al., 2011; Blaschek et al., 2014).

The oceans are fundamental to the climate system as they are the major sink

of atmospheric energy and carbon (e.g., Ellis et al., 1978; Hall and Bryden, 1982;

Gruber et al., 2002; Sabine et al., 2004). The large-scale ocean circulation distributes

heat from the tropical regions to higher latitudes. As an example of the ocean role in

the heat distribution, consider the warm equatorial waters that are carried by the Gulf

Stream. They travel northward along the USA coast and turn toward Europe as the

North Atlantic Current. From there, the warm waters are picked up by the Norwegian

Current, which bathes the Norway coast. This is why the northwestern Europe enjoys

a milder climate than Canada at the same latitude (e.g., Hartmann, 1994). The deep

ocean circulation is, on average, meridional, and it is mainly driven by density differ-

ences among water masses formed in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Since

the density of sea water is mainly controlled by temperature and salinity, changes in

those fields lead to changes in circulation. For example, when warm tropical waters

are transported to the northern North Atlantic they release heat to the atmosphere

and become cold — therefore, denser than their surroundings — which leads these

waters to sink to the deep ocean. Although the temperature is usually more impor-

tant in determining density, changes in salinity also affect the vertical position of a

water parcel in the water column, especially near the poles, where temperatures do

not change much. Thus, the input of freshwater coming from the melting of ice sheets

and glaciers at high latitudes can affect ocean circulation (e.g., Blaschek et al., 2014).

The introduction of large amounts of meltwater has happened before in Earth’s

history. Around 20,000 years ago, continental ice sheets covered North America, the

northern portion of Europe and part of Eurasia (Peltier, 1994). From that time until

the middle Holocene (around 6,000 years ago), these ice sheets melted, contributing

to a sea level rise of ?120 m during the last 21 thousand years (Fairbanks, 1989).

Studying the climate of the past, therefore, can help us understand what responses

should be expect under extreme climate changes. In order to do that, scientists use

numerical models that might explain how the observed variations in the several cli-



3

mate system components happened and interacted to each other. One of the many

interesting aspects of studying the Earth’s past climate through numerical models is

that they give us a better understanding of the mechanisms and ranges of the climate

system’s natural variability. This comprehension allows us to improve models and

access their sensibility before trying to simulate future climate changes.

The present thesis has the main objective of evaluating the ocean responses

to meltwater influxes. The specific objectives are:

1. To analyze changes in the Meridional Overturning Circulation and its associated

transports of heat and salt under the influence of meltwater discharges;

2. To diagnose variations in the temperature and salinity fields of the Atlantic Ocean,

where most of the meltwater is introduced;

3. To determine the distribution of the main Atlantic water masses before, during,

and after meltwater discharge episodes;

4. To evaluate the local impacts of a meltwater discharge in a key region to water

mass formation;

5. To verify the potential teleconnections of Atlantic meltwater fluxes to other oceans.

It is hypothesized that the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice sheets af-

fects the ocean circulation and, consequently, the climate equilibrium. In order to

reach the presented goals, the results of a transient simulation of the past 22,000

years are analyzed. Each chapter of this thesis addresses one of the specific objec-

tives. In Chapter 2, the evolution of climate for the last 21,000 years is presented.

Chapter 3 describes the model and simulation which generated the data analyzed.

Chapters 4 to 7 assess the changes in the Atlantic Ocean’s circulation, thermohaline

characteristics, and water masses distribution. Chapter 8 presents some local im-

pacts of the meltwater presence in the Southern Ocean. Chapter 9 investigates how

an ocean that is isolated from the North Atlantic — the Indian Ocean — responds to

the freshwater inputs in the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, Chapter 10 points out the main

conclusions and final considerations of this thesis.

CHAPTER 2

Climate evolution since the Last Glacial

Maximum

I
N 1941, Milankovitch proposed that the size of ice sheets was controlled by orbital

variations, which are expressed in terms of summer insolation changes at high

latitudes. Thirty-five years later, Hays et al. (1976) showed that, during the

Quaternary (the last ?2.6 million years), the Earth experimented ice age cycles at

similar intervals to the main periods of orbital variations. The Last Glacial Maximum

(LGM) ended at approximately 19 ka (ka: thousands of years ago), when the summer

insolation at the Northern Hemisphere increased enough to make the ablation rates

exceed the snow accumulation rates, thus triggering the melting of the large ice sheets

(e.g., Milankovitch, 1941; Berger, 1978; Clark et al., 2009). The climate evolution after

this trigger, however, does not seem to have been controlled by orbital variations only,

but also by a set of internal responses of the climate system (Ruddiman, 2008). The

last deglaciation, from 19 ka to 10 ka, was the most recent natural climate change,



2.1. CLIMATE STATE AT 21,000 YEARS AGO 5

when CO2 increased by ? 70-80 ppmv. This rise is comparable to the one generated

by emissions since the Industrial Revolution (Karl and Trenberth, 2003). Therefore,

studying this period of the Earth’s history allows us to observe how the climate system

acts and reacts to changes in its multiple components.

2.1 Climate state at 21,000 years ago

The last ice age registered in proxy data1 began around 100,000 years ago (Kukla

et al., 2002). Its peak — when the ice sheets reached their maximum extent — was

around 21 ka, period which is referred to as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, Mix

et al., 2001). The LGM ended when the increasing summer insolation in the Northern

Hemisphere (NH) triggered the most recent deglaciation.

Twenty-one thousand years ago, the Earth had mean temperatures of 4.0±0.8?C

(Annan and Hargreaves, 2013), the sea level was ?130 m below the present one

(Clark et al., 2009), and all this missing water was stored in ice sheets that covered

most of North America (i.e., the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Northern Europe, and Eurasia.

Figure 2.1 shows the extent and thickness of these ice sheets at the LGM, which are

provided by the ICE-5G data set (Peltier, 2004).

2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 6

Then, what would cause the Earth’s climate 21 ka to be so different from the

present state? First, the presence of the ice sheets itself contributed to keep the low

temperatures, since the high albedo of the ice reflects more than absorbs the solar

radiation. Second, the atmospheric GHG concentrations of these two periods are

very different. The CO2 and CH4 concentrations were ?190 ppmv and 350 ppbv at

the LGM (Monnin et al., 2001), about 68% and 40% of present levels, respectively.

Moreover, Alley and Clark (1999) showed that the stronger glacial winds may have

contributed to the low temperatures through the increased mixing and upwelling in

the tropics.

2.2 The last deglaciation

The last deglaciation started (around 19 ka) as soon as the summer insolation at

northern high latitudes began to increase. The insolation increased gradually up to

?12 ka, when it reached a maximum and started decreasing toward present levels

(Figure 2.2(a)). This solar radiation increase is, however, small compared with the cli-

mate changes observed during the deglaciation. This implies the existence of positive

feedbacks that amplify the climate system responses. In fact, variations on sea level,

albedo and GHG concentrations seem to have assumed this role (Alley and Clark,

1999).

The last deglaciation was a highly variable climatic period, consisting of os-

cillations with periods that go from 1,500 to 100,000 years and overlap each other, al-

ternating warm and cold phases. The slowest oscillations are related to Milankovitch

cycles — fluctuations of the orbital parameters which determine the amount of solar

radiation received at the Earth’s surface. The shorter oscillations are probably re-

lated to ice sheet and deep ocean circulation changes (Alley and Clark, 1999). The

?1,500-year oscillations are called the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles (Bond and

Lotti, 1995; Bond et al., 1997), which manifest themselves through abrupt changes

in temperature. After several successively colder D-O cycles, a Heinrich event may



2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 7

occur (Heinrich, 1988; Bond et al., 1993). The Heinrich events were first described

by Hartmut Heinrich (1988) and are characterized by massive iceberg discharges into

the North Atlantic. These events are identified in the geological records as sediment

layers of fast deposition. As the icebergs drift and melt, they leave behind freshwa-

ter and debris of variable sizes, the so-called Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) (e.g. Keigwin

and Lehman, 1994). The debris sink to the bottom of the ocean and are buried after-

wards, forming a distinct layer at sediment cores. The cause of the Heinrich Events

is not well established, but explanations go from internal instabilities of ice sheets

(MacAyeal, 1993) to increase in sea surface temperature (Marcott et al., 2011). The

Heinrich events are commonly followed by abrupt warmings.

2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 8

Considering the millennial oscillations cited above, the last deglaciation con-

sisted of a sequence of five climatic periods that can be observed in the Greenland

surface air temperature (SAT) evolution, reconstructed from ice cores collected dur-

ing the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (Alley, 2000a, Figure 2.2(b), green line): the

Oldest Dryas (cold, from 19 to 14.7 ka), the Bølling (warm, from 14.7 to 14 ka), the

Older Dryas (cold, from 14 to 13.7), the Allerød (warm, from 13.7 to 12.9 ka), and

the Younger Dryas (cold, from 12.9 to 11.7 ka)3. The Heinrich event 1 (H1) occurred

during the Oldest Dryas. Commonly, the H1 is dated from 17.5 to 16 ka based on

the layer of IRD in NH sediment cores. Stanford et al. (2011), conversely, define the

Heinrich Stadial 1 in a broader sense, placing it between 19 ka and 14.6 ka. The

authors divide the H1 in three main phases: the onset of meltwater release at ?19

ka; the ’conventional’ H1 IRD deposition phase starting at about 17.5 ka; and the final

phase between 16.5 and ?15 ka, marked by pooling of freshwater in the Nordic Seas.

Based on this broader definition, the H1 is placed in a period as long as the Oldest

Dryas itself. Because of that, the period between 19 ka and 14.7 will be referred to,

hereafter, as H1. Moreover, since the Older Dryas was quite fast and sometimes can-

not be identified in low resolution records, this period is often omitted and the interval

from 14.7 to 12.9 ka is merged as the Bølling-Allerød.

Having the above discussion in mind, here we simplify and divide the deglacia-

tion in three climatic episodes that mark dramatic transitions of temperature, green-

house gases concentration, sea level, and massive iceberg discharges. They are:

• Heinrich Stadial 1 (H1): from 19 to 14.7 ka;

• Bøllling-Allerød (BA): from 14.7 to 12.9 ka;

• Younger Dryas (YD): from 12.9 to 11.7 ka.

The H1 marked the end of LGM with the first meltwater discharges, causing

the sea level to rapidly rise ?10-15 m at around 19 ka (Yokoyama et al., 2000). Dur-

ing the H1, the temperature decreased about 4?C followed by an increase of 2?3?C
3The dates are estimates because there is still controversy about the periods’ boundaries chronol-

ogy.



2.2. THE LAST DEGLACIATION 9

before the beginning of the BA (Figure 2.2, top). At around 14.7 ka, the BA termi-

nated the H1 with a sharp air temperature increase in the Northern Hemisphere —

?13?C in less than 150 years (Cuffey and Clow, 1997). During the BA, a meltwater

discharge responsible for a rapid sea level rise of ?20 m in less than 150 years took

place and was named meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A Fairbanks, 1989). The Younger

Dryas followed the Allerød with a temperature decrease of ?9?C in about 200 years,

which made this period almost as cold as the glacial interval. During the YD, a new

iceberg discharge took place at the NH (the Heinrich event 0, Andrews et al., 1995)

accompanied by increased freshwater fluxes in the North Atlantic. The YD ended at

11.7 ka with a 5 to 10?C increase in Greenland SAT (Alley, 2000b). After that, the

components of the climate system stabilized, marking the beginning of the Holocene.

In total, Greenland temperatures increased by 15?C between the LGM and the late

Holocene (e.g., Cuffey and Clow, 1997).

These events were observed in climate records all around the planet, almost

synchronic with the NH. However, looking at the Antarctic temperature evolution reg-

istered in the Dome C ice core (Jouzel et al., 2007) it can be seen that the southern

high latitudes behave quite differently than their northern counterpart (Figure 2.2(b),

purple line). Blunier and Brook (2001) showed that, in the last 90,000 years, signifi-

cant increases in Greenland temperature were preceded by Antarctica by 1,500-3,000

years — interval that coincides with the period of the D-O oscillations. Because of

that, it is possible to observe a phase opposition between Greenland and Antarctica

temperature time series, which means that warm periods in one place coincide with

cold periods in the other one. This behaviour is known as bipolar seesaw (Broecker

et al., 1998), but it is not exactly symmetric around the equator. While the "northern

behaviour" is observed broadly around the world, the "southern behaviour" is only

observed in the South Atlantic, Central Indian and Deep Pacific Ocean (Alley and

Clark, 1999). It is believed that the "southern behaviour" is transmitted through the

ocean along hundreds of years, while the "northern behaviour" is transmitted via at-

mosphere, allowing the observed global synchronicity (Alley and Clark, 1999).



2.3. THE HOLOCENE 10

Figure 2.2(c) shows the temporal evolution of two important greenhouse gases:

CO2 and CH4. The CO2 concentrations rise in a two-step fashion: from the early H1

(?17 ka) to the beginning of the BA (14.7 ka) and from the end of the BA (12.9 ka)

to the end of YD (11.7 ka), when it reaches interglacial levels. CH 4 concentrations

also start to rise around 17 ka and jump abruptly from ?450 to 640 ppbv during the

BA, followed by a sharp decrease back to ?450 ppbv at the YD (12.9 ka). At the end

of the YD, CH4 concentrations jump to 650 ppbv again. An interesting feature pointed

by Alley and Clark (1999) can be observed in these time series: CO2 variations follow

Heinrich events because these events affect especially ocean processes which, in

turn, control atmospheric CO2 concentrations. On the other hand, CH4 oscillates with

D-O events, because one of the main sources of CH4 — the wetlands — are closely

related to the monsoonal regime, which is affected by the temperature swings that

characterize D-O events.

2.3 The Holocene

During the deglaciation, the large amplitude of climate variability is attributed to the

presence of huge ice sheets, which amplify climatic responses (e.g., Mayewski et al.,

2004). In the Holocene, however, most of the ice sheets had melted and the main

forcing of climate variations became the seasonal contrast of incoming solar radiation

(Bond et al., 2001). This contrast was reflected on changes in the hydrological cycle

and monsoonal systems (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2006; Mayewski et al., 2004) which,

in turn, were expressed in surface changes in vegetation, lake levels in Asia and

northern Africa, and expansion of the boreal forest at the expense of tundra at mid-

to high latitudes of the NH (Prentice and Jolly, 2000). Although the climatic variability

during the Holocene is fairly stable when compared to the one during the deglaciation,

there are some characteristics and episodes that are worth mentioning.

Bond et al. (1997) recognized eight cold events during the Holocene: at 11.1

ka, 10.3 ka, 9.4 ka, 8.2 ka, 5.9 ka, 4.2 ka, 2.8 ka and 1.4 ka. The authors discuss



2.3. THE HOLOCENE 11

that the probable cause for these events was an ocean surface cooling brought by

changes in North Atlantic’s surface circulation. The most notable event is the 8.2

ka one, when climatic deviations were about half as large as those of the YD (Alley

et al., 1997). Around this time, the temperatures cooled by 3?-6?C over Greenland

and the snow accumulation decreased 20% (Alley et al., 1997). Another cold event,

which happened around 400 years ago, was called the Little Ice Age and followed

the Medieval warm period. Several of those Holocene cold events led to the collapse

and reconstruction of human civilizations (Mayewski et al., 2004). The last major

meltwater discharges occurred with the melting of the remaining Eurasian Ice Sheet

(around 8 ka) and Laurentide Ice Shees (around 7 ka, Carlson et al., 2008).

CHAPTER 3

The transient simulation TraCE-21K

N
UMERICAL models provide "full-picture" scenarios when observations cover

only punctual locations and times. In the past decades, several numerical

studies determined the paleocean state for specific time slices. Here, with

the aid of advanced computational resources, we use the results of the first transient

simulation of the last 22,000 years (called TraCE-21K), based on the NCAR-CCSM3

model. With prescribed greenhouse gas concentrations in atmosphere, insolation lev-

els, meltwater fluxes that resemble sea level rise records, and changes in ice sheets

and coast lines configuration, the simulation successfully reproduced the main cli-

matic periods since the Last Glacial Maximum.

3.1 NCAR-CCSM3 numeric model

The Climate Community System Model (CCSM) is a global coupled model developed

at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It is composed of four com-



3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 13

ponents: atmosphere, ocean, land surface and sea ice (Boville and Gent, 1998). The

atmospheric component of this model is the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM)

version 3 with a ?3.75?in horizontal resolution and 26 hybrid coordinate levels in the

vertical (Collins et al., 2006). The land model uses the same resolution as the atmo-

spheric model, and allows the user to specify glaciers, lakes, wetlands, urban areas,

and vegetated regions.

The ocean component of this model is the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), a

three-dimensional primitive equation model in vertical z-coordinate (Gent et al., 2006).

The ocean grid has a dislocated north pole over Greenland, and 25 levels extending to

5.5 km depth. Its horizontal resolution is approximately 3.6?in longitude and is variable

along latitudes, with greater resolution in the tropics and North Atlantic. The sea ice

model uses the same horizontal grid and land mask as the ocean model, and has a

dynamic–thermodynamic formulation, which includes a sub-grid-scale ice thickness

distribution and elastic–viscous–plastic rheology (Briegleb et al., 2004).

3.2 TraCE-21K settings

The simulation analyzed is referred to as TraCE-21K, and it is the final result of sev-

eral sensitive experiments generated by He (2011) in his effort to constrain meltwater

flux rates and locations that best reproduced Greenland SAT records, the Atlantic

Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength reconstructions, and other proxy

data. The final run spans from 22 ka to 0 ka, which includes the LGM, all the main

climatic events of the last deglaciation, and the Holocene. The present day (0 ka) in

the simulation represents year 1950. He (2011) explains that at each millenial event,

several sensitive experiments were performed with the same initial condition, but dif-

ferent meltwater schemes in terms of rates and location of meltwater discharge. After

taking into consideration the sea level records, indicators of the meridional ocean cir-

culation strength, and Greenland temperature records, he chose the experiment that

best matched the proxy data to continue the transient run (see Figure 3.1). TraCE-21K



3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 14

is an extended version of the DGL-A experiment discussed in Liu et al. (2009).

Figure 3.1: Schematic of the strategy for TraCE-21K. At the beginning of each important
climatic event, several sensitive experiments were performed with different meltwater

schemes. The most successful experiment reproducing proxy data was chosen to continue
the transient run. Figure adapted from He (2011).

The TraCE-21K run was initialized using the results of the LGM CCSM3 sim-

ulation described by Otto-Bliesner et al. (2006). The LGM CCSM3 has prescribed

concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases based on ice core measurements

(Flückiger et al., 1999; Dällenbach et al., 2000; Indermühle et al., 2000) and are given

in Otto-Bliesner et al. (2006, their Table 1) as are the atmospheric aerosols. The con-

centrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide

(N2O) are reduced compared to the pre-industrial values, resulting in a total decrease

in radiative forcing of the troposphere of 2.76 Wm2. The majority of this change (2.22

Wm2) results from a decrease in the amount of CO2. Continental ice sheet extent

and topography in the LGM CCSM3 simulation come from the ICE-5G reconstruction

(Peltier, 2004). The coastline is also taken from the ICE-5G reconstruction and cor-

responds to a sea level ?120 m below the present one. The orbital parameters at

21 ka (Berger, 1978) are used to determine the total solar flux. The LGM CCSM3

ocean was initialized by applying anomalies of the ocean three-dimensional poten-

tial temperature and salinity fields derived from a LGM run with the Climate System

Model version 1.4 (CSM1.4, Shin, 2003). Starting the simulation with a previous LGM

run that reached quasi-equilibrium allows a shorter spin-up phase. The LGM CCSM3

equilibrium was run coupled to a vegetation module (CLM-DGVM, Levis et al., 2004)

for 1800 years before initializing the TraCE-21K simulation.

The initial fields present a colder and saltier deep ocean compared to the

present-day thermohaline structure, which is in agreement with previous studies (Ad-



3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 15

kins et al., 2002). The North Atlantic, in particular, presents a very dense vertical

profile in the subsurface and deep ocean, which gives the LGM ocean its highly strat-

ified characteristic. For the prescribed forcing fields, TraCE-21K adopted transient

orbital parameters and transient greenhouse gases concentrations (CO2, CH4 and

N2O) from Joos and Spahni (2008). The ice sheets volume changed every 500 years

according to ICE-5G reconstruction (Peltier, 2004). The coastlines were also taken

from ICE-5G and were modified at 13.1 ka (removal of the Fennoscadian Ice Sheet

from the Barents Sea), 12.9 ka (opening of the Bering Strait), 7.6 ka (opening of Hud-

son Bay), and 6.2 ka (opening of the Indonesian throughflow). The changes in the

coastlines also reflects the sea level variability.

The meltwater scheme (summarized in Figure 3.2(a)) and their locations

(shown in Figure 3.2(b)) for this simulation are detailed in the Table 3.1. The melt-

water flux rates were chosen based on sea level records presented in Clark and Mix

(2002) and Peltier (2004), and on geological indicators of ice sheet retreat and melt-

water discharge from Licciardi et al. (1999), Clark et al. (2001, 2002a), Clark et al.

(2004), and Carlson (2009). As the sea level records do not constrain the locations

where the meltwater fluxes come from, these locations were chosen according to the

AMOC sensitivity to freshwater input in that particular region. There is a trend of

lower sensitivity of the AMOC to the meltwater forcing in more southerly latitudes.

Therefore, the Beaufort Sea/Mackenzie River discharge, Nordic Sea and 50?- 70?N

of North Atlantic are the three regions with larger sensitivity, while the sensitivity of

the Southern Ocean is very small (He, 2011).

The meltwater discharges were added to the ocean model as a freshwater

flux to the ocean surface (He, 2011). This allows the low salinity signal to spread

freely in the global ocean. The freshwater flux rate applied on each grid cell of the

chosen region was obtained by dividing the corresponding sea level rise by the total

area where the freshwater was inserted. The unit for the meltwater discharge is given

in m/kyr (meters of equivalent sea level volume per thousand years). Since the area

of the ocean is about 3.61x1014 m2, 1 m/kyr means 3.61x1014m3 volume of meltwater



3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 16

in 103 years, which is 0.011 m3/s, or 0.011 Sv.

Figure 3.2: (a) Sum of meltwater flux rates prescribed in each hemisphere in TraCE-21K (1
m/kyr=0.011 Sv) and (b) regions where the meltwater fluxes were prescribed (He, 2011).

In TraCE-21K, the end of the Bølling warming is attributed to the meltwater

pulse 1A (MWP-1A), which triggered the Older Dryas cooling (He, 2011; Liu et al.,

2009). The idea of the causal link between MWP-1A and Older Dryas cooling has

been also proposed based on proxy records (Stanford et al., 2006). Although the ori-

gins of the MWP-1A are still under debate, He (2011) followed the estimates of sea

level records that point out to a 5 m contribution from the NH and 15 m from Antarctica

(Clark et al., 2002b; Bassett et al., 2005), totalling the approximate 20 m sea level rise

registered for this event (Fairbanks, 1989). Any larger contribution from the North-

ern Hemisphere would result in a complete shutdown of the meridional overturning



3.2. TRACE-21K SETTINGS 17

circulation, which is inconsistent with proxy records (McManus et al., 2004).

3.3. SIMULATION PERFORMANCE 19

3.3 Simulation performance

He (2011) points out that between H1 and the onset of BA the sea level stabilized,

which suggests a minimal meltwater discharge during this period. Yet, even with

no meltwater input, the AMOC remained at a near-collapse state during this period,

which could be explained invoking AMOC hysteresis (e.g., Hofmann and Rahmstorf,

2009; Hawkins et al., 2011). Because CCSM3 has a weak AMOC hysteresis (Liu

et al., 2009), it was necessary to induce substantial sea level rise in order to maintain

a near-collapsed AMOC between H1 and BA.

At the onset of BA, the Greenland SAT increases by about 13?C in the simu-

lation, which is in good agreement with SAT georeconstructions in terms of amplitude.

However, the rate of the simulated Greenland warming is ?40% slower than that from

reconstructions: the simulation takes about 350 years to increase Greenlands’s tem-

perature by 13?C, while the reconstructions suggest that this abrupt warming took

only ?200 years to happen (He, 2011).

Proxy data indicate that the AMOC did not collapse during the YD, which im-

plies that the AMOC reduction during YD is smaller than during H1. In the simulation,

the maximum meltwater discharge rate that allowed AMOC to weaken but not shut-

down was 10 m/kyr. This meltwater flux led to a cooling of merely 2?C, compared to

the 8?10?C cooling on Greenland SAT reconstructions. Even with a larger meltwa-

ter discharge and a collapsed AMOC, the temperature decreases only by 3-5?C. He

(2011) explains that, besides AMOC strength, the only other change observed during

this period that could be involved in YD cooling was in the coastline configuration: the

Bering Strait was opened at 12.9 ka. Although the opening of the Bering Strait indeed

showed a contribution for a weaker AMOC, its effect on temperature reduction was

minimal. Therefore, TraCE-21K could not reproduce all the cooling of Younger Dryas.

Besides, with the opening of the Bering Strait at 12.9 ka, the termination of meltwa-

ter flux at the end of the YD fails to produce the abrupt warming during the YD-early

Holocene transition (He, 2011).

Even though AMOC and Greenland SAT reconstructions show a complete



3.3. SIMULATION PERFORMANCE 20

transition to Holocene by 10 ka, He (2011) opted to keep meltwater discharges in

the NH between 10 and 7 ka in order to respect sea level records and geological

indicators of ice sheet retreat. As a result, the simulated Greenland SAT is significantly

cooler than reconstructions between 10 and 7 ka. Once the meltwater was shutdown,

the temperatures reached Holocene levels, which agrees with reconstructions and

modern observations.

Despite the above considerations, the simulation reproduced most of the ma-

jor climatic events of the last deglaciation, suggesting a good agreement in climate

sensitivity between the model and observations (Liu et al., 2009). He (2011) highlights

that, since TraCE-21K started from the LGM and integrated forward with prescribed

GHG concentrations and orbital forcing, the successful simulation of the Holocene

temperatures shows that CCSM3 responds adequately to the radiative forcing.

CHAPTER 4

The Atlantic Ocean’s deglacial evolution:

Introduction

4.1 Present-day structure of the deep ocean circula-

tion

Oceanic motion is driven primarily by two types of forcing: wind stress and buoyancy.

In the upper ? 100 m of the water column, the winds drive horizontal gyres. The

Atlantic Ocean has two subtropical gyres (one in each hemisphere), one subpolar

gyre in the North Atlantic, and an equatorial system (Figure 4.1). In the Atlantic sector

of the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows eastward. Due to the

conservation of potential vorticity, the western boundary currents (WBC) of the gyres

are intense and narrow, while the eastern ones are weak (Talley et al., 2011).

Between 1000 and 1500 m, the intermediate depth circulation is forced by Ek-

man pumping (upwelling and downwelling) generated by wind friction on the surface



4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 22

layers (Talley et al., 2011).

Figure 4.1: Simplified scheme of Atlantic Ocean circulation near the surface driven by winds.

At greater depths, the circulation is mostly forced by buoyancy. The flow in

the ocean interior is generally weak and easily masked by the eddy field and the

deep WBCs (DWBCs) which extend to the bottom - although with reduced strength.

The DWBCs in the Atlantic Ocean are the main carriers of newly formed deep waters

(Stommel, 1958). The northern DWBC carries North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)

southward at the 2500 m level, while the southern DWBC carries Antarctic Bottom

Water (AABW) northward, offshore of and deeper than the NADW’s DWBC (Hogg

and Owens, 1999). Since DWBCs are the most energetic part of the deep circulation

(Talley et al., 2011), the deep flows are essentially meridional when averaged over a

long time. A schematic representation of this circulation is shown in Figure 4.2.

The present-day configuration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circu-

lation (AMOC) comprises two cells. The upper cell consists of surface warm waters

that flow northward, loose heat to the atmosphere in the northern North Atlantic, and



4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 23

sink as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), which travels southward around 3000

m of depth until ?40?S. The lower cell, in turn, is composed by the NADW flowing

southward, mixing with other water masses, upwelling near 50?S and sinking off the

Antarctic shelf as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which spreads northward up to the

equator (Johnson, 2008). The AMOC carries heat and freshwater across the Atlantic,

which is why it is intimately associated with the climate variability.

Figure 4.2: Simplified scheme of the modern Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(zonally averaged). The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) sinks in the northern North

Atlantic, travels southward, and upwells in the subtropical front, when it mixes with the newly
formed Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). From there, NADW can go northward, towards the
Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) formation region, or southward, becoming a part of the
AABW formation. AABW travels northward near the ocean bottom and eventually mixes with

NADW in its lower part.

The observation of this meridional circulation, however, is not easily done be-

cause of the difficulties in measuring the slow velocities in the ocean interior. Much

of what is known about the deep ocean circulation today has been inferred from the

distribution of sea water properties, especially temperature and salinity. This indi-

rect analysis is possible based on the concept that the properties of a certain parcel

of water are originally acquired at the ocean surface in its formation region. Since

temperature and salinity are considered to be fairly conservative properties (i.e., only

change at the surface), they function as a signature that allow us to trace the origin

(where the parcel intercepts the ocean surface) and dispersion of this water parcel.

Figure 4.3 shows the vertical salinity profile for the Atlantic obtained with data



4.1. PRESENT-DAY STRUCTURE OF THE DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION 24

from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE, http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/).

One can compare this profile with the schematic circulation provided in Figure 4.2 and

see that, indeed, salinity is a good tracer for water masses distribution.

Here we define water type and water mass following Tomczak and Large

(1989):

• Water type: a point in hydrographic parameter space (i.e., each hydrographic

property has a single value); it represents the original properties of the water

mass, acquired in its formation region (before mixing with other water masses);

• Water mass: collection of water parcels that have a common formation his-

tory; they are defined by their mean hydrographic properties plus a standard

deviation.

WOCE (http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/woce/).

Any water mass can be represented by a finite number of water types. In

other words, each water mass is characterized by small fluctuations around a prop-

erty extreme. The AABW, for example, has a temperature minimum signature, while

the NADW’s signature is a salinity maximum at depth. The Antarctic Intermediate

Water (AAIW) is characterized by a salinity minimum signature. NADW’s high salinity



4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 25

derives from Gulf of Mexico waters and from eddies that form from the Mediterranean

Sea overflow (both with high salinity as a result of the excess of evaporation over pre-

cipitation). The temperature minimum characteristic of AABW is due to the freezing

waters involved in the formation process of this water mass on the Antarctic conti-

nental shelf. AAIW has different formation theories, but its low salt content is either

associated with the fresher Pacific waters that enter the South Atlantic via the Drake

Passage or with the excess of precipitation over evaporation around 50?S.

4.2 Deep ocean circulation changes in the last 21,000

years

With a significant fraction of water stored in the form of ice, the oceans’ mean salinity

at the LGM was higher than today. Adkins et al. (2002) showed that, at this time, the

waters coming from the Southern Ocean filled the deep Atlantic basin and were char-

acterized by salinities of ? 35.8 compared to the current ?34.7. The increased salinity

is commonly attributed to the enhanced sea ice formation and extension 21,000 years

ago (Liu, 2005; Shin, 2003). Adkins (2013) points out another factor that could have

contributed to the elevated salinity: the warm deep water of northern origin was colder

at the LGM, which could have led to a reduced basal melting of ice shelves and, con-

sequently, a lack of freshwater input in the Southern Ocean waters. The increased

salinity of deep waters and the low temperatures of the ocean determined a distinct

dynamic behaviour compared to the present day one. At the LGM, the vertical ocean

movements were determined by differences in salinity rather than temperature (Ad-

kins et al., 2002), which happens today only in high latitudes or regions under the

influence of river runoff. The presence of salty waters near the bottom added to the

reduced vertical mixing rates (e.g. Adkins, 2013; Ferrari et al., 2014) resulted in a

highly stratified and stable ocean, which reduced the communication between the two

cells that compose the AMOC (Ferrari et al., 2014).

Due to the expansion of AABW at the LGM, the boundary between the south-



4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 26

ern and the northern water masses was around ? 2000 m (Figure 4.4), compared

to the average ?4000 m at present (Oppo and Lehman, 1993; Curry and Oppo,

2005; Ferrari et al., 2014). Back in the 1980s, some studies had already pointed

to a shoaling of the glacial version of NADW (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987; Duplessy

et al., 1988). Today, it is widely accepted that this shoaling indeed happened (e.g.,

Oppo and Lehman, 1993; Marchitto et al., 1998; Sarnthein et al., 2001; Curry and

Oppo, 2005; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2007; Praetorius et al.,

2008; Lippold et al., 2012), which led the scientific community to rename the early

NADW as Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW). Based on proxy data,

Boyle and Keigwin (1987) further suggested that GNAIW would have been colder and

fresher than NADW.

Figure 4.4: Simplified scheme of the glacial Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,
following the descriptions in Curry and Oppo (2005); Ferrari et al. (2014). The studies

suggest that the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) occupied most of the Atlantic basin during
the last glacial period, forming an almost closed lower cell — since the stratification was

stronger and the vertical mixing was reduced. In the intermediate layers, besides the
Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), there was an intermediate water mass formed in the

northern North Atlantic called Glacial Intermediate North Atlantic Water (GNAIW), that flowed
southward.

It is believed that the climate swings that followed the LGM were frequently

accompanied by changes in the ocean circulation (e.g., Broecker, 1994; McManus

et al., 2004; Praetorius et al., 2008). Proxy records show that during cold periods there

were reductions in the AMOC while the warm periods were marked by the AMOC’s



4.2. DEEP OCEAN CIRCULATION CHANGES IN THE LAST 21,000 YEARS 27

recovery (McManus et al., 2004; Came et al., 2008; Ritz et al., 2013, see more details

in section 5.1).

Concerning the AAIW, there is still some controversy about how much this

water mass penetrated into the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation. Some

studies suggest that AAIW could have reached as far north as 60?N (Rickaby and

Elderfield, 2005), while others believe this water mass did not reach the subtropical

North Atlantic (Xie et al., 2012). Also, the ?13C signature of AAIW in Makou et al.

(2010) points to a reduced contact with the atmosphere during glacial AAIW formation,

likely due to the presence of sea ice in the region.

The next three chapters present the results obtained from the analysis of

TraCE-21K data concerning the deep Atlantic Ocean circulation. Chapter 5 shows

the variability of the AMOC since the LGM and its associated heat and salt trans-

ports. Chapter 6 describes how the temperature and salinity fields changed during the

deglaciation. Chapter 7 presents the water masses distribution across the Atlantic in

different important periods. This chapter begins by describing the methodology used

to obtain the distribution of water masses — the mixing triangle technique, described

by Mamayev (1975).

CHAPTER 5

The Atlantic Ocean’s deglacial evolution:

Meridional transports

5.1 The AMOC

Either (or both) proxy and model data have been widely used in the effort to recon-

struct the geometry and strength of the AMOC at the LGM and on (e.g., Duplessy

et al., 1988; Yu et al., 1996; Shin et al., 2003; Paul and Schafer-Neth, 2003; Weaver

et al., 2003; McManus et al., 2004; Curry and Oppo, 2005; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2006;

Stouffer et al., 2006; Clauzet et al., 2007; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Otto-Bliesner

et al., 2007; Came et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Brady and Otto-Bliesner, 2010; Lip-

pold et al., 2012; Wainer et al., 2012; Ritz et al., 2013). The results of the numerous

studies are, however, far from unanimous. Some studies that used proxy records to

estimate the intensity of the AMOC point to a vigorous circulation (at least, as strong

as today) at the LGM (e.g. Yu et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 2010; Lippold et al., 2012).



5.1. THE AMOC 29

Others — sometimes using the same proxies as the studies just cited — interpret the

data as a sign of a slower AMOC (e.g. McManus et al., 2004; Negre et al., 2010). In a

comprehensive review of several proxy data, Lynch-Stieglitz et al. (2007) believe that

the middle path is the best bet: the AMOC was neither stronger nor much slower than

today. The authors point out that in several sediment cores no significant difference

was found between tracers deposited during the LGM and today, which is consistent

with a range of past circulation states (from a slight increase in the AMOC to a de-

crease of up to 30%). Either way, there seems to be a general agreement about the

relationship between AMOC intensity and D-O cycles: AMOC experienced a weaken-

ing during Heinrich Stadials (more intense during the H1 than during the YD), followed

by rapid increases concurrent with regional warming events during the last deglacia-

tion (McManus et al., 2004; Stanford et al., 2006; Gherardi et al., 2009; Bohm et al.,

2014).

Here, TraCE-21K data point to an intensified AMOC at the LGM (Figure

5.1(a)). The upper cell of the overturning is homogeneously strong in both hemi-

spheres while the lower cell shows a vigorous Southern Hemisphere circulation, as-

sociated with the intensified AABW formation, occupying most of the deep Atlantic

basin. During the H1 (Figure 5.1(b)), the intensified lower cell is still present with the

maximum transport of 8–10 Sv confined south of 25?S. The upper cell changes signif-

icantly, becoming consistently weaker in both hemispheres. The maximum transport

(?10 Sv) at about 1000 m at the LGM is significantly reduced in H1 (max ?4 Sv).

During the BA (Figure 5.1(c)) and MPW-1A (Figure 5.1(d)), the deeper circulation of

the lower cell weakens while the upper cell intensifies. In the BA, there is an inten-

sification of about 4–6 Sv centered at 1000 m between 20–40?N that is not seen in

Figure 5.1(d). The Antarctic Bottom Water picks up again during YD, which is respon-

sible for the re-intensification of the lower cell of the meridional overturning (Figure

5.1(e)), while the upper cell is weakened –– except in the upper few hundred meters

centered at 20?N. The configuration of the meridional overturning for the Holocene is

shown in Figure 5.1(f).



5.1. THE AMOC 30

Liu et al. (2009), analyzing the TraCE-21K AMOC variability from the LGM

to the BA, found that the BA warming is a response to the sudden interruption of

meltwater flux in the North Atlantic at 14.67 ka. This interruption stimulated AMOC

to recover and get back to its glacial state (?12.5 Sv, increasing Greenland SAT by

?5?C) and overshoot (to 19 Sv, contributing to rise the temperature by other 10?C; Liu

et al., 2009). The authors explain that the overshoot could be caused by convective

instability in the Nordic Sea added to a deep-ocean warming scenario. He (2011)

points out that the rate and final amplitude of the AMOC resumption is dependent

on the history of meltwater forcing, with faster recovery and larger AMOC overshoot

in cases where the meltwater discharge took longer to cease. Moreover, Liu et al.

(2009) note that there is almost a linear dependence of Greenland SAT variations on

AMOC strength, supporting that AMOC is essential for the temperature control during

the deglaciation.

The results suggest that, in CCSM3, the AMOC has multiple equilibria and

goes from one state to the other through meltwater discharges onto the ocean surface.

transports at six different periods: (a) LGM, (b) H1, (c) BA, (d) MWP-1A, (e) YD, and (f)

Holocene. Figure from Marson et al. (2014).



5.2. MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 31

5.2 Meridional heat and salt transport

In contrast to the Pacific Ocean, where the heat is transported from the equator to

the poles, the meridional heat transport in the South Atlantic is directed northward.

This happens because the upper branch of the AMOC carries warm surface layer

waters northward to compensate for the outflow of cold waters from the deep North

Atlantic (Seidov and Maslin, 2001). Therefore, studying the South Atlantic circulation

is instrumental to fully understand the Earth’s climate system.

The meridional heat transport was calculated as in Bryan (1962) through a

section of the Atlantic basin, using the equation 5.1.

Qt =

0?
5000m

20W?
70W

cp ?? v dxdz (5.1)

where Qt is the meridional heat transport, cp is the sensible heat of seawater,

? is seawater density, v is the meridional velocity and ? is the potential temperature.

The meridional salt transport was calculated in the same way, simply substituting cp?

by S, where S is the salinity of seawater.

The northern ocean heat transport (NOHT) for the South Atlantic (0–30?S) is

shown in Figure 5.2(a) (purple curve). Apart from the cold LGM period, positive val-

ues – which indicate northward transport – coincide with warm periods in the Northern

Hemisphere. A sharp increase of the NOHT at ?14.7 ka (which coincides with the

Bølling–Allerød (BA) warming in the north) is evident. The heat transport is higher at

LGM than at modern times, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the AMOC

was stronger at 21 ka as discussed by Shin (2003) and Clauzet et al. (2007). Near-

zero and negative meridional heat transport are associated with the Northern Hemi-

sphere cooling relative to the H1 and Younger Dryas (YD) events, while the temper-

ature increases in the Southern Hemisphere. After 11 ka, the heat transport values

show a steady, small rise to about 0.25-0.3 PW until about 6 ka after which it remains

practically constant at that level, indicating a stable equilibrium at the same time that

the meltwater pulses are shutdown in the simulation.

21,000 years. Figure from Marson et al. (2014).



5.2. MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 33

The NOHT as a function of latitude averaged for each of the key millenial

events in the simulation is shown in Figure 5.2(b). NOHT has a maximum in the

North Atlantic in the tropics, centered at 20?N for the LGM and BA. This maximum

shifts a few degrees north for the MWP-1A period. For the YD and Holocene, the

maximum northward transport is at about 25?S and 30?S, respectively. The changes

in magnitude of the NOHT between the periods are related to air–sea interaction in

the tropics as discussed by Cheng et al. (2007). They discuss the AMOC slowdown,

the related NOHT and the mechanisms for the high-latitude tropical coupling through

freshwater perturbation experiments. In the South Atlantic, with exception of the YD,

the transport is northward, largest at LGM, decreasing nonlinearly at BA and MWP-1A

and very small for H1 and the Holocene.

The northward ocean salt transport (NOST) as a function of latitude is shown

in Figure 5.2(c). The NOST between the key millenial events shows its maximum

values between 30–40?N with a secondary maximum at 10?S. In the North Atlantic,

the ocean salt transport is southward for all periods (except the Holocene) from the

Equator to about 20?N, after which it becomes poleward until 60?N, when it reverts to

southward. The strongest NOST is during H1, followed by BA, LGM and YD. During

the Holocene with the exception of a small, albeit positive, NOST at about 38?N, all

the salt transport is southward. In the South Atlantic, there is northward salt transport

at H1, BA and LGM, which is reversed southward at YD and Holocene.

The relationship between the TraCE-21K meridional heat transport and the

meridional salt transport (Figure 5.2(a), green curve) shows an out-of-phase behavior

between the two time series. This is best illustrated by the scatter diagram in Figure

5.3. It shows that the negative correlations between heat and salt transport are high

before and after the BA warming period (circles with a correlation coefficient (r) of

-0.99, and triangles with r = -0.93, respectively). During the transition from approxi-

mately 14.7 ka to 12.9 ka, the correlation diminishes (but is still significant; Fig. 5.3,

crosses with r = -0.79) due to the reorganization of the deep ocean structure. The

different slopes of the circle and triangle clusters in Fig. 5.3 indicate that, overall, the



5.2. MERIDIONAL HEAT AND SALT TRANSPORT 34

transport exhibits two regimes: a large heat and small salt transport before BA and a

small heat and large salt transport especially after YD (greenish to reddish tones).

Figure 5.3: Scatter diagram showing negative correlation between heat and salt transport in
South Atlantic (30–0?S). The circles represent the data for the period that precede the

Bølling–Allerød event; the crosses stand for the BA period; and the triangles show data from
Younger Dryas on. The colors stand for time evolution, according to the color bar on the right.

Figure from Marson et al. (2014).

If we consider the salt transport via water masses, the AABW fills the Atlantic

basin from LGM to BA due to the limited extension of GNAIW. After that, the devel-

oping NADW starts transporting salt southward, and at the same time there is more

heat being transported to the north (as in Seidov and Maslin, 2001). The same is true

for AABW at the beginning of the simulation (more glacial AABW means export of salt

northward and more heat southward). The increase or decrease in NOHT and NOST

is related to the location of the prescribed freshwater fluxes. For example, the MWP-

1A that discharged the equivalent of 15 m/kyr of freshwater into the Southern Ocean,

where the AABW is formed, would cause its North Atlantic counterpart to transport

salt southward more intensely. According to Seidov and Maslin (2001), for example, a

stronger NADW is associated with increased northward heat transport, and more salt

transported to the south, leading to an inverse correlation.

CHAPTER 6

The Atlantic Ocean’s deglacial evolution:

Thermohaline characteristics

T
HE analysis of the Atlantic’s salinity and temperature fields reveals changes

in its water masses that occurred in the transient simulation. As we will

see, several of those changes agree with proxy reconstructions discussed

in section 4.2. We begin presenting the salinity vertical sections, since salinity is

a good tracer of the vertical distribution of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean (as

mentioned in section 4.1).

The Atlantic Ocean at LGM (Figure 6.1(a)) was much more stratified than to-

day (e.g. Adkins et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2014) with the dense (and salty) AABW oc-

cupying much of the deep basin, as discussed before. During the H1 (Figure 6.1(b)),

the slow and continuous freshwater inflow into the North Atlantic reduces the GNAIW

formation with a significant freshening of the upper 1000 m accompanied by a drop

in the total ocean heat transport (e.g., Figure 5.2(a)). In Stanford et al. (2011), they



36

infer, from proxy data, a slowdown of northern sourced water formation from 19 to

17.5 ka. The H1 meltwater discharge is interrupted at 14.67 ka when the North At-

lantic circulation recovers (Figure 6.1(c)). The deep ocean (below 500m) is fresher.

The H1 changes in ocean circulation have been associated with atmospheric CO2

changes (Menviel et al., 2014). It is suggested that an enhanced AABW could have

been responsible for 30% of the atmospheric CO2 increase. Between 14.35 and 13.85

ka (Figure 6.1(d)), the freshwater source in the Southern Ocean is activated (and re-

activated in the Northern Hemisphere) in the model. A freshening of most of the upper

1000 m in both the North and South Atlantic can be observed. Even though this event

is of much shorter duration in the model, its magnitude is about 4 times greater in the

Southern Ocean (maximum of 60 m/kyr) than the meltwater flux in the North Atlantic

at H1 (maximum of 15 m/kyr). The AABW is suppressed and only recovers at the YD

(Figure 6.1(e)), when the North Atlantic receives a new iceberg discharge that slows

down the AMOC. The opening of the Bering Strait at 12.9 ka in TraCE-21K contributes

to a further weakening of the AMOC through meltwater transport from the Pacific to

the Nordic seas (He, 2011). As soon as the freshwater flux from the North Atlantic

is interrupted around 11.7 ka, the heat transport towards the north is re-established.

The salinity barrier, which was responsible for the high stratification in the simulation

initial condition, was continuously eroded and the dense water that was confined to

the surface and intermediate layers (GNAIW) can finally sink and become NADW.

During the Holocene (Figure 6.1(f)), the features of the modern NADW are in place

and the model results compare well (albeit with very different spatial resolution) with

observed data from the WOCE (Figure 4.3).

Examining the differences in the vertical salinity profile between H1 and LGM,

BA and H1, MPW-1A and BA, YD and MWP-1A and Holocene and YD (Figure 6.2)

helps in understanding the changes in the ocean structure between the different pe-

riods. The Atlantic basin is considerably fresher at H1 when compared to the LGM

(Figure 6.2(a)). The largest differences are in the North Atlantic in the upper 1000 m

with maximum values in the upper 200 m. The subtropical South Atlantic in the upper

800–900 m is saltier in H1 compared to LGM. This is because the prolonged freshen-

ing was entirely in the North Atlantic with the residual LGM saltiness remaining in the

southern subtropics’ upper ?800–900 m. Figure 6.2(b) shows the salinity differences

between H1 and BA when the GNAIW recovers, which is seen by the positive salinity

difference in most of the North Atlantic in the upper 1000 m, reaching the equator in

the surface layers. The impact of MWP-1A with respect to BA is observed in Figure

6.2(c) with a basin-wide freshening. Comparing the salinity differences between the

YD event with MWP-1A (Figure 6.2(d)) shows a similar distribution to Figure 6.2(a),

except that the deeper ocean is significantly fresher. The upper 500 m displays a

saltier South Atlantic and a fresh North Atlantic, indicating a weaker North Atlantic

dense water formation. This structure finally evolves into the opposite structure, with

the newly formed NADW that is able to spread into the Southern Hemisphere as seen

today.

The changes in temperature across the Atlantic are not so visible as the salin-

ity changes when we look at Figure 6.3. What we can see is that the temperatures

became higher — especially between 500 and 3000 m — as time evolved. When

we observe the temperature differences between the main climatic periods (Figure



39

(22 ka–19 ka); (b) BA (14.67 ka–14.35 ka) and H1 (19 ka–14.67 ka); (c) MWP-1A (14.35

6.4), however, the changes are clearer. During the H1 (Figure 6.4(a)), the first hun-

dred meters cool down in the NH due to the discharge of cold meltwater. Below

that, the temperature increase since the freshwater layer isolates the ocean from the

atmosphere, trapping the heat in the ocean. The South Atlantic also warms up, re-

flecting the continuous warming in the SH during this period. From the H1 to the BA

(Figure 6.4(b)), there is a general temperature rise trend, except for the tropics’ first

five hundred meters. The warming is more accentuated in the upper layers of NH,

possibly in response to the abrupt BA warming observed in the North Atlantic. It is

possible to distinguish this warmer water flowing southward around 1500 m, indicating

GNAIW/NADW warming. The temperature response to the MWP-1A is quite different

(Figure 6.4(c)). The large meltwater pulse in both hemispheres cause the intermedi-

ate layers to cool down. Additionally, the AABW’s temperature rise because the heat

that was supposed to scape to atmosphere in southern high latitudes is trapped by

the stable freshwater layer around Antarctica. When this freshwater layer dissipates,

the AABW cools down again and the intermediate layers’ temperature increases (Fig-

ure 6.4(d)). Also, due to new meltwater discharges during the YD, some cooling is

observed in the North Atlantic in Figure 6.4(d). The changes in temperature after YD



40

(Figure 6.4(e)) are very similar to the ones observed after the H1 (Figure 6.4(b)). This

resemblance shows the ocean consistent response to D-O cycles since both H1 and

YD were cold periods followed by rapid warming events. Nevertheless, the warming

in NADW’s tongue is stronger during the Holocene.

In order to see salinity and temperature changes together, these fields are

plotted in a ? ? S diagram shown in Figure 6.5. The points are an average between

30?S and 0?from the LGM (blue points) to 0 ka (red points). The choice of this par-

ticular latitude range (30?S - 0?) is based on the fact that the NADW only assumes

an unified thermohaline characteristic in the South Atlantic, while in the North Atlantic

this water mass is still divided in its precursors. It can be observed that there is a

shift of the curve towards lower salinities throughout the entire water column, which

is expected given all the freshwater entering the Atlantic Ocean in the last 21 000 yr.

The changes in the shape of the ? ?S curve for the different periods are significant:

the ? ? S curve at 21 ka has only two deep water types, while the modern curve (0

ka) presents the three main Atlantic Ocean deep water masses (AAIW, NADW and

AABW, as in Figure 6.5(a)). The water type that specifies the NADW characteristics

(salinity maximum at ?2500 m) does not appear until the early Holocene. The ? ?S

plots considering the same latitudinal interval for the South Atlantic, averaged for 21

ka, 15 ka, 14.1 ka, 13 ka and 0 ka, are shown in Figure 6.5(b). It is, again, clear that

the deep salinity maximum characteristic of the NADW within the South Atlantic starts

to develop only after 14.1 ka (Figure 6.5(b), pink curve).

The absence of the NADW during the glacial period is consistent with proxy

records (Adkins et al., 2002). Also, the weaker dense water production in the NH

during YD is discussed by several studies based on proxy data (Boyle and Keigwin,

1987; Hughen et al., 1998; Praetorius et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2010). Through

231Pa/230Th ratio analysis, Negre et al. (2010) – as well as the modeling study of

Wainer et al. (2012) – argue that the modern Atlantic circulation was only fully estab-

lished during the Holocene, which is also consistent with the evolution of the salinity-

based water mass structure presented in Figure 6.1. The establishment of the NADW

as the main southward component of the AMOC induced the change in the over-

turning circulation geometry. The AMOC became deeper, meridional heat transport

became more stable and the NADW became the main salt exporter across the At-

lantic Ocean. Hence, the steep triangle cluster on Figure 5.3 (page 34) is explained:

a smaller variability of the heat transport northwards and larger salt transport south-

wards in the Holocene.

CHAPTER 7

The Atlantic Ocean’s deglacial evolution:

Water masses distribution

7.1 The mixing triangle technique

Mamayev (1975) explains how one can retrieve information about ocean water masses

from a temperature-salinity analysis. The first step is to plot potential temperature (y-

axis) against salinity (x-axis) - the ??S diagram. Let us start with a simplified example

illustrated in Figure 7.1. Consider two water types A and B, with potential tempera-

tures ?A and ?B and salinities SA and SB, respectively, represented by the blue circles

in Figure 7.1. The dashed line between the two points represents the linear mixing

between A and B, i.e., any parcel of water with thermohaline properties that falls within

the line is the result of a mixing between A and B. The closer the water parcel is to

A, the more A contributes to the formation of the water parcel - and similarly for water

type B. As an example, the red cross in Figure 7.1 stands for a water parcel formed



7.1. THE MIXING TRIANGLE TECHNIQUE 43

by the mixing of 20% of A and 80% of B.

Figure 7.1: Mixing between two hypothetical water masses A and B.

Mathematically, we can find how much of each water type contributes to the

properties of the water parcel through the equation set (7.1).

????????
???????
? = mA?A + mB?B

S = mASA + mBSB

1 = mA + mB

(7.1)

where

? = potential temperature of the water parcel

S = salinity of the water parcel

mA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing

mB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing

0 &amp;lt;(mA , mB) &amp;lt;1

Now, if we include one more water type (C, with potential temperature ?C and

salinity SC) in our ? ? S diagram, we will have a mixing triangle instead of a mixing



7.1. THE MIXING TRIANGLE TECHNIQUE 44

line. In the illustrated example (Figure 7.2), the water parcel whose thermohaline

properties are indicated by the red cross is formed by 10% of A, 60% of B, and 30%

of C. In order to find each water type percentage, follow the lines parallel to triangle’s

side that opposes the desired vertex.

Figure 7.2: Mixing between three hypothetical water masses A, B, and C.

The equation system for three water types is:

????????
???????
? = mA?A + mB?B + mC?C

S = mASA + mBSB + mCSC

1 = mA + mB + mC

(7.2)

where

? = potential temperature of the water parcel

S = salinity of the water parcel

mA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing

mB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing

mC = fraction of the water type C contributing to the mixing

0 &amp;lt;(mA , mB , mC) &amp;lt;1



7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE
TECHNIQUE 45

Therefore, with the known thermohaline values of each water type given by

the literature, we can determine how much each of them is present at any point of the

ocean (where the potential temperature ? and salinity S are observed) by simply solv-

ing the system 7.2 and finding mA, mB, and mC (assuming that the mixing between

them is linear).

7.2 Issues and their solutions within the mixing trian-

gle technique

Now, consider the ??S diagrams prepared with TraCE-21K data (Figure 7.3). As we

can see, many of the blue circles that represent water parcels do not fall within the

triangle. In the classic mixing triangle technique described above, this would mean a

negative contribution of some water type, which is physically impossible. This issue is

addressed by doing modifications to the system of equations 7.2. The altered form of

the system is:

????????
???????
? = mA?A + mB?B + mC?C + ??

S = mASA + mBSB + mCSC + ?S

1 = mA + mB + mC + ?mass

(7.3)

where

? = potential temperature of the water parcel

S = salinity of the water parcel

mA = fraction of the water type A contributing to the mixing

mB = fraction of the water type B contributing to the mixing

mC = fraction of the water type C contributing to the mixing

??, ?S, ?mass = residuals

7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE

The system is then solved in a nonnegative least-squares sense, i.e., the set

of mx (x=A,B,C) is found by minimizing E, where

E = ?2? + ?

S + ?

mass (7.4)

with mx ? 0.

Additionally, in the "real" world a typical ? ? S diagram has more than three

water types. Consider the TraCE-21K ? ? S diagrams for the Atlantic basin shown

in Figure 7.3. The small circles represent the thermohaline properties of each point

inside the Atlantic basin at a given time — the light blue ones are parcels located in

the South Atlantic and the dark blue ones are parcels located in the North Atlantic.

The red squares stand for the approximate thermohaline indexes of five different water

types: Central Waters (CW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Glacial North At-

lantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW), North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic

Bottom Water (AABW). Notice that only four of those appear at each time. With four

water types it is not possible to construct a single mixing triangle. Thus, we solved this

issue by constructing two triangles adjacent to each other, as indicated by the dashed

green lines in Figure 7.3. If we determine in which triangle each point belongs, the

mixing can be calculated normally.

Here, we have to assume that the water types CW and GNAIW (from 21 ka to

14 ka)/AABW (from 12 ka to 0 ka) do not mix because they do not occur in the same

triangle. The assumption of no-mixing between CW and AABW is safe because they

are separated by layers of intermediate and deep waters. On the other hand, the

mixing between CW and GNAIW can happen in the North Atlantic because they are

in contact. As we will see below, not considering the CW-GNAIW mix results in a

false signal of AAIW and AABW dominance in the northern North Atlantic in the first

1500 m, where GNAIW should have larger contributions. We address this problem

by presenting an alternative result for GNAIW distribution. This alternative result was

generated using a mixing triangle for the North Atlantic only, which is reasonable

since most of GNAIW does not cross the equator in TraCE-21K, as we could see

ka (top left), 14 ka (top right), 12 ka (bottom left) and 0 ka (bottom right). The light (dark) blue
circles represent points in the South (North) Atlantic. The red squares mark the endmembers

of the mixing triangle, i.e., the water types: Central Waters (CW), Antarctic Intermediate
Water (AAIW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water

(GNAIW), and North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The dashed green lines define the
boundaries of the mixing triangles. The inserts in the upper left corners of the upper panels

show the alternative configuration of the triangle to determine GNAIW’s distribution.

in a previous analysis of the data (Marson et al., 2014). Thus, the triangle vertices

are placed at CW, GNAIW, and AABW water types (see small plots in the upper

panels of Figure 7.3). This way, we allow CW and GNAIW mixing but we cut the

communication between the hemispheres. As one can see, the method of mixing

triangles is simplistic and should be replaced by other methods, such as the Optimum

MultiParameter analysis (OMP, Tomczak and Large, 1989) if a more complex analysis

is required as well as more data (e.g., inorganic nutrients) is available.

Another issue we faced when working with paleoclimatic data is that the

known present-day (?,S) pair of each water type does not apply at 21,000 years ago,



7.2. ISSUES AND THEIR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE MIXING TRIANGLE
TECHNIQUE 48

because the ocean was significantly different when compared to its modern state. Be-

sides, one cannot fix the thermohaline properties for the whole deglacial run due to

the large changes the ocean goes through during this interval. Therefore, the (?,S)

pair of each water type was calculated every 1,000 years (plotted in Figures 7.4 to

7.7 below), taking into account its general features, formation region, and the approx-

imate vertical distribution of the water masses observed in the Figure 6.1. We could

thus determine:

• Central Waters (CW), by averaging five points with the highest temperatures

between 20-40?N (North Atlantic Central Water, NACW) and 20-40?S (South

Atlantic Central Water, SACW) between 250 and 500 m;

• Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), by averaging five points with the lowest

salinities between 40 and 50?S, 250 to 500 m depth;

• Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), by averaging five points with the lowest tem-

peratures between 60 and 70?S, 1500 to 5000 m depth; and

• North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), by averaging the five points with the high-

est salinities and low temperatures (less than 3.5?C), when those salinities

were greater than the AABW salinity. The region considered was between 40

and 80?N, 1500 to 5000 m depth.

Before averaging the five points which determine each water type, we re-

moved points in the ??S diagram that were two standard deviations larger (or smaller)

than the mean. Since in the mixing triangle analysis we could consider up to four wa-

ter masses at the same time, we choose to eliminate SACW and approximate Central

Waters in the entire Atlantic by NACW. The choice seems suitable since our interest

is on denser water masses.

We saw in the previous chapter that the NADW signal does not appear in the

simulation until 12 ka. As mentioned above, the literature indicates that in place of

NADW there was Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) at glacial peri-

ods. From Figure 7.3 (upper left panel), we observe an additional endmember within



7.3. RESULTS 49

the North Atlantic points. Tracing those points to the geographical region where they

belong, we think this endmember indeed represents GNAIW. Therefore, we deter-

mined GNAIW thermohaline properties by averaging the 5 points with lowest salin-

ities which had corresponding lowest temperatures, between 40 and 80?N, 400

to 1500 m depth. As we can see in the ? ? S diagrams (Figure 7.3), GNAIW water

type is close to AAIW water type, and they become more similar as the deglaciation

progresses.

In the next section, we will present the evolution of the water types’ (?,S)

and the fractions m of the water types contribution to each point in the Atlantic. The

fractions m are shown in vertical sections and horizontal maps. We chose four partic-

ular periods (21 ka, 14 ka, 12 ka, and 0 ka) to illustrate the range of ocean circulation

changes seen in the last 21,000 years. In the maps, the white patches indicate ei-

ther that there is no data in that region (due to bathymetry or coarse resolution of the

coasts) or that the error E (given by equation 7.4) exceeded the value we considered

reasonable. This value was calculated considering a residual of 0.001 for salinity

(?S=0.001) and mass (?m=0.001), and a residual of 0.01 for temperature (??=0.01).

For the presented results, the main area in which the points exceeded this threshold

was the Mediterranean Sea.

7.3 Results

7.3.1 Evolution of the water types’ properties

The evolution of the potential temperature of the North Atlantic and South Atlantic

Central Waters (NACW and SACW, respectively) shows an out-of-phase relation from

the LGM to 13 ka (Figure 7.4, upper panel). The NACW (dark blue line) cooled from

20 to 17 ka (H1 period), and then warmed until 15 ka, when it reached a peak at the

onset of BA. A new cooling followed until 13 ka, after which the temperatures slowly

rose to Holocene levels. In the South Atlantic, SACW’s temperature began to warm

at 20 ka (light blue line) and showed a short cooling from 16 to 15 ka. After that,



7.3. RESULTS 50

SACW restarted to warm. From 22 to 17 ka, SACW’s salinity increased (Figure 7.4,

lower panel, orange line) while NACW’s salinity decreased in response to meltwater

input from H1 (red line). SACW’s salinity had a negative peak around 14 ka, before

reaching Holocene levels at 8 ka. Its northern counterpart has two peaks between

the LGM and present day — one in at the onset of the BA and the other is in the early

Holocene. A major drop in NACW’s salinity separate these two peaks at 13 ka.

Figure 7.4: Potential temperature and salinity evolution of Central Waters. The orange and
light blue lines represent SACW while the red and dark blue ones represent NACW.

Figure 7.5: Potential temperature and salinity evolution of Antarctic Intermediate Water

The AAIW’s temperature evolved from ?0.8?C at 22 ka to ?3.2?C at present

day (Figure 7.5, upper panel). The period with higher increase rates coincide with the



7.3. RESULTS 51

H1. The salinity trend is opposite to the temperature, decreasing from ?35.1 to ?34.5

throughout the simulation (Figure 7.5, lower panel). Embedded in this monotonic

freshening, there is a negative peak at 14 ka, associated with MWP-1A.

Although the changes in AABW’s thermohaline properties are relatively smooth

due the stable conditions in the abyssal ocean, the curves in Figure 7.6 show a large

difference between the glacial AABW and the modern one. AABW’s temperature

starts at ?-2.5?C and ends up at ?-1.4?C. The warming is almost monotonic except

for a peak coincident with the meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), around 14 ka. The salin-

ity decreases gradually from ?37.3 to ?35.2 during the simulation run. AABW’s core

remains near the bottom throughout the run.

Figure 7.7 shows the evolution of the properties of NADW and its precursor

GNAIW. GNAIW’s temperature at the beginning of the run was nearly as cold as

modern AABW. The temperature increases from 19 to 14 ka, when it gives its place

to NADW. NADW’s temperature increased between 12 and 11 ka and then remains

approximately constant (around 3?C) until 0 ka. GNAIW’s salinity at the LGM (?35.9)

is similar to NADW’s after 8 ka. After 20 ka, the GNAIW freshens about one unit until

14 ka, except for a slight peak at 15 ka. At 12 ka, NADW’s salinity is very close to

AABW’s salinity, and this probably is the reason why it is difficult to tell them apart

in a salinity vertical section before 11 ka (as we saw in the previous chapter). The

core depths of both water types are quite distinct: around 500 m for GNAIW and 2500

m for NADW. The GNAIW/NADW points at 13 ka are absent in Figure 7.7 because

the method could not find either water type. Even if there is some water mass being

formed in the North Atlantic at this time, its properties possibly coincide with a linear

combination of the other water types and, therefore, cannot be separated.

We can see on the ??S diagrams (Figure 7.3) that the thermohaline indexes

(i.e., temperature and salinity) found for each water type represent well the mixing

triangles endmembers. NADW’s and AABW’s salinities at the present time (0 ka),

however, are overestimated by the model when compared to observations (Talley

et al., 2011).

7.3.2 Spatial contribution of analyzed water masses in the At-

lantic Ocean

Figure 7.8 shows the contribution of CW to the water column along the Atlantic (on

25?W) calculated through the mixing triangle method described above. During all the

simulation, contributions of this water mass are restrict to less than 1000 m of depth.

If we examine the horizontal structure of the CW distribution (Figure 7.9), we can see

that the Central Waters concentrate in the middle of the subtropical gyres, especially

the northern one - since we used NACW water type to represent Central Waters in

general. The CW contribution is largest (?60%) at around 600 m and diminishes as

we go down on the water column. The patterns of spatial distribution do not change

much through the simulation.

The transect along 25?W for AAIW is presented in Figure 7.10. The highest

contributions are seen around 40?S, although some signal appears around 40 to 60

?N at 21 and 14 ka. The spatial patterns of AAIW distribution show a decreasing

contribution north of 40?S. The band of higher percentages around ?40?S is weaker

at H1 (Figure 7.12) and YD (Figure 7.11). The north latitude signal discussed before

is present in the maps around the subpolar gyre and Nordic Seas. This is probably the

undesired result of the GNAIW-CW no-mixing assumption mentioned before. AAIW

percentages are reduced as we go deeper through the water column.

Antarctic Bottom Water contributions are high through most of the Atlantic

Ocean from 21 to 14 ka (Figure 7.13, upper panels). The contributions diminish to-

ward the surface, except for the southern band from 80?S to 60?S. At 21 ka the per-

centages are smaller from 40?N to 60?N too, forming a "blob" of lower contributions

(as indicated by the arrow in Figure 7.13, upper left panel). A big change is seen from

14 to 12 ka, when AABW contributions drop to nearly zero northward of 40?S and

above 3000 m. From this point on, the AABW distribution pattern remains generally

the same.

In the spatial maps (Figure 7.14, see below), higher percentages of AABW

dominate the latitudes south of ?50?S at ?600 m, and the values increase toward the

bottom. From Figure7.14 (upper panels) there is a rise of percentages around and

at the center of the subpolar gyre in the North Atlantic in the upper 1500 m, which

is probably caused by the no-mixing assumption between CW and GNAIW that we

mentioned in section 7.2. After 13 ka (Figure 7.14, lower panels), higher contributions

are present near the bottom throughout the Atlantic and almost nothing is found north

of 50?S at deep and intermediate depths.

Within the original triangle configurations, the highest contributions of GNAIW

at 21 ka are located in the upper 2000 m of the North Atlantic (?40?N, Figure 7.15,

upper left panel). When we consider the mixing between CW and GNAIW in the

alternative triangle (small plots in Figure 7.3), the GNAIW distribution is larger (see



7.4. DISCUSSION 57

below Figure 7.17, left panels) and occupies the intermediate levels as south as 20?N.

Because GNAIW’s (?,S) are similar to AAIW’s (?,S), the high percentages between

the equator and 20?N are possibly related to AAIW’s spreading beyond the equator

at the LGM. From 12 ka to the present day, the vertical distribution of NADW does

not change much and its core dominates depths around 2000 to 3000 m from high

northern latitudes to ?40?S (Figure 7.15, lower panels).

The horizontal distribution of GNAIW shows the highest percentages in the

Nordic Seas and lower ones in the subpolar gyre (Figure 7.16, upper left panel and

Figure 7.17, upper right maps). The GNAIW contributions at 14 ka disappear in Figure

7.16 (upper right panel), and are not significant south of 60?N in Figure 7.17. The

NADW shows a very different horizontal distribution, with high concentrations south

of Greenland at ?600 m and throughout the deep ocean down to the Southwestern

Atlantic (Figure 7.16, lower left panel). A quasi-latitudinal band of higher contributions

appears around 40?S at ?600 m. The spatial patterns do not vary significantly from

12 ka to 0ka (Figure 7.16, lower panels), except by a slight decrease in NADW’s

contribution at the 1500 m layer of the subtropics. This decrease is probably related

to the deepening of NADW’s core after 8 ka, also observed in Figure 7.7 (bottom).

7.4 Discussion

From the time series of the CW temperature (Figure 7.4, upper panel), we observe

that these waters seem to capture the surface temperature signal of each hemi-

sphere (Figure 7.18, top). The out-of-phase pattern between north and south has

been known in the literature as the "bipolar seesaw" (Broecker, 1998). The North

Atlantic cooled during H1 and YD, while the southern counterpart cooled during BA.

CW salinities also connect with the surface, reflecting the net balance between pre-

cipitation and evaporation (Figure 7.18, middle) and the meltwater fluxes (Figure 7.18,

bottom).

A higher contribution of CW for the subtropical gyres’ center (maps in Figure

occupy most of their pycnoclines (Talley et al., 2011).

The AAIW’s temperature evolves quite monotonically (Figure 7.5, upper panel).



7.4. DISCUSSION 59

Figure 7.17: Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water contribution (%) from the alternative
triangle. The left panels show the vertical distribution below 500 m, along 25?W, while the

right panels show the horizontal distribution in the North Atlantic.

From 22 to 16ka, the temperature increase in AAIW could be aligned with the early

warming in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Barker et al., 2009). The salinities, in

turn, accompany the overall freshening trend in the Atlantic Ocean, with a sudden

drop associated with MWP-1A.

The AAIW also seems to be well represented in its spatial distribution (Figure

7.11). The band of high contribution values coincides with the typical position of

the Subantarctic Front, which is the region that surface waters are subducted and

transported northward in intermediate layers (Deacon, 1937). Although this is the

hypothesis of AAIW formation that we consider here, there are other studies that point

to either the southeast Pacific (McCartney, 1977) or Brazil-Malvinas confluence in the

southwest Atlantic (Piola and Gordon, 1989). In some cases, the low salinity water

formed in the circumpolar region is called Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW). From

this band located around 40?S, AAIW spreads northward and gradually mixes with

other water masses. The attributed contribution of AAIW to the northern subpolar gyre

is related do the similarities between its low salinity and fresh GNAIW. This indicates

that the mixing triangle method cannot distinguish perfectly both water masses in the

Northern Hemisphere.

The lower contributions of AAIW during the H1 (Figure 7.12) and YD (Fig-

ure 7.11) raises the question about the northward expansion of AAIW during the last

deglaciation. The subject is still controversial. There are some studies which suggest

there was an increase in the northward penetration of AAIW during the cold events

(e.g., Pahnke et al., 2008; Thornalley et al., 2011), resulting in its presence up to

60?N. However, other investigators believe the opposite: AAIW would have been ac-



7.4. DISCUSSION 61

tually weaker during those periods (Came et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2012). Our results,

therefore, seem to agree with the second hypothesis.

During the last deglaciation, the freshwater resulting from the melting of ice

sheets — both from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres — led to a gradual

decrease of the Antarctic Bottom Water’s salinity (as we saw in chapter 6; Figure 7.6,

lower panel). The small increase of AABW’s temperature accompanied the general

climate warming trend, and is similar to its freshening — fairly gradual —, except for

the small peak at 14 ka (Figure 7.6, upper panel). This peak results from the presence

of freshwater at the surface during the MWP-1A, which increases the vertical stability

of the water column and, consequently, does not allow the heat brought at depth from

the north to escape. The same behavior was observed by Richardson et al. (2005) in

their model study about responses to a freshwater input in the Southern Ocean.

Using the methodology presented, we could identify GNAIW water type char-

acteristics up to 14 ka (Figure 7.7). We found that GNAIW was a cold and relatively

fresh water mass (when compared to glacial AABW), as suggested by Boyle and Keig-

win (1987). These characteristics make GNAIW very similar to AAIW in the (?,S)

domain, especially as the deglaciation advances in time. Interestingly, after 13 ka,

the fresh "tail" that stands for GNAIW in the North Atlantic ? ? S diagram assumes

a position similar to the one that Labrador Sea Water occupies in a modern ? ? S

diagram.

The LGM GNAIW’s salinity (Figure 7.7, orange line in the middle panel) is

similar to modern NADW (Figure 7.7, red line in the middle panel) and was progres-

sively reduced during the H1. It seems that after 16 ka the GNAIW’s salinity trend was

heading toward NADW’s salinity values, but it was interrupted by a freshening at 14

ka. Because the ocean waters that mix with the meltwater released during MWP-1A

share GNAIW’s characteristics, it is hard to distinguish them around 14 ka. This would

explain the reduction of GNAIW salinity at 14 ka (Figure 7.7, orange line) and also the

presence of a small amount of a GNAIW-like water mass in the Southern Ocean (Fig-

to 10 ka, separating the cold GNAIW at the beginning of the last deglaciation from the

warm and stable NADW during the Holocene (Figure 7.7). The location of GNAIW’s

and NADW’s core in the water column is clearly distinct (Figure 7.7, bottom), which

led us to support the use of different names for these water masses.

The vertical sections of AABW’s distribution across the Atlantic (Figure 7.13)

show the dominance of this water mass at the bottom and deep layers of the entire

basin from 21 to 14 ka. Indeed, as discussed above, it is well established that a

salty version of AABW expanded meridionally and vertically at the beginning of the

deglaciation (e.g., Duplessy et al., 1984; Oppo and Fairbanks, 1987; Curry et al.,

1988; Duplessy et al., 1988; Adkins et al., 2002; Cottet-Puinel et al., 2004; Ferrari

et al., 2014). From 12 ka on, however, AABW was drastically reduced and confined to

abyssal depths, dominating the entire water column only nearer its formation region

in the Southern Ocean (Figure 7.13, lower panels).

We believe that the transition between GNAIW and NADW occurred gradu-

ally after Heinrich Stadial 1 (after 14.7 ka). Tessin and Lund (2013) analyzed ?13C

reconstructions from Brazil margin cores and suggested a reorganization of water

masses during the H1, with reduced influence of the northern sourced water mass.

The freshwater input between 19 and 15 ka might have weakened the intermediate

water formation in the North Atlantic, which is why the AMOC is sluggish during this

period (as mentioned in section 5.1). This meltwater was then transported to the

Southern Ocean, where it continuously freshened AABW and finally allowed NADW

to sink from 12 ka and beyond (chapter 6 and Figure 7.15, lower panels). This is the

point when AABW retracts to give space to the newly formed NADW.

The AABW’s horizontal distribution (Figure 7.14) shows the formation of this

water mass to be south of 50?S. The spreading of this water mass happens mostly

near the bottom. At 21 ka and 14 ka (Figure 7.14, upper panels), the AABW’s con-

tribution is considerable also in the deep layers. The higher values at the northern

subpolar gyre are due to the configuration of the triangles explained above. At 12

ka (Figure 7.14, lower left panel) we note the sudden reduction of AABW in the At-



7.4. DISCUSSION 63

lantic Ocean. AABW spreads at the greatest depths and is probably traceable up

to the subtropical North Atlantic, which is consistent with the pattern observed today

(Purkey and Johnson, 2010; Talley et al., 2011).

When we compare the maps showing the GNAIW and NADW horizontal dis-

tributions (Figure 7.16 and 7.17), we notice that the spreading of NADW is much

larger. NADW is transported by the DWBC and reaches 40?S, where it upwells (see

the horizontal strip of higher values at ?600 m in the lower two panels of Figure 7.16).

GNAIW, on the other hand, is mostly constrained to the subpolar gyre. The maps also

reveal something else of interest. It appears that GNAIW was formed mainly by the

Nordic Seas overflow, and then spreads to the subpolar North Atlantic (Figure 7.16,

upper left panel). NADW, in turn, is a result of the mixing between Nordic Seas over-

flow and Labrador Sea waters (LSW). Proxy data reconstructions indeed suggested

that LSW formation was absent until the early Holocene and that the main source of

dense waters in the North Atlantic was the Nordic Seas (Hillaire-Marcel et al., 2001;

Cottet-Puinel et al., 2004; Crocket et al., 2011). The reason for LSW’s early absence

is likely because of the almost constant meltwater flux from the Laurentide ice sheet

into the Labrador Sea (Cottet-Puinel et al., 2004).

CHAPTER 8

The Southern Ocean and the Meltwater

Pulse 1A

T
HE Southern Ocean is the only ocean that covers every longitude, allowing a

continuous and strong eastward flow — the Antarctic Circumpolar Current

(ACC). Because it connects all the major ocean basins, ACC is the main

vehicle that transports water from one ocean to another. Near the Antarctic coast, an-

other current flows opposite to ACC: the Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC). ACoC is

important because it sets the regime where the ocean interacts with ice shelves, which

ultimately modify water masses formed on the Antarctic shelf. Due to low tempera-

tures and constant sea ice formation — which releases salt to the water underneath

—, the shelf waters get very dense and sink to the bottom, especially at the Weddell

and Ross Seas. These very dense waters are later exported to all ocean basins as

Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which drives the lower limb of the global Overturning

Circulation.



8.1. REGIONAL EVOLUTION OF THERMOHALINE PROPERTIES: WEDDELL
AND ROSS SEAS 65

8.1 Regional evolution of thermohaline properties: Wed-

dell and Ross Seas

The AABW precursors are mainly formed in the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea (Orsi

et al., 2002). Because of that, we have placed a meridional section in each sea

in order to observe the changes in temperature and salinity during the 22 thousand

years of simulation (Figure 8.1).

Figure 8.1: Chosen transects at the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea (black lines). The position of
these transects were determined based on the approximated longitude of the two main point

of dense water formation (Orsi et al., 2002).

The temperature sections for both seas (Figures 8.2 and 8.3) show a pro-

gressive warming of intermediate and deep waters, especially during the Holocene.

The range of depths that shows the largest warming is commonly occupied by the

Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) — or Warm Deep Water (WDW) in the Weddell Sea.

As this water mass is essentially formed by deep waters coming from north (North

Atlantic Deep Water, Pacific Deep Water, and Indian Deep Water; Talley et al., 2011),

the warming of CDW may indicate warming of its predecessors. We know, from the

previous chapters, that at least the NADW warmed during the last 21 kyr. In the salin-

ity sections (Figures 8.4 and 8.5), the values diminish in the entire water column as we

move from the LGM to 0 ka — which is expected in high latitudes under deglacial con-

ditions. The largest salinity change occurred between 19 ka and 14.7 ka, when the

meltwater prescribed for H1 reached the Southern Ocean and ultimately freshened

the Antarctic Bottom Water.

8.2. THE IMPACT OF THE MWP-1A ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN DYNAMICS 70

8.2 The impact of the MWP-1A on the Southern Ocean

dynamics

Figure 8.6 shows the evolution of surface ocean current speed, surface salinity, and

wind stress averaged along 55?S and 65?S during the simulation. The 55?S band is

on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) pathway, while the 65?S band is on the

Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC) pathway.

A general negative trend can be noted in the three variables at 55?S. Although

there is still controversy about the position and strength of westerlies during and after

the LGM (Kohfeld et al., 2013), there are studies that point out to stronger winds

at the LGM in high southern latitudes (e.g. Wainer et al., 2005), as we see in the

top panel of Figure 8.6. The salinity at 55?S decreases according to the prescribed

freshwater fluxes, with a major drop possibly associated with the northward transport

of the meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet during the Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-

1A). The current speed, as the salinity, has a major drop around 14 ka, but the speed

negative peak happens before the salinity one.

At 65?S, the wind stress increases from the LGM to around 12 ka, and then

maintains a relative stable level on the remaining simulation. This variability is quite

different from salinity and current speed time series. The salinity slightly decreases

over time while the current speed is almost constant, and both of them have a large

peak around 14 ka — positive for current speed and negative for salinity.

Although the general negative trend in the ACC velocity might be essentially

a response to the wind stress weakening, it seems that the current speed variability is

associated with the changes in surface salinity. The wind stress is thought to be the

main driver of the ACC (e.g. Gill, 1968; Allison et al., 2010), but Hogg (2010) points

out the importance of surface buoyancy controlling ACC intensity. Here, we think

that the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet played an important role in the Southern

Ocean dynamics. Normally, in a meridional section across the Southern Ocean, the

isopycnals rise polewards since the surface waters near the Antarctic shelf are much



8.2. THE IMPACT OF THE MWP-1A ON THE SOUTHERN OCEAN DYNAMICS 71

denser compared to surface waters farther north. The sea level, on the other hand,

is higher equatorward. This scenario produces a pressure gradient force from mid- to

high-latitudes, which forces the water to flow poleward (Figure 8.7(a)). This flow is ulti-

mately deflected to the left due to Earth’s rotation, reinforcing the ACC — which flows

eastward — and weakening the ACoC — which flows westward (Figure 8.7(a)). When

freshwater is released around Antarctica, the isopycnals deepen and the surface level

rises near the coast. This weakens or inverts the pressure gradient force, resulting

in a flow that is opposite to ACC’s direction (Figure 8.7(b)). In this case, the ACoC

is intensified. This scenario would explain the well-correlated peaks around the time

of the MWP-1A, where an abrupt reduction of salinity is immediately accompanied by

an intensified ACoC (Figure 8.6, bottom). The lag between the minimum salinity and

ACC’s speed drop (Figure 8.6, top) might be explained depending on the adjustment

time of the northward flow of freshwater relative to the pressure gradient generated

by the presence of freshwater over the shelf.

CHAPTER 9

The Indian Ocean’s response to

meltwater fluxes

S
MALLER than the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Indian Ocean is unique

because it is limited up to 25?N, where it encounters the Asiatic landmass.

This ocean has also a limited connection with the Atlantic Ocean since

the African landmass stands between the two of them. The only direct communica-

tion between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean occurs between the tip of Africa and

Antarctica. Since there is no direct water exchange between the Indian and the North

Atlantic, this ocean is a good laboratory where we can isolate and analyze the effects

of a meltwater pulse coming from the Southern Ocean.



9.1. THE INDIAN OCEAN’S CHARACTERISTICS 74

9.1 The Indian Ocean’s characteristics

In the Indian Ocean, the surface circulation can be divided into two systems: a sub-

tropical gyre in the southern hemisphere and a seasonal regime in the tropics and

in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the monsoonal regime. These two systems

are limited at around 10-12?S by the nearly zonal Southern Equatorial Current (Talley

et al., 2011). In the boreal summer, strong southwestern winds dominate the Arabian

Sea area. These winds reverse northeastward during the winter (Figure 9.1). The

change in the wind regime affects the ocean currents in this area. During the sum-

mer, the West and East Indian Coastal Current (WICC and EICC) flow eastward, as

well as the Southwest Monsoon Current, which is present only at this season. During

the winter, the WICC, the EICC, and the Northeast Monsoon Current flow westward

(Figure 9.2, Talley et al., 2011).

(a) (b)

Figure 9.1: Present climatological winds over the Indian Ocean for (a) July and (b) January
from NCEP reanalysis1.

The North Indian Ocean has also a salinity contrast between west and east

of India. The Arabian Sea is dominated by the high salinity outflows from the Persian

Gulf and Red Sea. The Bay of Bengal, on the other hand, is under the influence of

major river discharges, which gives this part of the ocean its low salinity characteristic.

At intermediate depths, we also find a salinity contrast in the north-south axis of the

western Indian Ocean (Figure 9.3). Coming from south, there is a low salinity tongue

that indicates the presence of Antarctic Intermediate Water. From north, a salty water

mass originated in the Red Sea extends southward (the Red Sea Water, RSW, with

influences of the Persian Gulf waters). Generally, the limit between these two water

masses is around 5?S (You, 1998). At larger depths, AABW dominates.

9.2 Impacts of meltwater pulses on the Indian Ocean

In order to compare the state of the Indian Ocean during the last deglaciation with the

modern state described above, we chose to observe the western Indian in a merid-

ional transect at 53?E. Figure 9.4 shows the salinity distribution in this transect at

different times. At the LGM (Figure 9.4(a)), the vertical stratification is reinforced by

the presence of the salty version of the AABW (Adkins et al., 2002). The stratification

gradually weakens as the simulation advances in time (as we saw previously in the

Atlantic Ocean). At 14 ka (Figure 9.4(c)), the AAIW is much fresher and occupies a

larger domain than before, while RSW is retracted. After that, the AAIW tongue weak-

ens but the RSW plume does not return to its glacial extension. The freshening of the

AAIW at 14 ka is probably associated to the MWP-1A, since part of this water mass

is formed through the subduction of southern surface waters at the Subantarctic Front

(e.g. Sloyan and Rintoul, 2001).

Analyzing the region where AAIW and RSW meet (between 10?S and the

equator), it is possible to observe when one water mass overcome the other through

the mean salinity variation in intermediate depths (Figure 9.5(a)). In general, the

salinity between 200 and 1000 m increases about 0.25 during the H1, after which

the values drop drastically until 14 ka, during the MWP-1A. At the YD, the salinity in-

creases by 0.25 again and drops slightly toward Holocene levels. The surface mean

salinity follow the intermediate layer variability, but has lower salinity values. From

1000 m to the bottom, region of AABW’s dominion, the salinity reduction is approxi-

mately monotonous during the deglaciation.

The potential temperature for the same layers is presented in Figure 9.5(b).

Figure 9.5: Southwest Indian Ocean (at 53?E) mean (a) salinity and (b) temperature
between 10?S and the equator at different depth ranges, as indicated by the legend.

We observe that the evolution of temperature in the intermediate layer (200-1000 m)

is similar to the Antarctic air temperature reconstruction (Figure 2.2, middle, purple

line) and its variability is larger compared to the temperature variability at the sur-



9.2. IMPACTS OF MELTWATER PULSES ON THE INDIAN OCEAN 79

face. Kiefer et al. (2006) show that the temperature variations in the western tropical

Indian, reconstructed from ?18O and Mg/Ca records, remarkably resemble the tem-

perature recorded in Antarctic ice cores. The authors point the Subantarctic Mode

Water (SAMW) — which can be considered part of the AAIW — as the responsible

for the link between these two regions. The SAMW is formed between the Subantarc-

tic and Subtropical Fronts, when it is subducted to depths around 200-600 m and

moves equatorward, where it upwells at the thermocline base. This way, the signal

is clearer at intermediate depths, as observed in Figure 9.5(b). Kiefer et al. (2006)

hypothesis was later reinforced by Naidu and Govil (2010) and Romahn et al. (2013).

The surface temperatures seem to mix the patterns observed in Antarctic and

Greenland ice cores, which indicates that the western Indian Ocean responds to the

climatic variability of both hemispheres.

The ??S diagram for the same region (53?E, between 10?S and the equator)

is presented in Figure 9.6. It can be seen that the curve has a salinity maximum at

intermediate temperatures. This maximum is associated with the dominance of RSW

over AAIW between 10?S and the equator. According to You (1998), the boundary

between RSW and AAIW is usually placed around 5?S, as we mentioned before. As

indicated in the ? ?S diagram, the salinity maximum is larger at 15 ka, while at 14.1

ka it reverses to a salinity minimum. The observed change may be associated with

the northward expansion of the AAIW during the BA period.

In order to explain this variability in the northern limit of AAIW, we first investi-

gated the atmospheric forcings. The Figure 9.7 shows the variability of the wind stress

over the equator during the last 22 thousand years. Comparing this time series with

the one associated to the temperature at Greenland (Figure 2.2) we note the similarity

between them. The reduction of southwest winds (weakened summer monsoon) is

associated with cold periods in the North Atlantic.

In a study with dinoflagellates related to upwelling at the Somalian coast,

Zonneveld et al. (1997) found the following sequence of events associated with the

monsoon system in the Indian Ocean since the LGM:

different periods.

Figure 9.7: Wind stress time series at the equator, 53?E.

• 21.9 to 17.4 ka ? Southwest (SW) monsoon not too intense;

• 17.2 to 14.7 ka ? SW monsoon extremely weak;

• 14.7 ka ? Rapid transition toward stronger SW monsoon;

• 14.7 ka to 11.8 ka ? Several short pulses of low intensity SW monsoon (Younger

Dryas);

• Holocene ? Rising values, reaching a maximum at 7.2 ka, and sharp decrease

between 4.5 and 2.5 ka.

The same sequence of events can be observed in the Figure 9.7, with excep-

tion of the abrupt decline during the Holocene. We notice that the expansion phase



9.2. IMPACTS OF MELTWATER PULSES ON THE INDIAN OCEAN 81

of AAIW observed at Figures 9.4 and 9.6 is associated to the period of intense SW

monsoons at the BA. Strong SW winds implicate in a reduced outflow from the Red

Sea equatorward (which is consistent with the surface circulation observed at Figure

9.2), allowing AAIW to reach its northernmost position.

Another important feature of the tropical Indian Ocean responds to climatic

variations in the model: the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). In the Figure 9.8, we

observe the variability in the core speed of this current along the simulation. The

increase in the speed core is consistent with the intensification of the SW monsoons.

The core depth almost does not change, rising slightly during the H1.

CHAPTER 10

General Conclusions and Final

Considerations

This study examined, through the analysis of the results of a transient paleoclimate

numerical simulation with the NCAR-CCSM3 from the 21,000 years ago to present

day, the evolution of the deep Atlantic (and western Indian) Ocean circulation under

meltwater forcing. We went through a brief review of the climatic events since the LGM

(Chapter 2); analyzed the changes in the Atlantic’s circulation, from the variability of

the AMOC and its associated heat and salt transports to the changes in the thermo-

haline structure and water masses distribution (Chapters 4 to 7); assessed the direct

impacts of the presence of freshwater on the Antarctic shelf (Chapter 8); and investi-

gated the indirect impact of the meltwater discharges in the dynamics of the western

Indian Ocean (Chapter 9). As these last two chapters (8 and 9) were not explored as

deeply as the ones concerning the Atlantic Ocean, we suggest that TraCE-21K data

for the Southern Ocean and the Indian Ocean are further investigated in the future.



83

The main conclusions we have found are:

1. The glacial ocean (21 ka) was very stable, stratified, and its layers did not mix as

much as they do today. The main reason for this vertical configuration was the

production of a salty version of AABW, which occupied most of the deep ocean

basins. The presence of this very dense water mass below 2000 m of depth

did not allow the intrusion of the northern water mass to the modern NADW

level. At 12 ka, AABW’s distribution was drastically reduced by the appearance

of NADW;

2. AABW had a gradual warming and freshening since the LGM, except for the

small warming peak during the MWP-1A, associated with reduced upwelling of

northern warm waters;

3. As the upper North Atlantic gets flooded by freshwater during the H1 and this

freshwater reaches the deep ocean through the Southern Ocean, the ocean’s

vertical structure starts changing but the salinity stratification still only allows

the formation of an intermediate water mass in the North Atlantic, the so-called

GNAIW;

4. GNAIW was a cold water mass, fresher than AABW that existed in the begin-

ning of the deglaciation; its characteristics made GNAIW very similar to AAIW;

GNAIW was shallower than NADW and could not spread as much southward;

5. GNAIW’s formation progressively weakened during the Heinrich Stadial 1 —

which caused the MOC to slow down — and was finally replaced by modern

NADW after 12 ka;

6. The impact on the ocean structure resulting from the continuous freshening

allows the erosion of the salinity barrier that was preventing the spread of the

NADW into the South Atlantic. The newly formed NADW is allowed to sink and

spreads southward;



84

7. Since 12 ka, NADW has been formed by contributions from both Nordic Seas

overflow and the Labrador Sea Water. Prior to this, GNAIW was mainly formed

by Nordic Seas overflow;

8. During the Holocene, the vertical distribution of salinity (related to the distribu-

tion of Atlantic water masses) reaches its modern-day pattern. Therefore, the

present-day NADW owes its spatial structure to the impact of several freshwa-

ter discharges in the Atlantic, which contributed to the erosion of the subsurface

salinity barrier formed at LGM.

9. AAIW seems to have weakened during the cold events H1 and YD;

10. The presence of freshwater over the Antarctic shelf shortly induced the inten-

sification of the Antarctic Coastal Current and the slowdown of the Antarctic

Circumpolar Current. The connection between the salinity field and the current

speeds happens through the change in the meridional pressure gradient and its

resulting flow;

11. The western tropical Indian Ocean responds to the climatic variations from both

hemispheres: the Northern Hemisphere through the atmosphere and the South-

ern Hemisphere essentially through the ocean. Wang et al. (2013) point the

influence of both hemispheres in the Indian Ocean, highlighting that the signal

captured by each proxy may differ according to the phytoplankton preference

to the southern winter or summer. According to these authors, the variation of

the ITCZ position favors the record of the NH temperatures when the same is

displaced southward and the record of SH temperatures when it is displaced

northward.

It is worth to notice that we analyzed a single transient run where no con-

trol simulation or other companion sensitivity experiments were available to access

uncertainties and robustness of the results with respect to each individual meltwater

flux. Furthermore, there are other intrinsic uncertainty sources such as the prescribed

meltwater flux in TraCE-21 (that is obtained indirectly from sea level records) plus the



85

fact that the timing, magnitude and location of MWP-1A, associated with global sea

level change, has significant uncertainty as well. Since the meltwater fluxes were

prescribed, it does not necessarily mean that the model has the correct sensitivity to

the freshwater input. In this respect, interpretation of the results has to be taken with

caution considering that the lack of a control run does not allow us to single out cause

and effect relationships relative to individual events.

Moreover, the method of analysis employed to determine the water masses

distribution is quite simplistic. Using only two physical properties to identify four water

masses is somewhat limiting. Nevertheless, the information this analysis produced

is of considerable value, especially because it shows the continuous evolution of the

deep Atlantic water masses since the LGM. The formation regions indicated by the

highest percentages of contribution at thermocline levels are consistent with much

of the oceanographic data literature. In addition, the main water mass distribution

patterns formed are quite reasonable. We believe that this work gives new insights

into the evolution, on the millennial time scale, of the deep Atlantic circulation in the

last 21,000 years.
