JAVANELLA SANFORDAE, A NEW CYTHERIDAE (CRUSTACEA:
OSTRACODA) SPECIES WITH A DISCUSSION ON THE VALIDITY OF THE

GENUS JAVANELLA KINGMA

ABSTRACT – Javanella sanfordae, a new Cytheridae (Crustacea, Ostracoda) species, is herein described and illustrated.
Among the rare fossil and recent records of Javanella, this is the first outside the southeastern  Asia and Australia regions.
This may indicate a migration of this genus to the Atlantic before the elevation of the Isthmus of Panama during the
middle Pliocene (4 to 3 Ma) or through the Drake Passage, and its subsequent dispersion in deeper waters along the
Brazilian margin.The validity of the genus Javanella as well as its zoogeographical and stratigraphical distributions are
discussed.

Key words: Javanella, Ostracoda, systematics, zoogeography, Brazilian margin.

RESUMO – Javanella sanfordae, uma nova espécie de ostracode da família Cytheridae (Crustacea, Ostracoda), é aqui
descrita e ilustrada. Entre os poucos registros fósseis e recentes de Javanella este é o primeiro fora da região do Sudeste
Asiático e Austrália. Isso pode indicar que a migração desse gênero para o Atlântico ocorreu antes da elevação do Istmo
do Panamá, no Mesoplioceno (4 a 3 Ma), ou através da Passagem de Drake, e que, posteriormente, dispersou-se para as
águas profundas da margem continental brasileira.A validade do gênero Javanella bem como suas distribuições estratigráfica
e zoogeográfica são discutidas.

Palavras-chave: Javanella, Ostracoda, sistemática, zoogeografia, margem brasileira.

INTRODUCTION

Marine podocopid ostracodes are one of the most
diversified crustacean groups especially in the Cenozoic.
Every year, new genera and species are proposed based either
on new discoveries or on the splitting of previously described
taxa during systematic reviews. The geologic history of
oceanic basins clearly indicates that the South Pacific is an
important centre of origin and migration for ostracodes being
corroborated by high levels of diversity because the earliest
stratigraphic records of some extant taxa are from that area
(Whatley &amp;amp; Ayress, 1988).

The dispersal mechanisms of marine benthic species
especially, are a recurrent research focus in ostracodology.
Because podocopid ostracodes lack planktic larvae, many
hypotheses have been proposed to explain how and when
different taxa overcome potential zoogeographical barriers,
in both shallow water and oceanic basins. It is traditionally
assumed that the shallow water faunas present a high degree

of endemism, while the deep sea taxa are predominantly
pandemic. Although these general principles remain valid,
recent studies have presented evidence that indicate this, in
part, must be reevaluated. At the core of that discussion is
the problem of taxonomic misinterpretation which may, for
instance, increase the zoogeographical range of a species
while in fact those records might combine distribution data
of two or more taxa (Jellinek et al., 2006; Schornikov, 2005). It
is important to point out, however, the existence of species
for which broad geographical range is appropriate.  A faunal
similarity between the South Pacific and Southeast Atlantic,
for instance, has been noticed by Bergue et al. (2006) who
recorded species such as Cytheropteron lobatulum Ayress
et al. 1996 and Phyloneptunus provocator Jellinek &amp;amp;
Swanson, 2003 in deep waters off the SW Brazilian
continental margin. Those occurrences show that migration
routes have been established between those two regions
some time during the Quaternary.

1999), Drozinski et al. (2003), Bergue et al. (2006) and Bergue
et al. (2007) have contributed to a more precise knowledge of
Brazilian marine bathyal ostracodes. The first occurrence of
some taxa in Brazilian waters such as Cluthia Neale, 1973,
Poseidonamicus Benson, 1972, Rimacytheropteron Whatley
&amp;amp; Coles, 1987 and Clinocythereis Ayress &amp;amp; Swanson, 1991,
improved both the taxonomy and paleozoogeographical
understanding of South Atlantic ostracode faunas. As a
further contribution to that data base, this article describes
Javanella sanfordae sp. nov. and discusses the validity of
this genus based on occurrences recorded in the literature
and examination of type material and the resultant
implications for some aspects of the zoogeographical and
stratigraphical distributions of Javanella.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The samples studied were taken from two piston cores
from the upper slope of Brazilian southeast continental
margin: SAN 26 (384 m water depth, lat. 23º42’ S, long. 42º21.1’
W) and SAN 23 (630 m water depth, lat. 23°49.5’S, long.
42°17.8’W) (Figure 1). Each of these samples of approximately
20 grams was prepared using conventional
micropaleontological techniques with extracted specimens
being imaged using both  SEM and traditional optical
microscopy. More detailed information relating to core length
recovery, sedimentology and samples can be found in Bergue
et al. (2006). The type material of Pellucistoma kendengensis
Bold, 1950, housed in the Museum of Natural Science of
Louisiana State University under the acronym HVH 4029,
was analyzed by the first author in optical microscopy. The
type material of Javanella sanfordae sp. nov. is housed at
the Ostracoda Section of Museu de Paleontologia of the
Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (MP-O), under
the curatorial numbers MP-O-1794, 1795, 1796 and 1870.

narrow smooth groove and small socket and tooth. Anterior
vestibulum more developed medially; postero-ventral
vestibulum elongate and slightly projected into the caudal

(Kingma, 1948) Bold, 1950 by the outline, especially for the
more broadly and symmetrically rounded anterior margin,  by
mandibular scars less developed, and the number of radial
pore canals. The valve surface of P. kendengensis, moreover,
is also thoroughly punctate. A comparison with the SEM
photographs presented by Gou &amp;amp; Chen (1988) revealed minor
differences in the structure of the hinge (more details see in
Discussion and Conclusions).
Occurrence. SAN 26 sample 19; SAN 23 samples 3, 4.
Distribution. Late Pleistocene, Santos Basin (Brazil).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The genus Javanella was proposed by Kingma (1948)
based only on two valves of late Pliocene samples from Java
in the Indonesian Archipelago. Despite the scarcity of material,
Kingma mentioned that the morphologic characteristics of
the type species, Javanella kendengensis, were significantly
different from any other genus previously described.

 Unfortunately, in Kingma’s  paper the two valves are
illustrated using poorly detailed pen and ink drawings,

hindering a more accurate determination of morphologic
features of the type material. The muscle scar pattern was
not described, probably as a result of the poor preservational
state of his specimens and there is not detailed information
on the hinge structure. Additionally, the holotype and the
type locality are not indicated.

Keij (1979), in a short paper, presented a brief review of
some taxa studied by Kingma (1948), including the new genus
Javanella. In that scientific note he showed SEM
photographs of the two valves of J. kendengensis Kingma,
1948 and presented both a lectotype and a diagnosis for this
genus. However, in his concluding remarks he pointed out
the necessity of a more complete review of this genus, which
in his opinion was a distinct Indomalayan taxon.

Perhaps for the above reasons, the validity of Javanella
has been questioned by some ostracodologists. Both the
classical Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology-Part Q
(Benson et al., 1961) and Bold (1950, 1958), refer it as a junior
synonym of Pellucistoma Coryell &amp;amp; Fields, 1937, which
explains why this genus is classified by some authors (e.g.
Warne et al., 2006) as a Paradoxostomatidae. Although the
paradoxostomatids have a variable range of carapace
morphologic features, the taxonomy of this family is also
strongly based on soft part anatomy (McKenzie, 1969). For
that reason the present authors have the opinion that the
maintenance of Javanella in the family Cytheridae, as firstly
assigned by Kingma (1948), is more sensible, as far as
carapace studies are considered.

There are only a few records of Javanella in the literature
(Figure 3), and according to Kempf’s Index and Bibliography
on Marine Ostracoda (Kempf, 1986, 1995) there are only three
species formally described. Besides the type species there

are two other species proposed by Hartmann (1978),
Paracytheroma caudata and P. arenicola, which were
reassigned by Howe &amp;amp; Mckenzie (1989) approximately a
decade later into Javanella. Those authors argue that the
well developed terminal hinge elements and more elongate
carapace are more related to Javanella than Paracytheroma.

A worthy contribution to the Javanella issue was given
by Gou &amp;amp; Chen (1988) who studied the distribution of Saida
Hornibrook, 1952 and Javanella from the Pliocene of Leizhou
Peninsula, China, presenting a redescription of J.
kendengensis based both on SEM and optic microscopy
photographs. In that article the figures show clearly most of
the morphologic features omitted in the Kingma’s drawings,
such as the central muscle scars, vestibulae and marginal
pore canals. There is also an improvement in the hinge
description, for Kingma’s description does not mention the
presence of teeth, which are clearly visible not only in Gou &amp;amp;
Chen (1988) but also in the Brazilian specimens.

As a result of our consideration of the published data
(Table 1) and the results of the study of the Brazilian material,
we now consider Javanella as a valid taxon because, as a
whole, it possesses a number of morphological features which
distinguish it from any other described genus, in particular
the hinge pattern. The present authors, however, disagree
with Howe &amp;amp; McKenzie’s taxonomic reassignment, and
consider the Australian species proposed by Hartmann (1978)
as Paracytheroma species due to the general outline, the
number of marginal pore canals and the central muscle scars.
In this sense, the Javanella occurrence registered by Warne
et al. (2006), in Shoal Bay, Australia is probably
Paracytheroma caudata Hartmann, 1978.

As stated before, few published studies mention the
occurrence of Javanella and all of them in the SE Asia/
Australia region, the only exception being Bold’s (1950)
record of Pellucistoma kendengensis (sic) in the Miocene of
Venezuela. Surprisingly, there are other  Caribbean faunal
elements present in southeast Brazilian bathyal depths such
as Heinia sp. and Nunana vandenboldi Aiello &amp;amp; Szeczechura,
2001 (Bergue et al., 2006), and similarities between Neogene
Caribbean and Brazilian tropical shallow water ostracode
species have been reported by Coimbra et al. (1999). Bold’s
type material of Pellucistoma kendengensis (sic), has been
examined by the senior author who concluded that it is not
co-specific with the Kingma’s species (Figure 2L).
Unfortunately, this material could not be coated for SEM
analysis and some morphological details were not properly
examined. The optical microscopy analysis showed that the
Bold’s species is quite different from both Javanella
kendengensis and J. sanfordae sp. nov. and possibly belongs
to another genus.

The data available are not sufficient to elucidate if the
migration route of this genus from the Pacific Ocean was
through the Drake Passage, in the south, or earlier than the
elevation of the Isthmus of Panama, in the middle Pliocene (4
to 3 Ma). That tectonic and vicariant event has been identified
to coincide with morphological changes in large populations
of ostracodes occurring on both sides of the isthmus as well

as the differentiation of species of the genus Orionina Puri,
1953 with small and isolated populations (Cronin, 1988; Cronin
&amp;amp; Schmidt, 1988). In fact, Allison &amp;amp; Holden (1971) discussed
the distribution of some marine species from Clipperton Island
(eastern tropical Pacific) whose oldest stratigraphical record
were in the Caribbean, as shown by Coimbra et al. (2004).
