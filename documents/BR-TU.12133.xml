ABSTRACT - Fibrodysplasia ossificans pro g ressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characteri-
zed by postnatal progressive heterotopic ossification of the connective tissue and congenital malformati-
on of the big toes. We re p o rt on a nine-year-old girl with clinical and radiological features of FOP. She was
b o rn with bilateral hallux valgus and at the age of nine presented an indurate mass in the left cervical re-
gion that was painful. A significant decreased range of motion in all levels of the spine and shoulder gir-
dle was found. The radiographs showed heterotopic ossification in the thoracic region. The patient had
two outbreaks of the disease (“flare-ups”) that were treated with prednisone 2 mg/kg/day for four days.
After the “flare-ups”, she had a continuous therapy with a Cox-2 inhibitor (25 mg/day) and a leukotriene
inhibitor, montelukast (10 mg/day). 

KEY WORDS: fibrodysplasia ossificans pro g ressiva, myositis ossificans pro g ressiva, myositis ossificans, hetero-

Fibrodisplasia ossificante progressiva: relato de caso

RESUMO - A fibrodisplasia ossificante pro g ressiva (FOP) é doença rara, autossômica dominante, caracteri-
zada por ossificação heterotópica pro g ressiva pós-natal do tecido conjuntivo e malformação congênita
dos háluces. Relatamos o caso de menina de nove anos com o quadro clínico-radiológico típico de FOP,
nascida com hálux valgo bilateral e que aos 9 anos de idade apresentou massa dolorosa, de consistência
e n d u recida, sem sinais inflamatórios, situada na região cervical. Adicionalmente, era possível observar di-
minuição importante da movimentação em todos os níveis da coluna vertebral e da cintura escapular. A
avaliação radiológica revelou a presença de ossificações heterotópicas na região torácica e malform a ç ã o
bilateral dos háluces. A paciente teve outros dois surtos da doença, que foram tratados com cort i c o s t e r ó i d e
oral por quatro dias, (2 mg/kg/dia) seguido por tratamento prolongado com inibidores da Cox-2 (25 mg/dia)
e com inibidor de leucotrienos (10 mg/dia).

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a
r a re autosomal dominant disorder in which cong e-
nital abnormalities of the big toes are associated w i-
th pro g ressive heterotopic ossification of the con-
nective tissue stru c t u res including those related to
the striated muscles, leading to permanent disabi-
l i t y. Studies from Europe and United States conclu-
ded that the estimate incidence of FOP is one in t w o
million birt h s1. In Brazil there are some cases relat-
ed in literature like publish by Tonholo et al. in 1 9 9 42,
Nucci et al. in 20003, and Araujo et al. in 20054. C u r-

re n t l y, the Brazilian FOP Association (FOP BRASIL)
has 49 registered cases of FOP.

Most cases of FOP are due to new gene muta-
tions, but genetic studies confirm the autosomal
dominant nature and variable expression of the
p resumed defective gene. Genetic analysis re v e a l e d
that the FOP phenotype is linked to markers locat-
ed in chromosome 45. It is believed that a gene m u-
tation causes an overe x p ression of a bone morpho-
genetic protein (BMP4)6.

CASE
A nine-year-old girl presented the initial symptoms

of FOP with tender and painful masses on the anterior
abdominal wall accompanied by warm overlying skin
and erythema. These masses pro g ressively appeared on
the thoracic and dorsal regions with the same clinical
f e a t u res. At that time she was admitted to hospital for
two weeks. Her blood and urinary tests were norm a l
and no abnormal sign was seen on the magnetic reso-
nance imaging of the abdomen. No history of local trau-
ma was re p o rted. Later the patient had two “flare - u p s ”

of the disease in the right and left cervical regions that
disappeared after two weeks. Physical examination sho-
wed a hard mass on the left side of the cervical re g i o n .
The mass was tender and painful, but no warmth or in-
flammation was noted (Fig 1A). Palpation revealed stiff-
ness of all abdominal and paraspinal muscles. Abduction
of the shoulders was restricted to a 45º (Fig 1B). The pa-
tient had bilateral hallux valgus but no other abnorm a l i-
ty of any other toes (Fig 2). Her parents didn’t show any
similar abnormalities on the physical examination. No h e-
t e ropic ossification was observed in two radiographic

series at one- and two-month of follow-up. Axial tru n k
computerized tomography (CT) showed points of ossi-
fication (Fig 3A). The three-dimensional (3D) surf a c e
shaded display of the trunk CT showed multiple hetero-
topic ossifications in the spine and scapulas (Fig 3B). The
patient took Vi o x x® for 6 months without any side e ff e c t s
and now is taking Montelukast (10 mg/daily) and cort i-
costeroids (2 mg/Kg/4 days) for “flare-ups”. 

This case re p o rt was approved by the hospital ethic
commission and the parents gave informed consent for
publication.

DISCUSSION

Guy Patin first described FOP in 1692 in a young
patient who “turned to wood”7. The autosomal d o-
minant inheritance of FOP was first described by
Sympson in a case re p o rt of a 7-year-old boy with
classic features of FOP whose father had the same
congenital deformity of the great toes but no oth-
er characteristics of this disorder8.

Genetic linkage analysis has shown that the FOP
phenotype is heterogeneous linked to markers
located in the long arm of chromosome 4. In 2000,
Feldman et al. described four affected families with
markers located in the 4q27-315. Lucotte et al. pub-
lished in 2000 that the FOP gene was related to
c h romosome 17q21-229. Further studies, published
by XU et al. and Kaplan et al. showed that there is
no link between FOP and this gene1 0 , 1 1.

A b n o rmalities of the great toes are observ e d
at birth in most cases of FOP (bilateral hallux val-
gus - microdactylia with hypoplasia or synostosis
of the phalanges or both). In our case, the pare n t s
reported that the patient had hallux valgus since
b i rt h1 2. The initial symptoms of FOP are painful a n d
h a rd soft tissue swellings over the affected m u s c l e s
that lead to ossification. It usually occurs from birt h
up to the age of 16 years (mean age 4.6 years), fol-
lowing spontaneous or trauma-induced “flare -
u p s ”1 , 1 3. Heterotopic ossification usually begins in
the cervical paraspinal muscles and later s p re a d s
f rom axial to appendicular, cranial to caudal and
p roximal to distal sites. Scoliosis is a common find-
ing and is often the result of asymmetric hetero t o-
pic bones connecting the trunk and pelvis1.

Conductive hearing impairment is a common
f e a t u re associated with this condition1 4 and it pro b-
ably occurs due to the fusion of the ossicles of the
e a r1 5. Pro g ressive episodes of heterotopic ossifica-
tion lead to ankylosis of all major joints of the axi-
al and appendicular skeleton, rendering move-
ment impossible. Generally, in the second decade

of life, FOP patients are confined to bed or wheel-
c h a i r s1 6. Card i o p u l m o n a ry problems may occur and
a re associated with severe restrictive disease of
the chest wall17.

FOP diagnosis is clinical and it is usually made
based on the presence of three major criteria1 5: C o n-
genital malformation of the great toes, pro g re s-
sive heterotopic endochondral ossification (hetero-
topic bones that gradually form from cart i l a g e )
and pro g ression of the disease in well-defined ana-
tomical and temporal patterns. Laboratory tests m a y
show a discrete increase of ESR during the “flare -
ups”. Imaging exams like radiographs and tomo-
graphies shows the heterotopic bones and are use-
ful to confirm the diagnosis.

D i ff e rential diagnosis includes other genetic ill-
nesses that also cause the development of hetero-
topic ossifications, such as pro g ressive osseous het-
e roplasia (POH), Albright here d i t a ry osteodystro-
phy (AHO), osteoma cutis, ankylosing spondylitis,
S t i l l ’s disease and Klippel-Feil-syndro m e1 5. The “ f l a re -
ups” of FOP must be diff e rentiated from the inf l a m-
m a t o ry processes of osseous tumors, and aggre s-
sive juvenile fibromatosis.

Treatment of FOP is multifactorial and is based
on injury prevention and clinical therapy. Pre v e n-
tion of soft tissue injury and muscle damage, as
well as the prevention of falls, is extremely impor-
tant. Intramuscular injections, including vaccines,
must be avoided. More o v e r, in routine dental care ,
o v e r s t retching of the jaw and intramuscular local
anesthetic injections should also be avoided.

Patients with FOP may have an additional risk
of “flare-ups” after influenza-like illness. Thus, a
subcutaneous influenza vaccine could help these
patients, particularly those who have severe re s t r i c-
tive disease of the chest wall and are at a gre a t e r
high risk of presenting complications of re s p i r a t o-
ry infections that are a frequent cause of death. 

D rug treatment of our patient was based initia-
lly on the guidelines published by Kaplan et al.1 8

and currently on the new guidelines published by
the same authors1 9. The patient received cort i c o s t e-
roids in the acute phases of the disease and a long-
t e rmtreatment using a combination of a leukotrie-
ne inhibitor and a Cox-2 inhibitor.

C o rt i c o s t e roids given within the first 24 hours of
f l a re-up may reduce the intense lymphocytic in-
filtration and tissue edema1 8. Prednisone is given for
four days, 2 mg/kg/day, and should be restricted to
the early symptomatic “flare-ups” that affect major

j o i n t s1 8. When prednisone is discontinued, a non-
s t e roidal anti-inflammatory drug or a Cox-2 inhibitor
may be used symptomatically for the duration of
the “flare-up”. None of these drugs avoided the pro-
g ression of the disease in our patient. Non-stero i d a l
a n t i - i n f l a m m a t o rydrugs like ibuprofen and indo-
methacin can be used the doses of 4-10 mg/kg (every
6 hours) and 2-4 mg/kg/day, re s p e c t i v e l y.

The Cox-2 inhibitors restrain the activity of in-
f l a m m a t o ryprostaglandins, which are potent co-
stimulatory molecules along with BMPs in the in-
duction of the heterotopic bone. Recently, after
the Vi o x x® recall, the use of Cox-2 inhibitors in the
pediatric population change to Celebrex® (altho-
ugh it has been used compassionately in childre n ,
it is not approved for pediatric use). The dose ran-
ge is from 100 to 200 mg per day and can not exce-
ed a maximum total daily dose of 600 mg for more
than 16 months or maximum anti-angiogenic dose
of 6 mg/kg or 250 mg/m2.

Leukotriene inhibitors may reduce the down-
s t ream effects of released mast cell mediators that
a re involved in the pathological process of hetero-
topic bone form a t i o n1 8. Montelukast, a leukotriene
inhibitor may be prescribed in a dose of 5 or 10
mg/day.

F i b rodysplasia ossificans pro g ressiva is a rare
and disabling disease that still does not have an
e ffective treatment that can cure it or stop its pro-
g ression. Physicians, health care pro f e s s i o n a l s ,
patients and their families must be educated about
the disease. Although drugs can be used to de-
c rease some symptoms, the best approach is still
the early diagnosis and prevention of trauma that
can provide a better quality of life.
