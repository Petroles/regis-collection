Abstract
Worldwide aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by broad-scale environmental pressures such as agriculture, point and non point-source pollution and land-use changes overlapping in space and time, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems. In face of this global change, declines in environmental quality of rivers and respective reservoirs are of increasing concern. This has lead to an increasing search for new technologies for the monitoring of reservoirs to establish priorities of conservation, protection and restoration to achieve the “Maximum Ecological Potential” of these water bodies. In this context, the objective of this thesis was to develop new tools, supported by multivariate statistical analyses and modelling methodologies, which can be applied in assessing the ecological status of Mediterranean reservoirs, in the scope of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This work intended to design integrated methodologies to capture the aquatic ecosystems complexity through a multi-scale approach, in order to develop and understand the local and regional mechanisms that operate in reservoirs. To better understand the occurring changes in the structure and functioning of this systems, several ecosystem components (e.g. hydromorphological, physical, chemical and biological) and several disturbance factors (e.g. land use changes, hydrometric variations, point and non-point source pollution, etc.) were incorporated, at different spatial and temporal scales of analysis. The thesis was structured into seven chapters based in the analysis of extensive data bases, namely long-term data bases collected in the field by the Laboratory of Environmental and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) managed by the Portuguese Electricity Group (EDP), in five different Portuguese hydrographic regions (Lima, Cavado and Ave, Douro, Mondego and Tagus catchment), through a period of nine years (1996 to 2004). The major objectives of this thesis were:
•	To establish the typology and the Type-specific reference condition of the Portuguese hydroelectric reservoirs based on biotic and abiotic quality elements, namely phytoplankton as water quality indicator, through a multi-scale approach.
•	To determine the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) on the phytoplankton community structure of the studied reservoirs Types.
•	To determine, over time, the degree of impairment of these reservoirs by contrasting it with a reference site, as proposed by the WFD.
•	To develop a modelling multi-scale approach, based on an holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM), in order to predict the ecological status tendencies in Mediterranean reservoirs as a response to land use changes in the respective watersheds. Therefore, the Douro's basin was used to test and validate the StDM model, as well as evaluate the StDM performance in capturing how expected changes at land use level scenarios will alter the reservoir water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels.
ABSTRACT
The results of the different approaches were consistent in the typology defined for the Portuguese reservoirs, as well as in the observed pollution gradients, which in some extend reflected the degradation associated to the conversion of the agroforestry areas into industrialized and semiurban areas. Therefore, it was possible to identify two types of dammed water bodies which were characterized by different hydromorphological features, water chemistry characteristics and by a specific phytoplankton taxa composition:
•	Type 1 represents lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus) characterized by higher concentrations of nutrients and water mineral content. This “riverine reservoirs”, resembles more a river than a lake, with short hydraulic retention times, good mixing and relative high water velocities, never or rarely affected by stratification phenomena. In general, is located in densely populated, industrialized or agricultural areas, receiving high inputs of organic matter and industrial discharge.
•	Type 2 represents deeper high altitude “artificial lake reservoirs”, largely located in tributaries, with a high residence time, with longer water storage and release cycles operating under seasonal influence, strongly affected by stratification phenomena.
It was possible to assign characteristic phytoplankton taxa assemblages to each type of reservoir. For both regulated systems types, was also possible to establish the characteristic taxa of disturbed and less or non disturbed sites. Such ascription is an essential prerequisite for the development of an assessment procedure according to the WFD, where the assessment should be done by comparing the actual species composition to the one that would be present under reference conditions.
Our findings of the importance of local and regional scale factors on phytoplankton community structure lend support to earlier studies, reflecting the importance of habitat and large-scale (landscape) factors on reservoir ecosystems and demonstrate that Phytoplankton could be a good ecological indicator for multi-scale and cumulative disturbance effects with a view to integrate future worldwide monitoring in reservoirs.
Regarding the developed modelling multi-scale approach (StDM), the overall results were encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the tool reliability in capturing the stochastic environmental dynamics of the selected metrics facing spatial explicit scenarios. The ultimate goal of this approach was to couple monitoring assessment and the described modelling techniques to ease management and decision making regarding the requirements of the WFD.
Overall, the methodologies presented in this thesis could contribute to the implementation of the WFD in Portugal, with regard specifically to the evaluation of the ecological status, providing new tools for the ecological integrity assessment of lentic waters, and pretend to contribute to a larger understanding of the structural and functional human induced alterations that occur in Portuguese aquatic ecosystems.

Resumo
Mundialmente os sistemas aquáticos têm sido afectados por diversas pressões a larga escala, nomeadamente a intensificação agrícola e o aumento de fontes tópicas e difusas, que se sobrepõem no espaço e no tempo e têm levado à ruptura da estrutura e do funcionamento destes sistemas. Face a esta alteração global, o declínio da qualidade ambiental dos rios e respectivas albufeiras, tem sido alvo de uma crescente preocupação. Neste contexto, tem surgido uma crescente procura de novas tecnologias para a monitorização de albufeiras que permitam estabelecer prioridades de conservação, protecção e restauração, que possibilitem alcançar o estado ecológico requerido ou um bom potencial ecológico para estas massas de água fortemente modificadas. Assim, o objectivo desta tese foi o desenvolvimento de novas ferramentas assentes em análises estatísticas multivariadas e metodologias de modelação, que possibilitam a determinação do estado ecológico de albufeiras mediterrâneas, no âmbito da Directiva Quadro da Água (DQA). Este trabalho pretende desenvolver metodologias integradas que captem a complexidade inerente aos ecossistemas aquáticos através de uma abordagem multi-escala, de modo a compreender melhor os mecanismos locais e regionais que operam nestas massas de água. Para uma melhor compreensão das alterações ocorridas na estrutura e funcionamento das albufeiras, vários componentes destes ecossistemas foram incorporados a diferentes escalas temporais e espaciais de análise, nomeadamente, parâmetros hidromorfológicos, físicos, químicos e biológicos e ainda vários factores de perturbação (i.e., alterações dos usos do solo, variações hidrométricas e fontes de poluição tópicas e difusas). A tese foi estruturada em sete capítulos cuja análise foi suportada por extensas bases de dados, nomeadamente as séries temporais de longo-termo, referentes ao período 1996-2004, compiladas pelo Laboratório de Ambiente do Grupo Electricidade de Portugal (EDP, LABELEC). A base de dados engloba um conjunto de 34 albufeiras que se estendem por cinco regiões hidrográficas distintas (Bacias do Lima, Cávado e Ave, Douro, Mondego e Tejo).
Os principais objectivos desta tese foram:
•	Estabelecer a tipologia e as condições de referência de cada Tipo, das albufeiras Portuguesas com fins hidroeléctricos definidos, através de uma abordagem multi-escala baseada nos elementos abióticos e bióticos, nomeadamente nas comunidades fitoplânctonicas como indicadores da qualidade da água (Capítulo 2).
•	Determinar a importância das variáveis ambientais na estruturação da comunidade de fitoplâncton nos Tipos de albufeiras estudadas a diferentes escalas espaciais (geográfica, regional e local) e temporais (estações do ano, anos) (Capítulo 3).
•	Determinar, como proposto pela DQA, o grau de perturbação das diversas albufeiras, ao longo do tempo, através da comparação com os locais de referência para cada um dos Tipos determinados (Capítulo 4).
•	Desenvolver um modelo Estocástico-Dinâmico (StDM), baseado numa abordagem multi-escala, para prever o estado ecológico de albufeiras Mediterrâneas face a alterações de uso do solo nas respectivas bacias hidrográficas. Neste contexto, a bacia do Douro foi utilizada para testar e validar o modelo desenvolvido (Capítulo 5), assim como avaliar a sua performance na previsão de alteração da qualidade da água de uma albufeira, nomeadamente ao nível ambiental e
RESUMO
biológico (fitoplâncton), face a expectáveis cenários espaciais de alteração de uso do solo (Capítulo 6).
Os resultados das diferentes abordagens foram consistentes na definição da tipologia das albufeiras portuguesas estudadas, assim como nos gradientes de poluição observados, que de algum modo parecem reflectir a degradação associada à conversão de áreas agro-florestais em áreas industriais ou semi-urbanas. Assim, foi possível identificar dois Tipos de massas de água com características hidromorfológicas, químicas e biológicas distintas, nomeadamente com comunidades fitoplântonicas específicas:
Tipo 1, albufeiras localizadas nos rios principais (Douro e Tejo) caracterizadas por elevadas concentrações de nutrientes e minerais. Este Tipo de albufeiras "fio-de-água", assemelha-se muito mais a um sistema lótico do que a um sistema lêntico, apresentando tempos de residência baixos (dias), boa mistura e uma relativa elevada velocidade da corrente, nunca ou muito raramente ocorre estratificação. Em geral, situam-se em áreas densamente povoadas, industriais ou agrícolas sujeitas a elevados inputs de matéria orgânica e descargas industriais.
Tipo 2, verdadeiros reservatórios, profundos e situados a altitudes elevadas. Geralmente, encontram-se localizadas nos tributários e apresentam elevados tempos de residência (semanas a meses). Consequentemente, são fortemente afectados por fenómenos de estratificação.
Foi possível, determinar as comunidades fitoplânctonicas características de cada um dos Tipos de albufeiras referidos. Para ambos os tipos de sistemas regulados, foi também possível estabelecer os taxa característicos dos locais perturbados e dos locais menos perturbados ou de referência. Esta caracterização é um pré-requisito essencial para o desenvolvimento de um processo de avaliação de acordo com a DQA, dado que a avaliação deve efectuar-se através da comparação da composição de espécies actual com a que estaria presente em condições de referência.
Os resultados relativos à importância das escalas local e regional na estrutura e composição do fitoplâncton vieram corroborar estudos anteriores, reflectindo a importância do habitat e da paisagem nos ecossistemas lênticos. Estes resultados parecem demonstrar que o fitoplâncton pode ser um bom indicador ecológico na avaliação holística dos efeitos de pressões cumulativas ou multi-escala, podendo vir a ser integrado no futuro, a nível regional ou mundial, na monitorização de albufeiras.
Relativamente ao modelo Estocástico-Dinânmico (StDM) desenvolvido, de uma maneira geral os resultados foram encorajadores dado que parecem demonstrar a consistência desta ferramenta em captar a dinâmica ambiental aleatória das métricas seleccionadas face a cenários espaciais expectáveis. Este tipo de abordagem holística pode eventualmente facilitar o ordenamento destas massas de água, assim como a tomada de decisão segundo as exigências da DQA.
Globalmente, as metodologias desenvolvidas nesta tese poderão contribuir para a implementação da DQA em Portugal, especialmente na avaliação do estado ecológico, fornecendo novas ferramentas para a avaliação da integridade ecológica de sistemas lênticos, e pretende ainda contribuir para uma maior compreensão das alterações estruturais e funcionais que ocorrem nos sistemas aquáticos portugueses devido a pressões antropogénicas.

1.1.	Thesis framework
The quality and availability of freshwater is one, if not the most, essential determinants for the health of ecosystems and human societies world-wide. Nevertheless, due to the pressures of increasing population and developing economy all over the world, the present situation of water quality and river management is far from satisfactory. The recognition of damaging effects of the destruction of habitats, chemical pollution, eutrophication and climatic alterations on the aquatic organisms, as a result of the human activities, combined with an urgent need of a more sensitive environmentally management of reservoir and ecologically sustainable, led the development of methods that improve the assessment of the ecological condition of these systems. Thus, in the present work were developed innovative methodologies through the conjugation of multivariate methods, modelling and geographical information systems, to assess and manage the ecological integrity of Mediterranean lentic ecosystems, namely of Portuguese reservoirs with hydroelectric generation. This thesis attempted to overcome some of the actual gaps verified in the management and monitoring of these surface waters.
To assess the ecological status of the studied aquatic ecosystems and to better understand the occurring changes in the structure and functioning of Portuguese reservoirs, were incorporated several ecosystem components (e.g. hydromorphological, physical, chemical and biological) and several disturbance factors (e.g. land use changes, hydrometric variations, point and non-point source pollution, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales of analysis.
The thesis is structured into seven chapters based in the analysis of long-term data bases collected in the field, by the Laboratory of Environmental and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) managed by the Portuguese Electricity Group (EDP), in five different hydrographic regions (Lima, Cavado and Ave, Douro, Mondego and Tagus catchment), located in North and Centre of Portugal. Exception made for chapters 5 and 6, which were based only in the Douro's catchment data base. This information was complemented with extensive matrices arising from an intense bibliographical research and request to several Portuguese entities.
The thesis consists of seven chapters. The scientific articles and the book chapter that compose the introduction and the core of this thesis (five chapters) were published,
accepted for publication or submitted in international journals belonging to the Journals Citation Report (JCR) basis. The structure and original content of these documents were maintained in the essential. Additionally, a patent based in the developed modelling environmental management tool, a Sthocastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) model was submitted (PT103753, pat. pend.).
The individual chapters are briefly described in the next paragraphs which further elucidate the specific goals of the research.
The present chapter gives an overview of the “state of the art" related to the development of reservoirs and their sustainable water management and ecological evaluation procedures through the integration a more dynamic and holistic vision of these aquatic ecosystems. At the watershed level, the related physical, chemical and biological processes are numerous with complex interactions. To retrieve this interaction as requested by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), in this chapter are highlight the significant efforts needed to analyze the relevant information, simulate the related processes, evaluate the resulting impacts, and generate sound decision alternatives. Therefore, the application of modelling techniques as decision support tools, that provide an important instrument to the implementation of the WFD as well as potentiate a meaningful dialogue among stakeholders, are explored.
Chapter 2 establishes, through a multi-scale approach, the typology of the Portuguese hydroelectric reservoirs based on biotic and abiotic quality elements, namely phytoplankton as water quality indicator. In this chapter, the Type-specific reference condition for each reservoir Type was also defined, fundamental to the classification of reservoir's ecological status based on a deviation from reference conditions, which is the basis of the ecological assessment.
Chapter 3 determines the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) on the phytoplankton community structure of the two Portuguese reservoirs Types. The individual importance of the three spatial scales and time in the communities' assemblages was assessed by variance partitioning, though multivariate analysis.
Chapter 4 explores a suitable way of monitoring and assess ecosystem health of the two types of Mediterranean reservoirs using phytoplankton communities. The Principal
Response Curve (PRC) method was used to analyse changes in species composition and environmental variables between different sites over time. This allowed to estimate, in a temporal basis, the degree of impairment at a particular site by contrasting it with a reference site, as proposed by WFD.
Chapter 5 explores the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of phytoplankton communities and physicochemical conditions in reservoirs as a response to the changes in the respective watersheds soil use. The case of the Douro's basin was used to test and validate the StDM performance in this multi-scale approach. StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed.
Chapter 6 as an extension of the previous one, examined the applicability of the developed StDM model, coupled with a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in capturing how expected changes at land use level scenarios will alter the reservoir water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels. The methodology was applied to the Portuguese area of the Douro's basin and illustrated with a series of stochastic-dynamic and spatial outputs taking into account expected scenarios regarding land use changes. This kind of approach could be very useful, for decision support, as an investigative tool to forecast the outcome of various scenarios and to guide current management in order to meet future targets and to develop integrated frameworks for management accordingly to the WFD.
Finally, in the Chapter 7 the main conclusions of the previous chapters were discussed, their relevant achievements towards integrative and holistic analysis of aquatic systems and, also, the new challenges in water management and WFD implementation facing the worldwide climate change scenario.
The ultimate objective of this thesis is to provide methods that can be an object of enhancement for application in other regions and that may contribute to the development of new assessment methodologies leading to an improvement of the characterization techniques and management strategies of aquatic ecosystems. To a national scale, the information contained in this thesis looks for participating in the implementation of the WFD, in the next stage for the definition of the monitoring programs, namely by:
■	identifying reference conditions,
■	selecting relevant ecological indicators for assessment of ecological condition;
■	setting the environmental descriptors with biological relevance;
■	integrating various levels of observation and sets of variables (biotic and abiotic ones) in an integrative way;
■	implementing multi-scale approaches that may lead the ecological condition of reservoirs and from which management strategies can be designed.
1.2.	The imperative need of river regulation
Over 45 000 times in the last century, people took the decision to build a dam. Dams or reservoirs have been built to provide water for irrigated agriculture, domestic or industrial use, to generate hydropower or help control floods. Nevertheless, reservoirs also altered and diverted river flows, affecting existing rights and access to water, and resulting in significant impacts on livelihoods and the environment (ICOLD, 2006). The International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD, 1998) defined as large reservoirs, those whit a dam height of at least 15 meters and any volume of water, or those with water volumes exceeding 1 million m3 and of any dam height.
The earliest evidence of river engineering is the ruins of irrigation canals over eight thousand years old in Mesopotamia. But the first use of dams for hydropower generation, is much more recent, around 1890 (ICOLD, 2007). By 1900, several hundred large dams had been built in different parts of the world, mostly for water supply and irrigation. The last century saw a rapid increase in large dam building. By 1949 about 5 000 large dams had been constructed worldwide, three-quarters of them in industrialized countries. By the end of the 20th century, there were over 45 000 large dams in over 140 countries.
The top five dam-building countries account for nearly 80% of all large dams worldwide. China alone has built around 22 000 large dams, close to half the world's total number; the United States and India had over six and four thousand large dams, respectively; and Spain and Japan had over 1 000 large dams each (ICOLD, 1998, 2007; WCD, 2000).
In the Mediterranean Spain, France, Turkey, and Italy hold the largest number of large dams. Nevertheless, Spain has the highest number of reservoirs per inhabitant worldwide with a capacity of some 50,000 hm3 (WWF, 2006) (Fig. 1).
In Portugal, these structures are relatively recent, mostly from the 20th century. Nowadays,
there are 151 large dams, more than half of which are for irrigation purposes, but generation
of electrical energy play as well an important role. The biggest o ne is the multipurpose dam of Alqueva at the Guadiana with a maximum height of 152m (ICOLD, 2006). The first studies in Portuguese reservoirs date from 1951 (Frade 1951, 1954, 1957, 1959), in the 80thies the National Institute of Fishery Investigation published the firsts reports using algae as biological	pollution
indicators (Oliveira, 1982, 1985, 1987). Through the 20th and 21st centuries,
Figure 1. Number of large dams in Mediterranean countries.
(modified from ICOLD, 1998, 2007; WCD, 2000; WWF, 2006)
many studies had been made, unfortunately these works cover only a few number of reservoirs and were restricted to a short monitoring periods, i.e., are very scarce the works with long-term monitoring data basis and that incorporate a significant part or all the
national reservoirs (see for exemple, Cabeçadas et al., 1986; Fereira, 1986; Brogueira and Pereira, 1988; Vasconcelos, 1991, 2001; Boavida and Gliwicz, 1996; INAG, 2002; Figueiredo et al., 2006; Domingues and Galvão, 2007). Additionally, the Portuguese government have just launched the National Program for the Dams with High Hydroelectric Potential, with the objectives to identify and define the new investments in this area through the 2007-2020 periods (INAG, 2008). Therefore, the construction of 10 new infrastructures are now being
proposed, namely six in the Douro river (Alto Tâmega, Daviões, Fridão, Foz do Tua, Gouvães and Padroselos), two in the Tagus river (Almorol and Alvito) and one in Mondego and Vouga
rivers (Girabolhos and Pinhosao, respectively) (INAG, 2008). In this context, we saw reinforcement the need to seek for new methodologies that allowed the assessing and the management of the ecological condition of these surface water bodies.
The nature of the impacts of large dams on ecosystems is generally well known by scientists. A useful indicator of the scale of human intervention in this regard is a recent estimate that dams, inter-basin transfers, and water withdrawals for irrigation have fragmented 60% of the world's rivers (WWF, 2006).
Ecosystem impacts can be classified according to whether they are (WCD, 2000):
■	first-order impacts that involve the physical, chemical, and geomorphological consequences of blocking a river and altering the natural distribution and timing of streamflow;
■	second-order impacts that involve changes in primary biological productivity of ecosystems including effects on riverine and riparian plant-life and on downstream habitat such as wetlands; or
■	third-order impacts that involve alterations to fauna (such as fish) caused by a first-order effect (such as blocking migration) or a second-order effect (such as decrease in the availability of plankton). In addition, changes the biochemical cycle in the natural riverine system.
In general, the dam purpose is also the major factor in defining the operating rules for the reservoir. These, in turn, control the water level variations in the reservoir and the flow regime in the downstream river, both important environmental factors. These water bodies and its biological communities are submitted to enormous spatial-temporal variations, caused by the hydric resource use regime they are subject. In terms of river hydrology, physical, chemical and biological variables in the downstream river are affected by the reservoirs in various ways. In Table 1 are listed, gross generalizations that do not account for multivariate effects, of some of these factors. Further details and many examples are provided by Petts (1984,1989) and J0rgensen et al. (2005).
Table 1 - Impacts of reservoirs in the downstream water quality (modified from Jprgensen et al.
2005)
Variable	Changes in downstream water quality
Physical variables
River channel structure
Can be substantially changed by the erratic water flow rates.
Hydrobiology Thermics	Decrease or increase average water flow rates. A decrease in average temperature occurs, with greater retention time and outlet depth.
Turbidity Detritus Light	Decrease silt loadings occurs, which may cause a decrease in flood soil fertility. The composition particles changed from abiotic to biotic; and its size decreases. Light penetration is increased.
Chemical variables
Oxygen H2S and CO2	Very affected by the reservoir trophic state and the outlet depth. Concentrations increase, especially in eutrophic, stratified reservoirs with long water retention times.
pH Organic matter	Generally decreases. Organic matter concentration decreases, if there are no sources of in-lake organic production.
Phosphorus (P)	The P concentrations decreases, and the degree of the decrease is higher when water retention time and trophic degree are greater.
Nitrates Nitrites Total solids Biological variables Phytoplankton composition	Nitrates concentrations are usually nearly unchanged. Nitrites concentrations are usually increased. Total soli concentrations remain nearly unchanged. The phytoplankton composition changes downstream. In small rivers, there is a transition from riverine (periphytic) species to pelagic species. In large rivers, the number of lacustrine species increases bellow a reservoir.
Phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a Zooplankton Benthos Fish	The quantities depend on the location of the outflow: surface outflows deliver more phytoplankton and higher chlorophyll-a contents. Zooplankton composition changes and biomass usually increases in the outflow. Composition is usually highly changed. Reservoirs represent a barrier to fish migration. Feeding habitats are often reduced. Fish abundance bellow reservoirs vary greatly, based on the specific conditions.
Therefore, the reservoir management has to take into consideration not only the reservoir itself, but also the reservoir outflows. People living downstream of a reservoir, fish populations in the downstream river and other biota should not be highly disturbed by the construction or operation of a reservoir (J0rgensen et al, 2005). Reservoir managers, researchers and decision makers must deal with the integration of water quality management concerns into the overall environmental management planning.
1.3.	Water Framework Directive as a guideline for integrated river basin management in Europe
On 23 October 2000 was finally adopted, by the European Parliament and Council, the Directive 2000/60/EC or short the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishing a framework for the Community action in the field of water policy.
An important shift compared to other European Directives related to water policy (e.g. Drinking Water Directive, Urban Waste Water Directive) is that an integrated approach was taken. The objectives of water management are not only defined with regard to human needs but attention is also paid to the ecological demands of the aquatic ecosystem With the implementation of the WFD, the different Member States are committed to invest in river management to improve river health.
In general, the directive distinguishes two major goals. First, the development of a management system has to be based on natural river basin districts which are the main units for river management (Bloch, 1999). Further, river basins and sub-basin are to be distinguished. The second goal of the directive is the development of river basin management plans and programmes of measures to achieve at least a 'good surface water status' in 2015 for al European water bodies. In terms of environmental objectives, a 'good surface water status' means the status achieved by a surface water body is at least 'good' for both its ecological status, or its ecological potential for a heavily modified or an artificial water body, and its chemical status. For reservoirs, as heavily modified water bodies (HMWB), the reference conditions on which status classification is based are within the range of “Maximum Ecological Potential” (MEP). The MEP represents the maximum ecological quality that could be achieved for these systems, once all mitigation measures that do not have significant adverse effects on its specified use or on the wider environment have been applied (GIG, 2007).
In the WFD the ecological status of surface water is defined as "...an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems associated with surface waters, classified in accordance with Annex V”. This implies that the classification systems of the ecological status of water bodies should reflect the changes in the structure of the biological communities and in the overall ecosystem functioning as a response to anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, the ecological status of a water body includes a combined effect of
biological (phytoplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fishes), morphological and physical-chemical characteristics.
Traditionally, reservoir quality evaluation has been based almost exclusively on the measurement of physical and chemical characteristics, disregarding biological ones. However, the confirmation that this approach does not cover the whole ecosystem, as well as the recognition of the existence of interactions between anthropogenic pressures and its cumulative impacts, has emphasized the need to search for new and more appropriate means of ecological condition assessment of water resources and respective watersheds. Therefore, the past 40 years have seen a rapid acceleration of scientific interest in the development and application biological assessment due to the increasing recognition of its importance in providing a measure of the global integrity, since the aquatic organisms embrace and reflect the cumulative effects of the environmental disturbance (De Pauw and Vanhoren, 1983; Karr, 1991; Yoder and Rakin, 1998; Karr and Chu, 2000). Currently, intensive research is being carried out in Europe to develop biological indicators and classification metrics that can be used in assessment, comparison and harmonization of ecological water quality targets across the continent. Nevertheless, for policy makers, the amount of ecological data is often overwhelming. Therefore, environmental managers and decision makers require indicators that are understood by the public. Ideally, policy-relevant indicators would allow: (a) assessment of both existing and emerging problems; (b) diagnosis of the anthropogenic stressors leading to impairments; (c) establishment of trends in condition for measuring environmental policy and program performance; and (d) ease of communication to the public. Besides capturing the complexities of an ecosystem and being easy to communicate, an indicator should also be easily and routinely measurable (Dale and Beyeler 2001). Moreover, the cost of monitoring and subsequent analyses is also a consideration for state and federal agencies.
Additionally, due to their capacity to assess aquatic ecosystems integrity they can reflect disturbances that would not be detected in another way or that would be otherwise underestimated (e.g. habitat degradation, highly variable pollution levels due to point and non-point pollution).
The questions, goals, and objectives of a monitoring program determine which ecological indicators are used Given the importance of the evaluation of the different ecosystem
components, were developed in this thesis methods that comprise, in some way, the several components of the studied ecosystems (physical, chemical and biological). The goal is consequently to obtain an integrated comprehension of the lentic ecosystems, their dynamics, and concomitantly, determined the interactions between reservoir and respective drainage basin, as required by the WFD.
1.3.1.	Definition and establishment of reference sites
In order to achieve good status, representative of the conditions at the site in the absence of interference by man, the WFD sets a number of monitoring obligations, namely surveillance, operational and investigative monitoring programmes. Therefore, is crucial the establishment of reference conditions that serves as control for the monitoring/conservation programs that intend to assess the ecological status of rivers and the degree of deviation to relatively natural conditions in similar environments.
The recognition, inside the European Union, of the limited number of high quality sites has driven to a larger interest in its identification, assessment, protection, preservation and, ultimately, restoration (REFCOND guidance, 2003). Reference conditions may range from “pristine” to “best available” ones, and are usually based on the status of the communities in reference sites, which are relatively unaltered and homogeneous with regard to the morphological, hydrological, physico-chemical and biological conditions. These conditions can be defined by only one biological element, just as the phytoplankton, or for the combination of several taxonomic groups (e.g. fish, macrophytes) or functional attributes (e.g. growth rates, functional groups).
This Directive allows Member States to identify surface water bodies which have been hydromorphologically altered by human activity as “heavily modified” or “artificial” under specific circumstances. For those water bodies the objective is the achievement of a good ecological potential which may strongly deviate from good ecological status (Heiskanen et al. 2004). Due to recognized importance of this concept, the document "REFCOND guidance (2003)", produced by the European Commission for the implementation of WFD for its member states, proposes definitions, methods, principles and criteria that can be used in the establishment of reference conditions and classes of ecological quality for lakes and water courses. This document states that each type of surface water body sites with high ecological
status should be identified for namely by the hydromorphological, physico-chemical, and biological conditions that characterize such reference sites (Oliveira and Cortes, 2006).
Availability of data for each water body	Suggested approach
Minimally impacted sites available?	1	Yes Spatial network + predictive models
&gt;r	
Minimally impacted sites available	Yes	Borrow data and use in spatial
elsewhere?	network + predictive models
&lt;or	
Historical or paleoecological data?	1 Yes / Site-specific data, paleoreconstruction
	
No relevant sites or data available?	1	Yes Use expert judgement
Figure 2. A step-by-step approach for selection of the method for determination of reference conditions for surface water bodies based on the information and data availability (adapeted from Heiskanen et al. 2004)
According to Norris and Thoms (1999), a previous classification of water bodies types is essential for the establishment of the reference sites in order to reduce biological variability within different water bodies. Classification schemes of rivers and reservoirs include those based exclusively on geomorphological features of the drainage basins, in ecoregions and those that use multivariate analyses (or predictive models) of biological attributes (GIG, 2007).
Methods for determining of reference sites, or minimally disturbed ones, have been proposed by several authors. Thus, the reference biological conditions for each type can be defined from existing reference sites, or from historical, paleoecological and experimental data, which can be obtained at laboratory, or through modelling, extrapolation and based in expert judgment. Accordingly, to Heiskanenet al. (2004) a possible decision scheme for determining reference conditions, based on the data availability, could be the represented in Figure 2.
A brief description of the methods above mentioned, based essentially on the works of Johnson (2001), Economou et al. (2002), Heiskanenet al. (2004) and Oliveira (2006), is presented below:
a)	Historical data and/or expert judgment
Accordingly to the authors, the success of the use of these two methodologies in the monitoring and environmental assessment is limited, largely due to the incapacity of these methods in including the dynamic and inherent variability often associated with natural ecosystems. Nevertheless, historical data provide not only the knowledge of past conditions, but it becomes essential to estimate the current ecological potential. These methods are particularly important in degraded systems. Despite the fact of being less subjective than those based on expert opinion they have the disadvantage of not allow to knowing with accuracy the past environmental conditions.
The evaluation of the reference condition for experts has the potential of combining a broad range of important information, namely historical data and/or actualized opinions and concepts. Therefore, even if other methods have been used to define the reference condition, an expert opinion is always necessary, at least, in data quality evaluation when monitoring objectives and methods has changed along the time.
b)	Extensive surveys (spatial network)
Data from the reference sites can be grouped a priori or a posteriori into homogeneous strata, representative of the area and water bodies in analysis, and are used to estimate the natural amplitudes of biological variability and establishing reference condition. Therefore, these procedures incorporate the ecosystems natural variability. The common practice is to define sites a priori rule-based and/or quantitative exclusion criteria concerning to specific types of impacts (e.g. lack of point pollution sources, unaffected land-use patterns, absence of exotic species, etc.). Sites that do not satisfy the pre-defined criteria are then excluded. This methodology is currently mostly applied in the USA and uses independent geophysical and chemical data to group pristine or “minimally” disturbed sites. However, if the selection is made a posterior, the exclusion is decided after monitoring. Caution should be taken not to introduce circularity by using variables that will be used subsequently in the classification
of the ecological status. In general, methodologies based in multivariate approaches tend to use a posteriori classification of sites, mostly used in Europe and Australia.
Contrarily to the a priori method, this approach defines the reference conditions using the community assemblages in reference sites, through clustering methods (Wright et al., 2000). For each reservoir Type, the ecological status of a dam is determined by comparing the deviation of test site community metric values to the values of the reference population. According to Economou et al. (2002), both procedures are of extreme importance in the establishment of methodologies and criteria for reference site selection, in spite the high sampling cost.
c)	Paleoreconstruction and/or modeling
These approaches are particularly important when the ecosystems are heavily disturbed, like in artificial water bodies such as reservoirs or channelized rivers, not being possible to find reference sites (minimally impaired), and/or when the available information is very scarce. Paleoreconstruction is applied essentially to lakes, and seeks to obtain records of the geomorphological, physico-chemical or biological modifications that happened throughout time in a water body. Nevertheless, since the past reference conditions cannot be representative of the current conditions, it is crucial the experts judgment to integrate all the information along relatively vast temporal periods.
If none of the existing sites in the watershed satisfies the criterion of "minimally impacted”, the establishment of reference conditions by extrapolating measurements from other similar basins is still possible trough modelling. This method requires good quality ecological data and knowledge of the mechanisms that structure natural communities. Although being less direct than the spatial methods, under very specific conditions this process allows for the application of the reference data to an unknown area.
In spite of the variety of available methods for determining reference conditions, little knowledge and experience exists in most countries about the inherent positive and negative aspects, or about the potential problems associated to the use of each of them. In most cases, to calibrate reference conditions and have a more holistic view based in the available information, more than one method should be applied (Schmutz et al., 2000).
1.4.	New challenges in management and decision making: modelling approaches regarding the WFD requirements
The history of ecological and environmental modelling, namely in limnology, has been through generations of models, from Lotka-Volterra and Streeter-Phelps to the structural
dynamic models of today (J0rgensen, 1995; J0rgensen et al, 2005). Figure 3 gives a briefly overview of the history of ecological modelling. The time axis gives approximate information on when the various development steps took place. The first models, of oxygen balance in a stream (the Streeter-Phelps model) and of the prey-predator relationship (the Lotka-Volterra model), were developed in the early 1920s. In the 1950s and 1960s a second generation of models appeared. More complex river models were developed and further development of population dynamic models also took place. The third generation started when modelling became a more widely used tool in environmental management, mainly around 1970 with the development of eutrophication models (J0rgensen, 1995).
Parallel to this development of models for environmental management, ecologists became more quantitative in their
approach to environmental and ecological problems, probably as a consequence of the needs formulated by environmental management. The models from the late
Figure 3. The development of ecological and environmental models (adapted from J0rgensen, 1995)
1970s to the mid-1980s could be called the fourth generation of models. The models from this period are characterized by having a relatively sound ecological basis with emphasis on realism and simplicity. The short-comings of modelling were, however, revealed too. It became clear that the models were rigid in comparison with the enormous flexibility which was characteristic for ecosystems. Additionally, the hierarchy of feedback mechanisms that ecosystems possess was not accounted for in the models, which made them incapable of predicting adaptation and structural dynamic changes, interfering with the accuracy of the
prognosis under all circumstances (J0rgensen, 1995). Since the mid-1980s modellers have proposed a fifth generation of models, which attempt to account for structural changes.
Another generation emerged at the end of the last century, RIVPACS (River Invertebrate Prediction And Classification System) (Wright et al., 2000) has led to an increasing interest of the use of predictive models for river and reservoir management. With this model, the structure and composition of the expected macroinvertebrate fauna is predicted from a small suite of environmental variables of the site (geographic variables, geology and habitat descriptors), which are considered as relatively stable through time and "minimally” impaired. Based on this approach, other similar models have been developed: AUSRIVAS (Australian River Assessment System) in Australia (Norris and Norris, 1995; Davies, 2000) and BEAST (Benthic Assessment of Sediment) in North America (Reynoldson et al., 1995) mainly related to lotic ecosystems management than to lentic water bodies.
Since the new millennium, a shift in use from multivariate statistical (based on data distribution functions, e.g. regression and ordination) to soft computing (based on heuristic search methods, e.g. artificial neural networks, decision trees) techniques has started (Jorgensen, 2002; Adriaenssens, 2004).
In Europe, the United States of America and Australia there is considerable activity in developing models and adapting models to catchment management. The WFD has set Environmental Objectives relevant for all catchments, and hence all activities, in Europe. The challenges of the WFD are significant and judicious and the use of mathematical models can help to meet them. Like the integrated nature of the catchment or the WFD documentation, models provide an holistic view, showing synthesis of complex natural processes and identifying the likely response within and among domains of natural and anthropogenic changes.
There is an extensive and voluminous literature on mathematical models relevant to catchment management (see for more detailed information Schulze and Zwolfer 1987; Thomann and Mueller 1987; Hakanson and Peters 1995; Beven 2001; Hakanson and Boulion 2002; J0rgensen et al, 2005). Additionally, and reinforcing the importance of these issues, several European Union-related research projects have been supported by the European Commission and are contributing to the implementation of the WFD, namely, through the
application of mathematical models. Some examples are (based on EEA, 2002; Dedecker, 2005):
AQUATOX (A simulation model for aquatic ecosystems) (http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/models/aquatox/);
BASINS (Better Assessment Science INtegrating Point and Nonpoint Sources) (http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/basins/basinsv3.htm);
CE-QUAL-W2 (A hydrodynamic and water quality model for rivers, estuaries, lakes, and reservoirs) (http://www.wes.army.mil/el/elmodels/w2info.html);
CATCHMOD (Catchment Modelling Cluster)( http://www.harmonit.org/links/catchmod.htm)
EUROHARP (European Harmonised Procedures for Quantification of Nutrient Losses from Diffuse Sources) (http://www.euroharp.org/);
EUROLAKES (Integrated water resource management for important deep European lakes and their catchment areas) (http://pcs0.hydromod.de/Eurolakes/index.html);
HARMONIQUA (Harmonising Quality Assurance in model based catchment and river basin management 2002-2005) (http://harmoniqua.wau.nl/);
PAEQANN (Predicting Aquatic Ecosystem Quality using Artificial Neural Networks: impact of environmental characteristics on the structure of aquatic communities (Algae, Benthic and Fish Fauna)) (http://aquaeco.ups-tlse.fr/);
PROTECH (Phytoplankton Responses To Environmental Control) (http://windermere.ceh.ac.uk/algalmodelling/contents/ProtechC/ProtechCPage.htm);
SWRRB (Simulator for Water Resources in Rural Basins) (http://abe.www.ecn.purdue.edu/~wepphtml/wepp/wepptut/jhtml/swrrb .html).
There is no single integrated model that can be applied universally throughout a catchment in order to meet the demands of the WFD, even if applied to specific types of water bodies. BASINS (http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/BASINS/) is probably the most advanced attempt at an integrated catchment model, that nevertheless incorporates a number of submodels to model catchment run off and water quality (QUAL2E) models (EEA, 2002).
Whether incorporated under “one roof” or not, a modular approach to catchment modelling will probably remain the more attainable reality; whereby individual models are developed to operate independently within the relevant domain but such that they are able to link with other models within a wider multi-model system. This approach enables communication of models, and modellers, within catchments. In the Netherlands, the adoption of a modular approach has facilitated cooperation among institutes, and this is considered to be a key factor in progressing the use of modelling in the implementation of the WFD (Blind and van Waveren, 2000). A modular approach does not, however, need to detract from a holistic view of the catchment and the cumulative impact that inherent uncertainties may have for either application of individual models or, comprehensive, catchment management.
Nevertheless, the whole is much more than the sum of the parts and the WFD requires a holistic approach to catchment management in order to understand relevant physical, chemical and ecological mechanisms. Therefore, ecological studies have been improved by creating dynamic models that simultaneously attempt to capture the structure and the composition in ecosystems affected by long-term environmental disturbances (J0rgensen, 1994, J0rgensen et al., 2005). Since many of the ecosystem phenomenological aspects are holistic, whole-system properties, the main vocation of the Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) recently developed is a mechanistic understanding of the holistic ecological processes, based on statistical parameter estimation methods (Santos and Cabral, 2004; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007). This recent research is based on the premise that the general statistical patterns of ecological phenomena are emergent indicia of complex ecological processes that do indeed reflect the operation of universal law-like mechanisms. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. These procedures are focusing on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components and reduce the number of pre-conceptions added to the modelling procedures (Cabral et al, 2008). The methodology proposed is expeditious and applicable to several types of ecosystems affected by gradients of change. In fact, the StDM was successfully tested in several types of ecological systems, such as mountain running waters (Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007), Mediterranean agroecosystems (Santos and Cabral, 2004; Cabral et al., 2007), estuaries (Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2008), and for simulating the impact of socio-economic trends on threatened species (Santos et al., 2007).
As explained before, nowadays environmental assessment is pushed to assist with land use planning decisions and projections of 'what if' scenarios at the landscape scale and, consequently, it is necessary to capture the main cause-effect relationships between human activity and ecosystem responses (Bailey et al., 2007). In this context, the StDM multi-scale approach developed in this thesis seems to represent a useful contribution for the holistic implementation of the WFD, namely for integrated assessments of the reservoirs ecological status within the environmental gradients or “data space” monitored. Since the ultimate goal was to produce simulation models that permit the creation of spatially explicit
ecological patterns we believe that the present approach provide a useful starting point to develop more global techniques in the scope of this research area. In fact, the methodology presented in this thesis is an example of how this can be achieved, by creating expeditious interfaces with GIS, which make the modelling outputs more instructive and intuitive to decision-makers and environmental managers.

Multi-scale approach using phytoplankton as a first step towards the definition of the ecological status of reservoirs
Published as: Edna Cabecinha, Rui Cortes, João Alexandre Cabral, Teresa Ferreira, Martinho Lourenço and Miguel A. Pardal, 2008. Multi-scale approach using phytoplankton as a first step towards the definition of the ecological status of reservoirs. Ecological indicators. (in press). DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2008.04.006.
2.1.	Abstract
The growing need to analyse the present state of ecosystems and predict their rate of change has triggered a demand to explore species environment relationships for assessing alterations under anthropogenic influence. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the definition of different types of water bodies which are of relevance when assessing their ecological status. The main aim of this study was to define of the types of Portuguese reservoirs located in the North and Centre of Portugal and to assess their ecological status using phytoplankton as water quality indicators. In this study, sampling was carried out in 34 reservoirs during four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter), through a period of eight years (1996 to 2004).
Two groups of reservoirs could be distinguished, from the multivariate statistical analysis based on environmental variables and on phytoplankton assemblages: G1 - lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very low residence time, characterized by higher water mineral content (hardness and conductivity), higher concentrations of nutrients (namely, nitrates), dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta and characterized by the presence of tolerant of poor environmental conditions species, mainly associated with meso and eutrophic states of water bodies; G2 - deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with high residence time, presenting a specific species composition under reference conditions, with higher species richness. The transition from deeper and colder reservoirs (reference sites) to shallow and warmer reservoirs (impaired sites), was evident in G2, contrarily to G1, and was mostly positively correlated to organic pollution and mineral gradients. The results presented here are fundamental for the development of a routine for monitoring ecological status according to the WFD.
2.2.	Introduction
Human activity has altered the landscape over centuries, resulting in substantial loss of habitat and aquatic diversity (Young et al., 2005). Broad-scale environmental pressures such as agriculture, point and non point-source pollution, climate change, and land-use change overlap in space and time, requiring that stress measures incorporate assessments of
cumulative impacts across multiple stressors (Dzoick et al., 2006; Brazner et al, 2007; Danz et al., 2007). Biological assemblages are important sentinels of environmental conditions, since they can be more sensitive to the combined effects of stressors than to a single stressor (Karr, 1995; Niemi and McDonald, 2004). Therefore, they integrate cumulative impacts that would not be detected in another way or that would be otherwise underestimated (e.g. habitat degradation, highly variable pollution levels due to point and non-point pollution).
Worldwide aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by the excessive release of pollutants, leading to phytoplankton blooms and to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems (Robarts, 1985; Reynolds 1992; Vasconcelos, 2001). The growing need to analyse the present state of ecosystems and to monitor and predict their rate of change, has triggered a demand for studies that explore species environment relationships and use these relationships for assessing and predicting changes under anthropogenic influence (Statzner et al., 2001; Simboura et al., 2005; Ekdahl et al., 2007). The development of indicator systems based on species environment relationships has become a widely used approach for these tasks (Statzner et al., 2001; Dziock et al., 2006). Building on this long tradition of using organisms in monitoring and assessment programs, the European Commission issued a directive mandating the use of different organism groups to monitor the integrity of inland waters and coastal regions. The Water Framework Directive (WFD - 2000/60/EC) requires the use of different organism groups such as fish, invertebrates, macrophytes and phytoplankton, either singly or together, in assessing the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. The WFD takes into account natural variation by proposing that relevant types of surface waters have to be defined first. Their characteristic species composition under reference conditions has to be described. Later on, the assessment of the ecological status shall be achieved by comparing the actual species composition to the one which would be present under undisturbed conditions (so-called reference conditions). However, such claim cannot easily be met, and several restrictions have to be taken into account when defining reference conditions, namely in artificial water bodies. Reservoirs are permanent and artificial lentic water bodies which have been consider as an integrated part of Iberic landscape. In Portugal, these structures are relatively recent and, generally, associated to multiple objectives for human benefits such as supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power and recreation. These water bodies and its biological communities are submitted to enormous
spatial-temporal variations, caused by hydric resource use regime. Although Portuguese studies concerning phytoplankton for monitoring water quality are scarce and quite recent (Vasconcelos, 1991, 2001; Boavida and Gliwicz, 1996; Domingues and Galvão, 2007), currently, a larger project is underway, led by Portuguese Water Institute (INAG) to establish ecological status of all Portuguese aquatic systems, involving biological communities including fishes, macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton and macrophytes. Accordingly, the objective of this study was the definition of the different types of all Portuguese reservoirs with hydroelectric power, located in the North and Centre of Portugal. In the present paper, it is discussed the definition of the ecological status and types of reservoirs using phytoplankton as water quality ecological indicators. Based on this, several questions were addressed: what types of reservoirs were identified in the North and Centre of Portugal? How do phytoplankton assemblages and environmental variables differ among studied sites? Are landscape scale descriptors related to natural and stressor environment good for defining reference sites? Is phytoplankton community a reliable indicator of the ecological status of artificial water bodies, such as dammed reservoirs?
2.3.	Materials and methods
2.3.1.	Study area
This study was carried out in the North and Centre of Portugal in 34 reservoirs from six catchments: Ave (1 reservoir), Cávado (6 reservoirs), Mondego (5 reservoirs), and the Portuguese part of the international basins of Lima (2 reservoirs), Douro (11 reservoirs) and Tagus (9 reservoirs) (Fig. 1).
Figure 1. Location of the 34 reservoirs studied and their distribution through six catchments: Ave, Cávado, Mondego, and the Portuguese part of the international basins of Lima, Douro and Tagus.
The main purpose of all these reservoirs is hydroelectric power, although some secondary uses are also common, such as navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation. Narrow
and steep valleys of granite bedrocks morphologically characterize the Northwest of the study area. This region presents a relatively high rainfall average (more than 2200 mm/year) when compared to Mondego and Tagus catchments, with a yearly average rainfall of approximately 800 mm/year. The Douro catchment has more than 1400 mm/year in the mountainous northern areas and less than 500 mm/year in the semi-arid central part of this region. In Portugal, although the rainfall presents a high monthly variation, 70% of precipitation occurred between October and April. This extensive geographic area represents a wide range in physical and chemical characteristics, soil use and anthropogenic pressure, including both good and poor water quality conditions. Most of the population lives in the coastal area, and Ave and Cávado basins have the largest human population density in Portugal (378 and 265 hab/km2, respectively). Therefore, many impacts associated with urbanization are present there, namely water quality problems associated with nutrient enrichment and high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) due to industrial effluent discharges, urban development and intensive agriculture.
In contrast, the eastern area of these basins is distinguished by steeper valleys and covered by remnants of native vegetation (the only national park is situated on the upper parts of the Lima and Cávado basins). Land use is dominated by agricultural activities in the more western areas. Nevertheless, the Ave basin presents the highest concentration of industry (mainly textile factories), followed by Tagus and Douro basins (mainly transformation industries and mines).
From the initial 38 reservoirs considered in our data set, 4 were removed because of missing environmental data.
The majority of these reservoirs are explored as true reservoirs (24) (see Table 1), with relatively high residence time and variations along the year, mostly related to seasons. The remaining dammed water bodies (10) are "run-of-river" reservoirs, with very low residence time (days), presenting less stability conditioned by meteorological or hydrological conditions. The main characteristics of the reservoirs are presented in Table 1.
2.3.2.	Environmental parameters and chlorophyll a
From 1996 to 2004, the environmental and biological parameters were measured by the Laboratory of Environment and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) four times per sampling year, corresponding to spring (April/May), summer (July/August), autumn (October/November)
and winter (January/February). The sampling periodicity was carried out in a yearly base on 58% of the reservoirs. The remaining reservoirs were visited biannually (26.5%) and triennially (14.7%). This sampling periodicity is also indicated in Table 1. All samples were collected at 100 m from the reservoirs' crest, at two different depths: a) near the surface (approximately 0.5 m depth); and b) near the bottom (2 m above bottom, only for environmental parameters).
Water temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen were determined in situ using a YSI handheld multiparameter probe (Yellow Spring Instruments).
To determine the ecological status of the reservoir's watersheds, a geographic information system database was created (ESRI, ArcGIS 9.0), with 12 spatial variables. These variables were classified into 4 categories of anthropogenic stress measures that are prominent in the study area:
i)	Land cover- 6 land use/land cover variables derived primarily from the Corine Land Cover (CLC, 1990 and 2000; IGEOE, 2006). Road density (km/ha basin) and proportions for the predominant CLC classes in the basin (urban areas, intensive and extensive agriculture, natural and semi-natural areas and burned areas) were determined;
ii)	Organic contamination load - 2 variables representing human population pressure (g BOD5/hab.eq.day by ha basin) and domestic animal pressure (g BOD5/animal.eq.day by ha basin);
iii)	Industrial contamination load - 3 variables representing point sources pollution, including number of quarries, mines and transformation industries in the basin (number of sources/ha basin); and
iv)	Hydrometric variations - yearly water level changes were determined by the differences between relative average water level and maximum theoretical water level. Points ii) and iii) were determined based on data from INE (2006). A five-score scale was established for all variables (from 1, High status to 5, Low status). Therefore, the sum of these five-score scales reflects the
final ecological status of the reservoir's watershed and was classified in the following classes: I,&amp;lt;18; II, 18-22; III, 22-26; IV, 26-30 and V, &gt;30. In this study, class I and II were grouped to represent reference reservoirs, and class IV and V were grouped to represent impaired sites.
Although all data characterized anthropogenic stress in some way, there was considerable variation in the types of variables used. Some variables represented the extent of nonnatural land cover (e.g., percentage of land devoted to high-intensity residential uses, or to row crops), whereas others represented specific human activities (e.g., point locations of mines) and specific stressors (e.g., hydrometric alterations). All variables were expressed, when possible, on a per-unit area basis.
Trophic classification of reservoirs was obtained from OECD model (Vollenweider and Kerekes, 1982) based on Total phosphorus, Secchi depth and mean chlorophyll a concentration (see Table 1).
2.3.3.	Phytoplankton analysis
Phytoplankton samples were collected from 1996 to 2004, as described for the environmental parameters, using a Van Dorn bottle net, at a depth of approximately 0.5 m. Phytoplankton community composition was studied through inverted microscopy, following Utermohl's method (Lund et al., 1958). For the identification of phytoplankton, samples were fixed in Lugol's solution (1%, v/v) and, when possible, identified to the species level.

From an initial data set of 710 samples from 1996 to 2004, a subdata set was used for biological and environmental data expressed by means for all sampling years and for each studied reservoir (n=34). Environmental data were standardized in order to obtain comparable (dimensionless) scales (Clarke and Warwick, 1994), and variables with more than 10% of data points missing were eliminated. The biological presence/absence matrix data was transformed in a probability occurrence matrix (number of presences/number of samples). In this matrix data, rare species (less than three presences in each dam, for all the samples) were omitted from statistical analyses (Foerster et al, 2004; Negro and Hoyos, 2005).
The statistical analysis of the environmental and biological matrices was performed based on multivariate methodologies: a) for environmental data, a cluster analysis using city-block distances and a discriminant analysis based on Discriminant Canonical Analysis (DCA); b) for biological data, a cluster analysis trough city-block distances and a comparative analysis based on non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (n-MDS) and Similarity Percentages-species contributions analysis (SIMPER).
Multivariate analysis (Cluster and DCA) were carried out using STATISTICA® Version 7 (Stat Soft 2004) and n-MDS and other routines associated were performed using PRIMER® Version 5.2.2 (Clarke and Gorley, 2001).
Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings in the set of data (biological and environmental) without providing any explanation/interpretation. In this study, the similarity measures between sites were based on Ward's method and City-block (Manhattan) distances. City-block distances measure the distance as the average difference across dimensions. In most cases, this measure yields similar results to the simple Euclidean distance. However in this case, the effect of outliers is dampened (since they are not squared).
Afterwards, the matrix of environmental data was analysed by a DCA performed with a forward stepwise method of statistical significance. The DCA was used for detecting the variables that allow discrimination between different (naturally occurring) groups.
To compare phytoplankton assemblages and to classify sites along a gradient of human disturbance, a n-MDS and other routines implemented in PRIMER were used. Phytoplankton
population was compared by Bray-Curtis distance calculations using untransformed population data (relative presence for each taxa), and the resulting distance matrix used to infer two-dimensional n-MDS plots.
Statistical differences between clusters identified in n-MDS plots were investigated by a randomization method, ANOSIM (Clarke and Warwick, 1994). This methodology employs R statistics to examine the existence of meaningful differences between the established groups for each considered factor (groups and differences between reference and impaired reservoirs). For each group, a Similarity Percentages-species contributions (SIMPER) was used to determine which species contributed most to the differences among the groups (Clarke and Gorley, 2001), based on the probability of occurrence.
2.4.	Results
2.4.1.	Environmental variables
The cluster analysis, based on city-block distances, divided the 34 reservoirs into two major groups (Fig.2). The first cluster (G1, Group 1) presents mainly reservoirs (77%) located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus). These water bodies are "run-of-river” reservoirs, characterized by having nearly the same inflow and outflow presenting a residence time of 1-4 days. In general, this group represents mainly reservoirs with a trophic state between eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic, mainly due to phosphorus concentration and low transparency (see Table 1).
The second cluster (G2, Group 2) represents reservoirs explored in a true reservoir regime, largely located in tributaries, with a high residence time (weeks to months), and in regions with higher altitudes and mean yearly rainfall. Additionally, these reservoir's basins present greater slopes and depths than the ones in Group 1 (Table 2). In this cluster it is possible to distinguish two sub-groups: G2.1 consisting of deep and colder water bodies located in the highest altitudes (634.43 m; range: 134-1600 m), precipitation values (yearly mean of 160.34 mm; range: 70-245 mm), slopes (13%; range: 6-22%) and depth (23 m; range: 134-1600 m). Usually, these sites are subject to low anthropogenic stress (see Table 1 and 2); G2.2 represents shallow and warmer reservoirs subject to higher anthropogenic stress and
characterized by lower altitudes (229.37 m; range: 65-552 m), slopes (9%; range: 4-13%) and precipitation values (yearly mean of 94.98 mm; range: 66-134 mm) (Table 2).

DCA presented very similar result to the cluster analysis. Consequently, the plot of the first two canonical factors (fig. 3a) allowed to differentiate two major groups and to discriminate between reference and impaired sites within each group. Correlation coefficients among the first two factors and individual environmental variables indicated that Root 1 presented a contrast between hardness/turbidity/NO3 and altitude/slope, whereas Root 2 displayed a contrast between OD-HP/altitude/slope and hardness/NO3/COD.

Multivariate test statistics (Wilks' lambda and corresponding F-value) indicated that there was a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) among the cluster centroids for the clusters displayed in Fig.3a. Univariate F-tests for the individual environmental variables found significant differences among the clusters means for 14 variables from the initial 26.
The first factor explained almost all the variance (92%), and was dominated by hardness (F= 204.06). The second factor accounted only for 7%.
Therefore, the ordination graph is consistent with the conclusion that reservoirs from Group
I,	"run-of-river" reservoirs, tend to present higher hardness, turbidity and nutrients concentration, namely NO3. In general, these reservoirs presented watersheds dominated by industries and agriculture that occupied about 50% of the total area (&gt;15% of intensive agriculture). The separation between reference and impaired sites from Group 2, results mainly from the environmental variables correlated with the second factor. Reference sites from Group 2 were characterized by watersheds with vast natural areas (more than 80%), small agriculture areas (about 16%, but only 3% of intensive agriculture) and good water quality (high DO levels in the hypolimnion. In contrast, impaired reservoirs (G2.2) were subject to higher pollution stress, probably related to watershed soil use, since they were less forested (65%) and presented more agricultural areas (&gt;30%). In figure 3b it is possible to see how these reservoirs were spatially clustered. The analysis clearly reflects substantial differences in water chemistry among the two groups of reservoirs defined.
In Figure 4, it is possible to observe in all the graphics a pollution gradient (right to left) from Group 2 to Group 1 and from reference to impaired reservoirs based on some environmental variables, namely conductivity, hardness, NO3, Cl, SO4 and pH and pH of the hypolimnium (pH-HP). This gradient was again verified in depth (hypolimnion) for the first three variables mention previously. In general, differences among Groups (1 and 2) and among reference versus impaired sites of Group 2, were very significant (p&lt;0.001). Contrarily these differences were less obvious between reference versus impaired sites of Group 1. Probably available data set from reference sites was not large enough to become statistically significant as to determine differences among types. There were a small number of reservoirs of this type (n=10), and from this group only two sites were selected as best available ones. Only Belver and Valeira reservoirs presented "good ecological status" (Class
II,	see Table 1) from the score based on anthropogenic stress measures.

2.4.2.	Analysis based on phytoplankton assemblages
From the 710 phytoplankton samples a total of 250 taxa were identified. From these, 55 taxa occurred less than three times in each reservoir and were excluded from the dataset (see methods). The 195 remaining taxa belonged to 7 divisions. Most important in terms of species number and presences were Chlorophyta (75 species, 40.8% of the presences), Bacillariophyta (58 species, 36.4% of the presences) and Cyanophyta (37 species, 10.2% of the presences). There were 9 taxa of Chrysophyta (4.0% of the presences), 5 taxa of Pyrrophyta (2.4% of the presences), and 3 taxa of Cryptophyta (3.8% of the presences) as well as of Euglenophyta (2.4% of the presences). The cluster analysis of phytoplankton assemblages' data, identified in general, the same two major groups as the environmental data (Fig. 5a). The patterns revealed by cluster analysis were apparent in the Non-metric MDS ordination. The n-MDS based on species/site data for all reservoirs (n=34) was able to differentiate between the two identified groups (stress value of 0.11 for 2D and 0.07 for 3D) (Fig. 5b). Additionally, this analysis was able to distinguish between undisturbed and impaired sites within Group 2 (stress value of 0.12 for 2D and 0.07 for 3D) (Fig. 5d). For Group 1, these differences are not so obvious (stress value of 0.01 for 2D and 3D) (Fig. 5c).
In general, the n-MDS analysis displayed a gradient of disturbance, allowing the scattering of sites along a magnitude range of human impact.
These results were confirmed by the pairwise analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and SIMPER tests (see table 3). The Global ANOSIM test showed that there were significant differences (p&lt;0.001) in assemblage composition between the two groups and among reference and impaired reservoirs for all data sets (n=34) and for Group 2 (see table 3). The global R-value is a useful comparative measure of the degree of separation of the groups used (Clark and Warwick, 1994). In this case, only in data from Group 1 it was not possible to distinguish between reference and impaired groups with a global R (0.351, p=0.194).
The results of SIMPER analysis that compared groups and reference versus impaired sites (Table 3) are in evident agreement with the patterns observed in the previous analyses. The average dissimilarity between groups was 71.30%, making clear the existence of a strong variability among them. A total of 108 taxa (57.14% of the total taxa) accounted for 90% of the dissimilarity between these two groups.

Box and Whisker diagrams show median, range and 25th and 75th percentiles of values for samples in each group.
A value of 68.96% and 65.35% of dissimilarity between the most and least disturbed sites (for all reservoirs and within Group 2, respectively) corroborates the hypothesis that these groups are truly different. The most characteristic phytoplankton taxa of these groups are presented in Table 4 (to a cumulative percentage of 75%). From each specific taxa composition it is possible to see that even though both groups were visibly dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta they only had six taxon in common: Melosira ambigua, Trachelomonas spp., Scenedesmus ecornis, Monoraphidium spp., Cyclotella spp. and Closterium acutum.

In Group 1, there were not obvious differences among species composition between reference and impaired sites. Indeed, from the 19 most characteristic taxa from reference sites in this group, 10 are present in impaired sites as well. This corroborates the results from Cluster and ANOSIM analysis. Both sites were clearly dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta and characterized by the presence of tolerant species, mainly associated from meso to eutrophic states of water bodies. Therefore, meso-eutraphentic species (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004), like Navicula rhynchocephala, Melosira granulata, Synedra pulchella, Pediastrum simplex and Pediastrum duplex, dominated the less disturbed sites from group 1. Additionally, impaired sites presented eutraphentic species, namely M. ambigua, Cyclotella meneghiana, Synedra ulna, S. pulchella, Nitzschia accicularis and Cocconeis placentala, associated with blue-green algae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Oscillatoria planctonica.

Dotted lines indicate reservoir groups produced by cluster analysis. Circles and triangles represent reference and impaired reservoirs, respectively.
Reference sites from Group 2 were typified by the intolerant (oligotraphentic to oligo-mesotraphentic) species, Melosira distans, Melosira italica, Tabellaria floculosa, Tabellaria fenestrata and Rhizosolenia eriensis and some mesotraphentic species like Syneda acus. Additionally, in these reservoirs, Chrysophyta, that is known to decrease with disturbance increase, had a significant importance (11.68% vs. 1.09% in the impaired sites).
Contrarily, disturbed sites were characterized mostly by tolerant species of several divisions such as Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanophyta. The present blue-green algae belonged mostly to genera whose ability to produce toxins that can affect a variety of organisms, including humans is known, like Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Anabaena spp., Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis pulverea and Microcystis flos-aquae (Vasconcelos, 1999, 2001; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000; de Fegueiredo et al., 2006).
2.5.	Discussion
Multivariate analyses based on environmental variables and phytoplankton assemblages, allowed to define the different types of surface waters from North and Centre of Portugal. From the studied 34 reservoirs, it was possible to identified and delimit two types of dammed water bodies which were characterized by different hydromorphological features, water chemistry characteristics and by a specific species composition. Group 1 had mostly "run-of river” reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with very small residence time; Group 2 was represented by deeper dammed water bodies with higher residence time, largely located in tributaries, in regions with higher altitudes and average yearly rainfall. In general, Group 1 represented reservoirs with a trophic state between eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic, mainly due to phosphorus concentration and low transparency. Since all these reservoirs belong to International river basins, the trophic state observed may be a consequence of the great anthropogenic pressures that characterized such basins, namely due to upstream intensive agriculture practiced in Spain. The differences in retention time and water depth have a large impact on how eutrophication manifests.

According the Vollenweider models, lakes with a high retention time (generally the deeper lakes) will have a lower nutrient concentration than the lakes with a very low retention time (generally the shallower ones) (GIG, 2007).
In general, median Secchi depth, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration were comparable with those reported in previous surveys (Boavida and Marques, 1996) and confirmed the hyper-eutrophic status of the majority of the reservoirs from G1. G2 reservoirs were quite variable, displaying a clear disturbance gradient, with deep colder sites, mainly oligotrophic, while warmer sites showed higher values, mostly eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic status (Boavida and Marques, 1996). Therefore, in this study, it was possible
to identify distinct gradients of human disturbance, along which environmental variables and phytoplankton assemblages changed within both reservoirs types.
Among the 26 environmental variables used in multivariate analysis, nitrate concentration and water mineral content were mainly responsible for the dissimilarity among these two groups (Fig 3). The transition observed in Figure 4, from impaired reservoirs of Group 1 to reference reservoirs of Group 2, reflects substantial differences in water chemistry between the two groups defined and within reference vs. impaired sites. These chemical properties of the water body, originated from geological characteristics of the watershed, seem to assume major importance. The results presented here are consistent with several studies developed in rivers (Stevenson 1997; Wetzel, 2001) as well as in lakes and reservoirs (Wetzel, 2001; de Figueiredo et al., 2006; Tolotti et al., 2006), who proposed geological properties as an ultimate variable that determines the composition of aquatic community assemblages on a larger spatial scale. However, at a smaller scale, physical characteristics (e.g. reservoir size, temperature/elevation) and human-influenced water quality gradients (e.g. nutrients, BOD5, COD, turbidity) were more important. The same results were obtained along spatial and environmental gradients at a larger-scale, based on diatom assemblages (Lim et al. 2007); macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and fishes (INAG, 2006).
The typology identified in hydroelectric Portuguese reservoirs and that was based on environmental variables was also corroborated by changes in phytoplankton assemblage.
This study has identified distinct gradients along which phytoplankton assemblage structure changes within north and centre Portuguese basins. The differences detected among reservoir phytoplankton indicated that species compositions were structured by factors related to geographic location, reservoir type and anthropogenic pressure.
Phytoplankton reacted to various environmental influences and therefore can be used as ecological indicator organisms. However, careful analysis is necessary to distinguish between effects of natural variability and anthropogenic disturbances. Some authors (Sabater and Nolla, 1991; Negro and Hoyos, 2005) reported that phytoplankton distribution (namely diatoms) in Spanish reservoirs were influenced by both basin geology and land use. Likewise, phytoplankton assemblages in Canadian and Greek rivers were influenced by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors (Cummings et al., 1995 and Temporaneras et al., 2000; respectively). Given the fact, that the studied reservoirs are mainly used for hydroelectric
power, must not be disregarded the effects of fluctuations in water level or discharge on species composition, directly related to the management of reservoirs, since these water bodies and its biological communities are submitted to enormous spatial-temporal variations, caused by hydric resource use regime (GIG, 2007).
The phytoplankton of many lakes, especially those of higher trophic levels, is dominated by large, colony forming species of cyanobacteria such as the referenced above. Permanent cyanobacterial dominance is, therefore, regarded as the ultimate phase of eutrophication occurring world-wide (e.g. Robarts, 1985; Pizzolon et al., 1999; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000). Excessive abundance or 'blooming' of cyanobacteria generally has detrimental effects on the domestic, industrial and recreational uses of water bodies and is in many cases a direct motivation for restoration measures (Dokulil and Teubner, 2000).
There has been extensive theoretical and empirical work done on the characterization of stressor gradients in the freshwater ecosystem context (Barbouret al., 1999; Brown and Vivas, 2005; Danz et al., 2007). Therefore, following Bailey et al. (2007) criteria, our methodology becomes more comprehensive and objective and can allow more powerful, objective bioassessments, since: (1) quantities all human activities (e.g. agriculture, mining, urban development) that could potentially affect the aquatic ecosystem, at multiple scales including the reservoir and its drainage basin; (2) does not include explicitly the effects of human activity on the aquatic ecosystem; (3) expresses human activity in scale-independent units (e.g. road density in m ha, % basin with intense agriculture) allowing to compare the relationships determined from reservoir water column to larger cumulative effects contexts. Reservoirs are artificial or heavily modified water bodies (AWB or HMWB). For HMWB and AWB, the reference conditions on which status classification is based are within the range of "Maximum Ecological Potential” (MEP). The MEP represents the maximum ecological quality that could be achieved for these systems, once all mitigation measures that do not have significant adverse effects on its specified use or on the wider environment have been applied (GIG, 2007). Therefore, only sites showing nearly undisturbed physico-chemical, hydromorphological and biological conditions were chosen as reference sites, as explained in the material and methods section (see Environmental parameters and Chlorophyll a). Nevertheless, for G1 with only 10 reservoirs, it was difficult to find a large quantity of reference sites. Most "run-of river” reservoirs in Portugal lie in densely populated regions
and therefore represent rather impacted sites. So it was not easy to find many reservoirs fulfilling reference criteria. Only 2 sites (20% of all sampled G1 sites) were selected as reference sites. Therefore, it was not possible to set reliable reference conditions for the type for the moment. Additionally, this G1 sites were less diverse in terms of species richness (see Table 2). This might be seen as an indication that the G1 sites investigated here as "best available” ones do not represent proper reference sites. Subsequently, further work has to be undertaken. Maybe it will be possible to find a larger variety of less impacted "run-of river” reservoirs or flushed lakes in other European countries. It would be interesting to compare their phytoplankton assemblages with the results presented here. Nevertheless, for the chlorophyll a concentration our results were compared with other reservoirs from the Mediterranean region. As expected for the majority of the reservoirs indicated as reference for G2 and for Valeira (reference site for G1) the chlorophyll a values were in the range (0.74-3.73 mg/m3) proposed by the European Commission in the Lake Mediterranean GIG Intercalibration Report (2007) for reference conditions in this systems.
In this paper we presented a framework that seeks to determine the types and ecological status of Portuguese reservoirs located in the North and Centre of Portugal using phytoplankton as water quality indicator. The types developed here do not contradict the proposal by INAG (2006). The abiotic types proposed were confirmed by biocoenotic types, since they were derived from the species composition. This way it is possible to assign characteristic species assemblages to these types. Such ascription is an essential prerequisite for the development of an assessment procedure according WFD where the assessment shall be done by comparing the actual species composition to the one that would be present under reference conditions. A considerable variation in the phytoplankton community could be detected among the two types of reservoirs differing significantly in terms of composition and taxa richness (see table 2). The SIMPER analyses allowed defining, for both regulated systems, the taxa typical of non disturbed and disturbed sites (Table 4b). This aspect as obvious applications for the WFD since it may contribute to define the reference situation, which is the basis of the ecological assessment. Moreover, such taxa may be classed further in a quantitative scale, since it is ranked according to the probability of belonging to each group, allowing to the definition of the four levels established by the WFD.
Phytoplankton seems to be a good indicator for multi-scale and cumulative disturbance effects with a view to integrate future worldwide monitoring in reservoirs. However, we must point out that there is a lack of information for a great number of phytoplankton species, namely concerning individual autoecology. We entirely agree with various authors who state that more research is needed to improve the knowledge of ecological responses in aquatic organisms and that this should result in important biological insights and better understanding of species-environmental relations (Travassi et al., 2004; Tolotti et al., 2006). For this reason, our future studies should focus on the documentation of clear relationships between phytoplankton communities and different human impacts on artificial water bodies.

3.1.	Abstract
Phytoplankton communities are structured by factors acting over temporal and spatial scales. Identifying which factors are driving spatial patterns in aquatic communities is a central aim of ecology. In this study, data sets of phytoplankton communities and environmental data of two Portuguese reservoirs Types (lowland and higher altitude reservoirs) were used to determine the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) on the community structure. In all data sets the multivariate ordination technique Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that regional and local scales explained the majority (9-18% and 1319%, respectively) of the taxa variance. However, for lowland reservoirs, time variables had more importance, explaining 27% of the variability in phytoplankton assemblages. Variance partitioning was used to assess the individual importance of the three spatial scales and time for the community structure of the two reservoir types. The majority of among-site variability (5.9-21.4%) was accounted for by time variables, with local, regional, and geographical scale variables accounting for 3.3-5.6%, 3.7-4.5% and 2.6-2.9%, respectively. The effects of different spatial scales on phytoplankton communities were clearly interrelated; thus, implying that phytoplankton assemblages are capable of detecting stress from catchment to site scales.
3.2.	Introduction
The quality and availability of freshwater is one of the most essential determinants for the health of ecosystems and human societies world-wide. Human activities have exploited its resources heavily, and consequently severely deteriorated freshwater ecosystems. Hydrological changes, physical disturbances, point and non-point sources of pollution, from both rural and urban activities, are all examples of processes responsible for the large-scale deterioration of freshwater systems and lentic waters, like for instance reservoirs (Dzoick et al., 2006; Brazner et al, 2007; Danz et al., 2007). Reservoirs are artificial lentic water bodies, generally, associated to multiple objectives for human benefits such as water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power and recreation. Land-use changes in the watershed, overlapping in space and time, may have considerable effects on the reservoirs, and may
lead to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these man-made systems (Reynolds and Peterson, 2000; Vasconcelos, 2001). For conservation strategies being effective, large-scale management, incorporating the importance of ecosystem scale and connectivity, is essential. Not surprisingly, integrating pattern and scale is a central theme in ecology and a topic that has received considerable attention during the last few years (Dzoick et al., 2006; Brazner et al, 2007; Danz et al., 2007). Indeed, recognition of which factor(s) structure reservoirs and lakes ecosystems has evolved from single to multiple variables and from control at the habitat scale to involving factors at the global scale (Li et al., 2001). Much interest in the importance of scale-related factors for community composition has derived from the need to better understand how organism groups or assemblages are linked with their immediate habitat and the surrounding landscape.
This information is also of interest to managers wanting to design more robust monitoring programmes. For example, although not always clearly stated, often embedded in many monitoring designs is the idea that organisms respond differently at different levels of spatial scale. Fish communities are often considered to be responding to large scale (e.g. catchment level) alterations in land use and cover, while benthic invertebrate and diatom communities are thought to respond to more local alterations in habitat quality (Johnson et al. 2007). Knowledge of scale-related responses, if present, could be used to design more robust monitoring programmes. In Europe, as worldwide, there is a long history of using biological indicators to monitor the integrity of lentic ecosystems (e.g. Moss et al., 2003). Building on this long tradition of using organisms in monitoring and assessment programmes, the European Commission issued a directive mandating the use of different organism groups to monitor the integrity of inland waters and coastal regions (European Commission, 2000). The Water Framework Directive requires the use of different organism groups such as fish, invertebrates, macrophytes and benthic diatoms, either singly or together, in assessing the ecological status of reservoirs ecosystems.
In this paper, the phytoplankton communities was used as an ecological indicator, since it represents the basis of lakes and reservoirs food webs and quickly respond to stresses and perturbations (£elik and Ongun, 2007). Therefore, in this study we investigated how phytoplankton communities from two different types of Portuguese reservoirs, located in the North and Centre of Portugal respond to different spatial factors and time. For this, we
used a relatively large data set, where phytoplankton was sampled using standardised methodology, over a long period of time (8 years) and across a gradient of land cover types in which agriculture was the predominant stressor. Using this data set, it was analysed how the variability in species composition of reservoir's phytoplankton communities was related to geographical, regional and local scale environmental factors. The objective was to assess the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) in structuring reservoirs communities and consequently determined if phytoplankton response would be related differently to large-scale, regional variability or local factors. With this information, the predictions of how human alterations affect lentic water ecosystems and herewith the planning and implementation of conservation and management programmes can be improved.
3.3.	Materials and methods
3.3.1.	Study area
This study was carried out using data from 34 reservoirs in six catchments located in central and northern Portugal. The catchments were: Ave (1 reservoir), Cávado (6 reservoirs), Mondego (5 reservoirs), the Portuguese part of the international basins of Lima (2 reservoirs), Douro (11 reservoirs) and Tagus (9 reservoirs). The main purpose of all these reservoirs is to provide hydroelectric power, although some secondary uses are also common, such as navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation. This extensive geographic area represents a wide range in physical and chemical characteristics, soil use and anthropogenic pressure, including both good and poor water quality conditions. A recent analysis of these data showed that phytoplankton community composition differed markedly between high altitude and lowland reservoirs (Cabecinha et al., in press); hence, these two reservoirs groups were analysed separately here. The two groups comprise: Type 1 - lowland "run-of-river" reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very short residence time (n=10); Type 2 - deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with long residence time (n=24) (Fig. 1). Lowland reservoirs ranged from 39 to 41 N latitude and 6 to 8 W longitude, while higher altitude reservoirs ranged from 39 to 42 N latitude and from 7 to 8 W longitude (Table 1). "Run-of-river reservoirs" were generally
situated at lower altitudes, had larger catchments, lower residence time and were higher in water mineral content (hardness and conductivity), than higher altitude reservoirs (Table 1). Additionally, Type 1 reservoirs were more nutrient rich (total phosphate and nitrates) than Type 2. Catchment land use and cover were quite different between the two reservoirs groups. Type 2 reservoirs had, on average, a higher percentage of their catchments classified as natural areas than lowland reservoirs, whereas catchments of lowland reservoirs consisted more of extensive agriculture and intensive (Table 1).
3.3.2.	Environmental parameters and chlorophyll a
From 1996 to 2004, the environmental and biological parameters were measured by the Laboratory of Environment and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) four times per sampling year, corresponding to spring (April/May), summer (July/August), autumn (October/November) and winter (January/February). The sampling periodicity was carried out on a yearly base for 58% of the reservoirs. The remaining reservoirs were visited biannually (27%) and triennially (15%) (Cabecinha et al., 2008). All samples were collected at 100 m from the reservoirs's crest, at two different depths: a) near the surface (approximately 0.5 m depth); and b) near the bottom (2 m above bottom, only for environmental parameters and chlorophyll a). Water samples were analysed following standard procedures (APHA, 1995). The environmental data set (78 variables) was divided into four categories: spatial or geographical (G) (site coordinates; 9 variables), regional (R) (9 variables, e.g. catchment land use/ cover), local (L) (26 variables, e.g. hydro-morphological) and time variables (T) (all sampling dates, i.e. interaction between sampling year and season) (see Table 2).

The geographical coordinates of the sampling site were expanded into third order polynomial terms to allow for non-linear responses (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). Including such a spatial component in the analysis allows for capturing large-scale spatial structures in the data set (Meot et al., 1998). The herewith constructed spatial component explains patterns in the species data that are not shared by any of the measured environmental data; this spatial pattern could be caused by some biological process or by environmental factors affecting the assemblage structure, but not explicitly measured in the study (Borcard et al. 1992). This also allows for testing of complex spatial trends in the data set (0kland and Eilertsen, 1994). The spatial variables were calculated by including all terms for a cubic trend surface regression (i.e. x, y, x2, xy, y2,x3, x2y, xy2 and y3), with x (latitude) and y (longitude) being the geographical co-ordinates of the sampling site (Borcard et al., 1992; Meot et al., 1998).
To determine the ecological status of the reservoir's watersheds, a geographic information system database was created (ESRI, ArcGIS 9.0), with 12 spatial variables. These variables were classified into 4 categories of anthropogenic stress measures that are prominent in the study area as explained in previous chapter (Chapter 2).
All variables were expressed, when possible, on a per-unit area basis. Points ii) and iii) were determined based on data from INE (2006). A 5-score scale was established for all variables (from 1- High status to 5- Low status). Therefore, the sum of these 5-score scales reflects the final ecological status of the reservoir's watershed and was classified in the following classes: I -&amp;lt;18; II -18-22; III - 22-26; IV - 26-30 and V - &gt;30. In this study, class I and II were grouped to represent reference reservoirs, and class III, IV and V were grouped to represent impaired sites.

3.3.3.	Phytoplankton analysis
Like the environmental parameters, phytoplankton samples were collected from 1996 to 2004 at a depth of approximately 0.5 m using a Van Dorn bottle net. Phytoplankton community composition was studied through inverted microscopy, following Utermohl's method (Lund et al., 1958). For the quantification and identification of phytoplankton, samples were fixed in Lugol's solution (1% v/v) and, when possible, identified to the species level. The abundance of each taxon was estimated on a 5-score ordinal scale (0-absent to 4-bloom).
3.3.4.	Statistical analysis
Direct gradient analysis (also known as constrained ordination, ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002) was used to determine the effect of single and combined sets of environmental variables on phytoplankton communities. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of species abundance, with detrending by segments and nonlinear rescaling was used to determine the biological turnover, or gradient length, of the species datasets. Gradient lengths were then used to select the appropriate model (ordination procedure) for the constrained ordinations. DCA of taxonomic composition gave gradient lengths &gt;3 standard deviations for axes 1 and 2, indicating that a unimodal response would adequately fit the species data (ter Braak, 1987). Accordingly, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used in the ordination of taxonomic data (ter Braak, 1986; 1987). In CCA, phytoplankton species abundance data were not transformed because they are already scored on an ordinal scale.
Rare species (less than 4 presences in each dam, for all the samples) were omitted from statistical analyses (Negro and Hoyos, 2005). When necessary environmental variables were ln (ax + 1) transformed. The factor a was determined for each chemical separately according to the procedure described in Van den Brink et al. (2000) (see table 2).

excl. - variable excluded because of negligible variance
We deviated from the usual ln(x+1) transformation because the data set frequently showed low or high values. We decided that the factor a should make 2 by taking the lowest abundance value higher than zero for x. A factor of two was chosen to avoid false discrepancy between zero concentration values and low concentration values (Van den Brink and Kater, 2006). Percentage data like land use variables were arc sin (x/100)115 transformed in order to approximate normally distributed random errors (Podani, 2000; Feld and Hering, 2007) (Table 2). All time variables (dummy variables) were not transformed (Table 2).
CANOCO's forward selection procedure (999 permutations) was used to choose the environmental variables that represented the major gradients, but did not correlate strongly with each other in explaining variability among phytoplankton assemblages. This procedure is used to remove collinear environmental variables. Environmental variables were run separately on each spatial scale (geographical, regional and local) to identify collinear variables with a variance inflation factor (VIF) &gt;20. Therefore, conductivity (data setl), % of natural areas (data set 2) and % of extensive agriculture (data set 3) were subsequently excluded from the respective environmental data set (Table 2). The significance of the environmental variables was tested with 999 Monte Carlo permutations.
A partial constrained ordination, a direct gradient analysis using covariables can be used to partition the variance, i.e. estimate the fraction of variance in community composition explained by a set of environmental variables separately (e.g. Borcard et al., 1992). Partial CCA (pCCA) was used to evaluate the relationships between four categories of explanatory variables (geographical, regional, local and time) and community composition of phytoplankton (ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002). Using pCCA, we partitioned the total variation of the biological response variables into: (i) the non-shared variation for a specific set of explanatory variables, (ii) shared variation by all measured variables and (iii) random error. The use of partial constrained ordination allowed us to test the degree of correlation between variables at varying spatial scale and community composition of phytoplankton in the two types of reservoirs. Only significant (p&amp;lt;0.001) variables were included in the aggregations of environmental variables used in the partial constrained ordinations. All time variables were included, since they are orthogonal, i.e. they all explain a unique part of the variance. Table 2 show the variables included in the three spatial categories (geographical, regional and local) as well as the variance explained by the individual variables (X1 or
CHAPTER 3
Partioning variation at different spatial scales marginal effects). Using these data, pCCA was run for phytoplankton community composition of lowland and high altitude reservoirs according to Borcard et al. (1992) and Liu (1997). Three steps were used to partition the variance in the reservoir phytoplankton data among three levels of spatial scale and time, i.e. geographical (G), regional (R), local (L) and time (T).
First, canonical ordination with no covariables (i.e. CCA) was used to estimate the total amount of variance explained (as sum of canonical eigenvalues) in the phytoplankton communities attributable to all explanatory variables (GRLT) and the total unexplained variance (1 - GRLT). A second series of ordinations with covariables (i.e. pCCA) was used to calculate variance explained by the unique effects of each category (G, R, L or T). In this step, ordinations of individual explanatory categories were run (e.g. G) with the remaining three categories as covariables (e.g. R+L+T). Thirdly, a series of partial canonical ordinations were used to calculate the shared effects by the selected predictors (e.g. R+L+T - G) by running the interaction term of interest as explanatory (R+L+T) and removing the effect of the term not of interest (e.g. G) by running these variables as covariables. All ordinations were run using CANOCO 4.5 (ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002).
3.4.	Results
3.4.1.	Phytoplankton composition
In the 633 phytoplankton samples a total of 250 taxa were identified. From these, 93 taxa occurred less than 4 times in each reservoir and were excluded from the dataset (see methods). The 157 remaining taxa belonged to 6 divisions. Most important in terms of number of taxa were Chlorophyta (41% of the taxa), Bacillariophyta (29%) and Cyanophyta (20%). There were 8 taxa of Crysophyta (5%) and 3 taxa of Pyrrophyta as well as of Euglenophyta (representing each 2% of the total taxa).
3.4.2.	Environmental gradients and their relation to phytoplankton taxa (CCA models)
The CCA models with all the selected environmental variables explained 27%, 28% and 50% of the variance in phytoplankton reservoirs communities in data set 1 (with all reservoirs), data set 2 (Type 1) and data set 3 (Type 2), respectively (Fig. 2, Table 3). In the three data
sets, the CCA models run separately on each spatial scale explained 6.6-13% by geographical variables (G), 9.3-19% by regional variables (R), 13-19% by local variables (L) and 7.3-27% by Time (T) of the variance in the reservoirs communities (Table 3).

In general, local and regional scales explained the majority of the variance in the studied phytoplankton communities, although less pronounced for Type 1 reservoirs. In these lowland reservoirs, time variables explained the largest part of the variation in species composition (Table 3).
In data set 1, the separation between the two types of reservoirs results mainly from the environmental variables correlated with the first CCA axis (Fig. 2a). Type 1 reservoirs were positively correlated with axis 1, mostly related to a perturbation gradient due to organic pollution (COD), nutrients concentration (TP, PO4 and NH4), Cl and pH. In general, these reservoirs presented larger watersheds dominated by agriculture, with significant urban and burned areas (Fig. 2a).

Figure 2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of phytoplankton assemblages in Portuguese reservoir in the ordination space of first and second axis; (A) in all studied reservoirs; (B) in 10 reservoirs ofType 1 and (C) in 24 of Type 2. (A, B and C) ordination of sampling sites, (A1, B1 and C1) ordination of phytoplankton taxa. Only significant and independent environmental variables are shown. Full environmental variable and phytoplankton taxa names are given in Table 1 and Appendix 1, respectively.
Both reservoir types were clearly dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. Cyclotella meneghiniana, Fragilaria capucina, Diatoma vulgaris, Pediastrum duplex, P. boryanum, Navicula rhynchocephala, N. cryptocephala, Cocconeis placentula and the Cyanophyta Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa, were positively correlated with Type 1 reservoirs and the perturbation gradient, i.e. with the first CCA axis (Fig. 2a1).
Type 2 reservoirs were negatively correlated with the first CCA axis and positively with precipitation, % of natural areas, slope, altitude, residence time, geographical variables and depth. The separation between reference and impaired sites of Type 2 reservoirs results mainly from the environmental variables correlated with the second axis, namely dissolved oxygen of the hypolimnium (OD-HP), chlorophyll a and SiO2 (Fig. 2a). Therefore, related with impaired sites of Type 2 reservoirs and negatively correlated with first axis and positively with the second axis were Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa, Synedra spp., Cyclotella stelligera, Sphaerocystis schroeteri. Contrarily, Tabellaria fenestrata, T. flocculosa, Melosira distans, Rhizosolenia eriensis, Crucigenia tetrapedia, Dinobryon sp., D. bavaricum and Aphanocapsa elachista were related with reference sites of Type 2 reservoirs and negatively correlated with first and second CCA axis, i.e., negatively correlated with the pollution gradient (Fig. 2a1).
In Type 1 reservoirs, the separation between impaired and less disturbed reservoirs results mainly from the environmental variables correlated with the first axis (Fig. 2b).
Less disturbed reservoirs of Type 1, namely Belver, was positively correlated with % of burned areas and negatively to depth and precipitation gradients, whereas impaired reservoirs were negatively correlated with axis 1 and positively with depth, % of urban and agriculture areas, catchment area and altitude. In general, these most perturbed reservoirs presented larger watersheds, belonging to international basins like Douro and Tagus, dominated by agriculture and having significant urban areas (Fig. 2b). Associated with Belver reservoir were Fragilaria capucina, Melosira distans, Synedra pulchella, S. utermohlii, Cyclotella stelligera, Surirella biseriata, Closterium aciculare, Staurastrum sebaldi, Mougeotia viridis, Radiococcus nimbatus and Oscillatoria tenuis. Fratel, an impaired reservoir, was positively related to the second CCA axes as well as to geographical variables and Cl, Mn and
DO gradients. This site was dominated by Melosira granulata, Melosira italica, Pediastrum duplex, P. boryanum, Monoraphidium komarkovae and Scenedesmus acuminatus (Fig. 2b1). Most impaired sites of Type 1 reservoirs were negatively correlated with axis 1, i.e., positively associated with an anthropogenic pressure gradient and associated with meso-eutraphentic to hypereutraphentic taxa (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004), namely Diatoma vulgaris, Melosira ambigua, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Navicula cryptocephala, Synedra ulna, S. acus and Oscillatoria planctonica (Fig. 2b1).
As in Type 1, in higher altitude reservoirs (Type 2) the separation between reference and impaired sites results mostly from the environmental variables correlated with the first axis (Fig. 2C). Sites on the right side of the first CA axis lay in densely populated, industrialized or agricultural areas, receiving high inputs of organic matter and industrial discharge. Therefore, these sites were positively correlated with water mineral content (Cl, hardness and conductivity), nutrients (P and N) and organic pollution gradients (Fig. 2c). In general, these disturbed sites were clearly dominated by tolerant taxa of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta, mainly associated from meso to hypereutrophic states of water bodies (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004): Diatoma vulgaris, Synedra ulna, Navicula cryptocephala, Nitzschia palea, Cocconeis placentula, Fragilaria crotonensis, Melosira granulata, Pediastrum simplex and P. duplex. This taxa appear associated with blue-green algae belonged mostly to genera whose ability to produce toxins that can affect a variety of organisms, including humans is known, like Cyanophyta Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena spp (Vasconcelos, 2001; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000) (Fig. 2c1). Reference sites of Type 2 were negatively correlated with the first CCA axis and positively with precipitation, geographical variables (latitude3, longitude3, longitude, latitude2*longitude), % of natural areas, slope, altitude, secchi depth and depth (Fig. 2c). Negatively correlated with axis 1 and associated with reference sites were mainly intolerant taxa, Diatoma hiemale, Tabellaria fenestrata, T. floculosa, Melosira distans, M. italica, Rhizosolenia eriensis, Gomphonema constrictum, Crucigenia tetrapedia, Spondylosium planum, Dinobryon sp and D. bavaricum (Fig. 2c1).
3.4.3.	Relative importance of spatial vs. time factors
Variance partitioning - CCA
The marginal or individual variances explained by single environmental variables (with no covariables) are shown in Tables 2 and 3. In general, local variables explained a large amount of the among-reservoirs variance in both lowland and higher altitude reservoirs. In lowland reservoirs (Type 1), local variables were only exceeded by the time variables. Regional variables explained a similar amount of the total variance as local variables, while geographical variables explained less (Table 3). The single best predictors of phytoplankton communities in Type 1 reservoirs were depth, % of extensive agriculture, longitude and sampling dates, in local, regional, geographical and temporal scales, respectively (Table 2).
In general, environmental variables explained less of the among-reservoir differences in community types of higher altitude compared with lowland reservoirs. Local variables explained the largest part of the variance, followed by regional, time and geographical factors (Table 3). The best predictors of phytoplankton assemblages in Type 2 reservoirs were conductivity, hardness and Cl, precipitation, latitude3 and sampling dates, in local, regional, geographical and temporal scales, respectively (Table 2). Similar results were obtained with data set 1, with all the studied reservoirs (Table 2).
Variance partitioning - pCCA
Analysis of CCA models and the variance explained by single predictor variables showed the importance of geographical, regional, local and time factors on among-site differences in phytoplankton communities. However, this approach does not provide information on the unique effect or shared variance (conditional effects) among the different types of predictor variables. The three categories of spatial scale and time (G, R, L, T) explained 50% of the among-site variance in community composition of lowland reservoirs (Table 3, Fig. 3a). For higher altitude reservoirs, the amount of variance explained was somewhat slighter; 28% (Table 3, Fig. 3c). Partial constrained ordination (pCCA) of lowland and higher reservoir communities showed that the unique effect of geographical, regional and local variables was similar among the two types studied, explaining slightly more variance in Type 2 (Table 3, Fig. 3a, and 3c). However, time variables assumed a major importance in explaining among-site differences in phytoplankton community composition, namely in Type 1 reservoirs.
Geographical variables explained 2.6% for lowland reservoirs and 2.9% for higher altitude reservoirs. Regional variables explained slightly more of the among-site differences in community composition. The amount of variance explained by local-scale variables ranged from 3.3% (in Type 1) to 5.6% (in Type 2 reservoirs). By contrast, time variables explained substantially more of the among-site variance in community composition (Fig. 3a and 3c). The amount of shared variance accounted by the three levels of spatial scale and time also varied markedly between reservoir groups. The total shared variance explained substantially more, of the variance in phytoplankton communities, in type 1 than in type 2 reservoirs (Fig. 3a and 3c). The role of shared (conditional) effects is even clearer if separately calculated at each scale (Fig. 3b and 3d). In lowland reservoirs (Type 1), at geographical, regional and local scales, shared effects were much higher than unique effects (see Fig. 3b). In higher altitude reservoirs at these spatial scales (G, R and L) unique and shared effects were similar. Contrarily, the fraction of the total variance attributed to time variables was 21.4% in lowland sites and 7.3% in higher altitude sites (Fig. 3d). The value of the shared effects for both reservoirs was much smaller than the fraction of the variation explained independently by covariables. Not all species are equally well explained by the same set of environmental variables. The fit for species can be used as a measurement to find out which species are well represented and the percentage of variance fit by each set of explanatory variables. The percentage of variance explained by the three spatial factors and time with respect to the unconstrained variance differs among the different species (Appendix 1). In Type 1 reservoirs, all taxa are best explained by time factors, especially Pseudanabaena catenata, P. limnetica. Oscillatoria planctonica and Microcystis flos-aquae. In Type 2 reservoirs, Scenedesmus spp. had their distributions mostly explained by the geographical factors. Scenedesmus opoliensis, Asterionella formosa, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Tabellaria floculosa were amongst the most related to the regional group of variables (Appendix 1).

Figure 3. Variance partitioning of phytoplankton communities (pCCA) in reservoirs of Type 1 (A, B) and Type 2 (C, D) using environmental variables at three spatial scales and time. In A and C, overall joint effects were not further subdivided. In B and D, Unique (gray bars) and joint (black bars) effects are given separately for each scale: time (T), local (L), regional (R) and geographical (G). GRTL represents variance explained by all environmental variables.
Local variables explained mostly the distribution of Stephanodiscus hantschii, Anabaena spp, Oscillatoria linosa, Pediastrum duplex, Rhizosolenia sp, Anabaena spp, Cocconeis placentula. Gomphonema constrictum, Microcystis pulverea, M. aeruginosa and Melosira varians were amongst the most related to time variables in higher altitude reservoirs. Finally, Melosira distans, Diatoma vulgaris and Fragilaria crotonensis were mostly explained by the three spatial factors (Appendix 1). Figure 4 presents the taxa most well represented (higher fit) in each set of explanatory variables (G, R and L) for both reservoir types. In Type 1, independently of the scale in general, impaired sites were clearly dominated by tolerant taxa of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta, mainly associated from meso to hypereutrophic states of water bodies: Diatoma vulgaris, Melosira granulata, Navicula cryptocephala, Synedra acus, Fragilaria crotonensis, Stephanodiscus hantschii, Actinastrum gracillimum, Schroederia setigera and Scenedesmus denticulatus. Contrarily, reference sites were dominated by oligotraphentic to meso-eutrophic taxa: Melosira distans, Synedra pulchella, Fragilaria capucina, Melosira varians, Actinastrum gracillimum and Ankistrodesmus falcatus (Fig. 4). In Type 2, disturbed reservoirs were also dominated by tolerant taxa of Bacillariophyta namely Fragilaria capucina and Navicula cryptocephala and Chlorophyta, mostly Scenedesmus sp. and cianobacterias. Regarding, reference sites of Type 2, dominant taxa were mainly intolerant (oligotraphentic to oligo-mesotraphentic), Tabellaria fenestrata, T. floculosa, Asterionella formosa, and Rhizosolenia sp (Fig. 4).
3.5.	Discussion
Several studies have addressed the role of spatial and temporal scales in river and lake environment-community relationships (Pan et al., 2004; Leira and Sabater, 2005; Feld and Hiering, 2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Holopainen et al. 2008). However, only few phytoplankton studies considered spatial factors explicitly (see Soininen, 2007), especially in reservoirs (Sabater and Nolla, 1991; Negro and Hoyos, 2005; INAG, 2006). Multivariate analyses allowed to define the importance of environmental variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional and local) and time in structuring phytoplankton communities in different types of surface waters from North and Centre of Portugal.

Figure 4. Partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis for the two types of reservoirs, with 157 taxa and environmental variables at three different spatial scales: geographical (G), regional (R) and local (L). 1 and 2 refer to reservoirs of type 1 and 2, respectively. Full environmental variable and phytoplankton taxa names are given in table 1 and Appendix 1, respectively. Only taxa with higher fit and best correlated with axis one are shown.
From the studied 34 hydroelectric-power reservoirs, it was possible to identify two types of dammed water bodies. Type 1 - lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very low residence time, characterized by higher water mineral content and concentrations of nutrients; Type 2 - deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with a high residence time. This study has identified distinct gradients along which phytoplankton assemblage structure changes within hydroelectric Portuguese reservoirs. The differences detected among reservoir phytoplankton communities indicated that taxa compositions were differentially structured by factors related to geographic location, catchment land use, hydromorphological variables and time. Given the broad spatial gradients studied here, it was expected that constrained ordination and CCA models showed a larger importance of geographical (latitude, longitude) variables in explaining among-site differences in community composition. In spite, there was only a little amount of variance explained by geographical factors and only one single spatial coordinate (or combination thereof) was among the best predictors of phytoplankton assemblage (Table 2 and 3). Local and regional (e.g. land use) factors explained a larger part of the among-site variance in phytoplankton community composition. The best predictors were: depth, residence time, Cl, chlorophyll a and nutrient gradients at local scale (L) and % of extensive agriculture, % of urban area and catchment area at regional scale (R), for Type 1 reservoirs. Conductivity, hardness and Cl and PT gradients (L), precipitation, % of intensive agriculture (R) and latitude and latitude2 (at a geographical scale) were shown to be strong predictors of community structure in Type 2 reservoirs. Conductivity, hardness, N and P concentrations were strongly related to agricultural activity, this was not too surprising given the wide range of agricultural land use in both the lowland and higher catchments, namely extensive (19 to 33%, in Type 2 and type 1, respectively) and intensive agriculture (5.2 % in Type 2 and 16 in Type 1). The importance of local and to some extent even regional variables agrees with a number of previous studies, even for different organisms.
For example, earlier studies have shown changes of nutrient concentration, habitat and flow regime, often associated with changes in catchment land use/cover, to be good predictors of fish (e.g. Snyder et al., 2003; INAG, 2006), macroinvertebrate (e.g. Statzner et al., 2001; Death and Joy, 2004), macrophyte (e.g. INAG, 2006) and benthic diatoms (e.g. Lim et al. 2007) communities.
The influence of land use on water quality in streams and reservoirs is scale dependent and varies in time and space (Buck et al., 2004). Numerous studies have found the landscape structure to be the main factor influencing the nutrient and organic matter runoff from watersheds. This has been shown at the global scale, as well as at the regional and local scales for catchments of dominatingly agricultural use, for forested areas and for heterogeneous multifunctional landscapes (Chen et al., 2002; Buck et al., 2004).
Much reservoir research has traditionally focused on the effects of species interactions at small spatial scales (e.g. Lancaster and Belyea, 2006). However, in recent years there has been a growing interest in better understanding of landscape-level effects on ecosystem structure and function; an interest fuelled in part by managers wanting to design more effective monitoring and conservation programmes.
Reservoir's communities are structured by processes operating over multiple spatial scales (e.g. Negro and Hoyos, 2005). These interactions between scale-related processes are, however, often correlated and predictable which has resulted in a number of hierarchical frameworks (Frisell et al., 1986).
The variance decomposition technique used in this work (pCCA) allowed us to determine the unique effect of geographical, regional and local level (as well as time variables) descriptors on community composition by running spatial and time factors as covariables.
The unique variance explained by geographical variables (G) was similar among the two reservoir types (3%, approximately), regional-level factors explained slightly more in Type 2 (3.7-4.5%), since this higher altitude reservoirs were distributed across a broader latitudinal gradient than lowland reservoirs. Local scale factors explained slightly more of the variance in community structure among sites (3.3 and 5.6%, in Type 1 and 2, respectively). These results lend support to a number of previous studies (e.g. Leira and Sabater, 2005; INAG, 2006; Lim et al. 2007; Soininen, 2008). By contrast, time factors explained the highest amount of variance in community structure among sites (from 7.3 to 21%), but surprisingly as single predictors sampling dates only explained 0.2-1.5% in Type 1 and even less in Type 2 (0.1-0.6%). This could be related to the higher number of time variables used in the analysis (34) when compared to other variable factors (4-5 variables in G, 7-8 in R and 6-16 in L factor). This is corroborated by the fact that after accounting for time effects (by running this variable as covariable), the spatial factors (G, R, and L) explained a similar amount of
variance in Type 1 reservoirs (21% and 22% explained by time and spatial scales, respectively). In Type 2, spatial factors together explained a larger amount of variance in phytoplankton composition among sites than time 19% vs. 7.3%, respectively). Nevertheless, with the same number of variables used in the analysis, time explained much more of the variance in community structure in Type 1 than in Type 2 reservoirs, probably related to the management of reservoirs. "Run-of-river" reservoirs (Type 1), with very low residence time (days), presenting lesser stability conditioned by meteorological or hydrological conditions (directly associated with variations along the year and to seasons), than reservoirs which are explored as true reservoirs (Type 2), with relatively high residence time (GIG, 2007).
Regardless of how different sets of variables are classified, our results and those of earlier studies are consistent with hierarchy theory; namely that species composition at a site is the product of environmental filters operating at successive spatial scales (Poff, 1997). Frissell et al. (1986), defined the "hierarchical concept of landscape", were spatial scales are related or even interdependent, at least unidirectionally from large to small spatial scales. This was reflected in our study by the strong shared effects of spatial scales in both reservoir types. The amount of shared variance accounted for by the three levels of spatial scale and time varied markedly between reservoir groups. The total shared variance accounted for 18% and 7.6%, in Type 1 and Type 2 respectively (Fig. 3). The role of shared (conditional) effects is even clearer if separately calculated at each scale (Fig. 3). For G, R and L factors, shared effects were much higher than unique effects in Type 1 and very similar in Type 2. Contrarily, for time variables, the fraction of the total variance explained was 21% and 7.3% on Type 1 and 2, respectively. Since the value of the shared effects for both reservoirs was much smaller than the fraction of the variation explained independently by covariables, we can conclude that time variables were primarily explaining unique variation in species composition.
A number of recent publications have stressed that phytoplankton communities seem to be relatively strongly spatially structured across multiple spatial scales (Fallu et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2005; INAG, 2006; Soininen, 2007). According to these studies, pure spatial factors account for an important amount of the community variation at geographical and regional scales. This important fraction of variation probably can not be explained by local abiotic factors (Soininen, 2007).
Not all species are equally well explained by the same set of environmental variables, as shown in this work (see appendix 1). The fit for species can be used as a measurement to find out which species are well represented and the percentage of variance fit by each set of explanatory variables (Leira and Sabater, 2005). Nevertheless, phytoplankton composition responds to a clear disturbance gradient. In general, disturbed sites were clearly dominated by tolerant taxa of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. Therefore, in both reservoirs, meso-eutraphentic to hypereutraphentic taxa (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004), namely Cocconeis placentula, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Diatoma vulgaris, Melosira ambigua, Navicula cryptocephala, Nitzschia palea, Synedra ulna and S. acus were positively associated with an anthropogenic pressure gradient. Contrarily, associated with reference sites were mainly intolerant (oligotraphentic to oligo-mesotraphentic) taxa, Diatoma hiemale, Tabellaria fenestrata, T. floculosa, Melosira distans, M. italica, Rhizosolenia eriensis and Gomphonema constrictum (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004).
Disagreements regarding which factors are directly related to reservoirs communities might emanate in part from the study design, as studies at different spatial and temporal scales are prone to give different answers (Wiley et al., 1997) or be an artefact of how the various studies have classified variables of spatial scale.
Not only scale-related effects, but a number of other factors should be considered when selecting response variables or organism group(s) to monitor the effects human-induced stress on reservoirs integrity (e.g. Rosenberg and Resh, 1993). Ideally, focus should be on selecting response variables that are related causally and/or strongly associated (proximate indicator) with the type and degree of perturbation to be monitored (e.g. Downes et al., 2002). Phytoplankton seems to be a good indicator for multi-scale and cumulative disturbance effects with a view to integrate future worldwide monitoring in reservoirs. However, we must point out that there is a lack of information for a great number of phytoplankton species, namely concerning individual autoecology (Travassi et al., 2004; Tolotti et al., 2006). With this work we try to contribute to the understanding of species-
environmental relations and ecological responses of phytoplankton communities in aquatic ecosystems, namely in artificial water bodies.
Combining conceptual models and empirical data is a cost-effective means of designing robust monitoring programmes. Here we studied phytoplankton communities commonly used in monitoring programmes across Europe as well as elsewhere to determine their response to three levels of spatial scale and time. The effects of different spatial scales on phytoplankton communities were clearly interrelated; thus, implying that phytoplankton assemblages are capable of detecting stress from catchment to site scales. Scaling of hydromorphological stress and relation to the reservoir phytoplankton community are current topics in applied aquatic ecology. In Europe, WFD has led to increased efforts to develop reservoir quality assessment systems. These assessment systems are an integrated part of future River basin Management plans, which aims at rehabilitating and/or maintaining the biological and functional integrity of rivers, and respective reservoirs. A fundamental understanding of community function is needed to meet these objectives. Our findings of the importance of local and regional scale factors on community structure of reservoirs lend support to earlier studies, namely on the growing body of literature arguing the importance of habitat and large-scale (landscape) factors on reservoir ecosystems. Additional studies are required to understand the relation of phytoplankton community and human impact, particularly with respect to hydrological stress, directly related to the management of reservoirs.

4.1.	Abstract
The objective of this study is to explore a suitable way of monitoring and assess water quality of two types of Mediterranean reservoirs using phytoplankton communities. The Principal Response Curve (PRC) method was used to analyse changes in species composition and environmental variables between different sites over time. This allowed to estimate the degree of impairment at a particular site by contrasting it with a reference site, was proposed by WFD. Sampling was carried out in 34 reservoirs during four seasons, through a period of eight years (1996 to 2004). The PRC analysis, for both reservoirs types, showed significant differences between the reference and impaired sites, reflecting the levels of disturbance that they experience over the study period, manly associated with a clear spatial gradient related to eutrophication.
4.2.	Introduction
In the face of global change, declines in environmental quality are of increasing concern. Therefore, assessing the well-being of ecological systems and instituting mitigation measures has become a priority. Recent European legislation has reinforced this need. The major aim of the Water Framework Directive (WFD; European Commission, 2000) is to reach a good ecological status for all water bodies in the member states of the European Union by 2015.
Reservoirs are artificial water bodies where the reference conditions on which status classification is based are within the range of “Maximum Ecological Potential” (MEP). The MEP represents the maximum ecological quality that could be achieved for these systems, once all mitigation measures that do not have significant adverse effects on its specified use or on the wider environment have been applied (GIG, 2007). The assessment of the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems shall be achieved by comparing the actual species composition to the one which would be present under undisturbed conditions (so-called reference conditions). However, many of the tools and instruments presently available lack the rigour required for both the unambiguous detection of ecological impacts and the presentation of those impacts in an easily communicable way to policymakers, managers and stakeholders who are usually not biologists (Pardal et al., 2004). The implementation of
the WFD has prompted the search for novel methodologies and biological indicators (Statzner et al., 2001; Simboura et al., 2005; Ekdahl et al., 2007) for the assessment of environmental quality, because traditional approaches are unable to capture entirely the natural variability of ecosystems. The development of indicator systems based on species environment relationships has become a widely used approach for these tasks (Statzner et al., 2001; Dziock et al., 2006).
The summary ordination plots and diagrams from traditional ordination methods (e.g. redundancy analysis: RDA; principal component analysis: PCA; or multi-dimensional scaling: MDS) can still remain illusive and obscure to non-specialists and consequently are difficult to interpret (Warwick and Clarke 1991). This is especially true when a time factor is present within the data, because temporal trajectories are often non-linear in such plots.
One approach to deal with the complexity of time dependency is the application of the principal response curves (PRC) method (Van den Brink and Ter Braak 1999). PRC analysis was originally conceived for aquatic ecotoxicology, but potentially it has much wider applications (Pardal et al., 2004). PRC has advantages over traditional ordination techniques, since it permits a formal and powerful statistical analysis of temporal (long-term) data series from spatial gradients. PRC analysis uses selected areas as reference sites and other areas (treated or impacted areas) are compared to these reference sites, allowing changes in the environmental quality to be assessed over time. Additionally, PRC analysis has the advantage of providing an interpretation of impacts and change at the species level, because individual species responses to stress agents can be inferred from the PRC curves. One of the most common environmental problems is the increase of organic pollution in surface waters that usually leads to a shift in primary producers. In common with worldwide lentic water bodies, in general Portuguese reservoirs, has undergone significant eutrophication due to organic enrichment (Vasconcelos, 1991, 2001; Boavida and Gliwicz, 1996; INAG, 2006; Domingues and Galvao, 2007). In Portugal, these structures are relatively recent and, generally, associated to multiple objectives for human benefits such as supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power and recreation. These water bodies and its biological communities are submitted to enormous spatial-temporal variations, caused by hydric resource use regime. In the present paper, we explore the use of PRC analysis in ecosystem health assessment using monitoring data from the majority of the Portuguese reservoirs with hydroelectric power, located in the North and Centre of Portugal. The main goal is to explore a suitable way of monitoring and assess the ecological status of two types of Mediterranean reservoirs using phytoplankton
communities, through the changes in species composition and environmental variables, over time.
4.3.	Materials and methods
4.3.1.	Study area
This study was carried out using data from 34 reservoirs in six catchments (Ave, Cávado, Mondego, Lima Douro and Tagus) located in central and northern Portugal. The main purpose of all these reservoirs is to provide hydroelectric power, although some secondary uses are also common, such as navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation. This extensive geographic area represents a wide range in physical and chemical characteristics, soil use and anthropogenic pressure, including both good and poor water quality conditions. A recent analysis of these data showed that phytoplankton community composition differed markedly between high altitude and lowland reservoirs (Cabecinha et al., 2008); hence, these two reservoirs groups were analysed separately here. The two groups comprise: Type 1 - lowland "run-of-river" reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very short residence time (n=10); Type 2 - deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with long residence time (n=24) (Fig. 1). "Run-of-river reservoirs" were generally situated at lower altitudes, had larger catchments, lower residence time and were higher in water mineral content (hardness and conductivity), than higher altitude reservoirs (Table 1 and 3). Additionally, Type 1 reservoirs were more nutrient rich (total phosphate and nitrates) than Type 2. Catchment land use and cover were quite different between the two reservoirs groups. Type 2 reservoirs had, on average, a higher percentage of their catchments classified as natural areas than lowland reservoirs, whereas catchments of lowland reservoirs consisted more of extensive agriculture and intensive (Cabecinha et al., submited).
4.3.2.	Environmental parameters and chlorophyll a
From 1996 to 2004, the environmental and biological parameters were measured by the Laboratory of Environment and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) four times per sampling year, corresponding to spring (April/May), summer (July/August), autumn (October/November) and winter (January/February).

Water temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen were determined in situ using a YSI handheld multiparameter probe (Yellow Spring Instruments). The other environmental variables were determined according to methodologies described by APHA (1995).
To determine the ecological status of the reservoir' watersheds, a geographic information system database was created (ESRI, ArcGIS 9.0), with 12 spatial variables. These variables were classified into 4 categories of anthropogenic stress measures that are prominent in the study area see table 2 for details.

All variables were expressed, when possible, on a per-unit area basis. Points ii) and iii) were determined based on data from INE (2006). A 5-score scale was established for all variables (from 1- High status to 5- Low status). Therefore, the sum of these 5-score scales reflects the final ecological status of the reservoir's watershed and was classified in the following classes: I -&amp;lt;18; II -18-22; III - 22-26; IV - 26-30 and V - &gt;30 (see Table 1).
Additionally, in this study, class I and II were grouped to represent reference reservoirs, and class III, IV and V were grouped to represent impaired sites. All variables were expressed, when possible, on a per-unit area basis.
4.3.3.	Phytoplankton analysis
Like the environmental parameters, phytoplankton samples were collected from 1996 to 2004 at a depth of approximately 0.5 m using a Van Dorn bottle net. Phytoplankton community composition was studied through inverted microscopy, following Utermohl's method (Lund et al., 1958). For the quantification and identification of phytoplankton, samples were fixed in Lugol's solution (1% v/v) and, when possible, identified to the species level. The abundance of each taxon was estimated on a 5-score ordinal scale (0-absent to 4-bloom).
4.3.4.	Statistical analysis
The spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities along the perturbation gradient were analysed by the PRC ordination technique. PRC is based on RDA, the constrained form of Principal Component Analysis, a full account of which can be found in Van den Brink and Ter Braak (1998, 1999), Cuppen et al. (2000), Frampton et al. (2000a,b, 2001) and Van den Brink et al. (2000, 2003). The PRC method is a multivariate technique especially designed for data analysis from microcosm and mesocosm experiments.
Due to its novelty, this method was mainly applied in aquatic ecotoxicology (Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999, Cuppen et al., 2000, Van den Brink et al., 2000, 2003), with some incursions into soil ecology (Frampton et al., 2000a,b, 2001). However, this approach has potential for a wider application in community ecology and in the evaluation of ecosystem integrity. The method analyses differences in species composition between sites at each time point, similar to other ordination techniques. However, one advantage of this method is that any temporal changes in the 'control' (the reference sites, in the present study) are constrained in the plot to a horizontal line. Thus PRC creates a graphical display with time (sampling dates) as a horizontal line and the basic response pattern (cdt) of each site d at each time t in relation to control site on the vertical axis (by definition, the control site has always a cdt of zero for every time). When these coefficients are plotted for each time point, a principal response curve of the community is obtained for each site in comparison with the control site (Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999). This permits an easily-understood representation of the temporal changes in the phytoplankton assemblages at each site in relation to the reference control site.

An additional advantage of the PRC technique is that it allows for the detection of effects at the species level. Derived species weight (bk) is the factor by which the basic response pattern is multiplied to attain the fitted response of species k (Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999). Species weights thus measure the affinity of a particular species to the community response pattern and can be used to estimate species relative abundance for each sampling date in each site compared to the control, using the expression exp (bk * cdt). In practical terms, taxa with a positive species weight are expected to decrease in abundance relatively to the control in the highest treatment levels (i.e. the most eutrophic area in our case), whereas taxa with negative weights are expected to increase. In PRC analysis, as described by Van den Brink and Ter Braak (1999), the statistical model for the species abundance data is:
Yd( j)tk = Y0tk + bkcdt + ^d( j)tk
where Yd(j)tk is the abundance of species k in replicate j of site d at sampling date t, Y0tk is the mean abundance of species k on date t at the control site d0, cdt is a basic response pattern for every site d and sampling date t, bk is the weight of each species with this basic response pattern and Ed(j)tk is an error term with mean zero and variance ak 2. By definition, c0t = 0 for every t. When the coefficients cdt are plotted against sampling date t, the resulting PRC diagram displays a curve for each site that can be interpreted as the principal response curve of the community (Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1999).
In addition to providing a concise graphical summary of changes in community structure, PRC analysis allows an estimate of the variance in the data set that is explained by a site. A PRC diagram aims to maximize the amount of variance due to sites; the higher the proportion of the variance displayed, the more closely will the fitted relative abundance of individual taxa inferred from the diagram match the observed relative abundance. The null hypothesis assumes that the differences between impacted and reference sites are absent and that the PRC diagram does not capture the site variance, both hypotheses can be tested using Monte Carlo permutation tests. A complete description of the method is provided in Van den Brink and Ter Braak (1999).
In the present study, the differences in phytoplankton community composition between the different ecological classes for the two Portuguese reservoir types were visualized by PRC (Principal Response Curves; Van den Brink and Ter Braak, 1998;1999) using the CANOCO
software package version 4.5 (Ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002). The analysis results in a diagram showing years on the x-axis and the first Principal Component of the differences in community structure between class I and the other classes on the y-axis. This yield a diagram showing the deviations in time between classes, with class I as reference. The species weights are shown in a separate diagram, and indicate the affinity the species have with this indicated difference. The taxa with a high positive weight are indicated to show a response similar to the deviations indicated by PRC, those with a negative weight, one that is opposite to the response indicated by PRC. Taxa with a near zero weight are indicated to show a response very dissimilar to the response indicated by PRC or no response at all.

The data sets of the physico-chemical variables associated to the water column were also analysed using PRC. In these analyses the variables were centred and standardized before analysis to account for differences in measurement scale (Kersting and Van den Brink, 1997). The variables related to chemical concentrations (TColf, FColf, NH4, Fe, Mn, Cl, NO3, PO4, TP, SiO2) were Ln(ax+1) transformed, with a being determined following Van den Brink et al. (2000) (see Table 4). Scaling used was adjusted to focus on inter-sample distances. Default
values were chosen for all remaining options (Ter Braak and Smilauer 2002). This is one of the first examples in which monitoring data are analysed by PRC, how PRC can be used to analyse monitoring data is described more in detail in Van den Brink et al. (2008).
4.4.	Results
From the 633 phytoplankton samples a total of 250 taxa were identified. From these, 93 taxa occurred less than 4 times in each reservoir and were excluded from the dataset (see methods). The 157 remaining taxa belonged to 6 divisions. Most important in terms of taxa number were Chlorophyta (41% of the taxa), Bacillariophyta (29%) and Cyanophyta (20%). There were 8 taxa of Crysophyta (5%) and 3 taxa of Pyrrophyta as well as of Euglenophyta (representing each 2% of the total taxa).
Throughout the period 1996 to 2004, the effects of anthropogenic pressure on phytoplankton assemblages were studied in 34 Portuguese reservoirs with hydroelectricpower. Over these temporal and spatial scales, distinct changes in the structure of the phytoplankton communities were observed. The diversity of the phytoplankton communities in the two types of reservoirs is presented in figure 2A. These clearly show that the impaired sites of both types always had greater species richness than the less or none impaired sites. Additionally, was assed the diversity of the phytoplankton communities associated only to well known tolerant taxa, namely Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and meso-eutraphentic to hypereutraphentic diatoms (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004) (Fig. 2B and 2C). These figures clearly show that the greater species richness of impaired sites, in both types of reservoirs, was always associated with higher species richness of tolerant taxa. In general, over the past 8 yr, there was a decline in biodiversity over time with 1998 and 1999 showing higher species richness (Fig. 2A).
The PRC analysis, for both reservoirs types, shows a clear spatial gradient related to eutrophication (Figs. 3 and 4). In our analysis, for Type 1 reservoirs, in respective of the differences in phytoplankton communities between the different ecological classes, sampling date accounted for 29% of the total variation in species composition could be attributed to differences between sampling dates, 12% exclusively by the differences between years, 4% exclusively by differences between season, while the remaining 13% is explained by the interaction between season and year.

Figure 2. Comparison of species richness from reference and impaired sites of both reservoir types (A). Figures B and C show, for reference and impaired sites, the comparison between the diversity of the phytoplankton communities associated only to well known tolerant taxa, namely Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and meso-eutraphentic to hypereutraphentic diatoms, of Type 1 and Type 2, respectively.
Differences in species composition between the reservoirs with different ecological status explained 46% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the variation in species composition; 20% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the latter is displayed in the diagram (Fig. 3A). The remaining 25% of the total variance is variation between reservoirs with the same ecological status.
The PRC diagram shows community dynamics over 8 years, where the species composition at this reservoirs changes progressively in time, i.e. species either increase or decrease in abundance over time, or do not change at all. The most affected taxa were the diatoms Melosira distans and Fragilaria capucina, both with negative weights, indicating a reduced abundance, compared to that in the reference site (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the taxa with the highest positive weight (i.e. which increased in abundance) were the diatoms Cyclotella meneghiniana and Melosira ambigua (Fig. 3A), though other taxa are also shown to have increased in time (e.g. Diatoma vulgaris, Nitzschia sp^ Navicula cryptocephala and Synedra ulna). Thus, the sign of the species scores indicates the direction of the changes in abundance, while the magnitude of the score reflects the size of the changes.
Also for Type 1 reservoirs, the differences between reference and impaired sampling sites measured by physic-chemical parameters are shown in Figure 3B. Thirty-nine percent of the total variation in environmental variables could be attributed to differences between sampling dates, 17% exclusively by the differences between years, 12% exclusively by differences between season, while the remaining 10% is explained by the interaction between season and year. Differences in environmental variables between the reservoirs with different ecological status explained 41% (p &gt; 0.05) of the variation in species composition; 25% (p &gt; 0.05) of the latter is displayed in the diagram (Fig.3B). The remaining 20% of the total variance is variation between reservoirs with the same ecological status. The Monte Carlo permutation test indicated that there weren't significant differences between reservoirs of the different classes. The major differences between reference and impaired sites were observed in 1998 and 1999. For these impaired sites, compared to the less disturbed ones, lower levels of chlorophyll a, Cl and phosphorus (TP and PO4) are indicated together with higher levels of NO3 and Secchi disk depth. Larger or smaller differences between the class I and other ecological classes seem to be associated with higher or lower abundances of diatoms Melosira ambigua and Cyclotella meneghiniana (Fig. 3A), probably related to higher or lower levels of nutrients, namely NO3.

Figure 3. Diagram showing the first component of the PRC of the differences in taxa composition of the phytoplankton (A) and measured physico-chemical parameters (B) between the Type 1 reservoirs having different ecological status (II through V). The taxa and parameter weights shown in the right part of the diagram represent the affinity of each taxa and parameter, respectively, with the response shown in the diagram. Positive weight indicated a similar taxa response to the deviations indicated by PRC, a negative weight, one that is opposite to the response indicated by PRC. Taxa with a near zero weight are indicated to show a response very dissimilar to the response indicated by PRC or no response at all. For the sake of clarity, only species with a weight larger than 1 or smaller than -1 and parameters with a weight larger than 0.25 or smaller than -0.25, are shown. In sampling date, 1, 2, 3 and 4 represent spring, summer, autumn and winter of each year, respectively.
The PRC diagram showing the differences in taxa composition between the Type 2 reservoirs having different ecological status is shown in figure 4A. Nine percent of the total variation in species composition could be attributed to differences between sampling dates, 4% exclusively by the differences between years, 2% exclusively by differences between season, while the remaining 3% is explained by the interaction between season and year. Differences in species composition between the reservoirs with different ecological status explained 27% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the variation in species composition; 21% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the latter is displayed in the diagram (Fig. 4A). The remaining 64% of the total variance is variation between reservoirs with the same ecological status.
The PRC diagram shows that were fewer differences between phytoplankton communities of reservoirs belonging to status II and III when compared to the reference sites. Contrarily, for reservoirs of status IV and V, more impaired, these differences were greater. The most affected taxa were Tabellaria fenestrata (diatom) and the Dinobryon sp (Chrysophyta), both with positive weights, indicating a reduced abundance, compared to that in the reference site (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the taxon with the highest negative weight (i.e. which increased in abundance) were the Cyanophyta Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Fig. 4A). Other species are also shown to have increased in time (e.g. Microcystis flos-aquae and Anabaena spp.) (Fig. 4A).
The differences between reservoirs with different ecological status and reference sampling sites measured by physic-chemical parameters are shown in Figure 4B. Eighteen percent of the total variation in environmental variables could be attributed to differences between sampling dates, 7% exclusively by the differences between years, 8% exclusively by differences between season, while the remaining 3% is explained by the interaction between season and year. Differences in environmental variables between the reservoirs with different ecological status explained 31% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the variation in species composition; 52% (p &amp;lt;0.001) of the latter is displayed in the diagram (Fig. 4B). The remaining 51% of the total variance is variation between reservoirs with the same ecological status. As in PRC based in phytoplankton communities, the PRC based in physic-chemical parameters shows fewer differences between reservoirs of status II and III when compared to the reference sites, and greater differences for reservoirs of status IV and V.

4.5.	Discussion
The 34 studied reservoirs were identified and delimit two types of dammed water bodies which were characterized by different hydromorphological features, water chemistry characteristics and by a specific species composition (see Cabecinha et al., 2008). Community structure changes with pollution or stress. In the WFD, High ecological status through biological parameters is defined as a slight or minor deviation from the reference community. To assess the importance of this deviation, and to measure the degradation of ecological status in the two types of reservoirs over time, a PRC methodology as used. The PRC analyses showed significant differences between the reference and impaired sites of each Type, reflecting the levels of disturbance that they experience over the study period.
For explaining the variance in species composition and environmental variables, time patterns clearly assumed major importance in Type 1 than in Type 2 reservoirs. This was somehow expected since, Type 1 contains “riverine reservoirs” resembling more a river than a lake with short hydraulic retention times, good mixing and relative high water velocities and Type 2, are “artificial lake reservoirs” where water storage and release cycles are long and operate on at least seasonal cycles but generally on multi-year cycles (Klaver et al., 2008).
In general, the most perturbed reservoirs of Type 1 presented larger watersheds, belonging to international basins like Douro and Tagus, dominated by agriculture and having significant urban areas. These reservoirs were positively associated with an anthropogenic pressure gradient (Fig. 3B) and associated with meso-eutraphentic to hypereutraphentic taxa (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004), namely Melosira ambigua, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Diatoma vulgaris, Navicula cryptocephala and Synedra ulna (Fig. 3A). These species are known to be tolerant or needing periodically of elevated concentrations of N, contrarily to Melosira distans (Van Dam et al., 1994).
The most perturbed reservoirs of Type 2 lay in densely populated, industrialized or agricultural areas, receiving high inputs of organic matter and industrial discharge. Therefore, these sites were positively correlated with water mineral content (Cl, hardness and conductivity), nutrients (P and N) and organic pollution gradients (Fig. 4B). In general, these disturbed sites were clearly dominated by tolerant taxa namely blue-green algae like Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena spp. These blue-green algae belong to a genera whose ability to produce toxins that can affect a variety of organisms, including humans is known to increase in eutrophic conditions (Vasconcelos, 2001; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000). These taxa appear associated with meso to hypereutrophic taxa like Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma vulgaris, Pediastrum duplex, Melosira ambigua and M. granulata (Fig. 4A) (Van Dam et al., 1994; Tavassi et al., 2004). Reference sites of Type 2 present in general large forested areas and were mainly dominated by intolerant taxa, Tabellaria fenestrata, T. floculosa and Chrysophytas like Dinobryon sp and D. bavaricum (Fig. 4A).
When reservoirs become more eutrophic, the diversity of phytoplankton assemblage decreases ultimately leading to the dominance of Cyanobacteria (see Fig. 4A). The PRC diagram allowed analysing over time the changes in the community structure. In general, the largest deviations from impaired sites to reference reservoirs of Type 2 are associated to seasonality (namely in summer periods) and bloom formations. Bloom formation (as observed in 1997, 2002 and 2003 - see Fig 4A) could result in surface scums, producing unpleasant taste and odours, being unsatisfactory food source for many organisms in the food-web, as well as production of toxins (Reynolds and Petersen, 2000).
Rarely will a single factor be responsible for mass appearance of cyanobacteria but a combination of several of them, including hydrodynamic effects, oxygen depletion in the water column and anoxic conditions at the sediment-water interface, elevated temperatures and low TN/TP-ratios (Dokulil and Teubner, 2000; Vasconcelos, 2001). This corroborates the results obtained in this study (see Fig. 4). Besides nutrients, the morphology of reservoirs is of decisive importance for cyanobacterial development. The dominance of colony forming species as Microcystis and Aphanizomenon is more commonly in deeper reservoirs (Dokulil and Teubner, 2000), as Type 2 reservoirs belonging to IV ecological status class.
For artificial water bodies, the reference conditions on which status classification is based are within the range of “Maximum Ecological Potential”, representing the maximum ecological quality that could be achieved for these systems (GIG, 2007). Therefore, only sites showing nearly undisturbed physico-chemical, hydromorphological and biological conditions were chosen as reference sites.
For Type 1 reservoirs, with only 10 sampling sites, it was difficult to find a large quantity of reference sites. Only 2 sites were selected as reference sites. Most “run-of river” reservoirs in Portugal lie in densely populated regions and therefore represent rather impacted sites. Additionally, all these reservoirs belong to International river basins, subject to great anthropogenic pressures, namely due to upstream intensive agriculture practiced in Spain, which were reflected by the meso-eutraphentic taxa that characterized this sites. This might be seen as an indication that the Type 1 reservoirs investigated here as “best available” ones do not represent proper reference sites. The PRC method, could be helpful in this “scenario”, hence enables researchers to contrast time series of impacted sites or treated sites with a time series of a reference site, but also has the advantage that an external particular starting position can be introduced as a reference, namely less impacted reservoirs or flushed lakes in other European countries.
Many different multivariate methods have been used to analyse biological time series of communities, with the ordination method PCA being most frequently used (e.g. Li and Kafatos 2000). Other methods, like non-metric multidimensional scaling and clustering, have also been proposed but have some disadvantages compared to the use of ordination, as discussed by Van den Brink and Ter Braak (1998), Pardal et al. (2004) and Van den Brink et al. (2008). The PRC analysis results in a diagram in which the time vector runs straight from left to right and differences are displayed on the y-axis. This mode of presentation is very powerful, especially for non-experts, since this is the same type of display we would use to disseminate univariate information (Van den Brink et al., 2008).
Often biomonitoring data sets do not only comprise of biological data but also of environmental data, like physico-chemical data, land-use data etc. Trends and relationships between the biological and environmental data set can displayed together in a triplot, showing samples, species as well as the environmental variables. One can imagine that, when interested in relationships between biology and environmental variables and their
changes in time, these triplots could get very complex and only showing a part of the variation of interest (Van den Brink et al., 2008). A possibility to obtain a clearer overview is to perform separate PRC analyses on the biological and environmental data sets, as shown in figures 3 and 4. In this way dynamics of the differences between the sites with respect to both the biological communities as the environmental factors are displayed in separate diagrams and their relationships over time can easily be inferred.
This ordination technique is capable of summarising very complex responses because it is not restricted to a single dimension (as for instance (dis)similarity analysis). When combined with Monte Carlo permutation testing not only is a graphical summary of the structure present in the data set obtained, but also the statistical significance of hypothesized differences (Ter Braak and smilauer 2002; Van den Brink et al., 2003).
Pardal et al. (2004) summarises how PRC analysis can be applied to several common environmental scenarios, independently of the number of sites analysed, namely in a common disturbance gradient to a recovery scenery of the environmental quality after management or mitigation measures that might lead to a better environmental quality or even the establishment of threshold values/levels necessary for qualitative evaluation of ecosystem health. Therefore, PRC analysis could be a powerful tool to reach and implementing WFD objectives since allowed to determined in time the ecological status of a site and compared the deviations with the reference. Therefore, to assess “Maximum Ecological Potential” for all reservoirs until 2015, as a requisite of WFD, several mitigation measures could be implemented and the monitoring results easily analysed, interpret and compared by PRC. This mitigation measures could pass through the reduction of the nutrient load from the catchment to the reservoir, alteration of the hydrodynamic conditions (e.g. artificial mixing or intermittent turbulence of the water column) or even application of inreservoirs ecotechnologies. The PRC diagrams also provide meaningful information on the species which contribute to these trends. Combining this with knowledge about the ecological requirements of these species will provide decision-makers with a diagnostic tool for the ecological functioning of their water systems, e.g. as required by the EU Water Framework Directive.
4.6.	Conclusions
In this study, PRC analysis was used effectively to explore a suitable way of monitoring and assess water quality of two types of Mediterranean reservoirs using phytoplankton communities. This method was used to analyse changes in species composition and environmental variables between sites with different ecological status over time, allowing to estimate the degree of impairment at a particular site by contrasting it with a reference site, was proposed by WFD.
The PRC analysis, for both reservoirs types, showed significant differences between the reference and impaired sites, reflecting the levels of disturbance that they experience over the study period, manly associated with a clear spatial gradient related to eutrophication.
This methodology proved to be capable of concisely summarising the complex data set of the phytoplankton community whilst permitting information to be displayed with visual clarity and easily to interpret to non-experts, namely decision makers, politicians and general public. In conclusion, we believe that PRC will provide a powerful tool for environmental quality assessment in the future and should be incorporated into monitoring and assessment programmes along with the existing range of univariate and multivariate tools presently used.

5.1.	Abstract
Worldwide aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by broad-scale environmental pressures such as agriculture, point and non-point-source pollution and land-use changes overlapping in space and time, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems. The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of phytoplankton communities and physicochemical conditions in reservoirs as a response to the changes in the respective watersheds soil use. The case of the Douro's basin (Portugal) was used to test the StDM performance in this multi-scale approach. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. The data used in the dynamic model construction included true gradients of environmental changes and was sampled from 1995 to 2004. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected ecological components. The model validation was based on independent data, for all the state variables considered. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the dynamics of the studied reservoirs. The StDM model simulations were validated for the most part of the twenty-two components selected as ecological indicators, with a performance of 50% for the physicochemical variables, 75% for the phytoplankton variables, and 100% for the Carlson trophic state indices (TSI). This approach provides a useful starting point, as a contribution for the practical implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, allowing the development of a true integrated assessment tool for water quality management, both at the scale of the reservoir body and at the scale of the respective river watershed dynamics.
5.2.	Introduction
The reservoirs, as the main worldwide aquatic ecosystems, have been impacted by broadscale point and non-point environmental pressures, resulting in the disposal of domestic and agricultural waste water, runoff of nutrients, organic and toxic compounds (Brazner et al, 2007; Danz et al., 2007). The land-use changes in the watershed, overlapping in space and time, may have considerable effects on the reservoirs. Particular negative effects are produced by changes in agricultural practices, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these man-made systems (Robarts, 1985; Reynolds 1992; Vasconcelos, 2001). In this context, any management option must take into account not only the components of the reservoir, but also the human activities within the respective watershed. Consequently, the management strategies for aquatic systems in general, and for reservoirs in particular, has an increasing need for tools capable to relate intrinsic variables with perceived external threats to the parameters of water quality that the national entities have been established to protect and/or improve. These growing need to analyse the present state of ecosystems and to monitor their rate of change, has triggered a demand for studies that explore species environment relationships and use these relationships to assess and predict changes under anthropogenic influence (Statzner et al., 2001; Simboura et al., 2005; Ekdahl et al., 2007).
Building on the long tradition of using organisms in monitoring and assessment programs, the European Commission issued a directive (European Water Framework Directive, WFD) mandating the use of different organism groups to monitor the integrity of inland waters and coastal regions. In this context, the use of adequate ecological indicators is particularly helpful in assessing the impact of environmental changes on characteristic ecological patterns (Barbour et al., 1999; Andreasen et al., 2001; Dziock et al., 2006). Therefore, key aquatic communities have been used, in some cases for decades, to evaluate water quality and ecological status of aquatic ecosystems, namely lakes and reservoirs. In this paper, the phytoplankton community and their physicochemical environment were used as ecological indicators, since they represent the base of lakes and reservoirs food webs and quickly respond to stresses and perturbations. In fact, these variables have been commonly chosen for aquatic bioassessment since they meet the following criteria (Hakanson and Peters, 1995; Moldan and Billharz, 1997; Heiskanen and Solimini, 2005): (1) are measurable, simply
and inexpensively, (2) clearly interpretable and predictable by validated quantitative models, (3) internationally applicable, (4) relevant for a given environmental threat, (5) representative for the given ecosystem, and (6) comprehensible to politicians and the general public.
The WFD prescribes that European countries restore the "good ecological status'' of water bodies of their aquatic systems. One way to cope with the complexity of this problematic for sound environmental management of reservoirs is to apply mathematical models of different kinds (Even et al., 2007). Therefore, ecological integrity studies have been improved by creating dynamic models that simultaneously attempt to capture the structure and the composition in systems affected by long-term environmental disturbances (J0rgensen, 1994; Costanza and Voinov, 2003; Chaloupka, 2002; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007; Silva-Santos et al., 2006; 2008). The application of ecological models can synthesize the pieces of ecological knowledge, emphasizing the need for a holistic view of a certain environmental problem (J0rgensen, 2001; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007; Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2008). Any environmental assessment must begin with a conceptual model that includes the natural geographic and habitat setting, human activity that can potentially stress the ecosystem (e.g. agriculture), stressors resulting from that human activity (e.g. increased nutrients) and the effects of those stressors on the ecosystem (Stevenson et al., 2004). Nowadays environmental assessment is pushed to assist with land use planning decisions and projections of 'what if' scenarios at the landscape scale and, consequently, it is necessary to capture the main cause-effect relationships between human activity and ecosystem responses (Bailey et al., 2007).
Since many of the ecosystem phenomenological aspects are holistic, whole-system properties, the main vocation of the Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) recently developed is a mechanistic understanding of the holistic ecological processes, based on a statistical parameter estimation method (Santos and Cabral, 2003; Cabecinha et al., 2004; Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2008). This recent research is based on the premise that the general statistical patterns of ecological phenomena are emergent indicia of complex ecological processes that do indeed reflect the operation of universal law-like mechanisms. The StDM
is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. This methodology was successfully tested in several types of ecological systems, such as mountain running waters (Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007), mediterranean agroecosystems (Santos and Cabral, 2003; Cabral et al., 2007), estuaries (Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2008), and for simulating the impact of socio-economic trends on threatened species (Santos et al., 2008).
The goal of the present work is to apply and extend the above principles to reservoir water quality management, and to demonstrate the potential of the StDM in the scope of the practical implementation of the WFD. Therefore, when applied as a multi-scale approach, the StDM model can be run for different levels simultaneously taking into account stochastic/random phenomena that characterize the real ecological processes. The main objectives of this paper include not only to validate but also to demonstrate the StDM performance in capturing how expected changes at land use level will alter the reservoir water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels. Since the progressive tendency to degradation of reservoirs takes place in most watersheds of Northeast Portugal (Moreira et al., 2002), the Douro river basin was used as an exemplificative scenario. The hypotheses to be tested were: (1) that the selected metrics are representative of the local phytoplankton community and physicochemical environment that changes in some predictable way with the increasing of human and natural influences, and (2) that the ecosystem integrity and respective ecological status can be assessed by the state variables, assumed as important ecological indicators, used in the StDM model construction.
5.3.	Materials and methods
5.3.1.	Study area
This study was carried out in 11 reservoirs from the Douro river catchment (North of Portugal): Miranda (MRD), Picote (PCT), Bemposta (BMP), Pocinho (PCN), Valeira (VAL), Vilar-Tabuaço (VLR), Régua (RG), Varosa (VRS), Carrapatelo (CRP), Torrão (TR) and Crestuma (CRT) (Fig. 1). The main purpose of all these reservoirs is hydroelectric power generation, although some secondary uses are also common, such as navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation.
The Douro River flows within the largest watershed in the Iberian Peninsula, draining 98,000 km2 (17% of this territory). The flow of this international watershed, shared between Spain (80%) and Portugal (20%) and heavily regulated by 51 large dams, represents about 15 km3 of freshwater per year discharged into the Atlantic Ocean. However, the flow regime depends not only on climatic conditions but also on hydroelectric power generation needs in both countries, as well as by irrigation needs, particularly in Spain. In Portugal, the first dam on the watershed was built in 1920, but the larger dams (with more than 15m of wall height) started operating only in the late 1950s. These dams are particularly concentrated in the last 350 km of the main river course. Altogether, large dams retain up to 1100 hm3 (13%) of water in Portuguese reservoirs and 7500 hm3 on the Spanish side of the watershed (Vieira and Bordalo, 2000).
In Portugal, rainfall has a high seasonal variation, occurring 70% of the total precipitation between October and May. In Douro catchment more than 1400 mm/year occurred in the mountainous northern areas and less than 500 mm/year in the semi-arid central part of this region. This extensive geographic area represents a wide range in physical and chemical characteristics, soil use and anthropogenic pressure, including both good and poor water quality conditions. Most of the population lives in coastal areas.

Figure 1 - Location of the study area in the Douro river basin with the different watersheds and respective reservoirs, used as data sources in the construction of the StDM model: Crestuma (CRT), Carrapatelo (CRP), Varosa (VRS), Régua (RG), Vilar-Tabuaço (VLR), Valeira (VAL), Pocinho (PCN), Bemposta (BMP), Picote (PCT) and Miranda (MRD). The data from the Torrão (TR) reservoir (dashed area) was separated for validation purposes.
Therefore, many impacts associated with urbanization are present there, namely water quality problems associated with nutrient enrichment and high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) due to industrial effluent discharges, urban development and intensive agriculture. For example, the Crestuma reservoir, located at 21.6 km from Douro's mouth, is the only suitable source for the production of potable water for approximately two million inhabitants of the Porto region, representing 20% of the Portuguese population.
In general, land use of the Douro basin is dominated by agricultural activities, although the high concentration of industries, mainly transformation industries and mines, is also important.
The majority of these dams are"run-of-river" reservoirs (see Table 1 for details), with very low water residence time and with the hydrological stability mostly conditioned by the short-term atmospheric conditions. The remaining dams (VLR, VRS and TR) are explored as true reservoirs, with relatively high water residence time and with variations along the year mostly related to the seasonality of the inputs of water. The main characteristics of the studied reservoirs are presented in Table 1.
5.3.2.	Environmental variables and chlorophyll a
The environmental and biological variables were measured by the national Laboratory of Environment and Applied Chemistry (LABLEC), from 1996 to 2004, four times per year, corresponding to spring, summer, autumn and winter. These variables were sampled according to the methodologies described by CEN/TC 230. All samples were collected at 100 m from the reservoirs's crest, at approximately 0.5 m depth. From all reservoirs, 58.8% were sampled annually, 26.5% biannually and 14.7% triennially (Table 1).
To determined soil use dynamics in Douro watershed, i.e., rates of soil use alterations, a geographic information system database was created (ESRI, ArcGIS 9.0), with 13 spatial variables (see Table 1). These use/land cover variables derived primarily from the Corine Land Cover from two distinct decades 1990 and 2000 (CLC, 1990 and 2000; IGEOE, 2006).

Additionally, the proportions of the predominant CLC classes in the basin (urban areas, intensive and extensive agriculture, natural and semi-natural areas and burned areas) were calculated.
The trophic classification of reservoirs was obtained from the OCDE model (Vollenweider and Kerekes, 1982), based on Total Phosphorus, Shecchi Depth and Mean Chlorophyll a concentration (see Table 1).
5.3.3.	Biological variables
The phytoplankton samples were collected from 1996 to 2004, with the periodicity described for the environmental parameters, using a Van Dorn bottle net, at a depth of approximately 0.5 m. Phytoplankton community composition was studied through inverted microscopy, following Utermohl's method (Lund et al., 1958). For the quantification and identification of phytoplankton, samples were fixed in Lugol's solution (1%, v/v) and, when possible, identified to the species level. The abundance of each taxon was estimated using a 5-score scale criteria (0-absent to 4-bloom).
5.3.4.	Statistical analysis and modelling procedures
The soil use dataset, the base of the dynamic sub-model of our StDM application (level 1), incorporates real gradients relying on land cover alterations through one decade, from 1990s to 2000s, in the Douro river watershed.
A stepwise multiple-regression analysis (Zar, 1996) was used to test relationships between the soil use dynamics within the watershed (level 1) and the physicochemical variables of the reservoir (level 2) and between these aquatic environmental variables and the phytoplankton metrics (level 3). In level 2, the dependent variables, selected as representative of the physicochemical status of water column reservoir, were: total coliforms, PO4, Cl, NH4, BOD5, pH, SiO2, DO, NO3, hardness, turbidity and SO4. For this level, the independent variables considered were the 13 soil use variables and the 5 stochastic environmental variables, namely surface water temperature, precipitation, volume, level and water residence time (see Table 1 for details).
In level 3, the dependent variables, selected as representative of the local phytoplankton, were: Cyanophyta (Blue-green algae), Clorophyta (Green algae), Bacillariophyta (diatoms)
and Chlorophyll a. The independent variables considered for the phytoplankton metrics were the 17 environmental variables referred above for level 2 and for the stochastic environmental variables.
From a bottom up perspective, each living component interacts with other living components and non-living features of their shared habitat. A step down procedure was used to test the effect of each variable in the presence of all other pertinent variables, with the least significant variable being removed at every step. The analysis stopped when all the remaining variables had a significant level P&amp;lt;0.05 (Zar, 1996). The multi-level approach gives realism to the interactions considered by incorporating into the model a typical “cascade effect” observed in these processes (Brazner et al., 2007; Bailey et al., 2007). Therefore, in order to simplify the model structure, only the main key-components were introduced as representative ecological indicators, but which obviously could be complemented by other relevant state variables or other dynamic variables in further applications. The specifications of all variables considered are indicated in Table 1. Although the lack of normality distribution of the dependent variables was not solved by any transformation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), the linearity and the homoscedasticity of the residuals were achieved by using logarithmic transformations (X' = log[X + 1]) in each side of the equation, i.e., on both the dependent and independent variables (Zar, 1996; Podani, 2000). The lack of substantial intercorrelation among independent variables was confirmed by the inspection of the respective tolerance values. All the statistical analysis was carried out using the software SYSTAT 8.0 .
Since this statistical procedure was based on a very complete database, covering true gradients of environmental and biological characteristics of the reservoirs in the Douro basin (Fig. 1), over space and time, the significant partial regression coefficients were assumed as relevant holistic ecological parameters in the dynamic model construction. This is the heart of the philosophy of the StDM. In a holistic perspective, the partial regression coefficients represent the global influence of the environmental variables selected, which are of significant importance on several complex ecological processes. To develop the dynamic model the software STELLA 8.1.4® was used.
Water quality indices and trophic level classification system are useful tools for enhancing communications between scientists, water managers, policymakers and/or the general
CHAPTER 5
Modelling multi-scale approach: StDM validation public. Therefore, some of the ecological indicators selected were described using Carlson's Trophic Status Index (TSI). The status for Secchi depth (SD), chlorophyll a (Clp a) and total phosphorus (TP) were described using the following equations (Carlson, 1977):
TSI(SD)=60-14.41*ln SD (meters);
TSI(Clp_a)= 9.81* ln Clp_a (ug/L)+30.6;
TSI(TP)= 14.42* ln TP (ug/L) + 4.15.
Other indices have been constructed to be used as a complement of these basic three. Since nitrogen limitation still classifies a lake along Naumann's nutrient axis, the effect of nitrogen limitation can be estimated by having a companion index to the TSI(TP). Therefore, the TSI(TN) was introduced in the model and calculated using the following formula (Kratzer et al, 1982):
TSI(TN) = 54.45+14.43* ln TN (mg/L).
A major strength of TSI is that the interrelationships between variables can be used to identify certain conditions in the lake or reservoir that are related to the factors that limit algal biomass or affect the measured variables. The concept of trophic status is based on the fact that changes in nutrient levels (measured by TP and NT) causes changes in algal biomass (estimated by Clp_a measures) which in turn causes changes in lake clarity (measured by SD). TSI values greater than 50 are associated with eutrophy (high productivity). The range between 40 and 50 is usually associated with mesotrophy (moderate productivity) and values less than 40 are associated with oligotrophy (low productivity) (Carlson, 1981, 1983). Since some of these trophic variables do not survive when the initial stepwise multiregression analysis was carried out, namely TP and SD, significant relationships were found between them and other environmental variables from the StDM model. Therefore, simple linear regression models were introduced in the model in way to estimate the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) from total nitrogen concentration (TN, as a sum of NO3 and NH4) (y = 0.018x + 0.023; R2 = 0.348; N = 25) and Secchi disk transparency (SD) from turbidity (y = 0.775x + 3.83; R2 = 0.732; N = 25).
For validation purposes, a set of biological and environmental data (including land cover) from the Torrão reservoir, that are independent of the data used to structure the StDM model and estimate its parameters, were used to confront the simulated values of a given
state variable with the real values of the same component. A regression analysis (MODEL II) was performed to compare the observed real values of the selected variables with the expected values obtained by model simulations for the same periods. At the end of each analysis, the 95% confidence limits for the intercept and the slope of the regression line were determined which, together with the results of the respective analysis of variance (ANOVA), allowed to assess the proximity of the simulations produced with the observed values (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). When the results of the regression analysis were statistically significant, i.e., when the intercept of the regression line was not statistically different from 0 and the slope was not statistically different from 1, the model simulations were considered validated (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995; Oberdorff et al., 2001).
The model is prepared to work with table functions for validation purposes (Validation Mode) and to produce stochastic simulations based on the monthly stochastic variability of some environmental variables (Random Mode). Simulations based on stochastic principles take into consideration the random behaviour of some environmental variables with influence on the studied ecological phenomena. The limit values of environmental variables were determined, from the period between December 1995 and December 2004, to discriminate the maximum and minimum values of each stochastic environmental variable, included in the model as a RANDOM function (Annex 1, Other functions). The selection of the model working mode is done by switching the toggle option between 0 and 1 for validation or stochastic calculations, respectively.
5.4.	Results and Discussion
5.4.1.	Multi-level interactions
In the StDM, a stepwise multiple-regression analysis was used to search for significant correlations between the different levels of variables used in the model construction. In level 2, the physicochemical variables were influenced by several types of soil use and stochastic environmental variables, such as the cumulative precipitation (CPREC) and water temperature.
The upper level (level 3), represented by the number species of Cyanophyta (CN), Clorophyta (CPL), Bacillariophyta (DTM) and Chlorophyll a (Clp_a) concentration was influenced by the preceding levels, particularly by environmental variables, including the stochastic ones (Table 2). Several studies, all over the world, have demonstrated that these environmental variables played an important role in structuring phytoplankton assemblages, namely nutrient concentrations, water mineral content, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and silicon (EPA, 1998; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000; Wetzel, 2001; Figueiredo et al., 2006; McIntire et al., 2007). The influence of nitrogen (NH4 and NO3) concentration either negative on species richness of CN and CPL or positive on species richness of DTM corroborates other studies in worldwide reservoirs that have come to similar results (e.g., Figueiredo et al., 2006; McIntire et al., 2007). Moreover, the inorganic nitrogen hypothesis suggests that the forms and amounts of inorganic nitrogen favor different algal groups. Non-N-fixing Cyanobacteria are favored by ammonium-nitrogen, while eukaryotic phytoplankton develops when nitrate-nitrogen is the main N-component present (Dokulil and Teubner, 2000; Figueiredo et al., 2006). Scarcity of nitrogen induces nitrogen-fixation and hence favors the development of species capable to fix molecular nitrogen (Blomquist et al., 1994; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000). This could explain the apparent contradictory results obtained for the influences of NH4 in dry or wet years for this algal group (Table 2). Some authors have demonstrated that diatoms were positively correlated with trophic gradients, high TN/TP-ratios, water mineral content and hardness (Negro and Hoyos, 2005). All these hypotheses largely corroborate the obtained results, as shown in Table 2.

5.4.2.	Conceptualization of the model and equations
The conceptual diagram of the model shown in Fig. 2 is based on the perceived dynamic relationships between different soil uses present in the Douro watershed (level 1), expressed by the trends of the land cover recorded through a decade, from 1990 to 2000. In this level, the model included eleven state variables related to land cover: Artificial Territories (ART TERT), Unproductive areas (UNP), Grasslands (GRS), Heterogeneity agricultural areas (HTAG), Irrigated crops (ICROPS), Non-irrigated crops (NICROPS), Olive grove (OLV), Vineyard (VIN), Forest (FRT), Burned areas (BRN) and Shrubs (SRB). Difference equations describing the processes affecting these state variables are expressed in area units (hectares) (Annex 1, State variable equations).As initial values of all state variables, indicated in Annex 1 (Process equations), were considered data recorded in Torrao's Watershed between December 1995 and December 2004.
The increase rates used for artificial territory, olive grove, vineyard and shrubby vegetation were calculated according to the ratio ((soil use area in 2000- soil use area in 1990)/soil use area in 1990)) (Chaves et al., 2000). Since the time unit chosen was the month, because it captures in an acceptable way the behaviour of the variables at the lower scales of our proposed approach (levels 2 and 3), the increase rates (Total increase rate ART TERT, Total increase rate OLV, Total increase rate VIN, Total increase rate BRN to SRB and Total increase rate SRB to FRT) were converted to monthly periods (increase rate ART TERT month, increase rate OLV month, increase rate VIN, increase rate BRN to SRB month and increase rate SRB to FRT month) by using the appropriated rate conversions described in Annex 1 (Composed variables). The simulation period for a decade was expressed in months, i.e., 120 months (see Annex 1, constants).
In each time unit, the available area for each type of expansible soil use (Total available area ART TERT, Total available area DCROPS_SRB, Total available area OLV_VIN) (Annex 1, Composed variables) was calculated by the sum of all the pertinent soil use areas which were expected to be occupied by these activities (N Total affected areas; see Annex 1, Composed variables).

Figure 2 - Conceptual diagram of the sub-model used to predict the soil use dynamics, representing the level 1 in the global StDM model, the base for assessing the ecological status of the reservoirs in the Douro watershed. The specification of all variable codes is expressed in Table 1.
Although this version of the model is now prepared to simulate new scenarios, such as the effect of one or two fires and/or the consequences of a reforestation action in reservoir's water quality, it is not the goal of the present paper to extend the line of post-validation applications, as the subsequent article in preparation by our team follow this goal.
The conceptual diagrams presented in Fig. 3 and 4 reflect the relationships detected in multiple-regression analysis (Table 2) and on existing relevant regional data sets. Therefore, the StDM model includes globally the following 27 state variables: eleven related to the soil use dynamics (level 1), twelve related to physicochemical variables (level 2) and four related to biological metrics (level 3) (Figs. 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Since difference equations that described the processes affecting the state variables from the levels 2 and 3 were expressed in logarithms, the initial values of these state variables were expressed in logarithms of the original units (Annex 1, State variable equations and Process equations). Later, for validation purposes, the initial value (December 1995) was discarded, since only in t1 (first point of the simulation) it was possible to take into account the influences of the environmental variables, whose seasonal fluctuations were introduced into the model as table functions (Annex 1, Table functions). The selected biological metrics largely depend on weather conditions, namely on precipitation and related variables like water residence time (Reynolds, 1984; Basu and Pick, 1996; EPA, 1998; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000). Therefore, two different complementary equations were calculated for each state variable of phyroplankton groups considered, depending on the monthly precipitation. The categorization in dry or wet months was determined by comparing monthly cumulative precipitations with the reference historical values of monthly precipitation obtained from the period between 1961 and 1990 (Portuguese Weather Institute, 2007). Consequently, the simulation performance of a given state variable results from the calculations of two alternative equations automatically selected in response to the monthly precipitation influence (Fig. 4, Table 2 and Annex 1, State variable equations).
Level 2 - Environmental variables
Figure 3 - Conceptual diagram of the sub-model used to predict the responses of the water column environmental variables to changes due to soil use
dynamics, representing the level 2 in the StDM model for the Douro watershed reservoirs. The specification of all variable codes is expressed in Table 1.
The inflows affecting the state variables, in levels 2 and 3, were based on the positive constants and all positive partial coefficients of each variable resulting from the previous multiple-regression analysis (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 2 and Annex 1, State variable and Process equations). Chlorophyll a and the number of species of Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta were affected by two inflows corresponding to the conditions of dry or wet months (Clp_a gains Dry, Clp_a gains Wet, CLP gains Dry, CLP gains Wet, CN gains Dry, CN gains Wet, DTM gains Dry and DTM gains Wet). Using the same criteria, each one of these state variables was affected by two outflows related to the negative constants and partial regression coefficients (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2 and Annex 1, State variable and Process equations) (Clp_a losses Dry, Clp_a losses Wet, CLP losses Dry, CLP losses Wet, CN losses Dry, CN losses Wet, DTM losses Dry, DTM losses Wet). To complement the information about the ecological status of reservoir's water quality, the trophic state indices (TSI) based on chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and Secchi disk depth outputs were introduced into the model (Fig. 3 and 4, Annex 1, Composed variables). Although the StDM simulations for each physicochemical or biological metric were composed of a given value per time unit, the respective state variable might had a cumulative behaviour over time in response to environmental condition changes. Therefore, to prevent this from happening, sixteen outflow adjustments were incorporated in the model (Level 2: BDO adjust, Cl adjust, Hard adjust, NH4 adjust, NO3 adjust, DO adjust, pH adjust, PO4 adjust, SiO2 adjust, SO4 adjust, TotColf adjust, Turb adjust; Level 3: Clp_a adjust, CLP adjust, CN adjust, and DTM adjust) aiming to empty the state variables at each time step, by a “flushing cistern mechanism”, before beginning the next step with new environmental influences (Fig. 2 and 3, Annex 1, State variable and Process equations). For process compatibilities and a more realistic comprehension of the model simulations, some conversions were introduced, denominated associated variables (Fig. 2, 3 and 4 and Annex 1, Associated variables). Regarding biological and physicochemical variables, these conversions were obtained through an inverse transformation (anti-logarithmic), which transforms logarithms into the original measurement units (Level 2: BDO, Cl, Hard, NH4, NO3, DO, pH, PO4, SiO2, SO4, TotColf, Turb; Level 3: Clp_a, CLP, CN, and DTM).

The output of the level 1 (soil uses) were logarithm transformed for a compatible integration in the balances of the state variables from the levels 2 and 3 (Fig. 2 and 3, Annex 1, Associated variables). This transformation was incorporated because the data required for the state variables balances in levels 2 and 3 should have the same units used to obtain the partial regression coefficients, assumed as holistic ecological parameters (see Methods).Therefore, only logarithms of the soil uses are acceptable in the inflows and outflows of these state variables (Fig. 2 and 3, Table 2 and Annex 1, State variable and Process equations).

For illustration purposes, the diagrams for the volume of the reservoir (VOL) and cumulative precipitation (CPREC) are shown as respective examples.
Thus, the StDM model is prepared for receiving and transforming real data from the variables in level 1 and to convert logarithmic outputs from state variables simulations into original units in levels 2 and 3. Some environmental values, were assumed as static in each reservoir, without any variation during the simulated period, and, therefore, were introduced as environmental constants (Annex 1, Constants). The stochastic behaviour of some environmental variables were determined by RANDOM functions, with a monthly variation, taking into account the standard deviations limits for each environmental variable considered (Fig. 5 and Annex 1, Other functions).
5.4.3 Model simulations
Simulations were performed from December 1995 to December 2004. Since the values of the first month for each period were used as initial values (t0), the simulations started effectively in January 1996. The Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the confrontation between simulated and real values for main relevant physicochemical and biological variables under consideration. The model predicted with success fourteen of the twenty-two simulations performed. In fact, the behaviour of some variables namely: physicochemical variables (Cl, DO, Hard, pH, PT, SD and Turb), biological variables (CLP, CN and DTM) and trophic state indices (TSI Clp_a, TSI NT, TSI PT and TSI SD) (Figs. 6 and 7, respectively) were statistically validated by the MODEL II regression analysis (Table 3). Despite the non-significant results for the remaining simulations, it was easily recognized a logic behavioural pattern for NO3 and Clp_a (Fig. 6 and 7, respectively; Table 3) consistent with the observed parameters at the Torrao's reservoir for the same real conditions. Moreover, some of the non-validated variables, namely Clp_a, PO4, NH4 and NO3 (Table 3), when expressed in the respective four metrics based on Carlson's Trophic Status Index (TSI) criteria, were able to capture, with a notable performance, the expected behaviour of these transformed metrics (Table 3 and Fig. 7).
A relative stable seasonal pattern of phytoplankton succession and biomass variations were observed for all the biological variables analysed (Fig. 6 and 7). These patterns were consistent with the behaviour of these groups facing similar contexts of other temperate lakes and reservoirs (Reynolds, 1984; Mischke, 2003; Figueiredo et al., 2006).

These seasonal successions are strongly conditionated by meteorological and stratificationmixing processes (Wetzel, 2001). Therefore, the variation in the abundance of the total phytoplankton, represented by the chlorophyll a content simulations, shown a credible seasonal pattern with an earlier maximum occurring through spring and early summer to a maximum in July. This "monomitic" pattern is probably typical of many "mesotrophic" shallow (&lt;30m) temperate lakes and reservoirs (Reynolds, 1984; Wetzel, 2001; Mischke, 2003). It is supposed that the peaks reflect the coincidence of physically suitable growth conditions, with relatively high concentrations of limiting nutrients shortages of which prevent the attainment of large biomasses during the midsummer period (Reynolds, 1984; Domingues and Galvao, 2007).

for the physicochemical variables, the level 2 of the StDM model. The specification of the variable
codes is expressed in Table 1.
Seasonal succession pattern of phytoplankton in temperate reservoirs, similar to Torrão, usually involves a winter minimum with species adapted to low light and temperature, a late winter-spring and autumn peaks of diatom richness, followed rapidly by the development of green algae in the spring and finally the transition in late summer and early autumn to a peak of Cyanobacteria (Reynolds, 1984; Wetzel, 2001; Figueiredo et al., 2006). As shown in fig. 6 and 7, the model simulations were able to capture the expected pattern of these variables in this type of reservoirs.
Overall, the performance of the present simulation results shows some realism in capturing the behavioural patterns of the studied state variables, in general with higher statistical significance between simulated and observed values. Therefore, the state variables reflect well the shift of the environmental characteristics towards known conditions and are capable of responding with credibility to the dynamics of the underlying ecological “cascade” processes, implicit in a multi-scale perspective (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). These results showed that the ecological indicators selected, as state variables, were not indifferent to changes in the ecological conditions, namely when conditions relatively unaffected by human activities were changed by man-induced disturbances. The relevant ecological drifts simulated are in agreement with real observations and other studies that investigated the biological consequences of environmental changes induced by particular anthropogenic impacts in these ecosystems. Ecological modelling started with Lotka -Volterra and Streeter-Phelps in the 1920s, while the comprehensive use of models in environmental management started in the beginning of the 1970s. Meanwhile many models have been developed and today there are hundreds of ecological models which have been used as tool in research or environmental management (see Jprgensen, 1995, 1999, 2005). Nowadays, in monitoring and management programs, the construction of predictive tools for ecological management, namely in terms of cost and speed of reliable assessment results, is crucial. In this scope, the methodology proposed is expeditious and easily applicable to new scenario affected by gradients of changes.
Trophic state
Figure 7 - Graphical comparisons between simulations (dotted line) and observed values (solid line) for the biological variables and for the trophic status indices analysed, the level 3 of the StDM model. The specification of the variable codes is expressed in Table 1.
In a preliminary deterministic approach, the StDM was developed to validate simulations of the interactions between some relevant biological metrics (benthic macroinvertebrates) and physicochemical conditions in selected static scenarios (Cabecinha et al., 2004, Silva-Santos et al., 2006). Although these simulations are encouraging, we believe that our present proposal will provide the development of a true management tool, namely taking into account stochastic/random phenomena that characterize the real ecological processes (Van der Meer et al., 1996). Therefore, the main improvements are the stochastic background and the multi-level connections that gives realism to the interactions considered by incorporating into the model a typical “cascade effect” observed in the dynamic of the studied ecosystems. With regard to stochastic influences, they allowed to discriminate the maximum and minimum values of each stochastic environmental variable (as suggested by Dzeroski et al, 2000) and the seasonal random variation of the monthly accumulated precipitation over time. On the other hand, since the reservoirs are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in space and time, influenced by many interacting factors and by feedback mechanisms, this StDM multi-scale approach is particularly helpful to capture these multi-factor influences in natural stochastic scenarios.
When compared to other modelling methodologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (Dzeroski et al., 1997; Kuo et al., 2006), the StDM is more intuitive, namely in mathematical terms, providing easy explanations for the underlying relations between independent and dependent variables and because is based on conventional linear methods that allowed a more direct development of testable hypotheses. Dzeroski et al. (1997) referred that models produced in the form of rules, based on machine learning approaches, are transparent and can be easily understood by experts. The StDM exhibits these structural qualities but provides also simple, suitable and intuitive outputs, easily interpreted by non-experts (ranging from resource users to senior policy makers). Our StDM model captures the stochastic complexity of some holistic ecological trends, including true temporal and spatial gradients of stochastic environmental characteristics, which allowed the simulation of structural changes when habitat and environmental conditions are substantially changing due to anthropogenic-induced alterations.
Therefore, this study seems to represent a useful contribution for the holistic implementation of the WFD, namely for integrated assessments of the reservoirs ecological status within the environmental gradients or “data space” monitored.
5.5.	Conclusions
The potential of StDM includes, at a multi-scale perspective, the interaction between ecological key-components and environmental conditions, with holistic and ecological relevance, from which management strategies can be designed to restore reservoir's biological communities that have been damaged by anthropogenic pressures, such as the eutrophication phenomena. The StDM model presented (PT103753 (pat. pend); Cabecinha et al., 2007a) could be integrated, as an exploratory tool, in the Douro's watershed management program, allowing the precise simulation of more complicated scenarios, with introduction of new mitigation measures, interactions and interferences with precise applicability conditions.
The ultimate goal is to produce simulation models that permit the creation of multi-scale patterns from changes in watersheds, whose patterns are the basis of spatially explicit ecological models (Costanza and Voinov, 2003). Therefore, we believe that StDM will provide the development of more global techniques in the scope of this research area by creating expeditious interfaces with Geographic Information Systems, which will make the methodology more instructive and intuitive to decision-makers and environmental managers.

6.1.	Abstract
With growing levels of urbanization and agriculture throughout the world, it is increasingly important that both research and management efforts take into account the effects of this widespread landscape alteration and its consequences for natural systems. Freshwater ecosystems, namely reservoirs, are particularly sensitive to land use changes. In this context, modelling can be very useful, for decision support, as an investigative tool to forecast the outcome of various scenarios, to guide current management in order to meet future targets and to develop integrated frameworks for management accordingly to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic-Dynamic Methodology (StDM), coupled with a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in capturing how expected changes at land use level will alter the reservoir water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels. The methodology was applied to the Portuguese area of the Douro's basin and illustrated with a series of stochastic-dynamic and spatial outputs taking into account expected scenarios regarding land use changes. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the tool reliability in capturing the stochastic environmental dynamics of the selected metrics facing spatial explicit scenarios. The ultimate goal is to couple monitoring assessment and the described modelling techniques to ease management and decision making regarding the requirements of the WFD.
6.2.	Introduction
The EC Directive 2000/60/EC established a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, commonly known as the Water Framework Directive (WFD), aims to prevent further deterioration and to protect and enhance the status of aquatic ecosystems throughout the European Member States till 2015. In densely populated countries with a myriad of competing uses including housing, transport, agriculture and industrial development, the environmental assessment is pushed to assist with land use planning decisions and projections of 'what if' scenarios at the landscape scale and, consequently, it is necessary to capture the main cause-effect relationships between human activity and ecosystem responses (Bailey et al., 2007). The reservoirs, as other freshwater ecosystems,
are mainly sensitive to the effects of large-scale land transformation, namely as a result of urbanization and agriculture intensification, since they receive water and materials from the respective watersheds (Alberti et al., 2007). In this context, any management option must take into account not only the components of the reservoir, but also the human activities within the respective watershed.
Ecological modelling started with Lotka -Volterra and Streeter-Phelps in the 1920s, while the comprehensive use of models in environmental management started in the beginning of the 1970s. Meanwhile many models have been developed and today there are hundreds of ecological models which have been used as tool in research or environmental management (see J0rgensen, 1995, 1999, 2005). For decision support, modelling can be very useful as an investigative tool to forecast the outcome of various scenarios, to guide current management in order to meet future targets and to develop integrated frameworks for management (Malafant and Fordham, 1998; Schauser et al., 2003). Ecological integrity assessment have been improved by creating dynamic models that simultaneously attempt to capture the structure and the composition in systems affected by long-term environmental disturbances (J0rgensen, 1994; Costanza and Voinov, 2003; Chaloupka, 2002; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007, 2008a; Silva-Santos et al., 2006; 2007). The application of ecological models can synthesize the pieces of ecological knowledge, emphasizing the need for a holistic view of a certain environmental problem (J0rgensen, 2001; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007, 2008a; Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2007).
In this context, a new Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) has been developed as a mechanistic understanding of the holistic ecological processes, by using appropriate statistical and dynamic modelling techniques (Santos and Cabral, 2004; Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007, 2008a; Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2007). This recent research is based on the premise that the general statistical patterns of ecological phenomena are emergent indicia of complex ecological processes that do indeed reflect the operation of universal law-like mechanisms. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. This methodology was successfully tested in several types of ecological systems, such as mountain running waters (Cabecinha et al., 2004, 2007), reservoirs (Cabecinha et al., 2008a), Mediterranean agroecosystems (Santos and Cabral, 2004; Cabral et al., 2007),
estuaries (Silva-Santos et al., 2006, 2007), and for simulating the impact of socio-economic trends on threatened species (Santos et al., 2007).
After the validation procedures carried out in the previous chapter (Cabecinha et al., 2008a), the present paper examined the applicability of StDM model in capturing how expected changes at land use level will alter water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels, in Portuguese reservoirs. Although the model system needs to be dynamic in order to construct a range of different scenarios, to ensure that the results are of use by planners and police makers, they need to be presented also in a spatial format. In this scope, the dynamic model used to produce scenarios for StDM simulations was also coupled with a Cellular Automata (CA) model. CA models can be represented by a set of simple production rules while its outcome may mimic a very complex system (Firebaugh, 1988). Therefore they have been increasingly used to simulate urban sprawl and land use dynamics (Yang et al, 2008). Since Land use change is driven by the interaction in space and time between biophysical and human dimensions, the use of GIS (Geographic Information System) databases can be combined to address complex spatial problems in a transparent and useful way to meet the requirements of legislation, such as the WFD to manage catchments from the field to landscape scale.
The goal of the present work is to demonstrate the potential of these two complementary techniques, the StDM and the CA, in the scope of the practical implementation of the WFD. Therefore, when applied as a multi-scale approach for realistic scenarios, the StDM model can be run at different levels simultaneously taking into account stochastic/random phenomena that characterize the real ecological processes (Cabecinha et al., 2008a). Moreover, this paper discusses the application of an interactive GIS tool to discern the patterns of such scenarios in a visual rather than a mathematical format. The Douro river basin was used as an exemplificative case study, with a focus in Northeast Portugal. In this context, the reservoir dynamics responsive to changes in catchment inputs of nutrients due to land use changes was tested in distinct expected scenarios, based in the Catchment Plan of the Douro river (INAG, 2008), namely regarding the evaluation of the reduction of pollutants achieved through management measures. The overall goal is to couple monitoring assessment and modelling approaches to ease the management and decision making regarding the requirements of the WFD.
6.3.	Materials and Methods
6.3.1.	Study area
This study was carried out in 11 reservoirs from the Douro river catchment (North of Portugal): Miranda (MRD), Picote (PCT), Bemposta (BMP), Pocinho (PCN), Valeira (VAL), Vilar-Tabuaço (VLR), Régua (RG), Varosa (VRS), Carrapatelo (CRP), Torrão (TR) and Crestuma (CRT) (Fig. 1). The main purpose of all these reservoirs is hydroelectric power generation, although some secondary uses are also common, such as navigation, irrigation, water supply and recreation (Cabecinha et al., 2008b).
The Douro River flows within the largest watershed in the Iberian Peninsula. The flow regime depends not only on climatic conditions but also on hydroelectric power generation needs in Spain and Portugal, as well as by irrigation needs, particularly in Spain. This extensive geographic area represents a wide range in physical and chemical characteristics, soil use and anthropogenic pressure, including both good and poor water quality conditions. Most of the population lives in coastal areas. Therefore, many impacts associated with urbanization are present there, namely water quality problems associated with nutrient enrichment and high biochemical oxygen demand due to industrial effluent discharges, urban development and intensive agriculture. In general, land use of the Douro basin is dominated by agricultural activities, although the high concentration of industries, mainly transformation industries and mines, is also important (Cabecinha et al., 2008b).
Figure 1 - Location of the study area in the Douro river basin with the different watersheds and respective reservoirs, used as data sources in the construction of the StDM model: Crestuma (CRT), Carrapatelo (CRP), Varosa (VRS), Régua (RG), Vilar-Tabuaço (VLR), Valeira (VAL), Pocinho (PCN), Bemposta (BMP), Picote (PCT) and Miranda (MRD). The data from the Torrão (TR) reservoir (dashed area) was used for scenarios simulation purposes.
The majority of the study dams are "run-of-river" reservoirs (see Table 1 for details), that more resembles a river than a lake with good mixing and relative high water velocities. The hydraulic retention times in the riverine reservoirs (BMP, CRP, CRT, MRD, PCN, PCT, RG and VAL) are short, with a hydrological stability mostly conditioned by the short-term atmospheric conditions. The remaining dams (VLR, VRS and TR) are explored “artificial lake reservoir", where water storage and release cycles are long and operate on at least seasonal cycles but generally on multi-year cycles. Besides the removal of suspended sediments and nutrients, these types of reservoirs have major impacts on the discharge and thermal regimes downstream of the dams (Klaver et al., 2007). The main characteristics of the studied reservoirs are presented in Table 1.
6.3.2.	Environmental variables and chlorophyll a
From 1996 to 2004, the environmental and biological parameters were measured by the Laboratory of Environment and Applied Chemistry (LABELEC) four times per sampling year, corresponding to spring (April/May), summer (July/August), autumn (October/November) and winter (January/February). The sampling periodicity is indicated in Table 1. All samples were collected at 100 m from the reservoirs' crest, at two different depths: a) near the surface (approximately 0.5 m depth); and b) near the bottom (2 m above bottom, only for environmental parameters).
Water temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen were determined in situ using a YSI handheld multiparameter probe (Yellow Spring Instruments). The other environmental variables were determined according to methodologies described by APHA (1995).
To determined soil use dynamics in Douro watershed, i.e. rates of soil use alterations, a geographic information system database was created (ESRI, ArcGIS 9.0), with 13 spatial variables (see Table 1). These use/land cover variables derived primarily from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) from two distinct decades 1990 and 2000 (IGEOE, 2006), additionally the proportions of the predominant CLC classes in the basin (urban areas, intensive and extensive agriculture, natural and semi-natural areas and burned areas) were calculated.

6.3.3.	Biological variables
Like the environmental parameters, phytoplankton samples were collected from 1996 to 2004 at a depth of approximately 0.5 m using a Van Dorn bottle net. Phytoplankton community composition was studied through inverted microscopy, following Utermohl's method (Lund et al., 1958). For the quantification and identification of phytoplankton, samples were fixed in Lugol's solution (1%, v/v) and, when possible, identified to the species level.
6.3.4.	Statistical analysis and modelling procedures - StDM
The Stochastic-Dynamic Methodology (StDM) proposed is a sequential modelling process initiated by a multiple regression conventional procedure. However, the fact that the data we considered consisted of n independent variables does not automatically imply that all variables have a significant effect on the magnitude of the dependent variable. Therefore, a stepwise multiple regression analysis (Zar, 1996) was used to test relationships between the soil use dynamics within the watershed (level 1) and the physicochemical variables of the reservoir (level 2) and between these aquatic environmental variables and the phytoplankton metrics (level 3). The developed StDM model includes globally 27 state variables: eleven related to the soil use dynamics (level 1), twelve related to physicochemical variables (level 2) and four related to biological metrics (level 3) (Fig. 2). The conceptual diagram reflects the relationships detected in the multiple regression analysis and on existing relevant regional data sets (Fig. 2, see Cabecinha et al., 2008a, for details). The soil use dataset, the base of the dynamic sub-model of our StDM application (level 1), incorporates real gradients relying on land cover alterations through a decade, from 1990's to 2000's, in the Douro river watershed. This model conceptualisation and validation are fully described in Cabecinha et al. (2008a). In level 3, the dependent variables, selected as representative of the phytoplankton communities, were the number of species of Cyanophyta (blue-green algae), Clorophyta (green algae), Bacillariophyta (diatoms) and Chlorophyll a concentration (Fig. 2). This upper level was influenced by the preceding levels, particularly by environmental variables, including the stochastic ones (Fig. 2).
The selected biological metrics largely depend on weather conditions, namely on precipitation and related variables like water residence time (Reynolds, 1984; Basu and Pick,
1996; EPA, 1998; Dokulil and Teubner, 2000). Therefore, two different complementary equations were calculated for each state variable of phyroplankton groups considered, depending on the monthly precipitation. The categorization in dry or wet months was determined by comparing monthly cumulative precipitations with the reference historical values of monthly precipitation obtained from the period between 1961 and 1990 (Portuguese Weather Institute, 2007). Consequently, the simulation performance of a given state variable results from the calculations of two alternative equations automatically selected in response to the monthly precipitation influence (Cabecinha et al., 2008a).
This multi-level approach gives realism to the interactions considered by incorporating into the model a typical “cascade effect” observed in these holistic processes (Brazner et al., 2007; Bailey et al., 2007). Therefore, in order to simplify the model structure, only the main key-components were introduced as representative ecological indicators, but which obviously could be complemented by other relevant state variables or other dynamic variables in further applications. Since the statistical procedure was based on a very complete database, covering true gradients of environmental and biological characteristics of the reservoirs in the Douro basin (Fig. 1), over space and time, the significant partial regression coefficients were assumed as relevant holistic ecological parameters in the dynamic model construction. This is the heart of the philosophy of the StDM. In a holistic perspective, the partial regression coefficients represent the global influence of the environmental variables selected, which are of significant importance on several complex ecological processes. To develop the dynamic model the software STELLA 8.1.4® was used.
Water quality indices and trophic level classification system are useful tools for enhancing communications between scientists, water managers, policymakers and/or the general public.

Figure 2 - Conceptual diagram of the StDM model used to assess the ecological status of the reservoirs in the Douro watershed, in a multi-scale approach. The model is composed by different sub-models and their interactions: Level 1, soil use dynamics model; Level 2, predict the responses of the water column environmental variables to changes due to land use changes; Level 3, predict the responses of biological variables to changes in environmental variables.
To complement the information about the ecological status of reservoir's water quality, the trophic state indices based on chlorophyll a, total phosphorus and Secchi disk depth outputs were introduced into the model based on Carlson's Trophic Status Index (TSI) (Carlson, 1977). Since nitrogen limitation still classifies a lake along Naumann's nutrient axis, the TSI(TN) (Kratzer et al, 1982) was also introduced in the model (see Table 2 for details).
The model is prepared to produce stochastic simulations based on the monthly stochastic variability of some environmental variables (Random Mode) (see Cabecinha et al., 2008a). Simulations based on stochastic principles take into consideration the random behaviour of some environmental variables with influence on the studied ecological phenomena. The limit values of environmental variables were determined, from the period between December 1995 and December 2004, to discriminate the maximum and minimum values of each stochastic environmental variable, included in the model as a RANDOM function (see Cabecinha et al., 2008a for details). For graphical representations, 10 stochastic simulations were carried out for the simulation period and the average tendencies were calculated for all the state variables considered in this study.
6.3.5.	Cellular Automata and Land Use Change - CA
The Cellular Automata (CA) is a dynamic technique that inherently integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions. CA is composed by four basic elements (White and Engelen, 2000; Scheller and Mladenoff, 2007): (1) Cell space: The cell space is composed of individual cell with variable geometric shape, although most CA adopt regular grids to represent such space, which make CA very similar to a raster GIS; (2) Cell states: The states of each cell may represent any spatial variable, e.g., several types of land uses; (3) Time steps: CA evolves a sequence of discrete time steps and the cells will be updated simultaneously based on transition rules at each step; (4) Transition rules: These rules are the heart of a CA that guide its dynamic evolution. A transition rule normally specifies the states of cell before and after updating based on its neighborhood conditions.

Therefore, essential to the simulation of spatial interactions is the representation of spatial information and the neighbourhood structure. In this work square cells of 250m were used.
Figure 3 - Diagram flow showing the relations between Stella, GIS and the Cellular Automata (CA).
These procedures are described in Section 2.5 of the text.
In this work, the transition rules were based in the following criteria: i) the dynamic land use change sub-model used for our StDM application (the Stella output file) gives the indication
for the land use trends ; and ii) a GIS image raster provides the initial values for all land use classes evolved on each simulated dynamic scenario (Fig. 3).
Spatial interactions among cells were defined by nearest neighbours (Fig. 4), allowing more flexibility in spatial interactions than vector polygons (Mladenoff and He, 1999). Therefore, and for demonstration purposes, the simulation algorithm increases, for instance, the area of a given land use (land use A), as indicated by the Stella file, through the identification of the nearest neighbours (land use B), inducing a consequent decrease in the respective area (Fig 4). In more realistic terms, since an initial type of land use may result in several different land use changes, this study analyzes the various neighborhood of a particular land use change pattern type. Firstly, the algorithm determines the number of elements of each class based in the GIS image raster; secondly, determined the number of elements that is necessary increased in each land use class amplified and the respectively “losing” classes. The process illustrated continued until the objective is complete (Fig 4).
6.3.6.	Scenario simulations
The scenario analysis has evolved into a standard methodology in environmental sciences for analyzing the effects of different driving forces and assessing the associated uncertainties. For academic demonstration purposes, a stochastic scenario was developed based on trends of the land cover recorded in the Douro watershed though a decade, from 1990 to 2000 (Corine Land Cover, IGEOE) and on the scenarios identified by the Douro River Basin Management Plan. For this management plan, five different entities were analyzed for possible developments in this region, namely living, working, agriculture, nature and government (INAG, 2008). These different elements were then combined in an integrated spatial scenario. Therefore, for the Torrão watershed the simulated trends in land use change were mainly based in the increasing of natural areas and abandonment of traditional agriculture areas. In table 3, is described the major characteristics of this scenario.
Figure 4 - Exemplificative diagram of the application of the Cellular Automata (CA) transitional rules. The simulation algorithm increases the area of a specified land use (land use A), as indicated by the output Stella file, through the identification of the nearest neighbours (land use B, decreased).
This scenario was selected to show in detail how the two complementary techniques, StDM and CA, can predicted and capture the expected changes at land use level and how this changes will be reflected in water quality in the Torrão reservoir, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels. In this context, the increase rates used for artificial territory, olive grove and vineyard were calculated according to the ratio: [(soil use area in 2000- soil use area in 1990)/soil use area in 1990)] (Chaves et al., 2000). Since the time unit chosen was the month, because it captures in an acceptable way the behaviour of the variables at the lower scales of our proposed approach (levels 2 and 3), the increase rates of the main dynamic land uses, ART TERT, OLV, VIN, BRN, SRB and FRT (see Table 1 for codes explanation), were converted to monthly periods by using the appropriated rate conversions described in Cabecinha et al. (2008a). The simulation period, a decade, was expressed in months, i.e., 120 months. For all state variables, the initial values considered were the data recorded for Torrão's Watershed in December 1995. Since the values of the first month for each period were used as initial values (t0), the simulations started effectively in January (t1).
Table 3 - Major characteristics of the scenario adopted for Torrão reservoir taking into account the Douro River Basin Plan (modified from INAG, 2000).
Base Simulation Scenario
■	Continuation of current agricultural system with subsidies for farmers, namely for vineyard and olive grove;
■	Abandonment of traditional agriculture areas, namely in rural regions due to population aging;
■	Increasing of sustainable agriculture-forest, agriculture-environmental and agriculture-rural investments;
■	Decreasing of the traditional industrial sectors (textile, clothing, shoe, ceramic and metallic products);
■	Slightly increase of residential areas manly associated to urban areas;
■	Tourism based on the maintenance of the landscape (rural and natural);
■	Major increase in natural areas, namely by forestation of burned and unproductive areas and increasing protected areas.
6.4.	Results and Discussion
The population growth was assumed to be the most important driver which alters regional economy and hence land use through time. The simulations were performed taking into account the scenario considered, based on realistic trends as stated by the Douro River Basin Management Plan. As a consequence of the populations aging the Douro region has assist an agricultural abandonment in rural areas (INE, 2008). This trend, associated with the diminished of generic agricultural subsidies, is leading to a sharp decrease in the area occupied by traditional agriculture. Nevertheless, the current agricultural system are still funding farmers, namely for vineyard and olive grove. But less profitable agricultural land will be left fallow. Large pieces of agricultural land could be bought up by nature conservation organizations for the development of nature reserves or by private individuals for rural tourism.
Facing this land use change scenario, the estimated responses of pertinent environmental and biological variables from the water column of Torrão reservoir are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The simulated trends with alterations at the level of Torrão's Watershed land use have important implications over the aquatic physicochemical parameters and structural composition of the phytoplankton community at the level of the respective reservoir. All the simulations for the environmental and biological variables (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), as well for the trophic state indices (Fig. 7), reproduce with consistence the seasonal fluctuations expected in this type of reservoirs as a result of such scenario (Wetzel, 2001). Moreover, the scenario of agricultural abandonment in the Torrão catchment has leaded to a decrease in nutrient concentration (NO3), Cl, hardness and turbidity (Fig. 5). This logic physicochemical response (J0rgensen et al., 2005) had a natural influence on the seasonal pattern of biological variables, with a consequent and credible decrease in Chlorophyll a concentration peaks, an expression of potential algal blooms (Heiskanen and Solimini, 2005) (Fig. 5).
For the phytoplankton species richness, a dominant resilient pattern was observed, an expectable response since the selected taxonomic groups are composed by species with a high range of sensitivity to environmental stress (Wetzel, 2001).

Level 3 - Biological variables
Figure 5 - StDM computer simulations for the average values of aquatic environmental (Level 2) and biological variables (Level 3) from the Torrão reservoir water column through a period of 10 years. The lines result from the average values of 10 monthly stochastic simulations based on the scenario described in Table 3. The specification of the variable codes is expressed in Table 1.
In fact, a relative stable seasonal pattern of phytoplankton succession was observed for all the phytoplankton groups analysed (Fig. 5). These patterns were consistent with the behaviour of these groups facing similar contexts of other temperate lakes and reservoirs (Reynolds, 1984; Mischke, 2003; Figueiredo et al., 2006). These seasonal successions are strongly conditionated by meteorological and stratification-mixing processes (Wetzel, 2001). Therefore, the variation in the abundance of the total phytoplankton, represented by the chlorophyll a content simulations, shown a credible seasonal pattern with an earlier maximum occurring through spring and early summer to a maximum in July, (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). This pattern is probably typical of many "mesotrophic" temperate lakes and reservoirs (Reynolds, 1984; Wetzel, 2001; Mischke, 2003).

Figure 6 - StDM computer simulations for the average values of trophic state indices, namely TSI for chlorophyll a, Total phosphorus, Total N and Secchi depth from the Torrão reservoir water column through a period of 10 years. The lines result from the average values of 10 monthly stochastic simulations based on the scenario described in Table 3. The dotted lines represent the limits of the different reservoir trophic state levels, from oligotrophy (&lt;30) to hypereutrophy (&gt;70) (see Table 2 for details).
It is supposed that the peaks reflect the coincidence of physically-suitable growth conditions, with relatively high concentrations of limiting nutrients shortages of which prevent the
attainment of large biomasses during the midsummer period (Reynolds, 1984; Domingues et al., 2007). Seasonal succession pattern of phytoplankton in temperate reservoirs, such as the case of Torrão, usually involves a winter minimum with species adapted to low light and temperature, a late winter-spring and autumn peaks of diatom richness, followed rapidly by the development of green algae in the spring and finally the transition in late summer and early autumn to a peak of Cyanobacteria (Reynolds, 1984; Wetzel, 2001; Figueiredo et al., 2006). As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the model simulations were able to capture the expected pattern of these variables in this type of reservoirs.

Figure 7 - StDM computer simulations showing the seasonal yearly pattern of phytoplankton succession, represented by diatoms (DTM), green algae (CLP) and cyanobacteria (CN) richness and chlorophyll a concentration, in Torrão reservoir. The lines result from the average values of 10 monthly stochastic simulations, for the first year simulated, based on the scenario described in Table 3.
Relatively to the Trophic State Indices (TSI), they reflected well the meaning of the trends simulated, namely as a result of the decrease of non point source pollution due to the abandonment of traditional agricultural areas, as well as by forestation of burned and unproductive areas (Jprgensen et al., 2005). As a consequence, the TSI simulated for
Chlorophyll a, Total N and Secchi depth, show a consistent decrease throughout the simulation period, mostly reflecting trophic state level changes (Fig.7). With regard to the TSI (N) the reservoir trophic level changes from hypereutrophic to an oligo-mesotrophic state, which is a realistic response to such scenario, namely by decreasing the anthropogenic impacts associated to agricultural practices. The TSI for total phosphorus concentrations exhibits only a slightly decrease, may be because the phosphorus retention capacity of deep reservoirs is very high in temperate reservoirs (Wetzel, 2001; J0rgensen et al., 2005). This capacity could reach 80% of the upflow, and increases with the areal phosphorus load (J0rgensen et al., 2005).
As this StDM model have been published and statistically validated in the previous chapter (Cabecinha et al., 2008a) it was deemed robust and suitable for our purpose. Overall, the performance of the StDM simulations shows realism in capturing the behavioural patterns for the generality of the relevant metrics adopted. Therefore, the state variables used in the construction of the StDM model reflect well the shift of the environmental characteristics towards known holistic conditions and are capable of responding with credibility to the dynamics of the underlying ecological “cascade” processes (that are implicit in a multi-scale perspective). These results showed that the aquatic metrics selected, as state variables, were not indifferent to changes in the ecological conditions, namely when conditions were changed by man-induced disturbances at the watershed level. The relevant ecological drifts simulated are in agreement with real observations and other studies that investigated the biological consequences of similar environmental changes (Wetzel, 2001; J0rgensen et al., 2005; Cabecinha et al., 2008b).
Several studies have found the landscape structure to be the main factor influencing water quality in streams and reservoirs (Allan et al., 1997; Cifaldi et al., 2004; Soininen, 2007). This influence of land use is scale dependent and varies in time and space (Buck et al., 2004). This has been shown at the global scale, as well as at the regional and local scales for catchments dominated by agricultural land use, for forested areas and for heterogeneous multifunctional landscapes (Chen et al., 2001; Buck et al., 2004). In designing landscapes for reservoir management the great challenge is to make the knowledge gleaned about ecological processes and species response accessible to the planning process. Often this information is expressed mathematically, which is not meaningful or accessible to landscape
planners. Therefore, in order to make this knowledge available to the planning process, the scenario adopted in this study must be expressed spatially in a format suitable for scenariotesting. With this objective, the same dynamic model outputs, used to obtain the StDM simulations, enable us to simulate, by using the CA interface with GIS, the spatial changes described for the Torrão watershed (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, when simulating land uses trends, increasing one type (e.g., Olive grove, vineyard or forest) within the studied region will inevitably decrease that of others, such as the traditional agricultural, burned and unproductive areas. Although the current CA approach is rather simple, yet the underneath merit lies in its ability in revealing the spatial dynamic of land use evolution established by dynamic outputs.
6.5.	Conclusions
Nowadays, in monitoring and management programs, the construction of predictive tools for ecological management, namely in terms of cost and speed of reliable assessment results, is crucial. In this scope, we believe that our present proposal will provide the development of a true management tool, namely taking into account stochastic/random phenomena that characterize the real ecological processes (Van der Meer et al., 1996). Moreover, the methodology presented offers a unifying approach with the spatial background and the multi-level connections that gives realism to the interactions considered by incorporating a typical “cascade effect” observed in the dynamic of the studied reservoirs. On the other hand, since the watersheds are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in space and time, influenced by many interacting factors and by feedback mechanisms, this multi-scale approach is particularly helpful to capture these multi-factor influences in relevant planning scenarios.
When compared to other modelling methodologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (Dzeroski et al., 1997; Kuo et al., 2006), our methodology is more intuitive, namely in mathematical terms, providing easy explanations for the underlying relations between independent and dependent variables and because is based on conventional linear methods that allowed a more direct development of testable hypotheses. Dzeroski et al. (1997) referred that models produced in the form of rules, based on machine learning approaches, are transparent and can be easily understood by experts.

Figure 8 - Cellular Automata simulation, through a period of 10 years, of land use change in Torrão watershed, based on the scenario described in Table
3. (A) represents the initial state and (B) the final out put 10 years later.
The integrative application of the two complementary techniques, StDM and CA, exhibits these structural qualities but provides also simple, suitable and intuitive outputs, easily interpreted by non-experts (ranging from resource users to senior policy makers). The selection of new scenarios in both techniques is quick and relatively easy to the end-user and allows not only the direct expression of spatial changes to be visualised, but also for the consequences of the changes for water quality dynamics to be assessed.
Therefore, this study seems to represent a useful contribution for the holistic implementation of the WFD, namely for integrated assessments of the reservoirs ecological status within the environmental gradients or “data space” monitored. Since the ultimate goal was to produce simulation models that permit the creation of spatially explicit ecological patterns we believe that the present approach provide a useful starting point to develop more global techniques in the scope of this research area. In fact, the methodology presented in this paper is an example of how this can be achieved, by creating expeditious interfaces with GIS, which make the modelling outputs more instructive and intuitive to decision-makers and environmental managers (Costanza and Voinov, 2003).

Final remarks and future perspectives: Function and management of Portuguese reservoirs
7.1.	Final remarks
Worldwide aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by broad-scale environmental pressures such as agriculture, point and non point-source pollution and land-use changes overlapping in space and time, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems (Brazner et al, 2007; Danz et al., 2007). In face of this global change, declines in environmental quality of rivers and respective reservoirs are of increasing concern. The ecological condition or “reservoir health” can be described by a vast group of factors comprising the physico-chemical characteristics of water quality, hydrology, geomorphology, habitat and biological quality (Barbour et al., 2000; Karr and Chu, 2000). In this sense, the studies accomplished in this dissertation attempted to develop tools for the characterization and quantification of the disturbance level of some of these components, as well as to implement management assessment tools. The work presented here, as well as the associated data basis, is part of a wider project of ecological quality evaluation of national reservoirs adapted for the north and centre of Portuguese watersheds, denominated “Ecological quality and integrated management of reservoirs” and supported by INAG. On the other hand, this work also seeks the implementation of the obtained results in future monitoring programs allowing the improvement of the national aquatic ecosystems knowledge.
Although geographically circumscribed to the north and centre, this work includes the majority of the reservoirs explored for hydropower purposes. Therefore, we tried to characterize the entire diversity of these ecosystems, which comprised the high degree of variability in the phytoplankton communities. However, even presenting differences in biological assemblage structure and composition, the described management assessment tools require always a previous evaluation and/or validation, in case they are applied to other geographic areas and/or used other scales of monitoring effort. This work intends to present alternative or complementary methods to the ones commonly use, and seek above all, to increase the knowledge of the dynamics and the response to various kinds of human impacts of the Portuguese lentic biota.
This chapter represents a synthetic analysis of the different approaches developed in the previous chapters, stressing the main conclusions. Also it intends to elucidate for their
practical use for the assessment of reservoirs ecological status, accordingly to the WFD (Table 1).
Relying on the vast group of the analyzed environmental parameters, integrating different spatial and temporal scales and embracing different levels of human pressure, it was possible to establish the typology of the hydroelectric Portuguese reservoirs and to distinguish groups formed by reference and most degraded sites for each type. It was demonstrated that the used methods are effective to quantify the different disturbance levels in a regional basis. The results of the different approaches were consistent to the typology defined and were related to the observed pollution gradients, which at some extent reflected the degradation associated to the conversion of the agroforestry areas into industrialized and semi-urban areas.
The second chapter shows that multivariate analyses based on environmental variables and phytoplankton assemblages, allowed to define the different types of surface waters from North and Centre of Portugal. From the studied 34 hydroelectric-power reservoirs, it was possible to identify two types of dammed water bodies which were characterized by different hydromorphological features, water chemistry characteristics and by a specific phytoplankton taxa:
•	Type 1 represents lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus) characterized by higher concentrations of nutrients and water mineral content. This “riverine reservoirs”, resembles more a river than a lake, with short hydraulic retention times, good mixing and relative high water velocities, never or rarely affected by stratification phenomena. In general, is located in densely populated, industrialized or agricultural areas, receiving high inputs of organic matter and industrial discharge.
•	Type 2 represents deeper high altitude “artificial lake reservoirs”, largely located in tributaries, with a high residence time, with longer water storage and release cycles operating under seasonal influence, strongly affected by stratification phenomena.
Table 1 - Synopsis of the 5 approaches developed to assess the ecological integrity of Portuguese reservoirs: objectives, main conclusions of each chapter and its application in the WFD.
Objectives
Main conclusions
Application in the WFD
■	To define the types of Portuguese hydroelectric reservoirs based on biotic and abiotic factors.
■	To assess their ecological status using phytoplankton as water quality indicators.
■ To determine the importance of environmental variables at different spatial (geographical, regional and local) and time scales (seasons, years) on the phytoplankton community structure of the two reservoir types.
■	Were defined two groups of Portuguese hydroelectric reservoirs:
Type 1 - lowland "run-of river" reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with low residence time, higher water mineral content and nutrient concentrations;
Type 2 - deeper high altitude "artificial lake" reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with a high residence time.
■	Nitrate concentration and water mineral content were mainly responsible for the dissimilarity among the two groups.
■	It was possible to assign characteristic phytoplankton taxa assemblages to each type of reservoir. The phytoplankton community differed significantly in terms of composition and taxa richness.
■	For both regulated systems types, was also possible to establish the characteristic taxa of disturbed and less or non disturbed sites.
■	The taxa composition was manly structured by factors related to geographic location, reservoir type and anthropogenic pressure.
■	Development of a routine for monitoring ecological status according to the WFD.
■	Define the reference situation, which is the basis of the ecological assessment.
■	Development of an assessment procedure according WFD where the assessment shall be done by comparing the actual species composition to the one that would be present under reference conditions.
■	Distinct gradients were identified along which phytoplankton assemblage structure changes within the studied hydroelectric Portuguese reservoirs.
■	The differences detected among reservoir' phytoplankton communities indicated that taxa compositions were differentially structured by factors related to geographic location, catchment land use, hydromorphological variables and time.
■	Reservoir's phytoplankton communities were structured by processes operating over multiple spatial scales. These scales were clearly interrelated, implying that phytoplankton assemblages are capable of detecting stress from catchment to site scales.
■	Not all taxa were equally well explained by the same set of environmental variables.
■	The majority of among-site variability in phytoplankton composition was explained by time variables, followed by local, regional and geographical scale variables, probably related to the management of reservoirs.
■ Development of reservoir quality assessment systems as an integrated part of River Basin Management Plans, which aims at rehabilitating and/or maintaining the biological and functional integrity of rivers, and respective reservoirs.
Objectives
Main conclusions
Application in the WFD
■	To explore the use of PRC analysis in ecosystem health assessment using monitoring data from Portuguese reservoirs with hydroelectric power.
■	To analyse changes, over time, in phytoplankton composition and environmental variables between reservoirs with different ecological status of the two studied types of
o_ Mediterranean reservoirs.
ro
_c
■PRC analysis, for both reservoirs types, showed significant differences between the reference and impaired sites, reflecting the levels of disturbance that they experience over the study period, manly associated with a clear spatial gradient related to eutrophication.
■	Time, namely differences in sampling dates, clearly assumed major importance in Type 1 than in Type 2 reservoirs in explaining the variance in species composition and environmental variables.
■	In general, the biggest deviations from impaired sites to reference reservoirs of Type 2 are associated to seasonality (namely in summer periods) and bloom formations.
■	PRC proved to be capable of concisely summarising the complex data set of the phytoplankton community whilst permitting information to be displayed with visual clarity and easily to interpret to non-experts, namely decision makers, politicians and general public.
■	Define the reference situation and estimate the degree of impairment at a particular site by contrasting it with a reference site over time, which is the basis of the ecological assessment.
■	Easily analysed, interpret and compared the monitoring results, as well as the results of eventual mitigation measures implemented to assess "Maximum Ecological Potential".
■	Provide decision-makers with a diagnostic tool for the ecological functioning of aquatic systems.
■ To examine and validate the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) lo (PT103753 (pat. pend) in predicting the tendencies of phytoplankton communities and ■g_	physicochemical conditions in reservoirs as a
ra	response to the changes in the respective
kJ watersheds soil use, for the Douro's basin.
■ To examine the StDM developed, coupled with a Cellular Automata (CA) model, facing new scenarios that captured expected changes at « land use level.
ft "To test the reservoir dynamics responsive to changes in catchment inputs of nutrients due to land use changes in expected scenarios, based in the Catchment Plan of the Douro river, namely regarding the evaluation of the pollutants reduction achieved through management measures.
■	The state variables reflect well the shift of the environmental characteristics towards known conditions and are capable of responding with credibility to the dynamics of the underlying ecological "cascade" processes, implicit in a multiscale perspective.
■	The StDM model captures the stochastic complexity of some holistic ecological trends, including true temporal and spatial gradients of stochastic environmental characteristics, which allowed the simulation of structural changes when habitat and environmental conditions are substantially changing due to anthropogenic-induced alterations.
■	The simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the tool reliability in capturing the stochastic environmental dynamics of the selected metrics facing spatial explicit scenarios.
■	The methodology presented offers a unifying approach with the spatial background and the multi-level connections that gives realism to the interactions considered by incorporating a typical "cascade effect" observed in the dynamic of the studied reservoirs.
■	The integrative application of the two complementary techniques, StDM and CA, exhibits these structural qualities but provides also simple, suitable and intuitive outputs, easily interpreted by non-experts (ranging from resource users to senior policy makers).
■ Provide a useful starting point, as a contribution for the practical implementation of the WFD, allowing the development of a true integrated assessment tool for water quality management, both at the scale of the reservoir body and at the scale of the respective river watershed dynamics.
■	Couple monitoring assessment and modelling approaches to ease the management and decision making regarding the requirements of the WFD.
■	Create expeditious interfaces with GIS, which make the modelling outputs more instructive and intuitive to decisionmakersand environmental managers.
This typology identified in hydroelectric Portuguese reservoirs was initially based on environmental variables, but was also corroborated by changes in phytoplankton assemblage, being possible to assign characteristic taxa assemblages to each type and in each type to determine the typical taxa of non disturbed and disturbed sites (Chapter 2, 3 and 4). Such ascription is an essential prerequisite for the development of an assessment procedure according to the WFD where the assessment should be done by comparing the actual species composition to the one that would be present under reference conditions (REFCOND, 2003). Moreover, such taxa may be classed further in a quantitative scale, since it is ranked according to the probability of belonging to each group, allowing to the definition of the four levels established by the WFD.
The described types do not contradict the proposal of previous works (see INAG, 2006), based in different organisms, namely macroinvertebrates, fishes and macrophytes. It is possible that the analysis of only one community, since it absorves the cumulative impacts, is able to quantify the disturbances that occur in the aquatic system allowing to extrapolate such effects to other communities (Dziock et a.l, 2006). Though, the conjugation of diversified information can, on the other hand, to reduce the extrapolation error and to give us a global image of reservoir condition.
Multivariate techniques revealed to be important for the identification of the reference sites after the ecotypes settlement. They contributed also for the identification of disturbance gradients in the biological assemblages. Therefore, for each reservoir Type it was possible to identify distinct gradients of human disturbance, along which environmental variables and phytoplankton assemblages changed. These gradients were more evident in Type 2 than in type 1, since Type 1 group was more homogeneous and most of "run-of river" reservoirs in Portugal lie in densely populated regions and therefore represent rather impacted sites. The Type 2 group was quite variable, displaying a clear disturbance gradient, from deep colder sites, mainly oligotrophic to warmer sites, mostly eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic.
This work has reinforced the need to characterize sites or reference conditions and to infer that their selection is a crucial stage in the process of ecological quality assessment of the lentic systems.
The third chapter of this thesis explores the the importance of environmental variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional and local) and time in structuring
phytoplankton communities in each type of reservoirs. Reservoir's phytoplankton communities were structured by processes operating over multiple spatial scales, namely geographic location, catchment land use, hydromorphological variables and time. Our results and those of earlier studies are consistent with hierarchy theory; namely that species composition at a site is the product of environmental filters operating at successive spatial scales (Poff, 1997). Frissell et al. (1986), defined the “hierarchical concept of landscape”, here spatial scales are related or even interdependent, at least unidirectionally from large to small levels. This was reflected in our study by the strong shared effects of spatial scales in both reservoir types. Since the effects of different spatial scales on phytoplankton communities were clearly interrelated, hence imply that phytoplankton assemblages are capable of detecting stress from catchment to site scales (Fallu et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2005; INAG, 2006; Soininen, 2007).
Not only scale-related effects, but a number of other factors should be considered when selecting response variables or organism group(s) to monitor the effects human-induced stress on reservoirs (Rosenberg and Resh, 1993). Ideally, focus should be on selecting response variables that are related causally and/or strongly associated (proximate indicator) with the type and degree of perturbation to be monitored (Downes et al., 2002). Phytoplankton seems to be a good indicator for multi-scale and cumulative disturbance effects with a view to integrate future worldwide monitoring in reservoirs.
Our findings of the importance of local and regional scale factors on community structure of reservoirs lend support to earlier studies, namely on the growing body of literature arguing the importance of habitat and large-scale (landscape) factors on reservoir ecosystems. A fundamental understanding of community function is needed for rehabilitating and/or maintaining the biological and functional integrity of rivers, and respective reservoirs, as required by the WFD (GIG, 2007).
The fourth chapter shows a new bioassessment approach through PRC analysis to assess changes in species composition and environmental variables between sites with different ecological status over time. In concordance with the previous chapters' results, the PRC analyses showed significant differences between the reference and impaired sites of each Type, reflecting the levels of disturbance that they experience over the study period, manly associated with a clear spatial gradient related to eutrophication.
Multivariate methods, as shown in chapters 2 and 3, preserve more information in the data set by summarising its multi-dimensionality in a 2-D or 3-D plot within which ecological meaningful trends and patterns can be seen. However, when a time factor is present within the data, the summary ordination plots and diagrams from traditional ordination methods (namely, principal component analysis: PCA; or multi-dimensional scaling: MDS) can still remain elusive to non-specialists and hence are difficult to interpret, because temporal trajectories are often non-linear in such plots (Warwick and Clarke 1991; Van den Brink and Ter Braak 1999; Pardal et al., 2004). Contrairily, the PRC was capable of concisely summarising the complex data set of the phytoplankton community whilst permitting information to be displayed with visual clarity and easily to interpret to non-experts, namely decision makers and general public (Van den Brink and Ter Braak 1999; Van den Brink et al. 2008). Therefore, PRC analysis could be a powerful tool to reach and implementing WFD objectives since allowed to measure, in time, the degree of impairment at a particular site by contrasting it with a reference site as proposed by WFD (Van den Brink et al. 2008). Consequently, it can be applied to evaluate mitigation measures that might lead to a better environmental quality or even establish threshold values/levels necessary for qualitative evaluation of ecosystem health (Pardal et al., 2004). These mitigation measures could pass through the reduction of the nutrient load from the catchment to the reservoir, alteration of the hydrodynamic conditions (e.g. artificial mixing or intermittent turbulence of the water column) or even application of in-reservoirs ecotechnologies (J0rgensen et al., 2005).
Modelling can be very useful, for decision support, as an investigative tool to forecast the outcome of various scenarios, to guide current management in order to meet future targets and to develop integrated frameworks for management accordingly to the WFD (EEA, 2002). In this context, in chapter 5 was developed an holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) to predict the ecological condition trends in reservoirs as a response to the changes in the respective watersheds soil use. Therefore, the case of the Douro's basin was used to test and validated the StDM application in a multi-scale approach to predict the ecological status of this lentic ecosystem. As an improvement of the initial StDM model, in chapter 6 was also adopted a Cellular Automata (CA) model to investigate and visualize land use change from a spatial evolution perspective. Subsequently, was examined the performance of this approach, in capturing how expected changes at land use level, based in new
management scenarios, could alter the reservoir water quality, namely at physicochemical and phytoplankton levels. CA alone could be too simplified to predict all characteristics of changes (Yang et al, 2008), nevertheless the possibility for CA to be integrate with other methods, like the stochastic dynamic model presented and SIG lead to increasing advantages allowing to investigate and visualize the spatial dynamic of land use evolution.
The overall results were encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the tool reliability in capturing the stochastic complexity of some holistic ecological trends of the selected metrics facing spatial explicit scenarios. Nowadays, in monitoring and management programs, the construction of predictive tools for ecological management, namely in terms of cost and speed of reliable assessment results, is crucial. In this scope, the methodology proposed is expeditious and easily applicable to new management scenarios affected by gradients of changes due to anthropogenic-induced alterations.
Therefore, StDM model presented (PT103753 (pat. pend); Cabecinha et al., 2007a) could be integrated, as an exploratory tool, in the Douro's watershed management program, allowing the simulation of more complex decision making scenarios, namely the evaluation of the implementation of new mitigation measures. The ultimate goal was to the development of more global techniques by creating new interfaces with Cellular automata models and Geographic Information Systems, which could make this methodology more intuitive to decision-makers and environmental managers.
The combination of multivariate techniques and modelling could improve in a sinergistically way the performance of the developed methods. However, the option to use one or other method, or to its combination, should always have in consideration the objectives of the study to realize since all present potentialities and drawbacks.
On the contrary of other countries of the European Union, Portugal has not defined yet which biological indicators, metrics and monitoring programs should be used for the classification of ecological status of water bodies. A similar problem should be placed relatively to the hydromorphological elements to support the information arising from biological elements, which is essential for the establishment of the reference conditions (REFCOND, 2003). In this perspective, this thesis may bring a new contribution for the prosecution of the implementation of the WFD, since it develops methods and establishes metrics to assess the ecological condition, observing the principles established by the WFD.
However, we must point out that there is a lack of information for a great number of phytoplankton species, namely concerning individual autoecology. With this work we try make a little contribute to the understanding of species-environmental relations and ecological responses of phytoplankton communities in aquatic ecosystems, namely in artificial water bodies.
Table 1 attempts to make a summary of the different approaches developed in this dissertation namely with regard to the objectives and main conclusions in each chapter. Finally, it is also pointed out how they can contribute to the implementation of the WFD in Portugal, with regard specifically to the evaluation of the ecological status.
Based on the above discussion and considerations the following trends in environmental management are expected in the future (Jprgensen et al., 2005):
■	A generally more integrated management that simultaneously considers ecosystem health and human health;
■	Wider use of integrated models, i.e., models that consider more than one aspect of problem, namely social-economic-ecological models;
■	A more open debate between politicians and citizens in their efforts to find proper solutions to environmental issues.
7.2.	Future perspectives for WFD implementation and adaptation to climate change on management processes
Aquatic systems are subjected to a variety of anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and eutrophication that can damage the health and robustness of the fauna and flora through single, cumulative or synergistic processes, lowering the overall stability of these ecosystems. Nevertheless, besides the numerous stressors that aquatic systems are typically subjected, face now, the additional stressor of climate change (e.g. increased intensity/frequency of extreme weather events). Climate change will have a major impact on water resources and it will require changes in the way that Europeans manage and protect these resources, although the management of that impact is global rather than only a
European-scale issue (Note the 2004 Arctic Council Report on the climate change and impacts in the Arctic).
The ecological resources protection relapses in the capacity to identify and to predict the effects of human activities in the biological systems which, at a first level, depends on the ability to distinguish natural variation from anthropogenic one (REFCOND, 2003). To enable the distinction between natural variability and anthropogenically caused changes, the WFD introduced the requirement to work out a detailed typology of water bodies and to specify type specific reference conditions (RC) that could serve as the basis for ecological assessment (REFCOND, 2003). Nevertheless, several questions need to be answered, namely “should be update the natural range of values to accommodate “natural” changes, such as climate change?”
It will be essential to discuss the conceptual impacts of the climate change on the process and requirements of the ecological status assessment in the WFD. Therefore, is crucial to improve the methods and the existent applications, seeking to fill some existing gaps, as well as to develop new investigation lines that can contribute with new diagnosis tools of the effects of the climate change in the ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems (EEA, 2004). The next challenges in the assessment of rivers and reservoirs ecological integrity will be (based on Arnell, 1999; EEA, 2001, 2004, 2005; WCD, 2000; Bronstert, 2003; WWF, 2006):
•	To understand how the anticipated effects of the climate change will affect most of the physical, chemical and biological parameters of water bodies used for ecological quality assessment. Several of the typology factors suggested by the WFD are actually climatic variables (mean air temperature, precipitation), and are intimately linked to topographical gradients such as, altitude, latitude, longitude, river flow, water level, lake mixing, or may be influenced by climate in a longer perspective (morphometric characteristics). As a result of climate change, water bodies, especially those located near the boundary of the type characteristics may change of type. Consequently, classification scales and therefore the river basin management plans need to be adapted taking into account the effects of climate change.
•	To develop dynamic reference conditions, since this reference cannot be considered as static but have to change as a consequence of climate change impacts on physical
and chemical conditions of water bodies. The concept of a flexible RC, capable of responding to natural changes could be the appropriate way to incorporate irreversible large-scale anthropogenic impacts (e.g. climate change, species extinctions and introduction) in the WFD assessment systems. Therefore, the review of the river basin characterization every 6 years, as required by the WFD, should also include re-evaluation of the reference conditions. As a consequence the restoration targets (i.e. the good ecological status) will also need to be evaluated periodically.
• To understand how the intensification of the hydrological cycle is likely to cause extreme events. The available studies regarding European water resources appear to give a rather fragmented and incomplete picture of the effects of this tendency. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand and quantified the risk of dramatic events in projections of future climate scenarios, namely the increasing occurrence of drought and flood events and its effects in the ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems. Then, it will be possible to identify the characteristics and critical attributes of the system, the diagnosis of probable changes in their functioning and the potential response of organisms to these alterations of the ecological condition.
•	To understand how the seasonal distribution of the rainfall and the frequency of extremes changes will affect reservoirs, namely how change in the water residence time and/or change in the water level affect this ecosystems. The rate of water renewal affects nutrient dynamics and has a critical effect on eutrophication, while changes in the water level, especially in shallow lakes, affect the strength of sediment resuspension and light conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to establish how this warm water and longer periods of stratification can promote a dominance of potentially toxic Cyanobacteria.
•	To develop modelling tools to analyse and understand regional climatic changes, the underlying changes within these catchment systems, and the hydrochemical and ecological behaviour occurring in aquatic ecosystems. Namely, to develop spatial dynamic models for projecting future responses of biological assemblages to climate changes. The models should have in consideration the physiological tolerances, competition, and dispersal mechanisms of the organisms. To this purpose, integrated
models that use chemical and physical measurements together with biological indicators it will be a convenient mechanism to diagnose the different impacts.
•	To create multimetric indices and to establish metrics of more global application (national scale or wider biogeographical areas) for the use of more universal variables less subject to site-specific conditions. The indices must be based on score systems related to reference conditions that combine the expert knowledge, multivariate data analysis and modelling techniques since they can play a crucial role in the development, evaluation and optimization of these indices.
•	The insipid understanding of the phytoplankton species auto-ecology, its relationship with the environmental variables as well as with future climate changes trends turns necessary more works in these areas of the knowledge.
•	To invest in complementary indicators of the degradation level of freshwater systems that involve other biotic communities such as macroinvertebrates, fish fauna, macrophytes and birds, integrating all the available data and multidisciplinary teams. The great amount of information generated for the ecological condition characterization implies the development of new techniques of data synthesizing and interpretation.
Extreme weather events will became more frequent in the future and the ecosystems, and the goods and services they provide, risk never recovering fully if their resilience is been reduced by other stressors such as pollution. Aquatic management needs to be more holistic and recognize the importance of such interaction between different stressors to the ecosystem's ecological integrity.
