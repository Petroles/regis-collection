ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  

 

God, the eternal inspiration. Even belonging to a different magisteria from that of 

science, He was part of this scientific work by giving me strength enough for 

carrying such difficult experiment. 

 

My beloved Luísa, who helped me every day with her sweetness and honesty - she 

never let me feel alone. When lost, her wisdom pointed me the correct way for 

several times. I`m sure we are looking to the same horizon. 

 

Family: great mentors. They helped me here, far away from home and for so long. Even 

not agreeing with this career I choose and its future, they were always with me. I owe 

them all education I had. 

 

Professor Jorge Dergam, my adviser and the wiser person I ever met. With him, I could 

see evolution on its philosophical context and, therefore, surpass the borders of 

cytogenetics. He showed me how deep science can be. 

 

Professor Silvia das Graças Pompolo, my first adviser. She introduced me to the vast 

cytogenetics world. Through her I learned the correct laboratory proceedings and 

protocols, since how to look on a microscope to the chromosome banding 

techniques. 

 

Professors Rubens Pazza and Karine Kavalco for being part of this appraisal. 

 

Teachers Cyomara and Nilton from Elementary and High School respectively. They 

showed me how amazing science is – In my early life, they instructed me how to 

look for new results, right questions and unexpected answers.

All great sailors that served with me at the Beagle (our laboratory). I worked there time 

enough to navigate with different and great crews. There were so many moments of 

learning and fun, of professionalism and friendship, of field work and lab. work. 

Such trip won?t ever be forgotten. 

 

The skilful hands of Priscilla, Natalia, Udson and Maykon that helped me a lot with the 

molecular experiments. 

 

All technical staff that helped me to obtain such findings and let me write this 

dissertation. Including Marcelo Cioffi for the FISH technique, Samuel Paiva for

A complexa família Characidae é parte da fauna ictiológica neotropical e conta 

com várias espécies e gêneros em condição de Incertae Sedis. Os gêneros Astyanax e 

Oligosarcus, considerados muito aparentados, estão incluídos nesta família e abrangem 

espécies de pequeno tamanho e expressiva abundância em muitos rios e córregos da 

América do sul. Na bacia do rio Doce, no sudeste brasileiro, uma análise morfológica 

preliminar permitiu a identificação de cinco peixes “semelhantes à Astyanax” que 

continham no seu osso maxilar de 8 a 13 dentes. Esses cinco peixes, chamados no 

presente trabalho de dentuços, foram coletados em simpatria com as espécies Astyanax 

bimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758), Astyanax giton (Eigenmann, 1908) e Oligosarcus 

argenteus Günther, 1864. De modo a determinar a natureza biológica dos dentuços, foi 

realizado um estudo multidisciplinar envolvendo dados morfológicos citogenéticos e 

moleculares. Os dentuços apresentaram configurações intermediárias entre as espécies 

A. giton e O. argenteus no que diz respeito ao número de escamas na linha lateral e ao 

número de dentes no osso maxilar. As análises citogenéticas, feitas através das técnicas 

de Giemsa, bandeamento NOR, bandeamento-C, fluorocromos, e FISH, indicaram que 

todas as espécies de caracídeos contaram com número diploide 2n=50 cromossomos 

diferindo, porém, em vários caracteres de sua morfologia cromossômica. Os dentuços 

caracterizaram-se por apresentar altos índices de variação cromossômica tanto intra- 

como inter-individual. Além do mais, eles contaram com vários cromossomos não 

pareáveis assim como cromossomos de tamanho diminuto que não são observados em 

nenhuma daquelas espécies simpátricas de Characidae. Três espécimes dos dentuços 

apresentaram seu fragmento de DNA do gene mitocondrial citocromo b (475 pb) 

idêntico aquele de O. argenteus e, contudo, todos os dentuços compartilhavam mais 

alelos ISSR com os espécimes de A. giton do que com os espécimes de O. argenteus. 

Por outro lado, uma espécie de dentuço conta com o gene cyt. b idêntico aquele das 



xii 

 

espécies de A. giton estudadas. A análise de fragmentos ITS-1 (1123 pb) mostrou que os 

dentuços têm sequencias mais relacionadas à Oligosarcus  argenteus. Os dados, desse 

modo, sugeriram que os dentuços são híbridos entre as espécies A. giton e O. argenteus 

representando assim o primeiro caso de hibridismo espontâneo entre dois gêneros de 

peixes neotropicais. A relevância de tal descoberta para a biologia da conservação e 

para as investigações filogenéticas foram discutidas.

Abstract 

 

AGUIAR, Hilton Jeferson Alves Cardoso. M. Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, 

February, 2011. First report on spontaneous hybridization between Astyanax 

giton Baird &amp;amp; Girard 1854 and Oligosarcus argenteus Günther 1864 (Pisces : 

Characidae): Ecological and Phylogenetic inferences. Advisor: Jorge Abdala 

Dergam. Co-advisors: Silvia das Graças Pompolo and Rubens Pazza.  

 

Within the Neotropical fish fauna, the taxonomically complex family Characidae 

has many species and genera in Incertae Sedis condition. Within this family, the closely 

related genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus are represented by small sized fishes that are 

an expressive proportion of the freshwater biodiversity in many rivers of South 

America. In the Doce River Basin, Southeastern Brazil, a preliminary morphologic 

analysis indicated the presence of 5 Astyanax-like fish with unusually high numbers (8-

13) of maxillary teeth which are referred as “toothed morphs”. These fishes were 

collected in sympatry with Astyanax bimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758), Astyanax giton 

(Eigenmann, 1908), and Oligosarcus argenteus Günther, 1864. To determine the 

biological status of them a comparative multidisciplinary approach involving 

morphologic, cytogenetic and molecular data was conducted, with the toothed morphs 

and their sympatric species. The toothed morphs showed an intermediate position in 

lateral line scale numbers and maxillary teeth number between A. giton and O. 

argenteus. Cytogenetic analyses (Giemsa, NOR, C-banding, fluorochromes and FISH) 

indicated that all sympatric characids were 2n=50, although they differed from each 

other in many other karyotypic characters. The toothed morphs were characterized by 

high levels of intra and inter-individual chromosomal variation including several 

unpairable chromosomes and tiny chromosomes that were not observed in either of the 

other sympatric species. Three toothed morphs specimens had their cytochrome b DNA 

fragment (475 bp) identical to O. argenteus, with one exception which its cyt. b DNA 

sequence was identical to A. giton. Moreover, all toothed morphs ITS-1 DNA sequences 

were characterized by their similitude to those sequences of Oligosarcus argenteus. On 

the other hand, all toothed morphs shared more ISSR alleles with A. giton. The data 

suggested that the toothed morphs were hybrids between A. giton and O. argenteus, 

representing the first evidence for spontaneous hybridization between two Neotropical

fish genera. The relevance of such findings in conservation biology and phylogeny 

assessment were discussed

The Characiformes and the Characidae problem 

 

Among bony fish, the order Characifomes encompasses the most 

morphologically diverse ordinal assemblage of the Ostariophysan fishes (Vari 1998). 

Paralleling the morphological diversity of characiforms is their notable species-level 

diversity (Nelson 2006). Such morphological traits have yielded, and will continue to 

yield a trove of valuable information pertinent to phylogenetic questions at all levels 

within the order (Vari 1998). The Characins belong to a large family of freshwater 

tropical fishes with roughly eight hundred species recognizable by their adipose fin and 

distinctive teeth in their jaws (Moyle 1995). However, the recent research throws doubts 

about the monophyly of the taxon (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). The conflicts 

between cladistics and traditional or phenetic “placement” of various taxa in the 

Characidae demonstrate that at this time we know little about the relationships of 

putative characid subgroups with one another or with other characiform groups. In 

consequence, eighty eight Characiformes genera were listed as Incertae Sedis including 

399 Characidae specimens taxonomically poorly known and possibly belonging to 

genera not considered monophyletic (Lima et al. 2003). These mostly small fishes are 

abundant in rivers and other aquatic habitats throughout the Neotropical region 

including the highly speciose Astyanax Baird &amp;amp; Girard (1854) and Oligosarcus Günther 

(1864) genera. 

 

Genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus 

 

Astyanax and Oligosarcus species inhabit heterogeneous environments, as a 

result of the highly complex Neotropical hydrographic history, which favoured several 

tectonic processes that resulted in vicariant and dispersal events (Lundberg et al. 1998; 

Ribeiro 2003). Some lineages could be split, undergo the process of speciation and 

differentiation between them and later, through random vicariant events, they could be 

brought together again, in secondary contact.

As a dominant freshwater fish genus of South America, Astyanax is found from 

Patagonia to the United States, and on both slopes of the Cordilleras. Most of its species 

are popularly known as “lambaris” or, in the aquarium trade, as “tetras”. This genus was 

described by Baird and Girard (1854), in Baird (1859), honouring Astyanax, the son of 

Hector and considered Astyanax argentatus from riverine streams of Texas as species 

type. Currently, A. argentatus is considered senior synonym to Astyanax mexicanus (De 

Filippi, 1853). This genus of tetras is also one of the most studied among Characidae, 

with at least 86 known species (Lima et al. 2003). Recently, more than 20 new species 

have been described (e.g. Bertaco and Garutti 2007; Bertaco and Lucena 2006; 

Garavello and Sampaio 2010; Haluch and Abilhoa 2005; Melo and Buckup 2006 among 

others). The complete diagnosis of the genus Astyanax proposed by Baird and Girard 

(1854) and followed by Eigenmann (1921) takes into account a combination of 

morphological characters, where the most important are: small size, compressed body 

more or less elongate, rarely reaching a length of 150 mm without ectopterygoid and 

canine teeth, two rows of pre-maxillary teeth, five teeth in the inner pre-maxillary 

series, complete lateral line, presence of adipose fin and naked caudal fin. Unfortunately 

those characters are not diagnostic for Astyanax but widespread among all Characidae 

genera, suggesting the polyphyletic condition of this genus (Weitzman and Malabarba 

1998). The complex evolutionary history of Astyanax is closely linked to its headwater 

behaviour. Some geographically isolated fish populations restricted to headwaters of 

some tributaries have been identified all over the large tropical riverine systems and 

remain as separated assemblages by physical, chemical or biotic barriers which may 

lead to several evolutionary pathways within the same hydrographic system (Lowe-

McConnell 1969). Doubtfully, all these specimens had the same evolutionary pathways 

to the common ancestry. It seems more plausible instead, that their body shape is be the 

result of convergent evolution, or in other words, the body shape similarity is a 

homoplasy. 

Another important Characidae genus is Oligosarcus which is much less 

specious, with only 19 valid species (Menezes 1987; Menezes and Ribeiro 2010; 

Ribeiro 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2007).Their South American endemic species are found in 

the Parana-Paraguay basin and in coastal streams of eastern and southern Brazil, 

Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina (Lima et al. 2003). The Oligosarcus species are 

popularly known in Portuguese South America as “bocarras” or “cachorras” and in 



 

4 

 

Spanish South America as “dientudos”. Günther (1864) considered Oligosarcus 

argenteus from the Velhas River Basin as type species for the genus, which was 

diagnosed, among other characters by having: head and body compressed of moderate 

size, oblong and covered with scales; lateral line complete; teeth conical, in a single 

series in the intermaxillary (pre-maxillary), maxillary, mandible (dentary) and on the 

palatine bones; presence of canine teeth in the premaxillary and mandible. The 

phylogenetic condition of Oligosarcus inside Characifomes has been subject to debate 

since its description. In a first moment Oligosarcus, Paroligosaracus and 

Acestrorhynchus genera were clustered together inside the tribe Acestrorhynchini, 

outside the family Characidae but in the family Acestrorhynchidae (Menezes 1969). 

Oligosarcus was placed as the sister taxon of Paroligosarcus pintoi which is 

characterized by distinct teeth morphology with tri- and penta-cuspid teeth on the 

anterior portion of the dentary. Such condition was considered plesiomorphic since all 

Oligosarcus and Acestrorhynchus species have conical or canine teeth at the anterior 

dentary series. However, subsequent osteological data changed Paroligosarcus genus 

status and placed P. pintoi inside Oligosarcus, now recognized as O. pintoi (Menezes 

and Géry 1983). 

The osteological review made by Menezes and Géry (1983) also revealed that 

Acestrorhynchini could not be considered a monophyletic taxa because both 

Acestrorhyncus and Oligosarcus have several particular derived characters. A 

subsequent revision analysis made by Buckup (1991) proposed the separation of the 

genus Oligosarcus from Acestrorhinchini and its inclusion in the subfamily 

Tetragonopterinae (Characidae) because of the absence of the supraorbital bone. Inside 

Tetragonopterinae, Oligosarcus should also be closely related to Astyanax. The genus 

Oligosarcus has strong evidences suggesting monophyletic condition, such as the 

presence of tricuspid teeth along most of the ectopterygoid length (Ribeiro et al. 2007). 

Even so, Oligosarcus was also included in Incertae Sedis (Lima et al. 2003) due to its 

unknown phylogenetic relationships with the other Characidae. 

Despite the high morphological difference between those two genera, recent 

phylogenetic studies place them together as sister groups (Ortí and Meyer 1997; Castro 

et al. 2004). Moreover, morphological analysis (e.g. Lucena 1993), and molecular 

analysis (Calcagnotto et al. 2005; Javonillo et al. 2010) suggest that Astyanax is 



 

5 

 

paraphyletic. Javonillo et al. (2010) also include Oligosarcus within “Astyanax”. The 

relationship of both genera with the other groups in Characidae remains unclear (Hattori 

et al. 2007). These studies do not include all possible mechanisms that could be 

responsible for this confusing relationship between the two genera. 

 

Fish Cytogenetics and Related Concepts 

 

Cytogenetics can be defined as the study of the normal or abnormal chromosome 

set and their genetic properties (Griffiths et al. 2004). However the comprehension of 

the mechanisms of genetic changes between chromosomes can never be understood 

without the cytological point of view of the chromosome set. Chromosomes are part of 

living cells and therefore, part of their mechanical basic principles of growing, 

replicating and dying. As genetic structures each chromosome contains a fragment of 

the code of life and is a keystone on the heritage process. As cytological structures they 

obey to all cell rules of mitosis and the even more dramatic meiosis. 

Usually, each animal and plant species accounts with its specific chromosome 

set – the karyotype. However a single karyotype, as the number of chromosomes and 

their specific morphology, may be apparently present in another species. Therefore, 

objective karyological characterization of each species requires several specific 

chromosome markers obtained by banding patterns and in situ hybridization. There are 

also cases in which a species or a population cannot be characterized by one single 

karyotype but several variations, called cytotypes. When those variations are numerical, 

they are result of mechanical complications during cell divisions or due to the presence 

of supernumerary chromosomes, also called B chromosomes. When the variation is 

related to the morphology of distinct chromosomes, they could be the result of specific 

chromosomal rearrangements. All new rearrangements require the specimens undergo a 

heterozygous condition, which generates cytological polymorphisms. There is a strong 

evolutionary importance on those polymorphisms. Commonly they are related to 

reproductive disorders resultant of meiotic disturbances.  



 

6 

 

The chromosomal heterozygozity condition and its role in the speciation process 

have been largely discussed in the cytogenetics literature. Ernst Mayr considered such 

rearrangements as simply a post-speciation afterthought (Kearney and Hewitt 2009). 

White (1978), however argued that if this were so, we would expect to frequently 

encounter the situation where a „young? species or semi-species had different 

karyotypes in different parts of its range, without being associated with any genetic 

isolation (and this is definitely not the case). Its stasipatric model also proposes that the 

heterozygote condition is so deleterious that different mechanisms developed to balance 

the polymorphisms may lead to speciation (Spirito 1998). King (1993) suggests also 

that this homozygous advantage is considered unimportant since several species 

developed non-Mendelian modes of segregate two chromosome types in the 

heterokaryotype. At present times, several studies suggests that those heterokaryotypes 

may be naturally fixed or not (Barton 2001; Navarro and Barton 2003). What will 

decide their fate inside a natural population, the balance between native chromosomes 

and rearranged chromosomes, shall be their selective value to the natural selection 

(Kawakami et al. 2011).  

Because of their sheer numbers and old age as a group, fish are particularly 

informative for genetic, cytogenetic and evolutionary studies. The large amount of 

cytogenetic data already obtained for fishes has been useful for improving the 

phylogenetic comprehension of the taxon. Such cytogenetic data pointed the existence 

of large variability on fish diploid number, ranging from a low extreme value of 2n=16 

in the cyprinodontid, Nothobranchius rachovii, to a high of 2n=168 in the 

petromyzontiform lamprey, Petromyzon marinus (Hoar 1979). Interestingly, the diploid 

number 2n=48 chromosomes can be found throughout several Teleostei (Denton 1973) 

leading to the suggestion that this karyotype configuration may represent the ancestral 

chromosome complement of all vertebrates (Ohno et al. 1968). In Characiformes the 

diploid numbers vary from 2n = 22 to 2n = 102 (Porto et al. 1992) but the great 

majority, however has chromosome numbers between 2n=40 and 2n=60 (Klinkhardt et 

al. 1995). The genus Astyanax is characterized by remarkable karyotypic diversity 

(Pazza and Kavalco 2007), including the occurrence of different diploid numbers among 

individuals from allopatric populations pertaining to the same nominal species 

(Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991). Astyanax species also have their diploid numbers, 

ranging from 2n=36 in A. schubarti Britski (1964) to 2n=50 chromosomes (Arefjev 



 

7 

 

1990; Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991; Morelli et al. 1983; Pazza and Kavalco 2007; 

Oliveira et al 1988; Portela et al. 1988 and others). However, all Oligosarcus species 

studied cytogenetically have 2n=50 chromosomes (Kavalco et al. 2005) differing only 

on the morphology of their chromosomes.  

The ancestral karyotype within the genus Astyanax was likely composed of 

2n=50 chromosomes (Pazza and Kavalco 2007) with a large metacentric chromosome 

pair in the complement (Scheel 1972). However, the huge chromosome variability, both 

inter and intra-populational, among Astyanax species suggests the existence for at least 

three groups, also called “species complexes” (Moreira-Filho and Bertollo 1991; 

Fernandes and Martins-Santos 2004). This expression “species-complex” refers to cases 

where two or more species are difficult to define because of their complex patterns of 

variation (Nelson 2006). When levels of variation are studied using cytogenetic tools, it 

is common to observe cryptic species instead of species complexes in Neotropical, 

fishes, since remarkable differences in chromosomes usually imply unviable breeding 

(Kavalco et al. 2009). 

Generally, fish chromosomes are smaller in size than chromosomes in most 

vertebrates. The length of the average fish chromosome is between 2 and 5 µm. Many 

species possess numerous small chromosomes of 2µm or less, but which are nonetheless 

easily seen using the light microscope. Very large chromosomes of 15-30µm in length, 

such as those in the lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa (Ohno et al. 1968) are rare. On the 

other hand, extremely small chromosomes, the so called microchromosomes, were also 

reported in primitive species (Ohno et al. 1969). These authors also suggest that 

although microchromosomes could have arisen independently at the reptilian stage of 

vertebrate evolution, their presence in these relict fishes imply that microchromosomes 

were already present in ancestral fish.  

Each pair of homologous chromosome is assumed to differ genetically from all 

other chromosome pairs in the same cell. Manifestations of some of these differences 

comprise the morphological “phenotype” or karyotype and include differences between 

chromosome pairs in relative size, shape, and centromere position. Sturtevant wrote in 

1925 that for a geneticist, many of the comparisons between karyotypes from different 

species would seem of little significance, because to him (geneticist) it is not the shape 

and size of chromosomes which are important, but the genes contained in them. Such 



 

8 

 

“gene master importance” view was later abandoned when a better comprehension of 

the nature of chromosomes became available. One of these findings was the discovery 

of the position effect, when the same gene may have different functions or activities 

when placed in different places of the same chromosome. Another relevant aspect was 

the existence of the crossing over mechanism in spreading genetic variability produced 

by each individual throughout the population. As a result of a long history, karyotypic 

differences among species or taxa are routinely used to determine phenetic similarities 

and to infer phylogenetic relationships (Gold 1979). 

Sporadic events of polyploidy in natural populations resulting in natural 

triploidy have been detected in a considerable number of specimens from unrelated 

species in genus Astyanax. Out of nine cases of natural triploidy reported for tropical 

fish, five occurred in species of this genus (Almeida-Toledo et al. 2000). The higher 

incidence of triploidy in Astyanax may be due to the diversified environments in which 

these fish live, with greater exposure to abrupt changes in temperature (Fauaz et al. 

1994). These recurrent triploids are probably derived from the fertilization of unreduced 

egg cells, possibly originating from thermal shocks that may have occurred during 

fertilization thus disturbing the second meiotic division (Almeida-Toledo et al. 2000).  

In fish cytogenetics the chromosomes usually are arranged following the 

nomenclature proposed by Levan et al. (1964). This nomenclature is based on the 

position of the centromere on the chromosome and four morphological chromosome 

categories have been erected: metacentric (m), submetacentric (sm), subtelocentric (st) 

and telocentric (t). There are another two categories almost never used on cytogenetic 

studies: metacentric (M), when the centromere is positioned exactly on the middle of 

the chromosome suggesting symmetry; and telocentric (T), when the chromosome has 

only one arm. There is a great discussion about the true nature of the so called 

telocentric (T) and its arm absence. White (1954), affirms that telocentric chromosomes 

with a truly terminal centromere do not occur naturally, they could be the result of 

poorly fixed materials that lead the small arm to merge with the larger one. In 

consequence, he coined the term “acrocentric” to avoid confusion with the term 

“telocentric” where acrocentric chromosomes should be those chromosomes with the 

terminal centromere followed by a small arm. In other words, acrocentric chromosomes 

are the same of the telocentric (t) chromosomes from Levan et al. (1964). However, 



 

9 

 

Levan et al. (1964) proposed this classification “based on morphologic observations 

rather than theoretical hypothesis” and so, “chromosomes in which no second arm can 

be seen should be designed telocentric, until evidence to the contrary may come 

forward”. The current refinement of cytogenetic techniques and the use of high quality 

equipment for obtaining chromosome pictures have made it possible to see small arms 

that where invisible in the past. Thus, the correct classification of one species? 

chromosomes should incorporate the cytogenetic theory of the chromosome structure: 

all stable eukaryote chromosomes have at least, two telomeres and one centromere.  

The importance of the chromosomal telomeric region is paramount. Since the 

decade of 30?s, Muller stated that the loss of this region would lead to the fusion of the 

broken chromatid to another (Muller 1932). Furtheremore, he suggested that 

chromosomes with natural ends are capable of indefinite survival in the course of 

successive cell divisions, while the ones with broken ends are not (Muller and 

Herskowitz 1954). To Muller, the ends of the natural chromosome ends (which he 

called telomeres) are self-perpetuating structures that are unable to persist on an 

interstitial position in the chromosome. 

Another fundamental chromosome structure, the centromere, is a region that 

enables the accurate partition of newly replicated sister chromatids between daughter 

cells during mitosis and meiosis. Although the functional role of the centromeres is 

most evident at metaphase and anaphase they are permanent as autonomous segments of 

chromosomes which can be seen at other stages of the cycle in suitable material (White 

1954). The centromere holds the sister chromatids together and through its centromere 

DNA-protein complex, known as the kinetochore, binds to spindle microtubules 

bringing accurate chromosome movements (Dobie et al. 1999). In addition, centromeres 

regulate the progression of cell cycle and are critical in sensing completion of 

metaphase. They also trigger the onset of anaphase (Nasmyth 2002). The satellite DNA 

that surrounds the centromere structure is usually A-T rich but adenines or timines are 

not randomly distributed within the sequence. The periodic distribution of A-T tracts 

normally induces curvature of the DNA helix axis and the formation of tertiary 

structures to form a super helix (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Such a structure is thought to be 

important for the tight packing of DNA and proteins in heterochromatin (Ugarkovic 

2009). 



 

10 

 

The remarkable importance of both centromere and telomeres on chromosome 

structure and dynamics is clear, and seems completely unlikely that they can occupy the 

very same place on the chromatin. The idea of having telocentric chromosomes (T) 

where the centromere is placed at the telomeric end of the chromosome cannot prevail. 

With few exceptions, all chromosomes have a centromere and two arms with telomeres 

on their edges. This basic concept has a key role on fish phylogeny by means of 

cytogenetic data since different karyotypes are compared taking into account their 

Fundamental Number (FN). Matthey (1945) used the term nombre fondamental (N.F.) 

to indicate the number of major chromosome arms in a species, counting each 

metacentric as two arms and each telocentric as one. This concept must be carefully 

used as a proportion of the telocentric chromosomes among the other chromosomes of 

the karyotype, where each telocentric has the value (1) and the other kinds of 

chromosomes has the value (2). Several citations mentioning “bi-armed” and “one-

armed” chromosomes can be found on fish cytogenetical literature and they should be 

avoided. It must be stated that, in natural conditions, all chromosomes are “bi-armed”. 

 

Phenotypic Plasticity and Heterochrony 

 

The heterogeneous environments inhabited by Astyanax and Oligosarcus 

specimens may be closely connected to the huge morphological variation found among 

different specimens of each genus. High degrees of speciation itself may be an 

important consequence to these peculiar Neotropical fresh waters. Phenotypic plasticity 

is rarely mentioned in the literature even though it plays a major role in the diversity of 

the morphs (Romero and Green 2005). The array of phenotypes developed by a 

genotype over an array of environments is genetically variable and its capacity for 

plasticity is therefore subject to natural selection (Pigliucci 2001). Those individuals 

with a heritable higher capacity to express specific adaptive traits under appropriate 

conditions can be expected to be favoured by natural selection. Phenotypic plasticity 

provides reproductive advantage over genetically fixed phenotypes because 

environmentally induced phenotypes have higher probabilities of fitting to prevailing 

environmental conditions than genetically fixed ones (Whiteman 1994). Perhaps the 



 

11 

 

most common “mechanism” for developmental plasticity is heterochrony. The term was 

coined by Haeckel in 1875 and indicates a variety of alterations in the rate or timing of 

developmental events, resulting in an array of peramorphic (overdeveloped) or 

paedomorphic (juvenilized) forms of descendants (Gould 1977). There is still some 

arguing on the heterochrony definition and West-Eberhard (2003) suggested that it is 

not a “mechanism” of evolution and like duplication, deletion and reversion; it should 

describe a kind of variation that has become established during a cross-generational 

transition, a change in the phenotypic composition of a population or species. In other 

words, heterochrony should not be interpreted as a cause of such changes. 

Notwithstanding, the genetic variation responsible for these “shifts” is poorly 

understood yet, the heterochronic shift concept has been useful in trying to understand 

how morphological differences between homogeneous taxa could have originated 

(Schichnes and Freeling 1998). Goldschmidt (1938; 1952) proposed that all mutations 

produce a change in some developmental step which occurs at a definite time and stage 

of development as well as in a definite region of the embryo. This author also suggested 

that chromosomal rearrangements remain as an important process able to generate 

hypothetical macromutations that may cause large-scale evolutionary changes in a 

“saltational” way. Later, Fink (1982) emphasized the necessity of phylogenies to 

polarize directions of heterochronic change between species. There are currently three 

characteristics of the development of organs and organisms which are subject to 

heterochronic change: onset, rate and/or offset, and they embrace the essential 

components of any change in development: growth, allometry, scaling and functional 

adaptation. It is important to state that when invoking heterochrony it is critical to 

demonstrate that one or other of onset, rate and offset has been altered in a descendent 

relative to the condition in an ancestor (Hall 1999). Heterochrony is a valuable concept 

because it links development and evolution in fairly understandable ways and therefore, 

its application as the main explanation for so much evolutionary change must be made 

carefully since it seems unlikely that this process is a predominant mode of evolutionary 

change (Thomson 1988). The genetic mechanisms of heterochrony are not well 

understood yet however, it seems that they are more connected to genetic expression 

than to the presence or absence of specific genes. An increasing number of papers have 

shown how shifts in the relative timing of onset or offset of particular genes – genetic 

heterochrony - may produce significant phenotypic change (e.g. Smith 2003). This link 



 

12 

 

of molecular genetics with the classical heterochrony mystery is providing a clear bound 

between microevolutionary processes and macroevolutionary changes. The 

paedomorphic features in fish are commonly referred to as reductive and considered to 

be due to the loss of terminal stages in the developmental sequence (Weitzman and Vari 

1988). Miniaturization of the body is commonly reported among different vertebrate 

groups. The phenomenon of miniaturization is a phylogenetic statement, implying that 

the group under consideration evolved from a larger ancestor. The body size is among 

the most important determinants of species function and ecological role. However, the 

broad significance of miniaturization for organismal biology and evolution, including its 

high frequency among major groups of animals, has been largely unappreciated 

(Hanken and Wake 1993). Miniaturization involves not only small body per se, but also 

the consequent and often dramatic effects of extreme size reduction on anatomy, 

physiology, ecology, life history and behaviour (Peters 1986). There are some costs and 

also some compensation on size decrease. In freshwater fishes, a standard length of 25-

26 mm has been used as the maximum size for miniature species (Weitzman and Vari 

1988) and this represents one-fourth to one-fifth the average size of living teleosts 

(Helfman 2009). At least 85 species of South American freshwater fishes are regarded 

as miniature, representing 5 orders, 11 families and 40 genera (Weitzman and Vari 

1988). The reduced and simplified adult morphology that characterizes many 

miniaturized taxa often bears a strong resemblance to sub-adult or even embryonic 

stages of larger close relatives. This resemblance typically is the primary evidence used 

to define the morphology of many miniaturized species as paedomorphic and as having 

evolved via precocious truncation of the ancestral developmental program (Gould 

1977). The rates of morphological variability are also connected to the body size 

decrease and novel morphological features are readily tied to it since the novelty may 

lie, in part, on the effect of size reduction in a morphogenetic way (Hanken 1985). 

Novelty associated with miniaturization may be responsible for distinctiveness in newly 

established clades and can be reinforced by the parallel or convergent evolution of 

similar, if not identical, modifications in disparate lineages that have evolved small size 

(Hanken and Wake, 1993). The genus Astyanax is characterized by high phenotypic 

plasticity and a capacity to adapt to diverse habitats (Strecker et al. 2003). There are 

clear evidences of relatively fast adaptations of these fish to new habitats and 

environments, with ecological specialization and morphological differentiation. The 



 

13 

 

commonest adaptation is related to the body shape and have been demonstrated that 

populations inhabiting fast-water streams usually have elongated body shapes (Haluch 

and Abilhoa 2005). Considerable attention has been given to the evolution of 

developmental mechanisms and adaptation to cave environments (Protas et al. 2007). 

Cahn (1958) carried out the first detailed comparative analysis of eye development in 

Astyanax surface fish and cavefish showing, by means of histological data, that embryos 

of both populations actually develop a primordial eye, which gradually disappear during 

larval stage. Her work has been confirmed several times (Behrens et al. 1997; Jeffery et 

al. 2003). The cavefish eye actually develops normally for a considerable length of time 

before finally disappearing due to failure to keep up with the overall body growth 

(Jeffery 2005) what indicates a clear ontogenetic misfit between the eye and the body 

development. The epigean and the hypogean species also differ on their feeding 

apparatus: the hypogean species has larger jaws with 3-4 teeth in the maxillary bone 

whereas the epigean one has only 1-2 teeth on that bone. Jaw modifications are 

accompanied by larger maxillary bones which ossify earlier during cavefish 

development, an example of heterochrony. These modifications have converged in 

different cavefish populations and are likely to be under the influence of strong selective 

pressure (Jeffery 2001). 

In fact heterochrony and homoplasy interconnect in the case of paedomorphic 

parallelism, in which related clades in essence back down (in a phylogenetic sense). 

Therefore, the morphological similitude between different phylogenetic groups of 

Neotropical Characidae should be analysed carefully by means of plasticity and 

heterochrony morphological concepts since these fish are grouped by their 

morphological plesiomorphies and questioned by their molecular divergences.  

 

Hybridism 

 

The mechanisms responsible for generating the enormous biological diversity 

have received paramount attention from naturalists. Among them, the natural process of 

hybridization has been studied by men since earlier ages. Aristotle himself studied cases 

of hybridism among dogs and foxes and partridge and common chicken. He had 



 

14 

 

difficult to explain, however, the sterility of the mule. For him, hybrids do not 

necessarily truly breed – after several generations of interbreeding, they supposed to 

eventually revert to the female appearance, just as seeds of plants come to vary 

according to the soil on which they grow (Anton and Preus 1992). Hybridism is a major 

asset to all works that intend to understand what a species is, because a single hybrid 

specimen represents the living proof of the breakage of main barriers that keep different 

species apart. Owing to the gradualness of the speciation process one should find in 

nature, populations that are on the way to becoming separate species, but have not yet 

quite completed the process. Such "semi-species" are indeed found (Mayr 1999). The 

“idea of species” is a major reference framework for virtually all subfields of biology 

sciences, mainly due to its importance in systematics (Queiroz 2005). Related to that 

relevance, hybridism occupies a central position to those who try to unveil the nature of 

the species concept. As a consequence, the definition of hybridization is as difficult as 

the definition of species. One of the striking phenomena of recently formed hybrid 

populations is their tremendous variation. Both parental types, as well as all the possible 

recombinations of the parental characters, may be found in the same effective breeding 

population (Mayr 1999). The difficulty of delimiting the term “hybridization” against 

the various forms of intraspecific interbreeding have been warned by Mayr (1999) who 

suggested that the use of this term is undoubtedly justified only if individuals of 

different families, genera or “good species” interbreed. Hybrids differ from individuals 

of the parental species not only in morphology but usually also in fertility and viability 

(heterosis). Zoologists have tended to see hybridization as a problem for taxonomy: 

should populations that remain distinct despite genetic exchange be considered 

members of the same species (Barton 2001)? Even those who developed the biological 

species concept (Dobzhansky 1953; Mayr 1966) regarded gene flow through animal 

hybrid populations as ineffective; hybrid zones were seen as being either transient, with 

natural selection reinforcing mating preferences to give fully isolated species, or if 

stable, merely as obstacles to further divergence. Most hybrids present problems to 

produce the normal number of viable gametes, a biological response to hybridism called 

“hybrid sterility”. Sterility may range from slight to complete and it is not necessarily 

correlated with a reduction in viability (Mayr 1966). The complex problem that 

Aristotle firstly found with the mule sterility raised several concerns about the main 

causative reasons for hybrid sterility. A fundamental discovery concerning hybrid 



 

15 

 

sterility was made by Federly (1913) who suggested that the chromosomes usually fail 

to form bivalents at meiosis in sterile and semi-sterile hybrids in consequence of several 

abnormalities observed on their spermatocytes. This link between abnormalities in 

spermatocytes and hybrid sterility led Dobzhansky and Beadle (1936) perform an 

elegant experiment transplanting larvae testes between hybrids of Drosophila and pure 

species. They confirmed that the sterility is connected to the hybrid spermatogenesis 

since the gonads of the pure species develop and work normally on hybrid specimens. 

The key role of hybrid sterility led Theodosius Dobzhansky (1953) to pioneer the 

genetic study of speciation, by mapping its main responsible genetic factors. He also 

created the view that speciation represents the transformation of within-population 

variation into between-taxa differences through the evolution of inherent reproductive 

isolating barriers. Indeed, chromosomal incompatibilities are strongly connected to 

hybrid sterility however, Bateson (1909), Dobzhansky (1936) and Muller (1940; 1942) 

independently discovered that the main reasons for those incompatibilities, even among 

species with similar karyotypes, are the epistatic deleterious interactions between 

different sets of complementary genes. Hybridization, therefore, indicates relationship, 

but it should be stated emphatically, that the degree of sterility observed in the hybrids 

does not indicate the degree of relationship (Mayr 1999). 

Charles Darwin himself recognized that cross-fertilization results, in many 

situations, in higher biological vigour than crosses between inbred specimens within the 

same species (Gowen 1952). The term heterosis, or hybrid vigour, is used to 

characterize the increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. In 

other words, it is the occurrence of a genetically superior offspring from the 

combination of distinct parental genes. The heterosis phenomenon is also the opposite 

of the inbreeding depression caused by endogamy (Falconer 1987). Actually, the only 

frame of reference which makes the concept of heterosis meaningful is the greater 

fitness or adaptive value of the progeny compared with that of the parents (Dobzhansky 

1949). However, there is an open question about how this combination can actually 

produce an increase in the fitness of the heterozygote, as compared to both 

homozygotes, since the characters favoured by natural selection are the result of several 

genes in heterozygous condition (Buzzati-Traverso 1952). The genetic mechanisms 

which produce heterosis are different in each case. Since most mutations arising in any 

given species are deleterious, and since in outbred species, deleterious dominant 



 

16 

 

mutants are eliminated by selection more rapidly than recessive ones; the populations 

accumulate stores of concealed variability which consist mainly of deleterious recessive 

variants (Dobzhansky 1949). Taking this idea into account two theories, which are 

competing but not mutually exclusive, try to explain heterosis: the dominance 

hypothesis suggests that the hybrid vigour is a consequence of interactions between 

dominant favourable genes. Therefore, the heterozygosis condition is not essential for 

heterosis (Cruz 2005; Davenport 1908). On the other hand, the overdominance 

hypothesis suggests that the vigour originates from certain combinations of alleles, 

attributing heterosis to the heterozygosis (Shull 1908). It seems that to the 

comprehension of species evolution and speciation, the overdominance hypothesis 

remains more plausible. Dobzhansky (1949) also suggests that heterosis is caused by the 

specific interaction effects of gene complexes which have emerged in the process of 

evolution under a controlling influence of natural selection. Therefore, the likely 

alternative to explain the increased vigour of hybrids between natural populations is due 

to certain gene loci, where the heterozygote is superior to either homozygote, and due to 

gene interactions (Crow 1948). Among natural populations, fitness varies smoothly with 

genotype because of the interaction of many genes with large numbers of alleles with 

small effect (Barton 2001). The vast genetic database obtained from Drosophila strains 

also seems to corroborate the overdominance hypothesis (Dobzhansky 1950; Muller and 

Falk 1961). Studying natural populations of Drosophila in Central America, 

Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1955) found in Honduras a D. tropicalis population with 

high proportions of heterozygotes for a specific inversion in the second chromosome 

that lead the homozygous progeny to death in egg or larval stages on every generation. 

However, even sacrificing about one-half of its zygotes in every generation, the fitness 

of the heterotic heterozygotes is so high that the population is considered by the authors 

a “flourishing one”. Heterosis is in short, a form of evolutionary adaptation, 

characteristic of sexually reproducing and cross-fertilizing species: heterosis is, 

therefore, a result of natural selection (Dobzhansky 1949; 1953). 

At least four kinds of factors (ecological, ethological, mechanical and genetic) 

participate in preventing the production of hybrid individuals between sympatric 

species. The mere fact that such hybrids occur indicates that some of the isolating 

mechanisms may broke down (Mayr 1999). An important outcome of hybridization is 

the introgression of the gene pool of one taxon (eg. species) into another taxon. When 



 

17 

 

the hybridization involves a rare taxon, Arnold (1997) suggests three important results: 

increase of its fitness; addition of genetic variation; and the construction of a reservoir 

of parental-like genotypes/phenotypes. Barton (2001) suggests that even if those 

barriers get broken the hybrid fitness frequently drops when compared to their parents?. 

However, the increase in variability still remains the key. Actually few hybrid 

genotypes might be fitter than the parental ones because only the hybrid specimens have 

some degree of gene interaction. It is unlikely that the fittest possible gene combination 

would occur in the pure lineage of either parental species (Turelli et al. 2001). If hybrids 

are capable to survive the competition with their parents, with all their problems, they 

must be able to hit new adaptive combinations of genes (Mallet 2007). The 

introgression event is considered a spontaneous consequence of hybridization by Mallet 

(2005) who suggests that the first (F1) hybrid should be the most difficult to produce 

because they are result of a singular event: closely related and diverging species living 

in sympatry; once they are produced the backcrossing to one of the parental lineage is 

much more straightforward. Barton (2001) also shares this point of view and says that if 

fertile F1 hybrids are produced these will almost certainly backcross to one or other 

parental genotype because of their variability. The possibility of introgression, or not, 

were taken into account by Allendorf et al. (2001) who categorized hybridization in six 

distinct types whereas the last three types are the result of anthropogenic work: 1) 

natural hybrid taxon; 2) natural introgression; 3) natural hybrid zone; 4) hybridization 

without introgression (F1 sterile); 5) widespread introgression (recent hybridization 

geographically restricted); 6) complete admixture (when conservation actions fail and 

all populations become hybrid swarms). 

It is sometimes argued that intraspecific hybridization should not be a concern 

because populations of the same species generally share alleles so that new genetic 

types that might cause outbreeding depression will not be created by introgression 

(Keenan 2000). Moreover, it was suggested that the anthropogenic introduction of new 

genetic variation into a population, by a process called supplementation, could generally 

be beneficial and provide genetic variation so that natural selection can increase the 

fitness of populations (Cuenco et al. 1993). This seems absurd since each population has 

its own and characteristic gene pool. By introducing alien genes in a threatened 

population the true result shall be the complete extinction of the original population and 

the rise of a new population but with different gene pool. The impact of introduced 



 

18 

 

species or lineages is widely known by their negative effects on the natural species by 

competing with or preying on them or destroying their habitat (Gurevitch &amp;amp; Padilla 

2004). However the extinction by hybridization and introgression with the introduced 

species on native fauna is a serious menace too (Allendorf et al. 2001; Orr 1998; 

Rhymer and Simberloff 1996). Since a hybrid has unusual gene combinations its 

adaptive value, if compared to its parents, is unpredictable. By means of introgression 

and gene exchange two well adapted and natural populations could drastically change 

their gene pools with severe consequences to their fitness (Dowling and Hoeh 1991; 

Dowling et al. 1989), and usually, the introgressant genes predominantly flow from the 

common to rarer species (Allendorf et al. 2001). Introgressive hybridization may have 

been a persistent feature of the adaptive radiation through most of natural history, 

facilitating evolutionary diversification and occasionally affecting both the speed and 

direction of evolution (Grant et al. 2005). However the predatory behaviour of human 

kind makes almost impossible to consider, nowadays, hybridization and introgression as 

pure natural processes. Therefore, it is complicated to distinguish natural and 

anthropogenic hybridization (Allendorf et al. 2001; Dowling and Secor 1997), and this 

is central feature for conservation biology. When this distinction is not achievable, the 

alternative is to either not allow protection of natural hybrids or to protect 

anthropogenic hybrids that could contribute to extinction of parental species and waste 

limited resources available for conservation. The most widely known case relating 

hybridism and environmental biology is that of the problematic red wolf (named Canis 

rufus) which wasted great amounts of preservation resources when, actually, it was not 

a natural species but a hybrid of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) and the coyote (Canis 

latrans) (Wayne &amp;amp; Gittleman 1995). This hybridization event was strongly associated 

with the extensive agricultural cultivation of the southern United States by European 

settlers beginning around 250 years ago (Reich et al. 1999). The hybridism problem is 

so serious among conservationists that several pejorative connotations for introgression 

were published as: “contamination”, “infection”, “genetic deterioration”, “genetic 

pollution”, “genetic aggression” and others (Rhymer and Simberloff 1996). 

Natural hybridization is believed to be more common in fishes than on other 

group of vertebrates (Mayr 1966), and moreover, non-native fish species have been 

introduced extensively worldwide (Smith 1992).The largest fish hybrid database reports 

the existence of at least 3.759 natural and artificial cases of hybridization (Schwartz 



 

19 

 

1972; 1981). This amount, however, should be currently much larger. Several groups of 

fishes from western United States exhibit evidence of past introgression, implicating a 

general causative factor. Ecosystems of this region have gone through dramatic change, 

including considerable tectonic activity and progressive aridification. This process had 

severe impact on aquatic ecosystems, likely producing cycles of isolation and sympatry 

(Dowling and Secor 1997). Man-caused habitat changes in North America have also 

been correlated with hybridization between both previously allopatric and sympatric 

pairs of species and sympatric species that rarely or never hybridize in nature and 

hybridize freely in laboratory conditions (Hubbs 1955). Several characteristics of fish 

species may account for their ease to hybridize: external fertilization, weak ethological 

isolating mechanisms, unequal abundance of the two parental species, competition for 

limited spawning habitat, and susceptibility to secondary contact between recently 

evolved forms (Campton, 1988). The data of Neotropical hybrid fish species is scarce 

and only four cases are known for the family Characidae. The first one is related to the 

blind tetra Astyanax jordani and A. mexicanus (Kullander 1999). Two other cases 

involve fish species from Serrasalmus genus, also called piranhas. In one case the 

cytogenetic data suggested the hybridism between two isolated populations of 

Serrasalmus spilopleura (Cestari and Galetti Jr. 1992). Hybridism in piranhas has also 

been studied by Hubert et al. (2007; 2008) between Serrasalmus compressus and S. 

hollandi in a sympatric population of Madeira River. The fourth case of hybridism was 

documented for two different sympatric populations of Astyanax fasciatus with distinct 

chromosome configuration (Pazza et al. 2006). All four documented cases of hybridism 

among Characidae species involve crossing between close species or different 

populations from a same species and therefore a hybridism between different genera or 

higher taxa have never been discussed. However, it must be stated that hybridization 

may be strongly underestimated when we consider that many pairs of species are only 

weakly diagnosable using morphology (Mallet 2008). The major importance of 

hybridism events to Characidae fish is that the instable phylogenetic situation of the 

species belonging to the Incertae Sedis group may be the result of several horizontal 

transferences among different genera that once lived in sympatry. As the phylogenetic 

investigations of this group suggest absence of monophyly for distinct groups, the event 

of introgression should be taken into account as an explanation when phylogenetic trees 

inferred from different genes are in conflict (Baak and Rieseberg 2007). 



 

20 

 

Final Aspects 

 

 The relationship between the Characidae genus Astyanax and Oligosarcus is 

complex under the scope of phylogenetics and when morphologically intermediary 

specimens are discovered several hypothesis must be raised for the correct 

understanding of the biological processes that made those specimens rise in sympatry. 

Such intermediary characteristics may be the result of random heterochronic variations 

on A. giton or O. argenteus leading to morphologic changes. However, they also may be 

resultant of hybridism between those two sympatric species. Each hypothesis has 

distinct biological implications and phylogenetic impact for the Characidae fish and 

therefore, the conclusion must be carefully taken. The more tools available to unveil this 

mystery, the best explanation for this biological incident is possible to reach. When 

morphology, cytogenetics and molecular biology techniques are combined to detect the 

variability of these morphologically distinct specimens and used to contrast these 

morphological variants with the other sympatric species, the results suggests that the 

hybridism hypothesis is more plausible. However, all knowledge about both hypotheses 

is always necessary for conclusive affirmations about this case that may be able to 

answer several questions about the relationship of the different Characidae groups. The 

results of these techniques and their main conclusions are discussed on the following 

chapter.

Abstract 

 

Within the Neotropical fish fauna, the taxonomically complex family Characidae has 

many species and genera in Incertae Sedis condition. Within this family, the closely related 

genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus are represented by small sized fishes that are an expressive 

proportion of the freshwater biodiversity in many rivers of South America. In the Doce River 

Basin, South-eastern Brazil, 5 characid specimens “toothed morphs” with unusual 

morphology were analysed with morphological, cytogenetic and molecular techniques and 

compared to the sympatric characids Astyanax bimaculatus, Astyanax giton and Oligosarcus 

argenteus. The toothed morphs showed an intermediate position in lateral line scale numbers 

and maxillary teeth number between A. giton and O. argenteus. Cytogenetic analyses 

(Giemsa, NOR, C-banding, fluorochromes and FISH) indicated that all sympatric characids 

were 2n=50, although they differed from each other in many other karyotypic characters. The 

toothed morphs were characterized by high levels of intra and inter-individual chromosomal 

variation including several unpairable chromosomes and tiny chromosomes that were not 

observed either in A. giton or O. argenteus. Two toothed morphs had their cytochrome b 

DNA fragment (475 bp) identical to O. argenteus but one toothed morph had its sequence 

compatible to the A. giton species. However a different picture can be seen at the nuclear 

DNA where all toothed morphs had their ITS1 DNA sequence (1123 bp) similar to O. 

argenteus including the specimen with distinct mtDNA. Moreover, all toothed morphs shared 

more ISSR alleles with A. giton, than to O. argenteus. The data suggested that the toothed 

morphs were hybrids between A. giton and O. argenteus, representing the first evidence for 

spontaneous hybridization between two Neotropical fish genera. The relevance of such 

findings in conservation biology and phylogeny assessment was discussed.

Introduction 

 

The Neotropical freshwater ichthyofauna is remarkably rich and diverse (Schaefer 

1998). The order Characiformes has more than 1600 species in 16 families (Reis et al. 2003) 

including the family Characidae, which include the popular tetras. The Characidae are 

widespread throughout American continent, from south Texas to Patagonia (Eigenmann 

1921), and are very common both in lotic or lentic waters. This family has not been 

diagnosed as a monophyletic group (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). The conflicts between 

cladistic and traditional phenetic approaches in Characidae demonstrate that at this time we 

know little about the relationships of putative characid subgroups with one another or with 

other characiform groups (Weitzman and Malabarba 1998). Such uncertainty led to the 

inclusion of a great number of genera from the Characidae family to the Incertae Sedis 

condition (Lima et al. 2003) including the genera Astyanax and Oligosarcus.  

Macroevolutionary processes may be the historic outcome of microevolutionary 

dynamics (Ridley 2004), a level that is gauged by the patterns of variation in natural 

populations. At the population level, processes such as migration and gene flow (or even 

hybridization) may superimpose to genetic drift and divergence. Horizontal transfer has been 

frequently reported among North American and Old World freshwater fishes (Schwartz 

1972), but there is little information on spontaneous hybridization between Neotropical 

species. A survey in a headwater dam in the Latão Creek, a tributary of the Doce River Basin, 

yielded 5 Astyanax-like fish with numerous maxillary teeth (ca. 8-13) which are hereafter 

referred as the toothed morphs. Lima (1998) collected one single specimen with few similar 

characteristics at Paraiba do Sul river basin. Unfortunately the author only commented the 

similitude of this specimen to Astyanax and Oligosarcus without any discussion of its origin 

and suggested the creation of a new genus for this single specimen. In Sossego?s dam, these 

toothed morphs are sympatric with Astyanax bimaculatus (Linneaus, 1758); Astyanax giton, 

Eigenmann, 1908 and Oligosarcus argenteus, Günther, 1864. These three species are easily 

distinguished morphologically. To determine the biological nature of these “toothed morph” 

fishes, it was conducted a comparative multidisciplinary approach including morphologic, 

cytogenetic, and molecular data, on the toothed morphs and on the other sympatric species. In 

the last decades, the combined application of these independent character sets has allowed to 



 

41 

 

address whether populations or individuals belong to different species or not. Morphological 

characters allow determining the possible uniqueness of the toothed morphs, their similarity 

to any of their sympatric species or, in the case of hybrids, an intermediate condition between 

their putative parental species (Hubbs 1955; Welsh and Cincotta 2004). Cytogenetic data 

have also been quite instrumental to characterize the biological nature of problematic 

specimens, because it is well known that related species have chromosomal differences (King 

1993; White 1978). Finally, uniparental loci, such as mitochondrial DNA are excellent 

markers for characterizing new taxa (reciprocal monophyly) or for detecting genetic 

horizontal transfer events (hybridization). However, under such circunstances nuclear genetic 

markers such as the ITS regions may be more suitable for this kind of investigation since they 

evolve fast but with the effects of the concerted evolution what minimizes the degree of 

intraspecific variation, and make the ITS regions suitable for phylogenetic comparisons 

among closely related taxa (Chow et al. 2006; Presa et al. 2002). Additionaly, rDNA genes 

are recombining, biparental markers, which can reveal recent gene flow and hybridization 

events (Mayer and Soltis 1999, Sang et al. 1995). Moreover, multilocus markers, as ISSR, are 

efficient to determine the similarity of genotypes between species. They are also good 

markers for identifying different sympatric groups characterized by chromosome 

polymorphisms in a given Characidae population (Pazza et al. 2007). The possibility of 

hybridism and introgression between Characidae species may help the phylogenetic 

understanding of this unsolved group of South American freshwater fishes.

Material and Methods 

 

Characterization of the study area and overall proceedings 

 Specimens were collected at a dam in the headwaters of Latão Creek, in the 

Municipality of Coimbra (20°51'24" S, 42°48'10" W) in the state of Minas Gerais (Fig. 1). 

The Latão Creek is a tributary of the Piranga River, within the Doce River Basin. The dam 

was built in 1978 and has approximately 2 ha. A multiple (morphologic, cytogenetic, and 

molecular) approach was used to compare the toothed morph (Fig. 2) to the other sympatric 

species (Table 1): Astyanax bimaculatus (Linnaeus 1758), Astyanax giton Eigenmann, 1908 

and Oligosarcus argenteus Günther, 1864. After the cytogenetic and molecular protocols, all 

specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, transferred to 75% alcohol, and deposited in the 

ichthyological collections of Zoology Museum of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (Minas 

Gearis, Brazil) and PUC-RS (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil).  

 Morphometric protocols. Morphometric measurements were carried out using a 

manual 0.05 mm precision calliper, and characters followed Eigenmann (1921). Sixteen traits 

were taken from each specimen: standard length/head (HEAD), standard length/maximum 

body depth (DEPTH), head/eye (EYE), head/interorbital distance (IO), head/snout 

(SNOUT), free margin of maxillary bone/anterior-posterior length of the pre-maxillary 

(FMM), head without operculum/free maxillary border (PMMB), total dorsal fin rays (D), 

total anal fin rays (A), number of scales between dorsal fin and lateral line (D-LL), number 

of scales on lateral line (LL), number of scales between pelvic fin and lateral line (P-LL), 

teeth on the front pre-maxillary row (TFR), teeth on the inner pre-maxillary row (TIR), teeth 

on the maxillary (TM) and teeth on the dentary bone (DENTARY). Morphometric and 

meristic data were subject to principal component analysis (PCA) by correlation (normalized 

var-covar) data matrix since the variables are measured in different units (morphometrical 

and meristical). The analysis were carried out using the software PAST v. 2.01 (Hammer et 

al. 2010). The jaw bones from A. bimaculatus, A. giton, O. argenteus and the toothed morph 

were also subject to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a LEO SEM model 

1430VP.

 Cytogenetic protocols. Cell division was stimulated in vivo with 2 daily applications 

of Imunovac
®
, a commercially available solution of different kinds of antigens following 

(Molina 2001; Molina et al. 2010). Fish were previously anesthetized with clove oil 

according to Henyey et al. (2002) and somatic metaphases were obtained from kidney cells 

by the “air drying” method of Egozcue (1971) and modified by Bertollo et al. (1978). 

Techniques included Giemsa staining, C-banding according to Sumner (1972) and combined 

with DAPI staining (Swarça et al. 2003); sequential fluorochrome with CMA3/DAPI 

followed Schweizer (1976) and Sola et al. (1992). The Nuclear Organizer Regions (NORs) 

were detected by silver staining method (Howell and Black 1980). Fluorescent in situ 

hybridization (FISH) followed Pinkel et al. (1986) with 18S and 5S probes from Hoplias 

malabaricus (Cioffi et al. 2009) and Leporinus elongatus (Martins and Galetti 1999) 

respectively. Chromosomes were classified in metacentrics (m), submetacentrics (sm), 

subtelocentrics (st) and telocentrics (t) following Levan et al. (1964). Digital images were 

captured on Olympus BX 60 microscope using Q color 3
®
 Olympus software and the 

chromosomes were measured using Image Pro Plus
®
. The chromosomes were assembled in 

karyotypes using Corel Photopaint X4™ and Adobe Photoshop CS2
®
. 

 Molecular protocols The DNA extraction followed Boyce et al. (1989) and was 

conducted on 28 specimens: 10 specimens of Oligosarcus argenteus, 1 specimen of 

Oligosarcus paranensis Menezes and Géry, 1983, 10 specimens of Astyanax giton, 1 

specimen of Astyanax bimaculatus from the Sossego Dam, 1 specimen of Astyanax 

bimaculatus from Tiririca Lake (19°45?S; 42°27?W), and the 5 toothed morphs. For mtDNA 

analysis, a 475 bp fragment of cytochrome b was sequenced, using primers GLU-5 (Table 2) 

(Hillis et al. 1996). Double stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?L reactions containing 10 

?L dNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?L reaction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 500 mM KCl), 2 ?L 

MgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?L of each primer (10 mM), 0.5 ?L (2.5 U) of Taq DNA polymerase 

(Phoneutria), 2 ?L of template DNA (100 ng/?L) and 26.5 ?L of H2O. PCR conditions were 

as follows: 94 °C (2 min), 5 cycles of 94 °C (45 s), 54 °C (45 s), 72 °C (1,5 min), 29 cycles of 

94 °C (45 sec), 58 °C (45 s), 72 °C (1,5 min). PCR products were purified using Qiaquick 

(Qiagen) and were sequenced in Macrogen Corp., South Korea. The sequences were aligned 

using CLUSTAL W as implemented in MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007) and the analysis was 

performed using Neighbour Joining (NJ) (Saitou and Nei 1987). 



 

44 

 

Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS). Nucleotide sequences of a conserved primer pair 

(ITS1 and 5.8S) used to amplify the ITS1 region were obtained from Duke University web 

site (http://www.biology.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab/primers.htm). The forward primer (ITS1) 

was designed to anneal near the 3' end of 18S rDNA, and the reverse primer (5.8S), to anneal 

near the 5' end of 5.8S rDNA (Table 2). The ITS1 sequence was amplified using Taq 

polymerase Phoneutria® with GC buffer which considerably improved amplification over 

standard Taq protocols. Initial denaturation at 96 ºC for 2 min, was followed by 25 cycles of 

amplification (denaturation at 96 ºC for 0-5 min, annealing at 58 ºC for 0-5 min and extension 

at 74 ºC for 1 min) with a final extension at 74 ºC for 10 min. Six specimens of Oligosarcus 

argenteus, five specimens of Astyanax giton and four toothed morphs were subjected to the 

previous protocol. A. bimaculatus was discarded as a possible parental. 

Cloning ITS fragments. The amplification products were purified directly from a 

1,5% agarose gel by using Kit Wizard 
®
 SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (PROMEGA) 

and bounded to Vector pGEM
®
-T Easy Vector System (PROMEGA) following the 

manufactory?s suggestions. The vectors were applied to transform ultracompetent DH5a E. 

coli cells. The transformant clones were selected by alpha-complementation, and the 

recombinant transformant by plasmid extraction through fast colony lysis. The transformant 

clones were selected, multiplied and the recombinant plasmids were extracted and purified by 

the usage of the S.N.A.P. Miniprep Kit from INVITROGEN 
®
, as suggested by the 

manufactory. The purified plasmid was submitted to sequencing by automatic sequencer 

model MegaBACE (GE-Healthcare) with M13 oligonucleotides specific to the utilized 

cloning vector. The partial amplification products were purified with the Enzyme mix Exo-

Sap-IT
®
 (USB corporation) and directly sequenced with the same oligonucleotides used in 

the amplification process. 

Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) protocols. After A. bimaculatus was discarded 

as a putative parental, ISSR amplification was used in the 2 remaining species and the 

toothed morphs, to estimate the nuclear DNA similarity of the toothed morphs. Twelve ISSR 

primers (UBC primer set # 9, Biotechnology Laboratory, University of British Columbia, 

Canada) were assayed in a pilot test on randomly chosen individuals of A. giton and O. 

argenteus and the toothed morphs. Different concentrations of several reaction components 

and annealing temperatures were tested. Three primers produced strong bands and were 

evaluated further for ISSR polymorphism (Table 2). PCR amplifications were carried out in a 



 

45 

 

total volume of 20 µL comprising 20 ng template DNA, 2.0 µL 10X PCR buffer, 2.5 mM 

MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 2% formamide, 0,2 µM primer, 0,75 U Taq DNA polymerase 

(Phoneutria) and ultrapure water. PCR amplification was programmed on MJ Research PT 

100 as follows: a denaturation step at 94 ºC, 45s annealing at 45 ºC -53 ºC, 90s extension at 

72 ºC followed by 7 min extension at 72º C. Amplification products were separated via 

electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) polyacrilamyde gels with 1X TBE buffer at constant voltage 

(100v) for approximately 4-6 hours. Amplified fragments were identified using a 1 kb DNA 

Ladder (Invitrogen). Bands were visualized with silver nitrate. ISSR bands were treated as 

dominant genetic markers and scored as 1 (present) or 0 (absent) binary characters. Only 

polymorphic bands that could be unambiguously scored across all the surveyed individuals 

were considered for further analysis. The resulting data matrix was analysed using TFPGA v. 

1.3 (Miller 1997) for UPGMA, by means of Nei`s (1972) original distance. The analysis was 

used to construct a phenogram representing the genetic distances among each sample.

Results 

 

 Morphological data. Most of the morphological patterns of variation placed the 

toothed morphs in an intermediate position between A.giton and O. argenteus. The method of 

principal components (PCA) is a procedure for finding hypothetical variables (components) 

which account for as much of the variance in multidimensional data as possible (Harper 

1999). These new variables are linear combinations of the original variables. This method 

appears to have useful application to analysis of fish hybrids, partly because it is free of the 

disadvantages of the hybrid indices and discriminant functions (Smith 1973). Astyanax 

bimaculatus, Astyanax giton and Oligosarcus argenteus were characterized by diagnostic 

morphology and meristic patterns (Table 3; Fig. 3). The toothed morphs and the two species 

of Astyanax lacked the ectopterygoid teeth series that characterize O. argenteus. The 

maxillary teeth number and morphology characterized each of the species at the Sossego?s 

Dam: A. bimaculatus lacked such teeth, A. giton were characterized by low numbers (0-3) 

and hexacuspid and pentacuspid teeth, O. argenteus had the highest number (15-26) of 

tricuspid and conic maxillary teeth; and toothed morphs had high numbers (8-13) of 

pentacuspid and tricuspid teeth (Table 4; Fig. 4). Toothed morphs also differed in the number 

of lateral line scales and the dentary tooth number from the other two species (Table 3). 

 

 Cytogenetic data. All three species and the toothed morphs shared the same diploid 

number of 2n=50 chromosomes (Fig. 5). The chromosome morphology, however, was 

characteristic for each species (Table 5). The four toothed morphs showed high levels of 

chromosome variation both within and among individuals (Fig. 6). Unique chromosome 

morphologies were observed, including a large submetacentric and tiny acrocentrics or 

metacentrics. Most of these chromosomes lacked homologues and were placed in a special 

group (Fig. 6; Table 6); a trend that was particularly evident to the toothed morph CT 2214, 

which showed 2n=51 in more than half of the analysed metaphases, suggesting the modal 

diploid number for this specimen was 2n=51 (Table 6). The most stable karyotypic formula 

was observed in the individual CT 1945 and therefore the cytogenetic results of the remaining 

toothed morphs were referred to it (Table 7).  



 

47 

 

Among the three species and the toothed morph, Astyanax bimaculatus showed the 

highest level of karyotypic divergence. Its C-banding/DAPI pattern showed pericentromeric 

heterochromatin in sm and st chromosomes (Fig. 7a), while Giemsa-stained C-banding 

showed heterochromatic blocks at the pericentromeric region of only one pair of 

submetacentric chromosomes (Fig. 7b). Two non-homologous chromosomes (st and t) 

showed silver stained blocks (Fig. 7c-d), and the location of some heterochromatic blocks 

matched the silver-stained regions. These chromosomes also presented CMA3 fluorescence, 

but the subtelocentric chromosome had a marking at its short arm instead of the telomeric 

region of its long arm (Fig. 8a-b). The 5S rDNA FISH probe also showed a mark on the 

telomeric region of the long arm of a telocentric chromosome and also on the telomeric 

region of the small arm of a subtelocentric chromosome. (Fig. 8c). The 18S FISH probe 

hybridized with 10 m, sm and st chromosomes (Fig. 8c). The few pericentromeric marks 

seemed equivalent to the heterochromatin blocks identified using the C-banding technique.  

In A. giton, the C-banding/DAPI showed multiple heterochromatic markings, most of 

them on the small arms of submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes (Fig 7e). A faint 

marking was also found on the centromeric region of the largest metacentric chromosome. 

The C-banding technique showed heterochromatin only on four chromosome pairs including 

a large subtelocentric chromosome showing bitelomeric markings (Fig. 7f). All Giemsa-

stained C-banding matched 18S rDNA fluorescence patterns, although this probe also showed 

additional markings at telomeric portions of the largest metacentric pair (Fig. 8f). The Ag-

stained metaphases showed two different small chromosomes of subtelocentric morphologies 

as NOR bearers (Fig. 7g-h). Also, only one pair of chromosomes was marked with the 5S 

rDNA probe (Fig. 8f). The small difference between the two chromosomes marked with 

silver was not evident with the CMA3 fluorochrome staining (Fig. 8d-e).  

The karyotype of O. argenteus was also characterized by high numbers of telocentric 

chromosomes. The technique of both C-banding and C-banding/DAPI sequential yielded 

similar patterns (Fig. 7i-j). A pair of small subtelocentric chromosomes seemed to carry a 

heterochromatic block on their small arms, and only one chromosome from the largest 

metacentric pair presented heterochromatin block on the distal region of their long arms. The 

nucleolar organizer region was located in the small arm of a pair of medium sized 

subtelocentric chromosomes (Fig. 7k-l). The 5S rDNA cluster was also located on the small 

arm of a pair of subtelocentric chromosomes. (Fig. 8i). All 18S rDNA clusters (Fig. 8i) were 



 

48 

 

associated to CMA3 marks (Fig. 8g-h), except for the heterochromatic block at the distal long 

arm of the larger metacentric chromosome. Also, a pair of large subtelocentric chromosomes 

carried two 18S rDNA clusters in both telomeres, a bitelomeric marking that was not shown 

by CMA3 staining, restricted however to the long arm of one of its homologues and to the 

short arm of its counterpart.  

Finally, for the toothed morphs, the C-banding (Giemsa and DAPI sequential stain) 

showed only faint markings (Fig. 7m-n) on telomeric region of a submetacentric chromosome 

small arm and, also on the interstitial region of the long arm of a single telocentric 

chromosome. Two NOR sites were located on a pair of subtelocentrics (Fig. 7o-p). Only one 

chromosome pair carries the 5S rDNA region as confirmed by the FISH technique (Fig. 8l). 

CMA3 and 18S rDNA FISH coincided for same regions in 4 chromosome pairs (Fig. 8j-k). 

The only exception was the telomeric 18S rDNA cluster on the larger metacentric 

chromosome, which was not evidenced with CMA3. This toothed morph was characterized 

by relatively few subtelocentric chromosomes, a condition shared with O. argenteus but its 

karyotype also included a unique feature: the presence of a large pair of telocentrics, its 19
th

 

chromosome pair that represented roughly two thirds of the first chromosome pair. None of 

other studied species had such a large telocentric chromosome pair. The toothed morphs were 

cytogenetically unique since their karyotypes showed diverse variations (Fig. 6). There were 

also remarkable differences between the banding patterns of these sympatric species and the 

toothed morph specimen (Table 7). 

 

Molecular data. The cytochrome b mtDNA fragment was identical in three of the 

toothed morphs and the sympatric O. argenteus and thus, the Neighbour Joining analysis 

clustered the toothed morph specimens as closely related to the genus Oligosarcus. However, 

the toothed morph CT 2213 clustered with the Astyanax giton branch (Fig. 9). The ITS-1 

fragments showed similar results of the mitochondrial sequence, though the toothed morphs, 

including CT 2213, clustered with the Oligosarcus instead of the Astyanax branch (Fig. 10). 

More than one sequence was obtained for the toothed morph CT 2213 and Astyanax giton CT 

2093 as a result of the multiple genomic ITS sequences extracted from nuclear DNA. In the 

ISSR analysis, ten marker loci were obtained distinguishing A. giton and O. argenteus where 

the toothed morphs remained as mosaics between these two species. The UPGMA 



 

49 

 

phenogram of the ISSR matrix clustered O. argenteus and A. giton in two different groups 

(Fig. 11), while the toothed morphs formed a distinct group within the A. giton group. 

The relationship between the haplotypes of A. giton, O. argenteus and the toothed 

morphs may be related to introgressive hybridization and also to ancestral polymorphism 

(Dobzhansky 1953; Wu et al. 2011). If the observed degree of mtDNA sequence variation 

found among these three Sossego?s groups can also be found among other species from both 

Astyanax and Oligosarcus genera, the pattern of variation should be related to ancestral 

polymorphisms. In order to determine which kind of relationship can be related to the 

mtDNA variation obtained in the sympatric A, giton and O. argenteus specimens, a mtDNA 

comparison including Astyanax bimaculatus and Oligosarcus paranensis species was made 

(Fig. 12). The analysis showed that the toothed morphs clustered with Oligosarcus solitarius 

and Oligosarcus paranensis in a distinct branch of that one of Astyanax giton and Astyanx 

bimaculatus. Therefore, the mtDNA relatedness found among A. giton, O. argenteus and the 

toothed morph should not be associated with commom ancestral polymorphisms.

Discussion 

 

 The PCA pattern indicates the intermediate character of the toothed morphs between 

A. giton and O. argenteus. Besides these general morphological aspects, the morphology of 

the maxillary teeth was also informative. Cusp morphology in toothed morphs included 

tricuspid teeth (typical of O. argenteus) and pentacuspid teeth (characteristic of A. giton). 

Moreover, the toothed morphs showed two rows of pre-maxillary teeth – a trait not shared 

with any known Oligosarcus specimen. Many studies indicate that hybrid fish are 

morphologically intermediate between the parental morphotypes (Hubbs 1955). However, in 

other cases many hybrid characters show a range of patterns of nonadditive inheritance 

(Smith 1992). With respect to some traits, a hybrid may fall well outside the range of parental 

morphological variation. Such traits are said to be heterotic and may result in cases where the 

hybrids exceeds the range of variation exhibited by its parents (positive heterosis) or when 

hybrids fall below the range of parental variation (negative heterosis) (McCarthy 2006). 

Within the hybrid genome, different alleles can interact following two main hypotheses: the 

dominant hypothesis, which has enjoyed long theoretical support, posits that deleterious 

recessive alleles are complemented in hybrids by fitter alleles from the alternate parent, 

generating a possible increase in vigour. In contrast, the overdominance hypothesis attributes 

hybrid vigour to the synergistic interactions of alleles at a heterozygous locus (Baak and 

Rieseberg 2007). Here, success depends on the fixation of favourable new gene combinations 

from the two parental species (Barton 2001). There is no doubt that the combination of two 

different genotypes may result on unique phenotypes not present on the parental species. The 

Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller theory states that the sterility of hybrids is related to the 

epistatic interactions between gene clusters of each parent (Bateson 1909; Dobzhansky 1936; 

1953; and Muller 1940; 1942) and remains as a classic example of how singular 

combinations can be found only in hybrid specimens but not on the parental lineage. Through 

dominance effects, some traits were expressed more similar to A. giton and others to O. 

argenteus (such as absence of palatine teeth). Some traits, on the other hand, showed 

intermediate condition between both putative parental, such as the maxillary teeth. These 

toothed morphs are therefore distinct from the specimen described by Lima (1998) at the 

Paraiba do Sul River basin mainly due to the absence of ectopterygoid teeth and the presence 

of pentacuspid teeth at the maxillary. 



 

51 

 

The cytogenetic data suggested a mixed suite of A. giton and O. argenteus characters 

in the toothed morphs. The toothed morph CT 1945, characterized by a more conservative 

karyotype, had an unusual banding pattern. All banding techniques when combined provided 

the identity of each group of Sossego?s dam and therefore represent good markers. The 

species A. bimaculatus possesses the most distinctive pattern characterized by two non-

homologous chromosomes bearing the Ag-NOR clusters. The C-banding/DAPI shows ten 

chromosome pairs with heterochromatin blocks, several of them located at the 

pericentromeric region. However, the most informative data is the location of 5S-rDNA 

clusters. Only A. bimaculatus has two chromosomes pairs bearing this kind of rDNA. The 

species A. giton similarly to A. bimaculatus has several chromosomes carrying 

heterochromatin blocks and only two chromosomes marked with CMA3. However 

differentiates of A. bimaculatus by having a single pair of chromosomes carrying the 5S-

rDNA clusters, instead of two. Oligosarcus argenteus possesses a clear divergence of that 

pattern shown by these two Astyanax species since he presented only few chromosomes 

marked by C-Banding/DAPI technique and 6 chromosomes marked by the CMA3 technique. 

The main distinctive character is the presence of only 8 chromosomes carrying 18S rDNA 

clusters, instead of 10 chromosomes as seen in these sympatric Astynax species. The toothed 

morph presented a mixed suit of markers and therefore unique. The C-banding (both Giemsa 

and DAPI stained), NOR banding and CMA3 banding patterns were closer to O. argenteus 

than to A. giton. However, the 18S FISH pattern was very similar to the pattern seen in A. 

giton. On the other hand, 5S FISH markings were conserved, exactly as in A. giton and O. 

argenteus.  

The karyotype of A. giton from Sossego?s dam was also different from that already 

described for a population in Paraiba do Sul River basin, distinguishing only by the 

difference between the proportion of subtelocentric and telocentric chromosomes, where the 

A. giton population from Sossego has 12 subtelocentric chromosomes pairs and the 

population from Paraiba do Sul River basin has only 4 subtelocentric chromosomes. 

Moreover, both populations presented, in the majority of their individuals, a single pair of 

chromosomes Ag-NOR marked and 10 chromosomes baring the 18S rDNA clusters (Kavalco 

and Moreira-Filho 2003). Unfortunately the authors did not pointed the location of such 18S 

clusters in the karyotype. The illustration, however, show that the main difference between 



 

52 

 

these two populations is the lack of the chromosome pair which bears the 18S rDNA on both 

telomeric regions.  

The lack of cytogenetic data about O. argenteus complicate any comparison between 

different populations of this species. Paiva (2008) described the karyotype of O. argenteus 

from São Bartolomeu River (also a tributary of Turvo River) which differed from the Sossego 

population only in the number of metacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes, but they share 

the same Fundamental Number. The O. argenteus population of São Bartolomeu River 

presented 4m+16sm+14st+16t and the population from Sossego was characterized by 

6m+16sm+12st+16st. Moreover, the São Bartolomeu population showed several 

heterochromatic blocks at the telomeric regions of different chromosomes, where one pair 

presented the bitelomeric mark. The karyotype of O. argenteus from Sossego was poorer on 

such heterochromatic blocks, but it counts with the bitelomeric mark on a large 

submetacentric chromosome. Also, it was found by Paiva (2008) that the specimens from São 

Bartolomeu River have two chromosome pairs bearing the Ag-NORs, contrasting with the 

single chromosome pair bearing the Ag-NOR for specimens from Sossego?s dam. The pattern 

of O. argenteus from another geographically close riverine system, the Casca River, was also 

informative. The individuals from that locality presented 10 chromosomes carrying the 18S 

rDNA clusters (including a chromosome with 18S rDNA clusters on both telomeric regions) 

(Barros, unpublished data). This is a remarkable difference between these two close 

populations of O. argenteus. Since in Sossego Oligosarcus argenteus is the only species with 

8 chromosomes bearing the 18S rDNA clusters, the rDNA configuration of that closest 

riverine population may suggest the uniqueness of the Oligosarcus from Sossego. 

A population of Oligosarcus macrolepis (Steindachner 1877), studied by Falcão and 

Bertollo (1985) collected from the Turvo River (Rio Doce basin) had similar karyotypes of 

that described in the present work except for differences between submetacentric and 

subtelocentric chromosomes. The karyotype described by Falcão and Bertollo (1985) was 

characterized by 6m+22sm+6st+16t. 

In lower vertebrates, NORs can be evidenced not only by silver staining but also by 

GC-specific fluorochromes such as chromomycin A3 and mithramycin. The great advantage 

of using fluorochromes is that it is possible to identify the 45S clusters of the NOR, 

independent of their activity (Schmid 1980; Schmid and Guttenbach 1988). Ag-NORs in the 



 

53 

 

genus Oligosarcus present an intra-and interspecific variation in number and a remarkable 

size heteromorphism in some populations (Kavalco et al. 2005). However, when the number 

of 18S rDNA markers are the same, the disturbances obtained through the ag-NOR technique 

should be linked to variations on the expression of the rDNA and the specific proteins 

connected to these active regions (Miller et al. 1976). 

The 5S rDNA multigene family consists of a highly conserved coding sequence of 

120bp forming arrays of several tandem copies, which are kept separated from each other by 

variable non-transcribed spacers (NTS) (Danna et al. 1996). This kind of rDNA gene is a 

smaller DNA sequence that does not participate in the formation of the nucleolus (Peres et al. 

2008). In several organisms, the 5S rDNA genes appear strongly constrained to only one 

chromosome pair, while NORs are often present in multiple chromosomes (Suzuki et al. 

1996, Mäkinem et al. 1997). The 5S clusters may also occur in more than a single 

chromosome pair (Martins and Galleti-Jr 1999) as exemplified by a population of A. giton 

with several chromosomes bearing the 5S clusters (Kavalco et al. 2004). The 5S rDNA 

clusters presents a different pattern of variation among fish species. Since the sequences of 

the 45S and 5S rDNA genes remained greatly conserved during the evolution of fish 

(Fujiwara et al. 1998; Martins and Galleti-Jr 2001), these sites may constitute important 

cytotaxonomical markers in this group (Garcia and Moreira-Filho 2008). To the present data, 

unfortunately, the 5S rDNA cluster represented a good marker only to identify A. 

bimaculatus since all other sympatric characids presented a single pair of chromosomes 

bearing those ribosomal genes. On the other hand A. giton from Sossego and Paraíba do Sul 

River basin populations are highly different because the first population has a single pair of 

chromosomes bearing the 5S clusters and the second  population counts with 10 

chromosomes carrying such genes (Kavalco et al. 2004). It seems highly improbable that all 

these divergence is connected only to Robertsonian chromosomal rearrangements. Despite 

the number of 5S rDNA clusters remains as good markers to distinguish these two 

populations, they should not be used to characterize A. giton. 

The morphological aspects of the chromosomal structure among the four karyotyped 

toothed morphs revealed the wide range of variation characteristic of some fish hybrids 

(LeGrande et al. 1984). All toothed morphs presented several degrees of chromosomal 

abnormalities by possessing numerous chromosomes unable to be paired including tiny 

chromosomes, of metacentric and telocentric morphology. The toothed morph CT 2214, 



 

54 

 

presented an additional small chromosome in more than a half of its cells. Chromosome 

variability with mitotic origin is not a novelty, and several variations (mainly in 

heterochromatic blocks) were documented in many vertebrates, invertebrates and plant 

species (Kurnit 1979). The chromosome heterozigosity among kangaroo hybrid species 

suggested to O?Neill et al. (2001) that the chromosome rearrangements found in such hybrids 

do not occur randomly.  Such variability may be explained by the concept of specific 

chromosomal territories inside the nucleus as proposed by Boveri (1909). It is currently 

accepted that the chromosomes are not randomly displayed inside the nucleus, but organized 

in specific chromosome territories that are essential components of the higher-order 

chromatin architecture of the vertebrate cell nucleus (Tanabe et al. 2002; Tashiro et al. 2007). 

Such arrangements have several implications on gene expression and chromosome evolution. 

It has been argued that heterochromatin blocks may play a role in the evolving nuclear 

architecture (Dechat et al. 2008; Manuelidis 1990), such as position of genes relative to the 

heterochromatin, which may strongly affect their transcription (Baxter et al. 2002; Lanctôt et 

al. 2007). The CT-IC cytogenetic model states that the positioning of genes into proper 

nuclear compartments is an essential part of gene-activation and gene silencing mechanisms 

(Cremer and Cremer 2001). Chromosome translocations that join heterochromatin segments 

with gene-dense chromatin segments may therefore lead to radial chromatin shifts depending 

on the size and composition of the respective segments (Tanabe et al. 2002). Not surprisingly, 

every subtle change on the position of some chromosome fragments (e.g. Position Effect) 

may have several and unpredictable phenotypic results. Hybridization can result in genomic 

changes including alterations to gene expression, chromosomal structure, and genome size 

(Baak and Rieseberg 2007). In the toothed morphs, hybrid somatic cells containing sets of 

chromosomes belonging to each parental may face a complex condition for each chromosome 

position inside the nucleus, which may result in non-random interaction between 

chromosomes inside the interphasic nucleus. According to John (1980), the occurrence of 

rearrangements involving homolog chromosomes is a rare event. Baak and Rieseberg (2007) 

suggest that in hybrid cells the karyotypic differences may arise through the sorting of 

chromosomal rearrangements that distinguish the parental species or may arise de novo. 

Chromosome fission or Robertsonian translocations may be responsible for the additional 

chromosome that characterized toothed morph CT 2214. The presence of high chromosome 

mosaicism on this specimen suggests that the rearrangements involved occurred late in the 

embryonic development (O?Neill 2001). Such chromosome instability in somatic cells may 



 

55 

 

bear phenotypic implications. Gene incompatibility of the parental species may lead to severe 

or lethal physiological disturbances, as reported for hybrids of crosses between the close 

swordfish species Xiphophorus maculatus and Xiphophorus helleri. These hybrids frequently 

develop melanotic tumours (Mayr 1966). Similar incompatibilities of the parental genomes 

have been described for species crosses in a number of animal and plant genera (Ghadially 

and Gordon 1957; Mayr 1966) and may lead to reductions on fertility capacity (Dobzhansky 

1953; Garagna et al. 2002). However, this concept of hybridization as an evolutionary dead-

end in animals is being challenged by reports of frequent hybridization between closely 

related species (Avise 1994; Barton and Hewitt 1989). These chromosomal rearrangements, 

mainly inversions, in hybrid swarms have their remarkable importance when carrying 

advantageous traits, which may lead to quickly fixation in the population (Stemshorn et al. 

2011) 

Mitochondrial DNA has been widely used in evolutionary studies because of its 

uniparental mode of inheritance, high rate of evolution, and ease of isolation and 

characterization (Moritz et al. 1987) and some mitochondrial genes could be used as 

phylogenetic markers to resolve relationships among taxa that diverged as long as 65 to 300 

million years ago (e.g., Ortí and Meyer 1997). On the other hand, the biparental way of 

inheritance of ITS sequences is advantageous when compared to the uniparental inheritance 

of organellar DNAs (Feliner and Roselló 2007) since the concerted evolution of tandem 

repetitive families, such as rDNA, make them useful in phylogenetic studies as a result of the 

homogenization of the variation within species and populations, whereas divergence is 

stressed between them (Hillis and Dixon 1991; Nei and Rooney 2005; Separack et al. 1988). 

The fast evolution of such sequences generates great amount of variability and when 

concerted evolution is not fully operating, duplicated ribosomal loci do not necessarily 

remain functional and some arrays may degenerate into pseudogenes (Feliner and Roselló 

2007). The inter-simple-sequence-repeats (ISSR) have applications in studies of population 

structure, parentage, individual identification, and may be used for studies of hybridization 

(Scribner et al. 2001). The three molecular approaches indicated different aspects of the 

toothed morphs genetic background, suggesting a matrilineal O. argenteus origin and a closer 

nuclear allelic identity to A. giton. The specimen CT 2213 represents the main clue that the 

toothed morphs are indeed hybrids since its matrilineal origin lies on Astyanax giton and its 

nuclear ITS-1 DNA is similar to those of Oligosarcus argenteus specimens. In the ten ISSR 



 

56 

 

loci that were considered good markers for A. giton or O. argenteus, the toothed morphs 

presented intermediary characters for nine loci. The degree of variance found among the 

paternal A. giton contribution is surprising, considering the rarity of male specimens of A. 

giton at Sossego?s Dam (Table 1).  

Hybrid occurrence is a common phenomenon among fishes, especially in fresh water 

ones (Hubbs 1955) and Schwartz (1972; 1981) reviewed 3,759 references related to fish 

hybridization. Several factors have been proposed as possible causes for the high incidence of 

hybridization among closely related fish taxa: external fertilization; weak behavioural 

isolating mechanisms; unequal abundance of the two parental species; competition for limited 

spawning habitat; and susceptibility to secondary contact between recently evolved forms 

(Hubbs 1955; Scribner et al. 2001); anthropogenic habitat alterations and introduction of 

exotic species may also be current relevant factors (e.g., Welsh and Cincotta 2004). Smith?s 

(1992) revision indicates three main assumptions on fish hybridization literature: 1) the 

likelihood of hybridization and the fertility of hybrids are proportional to genetic similarity 

(Hubbs 1955), which is condemned by Mayr (1999). Genetic compatibility between species 

can be considered a plesiomorphic trait that may or may not be blocked by subsequent 

evolution; 2) hybridization and introgression are promoted mainly by anthropogenic 

disturbance of habitat integrity, “hybridization of the habitat” (Miller et al.1989). Fossil and 

molecular evidences suggest, however, that hybridization has occurred in ancient as well as 

in modern times (Smith 1992). Anthropogenic disturbances are recent additions to normal 

geological, climatic and ecological modifications of habitats; 3) some assumptions on fish 

hybridism suggest they are “intermediate” between the parental morphotypes (Hubbs 1955). 

However some observations and experiments indicate, to the contrary, that diverse characters 

show a range of patterns of nonadditive inheritance as commented above.  

Four cases of spontaneous hybridism have been reported for Characidae fish, but they 

were either inferred and/or are restricted to the same nominal species. One of them is the 

blind troglodyte Astyanax jordani and the epigean species Astyanax mexicanus, as a result of 

sympatry when specimens of the latter species become trapped in caves with A. jordani 

(Kullander 1999). Pazza et al. (2006) reported two sympatric strains of A. fasciatus from 

Mogi-Guaçu River, with different chromosome configurations that suggest hybridization 

events. The other two cases are related to piranhas Serrasalmus. Based on chromosome 

morphology, Cestari and Galetti Jr. (1992) inferred the existence of hybridization between 



 

57 

 

two different and isolated populations of S. spilopleura: from the Upper Paraná and the 

Paraguay River basins. Hubert et al. (2007; 2008) studied 3 closely related species from 

Madeira River (Serrasalmus compressus, Serrasalmus hollandi and Serrasalmus sp.) by 

means of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. They indicated that recent isolation and 

ancestral polymorphism alone are unlikely to produce the observed high levels of haplotype 

sharing and the authors propose mtDNA introgression through hybridization as the most 

likely cause. Currently, genetic similarity of sympatric populations can be interpreted as 

evidence of a sympatric origin of species, evidence of introgressive hybridization or both 

(Grant et al. 2005). 

Introgressive hybridization is a common natural phenomenon and many examples in 

animals, and mainly in plants, have been reported (Anderson 1949). The remarkable 

importance of hybridism zones as “natural laboratories for evolutionary process” (Hewitt 

1988, 2011) must not mask its ecological impact. There has been considerable debate in the 

ecological and evolutionary literature over the relative importance and rate by which 

microevolutionary processes, operating at the population level, result in the separation and 

differentiation of lineages, populations and ultimately in speciation. As a microevolutionary 

process, hybridism influences the trajectory of around 10% of animal species, particularly in 

young, recently diverged species (Arnold 1997). Hybridization is usually infrequent in nature 

between sympatric species (Mallet 2008); when it occurs, however, it may have vast 

consequences. Scribner et al. (2001) propose that over evolutionary time scales, hybridization 

processes can be an important source of diversification in fish species, as exemplified by the 

hybrid origin of the Poecilia complex. Horizontal gene flow among different groups of 

Characidae may likewise result in deep alterations in morphological and molecular data at 

many levels of the systematic hierarchy. Gene transfer may explain the paraphyletic 

condition of the genus Astyanax as reported by Lucena (1993), Calcagnotto et al. (2005), and 

Javonillo et al. (2010). Although the Sossego?s Dam is a clear example of an anthropogenic 

habitat, past geologic events may have mimic small environments that favoured gene transfer 

among different lineages; these scenarios are not strange to the Neotropical hydrographical 

history (Lundberg et al. 1998; Ribeiro 2003). The ancient role of natural hybridization 

process may bear consequences at high evolutionary levels because several populations in a 

particular geographic context may be result of hybridization between two different taxa 

(Grant and Grant 1997). To better understand the relationship among the different Characidae 



 

58 

 

taxa, mainly those considered Incertae Sedis, it is essential to take into account the possibility 

of hybridization events, both anthropogenic and natural.  

The relevance of hybrids has been increasing in conservation biology. Hybridization 

may lead to the formation of new species, to extinction of native species or both (Moyle and 

Cech 2004) by swamping and replacing endemic genic pools with exotic genes from invasive 

species (Epifanio and Nielsen 2001; Tanaka 2007). Rates of hybridization and introgression 

have increased dramatically worldwide because of widespread intentional and incidental 

transpositions of organisms and habitat modifications by humans (Allendorf et al. 2010) and 

the harmful effects of hybridization, with or without introgression, have led to the extinction 

of many populations and species in many plant and animal taxa (Allendorf et al. 2001; 

Gurevitch and Padilla 2004; Rhymer and Simberloff 1996). Although there are no records of 

fish introductions for the Sossego?s Dam, A. giton is known only from this locality and 

therefore, it is also the only known locale where this species is sympatric with O. argenteus.  

To determine whether toothed morphs are ecological dead-ends or are able to 

reproduce with each other or introgress to their parental lineages, analysis of many functional 

aspects are still needed (e.g., gonadal and gametic development, and reproductive behavior). 

There is a common belief that hybridization almost never results in gene flow and 

introgression as a consequence of several post-zygotic natural barriers (Mayr 1966). 

However, Mallet (2005) suggested that the F1 hybrids should be the most difficult to achieve 

because they would be the result of special events. Barton (2001) also asserted that if fertile 

F1 hybrids are produced, they will almost certainly backcross to one or other parental 

genotype. Although the toothed morphs seemed to be the F1 hybrids, they were represented 

by both sexes and their gonads were normally developed. 

Most hybrid zones reflect a balance between migration and selection against hybrids 

(Barton and Hewitt 1989). However, it must be stressed that at the Sossego dam the fish 

population is small and isolated so, there is no possible migration and genetic exchange. 

Moreover, the strong sexual disequilibrium may reduce the effective size of that population 

allowing it to the dispersive effect of the genetic drift. As pointed out by Payseur (2010) the 

inheritance process can contribute additional inter-locus heterogeneity to patterns of 

introgression which are different between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA since variation in 

effective population size leads to disparate rates of genetic drift and also, genomic 



 

59 

 

compartments are expected to show discordant levels of introgression in species with sex-

biased dispersal. Some studies on the radiation of several small fish species found that 

sympatric pair of species appeared monophyletic in their mitochondrial but poly- or 

paraphyletic in their nuclear genes, suggesting hybridization of colonizing species, followed 

by the fixation of one parental mtDNA (Seehausen 2004). These new recombinants might aid 

the fixation of novel genotypes that are well suited to fill vacant niches in the novel 

environments in which adaptive radiations occur (Schilthuizen et al. 2004). These radiations 

generates a great amount of variation subject to strong selection purging incompatibility 

alleles and other alleles linked to them (Seehausen 2004). However, alleles there were rare in 

either parent population might them hitchhike to high frequencies in the hybrid population 

(Schilthuizen et al. 1999; 2001) (the “rare allele effect”) influencing, therefore, several 

morphological traits.  This kind of radiation influenced by hybridization events and also a 

balance between drift and selection against hybrids may be a good model for understanding 

some of the variation among the Neotropical Characidae fish. 

The genetic barriers involving chromosomal rearrangements are much stronger than 

single-locus barriers and so, they are far more likely to trigger a snowball accumulation of 

post-zygotic incompatibilities that can lead to reproductive isolation of the species (Navarro 

and Barton 2003) or their eventual hybrids. Therefore, the relationship between the toothed 

morphs and their parental species will be at least partially limited by their chromosomal 

incompatibilities. Overall karyotypic similarity between the parental species allowed the 

production of the toothed morphs. More critically, it is unknown whether other mechanisms 

acting on the reproductive tissues may counteract the unbalanced karyotypes seen in the renal 

tissue. Some species of the livebearer Poeciliopsis are known to have hybrid origin (Schultz 

1961) and developed different mechanisms to avoid chromosomal incompatibilities on 

heterozygotes. The “hybridogenesis” allow this species to transmit only the maternal 

chromosomes of each generation to the eggs, with the consequent meiotic loss of the male 

chromosomes (Schultz 1969).

Conclusions 

 

The toothed morph specimens were considered hybrids between Astyanax giton and 

Oligosarcus argenteus. Hybridization bears potentially high impact on the phylogeny of 

Characidae fish since the horizontal gene flow may character combinations that might 

preclude the establishment of monophyletic characters for involved taxa. Although the high 

levels of chromosomal variation and instability found in the toothed morphs strongly suggest 

their hybrid nature, the absence of meiotic data did not allow determining the effects of the 

hybrid karyotype on fertility. Therefore, the introgression of Oligosarcus argenteus genes 

inside Astyanax giton specimens demands more information about the genetic structure on 

both species. The existence of spontaneous intergeneric hybrids in an anthropogenic 

environment underlines still another threat to the Neotropical fish biodiversity.
