The biology of the Ucides cordatus in Vitória Bay (ES) was evaluated as a possible tool for 
population management. Sampling occurred monthly for about a year (October 1998 to September 
1999) with biometric analysis (CW = carapace width; WW = total wet weight) and abiotic factors on 
four transects, each with four bands (margin to supratidal region). The density was 3.7±1.5 crabs.m-2, 
with an increase toward the supratidal region, and depth of the galleries with 1.1 ± 0.3 m. The salinity 
of interstitial water differed between bands, being higher in the supratidal. There was significant 
correlation between the abundance of individuals and some environmental factors, the same 
occurring with open and closed burrows. The sex ratio showed a predominance of females 
(1.0M:1.6F), particularly between 50 and 75 mm (CW). The higher incidence of closed burrows 
occurred in August and September, while ovigerous females were recorded from January to 
April. The relationship WW/CW showed isometry for males (WW=0,425.10-3 LC3,0014; R2=0.99) and 
females (WW=0,439.10-3 LC2,97; R2=0.99). For the total population the average size (CW) and weight 
(WW) were 54.6±11.8 mm and 77.5±42.4 g, respectively. The population is under super-exploitation, 
requiring proper management for the viability of activity in the area. 

 

R E S U M O 
 
A biologia de Ucides cordatus na Baía de Vitória (ES) foi avaliada como subsídio ao manejo 
populacional. As amostragens ocorreram mensalmente durante um ano (outubro/1998 a 
setembro/1999), com análise biométrica (LC = largura da carapaça; PE = peso total úmido) e de 
fatores abióticos em quatro transectos, com quatro faixas cada (margem à região supratidal). A 
densidade foi de 3,7±1,5 caranguejos.m-2, com incremento em direção à região supratidal, sendo a 
profundidade das galerias de 1,1±0,3 m. A salinidade da água intersticial diferiu entre as faixas, 
sendo mais elevada na região supratidal. Houve correlação significativa entre a abundância de 
exemplares e alguns fatores ambientais, o mesmo ocorrendo quanto as tocas abertas e fechadas. A 
razão sexual evidenciou um predomínio de fêmeas (1,0M:1,6F), particularmente entre 50 e 75 mm 
LC. A maior incidência de tocas fechadas ocorreu em agosto e setembro, enquanto as fêmeas 
ovígeras foram registradas de janeiro a abril. A relação PE/LC mostrou isometria para os machos 
(PE=0,425.10-3 LC3,0014; R2=0,99) e fêmeas (P=0,439.10-3 LC2,97; R2=0,99). Para o total da população 
a média de tamanho (LC) e peso (PE) foi de 54,6±11,8 mm e de 77,5±42,4 g, respectivamente. Os 
dados evidenciam que a população encontra-se sobrexplotada, requerendo manejo adequado para a 
viabilidade da atividade extrativa na área estudada.

INTRODUCTION 
 

The mangrove crab Ucides cordatus 
(Linnaeus, 1763) is a species of economic interest with 
wide geographical distribution on the Atlantic coast, 
occurring from Florida to Santa Catarina (BR) 
(MELO, 1996).  In mangrove forest, the adult crabs 
mainly inhabit the intertidal area, where they  dig their 
burrows and pneumatophores among the roots, to 
depths of 0.6 to 2.0 m (COSTA, 1979; 
NASCIMENTO, 1993; BRANCO, 1993; DIELE, 
2000; PINHEIRO; FISCARELLI, 2001), while their 
young are more often found at the edges of the 
mangrove swamps/forests  (COSTA, 1979). 

Until as late as 1998 our knowledge of the 
biology and ecology of U. cordatus was still sparse, 
with a subsequent increase, however, due to important 
projects conducted by some research groups in Brazil, 
among which were the Madam Project (Bragança, 
PA), the Caranguejo Project (Vitória, ES) and the Uçá 
Project (Iguape, SP), in addition to other academic and 
scientific contributions. The action of IBAMA (more 
recently undertaken by ICM-Bio) was decisive for the 
advance in our knowledge of the biology of this 
species due to the state-of-the-art publication some 
years later by IBAMA (1994). This publication 
revealed a previous lack of information with a greater 
refinement of the biology of U. cordatus, necessary for 
the final elaboration of the fishery laws that resulted in 
the agreements made with a view to the participatory 
management which occurred in some Brazilian 
regions, especially in the south-southeast 
(RODRIGUES et al., 2000), that, in its turn, led to the 
current law published by IBAMA (2003) - IBAMA nº 
52/2003. Several developments have, since then, 
become evident in the literature (see review by 
CASTILHO-WESTPHAL et al., 2008), particularly as 
regards growth in size and weight (PINHEIRO et al., 
2005; PINHEIRO; HATTORI, 2006; PINHEIRO;  
FISCARELLI, 2009), size at the onset of maturity 
(PINHEIRO, 2004; DALABONA et al., 2005), 
population structure, density and habitat partition 
(DIELE et al., 2005; HATTORI, 2006), distribution 
(OLIVEIRA, 2005), trophic ecology (WOLFF et al., 
2000; CHRISTOFOLETTI, 2005; NORDHAUS et al., 
2006; NORDHAUS; WOLFF, 2007) and extractive 
potential (FERNANDES; CARVALHO, 2007; 
WUNDERLICH et al., 2008; ARAÚJO; CALADO, 
2008), indicating the urgent need of a population 
management policy, particularly after the classification 
of U. cordatus as an overexploited species by MMA 
law nº 5/2004 (MMA, 2004). In this sense, from mid-
2008, several meetings have been held by the 
Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (MMA), 
focused on the preparation of the National 
Management Program relating to Ucides cordatus and 
two other brachyuran species (Cardisoma guanhumi – 

“Guaiamú”; and Callinectes sapidus – “Siri Azul”) to 
be published in the near future. 

In recent years, crab captures have decreased 
in several Brazilian states and this has been seen as the 
first sign of the overexploitation of U. cordatus 
population stocks (ARAÚJO, 2006), mainly in some 
northeast states (Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, 
Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and northern Bahia). In 
these mangrove areas the disregard for fishery 
protection regulations or their absence has 
substantially changed the population structure of the 
species, leading to a reduction of the legal weight and 
capture size (LEGAT; PUCHNICK, 2003) and 
promoting a sex ratio imbalance (DIELE et al., 2005). 
Specifically on the coast of Espírito Santo State, the 
pressure that the crab collectors have exercised on the 
stocks over the years has been reported since the 80’s 
(CARMO, 1987), and it has led to reduction in the 
average size of the individuals, mainly the males, in 
the mangrove swamps/forests of Vitória Bay (GOES 
et al., 2000). According to Vale (1994), the crab 
collectors use this species both for their own 
consumption and for sale, which can often cause 
significant anthropogenic impact on the mangrove 
forest. 

This study aims to evaluate some aspects of the 
biology of U. cordatus, especially its abundance, sex 
ratio, weight/carapace width, as well as the influence 
of some environmental variables on the population 
density of this species in the mangrove forests of 
Vitória Bay, Brazil. 
 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 

The mangrove forests of Vitória Bay occupy 
an area of approximately 18 km2. This study was 
undertaken in the northeastern portion of the bay 
(20º14’20’’S - 40º18’30’’W), in a mangrove forest 
composed of four arboreal species: Rhizophora 
mangle Linnaeus, Laguncularia racemosa C. F. 
Gaertn, Avicennia schaueriana Stapf &amp;amp; Leechman and 
Avicennia germinans Linnaeus. The mangrove area 
studied has undergone great anthropic pressure due to 
the proximity of Vitória (a city of approximately 
320,000 people, according to IBGE, 2009), the capital 
of Espírito Santo State and bathed by the waters of the 
Carapina channel (CARMO et al., 1995). 

 The sampling was carried out monthly, during 
low tide, in the daytime, over three to four days per 
month, from October 1998 to September 1999. Four 
equidistant transects were established (100m apart), 
each of about 200 m in length, from the bank of the 
channel to the supratidal region. Four portions (bands) 
were sampled monthly by transect, corresponding to 0-
50m (Band I), 50-100 m (Band II), 100-150 m (Band 
III) and 150 m-hipersaline plain (Band IV).

Each gallery was inspected manually to detect 
any intercommunication with other gallery ducts, 
taking only one gallery into consideration at a time 
when it occurred (COSTA, 1979; HATTORI, 2006). 
Each gallery was evaluated in the light of its external 
morphology and classified as open or closed 
(SANTOS et al.,  2009). The total number of galleries 
per square meter was counted and used to estimate the 
crab density in each band, delimited with two nylon 
strips (marked in meters), tied to wooden stakes, and 
extended parallel to the transect at a distance of one 
meter (BRANCO, 1993). 

Water samples were obtained monthly with 
four PVC collectors previously installed, to register 
the interstitial salinity, pH and temperature. Sediment 
and air temperatures were also registered, as well as 
the interstitial salinity of the sediment and the salinity 
of the water inside the open galleries. Samples of the 
sediment in each band were collected using an adapted 
collector for mangrove forests (REBELO-MOCHEL, 
1986) and submitted to granulometric analysis to 
obtain four fractions: sand (coarse and fine), silt and 
clay.  

The  depth  of  the galleries was estimated 
using a 2.5m length of cotton twine (3.0mm diameter) 
that was tied to the base of the minor cheliped of each 
specimen before its release at the opening of its 
gallery. The depth of the gallery was estimated by the 
difference  between  the total length of the cotton 
twine and that recorded at the entrance to the gallery, 
once the specimen had reached the bottom of the 
same. 

The sex of the specimens established by 
inspection, in the laboratory, of the abdominal 
morphology and the number of pleopods (see 
PINHEIRO; FISCARELLI, 2001), their measurement 
with calipers (CW = maximum cephalothorax width, 
in millimeters) and weighing with a digital electronic 

balance (WW = total wet weight, in grams), were 
registered. 

The ANOVA (ZAR, 1999) was applied for 
each environmental parameter registered in the bands 
sampled, and they were also tested for homogeneity 
(Bartlett’s test) and normality of distribution 
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The cases characterized 
by statistical differences were tested with the Tukey-
Kramer test which was applied to verify possible 
contrast between the averages. The relationship 
WW/CW was evaluated for males and females, 
according to the procedures described by Pinheiro and 
Fiscarelli (2009). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was 
used to verify the association between crab abundance 
and total number of burrows (open and closed) and the 
environmental variables studied. 

Juvenile crabs (CW?40 mm, according Goes et 
al., 2000), represented by juvenile males and females, 
were grouped for statistical analysis. The X2 test was 
applied to verify any possible difference between 
sexual proportion by month and CW distribution class 
(VAZZOLER, 1996). 

The significance level of the statistical tests 
was set at 5%, while for Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient it was established at 5 and 1%. 
 

RESULTS 
 

The crab density in the bands varies between 
1.5 and 5.0 crabs.m-2 (Table 1), with a total average 
density of 3.7±1.5 crabs.m-2, which corresponds 
approximately to 37,000 individuals per hectare. The 
average number of open and closed burrows shows a 
tendency to increase from the border of Carapina 
Channel (lower mangrove band) to the hipersaline 
plain (upper mangrove band), with a significant 
predominance of closed burrows over open ones in 
Band IV (t=4.14; p&lt;0.05; df=35) (Table 1).

Despite the significant oscillations registered 
over the year, the average number of total burrows 
(open and closed) showed no significant differences 
(t=1.58; p&gt;0.05; df=22), although the highest means of 
closed burrows occurred mainly in August and 
September (Fig. 1). The depths of burrows varied 
between 1.03 and 1.13 m, corresponding to an average 
total depth of 1.10+0.26 m (Tab. 1).  

There was no variation between the average air 
temperatures of the sampled bands (F3-44=0.39; 
p&gt;0.05), the same occurring with those registered for 
the water in the burrows (F3-44=0.09; p&gt;0.05) and 
when the monthly averages of the air and burrow 
water temperatures were compared (t=1.98; p&gt;0.05, 
df=22) (Fig. 2a). Average data of the interstitial water 
salinity in Band IV were higher and more significant 
than the others (F3-44=10.67; p&lt;0.01). No differences 
were found among the burrow water salinity values of 
the bands (F3-44=1.57; p?0.05) or when the interstitial 

and burrow water salinity was compared (t=0.41; 
p?0.05, df=22) (Fig. 2b). 

Persons’ correlation coefficient indicates a 
positive and significant association (p&lt;0.01) between 
total crab abundance and temperature values (air, 
sediment and burrow water), as well as with coarse 
sand but a negative correlation with clay (Table 2). 
The total of burrows was positive and strongly 
associated with salinity (interstitial water and burrow 
water) (p&lt;0.01), positive though weakly associated 
with pH and coarse sand (p&lt;0.05), and negatively 
correlated with silt and clay (p&lt;0.01). The numbers of 
open and closed burrows differ when correlated with 
environmental variables, a positive significance 
occurring with temperature (sediment and burrow 
water) and salinity (interstitial and burrow water), 
respectively. Bands III and IV were characterized by 
the highest levels of interstitial and burrow water 
salinities, related to a predominance of closed burrows 
(Tables 1 and 2).

(?2=5.47; p&lt;0.05) (Fig. 2) and this tendency was 
greater in some of the months sampled (November, 

March-May and July-September), coincidentally with 
a dominance of non-ovigerous females. Juveniles 
occurred at low frequencies along the year, while 
overigenous females were registered from January to 
March (Fig. 3).

The distribution of U. cordatus specimens by 
size class (CW) revealed greater frequencies between 
40 and 85 mm (Fig. 4), with significant female 
predominance in the intermediate classes (50-75 mm) 
and sexual equivalence in the other classes, except for 
a male predominance in 25-30mm. Juvenile 
frequencies were registered between 15 and 40 mm. 

The WW/CW ratio was isometric for males 
(WW=0.425 10-3 CW3.0014; R2=0.99) and females 

(WW=0.439 10-3 CW2.97; R2=0.99) (Fig. 5), and 
without significance when the “b” values obtained 
were compared (t=0.0043; p&gt;0.05, df=495). Total 
population has a CW variation from 17 to 85mm 
(54.6±11.8mm) and WW oscillates from 2.0 to 206.7g 
(77.5±42.4g), resulting in a common WW/CW 
equation represented by WW=0.444 10-3 CW2.98 

(R2=0.99), which also followed an isometric tendency.

DISCUSSION 
 

The mean densities of open and closed burrows 
in the mangrove forest of Vitória Bay show an 
increasing tendency from the channel to the 
hipersaline plain. This aspect was observed mainly in 
Band IV, with a greater density than in other areas due 
to the predominance of juvenile crab burrows. These 
results agree with data presented by Warner (1969) for 
Jamaican mangrove swamps, where density oscillates 
from 0.2 crabs.m-2 (lower mangrove band) to 1.5 
crabs.m-2 (upper mangrove band). A similar pattern 
occurs in Brazil, although the magnitude of the density 
of the presence of U. cordatus in mangrove areas is 
different, ranging from 1.1 crabs.m-2 in the southern 
region (BRANCO, 1993) to 4.8 crabs.m-2 in the 
northeast (ALCANTARA-FILHO, 1978). The 
occurrence of higher crab densities in upper mangrove 
bands has also been reported in northeastern 
(NASCIMENTO; COSTA, 1983), southeastern 
(HATTORI, 2006) and southern Brazil 
(BLANKENSTEYN et al., 1997), and is possibly to be 
explained as due to peculiar physical factors such as 
water level, sediment drainage, and soil 
humidity/salinity (ALVES; NISHIDA, 2004; 
HATTORI, 2006). However, despite the high density 
of U. cordatus in upper mangrove bands, the 
population structure in these areas indicates that it is 
composed of smaller individuals than those typically 
present in lower mangrove bands (HATTORI, 2006). 
Population density estimates of semiterrestrial crabs 
based on burrow counts tends to overestimate the 

density if no care is taken to discard the number of 
unoccupied galleries or consider those with multiple 
openings as single ones (MACINTOSH, 1988; 
MACIA et al., 2001). 

The denser vegetal covering near the channel 
(Band I) explains the lower average temperature than  
that observed in the upper mangrove area (Band IV) 
where the vegetal covering was less dense (CARMO 
et al., 1995). Temperature can be used as an important 
indicator of crab behavior, can explain their low 
mobility and smaller captures in the winter months 
than in the summer when they are more active (GOES 
et al., 2000). The low winter temperatures also affect 
the gallery-closing behavior of the crabs, which use 
this period to perform the ecdysis inside and determine 
the period of change of the species. This study 
confirms the data obtained by Pinheiro and Fiscarelli 
h(2001) and Wunderlich et al. (2008), who reported a 
igher occurrence of closed burrows between August 
and September and from June to October, respectively. 
Nascimento (1993) cited a higher frequency of 
molting in the northeastern region of Brazil (Sergipe 
State) from September to November, while in Ceará 
State the greatest occurrence was detected in 
December (ALCÂNTARA-FILHO, 1978). 
Differences between periods may occur between 
mangrove areas by virtue of contrasts in latitude and 
vegetation, an interesting aspect which calls for further 
analysis.  

Higher salinity values were registered in upper 
mangrove areas (Band IV) where there was less 
frequent flooding and greater exposure to the sun´s

heat due to the sparser vegetal covering. However, 
more uniform levels of water salinity are to be found 
inside the closed burrows (see interstitial salinity 
values) than in the open ones that are more subject to 
the influence of tides and rainfall.  The positive 
association detected between interstitial water salinity 
and number of closed burrows (see Band IV) is 
probably related to the highest occurrence of small 
specimens, very common in upper mangrove areas 
(COSTA, 1979; NASCIMENTO, 1993; DIELE, 
2000). Hattori (2006) reports a positive association 
between the salinity values of burrow water and the 
density of U. cordatus, an association which also 
holds true of the levels of calcium and magnesium, the 
minerals that are essential to crustaceans during the 
period of the hardening of their exoskeletons, in 
burrow water (PRATOOMCHAT et al., 2002; 
WHEATLY et al., 2002; ZIEGLER, 2002). 

Silt and clay content directly affect the 
porosity, hardness and water content of sediments 
(BROWN; MCLACHLAN, 1994) as well as the 
bioturbation caused by benthic animals with 
scavenging habit, such as crabs (KRISTENSEN, 2008; 
PENHA-LOPES et al., 2009). The significant negative 
association between the total number of galleries and 
the silt and clay found in this study was similar to that 
reported by Hattori (2006), although the latter author 
has made use of density as the dependent variable, 
with no statistical significance. Sediments with finer 
particle size are easier to dig for crabs, but provide less 
stable galleries, thus explaining the association of 
these constructions by U. cordatus with the structural 
support afforded by the mangrove vegetation, 
particularly by its roots and branches, increasing the 
galleries´ stability (OLIVEIRA, 2005). In this regard, 
the association between particle size, rooting and 
flooding in mangroves may also influence the 
scavenging depth of Ucides cordatus, reaching more 
than 2 m deep in some places, as previously reported 
by Nordhaus et al. (2009). 

Ucides cordatus has presented seasonal 
reproduction (WUNDERLICH et al., 2008), confirmed 
in this study. According to those authors, despite the 
latitudinal variation due to the influence of 
temperature, photoperiod and precipitation, the 
reproductive season of this species lasts for 5-6 
months, usually from November to May, which is 
consistent with the results of this study. 

The significant predominance of females in the 
population of Vitória Bay is probably related to the 
increased intensity of the harvesting of males, as 
already reported by other authors, mainly in the 
Northeastern Region (COSTA, 1979; BOTELHO et 
al., 1999; IVO et al., 1999). Since males have a higher 
rate of growth in size and weight (PINHEIRO et al., 
2005) they are the main target of capture by the crab 
pickers (GÓES et al., 2000). This assertion is 

supported by the distribution of individuals by size 
class, in which a significant predominance of females 
between 50-75mm may be related to this fishing effort 
aimed specifically at males. Similar results were 
obtained by Diele (2000) in the Caeté Estuary (PA) 
and related to catch pressure mainly in the areas most 
easily accessible to crab catchers. However, 
differences in sex ratio may be due to different rates of 
mortality/growth between sexes (WENNER, 1972), by 
association with a certain phase of the reproductive 
cycle (COSTA, 1979) or due to the flood level and 
arboreal composition of the mangrove area studied 
(WUNDERLICH; PINHEIRO, in preparation). The 
sex ratio datum obtained by Alves and Nishida (2004) 
from a Permanent Protect Area of the Mamanguape 
River (PB) was 1.85M:1F, indicating a greater 
prevalence of males in an environment with little 
anthropic influence. 

The maximum crab sizes (CW) registered in 
the present study (males, 80.3 mm; females, 77.4 mm) 
are a little inferior to those found in the Northeastern 
(86 and 81mm, respectively) (CASTRO, 1986; 
VASCONCELOS et al., 1999) and Southern Brazilian 
Regions (96 and 77 mm) (BRANCO, 1993). In the 
mangrove forests of the Vitória Bay the crabs 
presented an isometric wet weight growth pattern for 
males and females, revealing a tendency very similar 
to that obtained by Pinheiro and Fiscarelli (2009), 
despite the negative alometry verified by these last 
authors with regard to females. The reduction of the 
crab size, weight and abundance in various mangrove 
areas in Brazil reveals the great pressure to which the 
uçá-crab population has been subject. This fact is also 
a matter of concern as regards Vitória Bay, where a 
large number of crab catchers are active, a situation 
which may lead to the collapse of the crab fishery in 
the near future. It is therefore to be hoped that the 
results obtained by this study may strengthen the 
perceived need for the planning and management of 
the harvesting of this species.
