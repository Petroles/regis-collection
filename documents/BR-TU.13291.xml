ABSTRACT

Scirrhous eosinophilic gastritis (SEG) is characterized 
by diffuse infiltration of eosinophils and concomitant fibrovascular 
tissue proliferation in the stomach wall. The condition is a rare 
occurrence with an unknown cause. Two dogs were examined 
with a history of progressive weight loss, emesis, melena and 
anorexia. Complete blood cell counts of both cases revealed 
anemia and eosinophilia, while ultrasonography examination 
revealed thickening of the stomach wall. Due to suspected gastric 
neoplasia and a poor clinical prognosis, the dogs were euthanized. 
At necropsy, both had markedly distended stomachs with a diffusely 
thickened and firm wall. The spleens of both dogs were enlarged with 
a nodular surface. Histological evaluation revealed diffuse infiltrate 
of eosinophils, fibrovascular tissue proliferation and fibrinoid 
degeneration in blood vessel walls of stomach and spleen. SEG is 
a rare pathological condition that must be considered as a possible 
diagnosis in dogs presenting gastrointestinal signs and eosinophilia.

Key words: dog, eosinophilia, gastroenteritis, gastropathy.

RESUMO

A gastrite eosinofílica esquirrosa (GEE) é 
caracterizada por infiltrado inflamatório difuso de eosinófilos e 
concomitante proliferação de tecido fibrovascular no estômago. 
A condição apresenta ocorrência rara e causa desconhecida. 
Dois cães foram examinados com histórico de emagrecimento 
progressivo, êmese, melena e anorexia. O hemograma de 
ambos os casos revelou anemia e eosinofilia, enquanto o exame 
ultrassonográfico evidenciou espessamento da parede do 
estômago. Diante de suspeita de neoplasia gástrica e devido ao 
prognóstico desfavorável, foi realizada a eutanásia dos cães. 
Na necropsia, ambos apresentavam estômago acentuadamente 
aumentado, com parede difusamente espessada e firme. O baço 
dos dois cães apresentava-se aumentado e com superfície nodular. 
O exame histopatológico revelou infiltrado difuso de eosinófilos, 

proliferação de tecido fibrovascular e degeneração fibrinoide na 
parede de vasos sanguíneos no estômago e baço. A GEE é uma 
condição patológica rara que deve ser considerada no diagnóstico 
em cães que apresentem sinais gastrointestinais e eosinofilia.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare 
condition of unknown cause characterized by diffuse 
infiltration of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal 
tract (HSU &amp;amp; LO, 1998). EG is frequently reported 
in humans (MORETTI et al., 2006; ZHOU et al., 
2014) with few reports in dogs (MCTAVISH, 2002; 
FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). The condition can 
affect multiple segments of the digestive system 
concomitantly or individually, causing distinct 
gastrointestinal clinical manifestations (HSU 
&amp;amp; LO, 1998; MCTAVISH, 2002; TEMIZ et al., 
2012; FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). Scirrhous 
eosinophilic gastritis (SEG) is a subtype of EG 
characterized by diffuse infiltration of eosinophils 
and concomitant fibrous tissue proliferation in 
the stomach wall (HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 
1977). The condition has unknown cause, and 
there are few studies describing this type of EG in 
dogs (HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). Dogs 
affected by SEG show clinical signs similar to those 
presented by dogs with chronic gastrointestinal 
diseases (MCTAVISH, 2002). This report describes

the clinical signs, laboratory results and pathological 
findings of SEG in two dogs.

Dog 1 was a two-year-old male, Fila 
Brasileiro breed, with a history of hyporexia, 
progressive weight loss, diarrhea and hematochezia 
for two months. On clinical examination, the dog 
presented marked cachexia, apathy and melena. 
The blood cell count revealed marked eosinophilia 
(4936mm-3, reference values (RV): 100 to 
1240mm-3), marked decreased hemoglobin (3.8g 
dL-1, RV: 12 to 18g dL-1) and decreased hematocrit 
(15%, RV: 37 to 55%). Serum biochemistry showed 
reduced albumin (15.33g L-1, RV: 26 to 33g L-1). 
Abdominal ultrasonography examination revealed 
thickening of the gastric wall (2.8cm), and the 
spleen was enlarged and multinodular with irregular 
borders. Dog 2 was a six year old male, mixed-breed, 
with a history of weight loss, anorexia and vomiting 
for 30 days and melena for three days. On physical 
examination the dog presented marked cachexia, 
dehydration and pale mucous membranes. Blood cell 
count revealed eosinophilia (2400mm-3), decreased 
hemoglobin (10.8g dL-1) and decreased hematocrit 
(31%). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed that 
the gastric wall was 1.9cm thick, and the spleen was 
enlarged with irregular borders. Based on the clinical 
and ultrasonography examination in both of the 
cases, a presumptive diagnosis of gastric neoplasia 
or chronic gastritis was established. Euthanasia was 
performed in both of the cases due to a deteriorating 
quality of life and poor prognosis.

The dogs were necropsied, and the tissue 
samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral 
buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 
5µm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). 
Sections of the stomach and spleen were also stained 
with Masson’s trichrome (MT), Periodic acid-Schiff 
(PAS) and Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS).

At necropsy, both of the dogs presented 
similar lesions. The stomach was markedly enlarged 
with hemorrhages on the serosa (Figure 1A), and 
the stomach wall was diffusely thickened (2 to 
4cm). On the cut surface the gastric wall was firm, 
white to yellow with multifocal small cystic areas 
(Figure 1B). The gastric mucosa presented multiple 
ulcerations ranging from 0.2 to 1cm in diameter. 
The spleens were markedly enlarged, showing a 
multinodular aspect with white, firm tissue on the 
capsule (Figure 1C). The other viscera were normal.

Histological evaluation of the stomach of 
both dogs revealed transmural eosinophilic infiltration, 
which was severe in the mucosa and submucosa 
layers and mild in the muscular and serosa layers. The 

submucosa also presented marked fibrous connective 
tissue proliferation (evidenced with MT stain) and 
neovascularization (Figure 1D-E). Dog 1’s stomach 
also presented discrete mast cells and Mott cell 
infiltration, multifocal areas of necrosis in the mucosa 
with neutrophil infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis 
of submucosal arteries (evidenced by PAS stain). 
Splenic lesions consisted of connective fibrous tissue 
proliferation, multifocal areas of hemorrhage, arterial 
fibrinoid necrosis and moderate multifocal infiltrating 
inflammatory cells composed of numerous eosinophils, 
moderate plasma cells, foamy macrophages and Mott 
cells (Figure 1F). Mild eosinophilic infiltration in 
the duodenum and liver of dog 1 was also observed. 
The GMS stain did not show fungal structures in the 
stomach and spleen of either dog 1 or 2.

SEG is a subtype of EG that affects dogs 
and is a rare occurrence with few cases described 
(HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). The diagnosis 
of SEG in the cases reported here was based on clinical 
signs, blood count, ultrasonography examination, 
necropsy and histopathological findings (HSU &amp;amp; LO, 
1998; FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012).

In humans, EG is defined based on the 
following criteria: 1) gastrointestinal tract symptoms; 
2) eosinophilic infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract 
(more than 20 eosinophils per high power field); and 
3) exclusion of other general causes of eosinophilia 
(parasitic infestations, connective tissue disease, 
hypereosinophilic syndrome, lymphoma and other 
intestinal tumors, primary amyloidosis and celiac 
disease (HSU &amp;amp; LO, 1998; PENNINCK, 2005). 
Clinical signs, laboratory test results and post-mortem 
findings of both cases reported are according to the 
criteria above mentioned. 

The cause of EG is not elucidated; however, 
food allergens, hypersensitivity reactions and 
parasite migration are suggested as etiologies in dogs 
(HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977; FONSECA-
ALVES et al., 2012). Some of the gastrointestinal 
parasites that may cause EG in humans and dogs 
are Ancylostoma caninum, Ascaris lumbricoides, 
Trichuris trichiura and Toxocara canis (HONG et al., 
2003; CHIRA et al., 2005). Dog’s owners reported no 
history of hypersensitivity reactions, and the dogs did 
not present gastrointestinal parasites at necropsy. The 
etiology of SEG in these cases thus remains uncertain.

Clinical signs presented by the dogs 
corroborate with those previously reported in other 
cases of EG in dogs (MCTAVISH, 2002; FONSECA-
ALVES et al., 2012). Vomiting, weight loss and 
abdominal discomfort are usually observed early in 
the disease course, while tenesmus, hematochezia

and melena are observed in the latter stages as the 
disease progresses. In both cases reported here, the 
hematochezia and melena resulted in anemia, which 
was severe in dog 1 because it was presented to the 
veterinary in a later stage of the disease, presenting 
severe gastric ulcers. Based on the clinical and 
ultrasound examination, in both cases the presumptive 
diagnosis was gastric neoplasm. When there is a 
marked thickening of the gastric wall, inflammatory 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract may mimic 
infiltrative neoplasms (PENNINCK, 2005).

Hypereosinophilia is a common finding 
in cases of EG in humans and dogs (HSU &amp;amp; LO., 
1998; MORETTI et al., 2006; TEMIZ et al., 2012; 
FONSECA-ALVES et al., 2012). Low albumin 
levels in the blood of dog 1 may be associated with 
the loss of appetite, vomiting and malabsorption due 
to gastric lesions. 

In other cases of SEG, the gastric wall 
thickness ranged from 2 to 2,5cm (HAYDEN &amp;amp; 
FLEISCHMAN, 1977). In both dogs, the stomach 
wall was diffusely thickened, affecting the

cardiac, fundic and pyloric regions. HAYDEN &amp;amp; 
FLEISCHMAN (1977) and RODRÍGUEZ et al. 
(l995) reported marked thickening in the fundic 
region, while FONSECA-ALVES et al. (2012) 
found that the stomach wall was only thickened 
in the pyloric region. As in the cases we report, 
HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN (1977) described an 
enlarged and nodular spleen; however, the splenic 
lesion physiopathology is not clear.

Histologically, eosinophilic infiltration was 
observed in the stomach, spleen (dog 1 and  2), duodenum 
and liver (dog 1). The stomach and duodenum are the 
most affected gastrointestinal segments in the cases of 
EG in dogs and humans (HAYDEN &amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 
1977; MORETTI et al., 2006; FONSECA-ALVES et 
al., 2012). Eosinophil infiltration in the gastrointestinal 
tract is mainly observed in the mucosa and submucosa 
(25-100%) followed by the muscle layers (13-70%) 
and serosa (10-40%) (KHAN, 2005). In humans, EG 
is histologically classified into mucosal, muscular, and 
subserosal (RODRÍGUEZ et al., 1995). In the cases 
described, the stomach lesions were transmural. 

In this report, EG was classified as 
“scirrhous” due to the marked fibrovascular tissue 
proliferation observed in the gastric wall (HAYDEN 
&amp;amp; FLEISCHMAN, 1977). SEG should be considered 
in the differential diagnosis of tumor-like lesions that 
present eosinophil infiltration in the stomach wall 
including gastric pythiosis (TROST et al., 2009) and 
gastric mast cell tumors. The diagnosis of gastric 
pythiosis was excluded because no fungal structures 
were observed upon GMS staining. The stomach of dog 
1 presented some mast cell infiltration, but these cells 
did not present malignant features. Histopathological 
examination allowed the differentiation of SEG from 
other disorders that cause gastrointestinal signs and 
stomach wall thickening associated with eosinophil 
infiltration in dogs.
