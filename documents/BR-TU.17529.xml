ABSTRACT

The Lutetium-Hafnium isotopic system represents one of the most innovative and powerful tools for geochronology

and isotopic studies. Combined U-Pb and Lu-Hf in situ analyses on zircon by LA-MC-ICP-MS permit to characterize

isotopically the host magma from which it crystallized furnishing significant information for sediment provenance

and crustal evolution studies. In this paper we describe the Lu-Hf systematic by LA-MC-ICP-MS developed in the

laboratory of Geochronology of the University of Brasilia and report the results obtained by repeated analyses of
176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratio of three zircon standards: GJ-1 = 0.282022 ± 11 (n=56), Temora 2 = 0.282693 ± 14

(n=25) and UQZ = 0.282127 ± 33 (n=11). The 176Hf/177Hf ratio (0.282352 ± 22, n=14) of gem quality zircon used

as in-house standard have been also characterized. As a geological application, we analyzed two complex zircons

selected from a migmatitic rocks from the Borborema Province, NE Brazil. On the basis of U-Pb and Lu-Hf data, two

main crystallization events have been identified in both studied zircons. An older event at ca. 2.05 Ga recognized in

the inherited cores represents a well-characterized paleoproterozoic magmatic event that affected the whole Borborema

Province. A second crystallization event at ? 575 Ma, recognized at the rims, represents a Neoproterozoic (Brazilian)

high grade metamorphic-magmatic event.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, the rapid progresses in Induc-

tively Coupled Plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS),

combined with the new techniques for in situ laser abla-

tion microanalysis, made the Lutetium-Hafnium isotopic

system one of the most innovative and powerful tools

for geochronologic and isotopic studies. (Thirlwall and

The significance of the Lu-Hf method on zircon

grains, when combined with the U-Pb method, is the

possibility to characterize isotopically the host magma

from which they crystallized. The geological applica-

tions of this information are numerous. Firstly, in sed-

iment provenance studies the Hf isotopes yield isotopic

constrains on the origin of detrital zircons and conse-

quently of the host sediments. The different Hf isotope

signatures, found in a zircon population or even in a sin-

gle zircon, permit to characterize different magmatic or

high-T metamorphic events succeeding in time during

the crustal evolution of the source regions (Gerdes and

Zeh 2006, Zeh et al. 2007).

In this paper we describe in detail the analytical

systematic of the Lu-Hf method for LA-MC-ICP-MS on

zircon, developed in the Laboratory of Geochronology

of the University of Brasília.

We show Hf isotope analyses obtained for three

standard zircons (GJ-1, Temora 2 and UQ Z6) and for

a gem quality zircon that would represent a potential in-

house standard.

We also present an application of this methodol-

ogy for studying a geological problem in an area of the

Borborema Province, Rio Grande do Norte. Combined

U-Pb and Lu-Hf analyses, associated with backscatter-

ing imaging (BSI), have been carried out on two se-

lected zircons separated from a leucosome portion of

a migmatitic rock associated to a paleoproterozoic ter-

rane. Several authors (Dantas et al. 1999, 2004) iden-

tified in this sector of the Borborema Province multiple

orogenic/metamorphic events of archean to paleo- and

neoproterozoic ages.

STATE OF THE ART

THE LU-HF ISOTOPE SYSTEM

The Lu-Hf isotope system consists of the spontaneous

decay of unstable radionuclide 176Lu, by ?-emission, to

the stable 176Hf with a half-life of 37.2 Ga. The element

Lu is the heaviest Rare Earth Element, belonging to the

Lantanides group. It has two natural isotopes: the stable

isotope 175Lu and the radioactive isotopes 176Lu, rep-

resenting 97.41% and the 2.59% of the natural Lu iso-

tope abundance respectively. Hafnium is a High Field

Strength Element (HFSE) and belongs to the Lithophile

group IVa of the periodic table. It has six isotopes:
176Hf, 177Hf, 178Hf, 179Hf and 180Hf, all being stable

non-radiogenic except for 176Hf.

The abundance of the isotope 176Hf on Earth is

variable due to the radioactive decay of 176Lu, and in

the literature it is conventionally compared to the 177Hf.

represents the basic age equation for Lu-Hf method,

where t is the elapsed time from the closure of the sys-

tem, and ? is the decay constant of 176Lu. Different

values for ? have been proposed in the past by several

authors. Patchett and Tatsumoto (1980) proposed the

value 1.94 × 10?11 y?1, calculated from the slope of a

Lu-Hf isochron for eucrite meteorites of known age. In

the following, Sguigna et al. (1982) modified the ? value

to 1.93 × 10?11 y?1. Recently, Scherer et al. (2001)

proposed the new value of 1.86 × 10?11 y?1 obtained

by calibration against the U-Pb decay system, which is

in agreement with the value obtained by Nir-El and Lavi

(1998) using the decay scintillation counting method.

The application of Lu-Hf systematic to geoscien-

ces was developed since 1980 when Patchett and Tat-

sumoto (1980) and Patchett et al. (1981) used TIMS to

measure the respective isotopes. However, due to the

high ionisation potential of hafnium (6.65 eV), the TIMS

method required large sample sizes and a high purity ion

exchange separation in order to achieve acceptable re-

sults. In the last decade, the new MC-ICP-MS method,

which permits excellent ionisation on impure sample

solutions, became the best method for Hf isotope anal-

ysis. The laser ablation technique coupled with MC-

ICP-MS permitted to analyze solid samples, as mineral

grains, with high spatial resolution. The mineral zircon

is considered a privileged mineral for isotope analyses

of the Lu-Hf system (as for U-Pb system) due to the

combination of physical-chemical characteristics and to

the capability to host trace and Rare Earth Elements in its

crystalline structure (Kinny and Maas 2003, Woodhead

et al. 2004). Moreover, zircon is a common accessory

mineral, which is present in a great variety of rocks, usu-

ally preserving a very complex growing history.

An advantage to use the Lu-Hf method is that Hf,

having a geochemical behavior very similar to zirco-

nium, is much more compatible for zircon than Rare

Earth Elements (REE), especially Lu. Thus, Hf may

reach a higher concentration (up to 3 %) and is retained

more easily than Lu in the zircon lattice.

For this reason, zircons are characterized by very

low 176Lu/177Hf ratios (&amp;lt;0.001) and, consequently, the

isotopic variations of Hf due to the radiogenic 176Hf are

practically negligible. The main corollary of this is that

zircons preserve the initial 176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratios

inherited by the magma where they crystallized.

This characteristic, together with the high content

of Hf and its very low diffusivity in zircon, permits to

preserve, in a single crystal, different Hf isotopic com-

position, generated during crystal growing under the

variable P, T and compositional conditions. Experimen-

tal calibrations showed that zircon has the closing tem-

perature for Lu-Hf system 200?C higher than U-Pb

system (Cherniak et al. 1997, Cherniak and Watson

2000), indicating that the Hf isotope system remains

closed during most of the thermal events after the crys-

tallization of zircon.

LU-HF EVOLUTION IN THE EARTH’S CRUST AND MANTLE

The Lu-Hf isotope system is utilized to study the his-

tory of differentiation of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE)

that led to the formation of the crust-mantle system. This

isotope system has a systematic that is very similar to

the Sm-Nd system, with some fundamental exceptions.

The first is that, while Sm and Nd are both Rare Earth

Elements with very similar chemical characteristics, Lu

and Hf are a Heavy Rare Earth Element (HREE) and a

HFSE, respectively. This implies in a very different be-

havior for Lu and Hf during the evolution of the crust-

mantle system. Hf is more incompatible than Lu dur-

ing the partial melting processes in the mantle; so, dur-

ing the first events of juvenile crust generation in the

archean time, the crust has been enriched in Hf and de-

pleted in Lu, leaving a mantle enriched in Lu and de-

pleted in Hf. Thus, starting from an unique primor-

dial mantle with chondritic Lu and Hf isotopic com-

position, which is referred as CHUR (Chondritic Uni-

form Reservoir) composition, two reservoirs with dif-

ferent Lu/Hf ratio were generated: the crust with Lu/

Hfcrust &amp;lt;Lu/HfCHUR and the depleted mantle with Lu/

Hfmantle &gt; Lu/HfCHUR.

As for other isotope systems, the deviation of the
176Hf/177Hf from the chondritic (CHUR) values for a

sample is indicated by the Epsilon (?) notation:

}

Whereas a single stage TDM age is commonly cal-

culated for whole rock analyses, for zircon studies a two-

stage TDM age is needed (Nebel et al. 2007).

The TDM age in zircon is calculated from the ini-

tial Hf isotopic composition of the zircon, using an av-

erage crustal Lu/Hf ratio. The initial Hf composition

of zircon represents the 176Hf/177Hf value calculated at

the time the zircon crystallized, namely the U-Pb age

previously obtained on the same crystal. Such model

ages indicate the crustal residence time for the rocks that

hosted the zircon.

It is evident the importance to carry out U-Pb and

Lu-Hf measurements on the same portion of a zircon

grain, in order to be able to recalculate the ?Hf and Hf

TDM values at the time of its crystallization.

ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES

INSTRUMENTATION AND LA MC-ICP-MASS

SPECTROMETRY

In this study we use a Thermo Neptune MC-ICP-MS in-

strument equipped with an array of eight moveable Fara-

day collectors (L4, L3, L2, L1, H1, H2, H3, H4) and one

fixed center collector (C), which supports a Faraday and

a Secondary Electron Multiplier (SEM). The Neptune is

also equipped with six Multiple Ion Counting (MICs),

four of these associated to the L4 Faraday and two asso-

ciated to the L3 and H4 Faradays, respectively.

All the measurements were performed in a static

multi-collection and low mass resolution mode. The Far-

adays configuration for Lu-Hf measurements are shown

in Table I.

Standard Solutions Analyses

In terms of signal stability, the ICP-MS solution sys-

tem (solution sample) has more accuracy than laser ab-

lation analyses; so, before starting the laser ablation ses-

sions, we routinely calibrate the spectrometer with so-

lutions. For this reason, the first objective in the de-

velopment of this systematic has been to prepare a Hf

standard solution.

For the preparation of the Hf standard solution, the

SRM reference material JMC475, available as oxide –

HfO2, has been used. Firstly, we dissolved 100 mg of

HfO2 oxide in fluorhydric and nitric acid (HF+HNO3)

to complete dissolution. Then, we prepared a 1000 ppm

stock solution and, starting from this, a 1 ppm sub-stock

solution and a 200 ppb solution for analyses have been

produced.

With the aim to test the corrections for Lu and Yb

isobaric interference and mass-bias fractionation, a por-

tion of the prepared JMC475 standard solution has been

doped with a known quantity of Yb and Lu, obtaining a

new standard solution with Yb/Hf=0.02 and Lu/Hf=0.02.

At the beginning of each analytical session, the JMC475

standard solution is ran to calibrate the instrument until

the reported values of 176Hf/177Hf are achieved.

The JMC475 isotopic values of Hf reported in the

literature (Wu et al. 2006, Chu et al. 2002) were repro-

duced within error margins. In Figure 1 a typical result

for a 240 cycles analysis of JMC475 standard solution

is shown.

Laser Ablation Analyses

— Sample Preparation

Zircons are separated with density and gravimetric meth-

ods, and the preparation of polished mounts of epoxy

resin with a number of zircon ranging from 10 to 100,

depending on the purpose of the analysis, is carried out.

As explained before, the measurement of Lu-Hf iso-

topes on zircons is made on a crystal previously analyzed

by laser ablation U-Pb method to obtain age information.

Spatially, the two spot analyses have to be as close as pos-

sible in order to analyze portions of the zircon grain with

the same isotopic characteristics.

Before the in situ analysis, we should obtain as more

information as possible about the structure of the zircon,

such as zoning composition, growth pattern and pres-

ence of inherited core. It should prevent to analyses of

portions of the zircon with different Hf and Pb isotopic

compositions that would generate misleading results.

The best methods to obtain images of the internal

structure of zircon on polished surfaces are the Cathodo-

luminescence (CL) and the Back-Scattered Electrons

(BSE) techniques. For the Lu-Hf method, the BSE im-

agery is preferable because the brightness of the image

is atomic mass dependent and, for that, it is possible to

easily discriminate regions with different Hf content in

the same zircon crystal. Higher brightness in the image

corresponds to higher Hf contents in the zircon (Han-

char and Miller 1993, Corfu et al. 2003).

— Laser Settings

For U-Pb method, we utilized the laser configuration de-

scribed in Bühn et al. (2009), which employ a a raster

ablation generated by a moving laser spot with a diam-

eter of 30 ?m. As the raster ablation does not consume

much material and produce a low deep hole on the zir-

con surface, in some case it is possible to do the Lu-Hf

analyses in the same local of the previous U-Pb analyses.

For Lu-Hf method, we chose a laser configuration

following the most recent literature (Gerdes and Zeh

2006, 2009). The ablation geometry that we used is a

laser spot of 40 to 55 ?m (Fig. 2), which, while reduc-

ing the spatial resolution, permits to ablate more material

for a higher signal. To improve the stability of the sig-

nal, we chose a low laser frequency of about 5-7 Hz.

The power of the laser used during the analytical session

depends mainly on the Hf contents of the analyzed zir-

cons, especially the standard one. In our case, using th

GJ standard zircon, we used a power of about 40-50%,

which corresponds to an energy of 1-3 J/cm2.

Helium flux is used to transport the ablated mate-

rial from the zircon in the sample chamber to the MC-

ICP-MS: a flux of about 0.38-0.46 lit/min is utilized de-

pending on the values of the other laser parameters. The

Helium flux has to be calibrated together with the Sam-

SAMPLES

Three different standard zircons (GJ-1, TEMORA 2 and

UQ-Z) have been analyzed by laser ablation to repro-

(i) GJ-1 zircon standard (Jackson et al. 2004) provided

by the ARC National Key Centre for Geochemical Evo-

lution and Metallogeny of Continents (GEMOC), Aus-

tralia; this is a gem-quality zircon crystal of about 0.7 cm

in diameter, which was broken and prepared for analy-

sis; (ii) Temora 2 (Black et al. 2004), provided by Lance

from the Middledale gabbroic diorite in the Eastern

centrate; iii) UQ-Z (Machado et al. 1996) provided by

Alfonso Schrank, UNICAMP, Brazil. With the aim to

characterize an in-house standard zircon for U-Pb and

Lu-Hf methods, a gem-type zircon from Madagascar

(sample MADA) has been also analyzed. This zircon

was provided by the Mineralogy Museum of Pisa Uni-

versity, Italy. For an example of geological application,

two complex zircons from a paleoproterozoic migmatite

from the Borborema Province were analyzed.

RESULTS

DATA REDUCTION

U-Pb

The analyses have been carried out using raster abla-

tion method (Bühn et al. 2009) to prevent laser induced

mass bias fractionation. The U-Pb raw data are trans-

lated to an Excel spreadsheet for data reduction and,

when necessary, we corrected the laser induced mass

bias using the method of Košler et al. (2002). Com-

mon lead (204Pb) interference and background correc-

tion, when necessary were carried out by monitoring the
202Hg and 204 mass (204Hg+204Pb) during the analyti-

cal sessions and using a model Pb composition (Stacey

and Kramers 1975) when necessary. Reported errors

are propagated by quadratic addition
[
(2SD2+2SE2)1/2

]

of external reproducibility and within-run precision: the

external reproducibility is represented by the standard

deviation (SD) obtained by repeated analyses (n=20,

? 0.8% for 207Pb/206Pb and ? 1% for 206Pb/238U) of

standard zircon GJ-1, performed during analytical ses-

sion, and the within-run precision is represented by the

standard error (SE) that was calculated for each analy-

sis. Concordia diagrams (2? error ellipses), concordia

ages and lower and upper intercept ages were calculated

using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig 2001).

Lu-Hf

The acquired Lu and Hf isotope data are corrected on-

line for mass bias fractionation and isobaric interfer-

ences. Successively, the isotope ratios are translated to

an Excel spreadsheet, for calculation of the parameters

of geologic interest, as ?Hf and Hf TDM model age. The

signals of the interference-free isotopes 171Yb, 173Yb

and 175Lu are monitored during the analyses in order

to remove isobaric interferences of 176Yb and 176Lu on
176Hf signal (Table I). The 176Yb and 176Lu contribu-

tion are calculated using the isotopic abundance of Lu

and Hf proposed by Chu et al. (2002). The contempora-

neous measurements of 171Yb, 173Yb permit to correct

the mass bias fractionation of Yb using a 173Yb/171Yb

normalization factor of 1.132685 (Chu et al. 2002). The

Hf isotope ratios are normalized to 179Hf/177Hf value

of 0.7325 (Chu et al. 2002). Our routine laser ablation

measurements consist of 1 block of 40 cycles with an

integration time of 1.034 seconds. For solution anal-

yses, 4 blocks of 40 cycles and an integration time of

4 seconds are employed.

The ?Hf(t) values are calculated using the decay

constant ? = 1.86 * 10?11, proposed by Scherer et al.

(2001) and the 176Lu/177Hf and 176Hf/177Hf CHUR val-

ues of 0.0332 and 0.282772 proposed by Blichert-Toft

and Albaréde (1997). The two stages depleted mantle

Hf model ages (TDM Hf) are calculated using 176Lu/
177Hf=0.0384 and 176Hf/177Hf=0.28325 for the de-

pleted mantle (Chauvel and Blichert-Toft 2001) and
176Lu/177Hf value of 0.0113 for the average crust (Tay-

lor and McLennan 1985, Wedepohl 1995).

STANDARD ZIRCON ANALYSES

The GJ-1 zircon standard has been analyzed over a pe-

riod of about six months. The obtained Hf isotopic

compositions yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282022±11 (2SD,

n=56), reproducing within the error margins the values

reported in literature by several authors (Elhlou et al.

2006, Zeh et al. 2007). The Temora-2, UQ-Z zircon

standards and MADA zircon have been analyzed in sev-

eral analytical sessions. The obtained results are listed

in Table II. The Temora-2 isotopic composition yielded
176Hf/177Hf=0.282693±14 (2SD, n=25), in agreement

with the values reported in the literature by Woodhead

et al. (2004), Hawkesworth and Kemp (2006) and Wu et

al. 2006.

The analyses carried out on the UQ-Z zircons stan-

dard yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282127±33 (2SD, n=11),

for the analyzed grain shows that it is very homoge-

neous in terms of Hf content, do not showing any in-

ternal structures. The Hf analyses carried out in differ-

ent parts of the grain yielded 176Hf/177Hf=0.282352±22

EXAMPLE OF GEOLOGICAL APPLICATION

We present an application study of the in situ combined

U-Pb and Lu-Hf systematic on zircons with LA-(MC)

ICP-MS technique. This study has been chosen to show

the potential of the Lu-Hf LA-MC-ICP-MS systematic

on zircon as a powerful tool for reconstructing the tec-

tonic evolution of a cratonic area.

The studied zircons have been separated from a leu-

cocratic portion of migmatitic rock from the Rio Grande

do Norte terrain in the Borborema Province. Images of

the selected zircons in backscattered electrons (BSE)

mode were obtained using a Scanning Electron Micro-

probe (SEM) in order to have information on the internal

structure of the studied zircons. In this contribution, we

employ the BSE technique using a Scanning Electron

Microscope (SEM) JOEL of the laboratory of the Fed-

eral Police of Brasília.

The BSE images permitted us to differentiate Hf-

rich and Hf-poor portions of zircons, characterized by

high and low brightness response, respectively.

The studied zircons show a typical flat shaped meta-

morphic morphology and complex internal structures

(Fig. 3), with well developed zoning with an euhedral

Hf-rich core rimmed by a Hf-poor rim.

We analyzed the selected zircons with combined U-

Pb and Lu-Hf in situ LA-MC-ICP-MS technique (Ta-

bles III and IV). Every portion of each zircon grains

showing peculiar and distinctive characteristics based on

the interpretation of BSE images has been analyzed. Ini-

tial Hf composition for each zircon has been calculated

using the U-Pb age of the correspondent spot. For old

discordant zircons, it was assumed that 207Pb/206Pb age

represents the crystallization age, whereas for younger

zircons the 206Pb/238U was considered. The Lu-Hf data

are shown in Table IV.

In Figure 4 the Concordia diagrams for the obtained

data on two zircons are shown. The two analyses of zir-

con 1 (Fig. 4a) define two crystallization events: an older

one defined by a 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057±14 Ma, and a

younger one defined by the concordant age of 578±11.

The U-Pb analyses on zircon 12 also define (Fig. 4b)

two crystallization events individuated by a concordant

analysis of 2024±11 Ma and a by a slightly discordant

analyses with 206Pb/238U age of 606±15 Ma. In Fig-

ure 4c a graphic interpretation of the slightly discordant

rim data for zircon 12 is shown.

The distribution of these younger analyses may be

interpreted in two different ways: i) different extreme

Pb-loss of Paleoproterozic grains induced by a 575 Ma

magmatic event (Dantas et al. 2004) and ii) crystalliza-

tion event at 575 Ma, with discordance for zircon 12

rim possibly caused by an imperfect sample preparation.

In this case, as shown in Figure 4c, it is possible that

the laser accidentally ablated a portion of the older core.

The total signal of such analysis, representing a mix-

ing of two different portions of the zircons, would be

plotted on a discordia line defined by the two different

(end-members) U-Pb isotopic compositions.

The Hf results are listed in Table IV and shown in

the diagram of Figure 5a-b. The zircon 1 shows very

homogeneous Hf composition with 176Hf/177Hf ratios

? 2.05 Ga in magmas characterized by an important

crustal signature. These magmas may have been formed

by partial melting of an older juvenile crust generated

at 2.5-2.8 Ga or, alternatively, may represent juvenile

magmas generated at 2.0-2.2 Ga and contaminated by

older (Archean) crustal material. In the diagrams of Fig-

ure 5a-b, the evolution of Hf isotopic composition (cal-

culated for Lu/Hf = 0.0113) for different types of Paleo-

proterozoic to Archean juvenile crust are reported.

The Hf isotopic composition of Neoproterozic rims

suggests that they could not crystallized in magma de-

rived by partial melting of a 2.0-2.2 Ga Paleoprotero-

zoic crust, represented by the older core of the stud-

ied zircons. To produce the measured Hf composition

(?Hf(t) ? 35, TDM &gt; 3.2 Ga) of the young rims, a more

radiogenic isotopic component, derived from earlier (or

older) Archean crust, has to be involved during the crys-

tallization of the outer part of the studied zircons.

recognised in the Borborema Province (Dantas et al. 2004). Dotted lines (Fig. 5a) indicate the ?Hf(t)

On the other hand, the zircons are characterized by

practically the same values of 176Hf/177Hf ratio at the

rim and the core. In the diagrams of Figure 5a, the

Hf composition of the rims plot on the Hf isotopic evo-

lution curve of the core portions of the same zircons,

calculated from the measured 176Lu/177Hf. Thus, these

younger rims may be interpreted as a recrystallization of

zoic high metamorphic/migmatitic event. This process

would have reset almost entirely the U-Pb system, leav-

ing unaltered the Hf isotopic composition.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we described the systematic developed in

the laboratory of geochronology of the University of

Brasília for the combined in situ U-Pb and Lu-Hf anal-

yses on zircons by LA-MC-ICP-MS. The Hf isotopic

compositions for three zircon standards have been mea-

sured. The 176Hf/177Hf values for GJ-1 and TEMORA-2

reported in the literature by several authors have been re-

produced, within error margin. The Lu-Hf isotopic com-

position for the zircon standard UQ-Z and for a in-house

zircon standard is reported.

New U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data were obtained

for two zircons selected from a migmatitic rock from

the Borborema Province. The U-Pb, Lu Hf in situ anal-

yses, combined with BSE imaging, permitted to study

in detail the internal isotopic composition of the zircons

and to obtain information about the growing history of

each zircon. On the basis of U-Pb and Lu-Hf data, two

main crystallization events have been identified in both

studied zircons. An older event at ca. 2.05 Ga that was

recognized in the core portions of the zircons represents

a well characterized Paleoproterozoic magmatic event

that affected the whole Borborema Province. A second

younger crystallization event at ? 575 Ma, which gen-

erated the rim portions of the zircons, would represent a

high grade metamorphic-magmatic, in agreement with

previous geochronological data obtained by other au-

thors (Dantas et al. 2004) on monazite (TIMS) from a

granite outcropping in the same region.

RESUMO

O sistema isotópico Lutécio-Hafnio representa uma das fer-

ramentas mais recentes e poderosas para estudos isotópicos e

geocronológicos. Análises combinadas in situ de U-Pb e Lu-Hf

sobre zircão pelo LA-MC-ICP-MS permitem caracterizar iso-

topicamente o magma onde ele cristalizou, fornecendo valiosas

informações para estudos de proveniência de sedimento e de

evolução crustal. Nesse trabalho descrevemos a sistemática

de Lu-Hf pelo LA-MC-ICP-MS implantada no laboratório de

Geocronologia da Universidade de Brasília e reportamos os re-

sultados obtidos de repetidas análises de três padrões de zircão:

GJ-1 = 0.282022 ± 11 (2SD, n=56), Temora 2 = 0.282693 ±

14 (2SD, n=25) and UQ-Z = 0.282127 ± 33 (2SD, n=11). Foi

também caracterizada a razão isotópica 176Hf/177Hf (0.282352

± 22, 2SD, n=14) de um zircão usado como padrão interno

do laboratório. Como aplicação geológica, analisamos dois

zircões complexos selecionados a partir de uma amostra de

migmatito da Província de Borborema, NE do Brasil. Sobre a

base dos dados U-Pb e Lu-Hf foram identificados em ambos os

zircões dois eventos de cristalização. Um evento mais antigo

de 2.05 Ga nos núcleos herdados, representa um evento mag-

mático Paleoproterozoico bem conhecido na Província Bor-

borema. Um segundo evento de ? 575 Ma, reconhecido nas

bordas, representa um evento magmático-metamórfico Neo-

proterozóico (Brasiliano).
