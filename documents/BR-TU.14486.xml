resumo 
 

 

O método de síntese de nanoparticulas 1-D assistido por um modelo tornou-se 
um tópico em voga na química após o desenvolvimento de filmes anódicos com 
poros bem ordenados. Contudo, a maioria dos trabalhos nesta área tem sido 
feita utilizando filmes porosos destacados devido à presença de uma barreira no 
fundo dos poros. No entanto, esta estratégia segue demasiados passos, o que 
aumenta o seu custo, torna mais difícil a execução e impõe várias limitações. 
Consequentemente, existe a necessidade de uma técnica que permita o 
enchimento (electrofilling) dos tubos sem remover a camada barreira – esta tese 
representa o nosso contributo para esse trabalho. Utilizámos uma técnica mais 
simples que permite a electrodeposição e “electrofilling” de nanoestruturas 
directamente nos modelos sobre o substrato metálico, utilizando solventes  
eutécticos profundos à base de cloreto de colina como electrólito. Relativamente 
à água, os solventes eutécticos profundos demonstram superior estabilidade 
térmica e uma janela electroquímica mais alargada, o que aumenta o número 
de materais secundários depositados. 
Como materiais a investigar foram escolhidos titânia e alumina dada a sua 
capacidade para formar estruturas porosas altamente ordenadas, propriedades 
eletroquímicas distintas e uso generalizado em síntese assistida por padrão. O 
estudo aqui apresentado encontra-se dividido em duas etapas. Primeiramente, 
a influência da camada barreira foi investigada em sistemas modelo através da 
utilização de filmes barreira densos na superfície dos elétrodos. Para os filmes 
de alumina e titânia, identificaram-se vários parâmetros que afectam a 
electrodeposição, dos quais se destacam a influência da voltagem de 
anodização, a espessura da camada de barreira, a dupla camada eléctrica e o 
perfil de corrente. Durante esta etapa detectaram-se efeitos nefastos, como a 
formação de uma densa camada orgânica na superfície do eléctrodo, que foram 
ultrapassados aumentando a temperatura ou alternando o potencial aplicado. 
A segunda etapa consistiu em passar de elétrodos planos (primeira etapa) para 
modelos porosos (segunda etapa). Foi realizado, com sucesso, o 
preenchimento dos poros de alumina e dos poros de titânia. Parâmetros como 
o perfil de corrente, temperatura de solução, entre outras, foram ajustadas para 
melhorar o fator de preenchimento e a homogeneidade do preenchimento. Foi 
desenvolvido um processo de preenchimento de moldes de alumina anódica em 
duas etapas, nucleação AC (1º passo) e preenchimento galvanostático (2º 
passo). Foram utilizadas três condições diferentes de modelos de titânia anódica 
porosa no “electrofilling”. O primeiro é sem modificação e demonstrou que a 
electroredução do zinco ocorre de forma aleatória ao longo de todo o 
comprimento do poro, o que leva ao fecho do poro e a um enchimento não 
homogéneo. A segunda modificação, cristalização total por têmpera, permite a 
preparação de estruturas coaxiais devido à deposição uniforme de zinco nas 
paredes dos poros. A última modificação foi a cristalização selectiva do fundo 
do poro. Foi descoberto que uma anodização adicional em eletrólitos não 
agressivos leva à cristalização da parte barreira dos tubos (fundo) e, 
consequentemente, a maior condutividade na parte inferior do que nas paredes. 
Este efeito permite um enchimento ascendente dos modelos porosos de titânia. 
As estratégias aqui apresentadas alargam a gama de possibilidades para a 
aplicação de modelos porosos anódicos na electrodeposição de diferentes 
nanoestruturas.

abstract 

 
The template assisted method of 1-D nanoparticles synthesis has become a hot 
topic in Chemistry after the development of high-ordered porous anodic films. 
Most studies in this field have focused on the use of detached porous films due 
to the presence of the barrier layer on the pore bottom. However, this strategy 
follows a great number of steps, which raises its cost while decreasing 
convenience of operation and imposing several limitations. Consequently, there 
is a need for a technique which allows electrofilling of tubes without removing the 
barrier layer – this thesis represents our contribution to that enterprise. We have 
devised a simpler technique which allows electrodeposition of nanostructures 
directly in the templates on metallic substrate, using choline chloride based deep 
eutectic solvents (DES) as electrolyte. Compared to water, DES have improved 
thermal stability and a wider electrochemical window, dramatically increasing the 
number of possible secondary materials deposited. 
Titania and alumina were chosen as materials under study due to their known 
capacity to form highly-ordered porous structures, different electrochemical 
profiles and widespread use in template assisted synthesis. The present work is 
divided in two parts. First, the influence of the barrier layer has been investigated 
by using dense barrier films on the electrode surface as a model system. For 
both alumina and titania films, several parameters affecting the electrodeposition 
of zinc have been identified, notably the influence of the anodization voltage, 
barrier layer thickness, electrical double layer and current profile. During this 
stage, some negative effects have been detected, such as a dense organic layer 
formation on electrode surface, a hurdle which has been overcome by either 
increasing the temperature or applying the alternating potential. 
The second stage consisted in transferring the method from the flat electrodes 
(the first stage) to the porous templates. The successful filling of both porous 
alumina and porous titania, has been achieved. Parameters such as current 
profile, solution temperature, among others, have been tuned to improve the fill 
factor and homogeneity of the filling. A two-step porous anodic alumina template 
filling with AC nucleation (1st step) and galvanostatic filling (2nd step) has been 
developed. Three different types of porous anodic titania templates have been 
used for electrofilling. The first one was used as-prepared, showing that zinc 
electroreduction occurs in random places along all pore length, resulting in pore 
sealing and non-homogeneous filling. The second modification, full 
crystallization by annealing, allows the preparation of coaxial structures due to 
uniform zinc deposition on the pore walls. The last modification is selective 
bottom crystallization. It has been found that additional anodization in 
unaggressive electrolytes leads to crystallization of the barrier (bottom) part of 
the tubes and, thus, to higher conductivity of the bottom part than that of the 
walls. This effect allows a bottom-up filling of the titania porous template. 
The strategies presented here widen the range of possibilities for the application 
of porous anodic templates in the electrodeposition of different nanostructures.

The main objective of this work is the electrodeposition of 1-D nanoparticles in 

porous anodic templates. The main idea is to find a possible way of formation of nanorods 

by direct electrodeposition in porous non-detached oxide matrixes, avoiding expensive 

and time consuming steps such as substrate removal, pores opening and contact 

sputtering. The negative feature of the barrier layer on the pores bottoms is vanished by 

templates modification or by application of a specific current profile. 

This PhD thesis reports a part of the work on the metal electrodeposition that has 

been performed during the last four years. For the template investigation, step-by-step 

analysis has been used. Different approaches were used in order to achieve the 

homogeneous pores electrofilling. Some of them either had a negative effect or resulted 

in no visible effect, while others were found to enhance the electrodeposition process.  

The work is divided into seven chapters. The first one demonstrates the state of 

the art related to objects of the thesis and gives useful information concerning those 

subjects. The second chapter provides information about the performed experimental 

work and about the experimental techniques that were applied. Detailed description of 

the procedures, which were used in this work, is presented in the corresponding individual 

chapters. 

The core results are presented in chapters III-VI. These chapters are constituted 

by the published papers starting from the oldest to the newest. Chapters III and IV report 

the investigation of the anodic alumina oxide. The chapter III describes the two-step 

technique of filling the anodic alumina pores with zinc. The importance of application of 

the pulse nucleation step and the galvanostatic step is shown in detail. Chapter IV contains 

experimental data on the influence of the alumina barrier layer on the electrochemical 

reduction processes. In this work, the impacts of several parameters such as film 

thickness, temperature of the solution, additional sinusoidal potential oscillation, have 

been demonstrated. An evidence of formation of a dense organic layer on the 

alumina/electrolyte interface which hindered the zinc reduction and a possible way to 

avoid the obstacles caused by this layer are given in the chapter. 

Results presented in chapters V and VI correspond to studies carried out on anodic 

titania. In the same way, initially, the planar anodic film on the titanium interface has 

been investigated in terms of influence of both the oxide film thickness and the 

anodization voltage on the nucleation processes and kinetics of zinc reduction (chapter 

V). Then, based on the results presented in the chapter V, several possible template 

modifications were studied and successfully used for filling of the porous titania

templates. The modifications such as annealing and selective bottom crystallization are 

described and characterized in the chapter VI. The chapter also gives a description of the 

filling of the modified templates. The results reported in chapters III-VI have been 

published in SCI peer reviewed journals in the area of Electrochemistry. 

The last chapter (chapter VII) summarizes the general conclusions of the work 

and shows possible future activities in the area of anodic films and ionic liquids.

Thales, a Greek philosopher, discovered that if amber was rubbed with a woollen 

fabric it started to attract light items such as small pieces of wood, feathers and leaves. 

He was among the first to develop electricity in VI B.C. century. Nevertheless, two 

thousand years after that, knowledge about the electricity was hardly progressed at all. A 

new wave of studies in the field started in the beginning of XVII century. There was a 

considerable number of scientists who tried to explore the phenomenon. Particularly, Otto 

Von Guericke created the first electrical machine, Stephen Gray developed the conception 

of conductors and nonconductors, Pieter Van Musschenbroek discovered the principle of 

the Leyden jar (the first capacitor). Only in 1746, an American philosopher and statesman 

Benjamin Franklin suggested the single-fluid theory of electricity. In 1775, after the work 

of Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta announced the construction of the voltaic pile, the 

first electric battery, which transforms chemical energy to electrical energy. The main 

laws of electricity, such as Ampere law, that explained the nature of electric current, Ohm 

law, Faraday’s law and many others, were developed during the next 50 years. The 

decomposition process of a compound by electricity was named “electrolysis” by Faraday 

in 1833. Furthermore, he discovered the laws of electrochemical decomposition: “the 

amount decomposed by an electrical current is proportional to the current flowing and to 

the time during which it flows; and when an electrolyte, or a series of electrolytes, is 

decomposed by an electric current, the components into which it is separated are always 

chemically equivalent”. This moment can be considered the origin of Electrochemistry 

[1].  

1. Valve metals 

Application of anodic potential to a metallic electrode in water based electrolyte 

initiates the oxygen evolution. There is an additional process, namely the oxide layer 

formation on all metals, even before reaching the oxygen evolution potential [2]. These 

oxides can be divided into three groups. The first group is commonly formed on noble 

metals such as platinum, gold, iridium, ruthenium etc. and all of them are highly 

conductive oxides. The oxide layers with semiconductor properties (on nickel, tungsten, 

titanium, molybdenum etc.) belong to the second group. According to the same logic, the 

last group consists of the oxides with insulator properties, such as oxides of the valve 

metals: aluminium, tantalum, zirconium etc. The oxide layer formation is the main

reaction that takes place during anodic polarization of the third metals group (valve 

metals) [2]. 

There is a variety of factors that can influence formation of the oxide layer on the 

electrode interface (so-called passivation), for example, metal nature, composition of the 

electrolyte and electrochemical conditions. Alteration of these parameters (electrode 

material, solution composition, potential and current density, temperature of the solution 

etc.) will affect the electrochemical reaction on the anode.  

Figure I. 1 shows the typical linear potential sweep curve from open circuit 

potential to anodic values. Initial potential growth leads to increasing of dissolution rate. 

However, after reaching the critical current, dissolution almost stops and further potential 

growth does not influence current significantly. The voltage with the highest current of 

dissolution is named a primary passivation potential, while the highest current is named 

the critical corrosion current. The current will start rising sharply at more positive 

potential, named breakdown potential. The second current increase occurs because of 

dielectric, chemical or structural film breakdown accompanied by intense electrolyte 

decomposition and dissolution of electrode material [2]. The stable region with a very 

low current density is a passive region. The barrier layer forms at this potential range. It 

is similar to the chemical barrier layers, such as those grown on iron in concentrated nitric 

solution or on aluminium in air, which block further reactions [2]. The biggest advantage 

of the valve metals is a high breakdown potential (wide passive region (Figure I. 1 dotted 

line)) which can be up to several hundred volts.

Figure I. 1 The typical current/potential dependence of anodic polarization with 

passivation behaviour. 

It is possible to obtain various processes by changing voltage that subsequently 

leads to different types of surfaces on the electrode. All of these regimes are actively used 

for broad-ranging applications, for instance electropolishing [3, 4], metal passivation [5, 

6], plasma electrolytic oxidation [7-9], porous anodic template formation [10-12].  

1.1 Dense anodic films 

As it was mentioned before, the valve metals have a wide passive region. At this 

potential range oxide thickness grows as the voltage increases. It leads to thick film 

formation if there are no aggressive ions capable to dissolve oxide [2]. 

The barrier anodic film forms via ions migration. As shown in Figure I. 2, metallic 

cation and oxygen anion migrate through the oxide layer in the opposite directions: from 

the metal surface to the oxide/electrolyte interface and from electrolyte to the metal, 

correspondingly. Cations combine with anions and form metal oxide [5]. The anodic 

reaction is the following: 

 

M + zH2O - 2ze
- ? MOz + 2zH+ (I.1)

Figure I. 2 Schematic representation of the barrier anodic film formation on a metal 

surface. 

Ideally, the barrier layer is a non-porous oxide film both electrons and ions 

conductive, although ions move only at high electric field strength [13]. The barrier layers 

are commonly characterized by low electronic, but high ionic conductivity. It means that 

ionic conductivity is predominant in this type of films and anodization will occur until 

the ionic current flow stops. The different factors, such as the electric field strength, nature 

of the metal and metal oxide, influence the ionic current. It is also clear that the resulting 

film thickness depends on the relation between the electric field and the ionic current 

density [13]. This relation is named an anodization ratio (oxide thickness nanometres per 

volt, nm V-1). The oxide film thickness can be approximately calculated by multiplying 

the anodization ratio by the applied potential. Unfortunately, the anodization ratio 

strongly depends on the electrode material, the solution composition, temperature, 

applied current etc. The typical anodizing ratios for different valve metals are present in 

Table I. 1.

1.1.1 Anodic alumina film 

The history of the dense anodic film on aluminium has started more than 100 years 

ago. Over the course of decades aluminium and aluminium alloys attract a lot of attention 

due to the surface barrier layer. The layer protects the main metallic part from corrosion. 

It was found that the Al and Al-based alloys have a better corrosion resistance than that 

of iron and steels. Moreover, such property of the aluminium alloys as low density, makes 

it attractive for aircraft industry. After development of chemical- and electropolishing, 

aluminium surfaced are intensively used as reflectors. Additionally, a possibility to 

prepare anodic alumina films with different colours opens a wide prospect for its 

application in decoration. Since recently, anodic alumina films are intensively studied for 

creation metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor devices, which can be 

used as sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguides [23, 24] and supercapacitors [25, 26]. 

Application of a positive potential to the aluminium electrode in a suitable, i.e. 

aggressive ions free, electrolyte such as ammonium pentaborate and ammonium citrate, 

leads to formation of compact and adherent film of the anodic alumina on the electrode 

interface according to the aforementioned general mechanism. After formation of the 

oxide monolayer, the oxidation should stop because of insulator properties of the alumina. 

Nevertheless, the barrier layer continue growing owing to ions migration in the high 

electric field. Obviously, continuous growth of the oxide requires continuous voltage 

increasing, otherwise the film becomes too thick and the anodic current flow stops [5]. 

The typical I(t) curve for barrier layer formation at constant potential is presented in 

Figure I. 3.

Figure I. 3 Typical current – time transient obtained at constant potential for barrier 

layer formation. 

As it was specified in Table I. 1, the anodization ratio for alumina is about 1.4 nm 

V-1, which matches to the high electric field, values higher than 7x106 V cm-1 [27]. The 

thickness of the barrier layer can reach 0.7 µm at voltage of about 500 V [28]. 

Unfortunately, higher voltage is problematic to achieve because of electrical breakdown 

of a film. 

The structure of the obtained film depends on temperature, applied voltage, 

solution composition etc. [13] The electron diffraction study has been done by Harrington 

and Nelson [29] for anodic alumina film formed at different electrolytes. The results 

showed that films are amorphous. The influence of temperature was investigated by 

several researchers. Firstly, it was reported by Taylor et al. [30] in 1945 that films remain 

amorphous independently on the electrolyte used up 100 V of anodization. Application 

of a higher voltage leads to formation of ?-Al2O3 phase detected by XRD. 15 years later, 

similar conclusions were made by Stirland and Bicknell [31]. They used the electron 

diffraction for the film examination. The authors found that at a voltage below 100 V the 

barrier film is absolutely amorphous. The films prepared at a voltage above 100 V 

remained mostly amorphous, but some ?-alumina phase was also detected. 

Composition of the barrier layer depends on the electrolyte used because of the 

anions incorporation. In conformity with the ions nature, Thompson et al. [32, 33] divided 

all anions in three groups: 

? mobile inwards (phosphate, sulfate); 

? immobile (borate, silicate); 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

13 

 

? mobile outwards (tungstate, molybdate); 

The ions from the first group incorporate into the layer and migrate inside the film 

under electric field because of their negative charge. The immobile species are adsorbed 

on the electrode surface and afterwards they incorporate into the film as oxide (B2O3 and 

SiO2). The species from the third group move from the inner part of the oxide to the 

alumina/electrolyte interface. This tendency can be explained by anions oxidation to 

cations during anodization with subsequent cations movement in the same direction with 

Al3+ under the influence of electric field [32]. Thompson et al. [32] obtained the 

incorporation level of the electrolyte species in the range of 0.6 – 5.5 at%. Moreover, the 

amount of incorporated ions also depends on the anodization voltage and the electrolyte 

temperature. It was shown by Mason [34] that at higher current density and lower solution 

temperature the anodic film was richer in extra species. The same behavior was found for 

barrier film on tantalum and niobium [35]. The preparation of a relatively pure anodic 

alumina layer is described by Skeldon et al. [36]. The authors used potassium hydroxide 

solution as electrolyte. Since the only OH- anions were present, the obtained film was free 

of additional elements.  

Although in some cases, the water incorporation during the film formation can be 

detected, but nonporous films are generally observed to be anhydrous. The amount of 

incorporated water is determined by the formation conditions. Furthermore, no water is 

incorporated in a free form, commonly it is hydroxide or hydrated oxide [13].  

1.1.2 Anodic titania film 

Titanium standard potential value is almost equal to that of aluminium: -1.63 V 

and -1.66 V for Ti/Ti2+ and Al/Al3+, correspondingly. Thereby, Ti is a very active metal, 

although shows typical properties of the valve metals. Titanium does not corrode in air 

only due to thin oxide film on the interface which forms immediately after a contact with 

oxygen. The titanium dioxide films have distinguished properties, namely catalytic and 

photocatalytic [37, 38], self-cleaning and wetting [39]. The TiO2 films find use in solar 

cells [40] and optical devices [41]. 

Generally, anodic titania and alumina are resembling materials, for example, the 

mechanism of the titania formation is comparable to that of alumina and other barrier 

films. At the same time, alumina is an insulator as, while titania is a n-type semiconductor 

with a comparatively high electronic conductivity. Therefore, there are two reactions that

simultaneously. The first, titanium oxidation, occurs with ionic current under high electric 

field and is responsible for the film growth: 

Ti + 2H2O ?TiO2 + 4H
+ + 4e- (I.2) 

The second one is the oxygen oxidation on the barrier/electrolyte interface 

(electronic current) and does not contribute to the film growth [42]. 

The number of possible electrolytes applicable for the titania film formation is 

much bigger than those available for alumina preparation because of titania insensitivity 

to different aggressive ions. Hwang and Hwang [43] have studied kinetics of the titanium 

anodization in a 0.5M sulfuric acid. The authors applied atomic absorption spectroscopy 

for calculation of the titanium concentration in the solution after anodization and 

concluded that the dissolution rate is exiguous. There are series of publications reporting 

on successful preparation of thin titania layers in sulfuric acid with different 

concentrations [18, 44, 45], phosphoric acid [44, 46], sodium hydroxide [45] etc. During 

the film formation the electrolyte anions migrate inside the titania film in the same manner 

as described above for the case of aluminium anodization. Moreover, the nature and 

concentration of the solution affect not only the final composition of the titania layer, but 

also the oxide growth behaviours. Sul et al. [47] investigated properties of anodic oxide 

layer as function of current density, the electrolyte compositions and concentrations, and 

temperature. All of these parameters have a significant influence on anodic formation 

factor, current efficiency, anodic forming voltage and oxide forming rate. Moreover, the 

formation rate was found to have a strong impact on surface properties of the layer. 

Blackwood et al. [48] found that a higher formation rate results in a higher defect 

concentration. The dielectric constant is also affected by the growth rate. 

The regime of film preparation influences the crystallinity of the film. There are 

three main characteristics determining the film crystallinity, namely temperature, current 

and voltage. The crystalline state of an anodic oxide film on titanium was found to be 

dependent on the formation potential and the electrolyte temperature (Shibata and Zhu 

[49]). Film crystallization occurs at potentials that are more positive than 7.0 V or at 

temperatures above 333 K. Ohtsuka et al. also confirmed that at some critical voltage, 

amorphous titania transforms to crystalline anatase phase [50]. Furthermore, the solution 

concentration is critical for the titania crystal structure. Diamanti and Pedeferri [51] 

investigated the influence of oxidation parameters on the anodic titanium dioxide layer. 

The authors have demonstrated that at higher potential titania became more crystalline as

it was also shown in Shibata and Ohtsuka works. Moreover, a film growth at lower current 

density and/or at lower concentration of the electrolyte results in a smaller fraction of 

anatase in the oxide.  

1.2 Porous anodic templates 

In the electrolytes that contain aggressive ions, porous oxide film and not only 

dense barrier layers form (Figure I. 4). The ions considered as aggressive are different for 

different metals. For instance, porous alumina film can be easily prepared in oxalic, 

sulphuric, phosphoric and tartaric acids containing solutions. However, most of the valve 

metals demand the presence of the fluoride anions in the electrolyte. Oxidation of 

titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tungsten, thallium, vanadium and even iron in the 

appropriate electrolytes is accompanied with formation of porous oxide layers. Moreover, 

optimization of the anodization conditions such as electrolyte composition, voltage, 

temperature, results in formation of ordered pores, which are arranged perpendicularly to 

the substrate (Figure I. 4).  

 

Figure I. 4 Valve metals electrooxidation, depending on solution composition, occurs 

with formation of dense barrier or porous anodic film. 

The porous anodic templates on transition metals have ubiquitous applications due 

to the electronic, chemical and optical properties. For example, ZrO2, WO3, Al2O3, Ta2O5, 

TiO2 etc. have promising properties, which allow them to be used in many application 

such as solar energy conversion [52, 53], energy [54] and data [55] storage, as well as in 

optical [55, 56], photocatalytic [57-60], biomedical [59], and electrochromic devices [61, 

62]. Moreover, titania shows perfect biocompatibility. This characteristic promotes the 

use of titania in medical technologies, such as in orthopedics and dentistry.

1.2.1 Porous anodic alumina 

Porous anodic alumina has been known since 1953 [63], but it was given a due 

consideration only in 1995, after development of highly ordered hexagonal pore 

structures by Masuda et al. [64]. This material is under active investigation during last 

decades as template or host system for formation of nanostructures such as nanorods, 

nanowires, nanodots, nanotubes etc. 

The porous anodic alumina (PAA) is mainly synthesized in acid base electrolyte 

[55] with pH lower than 5. Low pH is one of the most crucial factors necessary for 

dissolution of the alumina and formation of a porous structure. Different acids and 

mixtures of acids can be used. Some possible electrolytes as well as the anodization 

conditions are presented in Table I. 2 (based on Chu’s et al. work [65]).

Results of the Chu’s et al. work clearly showed ample opportunities of the PAA 

use as a template due to wide ranges of interpore distance, pore diameter and pore density 

[55] (from 108 to 1012 pores cm-2). Three most common conditions used for PAA 

preparation are the following: sulfuric acid at 25 V [66], oxalic acid at 40 V [64] and 

phosphoric acid at 195 V [67, 68].

Furthermore, the pore diameter can be tuned by immersion of the template in acid 

electrolytes without application of any potential. It leads to dissolution of the alumina and 

consequently to pores widening. The typical SEM images of the anodic alumina oxide 

after pore widening are shown in Figure I. 5.

(a) and in a 8 wt% phosphoric acid at 152 V (b) after pore widening in the same 

anodization electrolytes at 40oC for 2.5 and 0.5 h correspondingly. 

The growth mechanism of the self-organized alumina nanopores is still largely 

unknown. Electrochemical reactions are the same for both porous and dense anodic films 

formation, but chemical dissolution takes place only during porous film preparation. The 

cathode reaction is a hydrogen evolution:  

2H+ + 2e- ? H2 (I.3) 

2H2O + 2e
- ? H2 + 2OH

- (I.4) 

Reactions on the anode should be divided in two groups: 

? electrochemical oxidation (at the metal/oxide interface): 

Al0 – 3e- ? Al3+ (I.5) 

2Al0 + 6OH- ? Al2O3 + 3H2O + 6e
- (I.6) 

? chemical and field-enhanced chemical dissolution of the oxide layer in aggressive 

electrolyte (at the oxide/electrolyte interface): 

Al2O3 + 6H
+ ? 2Al3+ + 3H2O (I.7) 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

18 

 

However, simple chemical dissolution will not result in high-ordered film 

formation. Up to date, the most acknowledged mechanisms of ordering are based on 

mechanical stress and field assisted dissolution [69-72]. The pore growth can be separated 

in four successive steps: 

? formation of the compact oxide; 

? random chemical etching; 

? pores nucleation; 

? pores growth in steady-state conditions; 

All the steps reflect to the current time transient which is schematically 

represented on Figure I. 6 and described by Parkhutik [73].  

 

 

Figure I. 6 Typical current time transient obtained during aluminium anodization 

in acid electrolyte (adapted from Parkhutik [73]). 

At the beginning of anodization (zone I), the aluminium surface is being covered 

by dense alumina. Since this bulk alumina film is insulator, it provides fast decreasing of 

the current density. In zone I, the current time transient has the same shape as that of a 

transient when anodizing in a neutral electrolyte. The barrier layer is uniform in large 

scale and the electric field is constant at the whole sample surface at that moment as 

shown in Figure I. 7 a [74]. The next stage is possible only in aggressive electrolyte and 

characterized by increase of the current density (Figure I. 6, zone II). During this stage, 

some pits occur on the oxide surface due to random chemical etching, stress after the 

oxide formation, impurities etc. In these places, alumina layer is thinner than in the rest 

of the film and it results in lower resistance of the film and consequently in higher local

current. Moreover, the electric field is stronger in vicinity of the irregularities of the 

surface. As a result, chemical dissolution, superimposed by field-enhanced dissolution, is 

faster in these pits than in the bulk oxide (Figure I. 7 b). However, not all the surface 

concavities will transform into pores, since some of them will close with time and the 

pore formation will stop. This process corresponds to the small current drop in the zone 

III (Figure I. 6). 

 

 

Figure I. 7 Schematic representation of the alumina pore formation by anodization: 

(a) formation of the planar layer with a uniform thickness; (b) onset of surface 

irregularities that change the field distribution in the layer; (c) initiation of the pore 

growing; (d) pore growing at steady-state conditions; (e) pores self-ordering 

(adapted from Su et al. [74]). 

After the first three stages, the surface is stable and pores grow in a steady-state 

condition. The zone IV corresponds to the stable growth and is characterized by constant 

current density (Figure I. 6). Physically, at this stage, oxidation of the aluminium and 

dissolution of the alumina occur simultaneously, but dissolution of the pore wall is slower 

than that of the bottom barrier, where a stronger electrical field enhances the process 

(Figure I. 7 c, d). This difference in the rates of dissolution leads to pore formation. 

Duration of the pore growth depends on several factors such as type and concentration of 

the electrolyte, voltage, temperature and stirring. At the point, when the rate of chemical 

dissolution of the alumina will be the same as the oxidation rate, the thickness of the 

porous layer is kept constant. This point corresponds to maximal thickness of the template 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich

(it is possible to have thickness higher than 50 µm). All the above described stages were 

observed directly and confirmed by Thompson et al. with the use of TEM [71]. 

Practically, the pores density is high and it could strongly affect the neighbour 

pores (Figure I. 7 e). According to mechanical stress model [68-70, 74], volume of the 

anodic alumina is twice bigger than volume of aluminium which was used for 

anodization. Consequently, the mechanical stresses appear in the oxide/metal interface 

owing to volume enlargement. Repulsive forces between the boundary pores determine 

self-organization in hexagonal structure. 

In principle, ordered anodic alumina template can be manufactured using a single 

step anodization, but it is hardly achievable because of the random pore initiation. In 

1995, Masuda and Fukuda introduced the two-step anodization approach [64] 

schematically represented in Figure I. 8. 

 

Figure I. 8 Schematic representation of the two-step anodization. 

The first anodization is normally performed continuously during several hours. 

This step consists on formation of highly ordered pores structure at the metal/oxide 

interface and the aluminium surface texturing with a long-range order of dimples. 

Nevertheless, the upper part of the obtained porous oxide layer is irregular. After the first 

anodization, the electrode is immersed in a solution which dissolves the anodic alumina 

without any reaction with aluminium substrate. Commonly, solution of chromium (VI) 

oxide in phosphoric acid is used for this aim [75, 76]. The alumina dissolution leads to 

removal of the irregular porous layer and revealing of the periodically arranged dimples 

on the aluminium surface. The second step is normally carried out at the same conditions 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates

as the first one. These ordered dimples form the initiation sites for growth of new pores. 

It excludes any random distribution of pores at the pore nucleation step and the new 

structure has long range order over the whole length of the pores [76-78]. 

Alternatively, pre-textured aluminium surface with controllable interpore distance 

can be manufactured by several techniques, such as mechanical imprinting [79-81], 

focused-ion-beam lithography [82-84], holographic lithography[85]. The key benefit of 

all these techniques is a single step process, which saves time and makes parameters of 

the template fully controllable. Unfortunately, the equipment for the aluminium surface 

pre-texturing is sophisticated and expensive.  

There are several important points to be mentioned regarding the pore ordering. 

One can see, irregularities in pores structure are mainly concentrated in vicinities of the 

aluminium grain boundaries. Therefore, aluminium is annealed at near melting point 

temperature (500-600oC) for several hours in order to increase the grain size and decrease 

the grains boundary thereby decreasing the amount of irregularities. Moreover, the purity 

of aluminium plays an important role because impurities lead to deviation in volume 

expansion of the oxide and, as a result, the disordering of the pores occurs. Furthermore, 

as it was shown before (on example of dimples), the surface roughness affects the pore 

ordering. Consequently, the surface smoothening is preferred and typically performed by 

means of electropolishing in mixture of the perchloric acid and ethanol [86, 87]. 

1.2.2 Porous anodic titania 

Preparation of porous anodic titania has firstly reported by Zwilling et al. in 1999 

[88]. Using a chromic acid electrolytes with hydrofluoric acid, a porous film of about 0.5 

µm thick was obtained. The Zwilling et al. work shows the importance of the fluoride 

ions presence in the electrolyte for manufacturing of the porous layer. In the following 

years, several electrolytes for PAT preparation were used, such as the water based ones 

with sulphate [89], phosphate [90, 91], acetate [92] ions or in organic electrolytes [93] 

which were based on glycerol [94], ionic liquids [95], dimethyl sulfoxide [96]. In all the 

mentioned cases, the electrolytes contained also fluoride ions. Based on those studies, 

several dependences were found. Macak et al. [89] showed that at neutral pH, the 

maximal film thickness is about 2.5 µm while it is ?1 µm [91] when preparing in acid 

electrolyte. Anodization in organic based electrolyte such as ethylene glycol [97, 98] 

results in formation of high-ordered and long (more than 250 µm [98]) tubes with smooth

walls, in contrast to the situation with water based electrolyte, where sidewall ripples were 

found. Furthermore, the two-step technique was used for preparation of high-ordered 

titania tubes in the same manner as described above for the case of porous anodic alumina 

[99].  

The self-ordering and pore formation mechanism of both the porous anodic titania 

and the porous anodic alumina are similar. Initially, the dense barrier layer is formed on 

the electrode interface, then the pores nucleate randomly on the pits and defects followed 

by steady-state pore growth. The similarity of the current time transient and the steps 

during PAT preparation with aluminium oxidation (Figure I. 6) was proved in several 

works [100, 101]. Moreover, SEM studies confirmed that the main steps of PAT 

preparation and PAA preparation are the same.  

Despite the obvious resemblance of the anodization of aluminium and titanium, 

there are some critical distinctions. The reaction on cathode is the same: 

2H+ + 2e- ? H2 (I.8) 

2H2O + 2e
- ? H2 + 2OH

- (I.9) 

Anodic oxidation of titanium occurs by a general mechanism for all valve metals: 

Ti + 2H2O ? TiO2 + 4H
+ + 4e- (I.10) 

However, the pore formation is impossible without dissolution of the oxide, that 

is why fluoride ions are added to solution. Titanium ions form soluble complexes with F- 

and then these species go to the electrolyte. There are two possible ways of the 

complexation: 

? chemical dissolution of the titanium dioxide; 

TiO2 + 6F
- + 4H+ ? [TiF6]

2- + 2H2O  (I.11) 

? direct complexation of the Ti4+ cations on the electrode/electrolyte interface 

Ti4+ + 6F- ? [TiF6]
2- (I.12) 

The pores formation occurs as a result of competition between anodic oxide 

formation and oxide dissolution [53] in which the fluoride ions concentration plays an 

important role. The compact layer only forms at the very low concentration of F- (lower 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

23 

 

than 0.05% (wt.)). When concentration of fluoride ions is higher than 1% (wt.), the 

electropolishing happens due to solubility of the [TiF6]
2- species. Therefore, formation of 

the porous titania layer is only possible at the moderate concentration of the fluorides 

[102, 103]. 

One more distinction between titania and alumina films is the microstructure 

structure. Ordered anodic titania structure is often called tubes and not pores. However, 

the tubes near the bottom are compact and have hexagonal organization which is very 

similar to the pores arrangement in anodic alumina. One can see, that the tubes formation 

from the pores during anodization [99, 102] cannot be explained by a standard 

mechanism. The important step for understanding the difference between PAA and PAT 

was the development of multi-layer structure of a titania pore [104-107]. Schematic 

representation of the pore configuration is shown in Figure I. 9. Albu et al. [105] have 

found three main layers in a pore: 

? outer shell of the tube (OST) mainly formed by TiO2 with a small amount of F
-. 

? inner shell of the tube (IST) formed by titanium oxide and hydroxide and 

containing the electrolyte components. 

? fluoride-rich layer (FLR) formed by TiO2 with a considerable amount of F
-.

and inner (IST) oxide shell and a fluoride-rich layer (FRL); a) ideal condition 

without layer dissolution and b) real condition (adapted from Albu et al. [105]). 

The IST layer is crumbly in comparison to the dense OST one and the IST layer 

is dissolved in electrolyte much easier and faster. Dissolution of the inner shell is 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

24 

 

responsible for formation of a common V-shape of the tube [99, 104-107]. On the other 

hand, the OST layer has almost constant thickness along the whole pore length [105]. 

There is a number of works where the fluoride-rich layer was described as a very thin 

film on the border between titanium substrate and outer shell. The presence of this region 

is in agreement with the anodization mechanism. In high electric field, the negative ions, 

such as O2-, OH-, F-, move through the oxide until the metal interface where they react 

with the substrate. Fluoride ion is very small and its migration occurs much faster than 

oxygen or hydroxide ions, which results in formation of a fluoride-rich layer on the 

metal/oxide interface. The thin layer (FRL) moves from the bottom to the tube walls 

according to the flow concept introduced by Hebert et al. [108]. The model shows that 

the viscous titania drifts up the pore walls induced by the forces which are originated by 

compressive stress and ionic movement. This titania flowing leads to growth of the tubes 

(Figure I. 9 a). It should be also mentioned that, in a real condition, all electrolytes contain 

water and it is mandatory for the titanium oxidation. The water dissolves the IST layer 

together with FLR and exactly because of the solubility of FLR the tube structure forms 

(Figure I. 9 b). Furthermore, Berger et al. [107] studied the influence of water in ethylene 

glycol electrolyte on the growth of the TiO2 tubes. It was confirmed that at low water 

quantity, the dissolution of the fluoride-rich region is limited and tubes have cylindrical 

shape. In contrast, tapered tubes form when quantity of water is too high. 

As-formed titania tubes are commonly amorphous [109]; a nanocrystaline anatase 

phase was detected in the tubes after anodization at relatively high voltage [94]. 

Crystalline state strongly affects properties of the titania layer, such as conductivity [109], 

photoresponse etc. For this reason, a considerable work was performed to investigate 

crystallization of titania films. Anatase and rutile are two main phases which can be 

obtained by annealing under oxidation condition (air or oxygen atmosphere) [89, 105, 

110]. Crystallization of amorphous titania into anatase begins at relatively low 

temperature (250oC) [94, 109, 111]. Increase of temperature up to 450oC results in higher 

concentration of anatase phase. Moreover, annealing at 250oC for a longer time (up to 20 

h) also leads to a significant increase of the anatase fraction [109]. At temperature above 

450oC, the rutile phase is also detected in the layer [109] and at 900oC, titania is 

completely converted to rutile [102].  

Apart from crystalline state and crystal structure, annealing can affect composition 

of oxide film. Thus, reduction of the Ti4+ species to Ti3+, which occurs when annealing 

in inert atmosphere (e.g. in Ar), impacts the conductivity of film. Additionally, it is well-

known that as-prepared nanotubes contain different species from electrolyte, such as 

hydroxide, fluoride, phosphate, carbon etc. These species can be also removed by 

annealing [105, 110]. 

Application of the TiO2 nanostructures is commonly based on some unique 

behaviours of titania such as electronic, ionic and biocompatible. Moreover, the large 

surface area is an important factor as well [102]. For example, biocompatibility of the 

titanium and titanium based alloys allows wide application of these materials as implants. 

The implant surface is independent from the shape and it can be covered by anodic film 

with different tube sizes. It helps to use the best condition for the cell adhesion [112]. 

Moreover, the fast hydroxyapatite formation on the pores surface attracts a lot of attention 

in bone implants [59]. Semiconducting properties of titania nanosructures films found 

applications in photocatalytic [113, 114] and solar cells devices [115, 116].  

1.2.3 Preparation of 1-D nanoparticles through template 

assisted electrodeposition 

Templates assisted electrodeposition is well-priced and one of the most 

convenient technique for 1-D nanoparticles preparation. There is a variety of systems 

used for this aim, for instance Si/SiO2 [117-119], polymer matrix [120, 121]. 

Nevertheless, most of the studies in the area were focused on the porous anodic templates 

due to simplicity of both preparation and parameters control. Unfortunately, their 

application templates for electrosynthesis requires additional modifications. 

A disadvantage of application of porous anodic templates arises from the presence 

of a barrier layer at the bottom of pores. Commonly, the oxide film, formed as a result of 

anodization or immediate oxidation of valve metals, acts as a high resistive medium 

impairing the flow of current. One typical and frequently used template with this kind of 

problem is anodic aluminium oxide.  

Nowadays, several approaches are actively used to solve the problem. The first, 

and probably the most common one, is the use of detached porous film. A multi-stage 

process of removal of both substrate and the barrier layer followed by contact deposition 

is typically applied [122]. In the first stage, a comparatively thick PAA layer is grown on 

the aluminium foil (Figure I. 10 a). Then, metallic aluminium (substrate) is removed by 

chemical etching in solution of HgCl2  [123], CuCl2 + HCl [124] or SnCl4  [125] (Figure 

I. 10 b). Nonetheless, after the substrate is removed, the pores are still closed in one side. 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

26 

 

Pores opening is commonly carried out in a diluted acidic or basic solution (Figure I. 10 

c). The last step is metallization of the one side of the membrane. It can be performed by 

evaporation [123-125], filtration [126] or some other techniques (Figure I. 10 d). The 

result of these procedures is the highly-ordered matrix with insulating walls and 

conducting bottom. The free-standing membranes were successfully used for preparation 

of different metallic [125, 127], semiconductor [128, 129], multilayer [130] 1-D 

nanoparticles and nanowires via electrodeposition.  

 

 

Figure I. 10 Schematic representation of the free-standing PAA template 

preparation. a) preparation of the PAA template; b) dissolution of the substrate; c) 

pores opening; d) contact evaporation. 

Another technique is a deposition in the non-detached PAA film after barrier 

cracking or thinning. The barrier modification is performed by decreasing of the voltage 

at the end of anodization or/and chemical etching [131, 132]. The thickness of the barrier 

layer is proportional to the applied voltage. Hence, a decrease of the potential at the end 

of anodization leads to a decrease of the barrier layer thickness. Thus, electrodeposition 

occurs much easier in the modified template. However, there are no techniques that can 

remove absolutely the alumina layer due to immediate formation of the oxide layer on 

aluminium at ambient conditions. Hence, it is necessary to use AC regime and 

comparatively high voltage (10-20 V) for deposition [133].  

In spite of the fact that titania barrier layer is conductive, far less works on 

electrodeposition in PAT template are available today. Because of the biggest weakness 

of the PAT, namely conductive walls, electrodeposition occurs in the whole pore surface 

and the pores are sealed on the top [134, 135]. In general, the approaches for 

electrodeposition inside the titania nanotubes are similar to the previously showed for 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

27 

 

alumina: AC (pulse) electrodeposition [136, 137], electrodeposition in detached template 

[138] and bottom modification. Bottom modification of PAT is different from that 

applicable for PAA and based on improving the barrier conductivity without changing 

the walls. One of the most considerable and interesting work in the area was performed 

by Macak et al [139]. The authors increased conductivity of the bottom part of the tubes 

via proton intercalation (Ti4+ + e- + H+ = Ti3+H+). In this way, successful bottom-up filling 

of the PAT with copper from a water-based solution was achieved. 

2. Ionic liquids and DES 

Electroplating was used for the first time in XIX century to deposit thin gold 

coatings on various jewellery and decorative products. Nowadays, electrodeposition 

gains widespread use in all areas of industry, for example, electronics [140], corrosion 

protection[141], metal production. Electrodeposition is considered as a cheap and 

appropriate method for preparation of coatings with diverse thicknesses, compositions for 

variety of applications [142]. Unfortunately, electrodeposition from the most classical 

and generally available solvent, water, often requires the use of toxic components in 

solution. In addition, it can be followed by undesirable extra processes (hydrogen 

reduction provokes the loss of efficiency and, what is more important, it could lead to 

hydrogen embrittlement). Varied media for deposition, such as organic solvents, eutectic 

mixture and ionic liquids, have been investigated as methods to avoid these secondary 

processes [2]. 

The main driving force to study electrochemistry of non-aqueous solutions is the 

electrodeposition of certain metals such as titanium, aluminium and tungsten. These 

metals are well-known as materials with excellent corrosion resistance because of the thin 

oxide layer formed in the ambient conditions. It was observed that the layer is very stable 

and prevents corrosion. On the other hand, the same factor (oxide layer formation) makes 

the electrodeposition of these metals from aqueous media impossible. Organic solvents 

and melting salts are not suitable for common applications because of high volatility, 

toxicity, flammable and high power consumption.  

Ionic liquid is a good compromise between organic solvents and melting salts. A 

typical definition of an ionic liquid is “low-melting salts (melting-point typically&amp;lt;100oC) 

obtained by the combination of large organic cations with a variety of anions” [143]. 

Usually, ionic materials have a high lattice energy and their melting temperature is high. 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

28 

 

In general, one part of the ionic liquids is a big organic ion where the charge is 

delocalized. It allows to decrease the lattice energy and to have liquid ionic materials at 

room temperature [144]. Typical ions, which form ionic liquids, are presented in Table I.

2.1 Ionic liquids 

Conventional ionic liquids can be divided into two big groups [144, 145]. 

Electrodeposition of metals from ionic liquids was firstly studied in AlCl3-based ionic 

liquids, which form the first group (first generation). This electrolyte contains two 

components: the Lewis acid (most commonly AlCl3 or AlBr3) and a 1,3-

dialkylimidazolium, alkylpyridinium or quaternary ammonium compound. The most 

common method for synthesis of this type of ionic liquids is a solid state reaction by 

mixing the components under active stirring. The preparation should be performed under 

inert atmosphere by using Schlenk techniques or glove box.  

Mixing of a quaternary halide salt where the cation is typically an amine, 

phosphine or sulfide (Cat+Hal-) with a Lewis acid (MeHalx) leads to formation of the  

(Cat+MeHal-x+1) salt. The most frequently used quaternary salt is 1-ethyl-3-

methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl) and the Lewis acid is AlCl3. Unfortunately, 

composition of the final electrolyte is rather uncertain because it has a strong dependence 

on the ratio organic salt : Lewis acid and on temperature [145]. Reactions that occur 

during the ILs synthesis are the following: 

[EMIM]+Cl- + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]
+[AlCl4]

- (I.13) 

[EMIM]+[AlCl4]
-  + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]

+[Al2Cl7]
- (I.14) 

[EMIM]+[Al2Cl7]
- + AlCl3 ? [EMIM]

+[Al3Cl10]
- (I.15) 

The ionic liquids can be also divided into three groups according to their acidity 

by analogy with water. Autosolvolysis of water can be described as: 

2H2O ? H3O
+ + OH- (I.16) 

In the same manner autosolvolysis reaction of [AlCl4]
- species can be written as: 

2[AlCl4]
- ? [Al2Cl7]

- + Cl- (I.17) 

The Lewis acidity/basicity can be easily changed by means of variation of the ratio 

between [EMIM]Cl and AlCl3, because Cl
- is a typical Lewis base and [Al2Cl7]

- is a Lewis 

acid (in water, these are OH- and H+, respectively). For the foregoing reasons, the three 

groups of the ionic liquids are:  

 

1) Acidic (with an excess of [Al2Cl7]
- (i.e., [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 &amp;lt;0.5 (molar ratio)). 

2) Basic (with an excess of Cl- (i.e., [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 &gt; 0.5 (molar ratio)). 

3) Neutral (with a molar ratio [EMIM]Cl:AlCl3 = 0.5). 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

31 

 

It is well known that electrodeposition of metals from a water solution often is 

carried out at low or high pH and it has a great influence on the deposition process. The 

analogous situation with ILs and Lewis acidity was found.  

A representative of the second generation or discrete ions ionic liquids was firstly 

reported by Wilkes and Zaworotko in 1992 [146]. It consisted of 1-ethyl-3-

methylimidazolium cation and tetrafluoroborate anion. In contrast to the first generation 

electrolyte, the second one has isolated ions. Nowadays, the discrete ions ILs attract a 

great attention due to a wider electrochemical window [147] that allows electrodeposition 

of reactive metals. Moreover, ILs based on tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate are 

water insensitive despite the fact that slow hydrolyse with HF evolution [148] occurs. The 

systems with similar physical properties but absolutely water insensitive were prepared 

with tri-fluromethanesulphonate (CF3SO3
-) and bis-(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide 

[(CF3SO2)2N
-] [149]. There are available several reviews about these ILs [144, 145]. 

2.2 Deep eutectic based ionic liquids 

The ideal mixture of two components, without any interaction between them, has 

linear dependence of the melting temperature on composition. In fact, mixture of two 

different compounds has lower melting temperature than it should be in ideal mixture 

[150]. This negative deviation appears if components of the system have strong physical 

interaction between each other. Schematically it is shown in Figure I. 11. 

A mixture of two components is entirely solid regardless of the molar ratio at a 

temperature, which is lower than the eutectic isotherm line, and is entirely liquid upper 

the liquidus line (Figure I. 11). A transition zone between liquidus and solidus lines has 

a liquid phase and a solid component (it depends on molar ratio). Eutectic point is a 

composition of the mixture with the lowest melting temperature [150].

Figure I. 11 Schematic representation of a two component phase diagram (adapted 

from Atkins et al. [150]). 

Some eutectic mixtures are used for electrowinning of metals such as aluminium. 

However, their melting temperatures are comparatively high, which raises the costs of the 

metal manufacturing. Only development of chloroaluminate ionic liquids allowed 

decrease of the melting point down to room temperature. This system is of the interest 

due to industrial importance of the aluminium. Several decades after the ionic liquids 

introduction, Abbott et al. and Sun et al. showed that quarter ammonium halides also 

formed eutectics with zinc halides [151-153]. The general formula of such a system can 

be written as (R1R2R3R4N
+)X- Y, where ammonium (sulfonium, phosphonium) cation 

(R1R2R3R4N
+) and halide anion (X-) formed the first component of the eutectic. The 

second component (Y) is a Lewis or Bronstad acid complexing agent, which complexes 

the anion and delocalizes its charge. Charge delocalization leads to decrease of interaction 

between cation and anion and thereby to a decrease of the melting point. 

Depending on the complexing agent nature the deep eutectic solvents (DES) can 

be divided into four groups [154]: 

 

? Eutectic Type 1: Y=MClx M= Zn, Sn, Fe, Al, Ga, In 

? Eutectic Type 2: Y=MClx yH2O = Cr. Co, Cu, Ni, Fe 

? Eutectic Type 3: Y=RZ, Z=CONH2, COOH, OH. 

? Eutectic Type 4: MClx + RZ, M=Zn, Sn, Fe and Z=CONH2, OH

2.2.1 Type I eutectics 

A deep eutectic solvent from the first group is formed from quaternary ammonium 

salts and anhydrous metal halides. The type I eutectics are analogous to the 

chloroaluminate ionic liquids. The DESs can be formed from the metal halides which 

have relatively low melting points such as ZnCl2 [151, 155], SnCl2 [151, 155], FeCl3 

[156], GaCl3 [157], InCl3 [158]. The composition of the system strongly depends on 

molar ratio of the components likewise for the chloraluminate ILs [151, 159]. It was 

shown that although Cl- and ZnCl3
- ions dominate in Lewis basic liquids, there are several 

chlorozincate clusters (ZnCl3
-, Zn2Cl5

-, Zn3Cl7
-) in Lewis acidic liquids. A similar 

behaviour was demonstrated for the chlorostannate systems [151, 159].  

2.2.2 Type II eutectics 

The hydration water decreases the lattice energy and it leads to reducing of the 

melting point of the salts. It extends number of metals which can form DES such as  

CaCl2 · 6H2O, LaCl3 · 6H2O, CoCl2 · 6H2O, LiNO3 · 4H2O, Zn(NO3)2 · 4H2O [160], 

MgCl2?·?6H2O[161]. The type II eutectics are not strictly ionic liquids because of presence 

of hydration water, but in spite of that, their physical properties are comparable with those 

of the conventional ILs and water is rather ligand than solvent [162]. The water molecules 

are strongly coordinated to the ions and it is very difficult to reduce them that provides 

wider electrochemical windows than those in water based electrolytes. Unfortunately, this 

type of DES is rarely studied and nowadays the influence of water molecules is not fully 

understandood. The DES containing chromium is the most investigated system [162-

164]. Abbott et al. have studied this system and the lowest melting point was found for 

2:1 CrCl3 6H2O/ChCl ratio. Composition of this eutectic mixture was investigated using 

UV-vis spectrometry and it was shown that the DES contains mainly the Cr(H2O)3Cl3 

species with small amount of [CrCl4·2H2O]
?. The presence choline cations and CrCl4

- in 

the eutectic was found by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Authors made a conclusion 

that ChCl+ and Cl- are the main charge carrying species [162]. The cyclic voltammogram 

of the 2:1 CrCl3 6H2O/ChCl system shows no water reduction current which means that 

the water molecules are highly coordinated and the electrolyte is not just a concentrated 

solution [165].

2.2.3 Type III eutectics 

DES of the third type are based on formation of complexes between halogen 

anions and hydrogen bond donors (HBD) [166]. Formation of deep eutectic solvents was 

found for a range of amides, alcohols and carboxylic acids (Figure I. 12 [154]). These 

liquids are easy to prepare, relatively cheap, water- and air-stable and mainly 

biodegradable [144, 154]. DES of this type have been used in the current work. 

 

 

Figure I. 12 Structures of some halide salts and hydrogen bond donors used in the 

formation of deep eutectic solvents (taken from Smith et al. [154]). 

Composition of a deep eutectic solvent depends on the quantity of functional 

groups of the hydrogen bond donors; for instance, molar ratio between urea, oxalic acid, 

citric acid and quaternary ammonium salt (choline chloride) are 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2, 

correspondingly. Complexation (charge delocalization) of the halide anions occurs 

through hydrogen bond formation with HBDs. An additional proof of the presence of 

hydrogen bonding in the system was obtained using Heteronuclear Overhauser effect 

spectroscopy for choline fluoride/urea system and using FAB MS for choline chloride 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates

(ChCl)/urea system. The signals which correspond to two urea molecules and Cl- (M-

=155) and to one urea and chloride (M-=95) were observed by FAB MS [167]. 

The III type eutectics have large temperature difference between real melting 

point and theoretical melting point of ideal mixture, for example the practical melting 

point of 1ChCl/2urea is lower for 180oC than the theoretical one [167]. Moreover, the 

large number of available hydrogen bond donors makes this class of ionic liquids 

attractive for industrial application because it can be easily adopted for specific usage 

with a capability to dissolve a wide range of metal salts and oxide. 

The DES based on the choline chloride and glycols are non-toxic and accessible 

to the industry [154]. For instance ChCl is a vitamin and it is produced on a large scale as 

animal feed supplement. The ChCl based solvents were used in the experimental work on 

the thesis because these ionic liquids have the highest conductivity, the lowest viscosity 

and comparatively large potential windows. These parameters are extremely important 

for electrodeposition processes. 

2.2.4 Type IV eutectics 

The mixture of metal halide with hydrogen bond donors in some situation is 

eutectic with a near room temperature melting point. The possibility of such an eutectic 

has been shown by Abbott et al. for zinc, tin (II) and iron (III) chlorides in a mixture with 

ethylene glycol, urea or acetamide [168]. It was proposed by the authors to classify these 

systems as type IV eutectics. The zinc chloride forms eutectics with urea, acetamide, 

ethylene glycol and hexandiol in the ratios (eutectic donor/ZnCl2) 3.5, 4, 4 and 3, 

correspondingly. Ionic species identification was performed by FAB MS [168] and it was 

shown that together with common zinc complexes [ZnCl3]
-, [Zn2Cl5]

- and [Zn3Cl7]
-, there 

are also positive species such as [ZnCl(urea)]+, [ZnCl(urea)2]
+, [ZnCl(urea)3]

+ in the IV 

type of eutectics.  

2.3 Physico-chemical properties 

There is a number of properties that makes ionic liquids attractive for 

electrochemistry. These properties allow deposition of different compounds which is 

impossible with other solutions.  

Ionic liquids are particularly noteworthy from the electrochemical point of view, 

owing to their wide potential window. Typical electrochemical window for an ionic liquid

is about 4 V, although the IL with a 7 V window was also reported (electrochemical 

window of water is less than 2 V). This specific electrochemical parameter allows 

electrodeposition of different active materials such as aluminum, magnesium, lithium, 

sodium, silicon. 

The electrochemical window is not the only significant factor. The roles of such 

properties as electrical and thermal conductivity, melting point and temperature of 

decomposition, viscosity and diffusion coefficient, solubility of metal salts, density are 

also undeniable in electrochemical processes.  

The main physico-chemical properties of ILs are covered in series of books, 

papers and databases [143-145, 154, 169-171]. Moreover, properties of some ionic liquids 

are presented in Table I. 4.

2.3.1 Density 

In general, ionic liquids have higher density than that of water. One can see from 

Table I. 4 that the density values are in the range from 1.1 to 1.6 g/cm3. 

Although a dependence between structure of ions and density of the corresponding 

ionic liquids has not been found yet, several tendencies described in literature [143, 144, 

169, 171] should be mentioned here. First of all, a noteworthy detail is that an increase of 

the length of alkyl radicals both in cations and in anions leads to density decreasing [186]. 

A good example of this is imidazolium based ionic liquids. Changing of the carbon 

number in the row 1-Ethyl-; 1-Butyl-; 1-Hexyl-; 1-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium 

hexafluorophosphate results in a decrease in density as 1.56; 1.37; 1.31; 1.23 g/cm3, 

correspondingly. Similar trend with growing of alkyl radicals can be observed in anions. 

For example, 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation ([EMIM]) with different alkyl-

sulphate anions methyl; butyl; hexyl; octyl sulphate have the density values 1.29; 1.18; 

1.13 and 1.1 g/cm3, correspondingly [182]. Moreover, it is important to mention that 

substitution of light radical for a heavier one, without big difference of sizes, leads to an 

increase in density. For instance, [EMIM][CH3SO3] and [EMIM][CF3SO3] have 1.25 and 

1.38 g/cm3, correspondingly. However, for such heavy radicals the inverse dependence 

can be found: in spite of carbon chain growing, [EMIM][CF3COO] and 

[EMIM][C3F7COO] have the densities of 1.29 and 1.45 g/cm
3. 

2.3.2 Viscosity 

Viscosity of ionic liquids is higher than that of the molecular solvents. Values of 

the viscosity of most of the ILs presented in Table I. 4 are in the range of 10-1000 cP 

(0.01-1 Pa s). This is higher than the water viscosity by one to four orders of magnitude 

(water – 0.89 cP). The ionic liquids viscosity is determined by the Van Der Waal’s forces 

and by abilities of the ions to form hydrogen bonds [169]. Size and structure of the ions 

have a strong influence on viscosity as they do on density. Growth of the alkyl radicals’ 

length leads to reinforcement of the Van Der Waals interaction and increases viscosity. It 

was found that hydrogen bonding has a similar trend. Ionic liquids with BF4
- and PF6

- 

have a higher viscosity values due to the hydrogen bonds formation. The electrostatic 

interaction also plays an important role here [169]. 

Viscosity is a crucial parameter for electrochemistry because it has a strong impact 

on conductivity [171, 187] and kinetics. High viscosity of ILs mainly impairs diffusion 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

39 

 

of metal species to the working electrode which means restrictions to the mass transport. 

Although it was reported that increasing of temperature results in decreasing of viscosity 

of ILs [188-192], but usage of them at high temperature partially contradicts the idea of 

room temperature ionic liquids. It was found that small amounts of different impurities, 

such as water, in ionic liquids lead to strong changes in physico-chemical properties 

including viscosity [193, 194]. Nowadays, dilutants are often added to ionic liquids and 

DES to decrease viscosity, remove diffusion limitations and increase conductivity [195-

199]. These substances and their amounts are different for each specific case depending 

on the ionic liquid composition and materials planned to be deposited. Commonly they 

are different alcohols, hydrocarbons, ethers etc. In some cases, a small amount of water 

can be also used as dilutant.  

2.3.3 Temperature range 

Melting point and decomposition temperature are two main thermal 

characteristics of ionic liquids as electrolytes. First of all, it is important to know the 

melting temperature. Commonly, inorganic salts melt at temperature of the order of 

thousand degrees because of a strong electrostatic interaction between ions.  

The term “room temperature ionic liquids” clearly indicates that these materials 

are in liquid state at room temperature. It is possible due to usage of organic molecules 

where charge is distributed over a big volume which significantly decreases interaction 

between ions. It is evident that structure of ions and composition of ionic liquid have a 

strong impact on the temperature parameters [169]. Unfortunately, as with viscosity and 

density, precise correlation between structure and melting or decomposition points has 

not been found yet. At the same time, the main tendencies can be revealed for certain 

number of parameters. Melting temperature of ionic liquids, by analogy with inorganic 

salts, decreases with increasing of the ions size. It happens because in molecule with 

bigger ions, distance between their centres increases and surface charge decreases, which 

results in lower electrostatic interactions [169]. Apart from the size effect, structure of the 

ILs species has a considerable effect on properties which makes an estimation of the 

thermal properties much more difficult. For example, ionic liquids with aromatic cation 

have lower melting points than that with aliphatic one because of the charge 

delocalization. Concerning side-chain size, initial increasing of carbon number leads to a 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

40 

 

lower melting point, but with large radicals the orientation effect and solidification of the 

system can be observed.  

Influence of the anion structure on the melting temperature is similar to the above-

described one for the cation structure. Presence of bigger anions and the anions with 

higher charge delocalization implies lower electrostatic interaction and, thereby, a lower 

melting point. 

The maximal temperature, at which the use of an ionic liquid without 

decomposition or other chemical changes can be implemented, is also an important 

parameter for certain applications. ILs with the decomposition temperature of about 400-

450oC were reported [178, 200]. However, it was mentioned that a degradation of the ILs 

starts below the above-mentioned range. That is why the usage of the electrolyte at 

temperatures which are close to the decomposition range for a long time is not 

recommended. Data on decomposition temperature of some ionic liquids is shown in 

Figure I. 13 [144]. 

 

 

Figure I. 13 Relation between thermal decomposition temperature of 1-alkyl-3-

methylimidazolium-type ILs with alkyl chain length (adapted from Endres and 

Abbott [144]). 

2.3.4 Conductivity 

Conductivity of ionic liquids is lower than that of the concentrated water solution 

(about 10 mS cm-1), because the large size of ions and its aggregations lead to limited 

mobility of charge carriers. At the same time, ILs show good ionic conductivity, which is 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

41 

 

makes them similar to the best non-aqueous electrolytes. Conductivity of a RTIL has a 

strong correlation with viscosity. These two parameters are combined in Walden’s rule 

[201]: 

 

??=constant (I.18) 

where ? is molar conductivity of the ionic liquid, and ? is a viscosity 

It is obvious from Walden’s rule that ionic liquids with higher viscosity have 

lower conductivity. Moreover, as it was mentioned before, with temperature increasing 

the viscosity decreases and consequently conductivity increases [202]. Some ionic liquids 

might have conductivity of about 10 S cm-1 at 200oC.  

High resistivity of ILs as electrolyte is a negative factor and due to high Ohmic 

loss, their applications in industry are limited. 

2.3.5 Electrochemical windows 

Electrochemical window is a potential range for any electrolyte where no 

electrochemical processes i.e., oxidation or reduction of the electrolyte occur [203]. 

Therefore, electrochemical window (Ew) is a measure of electrochemical stability of the 

electrolyte. It is well known that this range is very narrow for water based electrolytes, 

namely about 1.2 V, which imposes constraints on their electrochemical behaviour. 

Although the electrochemical window of ILs is typically around 4-5 V [144], but the ionic 

liquid with 7 V [204] does also exist. Table I. 5 presents the electrochemical properties 

of some ionic liquids together with the measurement conditions.

Table I. 5 Main electrochemical properties of ionic liquids. 

 

Unfortunately, the ranges of electrochemical stability reported in literature for the 

same ionic liquids are different. Even small amount of impurities dramatically changes 

properties of ILs. For example, a negligible amount of water result in a decrease of the 

electrochemical window due to the hydrogen reduction [203]. Moreover, it is important 

to know the material of the working electrode; because, depending on the electrochemical 

properties of the materials, current appears at different potentials. It can be demonstrated 

for the case of either platinum or tungsten electrodes (Table I. 5). Platinum is a good 

catalyst and the electrochemical window for the platinum working electrode is smaller 

than that for tungsten one.  

In general, ionic liquids with quaternary ammonium cations show a wide 

electrochemical window owing to a relatively low potential of the reduction. For instance, 

the reduction potential of the imidazolium based electrolytes is higher than that of the

quaternary ammonium based one (Table I. 5). It can be explained by the existence of the 

active proton in the imidazolium ion structure. At the same time, pyridinium can be 

reduced with less difficulties in comparison with the imidazolium [206]. Furthermore, 

structure and nature of anions influence significantly the electrochemical stability of ILs. 

Tetrafluoroborate and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide are the ions with the highest 

oxidation potentials. 

The electrochemical studies are often carried out in three electrode cells. There is 

a reference electrode together with the working and the counter electrodes in such cells. 

Electrochemistry of ionic liquids is relatively new area and a standard reference electrode 

to work in ILs has not been defined yet [209] as, for example, silver chloride, calomel 

and others for the water based electrolytes. Reference electrodes used in ILs today can be 

divided in three groups [210]. The first is a quasi-reference electrode, the simplest 

electrode in terms of design. It contains metallic wire (platinum, silver, aluminium, zinc 

etc.) which is immersed in the electrolyte and separated from the reaction area by a 

membrane. The second type of reference electrodes is similar to the common electrodes 

for aqueous electrolytes: for instance, a silver wire covered by silver chloride and 

immersed in solution of a silver compound in organic solvent. The third type of reference 

electrodes is an electrode with Red/Ox couple. Most frequently, researchers use a 

ferrocene (II/III) couple, which is recommended by IUPAC, or an I-/I3
- couple. 

Unfortunately, it is impossible to use the same redox couple in all types of ionic liquids 

because these compounds can affect electrochemistry of the system. Detailed pre-

experimental investigations should be performed to determine the potential for use in each 

specific ILs [210]. A wide number of available electrodes leads to different values of 

oxidation and reduction potential of ionic liquids presented in literature. 

Wide electrochemical window is an electrochemical property of high importance, 

but for successful plating it is also critical to pay attention to all factors, depending on the 

desirable aims. 

2.4 Electrochemical  application  of  ionic  liquids  and  deep  

eutectic  solvents 

One of the major applications of the ionic liquids is electrodeposition [211]. 

Nowadays, most of the metals can reduced from different ILs (Figure I. 14). All marked 

elements can be deposited as pure metals or as alloys [144, 154, 165, 171, 209, 212, 213].

Figure I. 14 Periodic table with highlighted elements which were deposited from ILs. 

2.4.1 Electrodeposition from ionic liquids 

Historically, the AlCl3-based ILs were the first type of ionic liquids applied for 

electrodeposition of metals. These ionic liquids have several drawbacks such as the 

electrochemical window limitation through reduction of aluminium, as well as water- and 

air sensitivity. The last two disadvantages can be avoided by using close atmosphere, 

whereas the first one (electrochemical window) strongly limits the number of deposited 

materials. It means that a lot of diverse metals were deposited not at pure state but as 

alloys with aluminium. Nevertheless, a great number of metals was deposited from this 

type of ionic liquids. 

First of all, attention should be paid to aluminium, because the majority of works 

in chloroaluminate ILs is done on electrodeposition of this metal. The aluminium 

electrodeposition is of interest for industry owing to high corrosion stability provided by 

oxide layer formed on the metal interface. Aluminium was successfully deposited from 

ionic liquids containing different cations such as EMIM [214, 215], BMIM [216], 

butylpyridinium [217], benzyltrimethylammonium [218]. Different cations offer different 

physical properties of ILs such as viscosity, electrochemical window, water sensitivity 

etc., as it was described in the previous part. Moreover, electrodeposition of aluminium 

was performed on different substrates including glassy carbon, steel, gold, platinum. 

These first experiments show a wide range of possible ionic liquids applications.  

The electrodeposition of lithium from EMIMCl/AlCl3 with addition of lithium 

chloride was demonstrated for the first time in 1985 [219]. 10 years later, sodium was 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

45 

 

firstly reduced from the same ionic liquid by Gray et al [220]. Some less reactive elements 

such as silver, copper [221], indium [222], cobalt [223], zinc [224], gallium [225], 

antimony [226], tellurium [227], gold [228] were also successfully deposited afterwards. 

Furthermore, the experiments with deposition of alloys, rather than pure metals, were also 

successfully implemented (magnesium alloy [229], titanium alloy [230]).  

The chloroaluminate based ILs were substituted in 1990s by the discrete ions ILs 

[146]. The use of tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, 

bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions improves both chemical and electrochemical 

stabilities. The increase of the electrochemical stability extends the number of metals 

available for deposition. The second generation of ILs allows to deposit not only 

comparatively noble metals e.g., cadmium [231], gold [232], copper [233], selenium 

[158, 234] but also materials that can be reduced neither from water based solution nor 

from chloroaluminate systems (magnesium [235], titanium (thin film) [236], silicon [237, 

238], caesium [239]).  

Apart from the pure metals the electrodeposition of alloys and other compounds 

was also widely studied in available ionic liquids. Several technically important alloys 

and semiconductors such as Zn/Sn [240], GaAs [241], InSb [242], ZnTe [243] were 

deposited. 

2.4.2 Electrodeposition from deep eutectic solvent 

The third type of deep eutectics based on choline chloride is not toxic and has a 

low cost and, therefore, it has been intensively studied after the introduction made by 

Abbott et al. in 2004 [166]. These DES are flexible and adaptable for necessary conditions 

due to the large number of available HBD. The applications of DES are limited by 

electrochemical window (normally about 3 V), that does not allow the electrodeposition 

of electronegative metals such as titanium, aluminium and alkali metals from these 

eutectics. Nevertheless, at the industry scale, DES are deemed to be promising substitutes 

of the water electrolytes for deposition of metals (zinc [208, 244-246], copper [247], 

nickel [248], tin [208]) and alloys, for instance Zn/Sn [208], Zn/Ni [249]. Increase of the 

current efficiency and improvement of the surface reproducibility are the most significant 

effects of choline based electrolytes application. 

Zinc is one of the most important metals in plating industry due to the corrosion 

resistance and a low price. Electrodeposition of this metal has been widely studied. Initial 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich

studies of zinc electrodeposition from choline chloride ethylene glycol (1:2) DES were 

carried out by Whitehead et al. [246]. They showed that electroreduction of zinc on glassy 

carbon rod occurs much faster when the potential is increased from more negative (-0.8V) 

to -0.4 - -0.2V vs Zn/Zn2+ quasi-reference electrode. It can be explained by formation of 

so-called Z species (intermediate compounds) which are reduced at higher potential. 

Then, Vieira together with Whitehead and Gollas studied this phenomenon particularly 

and confirmed the formation of Z species in the diffusion layer [250].  

Abbott et al. have studied the influence of double layer on the zinc nucleation 

[185]. They used two types of ILs based on choline chloride with different HBD (either 

urea or ethylene glycol). It is shown that the deposit has different structures explained by 

blocking of certain crystal faces in glycol-contained electrolyte. Bakkar and Neubert 

[245] electrodeposited zinc on magnesium from choline based DES with four different 

HBDs: urea, ethylene glycol, glycerol and malonic acid. Such zinc coating was used in 

order to protect Mg from corrosion. The ChCl/urea eutectic is considered to be the most 

suitable liquid for successful electroplating. As it was recently shown by Vieira et al. 

[251], the working electrode materials also have a strong impact on nucleation and 

deposition processes. These authors used glassy carbon, stainless steel, gold, platinum 

copper and zinc as substrates to study the hydrogen overpotential and possible Z species 

formation. Formation of a compact blocking layer on the electrode interface, which 

inhibits the electrodeposition of zinc, has been noted. 

Nowadays, improvement of the coating quality, brightening, efficiency increment 

during electroplating are achieved via addition of some specific compounds. Nonetheless, 

additives for electrodeposition from DES are barely studied. The first full investigation 

of the influence of three polar additives (acetonitrile, ethylene diamine, and ammonium 

hydroxide) on the nucleation of zinc and the morphology of the coating was published by 

Abbott et al. in 2011 [199]. Ammonia and ethylene diamine additives result in effective 

brightening of the coating. Ibrahim [198] et al. also studied the influence of acetonitrile 

and ethylene diamine on electrodeposition of zinc. They mentioned that additives 

promote reduction at less negative potential, although the current efficiency decreases.  

Application of DES for metals plating is new and promising area.

2.5 Electrode/electrolyte interface 

The ionic liquids behaviour differ greatly from that of the common water based 

electrolytes and the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface are not an exception. 

The main difference occurs because ILs contain only charged species in contrast to 

molecular liquid. As a result, additional interionic forces such as Coulomb, Van der Waals 

and hydrogen bonding arise. All these interactions promote formation of nanostructures 

in both bulk deposit and at the electrolyte/electrified interface [252, 253]. Formation of 

multilayered structure was confirmed by several independent techniques, namely high 

energy X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, 

electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The strong ILs adsorbance onto solid interface 

and formation of multilayer superstructure was reported [253-257]. Moreover, it was also 

demonstrated that applied potential has a strong impact on the ions arrangement: the 

surface structure is more obvious both at more positive and more negative potentials. The 

generally accepted model of the electrode/ILs interface is presented in Figure I. 15 [209]. 

The single layer of ions mostly neutralizes the electrode charge and this layer is also 

compensated by other oppositely charged ion layers.

Besides experimental studies, the molecular dynamics calculations and Monte 

Carlo simulations [258-261] were also performed for theoretical descriptions of the 

electrolyte/electrode systems. The calculated data were found to be in a good agreement 

with the experimental results. 

DES and classical ILs show similar behaviour on the electrode surface. Several 

studies of interfaces in the deep eutectic solvents based on choline chloride were reported 

[262, 263]. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were 

used in these works for the interface investigation. The capacitance values at different 

potentials were measured for the ChCl:2Glycerol eutectic on glassy carbon, platinum and 

gold electrodes [262]. It was shown that measured capacity depends on the electrode 

material. For instance, replacing glassy carbon electrode by platinum one leads to an 

increase of the capacity value for all potentials, although the shape of the curves remains 

similar. Moreover, increasing temperature results in an increase of the differential 

capacity. The results of the study [262] correlate with the reported data for conventional 

ionic liquids. Another study on the structure of double layer were performed on mercury 

electrode in choline based DESs with different hydrogen bond donors (urea, 1,2 and 1,3 

propanediol, ethylene glycol) [263]. Authors concluded that at negative potential, the 

double layer structure on mercury electrode is similar to one observed in aqueous 

electrolyte solution. They assumed presence of a hydrogen bond donors layer between 

the electrode and cations at negative potential. The observed growth of the capacitance at 

positive potential was attributed to adsorption of free chloride ions.  

The double layer structure in both ionic liquids and eutectic solvents is not well 

understood for both ionic liquids and eutectic solvents despite of the numerous studies 

and calculations performed. Therefore, new studies should be undertaken in order to 

improve the understanding of role of the ionic species and their behaviour on the 

electrified interface.

Thesis objectives  

The main goal of this PhD work is electrosynthesys of 1-D zinc nanorods from 

choline chloride based ionic liquid by using the template assisted techniques. A novelty 

of this research is a use of the not-detached template, which allows reducing the price and 

the time for the nanomaterials preparation. During the work, two most common porous 

anodic templates (porous anodic titania and porous anodic alumina) were carefully 

studied with particular attention to barrier layer influence. The electrochemical processes 

that occur during nanowires fabrication have a noticeable influence of the barrier layer 

thickness. This specific influence was studied step-by-step from a flat dense oxide layer 

to the porous templates. The studies revealed several ways of deposition and modification 

of the porous templates for the successful nanoparticles preparation.  

Zinc has been used as a model material with a possible further conversion to 

semiconductive materials such as zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc selenide or substitution by 

other materials. The use of the ionic liquids as electrolyte also gives vast array of possible 

secondary materials and excludes several negative effects of the water based electrolytes 

namely a narrow electrochemical window, hydrogen evolution, toxic components. We 

also observed the specific adsorption of the electrolyte components on the electrode 

surface which hinders the reduction of the zinc species. An appropriate way to solve the 

problem was also developed. 

Regarding the main objectives, it is possible to highlight the followings:  

1) synthesis of the dense and porous anodic films on the valve metals (aluminium

Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

63 

 

This chapter presents the general description of all experiments performed during 

the PhD work. A brief overview of the techniques used in the work is also done here. 

Besides, the experimental details are additionally described in each chapter of the Results. 

The main objective of the work was electrodeposition of zinc in non-detached 

porous anodic templates. In the first step, investigation was performed on bulk anodic 

films. For this purpose, dense anodic layers of various thickness on titanium and 

aluminium were prepared and characterized. Then, porous templates on the same metals 

were prepared and studied. In the following step, electrochemical behavior of the anodic 

films in deep eutectic solvent was considered. Finally, the results obtained for the planar 

anodic layers were analyzed and applied to the porous templates. The essential parameters 

of the electrodeposition process have been established and modification of the templates 

for successful Zn filling (where applicable) have been performed. The full scheme of the 

PhD work is schematically depicted on the Figure II. 1.

1. Procedures description 

The first stage of the work consists in the electrodes and electrolyte preparation. 

As it was mentioned above, the deep eutectic solvent based on the choline chloride was 

chosen as electrolyte. This type of ionic liquids can be prepared by simple mixing of the 

choline chloride and the hydrogen bond donor. In our case, the latter was ethylene glycol. 

The molar ratio of the components was 1 ChCl to 2 EG that corresponds to the eutectic 

point of the mixture. An appropriate amount of zinc was dissolved in the eutectic at 60oC 

and then the electrolyte was kept under vacuum for 24 hours. Between the experiments, 

the solution was stored in desiccator over P2O5. 

Initially, the metallic substrate was polished at suitable conditions and then 

anodized in two electrode cells. In this system, the chosen substrate (aluminium or 

titanium) was used as the working electrode and platinum foil was used as the counter 

electrode. Two types of electrolyte, with and without aggressive ions, were used for 

preparation of porous and dense anodic films, correspondingly. The dense barrier layer 

was formed in neutral solution (ammonium pentaborate), because alumina is sensitive to 

pH and easily dissolves in an acidic solution. As opposed to bulk layers, the porous oxides 

were produced in acidic electrolyte (oxalic acid) because of the same reason of the pH 

sensitivity of alumina. Since titania is indifferent to pH, the bulk titania anodic films can 

be obtained in many different of electrolytes. The sulfuric acid solution was used for that 

aim due to high reproducibility and stability of the obtaining layer. In the case of porous 

template formation, the ethylene glycol based electrolyte, with small amount of water and 

fluoride ions, has been used. The fact that the electrolyte is based on ethylene glycol 

allowed preparation of long pores with smooth walls. Presence of fluoride ions was 

important because exactly these ions promote dissolution of the barrier titania. 

Commonly, bulk oxide layer preparation is carried out in one step (galvanostatic 

oxidation). However, the two-step technique is the most desirable way of formation of 

high-ordered porous anodic templates. Both steps are normally performed at the same 

conditions (electrolyte, temperature, voltage) and only the removal of the oxides (either 

chemical or mechanical) splits the steps. Detailed descriptions of the anodization 

mechanism and of the used parameters are presented in the State of the art and Results 

(papers), correspondingly.

The electrodes were fully characterized after preparation. The morphological 

properties, such as topography, pore diameter, interpore distance, pores ordering, 

thickness of the pores layer, and crystallinity of the templates were assessed using 

scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The barrier oxide layer thicknesses 

were estimated by several techniques, namely glow discharge optical emission 

spectroscopy, ellipsometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 

At the second stage of the work, the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes 

covered by dense anodic alumina or titania was investigated. It has been done in three 

electrode cell to ensure a higher-precision control of the potential on the working 

electrode. In the frame of this step, influence of the film thickness and temperature of the 

solution on the kinetics of zinc reduction was studied using both cyclic and linear 

voltammetry as well as chronoamperometry. I(t) curves gave indication of the mechanism 

of nucleation which is an important factor for the electrodeposition process. SEM and 

AFM were used in order to confirm nucleation mechanism which was obtained by I(t) 

curves analyses.  

Furthermore, strong influence of electrical double layer (EDL) on the zinc species 

reduction was observed during the electrochemical measurements, which increased 

interest in studying this phenomenon. The EDL was explored by attenuated total 

reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, the use of AC signal 

superimposed on a bias potential to avoid the blockage effect of the dense organic layer 

(EDL) at the electrodeposition to porous alumina templates was explored. 

At the last stage, the parameters, and conditions revealed and then optimized for 

the dense anodic oxides were summarized and applied to the porous templates. It was 

decided to use two-step electrodeposition for filling of porous anodic alumina templates. 

The first step, a pulse electrodeposition, leads to zinc nucleation on bottoms of the pores. 

The second one results in the galvanostatic pores filling. Concerning the porous anodic 

titania, several modifications such as annealing and electrochemical selective 

crystallization were performed to achieve successful filling of the titania nanotubes by 

zinc in one step. Control of the pores filling was performed using SEM, TEM, EDX and 

GDOES techniques.

2. Techniques overview  

Electron microscopy 

Scanning and transmission electron microscopies are important tools for 

morphological characterization of materials. In these techniques, an electron beam is used 

for illumination, which allows a higher resolution than when using a visible light beam. 

Mathematically, the resolution can be described by Abbe’s equation: 

 

? =
0.612 ?

? ????
   (II.1) 

 

where (n sin?) is numerical aperture (NA), d is resolution and ? is wavelength of the 

imaging radiation. According to equation (II.1), the limit of optical resolution is about 

2000 Å for the violet light (?=4000 Å and NA = 1.25). The electron beam wavelength is 

much smaller that results in a higher resolution (d = 0.2 Å, by the same equation) [1]. 

The electron beam, emitted by electron gun, is accelerated and goes through the 

series of electromagnetic lenses which focus it on the sample. There are two groups of 

interactions of the electron beam with a sample: elastic and inelastic. The first group is 

characterised by wide-angle changes in electron trajectory and insignificant energy losses 

of the scattered electrons. Typical signal after elastic scattering, used for imaging, is 

contributed by backscattered electrons (BSE). BSE signal provides both topographical 

and compositional information. The compositional information is possible to receive 

because the intensity of the signal strongly depends on the atomic numbers of the 

elements in the sample [1, 2].  

The second group, inelastic scattering, is characterized by significant amount of 

energy transferring from the incident beam to the specimen atoms. This interaction leads 

to excitation of the atoms and to generation of the secondary electrons with the energy 

less than 50 eV. Such a signal is widely used for visualization of surface texture of the 

sample. Another signal which also appears, when excited atom returns to ground state, is 

characteristic X-ray (EDX). EDX allows both qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis 

of the chemical composition [1, 2]. 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

67 

 

Besides the above-described signals, there are also other signals, such as 

continuum X-rays, Auger electrons, cathodoluminescence, and specimen current. All of 

them, except continuum X-rays, can be used for the specimen characterization [2, 3]. 

SEM was actively used during this PhD work for characterization of the deposits 

both on the dense anodic layers and inside the porous anodic templates. Moreover, the 

microstructure of the porous templates was also controlled by SEM. The deposits 

composition and distribution of the deposited particles over the electrode interface were 

controlled by EDX and BSE analyses. 

The electrons from the incident beam can be transmitted through the sample if it 

is thin enough. Transmitted electrons participate in formation of electron diffraction 

image or TEM image. Two different modes are commonly applied for TEM analyses. 

The first and the most common one is a bright field imaging mode. In this mode, the 

contrast is formed “classically”; in other words, by direct occlusion and absorption of the 

electrons from the incident beam in the samples. It means that the thicker part of the 

sample or part containing heavier elements will be darker than the thinner region or area 

out of the sample. The second type is a dark field mode when unscattered (direct) beam 

is blocked by aperture. It leads to dark areas if there is no sample (beam passing without 

any interaction) and only scattered electrons make the bright places in the image. Dark 

field mode is very useful for particles size measurements and planar defects investigations 

[3].  

Commonly TEM provides a higher resolution than SEM due to the use of the 

electron beam with a higher energy, but the sample preparation for TEM is more 

complicated. Nevertheless, presence and morphology of the secondary materials, 

crystallinity and structure of the tubes were studied by TEM. 

Key benefits of these techniques are high resolution, possibility to measure a large 

variety of the materials characteristics, short analysis time etc. The drawbacks are the 

following: use of high vacuum in the electrode beam area, sampling (TEM), sample 

preparation (TEM), possible damage by electron beam and interpretation of the results 

(TEM).  

Glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy 

GDOES is an effective technique for elemental surface analysis and depth 

profiling of bulk solids and thin films. The working principle is based on the detection of

the photons which come from the highly-excited atoms during its de-excitation to a lower-

energy state or to the ground state.  

According to the quantum mechanics principles, in contrast to classical 

mechanics, electrons in the atoms can have only certain value of energy. Each pair of 

principal quantum number and azimuthal quantum number corresponds to only one 

specific energy level of electron. It is well known, that all atoms have a large number of 

possible energy levels, but not all of them are stable. Thus, excited atom returns to the 

ground state through one or several steps and, at each step, the energy difference releases 

in the form of radiation. The energy (E) and the frequency of the emitted photon (?) are 

linked by the Planck–Einstein relation: 

 

E=h?  (II.2) 

 

where h is Plank constant (6.626 10?34 J?s). 

Since the photon frequency is specific for each de-excitation step and for each 

different atom, it is possible to identify the atoms type and quantity the atoms from 

analysis of the emission spectra. 

The sample should be atomized before excitation. The low-pressure plasma is 

used in the GDOES equipment for that aim. The plasma is induced by electrical current 

passed through the gas (argon is mostly used) under a low pressure. The electron flow 

interacts with inert argon atoms and forms a plasma. The plasma is not homogeneous and 

contains four different regions (Figure II. 2) [4]. 

 

 

Figure II. 2 Schematic representation of the glow discharge plasma and distribution 

of light zones (adapted from Weston [4]). 

The cathode dark space (CDS), also called the cathode fall, is about 1 mm length. 

Most of the potential differences between anode and cathode happen in this region.

Another region is called negative glow (NG) and its length has several millimeters. This 

region is almost field free and it is the biggest part of the plasma [4]. Formation of the 

similar zones (anode dark space and positive glow region) near anode has been also found 

in some sources. The phenomenon is irrelevant for our system because of the small 

distance between anode and cathode [5, 6].  

The positive species (mostly Ar) are accelerated in the CDS region by electrical 

field and bombard the cathode (sample) surface. Moreover, significant part of ions regains 

electrons by means of collisions with neutral atoms. It leads to conversion of the neutral 

atoms and ions to the slow ions and fast neutral atoms, correspondingly. Both ions and 

the fast neutral atoms have enough kinetic energy for the sample sputtering [6]. 

The sputtered atoms move away from the sample surface to the NG region, which 

contains enough electrons with the energies sufficient to excite these atoms. Finally, 

excited atoms de-excite with emitting of the characteristic photons [6]. 

The GDOES technique has been used along all the work for determination of both 

the thicknesses and the composition qualitative characterization of the anodic films. 

Besides, GDOES has been applied to study the mechanism of the pore filling. The 

possibility to control the sputtering rate by the plasma energy allowed carrying the soft 

plasma polishing of the samples before SEM studies that broadens significantly 

opportunity of the SEM analyses. 

The disadvantages of GDOES are the following: a strong influence of the surface 

condition, obligatory calibration for quantification, difficulties to analyse rough surfaces. 

Nevertheless, the GDOES technique offers a low-cost and rapid analysis with high 

sensitivity (1-10 ppm), high depth resolution (nm) and a possibility to measure all 

elements including the light ones (H, B, Li etc.).  

Electrochemical techniques 

Typical electrochemical measurements are performed in electrochemical cells 

which can contain two or more electrodes. In the simplest cell, the potential difference is 

measured between two electrodes, namely the working electrode and the counter one. 

Main drawback of this type of electrochemical cell is the lack of precise control of the 

working electrode potential. The problem can be solved by entering additional (third) 

electrode, so-called the reference electrode. The third electrode has a constant potential

and the potential difference is measured between the working and the reference electrode 

(in contrast to the two-electrode cell) that allows to make precise potential changes. 

During electrochemical measurements, it is impossible to control the current and 

the potential simultaneously. Therefore, only two basic experiments can be performed: 

when the potential is controlled while the current is measured and, the opposite, when the 

potential is measured while current is controlled. The most known electrochemical 

techniques are presented in Figure II. 3.

Only two electrochemical techniques from the list, namely voltammetry and 

chronoamperometry were applied in this PhD work, because they are the main methods 

to study the electrode kinetics. It is possible to obtain information about nature of

electrode processes, based on the shape of curves and the shape changing in different 

solutions, temperature and other physico-chemical parameters [9, 10]. 

One of the most widely used technique is voltammetry. The method consists in 

application of a continuously time-varying potential to the working electrode and 

registration of the corresponding current.  

In the electrochemical system, the resulting current contains faradaic and 

nonfaradaic parts. The most important example of nonfaradaic part is current of the EDL 

charging. This small current depends on the potential value due to reorganization of the 

EDL structure [8]. 

The faradaic current appears as a result of redox reactions on the electrode which 

mostly occur under polarization. Polarization is necessary for equilibrium changing in the 

system. The relationship between the electrode potential (E) and the equilibrium 

concentration of ions is described by the Nernst equation: 

 

? = ?0 +  
??

??
ln (

???

????
)  (II.3) 

 

where E0 is standard potential (V), R – universal gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1), T – 

temperature (K), F – Faraday constant (96485 C mol-1), n – number of moles of electrons 

transferred in the reaction, ?red/ox is a chemical activity for the relevant species (can be 

simplified by replacing for concentration of the species) [8, 11].  

It is obvious from equation II.3 that any changes in E result in changing the 

concentration ratio (?ox/?red) of the species on the electrode interface according to the 

scheme: 

 

Ox + ne = Red  (II.4) 

 

This particular electrons flow appears in the I(E) curve as a current. There are two 

main factors influencing the current density during the electrochemical experiments, 

namely mass-transport and kinetics of the electron transfer. The charge-transfer rate can 

be enhanced by applying potential until the moment, when the mass-transport becomes a 

limiting factor. The mass-transport is contributed by three independent mechanisms: 

migration, convection and diffusion. The driving forces are electric field in solution,

external energy (for example mechanical stirring) and chemical potential caused by 

concentration gradient, correspondingly [11].  

The cyclic voltammetry (CVA) is a particular case of voltammetry. It is a very 

powerful technique for initial analysis of the system and occurring processes. As it was 

told by E. Gileady: “Cyclic voltammetry should always be the first experiment performed 

in a new system, but never the last” [11]. The advantage of the CVA, in comparison with 

the linear sweep voltammetry, is that scan of the potential is performed in both directions. 

It gives an opportunity to investigate species generated on the electrode. [7, 8, 11].  

Additional information about electrochemical processes in the systems studied in 

the current work was obtained from the chronoamperometry measurements, where the 

potential was kept constant and the current response was studied. In particular, this 

technique has been used for determination of the nucleation mechanism, critical size of 

the nuclei, nucleation rate and also for quantification of the deposit amount using the 

Faraday equation (V.2) [9, 10].

Abstract 

Electrochemical deposition of zinc nanorods into the anodic aluminium-oxide 

template from ionic-liquid electrolyte is reported. For the first time, the electrodeposition 

from an ionic liquid is performed in a porous alumina template, anodically grown on the 

aluminium substrate without complete removal of the barrier layer. The two-step process 

was applied; first, with alternating-current pulse nucleation of zinc nanoparticles on the 

bottom of the pores, followed by direct-current growth of the rods. The electrolyte 

consisted of 0.5M ZnCl2 in choline chloride and ethylene glycol in a 1:2 molar ratio. The 

resulting zinc nanorods are approximately 3 µm in length and 70 nm in diameter. The 

achieved fill factor of the pores is in the 70–80% range. 

Keywords: anodic alumina, electrodeposition, ionic liquid, nanorods, porous 

template. 

Introduction 

In recent years, 1D nanostructured metal materials, such as nanowires and 

nanorods, have attracted more and more attention, owing to their applications and uses in 

photonics [1], nanoelectronics [2], catalysis, sensors [3], and so forth. Metallic nanorods 

have been intensively studied for potential use in the fields of high-density data storage 

[4] and biosensing [5]. The deposition of metallic nanorods into pores with a dielectric 

barrier layer has also opened new perspectives for the development of metal–dielectric–

metal subwavelength plasmonic waveguides [6, 7] and, specifically, the one-end-sealed 

metal–insulator–metal waveguides [8] when the bottom of the pore is sealed by a 

dielectric material. Metallic nanorods can be considered as precursors for various 

inorganic compounds after relevant post-treatment. For example, metallic zinc 

nanomaterials can be converted to the semiconducting oxide or sulfide forms, keeping 

the original shape [9]. 

Electrodeposition into porous templates is a relatively simple and cheap method 

for the synthesis of metallic nanomaterials [10-13]. However, the uniform 

electrodeposition of metals into the pores from conventional water-based electrolytes is 

often complicated by number of limiting factors. The electrochemical window of water 

is rather limited, and hydrogen evolution can occur in parallel to the reduction of metal 

cations. It is especially critical when the pores in the template demonstrate a different 

geometry and different local iR drops. Thus, the real applied potential can vary from pore

to pore, causing hydrogen generation in the wider ones. The issue of hydrogen evolution 

can affect the deposited material if the hydrogen is dissolved in the nanorods. This process 

can also cause blocking of the pores, because of the formation of gas bubbles or through 

secondary effects in electrolyte, owing to local alkalinization [14]. 

Electrosynthesis from ionic liquids becomes attractive, owing to the unique 

properties of these electrolytes [15]. Ionic liquids demonstrate significantly wider 

electrochemical windows and higher thermal stability than standard electrolytes. 

Utilization of ionic liquids also allows electrosynthesis of active metallic materials, which 

are impossible in aqueous electrolytes. Several types of metallic nanorods have recently 

been obtained through electrodeposition from ionic liquid into porous polycarbonate and 

oxide templates [16-18]. The electrodeposition of free-standing zinc nanowires from an 

ionic liquid has also been reported recently [19]. The zinc nanostructures were grown in 

the pores of track-etched polycarbonate membranes, which contained a sputtered metallic 

layer, closing the end of the pores from one side and ensuring electrical contact. In the 

case of well-ordered nanostructures, the track-etched membranes cannot be employed, 

because of the random distribution of pores. The oxide templates are usually used in such 

situations. These templates are normally prepared as free-standing membranes with the 

barrier layer removed, and a metallic film is sputtered on the back side to establish an 

effective electrical contact by using a multistage complex process [20]. To the best of our 

knowledge, direct electrodeposition from ionic liquids into alumina templates without the 

removal of the barrier layer has not yet been reported. 

The main aim of this work was to directly electrodeposit metallic nanorods from 

deep eutectic solvents into a porous anodic alumina template on aluminum substrates 

without the removal of the barrier layer. Zinc is used herein as a model system for growing 

the nanorods. Until now, no successful electrodeposition of zinc has been proven in this 

type of template. Moreover, zinc was selected here because of the ease of possible 

sulfurization or oxidation post-treatments, which can confer an ordered array of 

semiconductive nanorods. The obtained results can also be transferred to other metallic 

systems, especially those that are hard to electrodeposit from waterbased solutions. 

A two stage AC/DC process, recently suggested for aqueous electrolytes [21], was 

employed in this work aiming at uniform filling of the pores with metal. In this paper, 

deposition of relatively noble metals such as copper, silver, and cobalt was shown. Zinc 

deposition from aqueous electrolytes was also tried, but without convincing proof of 

metallic zinc deposition.

Experimental 

The annealed aluminium (99.0%) foil was used for preparation of porous 

template. The substrate was mechanically polished (down to grid 4000) followed by the 

chemical polishing in a mixture of phosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid at 70-90oC. 

Finally, the samples were washed with acetone, ethanol and distilled water, and then dried 

in air.  

Two-step anodization of the samples was used in order to form a well-ordered 

alumina template [22]. The first anodization step was performed at constant potential of 

40 V in oxalic acid (0.3M) for 1 hour at temperature about 3°C. The pre-structured 

aluminum surface was obtained after dissolution of the formed oxide in a mixture of 

phosphoric acid and CrO3 at 70-80°C for 5 minutes. The second anodization stage was 

performed at similar condition as the first one with potential drop from 40V to 0V with 

sweep rate 1.3V min-1 after 30 or 60 minutes of potentiostatic polarization. Post-

anodization wall thinning was carried out in 0.3M (COOH)2 at 40
oC for 2.5 hours 

resulting in formation of the template with a pore size of 70 nm and wall thickness 

between the pores in the range of 15-20 nm. The obtained template had 3µm and 1.3µm 

pore length (by SEM measurements) for 60 min and 30 min anodization respectively.  

Preparation of the ionic liquid electrolyte and following electrodeposition 

experiments were held in air. Eutectic solution was prepared by adding 0.5M of 

anhydrous zinc chloride (99.99%) to the mixture of choline chloride (98%) and ethylene 

glycol (99+%) in the molar ratio 1:2. Then the mixture was heated to 60°C and kept at 

this temperature in vacuum during 24 hours in order to dry the electrolyte. 

Electrochemical studies were performed employing a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 

potentiostat using a two electrode cell with graphite rod as a counter electrode. 

Microscopic investigations were carried out using Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron 

microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction 

(XRD) data of the samples were obtained employing a PANalytical X’Pert PRO 

diffractometer (Bragg-Brentano geometry, CuK?-radiation). 

Results and discussion 

A uniform electrodeposition of Zn nanorods in the porous alumina template with 

thin barrier layer is not possible in DC mode. The potentiostatic polarization leads to high 

drop of potential across the barrier film. Therefore the electrochemical reduction of the

metal cations occurs only in some defective zones causing formation of large unordered 

lumps which are growing through porous oxide while most of the pores stay unfilled. The 

dissolution of alumina in the studied ionic liquid does not occur as observed by 

electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (not shown). 

 

 

Figure III. 1 a) Typical shapes of voltage/current pulses applied during the first 

nucleation stage; b) and c) cross-sectional SEM micrographs obtained after first 

stage pulsed electrodeposition from 0.5M ZnCl2 in 1ChCl:2EG for 10 and 30 min 

respectively. 

Another strategy based on high-frequency pulsed electrodeposition with 

asymmetric pulse modulation was employed. The idea was to apply higher frequencies at 

which the impedance modulus of the system decreases at least below 103 Ohm cm-2 in 

order to achieve a reasonable current density. The desirable values of the impedance are 

achieved at frequencies above 10 Hz. Therefore the electrodeposition was performed at 

50, 100 and 200 Hz in order to find an optimal frequency for uniform filling of the pores. 

The application of highest frequency (200 Hz) leads to formation of unordered deposits 

on top of the oxide without filling the pores. This fact can be caused by relatively low 

impedance of the total system including barrier and porous part at such frequencies. Thus 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates

no preferential deposition into pores can be achieved. No clear filling of pores was also 

observed using 50 Hz perturbation. The optimal electrodeposition of Zn was achieved at 

100 Hz as described below.  

A non-symmetric pulsed AC signal with the shape shown in Figure III. 1 was 

applied. The signal was composed by the -9V – +5V sin-wave with total duration (t 

reduction + t oxidation) equal to 10 ms. 100 ms off time was kept between the pulses. 

The strong reduction potential applied to the anodized electrode leads to ‘bridging’ the 

barrier oxide layer. The integral impedance modulus of the oxide film decreases at such 

polarizations by several orders of magnitude (not shown) and make deposition in the 

pores possible. The anodic part of the pulse partially dissolves the deposited Zn. At the 

beginning of the electrodeposition a high Zn electrodeposition current and relatively low 

Zn dissolution current are observed. The reduction/oxidation charge ratio is 4 during the 

period from 120s to 180s. With time the ratio decreases and achieves values close to 1 

after about 6000s (Figure III. 1). The situation when reduction current is equal to the 

oxidation one leads to situation when the amount of electrodeposited zinc is equal to the 

amount of metal dissolved at anodic part of the wave. The steady state is achieved and 

the growth of zinc particles terminates.

Figure III. 2 Chronopotentiometric curve obtained at galvanostatic 

electrodeposition at 5 mA/cm2. The insets show SEM top-view of the sample after 

different times of galvanostatic polarization. 

The zinc nanoparticles are formed at the bottom of all pores as a result of the 

pulsed electrodeposition during 10 minutes (Figure III. 1 b). The nanoparticles do not 

grow significantly when longer pulsed polarization is applied (Figure III. 1 c) since the 

steady state conditions are achieved.  

A second galvanostatic step with 5 mA/cm2 current density was applied to drive 

further growth of zinc nanorods inside the pores. Figure III. 2 demonstrates a 

chronopotentiometric curve during the galvanostatic electrodeposition. The initial 

potential at this stage had value of -4.1V and becomes less negative with time showing 

that electrochemical reduction process is initiated at the bottom of pores. The potential 

value demonstrates a sharp change in the beginning followed by a lower slope 

transformed with time into a plateau-like zone on the curve. This behaviour is associated 

with a steady state electrodeposition process controlled by the diffusion of metallic 

cations into the pores. The continuous slow decrease of polarization is caused by the 

decrease of the diffusion path of cations from the bulk electrolyte to the metal surface in

pores because of continuous filling of the pores with metallic Zn. The uniform filling of 

the pores can be observed at this stage (left inset on Figure III. 2) leading to the situation 

when zinc nanorods reach the surface of template and begin to fuse because of started 

multidirectional growth (middle inset on Figure III. 2). The next stage is formation of 

bulky deposits over whole surface with consequent drop of polarization (Figure III. 2) 

because of increased electroactive surface (Figure III. 2).  

 

 

Figure III. 3 Cross-sectional SEM micrograph of porous alumina template filled 

with zinc after two-stage electrochemical deposition. 

Figure III. 3 shows cross-sectional SEM image of the sample after the complete 2 

steps of the deposition. Uniform complete filling of the pores with zinc nanorods of 3 µm 

length and 70 nm in diameter is observed. The XRD data (not shown) indicate that the 

phase appeared in the anodic template as a result of the deposition is metallic zinc. It also 

does not show any signs of post-oxidation. At least no respective crystalline products are 

observed.  

Conclusions 

The zinc nanorods were deposited from ZnCl2/ChCl:EG ionic deep eutectic 

solvents into porous anodic alumina template without removal the barrier layer. A two-

step electrodeposition pr ocess was developed with pulsed AC pre-deposition nucleation

stage followed by the galvanostatic growth. Highly uniform filling of the pores was 

achieved resulting in formation of nanorods with reproducible geometrical parameters. 

The method allows fabrication of highly-ordered metal-dielectric nanoassemblies 

utilizing fully wet and simple template preparation method as well as non-expensive ionic 

liquids with low sensitivity to humidity.

Abstract 

The direct use of high-ordered porous templates of anodic aluminium oxide for 

formation of nanostructures via electrochemical deposition is difficult because the 

presence of the of barrier alumina layer in the bottom of pores. In this paper, zinc 

electrodeposition from a solution of ZnCl2 in a choline chloride / ethylene glycol eutectic 

mixture on dense alumina layers of different thicknesses was studied. In a potentiostatic 

regime, the deposition on a barrier layer was found to be hardly possible even when the 

layer is a native alumina film (about 2 nm thick). Choline and ethylene glycol form an 

adsorbed stable layer at the alumina/electrolyte interface and thereby block the access of 

zinc chloride anions to the electrode. 

It has been shown that zinc can be directly deposited on a barrier layer by means 

of application of a combined potential mode in which an AC component of 50 mV 

superimposed on the DC potential of -1.6 V. Increasing the temperature of the eutectic 

solution allows zinc electrodeposition in a potentiostatic regime already at 50oC. By 

application of any of these conditions, zinc can be deposited on a barrier alumina layer 

up to about 60 nm thick. The range of frequencies of the AC component and the 

temperature range where the deposition is optimal were considered. The mechanism of 

unblocking of the electrode by the alternating potential and by the temperature rise has 

been suggested.

Introduction 

In the last decade the high-ordered porous templates of anodic aluminium oxide 

(AAO) have widely been used for preparation of 1-D nanostructures [1]. Nanorods and 

other nanostructures are produced using electrochemical deposition that is the most 

conventional and cheap method. However, there is a limitation for application of AAO 

templates that arises from the presence of a barrier layer at the bottom of pores. The 

alumina film formed as a result of anodization or immediate oxidation of aluminium acts 

as a high resistive medium impairing the flow of current.  

Generally, a detached AAO membrane (free AAO) with sputtered metallic contact 

is used for electrofilling of the pores [2-4]. A multi-stage process of removal of both 

substrate and the barrier layer followed by contact deposition is typically applied [5]. 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich

Both stages are time-consuming, require expensive equipment and have a poor 

scalability. In this respect, preparation of 1-D nanostructures by means of direct 

deposition in pores AAO template has a good practical potential. The method is much 

cheaper and faster than a deposition using a detached membrane. A number of ways to 

thin the barrier layer have been reported. The decrease of potential at the end of anodizing 

process [6-8] and dissolution of the oxide layer are the most promising of them. 

Unfortunately, the layer cannot be completely removed by any of these methods, and 

results in difficulties in electrochemical deposition into pores. The direct growth of 

nanostructured materials on barrier alumina layers opens new possibilities, as to create 

different metal-insulator-metal and metal-insulator-semiconductor devices, which can be 

used as sub-wavelength plasmonic waveguides [9, 10] and supercapacitors [11, 12].  

It is well-known that ionic liquids (ILs) demonstrate a number of important 

properties such as negligible vapour pressure, wide electrochemical window and high 

thermal stability [13]. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have similar properties but, in 

contrast to the conventional ILs, DESs are much cheaper, non-toxic, water-/ air- stable, 

and therefore have a good potential for use in industrial scale [14]. Abbott et al. have 

widely studied properties of DESs based on choline chloride namely viscosity and 

conductivity [15, 16]. Electrodeposition of metals [17, 18] and particularly zinc [19-24] 

and Zn-containing alloys [25] from these solvents was explored as well. 

In our previous work [26], we formed zinc nanorods in an AAO template through 

zinc electrodeposition from DES based on choline chloride. Zinc was chosen as a model 

metal for deposition due to possibility of subsequent transformation into semiconductor 

materials such as zinc oxide and zinc sulphide [27]. It is known that the use of DES 

prevents a chemical destruction of the barrier which is typical for acidic/basic aqueous 

electrolytes. An ordered porous template was prepared by anodization of aluminium 

substrate without complete removal of the barrier layer. A two-step process was used; 

pulse nucleation of zinc nanoparticles on the bottom of the pores followed by a growth of 

the rods in a potentiostatic mode. Application of the alternating current [28] (AC) stage 

in the beginning of the process allowed us to deposit zinc in presence of the barrier [26]. 

It has been demonstrated that electrofilling of an AAO template without removal of the 

barrier layer is also feasible as well in aqueous electrolytes [29, 30]. An AC mode method 

or a pulse deposition [31] were shown to be the most promising methods in this respect. 

However, no systematic study of electrodeposition over an aluminium oxide layer has 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates

been reported. The mechanisms of nucleation at the bottom of pores are also not fully 

understood. 

The study of nucleation processes in porous templates is not easy because of the 

fact that the interface is buried. Besides, the diffusion limitations in the pores can create 

interfering effects. In this respect, electrodeposition on flat samples allows to avoid these 

limitations and can serve as an appropriate model process for such study. This work aims 

at investigating ways of zinc electrodeposition from DES based on choline chloride over 

barrier alumina layers in terms of temperature, oxide layer thickness, and potential profile 

applied. Effects of Zn deposition using a potentiostatic (PS) regime and a PS regime 

modified with a small alternating potential (AC-PS) were considered.  

Experimental 

Coupons of aluminium foil (10?5?0.2mm, 99.990%, Goodfellow) and Fluorine 

doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for template preparation. Part 

of their surface was isolated with varnish, giving an electrode working area of about 0.5 

cm2. Before anodization, the metallic electrodes were chemically polished in a mixture of 

phosphoric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid at 70-90oC. Finally, the samples were rinsed with 

acetone, ethanol and distilled water, and then dried in air. 

Preparation of anodized samples 

A Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source 

for sample oxidation. A 0.1 M ammonium pentaborate aqueous solution served as 

electrolyte. A two-step anodization procedure was applied at room temperature. The first 

anodization step was performed in a galvanostatic mode with a current density of 1 

mA/cm2. Platinum foil was used as counter electrode. The process was terminated after 

the desired voltage (10, 20, 40 V) was achieved. The second anodization step was done 

in a potentiostatic regime at the same voltages during 10 min. After the two steps of 

anodization the electrodes were stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the compact 

alumina layer.  

Oxide layer thickness measurements 

Thickness of the layers was measured by Electrochemical Impedance 

Spectroscopy (EIS) and Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES).

The EIS measurements were performed using a Gamry FAS2 Femtostat with a 

PCI4 Controller over a 105 – 10-2 Hz frequency range with a step of 7 points per decade. 

Impedance spectra were recorded applying a 10 mV (rms) sinusoidal perturbation at open 

circuit potential. The measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell (consisting 

of a Mercury/Mercury sulphate reference electrode, a platinum foil as the counter 

electrode and the working electrode with an area of 0.5 cm2). All measurements were 

performed in the Faraday cage to avoid interferences with external electromagnetic fields. 

A 0.1 M ammonium pentaborate aqueous solution was the working electrolyte. The 

impedance plots were fitted using the Echem Analyst software from Gamry Inc. All 

spectra were successfully fitted using a parallel R-C network. 

GDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was completed using a HORIBA 

GD-Profiler 2 with an anode of 4 mm in diameter and operating at a pressure of 650 Pa 

and a power of 10 W. 

Both EIS and GDOES methods gave the same thickness values (Table IV. 1).

Electrodeposition study 

Preparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments were done 

in air atmosphere. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline chloride (ChCl, 

98%) and ethylene glycol (EG, 99+%) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc chloride 

(99.99%) was added to the DES to obtain a 0.1 M solution which was then heated and 

kept at 60 °C under vacuum during 24 h. As-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) was 

either used for electrodeposition or stored in desiccator over P2O5. 

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 

potentiostat. Measurements were performed in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell 

consisting of a platinum wire as reference electrode, graphite rod as counter electrode and 

the working electrode was used. All cyclic voltammetric curves were recorded starting in

the cathodic direction. The potential scan rate was 0.1 V/s in all potentiodynamic 

experiments. 

Investigations of electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis were 

performed using a Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with 

energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). An ImageJ 1.48v image processing software was 

applied for calculation of the electrode areas covered by the deposited zinc. 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS55 

spectrometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate attenuated total reflectance 

(ATR) cell.  

Results and discussion 

Electrodeposition of zinc in potentiostatic (PS) regime  

Initially, zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn on an electrode with a good 

conductivity for characterization of electrochemical properties of the system was tested. 

Typical CV recorded on a FTO electrode in a blank DES as a background solution is 

shown in Figure IV. 1 (dotted line). No electrochemical process is observed in the 

potential range from 0 to -2 V. Such a wide electrochemical window suggests feasibility 

of zinc deposition from a Zn-containing DES. Then, the experiments were performed in 

DES:Zn. It is seen from Figure IV. 1 (solid line) that a cathodic current appears at about 

-1.4 V. Further increase of the cathodic potential leads to onset of a reduction process that 

can be associated with deposition of metallic zinc. Indeed, appearance and growth of a 

zinc layer were observed. The obtained CVs are typical for 3D nucleation followed by 

diffusion limited growth. Similar CVs were previously reported for the case of Zn 

electrodeposition from DES on the different templates [22-24] The anodic process 

responsible for zinc dissolution was detected in the reverse potential scan at -1.25 V. The 

forward-reverse scan after the reduction peak demonstrates a current loop that is typical 

for the nucleation process, with overpotential of 0.15 V.

Figure IV. 1 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on an FTO coated glass electrode 

in blank Ch:EG DES and in DES:Zn. Notice the difference between the y-axis scales 

in the main plot and the inset. 

It was observed that zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn on FTO glass at -1.4 V 

resulted in an island-type metallic layer (3D nucleation) with poor adhesion. When 

deposition was undertaken at -2 V, gas evolution accompanying zinc reduction was 

detected. Hence, both potentials, -1.4 and -2 V, turned out to be not suitable for the 

compact zinc deposition. A mirror-like, solid zinc coating with a strong adhesion was 

obtained at -1.6 V. Therefore this value was used then as a base potential in all deposition 

experiments. 

Zinc electrodeposition on aluminium surface with a native alumina film was 

expected to be different from that on FTO glass due to the presence of barrier layer. 

Indeed, the cathodic current at -1.4 V was much smaller (Figure IV. 2) as compared with 

that on FTO electrode at the same potential value (Figure IV. 1). Keeping the potential at 

-1.6 V for 30 min, zinc was not deposited on the electrode surface. (Figure IV. 3 A). 

Electrodeposition at -2 V and even at -5 V was tried as well. Intense gas evolution was 

observed but no metallic zinc on the electrode surface was found. It was shown in 

literature that trimethylamine [32, 33], hydrogen [24] as well as (in minor amounts) 

chloromethane, dichloromethane and chloroform [32] are the most likely gaseous 

products of cathodic reduction of DES based on ChCl.

Figure IV. 2 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on aluminium electrode with 

native alumina film in blank Ch:EG DES and in DES:Zn. 

These results suggested that the failure in the electrodeposition comes from large 

potential drop at the interface although other electrochemical processes could occur. 

It has been reported that the DES components can form layers on an electrode 

surface [34-36]. Structure and composition of such a layer evidently depend on chemical 

nature of both DES and material of electrode. Based on the research conducted in 

ChCl:EG DESs, it has been suggested that the organic layer is formed by ethylene glycol 

molecules. However, one should notice that the above mentioned studies were performed 

using the electrodes that are free of oxide films, namely Au, Pt, Hg, and glassy carbon. 

Characteristics of the organic layer formed by DES components on an electrode with 

oxide film can differ from that formed on a pure metal (or carbon) electrode. Likely 

variations in composition and/or structure of such a layer can be also caused by the oxide 

film thickness and density. For example, in the case of aluminium electrode, the alumina 

film can be considered as either dielectric or semiconductor depending on thickness and 

defect concentration. Moreover, due to specificity of the oxidation mechanism, the oxide 

film on an aluminium surface is chemically inhomogeneous. The outer interface of such 

a film is rich in oxygen [37] that certainly favours formation of bonds with organic species 

that have OH groups as a constituent. In DES:Zn, such species are choline (Ch cation) 

and ethylene glycol (EG molecule). Therefore, Ch and EG seem to be likely species able 

to form a layer structure on the alumina/electrolyte interface (Figure IV. 4 A). Moreover, 



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich 

94 

 

these organic species are able to create strong hydrogen bonds among themselves thereby 

making the layer structure more stable.

PS mode at 1 kHz (B). SEM image of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic film 

after zinc deposition in an AC-PS mode at 1 kHz (C). The EDS spectrum recorded 

from the sample surface after zinc deposition in an AC-PS mode (15 nm anodic film, 

1 kHz) (D). The deposition time was 30 min. 

It has been found by Abbott et al. [25, 34] that zinc in DES:Zn exists in an anionic 

form as ZnCl4
2-. Therefore application of a constant cathodic potential lowers 

concentration of zinc in a vicinity of the alumina/DES:Zn interface. In ZnCl4
2-, zinc is 

coordinated by four chlorines forming a tetrahedron with the minimal dimension of ~0.7 

nm. Such a big ion can hardly pass through the stable layer of organic species on the 

electrode. As a result, in a PS regime, no zinc deposition occurs (Figure IV. 4 B).

Infrared spectroscopy study  

Nature of the organic layer formed in DES:Zn on aluminium electrode with barrier 

alumina film and its characteristic features as compared with such a layer on a noble metal 

electrode were studied using infrared spectroscopy. FTIR-ATR spectrum of DES:Zn in 

contact with platinum electrode is in Figure IV. 5. The respective spectra of blank DES:Zn 

and blank platinum are shown for comparison. The observed bands in the DES:Zn spectra 

correlate well with the reference spectroscopic data for ethylene glycol and choline 

chloride. One can see that contact of DES:Zn with platinum surface results in no shift of 

the bands characteristic of the blank DES:Zn spectrum thereby suggesting that no 

chemical bonds between the organic species and platinum electrode form.

Figure IV. 5 FTIR-ATR spectra of platinum surface, blank DES:Zn and platinum 

surface in contact with DES:Zn. 

Prior to the infrared spectroscopy study, aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic 

alumina layer was immersed in DES:Zn for 5 min, rinsed in distilled water and then dried 

in nitrogen gas flow. For comparison, an electrode with as-prepared (blank) 15 nm 

alumina layer and an electrode with the 15 nm layer in contact with DES:Zn were studied 

as well. Figure IV. 6 represents the respective FTIR-ATR spectra. The only band at about 

1000 cm-1 associated with longitudinal optical vibrations of the Al-O bonds in alumina is 

seen in the blank alumina spectrum [38]. In the spectra of the alumina films either in 

contact with DES:Zn or after the 5 min immersion in DES:Zn, in addition to this band, 

the modes that are characteristic of the infrared spectrum of this eutectic solution are 

observed, although less intense. In blank DES:Zn, the mode that corresponds to the O-H 

stretching in alcohols is observed at 3310 cm-1, while the same mode for alumina after 

immersion in this eutectic solution is at 3445 cm-1 (Inset A in Figure IV. 6). Such a shift 

in the mode position suggests some interaction between OH groups of the organic species 

in DES and defect outer surface of the anodic alumina film. This shift is considered to 

indicate the formation of a layer of adsorbed organic species on the alumina film surface. 

In the spectrum of alumina in contact with DES:Zn, the O-H stretching mode is also 

shifted in comparison with that of the blank DES:Zn and it is centered at 3357 cm-1. We 

consider that this band has the contribution of the respective modes of both adsorbed 

species and free species, and the contribution from the former is definitely smaller than 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates

that from the latter. Hence, the band position for the alumina in contact with DES:Zn is 

close to that for the blank DES:Zn.  

 

Figure IV. 6 FTIR-ATR spectra of blank DES:Zn, blank anodic alumina film, 

anodic alumina film after a 5 min immersion in DES:Zn and anodic alumina film in 

contact with DES:Zn. Magnified areas of the spectra in the ranges of 2500-4000 cm-

1 (A) and 1000-1600 cm-1 (B). 

The modes associated with C-O vibrations in blank DES:Zn (at 1083 and 1036 

cm-1) are shifted to 1089 and 1041 cm-1, respectively, in DES:Zn in contact with alumina 

(Inset B in Figure IV. 6). As regards the modes related to C-H vibrations that are present 

in the spectra as well, changes in their positions were found to be below the experimental 

error. This suggests that the interaction between the alumina surface and choline / 

ethylene glycol occurs through OH groups of these organic species.

Electrodeposition of zinc in AC-PS regime  

Zinc electrodeposition in the AC-PS regime was studied using the anodized 

samples with a 15 nm alumina layer. A sinusoidal potential of 50 mV amplitude was 

superposed on above the DC potential of -1.6 V at the following frequencies: 1, 10, 10 

Hz; 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 kHz.  

We found out that blocking effect of the choline / ethylene glycol layer can be 

diminished by application of such a combined potential. Indeed, zinc reduction was 

detected in the frequency range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz. It was revealed from SEM/EDS study 

that the observed isolated particles on the electrode surface are metallic zinc (Figure IV. 

3 B, C, and D). Both number and size of the particles were found to increase as the AC-

PS frequency is increased from 1 Hz to 1 kHz. The maximal deposited zinc amount was 

obtained when electrodeposition was performed at 1 kHz (Figure IV. 7).  

 

 

Figure IV. 7 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic 

alumina layer covered by the deposited zinc particles after electrodeposition in AC-

PS mode at different frequencies of the alternating component of the applied 

potential. The deposition in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 2 kHz has not 

been explored. The lines are used to guide eyes. 

Periodic variations of the potential are assumed to disturb the stationary state 

established in the vicinity of cathode as a result of application of the PS regime only. 

Specifically, field-induced vibrations of polar choline cations make the respective organic 

layer on the alumina/electrolyte interface less compact (Figure IV. 4 C). It opens a way 



Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

99 

 

for zinc chloride anions to reach the cathode followed by zinc reduction. Zinc deposition 

was more efficient when the frequency of the alternating component was 1 kHz (Figure 

IV. 3 B, C and Figure IV. 7). When the frequency increases the relatively heavy choline 

ions are not able to move substantially during the potential cycles. Thus, due to inertia of 

the choline cations the respective layer keeps compact. Periodic variations of the applied 

potential with frequency of 2 kHz and above do not disturb the stationary state and zinc 

deposition remains impossible.  

Effect of temperature 

The process of zinc electrodeposition on a barrier alumina layer was also studied 

as a function of the electrolyte temperature. Deposition experiments in the PS regime and 

AC-PS regime with the applied potentials of -1.6 V and -1.6 V overlaid with a sinusoidal 

potential of 50 mV at 1 kHz, respectively, on a 15 nm alumina layer at 25, 50, 75 and 

100oC were performed.  

The electrical properties of alumina layers before and after 30 min immersion in 

DES:Zn at each temperature was controlled by EIS. No significant change in EIS spectra 

of barrier layers has been observed. The high-frequency part of the spectra was found to 

be the same for all samples regardless of the temperature.  

 

 

Figure IV. 8 Cyclic voltammetric curves recorded on aluminium electrode with a 15 

nm anodic alumina layer in DES:Zn at 25, 50, 75 and 100oC.

Increasing temperature was found to allow zinc electrodeposition from DES:Zn 

even in the potentiostatic regime. It is seen from the CV curves in Figure IV. 8 that already 

at 50?? a zinc oxidation peak appears and increases with temperature. Indeed, a PS 

electrodeposition at 50oC resulted in formation of isolated particles of zinc on the 

electrode surface while no deposit was detected in the same experiments at room 

temperature (Figure IV. 9). It should be noticed that application of the alternating 

component at this temperature still enhanced the deposition: the zinc coated area after 

AC-PS-mode deposition was almost two times larger than that when the PS regime was 

only applied. However, at 100oC, the amount of the deposited zinc turned out to be the 

same regardless of the deposition regime (either PS or AC-PS) used (Figure IV. 9).  

 

 

Figure IV. 9 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode with a 15 nm anodic 

alumina layer covered by the deposited zinc particles after electrodeposition either 

in PS mode or in AC-PS mode at different temperatures. Solid lines are used to guide 

eyes. 

Therefore, increasing temperature gives qualitatively the same result as that 

caused by application of an alternating potential component. In fact, in both cases the zinc 

deposition on a barrier alumina layer can be described using the same mechanism. 

Vibrations of choline cations and ethylene glycol molecules, which make the blocking 

layer of the organic species permeable to zinc chloride anions, can be induced both by 

alternating applied potential and by thermal agitation (Figure IV. 4 D).

Effect of the alumina barrier layer thickness  

Effect of the barrier layer thickness was studied at room temperature using either 

samples with a native alumina film (~2 nm thick) or anodized samples with barrier layers 

of 15, 27 and 54 nm thick. Experiments were performed in the AC-PS regime at 1 kHz 

for 30 min.  

It was found from SEM study that the morphology of the zinc particles and their 

quantity per unit area are approximately the same in cases of deposition on a native layer 

and on a 15 nm alumina layer. However, the particles deposited on the thicker layer were 

rather smaller. Therefore, one can suggest that the zinc nucleation rate was equal in both 

cases while the particle growth rate was bigger when zinc was deposited on a native layer. 

Figure IV. 10 shows the relative electrode area covered by zinc particles as a function of 

the alumina layer thickness. One can see that the deposition rate decreases strongly when 

crossing from a native alumina film to a 15 nm layer. Deposition on a 54 nm layer is still 

possible but with much smaller amount of zinc particles.  

 

Figure IV. 10 Relative surface area of aluminium electrode either with native 

alumina layer or with anodic alumina layers of different thicknesses covered by the 

deposited zinc particles after electrodeposition in AC-PS mode at 1 kHz. Solid lines 

are used to guide eyes. 

Further experiments have revealed that zinc deposition on barrier layers is 

possible when frequency of the alternating component of the applied potential is within 

the range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz regardless of the barrier layer thickness unless it exceeds ~60

nm. The difficulty in depositing zinc on a thicker barrier layer is caused by increasing 

resistance of the layer. 

Conclusions 

Potentiostatic deposition of zinc from a 0.1 M ZnCl2 solution in a choline 

chloride/ethylene glycol eutectic mixture on an alumina barrier layer at room temperature 

is impossible even if the layer thickness does not exceed ~2 nm (a native alumina film), 

although zinc is easily deposited at -1.4 V from the same solution on a FTO glass 

electrode. In the case of deposition on alumina layers, the cathodic current is negligible 

at the same potential.  Intense gas evolution is observed when -2 V and higher potentials 

are applied but no zinc deposition occurs.  

Choline and ethylene glycol adsorb on alumina surface. Due to interaction 

between OH groups of these organic species with the oxygen-reach outer part of the 

alumina film, stable layer structures in the alumina/electrolyte interface are formed which 

block the access of zinc chloride anions to the cathode in a potentiostatic regime.  

Application of the potential of -1.6 V superimposed with alternating sinusoidal 

component of 50 mV allows to deposit zinc both on native alumina film and on anodic 

layers up to about 60 nm thick when the frequency of the alternating component is within 

the range of 1 Hz - 1 kHz. Periodic variations of the potential disturb the stationary state 

of the choline cations making the respective organic layer in the alumina/electrolyte 

interface less compact and permeable to zinc chloride anions. The deposition rate 

decreases when the potential frequency is 2 kHz and above - relatively heavy organic 

species are not able to follow the cycling potential variations.  

Increasing the temperature has the same effect as the use of an alternating 

component over the DC potential. Electrodeposition of zinc on a barrier layer at 100oC is 

possible even in potentiostatic regime.

Abstract 

Zinc electrodeposition from a deep eutectic mixture of ZnCl2 and choline 

chloride/ethylene glycol on titanium covered by an anodic titania film of different 

thicknesses was studied. It was shown that thin titanium dioxide layers work as high 

resistive media and the rate of zinc deposition decreases with film thickness. Thicker 

titania layers (23 nm and higher) have opposite properties and the zinc reduction rate 

starts gradually increasing with thickness. This happens because at the higher voltage 

necessary to grow thicker anodic films they become more crystalline and consequently 

more conductive. 

There is also evidence that in deep eutectic solvent no dense organic layer forms 

on the titanium/titania electrodes. The application of an AC signal superimposed on a DC 

potential only marginally increases the amount of zinc deposited and FTIR measurements 

did not reveal the formation of any chemical bonds between the film and deep eutectic 

solvent. 

Zn deposition onto titanium/titania at -1.6V is characterised by instantaneous 

three-dimensional nucleation mechanism, which is independent of the titania thickness. 

Keywords: Titanium oxide, deep eutectic solvent, zinc electrodeposition. 

Introduction 

Electrochemical deposition is a conventional and cheap technique to form 1-D 

nanostructures. In most of the cases, porous anodic templates on the valve metals are 

used. Filling of the matrices by other materials is applied to produce solid state solar cells, 

photodetectors, magnetic sensors, metal–insulator–metal capacitors [1] etc. The major 

drawback of the porous anodic oxide templates is a barrier layer on the bottom of pores, 

which usually acts as a high resistive medium impairing the flow of current. 

Direct investigation of deposition and nucleation processes in porous templates is 

challenging because the interface is hidden. Electrodeposition on flat samples allows to 

avoid these limitations and can serve as an appropriate model process for such study. 

However extrapolation of results found on a bare metal electrode to the processes on the 

bottom of pores is incorrect because of critical differences between metal/electrolyte and 

barrier oxide/electrolyte interfaces. Consequently, the use of a metallic electrode covered 

by the anodic oxide layer is one of the most convenient ways to study the bottom 

processes. In our previous work [2] zinc electrodeposition from a solution of ZnCl2 in a

choline chloride / ethylene glycol eutectic mixture on dense alumina layers of different 

thicknesses was studied. It was shown that the potentiostatic deposition of zinc on an 

alumina barrier layer at -1.6V and room temperature is impossible even if the layer 

thickness does not exceed ~2 nm (a native alumina film). As a comparison, zinc is easily 

deposited at -1.4 V from the same solution on a fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass 

electrode. The formation of a dense organic layer due to interaction between OH groups 

of the organic species with the alumina film was demonstrated. Moreover deposition has 

been shown to be possible by superimposing an alternating sinusoidal voltage on DC 

potential (-1.6V) or alternatively increasing the solution temperature [2]. 

The current paper is devoted to studying of electrodeposition of zinc from choline 

based eutectic on anodic titanium oxide film. Bulk anodic titania has been investigated 

for more than 50 years. Several properties such as growth factors [3-8], crystallinity [1, 

9-12], conductivity, influence of anodization solution and regime [13] were widely 

studied by different authors. Despite all these studies deposition over anodic titania is still 

hardly understood. Only works about deposition of copper on titanium oxide films from 

water solution were described in literature [14, 15]. Electrodeposition of metals from deep 

eutectic solvent (DES) on titania covered electrodes has not yet been analysed. 

Titanium dioxide films both in pure state and after electrochemical modification 

have distinguished properties, for instance, catalytic and photocatalytic [16, 17], self-

cleaning and wetting [18], use as solar cell [19] and optical devices [20]. Furthermore, 

anodic titania is a promising porous matrix to be filled by different materials [21-23].  

Deep eutectic solvent based on choline chloride was selected as electrolyte for 

deposition due to its properties, such as negligible vapour pressure, wide electrochemical 

window and high thermal stability [24]. Choline eutectic is often called in literature as 

quasi ionic liquid since their behaviour is similar, for instance, low melting point, 

relatively wide liquid-range etc. However, in contrast to conventional ionic liquids, DESs 

are very cheap, not-toxic and have good potential for industrial usage [25]. Abbott et al. 

have widely studied properties of DESs based on choline chloride, namely viscosity and 

conductivity [26, 27]. Electrodeposition of metals [28, 29] and particularly zinc [30-36] 

and Zn-containing alloys [37] from these solvents was explored as well. Moreover the 

use of DES as electrolyte gives an opportunity to dissolve compounds which are insoluble 

in water (for example ZnO) and to make deposition from these solutions [35, 38].  

In the present work zinc was chosen as a material to be deposited due to its 

capability to transform afterwards into semiconductor materials such as zinc oxide and

zinc sulphide [39] and for comparison of the results with previous work [2] where 

deposition of zinc on aluminium/alumina was reported. 

Experimental 

Coupons of titanium foil (100mm ?5mm ?1 mm, 99.2%, Alfa Aesar) were used 

as electrode material for sample preparation. The coupons were rinsed with acetone, 

ethanol and distilled water and then were dried in air. Before anodization, the electrodes 

were chemically polished in a HF:HNO3 mixture (1:3 by volume) to mirror finish and 

finally were rinsed with deionized water. Part of their surface was isolated with 

chemically resistant varnish, giving an electrode working area of 0.5 cm2. The sample 

with the thinnest barrier layer was prepared by activation in hydrofluoric acid. It is a 

common procedure before plating and it results in decrease of the native layer thickness 

due to formation of soluble titanium fluorides. Formation of titanium hydride takes also 

place [40] and this layer prevents generation of a new barrier layer [41]. The activation 

was performed in 5% HF during 30 seconds.  

A Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source 

for the sample anodizing. A 1M sulphuric acid aqueous solution was used as electrolyte 

[12]. The anodization was performed in a galvanostatic mode with a current density of 10 

mA/cm2. The counter electrode was a platinum foil. The process was terminated after the 

desired voltage (3, 7, 10, 20, 40 V) was attained. The thinnest anodic film used in this 

work (12 nm) corresponds to 3V. Preparation of thinner anodic titania layers is hindered 

because of low reproducibility of the experiments and inhomogeneity of the films. After 

anodization the electrodes were stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the compact 

titania layer for 24 hours.  

Thickness of the layers was measured by Ellipsometry and Glow Discharge 

Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES). The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements 

were made using an AutoSE ellipsometer (HORIBA Scientific) with a total of 250 points 

in the wavelength interval 450-850 nm, an incidence angle of 70o, a signal quality of 30 

and a measurement spot area of 250×250 µm2. The structural model used consists of a 

three-layered structure incorporating substrate, titania layer and air as ambient medium 

with a refractive index value of 1.00. The thickness of the substrate was considered 

infinite and the refractive index was obtained by direct inversion of the ellipsometric data.

To describe the refractive index values the Lorentz model was used, which expresses the 

relative complex dielectric constant as a function of the frequency (?) described by:

where ??, ?s, ?0 (eV), ? (eV) are the high frequency relative dielectric constant, 

the static relative dielectric constant, the oscillator resonant frequency and the damping 

factor, respectively [42]. The fitting method has been described elsewhere [43]. The 

reported values for the thickness are the average of three measurements performed for 

each sample with a maximum standard deviation of 5%.  

 GDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was done using a HORIBA GD-

Profiler 2 with a copper anode of 4 mm in diameter. Argon sputtering of the sample 

surface occurred at a pressure of 900 Pa and power of 10 W. A minimum of three 

measurements were performed for each sample. 

Preparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments have been 

done in contact with air. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline chloride 

(ChCl, 98%) and ethylene glycol (EG, 99+%) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc 

chloride (99.99%) was added to the DES to obtain a 0.3 M solution, which was heated 

and kept at 60 °C under vacuum during 24 h. The as-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) 

was either used for electrodeposition or was stored in a desiccator over P2O5. All 

experiments were performed in open air because the DES is water and air stable and it is 

one of the main advantages of this electrolyte compared to ionic liquids. Moreover, it is 

not sensitive even to small amount of water [24]. When not in use the DES was stored in 

the desiccator with P2O5.  

Voltammograms were recorded using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 potentiostat. 

Measurements were performed in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell consisting of a 

platinum wire as pseudo-reference electrode, graphite rod as counter electrode and the 

working electrode was used. All voltammetric curves were recorded starting in the 

cathodic direction. In all potentiodynamic experiments, the potential scan rate was 20 

mV/s. Each measurement was repeated minimum twice for reproducibility checking.  

Investigation of electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis were 

performed using a Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an

energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). An ImageJ 1.48v image processing software was 

applied for calculation of the electrode areas covered by the deposited zinc. 

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with the use of a 

Bruker IFS55 spectrometer equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate attenuated 

total reflectance (ATR) cell. In the optical range of 350-4000 cm-1, 128 scans were 

performed for each measurement. The resolution of the equipment is 4 cm-1. Templates 

were prepared on thin titanium substrate (0.1 mm) involving the procedure that has been 

described before. The samples were installed in contact with the DES:Zn and pressured 

to the crystal. 

A Digital Instruments NanoScope III atomic force microscope (AFM) system with 

ExtenderTM Electronic Module was used for acquisition of topography. The 

measurements were performed with highly doped Si AFM probes purchased from App 

Nano (model ACT). The probes had the following characteristics: tip pyramid height 14-

16 ?m, tip radius&amp;lt;10 nm, 300 kHz resonance frequency, spring constant around 37 N/m. 

Results and discussion 

Titanium anodization 

Figure V. 1 a shows the dependence of the signal intensity of the elements 

composing the titanium anodized layer (40 V) on its depth obtained by GDOES. It 

demonstrates homogeneity of the oxide film and uniformity of sulphur distribution. 

Sulphur is present in the titania film because sulphuric acid solution was used as an 

electrolyte. Deviation of the profiles at the beginning of sputtering can be explained by 

the presence of an adsorbed layer on the surface containing sulphur and oxygen, probably 

from the sulphuric acid. The oxygen concentration slightly decreases throughout the film 

because oxygen migration occurs during the anodization process, from the electrolyte to 

the electrode leading to higher concentration of oxygen on the titania/electrolyte surface 

than on titania/titanium interface. A well-defined interface between the anodic titania film 

and the titanium substrate was obtained. The plateau on the titanium and oxygen signal 

intensity curves during the glow discharge etching process corresponds to the oxide layer. 

Further growth of the titanium signal indicates that the metal sputtering started.

voltages for Ti, O, S after anodization at 40 V (a), and for titanium after anodization 

at 3, 7, 10, 20 and 40 V (b). 

Ellipsometry measurements were done in parallel to GDOES and data fitting were 

performed using the Lorentz model. Both the techniques showed similar results in terms 

of thickness/voltage ratio for instance at 5 and 20 volts the ellipsometry results are 15 nm 

and 44 nm respectively, whereas the GDOES technique estimates 12 and 43 nm. 

Routinely, the oxide thickness of the samples was controlled and presented (Figure V. 2) 

only for GDOES due to similarity of the results.

The GDOES data of Figure V. 2 shows that the thickness-voltage ratio for the 

galvanostatic growth of anodic TiO2 is in the range of 2–3 nm/V, which is in accordance

with the values commonly reported in literature for titania anodic films grown in sulphuric 

acid solutions [3-8]. 

Zinc electrodeposition on Ti/TiO2 electrodes with different film 

thicknesses  

Typical voltammograms that were obtained on zinc and on titanium electrode 

covered with compact titania film in DES:Zn are presented in Figure V. 3. The potential 

for reduction of zinc on zinc electrode is -1.1V (Figure V. 3). Nevertheless, the negative 

current was only detected at -1.2V on the titanium/titania electrode after pre-treatment 

(activation) in hydrofluoric acid, which evidences the existence of an overpotential for 

zinc reduction on the titania surface. Fast current increase followed by a plateau was 

observed for these electrodes. Strong cathodic current appears at -1.65V and corresponds 

to reduction of the electrolyte organic species. Decomposition occurs according to the 

mechanism described in literature [44, 45]. The small current that appears on the titania 

covered electrodes probably corresponds to reduction of titania [23] since zinc was not 

detected on the surface by SEM studies in this potential region. Electroreduction of zinc 

was performed in the range from -1.2V to -1.7V with a 100mV step to find the best 

physical properties of the deposit. The quality of the coating was evaluated visually. The 

deposition potential of -1.6V was selected because it gives solid zinc coating with the best 

adhesive properties.

Initial increase in the barrier layer thickness from the one corresponding to the HF 

activated electrode until 12 nm obtained by anodizing leads to a strong decrease of the 

reduction current (Figure V. 3). It is typical for valve metals because of low conductivity 

of the oxide film. Normally, the resistance of the film rises with its growth, which makes 

the deposition difficult. This situation was demonstrated for the like aluminium/alumina 

system in our previous work [2]. Increasing the alumina barrier thickness provides 

significant increase of the resistance and consequently decrease of the zinc reduction 

current. Nevertheless, in the present case, the negative current on the titanium/titania 

electrode with 18 nm titania film stays on the same level as with 12 nm thickness (Figure 

V. 3). Moreover, with further increment of thickness to 23 nm and thicker, the current 

rises, contrary to the case of alumina where the current decreases dramatically with 

growth of the film. The maximum current on titanium/titania electrode was obtained at 

maximal film thickness of 84 nm, and is similar to the current on the activated electrode 

(Figure V. 3). The phenomenon of current increase on thicker anodic titania films was 

demonstrated in Hyun Chang’s work for copper deposition from water solution [15]. The 

authors modified the Ti cathode surface by temperature oxidation and anodization 

process. Both cases showed enhanced deposition rate because the film is more conductive 

in spite of the oxide layer is thicker. They explained this fact by better crystallinity of the 

anodic film at higher anodization voltage and correspondingly at higher film thickness. 

Similar conclusion was achieved by Shibata et Zhu [9]. The structure of the anodic oxide 

film on titanium was found to be dependent on the formation potential. Film 

crystallization occurs at potentials more positive than 7.0 V. In the present work it can be 

suggested an analogous explanation for the current increment. The oxide layer remains 

amorphous on the initial stage of the growth and the conductivity decreases with film 

thickness (12 and 18 nm films). After reaching a critical anodization voltage, the anodic 

layer starts crystallizing, which results in higher current for the 23 nm barrier film (limit 

voltage of 10V) compared to the 12 and 18 nm films (limit voltage of 3 and 7V, 

respectively). The film crystallinity and conductivity progressively increase with 

additional accretion of the barrier, which reflects on the voltammetric curves as increase 

of current (Figure V. 3). These results are in accordance with Shibata’s work [9] where it 

was demonstrated that the crystallization starts after the anodization potential of 7 V. 

Figure V. 4 a depicts the current-time transients resulting from 

chronoamperometric experiments on titanium electrode covered with titania of different 

thicknesses at -1.6 V. The maximum of current was not detected for the HF activated

specimen. The initial high current is decreasing according to the Cottrell equation [46]. It 

means that the nuclei formation in this case occurs fast and easily. The layer of titanium 

hydride formed on the electrode after activation is one of the conditions that probably 

promotes nucleation process due to the strong reducing ability of the compound. Zinc 

deposition on the activated electrode is much faster than on thin barrier layers (12, 18 nm 

thick). The total electric charge starts to increase for the 23 nm layer and rises as the layer 

thickness grows. In our previous work [2], it was demonstrated that electrodepostion of 

zinc on native alumina layer (around 2 nm) was impossible in standard potentiostatic 

regime. Even after shifting the potential into the deep cathodic region (-5V) where intense 

gas evolution was observed there was no deposition of zinc on the electrode surface.

titania calculated by ImageJ software (black line) and by Faraday's law (red line). 

Deposition dwell was 30 s. Solid lines are used to guide eyes. 

Analysis of SEM images of the samples was performed to confirm that the current 

increase corresponds to the growth of the zinc deposition rate and not to additional 

competitive reactions (as in the case of aluminium/alumina). The typical image obtained 

for deposited zinc on titania film, 23nm thick, at E = ?1.6V, is shown in Figure V. 6 a 

and in the inset after processing by ImageJ. At the early stages of Zn deposition (30 

seconds) individual spherical particles with size d = 40 nm were formed. EDS analysis 

(Figure V. 6 c) shows the presence of Zn. The number and average size of the particles 

were determined in the same way for all the samples. For the sake of simplicity it was 

assumed that the particles are spherical. Then the zinc volume was calculated and the 

chemical amount of the deposit obtained. The results demonstrate that the quantity of zinc 

deposited on the surface increases with the barrier thickness growth (Figure V. 5, black 

line). The difference between the black and red lines could be because the deposition 

process efficiency is not 100% (around 60%).

recorded from the sample surface after zinc deposition in DC mode (23 nm anodic 

film) (c). Deposition dwell was 30 s. 

As it has been mentioned in the introduction a strong interaction between the 

solution eutectic components and alumina interface was observed during deposition on 

anodic alumina in our previous work [2]. Additional AC component superimposed on 

constant DC potential makes the organic layer on the alumina/electrolyte interface less 

compact and more permeable to zinc chloride anions. The positive influence of this 

regime, such as growth of zinc reduction rate, for electrodeposition on the 

aluminium/alumina system was demonstrated. Identical study in this work was performed 

using a sinusoidal potential of 50 mV amplitude superimposed on the DC potential of -

1.6 V at the 1 kHz frequency. Specimens with titania layers of 12, 18, 23, 43 and 84 nm 

were used. Typical SEM images of the electrode surface after 30 seconds of zinc 

deposition on the titanium electrode covered with 23 nm titania film is presented in Figure 

V. 6 b.  



PhD thesis of Maksim Starykevich

The particles size on the electrode after AC-PS mode deposition is bigger than on 

DC (PS) mode, but the number of the particles is less. The quantity of deposited zinc in 

both modes was estimated by the same way using ImageJ and it is 1.5 times less in 

potentiostatic mode than in the AC-PS regime. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a 

small influence of the AC component on the deposition process. Increase of the zinc 

amount was much smaller in comparison with the aluminium/alumina system where it 

was found an increase of 10 times at the same conditions [2]. The small difference 

observed can be explained by additional “electro stirring” on the AC-PS mode, i.e., 

transport of charged species due to the alternating electric field. The dense organic layer 

formed in the case of alumina/aluminium system might not exist in the case of 

titanium/titania. 

FTIR measurements were carried out to confirm that this organic layer does not 

form. FTIR-ATR spectra of DES:Zn in contact with titanium electrodes covered by titania 

are presented in Figure V. 7. The respective spectrum of blank DES:Zn is shown for 

comparison. The observed bands in the DES:Zn spectra correlate well with the reference 

spectroscopic data for ethylene glycol and choline chloride. One can see that contact of 

DES:Zn with the electrode surface results in no shift of the characteristic bands. It differs 

from the case of alumina/DES interface where a O-H stretching shift around 135 cm-1 

was found [2]. Thereby we anticipate that no chemical bonds were formed between the 

organic species and the titanium/titania electrode. Titanium/titania and 

aluminium/alumina systems despite chemical similarity demonstrated different properties 

in terms of interaction with DES.

Zinc nucleation mechanism 

Electrodeposition of metals on an electrode with low chemical affinity to 

electrodeposited metal usually occurs with overvoltage and involves three-dimensional 

nucleation with hemispherical growth of the nuclei [47]. There are two limiting cases of 

three-dimensional nucleation: instantaneous and progressive. In the instantaneous model 

practically all nucleation sites are activated in a short time after potential is applied. 

Progressive model is the situation when the nucleation sites become activated during the 

experiment. In the description below, we use the expressions instantaneous and 

progressive models in the sense that it is closer to one or the other mechanism, although 

we are aware that these are limiting cases. 

Deep understanding of the nucleation process and other processes, which occur in 

the beginning of the deposition, is extremely important since the initial stage of the 

process is crucial to the properties and structure of the deposited materials. For example, 

in the same titania matrix, inside and over the tubes is possible to obtain different 

structures such as nanowires, nanotubes, sandwich and coaxial multilayer structures. 

The mechanism of nucleation and growth can be determined by graphical analysis 

of the current transients from chronoamperometric measurements. Such an approach has 

been commonly used in studies for metal nucleation on different substrates (Ge, Si, W, 

vitreous carbon, etc.) [36, 47-50]. Transition from instantaneous to progressive nucleation 

mechanism could occur with decrease of deposition overvoltage [51]. To detect the 

potential of this transition, current-time transients at different applied potentials were 

recorded on a titanium electrode covered with a 23 nm titania film (Figure V. 8 a). The 

transients are characterized by an initial increase of current followed by a drop at longer 

time. We believe, that the nucleation process matches to 3D mechanism due to the high 

deposition overpotential (about 100 mV) and is followed by diffusion-limited growth 

because of the transient shape [47]. The deposition transients acquired at different 

overvoltages were plotted in dimensionless form by normalizing the current (j) and time 

(t) respectively to the maximum current (jmax) and time (tmax) where the maximum current 

is reached, Figure V. 8 b.

where t0 is the induction time, i.e. the time needed to form a nucleus larger than 

the critical nucleus size. The respective plots are also shown in Figure V. 8 b (solid lines). 

Electrocrystallization of zinc in the potential range from -1.4 to -1.6 V fits well the 

instantaneous mechanism. However, the curve recorded at more positive potential, -1.3 

V, shifts towards to the progressive nucleation theoretical curve and it is situated between 

instantaneous and progressive theoretical curves. The mechanism determination at higher 

voltages (where it could be found better overlapping of the theoretical curve) is hindered 

because the peak maximum is not evident at potentials greater than -1.3 V. 

Chronoamperometric curves in Figure V. 4 a were replotted in dimensionless form 

(Figure V. 4 b). The plot for the activated electrode is not in the figure since the maximum 

on current time transient is absent as already explained in previous section.

The theoretical plots are also shown in Figure V. 4 b. Comparing the theoretical 

plots for progressive and instantaneous nucleation with the experimental plots for zinc 

reduction, it can be concluded that Zn deposition onto titanium/titania electrode proceeds 

by instantaneous three-dimensional nucleation. The mechanism is independent of the 

titania thickness and denotes that practically all Zn nuclei on the electrode surface are 

formed at once and have the same size. These results correlate with the work of Abbott 

et al. [30] where they reported that the electrodeposition of electronegative metals such 

as aluminium and zinc in ionic liquids occurs by instantaneous nucleation mechanism 

irrespectively of the ions or substrate material. Deviation from the theoretical curves after 

tmax&gt;1 is probably related to accessory processes such as hydrogen and dioxolanes 

formation [44, 45, 53]. This has been also reported for different deep eutectic solvents, as 

choline chloride and ethylene glycol DES [36]. Abbott et al. also demonstrated high 

mismatch between the experimental curves and the theoretical ones and explained it by 

specific adsorption of species on the electrode surface, apparently chloride ions [30]. In 

case of one side reaction, like hydrogen reduction, its contribution to the current could be 

mathematically extracted by using multiparametric model [54]. However, there is no 

unanimity in the origin and number of side reactions at low cathodic potentials in DES 

[36, 44, 45]. The impact of side reactions to overall current could be addressed in future 

studies.  

The nucleation mechanism was additionally verified by AFM study. AFM 

measurements were performed on titanium electrode covered by 84 nm titania film at -

1.6 V potential. Figure V. 9 shows AFM images of the electrode surface (area 5x5 µm) 

after different times of deposition. The blank surface before application of potential is 

shown in Figure V. 9 a. The surface is not perfectly flat, revealing big irregularities. After 

the initial 1.5 second of deposition formation of particles with sizes of ca. 85 nm on the 

electrode surface was observed (Figure V. 9 b). Increasing the deposition time results in 

gradual increase of particles sizes: 120 and 170 nm for deposition times of 4 and 9 seconds 

(Figure V. 9 c, d), respectively. Statistically insignificant variations in number of particles 

per unit surface area at the different deposition times indicate that nucleation rate is much 

lower than the growth rate, clearly pointing to instantaneous nucleation.

zinc electrodeposition in DES:Zn at -1.6V: during 1.5 s (b); 4 s (c) and 9 s (d). 

Conclusions 

Electrodeposition of zinc from 0.3M ZnCl2 solution in choline chloride/ethylene 

glycol eutectic solvent on titania barrier layer was successfully performed. Reduction of 

zinc species occurs much faster on thicker anodic films than on thinner ones. The 

chemical amount of reduced metallic zinc at -1.6 V during 30 seconds is 4 times higher 

on 84 nm thick films than on 12 nm ones. It happens because both film thickness and 

crystallinity grow with the anodization potential, the latter leading to higher oxide 

conductivity. Application of -1.6V DC potential, superimposed by an alternating 

sinusoidal component of 50 mV, leads to moderate increase of the amount of zinc 

reduced. Regarding this fact and additional FTIR results it is assumed that there is no

123 

 

formation of a dense organic layer on titanium/titania electrode contrary to the 

aluminium/alumina system. Thus, zinc deposition becomes easier. 

Electrodeposition of zinc at -1.6 V from DES occurs by the instantaneous three-

dimensional nucleation mechanism and it is not influenced by the titania layer thickness. 

This result was confirmed by AFM studies. A trend for transition from instantaneous 

nucleation mechanism to progressive one seems to occur at deposition potential of  

-1.3 V.

Abstract 

Zinc electrochemical deposition in porous anodic titania from 0.5M ZnCl2 solution 

in choline chloride based deep eutectic solvent is reported. Electroreduction is performed 

by a pulse method in titanium dioxide templates modified in three different ways. Titania 

nanotubes were formed in ethylene glycol based electrolyte with 0.38% (wt.) ammonium 

fluoride and 1.79% (wt.) of water. The first template has been used as-prepared, without 

any modification. Such a matrix shows a low fill-factor and zinc electrodeposition mainly 

occurs on the top of the tubes. The next template was annealed at 450oC to complete 

crystallization of titania. It results in electrodeposition of zinc along the entire tube surface 

and consequently in formation of coaxial structure. The third template was modified 

based on selective crystallization of the pore bottoms using higher anodisation voltage 

(80 V) than the one used for tubes formation (40 V) in sulphuric acid electrolyte. The 

successful bottom-up filling of the titania nanotubes is demonstrated in this case. 

Investigation of the tubes filling is performed by a set of complementary techniques such 

as GDOES, SEM and TEM.

Introduction  

Recently, porous anodic films on valve metals such as aluminium [1], zirconium 

[2, 3], iron [4], titanium [3, 5] etc., attract great attention due to wide range of applications. 

One of the most important uses of the templates is electroformation of nanorods [6] and 

nanowires. The parameters of matrix such as length and diameter of the pores, wall 

thickness can be easily controlled [7] by composition of the anodisation solution [8-11], 

its temperature [12, 13] or the applied voltage [14, 15].  

Titanium dioxide has semiconductive properties that advantageously differentiate 

it from many other porous anodic layers. Additionally, it reveals common porous anodic 

template characteristics such as high regularity, homogeneity of the layer etc. However, 

there is scant work on application of porous anodic titania (PAT) as a matrix for 

electropreparation of metallic or other conductive nanowires, when compared with a 

growing number of existing studies of the “sister material” porous alumina. Moreover, 

the majority of both templates studies was performed with detached oxide template

instead having them attached to the metal electrode [16-19]. The use of the detached 

template leads to increase of cost and time due to the additional step of substrate removal 

and evaporation of an electrical contact. There were several attempts to perform 

deposition directly in the pores without removing the original substrate. Macak et al [20] 

have reported increasing the conductivity of the bottom part of the tubes via proton 

intercalation (Ti4+ + e- + H+ ? Ti3+H+). 

Porous titania template can be formed in a number of inorganic solutions 

containing sulphate [21], phosphate [10, 22], acetate [23] ions etc. or in organic solutions 

[5] which are based on glycerol [15], ethylene glycol etc. The presence of fluoride ions is 

mandatory for all these electrolytes, otherwise a dense oxide layer will form instead of a 

porous one. In the current work we have used ethylene glycol based electrolyte for 

formation of the pores with several micrometres length and with very smooth walls.  

Electrodeposition of active metals from water based solutions is difficult or even 

impossible. Ionic liquids are promising electrolytes in this area, because they demonstrate 

unique properties such as wide electrochemical window, high thermal stability, 

conductivity, negligible vapour pressure, etc [24]. High price and water sensitivity are the 

biggest disadvantages of classical ionic liquids. Deep eutectic solvents [25] (DES) are a 

cheap alternative to common ionic liquids with similar physicochemical properties. DES 

are non-toxic, water-/air- stable and also have good potential to be scaled up to industrial 

level [25]. Choline chloride based DES is one of the alternative green solvents. Several 

groups have studied in detail the properties of the choline chloride DES. Abbott et al. has 

studied viscosity and conductivity [26, 27] and influence of different hydrogen bond 

donors [28, 29]. Moreover, electrodeposition of different metals such as zinc [30-36], tin 

[37], silver [38] and alloys [39] is under intensive investigation. 

In our previous works we have studied zinc electrodeposition from choline chloride 

(ChCl):ethylene glycol (EG) DES on bulk anodic titania [40]. It was found that 

electrodeposition on a thick titanium dioxide layer occurred faster than on a thin film. 

Taking into account previous studies [41] it was suggested that crystallinity of the films 

formed at higher anodising voltage (and correspondingly thicker ones) is better. 

The main aim of present work is the investigation of direct electrodeposition of 

metallic nanorods from deep eutectic solvent into porous anodic titania templates directly 

on the titanium substrate. Until now, there is no report on successful electrodeposition of 

zinc in PAT template. Zinc was chosen as a model metal to be electrodeposited because 

it is an attractive metal due to further possibilities to be oxidized leading to semiconductor

materials such a zinc oxide, zinc sulphide, zinc selenide, etc. Moreover, the similar 

approach can be used for electrodeposition of other metals.  

 

Experimental  

Materials 

Titanium foil of 1 mm thick (99.2%, Alfa Aesar), Nitric acid (68-70%, Alfa Aesar), 

Hydrofluoric acid (48-51%, Alfa Aesar), Ammonium fluoride (Puriss p.a. Sigma-

Aldrich) Ethylene glycol (99.8% anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), Choline chloride (&gt;98%, 

Sigma), Ethanol (absolute anhydrous), Zinc chloride (98+%, Alfa Aesar), Sulphuric acid 

(95-98%, Alfa Aesar) were used as received. Deionized water was used as solvent. 

Procedures 

Coupons of titanium foil (100?5?1 mm) were used as electrode material for 

sample preparation. The coupons were consequently rinsed with acetone, ethanol, and 

distilled water and then they were dried in air. Before anodization, the electrodes were 

chemically polished in a HF:HNO3 mixture (1:3 by volume) to mirror finish and finally were 

rinsed with deionized water. A part of their surface was isolated with chemically resistant 

varnish, giving defined electrode working area of about 1 cm2. 

A Keithley 237 High Voltage Source-Measure Unit was used as a current source 

for the sample anodizing. Ethylene glycol solution with 0.38% (wt.) ammonium fluoride 

and 1.79% (wt.) of water was used as electrolyte [42]. The anodization was performed in 

a potentiostatic mode with an applied voltage of 40 V applied for 1 hour. The counter 

electrode was a platinum foil. Anodization was carried out in two steps with intermediate 

removal of the oxide. The voltage and the electrolyte were the same for both steps and 

duration of the second step was 30 minutes. Removal of the anodic layer after the first 

step was done by ultra sonication in the distilled water during 5 minutes. After anodization 

the electrodes were washed in ethanol and stored in a desiccator for stabilization of the 

titania layer during 24 hours. Mechanism of pore formation allows preparation of highly-

ordered template using the two-step technique [43]. 

The crystallization was performed in a furnace at 450oC for 5 hours with 2oC/min 

heating and cooling ramps.

Preparation of DES electrolytes and the electrodeposition experiments were 

carried out in contact with air. The eutectic system was prepared by mixing choline 

chloride (ChCl) and ethylene glycol (EG) in the molar ratio of 1:2. Anhydrous zinc 

chloride was added to the DES to obtain a 0.5 M solution, which was heated and kept at 

60°C under vacuum for 24 hours. The as-prepared solution (hereafter DES:Zn) was either 

directly used for electrodeposition or was stored in desiccator over P2O5.  

Electrodeposition was performed using a Bio-Logic SAS SP-300 potentiostat. All 

measurements were done in a Faraday cage. A three-electrode cell consisting of a 

platinum wire as a reference electrode, graphite rod as a counter electrode and titanium 

template as a working electrode was used in the experiments. All electrodes after 

deposition were rinsed in distilled water and then were stored in deionized water for 

several hours for physically adsorbed zinc species removal. 

Investigation of the electrode surface morphology and elemental analysis was 

performed using a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an 

energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). A Hitachi 9100 transmission electron microscope 

(TEM) with acceleration voltage 300kV was also used for the analysis. 

The thickness of the layers was estimated by Glow Discharge Optical Emission 

Spectroscopy (GDOES). GDOES depth profile analysis of the coatings was done using a 

HORIBA GD-Profiler 2 with a copper anode of 4 mm in diameter. Argon sputtering of 

the sample surface occurred at a pressure of 650 Pa and power of 30 W. Plasma polishing 

was performed at a pressure of 900 Pa and power of 10 W. About 1 µm of the porous 

template have been removed during plasma polishing. 

Results and discussion  

Typical SEM image of porous anodic titania template after anodisation at the 

conditions indicated in Experimental is presented in Figure VI. 1a. An uniform porous 

layer is self-aligned and well-ordered forming tapered tubes array, wider at the top [44, 

45]. It is also evident that the pores are open on the top. Diameter of the pores and wall 

thickness on the interface after 0.5 hour of anodisation are about 70 and 30 nm 

respectively. The thickness of the porous layer is in the range of 3-3.5 µm as shown in 

Figure VI. 1b. The tubes have a smooth wall morphology typical for the anodic layers 

grown in organic electrolytes [46]. Qualitative GDOES profile of the tubes is presented 

in Figure VI. 1c. There are two regions which belong to porous titania layer and titanium

substrate. After initiating sputtering the titanium and oxygen signals reach a plateau 

which corresponds to the porous titania part. The second region with the maximal 

titanium signal intensity and oxygen background level has been reached at the end of 

sputtering. It corresponds to metallic titanium (substrate) sputtering. The porous film has 

homogeneous composition along the entire length of the tubes.

Figure VI. 2 TEM image of the porous titania layer with the barrier film on the 

bottom which was formed during anodization. It can be seen that the pores are closed by 

titania from the bottom. This compact layer on the pore bottom is named in literature 

barrier layer and its formation is typical for valve metals such as tungsten, aluminium etc 

[47]. In contrast to the majority of other barrier layers titanium dioxide is a 

semiconductor. Comparatively the high conductivity of the titania barrier layer facilitates 

the filling of the porous template. On the other hand, conductivity of the titanium dioxide 

is also a weakness of this template, because the deposition can occur not only on the 

bottom but also on the pore walls and on the electrode surface. The Zn electrodeposition

experiments were performed using the titania templates described above. Electrical 

parameters such as current profile and current distribution affect the quantity of reduced 

zinc at the interface and the uniformity of the deposition process. Optimal results were 

obtained with a pulsed technique at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 (current applied in 

one step). Cathodic and anodic rectangular pulses with a dwell time of 10 µs and 2 µs, 

respectively, and the same absolute value of current density were applied sequentially. 

One cycle was applied every second. Anodic current is needed to remove metallic zinc 

from the electrode interface and opens access to the fresh electrolyte inside the pores. 

Moreover, a positive potential promotes electromigration of negatively charged zinc 

species (ZnCl3
-, Zn2Cl5

- [32, 39]) inside the tubes. Enrichment of the electrolyte in zinc 

species also occurs during intervals between the pulses. The relatively long waiting time 

between the pulses was chosen to allow partial relaxation of the system taking into 

account the length of the pores and high viscosity of the electrolyte.

Electrodeposition in as-prepared PAT 

The inset in Figure VI. 2 presents an electron diffraction image of as-prepared 

titanium dioxide tubes. Diffuse ring without separate reflections suggests that the as-

prepared porous titania layer is amorphous. The conductivity of the amorphous titania is 

lower than conductivity of the crystalline titania. This causes difficulties during 

deposition, but even so in this condition electroreduction occurs.  

In this work the filling of the pores along their length was controlled by GDOES 

technique. The elemental depth profile of the sample obtained after one hour of deposition 

in as-prepared template is presented in Figure VI. 3a. The position of the interface 

between the porous titania and substrate was assessed through Ti profile. After initiating 

sputtering the titanium signal reaches a plateau which corresponds to porous titania part. 

The maximum of the intensity has been reached in the end of sputtering that corresponds 

to metallic titanium (substrate). Zinc signal has very high intensity in the beginning of the 

electrode sputtering, but it is followed by a sharp decrease. It is evident that the zinc layer 

was formed mainly on the top of the pores with only minor penetration into pores. The 

zinc signal goes down to the background at the titania/titanium interface that means 

almost no zinc deposition occurs at the pores bottom.

This result was confirmed by the electron microscopy as well. Figure VI. 4a depicts 

a top view of the porous template after 1 hour of deposition. The upper part of the template 

(around 1 µm here and after) was removed by soft plasma polishing using the GDOES 

equipment. The pores fill-factor (ratio between the numbers of filled pores to the total 

number) at this depth is very low, about 5-10%, and decreases closer to the bottom 

(GDOES results). Additional STEM investigation (Figure VI. 4b) demonstrates that the 

pores, besides being covered by the zinc layer on the top, are also sealed in random places 

as it is schematically demonstrated in Figure VI. 3b. Sealing the pores at the middle blocks 

the access of fresh electrolyte and impairs their filling. Changing the electrodeposition 

parameters does not solve this issue. Therefore, the next step was to modify the template 

in order to improve the electrodeposition inside the pores.

Electrodeposition in annealed PAT 

Increase of the conductivity of the porous titania template achieved via annealing 

in air at 450oC. In these conditions the amorphous titania converts into anatase phase that 

leading to increase of electrical conductivity and, as a result, to more uniform 

electrodeposition along the whole pore surface. Figure VI. 5 depicts TEM micrograph of 

porous titania film after annealing. Electron diffraction pattern (insert in Figure VI. 5) 

demonstrates discrete rings with bright spots and it indicates the anatase crystalline 

structure.

Figure VI. 5 TEM image of annealed titanium dioxide tube, the inset shows selected 

area electron diffraction pattern. 

Electrodeposition of zinc was performed at the same conditions as those applied in 

the as-prepared template. GDOES profile for such sample is presented in Figure VI. 6a. 

Only one titanium profile is shown because of similarity of templates. With the help of 

this profile the transition from anodic titania to titanium has been demonstrated. The depth 

profiles for Zn is also presented for two different electrodeposition times, namely 1 hour 

and 10 minutes. The zinc signal after one hour of deposition in annealed template has a 

peak in the beginning of sputtering, and then it decreases and reaches a plateau followed 

by a second decrease until the background level at the titania/titanium interface. The 

template can be divided in three main zones according to the shape of the zinc signal 

curve. The first zone, in the beginning of sputtering, is the electrode surface and it has a 

high zinc signal because of a deposit formed on the electrode surface. The middle part of 

the template (zone II) shows a plateau which means that pores are successfully and 

homogeneously filled along the length. Then, near the interface between the anodic film 

and substrate (zone III), a small zinc peak appears and it can be explained by the presence 

of empty space next to the bottom as schematically shown in Figure VI. 6b. This 

irregularity forms due to strong diffusion limitation, which originates concentration 

gradient of zinc species and consequently results in different zinc deposition rate along 

the length of pores. The faster deposition rate on the wall surface at the pore opening

leads to the situation that after a certain time the pore fully closes leaving a void with 

entrapped electrolyte closer to the pore bottom. High homogeneity (geometrical shape 

and distribution) of the tubes ensures sealing of the pores mainly at specific depth 

depending on solution concentration, pore length and diameter. A noteworthy detail is 

that regular sealing (at the same distance from the surface) is only possible if growth 

occurs through the whole length of the tube simultaneously, otherwise the pores close 

randomly as it was shown for the as-prepared templates.

GDOES after zinc deposition during 10 min and 1 h (a) and schematic 

representation of the pores filling after 1 h (b) and 10 min (c) of deposition. 

Analysing the depth profiles after shorter deposition times can provide important 

information on the kinetics of pore filling. The profile after 10 minutes was chosen since 

this time ensures a detectable signal, but at the same time the sealing doesn’t occur yet 

(green curve in Figure VI. 6a). The zinc signal reaches a plateau at the beginning of

sputtering and remains at the same level until pore bottoms are reached. It is reasonable 

to suggest that, in this zone, the walls of the pores are homogeneously covered with a thin 

layer of zinc as schematically represented in Figure VI. 6c. The peak on the zinc signal 

appears near the titania/titanium interface presumably because the higher quantity of zinc 

deposited in this plane.  

In support of GDOES results, SEM studies were also performed. Figure VI. 7 

demonstrates templates surfaces after 1 hour and after 10 minutes of deposition (GDOES 

polishing was also carried out). Zinc nanowires inside the template are clearly seen after 

1 hour of deposition (Figure VI. 7a). The fill-factor at this plane is near 90% which is 

much higher than in the as-prepared templates. The SEM image after a short-time 

deposition indicates formation of zinc precipitates on the tubes walls (Figure VI. 7b).  

 

 

Figure VI. 7 SEM (after plasma polishing) micrographs obtained after 

electrodeposition in annealed template for 1 h (a) and 10 min (b). 

Based on both GDOES measurements (1 hour and 10 minutes) and SEM results 

we suggest that zinc deposition occurs simultaneously on the whole titania surface and in 

the beginning of growth zinc forms coaxial tubes (titania outer layer and zinc inner). 

Longer deposition leads to sealing the tubes and filling of the template from these seals 

until interface (Figure VI. 6b). 

Electrodeposition in PAT after bottom crystallization. 

As it was shown above, electrodeposition in the as-prepared and in the annealed 

templates occurs on the whole tube length. Based on this result one can assume that 

bottom-up filling of the tubes requires higher conductivity of the bottom of the pores 

compared to the walls. One of the ways to create different conductivity is selective

crystallisation. Fortunately, during the pores preparation process, current passes mostly 

through the bottom of the tubes [45]. It makes possible a selective electrochemical 

modification of pore bottom without strong effect on the walls.  

Influence of the anodisation parameters on crystallinity of the titania was 

demonstrated by Shibata, Zhu [41] and Xing et al. [48]. The authors showed that dense 

anodic titania films prepared at higher anodisation voltage [41] and at longer anodisation 

time [48] had better crystallinity. Additionally, it was shown in our recent paper [40] that 

zinc electrodeposition rate raises with increasing the titania barrier layer thickness. At the 

same time, the thickness of the anodic barrier layer depends on the oxidation voltage and 

becomes bigger at higher potential. Therefore, an additional anodisation step was applied 

to the as-prepared template. The treatment of the prepared template was done in a 1M 

sulphuric acid in two steps. The solution and procedure of anodisation were the same as 

those used in our previous work where the compact anodic titania films were studied [40]. 

The first step was performed in galvanostatic mode at 10 mA/cm2. The second step took 

place in potentiostatic mode at 80 V during 2.5 hours. Galvanostatic mode was changed 

to potentiostatic one when the potential reached 80 V. The anodisation voltage at this 

process is two times higher than template formation voltage (40 V) that, together with 

long oxidation time, results in thicker and better crystallized barrier layer in comparison 

with that in the as-prepared template. 

Effect of such an additional anodisation on the template structure was analysed by 

TEM. Regular porous structure with relatively thick barrier layer on the bottom 

(compared to the as-prepared template, Figure VI. 2) is seen in Figure VI. 8a. Moreover, 

the selected area electron diffraction shows significant difference in crystallinity of the 

anodic titania at walls and barrier parts. The diffraction pattern of walls does not represent 

separate reflections indicating that the material is amorphous (Figure VI. 8b). 

Nevertheless, at the diffraction pattern from the barrier layer shows rings, which confirm 

the polycrystalline structure of this area (Figure VI. 8c). The reflections are not sharp due 

to very small size of the crystallites.

Figure VI. 8 TEM image of titanium dioxide tube after bottom crystallization (a), 

selected area electron diffraction pattern of the walls (b) and bottom part (c). 

Zinc deposition in the template after crystallisation of the barrier layer was 

performed at the same condition as in two cases described above. The GDOES results 

obtained on this specimen are presented in Figure VI. 9. Zinc signal after 1 hour of 

deposition has a high intensity in the beginning of sputtering, afterward the intensity 

slowly decreases until the template bottom is reached. The amount of zinc is 

comparatively high along the whole length of titania pores, and in this way the filling of 

the pores had to start from the bottom. A gradual decrease of the zinc signal happens 

because the template is imperfect. Although reduction occurs mainly on the bottom part 

there is also some deposition simultaneously on the walls (although in a far less degree 

than in the case of the as-prepared template).

Figure VI. 9 Qualitative depth profile of a porous titanium oxide measured by 

GDOES after zinc deposition during 10 min and 1 h (a) and schematic 

representation of the pores filling after 1 h (b) and 10 min (c) of deposition. 

An additional proof of the suggested mechanism of pore filling can be obtained 

after analysis of the electrode prepared after 10 minutes of deposition (Figure VI. 9a, 

green line). Zinc signal has a peak close to the bottom and almost background signal in 

the beginning of sputtering. This difference of the zinc signal is explained by a small 

amount of zinc which was deposited at different parts of the tubes. Filling of the tubes 

after 1 hour and after 10 minutes of deposition are presented schematically in Figure VI. 

9b and c correspondingly.  

It is evident from SEM image and agrees with GDOES results that most of the 

pores are filled by secondary material (Figure VI. 10a). Besides, the fill-factor is about 

90% that is much higher than that in the case of the as-prepared template. The STEM 

image presented in Figure VI. 10b demonstrates homogeneous pores filling. EDX 

spectrum shows four elements (Figure VI. 10c): titanium, oxygen, zinc and copper

indicating that porous anodic titania (Ti, O) was successfully filled by zinc as a secondary 

material. The copper signal comes from a TEM grid.

Conclusions 

Electrodeposition of zinc from a 0.5M ZnCl2 solution in choline chloride/ethylene 

glycol eutectic solvent in porous anodic titania templates was successfully performed 

using pulse technique. It was demonstrated that electrodeposition in the as-prepared 

template occurs in random places without regular pore filling. Annealing of the template 

at 450oC converts amorphous titania of the as-prepared template to anatase. It improves 

conductivity of the template along the full length of the pores and allows regular 

deposition over the whole pore surface. Successful bottom up filling was performed in 

the template with additional electrocrystallization of the barrier layer.

Electrosynthesis of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from DES using porous anodic templates 

149 

 

The aim of this work was the electrodeposition of 1-D metallic nanoparticles from 

deep eutectic solvent using porous anodic templates. This subject has been fully 

investigated using a step-by-step approach for two most common metallic substrates. The 

studies were started from the modelling of reduction processes on the dense barrier layer, 

which mimics the pore bottom and then, the obtained results were applied to the porous 

templates. One more important feature, namely the adsorbed layer of DES on the anodic 

oxide/DES interface which formed in the considered systems was thoroughly studied.  

Templates preparation and characterization 

There were two different metal substrates used for preparation of dense and porous 

anodic layers in the work. Series of the samples with different thickness of the oxide films 

on both titanium and aluminium substrates were successfully prepared in solutions of 

sulfuric acid and ammonium pentaborate, correspondingly. The thickness of the barrier 

films was estimated using the complementary techniques such as GDOES, EIS and 

ellipsometry.  

Porous anodic templates on aluminium and titanium were formed in an oxalic acid 

aqueous solution and in fluoride containing ethylene glycol based electrolyte, 

correspondingly. Both types of the prepared templates were well-ordered and had similar 

morphology: the pore diameter of 60-70 nm and the wall thickness of 20-30 nm.  

Studies of the dense barrier layer influence 

The electrodeposition studies were initially performed on flat electrodes covered 

by dense anodic films. These studies showed a strong impact of structure and thickness 

of the barrier layer on the electrodeposition process, but the influence is very different in 

aluminium oxide and in titanium oxide. As alumina film is an insulator, it was found that 

the zinc electroreduction rate is lower when the barrier film is thicker. Moreover, the 

formation of a dense organic layer by specific adsorption of the electrolyte components, 

such as choline cation and ethylene glycol on the alumina surface was revealed. The 

organic layer was shown to have an adverse impact due to additional limitation on 

migration of zinc species to the electrode surface. The way to avoid or at least to minimize 

the effect of the organic layer formation was suggested. It was shown that relatively small 

AC perturbation overlapped on the potential results in destabilization of the layer and

enhances the zinc reduction. Furthermore, the temperature increase causes growing of the 

kinetics energy that hinders the layer stabilization.  

The dense anodic titania was revealed to show the opposite thickness related 

behaviour in comparison to that of alumina. Reduction of zinc species occurs much faster 

on thicker anodic films than on thinner ones. It was explained by crystallization of the 

titania layer at higher potentials that leads to higher conductivity of the layer and higher 

rate of zinc reduction. Moreover, neither adsorption of the organic components on the 

electrode surface nor formation of a dense organic layer have been detected in contrast to 

alumina. It suggests again that each type of templates should be studied separately in spite 

of their apparent similarity. Additionally, based on the chronoamperometric 

measurements confirmed by SEM and AFM observations, the nucleation mechanism has 

been determined for different film thicknesses and overvoltages.  

Porous anodic templates filling 

The porous anodic alumina has been successfully used as the template for 

electrodeposition of zinc nanowires. The main advantage of this method is the use of 

porous films directly on the substrate without any intermediate stages. The electrofilling 

of this type of templates by electrodeposition from DES was reported for the first time. A 

two-step process was developed and used for the electrosynthesis. The first step is AC 

pre-nucleation of zinc on the pore bottom. The second step is the galvanostatic pores 

filling. The optimal conditions, including current density, frequency, relaxation time have 

been found. As a result, highly uniform, well-ordered zinc nanorods have been obtained. 

The porous anodic titania has been chosen as the another template for the zinc 

nanorods formation due to conductive behavior of the oxide. Electrodeposition of zinc 

was performed in the titania-based templates modified in three different ways. The first 

one was used as-prepared. It is found that electrodeposition occurs randomly along the 

full length of the pores that leads to sealing of the pores and thus to a non-uniform filling. 

Amorphous titania in the second template was converted to the anatase phase by 

annealing. It improved conductivity of the template and allowed regular zinc 

electroreduction over the whole pore surface. This modification is suitable for production 

of coaxial structures. The last modification, selective bottom crystallization, allowed a 

bottom up filling of the pores and formation of the zinc nanorods. The electrochemical

parameters, such as pulse length, current density, relaxation time, and their influence on 

the fill-factor have been also studied. 

My contribution to the work presented (published papers) 

The main part of the work and data reported in chapters III-VI were obtained and 

analysed by myself. The papers were also written by myself although the final corrections 

were performed together with my supervisors. Since almost all the works required 

additional characterization techniques such as ellipsometry, AFM, XRD etc., other 

researchers from our group and other groups assisted me with that. In general, my work 

was more focused on the electrochemical experiments: templates preparation, zinc 

electrodeposition, pores filling etc.  

More specifically: 

Chapter III: I have prepared all templates, suggested two-step technique for 

deposition and performed pores electrofilling. The characterizations were mostly 

performed by myself except some SEM observations. 

Chapter IV: The template synthesis, zinc electrodeposition and characterization 

were fully performed by myself, but some advices concerning the electrochemical 

measurements were received from my colleagues. 

Chapter V: The core work such as template synthesis, zinc electrodeposition and 

electrochemical studies has been done by myself. I also performed nearly all 

characterization of the samples, except for the ellipsometry and AFM.  

Chapter VI: I have performed all the work.

Future activities 

I would like to continue the detailed research of the current subject in order to 

enhance the cross disciplinary knowledge about two new and forward-looking areas, 

namely, exploration of porous anodic films and ionic liquids. 

The future activities are to be divided in two groups. The first one is 

electrodeposition of different secondary materials for specific applications. For instance, 

the elecrodeposition methods developed for zinc can be can be applied to magnetic, 

semiconducting materials or to materials with high catalytic activity. I have already 

started investigation on conversion of zinc nanorods to zinc oxide and zinc sulphide. 

The second group of my research activities I would like to link with anodic 

processes in DES. Although this area is rarely studied, it has a great potential in 

electropolishing and anodization of metals, doping of the anodic films by different species 

with the view to improve corrosion protection, conductivity, stability etc. Both areas are 

interesting and attractive for me.
