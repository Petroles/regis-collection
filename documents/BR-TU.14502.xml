RESUMO 

 

 

Nos entornos da cidade de Guarapuava (Paraná, Brasil) afloram rochas vulcânicas ácidas do tipo 

Chapecó associadas ao magmatismo Eocretáceo da Formação Serra Geral. Tais rochas formam 

extensos corpos tabulares com dezenas de metros de espessura, sobrepondo-se aos derrames basálticos 

correlatos. Classificam-se como traquidacitos pobres em sílica (63-66% SiO2). A textura porfirítica 

caracteriza-se por 10 - 20% de macrocristais de plagioclásio, piroxênio (augita, principalmente) e 

óxidos de Fe-Ti, em ordem decrescente de abundância; imersos em uma matriz microgranular a 

afanítica. Em escala de afloramento, os traquidacitos possuem um padrão zebrado, alternando bandas 

sinuosas claras e escuras dispostas de maneira sub-horizontal. Vesículas e amídalas, apesar de pouco 

abundantes, são recorrentes. Macrocristais de plagioclásio foram amplamente investigados do ponto 

de vista petrográfico e isotópico. Tais cristais caracterizam-se por hábitos tabulares euedrais atingindo 

comprimentos de até 2 cm. Menos comuns, mas presentes, são agregados deste mineral com piroxênio 

e óxidos de Fe-Ti, definindo textura glomeroporfirítica. Neste caso, o plagioclásio ocorre em menores 

tamanhos, com formas irregulares e contatos interdigitados. Independente da associação petrográfica, 

o plagioclásio é predominantemente homogêneo, com ausência de zoneamentos. Imagens de 

catodoluminescência e microscopia eletrônica de varredura em matriz de traquidacito revelaram que 

esta é composta por dois domínios petrograficamente distintos; um contínuo e maciço caracterizado 

por um fino intercrescimento de sanidina e quartzo, e outro irregular e esburacado dominado apenas 

por sanidina. As bandas escuras observadas nos respectivos afloramentos são enriquecidas no 

primeiro, enquanto as bandas claras são relativamente empobrecidas neste e dominadas pelo segundo 

tipo. Todas amostras apresentaram curvas crystal size distribution (CSD) côncavas para cima, 

possibilitando sua subdivisão em fenocristais (&gt; 3mm) e microfenocristais (&amp;lt;3mm). Tal divisão 

guarda relação com o período de residência e ambiente de cristalização, estimados da ordem de 40 

anos em câmara magmática profunda (taxa de crescimento de 10
-9

 mm.s
-1

), e 2 anos durante ascensão 

e erupção (taxa de crescimento de 10
-8

 mm.s
-1

), respectivamente. Assinaturas de isótopos de Sr em 

plagioclásio revelam sutis flutuações intra e intercristalinas das razões de 
87

Sr/
86

Sr, com média de 

0.70566 ± 0.00004 (2?). Tais razões de 
87

Sr/
86

Sr em plagioclásio sobrepõem-se às de rocha total, 

condizente com uma cristalização em equilíbrio e sua classificação como fenocristais sensu stricto. As 

altas temperaturas dos magmas traquidacíticos (~1000°C) associadas aos cristais sinuosos de 

plagioclásio nos agregados e às curvas CSD côncavas para cima indicam relevante ação de coarsening 

durante estágio de câmara magmática. A limitada variação de isótopos de Sr obtida em plagioclásio 

sugere sua cristalização em uma câmara magmática com contínua injeção de magmas cogenéticos 

capazes de interagir e homogeneizar todo o ambiente. Tais eventos de injeção magmática causaram 



 

II 
 

rompimento e remobilização de partes das paredes da câmara, redistribuindo os fragmentos 

cumuláticos, posteriormente preservados como os agregados (clusters). Tal magma ascendeu pela 

crosta com 10-15% de cristalinidade. As baixíssimas quantidades de água dissolvidas (&lt;1.5% H2O) 

foram exsolvidas apenas em profundidades muito rasas até a superfície. Tal exsolução magmática 

ocorreu de maneira heterogênea, gerando zonas discretas com reologias e propriedades diferentes 

numa escala centimétrica. Fraturas sub-horizontais finamente espaçadas condicionadas pela direção do 

fluxo e pelo padrão de resfriamento possibilitaram o escape de tais fluidos, que teriam interagido 

seletivamente com as porções imediatamente próximas, gerando as diferentes cores observadas nos 

afloramentos bandados. Relações estratigráficas, ausência de texturas/estruturas piroclásticas, 

imponente presença de cristais euedrais de plagioclásio e homogeneidade isotópica associadas às 

baixas concentrações de água e altas temperaturas magmáticas refutam uma origem piroclástica para 

tais depósitos. Sugere-se um modelo eruptivo predominantemente efusivo na forma de extensos 

derrames de lavas ácidas a partir de condutos na região de Guarapuava.

ABSTRACT 

 

 

Acid volcanic rocks of Chapecó affinity crops out on the surroundings of Guarapuava city (Paraná, 

Brazil) associated with the Eocretaceous magmatism of the Serra Geral Formation. Such rocks 

constitute extensive tabular deposits up to tens of meters thick, resting directly above the correlate 

basaltic flows. They classify as low-silica trachydacites (63-66% SiO2). Their porphyritic texture is 

characterized by 10-20% of macrocrysts of plagioclase, pyroxene (augite, chiefly) and Fe-Ti oxides, in 

decreasing order of abundance; these are set in a microgranular fine to aphanytic groundmass. 

Trachydacite outcrops show a zebra-like pattern characterized by a rhythmic alternation of sub-

horizontal light and dark bands in a sub-horizontal fashion. Vesicles and amygdales, although rare, are 

ubiquitous in these outcrops. Plagioclase macrocrysts were thoroughly investigated via petrography 

and isotopy. Crystals typically exhibit tabular euhedral habits up to 2 cm long. Less frequent, but 

ubiquitous, are clusters composed of plagioclase + pyroxene ± Fe-Ti oxides, that define a 

glomeroporphyritic texture. In this case, plagioclase is smaller and show irregular, interfingered 

contacts. Regardless of the petrographic association, the plagioclase is predominantly unzoned. 

Cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy reveal the trachydacite groundmass to be 

composed of two petrographically distinct domains; one massive and continuous composed of a fine 

intergrowth of sanidine and quartz, and another one irregular and porous dominated only by sanidine. 

The dark bands observed on the respective outcrops are enriched in the former, whereas the light 

bands are relatively depleted in this and dominated by the latter type.  All samples show concave-up 

crystal size distribution (CSD) curves, allowing sub-division in two groups: phenocrysts (&gt; 3mm) and 

microphenocrysts (&amp;lt;3mm). Such division bears relation with residence times and crystallization 

environment, estimated about 40 years in a deep-seated magmatic chamber (growth rate of 10
-9

 mm.s
-

1
) and 2 years during ascent and eruption (growth rate of 10

-8
 mm.s

-1
), respectively. Plagioclase Sr 

isotopes signatures reveal subtle intra and intercrystalline fluctuations in 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios with a mean 

value of 0.70566 ± 0.00004 (2?). These signatures overlap with the whole-rock Sr isotopes, implying 

equilibrium crystallization and their classification as phenocrysts sensu stricto.  The high magmatic 

temperatures of trachydacite magmas (~1000°C) associated with the irregular plagioclase crystals in 

the clusters and the concave-up CSD curves indicate the importance of coarsening during the 

magmatic chamber stage. The restricted variation of Sr isotopes obtained in plagioclase suggest their 

crystallization in a magmatic chamber protractedly supplied by cogenetic magmas capable to interact 

and homogenize the entire environment. These injection events promoted disruption and 

remobilization of parts of the chamber walls, redistributing the observed cumulate fragments that form 

the glomerocrysts. The magmas ascended through the crust bearing 10-15% crystallinity. The very 



 

IV 
 

low water contents dissolved (&amp;lt;1.5% H2O) were exsolved in very shallow depths up to the surface. 

Such exsolution was heterogeneous through the magma, generating discrete zones with different 

rheology and properties up to the centimeter scale. Finely spaced sub-horizontal fractures enabled the 

exsolved fluids to escape and these would have interacted selectively with the immediately adjacent 

portions, generating the different colors observed on the banded outcrops. Stratigraphic relationships 

together with the lack of pyroclastic textures/structures, ubiquitous presence of euhedral plagioclase 

crystals and isotopic homogeneity associated with the low water contents and high magmatic 

temperatures refutes a pyroclastic origin for such deposits. Otherwise, it is suggested a mainly effusive 

eruption style as vast acid lava flows fed by discrete conduits on the neighborhoods of Guarapuava.

CONTINENTAL FLOOD BASALTS: A BRIEF REVIEW AND INSIGHTS INTO THE 

PARANÁ-ETENDEKA MAGMATIC PROVINCE 

Since the seminal papers of Wilson (1963, 1965) about ocean island chains and plate 

movements, a great effort has been demanded on hot-spots. Morgan (1972) suggested that hot-spots 

are surface expressions of deep mantle plumes; hot upwelling solid material ascending through the 

mantle that remain relatively stationary whilst tectonic plates ride over and are stippled by volcanic 

islands and forming a track along its path, the Hawaiian islands the most conspicuous example. The 

same author warned about the apparent link between giant basaltic provinces on continents with the 

opening of ocean basins. Later, White &amp;amp; Mckenzie (1989) proposed that the volcanism on rift zones is 

triggered by a combination of temperature rise and decompression in the upper mantle induced by 

plumes. This rift-related volcanism is potentially preserved along passive margins following 

continental breakup and ocean opening. In the same year, Richards et al. (1989) assigned the earliest 

basaltic volcanism over continental hot-spots to the melting of a plume “head” which is eventually 

followed by the opening of an ocean basin, with a continuing magmatism tracking linear and 

symmetric submarine chains on both sides of the new tectonic plates by the melting of a plume “tail”. 

Despite the lack of compulsory of continental breakup, it normally follows basaltic floods being a 

natural consequence of the plume influence. This seeming connection between plumes, volcanism and 

continental splitting was further endorsed (e.g. Hill; 1991; White &amp;amp; Mckenzie, 1995; Courtillot et al., 

1999). Noting the worldwide occurrence of huge basaltic provinces of different ages, Coffin &amp;amp; 

Eldholm (1992, 1993,1994) proposed the collective term Large Igneous Provinces (LIP) to describe 

very intense and short-lived volcanic events not related to subduction zones. A more strict definition 

of LIP was suggested by Bryan &amp;amp; Ernst (2008) as giant intraplate magma volumes (&gt;0.1 MKm
3
), 

mostly basaltic, erupted in geological short time intervals &amp;lt;50 m.y., usually much less. Continental 

Flood Basalts (CFB) and Ocean Plateaus are the equivalents of LIPs on continental and oceanic crust, 

respectively.  

There are many well-preserved CFBs around the world, chiefly the Mesozoic ones. The breaking of 

Gondwana and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous is linked with one of the 

largest CFBs preserved in the world, widespread on South America and, to a lesser extent, on the 

African counterpart, in Namibia (Bryan et al. 2010). Once continuous, this CFB is known as the 

Paraná-Etendeka Magmatic Province (PEMP) (Peate, 1997). Both sides of the PEMP seem to have a 

bathymetric continuity into the ocean by linear and symmetric submarine chains in latitudes between 

25° and 35°S, the Walvis Ridge on the African Plate and the Rio Grande Rise on the South American 

Plate; which come together on the active volcanic island of Tristan da Cunha, located close to the 

South Atlantic mid-ocean ridge. The clear progressive aging of the respective chains away from 

Tristan da Cunha island (e.g. O’Connor et al., 2012;  O’Connor &amp;amp; Jokat, 2015; Rohde et al., 2013), 



 

2 
 

meeting the ages of the continental PEMP (e.g. Renne et al., 1992, 1996; Thiede &amp;amp; Vasconcelos, 

2010), enables us to trace back the plates configurations and infer similarities in the magmatic history 

for both on- and off-land volcanism. A reasonable assumption is the presence of a major mantle plume 

beneath the Tristan da Cunha Island responsible for the onset of the PEMP magmatism on continents 

and followed by the ocean floors (O’Connor &amp;amp; Duncan, 1990; Hawkesworth et al., 1992). Recent 

upper mantle tomography confirms the existence of a plume beneath Tristan da Cunha Island, but the 

shallow depths of the low velocity zone, with a main conduit extending about 250 Km and branching 

downwards, puts doubt on the deep-seated origin of the plume, otherwise indicating that it is dying out 

(Schlomer et al., 2017). 

In this context, it is discussed the genesis and relative contributions of potential distinct sources to 

the PEMP. Gibson (1995; 1999; 2005) and Ewart et al. (1998) suggested that the PEMP basalts reflect 

a main deep asthenospheric source, the Tristan da Cunha plume in the case. However, Hawkesworth et 

al. (1988), Peate et al. (1999), Marques (1999) proposes the PEMP basalts are products of 

heterogeneous melts with a substantial sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) contribution. 

Combining geoid and seismic tomography data, Ernesto et al. (2002) advocated for a non-plume 

model related to the PEMP magmatism. Rocha-Júnior et al. (2012) showed that the exclusive melting 

of either asthenosphere or SCLM cannot satisfactorily explain the overall geochemical and isotopic 

features of the PEMP. Using Re-Os isotopy combined with highly siderophile elements, the latter 

authors attributed the PEMP generation to the partial melting of a metassomatized asthenosphere 

followed by variable mixing with enriched mantle portions, probably in the SCLM. In this model, the 

regionally distinct basalts in the PEMP are products of different amounts of mixing with these 

enriched mantle components. The same authors points to notable isotopic differences between the 

PEMP basalts and ocean islands along the Tristan da Cunha track, indicating a minor role of the 

plume. Recent geophysical investigation points to a high-density lithosphere underlying the PMP, 

attributed to a highly altered and fertile lithosphere (Chaves et al., 2016).

METHODOLOGY 

1 Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) 

The CSD theory was initially developed for chemical engineering purposes (Randolph &amp;amp; 

Larson, 1971) and later adapted for igneous petrology (Marsh,1988). The CSD enables direct 

assessment of residence timescales of crystallization without the necessity of further sophisticated 

thermodynamic approaches.  

The CSD theory is based on a crystal population balance that relates the change in the number of 

crystals whilst these nucleate and grow in a liquid environment (Marsh, 1988). This equation reports 

the change of the number and size of crystals as a function of their respective magmatic residence 

times and inflow and outflow of the size intervals. Such balance requires a parameter that determines 

the number of crystals within a specific size range in a particular volume of rock/magma, called 

population density (n; mm
-4

)   

According to Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh (1988), in summary, the balance equation of a population of 

growing crystals in a steady-state system within a specific size range (dL) can be described as: 

(1) d(Gn)/dL = -n/  

 

where G is the linear growth rate of the crystal (mm.s
-1

) and  is the residence time (s). Assuming G 

as constant, equation (1) can be integrated to:  

 

(2) n = n
0
 exp (-L/G ) 

(3) ln (n) = ln (n
0
) - (1/G ) L  

In which n
0
 is a constant that represents the population density at the moment that crystals size 

approach zero (L?0), or the nucleation density. A diagram relating ln(n) and L of a system following 

such requirements is shown in Figure 1a.

Figure 1. A) Representation of a typical CSD graph. B) Examples of different CSD curves and their respective 

interpretations. Line a (red): Straight CSD formed by purely kinetic reasons in a steady-state crystallizing igneous system. 

Line b: Concave-up CSD along the smaller crystal sizes caused by a rapid cooling in the system. Line c: Concave-up CSD 

along the larger crystal sizes promoted by crystal accumulation. Line d: Concave-down CSD along the smaller crystal sizes 

induced by crystal removal. C) Keeping the residence time constant the CSDs are displaced parallel by changing their 

nucleation density. D) Otherwise, keeping the nucleation density constant, the CSD slopes change according to different 

residence times (the quicker the crystallization interval, the steeper the CSD). Image withdrawn from Higgins (2006). 

From Figure 1a we conclude that (1) The slope of the CSD curve is inversely proportional to G  

(2) The intersection of the CSD with the y axis is equivalent to the nucleation density, n
0
 (L?0).  

However, natural CSDs are rather curved than straight (Fig. 1b). Higgins (2006) attributed this to 

additional mechanical processes (ex: crystal removal and accumulation, compaction, magma mixing, 

mingling, and others) and kinetic effects (ex: rapid undercooling) operating during and even post-

crystallization (ex: coarsening). The participation of these mechanisms that are able to deviate the 

CSD from the predicted straight line are likely to be recorded by the different shapes of the CSD 

curves (Fig. 1b). The evaluation of the CSD from a set of samples reveals trends on the nucleation 

density (Fig. 1c) and residence time (Fig. 1d) and, consequently, on the crystallization pathways.  

CSD curves requires the tridimensional knowledge of the crystals sizes. However, this is not an 

easy task due to the difficulty in isolating the individual crystals from their hosting rocks. This 



7 
 

problem can be circumvented by an indirect approach in which intersection planes (petrographic thin 

sections, rocks slabs, outcrop surfaces) are investigated to obtain morphological parameters of the 

crystals (length, area, shape, orientation; Figure 2a). These two-dimensional data are converted to 

three dimensions via stereology corrections (e.g. Sahagian &amp;amp; Proussevitch, 1998). Other methods also 

permit assessment of crystal parameters (serial sectioning and tomography, for example), however, 

stereology is easier, faster, and cheaper than these ones and was preferred for this study.    

 

Figure 2. A) Parallelepiped representing a natural crystal. Ideally, the volume of the parallelepiped encloses the crystal. The 

intersection   of this shape with a random plane gives an intersection area (grey area). B) CSD graph displaying the method 

developed by Higgins (2000) in which the crystals are distributed along specific size ranges (bins) with different widths. The 

bins are progressively wider in order to compensate the underrepresentation of the larger crystals in bi-dimensional sections. 

Thus, the CSD graph is a histogram in which the center of the bins are connected by a simple line. Both images were 

withdrawn from Higgins (2000).     

Higgins (2000) developed an algorithm, which performs crystal stereology in natural rocks, 

CSDCorrections Program. The analyzed crystals are approximated to rectangular parallelepipeds with 

three perpendicular axis, long : intermediate : short (Fig. 2a). This ratio must be defined by empirical 

observations in the intersection planes and informed to the program for stereological conversion. 

Crystals are then divided in different size ranges that are progressively wider in order to compensate 

the underrepresentation of larger crystals in the intersection planes (Fig. 2b). The horizontal axis of the 

CSD graph, size (mm), refers to the long axis of the bestfit ellipses enclosing the parallelepipeds.    

 

2 Cathodoluminescence 

The interaction of a solid phase with a focused beam of electrons promotes ionization of the 

former and produces a set of products (Pagel et al., 2000): 1) Characteristic X-ray emission from the 

inner layers of the atoms 2) A continuous radiation 3) High and low energy electron scattering 4) 

Electrons ejected from the outer layers of the atoms (Auger electrons) and 5) Cathodoluminescence 

(CL). The CL is characterized by photons with large wavelengths, from the ultraviolet to the visible 



 

8 
 

spectra and infrared. The latter is activated by a series of trace elements (rare earth elements REE, 

actinides and transition elements, chiefly) present in specific crystal sites. The excited valence 

electrons generates a photon with specific wavelength when these return to their original positions. 

Such phenomenon is observed as different CL colors. These colors are a function of the respective 

activator element, valence state, and crystal site among others.       

In this study, polished thin sections of selected samples were investigated under cold CL. In this 

method, electrons are produced by applying an electrical charge between two electrodes under low gas 

pressure (Pagel et al., 2000). The main advantages of the cold CL are the possibility coupling it to an 

optical microscope and the relatively simple vacuum system, which combined permits the observation 

of large fields without need of carbon coating. However, the wide electron beam implies an inferior 

spatial resolution relatively to the hot CL. The cold CL images in this study were obtained at the 

Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (Canada) under analytical conditions of 10 Kv and electrical 

current of 185 µÅ.   

 

3 Powder X-ray Diffraction   

The X-ray diffraction is a physical phenomenon embracing a series of departures of wave 

paths after hitting the crystalline structure of solid phases in mono or polycrystalline aggregates. This 

is possible due to the size equivalency between the X-rays wavelength (0.1 to 100 Å) and the spacing 

between interatomic planes.  

The crystalline structure of any solid (sensu stricto) consists of a regular array of atoms that repeat 

themselves three dimensionally. This array results in atomic planes with different orientations, 

spacing, and densities (Figure 3a). The atoms promote X-rays scattering, which, in special conditions, 

will interact constructively and produce a peak of intensity in an X-ray diffraction graph.    

 

Figure 3. A) Bi-dimensional example of a set of atomic planes (thin straight lines) spaced by d. The atoms (black balls) 

diffract the incident X-rays according the Bragg’s law. B) Sketch representing how a typical diffractometer operates.  

 



9 
 

The geometric relationships between the X-rays incident angle and the spacing of the atomic planes 

are described by the Bragg’s law: 

(4) n? = 2 d sen? 

in which n is an integer number, ? is the X-ray wavelength, d is the spacing between the atomic planes 

and ? is the incident angle (Figure 3a). The constructive diffraction pattern will only occur in 

particular incident angles. In polycrystalline aggregates, like rock powder, the sample must be 

prepared in a way to ensure the random disposition of their particles. Following this premise, for each 

set of atomic planes, a small but important number of particles will be oriented in an optimal angle 

favorable to diffract the X-rays and promote a peak intensity. Multiple peaks from the same phase and 

other ones will be displayed in the same graph and can be overlapped depending on the phases present. 

The identification of each phase is performed by direct comparison with an X-ray diffraction database 

(e.g. CIF; Crystallographic Information File) and by considering the geological context and rock 

composition.  

In most cases, the X-rays source is a tube containing a cathode and an anode under vacuum. The 

electrons emitted by the cathode are accelerated under 30-60 Kv and collide with the anode, producing 

the X-rays. These leave the tube by a small beryl window. As they hit the sample, the diffracted rays 

produced by this interaction are captured in the opposite symmetrical detector. This set moves slowly 

by increasing gradually the incident and diffracted angles (Figure 3b). The rock powders used in the 

X-ray diffraction analyzes in this study were obtained following the same procedure described in item 

1. 

4 Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 

Following Sylvester (2008), the LA-ICP-MS is used for in-situ elemental and/or isotopic 

analyzes of minerals and matrices (glass, fine grained groundmass).  The technique does not requires 

powdering on the sample, and permits textural control of the analyzed spots by using standard 

polished section. The LA-ICP-MS is made of three distinct portions represented in the acronym. The 

first, laser ablation (LA), performs the microsampling of the polished section by a laser beam up to a 

few hundreds µm in diameter. Once the laser beam hits the sample, the latter is pulverized and 

transformed into an aerosol composed of very fine particles. This aerosol is transported through a gas, 

commonly Ar, up to the next stage, the ion coupled plasma (ICP), where the aerosol interacts with an 

extremely hot plasma made by a mixture of Ar and He. The sample is vaporized and converted to 

ionized atoms. These ions are accelerated to the last part of the equipment, the mass spectrometer 

(MS) that operates under vacuum conditions. Once in the MS, a magnetic field applied to the ions 

forces them to follow different curved pathways depending on the mass to charge ratio of the deflected 

ions. A range of voltages can be applied in order to record from the lightest (e.g. Li
+
) to the heaviest 



 

10 
 

(e.g. U
+
) ions. The   frequency of the ionic impacts (counts per second, cps) on the detectors are 

translated in electric pulses or potential (voltage) which are recorded in a computer. The absolute 

contents of the respective elements are obtained by comparing the acquired signals to the ones of an 

internal standard determined independently. The detector possesses many possible configurations used 

for different applications. The specific configuration used in this work is described next. 

4.1 Multi-Collector 

The multi-collector has a configuration that allows simultaneous measurements of several 

masses. The employed system has 12 Faraday cups and 5 ion counters that can be moved to detect 

specific isotopes of interest. This was the configuration used to measure the Sr isotopic ratios in the 

plagioclase crystals. Such analyzes were performed in two stages. One at the Radiogenic Isotope 

Facility (RIF, University of Alberta, Canada) in 2009 (sample FP-15-15), and another at the MidWest 

Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC) of the University of Notre Dame 

in 2017 (samples PA-16-01 and -21). The analyzes at RIF were conducted using a NuPlasma MC-ICP-

MS coupled with a Laser Ablation system UP213 under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter 

of 160 µm and 10 Hz frequency and output energy of approximately 11 J/cm
3
. Otherwise, the analyzes 

at MITERAC were conducted with a NuPlasma II MC-ICP-MS coupled with an Excimer NWR-193 

nm LA system, under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter of 150 µm and 10 Hz frequency 

and output energy of approximately 14 J/cm
3
.    

5 Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) 

In this method, the interaction of a geological material with a focused electron beam produces 

signals that translate into composition, morphology, and topography of the target. The SEM combines 

such phenomenon with the possibility of investigation under high magnification, which allows 

identification and imaging of nanometric phases and textures. In this study, SEM analyzes were 

performed at the Laboratório de Caracterização Tecnológica (LCT - EPUSP) of the Escola Politécnica 

of the Universidade de São Paulo, using a Quanta 600 FEG (FEI) coupled with an energy dispersive 

spectrometer (EDS; Quantax, Bruker). Phase association was characterized from backscattered 

images, EDS and digital mapping by X-rays for major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Ca, Ti, P). The 

SEM analyzes were conducted in order to investigate the banded structure of the studied acid rocks.

1  INTRODUCTION 

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) are giant magma volumes (&gt;0.1 MKm
3
) erupted in 

continental environments in geologically short time intervals &amp;lt;50 m.y., usually much less (Bryan &amp;amp; 

Ernst, 2008). Although mainly composed by basalts, CFBs commonly have minor contributions of 

intermediate and acid rocks.  

Brazil hosts one of the world’s most expressive continental flood basalts (CFB) associated to the 

breakup of the Gondwana Supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Paraná-Etendeka 

Magmatic Province (PEMP) holds up to 5 x 10
5
 km

3 
of tholeiitic basalts exposed over an area about 1 

million km
2
  (Frank et al., 2009). This huge volume of lava is believed to have outpoured to surface in 

less than 4 M.y. (Renne et al., 1992, 1996, Pinto et al., 2011; Janasi et al., 2011; Thiede and 

Vasconcelos, 2010; Baksi, 2017), which in geological terms is almost instantaneous. 

Knowledge about the province has increased in the last years thanks to systematic studies on the 

volcanic stratigraphy and eruptive style (Nardy et al., 2002, 2008; Polo et al., 2017;  Rossetti et al., 

2017).  However, several key questions remain unanswered, especially those concerning the time it 

took for each individual flow to extrude to the surface, the characteristics of the hidden reservoir that 

fed the volcanic system, and the physical properties and the volatile budget of the magmas that form 

the PEMP. 

The study of crystals might help answering some of these questions, since accurate in situ Sr 

analyzes are now routine in many laboratories (e.g. Davidson et al., 2007; Ramos &amp;amp; Tepley, 2008). 

Volcanic phenocrysts are archives of the chemical and physical evolution of a magma from the 

chamber stage through the ascent and eruption moment. Plagioclase, in particular, has gained 

increased attention due to several reasons: (1) it is present over most of the crystallization interval in 

typical magmatic systems; (2) it is stable over a wide range of crustal T, P, aH2O and melt 

composition; (3) its chemical and isotopic composition might register subtle changes in intensive 

variables, which might help to elucidate magmatic processes; (4) the very slow coupled diffusion of 

CaAl-NaSi prevents plagioclase homogenization and favors preservation of distinct An-content zones 

(Grove et al., 1984); and (5) different shapes and sizes of plagioclase reflect distinct thermal and 

kinetic regimes operating during crystallization (e.g. Lofgren, 1974; Swanson, 1977; Kirkpatrick, 

1979). Thus, plagioclase textural and chemical variations have been widely used to reconstruct 

chamber dynamics, petrological processes and emplacement style from many volcanic provinces (e.g. 

Anderson, 1984; Nixon &amp;amp; Pearce, 1987; Singer et al., 1995; Davidson &amp;amp; Tepley, 1997; Tepley et al., 

2000; Ginibre et al., 2002; Browne et al., 2006; Humphreys et al., 2006; Ruprecht &amp;amp; Wörner, 2007; 

Ginibre &amp;amp; Wörner, 2007; Gagnevin et al., 2007; Andrews et al., 2008; Viccaro et al., 2010, 2016; 

Giacomini et al., 2014; Shane, 2015; Coote &amp;amp; Shane, 2016). 

The crystal size distribution (CSD) theory provides support to evaluate how igneous textures 

evolve and allow quantification of magmatic residence timescales (Randolph &amp;amp; Larson, 1971; 



13 
 

Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh, 1988). The combination of plagioclase chemical and isotopic data with CSD 

results has been proved to be a successful approach to unravel petrological processes (e.g. Piochi et al., 

2005; McCanta et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2007; Salisbury et al., 2008; Fornaciai et al., 2015; Flaherty 

et al., 2018). 

In this work, we investigate some acid volcanic rocks of the PEMP on the surroundings of the 

Guarapuava city, Paraná State, southern Brazil. These rocks present a  tabular geometry up to tens of 

kilometers wide and a high silica content, which together foment a controversial debate about their 

origin and emplacement style; lava vs ignimbrite (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et al., 1995; Polo et al., 

2017; Luchetti et al., 2018a, b). We combined cold-stage cathodoluminescence and scanning electron 

microprobe to select plagioclase crystal zones for the conduction of in situ Sr isotopes analyzes, which 

combined with CSD studies allowed placing time constraints to the identified magmatic processes. We 

compare the results with the data in the literature and, finally, propose some petrological insights to 

the emplacement style for the Guarapuava Acid Volcanics (GAV) rocks and their bearing on the 

evolution of the acid magmatism of the PEMP.

2 GEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND 

The breaking of the Gondwana Supercontinent and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the 

Early Cretaceous was marked by a colossal magmatic event preserved as one of the world’s largest 

Continental Flood Basalts (CFB) known as Paraná-Etendeka Magmatic Province (PEMP). Most of the 

volume of the PEMP outcrops in South America (Fig. 1), with minor amounts preserved on the 

African counterpart, in Namibia (Hawkesworth et al., 1992; Bryan et al. 2010). 

On Brazil, the volcanic rocks of the PEMP occur as shallow intrusions and flows on the top of the 

Phanerozoic sediments of the Paraná Basin. The flows cover ~ 1 x 10
6
 Km

2
 and have thicknesses 

varying from tens of meters up to a kilometer (Frank et al., 2009). Dyke swarms and small alkaline 

intrusions associated in the nearby Pre-Cambrian basement are ubiquitous but much less abundant 

(Comin-Chiaramonti &amp;amp; Gomes, 2005). Accurate Ar

 dating of fresh plagioclase crystals and U-

Pb dating of zircon (Pinto et al., 2011) and baddeleyite (Janasi te al., 2011) crystals separated from 

acid rocks indicate that the whole province formed in a time span of 3 to 5 M.y. in the Early 

Cretaceous around 135 M.y. (Renne et al. 1992, 1996; Thiede &amp;amp; Vasconcelos, 2010; Baksi, 2017). 

The basalts represent over 90% of the lava volume and occur as flows and shallow intrusions 

(dykes and sills) reaching up 1500 m in the thickest portions (Frank et al., 2009). Intermediate rocks 

correspond to around 7% of the province, whereas silicic lavas represent less than 2.5% of the total 

PMP volume; albeit volumetrically less important, their volume overcomes what is commonly 

associated to CFBs worldwide (Nardy et al., 2002; Bryan et al., 2010). The tholeiitic magmatism is 

regionally distinctive in geochemistry, with high titanium basalts (HTiB) prevailing to the north, 

whereas low titanium basalts (LTiB) occur chiefly at the south of the PEMP. These were subsequently 

divided in other subtypes based on isotopic and trace element signatures (Peate et al., 1992; Peate, 

1997; Nardy et al., 2002; Polo &amp;amp; Janasi, 2014) and are shown in Table 1.  

The acid volcanics occurs as isolated plateaus restricted to the eastern edge of the Paraná 

sedimentary basin along the 25 - 35°S latitudes (Fig. 1). Based on textural and compositional 

contrasts, the acid rocks are divided in two major groups: Palmas, which comprises microporphyritic 

to aphyric, low-Ti dacites and rhyolites, and Chapecó, which is composed of porphyritic, high-Ti 

trachydacites and dacites. Both types were further subdivided into minor types on the basis of their 

isotopic and trace element signatures (Table 1; Peate et al., 1992; Peate, 1997; Garland et al., 1995 

Nardy et al., 2008).

Irrespective of composition, high and low titanium compositions prevail roughly at the north and 

south of the province, respectively (Fig. 1). The sharing of common isotopic and geochemical features 

between the acid rocks and their associated basalts suggest an apparent petrogenetic relation (Fig. 2). 

The restricted occurrence of these rocks on the eastern edge of the basin suggest the role of a high heat 

flux close to the former rift axis on their genesis. The higher radiogenic signatures of the Palmas rocks 

would reflect processes of crustal contamination combined with fractional crystallization of the 

parental basaltic magma (Garland et al., 1995; Florisbal et al., 2018). Partial melting of middle/lower 

crust might be more relevant than suspected for the Palmas petrogenesis (Harris &amp;amp; Milner, 1997). 

Otherwise, partial melting of basaltic underplates with negligible crustal assimilation is evoked as the 

main processes responsible for the Chapecó petrogenesis (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et al., 1995). 

The present work focuses on the Chapecó rocks of the Guarapuava Acid Volcanics (GAV) type 

that crops out on the transitional zone between the north and south domains of the PEMP (Fig. 1). The 

local geology is marked by intercalations of Pitanga (HTiB) and Esmeralda (LTiB) basalts, forming a 

mafic sequence reaching up 1 km in thickness overlying Paleozoic sediments from the Paraná Basin 

(Lopes, 2008). The GAV rocks cover this basaltic unit, forming tabular sequences with thicknesses up 

to 100 meters (Nardy et al., 2002). Literature data indicate that GAV whole-rock major element 

composition are remarkably similar, being classified as trachydacites (Bellieni et al., 1986; Garland et 

al., 1995; Nardy et al., 2008, 2011;  Pinto et al., 2011; Luchetti et al., 2014; Table 2).

3  METHODS 

3.1  Textural Measurements 

Plagioclase quantitative textural measurements were performed on nine GAV samples 

collected in the surroundings of Guarapuava city (Figure 1 and Table 3 for samples location). Six to 

seven 30µm-thick sections were obtained per sample. The serial sectioning was intended to improve 

the statistical representativeness of the results, rather than to reconstruct 3D crystal shapes. Optical 

microscopy and imaging were performed under uncrossed polarized light using a petrographic 

microscope (Leica M420) coupled to a regular digital camera. The photos were mosaicked in order to 

obtain images of the thin section as a whole (see Fig. 3). Plagioclase crystals were manually outlined 

using Adobe Photoshop, in order to prevent problems with the individualization of touching crystals 

(see appendix 8.1). The digitized images from different thin sections of the same sample were stacked 

together as a unique panel. Dimensions of the bestfit ellipses of the digitized crystals were obtained 

using ImageJ software, an open access image analysis program (Rasband, 2010). The results were 

imported into the CSDCorrections 1.51 software (Higgins, 2000) for stereological corrections and 

acquisition of the CSD curves.       

 

Table 3 - Sample locations. 

 

The stereological conversion requires the input of the mean crystal shape expressed in terms of the 

short(S) : intermediate(I) : long(L) axes. According to Higgins (1994), the S/I ratio is close to the 

intersection width/length mode calculated by the CSDCorrections software (constant at 0.59 for the 

analyzed samples). Assessment of the I/L ratio in randomly oriented rocks is more complicated. 

Higgins (1994) suggested using the skewness of the intersection rate distributions, whereas Higgins 

(2006a) proposed examining the (010) face of plagioclase crystals for direct evaluation of the I/L ratio. 

Suitably oriented plagioclase crystals resulted I/L ratio close to 0.7. Thus, the plagioclase aspect ratio 

chosen to represent all samples was 1.0 : 1.7 : 2.5. Most crystals have euhedral habits with angular 

shapes and were considered to have a roundness factor of 0.3 (on a scale of 0 to 1; 0=block; 



19 
 

1=ellipsoid). Logarithmic length intervals were defined in a way that the next bin is 10
0.20

 times larger 

than the previous one. All the CSDs were calculated on a vesicle free basis (tests varying the vesicle 

amount up to 3% produced no appreciable differences). Bins with less than 10 crystals per unit area or 

with large uncertainties were removed from the CSDs due to compromised measurement precision.

are the respective digitized outlines of plagioclase crystals. 

3.2  Cathodoluminescence Imaging 

The bombardment of materials by electrons produces a wide range of secondary particles and 

radiations, including light, which is the phenomenon of cathodoluminescence (CL) (Pagel et al., 

2000). Electrons lose their energy fast in minerals; hence, the CL light is produced close to the surface. 

CL light has a wide range of wavelengths, but usually only the visible light is used for geological 

purposes. The intensity and color of luminescence are highly variable and depend on several factors 

including the concentration of activator trace elements (Table 4). In plagioclase, the most important 

activators are Mn
2+

 and Fe
3+

, but the elements Cu
2+

, Ti
4+

, Ce
3+

 and Eu
2+

 may also be important (Mora 

&amp;amp; Ramseyer, 1992). 

 



 

20 
 

Table 4 - Cathodoluminescence properties of the minerals found in the volcanic rocks imaged in this study. 

  

 

In this study, CL images were obtained at the University of Québec at Chicoutimi, Canada, with a 

CITL CL8200 cold cathode instrument mounted on a regular petrographic microscope. In this 

equipment, a wide electron beam is directed towards a polished thin section, which is in a vacuum 

chamber attached to the microscope stage. An area about 3 mm in diameter is obliquely illuminated 

with electrons. Light from the section escapes through a window into the objective of the microscope 

and the system detects simultaneously both CL color and intensity. The images were acquired using a 

voltage of 10 Kv and an electric current of 185 µÅ. Multiple images were mosaicked to give a 

composite image covering the entire thin section.  

 

3.3  Scanning Electron Microscope 

One sample (FP-15-15) with well-defined banded structure was cut and separated in slices 

representing the macroscopic diversity of the GAV (lighter and darker bands). Each slice was 

separately crushed in millimeter-size pieces and mounted on polished epoxy sections. Scanning 

Electron Microscope (SEM) was performed using a Quanta 600 FEG (FEI) coupled with an energy 

disperse spectrometer (EDS; Quantax, Bruker) in the Laboratório de Caracterização Tecnológica 

(LCT) of the Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo. Phases associations were characterized 

through backscattered images, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray digital mapping for 

the major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Ca, Ti, P).  

 

3.4   X-ray Diffraction 

 X-ray diffraction patterns of powder samples from the lighter and darker bands of sample FP-

15-15 were collected in a Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer at the Núcleo de Apoio à Pesquisa 

(NAP) Geoanalítica, Instituto de Geociências da Universidade de São Paulo (IGc-USP). Analyzes 

were performed in a step scan mode with angular range from 5° to 120° 2?, step size 0.02°, 70s/step, 

Cu K?, 40kV, 40mA, flat sample holders, fixed divergence slit and 0.1mm receiving slit. The samples 

were mixed with 10 wt% of high purity ?-Al2O3. Ritveld refinements was performed using High Score 

Plus 3.0 Panalytical Software. The following crystallographic information files (CIF) were used: 

plagioclase An52 (Horst et al., 1981), quartz, sanidine and augite (Gualtieri, 2000). Magnetite, 



21 
 

pigeonite, enstatite and apatite occur as minor phases and were not included in quantitative phase 

analyzes due to their low weight fraction and, consequently, large intrinsic errors.  

 

3.5  Plagioclase in situ analyzes 

 Plagioclase isotopic analyzes were conducted with in adjacent micrometric spots in order to 

sample material from the same mineral growth zones.  

In situ Sr isotope analyzes in plagioclase were carried out at two stages. One at the Radiogenic 

Isotope Facility (RIF, University of Alberta, Canada) in 2009 (sample FP-15-15) and another one at 

the MidWest Isotope and Trace Element Research Analytical Center (MITERAC) of the University of 

Notre Dame in 2017 (samples PA-16-01 and -21). The analyses at the RIF were conducted using a 

NuPlasma MC-ICP-MS coupled with a Laser Ablation UP213 system under analytical conditions of 

laser beam diameter of 160 µm and 10 Hz frequency at energy output of approximately 11J/cm
2
. 

Whereas, the analyses at the MITERAC were performed using a NuPlasma II MC-ICP-MS coupled 

with the Excimer NWR-193 nm LA system, under analytical conditions of laser beam diameter of 150 

µm at a 10 Hz frequency at energy output of approximately 14J/cm
2
. For Sr isotope determinations, a 

modern coral was used as external standard, whereas monitoring of the invariant 
84

Sr/
86

Sr ratio 

0.056546 ± 0.00001 (2?) allowed assessment of the effectiveness of the interference correction. 

Repeated measurements on the modern coral yielded an average 
87

Sr/
86

Sr value 0.709156 ± 0.00005 

(2?) which agree with the value for the modern sea water of 0.709168 (Hodell et al., 1990).

4 RESULTS 

4.1 Field Aspects 

GAV exposures are marked by a laterally discontinuous sub horizontal banding that alternates 

three-dimensional light- and dark-colored  bands with anastomosed geometries with high aspect ratios 

(Figs. 4 a and b). As a purely descriptive term, this pattern will be referred as banding. There seems to 

be a close association between banding and fracturing. The light bands are composed predominantly 

by a very fine granular white material; whereas the dark bands have a prevailing massive appearance 

(Figs.4 c and d). In spite of the apparently sharp transition between bands, there is no evident 

petrographic difference and close inspection reveals the contacts to be of diffuse and gradational 

character (Figs. 4c and d). At outcrop scale, the internal fabric of the rock is massive and 

homogeneous showing no preferred orientation of crystals and major differences between both bands 

other than their colors. Spherical vesicles up to 5 mm are a common feature, but in small amounts and 

their distribution is apparently unrelated to banding. The samples have bimodal texture marked by 

very fine-grained matrix interspersed with plagioclase macrocrysts reaching up 1.5 cm (Figs. 4 c-f). 

Some single plagioclase crystals are common in both bands (Figs. 4 d and f). The precise stratigraphic 

control of the visited outcrops imposed a very challenging task due to extensive faulting and the 

presence of thick soil horizons.

color. Groundmass in yellow. 

 



 

24 
 

4.2 Petrography 

4.2.1 Groundmass  

The matrix represents 80 to 90% volume of the samples. It is defined by a framework of 

indiscernible crystallites and small crystals (&amp;lt;0.2mm) of pyroxene and Ti-rich magnetite (Figs. 6a and 

b). Glass was not observed in optical or electron microscopy, neither was it detected in X-ray 

diffraction. Despite the relative homogeneity, the groundmass shows subtle size variations according 

to the sample stratigraphic position, with the finest sample observed just above the contact with the 

underlying basalts. Irrespective of band color, the matrices from different bands show no substantial 

differences under the petrographic microscope. 

4.2.2 Plagioclase 

Plagioclase is the most abundant macrocrystic phase, corresponding to 10-15% area in thin 

sections. Plagioclase occurs preferably as individual euhedral crystals (Figs. 6c and d) up to 1 cm or, 

less frequently, as mono or polymineralic clusters. Plagioclase crystals from the mineral clusters 

contrast with individual crystals in having rounded edges and sinuous contacts against each other. 

Regardless of the textural association, most crystals show no evident zoning under the petrographic 

microscope. The largest crystals commonly host irregular 0.2 to 2 mm wide patches filled with 

material that resemble the matrix of the rock, interpreted to represent devitrified melt inclusions.    

4.2.3 Pyroxene  

Pyroxene occurs either as widespread individual crystals set in the groundmass, as fine 

aggregates within and around plagioclase (Figs. 6c, d, g-m), or as rare monomineralic clusters (Fig. 

6n). It has smaller sizes (0.1 to 1 mm) compared with plagioclase and show subeuhedral to anhedral 

habits, often exhibiting rounded shapes when clustered with plagioclase (Figs. 6i and j).

4.3   CL Images 

CL images of nine 100 µm-thick polished sections (for sample locations, see Table 2) 

highlighted important details of the GAV trachydacite texture. The groundmass is composed by an 

irregular mixture of distinct patches in dark and bright shades of blue (Figs. 5 and 6a). The dark blue 

patches constitute a fine framework resembling touching feldspar microlites with interstices filled by 

quartz (Figs. 7a and b). The feldspar microlites have sizes up to 100µm, but are usually much smaller. 

They commonly show inner and outer portions in green and blue colors, respectively (Fig. 7b). The 

bright blue patches are monomineralic aggregates of feldspar crystals (Figs. 7c and d). Some samples 

show irregular fractures which are immediately surrounded by dark blue patches; whilst bright ones 

occur gradually further from it (Figs. 7e and f). One exception to the textural patterns described above 

is the sample taken at the contact with the basaltic substrate (PA-16-21). It shows a very fine, 

homogeneous groundmass with a regular CL response in dark blue color (Figs. 7g, h and i). Another 

striking feature from the groundmass observed on all the samples is a remarkable spatial association 

between tiny apatite crystals and pyroxene/Fe-Ti oxides (Fig. 7i). A similar texture has been described 

in the Palmas volcanic rocks (Dias et al., 2017).  

Irrespective of shape and size, plagioclase macrocrysts show homogeneous CL responses both 

intra- and inter samples. Crystals appears always with dark green luminescence (Figs. 8a and b). 

Structures like zonation, growth and resorption zones are either lacking or are very rare and 

obliterated. Pockets filled with materials similar to the groundmass are interpreted as devitrified melt 

inclusions and appear in different shades of blue and varying shapes and sizes (Figs. 8c,d and e).

4.4 SEM Images and Major Element Characterization of the Groundmass 

 The matrices of the light and dark bands appear as relatively homogeneous, indistinct shades 

of grey with conspicuous presence of small crystals of apatite, pyroxene, and Fe-oxides (Figs. 9a and 

b). A closer inspection reveal both matrices to be defined by two petrographically distinct domains: 

one with a continuous backscattered signal (Massive Matrix – MM), and another one defined by a 

discontinuous backscattered signal speckled by varying amounts of tiny vugs (Porous Matrix – PM) 

(Figs. 9c and d). Both occur dispersed through the matrices composing irregular areas with diffuse 

contacts against each other (Figs. 9c-h).  

 

4.4.1 Massive matrix (MM) 

X-ray mapping of the MM domain reveals a mottled pattern that alternates dark and light 

tones of grey (Fig. 10a). Element maps reveal the former to be composed of Si, whereas the light areas 

have increased Na, K and Al contents, implying a quartz-feldspathic composition, respectively (Figs. 9 

b-e). The inner portions of the feldspathic zones are enriched in Na, Ca and Al, whereas the outer parts 

contain enhanced K contents. All these findings are in agreement with EDS analyzes (Fig. 10a and in 



 

32 
 

appendix 8.2). A merged image of all the individual maps gives a clear view of how the compositional 

variability (Fig. 10i). 

 

4.4.2 Porous matrix (PM) 

Locally, tiny feldspar crystals with a “vuggy” aspect occur interspersed with the PM. A 

representative image comprehending both MM and PM is illustrated in Figure 11a. The same 

compositional trends described so far are also observed in the MM domain. However, the PM (on the 

right corner of Fig. 11) shows high responses of K, Al and Na and intermediate ones of Si compared 

with the contents observed in the MM, implying an alkali feldspar composition (Figs. 11b-e). Again, a 

merged image of all the individual maps clearly illustrates the distribution of the major elements (Fig. 

11j), confirmed by EDS analyses as indicated in Figure 11a and in appendix 8.2. 

 

Table 6 - Summary of the MM and PM features. 

 

 

The small black features seen in Figs. 10 and 11 are interpreted as vugs, once they did not present 

any chemical response, and correspond to areas with no CL signal. A summary of the features from 

both domains is presented in Table 6.

4.5  X-ray Diffraction 

Figure 12 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns from both light and dark bands of sample FP-

15-15. They have similar mineral composition, with large predominance of plagioclase over quartz 

and sanidine, and smaller amounts of augite. However, important differences in mineral relative 

abundance are observed, since the dark band is enriched in quartz and depleted in sanidine relative to 

the light band (Table 7). Both bands are holocrystaline.

4.6   Crystal Size Distribution 

Plagioclase CSD results are shown in Figure 13a. Crystal populations were divided in 11 to 12 

size ranges (Table 8). The CSDs have striking similar shapes defining concave-up curves, with a turn-

down at classes with smaller crystal sizes. Sample PA-16-21, which was sampled at the contact with 

the basaltic substrate, shows steeper patterns for the smaller crystal classes (Fig. 13a). Plagioclase 

crystals were separated in different populations according to a main inflection on the CSD curves 

represented by separate linear fits (Fig. 13b). We defined phenocrysts and microphenocrysts as being 

larger and smaller than 3 mm respectively. Except for the fit obtained for sample PA-16-21, the 

resulting values for slope and intercept of the linear segments are very similar (Table 9). Residence 

times calculated for microphenocyst and phenocryst populations are shown in Table 9.

4.7  Plagioclase Sr isotopes  

 Sr isotope results obtained on plagioclase crystals are summarized in Figure 14. Obtained 

ratios vary from 0.70549 to 0.70587 with an average 2? uncertainty of ± 0.00004 and Rb/Sr under 

0.02. Except for sample FP-15-15 which shows 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios overlapping within error, two of the 

three analyzed crystals in sample PA-16-01, and three of the four analyzed crystals in sample PA-16-

21, display intracrystal variations outside analytical error. As a general trend, isotope profiles are 

marked either by more radiogenic cores overgrown by comparatively primitive rims, referred as A-

type profiles (sample PA-16-01) or by more primitive cores overgrown by isotopically evolved rims, 

referred as U-type profiles (sample PA-16-21). Regardless of isotope zoning fashion, obtained 

87
Sr/

86
Sr ratios all fall within the isotopic spectrum of the GAV whole rock data (see blue area in Fig. 

14; Garland et al., 1995).

Sr ratio and its envelopes are shown in thick and thin 

green lines, respectively. The blue area represents the GAV whole-rock 
87

Sr/

Sr interval (Garland et al., 1995). Bar length 

represent analytical errors. Sample FP-15-15 (red bars) have no spatial control relative to core-rim distance. On other 

samples, each color represent a single analyzed crystal. Empty and filled bars represent rims and cores, respectively. One 

stippled bar in sample PA-16-21 correspond to an intermediate analyzed position. 



39 
 

5  DISCUSSION 

5.1  Reliability of in situ Sr isotopes 

 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios determined via LA-ICP-MS might be hampered by the interference of 
87

Rb. 

Thus, the latter must be corrected in order to guarantee reliable Sr isotope ratios. Rb has only one non-

radiogenic isotope (
85

Rb) and mass bias fractionation of Sr might be applied to correct the Rb 

fractionation. In order to minimize such problems, this technique must be applied for materials bearing 

very low Rb/Sr ratios (usually&amp;lt;0.05) (Ramos et al., 2004; Vroon et al., 2008). The high Sr signals 

(average 2.88 V) imply minimum Rb isobaric interference.and reliable 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios determinations.  

 

5.2  Plagioclase CSD Shapes 

In igneous rocks, the final texture results from a balance between kinetic, mechanical and 

equilibrium processes (e.g. Higgins, 2006). Concave-up CSDs have been reported in many natural 

rocks and attributed to a variety of processes such as physical mixing of distinct magmas (Higgins, 

1996; Salisbury et al., 2008), textural coarsening (Higgins, 1998, 2002, 2011a,b), continuous to 

sudden changes of intensive magmatic variables (Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh, 1988; Armienti, 1994; Marsh, 

1998; Ngonge et al., 2013; Preece et al., 2013; Fornaciai et al., 2015), heterogeneous nucleation 

(Špillar &amp;amp; Dolejš, 2015) or a combination of these processes. Concave-up CSDs were also obtained in 

run products of experimental studies, reinforcing the ubiquity of this feature in silicate melts (e.g. 

Burkhard, 2002; Pupier et al., 2008; Brugger &amp;amp; Hammer, 2010). The concave-up CSDs reported in 

this study display a turn-down to the left of their maximum population density (Fig. 13a). This effect 

cannot be an artifact due to inadequate spatial resolution as the smallest bin represented on the CSD 

graph – 0.147 to 0.233 mm – has distinct values among different samples and all of them were 

obtained following the same procedures. The scarcity of crystals under a critical size might be 

achieved by textural coarsening, also known as Ostwald ripening (Voorhees, 1992). As smaller 

crystals have a higher surface/volume ratio than larger ones, they contain a higher surface free energy, 

which might imply in their dissolution to give way to coarser crystals in melts kept under high 

temperature, close to the mineral liquidus (Higgins, 2011a). As coarsening progresses, the slope of the 

right side of the CSD decreases. The observation of rounded plagioclase crystals with curved contacts 

against each other and the relatively scarcity of small crystals associated with the exceptionally high 

GAV magmatic temperatures (Table 10), are consistent to coarsening as the main mechanism 

responsible for the concave-up curvature of the plagioclase CSD curves.

5.3  Magmatic Timescales 

According to the CSD theory, the slope of the CSD curve is inversely proportional to the 

product of growth rate (G) and residence time ( ) (Marsh, 1988). However, G is a composition-

dependent factor that may show a non-linear relation with cooling rates (e.g. Gibb, 1974; Swanson, 

1977; Fenn, 1977). Cashman (1993) showed that increasing cooling rate by 100 will produce an 

insignificant tenfold increase in G values of plagioclase crystallizing from basaltic melts. This 

corroborated previous findings that plagioclase G commonly vary no more than one order of 

magnitude over a broad range of crystallization conditions (Cashman &amp;amp; Marsh, 1988; Cashman, 1990, 

1992).  

Plagioclase growth rates in acid magmas are still poorly constrained relative to mafic compositions. 

Estimates based on experimental studies (Geschwind &amp;amp; Rutherford, 1995; Hammer &amp;amp; Rutherford, 

2002; Couch, 2003; Larsen, 2005; Brugger &amp;amp; Hammer, 2010), crystal size distribution (Cashman, 

1992; Higgins, 1996; Hammer et al., 1999), compositional zoning patterns (McCanta et al., 2007), and 

in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling (Genareau &amp;amp; Clarke, 2010), point to typical 

values ranging between 10
-8

 and 10
-9

 mm.s
-1

. Using these growth rates, the obtained timescales are up 

to a few tens of years (Table 9). We prefer the slower growth rates and respective timescales for the 

phenocrysts (35-40 years), whereas faster growth rates are preferred for the microphenocryst 

population (1.5–1.8 years). 

 

5.4  Eruptive Style 

Acid lavas with large areal extents and low aspect ratios are rarely observed within intraplate 

volcanic provinces (Bonnichsen &amp;amp; Kauffman, 1987; Henry et al., 1988; Creaser &amp;amp; White, 1991; Green 

&amp;amp; Fitz, 1993). This is because acid magma often forms pyroclastic deposits produced by explosive 

instead of effusive volcanic activity (e.g. Cas &amp;amp; Wright, 1987). Previous studies have proposed 

textural and field criteria for distinguishing between strongly rheomorphic ignimbrites and extensive 

silicic lavas (Henry &amp;amp; Wolff, 1992). However, these criteria are often ambiguous, blurring a verdict 

about the eruptive style (e.g. Henry et al., 1988; Andrews &amp;amp; Branney, 2011). 

Most studies regarding the emplacement model of the PMP acid volcanism are concentrated on the 

southernmost Palmas rocks, where an effusive eruption style seems to predominate (Garland et al., 

1995; Waichel et al., 2012; Polo &amp;amp; Janasi, 2014; Polo et al., 2017; Rosseti et al., 2017; Guimarães et 

al., 2017; Simões et al., 2017; Lima et al., 2018). Similar investigations on the Chapecó-type rocks are 

much less abundant, but equally point to a predominant effusive emplacement (Garland et al., 1995; 

Janasi et al., 2007). However, the eruptive style of Palmas and Chapecó rocks is still a matter of debate 

and rejection is specially based on the acid nature of such rocks (Luchetti et al., 2018a, b). 

Literature geothermometric data calculated using different models indicate that the Chapecó-type 

rocks crystallized from very hot magmas, with temperatures on the order of 950 – 1050°C (see Table 



41 
 

10). GAV magmas water content were estimated by input of whole rock major element composition 

(Table 2), plagioclase anorthite content (Nardy et al., 2011) and magmatic temperature (Table 10), 

using to be very low (below 1.5% H2O, Fig. 17a; Waters &amp;amp; Lange, 2015). Afterwards, viscosity values 

were calculated by input of 1.5% H2O, 1000°C and atmospheric pressure was probably close to 10
4.01

 

Pa.s (Fig. 17b, Giordano et al., 2008). These results are considerably lower than intensive variables 

calculated for recent well-documented lavas with similar silica contents (59-65% SiO2) that flowed far 

from their vents (viscosities ranging from 10
9 

- 10
11

 Pa s; MacKay et al., 1998; Navarro-Ochoa et al., 

2002; Harris et al., 2004).  

 

Table 10 - Geothermometric data of the Chapecó rocks compiled from the literature. Temperatures are reported in Celsius 

degrees. 

  

 

Luchetti et al. (2018b) found similar viscosity values for the GAV magmas, but instead of an 

effusive eruptive style, the authors proposed a pyroclastic low fountaining origin for the respective 

deposits, and stressed the fact that similar or even less viscous magmas could fragment and behave 

explosively, according to experimental work performed on rhyolite melts of calc-alkaline (10
6
 – 10

8
 Pa 

s; Castro &amp;amp; Dingwell, 2009) or pantelleritic (10
4
 – 10

6
 Pa s; Di Genova et al., 2013; Campagnola et al., 

2016; Hughes et al., 2017) compositions. However, we stress that direct comparison of rocks with 

such distinct compositions and geological settings has to be taken cautiously, because of the intricate 

relationship between composition and viscosity.

temperature and pressure conditions. As there are no published glass/groundmass analyses of the GAV rocks, we considered 

the whole-rock as the initial melt composition. Above 1000°C the water contents are negligible and were omitted from the 

graph. Whole-rock compositions and corresponding plagioclase An contents required for the calculations were taken from 

Garland et al. (1995), Lopes (2008) and Nardy et al. (2011). Hygrometer model by Waters &amp;amp; Lange (2015). B) Graph

Viscosity model by Giordano et al. (2008). 

 

Based on the detailed investigation performed in this contribution, we offer an alternative 

explanation for the eruptive style of the GAV rocks. The steeper and larger population density of 

sample PA-16-21 (taken from the contact with the underlying basalts) along with the smaller 

plagioclase sizes, indicate a faster solidification of the lower border relative to the core of the volcanic 

body (Fig.13a; Table 9). Such stratigraphic controlled plagioclase size distribution has not been 

described in ignimbrites. Unfortunately, due to erosion, we did not find an equivalent upper border, 

but there is no obvious reason to believe it does not existed. Once formed, these fast-solidified borders 

would act as carapaces preventing further heat loss and reducing cooling rates at the interior of the 

flow via thermal insulation. Remote imaging of active lava fields has demonstrated how exceptional 

thermal insulation allow km-scale flowing of highly viscous acid lavas (Harris et al., 2004; Tuffen et 

al., 2013). The combination of low magmatic viscosities, high eruption rates and thermal insulation 

would have created a singular condition for an effusive emplacement of the GAV magmas, accounting 

for their sheet-like geometry. The identification of Chapecó (Ourinhos type; Janasi et al., 2007) and 

Palmas (Simões et al., 2017; Lima et al., 2018) dykes point to a fissural and shallow feeder system for 

the acid magmatism of the PEMP, in which such flows would be continuously fed and inflated by 

these dykes. The lack of basal breccias, typical at the contact of regular lava flows with the substrate 

due to the large temperature difference, would be explained by flow of the acid lavas over a relatively 

hot basaltic substrate that could prevent the development of fractures as on the lower portions of the 

GAV deposits. 

 

 



43 
 

5.5  The origin of banded structures 

Banding in the acid rocks of the PEMP has been interpreted as a product of bomb coalescence 

and welding (dark bands, or ´blobs’) followed by stretching due to flow-induced rheomorphism in a 

low-explosivity, fire fountain, eruptive scenario (Luchetti et al., 2018a). The authors did not discuss 

how such coalescence would produce the alternate colors observed in rocks. 

Based on the detailed textural studies conducted in bands with different colors, we offer an 

alternative explanation for the origin of the banded structure based on: (1) the lack of broken crystals 

or of any kind of discontinuity observed in the groundmass under the petrographic microscope, CL 

and SEM images (2) the crosscut relationship between different bands and plagioclase major axis (3) 

the low viscosities and very low water contents dissolved in the magmas that would allow flowing 

even considering the high silica contents (4) the isotopic homogeneity recorded in plagioclase (5) the 

regional scale of the banding occurring through tens of meters thick volcanic deposits.  

Magmatic flow banding has been attributed to magma mingling (e.g. Seaman et al., 1995) or 

repeated fracture and healing events (e.g. Tuffen et al., 2003; Gonnermann &amp;amp; Manga, 2005). However, 

such mechanisms seem unlikely here once GAV show no evidence of interaction between contrasting 

magmas and the observed banding is not planar neither shows abrupt contacts, respectively. The 

complete lack of textural evidence further disproves these hypotheses. Seaman et al. (2009) suggested 

that heterogeneous distribution of water in a rhyolitic lava flow could led to uneven undercooling 

rates, textures and colors, resulting in flow banding. Despite the very low water contents of the GAV 

magmas (? 1.5%; Fig. 17), fluids certainly played a role on the eruptive style as indicated by the 

common presence of vesicles. Feldspar microlites in the massive matrix (MM) domains are commonly 

characterized by plagioclase cores (possibly andesine) mantled by potassium-rich alkali feldspar rims 

(see Fig. 10i); compositional pairs which are not in equilibrium (Nekvasil, 1992). This uncommon 

feature has also been described in the Merapi Dome andesitic lavas, Indonesia, where it was attributed 

to a sudden change in the melt evolution path over the feldspar ternary diagram, passing from the 

plagioclase + liquid field to the alkali feldspar + liquid field in response to syn-eruptive degassing, 

allowing overgrowth of the alkali feldspar over plagioclase (Hammer et al., 2000).  

Interstitial quartz crystals in the MM indicate a highly evolved melt and relatively small 

undercooling rates allowing sluggish nucleation and growth of quartz. Apparently, degassing only 

occurred in very shallow levels and probably continued up to the surface (Nardy et al., 2011). We 

suggest that the GAV magmas were originally erupted as a homogeneous mixture of very hot lava 

carrying a ~15% crystal cargo containing plagioclase + pyroxene + Fe-Ti oxides and minor volatiles. 

The lack of flow banding and massive aspect of the groundmass on sample PA-16-21 (Figs. 7g, h and 

i), taken at the contact with the basaltic substrate, reinforce this interpretation, since rapid 

crystallization would prevent flow and continued growth of the plagioclase microphenocryst 

population. The high eruption rates and relatively low viscosities enabled a relatively fast outpouring 



 

44 
 

and spreading of the GAV magmas over the flat and probably hot basaltic paleosurface. Once the MM 

domains started crystallizing in the inner portions of the body, the exsolved fluids would have diffused 

away from the anhydrous intergrowth in a self-organized fashion, enriching the residual melt in water 

and decreasing its viscosity. The fluid might have escaped through open spaces as horizontal cooling 

cracks (Figs. 7e and f). As this process progressed, multiple discrete zones with contrasting rheology 

developed, separating high viscosity MM-dominated zones and low viscosity fluid-enriched zones. 

The driving force for this zonation was probably flow-induced shearing within the lava due to gradual 

viscosity rise. The same mechanism might explains the sub-horizontal, yet irregular, stretched 

geometry of the flow bands, parallel to the flow direction. Thus, MM-dominated domains apparently 

achieved their rheological lock-up early and crystallized to originate the dark bands. The residual 

fluid-enriched zones remained plastic and developed an interconnected permeable network that 

allowed open-system degassing, precluding explosive activity. This interpretation is supported by 

outcrop relationships in which light bands locally cross-cut dark bands. The sinuous and diffusive 

nature of the contacts between distinct bands are assigned to the very high magmatic temperatures, 

which enabled healing and interfingering between the two described rheological domains.   

The different colors on both bands are probably a late to post-magmatic feature related to different 

porosities or mineralogical abundances (Fig. 12; Table 7). The awkward “vuggy” aspect of the 

feldspars in the PM domains could result from an extreme case of non-radiating spherulite 

crystallization due to very high undercooling rates. We do not discard the possibility of selective 

hydrothermalism, that would have led to quartz leaching and leaving the vuggy feldspar behind 

(dequartzification; e.g. Cathelineau, 1986; Petersson &amp;amp; Eliasson, 1997). To our knowledge, none such 

similar texture has been described to date.  

 

5.6  Petrogenetic Insights 

The analyzed rocks show 10-15% of plagioclase macrocrysts without any appreciable optical 

zoning. The homogeneity in CSD curves indicate that the large plagioclase crystals resided in a deep-

seated reservoir under supersolidus conditions up to 40 years (Table 9). Plagioclase crystals show 

remarkably similar  textural histories which, together with homogeneous Sr isotope signatures indicate 

that they shared a common deep reservoir where they grew as true phenocrysts, given that isotope 

signatures coincide with whole-rock data (Davidson et al., 2007).   

We interpret plagioclase + pyroxene clusters described here are interpreted as disrupted mushy 

margins of the magmatic chamber and, in this sense, represent cumulate fragments or autholits. 

Similar occurrences have been described in intraplate silicic ignimbrites elsewhere (e.g. Barbey et al., 

2005; Ellis &amp;amp; Wolf, 2012; Ellis et al., 2014). Very high magmatic temperatures, high crystallinity and 

limited interaction with the surrounding melt prevented plagioclase growth and enabled textural 



45 
 

maturation by coarsening of these cumulate fragments, as suggested by lobate and healed contacts. On 

the other hand, individual euhedral plagioclase crystals seem to have grown with available space, 

probably in the inner portions of the chamber, in a cogenetic magmatic system to that envisaged for 

the crystallization of the cumulate fragments, given their coincident chemical and isotopic signatures.  

Subtle fluctuations in the 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios in plagioclase suggest protracted melt supply in the 

magmatic chamber. These recharge/reinjection events by similar cogenetic magma batches would 

redistribute the cumulate fragments and induce turbulence within the chamber, favoring 

homogenization. Moreover, it would prevent rapid cooling and provide the heat required for the long-

lived crystallization interval of the plagioclase phenocrysts (Table 9).

6  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

 Plagioclase phenocrysts from the trachydacites of the Guarapuava region occur preferably as 

single euhedral and unzoned crystals. There is a rare but common association of plagioclase in 

multimineralic clusters containing pyroxene ± Fe-Ti oxides. Combined petrography (via optical 

microscopy, SEM and CL) and CSD studies enabled the recognition of two distinct environments of 

plagioclase crystallization: one under deep-seated conditions with local action of coarsening, 

responsible for the crystallization of plagioclase phenocrysts and cumulate fragments or autholits, and 

another one at the shallow and/or surface level, responsible for the crystallization of plagioclase 

microphenocryst population. Magmatic timescales of crystallization of phenocrysts and 

microphenocrysts varied from a few tens of years (&amp;lt;40 years; G = 10 
-9

mm.s
-1

) to less than 2 years (G 

= 10
-8 

mm.s
-1

), respectively. Plagioclase Sr isotopes showed a very subtle inter- and intracrystalline 

variation, with 
87

Sr/
86

Sr ratios overlapping with whole-rock isotopy, implying a relatively monogenetic 

magmatic system throughout GAV evolution.  

The irregular flow banding observed in the majority of the GAV outcrops revealed to be defined by 

sinuous dark and light bands with distinct textures and mineral abundances. This structure formed 

during syn-eruptive degassing of the GAV magmas and heterogeneous distribution of water within it, 

leading to discrete zones organized in centimeter scale with distinct rheology. Banding is marked by 

alternation of porous and massive domains and the first probably result from the self-organized fluid 

exsolution that might have led to selective hydrotermalism and quartz leaching. Based on the intensive 

and rheological parameters calculated for the studied rocks, we argument an effusive eruptive style for 

the rocks outcropping in the Guarapuava region.
