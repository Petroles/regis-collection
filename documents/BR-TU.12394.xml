Abstract 

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by at least 30% since pre-industrial times 

due to human activities. Part of this CO2 has been absorbed by oceans, inducing ocean 

acidification and, therefore, several impacts in the marine biota. Natural shallow-water CO2 

vents have generated a substantial interest in recent years as in situ laboratories for ocean 

acidification studies. The present study was focused on the effects of ocean acidification on 

mesozooplankton communities. Two active volcanic areas with submarine CO2 emissions, in 

the islands of São Miguel and Faial, were chosen and independently studied, through the 

choice of three different sites: Reference, Intermediate and Vent, characterized for their 

increase in the CO2 degassing activity, and consequent pH decrease. Differences in the 

abundance, diversity and structure of mesozooplankton among sites were described, along 

with the characterization of the community in these areas, since previous information is 

scarce. Differences were found in the composition of the zooplanktonic assemblages among 

sites in São Miguel and among dates in Faial. Through the nMDS analyses, Radiozoa, 

Paracalanus parvus and Evadne spinifera appeared more related to vent conditions, while 

Cirripedia nauplii were closer to the reference conditions. Conditions in Faial did not allow a 

clear separation among sites in the nMDS analyses, since the strong currents mix the water, 

dissipating the effect of the gas emissions, and variation among days becomes more important 

and statistically significant. The RNA:DNA ratio of selected mesozooplankton populations 

was used, as proxies for physiological condition. RNA:DNA did not show a clear pattern of 

variation, copepods in São Miguel and cladocerans in Faial had an higher ratio in the 

reference sites, but with no gradual decrease to the Vent. Fish eggs seem to have an inverted 

pattern. Additional experiments conducted under natural conditions were performed to 

determine the egg production rate (EPR) of the dominant free-spawning copepod species, as a 

proxy for secondary production. In São Miguel, the EPR showed a decreasing trend along the 

CO2 gradient, with no differences between the exposure times. In Faial, EPR was higher in 

the reference, but it did not differ significantly from the other sites. This study demonstrated 

the suitability of the submarine degassing sites in S. Miguel and Faial Islands for investigating 

the effect of future dissolved CO2 levels in planktonic and pelagic communities of the NE 

Atlantic. It also provided the first in-situ evidence of a significant decrease of EPR of 

copepods under near future CO2 levels. 

Key words: ocean acidification, mesozooplankton, shallow-water CO2 vents, copepods, egg 

production rate.

Resumo 

Desde os tempos pre-industriais que se registou um incremento do CO2 atmosférico, de pelo 

menos 30% devido a atividades humanas, principalmente pelo uso de combustíveis fósseis. 

Os oceanos têm absorvido parte deste CO2 através da sua capacidade de “sumidouro de 

carbono”, induzindo mudanças na composição química da água do mar (acidificação do 

oceano), com potenciais impactos nos organismos marinhos. As possíveis consequências 

ecológicas deste processo têm motivado um incremento no esforço de investigação nos 

últimos anos. A maioria dos efeitos nos organismos marinhos tem sido observada em 

experiências no laboratório, onde o CO2 é manipulado em escalas temporais curtas. Não 

obstante, a necessidade de usar diferentes abordagens, como experiências de campo, em 

ambientes marinhos específicos que contenham comunidades, mais do que espécies isoladas, 

tornou-se evidente. Locais de desgaseificação natural de CO2 em águas pouco profundas têm 

gerado um interesse substancial como laboratórios in situ para estudos de acidificação do 

oceano. Alterações significativas na estrutura da comunidade bentónica têm sido associadas 

com estes locais de desgaseificação, mas os efeitos no plâncton permanecem largamente 

desconhecidos. O presente estudo analisou os efeitos da acidificação do oceano nas 

comunidades de mesozooplâncton. Os objetivos especificos foram (i): o estudo observacional 

sobre as comunidades zooplanctónicas, para determinar se existem diferenças consistentes na 

abundância, diversidade e composição entre os locais afetados por emissões de CO2 e os 

locais de controlo, sem emissões; e (ii) a relação entre os padrões observados no zooplâncton 

em relação aos resultados detetados na química da água do mar e do gás das emissões, (iii) a 

descrição do estado ecofisiológico de grandes grupos de zooplâncton utilizando índices 

derivados dos ácidos nucleicos e índices de produção de ovos e a sua relação com o possível 

stress causado pela acidificação. Para atingir estes objetivos foram seleccionadas duas áreas 

vulcânicas activas, com emanações de CO2 submarinas, uma na ilha de São Miguel e outra na 

ilha de Faial, no arquipélago dos Açores. Cada ilha foi independentemente estudada, através 

da escolha de três lugares diferentes: Reference, Intermediate e Vent, ao longo de um 

gradiente na emissão de CO2, e consequente diminuição de pH. O pH em São Miguel variou 

de 8.06 no Reference (pCO2 383.80 µatm) a 7.75 no Vent (pCO2 983.10 µatm), enquanto que 

no Faial diminuiu de 8.13 no Reference (pCO2 319.37 µatm) a 7.88 no Vent (pCO2 894.08 

µatm). O CO2 foi o principal constituinte das emissões de gás nas duas ilhas (acima de 98%), 

minimizando o efeito de outros gases como H2S. Em São Miguel o mesozooplâncton foi 

amostrado usando arrastos oblíquos com uma rede WP2 de Ø60cm e malhagem de 200 ?m, 



 
 

V 
 

entre os dias 3 e 7 de Julho de 2014, enquanto que no Faial foi usada uma rede com 

malhagem de 500µm e a amostragem foi feita entre os dias 10 e 15 de Julho de 2014. Foram 

descritas as diferenças na abundância, diversidade e estrutura do mesozooplâncton entre 

locais, em paralelo com a caracterização das comunidades nestas áreas, já que a informação 

prévia era escassa. Foram identificados organismos de nove filos, num total de 71 taxa 

diferentes, 45 em  S. Miguel e 61 no Faial. Em São Miguel foram encontradas diferenças 

entre locais na abundância total e nas abundâncias de Arthropoda e Chordata, com um 

incremento no Vent, relativamente ao Intermediate e o Reference. No Faial foram apenas 

encontradas diferenças na diversidade dos Arthropoda. A análise PERMANOVA ilustrou as 

diferenças na composição do zooplâncton entre locais, em São Miguel, e entre datas, no Faial. 

Os principais contribuintes para estas diferenças, realçados pelas anaáises SIMPER, foram 

Evadne spinifera, Paracalanus parvus, nauplios de Cirripedia e Radiozoa. Através das 

análises nMDS, Radiozoa, Paracalanus parvus e Evadne spinifera apareceram mais 

relacionados às condições do Vent, enquanto que nauplios de Cirripedia estiveram mais perto 

das condições do Reference. No Faial, os principais contribuintes foram Bassia bassensis, 

Radiozoa e efiras de Scyphozoa. As condições nesta ilha não permitiram uma separação entre 

locais nas análises nMDS, dado que as fortes correntes misturaram a coluna de àgua, 

dissipando o efeito das emissões de gases, e a variação entre dias é aparentemente mais 

importante e estatisticamente significativa. 

O racio RNA:DNA de populações de mesozooplâncton seleccionadas foi usado como 

indicador da condição fisiológica. O RNA:DNA não mostrou um padrão claro de variação: 

Copepoda em São Miguel e Cladocera no Faial apresentaram valores mais elevados no 

Reference, mas este não diminuiu de forma gradual ao longo do gradiente de CO2. Os ovos de 

peixe parecem ter um padrão invertido. Experiências adicionais foram levados a cabo para 

determinar a taxa de produção de ovos (EPR) das espécies dominantes de copépodes, como 

indicador da produção secundária. As câmaras de incubação foram colocadas perto do fundo 

durante períodos de 24 e 72h em São Miguel, e 72h no Faial. Em São Miguel, a EPR mostrou 

uma tendência de diminuição ao longo do gradiente de CO2, sem diferenças nos tempos de 

exposição. No Faial, EPR foi maior no Reference, mas não diferiu significativamente dos 

outros locais. 

Este estudo demonstrou o potencial das zonas de desgaseificação submarina nas ilhas de S. 

Miguel e Faial para a investigação dos efeitos dos níveis futuros de CO2 dissolvido nas

Introduction

1. Introduction 

1.1.Global change 

Economic growth in the industrial age has brought unprecedented wealth to the planet;  in the 

U.K., the birthplace of the industrial revolution, real GDP per capita has grown by 12 times 

since 1830 (Erickson, 2014). Growth in economic activity has also come at a cost, as 

greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times (IPCC, 2007), 

while CO2 has increased by approximately 30% (Carman et al., 2004). 

Since 1751 approximately 337 billion metric tons of carbon have been released to the 

atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production. Half of these 

emissions have occurred since the mid-1970s. The 2007 global fossil-fuel carbon emission 

estimate, 8365 million metric tons of carbon, represents an all-time high and a 1.7% increase 

from 2006 (Boden et al., 2010). Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further 

warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the 

likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems (IPCC, 

2014). 

Carbon dioxide represents 75% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, followed by CH4, N2O and 

others fluorinated gases (figure 1.1). The human activities responsible for the increased 

emissions include in first place the burning of fossil fuels use and industrial processes and, to 

a lesser extent, changes to land use, including deforestation. 



Introduction

Figure 1.1. Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year) for the 
period 1970 to 2010 by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and 

Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); fluorinated gases covered under the Kyoto 

Protocol (F-gases) (From: ipcc, 2014). 

Measurements of atmospheric CO2 during the last 56 years have revealed a consistent 

increase, from an annual average of 315,24 ppm in 1958 to 365,11 ppm in 2014 

(CO2Now.org, 2014). This current level is also much higher than it has been at any time over 

the course of human civilization (Harrould-Kolieb &amp;amp; Savitz, 2009). In spite of these large 

CO2 sinks, atmospheric CO2 increased at a rate of approximately 3.3 Gt C y
–1

, and thus 

atmospheric CO2 concentrations continued to rise (Carman et al., 2004). A large fraction of 

anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century 

to millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere 

over a sustained period (ipcc, 2014). 

Besides CO2 contribution, methane in second place is a potent greenhouse gas, and oceans 

seem as a supplier of vast quantities to the atmosphere (Ingall, 2008). It has been proposed by 

Karl et al. (2008) that the net efflux of methane from ocean to atmosphere is driven by 

aerobic methane production, fuelled by the microbial use of methylphosphonic acid (MPn) as 

a source of phosphorus in phosphate-stressed waters. During MPn utilization, methane is 

quantitatively released, whereas phosphorous is incorporated into new cell mass (Karl et al., 

2008). Metcalf et al. (2012) identified a phosphonate biosynthetic gene cluster in an abundant

marine archaeon of surface waters, reaffirming the idea of that MPn synthesis is prevalent in 

marine systems. Since nutrients availability in the upper ocean is largely controlled by the 

upwelling from the deep-ocean, and mixing between surface and deep-ocean layers is 

predicted to decrease, it could promote the use by marine microbes of phosphonates (Karl et 

al., 2008) found in the low-molecular-weight fraction of dissolved organic matter (Ingall, 

2008). 

1.2.Ocean acidification 

The oceans cover about 71% of Earth’s surface to an average depth of 3700 m (Pörtner et al., 

2014). They play a vital role in global biogeochemical cycles, contribute enormously to the 

planet’s biodiversity and provide a livelihood for millions of people (Raven et al., 2005). 

Several sources indicate that oceans have the capacity to absorb part of this carbon dioxide, 

acting as a “carbon sink” and thus, moderating the impact of climate change on terrestrial life 

(Harrould-Kolieb &amp;amp; Savitz, 2009). Approximately one-third of the CO2 that has entered the 

atmosphere over the past 100 years has been absorbed into ocean surface waters and has 

resulted in the elevation of partial pressure of CO2 in seawater and reduction of seawater pH 

(Kurihara, 2008). 

Without the oceans playing this role, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 

would be 55% higher (Fabry et al., 2004). Prior to the Industrial Revolution the oceans were 

in relative equilibrium with the atmosphere, absorbing about the same amount of carbon 

dioxide each year as they released (2.15 billion metric tons of CO2) (Harrould-Kolieb &amp;amp; 

Savitz, 2009). However, as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has 

increased, the flux of CO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean has reduced the average pH of 

sea water by about 0.1 pH units over the past century, with the greatest reduction occurring at 

high latitudes (Cramer et al., 2014), equivalent to a ca. 25 % increase in acidity (Havenhand, 

2012). The oceans will continue to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as long as the 

concentration of carbon dioxide in the surface waters is less than that in the atmosphere 

(Harrould-Kolieb &amp;amp; Savitz, 2009). 

The carbon dioxide absorption will result in an unavoidable decreasing of the pH over the 

next several centuries, comparing to any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 

million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as 

bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing (Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2003). It is 

predicted that by 2100 surface ocean pH could fall by 0.3/0.4 units and pCO2 of 750ppm

(Fitzer et al., 2012; Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Havenhand, 2012), and according with the 

IPCC emissions scenarios, if there is an unrestricted burning of fossil fuels, an extreme 

scenario with a reduction of 0.7 units will occur until 24
th

 century (Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2003). 

The acid–base chemistry of the CO2–carbonate system in the sea 

The alkalinity of seawater, which expresses the buffering capacity of water or the capacity of 

the water to neutralize acids, is governed by the minerals dissolved, to which bicarbonates 

contribute largely. The pH is an indication for the acidity of a substance. It is determined by 

the number of free hydrogen ions (H
+
). Thus, the surface waters of the open ocean vary 

between pH 7.9 and 8.3, while coastal waters, in contrast, routinely vary between mean pH 

7.5 and 8.5 dependent on the habitat and show much larger seasonal and diel fluctuations 

(Kerrison, 2011). It is largely a function of the dissociation of dissolved inorganic carbon 

(DIC), whose relative proportions by mass are ?0.5% aqueous CO2, ?89% bicarbonate 

(HCO
3-

), and ?11% carbonate ions (CO3
2-

 ) (Waldbusser &amp;amp; Salisbury, 2014). According to 

Henry’s Law, in a simple aqueous solution we would expect the concentration of CO2 in the 

air to be proportional to that in the solution of carbonic acid (Raven et al, 2005). So changes 

in atmospheric pCO2 will directly affect the carbonate system of the surface ocean, since 

atmosphere and surface ocean exchange CO2 on time scales of several months (Rost et al., 

2008) (figure 1.2).

pCO2 assuming the IS92a Scenario (From: Rost et al, 2008).

A portion of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid 

(H2CO3), and then it can divides in HCO
3-

 (bicarbonate ion) releasing one H
+
 to the solution. 

When the H
+
 content is low, the CO3

 (carbonate ion) increase, while a high H

+
 concentration 

causes a reaction to the carbonate becoming HCO

. Thus, the net effect of the dissolution of 

CO2 in seawater is to alter this equilibrium, increasing the concentrations of H

, H2CO3 and 

HCO

  (figure 1.3).

The term ‘carbonate buffer’ is used to describe how the dissolved inorganic carbon system in 

seawater acts to diminish changes in ocean H
+
 concentration, and thus stabilize pH (Raven et 

al., 2005) (figure 1.4). It occurs first for the CO2 uptake from the atmosphere and second, for 

the interaction of seawater with oceanic sediments composed of CaCO3, which is mainly 

controlled by a “biological pump”. The pump may be defined as the movement of CO2 that 

enters into the ocean from the atmosphere to the deep-ocean floor through biological 

processes, i.e. photosynthetic fixation of CO2 by phytoplankton, passive export of organic 

carbon (e.g. fecal pellets of zooplankton, detritus, and dead organisms) and carbonates (e.g. 

shells and bones) by gravitation, or through vertical migration of zooplankton to the deep 

ocean (Kurihara et al., 2004a).

Figure 1.4. The carbonate system of seawater. CCS (carbon capture and storage) is the excess of CO2 produced 
that is dissolved and stored into the ocean. It will participate dissolving the CaCO3 and altering the carbonates 

equilibrium (From: British Geological Survey). 

The preservation of the organisms in sea floor sediments depends on the solubility of CaCO3 

in seawater and on the concentration of carbonate ions. Thus, there is a critical concentration 

of carbonate ions in seawater (the saturation concentration) below which CaCO3 will start to 

dissolve. Because CaCO3 solubility increases with decreasing temperature and increasing 

pressure, the critical concentration occurs at a depth, the ‘saturation horizon’, below which 

seawater is undersaturated and CaCO3 will tend to dissolve and above which seawater is 

super-saturated and CaCO3 will tend to be preserved. Because the CaCO3 mineral calcite is 

less soluble than the form aragonite, the aragonite saturation horizon is shallower. Because 

added CO2 decreases the carbonate ion concentration, the saturation horizons will become 

shallower with increasing releases of human derived CO2 to the atmosphere (Raven et al., 

2005). It is estimated that highlatitude surface oceans will become undersaturated with respect 

to aragonite by the year 2050, which may lead to the dissolution of aragonite shells (Kurihara, 

2008). 

Consequences for the biota 

While the chemical processes underlying ocean acidification are well understood and 

accepted, we are just beginning to understand the wide-ranging effects acidification is likely 

to have on marine wildlife (Harrould-Kolieb &amp;amp; Savitz, 2009). Given that seawater carbonate 

chemistry can be highly variable, conditions that organisms are actually exposed to are 

difficult to measure Furthermore, the sensitivity of organisms can vary across life history

stages and in conjunction with other stressors (Waldbusser &amp;amp; Salisbury, 2014). The potential 

risks to marine systems from the current period of ocean acidification remain to be quantified; 

as yet, there are few robust indicators of the likely long-term biological consequences (Fitzer 

et al., 2012). Evidence from the geological record shows that previous periods of intense 

ocean acidification, e.g. at the end of the Paleocene, coincided with mass extinction events 

(Jackson, 2010). 

A major consequence of increasing ocean acidity is a reduction in the amount of carbonate 

available (as CO3
2-

) for marine biota. One of the most important uses of carbonate in the 

ocean is the formation of calcium carbonate or limestone structures such as corals skeletons, 

pearls, and the shells of coccolithophores, foraminiferans, pteropods or bivalves, i.e. the 

calcifiers  (Raven et al., 2005; Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2003; Kurihara, 2008; Fabry et al., 2008). 

Calcification is only one physiological parameter affected by the ocean acidification, marine 

organisms can experience physiological stress not directly related to calcification due to an 

increase in CO2 (hypercapnia) and/or a decrease in pH (Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 2009). The life 

cycle stages are differently susceptible, being reproductive and early life-story stages 

considered particularly vulnerable (Fitzer et al., 2012; Kurihara, 2008; Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 

2009). Even if increased acidity may not directly kill non-calcifying organisms, many are 

likely to be harmed in ways that reduce their overall fitness and ability to survive. These 

impacts could include decreased growth rate, reduced reproduction, disrupted respiratory and 

nervous system function and increased susceptibility to predators and disease, all of which 

could produce ripple effects through food webs and ecosystems. Ultimately, ocean 

acidification could transform the oceans, leaving them far less diverse and productive and 

making the lives and livelihoods of those who depend on them far more uncertain (Harrould-

Kolieb &amp;amp; Savitz, 2009). 

Most biota reside near the surface, where the greatest pH change would be expected to occur, 

but deep-ocean biota may be more sensitive to pH changes (Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2003), since 

CaCO3 is abundant in sediments, so the pH of the deep oceans cannot change by large 

amounts over timescales of 10000 years (Raven et al., 2005). However, another view has to 

be considered, organisms adapted to warm environments appear to be closer to thermal 

thresholds than cold-adapted organisms are, and plasticity in physiology may be costly to 

other functions, such as reproduction (Waldbusser &amp;amp; Salisbury, 2014). Further, extreme 

temperature events are principal drivers of biogeographic redistribution (Wethey et al., 2011).

Consequences for zooplankton 

Zooplankton is a key component of aquatic communities, and knowledge of how they cope 

with environmental stressors is important for understanding how the aquatic ecosystem as a 

whole will respond (Chan et al., 2008). The holozooplanktonic CaCO3 producers are the 

foraminifera (shells of calcite), euthecosomatous pteropods (shells of aragonite), heteropods 

(tropical and subtropical oceans, shells of aragonite not always present) and gymnosomes 

(shells of aragonite cast off at metamorphosis) (Fabry et al., 2008), so it is expected that these 

groups will be affected under acidification conditions by reducing calcification. 

Responses can be variable ranging from negative to neutral or even positive and appear to be 

species-specific even in closely related species (Troedsson et al., 2013). Broadcast spawning 

invertebrates are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification because fertilization of eggs 

and sperm occurs in the water column followed by development of larvae. Lecithotrophic 

larvae (10% of marine benthic invertebrates), may be better competitors and less affected 

since they spend less time in plankton, than planktotrophic larvae (60–90% of marine 

organisms) which feed on exogenous sources. Any sub-lethal reductions in rate of 

development and larval size may also have significant consequences for the survival of 

marine larvae because prolonged larval life phase and delayed settlement may lead to a 

concomitant increase in the likelihood of predation (Ross et al., 2011). Larvae of benthic 

calcified organisms will respond with a reduction in calcification rate. 

At date, most studies about how ocean acidification can influence the zooplankton community 

are short-term assays under controlled conditions focused in very restricted groups. These are 

not always relevant to predicted climate impacts on ecosystems (e.g. using unrealistic pH 

values and/or acid-based acidification without correcting carbonates and bicarbonates) or 

ecologically realistic (e.g. single species cultures) conditions (Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 2009). 

Since copepods are the main component in marine zooplankton, the most abundant species in 

each region should be the targets to elucidate responses to CO2 changes. 

Planktonic copepods typically account for about 55–95% of the biomass in pelagic 

zooplankton community and are the dominant herbivores (Longhurst, 1985). While 

heterotrophic protists in the microbial loop are considered to be the main consumers and 

recyclers of smaller plankton, copepods mainly transfer carbon captured at lower trophic 

levels to higher trophic levels (Troedsson et al., 2013). The timing and the intensity of 

copepod reproduction is considered to be essential for survival of fish larvae, since they feed

largely on copepod eggs or nauplii during their early feeding stage. Furthermore, several 

pelagic fish stocks feed on copepods during their entire lifetime, and their individual growth 

as well as stock production is highly affected by copepod availability (Debes et al., 2008). 

Many studies, mostly under controlled conditions, manifest the effects of seawater 

acidification in different aspects of survival of copepods (annex 7.1). Most of these studies 

conducted until date showed no responses in copepods or low only when high CO2 

concentrations are applied. In addition, the effects of elevated pCO2 on the survival rates of 

copepods are highly species-specific. Negative responses are more related to early-life stages 

of copepods i.e. eggs and nauplii production and survival. As example, Calanus finmarchicus 

survival and early development is not affected by pCO2 levels ?2000 ppm, only changes at 

more than 7000ppm are observables (Pedersen et al., 2013). As in others organisms, these 

effects can be studied at many levels, as was shown in the previous section. Li and Gao 

(2012) hypothesized that the increased partial pressure of CO2 and acidity of seawater may 

affect the respiration of copepods to cope with the chemical changes, and hence it would 

mediate their feeding rate to meet the energy demand. Centropages tenuiremis, the dominant 

costal water calanoid copepod in South China Sea, was able to perceive the chemical changes 

in seawater (&gt;1700 µatm, pH &amp;lt;7.60) with avoidance strategy. The respiration increased at 

elevated CO2 (1000 µatm) and associated acidity (pH 7.83) and its feeding rates also 

increased correspondingly, except for the initial acclimating period, when it fed less. 

The naupliar production has been a common way to determine the reproductive response on 

copepods. Different assays under different controlled pH conditions have been carried out. 

The naupliar production of Tisbe battagliai (Guernsey, UK) increased significantly at pH 7.95 

compared with pH 8.06 followed by a decline at pH 7.82, attributed to an initial stress 

response which was succeeded by a hormesis-like response at pH 7.67 (Fitzer et al., 2012). 

Further, there was a significant growth reduction and a significant increase in the proportion 

of carbon relative to oxygen within the cuticle as seawater pH decreased. This strongly 

suggests that copepods preferentially reallocate resources towards maintaining reproductive 

output at the expense of somatic growth and cuticle composition. These responses may drive 

shifts in life history strategies that favour smaller brood sizes, females and perhaps later 

maturing females, with the potential to profoundly destabilise marine trophodynamics (Fitzer 

et al., 2012). In contrast, the nauplii of Tigriopus japonicas, a common benthic copepod in 

coastal areas of the temperate zone of Japan, show a high tolerance to elevated pCO2 

environments (37,000 µatm) (Kita et al., 2013). Cripps et al (2014) affirm in their recent 



Introduction

study that nauplii show the highest lethal effects of CO2; Acartia tonsa nauplii mortality rates 

increased threefold when pCO2 concentrations reached 1000 µatm (year 2100 scenario) with 

lethal concentration 50 at 1084 µatm pCO2. In comparison, eggs, early copepodite stages, and 

adult males and females were not affected lethally until pCO2 concentrations ?3000 µatm. 

The egg production rate of Acartia spinicauda, Calanus sinicus and Centropages tenuiremis 

(the dominant copepods in the southern coast of China) is significantly inhibited by the 

increased pCO2 and the exposure time duration (6.92?pH?7.39), while Acartia pacifica only 

show inhibition with the exposure time duration (Zhang et al., 2011). Calanus glacialis egg 

production (an Arctic shelf-water copepod) showed no effects under CO2-induced seawater 

acidification. However, a reduction in pH to 6.9 significantly delayed hatching and possibly 

reduced overall hatching success (Weidmann et al., 2012). 

Acartia steueri and Acartia erythraea (Japan) showed sensitivity when cultured under 

increses pCO2 of +10000ppm (pH 6.8) relative to control. The egg production rates of 

copepods decreased significantly. In addition, the nauplius mortality rate increased in A. 

erythraea. The survival rates of adult of A. steueri were not affected when reared under 

increased CO2 for 8 days, however longer exposure times could have revealed toxic effects of 

elevated CO2 concentrations (Kurihara et al., 2004b). These CO2 values are too large, since 

they do not reflect an expected change in the near future. It reflects the results of one of the 

strategies proposed to reduce anthropogenic CO2, i.e. the direct injection of anthropogenic 

CO2 into the deep ocean. The local CO2 concentration is expected to be as high as 20,000 

ppm and the pH below 5.8, what is expected to affect the water column; thus the effects on 

zooplankton and bacteria are of primary concern (Kurihara et al., 2004a). 

Acartia clausi (Mediterranean sea) under the realistic predicted values two of pH 7.83 and 

temperature 20°C (+4ºC) exhibited egg production rate and hatching success decreased 

significantly over the duration of exposure at future pH under actual and future temperature 

conditions (Zervoudaki et al., 2013). Acidification does not have an obvious direct effect on 

the vital rates of the copepod, with the exception of excretion possibly. Therefore, the 

combination of acidification, ambient oligotrophic conditions and warming could affect the 

ability of the species to allocate resources for coping with multiple stressors.

1.3.A different challenge for the marine zooplankton 

Natural CO2 vents have generated a substantial interest in recent years as in situ laboratories 

for acidification studies. Field experiments, at sites with naturally-elevated CO2 conditions, 

are potentially useful analogues for investigating the effect of future dissolved CO2 levels on 

marine organisms and ecosystems (Calosi et al., 2013, Kerrison et al., 2011). Some marine 

CO2 vents are at ambient seawater temperature and lack toxic sulphur compounds; such vents 

can prevail for years to millennia and may be used to advance our understanding (Hall-

Spencer et al., 2008). This opens a new door of opportunities at many levels, leaving behind 

mono-species studies under so restricted conditions for the zooplankton community, where 

the interactions within and between species and with the environment cannot be addressed. 

The existence of shallow water submarine volcanic ventis is well known off volcanic islands 

and provinces (Cardigos et al., 2005), occurring over a wide depth range, from the intertidal 

to the abyss. The deepest active hot vent known so far with associated fauna is the Ashadze 

field located at 4000–4100 m depth at 12858V N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Tarasov et al., 

2005). Within submersed CO2 vents, it is important to distinguish between deep-sea 

hydrothermal vents and shallow-water vents. At deep-sea hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean 

ridges there is usually a high biomass of largely endemic, but species poor, fauna that depends 

on chemosynthesis-based production. By contrast, at less than 200 m depth, shallow-water 

vents tend to have a low biomass of a more diverse fauna with few, or no, endemic species 

(Cardigos et al., 2005). In addition, shallow water hydrothermal ecosystems are in the 

euphotic zone, i.e. there is primary production. Biological data have been published for 

approximately 55 deep-water and 21 shallow-water hydrothermal vent ecosystems (Tarasov et 

al., 2005) (figure 1.5).

California, 15.Punta Banda and Punta Mita, Baja California (From: Tarasov et al., 2005). 

Any study performed in these environments requires a previous description of the physical-

chemical characteristics of the vent site, to stablish properly the perimeter with high CO2 

emissions and where its activity ceases. Daily-variations can appear around the main points 

(Kerrison et al., 2011) as well as other gases and sulfides. Accordingly, analyses of gas 

composition, temperature, salinity and alkalinity acquire special relevance. 

Previous studies on shallow-water vents consider a great diversity of groups, as bacteria 

(Cardigos et al., 2005; Brinkhoff et al., 1999, Kerfahi et al., 2014), benthic invertebrates 

(Cardigos et al., 2005; Calosi et al., 2013; Hall-Spencer et al., 2008; Gamenick et al., 1998; 

Pettit et al., 2013), algae (Cardigos et al., 2005; Hall-Spencer et al., 2008), fishes (Cardigos et 

al., 2005) or seagrass (Hall-Spencer et al., 2008; Arnold et al., 2012), but only a recent study 

in the coast of Normanby Island (Papua New Guinea) take in count these environments to 

study possible effects on zooplankton communities. Smith et al. (2014) show that 

zooplankton abundance appears severely reduced in low pH waters compared to control sites. 

As result of night samplings, zooplankton abundance appeared highest and the difference 

between pH sites was greater. Additionally, certain taxonomic groups were also reduced in

abundance in low pH waters. These results indicate that CO2 vents are optimal tools to 

manifest acidification effects on these communities, and similar studies in others regions of 

the world with implications to the trophic web assessments are of priority concern. 

1.4.Determining physiological status: RNA:DNA ratio 

Stablish how environmental stressors affect marine organisms through determining its 

physiological state has been among of the main aims of several studies. Within this 

framework, nucleic acid derived indices have been applied with success in microbial 

communities, invertebrates and fishes (Chícharo &amp;amp; Chícharo, 2008), and RNA:DNA ratio 

(R:D) has particularly excelled. 

The technique is based in the changes produced over the cellular concentration of RNA, 

which is highly dependent on growth rate, and indirectly on environmental conditions. On an 

individual basis, DNA per somatic cell is assumed to be constant in sexually mature adults so 

that the R:D ratio can be related to the magnitude of RNA transcription, protein synthesis and 

hence growth condition (Pommier et al., 2012). It was firstly proposed by Sutcliffe (1965), 

followed by Holm-Hansen et al. (1968), who suggest that the concentration of DNA would be 

a good measure of living carbon in phytoplankton. 

Temperature is the dominant factor influencing copepod growth under adequate food 

supplies; conversely, when the temperature range is narrow, food becomes the predominant 

determining factor for growth (Chícharo &amp;amp; Chícharo, 2008). Nevertheless,  R:D interpretation 

is not always simple and direct. High R:D has been attributed in copepods to some type of 

stress that led to produce proteins to cope with stress-induced denaturation of other proteins 

(Vehma et al., 2012) and Pommier et al. (2012) found that the R:D of copepods was not 

correlated with DNA concentration, which suggested a spatial variability likely related to 

variable growth conditions of the copepod population. R:D has not been considered a good 

indicator of somatic growth, since DNA is growth-dependent and there are confounding 

factors related to the moult process; after a phase of hyperplasia (DNA proliferation) a phase 

of hypertrophy (protein assimilation) follows and hence the coupling of both processes 

depends on the moulting rate (Yebra et al., 2011). For this reason, R:D appear as a good 

indicator of nutritional condition only in adult individuals. 

This variability in the results suggests that even if R:D is a great methodology to assess 

physiological state of the organisms, results have to be considered with precaution.

1.5.Aims 

The present study is part of the project MOFETA (MOFETA - EXPL/MAR-EST/0604/2013), 

which general objective is investigating the ecological effects of ocean acidification in 

shallow water volcanic CO2 vents of the Azores. This multidisciplinary project is structured 

around the following objectives: 1. composition and quantification of the gases emitted in the 

submarine vents; 2. spatial variability of physical-chemical characteristics of seawater; 3. 

observational study on planktonic assemblages; 4. observational study on macrobenthic 

assemblages; and 5. short-term manipulative field experiments with copepod assemblages. 

Only the tasks related to zooplankton (3 and 5) will be developed here as follow:  

1. Observational study on zooplanktonic assemblages 

Determine if there are consistent differences in the abundance, diversity and composition of 

zooplankton assemblages between sites affected by CO2 emissions and control sites, without 

emissions. 

Relate the observed patterns in zooplankton assemblages in relation to the results of seawater 

chemistry and gas emissions. 

Describe biochemical condition of major zooplanktonic groups using nucleic acids (growth 

and biomass indicators) and relate their ecophysiological status (RNA:DNA ratio) to possible 

stress caused by CO2. 

2. Short-term manipulative field experiments with copepod assemblages 

Compare the Egg Production Rates (EPR) of the most abundant copepod free-spawning 

species between sites affected by CO2 emissions and control sites, without emissions, to 

assess the possible effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the EPR.

2. Methodology 

2.1.Study site 

The study was conducted in the Azores archipelago, composed of nine volcanic islands 

localized in the mid-Atlantic ridge. Two active volcanic areas with submarine CO2 emissions, 

one in the island of São Miguel and one in the island of Faial, were chosen for the purpose of 

this study (figure 2.1). São Miguel and Faial were selected within the archipelago because of 

the previous knowledge about the existence of submersed shallow-water CO2 vents in two 

specific locations of these islands. Three sampling sites were selected within each island, two 

locations along the gradient of CO2 emissions (Intermediate and Vent) and one Reference site, 

with similar characteristics, but no degassing. Test dives and pH measurements with a CTD 

equipped with a pH probe (YSI6600) were the bases to select the Vent site (were the 

emissions were stronger) and two subsequent locations (Reference site and Intermediate 

gradient site) at a reasonable distance and with similar bottom geology and depth conditions. 

 
Figure 2.1. Sampling locations in the islands of Faial (A - Ponta da Espalamaca) and São Miguel (B - Ribeira 
Quente). 

In São Miguel the Vent site (Ponta da Lobeira) was located in the south coast, close to the 

village of Ribeira Quente, in the flank of Furnas Volcano, between the Reference at Garajau 

and Intermediate site at Covões (figure 2.2). In Faial, the sampling sites were located in the

southeast of the Island; the Reference site at the exit of the Horta port, while the Vent and 

Intermediate sites were in front of Ponta da Espalamaca (figure 2.3). Conditions between both 

islands were very different, with the maximum depth of 10 meters at São Miguel, while at 

Faial it was 37 meters. Given their proximity to the Faial-Pico channel, the sites in Faial were 

strongly exposed to tidal currents. The “vent sites” in both islands also differed in terms of 

their geological characteristics, since some of the emissions in São Miguel were warm while 

in Faial they were always cold. According to these characteristic they can been denominated 

as hot vents and cold seeps (Tarasov et al., 2005).

2.2.Seawater chemistry and gas composition 

On each day of the sampling campaign, the physicochemical characteristics of the seawater 

(temperature, salinity and pH) were measured in situ, using a YSI6000 multiprobe. In addition 

to the in situ measurements, three water samples were collected at the surface (0-2m) and near 

the bottom (6-10m in São Miguel and 15-38m in Faial) each site to be analyzed in the 

laboratory and obtain the seawater carbonate chemistry variables. pH was measured in the 

laboratory using a glass electrode (WTW, pH 340i) calibrated with a TRIS seawater buffer. 

Total alkalinity was obtained through potentiometric titration, following Dickson et al. 

(2003), and using a Metrohm Titrino Plus 848 equipped with a 869 Compact Sample 

Changer, and calibrated with certified Reference material supplied by A. Dickson. Seawater 

samples were filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane and measured within 48h. 

Gas sampling was done in three patches of CO2 flow in each venting site (Ribeira Quente and 

Ponta da Espalamaca), using Giggenbach bottles (bottles filled with NaOH 4N and under 

vaccum). Thus, acid gases dissolve in the basic solution and the more inert gases (non 

absorbed) remain in the headspace of the bottle. Then, samples were analyzed in the 

laboratories of CVARG (Centro de Vulcanologia e Avaliação de Riscos Geológicos, 



Methodology  

18 
 

University of Azores) through gas chromatography, potentiometric titration and colorimetric 

titration techniques. Three replicates were collected in each area. 

2.3.Zooplankton assemblages 

Mesozooplankton was sampled using oblique tows with a WP2 net Ø60cm and 200 ?m mesh, 

equipped with a flow meter to determining the amount of water passing through the plankton 

net, during 10 minutes and at approximately 2 knots. Five tows were effectuated at São 

Miguel at each station between days 3 and 7 of July, 2014. In Faial, a net with 500µm mesh 

was used instead of the 200µm mesh used in São Miguel, since during the first sampling, the 

smaller one was lost. Three tows in each station of Faial were conducted between days 10 and 

15 of July, 2014. Immediately after sampling, mesozooplankton was preserved in 4% borax 

buffered formaldehyde. Another oblique tow with the same procedure was effectuated at each 

location to preserve mesozooplankton partially in RNA later for biochemical determinations 

(RNA:DNA ratio) and partially was kept alive for manipulative experiments (egg production 

rates). These tows were conducted with a modified cod end, without a mesh in order to collect 

the organisms without much damage. 

The total biovolume of each sample was determined by the method of displacement volume. 

Sub-samples were obtained using a Folsom splitter and 300-500 organisms per sample were 

counted and identified under a binocular microscope. The level of taxonomic resolution was 

different among phyla. Inside Arthropoda, all organisms found in the samples belong to the 

subphylum Crustacea, and resolution was higher than in the others phyla. Different life stages 

of Cirripedia (cyprid and nauplii), Copepoda (Nauplii), Euphausiacea (caliptopis, furcilia and 

nauplii), fish (eggs and larvae) and Coleoidea (eggs and larvae) were considered as different 

taxa for every analysis. Pelagia noctiluca, despite not to be quantified and included in the 

analysis since the sampling was not directed at these organisms which do not belong to 

mesozooplankton, appeared in some tows on the venting sites of São Miguel and Faial. 

A different approach was considered for a better description of the community and 

comparison with other areas. As described in other studies (Shi et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2010), 

classification of zooplankton functional groups can be based on the size of the zooplankton, 

food preferences, trophic functionality, interactions between one another or relationships with 

higher trophic levels. In this study, it was considered to separate Crustacean according with its 

size (small, big and giant crustacean) since it was a dominant group in terms of abundance in 

São Miguel. Cnidaria, Mollusca, fish, Radiozoa e Tunicata were differentiated as independent

functional groups, while Annelida, Chaetognatha, Echinodermata and Foraminifera were 

pooled as “Others” since its abundance was too low in both islands. 

2.4.RNA:DNA ratio 

The most abundant and well preserved taxa were used for the RNA:DNA analysis in each site 

of both São Miguel and Faial islands. Nucleic acids were obtained using a method based in 

the microplate fluorescent assay (MFA) of Ikeda et al. (2007), which is a modification of the 

sequential fluorometric method of Bentle et al. (1981). Bentle et al. (1981) method is based 

on the use of an ethidium bromide fluorometric technique, where the nucleic acids are 

sequentially degraded by nucleases (RNase and DNase). Wagner et al. (1998) modified the 

sequential fluorometric method to the MFA with 96-well microtiter plates by adopting a 

sarcosyl extraction technique and eliminating the DNase step, allowing the measurement of 

nucleic acids of several samples at the same time. 

Prior to the assay, a batch of 3 to 30 organisms were sorted depending on the taxa. 

Zooplankton organisms were homogenized by sonication (3 pulses 50 A during 1 min) with 

cold sarcosyl extraction buffer. The volume of extraction buffer was between 100 and 200 ?l 

(0.5%). Then all samples were shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature using a vortex 

mixer equipped with a multiple-vial head. Afterwards, they were centrifuged (12 000 r.p.m, 0-

4ºC) for 15 min to sediment any organism remain particle. The samples were diluted 1:10 

with Tris buffer to reduce the sarcosyl concentration to 0.05%.  In each run, duplicate 20-40

RNA standard solutions (16s-23s E. coli 4 µg µl

 from Roche) were transferred to Nunclon 

96-well, black, round-bottom microplates. The ratio of DNA and RNA slopes was 8, which 

can be used to compare RNA/DNA ratio results determined by other protocols (Caldarone et 

al., 2006). Gel Red solution (15 ?l) was added to each well, and the plates were shaken gently 

at room temperature. The fluorescence was then scanned after addition of the fluorescent dye 

on a microplate reader (Biotek synergy HT model SIAFRTD) with 360 nm (excitation) and 

590 nm (emission) (first scan- total fluorescence RNA and DNA). Following the first scan, 

RNase solution (15 ?l, 0.12 µg ml-1) was added to each well and incubated at 37ºC for 30 

minutes. The concentration of DNA was calculated directly by the standard curve. The 

concentration of RNA was determined indirectly by subtraction of DNA fluorescence (second 

scan) from total fluorescence (first scan). The fluorescent dye used was Gel red solution. 



Methodology  

20 
 

Many protocols based upon this methodology used ethidium bromide (EB), which exhibits 

fluorescence when bound to nucleic acids (which gives the total nucleic acid concentration in 

one reading). However in recent years EB has been largely replaced with alternatives like Gel 

Red, which are safer to use and exhibit the desired fluorescence when exposed to nucleic 

acids. 

2.5.Copepod Egg Production Rates (EPR) 

Oblique tows, as described above were effectuated, but using a modified cod end, without 

mesh, in order to minimize damage to the organisms. As fast as was possible, the collected 

material was introduced in the incubation chambers for that location (figure 2.4), and placed 

by divers 1 m above the sea bottom.A total of 18 chambers were placed at each Island, and the 

time of incubation in São Miguel lasted 24h (3 replicates per site) and 72h (3 replicates per 

site) while in Faial the six replicates per site were incubated for 72h. When removed, the 

content was preserved in lugol. Each PVC chamber had 38cm high and 10cm of diameter, 

divided inside with a 500µm mesh in a superior part with 30cm and an inferior part with 8cm, 

in order to allow eggs fall down to avoid predation. Around the chambers there was a mesh 

with 50 ?m, to maintain the eggs inside but allow exchange of seawater and smaller food 

particles. For determining the Egg Production Rates (EPR) of copepods, eggs and nauplii 

were considered over the total adult females. In São Miguel all individuals inside the 

chambers were identified as Paracalanus sp. and Clausocalanus sp., while in Faial calanoids 

as Centropages sp. and other harpacticoids species were identified.

2.6.Data analyses 

Patterns of variation in zooplanktonic assemblage structure along the CO2 gradient in each 

island were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. Each Island (São Miguel and Faial) 



Methodology  

21 
 

was considered independently, and two orthogonal factors were considered in the analyses: 

Site was considered a fixed factor with three levels corresponding to areas with different 

volcanic CO2 emissions (Intermediate and Vent) and control areas, without emissions 

(Reference); Date was considered a random factor with 5 levels in São Miguel and 3 in Faial. 

Statistical differences among assemblages were tested using Permutational multivariate 

analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on Bray-Curtis similarities with untransformed 

abundances. The similarity percentages routine (SIMPER) was used to examine the 

contribution of each taxon to average dissimilarities between sample groups. Ordination by 

non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) was used to visualize patterns in the biological 

dataset. 

Abundance (N), nº of taxa (S) and diversity (d) were calculated for the entire assemblage and 

for the dominant phyla using RStudio version 3.1.2. (R Core Team, 2013), while eveness (J´) 

was obtained with the DIVERSE routine on the PRIMER 6 statistical (PRIMER- E. Plymouth 

Marine Laboratory). Abundances and relative abundances of functional groups were as well 

calculated using RStudio. Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for 

statistical differences in the taxa highlighted by the SIMPER routine, abundances, nº of taxa, 

diversity indices, secondary production (egg production rate) and biovolume of samples. 

Differences between means have been considered statistically significant for p&amp;lt;0.05. 

Homogeneity of variances was previously tested with the Bartlett test, and pair-wise tests for 

group means were done a posteriori on significant effects. Statistical analyses and data 

representation were done using RStudio.

3.1.Seawater chemistry and gas composition 

pH varied along the water column according with figure 3.1. In São Miguel, pH decreased 

under 7.0 in the Vent site near to the bottom and in the surface, while in the Intermediate and 

Reference sites, lowest values appeared nearest to the surface, about 7.6 and 8.0 respectively. 

In Faial, pH varied similarly in Vent and Intermediate sites, being under 7.0 in the bottom, 

while in the Reference it oscillated from 7.85 to 8.15 along the water column. The water 

column in São Miguel varied from 10 m in the Reference and Intermediate sites to 7m in the 

Vent, while in Faial it was almost 40 m in the Intermediate and Vent, and 30 m in the 

Reference site.

Figure 3.2 shows the pH and temperature values frequency in São Miguel (11a-b) and Faial 

(11c-d). In both islands, highest values of pH were constant through the three sites, while 

lowest values appeared only in the venting site, and Intermediate was between both. 

Temperature scarcely varied. In São Miguel, lowest values increased from Reference to Vent, 

while in Faial this variation was not constant.

interquartile range. 

Seawater carbonate chemistry variables (daily means) for each of the three sites sampled in 

both São Miguel and Faial are summarized in tables 3.1 and 3.2. The water column was 

sampled at the surface (0-2m) and bottom (10m in São Miguel and 38m in Faial). In São 

Miguel island, temperature and salinity did not vary significantly from bottom to surface and 

among sites (19.79 to 20.67ºC, 36.78 to 36.92ppt), only minimum temperature in the bottom 

increased minimally from Reference to Vent. pH decreased gradually from the Reference to 

the Vent site in the surface, while in the bottom, the Intermediate value did not follow this 

pattern. In Faial, salinity only increased in the surface 0.21 ppt from the Reference to the 

Vent, and temperature did not vary between sites; there were some grades of difference from 

bottom to surface due to a thermocline (ref-1.53ºC, int-1.4ºC, vnt-2.39ºC). Measurements of 

pH in table 3.2 show no variation in the pH at the surface, while at the bottom it dropped from

(figure 3.3), with significantly greater abundance in the venting site, relative to the 

Intermediate and Reference sites (F value=17.81, p=0.0003). Significant differences among 

sites were also observed in the abundance of Chordata (F value=9.98, p=0.003) and in the 

total abundance (F value=22.94, p=0), when considering all taxa (annex 7.6).

Patterns in terms of nº of taxa (S), diversity (H) and eveness (J´) among sites were analyzed 

(annexes 7.5 and 7.6). When all taxa were considered, all these indices varied inversely to the 

CO2 gradient, although no significant differences were observed for particular phyla or the 

total. 

Radiozoa dominated the assemblages in all sites of Faial, and in contrast with S. Miguel, the 

smallest values of total abundance were found in the Vent site (figure 3.4). No significant 

differences were found in the abundance of particular phyla or the total taxa (annex 7.7).

Figure 3.4. Abundances per zooplankton phylum (ind/m

Reference, Int-Intermediate, Vnt-Vent). 

In general, there were not significant differences in the nº of taxa, diversity and eveness 

patterns analyzed among sites of Faial. The only exception was the diversity of Arthropoda (F 

value=8.35, p=0.02) (annex 7.7). It decreased along the CO2 gradient (annex 7.5). 

According with the zooplankton functional groups approach, the abundances distribution 

among sites is represented in annex 7.3 and relative abundance of each group is in annex 7.4. 

In São Miguel, small crustacean dominate over big and giant crustacean, being representative 

of the community (Reference-86.07%, Intermediate-86.49%, Vent-82.20%). In Faial, the 

distribution of relative abundances among groups is more balanced. The most abundance 

group is Radiozoa (Reference-69.33%, Intermediate-62.10%, Vent-53.47%), while Cnidaria 

has a good representation compared to São Miguel (Reference-11.56%, Intermediate-15.04%, 

Vent-15.08%). ANOVA analyses on the abundances of functional groups showed significant 

differences among sites for small crustacean (F value=16.4, p=0.00037) and Tunicata (F 

value=10.47, p=0.00233) in São Miguel only. 

PERMANOVA on São Miguel data showed that composition of the zooplanktonic 

assemblages differed significantly between the three sites considered, while the differences 

among sampling days were not significant (Table 3.4).

Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (nMDS-Bray-Curtis similarities) analyses was done to 

illustrate the distribution of the main species highlighted by the SIMPER routine. The main 

contributors (&gt;5%) to the differences among sites were the cladoceran Evadne spinifera 

(37.90% Ref-Int, 50.23% Ref-Vnt, 44.25% Int-Vnt), the calanoid copepod Paracalanus 

parvus (30.83% Ref-Int, 22.93% Ref-Vnt, 29.66% Int-Vnt), Cirripedia nauplii (7.92% Ref-

Int) and Radiozoa (10.22% Ref-Vnt, 10.22% Int-Vnt). The nMDS (figure 3.5) shows the 

distribution of the samples sites and data. Dimension 1 on the nMDS separated the samples of 

the Vent site from the Reference and Intermediate sites, with the exception of one sample of 

Reference and Vent collected on July 7. Dimension 2 divided the Reference and Intermediate 

samples, except for a samples collected on July 5 in the Intermediate site. Sample on July 3 in 

the Reference appears in the limit of dimension 2. Radiozoa, Paracalanus parvus and Evadne 

spinifera seem more related to Vent conditions, while Cirripedia nauplii is closer to the 

Reference conditions.

Univariate analysis of variance for the abundance of the species highlighted by the SIMPER 

routine showed significant differences in the abundance of Evadne spinifera among sites (F 

value=7.562, p=0.0075), while for P. parvus, Cirripedia nauplii and Radiozoa there were not 

significant differences in their abundance (annex 7.8). 

PERMANOVA was done on Faial data, showing that composition of the zooplanktonic 

assemblages did not differ between sites, but it was significant among sampling days (Table 

3.5).

Dimension 2 on the nMDS separated samplings on 15 July from samplings on 14 July, while 

12 July appears in the left side of dimension 1, and in both sides of dimension 2. No

July, while Radiozoa and Scyphozoa ephyra are more related to 12 July and 15 July 

respectively.

No significant differences were found in the univariate analysis of variance for the abundance 

of the species highlighted by the SIMPER routine (annex 7.8). 

In both islands, the biovolume of zooplankton samples was generally smaller in the Reference 

site, relative to the sites with CO2 degassing (figure 3.7). Nevertheless, this pattern was not 

significant (F value=0.19, p=0.83 in S.Miguel; F value=0.44, p=0.67 in Faial), as illustrated in

In São Miguel, only copepods and fish eggs were analyzed independently from other groups, 

while the rest of organisms were pooled. The RNA:DNA values in São Miguel ranged from 

0.02 to 2.98, with no consistent pattern of variation among sites or groups of organisms 

(figure 3.8). The RNA:DNA ratio of fish eggs consistently showed larger values in sites 

affected by CO2 relative to Controls, while copepods copepods showed the opposite trend and 

no pattern was discernible for other groups. In Faial, the RNA:DNA ratio of fish eggs 

consistently increased along the CO2 gradient and cladocerans showed a similar pattern to 

copepods in São Miguel, while other groups showed no clear trend.

3.4.Copepod Egg Production Rates (EPR) 

For determining the Egg Production Rates (EPR) of copepods, eggs and nauplii were 

considered over the total adult females. All individuals inside the chambers were identified as 

Paracalanus sp. and Clausocalanus sp. in São Miguel, and calanoids as Centropages sp. and 

others harpacticoids species in Faial. 

In São Miguel, the EPR showed a decreasing trend along the CO2 gradient (figure 3.9), with 

significant differences among sites (F value=4.45, p=0.0384) (table 3.7). The effect of 

exposure time (24 or 72h) was also tested in S. Miguel, with no differences in the egg 

production rate (F value=0.6176, p=0.6176) (table 3.7).

4. Discussion 

4.1.Seawater chemistry and gas composition 

Carbon dioxide was the dominant gas in the submarine degassing areas of Espalamaca (Faial) 

and Ponta da Lobeira (S. Miguel) with values consistently exceeding 98%. The low 

concentrations of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) entails an additional advantage 

to the, since they would be confounding factors in the interpretation of the results. 

Accordingly, from the perspective of the composition of gas emissions, both these sites can be 

considered suitable for long-term studies on the effects of ocean acidification. 

São Miguel and Faial where the two islands considered in our study as clear example of 

response to ocean acidification, but despite of their proximity, differences in their physical 

characteristics prevented the direct comparison of the zooplankton communities found in 

them. Even more important, their comparison in this study was not possible due to mesh size 

of the nets used in the sampling (200 µm in S. Miguel and 500 µm in Faial). 

In São Miguel island, salinity did not vary among sites and the small increase in bottom 

temperature from Reference to Vent is probably due to the smaller deep in the Vent site 

(figures 10 and 11). Thus, main differences between sites are due to changes in CO2 and pH 

levels. Punctual measurements in table 3.1 generally show higher values of CO2 near the 

bottom, relative to the surface and this trend is more pronounced at the Vent site.  As showed 

in figure 1.2, actual values of CO2 pressure at the ocean surface are estimated in 380 µatm. In 

São Miguel, 388.67 µatm was considered the Reference value since there was no bubbling 

where it was measured. It increases to 483.37 in the Intermediate and to 983.10 in the Vent, 

showing a gradient within the range of the Representative Concentration Pathways in the 

latest IPCC assessment report (AR5), varying between 421 (RCP2.6) and 936 (RCP8.5) ppm 

CO2. Accordingly results at the Vent site should be considered as representatives of the more 

extreme scenario at the end of this century. This corresponded to pH decrease from 8.06 to 

7.75 (0.31 units), which is also within the range predicted by 2100 (0.3/0.4 units) (Fitzer et 

al., 2012; Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Havenhand, 2012). 

The CO2 is bubbled from the bottom and dissolved in the waters around the venting sites and 

probably expelled to the air, resulting in chemical changes that are within a range expected 

according to current projections of future atmospheric CO2 levels. The pH values observed at 

the Vent site are definitively more realistic than those used in some of the previous 



Discussion 

37 
 

manipulative experiments carried out in controlled conditions (annex 7.1). As presented in 

figure 3.2, median and minimum values of pH decrease to the Vent site, but higher values are 

represented in the three sites. pH values are vertically distributed along the water column 

(figure 3.1), with the lower values being generally observed in the surface, except at the Vent 

site where very low values were also observed near the bottom. This suggests a natural 

gradient could exist if CO2 is bubbled and concentrated in the surface before to be released to 

the atmosphere where the concentration is generally lower. In fact, pCO2 is greatest at the 

surface in all sites, however, most of the pH measurements were done near the bottom or at 

the surface, which may have biased the results for the Intermediate levels of the water 

column, which were less represented. 

Faial shows totally different characteristics from São Miguel. The water column goes to 38m 

and the strong currents between Faial and Pico islands (figure 2.1) make the selected areas do 

not have the same insulation and stability than in São Miguel. It was already reported by 

Caramanna et al. (2010) that the volume of the water affected by chemical variations is 

influenced by local conditions, such as the presence of thermocline and currents. This led to a 

lower water residence time and faster dissipation of the CO2 gradient (Agostini et al., 2015). 

It has been proposed by Agostini et al. (2015) that a mapping of pH levels and a longer pH 

monitoring would led to a better delimitation of the areas affected for the venting activity. 

What was appreciated from the data recorded with the probe during dives was a fast 

dissipation of the pH gradient not only vertically, but also horizontally, making difficult the 

assessment of the effects of the venting activity on moving animals. As it can be clearly 

appreciated in figure 3.1, CO2 bubbles were totally dissolved in the water column before they 

reach the surface (which did not occur in São Miguel), where the values are normal. pH at the 

Reference site varies along the water column, within a range of higher values (7.85-8.15). 

Values of pH lower than 7 were registered in the Vent and until 7 in the Intermediate, forming 

a gradient in the selected areas (figure 3.2). Values on table 3.2 show a pH decreasing in the 

bottom, while surface pH is constant across sites. Bottom pCO2 increased to the Vent, and the 

dissipation in surrounding waters led to similar values in the surface than in the bottom of the 

Reference site. This is because the water column exerts a great influence on the dissipation of 

the gradient despite the pCO2 values in the bottom being stronger than in São Miguel (894.08 

µmol/kgSW in Faial vs 742.50 in São Miguel). This needs to be considered for the 

interpretation of the results in this and future studies. In fact, the intensity and extent of the 

CO2 gradient in Faial are strongly influenced by the hydrological conditions (depth, currents,

thermocline), so it is more likely to affect benthic communities than the planktonic and 

pelagic communities. 

4.2.Zooplankton assemblages 

Copepods were the most abundant component of zooplankton in São Miguel, being calanoids 

as Paracalanus parvus or Centropages typicus the main species (annex 7.2). Along with 

cladocerans as Evadne spinifera, they lead to the dominance of the phylum Arthropoda 

(figure 3.3). Athropoda and Chordata present a significantly greater abundance at the venting 

site in São Miguel. The functional groups approach allowed discern between small, big and 

giant crustacean all the taxa inside Arthropoda and Tunicata and fish inside Chordata. Thus, 

analyses identified small crustacean and Tunicata as the only groups with significant 

increased abundance in the Vent site. Oikopleuridae was the main representative of tunicates, 

and its increased abundance goes according with previous studies concerning gelatinous 

zooplanktonic components. This positive correlation of appendicularians with acidification 

conditions was already manifested in a mesocosm-scale study on the effects of temperature, 

pCO2 and bloom structures on the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica (Troedsson et al., 

2013), with an increase on populations, either for a positive regulation of a low pH or for a 

negative effect of an increased pH. Abundance was positively correlated with increased pCO2, 

temperature and nutrient levels, consistent with hypotheses concerning gelatinous 

zooplankton in future oceans. Thus, results in this study suggest that appendicularians will 

play more important roles in marine pelagic communities and vertical carbon transport under 

projected ocean acidification and elevated temperature scenarios. These species ingest 

smaller-sized particles than copepods, by-passing the microbial loop by directly transferring 

bacteria and nanoplankton to higher trophic levels, and they are vectors of global vertical 

carbon flux through trapping of prey in their frequently discarded houses (Troedsson et al., 

2013). Pelagia noctiluca was not included in the analysis but its occurrence only in the Vent 

sites on both islands does not seem like causality. Future sampling campaigns in these areas 

including a task leaded to these macrozooplankton components would bring more specific and 

useful information. 

On the other hand, some species of arthropods as the cladocera Evadne spinifera, or copepods 

as Paracalanus parvus increase their abundance drastically in the Vent site, while richness, 

diversity and eveness are not significantly different among sites (annex 7.6). These species 

dominate in all sites, therefore the environmental differences in the Intermediate and Vent

sites are benefiting the zooplanktonic community. In fact, PERMANOVA analysis reflects 

these differences among sites and highlights the stability of the study sites since there are not 

significant differences among collection dates. Differences in the species composition were 

reported in other studies. Cooke et al. (2006) reported higher abundance of calanoid adults, 

cyclopoids, and Conochilus spp., a planktonic rotifer in the acidic and oligotrophic freshwater 

lake Giles in northeastern Pennsylvania. Aglaodiaptomus spatulocrenatus egg ratios, Cyclops 

scutifer egg ratios, and nauplii were also significantly higher at the high pH, whereas Daphnia 

catawba egg ratios were significantly higher at the low pH. These results are not conclusive to 

pH responses because they are combining the effects of DOM, UV and pH. However, it leads 

them to hypothesize that against changes in the seawater chemical composition, some species 

will be more benefit than others. Thus, in an open system with acidified and non-acidified 

areas, some differences in the species composition could be expected. Nevertheless, our 

results showed no differences in the species composition, only the reported increase in the 

abundances of some taxa. Results on nº of species, diversity and evenness among sites in both 

islands have to be considered along with the different resolution levels in the taxonomy, since 

for example Arthropoda has been more developed than Cnidaria, increasing the probabilities 

to find statistical differences in these indexes. 

The nMDS in São Miguel shows a clear clustering of sites, with only some dates overlapped. 

Reference and Intermediate sites seem to have characteristics more like each other than with 

Vent. The nMDS shows the affinity of P.parvus, E.spinifera and Radiozoa for the venting 

conditions, while Cirripedia nauplii show preference for areas not acidified. Previous studies 

focused on the larval stage of barnacles do not report this effect. For example, Amphibalanus 

amphitrite showed no affection in the early life phases under a pH of 7.4 (McDonald et al., 

2009); and a population model of Semibalanus balanoides using empirical data showed that a 

decreasing on pH from 8.2 to 7.8 only get a significant affect below a critical temperature 

(Findlay et al., 2010). Cirripedia together with P.parvus and E.spinifera are characterized for 

a calcium carbonate external body, being more likely affected by acidification, but since the 

early developmental stages of many marine species are suspected to be most sensitive 

(Dupont &amp;amp; Thorndyke, 2009; Kroeker et al., 2010; Cripps et al., 2014), Cirripedia on its 

planktonic life stage could have lower resistance. Paracalanus parvus and Evadne spinifera, 

as representative species of the community, have highlighted their apparent resilience under 

high CO2 conditions. Most of the previous studies in copepods (annex 7.1), showed no effect 

on the survival of these organisms under controlled conditions of decreased pH. Detrimental 



Discussion 

40 
 

effects of CO2 were only detected during the early stages, as the egg production and the 

hatching success seem to be affected. Havenhand (2012), on his study on the Baltic Sea key 

functional groups, said that it is expected that copepods will be resilient to near-future ocean 

acidification (?1000 µatm CO2). He explains that the extreme pCO2 levels used in 

experiments elicited little or no response, and that the relatively rapid generation times of 

copepods confers a high potential for adaptability. Nevertheless, as Mayor et al. (2012) 

concluded, there is a context-dependency that highlights the need for cautious interpretation 

and application of data from individual climate-change studies. Copepods, as a group, may be 

well equipped to deal with the chemical changes associated with ocean acidification, 

however, long-term exposures examining the synergistic effects of ocean acidification with 

other climate stressors, particularly warming on population viability and success, have yet to 

be conducted (Weidmann et al., 2012). 

On the other hand, Radiozoa was the only taxa with low representation in the Reference and 

Intermediate sites, and a peak of abundance in the Vent, showing high tolerance to low pH 

and thus a fitness advantage over less resistant organisms. Increased abundance of the overall 

zooplanktonic community in the venting site, were pH conditions are suboptimal, entails an 

adaptation capacity of many predominant groups, and regression of rarer species. Thereby, the 

most abundant species in the community are the main contributors to the differences among 

sites and have higher abundance in the venting sites, while Cirripedia nauplii decrease under 

acidification conditions, as others groups with low occurrence. Radiozoa was not a dominant 

group in the Reference and Intermediate sites, but it was the third group most abundant in the 

Vent. It can be a direct link between the high CO2 concentration in the water and the 

chlorophyll content in the Radiozoa cells. As them, phytoplankton would be benefited by the 

venting emissions, and it could explain the higher zooplankton abundance. Only organisms 

without resistance for these conditions would not proliferate in these environments. 

In Faial, Radiozoa acquires more importance in terms of abundance (figure 3.4), while 

gelatinous components as siphonophorous are responsible for the high biovolume in the 

samples (figure 3.7). There is not a tendency in the abundance of the organisms with the CO2 

gradient; most of the taxa increase in the Intermediate site, where the total abundance is 

higher. Only Arthropoda diversity decreases significantly with the CO2 concentration. In fact, 

the PERMANOVA analysis shows how there are no significant differences between sites, but 

there are differences between sampling dates. Thus, the nMDS relates each of the taxa 

highlighted in the SIMPER analysis with a different date. It reveals the unstable conditions in 



Discussion 

41 
 

Faial, which are manifested among the different sampling days. Since the CO2 gradient is 

completely dissolved in the vicinity of the emissions, and its effect is not discernible in the 

remainder water column, this area is led suitable to test the acidification effect on the 

planktonic and pelagic communities than the Lobeira site in S. Miguel. In the same line, the 

differences in the diversity of arthropods among sites cannot be justified with the CO2 levels 

considering that these organisms are distributed along the water column. 

4.3.RNA:DNA ratio 

The physiological state of some organisms was tested through the RNA:DNA technique to 

evaluate if the increased CO2 was affecting the main groups found at each site. Since the 

pattern was not consistent among the groups analyzed, there was not measurable effect on the 

physiological or nutritional state of the communities. A visible effect on fish larvae could be 

expected as described by Franke &amp;amp; Clemmesen (2011), which found a negative relation 

between pCO2 and RNA:DNA ratio in hatched herrings. Nevertheless, they considered as 

control a pCO2 of 480 µatm and a treatment pCO2 of 4635 µatm, which are values much 

higher than in this study and exceeding the forecasts for the end of the century. All samples 

were collected with little time of difference on the same day, so the daily variation of the 

index exposed by Chicharo &amp;amp; Chicharo (2008) for different species (ex. Sardina pichardus, 

Sciaenops ocellatus, Ruditapes decussatus, Ceratoderma edule) could not be the factor of 

variation here. However, it could be due to the non-selection of only adult organisms and 

from the same sex. RNA per unit dry weigth can be greater in females and DNA per unit dry 

weight greater in males, due to sexual dimorphism or physiological and behavioural 

differences (Chicharo et al., 2007). Catarino et al. (2012) also found a higher RNA/DNA ratio 

in females than males of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, which is attributed to ovaries 

having a higher energetic demand than testis. This effect could be avoided if only individuals 

from the same sex were selected or having a balanced same sex ratio in the samples. 

Increasing the number of replicates, by performing more tows per site during different days 

could also contribute to consolidate the results. 

4.4.Copepod Egg Production Rates (EPR) 

Previous studies calculated the egg hatching rate of different copepod species at in situ 

conditions (Andersen &amp;amp; Nielsen, 1997). Escaravage &amp;amp; Soetaert (1993) define hatching as the 

moment when at least 50% of the eggs have hatched, and Andersen &amp;amp; Nielsen (1997) 

consider a 100% hatching criterion. Here, we define hatching rate as the number of eggs 



Discussion 

42 
 

released and nauplii hatched in relation to the number of females in the sample. The nauplii 

produced were taken into consideration because the hatching of eggs can be produced during 

the time of the experiment and otherwise, the egg production would be underestimated 

(Andersen &amp;amp; Nielsen, 1997). In other methodologies, the capture and transport of copepods, 

as well as the change of the natural conditions as temperature or feeding, may cause a 

variation in the natural rates. This is the reason why incubation chambers were prepared and 

the experiment was carried out in the field with freshly caught copepods. 

As in many experiments under controlled conditions, the egg production rate of copepods 

decreased under acidification conditions in São Miguel, but not with the different exposure 

times. Bottom pH levels in table 3.1 are quite similar with the conditions of the incubation 

chambers (8.07, 8.11 and 7.87 in São Miguel; 8.13, 8.02 and 7.88 in Faial). In previous 

studies (annex 7.1), the egg production rate and/or hatching rate were tested under controlled 

conditions and there was an effect of decreasing pH. Most of them were obtained for pH 

under 7, only Cripps et al. (2014) found a decreasing on Acartia tonsa for a pH of 7.8 and 

Thor &amp;amp; Dupont (2015) on Pseudocalanus acuspes for a pH of 7.75. Conditions of higher pH 

showed no significant effect. Considering that the lower pH level measured at the bottom was 

7.75 (table 3.1), this is one of these few studies that reports a significant decreasing under 

realistic near future conditions, and the first one that report it in a natural environment and is 

not species-specific. In addition, values in table 3.1 do not correspond exactly with the 

location of the chambers, first because measurements and chambers placement were not done 

at the same time and second because chambers were accompanied by a buoy that kept them 

floating vertically approximately one meter above the substrate. It may have led to an even 

higher pH since as showed in figure 9, pH tends to increase away from the bottom until the 

surface, where decrease again only in São Miguel. 

Generally, chambers were a good methodology to evaluate secondary production in the 

natural environment, as their design was in line with their functionality. After 24 or 72h 

underwater, and despite the strong currents in Faial, only one chamber at the Vent site in São 

Miguel was lost during the 72h period. Nevertheless, the decreasing in the EPR in Faial was 

not significant. This was probably due to the highest mesh size used in this island, since 

copepods were not a component of zooplankton as abundant as in São Miguel. It has to be a 

consideration for future experiments, as well as control the quantity of copepods introduced in 

the chambers to improve the results. Thus, from the six chambers used at each site in Faial, 

three of them did not contain copepods, having been missed. Furthermore, the chambers with 



Discussion 

43 
 

copepods had 1.44±3.94 (mean±SD) individuals, while in São Miguel they were more 

abundant (3.94±4.35 (mean±SD) individuals). This loss of replicates was reflected in the 

analysis, as the degrees of freedom differ from 11 residuals in S. Miguel (table 7) to only 6 in 

Faial (table 3.8). Keeping the same methodology, it would be easily solved in future 

experiments increasing the volume of inoculum introduced into the chambers. 

The methodology used was intended to minimize the stress produced in the individuals that 

would affect the results, so the content of the tows was directly introduced in the chambers, 

with no previous selection of a fix number of females. Given the low abundances used, the 

species inside the chambers do not represent the complete zooplanktonic communities found 

in these sites. Andersen &amp;amp; Nielsen (1997) performed their experiments with 3-6 females in 

600ml bottles, which is much more concentrated than in our case. Thus, it should avoid 

cannibalism and predation during the short time experiment but allow hatching of the eggs. 

Nevertheless, the fact of these factors be present would reduce the egg hatching rates, but it 

would be constant over sites.  Also, the semi-permeable chambers allow the exchange of 

dissolved materials (including oxygen and CO2), while allowing the exclusion of larger 

predators.

5. Conclusions 

In the present study, two new natural shallow-water CO2 vents in São Miguel and Faial 

islands were characterized as in situ laboratories for ocean acidification investigations. It was 

demonstrated their suitability for investigating the effect of future dissolved CO2 levels in the 

communities of the NE Atlantic. 

Differences in the total abundance of mesozooplankton among sites in São Miguel were 

reported, as well as in the abundances of small crustaceans and Tunicata. Only differences in 

the diversity of Arthropoda were found in Faial. PERMANOVA illustrated the differences in 

the composition of the zooplanktonic assemblages among sites in São Miguel and among 

dates in Faial. The main contributors to these differences in the first case highlighted by the 

SIMPER routine, were Evadne spinifera, Paracalanus parvus, Cirripedia nauplii and 

Radiozoa. Through the nMDS analysesm Radiozoa, Paracalanus parvus and Evadne 

spinifera appeared more related to vent conditions, while Cirripedia nauplii was closer to the 

reference conditions. In Faial, the main contributors were Bassia bassensis, Radiozoa and 

Scyphozoa ephyra. Conditions in this island did not allow a division among sites in the nMDS 

analyses, since the strong currents mix the water, dissipating the effect of the gas emissions, 

and variation among days becomes more important and statistically observable. 

RNA:DNA did not show a clear pattern of variation, only copepods in São Miguel and 

cladocerans in Faial had an higher ratio in the Reference, but with no gradual decrease to the 

Vent. Fish eggs seem to have an inverted pattern. Egg Production Rate showed a decreasing 

trend along the CO2 gradient in São Miguel, with no differences in the exposure time. In 

Faial, it was higher in the Reference, but it did not differ significantly.
