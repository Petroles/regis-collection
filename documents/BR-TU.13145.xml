A biorremediação dos solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos de petróleo e hidro carboneto 

poli aromático (HAP) pode ser uma abordagem de tratamento econômica e eficiente. A 

introdução de emendas orgânicas que podem fornecer nitrogênio disponível e a potencial 

adicion de microorganismos  pode contribuir para melhorar o processo de biodegradação. No 

entanto, pouco trabalho considerou quais emendas orgânicas são melhores em termos de sua 

abundância relativa de degradadores para poluentes específicos. Neste trabalho, os compostos 

de resíduos verdes (GW) de diferentes estabilidades foram avaliados pelo potencial de 

biorremediação. Doze amostras de compostagem foram caracterizadas por parâmetros 

incluindo estabilidade (usando uma configuração modificada validada neste projeto), 

contagens de placas de Pseudomonas e Actinomicetos cultiváveis e abundância degradativa 

de gene (alkB, PAH-RHD GP e PAH-RHD GN). Estes são importantes para a degradação de 

alcanos e PAH, respectivamente. Comparando os compostos de residuos verdes acabado e 

não acabado do mesmo site, os resultados mostraram que a abundância de alk B (codificando 

alcano monoxigenase) foi maior nas amostras de compostagem menos estáveis, o que 

corresponde à maior contagem de Pseudomonas. Resultados semelhantes foram obtidos para 

o PAH-RHD GN (que codifica a Dioxigenase Hidroxilante de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos 

poliaromáticos em bactérias Gram negativas), as amostras  menos estáveis apresentaram 

maior abundância de genes degradantes. Para PAH-RHD GP (codificando a Dioxigenase 

Hidroxilante de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos poliaromáticos em bactérias Gram positivas), 

não foi possível ver uma diferença clara entre amostras acabadas e não acabadas. Dado que 

os composts menos estáveis tendem a ter maior Nitrogenio disponível, isso apoiaria o uso 

desses compostos para a biorremediação de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos de 

petróleo alifáticos e com hidrocarbonetos poli aromáticos.

Assessment of compost for bioremediation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and 

petroleum hydrocarbon soils

Bioremediation of petroleum and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated soils can be 

a cost effective and efficient treatment approach. The introduction of organic amendments 

which can provide available nitrogen, and potentially additional microorganisms, can 

contribute to improve the biodegradation process. However, little work has considered which 

organic amendments are best in terms of their relative abundance of degraders for specific 

pollutants. In this work, green waste (GW) composts of different stability were assessed for 

their bioremediation potential. Twelve compost samples were characterised for parameters 

including stability (using a modified set up validated in this project), culturable microbial 

Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes plate counts and degradative gene (alkB, PAH-RHD GP 

and PAH-RHD GN) abundance. These are important for the degradation of alkanes and PAH 

respectively. Comparing finished and un-finished green compost from the same site, results 

showed that the abundance of alkB (encoding alkane monooxygenase) was highest in the less 

stable compost samples, which corresponds with the higher Pseudomonas counts. Similar 

results were obtained for PAH-RHD GN (encoding Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon-Ring 

Hydroxylating Dioxygenase in Gram negative bacteria), the less stable samples presented 

higher abundance of degrading genes. For PAH-RHD GP (encoding Polycyclic Aromatic 

Hydrocarbon-Ring Hydroxylating Dioxygenase in Gram positive bacteria) abundance, it was 

not possible to see a clear difference between finished and un-finished samples.  Given that 

less stable composts tend to have higher available N this would support the use of these 

composts for bioremediation of aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon and Poly aromatic 

hydrocarbon contaminated soils.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Bioremediation can be defined as the use of bacteria or plants to degrade, remove or 

neutralise chemical compounds from soil or water (Collin, 2004). Two methods used for 

bioremediation of environmental pollutants using microbes are biostimulation and 

bioaugmentation. Biostimulation consists in the introduction of nutrients, such as nitrogen 

and/or phosphorus, to enhance the remedial activity of the microorganisms. On the other 

hand, bioaugmentation involves the introduction of organisms, that are known to degrade the 

contaminant chosen, into the contaminated soil. (Collin, 2004; Wu et al., 2016).     

Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are organic compounds that contain two or more fused 

benzene rings; they are toxic and persistent pollutants, some of them with carcinogenic or 

mutagenic potential (Gupta et al., 2015; White &amp;amp; Claxton, 2004). Their occurrence is natural 

and also anthropogenic, being the increase in the concentration in the environment caused by 

the latter. Petroleum is composed by a mixture of hydrocarbons; aliphatic (e.g. alkanes, 

cycloalkanes) , aromatic, PAHs, and asphaltenes; these compounds are easily degraded by 

microorganisms, particularly the alkanes and low molecular PAHs, being the higher 

molecular PAHs and asphaltenes more recalcitrant to biodegradation.(Ward &amp;amp; Singh, 2003). 

The introduction of organic amendments (e.g. composts, manure, municipal waste) which can  

adjust the organic matter content, providing available nitrogen, phosphorus and other 

nutrients to stimulate the growth of native bacteria, and  additional microbial consortium 

instead of a single microorganism, can contribute to improve the biodegradation process 

(Namkoong et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2001)  Generally,  pollutant removal and its 

degradation efficiency, is positively related to the population of degrading microorganisms 

(Ghosal et al., 2016) , which makes more interesting to explore the potential of compost to 

increase the population of degraders.  

Bioremediation of petroleum and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) , contaminated soils can 

be a cost effective and efficient treatment approach (Wu et al., 2013). The use of 

conventional technologies that include removal, modification or isolation (e.g. incineration, 

landfill) are expensive and could transfer the contaminant from one site to another, or 

between phases (Haritash &amp;amp; Kaushik, 2009; Ward &amp;amp; Singh, 2003). 

Bioremediation has been used successfully for the degradation of PAH contaminated soils 

(Antizar-Ladislao et al, 2006; Chen et al., 2015;  Kästner &amp;amp; Mahro, 1996) and of alkanes 

(Diplock et al., 2009; Namkoong et al., 2002; Taccari et al., 2012). Although many sites are 



2 

    

 

contaminated with both aliphatic and aromatic contaminants, few relatively articles deal with 

degradation of PAH and alkanes (Shahi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017). 

Compost Maturity and Stability 

Maturity and stability in compost, have been used sometimes as synonyms, but are two 

different parameters that should be determined separately (Wichuk &amp;amp; Mccartney, 2010; Wu 

&amp;amp; Martinez, 2000). BSI PAS 100:2011 defines mature compost as material with low rate of 

biodegradation, absence of pathogens and no phytotoxicity and stable compost as material 

with biodegradation rate lower than 16 mg CO2 gOM
-1 d-1. For (Wichuk &amp;amp; Mccartney, 2010) 

a mature compost is ready for a particular use. Many authors have mentioned the use of 

mature compost for biodegradation (Gomez &amp;amp; Sartaj, 2013; Kästner &amp;amp; Miltner, 2016; Taccari 

et al., 2012; G. Wu et al., 2013), but the use of phytotoxicity as a maturity indicator is not a 

good choice for compost applicated to bioremediation, because this material is going to be 

degraded even further, and the salts that contribute to phytotoxicity could be useful as 

nutrients in this process. 

Being compost stability the meassurement of the oxigen comsumption, CO2 production or 

self-heating  from the decomposition of the organic matter by the microorganisms (Barrena-

Gomez, et al., 2006) and this decomposition is linked to the abundance of degradable organic 

matter and microorganisms, stability seems to be the key measure for the assesment of the 

potencial of compost for bioremediation.  

To assess the bioremediation potential of green waste and green and food waste compost 

samples the aims of this research were: 

 

1)  Improve the robustness of ORG0020 compost stability determination. 

2) Assess the relationship between compost stability with the abundance of PAH and alkane 

degraders using qPCR. PCR methods allow specific and sensitive detection of degrading 

genes in bacteria from different taxonomic group, including non-culturable microorganisms 

(Perez-de-Mora et al., 2010) and is less time consuming. 

3) Assess the relationship between culturable microbial Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes 

count in compost and contaminates soil and the abundance of catabolic genes. 

4) Assess the potential increment of alkane and PAH degraders of adding compost samples to 

known contaminated soil samples.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1 Compost sample characterisation 

Green, and food and green waste (GW and FGW respectively) compost samples, finished and 

post-sanitised, were collected from seven UK composting sites. 

Table 2.1 Compost identification, type, source and status. 

Sample     Site Process type Feedstock Status 

A 1 In-vessel FGW Finished 

B 2 Ex situ GW Finished 

C 3 In-vessel FGW Finished 

D 4 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised 

E 4 Ex situ GW Finished 

F 1 In-vessel FGW Post sanitised 

G 1 In-vessel FGW Finished 

H 5 Ex situ GW Finished 

I 5 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised 

J 6 Ex situ GW Finished 

K 7 Ex situ GW Post- sanitised 

L 7 Ex situ GW Finished 

FGW: food and green waste, GW: green waste. 

The following assays were carried out on the 12 samples. 

Dry matter was carried out according to BS EN 13040:2007 with the following 

modifications: weight of sample approximately 9 g, dried for 20 h, weighted, the tray was 

placed in the oven for an additional h, weighted, the difference between the two weights was 

not more than 0.1 g. 

Determination of laboratory bulk density was carried out according to BS EN 13040:2007. 

Organic matter content was carried out according to BS EN 13039:2011 with the following 

modifications: the sample was dried for 20 h at 103 °C, then placed in the desiccator and 

allowed to cool to room temperature, weighted, then placed again in the oven for 1 h more, 

placed back in desiccator and allowed to cool to room temperature, weighted, the difference 

between the two weights was not more than 0.01 g.   



4 

    

 

pH: It was carried out according to BS EN 13037:2011 (HI 8424 pH meter, Hanna 

Instruments, USA). Commercially available buffers pH 7 and 10 were used for calibration. 

(Hanna Instruments, UK).  

Electrical conductivity:  according to BS EN 13038:2011 (HI 99301 EC/TDS meter, Hanna 

Instruments, USA).  Unfiltered water extracts were used. 

2.2 Microbial plate counts 

Sample aliquots, 1 g fresh weight were suspended in 9 ml of 0.85% (w/v) NaCl and shaken 

for one min. Dilutions were made in decimal steps and cultured in triplicate on 

Actinomycetes Isolation Agar (Fluka-Sigma Aldrich, India) and Pseudomonas Isolation agar 

(Fluka- Sigma Aldrich, India) for 48 h at 25 °C. Colonies were counted manually with 

colony-forming units based on single dilutions, less than 300 CFU per plate. 

2.3 Compost stability  

2.3.1 Compost stability was assessed using two set ups. 

Eleven experiments were run, three (no. 9, 10 and 11) of which were done at low flow rate 

(?25 ml min-1) and nine (no. 1,2,3,4,5,7,12 and 13) at high air flow rate (45-50 ml min -1). 

Original set up (figure 2.1.A): It was done according to ORG0020  standard laboratory based 

test to measure compost stability by measurement of evolved carbon dioxide (Llewelyn, 

2005). (Hailea V10 diaphragm pump, Guangdong Hailea Group Co., Ltd., China). 

Standardisation procedure of 1M solutions of HCl and NaOH can be found in appendix.   

Modified set up (figure 2.1.B): Instead of the diaphragm pump a multichannel peristaltic 

pump head (205CA12, Watson Marlow Limited, UK.) connected to either a 502S or 520 Du 

pump (Watson Marlow Limited, UK) was used. Marprene manifold tubing 2.79 mm bore and 

0.8 mm wall thickness, (part no 905.0027.008; Watson-Marlow Limited, UK) was used. 

Monitoring and adjustment (as necessary) of flow rate were done daily before and after 

changing the NaOH traps in both setups. Monitoring was carried out at the exit pipe of the 

CO2 traps using an Ellutia 7000 flow meter. The flow rate and time taken for monitoring and 

adjustment were recorded. 

2.3.2 Compost stability modifying the flow 

A short experiment (no. 3) only until day four using the original set up but modifying the 

flow on day two was run. The flow was adjusted to&amp;lt;10 ml/min in three vessels, the other 

four (three replicates and one blank) were maintained within method range.

2.4 Contaminated soil characterisation 

Soil samples (31 in total) were provided by industrial contacts and collaborators from three 

contaminated sites from the U.K. and Switzerland. 

pH: 1g fresh weight of contaminated soil sample vas suspended in 5 ml of distilled water, 

shaken for 30 s then let settled for 30 min and shaken again for 30 s before pH was measured 

(HI 8242 pH meter, Hanna Instruments, USA). Commercially available buffers pH 7 and 10 

were used for calibration (Hanna Instruments, UK). 

2.5 Soil microbial plate counts 

The method used for compost samples was used.

2.6 DNA extraction and quantification 

Standards: DNA was extracted from bacterial culture of Pseudomonas putida (NCIMB 9816, 

culture collection) and Rhodococcus sp. (NCIMB 12038, culture collection) in nutrient agar 

grown for 48 h at 30 °C, using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to 

manufacturer’s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). 

Compost: Genomic DNA was extracted from compost samples in duplicate (0.25 g fresh 

compost each) and then pooled, using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, 

Inc., USA) according to manufacturer’s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 

(Thermo Scientific). 

Contaminated soil: Genomic DNA was extracted from soil samples (0.25 g fresh soil each) 

using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., USA) according to 

manufacturer’s manual and quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). 

2.7 Detection of alk B, PAH-RHD GN AND PAH-RHD GP genes 

To obtain the standards for Real time PCR, End point PCR was carried out with Veriti, 96 

well thermal cycler (AB Applied Biosystems). PCR reactions were of 20 µl containing: 10 µl 

Quantitec SYBR green PCR mastermix (Qiagen Germany), 2 µl primer forward, 2 µl primer 

reverse (both Eurofins Genomic, 4.000 mM), 0.8 µl of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 

20mg/ml, Roche), 3.2 µl Nuclease-free water (Ambion) and 2 µl of template DNA or 

Nuclease-free water (negative control). 

The products were visualized and checked for a single band of the expected size alongside a 

100 bp DNA ladder (Promega, USA) by agarose gel electrophoresis (1,5% agarose with 

gelred acid stain, (Biotium). 

Standards´ DNA clean up: End point PCR product DNA was cleaned using Wizard SV Gel 

and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega Corporation, USA) according with manufacturer´s 

manual. 

Real time PCR: Step One, Real time PCR System, AB Applied Biosystems, were performed 

in 20 µl volumes containing: 10 µl PerfeCTa SYBR green ROC (Quanta, USA) 2 µl forward 

primer (Eurofins Genomic, 4.000 mM), 2 µl reverse primer (4.000X mM), 0.8 µl of bovine 

serum albumin (BSA), 20mg/ml, Roche), 3.2 µl Nuclease-free water (Ambion) and 2 µl of 

template DNA or Nuclease-free water (negative control)

3. IMPROVEMENT OF ORG0020 SETUP FOR COMPOST STABILITY 

DETERMINATION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1 Compost characterisation 

Five finished and unfinished compost samples from four composting sites were used for the 

stability experiments. The dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) content were measured, 

as they are necessary for the calculation of compost stability, results are shown in table 3.1. 

The compost samples stability ranged from 0.48 to 7.93 mg CO2 g OM
-1d-1 and therefore fall 

within the  PAS 100:2011 (BSI, 2011) limit of 16 mg CO2 g OM
-1d-1.

food and green waste. The results presented of DM, OM and Stability are the average among three replicates. 

 

3.2 Equilibration experiments 

3.2.1 Equilibration experiments with both set ups 

To study the impact of the flow behaviour during the equilibration period, experiments were 

run until day 4, the air flow was measure twice a day for the four days. As shown in figure 

3.1. the air flow of the original set up (dotted line) was variable, the vessels that don’t appear 

in the graph fell out of range:  airflow lower than the method’s minimum (25 ml min-1) in 

experiments 1 and 2, and higher than the maximum (75 ml min-1) in experiment 2. The 

modified set up air flow rate (solid lines) was within method range throughout this period. 

The hollow squares represent the blanks of each set up. 

The results of the CO2 evolution after the equilibration period are shown in table 3.2., they 

correspond to the average of three replicates. In experiment 1 the standard deviation is 

significantly higher in the original set up than in the modified, this could be due to the 



10 

    

 

variation of the airflow during the equilibration period, falling out or range in the four vessels 

of the original set up. Less precision is also observed in the original set up of experiment 2 

(table 3.2.), probably influenced by lower and higher flowrate in some vessels (figure 3.1). 

 

Figure 3.1 Air flow in equilibration experiments with both set ups 

 

 

3.2.2 Equilibration experiments: modifying the flow, only original set up 

After observing this rise in the standard deviation of the CO2 evolved on experiments 1 and 2 

(table 3.2.), when during the equilibration period the air flow rate was lower than method’s 

range; an experiment using the original set up but modifying the flow on day 2 was run, 

figure 3.2. The flow was adjusted to&amp;lt;10 ml/min in 3 vessels, the other 4 (3 replicates and 1 

blank) were maintained within method range. 

The stability results are shown in table 3.2. Higher CO2 evolution, about 20%, was observed 

for the vessels with the modified flow than with the original set up. Therefore, it seems to be 

a relation between airflow within method range and accuracy of CO2 evolution measurement.

3.3 Comparison between full length compost stability experiments 

In figure 3.3. it is possible to observe five full length experiments in which the flow was 

variable after the equilibration period in the original set up. In these experiments, the flow 

during equilibration was not measured, following the standard protocol. Experiments 4, 6, 

and 7 were run in triplicate plus one blank in both set ups. Experiments 12 and 13 were run 

with five replicates (one outlier on both set ups was eliminated) and one blank. 

In all the experiments shown, there was variation of the airflow rate during the equilibration 

period in the original set up. In most of the cases, experiments 7,12, and 13, this is translated 

in higher standard deviation of the CO2 evolved in day four than with the modified set up 

(table 3.3.). The airflow in the modified set up appears to have remained within range. At the 

end of the experiments, the average production of CO2 was more precise with the modified 

set up: experiments 4, 6, 12 and 13.

3.4 Experiments with low flow 

To compare how both set ups perform with lower airflow (?25 ml min-1), experiments were 

run in this condition, experiments 9, 10, and 11, data and graphs can be found in appendix. 

The standard deviation of the CO2 evolved is higher for the original than for the modified set 

up, as happened for the higher airflow. Being the modified method more precise. 

3.5 Precision and accuracy 

(Aspray et al., 2015) found differences in stability results between two laboratories in five 

active samples by factors of 1.2 to 2.2, suggesting that the test is not robust enough for active 

samples. (Llewelyn, 2005) reported an in-house precision of 0.906 mg CO2 gOM
-1 d-1, this 

value was assessed using a water bath at 25°C with 8 replicates, since the method’s bath 

temperature is 30°C and samples are run in 3 replicates, the value of precision doesn’t seem 

appropriate to assess the performance of the OG0020 test.  

Sample homogeneity and the measurements of dry matter and volatile solids are important 

factors influencing the precision of this method (Llewelyn, 2012). However, in the 

experiments of this work, the value of dry matter and volatile solids used were applied 

consistently to both set ups, therefore, the factors influencing the precision would be sample 

homogeneity and air flow rate within range. When the flow was lower than the required by 



14 

    

 

the method there could have been a CO2 accumulation in the vessels during the equilibration 

period, and once the airflow was restored to the value needed this CO2 was collected in the 

NaOH traps which could affect the accuracy of the measurement.

4. ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL OF COMPOST 

BASED IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPOST STABILITY AND 

CATABOLIC GENE ABUNDANCE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

4.1 Compost characterisation 

Characterisation results of ten finished and post sanitised compost samples from six 

composting sites are shown in table 4.1.  The pH range is between 7.11 and 8.65 for samples 

falling within the PAS 100:2011 stability limit of 16 mg CO2 gOM
-1 d-1. By comparing the  

more active samples F and G, one unfinished and one finished, the pH is 6.59 and 6.19 

respectively, which could be explained by the abundance of organic acids during the first 

stages of decomposition, lowering the pH, as degradation proceeds organic acids are 

neutralized and ammonia mineralized (Beck-Friis et al., 2003) and mature compost can have 

pH between 7 and 9.  Food compost samples tend to have higher concentration of nitrate 

which can lead to lower pH and higher EC ( sample G) (Sanchez-Monedero, et al. , 2001). As 

the aim of this work is to study the relationship between compost stability and abundance of

degraders, and samples F and G, from the same site, have approximately the same stability 

value, although one of them is finished and the other un finished, they are discarded from the 

study. 

4.2 Quantification of degrading genes:  alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP 

Real time PCR was run to quantify the abundance of the alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes. 

Alk B gene is an indicator of the presence of alk B degraders (Kloos et al., 2006) 

(Guermouche M’rassi et al., 2015) and  PAH RHD genes of PAH degraders (Cébron et al., 

2008) respectively. 

4.2.1 Melt curve analysis and amplification efficiency 

Melt curve analysis is an important quality control aspect for SYBR green based qPCR. The 

analysis of the alk B curves showed only one peak present in all the samples. The melting 

temperature of the product of the standards, made with pure cultures, is slightly lower than of 

the product of the environmental samples. In absence of samples, it seems there is some 

primer dimer amplification (negatives). The standard curve was linear, data shown in table 

4.2. and the efficiency close to other study (where reported) using the same primers and 

method (Schulz et al., 2012; Wallisch et al., 2014). These primers were used for 

contaminated soil amended with compost (Wallisch et al., 2014) and in soil and maize and 

pea plant litter (Schulz et al., 2012), they have performed well in compost samples.

? - 4.385 ?0.941 ?60.07 

PAH RHD GN ? - 4.57 ?0.929 ?52.46 

 

In the PAH RHD GN melt curve analysis samples D, the one with higher abundance (table 

4.3), K and L showed a single peak (data not shown). Samples A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I and J 

presented multiples peaks, one of them in the melting temperature of the product desired and 

the rest around 74 °C. Multiple peaks were also observe for the standard at low concentration 

103 and in absence of samples (negatives). Although the standard curve was linear (table 

4.2.), the efficiency was low (?52.46).  The curve for PAH RHD GP showed one peak for 

samples A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, K and L in the same temperature of the products of the 



17 

    

 

standards, and multiple peaks for sample F (lowest abundance) and for the negatives (absence 

of sample). The standard curve was linear with low amplification efficiency, but better than 

for PAH RHD GN. (Cébron et al., 2008) reported variation in DNA amplification efficiency 

due to presence of PCR inhibitor substances (e.g. humic acids) in soil and sediments samples, 

this could explain the low efficiency showed in this study for compost samples. Because the 

amplification efficiency is low, the values of the concentration of PAH RHD GN and GP 

could be higher if they were corrected measuring the value of inhibition. 

4.2.2 Catabolic genes’ abundance 

The abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes can be found on table 4.3 (the data 

represents the mean between two replicates).  The alk B gene presence range was from 1.23 x 

105 to 1.53 x 108 copies g-1 compost dw. The PAH RHD GN presence range from 1.59 x 105 

to 6.75 x 106 copies g-1 compost dw. The PAH RHD GP presence range from 1.96 x 105 to 

3.39 x 107 copies g-1 compost dw. Standard deviation between replicates was done as part of 

the qPCR program (CT st deviation &amp;lt;0.50), for alk B all samples were within range; for PAH 

RHD GN there was high standard deviation between replicates in samples B, I, J and L, and 

for PAH RHD GP in sample G. In all samples, the difference between replicates was lower 

than one order of magnitude. This could be due to Ct values higher than 30, or error in 

pipetting. 

4.3. Relationship between compost stability and degrading gene abundance 

Plots of catabolic gene abundance vs compost stability were made to explore if there is a 

correlation. As we can observe in figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, apparently there is no linear 

correlation between these variables. Further analysis considered whether there was a 

correlation for specific feedstocks (GW and FGW) derived compost. Samples A, C and J 

(FGW) have no apparent correlation in any of the degrading genes. Samples B, D, E, H, I, K 

and L (GW) didn’t show any linear correlation either (data not shown). Because compost 

composition changes depending on when the process started (availability of feedstocks, 

temperature), to study if there is a correlation it was necessary to reduce variables, the 

approach taken for this was comparing gene abundance and compost stability between 

finished and un-finished samples from the same site.

4.3.1. Relationship between compost stability and alk B abundance 

Comparing GW finished and un-finished samples from sites 4 and 5 (figure 4.4), the 

unfinished and more active (D, I) have higher quantity of alk B genes (one order of 

magnitude) than the finished and less active (E, H). A similar result has been shown by 

(Wallisch et al., 2014)  who found significantly higher gene numbers (one order of 

magnitude) in contaminated soil treated with immature compost compared to that with 

mature compost. (Franke-Whittle et al, 2009) have also found that in GW compost, the 

numbers of known compost microorganisms were higher for 2-week compost than 16-week 

samples, however, they didn’t characterise them as alk B degraders. There is also the 

possibility of presence of alkane degraders that don’t present the alk B gene, these 

microorganisms wouldn’t be detected by this method. For site 7, samples K and L the 

abundance of alk B is higher in sample L, the less active, finished compost. The alk B 

abundance in the samples from this site are two and one orders of magnitude lower than in 

the sites 4 and 5 respectively.

4.3.2 Relationship between compost stability and PAH RHD GN and GP 

Comparing site 4 samples D and E the PAH-RHD GP abundance is similar in both. The PAH 

RHD GN abundance is higher in the un-finished, sample D. In site 5 samples I and J the 

abundance of PAH RHD GP and GN are higher in the un-finished compost (sample I). 

Comparing site 7, samples K and L the PAH-RHD GP abundance is higher in the finished 

sample (L) and the PAH-RHD GN abundance is higher in the un-finished and more active 

sample K. 

The values of PAH RHD GP and GN abundance for these samples of compost, is within 

range of the values (4.4×104 (±2.4×104)to 4.7×107 (±2.4×107) copies g? 1 soil or sediment dw)  

found in contaminated soil samples by (Cébron et al., 2008).

Figure 4.6. Finished and un-finished compost PAH RHD GN abundance vs compost stability 

 

4.4 Assessment of bioremediation potential 

The results showed that there is apparent relationship between compost stability and Alk B 

and PAH RHD GN abundance, in more active samples the number of degrading genes is 

higher, which would support the use of less stable (immature) composts for bioremediation of 

PAH and petroleum hydrocarbon soils. Nevertheless, future work should prove if this 

correspond to abundance of expressed genes and therefore, the potential of augmenting the 

degraders population on soil, and as a result if the biodegradation rate is enhanced. 

4.5 Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes microbial plate count 

Since most of the alk B and PAH known degraders correspond to the genera Pseudomonas 

and Actinomycetes, cultural microbial plate were counted, data in table 4.4. 

Comparing the microbial count between samples D and E, from site 4, the actinomycetes 

count is higher in samples D (un-finished). In sites 5 and 7,  the CFUs is higher in the 

samples H and K (less active, finished) than in I and L (more active, immature), this finding 

agrees with (Franke-Whittle et al., 2009), who found higher number of actinomycetes in 

mature compost  (16-week) than in fresher samples (2-week) and it’s consistent with (Antil 

&amp;amp; Raj, 2012) who includes the increase of actinomycetes count at the end of the composting 

process, as one of the indicators of compost maturity. 

The pseudomonas count in sites 4 and 7 is one order of magnitude higher in the more active 

samples D and L than in the finished samples E and K. For samples I and H of site 5, the 

pseudomonas count is almost one order of magnitude higher in the finished sample (H), but 

the standard deviation (89.80) of the measurement in this sample, is too high to be reliable. 

This results are comparable to (MacCready et al., 2013) who have found higher numbers of

higher than 55°C, finding lower quantity in finished compost. However, the unfinished

As was mentioned before a great number of alk B and PAH RHD harbouring bacteria 

correspond to the genera Actinomycetes and Pseudomonas. However, there is no clear 

relationship between the abundance of the gene and the microbial plate count, figures 4.7; 4.8 

and 4.9., this could be explained by previous studies that showed that bacteria can harbour 

more than one alk B gene operon per cell (Heiss-Blanquet et al., 2005), similar conclusions 

have been made by (Cébron et al., 2008) about the PAH RHD gene, as bacteria can possess 

different number of genes per cell according to its genera.

5. COMPARISON OF ALK B, PAH RHD GP AND PAH RHD GN GENE 

ABUNDANCE IN PAH CONTAMINATED SOILS AND COMPOSTS. RESULTS 

AND DISCUSSION. 

5.1. Quantification of degrading genes:  alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP. 

In order to compare gene abundance in contaminated soils to those in composts as an 

approach to bioremediation, quantification of the abundance of degrading genes alk B, PAH 

RHD GN and GP in contaminated soils sample was done using Real time PCR.  As was 

mentioned in chapter 4, Alk B gene is an indicator of the presence of alk B degraders (Kloos 

et al., 2006) (Guermouche M’rassi et al., 2015) and  PAH RHD genes of PAH degraders 

(Cébron et al., 2008) respectively.  

5.1.1. Melt curve analysis 

To check if the right product was amplified and the performance of the primers and the 

method, a melt curve analysis was made. 

5.1.1.1 Contaminated soil site 1 

The analysis of the Alk B melt curve showed only one peak in all the samples, at around the 

same temperature of the products of the standards. The standard curve was linear, data shown 

in table 5.1, and the efficiency lower than others studies (Schulz et al., 2012; Wallisch et al., 

2014), this could be because environmental samples are sensitive to inhibition. 

In the melt curve analysis of PAH RHD GN one peak appeared for samples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 

9, 12, 14, 15 16, 17 and 18. Multiple peaks were present for samples: 10 (lowest abundance, 

table 5.3), 11 and 13 and for low concentration standard 103. The standard curve was linear, 

and the efficiency was low, but higher than the one with the compost samples. PAH RHD GP 

melt curve showed multiple peaks for all the samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 

15, 16, 17 and 18. The standard curve was linear, and the efficiency was low, but higher than 

with the compost samples. Low efficiencies with these primers and its possible causes were 

discussed in section 4.2.1.

5.1.1.2 Contaminated soil sites 2 and 3 

The analysis of the melt curve for Alk B gene showed one peak  for samples: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. 

Multiples peaks were present samples 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The standard curve was 

linear, data in table 5.2 and the efficiency was lower than in other studies (Wallisch et al., 

2014)  

For PAH RHD GN gene all the samples presented one peak. The standard curve was linear, 

data in table 5.2 and the efficiency low, even lower than in chapter 4 with compost samples. 

As mentioned before, this could be due the presence of inhibitors in the environmental 

samples (Cébron et al., 2008). The analysis of the melt curve for PAH RHD GP showed 

single peaks for samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Multiple peaks were present for samples 9, 

10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The standard curve was linear, and the efficiency comparable as the 

ones obtained with the compost samples.

5.1.2. Abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and PAH RHD GP catabolic genes. 

5.1.2.1 Contaminated soil site 1 

The abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes can be found on table 5.3 (the data 

represents the mean between two replicates).  The alk B gene presence range was from 2.92 x 

10 5 to 1.52 x 10 8 copies g-1dw., high standard deviation for samples 1,9, 10, 12, 16, and 18. 

The PAH RHD GN presence range from 6.05 x 10 5 to 1.13 x 10 9 copies g-1 soil dw, high 

standard deviation for samples 1, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 18. The PAH RHD GP presence range 

from 2.54 x 104 to 7.46 x 10 5 copies g-1 soil dw and showed high standard deviation for the 

samples 8, 10, 12 and 13. Lower values of PAH RHD genes were obtained by (Cébron et al., 

2008) 4.4 x 104 (±2.4 x 104) to 4.7 x 107 (±2.4 x 107) copies g? 1 soil or sediment dw for 

highly contaminated soils.

*data provided by industrial contacts and collaborators 

 

5.1.2.2 Contaminated soil sites 2 and 3The abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP genes 

for sites 2 and 3 can be found on table 5.4 (the data represents the mean between two 

replicates). The alk B gene presence range was from 4.3 x 10 6 to 7.70 x 10 7 copies g-1dw 

and 2.62 x 106 to 1.93 x 107 copies g-1 dw for sites 2 and 3 respectively, no high standard 

deviation error was present. The PAH RHD GN presence range from 1.32 x 10 7 to 5.33 x 10 

7 copies g-1 soil dw and 9.32 x 10 6 to 4.76 x 10 7 copies g-1 soil dw, for sites 2 and 3. high 

standard deviation for samples 11 and 13 (lowest abundance).  The PAH RHD GP presence 

in site 2 range from 3.65 x 105 to 2.62 x 10 6 copies g-1 soil dw and in site 3 from 1.70 x 105 

to 1.15 x 10 6 copies g-1 soil dw and showed high standard deviation for the samples 1 and 11. 

Similar results were obtained by (Cébron et al., 2008) for highly contaminated soils, 4.4 x 104 

(±2.4×104)to 4.7 x 107 (±2.4 x 107) copies g? 1 soil or sediment dw.

Table 5.4 Degrading gene abundance in contaminated soils site 2 and 3 

 

5.2 Assessment of the bioaugmentation potential 

Previous studies showed that the range of compost added for bioremediation of PAH and 

alkane contaminated soils is between 7 to 25% w/w (Antizar-Ladislao et al., 2006b; Taccari 

et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013). This value is a fine balance between providing optimal 

quantities of nutrients and microorganisms, and keeping the amount of extra contaminated 

material to a minimum. 

Comparing compost’s D, E, I and H abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GP and GN genes and 

the range of these genes abundance in site 1 (table 5.5) we can conclude that the amendment 

with these composts would increase the degrading genes in this site. For samples K and L and 

site 1 the augmentation would occur for genes alk B and PAH RHD GP, for PAH RHD GN 

this would not be the case due since the abundance of this gene in these samples falls out of 

the range of the abundance in site 1. 

In site 2 none of the compost samples would increase the abundance of PAH RHD GN, the 

range of these genes is higher in the soil than in the compost samples. For the alk B gene 

samples D, E, I and L could increase the abundance. For the PAH RHD GP gene all of the 

compost samples would increase the abundance of the gene.

In site 3 samples D, E, I, H, and L would increase the quantity of alk B gene, for PAH RHD 

GP all of the compost samples would contribute to the augmentation of the degrading genes, 

this is not the case for PAH RHD GN, where none of the samples could increase the 

abundance on the contrary samples K and L could decrease it. 

Considering finished and un-finished compost for all the sites compost sample D (un-

finished) would increase more the abundance of the catabolic genes than sample E (finished). 

Between samples I and H, sample I (un-finished) would increase the catabolic gene 

abundance. For samples K and L, none of them would increase the catabolic gene abundance.

5.3 Comparison of gene abundance in site 1 and concentration of PAH 

Plots of PAH concentration vs catabolic gene abundance were made to explore if there is a 

relationship between these variables. As we can observe in figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 there 

appear to be no linear correlation. For alk B and PAH RHD GN it seems to be a maximum 

concentration where the abundance of these genes is the highest and after this they start to 

decrease and then remain at about 105  copies g-1 dw, this could be related to high 

concentration of PAH which could inhibit its degradation (Providenti et al., 1993). For PAH 

RHD GP there seem to be no linear correlation.

5.4 Pseudomonas and Actinomycetes microbial plate count 

Three random samples of site 1, 1 of site 2 and 2 of site 3 were chosen for Actinomycetes and 

Pseudomonas culturable plate count, data in table 5.6. These results show that while the 

abundance of catabolic genes is similar in the contaminated soil samples and in compost 

samples, the microbial plate count is lower (one or two orders of magnitude for 

Pseudomonas, and three orders of magnitude for Actinomycetes). This could suggest that the 

microorganisms present harbour more than one gene operon per cell (Cébron et al., 2008; 

Heiss-Blanquet et al., 2005), and also, that unculturable bacteria of this genera could be 

present.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 

In this work twelve compost samples of different type and age were characterised in order to 

analyse their bioremediation potential comparing compost stability and abundance of alk B, 

PAH RHD GN and PAH RHD GP genes. By comparing different types of compost, too 

many variables were present which made impossible to find a clear trend, therefore the 

potential was only analysed in Green compost, comparing finished and un-finished samples 

from the same site. 

• A modified setup of the compost stability measurement ORG0020 was developed and 

found to be more precise than the original setup. With new set up, also the accuracy 

has been improved. 

• Three primers have been tried in compost samples, the alk B having good results and 

the PAH RHD GN and GP with apparent inhibition, sample dilution or other methods 

to reduce the interference could be used to get more accurate results. 

• Given that the results showed higher alkB and PAH RHD GN degrading gene 

abundance in less stable GW composts, and that these composts tend to have higher 

available N, this would support the use of these composts for bioremediation of 

aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated 

soils. 

• For PAH RHD GP gene abundance and compost stability there was no clear 

relationship, the abundance values were similar between finished and un-finished 

samples. 

• While this study shows that the abundance of degrading genes (alk B and PAH RHD 

GN) is higher in less stable compost, future work should prove if this correspond to 

abundance of expressed genes and therefore, the potential of augmenting the 

degraders population on soil, and as a result if the biodegradation rate is enhanced. 

• Post-sanitised compost shouldn’t contain pathogen microorganisms, to assure the 

unfinished (more active) compost doesn’t spread E. coli or Salmonella, a microbial 

count and presence test should be made. 

• Another approach it would be to do next generation sequencing or DGGE to identify 

the microorganisms to check if they have been proved to be alkane or PAH degraders 

or to reveal unknown or uncultured bacteria. 



34 

    

 

• Comparing the abundance of alk B, PAH RHD GN and GP in know contaminated 

soils and compost, the potential of the increment of alkane and PAH degraders is 

higher with un-finished composts. 

• Pseudomonas plate count was higher in the more active composts, similar to results 

found in other studies.

2.3. SOP: Standardisation of solutions 

Solutions 1M of HCl were prepared adding 83.6 ml of commercial solutions of HCl 37% 

(Fisher Scientific, UK) and diluting with distilled water in a volumetric flask to reach the 1l. 

Because HCl is not a primary standard, this solution is only approximately 1M, which makes 

it necessary to standardise it. Na2CO3 (100%, Fisher Scientific UK limited) was used. 

Because we didn’t use Na2CO3 standard, the titrations of the HCl were done to ensure 

consistency in the concentration, not proper standardisation. 

Procedure 

- Na2CO3 was dried for 1 hour at 270-300 °C 

- Weight exactly about 2 and 2.5 g of Na2CO3 in to and 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 50 ml 

of distilled water. 

- Add 2 or 3 drops of phenolphthalein solution 

- Titrate with the HCl ? 1M solution, slowly and with constant agitation until the colour 

changes 

- Add 2 or 3 drops of methyl orange 0.1% 

- Continue the titration until the colour changes from yellow to red-orange. 

- Write down the volume used  

- Calculate the concentration: 

             HCl molar concentration =  (g) weighted Na2CO3 x 2 

                                                          (g)MW Na2CO3 x (l)Volume HCl used 

Solutions 1 M of NaOH were prepared dissolving 40gr of NaOH (Fisher Scientific UK) and 

diluting to 1litre in a volumetric flask. As HCl solutions are stable, they were used to 

standardise the prepared NaOH solution.

Experiments with low flow. 

To compare how both set ups perform with lower airflow (?25 ml min-1), experiments were 

run in this condition, air flow shown in figure 3.4. In table 3.4. we can observe that for 

experiments 10 and 11 the standard deviation, on days 4 to 7, of the CO2 evolved is higher for 

the original than for the modified set up, as happened for the higher airflow.
