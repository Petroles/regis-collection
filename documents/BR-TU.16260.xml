Abstract

Seismic anisotropy at continental regions, mainly at stable areas, gives important information

about past and present tectonic events, and helps us in understanding patterns of upper mantle

flow in a way not achieved by other methods. The measurement of shear wave splitting (SWS),

at individual stations, from core refracted phases (such as SKS phases), indicates the amount

and orientation of the seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle. Previous studies of SWS in

South America concentrated mainly along the Andes and in southeast Brazil. Now we add

extra measurements extending to all Brazilian territory, especially in the Pantanal and Parana?-

Chaco basins, as part of the FAPESP “3-Basins Thematic Project”. The results from both

temporary deployments and from the Brazilian permanent network provide a more complete and

robust anisotropy map of the South America stable platform. In general the fast polarization

orientations have an average E-W orientation. Significant deviations to ESE-WNW or ENE-

WSW are observed in many regions. We compare our results with different anisotropy proxies:

absolute plate motion given by the hotspot reference frame HS3-NUVEL-1A, a recent model of

time dependent upper mantle flow induced by the Nazca plate subduction, global anisotropy

from surface wave tomography, and geologic trends. We observe a poor correlation of the

anisotropy directions with geological trends, with the exception of a few stations in northern

Brazil and a better correlation with the mantle flow model. Therefore, our observed anisotropy

is mainly due to upper-mantle flow, with little contribution from frozen lithospheric anisotropy.

Also, deviations from the mantle flow model, which includes a thicker lithosphere at the Amazon

craton, are mainly due to flow surrounding cratonic nuclei not used in the model: the keel of the

Sa?o Francisco craton and a possible cratonic nucleus beneath the northern part of the Parana?

Basin (called Paranapanema block). Large delay times at the Pantanal Basin may indicate

a stronger asthenospheric channel, a more coherent flow, or a thicker asthenosphere. Small

delays beneath the northern Parana? Basin and central Amazon craton may indicate thinner

anisotropic asthenosphere.

Resumo

Anisotropia s??smica em regio?es continentais, principalmente em a?reas esta?veis, nos da? in-

formac?o?es importantes sobre eventos tecto?nicos do passado e do presente, e nos ajuda a entender

padro?es de fluxo do manto superior de forma na?o alcanc?ada por outros me?todos geof??sicos. A

medida de separac?a?o de ondas cisalhantes (SWS), em estac?o?es individuais, de fases refratadas

no nu?cleo (fases SKS, por exemplo), indica a intensidade e orientac?a?o da anisotropia s??smica no

manto superior. Estudos pre?vios de SWS na Ame?rica do Sul se concentraram principalmente

ao longo dos Andes e no sudeste do Brasil. Agora adicionamos medidas extras que se extendem

por todo territo?rio Brasileiro e alguns pa??ses vizinhos, especialmente nas bacias do Pantanal

e do Chaco-Parana?, como parte do ”Projeto Tema?tico 3-Bacias” da FAPESP. Os resultados

tanto das estac?o?es tempora?rias quanto da rede permanente Brasileira mostram um mapa de

anisotropia mais robusto e completo da plataforma esta?vel da Ame?rica do Sul. Em geral, as

direc?o?es de polarizac?a?o ra?pida tem em me?dia direc?a?o L-O. Desvios significantes nas direc?o?es

LSL-ONO ou LNL-OSO sa?o observadas em muitas regio?es. Comparamos nossos resultados com

diferentes representantes da anisotropia: movimento absoluto de placa dado pelo sistema de

refere?ncia de hotspot HS3-NUVEL-1A, um modelo recente dependente do tempo de fluxo do

manto superior induzido pela subducc?a?o da placa de Nazca, anisotropia global de tomografia

de ondas de superf??cie, e tende?ncias geolo?gicas. Observamos pouca correlac?a?o das direc?o?es de

anisotropia com tende?ncias geolo?gicas, com excec?a?o de algumas estac?o?es no norte do Brasil e

uma melhor correlac?a?o com o modelo de fluxo do manto. Portanto, nossa anisotropia observada

e? devida principalmente a fluxo do manto superior, com pouca contribuic?a?o de anisotropia ”con-

gelada” litosfe?rica. Tambe?m, desvios do modelo de fluxo do manto, o qual inclui uma litosfera

mais espessa no cra?ton da Amazo?nia, sa?o devido ao fluxo ao redor de nu?cleos crato?nicos na?o

usados no modelo: a quilha do cra?ton do Sa?o Francisco e um poss??vel nu?cleo crato?nico abaixo

da regia?o norte da bacia do Parana? (chamado bloco do Paranapanema). Atrasos de tempo

grandes na bacia do Pantanal podem indicar um canal astenosfe?rico mais forte, um fluxo mais

coerente ou uma astenosfera mais espessa. Pequenos atrasos abaixo da parte norte da bacia do

Parana? e no centro do cra?ton da Amazo?nia podem indicar uma astenosfera mais fina.

Introduction

1.1 Thesis Organization

This M. Sc. dissertation is formatted into four chapters. Chapter One provides the background

information for the project, which includes information on seismic velocity anisotropy, shear

wave splitting, the shear wave splitting methodology used herein, and a discussion on two layer

anisotropy. Chapter Two is a paper submitted to the Journal of Geophysical International and

is currently under revision, to be published shortly. This paper covers the main shear wave

splitting results and discussion at the southeast part of stable South America. Because Chapter

Two is meant to be a self-containing journal article, some information such as Results and

Discussion is stated solely in that chapter. Additional work has been done since the manuscript

submission, with more stations analyzed in the northern part of Brazil, and these results will be

included in Chapter Three. Chapter Four is a conclusion, of the results from Chapter Two plus

the additional results of Chapter Three, plus a summary of the achievements and propositions

for future work. An Appendix is supplied, with a table of results, and additional figures.

2 Chapter 1. Introduction

1.2 Overview of Project

We present shear wave splitting (SWS) results of the southeast stable area of South America,

including the Pantanal, Parana? and Chaco-Parana? basins as part of the FAPESP ”3-Basins

Thematic Project”. We used a new package called SplitRacer, by Reiss and Ru?mpker (2017)

to perform seismic anisotropy measurements using the Transverse Component Minimization

method (Silver and Chan, 1991). The results obtained herein complete the anisotropy map

of South America in areas not sampled before and make it possible to better understand our

tectonic history and patterns of upper mantle flow. To do so, our measurements are compared

to different anisotropy proxies: absolute plate motion given by the hotspot reference frame HS3-

NUVEL-1A, upper mantle flow induced by the Nazca plate subduction (Hu, Faccenda, and Liu,

2017), global anisotropy from surface wave tomography (Debayle, Dubuffet, and Durand, 2016)

and geologic trends.

1.3 Seismic Anisotropy in the Upper Mantle

Seismic anisotropy is the dependence of elastic wave velocity on propagation direction and

polarization orientation. One of the most common causes of anisotropy in the mantle is preferred

alignment of crystals such as olivine (the most common mineral in the upper mantle) to create

lattice preferred orientation (LPO) (Isma??l and Mainprice, 1998).

LPO textures are created when crystals within a polycrystalline aggregate are preferentially

aligned by an externally imposed deformation mechanism (e.g. Figure 1.1) (Li, Di Leo, and

Ribe, 2014). Dislocation creep is commonly presumed to be the dominant mechanism for LPO

fabric (Long and Silver, 2009; Savage1999SeismicSplitting), although additional deforma-

tion mechanisms such as grain boundary sliding, dislocation glide, and diffusion creep may also

play a role in causing upper mantle anisotropy (Li, Di Leo, and Ribe, 2014).

In an anisotropic medium with LPO, a seismic wave will travel faster parallel to the a-axis

of the olivine and slower if it is perpendicular to that axis (Figure 1.2). Since olivine is one



1.3. Seismic Anisotropy in the Upper Mantle 3

Figure 1.1: Illustration of the creation of olivine LPO at mid-ocean ridges. The a-axis of the
olivine crystals tends to align with the lineation direction, in the foliation plane. Therefore,
with the flow directions perpendicular to the ridge direction, maximum P- and S-wave seismic
velocities are observed in the spreading directions parallel to the a-axis, and minimum velocities
in the ridge direction.

of the main minerals in the upper mantle, and xenolith studies show that for typical mantle

conditions it contributes the most to seismic anisotropy (Zhang and Karato, 1995), it is usually

assumed that olivine LPO is the primary source of observed anisotropy (Silver and Chan, 1991;

Zhang and Karato, 1995; Silver, 1996). LPO can provide information regarding strain and

deformation processes in the upper mantle.

a-axis is equivalent to [100] direction, where both P and S velocities are higher compared to the
[010] and [001] directions (b and c axes). Figure modified from Stein and Wysession (2002).



4 Chapter 1. Introduction

The observed SWS can be due to anisotropy in the lithospheric mantle (called ”frozen” anisotropy),

due to past tectonic processes (Silver and Chan, 1991; Silver, 1996), or in the asthenosphere

due to present mantle flow (Vinnik et al., 1992). It is now believed that both lithospheric and

asthenospheric anisotropies can be present in the same region (Martha Savage, 1999; Silver and

Savage, 1994).

Although not studied here, seismic anisotropy can also be observed in other regions within the

Earth, such as the transition zone (Karato, 1998), the lower mantle, the D” layer (Kendall

and Silver, 1996), and the inner core (Morelli, Dziewonski, and Woodhouse, 1986). Anisotropy

in the upper crust can also be formed by the process of shape preferred orientation of cracks

(due to stresses) (Crampin, 1987), or preferred mineral alignment in metamorphic fabric (e.g.

Nascimento, Bezerra, and Takeya (2004)). The contribution of crustal anisotropy to SKS

splitting is usually very small (? 0.1 s), and is usually ignored in studies of mantle anisotropy.

1.4 Shear Wave Splitting

The most common method to measure the effect of anisotropy is shear wave splitting (SWS).

This phenomenon is analogous to optical birefringence and occurs when a seismic shear wave

encounters an anisotropic medium (e.g., LPO fabric of olivine) (Martha Savage, 1999). Upon

encountering an anisotropic medium, the shear wave is split into two orthogonally polarized

waves traveling at different velocities, one faster and one slower, orthogonal wave Figure 1.3

(Silver, 1996; Long and Silver, 2009). The splitting is characterized by two parameters:

? = fast orientation (1.1)

?t = delay time (1.2)

which refer to the polarization orientation of the first-arriving “fast” split shear wave and the

time difference between the two polarized shear waves, respectively. The fast axis orientation



1.4. Shear Wave Splitting 5

is sensitive to the geometry of the anisotropic fabric and the split time is proportional to the

thickness and intensity of the anisotropic layer (Silver and Chan, 1991). A null measurement

is one where splitting cannot be detected for one of four reasons: there is no splitting or the

polarization of the XKS wave is parallel or perpendicular to the orientation of the olivine

foliation plane. A different and more complex type of anisotropy, such as orientations varying

with depth, or tilted fast axes of the olivine crystals (Baptiste and Tommasi, 2014).

Figure 1.3: Representation of a shear wave passing through an anisotropic medium. The align-
ment of anisotropic minerals, as olivine, will cause the waves to split, with the fast component
aligned to olivine foliation plane, and a time difference relative to the thickness and intensity
of the anisotropic layer.

To perform shear wave splitting analysis we use core-refracted seismic wave phases as SKS,

SKKS, and PKS (hereafter named as XKS, Figure 1.4). Teleseismic XKS are used in SWS

analyses because they are radially polarized when they are converted from a compressional (P)

wave to a vertical shear (SV) wave at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). This radial polarization

at the CMB removes all source-side effects and therefore, all measured anisotropy comes from

the path of the receiver side (Silver and Chan, 1991; Long and Silver, 2009). Moreover, XKS

phases travel in a nearly vertical direction through the mantle, which simplifies the analysis

but makes it difficult to resolve the depth at which the measured anisotropy is occurring (Long

and Silver, 2009).



6 Chapter 1. Introduction

Figure 1.4: Ray paths of a shear wave and a core refracted shear wave. When the tele-
seismic core refracted shear wave (SKS in this case) crosses the CMB it removes all source
side anisotropy. When it encounters an anisotropic medium beneath the station, shear wave
splitting will occur.

1.5 Transverse Component Minimization Method

Due to conversion from P to SV wave at the CMB, in the absence of an anisotropic layer, the

XKS is assumed to arrive at the seismic station with energy only in the radial component. The

transverse component minimization method, introduced by Silver and Chan (1991), attempts to

reverse the effects of splitting by finding the pair of anisotropy parameters that best minimizes

the energy on the transverse component (that is assumed to be propagating in a near vertical

direction upwards from the source to the station) using an inverse splitting operator Figure 1.5.

In order to carry out the Silver and Chan (1991) method we require observations of shear

waves as inputs. In an isotropic, homogeneous medium a shear wave can be written as a vector

function:

u(?) = A(?)exp[?i?To] (1.3)



1.5. Transverse Component Minimization Method 7

where, as specified by Walsh, Arnold, and Savage (2013):

? = angular frequency

u(?) = isotropic shear wave vector

A(?) = w(?)A?(?) complex amplitude vector

w(?) = ?A(?)? norm of the amplitude with angular frequency ?

T0 = time at which the wave arrives at the surface

To represent the propagation coordinates (P), a right handed set of orthogonal vectors [p?b?a?]

Figure 1.5: The transverse component minimization method finds the pair of parameters ? and
?t that best removes the energy on the transverse component seismogram. On the first window
is shown a typical ellipsoidal XKS wave particle motion that have crossed an anisotropic layer.

plot is linearized.

are defined. The three orthogonal vectors that define this coordinate system are

b? = propagation vector

p? = polarisation vector pointing in the direction of shear wave displacement

a? = b? × p?



8 Chapter 1. Introduction

Silver and Chan (1991) assume that waves (for all frequencies ?) displace in the same direction

p?. Therefore the complex amplitude vector A(?) can be approximated by replacing A?(?) with

p? for all ?. Therefore Equation 1.3 is rewritten as:

u(?) = w(?)exp[?i?To]p? (1.4)

The splitting due to anisotropy is modeled as the geometrical operations of projecting p? onto the

fast and slow polarization directions fast f? and slow s?, and then time shift these two components

by ?t/2 (earlier) and ??t/2 (later) respectively. The process of producing a split shear wave

can be represented as the application of the splitting operator:

? ? exp[i??t/2]ff? + exp[?i??t/2]s?s (1.5)

to the wave equation, with the resulting split waveform:

us(?) = w(?)exp[?i?To]?(?,?t)p? (1.6)

where ? is the angle between f? and p?. Defining the tensor

?T = ?t/2(ff? ? s?s) (1.7)

? can be more compactly written as

? = exp[i??T (?,?t)] (1.8)

in analogy with the isotropic case Equation 1.4.

We want to estimate the parameters ? and ?t. To do so, we perform a grid search over all

possible pairs of ? and ?t and choose the pair that most nearly returns Equation 1.6 into

the form Equation 1.4 by reversing the geometrical operations, that is, search for the inverse

operator ??1. This operator is unitary, therefore the inverse is the complex conjugate ??. The

method assumes a single layer of anisotropy and that two of the three symmetry axes lie in the

of this method has been made with the aid of the SplitRacer package by (Reiss and Ru?mpker,

2017). Figure 1.6 shows an example of SWS analyses.

1.5.1 Two Layer Anisotropy

When using the Transverse Component Minimization method, it is assumed that there is a

single homogeneous layer of anisotropy under the receiver (Silver and Chan, 1991). In this way,

the anisotropy parameters ? and ?t have no variation with incident angle and back-azimuth,

Figure 1.7: Distribution of splitting parameters with back-azimuth obtained from AQDB
station, BL network. When many measurements do not show large variation with back-azimuth,
they can be averaged together.

However, in some cases these assumptions do not represent the reality, and the parameters

may have a dependence with back-azimuth. For example, dipping symmetry will have 2?

periodicity with back-azimuth, and if two anisotropic layers are present, the splitting parameters

will have a ?/2 periodicity with back-azimuth. Silver and Savage (1994) have shown that

the splitting parameters obtained assuming a one layer anisotropy (here referred as apparent

splitting parameters) are still meaningful, and that there are simple trigonometric functions to

relate them to the 2-layer parameters ?1, ?t1, ?2 and ?t2. Silver and Savage (1994) define the

parameters: ?1,2 = 2?1,2, where ?1,2 is the angle between the initial polarization (back-azimuth)

?p and the fast polarization orientation of the layer (1,2), and ?1,2 = ??t1,2/2. Now they define

ap, ap?, Cc e Cs by:

ap = cos?1cos?2 ?sin?1sin?2cos(?2 ??1) (1.9)

ap? = ?sin?1sin?2sin(?2 ??1) (1.10)

Cc = cos?1sin?2cos?2 + cos?2sin?1cos?1 (1.11)

Cs = cos?1sin?2sin?2 + cos?2sin?1sin?1 (1.12)

This group of equations provide the direct method of using the 2-layer parameters to find the

1 layer apparent parameters. The SplitRacer (Reiss and Ru?mpker, 2017) package used in this

work to calculate the 1 layer anisotropy parameters also provides the tools to perform the

Figure 1.8: Comparison of a a) the two top graphs are the 1-layer fit of the two anisotropy

station PTGB, BL network. Because a large number of events are at the back-azimuthal range
from 220? to 250?, these measurements have a higher contribution to the fit in both cases.

There are many situations where more than one layer is present, and in a stable continental

region, it is common to exist both fossil anisotropy in the lithosphere, as well as anisotropy

associated with upper mantle flow in the asthenosphere (Silver and Chan, 1991; Silver and

Savage, 1994).



12 Chapter 1. Introduction

Among the stations analyzed in this study there are many that exhibit signs of a more complex

form of anisotropy in the form of disperse measurements that can not be well fitted by one

single value of ? and ?t (such as station PTGB in Figure 1.8). Some attempts have been made

to find a 2-layer anisotropy case, and they will be discussed in Chapter 3. For most cases, due

to poor back-azimuthal distribution of the events, a clear 2-layer case could not be identified

and a single layer of anisotropy fitted the data well.

Mantle Anisotropy and Asthenospheric Flow Around

Cratons in Southeastern South America

Abstract

Upper mantle seismic anisotropy is one of the most important means to study
dynamics of the Earth’s interior. It has been extensively used to infer past
and present mantle dynamics and continental evolution. Seismic anisotropy
in the upper mantle can be measured by the method of shear wave split-
ting (SWS) of core refracted phases, such as SKS. Previous studies of SWS
in South America concentrated mainly along the Andes and in southeast
Brazil. Now we add extra measurements in the area of the Pantanal and
Chaco-Parana? basins, as part of the FAPESP “3-Basins” thematic project.
With the splitting results of 47 new stations, we have a more complete and
robust anisotropy map of the South America stable platform. On average,
over most of the mid plate continent, the fast polarizations have an aver-
age E-W orientation, which is close to the absolute plate motion given by
the hotspot reference model HS3-NUVEL-1A (median deviation of 15.7?).
However, recent models of subduction induced mantle flow beneath South
America provide a better explanation for the fast orientations (median de-
viation of ?12?). Nevertheless, detailed analyses of the fast orientations
indicate an additional component of mantle flow deviating from the cra-
tonic blocks, at the Sa?o Francisco and Amazon cratons, and beneath the
Parana? basin (called Paranapanema block). Large delay times may indicate
a strong asthenospheric channel, a more coherent flow, or a thicker astheno-
sphere, between the Paranapanema block and the Amazon craton. Similarly,
small delay times may indicate thinner anisotropic asthenosphere beneath
the Paranapanema block.

1. Introduction1

The study of seismic anisotropy beneath continents, particularly in stable2
areas, yields important constraints on past and present tectonic processes,3
and helps understanding patterns of sub-lithospheric mantle flow, in a way4
that cannot be achieved by other geophysical methods. Shear wave split-5
ting is now a standard method for studying seismic anisotropy in the upper6
mantle, consisting of local measurements at individual stations. The result-7
ing splitting parameters are usually interpreted as due to preferred mineral8
alignment, which could reflect mantle flow directions related to present-day9
plate motions and/or ”fossil” deformation preserved in the lithospheric man-10

Seismic anisotropy is the dependence of wave speed on the direction12
of seismic polarization and wave propagation. A shear wave propagating13
through an anisotropic medium is split into two orthogonal quasi-shear waves,14
one traveling faster than the other (Silver, 1996). The polarization orienta-15
tion of the fast component is usually named fast polarization orientation (?)16
of anisotropy. The two waves travel at different speeds; therefore, a delay17
time (?t) is observed between the “fast” and “slow” components when they18
arrive at the station. The amount of delay time depends on the thickness of19
the anisotropic layer and/or the strength of anisotropy. When there is a delay20
time between the fast and slow components of core refracted phases, such as21
SKS, SKKS and PKS phases (here nominated XKS), they will exhibit some22
energy on the tangential component producing an elliptical particle motion.23
Analyses of the fast polarization orientation (?) and delay time (?t) provide24
simple measurements that characterize seismic anisotropy directly beneath25
the receiving seismic station.26

Fast polarization directions measured by shear wave splitting (SWS) are27
related to lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of anisotropic minerals (es-28
pecially olivine), caused by shear deformation in the mantle (Silver, 1996).29
Studies of mantle xenoliths show that anisotropy can be as high as 7 % (Isma?l30
and Mainprice, 1998). Deformation through dislocation creep (crystalline31
dislocations within grains) is needed to cause preferred mineral orientation,32
and it occurs with high stress, large grain size, or both (Savage, 1999).33

believed that anisotropy is formed by the alignment of fast propagation ori-38

with absolute plate motion (APM) models, under the assumption that the42

Initial studies in SWS in Southeast Brazil indicated strong correlation of50
fast orientations with geological trends (James and Assumpc?a?o, 1996; Heintz51
et al., 2003). However, later studies in a larger region (Assumpc?a?o et al.,52
2006);(Assumpc?a?o et al., 2011) tended to favor upper mantle flow around53
cratonic roots, with fossil anisotropy restricted to few localized areas. Here54
we expanded the shear wave splitting measurements further to the west with55
newly installed stations (Figure 1) to have a more complete regional pattern.56

Our results reveal that the Sa?o Francisco and Amazon cratons, and an57
anomalous high velocity block in the Parana? basin, interpreted as a cratonic58
nucleus (Mantovani et al., 2005), modulate the anisotropy orientation by59
diverting mantle flow.60

2. Geological Setting61

2.1. Parana? Basin62

The Parana? basin of southern Brazil (Figure 1 - contour in brown) is63
a typical Paleozoic intracratonic basin and hosts one of the largest igneous64
provinces of the world c1,the Cretaceous Serra Geral Formationc2 (Milani and c1 Text added.

De Wit, 2008). The central and northern parts of the basin have been studied66
by passive seismology in the past 20 years, but little is known of the upper67
mantle structure in the west of the basin, especially in Paraguay, NE Ar-68
gentina, and beneath the Chaco Basin. In some areas, the lithosphere could69
be up to 200 km thick, as revealed by the compilation of Steinberger and70
Becker (2016). Julia? et al. (2008) used receiver function and Rayleigh-wave71

18



dispersion to confirm that the basin sediments are underlain by a predomi-72
nantly cratonic nucleus (Mantovani et al., 2005; Cordani, 1984), and mafic73
underplating only occurred under selected sites, possibly channeled between74
fragmented cratonic roots as seen in the model of Milani and Ramos (2017).75

Previous measurements of SWS in this area are scarce (Assumpc?a?o et al.,76
2011), and show a trend of small delays with a general E-W fast direction,77
which has been mainly correlated with the absolute plate motion directions78
in the HS3-NUVEL-1A frame (Gripp and Gordon, 2002).79

2.2. Pantanal Basin80

The Pantanal basin (Figure 1 - Pt) is a shallow (?400m), Quaternary81
basin between the deep intracratonic Parana? basin and the sub-Andean82
basins (Assine and Soares, 2004). Both regional (Feng et al., 2007) and global83
(Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013) tomography models show a strong S-wave low-84
velocity anomaly in the upper mantle (100-300 km depth), concentrated at85
the basin and continuing to the NE in the Tocantins Province. Ussami et al.86
(1999) proposed that the formation and subsidence of the basin resulted from87
extensional flexural stresses due to the Andean load, in a migrating foreland88
bulge. However, seismicity in the Pantanal basin is characterized by shal-89
low, reverse faulting events (Dias et al., 2016), which makes subsidence due90
to flexural extension unlikely. Studies of SWS may help better understand91

mechanism of this Quaternary Basin.93
Again, previous measurements (Assumpc?a?o et al., 2011) in this area have94

poor coverage, due to a lack of stations. Assumpc?a?o et al. (2006, 2011)95

3. Data and Method101

A 3-year experiment (called “3-Basins” experiment, for short) deployed 35102
temporary stations, with an average station spacing of 400 km, to study the103
crust and upper mantle structure beneath the Pantanal, Parana? and Chaco-104
Parana? Basins (Figure 1). Here we show the first SWS results from this105
experiment together with data from the permanent Brazilian Seismographic106

Figure 2 shows an example of splitting analysis for an event recorded at130
station ITAB. The SplitRacer package uses a grid search for the splitting131
parameters (?) and (?t) carried out to minimize the energy on the transverse132
component, after removing the anisotropy effect. This is done within a time133
window initially chosen around the phase and is repeated for 50 random134
window variations (Figure 2-a,b). The results for each time window are135
then plotted in histograms (Figure 2-c), which are used to calculate mean136
splitting parameters and to check the consistency of the results. Errors are137

21



calculated with 95 % confidence levels from the F-test as in Silver and Chan138
(1991) (Figure 2-f,g). Based on clear phase arrivals, particle motion plots,139
histogram distribution, error and percentage of transverse energy reduction,140
we classify the results as good, average, poor or null.141

After application of the inverse splitting operator on the XKS phase,142
the elliptical particle motion should become linear (Figure 2-e), and the his-143
togram should show one clear peak for each parameter. If the anisotropy144
correction does not lead to linearization of the particle motion, the event is145
classified as poor and not used in the analyses. When the wave arrives at the146
anisotropic layer with polarization perpendicular or parallel to the fast-axis147
direction, the wave is not split, and thus, arrives without transverse energy.148
These measurements are called nulls, and they can also represent complex149
anisotropic structures as discussed by Bastow et al. (2015). When there is150
a clear phase arrival, but no energy on the transverse component and both151
the particle motions from before and after the inversion are linear, the event152
is classified as null. In this case, the energy grid shows 95% confidence levels153
usually along the whole delay-time axis, at two narrow values of fast orien-154
tations, corresponding to the back-azimuth and its perpendicular direction.155

the Fiji islands, and covers back-azimuths from 215? to 245?. In fewer cases,166
there are events from Alaska (290? to 340?), and from the Mediterranean167
(40? to 60?). At some stations (Fig. S20), it seems that the anisotropy is168
more complex than a single layer model, and the 2-layer model could fit the169
data better. Yet, it has not been observed in this study any case where a two170
layers of anisotropy can be considered conclusively. At stations with a larger171
variability of the parameters with back-azimuth, a simple mean of all events172
was calculated (Table S1.) c6At the stations where the one layer model fitted

on all of them, resulting in a more robust pair of splitting parameters (Fig-176
ure 3-d,e,f). The corrected transverse components are concatenated so that177
the sum of the energy on all transverse components is used in the grid search178
for the splitting parameters. This approach significantly reduces the influ-179
ence of noise and increases the robustness of the splitting results, avoiding180
over-interpretation of single-phase results (Reiss and Ru?mpker, 2017). The181
application of the inverse splitting parameters should lead to a linearization182
of the particle motions of all waveforms, and then a single layer of anisotropy183
explains the observations.c8 c8 Nevertheless, it

is possible that due
to a poor

ence of regional lithospheric topography is hardly observed. There is a overall209
E-W trend, which match our orientations, specially at the northern Parana210
basin, at the Pantanal basin and at the Amazon craton. Moreover, the direc-211
tions at the keel of the SFC have the same SW trend. At the southern Chaco-212
Parana basin the SWS orientations have a slight ESE rotation, tending to the213
NW-SE orientation shown by the surface wave anisotropy directions.The fact214
that our measurements correlate better with surface wave anisotropy at 300215

4.3. Comparison with Lithospheric Depths239

We now discuss possible relations between the fast SWS orientation with240
a thick lithospheric block beneath the northern part of the Parana? basin.241
The positive and negative S-wave anomalies derived from the surface-wave242
tomography, shown in Figure 5 (Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013) are a qual-243
itative indication of the depth of the lithosphere. As we wish to check if244
variations in the lithospheric thickness are influencing the flow directions in245
the asthenosphere, we compare our results with the tomography anomalies246
at 150 km depth and with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a few247
stations obtained with S-wave receiver function (Heit et al., 2007). c1We c1 Labels of stations

find that the thickest lithosphere (160 km) at station BDFB corresponds to249
+5% S-wave anomaly at 150 km depth. The thin part of the lithosphere (?250
80 km at CPUP) is associated with an S-wave anomaly value of only 1%.251
In the Parana? Basin, a stack of 10 temporary stations showed an average252
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary of 120 km depth, which is consistent253
with about 4.5% S-wave anomalies. This means that the S-wave velocity254
anomaly at 150 km depth can be used as a rough proxy for the lithospheric255
thickness. We have three separate main deep lithospheric roots: one at the256
southern part of the Amazon craton, one at the Sa?o Francisco craton, and one257
in the NE part of the Parana? basin. The positive anomaly in the tomogra-258
phy in the Parana? basin corresponds roughly to the cratonic block defined by259
Cordani (1984), based on radiometric dates and geological evidences. Man-260
tovani et al. (2005) used gravity data to delimit this cratonic block, calling it261
Paranapanema block (Figure 5-in dashed pink). c2Considering that the posi- c2 Text added.262
tive anomalies correspond to thicker lithospheres, we observe an ENE-WSW263
trend of the SWS orientations from the Pantanal basin to the Tocantins264
Province, north of the thick lithosphere of the Paranapanema block. Like-265
wise, there is an ESE-WNW orientation group south of the Paranapanema266
thick lithosphere. Therefore, we consider that c3the main contribution to the c3 frozen anisotropy

plays a minor role
in the observed
SWS, and

267

fast polarization orientations comes from asthenospheric flow and flow mod-268
ulation due to lithosphere thickness variation at cratonic keels, especially269
around the SFC (Assumpc?a?o et al., 2006), and the Amazon cratons. The270
suggested flow surrounding the Paranapanema block in the Parana? basin, as271
will be shown below.272

4.4. Comparison with Mantle Flow273

The SKS splitting observed at the surface is the compound effect of the274
passage of the shear wave through a complex series of anisotropic layers in the275

30



upper mantle. Comparing the fast orientation with any single parameter can276
be an over-simplification of heterogeneous and complex structure. However,277
it is useful to compare the fast orientations with some simple proxies for the278
anisotropy effect in an attempt to get insight into the main contribution to279
the observed shear wave splitting.280

In this section we compare our SWS results with three different proxies281
of anisotropy: absolute plate motion with respect to the deep mantle (hot282
spot reference frame NUVEL1A-HS3), convection velocity c1and computed c1 Text added.283
LPO, with respect to the overriding South American plate from the model284

flow driven by the evolution of the Nazca plate subduction since the Mid-287
Cretaceous. Conrad et al. (2007), Assumpc?a?o et al. (2011) and Miller and288
Becker (2012) had already compared their results with mantle flow models.289
However, these studies only utilized instantaneous mantle flow models. A290
time-dependent flow is needed to better predict seismic anisotropy, due to the291
long term response of anisotropic minerals to the cumulative strain (Ribe,292
1992). This recent convection model depends on the subduction history293
and slab geometry and should better represent the real Earth, compared to294
models based on tomography images or parameterized slab geometry (Hu295
et al., 2017). c5To compute the strain-induced LPO directions of the mineral c5 Text added.296
aggregates, the model calculates transverse isotropy, i.e. TI axis from full297

with the direction of maximum stretching and fastest seismic velocity, and299

depth for the Amazon craton, with a thickness of 250 km. We compare SWS308
directions with the mantle velocity and LPO directions at different depths;309
150 km, 200 km, 250 km and 300 km (Fig. S22). Both models do not show310
large variation of the directions with depths at the continental stable region,311
with all directions close to E-W, on average. For having a better correla-312
tion with our measurements across the entire study area (Fig. S23), the313

31



directions at 250 km depth were chosen for comparison. Figure 7 shows the314

the simplistic APM. Our measurements also agree with mantle flow around321
the Amazon craton, as predicted by the model of Hu et al. (2017), as seen322
in Figure 5. Further south, however, especially in the Pantanal Basin, the323
observed SWS fast orientations tend to be ENE-WSW, deviating from the324
general ESE-WNW predicted orientations in Figure 7. We propose that the325
observed ENE-WSW orientation may be due to flow surrounding the Parana-326

from the Paranapanema block, we calculate the difference between the LPO328
model directions and our results. Values within a ±10? difference are taken329
as in good agreement with the proposed model and are plotted in gray in330
Figure 9. The measurements with a difference higher than 10? clockwise,331
are plotted in red and the measurements with a difference more than 10?332
anticlockwise are plotted in blue. South of the Parana? deep lithospheric333
block the fast orientation tend to deviate away (clockwise) from it. To the334
northwest, especially in the Pantanal basin, the fast orientations deviate an-335
ticlockwise, with respect with the model of Hu et al. (2017). We propose that336
these deviations show mantle flow deflected by the deep structures below the337
Paranapanema block, as we can see in Figure 9. All the three main structures338
(Amazon and Sa?o Francisco cratons and the Paranapanema block) seem to339
be diverting the flow in between them. Assumpc?a?o et al. (2006) proposed340
that the anisotropy orientations indicate flow around the keel of the Sa?o341
Francisco craton. Here, we add that the Paranapanema block also deviates342
mantle flow.343

The geometry of the Paranapanema block is not known in detail. Differ-344
ent geological and geophysical models have been proposed (Cordani, 1984;345
Mantovani et al., 2005; Milani and Ramos, 2017). Different studies of surface346
wave tomography tend to show large velocities beneath the northern part of347
the Parana? basin, but with different geometries. The regional tomography348
of Feng et al. (2007) shows two high velocities in the northern part of the349
Parana? basin and a separate high velocity keel in the southern part of the350
Sa?o Francisco craton Figure 9-b. The proposal of Assumpc?a?o et al. (2006)351
of mantle flow around SFC was based on this keel. The global tomography352
model SL2013sv (Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013) Figure 9-a, on the other hand,353
does not have resolution to separate these two keels.354

We also observe different areas of large and small delays. Large delay355
times are observed in the Pantanal basin and may indicate a strong astheno-356
spheric channel, a more coherent flow, or a thicker asthenosphere. Further357
to the northeast, large delays seem to predominate between the Sa?o Fran-358

34



cisco ad Amazon cratons. Small delays are generally observed beneath areas359
with thick lithosphere, such as the Amazon craton, and the Paranapanema360
block. This may indicate thinner anisotropic asthenosphere, consistent with361
the model of Hu et al. (2017) c1, or a different and more complex type of c1 Text added.362
anisotropy, such as orientations varying with depth, or tilted fast axes of the363
olivine crystals (Baptiste and Tommasi, 2014).c2 c2 We add a new

interpretation of
small delay times,
as suggested by
reviewer 1.

364

The SFC geometry used in the mantle flow calculation of Hu et al. (2017),365
did not significantly change the estimated SWS orientations. For this reason,366
the model version used in Figure 8, Figure 7 and Figure 9 does not include367
the SFC. We propose that the addition of a deep keel in southern part of368
the SFC and the Paranapanema block should improve the fit to the observed369
orientations.370

directions are plotted as red bars. Deviations more than 10? anticlockwise are shown as
blue bars. Colors indicate S-wave velocity anomalies at 150 km depth from two different
tomography models: a) SL2013Sv global model of Schaeffer and Lebedev (2013), b) the
regional model of Feng et al. (2007).

5. Conclusions371

In this work we present new measurements of shear wave splitting in372
the Parana? and Pantanal basins, SE Brazil, in c1an area not well sampled c1 Text added.373
before. In general, considering the previous and new results in the continental374
midplate South America, the fast polarization orientations have an average E-375

36



W trend, previously related with the absolute plate motion directions (HS3-376
NUVEL1A). Our results show that the subduction-induced, time dependent377
flow model of Hu et al. (2017) provides a much better explanation for the378
SWS observations, which is seen using two proxies: convection velocity and379
LPO at 250 km depth. The observed orientations are also consistent with380
the flow around the Amazon craton, predicted by their model. c2 c3Our mea- c2 We also support

the existence of a
cratonic block
under the Parana
basin, the
Paranapanema
block, which diverts
mantle flow. The
small delay times
observed in the
Paranapanema
block seem to be
typical of other
cratonic areas.

surements are consistent with the proposition of cratonic block under the382
Parana basin, the Paranapanema block, proposed previously, diverting flow383
around it.384

Fig. S 2: Misalignment check at station ITQB. This measure is made based on the difference between
the orientation of the ellipse drawn by the XKS particle motion and the back-azimuth. This station
showed a mean misalignment of -16? which matched the misalignment measured with P-wave particle
motions by Bianchi, 2016. For misalignments larger than ± 10? the correction was applied.

2.3 All measurements per station: Averaged for 1 layer

This plot helps the reader to visualize where 1 layer or other form of complex
anisotropy should be considered. Despite the large variation of the anisotropy
parameters with back-azimuth at some stations (see stations ITRB and PTGB,
for example) we considered that the 1 layer assumption fitted well the data,
and that there is not enough evidence of a 2 layer case. Where only null mea-
surements where found, no anisotropy parameter is calculated. For all these
stations, there is not sufficient data to assume if these are ”null” stations with
no anisotropy on the wave path.

Chapter 3

Additional Results and Discussion

Beyond the results presented at Chapter 2, now we add 20 new measurements at the northern

part of Brazil from 10? S to 5? N in an area poorly sampled before. The new measurements also

have a general ENE-WSW pattern, with some stations deviating to a ESE-WNW orientation.

Furthermore, stations in northwestern Brazil (not plotted here), and northeastern Brazil mainly

have null results, as already observed by Bastow et al. (2015). We first compare the SWS fast

orientations with the surface wave azimuthal global anisotropy orientations at 300 km depth

from Debayle, Dubuffet, and Durand (2016), Figure 3.1.

There is some similarity between the orientations at the northern and western boundaries, with

all SWS orientations tending to be ENE-WSW and the surface wave anisotropy orientations

with a more accentuated NE-SW orientation. These areas have less influence of the lithospheric

thickness variation caused by the cratons, and the surface wave anisotropy orientations reflect

mainly the large scale mantle flow direction at 300 km depth. Therefore, the SWS orientations

at these regions may be due only to upper mantle flow. At the central part of northern Brazil,

the SWS orientations do not correlate with the surface wave anisotropy orientations, meaning

that a smaller scale change in anisotropy is present. Figure 3.2 we see the main basement faults

mapped at Brazilian territory by CPRM (Brazilian Geological Services). Beyond the general

ENE-WSW orientations of the SWS measurements, a second pattern of orientations trending

ESE-WNW is present (blue circles in Figure 3.2) which may correlate with some of the SW-NE

major fault orientation of the basement.

In these areas, the SWS anisotropy directions may be due only to frozen anisotropy imprinted

at the lithosphere, from past tectonic events, or they can be a compound effect of the astheno-

spheric anisotropy, generated by mantle flow, plus the lithospheric frozen anisotropy. Baptiste

and Tommasi (2014) argues that small delays and null SWS measurements may result from

vertical variations of seismic anisotropy, which could be the reason of the observed small delays

and many null results in northern Brazil.



3.1. Comparison with Different Anisotropy Proxies 67

Blue ellipses are the areas where the SWS measurements show a general ESE-WNE direction.
In few stations there is a indicative of agreement of the SWS orientation with the direction of

3.1 Comparison with Different Anisotropy Proxies

In this section we compare all SWS measurements of this study with three different proxies of

anisotropy: convection velocity, computed LPO directions from TI axis, and predicted SWS,

all from the model of Hu, Faccenda, and Liu (2017), shown in Figure 3.3.

LPO and velocity models were already discussed at Chapter 2. To calculate the synthetic SKS

splitting, Hu, Faccenda, and Liu (2017) use the software package FSTRACK from Becker et al.

(2006). The code gathers the elastic tensors of all upper mantle aggregates and stack them

into layers below the station. Synthetic seismograms are calculated for various azimuths and

distances, and filtered to the XKS frequency band of 0.1 to 0.3 Hz. Finally, the XKS splitting

parameters are determined by the cross correlation method of Menke and Levin (2003).

We calculate the orientation difference of mantle velocity, LPO orientation and synthetic SWS

3.2. Two Layer Anisotropy 69

with all SWS measurements of this study in the histograms of Figure 3.3. The median misfit

values are 11.8? , 11.9? and 18.9? respectively. The addition of the new data did not make a big

change in the median values of the difference between the SWS measurements and the velocity

and LPO proxies. However we note that in the Amazon region, the SWS anisotropy orientations

and delays correlate slightly better with the mantle velocity directions and intensities, compared

with LPO (Figure 3.3-a,b). We also show that the synthetic SWS direction do not provide a

good fit to the data (Figure 3.3-c), although it should be the best estimate, theoretically.

Perhaps, this worse misfit suggests higher uncertainties in the calculation of the synthetic SKS

fast directions in Hu, Faccenda, and Liu (2017).

3.2 Two Layer Anisotropy

We now test the 2-layer anisotropy model at stations that showed larger variation of the

anisotropy parameters with back-azimuth (Figure 3.4). Moreover, they had to exhibit a good

back-azimuthal distribution, so that the ?/2 periodicity could be observed. Figure 3.5 shows

the 1-layer and 2-layer anisotropy parameter found at each station. Black bars are the orienta-

tions of the lower layer of the 2-layer model, purple bars are the directions of the upper layer,

and bars in green are the orientations of the 1-layer model. The length of the bars indicates

the delay time. We want to compare whether these directions correlate with lithospheric frozen

anisotropy, which can be related to the fault alignment trend observed at the surface, and with

asthenospheric properties, such as mantle velocity and LPO alignment.

At station PDRB both models show a SW-NE orientation. However both the lower and upper

layer have similar orientations of the nearby faults. At this station frozen anisotropy could have

a larger contribution than asthesnospheric flow. This could be due to a thin asthenosphere

below a thick craton. At station VBST the lower layer has the same orientation as the surface

wave anisotropy and upper layer in the same orientation as the mantle flow. At station SALB

the lower layer has a orientation close to the mantle velocity orientation, and the upper layer

has the same orientation of the local fault trend. Finally, at station PTGB the lower layer

structures (as shown by the comparison with the basement fault trends), now we have some

indication of frozen lithospheric anisotropy at the central part of northern Brazil, with a general

NW-SE trend. In addition, we now compare all the new data with the directions of mantle

flow velocity, computed LPO and synthetic SKS from the model of Hu, Faccenda, and Liu

(2017). The addition of the SWS measurements of the northern region did not significantly

change the fit to the mantle flow velocities and computed LPO (median misfit of ? 12? ,

Figure 3.3). We also tested a 2-layer model for a few stations, and by comparing these results

with different mantle models and basement fault directions we find that stations SALB and

PTGB show some evidence of a 2-layer anisotropy, with the lower layer orientations having a

better correlation with the mantle velocity directions. Altogether the Amazon region does not

have enough stations with good measurements for a clear definition of the anisotropy pattern.

More stations and data are necessary for a more conclusive interpretation.

Conclusion

4.1 Final Conclusions

In this work we present new measurements of shear wave splitting in Brazil and some neigh-

boring countries, in areas not well sampled before. In general, considering the previous and

new results in the continental midplate South America, the fast polarization orientations have

an average E-W trend, previously related with the absolute plate motion directions (HS3-

NUVEL1A). Our results show that the subduction-induced, time dependent flow model of Hu

et. al., (2017), provides a much better explanation for the SWS observations, which is seen

using three proxies: convection time dependent mantle velocity and computed LPO from TI

axis at 250 km depth. We also compare the results with the computed SWS directions of Hu

et. al., (2017), however those do not provide a good fit to the data. Most observed orientations

are consistent with the flow around the Amazon craton, predicted by their model. We also

support the existence of a cratonic block under the Parana? basin, the Paranapanema block,

which diverts mantle flow. The small delay times observed in the Paranapanema block seem

to be typical of other cratonic areas, such as the Amazon craton.

4.2 Summary of Achievements

During these two years of M.Sc. research, several activities and achievements have been de-

veloped. Beyond the paper entitled ”Mantle Anisotropy and Asthenospheric Flow Around

Cratons in Southeastern South America” presented here as body of this dissertation, this work

has been presented at two conferences. On the 21st of April of 2017 this work was presented as

the poster ”Asthenospheric Flow Around the Parana? Basin Cratonic Nucleus Measured with

SKS splitting” at the ”XXVII Reunio?n Cient??fica de la Asociacio?n Argentina de Geof??sicos y

Geodestas” in La Plata, Argentina, and was awarded as the best poster presentation of the

Earth’s Interior Thematic Section. And on the 14th of November of 2017 ”Mantle Anisotropy

And Asthenospheric Flow Around Cratons In Southeastern South America” was presented at

the II Simpo?sio Brasileiro de Sismologia at Joa?o Pessoa, Brazil. Moreover, an abstract enti-

tled ”SKS Seismic Anisotropy Observations in Mid-Plate South America: Investigating Mantle

Flow and Effects of Cratonic Keels” has been accepted at this year’s Seismology of the Americas

meeting at Miami, US.

4.3 Future Work

The Brazilian Seismographic Network now counts with a large number of stations and high

amount of data. This dissertation can serve as an initial study of the anisotropy in the stable

South American platform, and with more data availability and focus in this area, expanding

on these findings will be crucial to our understanding of the region in depth.

Although a single horizontal layer of anisotropy is a common simplified hypothesis in shear

wave splitting studies, one makes significant assumptions about the orientation and symmetry

of anisotropy, while also simplifying the XKS ray paths as being vertically incident. Given

the variability of the shear wave splitting measurements in this area, we can say that there

are regions where a more detailed study, focusing on the analyses of other anisotropic models

can reveal anisotropic structures not yet observed. The stations in Brazil and the stations of

the temporary FAPESP ”3-Basin” deployment provide a unique opportunity to test different



4.3. Future Work 75

models of anisotropy forming mechanisms in the vicinity of a cratonic margin. It is plausible

to assume that there are both a lithospheric and an asthenospheric components to the upper

mantle anisotropy. Therefore, a natural recommendation for future work is to expand the

interpretations to these more complex anisotropy scenarios. Older stations with larger datasets

should provide enough back-azimuthal coverage to effectively test the 2-layer hypothesis or even

other more complex anisotropic structures.
