The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is a 
global public health problem that affects both sexes and all 
age groups, especially women in reproductive age1. Currently 
65% of the population in the world lives in countries in 
which obesity causes more deaths than malnutrition2. 
Moreover, the induced-high fat diet (HFD) maternal obesity 
has risen dramatically over the past 20 years, by nearly 42% 
in African-Americans and 29% in Caucasians3. Within this 

context, fetuses and newborns are increasingly  exposed to 
maternal HFD which may cause problems in growth and 
brain deve lopment4. However, few stu dies ha  ve investigated 
the effects of maternal HFD on the brain  development of the 
offspring5,6, particularly isolating or separating the periods 
of pregnancy and lactation. On the other hand, most studies 
have evalua ted the effects of maternal obesity or HFD intake 
along gestation and lactation, hindering the identification of

AbstrAct:
The maternal exposure to high fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy and breastfeeding have been considered an important inducer of alterations 
in offspring normal programming, both in animals and humans, and may disturb brain development. In the present study we investigated the 
somatic and sensory-motor development of the offspring from rat dams fed a HFD, compared with dams fed a control diet, during pregnancy 
or lactation. Indicators of the body growth, physical maturation, and reflex ontogeny were evaluated. Offspring of dams fed a HFD showed 
reduced weight and body growth, delayed physical maturation, and delayed maturation of the physiological reflexes, such as vibrissa placing, 
auditory startle response, and free-fall righting. Our findings suggest that maternal HFD during pregnancy or lactation modifies somatic and 
neurological development of the offspring, possibly increasing the risk of neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life.

Keywords: high fat diet, pregnancy, lactation, somatic growth, reflex ontogeny, offspring.

resuMo:
A exposição materna a dieta rica em gordura (DRG) durante a gravidez e a amamentação tem sido considerada um importante indutor de 
alterações da programação normal da prole, em animais e humanos, e pode atrapalhar o desenvolvimento do cérebro. No presente estudo, 
investigamos o desenvolvimento somático e sensório-motor da prole de ratas alimentadas com uma DRG, em comparação com ratas ali-
mentadas com uma dieta controle, durante a gravidez ou lactação. Foram avaliados indicadores de crescimento corporal, maturação física e 
ontogênese de reflexos. A prole de ratas alimentadas com DRG mostrou redução de peso e crescimento do corpo, atraso da maturação física 
e maturação tardia de reflexos fisiológicos, tais como colocação pelas vibrissas, resposta ao susto e reação de aceleração. Nossos resulta-
dos sugerem que DRG materna durante a gravidez ou lactação modifica desenvolvimento somático e neurológico da prole, possivelmente 
aumentando o risco para distúrbios neuroendócrinos e neuropsiquiátricos mais tarde na vida.

Palavras-chave: dieta rica em gordura, gravidez, amamentação, desenvolvimento somático, ontogênese de reflexos, prole.

the “best window” for  altering developmental or physiologi-
cal programming7,8. In addition, according to epidemiologi-
cal and experimental studies, nutritional status and/or ma-
ternal nutrition du ring prenatal and early postnatal periods 
play an important role in epigenetic mechanisms involved 
in the developmental origins of non-communicable disea-
se, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes 
and cardiovascular disorders9-11, and phenotypic plasticity 
in response to environmental cues9-11. Furthermore, recent 
studies have demonstrated that the offspring from dams fed 
chronically with an HFD during the pregnancy and/or lac-
tation showed changes in the hippocampal development, 
with decreased neurogenesis, apoptosis and neuronal dif-
ferentiation5, and also neurobehavioral changes related to 
the serotonergic and gabaergic neurotransmitter systems6. 
Therefore, dietary factors may produce synaptic changes 
during development, similar to neurotoxins, possibly con-
tributing to the increased incidence of neurodevelopmental 
disorders12. Thus, the aim of the present study was to experi-
mentally investigate the effects of the maternal HFD during 
pregnancy or lactation periods on somatic and neurological 
development of the offspring.

MetHoD

Animals and diets
Virgin female albino Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), (60 

days old) were taken from the colony of the Department of 
Biosciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo (Campus Baixada 
Santista). Before and during the mating, the females were fed 
ad libitum with control diet (CD - standard laboratory chow ; 
52.2% carbohydrate, 23.0% protein and 14.7% lipids – Nuvilab  
– Nuvital Nutrientes S/A; Curitiba, Parana, Brazil). Mating 
was performed by housing females with adult males over-
night, and pregnancy was confirmed by exami ning vaginal 

smears for the presence of sperm, designated as the day of 
conception, day 0 of pregnancy. Pregnant females were ran-
domly divided and maintained in individual polypropy lene 
cages in a room at 22°C±1°C with lights on from 6:00 a.m. to 
6:00 p.m. Thus, the dams were fed with CD or high fat diet 
(HFD - standard laboratory chow enriched with lard mainly, 
a few soybean oil and casein; 20.9% carbohydrate, 27.1% pro-
tein and 52.0% lipids) during the pregnancy (P - Experiment 
1; 1st to 21st prenatal day) or lactation (L - Experiment 2; 1st to 
21st postnatal day). The maternal body weight was recorded 
during the pregnancy (Figure 1A) and lactation (Figure 1B). 
Body weight was  obtained with an electronic scale (Marte, 
model S-100) with a sensitivity of 0.01g. The chemical com-
position of both  diets was outlined in Table 1. Twenty-four 
hours after birth (the birth day was considered post-natal 
day zero, PND 0), male and female pups born in the same 
date, from different mothers, were randomly distributed in 
litters of eight pups per dam. The pups were accessed from 
each reconstituted (randomized) litter, in order to prevent 
inbreeding. Each pup was labeled with a mark of methyl vio-
let solution on the skin, for identification during the experi-
ment. Seventy-two male Wistar rat pups (9 litters; 8 pups/
dam/litter), weighing between 6 and 7 g were distributed into 
four different groups according to maternal diet and deve-
lopment period: offspring from dams fed a CD or HFD during 
the pregnancy [groups (1) CD-P (n=16) and (2) HFD-P (n=24) 
- Experiment 1] or lactation [groups (3) CD-L (n=15) and (4) 
HFD-L (n=17) - Experiment 2]. The pups were weaned on 
21st post-natal day (PND 21) and separated according to sex. 
After weaning all offspring were fed control diet. 

The experimental design of the present study is illustra-
ted in Figure 2. The litters (not each pup individually) were 
daily (PND 1 to PND 21) separated from their mothers always 
between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. for evaluation of somatic 
growth, physical features maturation and reflex ontogeny. 
During this period of daily testing sessions, the pups were

maintained under the same environmental conditions of ma-
ternal living, aiming to minimize the effects of maternal se-
paration and handling. The body weight of the pups was also 
measured in adulthood (PND 70 to PND 95), aiming to verify 
the late effects of maternal HFD, during pregnancy or lacta-
tion, on nutritional status of the adult offspring. In addition, 

two observers, who were blinded to the treatment condi-
tions, did all the neurodevelopmental scoring. 

The experimental procedures obeyed the international 
norms of handling, care and experimentation with animals 
that were established by International Guiding Principles 
for Biomedical Research Involving Animals and approved by 
the Commission of Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the 
Federal University of Sao Paulo, Santos, SP, Brazil (protocol 
number CEP 0968/11).

somatic growth
Somatic growth was assessed by measuring body weight 

and length, medio-lateral and anteroposterior head axes 
measurements13. These measurements were made in each 
animal, from PND 1 to PND 21 between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 
p.m. as follows. The body weight was measured with an elec-
tronic scale (Marte, model S-100) with a sensitivity of 0.01 g. 
The longitudinal body growth (distance between the snout 
and the base tail), as well as medio-lateral head axis (MLHA 
— distance between the ear holes) and the anteroposterior 
head axis (APHA - distance between snout and head-neck ar-
ticulation) were measured with a digital caliper (STAINLESS 
HARDENED, 05 mm precision).

Physical features maturation
The observations of the physical features13 were made and 

carried out daily from PND 1 to PND 21 between 10:00 a.m. 
and 12:00 a.m. during the suckling period. The following  phys-
ical features were observed: unfolding of the external pinnae 
of both ears to the fully erect position;  auditory conduit ope-
ning — internal auditory conduit opening of both ears; inci-
sor eruption — the first visible and palpable crest of the lower

incisors; and eye opening — when any visible break in the 
cove ring membrane of both eyes was detected. Maturation 
age of a particular feature was defined as the day when it oc-
curred for the first time.

reflex testing
The reflex tests13,14 were carried out daily from PND 1 to 

PND 21 (Table 2). Testing and observation were conducted 
between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. The progress of the indi-
viduals was followed throughout the whole experiment. The 
time of appearance for each reflex was defined to be the first 
day of its occurrence. Reflex maturation was measured by 
registration of the age (days after birth) in which the reflex 
was expressed for the first time. An exception was the palm 
grasp, which was recorded the day of disappearance as a sign 
of maturation.

statistical analysis 
For statistical analysis, data related to the somatic 

growth (body weight and length, medio-lateral and ante-
roposterior head-axes) were analyzed by two-way repea-
ted-measures ANOVA. Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used. 
Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for data related to 
body weight of the adult rat offspring, physical features 
ma      turation and reflex testing. All data are expressed as 
means±standard deviation (SD). The level of significance was  
set at P&lt;0.05. 

resuLts

somatic growth 
The body weight at birth of the offspring from HFD-P 

dams was 8% lower than controls (6.38±0.43 g vs. 6.93±0.69 g, 
respectively) (P&lt;0.005) and the body mass difference was 
maintained throughout suckling (Figure 3A - Experiment 1). 
Furthermore, pups from HFD-L dams showed smaller body 

weight gain (P=0.001) from PND 7 (13.51±0.70) to PND 21 
(43.05±3.08) when compared with controls (16.98±4.11 and 
49.87±8.10, respectively) (Figure 3B - Experiment 2). On the 
other hand, HFD adult offspring showed 11 to 19% (HFD-P 
group, P=0.001) and 9 to 23% (HFD-L group) (P=0.001) higher 
body weight, when compared with controls (Figure 4 - Ex-
periments 1 and 2). 

The offsprings suckled by HFD fed dams during preg-
nancy showed lesser length than controls starting PND 
11 (78.66±1.24 g vs. 84.12±1.78 g, respectively) (P=0.001). 
Reduced growth was observed throughout the lactation pe-
riod (P=0.034) (Figure 3C - Experiment 1). In addition, the ne-
onates breastfed by mothers exposed to HFD during lacta-
tion showed growth deficit from PND 4 to PND 5 (P=0.001) 
and from PND 7 to PND 18 (P=0.001). However, shortly be-
fore weaning, this difference disappeared (Figure 3D - Experi-
ment 2). The MLHA were reduced from PND 10 to PND 16 
(P&lt;0.04) in the offspring from HFD-P dams and from PND 
4 to PND 21 (P=0.001) in the pups from HFD-L dams, com-
pared with controls (Figure 3E and F - Experiments 1 and 2).  
Interestingly, in the weaning, the HFD-P offspring showed 
MLHA higher than controls (20.10±0.43 g vs. 19.72±0.88 g, res-
pectively (P=0.014). Besides, the APHA were also decreased 
throughout the su ckling for both HFD offspring (P=0.001) 
(Figure 3G and H - Experiments 1 and 2). 

Physical features maturation and reflex testing
For physical features maturation, the HFD-P offspring 

were delayed in respect to auditory conduit opening (P=0.001), 
and eruption of lower and upper incisors (P=0.020). On 
the other hand, all the parameters evaluated for physical 
features maturation in the HFD-L offspring were  delayed 
(P=0.001) when compared to controls pups (Table 3 - Ex -
periments 1 and 2). 

Similarly, the reflex ontogeny of pups from both HFD fed 
dams during pregnancy or lactation were delayed in most 
reflexes (P&lt;0.002), vibrissa placing, startle response, free fall

In the present study, maternal HFD during the pregnan-
cy (Experiment 1) or lactation (Experiment 2) induced chan-
ges in somatic and neurological development, promoting: 1. 
Reduced body weight and length early in life; 2. Overweight 
later in life; 3. Altered head growth; 4. Delayed reflex onto-
geny; and 5. Delayed acquisition of mature developmental 
patterns of physical features. These changes are similar to 
those observed in the offspring of undernourished mothers14 
and opposite to those observed in dams with overnutrition15. 

Several clinical and experimental studies have shown 
that prenatal (intrauterine) and early postnatal maternal nu-
trition have a significant role on food intake, body weight 
and energy homeostasis of the offspring16,17. Pups of dams 
fed HFD during pregnancy and lactation showed low birth 
weight and reduced body weight during lactation, compa-
red with controls16,18. According to Niculesco and Lupu [5], 
high fat diet-induced maternal obesity has impaired the 
intraute rine growth as determined by the low weight fetus. 
The results of the present study are in line with previous in-
vestigations, since the HFD offspring had reduced weight at 
birth (only HFD-P; Experiment 1) and throughout lactation 
(HFD-P and HFD-L; Experiments 1 and 2).

Moreover, the HFD pups in both experiments showed al-
tered development of body length and cranial axes. Recent 
experimental studies have demonstrated the influence of

prenatal and early postnatal maternal nutrition on the off-
spring’s body and cranial growth15. In this context, pups 
from dams fed low protein diet showed reduced skull axes19, 
whereas the offspring from mother fed with hypercaloric 
ve getable oils supplemented diets during gestation and 
 lactation showed shortened body length15. Thus, during ges-
tation and/or lactation, the high saturated fat intake may be 
as harmful to the developing pups as undernutrition. In ad-
dition, the dam rats fed with lard supplemented diets did not 
show significant increases in body weight during the preg-
nancy or suckling, despite more intakes of calories from fat 
in the HFD. Other results have suggested that pregnant rats 
on a fat-enriched diet reduce their ingestion to maintain 
similar caloric intake compared with controls20. Keesey and 
Hirvonen21 proposed the existence of a “body weight set-
point” in rodents and humans so that body weight decrease 
or increase is corrected by altering food intake and energy ex-
penditure to maintain the target body weight. Although this 
weight-control mechanism was not investigated in the pres-
ent study, it could explain the lack of significant effects on 
dam body weight.

The growth deficiencies (body weight and length, and 
head axes) that we observed in offspring from dams fed 
HFD could be due to abnormalities of mammary gland 
function. In fact, Flint et al. observed that dams fed HFD 
showed impaired mammary development and lactogene -
sis22. HFD-induced changes observed in mammary gland 
include: 1. Abnormalities in alveolar development; 2. Lipid 
 ac   cu mulation in the secretory epithelial cells, indicative of an 
absence of copious milk secretion; 3. Decreased mRNA ex-
pression for ?-casein and ?-lactalbumin immediately post-
partum; and 4. Reduced breast milk volume, a compensation 
mechanism due to high-energy diet22. These findings suggest 
that, despite access to high-energy diet, dams fed HFD pro-
duce an insufficient volume of breast milk which is also de-
ficient in proteins. These abnormalities may underlie the im-
paired development of the offspring.

Interestingly, we observed that the offspring of dams fed 
HFD showed reduced body weight curves in early life and 
overweight later in life. Several studies support this finding.  
Pups from female rats fed HFD during pregnancy  and suck-
ling had low birth weight and reduced plasma leptin in PND 
2, but became obese and showed increased plasma leptin 
in adulthood23. Moreover, adult offspring from mothers fed 
HFD (during the same periods) showed hypertension, hyper-
cholesterolemia, hyperphagia, overweight, increased visceral 
fat, liver weight, blood glucose and triglycerides7-11. These ab-
normalities could be associa ted with alterations of hypotha-
lamic development. The central role of the hypo thalamus in 
controlling food intake is well re cognized. Ne vertheless, the 
hypothalamus has been considered to have a role in altering 
physiological programming, particularly associated to early 
nutritional manipulation17. Furthermore, the prenatal and 

early postnatal periods are critical for regulation of expres-
sion of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides and their re-
ceptors, which also can be programmed by factors related to 
maternal diet24. Therefore we believe that overweight in the 
adult HFD offspring observed in the present study may be as-
sociated with alterations of hypothalamic development.

The offspring of dams fed HFD also showed some adverse 
effects in physical and neurobehavioral outcomes, including 
altered development of all studied physical features (except 
ear unfolding and eyes opening to HFD-P group), palm grasp 
reflex (only HFD-P group), vibrissa placing, startle response, 
negative geotaxis (only HFD-L group), and free fall righting. 
These findings suggest impairment of sensory-motor sys-
tem and may reflect a vulnerability of the developing brain 
to changes in maternal diet. Accordingly, many authors have 
shown that the importance of maternal overnutrition for fe-
tal and newborn brain development is increasingly recog-
nized. Studies have suggested that maternal obesity or ma-
ternal exposure to HFDs, during pregnancy and lactation 
periods, may permanently alter brain structure and function 
in the offspring5,6 and this change could affect the sensory-
motor development.

Moreover, the results of the present work corroborate 
those of Soares et al.25 that observed delayed somatic and re-
flex development in suckling rats from dams fed with keto-
genic diet associated with lack of protein. In other study, the 
offspring from dams fed with vegetable oils supplemented 
diets (soy and sunflower oils) during gestation and lactation 
showed delayed puberty onset and poor cliff avoidance be-
havior15, partly corroborating our results. The authors of that 
study observed some beneficial effects on physical and reflex 
maturation15. However, the beneficial effects were associa-
ted with the maternal high intake of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (w-6 and w-3), unlike our findings, because we used lard 
(saturated fatty acids) as source of fat. These results suggest 
that different types of maternal HFD may produce different 
effects on offspring development.

The placenta plays a crucial role in the transport of bioac-
tive molecules from mother to fetus26. Maternal lipids can 
be transferred across the placenta and are accumulated in 
the brain and other organs during fetal development27. On 
the other hand, also more interestingly, changes in dietary 
fat content modify milk lipid content and daily milk lipid 
production in lactating animals28. It seems that in both si-
tuations the offspring’s brain development may be vulnerable 
to the effects of lipotoxicity or lipid peroxidation induced by 
maternal high-fat intake3. In addition, the lipotoxicity resul-
ting from maternal HFD is capable of activating a number 
of stress signaling cascades including pro-inflammatory cy-
tokines and oxidative stress3,8, which can damage the neuro-
development of the offspring5. In this context, some experi-
mental studies have demonstrated: 1. Reduced proliferation 
of hippocampal dentate gyrus progenitor cells (pH3-labeled 



143Cristiano Mendes-da-Silva et al. Sensory-motor development and nutritional programming

cells)5; 2. Decreased apoptosis and neuronal differentiation in 
specific hippocampal areas5; and 3. Morphofunctional chan-
ges of gabaergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems6. 
In studies Sullivan et al.29 Raibstein-and Peleg et al.6 were 
demonstrated up-regulation of the 5-HT1A inhibitory auto-
receptor in the offspring of dams fed HFD. In the first29, the 
authors observed increased expression of 5-HT1A receptors 
in the dorsal raphe nucleus in nonhuman primates. On the  
other hand, in the second study researchers showed ex-
pression high of 5-HT1A in ventral hippocampus. These neu-
rochemical changes can promote suppression of the se-
rotonergic system in the offspring HFD, since the 5-HT1A 

auto-receptor inhibits the release of serotonin6,29 and thus 
perhaps result in the sensory and motor disorders found in 
the present paper. This set of results and findings indicate 
that prenatal and/or early postnatal exposure to HFD may 
impair brain development, possibly affecting sensory and 
motor functions. 

 Results of the present study suggest that lipotoxicity  
induced by maternal HFD may affect the cerebellum and 
vestibular system. In fact, the reflex  ontogeny reflects 
 sensory-motor development and integrity of vestibulocere-
bellar system, which integrate exteroceptive input (vibris-
sae) and locomotor output30, and may be affected by nutri-
tional manipulations31. In general, since neonatal reflexes 

may be considered as an index of brain maturation, the pre-
sent findings reinforce the notion that maternal nutrition af-
fects prenatal and early postnatal mechanisms responsible 
for normal brain development14,15,25. In another hypothesis, 
perhaps the delay in the somatic and neurobehavioral de-
velopment of the offspring HFD may be related to neural 
stem cells (NSCs) loss due to the effect of pro-inflammatory 
induced by early exposure to high-fat diet, as evidenced hy-
pothalamic NSCs32. 

In summary, the present study demonstrates that mater-
nal HFD during gestation or lactation impaired similarly the 
somatic and neurological development of the offspring, wi-
thout significant differences between prenatal and postnatal 
manipulation. This neurodevelopmental damage may reflect 
in neuropsychiatric disorders later in life, such as psychomo-
tor, behavioral and cognitive disturbances5,6,25. Nevertheless, 
further studies are needed to better elucidate the underlying 
neural and molecular mechanisms involved in this process.
