ABSTRACT 
 

Several cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-6 and IL-12, involved in inflammatory 

immune responses, have been described as relevant on the modulation of 

hematopoiesis. However, the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10, has 

not yet been addressed. We used genetically modified mice that over-express 

IL-10 under the control of a zinc inducible promoter, PMT-10 mice, to address 

this question.  

We show that over-expression of IL-10 led to a splenomegaly, with 

increase of total number of cell numbers and the appearance of 

megakarycocytes. Interestingly, we observed a substantial increase in myeloid 

cells and a decrease in B-lineage cells both in the spleen and the bone marrow 

(BM) upon IL-10 over-expression. Furthermore 30 days after induction of IL-10 

expression, a severe reduction in lymphoid precursors and an expansion of 

myeloid precursors was observed in the BM. Collectively, our data suggest that 

IL-10 over-expression impacts hematopoiesis, inhibiting the differentiation of B 

cells and stimulating the differentiation of the myeloid lineage.   

Moreover, the phenotype observed after IL-10 over-expression is similar 

to that seen in human patients and in mouse models of myeloproliferative 

disorders (MPD), namely polycythemia vera (PV), thrombocythemia (ET) and 

primary myelofibrosis (PMF).  

MPD are frequently caused by mutations on the JAK2 gene, which are 

present in 90% of patients with PV and 50% of the patients suffering from ET or 

PMF (11). Based on the epidemiology of MPD and on the phenotype observed 

for IL-10 over-expressing mice, we hypothesize that increased IL-10 may 

associate with susceptibility to MPD, explaining the 10 - 50% of cases unrelated 

to the JAK2V617F mutation. Therefore, PMT-10 mice are of potential interest as 

a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms leading to MPD, in the 

context of non-mutated JAK2. In future we will explore these possibilities, as 

well as the mechanism by which IL-10 interferes with hematopoiesis.

RESUMO 
 

As citoquinas envolvidas na resposta imune inflamatória, tal como a 

Interleucina (IL)-3, IL-6 e IL-12, possuem um papel de grande relevância na 

modulação da hematopoiese. Contudo o papel de citoquinas anti-inflamatórias, 

como a IL-10, não foi ainda esclarecido. Usando ratinhos geneticamente 

modificados que sobre expressam a IL-10 sob o controlo de um promotor 

activado por zinco – murganhos PMT10 – obtivemos evidências que sugerem 

que essa sobre expressão de IL-10 tem um impacto a nível da hematopoiese, 

inibindo a diferenciação das células B e estimulando a diferenciação da 

linhagem mielóide. 

 Os nossos dados preliminares indicam que os ratinhos PMT10 sujeitos 

ao tratamento de zinco apresentam uma esplenomegalia quando comparados 

com os grupos controlo, sendo esse aumento acompanhado de uma 

desorganização estrutural do baço. Conjuntamente, o número total de células 

no baço aumenta, alterando a proporção normal das diferentes populações 

celulares aí residentes. Apesar de o número total de células na medula 

permanecer inalterado, tanto a percentagem como o número de células das 

diferentes populações é alterado.  

Este perfil é semelhante ao perfil observado nas Doenças 

Mieloproliferativas, nomeadamente, policitemia vera (PV), trombocitemia (ET) e 

mielofibrose primária (PMF). Uma mutação adquirida no gene JAK2 – 

JAK2V617F – é encontrada em 90% dos casos de PV, e em 50% dos pacientes 

que sofrem de ET ou PMF. Está descrito na literatura que a IL-10 sinaliza via 

JAK/STAT. Com base nisso, propomos a IL-10 como um bom candidato para 

explicar os outro 10-50% de casos não relacionados com a mutação JAK2V617F 

e, os ratinhos PMT10 como um potencial novo modelo de estudo de doenças 

mieloproliferativas.

1.1 Hematopoiesis  

	
  

 Hematopoiesis is a continuous and regulated process that ensures 

differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into mature blood cells, 

maintaining homeostasis and guaranteeing protection against pathogens [1-3]. 

Blood cells have a short life, being constantly renewed through proliferation of 

immature cells in the hematopoietic organs. Differentiation of HSCs occurs in 

fetal liver, spleen, liver, thymus, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) but, 

throughout adulthood it occurs mainly in the BM [1, 3, 4]. 

The HSCs have the ability to repopulate the hematopoietic tissues as 

well as of maintaining themselves but, when they undergo differentiation, they 

give rise to a progeny that progressively loses it self-renewal capacity and 

becomes restricted to one lineage [1-3, 5]. It is believed that the decision of self-

renewal versus differentiation, with loss of potential for differentiation into other 

cell fates [1-4, 6-11], is random whereas the later differentiation would be 

determined by signals delivered by the stromal microenvironment [2]. The 

identification of stem and progenitor cells by Weissman and collaborators [6, 10, 

12-15] led to the construction of a hematopoietic lineage tree that is 

characterized by a cascade of binary decisions. In the BM investigators 

identified a common progenitor for all lymphoid lineages, the common lymphoid 

progenitors (CLP) [10], as well as a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) that 

generates granulocytic and macrophages (GM) [6]. The observation that CMPs 

and CLPs derived from adult BM generate mutually exclusive progeny [6, 10] 

suggests that their diversification represents the earliest branching point during 

hematopoietic differentiation. CLPs give rise to pro-B and pro-T cells, 

uncommitted lymphoid progenitors that will differentiate further into mature B 

and T cells [10]. GM and Megakaryocyte (Meg) lineages give rise to 

granulocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK), and megakaryocytes 

and erythrocytes, respectively [6]. The offspring of GM also includes 

neutrophils, eosinophils, and possibly basophils/mast cells [16, 17].  

Unlike all other lineages, which are specified in the BM, T cells 

differentiate after migration of early progenitors into the thymus [18]. 

Interestingly, was also found that CLPs are able to origin NK lineage cells [10].

Curiously, functionally equivalent and phenotypically indistinguishable myeloid 

and lymphoid dendritic cells (DCs) can be derived from either CMPs or CLPs 

[19, 20]. A schematic representation of hematopoiesis is in figure 1.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

The establishment of all hematopoietic lineages during development is 

tightly controlled by transcription factors that act in sequential and parallel 

fashions, building lineage-specific networks or circuits [7, 21-23].  Lineage 

commitment can be induced either by extracellular factors, including cytokines, 

direct cell-cell interactions, or other environmental cues [5, 9, 24]. Alternatively, 

intrinsic mechanisms, such as the stochastic upregulation of transcription 

factors, or other regulatory molecules, such as microRNAs can also induce 

lineage commitment [25, 26]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors may either have 

an instructive role and actively induce commitment and differentiation or be 

merely permissive for the outgrowth of pre-committed progenitors by promoting 

cell survival and/or expansion [24].

The role of specific transcription factors in regulating hematopoiesis has 

been addressed in much detail. B cell development requires a complex set of 

transcription factors, namely PU.1, Ikaros, early B cell factor (EBF), E2A, and 

Pax5, and inactivation of any of these factors yields a severe phenotype [27-

31]. The dramatic impairment of B cell development in PU.1-deficient mice has 

been ascribed to lack of expression of the PU.1 target genes IL-7R? and EBF 

[28, 30] because B cell differentiation is impaired in mice deficient for either of 

these genes [29, 31]. Loss of EBF blocks B cell development at the pro-B cell 

stage before initiation of B cell receptor (BCR) rearrangements [29]. A similar 

phenotype was described for E2Adeficient mice [27]. 

Many macrophage- and granulocyte-restricted promoters are regulated 

by PU.1 and/or C/EBP? [32]. These factors cooperate in the regulation of the 

genes encoding the myeloid growth factor receptors MCSFR, G-CSFR, and 

GM-CSFR [32, 33]. Mice deficient in C/EBP? lack neutrophil and eosinophil 

granulocytes, and conditional inactivation in the BM shows the specific absence 

of GMPs and reduced numbers of CMPs, leading to decreased formation of all 

downstream lineages [34, 35]. In GATA-1-deficient embryos, development of 
erythroid cells is blocked early in differentiation, leading to a lethal anemia [36, 

37]. 
Furthermore, several evidences suggest that not only transcription 

factors have regulatory roles in hematopoiesis, but also cytokine receptor 

signalling. The involvement of cytokines in hematopoiesis will be addressed 

more deeply in the next chapter.

1.2 Cytokines and Hematopoiesis 
 

The work of many groups over the past years has uncovered a great 

deal of information regarding the mechanism by which cytokines modulate 

hematopoiesis [5].  Numerous transcription factors are induced by cytokines in 

the microenvironment where lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis are occurring to 

control the expression of cell–specific genes. Early observations show that IL-3 

is a positive regulator of early erythropoiesis causing rapid cell proliferation and 

increased cell survival of myeloid progenitors [38-41], acting also synergistically 

with several other cytokines, such as IL-6 [42, 43] and G-CSF on committed 

and uncommitted myeloid progenitors [44]. It has been shown that IL-7 plays an 

essential role in B cell differentiation, due to the fact this cytokine is uniquely 

able to maintain the expression of EBF in BM derived CLP and cause the 

expansion and survival of committed B cell progenitors (pro-B cell) [45]. 

Lymphopoiesis is accompanied by a severely reduced expression of EBF in 

CLP [46]. Several studies demonstrated that the age-related impairment in BM 

IL-7 impacts also T lymphopoiesis, since in the presence of mutations in IL-7 or 

IL-7R gene result in a dramatic block of T cell development in the thymus [45, 

47-50]. 

  Moreover, it has been established that IL-7 promotes proliferation, 

survival, and development of pro-B cells towards the pre-B cell development 

[51, 52]. Interestingly, a previous study shows that the administration of IL-7 

stimulates the proliferation of the myeloid lineage indirectly by the action of IL-3 

and G-CSF [53]. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-3 expands an early cell 

population in vivo that subsequently requires the action of a later acting factor 

such as GM-CSF to complete its development [54]. GM-CSF also presents an 

important role in cell differentiation since GM-CSF deficiency leads to impaired 

pulmonary homeostasis and increased splenic hematopoietic progenitors, but 

unimpaired steady-state hematopoiesis [55]. Like IL-7, IL-21 has also been 

shown to play a key role in B cell development [56]. However, in contrast to IL-

7, IL-21 exerts its effects not only at early stages of the development, but also at 

later stages, inducing the growth and differentiation of mature B cells into Ig-

secreting plasma cells [57, 58]. IL-6 is able to support emergency 

granulopoiesis in animals that lack G-CSF and GM-CSF, two critical cytokines

necessary for myelopoiesis [59, 60]. Interestingly, has been shown that IL-6 

blocks lymphopoiesis elevating the production of myeloid cells in lupus 

erythematosus [61]. Recent studies show that IL-12 plays a significant role in 

vivo hematopoiesis by suppressing hematopoiesis in the BM, enhancing 

peripheral (splenic) hematopoiesis and mobilizing hematopoietic progenitor 

cells to the peripheral circulation [62, 63]. Other cytokines, such as Type I IFNs, 

are known to strongly inhibit proliferation of pro-B cells and consequently B cell 

development [64]. IFN? in particular, is able to activate dormant HSCs (in vivo), 

by promoting their efficient exit of G0 phase and entrance in the active cell 

cycle, thus stimulating the proliferation of HSCs. However, IFN?R mediated 

signalling is not required for the HSCs function [65].  

 In all the role of cytokines, mainly pro-inflammatory ones, in 

hematopoiesis has been addressed and their contribution to the hematopoietic 

decision there is well established. A schematic representation of this network in

1.3 IL-10: an anti-inflammatory cytokine 
 

IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by many types of immune 

cells, from both lymphoid and myeloid lineages, presenting a central role in 

infection [66].  T cells are an important source of IL-10, since many subsets of T 

cells can produce IL-10, such as Th2 cells, natural regulatory T cells, originated 

in the thymus and inducible regulatory T cells, originated in the periphery [67-

69]. Recently, Th1 and Th17 subsets were also found to produce IL-10 [70-72], 

together with IFN? or IL-17, respectively, when induced by particularly strong 

antigen dose and inflammatory responses, allowing the immune responses to 

be inherently self-regulating [67]. Moreover, IL-10 is produced by monocytes, 

macrophages and DCs upon activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) [73, 74] and 

other pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) [75].  

Most hematopoietic cells express the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) whereby IL-10 

is able to regulate several different steps of the innate and adaptive immunity 

[66]. The IL-10R comprises two subunits, IL-10R1 that is expressed in most 

hematopoietic cells and IL-10R2, which presents a crucial role in the 

recruitment of the signalling molecules Janus Kinase (JAK) [66, 76, 77]. 

Stimulation of IL-10R-expressing cells with IL-10 leads to activation of JAK1 and 

Tyk2, and STATs 1 and 3 [78]. STAT3 is recruited directly to sequences

IL-10 can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, 

IL-6, IL-12 and TNF, as well as the expression of chemokines implicated in the 

recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, T cells and DCs [80]. In addition IL-10 

can affect T cells directly, limiting their capacity to proliferate and produce 

cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN? [81, 82], or promote the differentiation of naïve 

T cells into IL-10-producing regulatory T cells [68]. In contrast, IL-10 also have 

stimulatory effects on mast cells [83, 84] and B cells by upregulating the 

expression of MHC class II molecules and enhancing IgA responses [85]. IL-10 

can induce the recruitment, proliferation and cytotoxic activity of NK cells and 

CD8 T cells [86]. A schematic representation of IL-10 effects is in figure 4.

1.3.1 IL10 in infection 
 

The immune system comprises all structures and processes that provide 

defence against potential pathogens. These defences can be divided into two 

different responses, the innate immunity and the adaptive immunity [87, 88]. 

The key difference between innate and adaptive immune response is the 

promptitude of innate immune response that uses a pre-existent repertory but 

limited of response components. In contrast, the adaptive immunity response 

albeit slow in activation, present the capacity of recognizing a large repertory of 

strange substances and the ability of increasing the effectiveness of the 

response while innate immunity remains constant [87, 88]. As discussed above 

IL-10 is produced during infection by cells of the innate and acquired system, in 

support of an important role throughout the immune response. In myeloid cells

IL-10 is induced following TLR ligation in response to an overabundance of 

pathogen products. The magnitude of IL-10 induction within different myeloid 

cell types has been associated to the relative strength of extracellular related 

kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation [89]. The induction of IL-10 in myeloid cells 

in response to TLR-ligands requires the signalling adaptor molecules MYD88, 

TRIF and numerous indirect pathways mediated by autocrine/paracrine factors 

[69, 90-92]. In addition to IL-10 induction by TLR-dependent stimuli, IL-10 can 

also be induced from innate cells such as DC via TLR-independent stimuli 

including C-type lectin receptors (CLR), via the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) 

dependent pathway [93].  

 

 

1.3.2 IL-10 in disease 
 

IL-10 has an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous disorders 

presenting contradictory effects. IL-10 over-expression is associated with 

several autoimmune disorders, such as Lupus erythematosus and certain 

lymphomas, through the action of its immunosuppressive effects [94-97].  

Moreover, IL-10 deficiency is connected with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, 

Crohn’s disease and untreated patients suffering from multiple slecorosis [98-

101]. Interestingly, associations between IL-10 allelic variations and the risk of 

development of these disorders have been established. For example the IL-10 

polymorphisms, T-3575A, G-2849A and C-2763, that lead to an increase of IL-

10 expression, are associated with an increasing risk observed in patients with 

Lupus erythematosus [102, 103]. Finally, IL-10 also regulates the immune 

responses to pathogens. In this context, excess of IL-10 is often associated with 

chronicity, whereas its absence can cause collateral damage to the host due to 

an excessive uncontrolled pro-inflammatory response [104].  

The pleiotropic effects of IL-10, demonstrated by many [94-100, 105-109] 

has led to a variety of clinical studies to employ recombinant IL-10 or anti-IL-

10R in the treatment of patients with immune mediated diseases [110].

1.3.3 IL-10 in Hematopoiesis 
 
 As mentioned before, most hematopoietic cells express IL-10R, thus are 
potentially targets of IL-10. However, the role of IL-10 in hematopoiesis has not 

been fully addressed. However, there are some evidences, gathered over the 

years, suggesting that IL-10 may influence the hematopoietic process. A 

possible role for IL-10 in hematopoiesis was firstly illustrated, through its 

growth-promoting activity on mast cell, synergistically with IL-3 and IL-4, 

megakaryocytes and multilineage colonies derived from committed progenitors 

and Thy1low SCA1+ [84]. Furthermore, Vlasselaer et al showed, in vitro, that IL-

10 was able to stimulate the production of granulocyte/macrophage colony 

forming unit by blocking the TGF-? synthesis by the osteogenic stroma, 

promoting hematopoiesis in this microenvironment [111, 112]. There are also 

evidences indicating that IL-10 acts synergistically with erythropoietin 

significantly increasing erythroid differentiation and proliferation in vitro [113]. 

Interestingly, a bidirectional effect of IL-10 on early B cell development has 

been reported, by stimulating Flt3 ligand with IL-7, IL-10 can induce pro-B cell 

formation and growth before differentiation into a more mature form (CD19 

expression). On the other hand, IL-10 has been suggested to inhibit the growth 

of pro-B cells after differentiation, expressing CD19 [109].  An inhibitory effect of 

IL-10 on GM-GSF in vitro was reported, suggesting that this cytokine may have 

potential in the treatment of myeloid malignancies that are linked with 

mechanisms underlying GM-GSF deregulation [108].  As detailed in section 2 of 

this thesis, our main goal was to further investigate the role of IL-10 in 

hematopoiesis.

1.4 Deregulation of the hematopoietic process 
 

As mentioned before, normal hematopoiesis is a highly regulated 

process that consists on a strict balance between self-renewal and 

differentiation of HSCs. Numbers and fate decisions made by progenitors 

derived from HSCs must be carefully regulated to sustain large-scale production 

of blood cells. As mentioned before, Interleukins, IFNs and other molecules are 

of great importance in regulating these processes, delivering critical cues to 

HSCs and progenitors.  Several of these molecules have been connected with 

malignancies and are causatively involved in the development of several types 

of hematopoietic disorders such as leukemias, lymphopenias or 

myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) [51, 58, 95-97].   

 Leukemias are a group of heterogeneous neoplastic disorders of white 

blood cells. Based on their origin, myeloid or lymphoid, they can be divided into 

two types. Leukemias traditionally have been designated as acute or chronic, 

based on their untreated course [114]. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a 

malignant clonal disorder of the BM lymphopoietic precursor cells [114]. In T cell 

ALL, progressive medullary and extramedullary accumulations of lymphoblasts 

that lack the potential for differentiation and maturation are present. The 

involvement of IL-7 in T cell ALL through the modulation of cell cycle regulators 

such as cyclins D2 and A has been shown [115]. In acute myeloid leukaemia 

(AML), the BM produces too many early blood cells, that  aberrantly express 

Nuclear factor ?B,  which do not go on to become mature blood cells [114-116]. 

Excessive production of immature myeloid cells ultimately prevents the normal 

production of RBC, resulting in anaemia, and decreased production of platelets 

or thrombocytopenia. [116-118] 

 Due to their possible relation to the data presented in this thesis, MPD 
are detailed in the next sections.

1.4.1 Myeloproliferative Disorders 
 

 MPD embrace several clonal hematologic diseases that are thought to 

rise from a transformation in a HSC [114, 119-121]. The main clinical feature of 

these diseases is the overproduction of mature and functional blood cells [114, 

119, 120]. MPD occur primarily in the BM, but sometimes in the liver and 

spleen. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, myeloid 

neoplasms with 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood (PB) or BM is 

considered to be acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This specific MPD is a result of 

a molecular lesion in the Philadelphia chromosome BCR-ABL gene, which most 

commonly results from the Philadelphia translocation [122]. Evolution to AML 

can also happen, in the context of a previously disorder such as 

myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) or 

myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). In AML, as in ALL, a 

proliferative of blasts in extramedullary site can also occur [114]. 

 The three main MPDs negative for the Philadelphia translocation are 

Polycethemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary 

Myelofibrosis (PMF) [114, 120]. PV is characterized by the massive production 

of mature red blood cells (RBC) in the BM, generally accompanied by an 

increase of megakaryocytes and other members of the myeloid lineage [114, 

119-121].  Erythroid precursors in PV are extremely sensitive to erythropoietin, 

leading to an increase of RBC production [114]. Moreover, precursors in PV are 

more responsive to cytokines such as IL-3, GM-CSF and steel factor. 

Megakaryocytes increase also in the BM although more than 60% of patients 

present endogenous megakaryocytes colony unit formation [114, 120, 123]. As 

a result of the increase in RBC production, an increase of blood viscosity is 

normally observed in these patients, leading to thrombosis and/or bleeding 

[114, 119, 120]. People suffering from PV present a hematocrit between 53% 

and 62% [114], while 43-48% in healthy individuals, being the hematocrit values 

proportional to the number of thrombotic events [119, 124]. Increased platelet 

numbers also contribute to these events. An enlargement of the spleen is also 

common and occurs around 75% of PV cases [114, 123]. This disorder is very 

rare in children and young adult, occurring in a very late stage of life, whereby 



	
  
	
  

15	
  

its prevalence is not very high, surrounding 3-100.000 persons per year in USA 

[114, 123].  

 PMF, in similarly to PV, is caused by an expansion of HSCs in the BM 

[114, 119, 120]. In PMF, cell proliferation is accompanied by a reactive 

nonclonal fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis of the BM [114, 119, 120]. The 

proliferation of HSCs leads to the production of several factors, such as platelet 

derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblastic growth 

factor, causing the fibrosis of the BM [119, 124]. As the BM becomes fibrotic 

and normal hematopoiesis can no longer happen, extramedullary 

hematopoiesis occurs in the spleen – leading to a splenomegaly and liver 

enlargement [121]. As seen in PV, PMF is developed in an advanced stage of 

the adult life. The prevalence of this disorder in the USA is of 1-100.000 

persons per year [123]. 

ET, the last of the BCR-ABL negative MPD, is characterized by a 

constant proliferation of megakaryocytes in the BM, with an increased number 

of PB platelet counts [114, 119]. In this disorder, megakaryocyte progenitors are 

hypersensitive to the action of several cytokines, such as IL-3 and IL-6 [119, 

121]. The increase of platelets leads to a growth of thrombotic and hemorrhagic 

events [119, 121]. A splenomegaly is also common, affecting proximately 30% 

of the patients [114, 119, 121]. Although it can occur at any age ET usually 

affects older people, with most patients diagnosed between ages of 50 and 70 

years. Like PV, ET is a rare disease diagnosed in 3-100.000 persons per year 

in USA [123].  

These three disorders are closely related, sharing many characteristics 

including a hypercellularity of the BM, a propensity to thrombosis and 

haemorrhage and a risk of leukemic transformation in a clinical long term. The 

main criteria for identifying MPDs reside in an initial diagnostic of the PB and 

BM by observing the blast percentage.  Blast cells should be derived when 

possible from 200 cell leukocyte differential counts of the PB smear and 500 cell 

differential counts of all nucleated BM cells on cellular marrow aspirate smears 

stained with Wright-Giemsa or similar stain [114]. Moreover, flow cytometry is 

the method of choice to determine the blast lineage as well as for detecting 

aberrant antigenic profiles. It is essential to determine a baseline karyotype by 

performing a complete cytogenic analysis, as well it is to repeat it when the goal 



	
  
	
  
16	
  

is to judge the response to a therapy or for detecting genetic evolution.  

Additional genetic studies should be guided by the results of the initial 

karyotype, and by the diagnosis suspected based on the clinical, morphological, 

and immunophenotypic studies. In some cases, reverse transcriptase-

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may detect variants of well recognized 

abnormalities, like JAK2, MPL, KIT and GATA1 in MPDs [114, 125-129]. 

A certain number of criteria are required for distinguishing the MPDs 

subtypes not only from each other, but also from reactive granulocytic, 

erythroid, and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia that often mimics myeloproferative 

neoplasms (MPNs). Interestingly, it has been show that in chronic myelogenous 

leukemia (CML), the massive cell proliferation is caused by 

rearrangements/mutations of certain genes that encode surface or 

cytoplasmatic protein tyrosine kinase, that lead a constitutive activation of the 

signal transduction pathways[114, 120, 125-130]. Some of the genetic 

abnormalities that responsible for MPDs, such as the mutated JAK2 or KIT, are 

not specific but provide proof that the proliferation is clonal and thus, when 

present, eliminate further consideration of a reactive process [114, 131]. 

Currently, the most commonly recognized mutation in BCR-ABL negative 

MPDs is JAK2 V617F [120, 129, 130, 132]. This mutation is found in more than 

90% of patients with PV and proximately 50% of those with ET or PMF [114, 

130, 133]. Furthermore, in PV patients that lack this mutation, a similar 

activating JAK2 exon 12 mutation can be found [134], and a small proportion of 

patients with PMF and ET of approximately 10% who lack JAK2 mutation may 

instead demonstrate activating mutations of c-MPL, such as MPL W515K or 

MPL W515L, which produces a protein that responds to a growth factor that 

stimulates platelet production [128, 135, 136].  

 

 

1.4.2 JAK2V617F Mutation 
 

 The JAK family comprises four members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2, 

which share significant structural homology with each other [137, 138]. The 

kinases associate constitutively with a variety of cytokine and hormone 

receptors. JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 are expressed throughout the body, while 



	
  
	
  

17	
  

JAK3 is mainly expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells [137, 138]. Signal 

transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are a family of 

transcription factors that bind as homodimers or heterodimers to recognition 

sites in gene promoters. STATs are the result of seven different genes, STAT1, 

STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STATB and STAT6 [137-139]. STAT proteins 

are selectively phosphorylated by different families of protein kinases. Some 

cytokines which receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine activity rely on the JAK family to 

phosphorylate the STAT proteins [137]. 

Upon binding of the specific ligands to their receptors, JAK kinases are 

rapidly activated and their kinase activities induced, to regulate tyrosine 

phosphorylation of various effectors such as STATs and initiate activation of 

downstream signalling pathways: when phosphorylated STATs dimerize and 

become activated, they lead to the transcription of important genes for cell 

survival, activation and proliferation [137].  The JAK/STAT pathways mediate 

signalling of several membrane receptors such as Interleukins, IFNs and growth 

factors receptors, being the most common cause of abnormal JAK activation a 

deregulated cytokine signalling [139-141]. 

Three of these kinases, namely JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2 have been shown 

to be involved in IL-10 signalling pathway. Finbloom et al observed that IL-10 

treatment of T cell and monocytes resulted in a ligand-induced tyrosine 

phosphorylation of Tyk2 and JAK1 [78]. Furthermore, Gupta et al demonstrated 

recently that the IL-10/IL-10R complex upregulated JAK2 signalling [78, 142].   

 A mutation in the JAK2 gene, consistent of a single point alteration in 

JH2 auto-inhibitory domain, leads to a substitution of the aminoacid 

 valine by phenylalanine at position 617 (V617F), resulting in 

constitutively activated kinase [125, 143].  V617F mutation, as mentioned 

before, is found in a large proportion of people suffering from MPDs.  

 The discovery of this mutation in the JAK2 gene was of great importance 

since its opened new horizons in diagnosis and treatment of MPDs. In fact, 

recent studies using transgenic animals expressing the JAK2V617F mutation 

have brought new insights into the world of MPDs [144, 145], suggesting that 

the chronicity of human MPN may be a reflection of a balance between 

impaired HSCs function and the accumulation of additional mutations, but not 

only from alterations of the HSCs compartment [146-148]. Molecular testing for 



	
  
	
  
18	
  

similar mutations, but in particularly for the JAK2V617F mutation, plays a key role 

in the diagnosis of BCR-ACL negative MPDS as a way of separating neoplastic 

from myeloid proliferations [114].   

 Activating alleles of JAK2, such as JAK2 V617F, are essential to the 

development of MPDs, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors targeting JAK2 

may be therapeutically useful.  Several studies have reported the development 

of new drugs targeting JAK2, such as anagrelide, CYT387 and ruxolitinib [149-

151].  CYT387 has been shown to normalize the hematocrit values, spleen size, 

white cell counts and the physiologic levels of inflammatory cytokines [151] as 

well as ruxolitinib [150]. Interestingly, when in the absence of JAK2 mutations 

these inhibitors are also efficient in improving MPD [149-151].

1.5 Aims 
 

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is 

of great importance, considering that this process is responsible for the 

production of all blood cells and that its deregulation leads to fatal diseases. 

Among the factors regulating hematopoiesis are cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-7 or 

GM-CSF. However, the role of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL-10, in 

hematopoiesis has been less studied. Taking advantage of our IL-10 over-

expressing inducible model, PMT-10, in this thesis we propose to understand 

the role of IL-10 over-expression in hematopoiesis. For that we will: 

 

- Determine the impact of the IL-10 over-expression in the differentiation of 

the different cell lineages; 

 

- Study the mechanisms underlying this differentiation; 

 

- Evaluate the plasticity of our mouse model in recovering from the 

phenotype induced by IL-10 over-expression.

Animals: PMT10 mice on a C57BL/6 background were generated by Drs. 
António G. Castro and Paulo Vieira. A mouse IL-10 cDNA sequence was cloned 

into the p169ZT vector, which carries a sheep metallothioneinc (MT) Ia 

promoter, a ?—globin splice site and a polyadenylation signal. The resulting 

vector – pMT-IL10 – was then injected into C57BL/6 eggs and transgenic 

founders were identified by PCR using MT and IL-10 specific primers. IL-10 

overexpression was induced by giving the mice a 2% sucrose solution with 

50mM of zinf sulfate to the animals. Since the IL-10 promoter is associated with 

a metalloprotein, the presence of zinc (Zn) in the solution induces its activation. 

A group of transgenic littermates were supplied with regular water as a control. 

All animals were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at ICVS. 

 For all experiments, a group of PMT-10 mice was induced to over-

express IL-10 [152] for 30 days. As a control, 3 different groups were used – 

wild type mice exposed or not to Zn and non-treated PMT-10 mice. 

 
ELISA: The concentration of IL-10 in the mice serum was determined by 
immunoassay using the mouse ready-set-go mouse IL-10 ELISA kit 

(eBioscience). 

 
Cell Suspensions: Cell suspensions from the spleen and thymus were 
prepared by removing the organs and meshing them with a syringe pistol in ice-

cold cDMEM (Gibco). BM cell suspensions were prepared by removing the 

femur and tibia and sectioning its extremities. Using a syringe with a needle 

containing cDMEM the BM was flushed through the bones. The spleen, thymus 

and BM suspensions were then gently dispersed through a 40µm pore size 

nylon tissue strainer (BD Biosciences); the resultant cell suspension from the 

spleen, BM and blood was treated with Erythrocyte lysis solution to remove 

residual red blood cells, washed and counted. These cells were used for 

western blot and flow cytometry analysis. 

 
Histological studies: All excised tissues were fixed in 3,7% formaldehyde and 
included in paraffin. Additionally, femurs were decalcified using Biodec R from 

Bio Optica. Sections or the organs (2-4µm) were processed for light microscopic 



	
  
	
  
24	
  

studies after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and analysed using (Olympus 

BX61). 
 
Immunoblotting: Protein extracts were prepared from cell suspensions from 
the spleen and BM by lysis in Lysis Buffer. 40 µg of protein lysates were 

resolved on 10% sodium-docecyl sufalte - 8% acrylamide gels, and transferred 

to a membrane (BioRad trans-blot turbo transfer pack) using Trans-Blot Turbo 

Transfer Starter System. Detection of the total and phosphorylated forms of 

JAK2 was performed using specific antibodies from Cell Signalling. 
 
Blood Smears: Smears were performed using 5 µl of blood removed from the 
tail or eye, fix and stained with Wright Stain (SIGMA). 

 
Microhematocrits: Hematocrit values were measured at different time points 
by collecting of tail or eye blood in heparinised capillary tubes (Hirschman 

Laborgerate). These were then centrifuged at 12000rpm for 6min and RBC 

were compared using a hematocrit gauge. 

 
Separation of Lin- cells: Single cell suspension from the BM were subjected to 
magnetic separation in an AUTOMACS (Mylteni) using antibodies in biotin for 

CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11c, CD11b, NK1.1, CD117, TER-119, B220, CD19 

(Biolegend, eBioscience and BD Pharmingen).  The negative fraction – Lin- 

fraction – was then analysed through flow cytometry to determine the 

expression SCA1, c-Kit, Fc?R and CD34 (Biolegend, eBioscience and BD 

Pharmingen). 
 
Flow cytometry analysis: Immunofluorescence staining was performed to 
determine the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD11c, CD19, B220, 

GR1 and Ly6G ((Biolegend, eBioscience and BD Pharmingen) on cell 

suspensions from the blood, spleen, BM and thymus. Lin- cell suspension from 

the BM was stained with specific antibodies for SCA1, c-Kit, Fc?R and CD34. In 

brief, 1x106 cells were incubated for 10 min at 4ºC with Fcblock (Biolegend) in 

FACs buffer. Cells were then stained with primary antibodies for 30 min at 4ºC.

Cells were analysed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer and 

data analysed using FlowJo 7.6 software.

significance was calculated using one way ANOVA. Values of p?0.05 were 

considered significant.

3.1 Characterization of PMT-10 mice 
 

 PMT-10 mice are transgenic modified animals able to over-express IL-10 

under the control of a Zn-inducible sheep-metallothionein protein [152]. With the 

goal of characterizing the general features of PMT-10 mice under Zn 

administration, a group of PMT-10 mice was induced to over-express IL-10 for 

30 days, the approximate period of time it takes to renewal the hematopoietic 

cells in the peripheral blood. IL-10 promoter was induced by administering, in 

the drinking water, a solution of Zn sulphate to PMT-10 mice. As a control, 3 

different groups were used – wild type (WT) mice exposed or not to Zn and non-

exposed PMT-10 mice (figure 5). 
 

 

 

	
  

	
  

	
  

 

 

 

3.1.1 IL-10 kinetics in Zn treated PMT-10 mice 
 

 In order to confirm that Zn treated PMT-10 mice were over-expressing IL-

10 we measured the amounts of seric IL-10 by immunoassay, as shown in 

figure 6. The levels of IL-10 in WT, WT exposed to Zn and non-treated PMT-10 

mice, in the serum of peripheral blood were below the detection level (BDL) of 

the assay, at all the time points analysed.  In Zn treated PMT-10 mice high IL-

10 amounts were detected at day 5 (5 days after Zn-mediated induction), 

increasing until day 15 and held up to day 30, when the IL-10 induction with Zn 

was ended.

3.1.2 Over-expression of IL-10 induces splenomegaly, 
accompanied by an increase of total number of splenocytes 
and spleen weight 

 
 After showing that Zn administration for 30 days induced high and 
sustained IL-10 expression (figure 6) next we analysed the impact of this over-

expression on lymphoid organs. For that, spleens were collected and compared 

between the Zn-exposed PMT-10 mice and the control groups. As show in 

figure 7a, the induced PMT-10 presented a pronounced splenomegaly. This 

enlargement of the spleen was accompanied by a sharp increase of the total 

number of cells, reaching approximately 450 million of cells compared to the100 

million cells in WT exposed or not Zn and non-treated PMT-10 mice (figure 7b). 

The spleen weight in treated PMT-10 mice also increased (figure 7c). All control 

groups – WT exposed or not to Zn and non-exposed PMT-10 mice, maintained

 Given the massive alterations caused by IL-10 in the spleen, we next 
evaluated the possible role of IL-10 over-expression in the thymus due to its 

involvement in cell differentiation and proliferation. To access this, at day 30 of

So far, our results suggest that high levels of IL-10 produced by PMT-10 

mice exposed to Zn impacts hematopoiesis. The splenomegaly, increased cell 

numbers and structural disorganization of spleen, and increased number of 

megakaryocytes shown in PMT-10 mice and caused by IL-10 over-expression 

are features seen a specific group of hematopoietic disorders, the MPD. The 

profile presented by MPD patients and mouse models [114, 119-121], is in line 

with the characteristics seen in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10, adding a 

new perspective to IL-10 functions.

3.2  Impact of IL-10 over-expression in hematopoiesis 
 

3.2.1 IL-10 over-expression leads to changes in spleen cell 
populations 

 
Since we observed a massive increase in the spleens of the PMT-10 

mice exposed to high levels of IL-10, we next investigated whether a normal 

distribution of cellular populations was occurring. To test this, we induced IL-10 

over-expression by feeding PMT-10 mice with Zn for 30 days and evaluated the 

major leukocyte subsets by flow cytometry. In WT mice exposed or not to Zn 

and non-exposed PMT-10, the total number of B and T lymphocytes and 

myeloid cells, in the spleen, was maintained over time (figure 10a-f). PMT-10 

mice over-expressing IL-10 presented a total number of cells of the B and T cell 

subsets similar to the other groups (figure 10a and 10c). However, the 

percentage of these populations significantly decreased (figure 10b and 10d) 

suggesting the increase of other cellular populations. Indeed, we observed a 

sustained increase on the number and percentage of the myeloid lineage.  

These alterations characterized by a decrease of the lymphoid lineage in favour 

of the myeloid lineage that leads to a sharp increase of total cell number and 

consequently to a splenomegaly, are similar to the ones seen in MPD patients 

[114, 119-121]. In these patients, the growth of the myeloid lineage is a 

consequence of an extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen with loss of BM 

hematopoiesis [114, 119-121]. Seen this we questioned whether, in PMT-10 

mice over-expressing IL-10, the observed increase of the myeloid population 

was specially caused by (i) a proliferation of HSC in the spleen – extramedullary 

hematopoiesis, (ii) the transference from the BM or (iii) a synergistic effect 

between the two organs.

3.2.2 IL-10 over-expression impacts hematopoiesis in the BM 
 
 Since we observed alteration on the cellular profile in the spleens of mice 
over-expressing IL-10, we next hypothesized that IL-10 could be affecting the 

hematopoietic process in the BM. To evaluate this, we measured by flow 

cytometry, the expression of B220, CD11b, CD19 and GR1 populations in the 

BM after 30 days of IL-10 over-expression in the PMT-10 mice. We found a 

similar profile to the observed in the spleen, characterized by a sharp decrease 

in the B cell subset and an increase in the macrophage/ granulocyte population 

upon IL-10 over-expression (figure 11).  
 

 

 

 

To further investigate these results, we next investigated whether the 

composition of early hematopoietic precursors in the BM was altered by IL-10 

over-expression. In this sense, we harvested the BM of PMT-10 mice over-

expressing or not IL-10 at day 30 of Zn exposure. Single cell suspensions from 

BM were marked for lymphoid precursors with specific antibodies (B220 and 

CD19). To evaluate myeloid precursors, we performed an enrichment of HSCs 

by magnetic separation and marked the cells with specific antibodies (SCA1, 

cKIT, Fc? and CD34). Our findings revealed that PMT-10 mice over-expressing 

IL-10 present a shift from the cKIT population towards the SCA1 population 

(figure 12). These results have been also seen in transgenic mice positive for 

the mutation V617F with a phenotype resembling PV [146]. Moreover, a severe 

reduction of the lymphoid precursors (B220lowCD19+) (figure 13a) and MegE 

progenitors (Fc?RlowCD34-) and an expansion of the GMP (Fc?RhighCD34+) 

were observed (figure 13b).

3.2.3 IL-10 over-expression leads to alterations of the BM 
structural organization 

 
 Because we observed that IL-10 over-expression led to profound 
alterations in the hematopoietic process and in the proportion of cellular 

populations in the BM, we next investigated whether the overall organization of 

this organ was affected by IL-10. For this, histological sections from wild type or 

PMT-10 mice exposed or not to Zn were prepared and stained with HE. As 

shown in figure 14, the BM of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 presented an 

altered structure of BM with a striking disappearance of megakaryocytes, 

indicating that IL-10 was affecting the hematopoietic process.  The decrease 

cellularity and the disappearance of megakaryocytes, together with the massive 

decrease of B cells and increased myeloid population in the BM, suggest the 

impairment of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, these events are in line with the 

occurrence of a extramedullary hematopoiesis at the spleen level.  These 

results are in line with the MPD profile since a decrease BM cellularity with 

special decline of erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis is one the 

characteristics from patients suffering from MPD [114, 119-121, 144, 145], 

suggesting that IL-10 over-expression may influence normal hematopoiesis in a 

very similar way to MPD.

3.2.4 IL-10 over-expression affects the lymphoid and myeloid 
populations from the blood 

 
So far, we have shown that IL-10 over-expression caused cellular 

alterations both in the BM and the spleen. Since the blood is used by the 

different cellular subsets to move from one compartment to another, the next 

step was to evaluate if the blood cellularity was being affected by the high levels 

of IL-10. To test this, peripheral blood from all groups –, was drawn from the 

tail/eye.  Hematocrit analysis was performed showing that the red blood cells 

(RBC) percentage in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 decreases overtime 

(figure 15a). Furthermore, the peripheral blood was analysed by flow cytometry 

for the major leukocytes subsets, showing very similar data to the one seen in

3.3  Reversibility of IL-10 over-expression 
 

3.3.1 Withdrawal of IL-10 to normal levels led to the reposition of 
cellular populations in the spleen, BM and blood 

 
Taken together, the data presented in part 3.2 suggest a possible role for 

IL-10 as a regulator of the hematopoietic process, since over-expression of this 

cytokine in a mouse model leads to inhibition of lymphoid lineage, and 

increased myeloid lineage differentiation in the BM of adult animals. PMT-10 

mice over-expressing IL-10 develop a splenomegaly, accompanied by an 

increase of the total cell number mainly composed by cells of the myeloid 

lineage. BM from these animals present an impairment in hematopoiesis, that 

leads to a cellularity decrease. These features result in a specific phenotype 

that resembles the one seen in MPD patients [114, 119-121, 144, 145]. 

Nevertheless several questions remain open, such as the evaluation of the 

plasticity of our mouse model in recovering, both at the macroscopic and the 

functional levels, from the phenotype induced by IL-10 over-expression. 

We now want to explore our findings further, at the cellular and molecular 

levels, to clarify how IL-10 can shift hematopoiesis towards the myeloid lineage. 

Currently we are studying the plasticity of the organism when exposed to IL-10. 

To do so, we are performing experiments by exposing the animals to Zn for 30 

days followed by 15 days without Zn and repeat this cycle 3 or more times. At 

the end of each exposure or resting period, a group of animals will be sacrificed 

and the spleens, BM and blood will be harvested for cell population analysis by 

flow cytometry and tissue organization by histology (figure 16).

addressed by performing analysis of several parameters in various 
time points.

PMT-10 mice were induced to over-express IL-10 during 30 days. At day 

30, the Zn feeding that induces IL-10 over-expression was discontinued, and 15 

days were given to the mice to recover. At various time points, PB was collected 

to measure the levels of IL-10 by immunoassay (figure 17) and the percentage 

of RBC (data not shown). As showed before, the levels of IL-10 in PMT-10 mice 

achieved a plateau 15 days after the beginning of the Zn administration, while 

the levels in the other groups remained below detection level. Furthermore, 5 

days after the end of induction, the levels of IL-10 in PMT-10 mice was no 

longer detected (figure 17).

show in figure 18a, the PMT-10 mice spleen returned to its normal size.

After 15 days of the end of Zn administration the PMT-10 mice, 
previously exposed to IL-10 over-expression for 30 days, spleens 
from all groups were removed and compared for its size (a), total 
number of cells (b) and weight (c). Single cell suspensions from 
spleen, BM and blood were analysed by flow cytometry using 
specific antibodies (B220, CD3, CD4, CD8, Cd11b, CD19 and

Furthermore, this size regression of the spleen was accompanied by a 

decrease of the total number of cells, returning to its normal values from 

approximately 100 million cells (figure 18b). The spleen weight of previously 

PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 also decreased (figure 18c). Moreover, all 

the different cell populations of the spleen, BM and blood returned to its normal 

values (figure 18d-i), including the T cell populations and RBC (data not shown).

3.3.2 Withdrawal of IL-10 to normal levels led to restoration of 
spleen and BM histology 

 

Samples from spleens collected at day 45 from Bl6 and PMT-10 mice 

previously exposed to Zn were processed for histological studies by staining 

with HE. PMT-10 mice exposed to IL-10 over-expression that presented a 

tissues structural disorganization from the spleen (figure 8), recovered its 

structural organizaiton15 days after the cessation of Zn exposure, being 

possible to distinguish again the white and the red pulp (figure 19). Moreover, 

the giant cells morphologically resembling megakaryocytes that appeared in 

great number in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10, were reduced to absent at 

day 45. Samples from the BM of PMT-10 mice presented also a recovery of the 

normal populations (figure 19).

Altogether, our results suggest that IL-10 over-expression for 30 days in 

PMT-10 mice impacts hematopoiesis. These features, seen in PMT-10 mice 

over-expressing IL-10 and characterized by a splenomegaly, increased total cell 

number in the spleen due to the proliferation of cells from the myeloid lineage, 

increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the spleen, structural disorganization 

of the spleen and loss of cellularity of the BM with special incidence in the B cell 

and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte population are seen in a very specific group of 

hematopoietic disorders, the MPDs. However, our data so far, does not allow us 

to determine if IL-10 over-expression has a reversible or irreversible effect in the 

plasticity of the system.

Every day billions of blood cells reach maturity, each derived from HSC 

through process of differentiation and proliferation that origin the lymphoid and 

myeloid lineage, maintaining homeostasis and guaranteeing protection against 

pathogens [1-3]. Differentiation of HSCs occurs in fetal liver and in BM 

throughout adulthood, under the control of signals delivered by stromal 

microenvironment [1-4]. These signals regulate the proliferation, the survival 

and the differentiation of HSCs by activating genetic programs that determine 

the specification of the precursors along the different lineages, with loss of 

potential for differentiation into other cell fates [1-4, 6-11]. Deregulation of the 

hematopoietic process often leads to fatal diseases, such as 

immunodeficiencies, leukemias and MPDs [51, 57, 95-97]. Therefore, the 

understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is of 

great importance. Several lines of evidence implicate interleukins, IFNs and 

colony stimulating factors in hematopoiesis [35, 51, 52, 54, 62, 63, 153]. Each 

of these factors functions alone or in combination with the others. Moreover, the 

direct action of these factors in a cell lineage can influence indirectly other 

lineages [9, 43, 154-156].  

The influence of several cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-7 or GM-CSF, in 

hematopoiesis has been well reported over the years [31, 51, 53, 54, 153, 154, 

156] but the role of IL-10 in this process is still awaiting clarification. So far, the 

presence of IL-10 has been implicated in several hematopoietic disorders, such 

as diffuse B cell lymphoma (DBCL) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [142, 157]. 

This possible involvement raises several questions, including the detailed 

understanding of the impact of IL-10 on cell differentiation and proliferation. In 

this context, a mouse model able to transiently over-express IL-10 under a tight 

control presents itself as an interesting tool to study the impact of IL-10 in 

hematopoiesis. PMT-10 mice are such model, where IL-10 over-expression is 

induced after Zn administration. 

Our results, obtained by comparing PMT-10 under Zn administration to 

control PMT-10 or to Bl6 mice fed with Zn or not, demonstrate that high levels of 

IL-10 may impact normal hematopoiesis. By characterizing in detail the effect of 

IL-10 over-expression in PMT-10 mice, we found that in this situation they 

presented a pronounced splenomegaly not seen in the remaining groups (figure 

7a), accompanied by an increase of total spleen cell numbers and spleen

weight (figure 7b and 7c). A structural disorganization of the spleen of PMT-10 

mice over-expressing IL-10 was also observed (figure 8a), with the appearance 

of giant cells, morphologically resembling megakaryocytes (figure 8b). These 

cells were found in various stages of differentiation, including early stages of 

development, suggesting that they were being produced in the spleen. These 

first evidences, characterized by splenomegaly and increase in the number of 

megakaryocytes in the spleen of PMT-10 over-expressing IL-10, called our 

attention since they resemble the phenotype exhibited by MPD patients [114, 

119, 121, 123, 127]. Moreover, this same profile has also been reported in 

mouse models of MPD, namely those expressing the JAK2V617F mutation [144, 

145]. Whether PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 represent a novel model of 

MPD remains to be clarified. 

Secondly, we need to clarify whether extramedullary hematopoiesis is 

occurring. For that, we started by investigating in detail the impact of high IL-10 

levels in the cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In the spleen of PMT10 

mice over-expressing IL-10, we observed a substantial increase in myeloid cells 

(CD11b+GR1+) with a corresponding decrease in B and T-lineage cells (figure 

10). Moreover, we observed that the decrease seen in B and T-lineage cells 

was not due to a drop of its total cell number but to a massive increase of total 

myeloid cell numbers, which altered the normal ratio between these subsets. 

Although an increase of the total number of myeloid cells was observed, one 

question remained. Were the cells from the myeloid lineage proliferating in the 

spleen? Or were these cells accumulating in the spleen due to defect in their 

homing/egress? Answers to these questions are essential to prove or not the 

occurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis and therefore to conclude whether 

IL-10 over-expression I slinked to MPD.  

To answer the first question, we started evaluating the different leukocyte 

subsets in the BM.  

We found that, similarly to the changes seen in spleen, the BM presented a 

sharp decrease of the B cell population whereas cells from the myeloid lineage 

suffered an increase (figure 11). To further investigate our findings, we next 

addressed if the IL-10 induced differences seen in the proportions of B cells and 

myeloid cell in the BM resulted of alterations of the hematopoietic process. 

Investigation of the composition of early hematopoietic precursors revealed that

30 days after induction of IL-10 expression in PMT-10 mice, a significant 

increase of the SCA1 and SCA1/ cKIT positive cells was observed in the BM 

(figure 12). It has been reported that SCA is a marker highly expressed in 

primitive HSCs whereas cKIT is expressed not only in HSCs but also in the 

common progenitors [146]. A shift towards the SCA positive population 

observed in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 indicates that hematopoiesis in 

the BM was being affected in a very early step of differentiation (figure 12). 

Moreover, the remaining cells that followed the pathway of differentiation, 

that is the cKIT positive cells, suffered a bias towards the myeloid lineage. 

These alterations resulted in a severe reduction in lymphoid precursors 

(B220lowCD19+) (figure 13a) and an expansion of CMP in the BM of PMT-10 

mice over-expressing IL-10 (figure 13b). Interestingly, the different myeloid 

precursors were not affected equally, being the differentiation into MegE 

progenitors inhibited whereas the differentiation into GMP was stimulated, 

resulting in a granulocyte/macrophage proliferation.  The phenotype observed in 

BM after IL-10 over-expression, was similar to that seen in human patients and 

in mouse models of MPD [114, 119-121, 123, 144, 145].  

A structural analysis of the BM of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 

showed interesting results, revealing a decrease of the BM cellularity with a 

visible decline of erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis (figure 14). These 

features are suggestive of BM aplasia, a condition characterized by a gradual 

decrease of cell count resulting in the production of fewer blood cells, including 

a sharp drop of RBC and white blood cells [158]. Thus, the increase of myeloid 

cells seen in the spleen may not strictly be due to a stimulation of proliferation of 

the myeloid lineage in the BM, but due to extramedullary hematopoiesis at the 

spleen level.  

 In future, we will explore our findings further, by evaluating the occurrence 

of a local cell proliferation in the spleen of Zn-exposed PMT-10 through 

bromodeoxyuridine (BudR) quantification. Moreover, to investigate whether the 

homing/egress of cells to and from the spleen mice over-expressing IL-10 is 

altered, we will evaluate the expression of chemokines involved in the cell 

displacement from one organ to another, by analysing their expression profile 

by RT-PCR.

Although we have seen that, in the BM, IL-10 over-expression led to a shift 

of hematopoiesis towards the myeloid lineage, we have not yet clarified the 

mechanisms by which IL-10 impacts the hematopoietic process. Is IL-10 acting 

directly or indirectly via other factors? (figure 20) CMP differentiation is 

regulated by several factors, such as IL-3, GM-CSF and erythropoietin [6]. Any 

influence in the expression of these cytokines, whether negative or positive, is 

expected to have consequences in the normal course of hematopoiesis. IL-3 

acts synergistically with other cytokines to promote the differentiation of the 

myeloid progenitors [54, 55]. Several studies demonstrate that numerous 

transcription factors are induced by cytokines in the microenvironment where 

lymphopoiesis is occurring to control the expression of B cell–specific genes. 

E2A induces expression of EBF and, together, these two transcription factors 

activate Pax-5, whose expression marks commitment to the B cell lineage [29, 

46, 159]. IL-7 has an important role in the expression of EBF in CLP, whereby 

its blockade leads to an impairment of B cell differentiation [31, 53]. In Pax-5 

deficient mutants, B cell differentiation is also blocked, albeit at a later stage 

than in EBF mutants, and precursors retain the ability to differentiate into other 

hematopoietic lineages [47]. It is possible that IL-10 influences hematopoiesis 

indirectly whereby the cytokines and transcription factors mentioned above are 

good candidates for the role of intermediate molecules. IL-10 may be acting 

through IL-3, inducing its expression and consequently leading to a proliferation 

of the myeloid lineage. On the other hand, IL-10 can also be blocking the 

expression of IL-7, promoting the proliferation of the myeloid lineage indirectly, 

by blocking the differentiation of CLP. A synergistic action between IL-10 and 

IFN? is also possible, given the ability of IFN? to promote differentiation of 

HSCs [65]. The mechanism by which IL-10 impacts hematopoiesis is a topic 

that we also want to address in the future. Using highly enriched HSCs isolated 

by cell sorting and differentiated in vitro in stromal cell-free cultures, in the 

presence or absence of IL-10, we would be able to determine the impact of IL-

10 over-expression in the differentiation of different cell lineages in vitro. These 

assays would allow us to assess whether IL-10 affects hematopoiesis by 

directly acting on uncommitted precursor cells. If we observe that IL-10 is acting 

indirectly, the impact of candidate cytokines mediating this effect will be 

assessed by using available knock-out mice, antibodies to those proteins or by 



	
  
	
  

55	
  

the addition of recombinant cytokines. We also plan to measure the presence of 
these cytokines in the serum of PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 and 

compare the obtained values to those of control animals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As already mentioned, the phenotype revealed in PMT-10 mice upon Zn 

exposure is similar to that observed in MPD. Indeed, the splenomegaly, 

increased total spleen cell numbers, structural disorganization and increased 

number of megakaryocytes in the spleen, are all features observed in mouse 

models and humans patients of MPDs.  Interestingly, the alterations seen in the 

BM, namely the hematopoiesis impairment, loss of cell cellularity, decreased 

erythropoiesis and consequently decreased % of B cells and RBC, are all in line 

with a MPD. In addition, blood analysis revealed similar results to the ones seen 

in the spleen and BM, characterized by a decrease on percentage of B cells 

population and an increase on myeloid cells in PMT-10 mice over-expressing 

IL-10 (figure 15b). Moreover, a decrease in the % of RBC in PMT-10 over-

expressing IL-10 was observed (figure 15a). Accordingly to the WHO 

guidelines, the patients suffering from PV present an increased % of RBC while 

patients suffering from ET or PMF present a normal or small decrease % of 

RBC [114]. The decreased value of RBC seen in PMT-10 mice over-expressing 

IL-10 can be related to the increase % of platelets (data not shown) by an 

Figure 20. Representative scheme of possible mechanisms of IL-10 
impact in hematopoiesis.

alteration of normal cellular proportions, and not only to the impairment of 

erythropoiesis. Since megakaryocytes are the platelets precursors, the increase 

in the number of megakaryocytes in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 might 

result in an increase platelet count, explaining these results.  It will therefore be 

of utmost importance to now quantify a series of parameters in PMT-10 mice, 

such as total and differential counts of white blood cells, RBC and platelets 

including the mean globular volume and the mean platelet volume. All these 

parameters were shown to be altered in a MPD scenario. 

MPD are frequently caused by mutations on the JAK2 gene, which are 

present in 90% of patients with PV and 50% of the patients suffering from ET or 

PMF [114, 129, 133, 143, 147]. Based on the epidemiology of MPD and on the 

phenotype observed for IL-10 over-expressing mice, we hypothesize that 

increased IL-10 may associate with susceptibility to MPD, explaining the 10 - 

50% of cases unrelated to the JAK2V617F mutation. Therefore, PMT-10 mice 

are of potential interest as a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms 

leading to MPD, in the context of non-mutated JAK2. Since IL-10 has been 

recently shown to induce abnormal JAK2 activation in the context of DBLC 

[142], we have accessed whether JAK2 hyper-activation underlies the 

development of MPD in the PMT-10 mice. To study this hypothesis, we are 

currently comparing by Western Blot the levels of JAK2 phosphorylation in BM 

cells from PMT-10 mice over-expressing or not IL-10.  

To study the plasticity of the PMT-10 model in recovering from IL-10 

exposure, we have exposed the animals to Zn for 30 days followed by 15 days 

without Zn administration, stopping the induction of IL-10 (figure 17). A 

regression to normal size from the spleens of PMT-10 mice that previously 

presented a splenomegaly was observed (figure 18a). Moreover, all changes 

that accompanied the splenomegaly disappeared, occurring a regression of 

weight and total number of cells of the spleens from PMT-10 mice previously 

exposed to Zn (figure 18b and 18c). The different cell populations, including the 

% of RBC, returned to normal in all organs previously affected namely the 

spleen, BM and blood (figure 18f-i). However, there are some questions that 

need to be further investigated. Firstly, even though the spleen has recovered 

his structural organization, are the different cell populations in their normal 

location? Secondly, are the cells functional after these alterations? Thirdly, how 



	
  
	
  

57	
  

plastic is this system? These are questions that we would like to address in the 

future. 

Regarding the structure of the spleen, we will analyse if it returns to normal 

after the end of the Zn induction. To do so, we will perform a detailed analysis of 

cellular composition and distribution, using specific antibodies to trace B and T 

cells, and immunohistochemistry to observe the localization of marginal zone B 

cells and follicular B cells. In parallel, and to address if the spleen function is 

recovered, we will infect animals intravenously with Streptococcus pneumonia, 

measuring the progression of the bacterial load over time and the life span of 

the infected PMT-10 mice. Finally, and in what concerns the third question, we 

are currently addressing more thoroughly the system plasticity, by exposing the 

animals to Zn for 30 days followed by 15 days without Zn, and repeating this 

cycle 3 or more times. This will provide evidence on how transient is the effect 

of IL-10 over-expression. Of note, we have recent data showing that PMT-10 

over-expressing IL-10 do not survive for more than 160 days, presenting a 

splenomegaly even more notable than day 30 and a gradual cellular loss in the 

BM (data not shown).  

	
  

	
   In summary, the work presented here highlights two novel findings: that 

high IL-10 amounts impacts hematopoiesis, promoting the differentiation of 

myeloid cells and that IL-10 may be involved in the development of MPD in a 

context of no JAK2 mutations. Although further mechanistic studies are needed 

to explain these findings, this thesis opens many new questions and avenues of 

research that are worth investigating. Furthermore, if needed a parallel between 

the effects of IL-10 over-expression and MPD is in place, the elucidation of 

these mechanisms, using PMT-10 mice, may lead to the development of new 

approaches to the tackle MPD.

The presented work investigates for the first time the role of in vivo IL-10 

over-expression in hematopoiesis. We showed that IL-10 over-expression 

impacts the hematopoietic process by impairing the development and promoting 

the differentiation of the myeloid lineage. These features acquired with IL-10 

over-expression led to: 

 

- a splenomegaly, structural disorganization and increased number of 

megakaryocytes in the spleen, with an associated decrease of cells 

from lymphoid lineage.  

- a decrease of the BM cellularity with a visible decline of 

erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis. 

- a shift of the cKIT population towards the SCA positive population. 

- the stimulation of GMP differentiation. 

 

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hematopoiesis is 

important, taking into account that this process is responsible for the production 

of all blood cells and that its deregulation leads to fatal diseases. With this work 

we place IL-10 as one of the mediators of the hematopoietic process with 

possible implications with disease. 

The phenotype observed in PMT-10 mice over-expressing IL-10 show 

some similarities to the one seen in patients and mouse models of MPD. To 

establish PMT-10 mice as a potential model for MPD, several factors need to be 

further clarified. If this proves to be the case the elucidation of the molecular 

mechanisms underlying IL-10 action, using PMT-10 mice, may lead to the 

development of new approaches to study and tackle MPD.
