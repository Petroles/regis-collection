RESUMO 

Pretende-se com este trabalho estudar a relação dinâmica entre os preços de electricidade do 

mercado grossista em Espanha e os preços das principais referências de combustível para a 

geração de electricidade (carvão, petróleo, gasóleo e o gás natural). A relação dinâmica entre 

os diferentes sistemas eléctricos interligados (Espanha e Portugal, Espanha e França), 

utilizando como referência os preços de electricidade dos mercados grossistas formados em 

cada sistema eléctrico, também é relevante para efeitos de análise, pois impacta na evolução 

dos preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em Espanha. 

Os resultados sugerem: cointegração entre os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em 

Espanha e das variáveis em análise (combustíveis e preços de electricidade grossistas); 

relação de longo prazo entre os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em Espanha, os 

preços do carvão, os preços do petróleo, os preços do gasóleo, os preços do gás natural do 

mercado holandês TTF e os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em Portugal; relação 

de curto prazo entre os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em Espanha e os preços 

do gás natural do mercado inglês NBP e do mercado belga Zeebrugge; foi encontrada 

exogeneidade forte na relação entre os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em 

Espanha e os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em França; proporcionalidade 

entre os preços do petróleo, os preços do gás natural do mercado holandês TTF e os preços de 

electricidade do mercado grossista em Espanha; e a evidência de assimetria dos preços de 

electricidade do mercado grossista em Portugal com movimentos “abruptos” na sua relação 

com os preços de electricidade do mercado grossista em Espanha. Uma série de implicações 

serão abordadas.

ABSTRACT 

The aim of this work is to study the dynamic relationship between prices of wholesale 

electricity market in Spain and prices of the main fuel references to generate electricity (coal, 

crude oil, gasoil and natural gas). The dynamic relationship between the various 

interconnected electrical systems (Spain and Portugal, Spain and France), using as reference 

prices for wholesale electricity markets formed in each electrical system, is also relevant for 

analysis purposes due to impacts on prices of wholesale electricity market in Spain. 

The results suggest: cointegration between prices of wholesale electricity market in Spain and 

the variables under analysis (fuel and wholesale electricity market prices); a long-term 

relationship between prices of wholesale electricity market in Spain, coal prices, crude oil 

prices, gasoil prices, natural gas prices of the Dutch TTF market and the prices of wholesale 

electricity market in Portugal; a short-run relationship between prices of wholesale electricity 

market in Spain and natural gas prices of the English NBP market and Belgian Zeebrugge 

market; the presence of strong exogeneity in the relationship between prices of wholesale 

electricity market in Spain and prices of wholesale electricity market in France; 

proportionality between crude oil prices, natural gas prices of the Dutch TTF market and 

prices of wholesale electricity market in Spain; and the evidence of asymmetry in the 

electricity prices from the wholesale market in Portugal with “steep” movements in relation to 

prices of wholesale electricity market in Spain. A number of implications will be addressed. 

 

Keywords: energy; market integration; electricity pricing and cointegration.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Electricity is a form of energy used for a very wide range of applications. It is easy to 

control, non-polluting at the location of its usage and convenient; it is used in the 

application of heat, light and power. As a secondary energy source, electricity is generated 

from the conversion of other energy sources, such as coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear power, 

hydro power and other renewable sources. This implies that electricity markets and 

electricity prices are fundamentally linked to markets for primary fuels and environmental 

conditions such as wind and rain.  

Moreover, from a financial and commodity markets perspective, wholesale electricity
1
 

prices can generally be viewed as the result of investors having created real options upon 

various underlying primary fuel commodities such as natural gas, oil or coal. Thus, as 

electricity is often traded on exchanges close to an hour before it is needed, in this short 

term, the variable cost of power generation is essentially just the cost of the fuel. 

Economic theory suggests a relationship should exist between input and output prices. 

Consider the simplest case of a single factor of production (input) used to produce a single 

product, a static supply and demand model suggests that increasing the marginal cost
2
 of the 

input leads to an increase in the product price. Likewise, an increase in demand leads to an 

increase in quantity demanded for the product, therefore, a higher price. Associated with 

these changes are increasing marginal costs caused by the increased use of the input. 

Economic theory, however, does not state how such relationships will respond in a dynamic 

framework. Further complicating the issue are numerous locations using multiple inputs for 

power generation with different substitutability and complementary relationships. The 

degree of price transmission from input to output, therefore, may depend on the cost share 

of the input factor in question.

 The MIT Dictionary of Modern Economics (Pearce, 1992) defines marginal cost as “the extra cost of 

producing an extra unit of output”. Paul Samuelson defines marginal cost more cautiously as the “cost of 

producing one extra unit more (or less)”. The “or less” is important. The assumption behind this definition is 

that producing one more unit of output would cost exactly as much as producing one less unit would save.

However, the current volatile commodities market makes it very difficult to predict the price 

behaviour even more in the case of the power market. That makes it crucial to know what 

the possible external causes might be. 

This study examines the long-run relations and short-run dynamics between electricity 

prices and other factors that may impact the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. The 

factors under analysis are mainly three fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and crude oil), one 

refined oil product (gasoil) and also the wholesale electricity spot prices formed in Portugal 

and France. Providing information on the dynamics of electricity and fuel source prices 

allows for a better understanding of price information flow among the markets. 

First, coal and natural gas serve as important sources of fuel supply in electricity generation 

process, being basically the marginal technologies that define the wholesale electricity spot 

price formation. According to 2008 data published by the Spanish transmission system 

operator
3
 REE

4
, about 49% of the electricity in Spain was generated using coal, natural gas 

and fuel oil, with natural gas accounting for more than one third of the electricity generation 

and coal for around 16%. Thus, changes in coal and natural gas prices can directly affect the 

cost of generating electricity and contribute to its price at the retail level. Second, crude oil 

prices may also contribute to form electricity prices directly by raising electricity generation 

costs and indirectly through changes in market sentiments. The major long-term natural gas 

contracts that use crude oil as a price reference can be another relevant issue to discuss.

Portugal and with distinct price areas if there is congestion in the interconnection between 

both countries). France is also another country connected with Spain that uses the 

interconnection between them for exporting and importing electric energy. In France the 

wholesale electricity spot price is determined by the Powernext power exchange which 

nowadays belongs to the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEX Spot, a former cooperation 

between EEX
8
 and Powernext). Interconnection capacity makes it possible to trade 

electricity between countries. So, the wholesale electricity market price evolution in each 

country as an impact on the cross-border electricity flows between the two systems and 

dictates the transit of the energy flow from one system to another (if the electricity price in 

Spain is greater than the electricity price in France, a transit of energy flow between France 

and Spain should occur; if the electricity price in Spain is lower than the electricity price in 

France, a transit of energy between Spain and France should occur). Studying the relations 

and dynamics between interconnected systems using as an input the electricity spot price 

formed in each electrical system is also relevant because it might also have an impact on the 

evolution of the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. 

This thesis aims to present a synthesis of econometric models that allow an explanation for 

the relationship between electricity prices and fuel prices. The study is organized as follows:  

Chapter 2 begins with energy commodities and their impact on world economy. This 

chapter also makes an introduction to each relevant primary energy commodity with 

impacts on power generation fuel cost. A brief overview of the Spanish Electricity Market 

can be found in Chapter 3. This chapter begins with a description about Electricity Markets 

and ends with a reference to the Spanish Electricity Market in the context of MIBEL. Since 

the vast majority of economic and financial series show clear evidence of nonstationarity, 

this concept is introduced in Chapter 4 and tests for nonstationarity are presented. It 

continues with the notion of cointegration from which it is possible to infer market 

integration. Additionally, to validate certain issues about some cointegration properties, a 

study about exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry will also be shown. Following the 

data presentation in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 shows the empirical findings to verify the concepts 

derived in the theoretical framework described in Chapter 4. Finally, conclusions are 

presented in Chapter 7.

2 ENERGY COMMODITIES: A BRIEF DESCRIPTION 

Over the past years, the entire world economy has been affected by a massive increase in 

energy prices. Yet only a few years ago, there was complete confidence that cheap energy 

would last indefinitely.  

Energy use is crucial for modern society and world energy demand is growing constantly. In 

recent years, public interest in the energy sector has risen sharply with rapidly increasing oil 

prices, the liberalization of energy markets, and the first noticeable effects of climate change 

caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Securing a reliable and sustainable energy supply in 

light of declining resources and climate change mitigation will be a key challenge for the 

21
st
 century.

Until the mid-20
th

 century, energy demand was almost exclusively met by domestic energy 

sources. Since then, fossil fuels have become traded internationally and for electricity 

regional interconnected markets have evolved. Liberalization of energy markets in many 

regions of the world has led to new electricity and gas markets and to a significant increase 

in trading volumes.

Besides the energy companies and besides large consumers and emitters, banks and other 

speculative traders participate in these growing markets. In recent years, commodities have 

been increasingly recognized as an important asset class in fund management which can 

improve a portfolio’s risk profile. Energy and emissions markets are often described as 

unstable and erratic. They are characterized by a multitude of complex products, by high 

price volatility, and by fundamental interactions between each other. For example, gas 

prices will not develop independently of oil prices in the long run, as these fuels can be used 

as substitutes for each other in many applications. Electricity prices depend on electricity 

generation costs, which are directly impacted by prices for fuels and in the case of 

environmental restrictions derived from climate change policies the use of fossil fuels 

directly impact on CO2 emissions pricing trough its more extensive use. 

2.1 CRUDE OIL 

The Oil Market is certainly the most prominent among the energy markets. Crude Oil (or 

petroleum) is found in reserves spread across particular regions of the earth’s crust, where it 

can be accessed from the surface. Even though petroleum has been known and used for 

thousands of years, it became increasingly important during the second half of the 19
th

 

century as a primary energy source and as a raw material for chemical products. 

Today, crude oil is still the predominant source of energy in the transportation sector and is 

often taken as a benchmark for the price of energy in general. In Europe, for example, prices 

of natural gas are typically derived from oil prices. Therefore oil prices also have an impact 

on electricity prices, even though oil plays a minor role as a primary energy source for 

electricity generation. 

The physical crude oil market has to deal with a large variety of different oil qualities 

(viscosity, sulphur contents) and with different means of transportation (pipeline, shipping). 

All of these characteristics influence the oil price. Nevertheless, a liquid oil market has been 

developed, using few reference oil qualities as benchmarks for pricing an individual oil 

quality. The most popular benchmark oils are: 

? West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI): Reference for the US market, Sulphur 

content: 0.3%; 

? Brent Crude Oil: Reference for the North Sea oil market with a similar quality as 

WTI. Sulphur content: 0.3%; 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

9 

? Dubai Crude Oil: Reference for the Middle East and Far East markets. Sulphur 

content: 2%. 

2.2 REFINED OIL PRODUCTS 

Crude oil is never consumed “as it is” in final uses but undergoes refining processes, 

producing many oil products which are used by both intermediate industries and end users. 

The refining process in its basic form is a distillation process, where crude oil is heated in a 

distillation column. The lightest components can now be extracted at the top of the column 

whereas the heaviest components are taken out of the bottom of the column. To increase the 

yield of the more valuable lighter products, a cracking process is used, breaking up the 

longer hydrocarbon molecules. Other processes are needed to remove the sulphur content. 

Ordered by increasing density, the most important oil products are: 

? Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG): Propane or butane; 

? Naphtha: Mainly used in chemical industry; 

? Gasoline: Mainly used for transportation; 

? Middle distillates: Kerosene, heating oil and diesel (gasoil); 

? Fuel oil: Used in thermal power plants and large combustion engines. 

Owing to the combined production process, prices of different oil products are usually 

tightly related to each other and can be expressed in terms of price spreads
9
 against crude 

oil. The lighter and more valuable products have higher spreads against crude oil than the 

heavier products. In special circumstances, such as a military crisis, prices for certain 

products (e.g. jet fuel) can spike upwards in relation to crude oil because of the limited 

refining capacities and the limited flexibility of refineries to change the production ratios 

among the different products. 

The European market in refined products is highly competitive, and the industry is quite 

large and developed, as Europe accounts for more than 17%
10

 of total world refining 

capacity. European refiners transform and move a significant amount of risk in the market 

since they not only buy crude oil but also sell refined products. Both crude and refined

products are volatile even in the short term, and correlation among these prices, especially 

in the medium and long term, is able to transfer downward in the energy markets a part of 

the risk they incur from crude oil inputs; the rest of the risk is borne by them. Anyway, the 

amount of risk borne directly by refiners is not trivial. In fact, the refining margin, which is 

the difference between refined product prices and crude oil prices, has always been quite 

volatile. 

The most important refined product in Europe is gasoil, which is used for domestic heating 

and for transportation (diesel engines). Improvements in diesel engine technology and tax 

incentives have led to a strong growth of diesel consumption in Europe. Fuel oil plays a 

limited role, but is still frequently used as a price reference for natural gas contracts. 

The market for refined oil products in Europe is divided into NWE ARA (North-western 

Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) and MED (Mediterranean, Genoa). 

One typical financial instrument for European gasoil is Gasoil swaps
11

 traded OTC
12

 and 

typically refer to the monthly average gasoil price (ARA or MED) as published by Platts
13

 

for setting the floating payments. 

2.3 COAL 

Coal is a fossil fuel, usually with the physical appearance of a black or brown rock, 

consisting of carbonized vegetal matter. It is formed plant remains that have been 

compacted, hardened, chemically altered, and metamorphosed by heat and pressure over 

geological time. It is used as a main source of fuel for the generation of electricity 

worldwide and for steel production. Coal is heterogeneous source of energy, with a 

significantly varying quality. Coal types are distinguished by their physical and chemical 

characteristics. Characteristics defining coal quality are, for example, carbon, energy, 

                                                      

 

11
 A Gasoil Swap is derivative used as a hedge or as a speculative tool against the price of a physical 

commodity. Its price is dependent on the price of the underlying commodity. In this case, Gasoil swap is a 

derivative used to hedge on the price of physical Gasoil. This commodity is traded daily on a fixed price 

basis to be settled against a floating price. 
12

 Over-the-Counter trading is to trade financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives 

directly between two parties. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via facilities constructed 

for the purpose of trading (i.e., exchanges).

sulphur, and ash content. The higher the carbon content of a coal the higher its rank or 

quality. These characteristics determine the coal’s price and suitability for various uses. 

There are three main categories of coal. These are hard coal, sub-bituminous coal and 

lignite. 

Figure 2 - Types of Coal 

 

Source: World Coal Institute 

Hard coal has a high gross calorific value greater than 5700 kcal/kg and can be categorized 

as follows: 

? Coking coal is a premium-grade bituminous coal at the top end of the quality 

spectrum used to manufacture coke for the steelmaking process; 

? Steam coal is coal used for steam raising and space heating purposes. It includes all 

anthracite coals and bituminous coals not classified as coking coal. As primary fuel 

for hard coal fired power plants, steam coal with a calorific value greater than  

6000 kcal/kg and with low moisture, ash and sulphur (less than 1%) is used. 

There are two main trading regions, the Atlantic and the Pacific region. South Africa, 

Columbia and Russia are the main coal suppliers for the Atlantic region and Indonesia, 

Australia and China for the Pacific region. There is also a small interexchange with 

Australia and Indonesia supplying both the Pacific and the Atlantic region.

Figure 3 - Worldwide distribution of coal reserves

Because coal transportation can be expensive, in some instances “it accounts for up to 70% 

of the delivered cost of coal” (Burguer et al., 2007), coal prices depend on the point of 

delivery. Standard delivery points in international coal trading are, for example, Richards 

Bay in South Africa, Newcastle in Australia, ARA for Central Europe or the Central 

Appalachian in the United States. 

The characteristics defining the quality of coal also determine its price. Energy content is 

the most price relevant characteristic, and quoted prices per tonne always refer to a specified 

quality and in particular to a specified energy content. 

Price information for hard coal can be obtained either from exchanges, from brokers or from 

independent information service providers. Price information published by the information 

service is typically generated by telephone or e-mail survey covering sellers of physical 

coal, utility buyers, trading companies and broking companies. Market analysts then assess 

the price of the standard specified coal that conforms to the required specification. In 

contrast to an exchange, an information service has no secured information about the 

concluded trades.

Traditional Financial Services (TFS), a broker of OTC physical and derivative products, 

averages prices originally published by Argus Media and McCloskey’s
14

 and generates the 

well-accepted All Publications Index (API). The TFS API indices are published in the 

Argus/McCloskey Price Index Report. There are the following API indices: 

? API#2: is the index for the NWE ARA region quoted as CIF
15

 ARA and is an 

important benchmark for Central Europe. Delivery must be within the next 90 days, 

the energy content is specified at 6000 kcal/kg and the sulphur content must be less 

than 1%; 

? API#3: is the index for FOB
16

 Newcastle, Australia. It is also a benchmark for CIF 

Japan prices by adding a Panamax
17

 freight assessment. Delivery must be within the 

next 90 days, the energy content is specified at 6700 kcal/kg and the sulphur content 

must be less than 1%; 

? API#4: is the index for the FOB Richards Bay, South Africa. Delivery must be 

within the next 90 days, the energy content is specified at 6000 kcal/kg and the 

sulphur content must be less than 1%. 

The delivery price of coal is determined in part by ocean freight rates. They are an important 

factor for the price of coal in different regions and for the competitiveness of coal against 

other fuels. The main factor that will affect the future movement of freight rates is the 

overall development of dry bulk
18

 trade. Mainly Cape
19

 and Panama sized vessels are 

employed in international coal trading. Cape sized vessels, used, for example, for the route 

Richards Bay to ARA, are also employed in the iron ore trade. As the shipping capacity is 

limited, the activity of the world’s steel industry has an impact on coal freight rates.

 Cost, Insurance and Freight: The selling price includes the cost of the goods, the freight or transport costs 

and also the cost of marine insurance. However, the transfer of risk takes place at the ship’s rail. 
16

 Free On Board: The seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment and for loading costs. 

The buyer pays for freight, insurance, unloading costs and further transportation to the destination. The 

transfer of risk is at the ship’s rail.

 Panamax ships are the largest ships that can pass through Panama Canal. The size is limited by the 

dimensions of the lock chambers and the depth of the water in the canal. An increasing number of ships are 

built to the Panamax limit to carry the maximum amount of cargo through the canal.

 A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk 

cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds.

and suezmax vessels).

2.4 NATURAL GAS 

Next to oil and coal, natural gas is one of the most important primary energy sources 

covering about 24% of worldwide energy consumption in 2008 (BP Statistical Review of 

World Energy, 2009). It is primarily used as a fuel for electricity generation, for 

transportation and for domestic heating. 

Natural gas is found in the earth’s crust mostly in gas or oil fields. Unlike oil, because of its 

low density, gas is difficult to store and transport. In the past, gas found in oil fields was 

simply burned without any economic use. With growing demand for primary energy 

sources, gas prices have risen and large investments have been made to build an 

infrastructure for gas transportation, either in the form of pipelines or in the form of 

liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. 

Figure 4 - Worldwide production share of Natural Gas in 2008

The countries with the highest gas production are Russia, the United States and Canada 

selling most of their gas via pipeline. LNG exports, however, are becoming more and more 

important in rising gas prices and new investments in LNG terminals are being made. 

Compared to oil, the natural gas market is more regional due to the high costs of gas 

transportation. The following regional markets can be distinguished:

? The North American market; 

? The European market; 

? The Asian market. 

Historically, these regional markets have had little interaction, since LNG played a 

significant role only in the Asian market. With declining gas reserves and growing demand 

in North America and Western Europe, the importance of LNG for these markets, and 

therefore the market interaction, will increase over the next decades. 

Another important issue to discuss is the contractual relationship between the different 

players of the natural gas business. Producers mostly sell the gas to intermediaries and 

traders, very often through long-term contracts. Gas prices are mainly set, at least in Europe, 

using algebraic formulae whose inputs are prices of other primary and secondary energy 

sources. The real formulae usually contain additive and multiplicative terms. There are 

always time lags for the calculation of average energy input prices, consequently reducing 

short-term gas price volatility. Moreover, energy input prices are generally expressed in US 

dollars, so exchange rates are also included in the formulae. Finally, these formulae are 

never used to calculate prices on a daily basis but over longer intervals, say, every one to 

three months, and during this time, prices remain fixed at the most recently calculated level. 

Each first partial derivative in the formula will express the sensitivity of the gas price to 

energy input prices; they are normally positive and constitute a distinct feature as they 

change from formula to formula. Very often, the energy input prices in the formulae are 

crude and refined product prices. The price that the European importers pay for natural gas 

is determined by a formula set in a long-term contract, and they are usually able to sell gas 

to customers (power generators, firms and households) according to a very similar formula, 

to which they add a fixed mark-up. The result, which is often referred to as a cost “pass-

through”, brings a nearly perfect contractual risk transfer and residual risk being close to 

zero. This long-established practice is welcomed by producers, as gas is often extracted in 

association with crude oil, and also by gas traders because this link will always assure that 

gas prices are competitive against the two main available substitutes, which are fuel oil in 

the electricity industry and heating gasoil in the households market.

Traditionally, the European gas market has been supplied by three large exporters: Russia, 

Norway and Algeria. The most important gas trading hubs
20

 in Europe are listed below: 

? The National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom (UK): a notional 

point within the UK gas pipeline network (basis for most UK gas trades); 

? Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Netherlands: physical natural gas delivery at the 

notional trading point, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility; 

? Zeebrugge in Belgium: physical natural gas delivery at the Zeebrugge hub operated 

by Huberator. 

The continental European market and the UK market are linked by the Interconnector 

pipeline that began operation in 1998 and by the BBL
21

 pipeline that began operation in 

2006. The Interconnector connects the NBP gas trading hub to the Zeebrugge gas trading 

hub while the BBL pipeline connects the NBP gas trading hub to the TTF gas trading hub. 

Figure 5 - Natural Gas pipeline connections between UK and Continental Europe

Since the Interconnector and BBL make arbitrage trading possible between the UK and 

continental Europe (within the technical capacity restrictions of the Interconnector and BBL 

                                                      

 

20
 A successful gas trading hub has two basic characteristics: first and foremost it must be possible to easily 

move gas into and out of the market, whether the market is defined as a single point or as a whole area 

(virtual hub); second, there must be a use for the gas, either through the existence of a significant customer 

base, or through the demand from other markets that can be reached from the traded hub.

pipeline), the gas spot prices at NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge are closely connected. Therefore 

the spreads between NBP, Zeebrugge and TTF are most of time near zero. Besides this, 

there are short periods of time where the spreads are significantly different from zero 

(historically, this was regularly the case when the Interconnector or BBL was shut down for 

maintenance work). However, there is one circumstance that possibly turns the Zeebrugge 

and NBP natural gas markets into a more integrated market than TTF and Zeebrugge. This 

circumstance is characterized by technical restrictions of BBL pipeline usage since it is not 

capable of physical reverse flow (actually the only physical capable flow is delivering 

natural gas from TTF to NBP) while natural gas in the Interconnector pipeline physically 

flows in both directions.

3 THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY MARKET: A BRIEF OVERVIEW 

3.1 ELECTRICITY MARKETS 

The electricity market is characterized by a number of specific features which affect both its 

market design and the nature of competition. The most notable feature is that, unlike gas, 

electricity cannot be stored on a significant scale and needs to be consumed instantaneously. 

The lack of storability, coupled with the fact that final electricity demand varies 

considerably during the day and according to seasons, means that electricity production 

levels need to be able to adjust rapidly on an hourly basis and have to constantly match 

demand requirements. This implies that some generation capacity needs to be available 

primarily to meet demand peaks (but will not be needed at lower demand levels), and that 

prices can rise significantly during peak periods (to allow peaking capacity to recover both 

its fixed and variable costs). The fact that final demand does not respond significantly to 

price changes (typically because it does not face real-time prices due to the absence of 

hourly metering of consumption) accentuates the need for spare capacity during peak 

demand periods. 

The features of the electricity market described above imply that a combination of power 

plants is used to optimally meet demand at any given point in time. Plants with high fixed 

costs and low marginal costs are used to meet baseload demand (i.e., the constant minimum 

level of demand across a time period, e.g., a year). Baseload plants typically include 

nuclear, run-of-river hydro plants and also renewable capacity which cannot be modulated 

(e.g., wind power). Plants with low fixed costs and high marginal costs (e.g., gas and/or oil 

turbines) are used instead to meet demand peaks. Reservoir hydroelectric power and 

pumped storage capacity are also used to meet demand peaks. Finally, plants with 

intermediate marginal and fixed costs (e.g., coal and CCGT
22

 plants) often operate as “mid-

merit” generation (i.e., they do not produce in the periods of lowest demand, but generate in 

all other periods). 

                                                      

 

22
 Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT): an energy efficient gas turbine system, where the first turbine 

generates electricity from the gas produced during fuel combustion. The hot gases pass through a boiler and 

then into the atmosphere. The steam from the boiler drives the second electricity-generating turbine. 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

20 

A “merit order” of plants of different technologies can therefore be constructed in 

generation markets, ranking capacity from the cheapest to the most expensive (in terms of 

variable costs). Fluctuations in relative fuel prices (including CO2 emission costs) affect the 

position of different technologies in the merit order (and in particular can cause the relative 

position in the merit order of coal and CCGT to “flip”). 

Figure 7 - Hypothetical merit order in the wholesale electricity market 

 

Source: Competition and Regulation in the Spanish Gas and Electricity Markets (Federico and Vives, 2008) 

In the paradigm, competitive generation market (i.e., one with low concentration levels), 

plants face incentives to offer their energy at variable cost during most hours of the year. 

Hourly prices are therefore set at the marginal cost of the most expensive plant in the merit 

order that is needed to meet demand in that hour (i.e., the marginal plant). Plants with lower 

marginal costs than the marginal plant can also produce during that hour and earn “infra-

marginal rents” that allow them to recover their fixed costs (e.g., capital costs and fixed 

operation and maintenance costs). At the very peak, prices need to rise above the variable 

cost of the marginal plant in that hour to allow it to recover its fixed costs, and can therefore 

reach (in the theoretical model) the maximum willingness to pay for electricity. 

For a given generation merit order, the distribution of demand levels across a given time 

period (e.g., a year) will therefore affect the distribution of electricity spot prices. Both 

demand and prices can be described as annual “duration curves”, i.e., plots of all the 

demand/price levels observed in a year (i.e., 8760 hours), which rank hourly levels from the 

highest (0% duration or hour 1) to the lowest (100% duration or hour 8760).

Figure 8 - Hypothetical Load Duration Curve 

 

Source: Competition and Regulation in the Spanish Gas and Electricity Markets (Federico and Vives, 2008) 

Congestion on the transmission network can change the theoretically optimal merit order. In 

situations of network congestion, the operator of the transmission system (which is tasked 

with ensuring the perfect balance of demand and supply) will have to call on more 

expensive units located in the congested area to produce, instead of plants that are willing to 

produce electricity at a lower price in areas with surplus generation. 

3.2 THE SPANISH CASE AND MIBEL 

The Spanish energy sector was liberalized in the late 1990s. The key pieces of legislation 

introduced to liberalize the industry were the Electricity Law (Ley del Sector Eléctrico) in 

1997 for the electricity market, and the Hydrocarbons Law (Ley de Hidrocarburos) in 1998 

for the gas market. 

One of the most contentious elements of the liberalization of the Spanish energy industry 

was the creation of a market for electricity generation. The Spanish electricity generation 

market was established in 1998 and since then, five firms have been operating in the 

Spanish market as competitors: Endesa, Iberdrola, Unión Fenosa
23

, Hidroelectrica del

 In 2008, Gas Natural SDG made a friendly takeover bid to buy Unión Fenosa.

Cantábrico

 and Electra del Viesgo
25

. The wholesale electricity market reaches a maximum 

peak load close to 36 GW and a yearly energy demand of about 232 TWh
26

. 

Figure 9 - Power Exchanges in Europe 

 

The basic design for the Spanish market was partially based on other liberalized electricity 

markets (most notably those in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, California and some 

other US markets at the time). 

Like the UK model, the Spanish market effectively concentrated most liquidity in a single 

marketplace (creating a potentially visible and reliable price signal) and introduced a 

mechanism for remunerating capacity. Unlike the British market, however, in Spain

23 

generators could vary their bids hour by hour and were also subject to a stranded cost 

recovery mechanism which reduced incentive to increase wholesale prices. 

Another important market design reform implemented in the Spanish (and Iberian) 

wholesale electricity market in 2007 was the launch of MIBEL on 1
st
 July 2007. Since then, 

the daily market is managed by OMEL while the derivatives market is managed by OMIP
27

. 

Generation units located in each country and consumption both take part in the daily market. 

The method which forms the marginal clearing price is totally valid, resulting, in general, in 

a single price for the entire Iberian system and in a flow of electric energy between the two 

countries. 

The method currently used to manage congestion in the interconnection is called “Market 

Splitting” which allows solving congestion in a non-discriminatory environment for 

operators in addition to the reduction of problems associated to the possible existence of a 

dominant position. This method is similar to that used in NordPool
28

 for congestion 

management when it occurs in the interconnections between Norway, Sweden, Finland and 

Denmark. If there is congestion on the interconnection Spain-Portugal in any direction, 

OMEL runs the “market splitting” procedure (Figure 10) which basically consists of making 

two separate procedures of price formation, one for the Portuguese market players and 

another for the Spanish market players taking into account the maximum amount of energy 

that can be exchanged between both systems and resulting in a different price for each 

country. 

                                                      

 

27
 OMIP is the managing entity responsible for the organisation of the Portuguese division of MIBEL, 

ensuring the management of the MIBEL derivatives market, jointly with OMIClear (Energy Markets 

Clearing Company), a company constituted and totally owned by OMIP, which has the role of Clearing 

House and Central Counterparty for operations carried out in the market.

 Nordic electric power exchange that provides market places for trading in physical and financial contracts in 

the Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and recently Germany), which listed the world’s 

first exchange-traded electricity futures contract in October 1995. It now operates the world’s largest power 

derivatives exchange and also provides a carbon market for trading contracts on emission allowances and 

carbon credits. In 2002, Nordpool’s physical market was organized into a separate company, Nordpool Spot.

Therefore, whilst MIBEL has established the mechanism for integration between the 

Spanish and Portuguese markets to take place, effective integration of the two markets has 

not been fully achieved yet. Greater interconnection capacity between the two systems is 

required for full market integration to take place. The expectation is also that, over time, the 

convergence of market design across the two systems (e.g., the harmonization of trading 

rules and of the mechanism for capacity payments) should also lead to greater convergence 

in market structures and technology mixes, and allow for the creation of an effective single 

Iberian market. 

In practice, given the different cost structures of the wholesale markets in Spain and 

Portugal (this can be seen in Figure 11) and the amount of interconnection capacity (an 

average of roughly 1243 MW of export capacity into Portugal during the period 1
st
 July 

2007 to 31
th

 October 2009), MIBEL has experienced market splitting for a significant 

amount of the time since July 2007.

Figure 11 - Generation share by technology in the daily market OMEL (from 01/07/2007 to 31/10/2009) 

 

Spain has more diversified generation assets by technology type in the wholesale market. 

Renewables
29

 offer their energy in the wholesale market in Spain while in Portugal their 

energy is bilaterally contracted by the last resource supplier
30

. Excluding the matched 

energy from the Renewables in the wholesale market, Spain has only 57% of generation 

share that comes from fossil fuels thermal power plants (CCGT, thermal coal and fuel/gas 

power plants) while Portugal has 78%. 

So, it seems that Spain is less dependent of fossil fuels power plants than Portugal due to a 

more diversified generation portfolio. In Portugal, electricity generation and electricity 

pricing is more dependent of fuel prices such as coal, natural gas and fuel oil. Looking at 

2008 generation statistics published by the Portuguese transmission system operator REN
31

 

and also by the Spanish transmission system operator REE (Figure 12), it is also possible to 

see the structural differences between the generation share of each technology in each 

country, particularly in Fossil Fuel technologies.

 Renewable energy is energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and 

geothermal heat, which are renewable.

established tariffs for electricity consumers defined by the Portuguese energy regulator, ERSE.

Nuclear is the baseload technology that makes the difference between the two electrical 

systems because their variable costs are extremely low when compared with other 

technologies but with the disadvantage of having a long payback investment period to 

recover the fixed costs. Theoretically, the Spanish wholesale market merit order is cheaper 

than the Portuguese wholesale market merit order. 

Figure 13 shows that it is possible to see that in the period that covers 1
st
 July 2007 to 31

th
 

October 2009, Spain exported 19355 GWh of electric energy to Portugal in the daily market 

and imported 688 GWh from Portugal. The interconnection balance is 18667 GWh, 

indicating that, on average, the Spanish spot price is cheaper than the Portuguese Spot price. 

Only 76% of the available interconnection capacity to export was used, while only 3% of 

the available interconnection capacity to import was used (an average of roughly 1150 

MW).

In 2008, the spread value fell by 60% when compared to the spread value in the second half 

of 2007. When compared to the 2008 spread value the 2009 spread value suffered a 

decrease of 77%. It is therefore possible to conclude that some structural changes in the 

distribution of the generation share by technologies were made over time. 

3.3 OMEL: THE MIBEL WHOLESALE MARKET OPERATOR 

3.3.1 ELECTRICITY MARKET ORGANIZATION 

Two independent bodies, namely the Market Operator and the System Operator are 

responsible for operating the electrical system. 

Operador del Mercado Ibérico de Energía - Polo Español, S.A. (OMEL) is responsible for 

managing the daily and intra-day markets, it is also responsible for settlement and 

communication of payment obligations and collection rights deriving from the energy 

contracted in the aforementioned daily and intra-day electricity production markets. 

Figure 15 - Economic and Technical Management of the Spanish System 

 

Source: OMEL 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

29 

REE, the system’s operator, is responsible for the technical management of the electrical 

system, for carrying out all those functions deriving from the operation of ancillary services, 

abnormalities in the electricity market, as well as for settlement and communication of 

payment obligations and collection rights deriving from ancillary services and the capacity. 

The Portuguese system operator REN is responsible for the technical management of the 

Portuguese system. 

In relation to its organisation, the electric energy production market involves the 

conjuncture of economic transactions deriving from the participation of market agents in 

daily and intraday market sessions, bilateral contracts and forward contracting, as well as 

the application of ancillary services and deviations. 

Market agents are those bodies which are entitled to act directly in the electricity market as 

sellers and/or buyers of electricity. Producers, external agents, distributors and resellers can 

act as market agents, together with consumers of electrical power and the representatives of 

any of the aforementioned entities. 

In this way, the deregulation model in Spain is configured as a model which enables both 

trading inside an official and organised market (forward supply, daily market and intraday 

market) and trading outside of it (bilateral contracts between producers, retailers and its 

qualified consumers including financial contracts). A key aim of the aforementioned model 

is to provide different trading possibilities on equal terms for all, allowing for the right price 

determination. 

The daily market includes, in addition to sale and purchase bids directed towards it, OMIP’s 

open positions of forward procurement, the purchases of the vendors of bilateral contracts 

with distribution companies, the positions of vendors and purchasers of the primary 

emission auctions executed with physical delivery and the sales or purchases of energy 

arising from the declarations of rights of use of the auctions of interconnections. 

Once the daily market session has been held by the market operator, and considering the 

bilateral contracts executed, the system operator studies the operating schedule’s technical 

viability to ensure the safety and reliability of the supply. If the resulting programme of the 

daily market plus the bilateral contracts does not comply with safety requirements, the 

system operator resolves these technical restrictions by modifying the programme of 

production units or pumping consumption units, resulting from the daily market and from 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

30 

the bilateral contracts, proceeding to strike a balance between production and demand 

through a competitive tender procedure. 

The intraday market consists of six sessions held over 24 hours period which can be 

attended by all agents who have participated in the daily market or executed a bilateral 

contract, in compliance with the limitations set by the System Operator in order to avoid 

constraints.

3.3.2 THE DAILY MARKET 

The purpose of the daily market, as an integral part of electricity power production market, 

is to handle electricity transactions for the following day through the presentation of 

electricity sale and purchase bids by market agents. 

  



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

31 

Submitting bids to the daily market can be done as follows: 

? The open positions communicated by OMIP/OMIClear forward market will be 

integrated as sale or purchase instrumental price bids; 

? The results of the communications of the execution of the power auctions of energy 

purchased by the distributors are integrated through the presentation by the sellers at 

these auctions of purchase bids at instrumental price; 

? The results of the execution with physical delivery of the options acquired by 

purchasers in primary power emissions can be integrated through the presentation of 

sale or purchase bids at open prices; 

? Owners of production units that are subject to the ordinary regime submit sales bids, 

as long as such units are available and their energy is not linked to a bilateral 

contract; 

? The distributors of electricity will submit specific sales bids for the amount of 

energy they are required to purchase according to the special system
32

. Nevertheless, 

electric energy generated by this special system is paid by a regulated tariff. In 

return, special system will sell their energy through the system of bids managed by 

OMEL, either directly or through their agent, by means of zero-price energy sales 

bids on the daily market and, as appropriate, bids on the intraday market; 

? External agents, retailers, and owners of production units subject to special regime, 

can also submit sale bids;

Sale and purchase bids can be made using between 1 and 25 energy blocks in each hour, 

with power and prices offered in each block. In the case of sales, the bid price increases with 

the block number, and it decreases in case of purchases. 

The sale bids may be simple, or may include additional conditions: 

? Simple bids are presented for each hourly period and production unit, indicating a 

price and an amount of energy; 

? Complex bids are those which, fulfilling the simple bid requirements, also include 

some or all the technical or economic conditions. 

OMEL matches purchase and sale bids received prior to 10 a.m. each day, whereby the 

price in each hour will be equal to the price of the last block of the sale bid of the last 

production unit whose acceptance has been required in order to meet demand that has been 

matched.

The price or prices on the daily market are determined according to the following process. 

The matching algorithm first calculates a solution by considering that all international 

interconnections have unlimited import and export capacity. Once this solution has been 

calculated, a check is made to see whether there is a surplus of net energy balance in any 

one of the interconnections in the Iberian electrical system, considering bilateral contracts 

and declarations of use of rights. Depending on the interconnection involved, the process 

continues as follows: 

? In case of congestion in the French interconnection, the energy that creates 

congestion will be removed in the direction of the congestion until congestion 

disappears. In order to do so, the process consists of removing the energy of the units 

without previous capacity rights (those units which have not obtained rights in the 

explicit auctions previous to the daily market) following the price merit order until 

there is no congestion. Ifcongestion continues, energy will be taken out of the units 

with previous capacity rights (those units which have obtained transmission rights in 

the explicit auctions previous to the daily market) following the price merit order 

until there is no congestion; 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS

? Once the interconnections in the Iberian system have been adjusted, the next step is 

to calculate the transactions between the Spanish and Portuguese systems. In the 

event that the previous transactions are incompatible with the commercial capacity 

published by the systems’ operators market splitting is performed at the Portuguese 

border. The aggregated curves of sale and purchase in both electrical systems are 

plotted. Each electrical system has a different price that will be the one applied to all 

purchase and sale bids in its electrical system at that time. 

The matching result contains, for each hour, the marginal price and the schedule of 

production and demand for each electrical system established by OMEL, based on the 

matching of sale and purchase bids. The results of the matching process are then 

communicated by OMEL to the system operators who receive the schedules of the units of 

their competence. 

The daily base operating schedule is drawn up by each one of the system operators and the 

result of the matching is accompanied by the notifications of the executions of the bilateral 

contracts.

4 THEORICAL OVERVIEW 

Mjelde and Bessler (2009:4) refer that “there are strong prior beliefs that economic data are 

nonstationary”, meaning that any particular price measured over time will not be tied to its 

historical mean. Further, as discussed earlier, electricity and fuel prices are expected to be 

linked. That is, similar economic forces are expected to influence each market; although 

price or price movements are not expected to be identical across the different markets. 

As Engle and Granger (1987) have pointed out, individual economic variables may be 

nonstationary and wonder through time, but a linear combination of them may, over time, 

converge to a stationary process. Such a process, if present, may reflect the long-run 

equilibrium relationship, and is referred to as the cointegrating equation. To summarize, it is 

expected that the different prices will be tied together, so that prices from one market will 

not wander off independently of the behaviour of prices in the other markets. 

The presence of a cointegrating relation among energy prices forms the basis for the 

specification of the vector-error-correction model (VECM). This study uses the error-

correction model (ECM) for electricity prices in order to capture their dynamic relations 

with fuel prices and other wholesale electricity spot price data from which it would be 

possible to analyze the price dynamics between those prices and the Spanish wholesale 

electricity spot prices. The ECM represents the change in electricity prices as a linear 

function of its past changes, past changes in fuel prices and also the other electricity prices 

under analysis, and an error-correction term. For a cointegrated system, the error-correction 

term represents the deviation from the equilibrium relationship. Thus, an ECM provides two 

alternative channels of the interaction among electricity prices and fuel prices: short-run 

causality through past changes in energy prices, and long-run causality through adjustments 

in the equilibrium error. 

Moreover, it is also imperative to validate issues concerning some properties of such 

equilibrium relationship by studying exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry of each 

cointegrated relationship. 

4.1 NONSTATIONARITY 

Most economic and financial time series that are trend stochastically nonstationary are also 

integrated of first order, i.e., differencing once is enough to achieve stationarity. Suppose, 

for instance, that one is interested in the long-run properties that rule the relationship 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

36 

between two or more first-order integrated price series. In this case, one needs to focus on 

the variables measured in levels. However, a linear combination of first-order integrated 

variables usually generates a residual variable that is also first-order integrated. Under these 

circumstances, the usual t and F tests carried out on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 

estimates do not follow, respectively, the t and F distributions and are, thus, meaningless 

(Phillips, 1986). What the model is most possibly capturing is a common stochastic trend 

between the variables in levels and not a causal relationship as required. Additionally, the 

residuals are strongly autocorrelated and the Durbin-Watson statistic converges to zero. 

Thus, the time series being analyzed are not related in the long-run although they may be 

related in the short-run, as is the case of the relationship between two random walks. 

Stochastic nonstationarity can be examined on the basis of unit root tests, of which the most 

popular is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller or ADF test (Dickey and Fuller, 1981). 

The ADF test is based on the following regression model: 

  (1) 

Where  is a constant term,  is a linear deterministic trend in the data,  

denotes the corresponding stochastic trend and the residuals . The symbol  

denotes a first difference, as usual, and the summation term captures any autocorrelation of 

the left-hand side variable. Taking , the ADF equation reduces to an AR(1) 

process. The null hypothesis in the ADF test is , using for the effect the MacKinnon 

critical values (MacKinnon, 1996). 

The distribution of the ADF test under the null hypothesis is given by (Dufrénot and 

Mignon, 2002): 

  (2) 

where  represents a Brownian Motion over . Under the null hypothesis the 

variable is nonstationary, i.e., it contains a stochastic trend. The alternative hypothesis 

postulates that , under which the variable is stationary. In fact, under the alternative 

hypothesis the time series is a stationary  process with or without deterministic 

terms. 

Despite their popularity, the ADF tests suffer from low power problems when the process is 

stationary with roots close to one (Blough, 1992). Additionally, some unit root processes 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

37 

behave more like a white noise than like a random walk in finite samples. By this reason, it 

is convenient to use alternative tests in order to conclude more accurately about the 

stationary nature of the series under analysis. 

An alternative to the ADF test is the KPSS test (Kwaitkowski et al., 1992), which postulates 

in the null hypothesis that the time series is trend stationary, against the alternative that it 

contains a stochastic trend. 

The data generation process of the KPSS test is given by: 

  (3) 

Where  is the sum of a deterministic trend ( ), a random walk ( ) and a stationary 

residual variable ( ) and where . The null hypothesis of stationarity is 

given by  where the initial value  is a constant. Given that  is a stationary residual 

variable, then  is a trend stationary process (TSP). Indeed, given the null hypothesis 

, the residuals  must all be zero and, therefore, , which is a constant. 

Thus, under the null hypothesis, the first equation in (3) represents a trend stationary 

process. The test statistic of the KPSS is a Lagrange Multiplier test where the numerator is 

the sum of squared residuals obtained from regressing  on a constant and a deterministic 

trend and the denominator is an estimator of the variance of the residuals . 

Another alternative to the tests described before is the Phillips-Perron (PP) Unit Root Tests 

(Phillips and Perron, 1988). Phillips and Perron have developed a more comprehensive 

theory of unit root nonstationarity. This method uses nonparametric statistical methods to 

take care of the serial correlation in the error terms without adding lagged difference terms. 

Brooks (2008:330) refers that this “test often gives the same conclusion as the ADF test”. 

Stationarity tests have stationarity under the null hypothesis, reversing the null and 

alternative under the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron approaches. Thus, under stationarity 

tests, the data will appear stationary by default if there is little information in the sample. 

One such stationarity test is the KPSS test. Brooks (2008:331) argues that the results of this 

test can be compared with the ADF/PP procedure to see whether the same conclusion is 

drawn. The null and alternative hypotheses under each testing approach are as follows in 

Table 1: 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

38 

Table 1 - Nonstationarity and Stationarity Hypothesis for Unit Root Tests 

 

There are four possible outcomes: 

1. Reject H0 (ADF/PP) and Do not Reject H0 (KPSS); 

2. Do not Reject H0 and Reject H0; 

3. Reject H0 and Reject H0; 

4. Do not Reject H0 and Do not Reject H0. 

For the conclusions to be robust, the results should fall under outcomes 1 or 2, which would 

be the case when both tests concluded that the series is stationary or non-stationary, 

respectively. Outcomes 3 or 4 imply conflicting results. The joint use of stationarity and unit 

root tests is known as confirmatory data analysis. 

4.2 COINTEGRATION AND EC MODEL 

Econometric theory says that cointegration is a rigorous way of defining stable long-term 

relationships between variables. So, this method was used to test and estimate the potential 

long-run relationship between electricity prices and fuel costs. 

We will investigate the relationships between the Spanish electricity spot prices and fuel 

prices using the Johansen test. The Johansen test is based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) 

system. As in Johansen and Juselius (1990), a vector , containing the  variables to be 

tested for cointegration, is assumed to be generated by an unrestricted  order vector 

autoregression in the levels of the variables: 

  (4) 

where each  is a  matrix of parameters,  a vector of constant terms and  

. The VAR system of equations in (4) written in error correction form 

(ECM) is: 

  (5) 

ADF/PP KPSS

H0: xt ~ I(1) H0: xt ~ I(0)

H1: xt ~ I(0) H1: xt ~ I(1)



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

39 

Where  is the first difference operator, with  and 

. Hence,  is the long-run 'level solution' to (4). If  is a vector of  variables, 

the left-hand side and the first  elements of (5) are , and the last element of (5) is 

a linear combination of  variables. Given the assumption on the error term, this last 

element must also be : . Hence, either  contains a number of 

cointegration vectors, or  must be a matrix of zeros. The rank of , , determines how 

many linear combinations of  are stationary. If , the variables in levels are 

stationary; if  so that , none of the linear combinations are stationary. When 

, there exist  cointegration vectors or  stationary linear combinations of . In 

this case one can factorize ; , where both  and  are  matrices, and  

contains the cointegration vectors (the error correcting mechanism in the system) and  the 

factor loadings. Two asymptotically equivalent tests exist in this framework, the trace test 

and the maximum Eigenvalue test. 

The test for cointegration between different variables is calculated by looking at the rank of 

the  matrix via its eigenvalues
33

. The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of its 

characteristic roots (eigenvalues) that are different from zero. The eigenvalues, denoted  

are put in ascending order . If the s are roots, in this context they must 

be less than 1 in absolute value and positive, and  will be the largest (i.e. the closest to 

one), while  will be the smallest (i.e., the closest to zero). If the variables are not 

cointegrated, the rank of  will not be significantly different from zero, so . The 

test statistics actually incorporate , rather that the  themselves, but still, when 

, . 

There are two test statistics for cointegration under the Johansen approach, which are 

formulated as: 

  (6) 

and 

  (7) 

Where  is the number of cointegrated vectors under the null hypothesis and  is the 

estimated value of the 
th

 ordered eigenvalues from the  matrix. Intuitively, the larger is the 

                                                      

 

33
 Strictly, the eigenvalues used in the test statistics are taken from rank-restricted product moment matrices 

and not of  itself. 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

40 

, the more large and negative will be  and hence the larger will be the test 

statistic. Each eigenvalues will have associated with it a different cointegrating vector, 

which will be eigenvectors. A significantly non-zero eigenvalues indicates a significant 

cointegrating vector. 

 is a joint test where the null is that the number of cointegrating vectors is less than or 

equal to  against an unspecified or general alternative that there are more than . It starts 

with  eigenvalues, and then successively the largest is removed.  when all the 

, for . 

 conducts separate tests on each eigenvalues, and has as its null hypothesis that the 

number of cointegrating vectors is  against an alternative of . 

Johansen and Juselius (1990) provide critical values for the two statistics, The distribution 

of the test statistics is non-standard, and the critical values depend on the value of , the 

number of non-stationary components and whether constants are included in each of the 

equations. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value from Johansen’s tables, reject 

the null hypothesis that there are  cointegrating vectors in favour of the alternative that 

there are  (for ) or more than  (for ). The testing is conducted in a 

sequence and under the null,  so that the hypothesis for  are: 

 

The first test involves a null hypothesis of no cointegrating vectors (corresponding to  

having zero rank). If this null is not rejected, it would be concluded that there are no 

cointegrating vectors and the testing would be completed. However, if  is rejected, 

the null that there is one cointegrating vector (i.e. ) would be tested and so on. 

Thus the value of  is continually increased until the null is no longer rejected.

being stationary. If  has zero rank, then by analogy to the univariate case,  depends 

only on  and not on , so that there is no long-run relationship between the 

elements of . Hence there is no cointegration. For , there are  

cointegrating vectors.  is then defined as the product of two matrices,  and , of 

dimension  and , respectively, i.e.:

ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

41 

The matrix  gives the cointegrating vectors, while  gives the amount of each 

cointegrating vector entering each equation of the VECM, also known as the “adjustment 

parameters”. 

The VEC model represented in (5) can be interpreted for example as a relationship between 

prices and returns in a given market. What it says is that the current returns or price changes 

are a linear function of previous returns or price changes and historical prices. Such 

historical prices form a long-run or equilibrium relationship, where the involved variables 

co-move over time independently of the existence of stochastic trends in each of them, so 

that their difference is stable. The long-run residuals measure the distance of the system to 

equilibrium at each moment , which may be due to the impossibility of the economic 

agents to adjust instantaneously to new information or to the short-run dynamics also 

present in the data. There is, therefore, a whole complex adjustment process involving short-

run and long-run dynamics when the variables are cointegrated. 

4.3 COINTEGRATED RELATIONSHIP PROPERTIES 

4.3.1 EXOGENEITY 

Economic variables are often classified into two broad categories, endogenous and 

exogenous: 

? Endogenous variables are the equivalent of the dependent variable in the single-

equation regression model; 

? Exogenous variables are the equivalent of the  variables, or regressors, in such a 

model, provided the  variables are uncorrelated with the error term in that equation. 

To keep the exposition simple, suppose we consider only two variables,  and , and 

further suppose we regress  on . We say that  is weakly exogenous if  also does not 

explain . In this case estimation and testing of the regression model can be done, 

conditional on the values of . As a matter of fact, you will realize that our regression 

modelling was conditional on the values of the  variables.  is said to be strongly 

exogenous if current and lagged  values do not explain (i.e., no feedback relationship). 

And  is super-exogenous if the parameters in the regression of  on  do not change even 

if the  values change; that is, the parameter values are invariant to changes in the values of 

. 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

42 

“The reason for distinguish the three types of exogeneity is that, in general, weak 

exogeneity is all that is needed for estimating and testing, strong exogeneity is necessary for 

forecasting and super exogeneity for policy analysis (Cuthbertson et al., 1990)”. 

The factor loadings  are of interest as they contain information about exogeneity (Johansen 

and Juselius, 1990), and therefore also about price leadership. If a row in  contains only 

zeros (or in our case one element since  is a column vector), the price in question will be 

weakly exogenous, or determined outside of the system. Hence, if the factor loading 

parameter in the equation for the exchange rate is zero, the data indicate that the exchanges 

rate is determined outside of the system. Furthermore, if the factor loading parameter 

associated with one of the prices is zero, this price will be determined outside of the system, 

and therefore be the price leader. With one cointegration vector, at least one factor loading 

parameter must be different from zero (Johansen and Juselius, 1990). Please also note that 

only in the case when just one factor loading parameter is different from zero, there will be 

no simultaneity problems if a system is represented with a single equation (normalized on 

the correct variable). 

The test used to verify the presence of weak exogeneity brings into play the matrix  in 

which contains information on the dynamic adjustment of the long run relationships. Thus, 

in order to test whether the price of product  drives the price of product  in a bivariate 

cointegrating relation, one can use a test of the null hypothesis that  ( . This 

test can be applied to all price combinations of relevance to our study. If the null hypothesis 

is not rejected then, one says that the endogenous variable  is weakly exogenous with 

respect to the parameters  (Johansen, 1991). This test follows a  distribution with one 

degree of freedom. 

Strong exogeneity can be confirmed by the principle of Granger causality, after testing the 

weak exogeneity for a certain variable. Granger causality alone is neither necessary nor 

sufficient to establish exogeneity. On the other hand, Granger causality is necessary (but not 

sufficient) for strong exogeneity. 

4.3.2 GRANGER CAUSALITY 

In econometric terms it is often necessary in practice to define a concept of “causality” 

which identifies the type of relationship between two or more variables. 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

43 

The concept of causality that this section aims to analyze is called Granger causality 

(Granger, 1969). This type of causality is usually examined or tested in the context of VAR 

models, which contributed to make it quite popular. 

Although regression analysis deals with the dependence of one variable on other variables, 

it does not necessarily imply causation. In other words, the existence of a relationship 

between variables does not prove causality or the direction of influence. But in regressions 

involving time series data, the situation may be somewhat different because time does not 

run backward. That is, if event  happens before , then it is possible that  is causing . 

However, it is not possible that  is causing . This is roughly the idea behind the so-called 

Granger causality test. 

As noted above, one way to analyze the extent of market integration, is by using Granger 

causality tests (Granger, 1969) which can be defined as follows:  Granger causes  if, 

ceteris paribus, the past values of  help to improve the current forecast of , that is: 

  (9) 

where MSE is the mean squared error,  represents the set of all past and present 

information existing at moment ,  represents the set of all past and present 

information existing on at moment , i.e., ,  is the 

value of  at the moment  ( ) and  is a non biased predictor of . On the other 

hand,  instantaneously causes  in the sense of Granger if, ceteris paribus, the past and 

present values of  help to improve the prediction of the current value of , that is: 

  (10) 

Given these definitions, consider the following ADL(p, q) price relationship: 

  (11) 

where  ( ) denotes the prices (in natural logs) of product i at time t,  captures 

the extent of autocorrelation in ,  measures the relationship between prices (in levels 

and lags) and  is a white noise disturbance. One can say that  causes  if the null 

hypothesis that all parameters  are simultaneously zero is rejected. The relationship can 

be bidirectional and, in this case, we say that there is a feedback relationship. If there is just 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

44 

one unidirectional causal relationship, then one of the markets can effectively influence the 

other market prices, but the reverse is not true. If the null hypothesis is not rejected in both 

cases, then there is no causal relationship between the underlying prices and one can say 

that they do not belong to the same market space. 

Gujarati and Porter (2009:654) refer that causality can be distinguished in four types, as 

follows: 

1. Unidirectional causality from  to  is indicated if the estimated coefficients on 

the lagged  are statistically different from zero as a group (i.e. ) and a set 

of estimated coefficients on lagged  is not statistically different from zero (i.e. 

); 

2. Unidirectional causality from  to  is indicated if the estimated coefficients on 

the lagged  are statistically different from zero as a group (i.e. ) and a set 

of estimated coefficients on lagged  is not statistically different from zero (i.e. 

); 

3. Feedback or Bilateral causality is suggested when the sets of lagged  and  

coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero in both regressions; 

4. Independence is suggested when the sets of lagged  and  coefficients are not 

statistically significant in both regressions. 

More generally, since the future cannot predict the past, if variable  (Granger) causes 

variable , then changes in  should precede changes in . Therefore, in a regression of 

 on other variables (including its own past values) if we include past or lagged values of 

 and it significantly improves the prediction of , then we can say that  (Granger) 

causes . 

4.3.3 PROPORTIONALITY 

The Johansen procedure allows hypothesis testing on the coefficients  and , using 

likelihood ratio tests (Johansen and Juselius, 1990). In this case, restrictions on the 

parameters in the cointegration vectors  should be considered. More specifically, in our 

case there are two data series in the  vector. Provided that the data series cointegrate and 

we find one cointegration vector due to bivariate cointegration, the rank of  is equal 

to 1 and  and  are ( ) vectors. A test of full price transmission is a test of whether 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

45 

 and is distributed as . This restriction can be tested for each pair of 

prices making  and  in matrix . 

4.3.4 ASYMMETRY 

Two important tests are used for testing asymmetry, the threshold autoregressive (known as 

TAR) and momentum threshold autoregressive (known as MTAR) models as in Enders and 

Granger (1998), Enders and Siklos (2001) and Enders (2001). These models allow verifying 

asymmetries in the dynamics of the adjustment between the Spanish electricity spot prices 

and the other independent data in study (fuel prices and electricity spot prices from near 

countries). 

More specifically, let the long-run relationship among electricity prices and fuel costs be 

represented by: 

  (12) 

Where  is the equilibrium error. Examination of the long-run relationship using the TAR 

and M-TAR models requires estimating Equation (12), obtaining the residuals, , 

estimating the following modified ADF model: 

  (13) 

Where . The Heaviside indicator, , differs between the TAR and MTAR 

models. In the TAR model  is set according to: 

  (14) 

While in the M-TAR model, it is set as according to: 

  (15) 

TAR and M-TAR models allow the residuals to exhibit different degrees of autoregressive 

decay depending on the behaviour of the lagged residual and its first-difference respectively. 



ECONOMETRIC STUDY OF THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SPOT MARKET AND PRIMARY ENERGY MARKETS 

 

46 

TAR model allows for different coefficients for positive and negative variations. “A 

sufficient condition for the stationarity of  is ” (Menezes and Dionísio, 

2003). 

The TAR model is also designed to capture asymmetrically “deep” movements in the series 

of the deviations from the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, the M-TAR model allows the 

residual series to exhibit more momentum in one direction than the other, useful to capture 

the possibility of asymmetrically “steep” movements in the series. 

The test statistic  and  are used to test the null hypothesis of no-cointegration (that is 

, which we obtain the sample values of the F-statistic) in the TAR and M-TAR 

models respectively. Critical values are reported in Enders and Siklos (2001). If the null 

hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, then one may proceed to test for the null 

hypothesis of symmetry (that is , hypothesis tested using the usual F-statistic). If the 

null hypothesis of symmetry is rejected and  then the model exhibits more decay for 

positive (changes in) errors.

5 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND GRAPHICAL OVERVIEW 

This section carries out a descriptive analysis of the daily Spanish wholesale electricity spot 

prices in euros per MWh (POOL_ES), the daily Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices 

in euros per MWh (POOL_PT), the daily French wholesale electricity spot prices in euros 

per MWh (PNX), the daily coal OTC prices in euros per ton (API2 and API4 index), the 

daily European crudes OTC prices in euros per barrel
34

 (BRENT, FORTIES and URALS), 

the daily gasoil OTC prices as a European refined oil product in euros per ton (GO_ARA) 

and the daily European natural gas OTC prices in euros per MWh (NBP, TTF and ZEE). 

The daily Spanish, Portuguese and French electricity spot prices are defined by the 

arithmetic average of the day-ahead hourly price per day considered in the study period. The 

day-ahead wholesale electricity spot prices for Spain (POOL_ES) and Portugal (POOL_PT) 

are formed in the OMEL power exchange. The French electricity spot prices are formed in 

EPEX Spot power exchange, a former cooperation between the French Power Exchange 

Powernext (PNX) and the German Power Exchange (EEX). 

The indicated coal price series, as mentioned in Chapter 2, represent the CIF price reference 

(API2) and the FOB price reference (API4) for Europe. The difference between API2 and 

API4 gives an approximation to the freight cost for the maritime route between South Africa 

and North-western Europe. 

The indicated crude oil price series have the following specifications: 

? Brent Crude Oil (BRENT): UK Brent crude oil is a blend of crude oil from various 

fields in the East Shetland Basin between Scotland and Norway in the North Sea. 

The crude is landed at the Sullom Voe terminal and is used as a benchmark for the 

pricing of much of the world’s crude oil products. Currently, the API gravity

 is 

estimated at 38 degrees and the sulphur content at 0.45% sulphur, but the qualities of 

all crude oils tend to change over time;

? Urals Crude Oil (URALS): The assessment for Urals is based in Russia. Urals is an 

oil benchmark that aggregates a mix of Russian oil exports. It is a mix of heavy 

crude oil from the Volga and Urals regions with light crude oil from western Siberia. 

Urals crude oil is supplied through Novorossiysk pipeline system and Druzhba 

pipeline. API gravity is approximately 32 degrees. The sulphur content reflects the 

normal pipeline quality which is typically 1.3%. 

Due to different crude oil specifications, these European crude oil prices will be considered 

in this analysis. 

Gasoil price data (GO_ARA) has also been chosen to represent a refined oil product 

because of its market liquidity. One gasoil price reference for Europe is the European NWE 

FOB gasoil (typically the FOB assessment is derived at a freight differential to the CIF 

assessment, based on the following routes: Ventspils, Antwerp, Stockholm) assessments 

currently reflect 0.1% maximum sulphur as a result of European Union directives aimed to 

reduce the sulphur in gasoil to 0.1% maximum. 

In Europe, as mentioned in Chapter 2, there are three major natural gas trading hubs 

interconnected between them. In this study, natural gas prices data from NBP, TTF and ZEE 

will also be considered. 

The study covers the period starting on July 1
st
, 2007 and ending on October 31

th
, 2009. 

This sample period was chosen to coincide with the date in which MIBEL (the Iberian 

Electricity Market) started (July 1
st
, 2007). 

All data came from the market information platform THOMSON REUTERS 3000XTRA. 

These data series are denominated in euros. In series quoted in US dollars such as crude oil 

data, coal data and gasoil data, a daily exchange rate conversion have been applied using the 

daily foreign exchange spot rate USD/EUR. In series quoted in British pounds (GBP) such 

as NBP data and ZEE data, a daily exchange rate conversion has also been applied using the 

daily foreign exchange spot rate GBP/EUR.

Working days are used because, although POOL_ES, PNX and POOL_PT are available for 

all calendar days, the other data are only available for working days. In the case of holidays, 

the missing value is replaced by the last trading value. 

The number of observations used in each series is 854. 

For all data, a natural logarithm transformation has been computed to deal with asymmetry 

and nonnormality and also because it make it easier to visualize the data in analysis (the 

points will be spread more uniformly in the graph). 

The data are analyzed using the econometric software EVIEWS for Windows V6.0. 

Summary statistics of these series are shown in Table 2.

From the summary statistics it is possible to conclude that all data exhibit asymmetry 

(significant skewness
36

) and significant kurtosis; so there is not any data that follow a 

Gaussian distribution. This result is also confirmed by the Jarque-Bera test. 

Time plots of the natural logarithm of each price series are given in Figure 19. All price 

series appear to be mean non-stationary, as trends through time are noticeable.

The graphical evolution of the POOL_ES, POOL_PT and PNX can be seen in Figure 20. 

PNX appears to be the most volatile (around 0.11), as measured by coefficient of variation. 

POOL_ES and POOL_PT have basically the same volatility (around 0.07). The volatility in

 A skewness coefficient is considered significant if the absolute value of the ratio (skewness / standard error 

of skewness) is greater than 2. The standard error of skewness: .

PNX is about 1.6 greater than the volatility of the wholesale electricity spot prices formed in 

MIBEL. One reason that can justify this is the market liquidity of MIBEL. When compared 

with Powernext, Portugal and Spain combined have a spot volume traded in OMEL of 

around 290 TWh. Besides this, Powernext has less volume, with a total of 82 TWh of 

electricity traded. The reason for such less liquidity in the French electricity market is due to 

a major percentage of bilateral power contracts settlement between power producers and 

retailers. Portugal and Spain are more integrated than France and Spain (the correlation 

between POOL_ES and POOL_PT is 0.950; the correlation between POOL_ES and PNX is 

0.694).

In Figure 21, it is possible to see the evolution of both API4 and API2 against POOL_ES. 

Coal prices increased steadily throughout 2007 and 2008, with rapid increases in the Asian 

market leading the way and illustrating the effect that Chinese demand for coal, other 

commodities and shipping continues to have on world markets. So, the price evolution of 

API4 during this period is a consequence of an increase in coal demand. In the second half 

of 2007 and into 2008, European coal spot prices (API2) again led the rapid increase in

prices, driven by demand in that region and influenced by continuing infrastructure 

constraints affecting Australian exports (API3). API2 peaked in July 2008. By December 

2008 however, API4 had followed API2 in their rapid fall into levels not seen since mid-

2007. Both API4 and API2 have practically the same volatility of 0.08. Observing the 

correlations between these series, API4 is more strongly correlated with POOL_ES than 

API2 (the correlation between POOL_ES and API4 is 0.91; the correlation between 

POOL_ES and API2 is 0.83).

In Figure 22, it is possible to see the evolution of European Crude Oil prices (BRENT, 

URALS and FORTIES) against POOL_ES. These crude oil prices increased steadily 

throughout 2007 and 2008, reaching a maximum price in early July – a record even on an 

inflation-adjusted basis. However, the economy had already started to slow down, most 

likely not unrelated to the high price of energy and to the T financial crisis which started in 

September 2008 and later triggered a sharp recession – with critical implications for global 

energy consumption. Crude oil prices collapsed, falling by more than 70% by the end of 

2008. All crude oil prices have the same volatility as POOL_ES. Observing the correlations

between these series, all crude oil prices have basically the same weaker correlation levels 

with POOL_ES (around 0.43 and 0.45). The reason for this same correlation level is 

motivated by a perfect correlation between BRENT and the others European Crude Oils 

(URALS and FORTIES). So, it is possible to consider BRENT crude oil as a benchmark 

crude oil reference for Europe. 

Figure 22 - European Crude Oil prices and the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices

Figure 23 shows the evolution of GO_ARA against POOL_ES. GO_ARA practically 

follows the same trend of European Crude Oils. GO_ARA appears to be the less volatile 

(around 0.05) than POOL_ES. Observing the correlations between these series, GO_ARA 

has a stronger correlation with POOL_ES than European Crude Oils (the correlation 

between POOL_ES and GO_ARA is 0.635). One possible reason that can justify this level 

of correlation when compared with crude oil could be the inclusion of this type of refined 

fuel in the price formula definition of long-term natural gas contracts to supply Spanish 

CCGT power plants in operation and also by being one refined oil product source for the 

Spanish Fuel/Gas thermal power plants in operation.

In Figure 24, it is possible to see the evolution of European Natural Gas prices (NBP, TTF 

and ZEE) against POOL_ES. In a similar manner to the prices of other energy commodities, 

natural gas prices were also affected by declining economic activity. Both natural gas prices 

have higher volatility than POOL_ES (around 0.14). Observing the correlations between 

these series, all natural gas prices have basically the same correlation levels with POOL_ES 

(around 0.81 and 0.83). The correlation levels of each of the European Natural gas prices 

with the others are near perfect correlation (around 0.98). Meanwhile, it seems that NBP and 

ZEE have a more approximated volatility value (NBP has 0.148 and TTF has 0.144) rather 

than TTF (with 0.137). Checking correlations between both natural gas prices, the 

correlation value between NBP and TTF is approximately the smaller value (0.98) when 

compared with other bivariate correlations. So, this distinct behaviour of TTF against NBP 

and ZEE can be justified by the fact that NBP and ZEE are common fungible products while 

TTF is not (British pounds is the currency used to quote NBP and ZEE while TTF is quoted 

in euros). The usage restriction of the BBL pipeline (with single flow direction of natural 

gas) that connects the TTF market with the NBP market could also be an important factor 

with strong impacts on the correlation between TTF and NBP.

6 EMPIRICAL FINDINGS 

After examining Figure 19, it seems intuitively clear that the time series under analysis are 

nonstationary time series in the sense that they move together, which means that the 

difference between observations at any given time remains approximately constant 

throughout the whole time period. This is the intuitive idea of cointegration, introduced by 

Granger (1981) and later published by Engle and Granger (1987) in their seminar paper. 

As has been previously mentioned, the concept of cointegration is applied to nonstationary 

time series; so before testing cointegration, it will be necessary to check if these time series 

are integrated of order one
37

. 

Considering cointegration as a global characteristic of the series while threshold behaviour 

as local characteristic (Balke and Fomby, 1997), the analysis is conducted as follows: 

1. First the degree of integration of the variables was tested by using the augmented 

test of Dickey and Fuller (Said and Dickey, 1984) known as ADF test, the  

Philips–Perron test (PP) and also the Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin test 

(KPSS); 

2. Second, bivariate cointegration analysis was made by using the Johansen 

Cointegration test. Both trace statistic and maximum eigenvalue statistic were used 

to confirm the presence of one cointegrating long-run relationship between 

POOL_ES and each variable in study. With the cointegration condition valid, a VEC 

model estimation for each cointegration relationship was made; 

3. Finally, the properties of exogeneity, proportionality and asymmetry of each 

cointegrating relationship were analyzed. 

All the empirical analysis followed the principle of parsimony proposed by Granger

 If two models appear to fit the data equally well, choose the simpler model (that is the one involving the 

fewest parameters). This principle is proposed by Box and Jenkins (1972) when considering the modelling of 

time series. They suggest that the fewer parameters that have to be estimated, the better estimates will result.

It emerges that all the differentiated price series are . However, the KPSS test shows 

that the rejection of null hypothesis of nonstationarity in levels  is only 

significant at 5% for PNX. Apart from this, the results are, therefore, consistent in both 

cases and lead to the conclusion that the logarithm of price series
40

 under analysis are, in 

fact, integrated of first order . 

Thus, it is possible to conclude that all energy prices are first-difference stationary, and 

proceed with tests of cointegration. 

6.2 COINTEGRATION AND ESTIMATED VEC MODEL 

6.2.1 COINTEGRATION 

Since the price series are all nonstationary and integrated of the same order, cointegration 

analysis is the appropriate tool for investigating the relationships between POOL_ES and 

the other considered prices series under analysis. 

The proposed methodology for doing this is investigating the bivariate relationships 

between the POOL_ES and each other considered price series, considering many VAR 

systems as the relevant price combinations, and tested for the presence of cointegration and 

the optimum lag length following the well known Johansen procedure (Johansen, 1988, 

1992; Johansen and Juselius, 1990), which involves a system based on a likelihood ratio test 

that contemplates two steps. Firstly, the lag number of VAR representation is determined 

using information matrices based on Akaike (1973), Hannan and Quinn (1979) and Schwarz 

(1978) information criteria (IC). Secondly, given the optimal lag length, the cointegration 

rank is obtained through the Trace test and the Maximum Eigenvalue test (both test statistics 

have non-standard distributions and their critical values have been tabulated by Johansen in 

1988). 

The two tests are used to determine the rank of the coefficient matrix , i.e., the Trace and 

the Maximum Eigenvalue test, are reported in Table 4.  

The column Rank  identifies the null hypothesis of each cointegration test performed. 

Here,  corresponds to the null hypothesis that there are no cointegrating vectors, that

 In what follows, when prices are referred it means logarithm of prices.

60 

is, the cointegrating rank is zero, and  corresponds to the null hypothesis that there is 

at most one cointegrating vector, that is, the cointegrating rank is less than or equal to one. 

The next column reports the eigenvalues for each hypothesis. The last two columns present 

the results of the Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue test statistics. 

Table 4 - Bivariate Johansen test for cointegration 

 

Using the 5% significance level, both Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue statistics fail to 

reject the null of no-cointegration in each bivariate relationship. 

However, at 1% significance level, both Trace statistic and Maximum Eigenvalue statistic 

tend to reject the null hypothesis in the considered crude oil prices series (BRENT, 

FORTIES and URALS). Moreover, the Trace statistic at 1% significance level applied to 

the cointegration analysis between POOL_ES and GO_ARA fails to reject the null 

hypothesis, suggesting the possibility of unique long-run relationships between POOL_ES 

and the considered coal prices, POOL_ES and the considered natural gas prices, POOL_ES 

and the considered wholesale electricity spot prices (PNX and POOL_PT).

61 

Hence, at 5% significance level, it is possible to conclude that the results from the 

cointegration analysis indicate that there are long-run relationships between POOL_ES and 

each of the other considered price series, implying that each of the other considered price 

series is integrated with POOL_ES. This study will consider cointegration at 5% 

significance level to undertake the empirical analysis. 

6.2.2 ESTIMATED BIVARIATE VEC MODEL 

The estimated vector error correction model for each bivariate cointegrated relationship 

between POOL_ES and other considered price series was defined according to the 

deterministic trend specification
41

 applied to each bivariate cointegration relationship. In 

addition to this, the number of lags to include in each bivariate vector error correction model 

was determined by the Wald Lag length Criteria
42

. 

Table 5 reports the coefficient estimates included in the vectors ? and ? for each bivariate 

vector error correction model between POOL_ES and each considered price reference. 

The results in column ? refer to the first lag of the respective variable. Moreover, the results 

of column coefficients ? represent the residuals of the long-term equation expressed in 

relation to the first difference of corresponding variable. 

                                                      

 

41
 The determinist trend specification is also selected by AIC, SC and HQ criteria in the Johansen cointegration 

test. 
42

 The Wald Lag length Criteria carries out lag exclusion tests for each lag in the VAR. For each lag, the 

(Wald) statistic for the joint significance of all endogenous variables at that lag is reported for each 

equation separately and jointly.

Table 5 - Bivariate VEC Model 

 

Notes: t statistic critical values: -2.58 ~ 1% and -1.96 ~ 5%. 

All coefficients ? of the long-term relationship equation are significantly different from zero 

at 1%. The equation is normalized to the POOL_ES. Concerning the adjustment 

coefficients, ?, only those for ZEE, NBP and PNX appear to be non significant at 5%, 

indicating that in each one of these bivariate equations there is not a long-term relationship 

between one of these variables and POOL_ES. The results also mean that the variables in 

question should be exogenous, the remainder being endogenous, as will be confirmed in the 

next section. 

6.3 EXOGENEITY 

A test for weak exogeneity will provide information as to whether any of the considered 

price series are price leaders, finding which price actually adjusts to maintaining the long-

run equilibrium (Asche et al., 1999). Following Johansen (1992, 1995), a weak exogeneity 

test has been applied to each series, testing every element of the adjustment matrix 

coefficient against zero. The likelihood ratio test is  distributed with degrees of freedom 

equal to the number of cointegrating vectors. 

The weak exogeneity results are reported in Table 6.

Table 6 - Weak exogeneity tests 

 

The null hypotheses of weak exogeneity can be rejected in all cointegrating relations at the 

5% significance level or better, except for the natural gas prices NBP and ZEE and also for 

the French wholesale electricity spot price (PNX). 

The impact of this weak exogeneity refers to the absence of significant adjustment 

coefficient in the long-term relationship of the corresponding VEC Model (see column ? of 

Table 5). Nevertheless, for each one of these weak exogenous variables remains only a 

short-term relationship between one of these weak exogenous variable and POOL_ES. 

Weak exogeneity of NBP, ZEE and PNX also implies that these same prices cannot be used 

to forecast POOL_ES in the long-run. For this to be also the case in the short-run, these 

prices must be strongly exogenous and hence not affected by the short-run movements in 

POOL_ES.
43

 Moreover, this weak exogeneity test shows that TTF is endogenous to 

POOL_ES, probably because some long-term oil indexed contracts still dominate in this 

market, setting up the TTF spot price. 

However, some remarks
44

 made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) refer that the 

majority of natural gas in UK is sold at the NBP prices (around 60%), while the remainder 

is sold by long-term oil indexed contracts. Research by Neumann et al. (2005) has provided 

evidence that there is a strong evidence of market integration between NPB and ZEE (see

Section 2.4 and Chapter 5), so it seems reasonable to conclude that NBP and ZEE are 

weakly exogenous in relation to POOL_ES because in Spain the majority of CCGT power 

plants have long-term oil indexed contracts for natural gas supply. 

Observing the Granger causality tests (Table 7), for the considered price series in levels, to 

check if there were any signs of strong exogeneity for the weak exogenous variables, a 

causal relationship was found for the pair PNX-POOL_ES. It is possible to say that the 

French wholesale electricity spot price (PNX), where evidence of strong exogeneity was 

found, doesn’t have a long-term and a short-term relationship with POOL_ES. 

Table 7 - Granger Causality test 

 

Notes: H0:  is not Granger Cause of  ( ) 

A possible justification for this strong exogeneity of PNX could be the fact that PNX is a 

price formed in the day-ahead spot market Powernext, separated from the Iberian market by 

interconnections with limited capacity (interconnections capacity restrictions between 

countries is also an issue that can create some obstacles to a greater market integration 

among adjacent markets). 

Moreover, the share structure of the French wholesale electricity market is quite different 

from the Spanish one (in terms of levels of demand and technologies supported) with 

different fuel price references associated to French generation assets in the wholesale 

market. Correlation levels between PNX and POOL_ES and the PNX price volatility 

(measured by coefficient of variation) when compared with POOL_ES could demonstrate 

this fact as referred in Chapter 5. Looking at the 2008 generation statistics published by the

each technology in each country (Figure 25).

6.4 PROPORTIONALITY 

Finally, this section will address the issue whether POOL_ES and each considered price 

series, for which a long-run relationship was found, are proportional, i.e., whether the 

spreads and relative prices are constant. 

To obtain more information about these relationships, a test for price proportionality in 

bivariate relationships between POOL_ES and each considered price series was carried out. 

The results are reported in Table 8.

Table 8 - Price proportionality tests 

 

The hypothesis of price proportionality is rejected, at 5% (significance level), between 

POOL_ES and coal prices (API4 and API2), gasoil prices (GO_ARA) and POOL_PT 

prices. The other considered prices are proportional with POOL_ES. These results indicate 

that changes in crude oil prices, natural gas prices and also in the French wholesale 

electricity spot prices are fully reflected in the prices of the Spanish wholesale electricity 

spot prices, but only partly in coal, gasoil and in the electricity spot prices formed in 

Portugal. However, it is important to remember that the following price series are weak 

exogenous: the natural gas prices NBP and ZEE and also PNX. So, it is not correct to affirm 

that changes in these variables are fully reflected in POOL_ES because these variables in 

question do not have long-run relationships with POOL_ES. So, the only variables that fail 

to reject the possibility of being proportional with POOL_ES are crude oil prices and the 

TTF natural gas. 

In Figure 26 it is possible to see the evolution of the electricity volume by thermal 

technologies matched over 95% of marginal price POOL_ES. One method to check what 

kind of thermal technologies are setting the wholesale marginal spot price is looking at their 

bidding structure in terms of price, reflecting fuel costs and volume.

Figure 26 - Electricity volume by thermal technologies matched over 95% of marginal price 

 

In period under analysis, 8692 GWh of thermal technologies matched over 95% of marginal 

price POOL_ES. From this total volume, CCGT power plants have a share of 69%, Coal 

power plants have a share of 28% and Fuel/Gas power plants with the residual share of 3%. 

Figure 27 shows the evolution of the price bid by thermal technologies matched over 95% 

of marginal price and also the evolution of POOL_ES, BRENT and TTF. 

Observing Figure 26 and Figure 27, it is easy to conclude that CCGT is the most used 

technology that basically formed the marginal price of OMEL wholesale market. So, 

analyzing the impact of its fuel costs into their bidding structure is an important issue to 

discuss.

The proportionality test offered conclusive results that there is a full price reflection 

between BRENT

 and POOL_ES prices. TTF is also proportional with POOL_ES. Since 

CCGT is the major marginal technology which determines the power pool prices and CCGT 

fuel is natural gas, full reflection of the crude oil prices and TTF in the natural gas formula 

of the long-term natural gas supply should certainly occur. 

Coal prices and gasoil prices are partly reflected in POOL_ES because the remaining 

thermal power plants have a minor influence in the determination of the marginal price of 

the Spanish wholesale market (coal technology with 28% and fuel/gas technology with 3%). 

Gasoil price, as referred in Chapter 5, can be a fuel reference for the Fuel/Gas thermal 

power plants. 

Changes in POOL_PT are partly reflect in POOL_ES because during the analysis period, 

Portugal has been more an importer of electric energy than exporter (with electricity spot 

prices higher than the Spanish area) due to different structural market conditions in which 

                                                      

 

46
 To simplify this analysis, since there is a strong correlation and practically the same volatility among the 

considered crude oil prices, only BRENT shall be considered the benchmark crude oil reference.

Spain has more considerably efficient power generation assets than Portugal. These 

conditions can be found in Figure 28.  

Figure 28 - Spreads evolution of the Portuguese and the Spanish OMEL spot prices 

 

The positive spread values indicate that the Portuguese electricity spot price is higher than 

the Spanish electricity spot price. The use of the cross-border interconnection between 

Portugal and Spain also reflects the direction of the energy flow from the cheaper area to the 

more expensive one (in this case the majority of electric energy flows from Spain to 

Portugal). Cross-border available interconnection capacity is the main restriction that does 

not facilitate price transmission between both systems. If there were more capacity available 

due to new interconnections investments between Portugal and Spain, probably the 

convergence to a unique MIBEL spot price would occur, with full price transmission 

between POOL_PT and POOL_ES. 

6.5 ASYMMETRY 

To conclude the empirical analysis presented here, this section shows the results of 

asymmetry tests conducted on the residuals of each long-term equation, with the aim of 

confirming the symmetrical adjustment of the estimated models.

Using the threshold methodology (TAR and MTAR approach) as described in Section 4.3.4 

in order to verify whether price adjustment of each considered price series in analysis is 

asymmetric to POOL_ES. Eleven OLS equations were estimated in the same sequence as 

shown in Table 9. 

POOL_ES is the dependent variable, object of this study, and the above mentioned 

independent variables are the explanatory variables. The OLS residuals obtained from each 

simple regression model were then used to estimate the thresholds. Table 9 summarizes the 

results for the relevant tests of the null hypotheses that: 

1.  and ; 

2. ; 

3. . 

Notice that the third test only makes sense when the two previous tests conclude the 

rejection of the null hypothesis. That is, if the  coefficients estimated for the threshold are 

significantly different from zero, then the regression is non-trivial and testing for symmetry 

makes all the sense.

The presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of each TAR and MTAR equation was 

tested by Durbin–Watson (DW) statistic
47

. Results from the DW statistic shows that there is 

not autocorrelation in the residuals of each TAR and MTAR equation defined for each 

relationship between POOL_ES and each of the other considered independent variables. 

The negative sign of the coefficients  and  guarantees the stationarity of the variables. 

Menezes and Dionísio (2003) have provided evidence that “…a sufficient condition for the 

stationarity of  is ”. 

The test statistic  (given by the t-Max distribution) and  (given by the  distribution) 

are used to test the null hypothesis of no cointegration (i.e., , hypothesis tested 

using the usual F-statistic)) in the TAR and MTAR models respectively. Critical values are 

reported by Enders and Siklos (2001). If the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, 

then one may proceed to test for the null hypothesis of symmetry (i.e., , hypothesis 

tested using the usual F-statistic). 

The calculated  and  are above their critical values at 5% (significance level) except 

for the crude oil prices in which it wasn’t possible to determine the asymmetric 

cointegration level using the TAR/MTAR methodology (the only way to check 

cointegration between symmetric variables is applying the Johansen cointegration test). The 

results of Enders and Siklos (2001) show that standard tests of cointegration exhibit low 

power in the presence of asymmetric cointegration and consequently failure to detect 

cointegration using standard tests may be due to presence of asymmetric behaviour. 

POOL_PT is the only independent variable that is asymmetric with POOL_ES in “steep” 

movements (at 5% significance level there is rejection of the null hypothesis of symmetry 

test applied to the MTAR equation). Moreover, POOL_PT doesn’t exhibit different degrees 

of autoregressive decay depending on the behaviour of the lagged residual and its first-

difference respectively because the asymmetry test applied to TAR equation doesn’t reject 

the null hypothesis of symmetry). The other independent variables, except the crude oil 

prices (due to inconclusive asymmetric cointegration test results it was not possible to 

perform the asymmetry test for each crude oil), are symmetric with POOL_ES.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Price discovery among wholesale electricity spot prices in Spain and prices of major 

electricity generating fuels such as crude oil, coal, gasoil and natural gas, is analyzed. By 

including both fuel (inputs) and electricity (output) prices, this study shows that there are 

dynamic relationships between input and output prices which confirm that electricity prices 

are directly impacted by fuel prices. It is also relevant to analyze the dynamic relationship 

between interconnected systems (Spain and Portugal, Spain and France), using as an input 

the electric spot price formed in each electrical system, because it might also have an impact 

on the evolution of the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. 

The first finding in this study is that Spanish wholesale electricity spots prices, the fuel 

prices and wholesale electricity spot prices formed in Portugal and France are cointegrated 

(nonstationarity of each price data was confirmed). Therefore, there is a long-term 

equilibrium relationship between the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices and coal 

prices, crude oil prices, gasoil prices, Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices and TTF 

natural gas prices. Short-term relationships have been detected between Spanish wholesale 

electricity spot prices and natural gas prices from NBP and Zeebrugge natural gas hubs. 

Long-term relationships between the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices and crude oil 

prices, gasoil prices and TTF natural gas prices show that crude oil prices directly or 

indirectly (setting the price of refined oil products and natural gas) also have an impact on 

electricity prices, even though crude oil plays a minor role as a primary energy source for 

electricity generation. This increasing dependence on these inputs, coupled with the fact that 

CCGTs are often the price-setting technology in OMEL, implies that the link between the 

gas and electricity markets is crucial to an understanding of the dynamics of both markets. 

In addition, the long-term relationship between the wholesale electricity spot prices formed 

in Portugal and Spain is justified by the integration of Portugal and Spain in the same 

wholesale market, MIBEL, which confirms why the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot 

price evolution is strongly linked to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot price evolution. 

The second finding determined that the French wholesale electricity spot prices were 

strongly exogenous to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Comparing the two 

electrical systems, the generation structure share of the French wholesale electricity market 

is quite different from the Spanish one (in terms of levels of demand and technologies

supported) with different fuel price references associated to French generation assets in the 

wholesale market. The difference between the market liquidity in each market is also an 

issue that could create greater price volatility in the French market when compared to the 

more liquid Spanish market. Less liquidity in France is due to a higher percentage of 

bilateral power contracts entered into by power producers and retailers. Furthermore, 

another issue that can contribute for the presence of exogeneity in the French wholesale 

electricity spot prices is the price transmission in two interconnected systems with limited 

capacity, because it is a physical restriction that could create some obstacles to greater 

market integration among adjacent markets. 

Third, no proportionality was found between coal prices, gasoil prices and the Portuguese 

wholesale electricity spot prices and the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Coal 

prices and gasoil prices are partly reflected in the Spanish wholesale electricity spot price 

because the remaining thermal coal and Fuel/Gas power plants have a minor influence on 

setting up the marginal price of the Spanish wholesale electricity market. Moreover, 

changes in the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices are partly reflected in the 

Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices because throughout the analysis period, Portugal 

has imported more electric energy than exported it (with higher electricity spot prices than 

the ones in Spain because of the “market splitting” mechanism) due to different structural 

market conditions in which Spain has considerably more efficient power generation assets 

than Portugal. 

However, there is a full price reflection between the crude oil prices, TTF natural gas and 

the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices. Given the fact that CCGT is the major 

marginal technology that sets up the power pool prices and CCGT fuel is natural gas, full 

reflection of the crude oil prices and TTF in the natural gas formula of the long-term natural 

gas supply should certainly occur. 

Fourth and finally, the Portuguese wholesale electricity spot prices are asymmetric in 

relation to the Spanish wholesale electricity spot prices in “steep” movements. The 

difference between both prices (spreads) over time may give a perspective of this 

movement. Basically, during the second half of 2007, following the official start of MIBEL, 

major spreads were found when compared with the remaining period. This fact may indicate 

that some structural changes occurred over time in the distribution of the generation share 

by technologies in Portugal.
