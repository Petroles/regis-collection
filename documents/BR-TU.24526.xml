ABSTRACT 

CO2-EOR is an important injection agent in oil reservoir due to its miscibility and 

swelling effects. Concerning the miscibility effect, molecular diffusion is the process describing 

the natural mixture of miscible fluids, whose main modeling parameter is the molecular diffusion 

coefficient. The aim of this study is to measure the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor of 

CO2 in light crude oil under different experimental conditions concerning pressure, temperature 

and oil composition. In order to obtain the diffusion coefficient, two experimental techniques 

were run in parallel: the well-established and so-called pressure decay method and a CT scan 

method that was still under investigation. The later method was also used to obtain the swelling 

factor in the selected experimental conditions.  

 The oil studied was light oil from Brazilian subsalt oil reservoirs. Tests were carried on a 

specially constructed vertical high pressure cell, from 2.76 MPa to 28.96 MPa (400 psi to 4200 

psi) at 293.15 K (20oC) and just 10.34 MPa (1500 psi) at 341.15 K (65oC). 

Molecular diffusion is particularly important for miscible gas flooding processes, as 

diffusion is a key mechanism controlling the miscibility between oil and gas. The diffusion 

coefficient determines the rate of mass transfer during the diffusive process that will result in a 

miscible system. The diffusivity of solvents into light oil in porous media has become of great 

significance in petroleum engineering, since CO2 injection has been proposed more and more as 

the enhanced oil recovery method to be applied in the reserves of conventional oils. 

The swelling effect of crude oil with CO2 increases the oil formation volume factor so 

that residual oil after waterflooding is smaller in volume at surface conditions. The extent of the 

expansion or swelling is measured by the swelling factor. 

While diffusion in CO2-heavy oils systems has attracted some attention, the subject in 

light crude oils is scarcely described in the public literature. Such prospect needs therefore to be 

thoroughly investigated for the pre-salt reservoirs offshore Brazil, where oil has an API gravity 

between 28 and 30 and a variable contents of CO2. Due to such properties, differences in the 

models regarding boundary conditions at the interface and in the thermodynamics of the CO2-

volatile oil must be taken into consideration.

Diffusion coefficients were obtained using only the pressure decay technique throughout 

Etminan et al. (2013) interface resistance model. The obtained diffusion coefficients were within 

the ranges previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, another parameter obtained with the 

model, namely the mass transfer coefficient, allowed identifying that there was almost no mass 

transfer resistance in the interface in original oil. 

Despite the CT limitations to obtain CO2 concentration, CT investigation could offer an 

important insight on CO2 diffusion inside the oil column. In contrast the swelling effect could be 

clearly observed and characterized through this method.

RESUMO 

O CO2 utilizado na recuperação avançada em reservatórios de petróleo é um importante 

agente de injeção devido a suas características de miscibilidade e de inchamento. No que tange a 

miscibilidade, a difusão molecular é o processo que descreve a mistura natural de fluidos 

miscíveis, e seu principal parâmetro é o coeficiente de difusão molecular. O objetivo deste estudo 

é medir o coeficiente de difusão bem como o fator de inchamento do CO2 em óleos leves em 

diferentes condições experimentais envolvendo pressão, temperatura e composição do óleo. Com 

intuito de obter o coeficiente de difusão, duas técnicas experimentais foram realizadas em 

paralelo: uma primeira técnica conhecida como decaimento de pressão e outra chamada de 

tomografia computadorizada. Esta última, apesar de ainda estar em processo de investigação, 

permitiu também a obtenção do fator de inchamento nas condições experimentais selecionadas. 

O óleo estudado é um óleo leve proveniente dos reservatórios do pré-sal no Brasil. Os 

testes foram efetuados em uma célula para altas pressões especialmente desenvolvida para esses 

ensaios que envolvem tomografia computadorizada. As pressões e temperatura variaram de 2.76 

MPa a 28.96 MPa a 293.15 K e somente 10.34 MPa a 341.15 K.  

A difusão molecular é considerada um mecanismo chave que controla a miscibilidade 

entre o óleo e o gás. Sabendo que o coeficiente de difusão determina a taxa de transferência de 

massa durante o processo, a difusão de solventes em óleo leve dentro de um meio poroso se 

tornou de grande importância na engenharia de petróleo.  

Em paralelo, o inchamento do óleo bruto com CO2 aumenta o fator de volume de 

formação do óleo a tal ponto que o óleo residual remanescente após a injeção de água é menor 

em volume nas condições de superfície. A extensão do aumento ou do inchamento é medida pelo 

fator de inchamento. 

Nos últimos anos a difusão do CO2 em óleo pesado tem atraído uma maior atenção, 

enquanto que a difusão em óleo leve tem sido pouco estudada na literatura. Com foco nos 

reservatórios do pré-sal no litoral brasileiro, onde o óleo tem entre 28 a 30 graus API e 

concentrações variadas de CO2, diferentes modelos de difusão envolvendo as condições de 

fronteira na interface e a termodinâmica do CO2-óleo volátil precisam ser levados em 

consideração.

No presente trabalho, os coeficientes de difusão puderam ser obtidos somente através da 

técnica experimental de decaimento de pressão por meio do modelo de resistência na interface 

proposto por Etminan et al. (2013). Os coeficientes de difusão estavam dentro dos intervalos 

reportados previamente na literatura. Além disso, um outro parâmetro, o coeficiente de 

transferência de massa, permitiu identificar que a resistência à transferência de massa na interface 

era praticamente insignificante no óleo original. 

Apesar das limitações do método de tomografia computadorizada na obtenção das 

concentrações de CO2 no óleo, a investigação desse método ofereceu uma melhor compreensão 

do fenômeno da difusão do CO2 dentro da coluna de óleo. Em contrapartida, o inchamento pôde 

ser claramente observado e caracterizado através desse método.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Oil recovery changes along reservoir producing life. First, it relies on reservoir natural 

energy (primary recovery) until it is depleted. So additional energy is required throughout 

physical displacement (secondary recovery) during its viable economic lifetime. A different kind 

of additional energy (tertiary recovery) enhances fluid flow conditions due to increasing oil 

mobility by changing oil properties through either the addition of heat, the chemical interaction 

between the injected fluid and the reservoir oil or the mass transfer. 

All information above is described in Figure 1.1, where it is pointed out the difference 

between IOR (Increased Oil Recovery) and EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery). The first one still has 

a wide range of techniques covering, besides water flooding or gas pressure maintenance. The 

last one comprises only the thermal, the chemical and the gas miscible/immiscible (Stosur et al., 

2003).

Since in 1950, CO2-EOR appeared as an important injection agent in oil reservoir due to 

its high level of solubility in oil and low level in water. This main characteristic leads to the 

following factors that make CO2 an effective EOR agent (Carcoana, 1992): 

• miscibility effects, given the fact that since CO2 is not first-contact miscible with 

reservoir oils, it may develop miscibility through multiple contacts under specific 

conditions of pressure and temperature and with specific oil compositions; 

• swelling of crude oil and reduction in oil density; 

• reduction in the water-oil mobility ratio as oil viscosity is reduced expressively 

when CO2 is dissolved in crude oil followed by a small increase in water 

viscosity; 

• acid effect on carbonate and shaley rocks. 

Within the context of pre-salt reservoirs offshore Brazil, a sustainable hydrocarbon 

production will require the re-injection of the produced CO2-rich stream into the reservoir. 

During a gas injection operation, the amount of gas to be injected and the time reserved to reach 

the desired mobility of reservoir fluids are constraints that need to be determined for field design 

and reservoir simulation. The definition of such constraints requires the provision of data 

concerning the solubility and diffusivity of the gas in oil under reservoir conditions 

(Tharanivasan et al., 2006). The definition of the molecular diffusion coefficient in a 

multicomponent system is for instance very difficult to be determined without experimental 

measurements. Thus, several methods have been developed to determine the solvent-oil diffusion 

coefficient. On the other hand, oil swelling increases the recovery factor since, for a given 

residual oil saturation, the mass of the oil remaining in the reservoir is lower than if the 

abandoned oil were CO2 free, as described by Carcoana (1992). 

While diffusion in CO2-heavy oils systems has attracted some attention, the subject in 

light crude oils is scarcely described in the public literature (Guo et al., 2009). Such prospect 

needs therefore to be thoroughly investigated for the above referred pre-salt reservoirs offshore 

Brazil, where oil has an API gravity between 28 and 30, a gas-oil ratio between 200 and 350 

m3/m3 and a variable contents of CO2 (8 to 15 per cent) (Estrella, 2011). Due to such properties, 

differences in the models regarding boundary conditions at the interface and in the 

thermodynamics of the CO2-volatile oil must be taken into consideration.

1.1. Objectives 
The aim of this study is to measure the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor of CO2 in 

light crude oil under different experimental conditions concerning pressure, temperature and oil 

composition. In order to obtain the diffusion coefficient, two experimental techniques were run in 

parallel: the well-established and so-called pressure decay method and a CT scan method that 

was still under investigation. The later method was also used to obtain the swelling factor in the 

selected experimental conditions.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

Within the context of miscibility of CO2 in oil, molecular diffusion figures as the main 

phenomenon of interest now. In this chapter, the molecular diffusion and its main parameter the 

diffusion coefficient will be described. One first possible way of obtaining such key parameter is 

through empirical or theoretical correlations. This offers nevertheless several problems 

concerning the target system characteristics. Consequently, focus will be given to two 

experimental methods, namely pressure decay and CT scan, alongside their respective models. 

Finally a similar analysis will also be performed with swelling.      

2.1. Molecular Diffusion 
Here it is firstly important to differentiate miscibility from solubility. The first one is valid 

when two or more fluids form a single homogeneous phase in all mixed proportions while for the 

last one this happens only for a single level of proportions (Aljarwan, 2012). In addition to this, 

two miscible fluids will in the case of EOR present no interface and no capillary effect when in 

contact with porous media.  

In 1976, Holm compared CO2 to other recovery agents in miscible displacement like light 

hydrocarbons enriched gases and other solvents. CO2 was for instance the only one to reach 

miscible displacement at the lowest pressures (6.89 MPa to 20.68 MPa or 1000 psi to 3000 psi), 

and it was also suitable to reservoirs that have been exhausted of their gas and LPG components. 

Furthermore, CO2 presents additional advantages in terms of availability, cost, and operational 

handling (Holm, 1976). 

 Such properties make CO2 the preferred gas in water-alternating-gas (WAG) processes. 

In such processes, water and CO2 are alternatively injected until a well-defined volume of last 

one is attained, being afterwards followed by a continuous water injection. Compared with 

waterflooding without CO2, WAG processes improve mobility ratio and additional recovery. 

In order to determine operating constraints for WAG processes, it is necessary to observe 

conditions that affect the multiple contacts in the miscibility developed by CO2. 

There are several factors that affect CO2 miscible displacement. In regard to mixing 

mechanisms, there are three that contribute to this displacement process: microscopic convective 

5 
 



 

dispersion, macroscopic convective dispersion, and molecular diffusion. The last one has an 

important role on the recovery of residual oil at pore scale. At low solvent flow rates and long 

residence time, diffusion between CO2 and oil interacts effectively to remaining unrecoverable 

oil, which is subsequently recovered by swelling (Aljarwan, 2012). Furthermore, the diffusion 

promotes mixing between the injected solvent and the oil, prevents viscous fingering, retards gas 

breakthrough and therefore improves the sweep efficiency for enhancing oil recovery (Guo et al., 

2009).  

Complementary to what has been previously mentioned, in the case of gas-based heavy 

oil recovery, it has been recognized that the molecular diffusion has a significant role during the 

soaking time while the convective-dispersion is predominant during the time of solvent injection 

(Tharanivasan et al., 2006). 

Thus, in the succeeding subsections, molecular diffusion and swelling will be detailed in 

terms of fluid and fluid contact without considering fluid displacement in porous media. In such 

way dispersion will be ignored. 

2.2. Correlations for Molecular Diffusion 
It is well established that the diffusion coefficient measured in a two-component system 

depends on the presence or absence of a chemical concentration gradient (Prager, 1953).  

The common theoretical methods that predicts diffusion coefficient are limited, many of 

them do not interpret adequately the kinetic phenomena because of several assumptions adopted. 

The Chapman-Enskog theory describes diffusion in low-pressure binary-gas mixtures, but it not 

applicable for liquids, while the Stokes-Einstein theory is appropriate only to ideal liquid 

mixtures. Thus, none of them can be used to real liquid mixtures. (Leahy-Dios and Firoozabadi, 

2007). 

Due to this problem, several semi-empirical equations have been proposed in the literature 

to estimate these coefficients. The Wilke-Chang correlation is suitable only for diluted systems 

and at lower viscosities, conditions that are far from oil reservoirs. The Vignes equation is 

considered a very useful way to calculate the diffusion coefficient as function of the 

concentration for systems involving hydrocarbons solvent and heavy oil, but it is limited to oil 

viscosity (Guerrero-Aconcha, 2009). 

6 
 



 

Concerned about a correlation for non-ideal gas and liquid multicomponent mixtures, 

Leahy-Dios and Firoozabadi (2007) proposed a unified model to determine D for non-ideal and 

non-polar multicomponent mixtures. They developed a new correlation based on 889 

experimental data for non-polar mixtures and found a general functional form where infinite 

dilution-diffusion coefficient was dependent on viscosity, reduced temperature, reduced pressure 

and acentric factor of each component. With the dilution-diffusion coefficient found, the 

generalized Vignes relation to multicomponent mixtures is used to obtain the Stefan-Maxwell 

diffusion coefficient. This later coefficient is used to calculate the element of a square matrix 

which now is used to determine Fickian diffusion (mole based) in a non-ideal multicomponent 

mixture based on the relationship between Stefan-Maxwell and Fickian diffusive fluxes. In 

Stefan-Maxwell diffusive flux, the matrix of thermodynamic factor is calculated from PR-EoS, 

which has high precision for non-ideal hydrocarbon mixtures.  

2.3. Experimental Methods  
As aforementioned, the molecular diffusion coefficient in a multicomponent system is 

very difficult to be determined without experimental measurements. Thus, several methods have 

been developed to determine the solvent-liquid diffusion coefficient. They are split in two 

conventional techniques: direct and indirect methods. In direct methods, the gas concentration is 

analyzed with an analytical device. This procedure disturbs the system every time the sample is 

taken, reducing the accuracy of the measurements. On the other hand, the indirect methods 

implicate in observing some property of the gas–liquid system which evolves with the gas 

dissolution.  

In order to develop proper gas-injection strategies, accurate values of relevant parameters 

such as gas-diffusion coefficient, interface mass-transfer coefficient and the liquid swelling 

coefficient are required for reservoir simulation and prediction of oil recovery by miscible 

flooding and the optimization of miscibility for best recovery (Civan and Rasmussen, 2006). To 

properly acquire those parameters experimentally, the indirect methods can be represented by: 

pressure decay (PD) method, the constant pressure dissolving gas volumes (CPDGV) method, the 

low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra change method, the X-ray computer-

assisted tomography (CAT) method, the gas permeation through an immobilized liquid 

7 
 



 

membrane (ILM) method implemented in a diffusion cell, and the dynamic pendant drop volume 

analysis (DPDVA) method.  

With proper description of the dissolution and evaporation process, diffusion coefficient 

can be inferred from changes in bulk properties. Those properties can be volume, pressure, solute 

volatilization rate, position of the gas-liquid interface, refraction of electromagnetic radiation, etc. 

The medium property changed by the diffusing species is correlated with the composition. After 

the composition of the bulk is established, a mass transfer model as those that will be described 

later is required to determine diffusivity. Some indirect methods, like NMR and CAT, can 

estimate diffusivity by measuring the self-diffusion coefficients. Those methods on self-diffusion 

coefficients are limited by the empirical mixing rules used to calculate the concentration-

dependent diffusivity. In general, indirect methods are based on several simplifications, described 

in the upcoming section. 

Next, the experimental methods that were chosen for the present work will be described.  

2.3.1. Pressure decay 

The pressure decay method is a non-intrusive experimental method, where no 

compositional measurements are necessary. It starts when a non-equilibrium gas is displaced into 

a constant-volume constant-temperature PVT cell to remain in contact with a liquid. The gas 

initial pressure starts decaying as the molecular diffusion of the gas into the liquid proceeds until 

the system reaches the equilibrium. In other words, it means that the oil interface is entirely 

saturated with the gas. In a constant temperature, the measured pressure versus time and the 

proposed model are used to extract a correct value of diffusion coefficient that best represents this 

diffusion process (Riazi, 1996).  

2.3.2. CT scan 

2.3.2.1. Principles 
This technique, well-known as x-ray tomography, has been widely used in research 

laboratories for reservoir rock characterization and fluid flow visualization. The fundamentals 

behind CT scan are that the object internal structure can be reconstructed from its multiple 

projections. In details, when an X-ray beam traverses an object, its intensity is attenuated as the 

8 
 



 

X-ray photons are absorbed (photoelectric absorption) or scattered (Compton scattering and 

Rayleigh scattering). While the photoelectric absorption is a process dependent on the component 

atomic number and the energy of the X-ray beam, the Compton scattering is influenced by the 

component bulk density. 

The attenuation coefficient represents quantitatively how easily a material or medium can 

be penetrated by a beam of X-ray. It can be expressed as a function of the X-ray beam photon 

energy, the atomic number, and the electron density of the substance. Usually, Raleigh scattering 

is neglected, and then the attenuation coefficient can be expressed as the sum of Compton and 

photoelectric contributions (Eq. 2.1). When a high-energy X-ray source is used, the contribution 

from photoelectric absorption can be negligible and the attenuation coefficient  ?  becomes 

proportional to the bulk density of the object, as the Compton scattering dominates. 

? =  ? ?? ???(?) +  
?Z?3.8

?3.2
? 2.1 

where ?  is the mass density, ??  is the mass electron density, ??(?)  is the Klein-Nishima 

function, Ze is the effective atomic number, E is the photon energy in KeV and b is a constant 

(Niu, 2010). 

The amount that describes how effortlessly an X-ray beam can penetrate in a medium is 

named linear attenuation coefficient and is a result of the influence of the three different photon 

interactions cited above.  

Lambert-Beer’s law is set to measure the intensity of X-ray after it crossed the 

component: 

I = I0exp (?µ?) 2.2 

where ? is the thickness of the penetration material, Io and I are the intensity of the incident x-ray 

and the transmitted one respectively. This law shows that photons with lower energy are absorbed 

firstly while the remaining ones are those with higher energy, thus the beam becomes harder. 

This brings on the total attenuation to change with distance and produce an artifact identified as 

beam hardening. This artifact and other image quality issues will be discussed in Image quality 

subsection.

2.3.2.2. Quantitative information 
The quantitative information from CT scanning is given by the measured attenuation 

coefficients changed using the value for pure water as reference, being represented as CT 

numbers (CTn) in Hounsfield units (H.U), 

CTn = 1000 
µ ? µwater
µwater

 2.3 

where, µ and µ water are the linear attenuation coefficient for the tested material and pure water. 

The possibility of obtaining density from the CT number can be employed because x-ray 

attenuation coefficients are both dependent on bulk density and atomic number (see Eq. 2.1).  

For those materials where X-ray attenuation takes place, primarily only due to Compton 

scattering, there is a linear relationship (Eq. 2.4) between CT number and density (that varies 

accordingly to CT scanner type used.  

? =  ?. CTn + ? 2.4 

where ? and ? are constants accordantly to the measured energy level and CT-scan employed. 

For other materials with atomic numbers that contributes to both Compton scattering and 

photoelectric attenuation of X-rays, a dual energy measurement should be taken in order to have 

a correct relationship between CT numbers and densities.  The method for determining density of 

those materials is described in details in the United States Patent Number 5063509 (Coles et al., 

1991). 

? = (?CT? + ? CT?
1

+ ?)/? 2.5 

where ?, ? and ? are constants accordantly to the measured energy level and CT-scan employed. 

To obtain both Eq. 2.4 and Eq. 2.5, a series of calibration tests for liquid and solid 

samples of known densities need to be accomplished. For the first equation, where only materials 

with Compton scattering takes place, only a single energy X-ray source is used while for the 

second equation dual energy source calibration tests are needed (Coles et al., 1991). 

With one of those density and CT relationships above, the next step is to obtain solvent 

concentration in accordance to mixture density obtained.  

For liquid solvents in oil, the mixtures rules equation can be used to predict the density of 

the solvent-oil mixture when there is no volume change after both components are mixed: 
10 

 



 

?mix =  (1 ? Csolvent) ?oil +  Csolvent ?solvent 2.6 

Eq. 2.6 can be rearranged in Eq. 2.7:  

Csol =  
?mix ? ?oil
?sol ? ?oil

 2.7 

Replacing the densities values in this last equation by Eq. 2.4, Eq. 2.8 is established as the 

most important relationship employed to find solvent concentration in oil columns after CT 

numbers are measured. In the case CT number and density that varies according to Eq. 2.4, the 

following equation can be used: 

Csol =  
CTmix ? CToil
CTsol ? CToil

 2.8 

Once, the rule of mixtures cannot be employed for gas solvents in oil, a correlation should 

be used to obtain solvent concentration in relation to solvent-oil mixture density. Guerrero-

Aconcha et al. (2008) had already referred to this issue in their work as it will be detailed in the 

next section. The work from Emera and Sarma (2008) presented a correlation to predict CO2-oil 

density for dead and live oils over a wider range and conditions. A Genetic Agorithm based 

correlation accounts for saturation pressure, temperature, oil specific gravity and initial density at 

the specified temperature.  

2.3.2.3. Dopants 
When CT numbers of fluids do not differ as much as possible to reduce error, dopants are 

usually employed to increase CT number in one of the fluids. The majority of dopants applied in 

liquid phase have halide, which has a high atomic number, producing more attenuation of X-ray 

and thus requiring dual energy measurement in order to have a good relationship between CTs 

and density (Eq. 2.5).  

So for small difference in attenuation coefficients (CT numbers) between different fluids, 

sodium bromide or sodium iodide are generally used as water dopants, while bromo-dodecane 

and iodo-dodecane are employed as oil dopants. 

11 
 



 

Once the choice of dopants is made, its addition should be done carefully, since they 

affect the thermodynamic properties of oil phase (viscosity, bubble point and minimum 

miscibility pressure). 

2.3.2.4. Image quality (Niu, 2010). 
The term ‘Artefact’ stands for the difference between the CT number in CT image and the 

true attenuation coefficient of the objects, which affects the image quality. In CT scan application 

in core analysis, there are two perceptible and downgrading physical based artifacts: the most 

noticeable one is called beam hardening and the other one is the photon starvation. 

As mentioned previously in this section, beam hardening happens because the low-energy 

photons are more quickly attenuated than the high-energy photons, which causes the beam to 

become harder and more penetrating. The quantity of beam hardening rests on the initial X-ray 

spectrum and the composition of the material crossed. Images affected by the beam hardening are 

typically characterized with high attenuation coefficients around the periphery of the object and 

low attenuation coefficients in the center of the object. In practice, a filter can be used to reduce 

the influence of beam hardening on the image. 

Photon starvation on the other hand causes streak artefacts as an insufficient amount of 

photons passes through the widest part of the materials. This artefacts normally happens when the 

core or core holder are scanned vertically. In the present work, the diffusion cell is also placed 

vertically. That is why some considerations have to be made in order to design the cell that will 

be scanned during the diffusion test. Aluminum and carbon fiber are the materials that can be 

used in CT scan. Aluminum is used for low pressure conditions while a carbon fiber wrapped 

aluminum cell is suitable for high pressure conditions. This last combination is done because with 

the increasing thickness of aluminum cell more photons are absorbed by the cell before enter in 

the fluid inside it. 

Another consideration to avoid artefact is that all objects should have round geometry to 

reduce photon starvation inside the scanner that is circular. Furthermore, the table should be 

made of wood and the diameter of the surrounding lines should be as small as possible, to reduce 

the loss of photons. 

12 
 



 

Increasing some machine parameters such as the potential difference across the tube (kV) 

and the output of the tube (mA·s) enabling higher electron speed and also higher energy of the X-

ray photons, resulting in improved image quality with less noise in the center of the object. 

Increasing the two machine parameters above could therefore prevent several image 

quality issues – this was nevertheless not possible given the limitations of the here employed 

medical CT scanner with fixed energy level and care dose limitations. 

2.4. Diffusion Models  
The classical Fick’s law is the most popular diffusion model in reservoir engineering, and 

it is mainly employed for binary mixtures. Otherwise it can also be used for ideal 

multicomponent mixture (pseudo-binary) considering that each component diffuses as a result of 

its own concentration gradient and diffusion coefficients which can be regarded as equal.  

Bird et al. (2007) started his diffusivity study with binary diffusion using the one-

dimensional form of Fick’s law of diffusion which defines how the molecular mass flux of 

species A in vertical direction z (jAz) in a binary mixture at a steady-state is transported by means 

of molecular motions per unit of area. The proportionality factor ?AB below is the diffusivity. 

jAz =  ???AB
dwA
dz

 2.9 

where ? is the density of the system A and B and wA is the mass fraction of A. 

The vector form of the equation above: 

jA =  ???AB?wA 2.10 

As stated before, in addition to transport by molecular motion (jA), mass may also be 

transported by the bulk motion (?Av) of the fluid. Later the molecular mass flux vector and the 

convective mass flux vector are added together to get the combined mass flux vector (nA): 

nA = jA + ?Av 2.11 

where v is the mass average velocity. 

For the fixed volume element considered in this equation, the balance of mass needs to be 

analyzed assuming the following contributions: rate of increase of mass of species a per unit 

volume, net rate of addition of mass A per unit volume by convection, net rate of addition of 
13 

 



 

mass of A per unit volume by diffusion, rate of production of mass of A per unit volume by 

reaction.  

All mass flux mentioned before are the combined ones that includes both the molecular 

flux and the convective flux and results in the equation of continuity for species A that can be put 

in the equivalent form: 

??
?wA
?t

+ (v ? ?wA)? = ? (? ? jA) +  rA 2.12 

where rA represents the rate of production of mass of A per unit volume by reaction. 

Considering a binary system with constant ??AB, Fick’s law of diffusion can be used: 

??
?wA
?t

+ (v ? ?wA)? = ??AB?2wA +  rA 2.13 

If there is no chemical reaction occurring and in addition v is zero and ? is constant, the 

diffusion equation is defined as: 

?cA
?t

= ?AB?2cA 2.14 

This equation represents unsteady-state mass-transfer process where concentration (cA) at 

a given point varies with time. It is normally used for diffusion in solids or stationary liquids and 

for equimolar counter-diffusion in gases, which means that the net molar flux with respect to 

stationary coordinates is zero.  

Other additional diffusion models found in the literature alongside the classical Fick`s 

Law are the Maxwell-Stefan, the generalized Fick’s law and the irreversible thermodynamics 

formulation. The three first models are used only for molecular diffusion in single phases, i.e., 

intra-phase diffusion where diffusion is considered separately only in the gas phase and then only 

in the oil phase. But when diffusion occurs between components in the gas and oil phases, it is 

defined as interface mass transfer and the diffusion model that can be used to describe such mass 

transfer is the irreversible thermodynamic model.  

14 
 



 

2.5. Diffusion Modeling Assumptions 
Since the first mathematical model for pressure-decay experiment was formulated in 1996 

by Riazi, the available models are limited by inherent simplifying assumptions. Therefore, before 

listing the models, it is worthwhile to briefly describe those considerations.  

(a) Pseudo-binary mixtures 

There is an important difference between binary diffusion and multicomponent diffusion 

In. binary diffusion the movement of species A is always proportional to the negative of the 

concentration gradient of species A. In multicomponent diffusion, however, other interesting 

situations can arise: (i) reverse diffusion, in which a species moves against its own concentration 

gradient; (ii) osmotic diffusion, in which a species diffuses even though its concentration gradient 

is zero; (iii) diffusion barrier, when a species does not diffuse even though its concentration 

gradient is nonzero. In addition, the flux of a species is not necessarily collinear with the 

concentration gradient of that species. (Bird et al., 2007) 

(b) Natural Convection 

Mass transfer between two fluid phases happens by evaporation and condensation through 

their interface. As these processes are usually faster than the diffusive and convective time scales 

in either phase, the rate of mass transfer is controlled by how efficiently mass is transported from 

the interface and into the bulk. When the density of the heavier (lighter) phase does not increase 

(decrease) during the mixing process, there will be no natural convection and the rate of mixing is 

governed by diffusion. No bulk flow is a common assumption in the modeling of PVT cell 

experiments (Haugen and Firoozabadi, 2009). Natural convection in mixtures in which liquid 

density increases with dissolution and gas density decreases with evaporation  may affect the gas-

diffusion rate (Civan and Rasmussen, 2006). 

(c) Swelling Effect 

When swelling happens in the oil phase, the original capillary equilibrium breaks down, 

resulting in a pore-scale redistribution of the phases and then in oil mobilization. Thus an 

important factor is the time required by CO2 to swell oil significantly (Grogan and Pinczewki, 

1987). When swelling is contemplated, it is necessary to consider interface movements. Hence, a 

15 
 



 

convective term in the diffusion gas continuity equation needs to be incorporated. Swelling will 

not be taken in consideration during the present diffusion model but it will be described in details 

in the next section. 

(d) Unidirectional diffusion 

The non-volatility of oil is verified by a compositional analysis of the solvent phase after 

the diffusion test. This oil characteristic renders a one-way diffusion of the solvent in oil, 

assumed as unidirectional diffusion. 

(e) Real gas deviation factor 

In order to obtain the mass of diffused gas, a constant gas compressibility factor is usually 

employed in the literature. It is important to mention that the real-gas deviation factor might 

deviate significantly from the unity at elevated pressures. 

(f) Henry’s law 

Application of Henry’s law is questioned by Civan and Rasmussen (2006), when they say 

that the application of a non-equilibrium boundary condition alleviates the problems concerned 

by neglecting the oil volume caused by swelling and the pressure dependency of the real gas 

deviation factor. Once, the majority of methods contemplate dilute solutions to neglect both 

swelling effect and diffusion coefficient gas concentration dependency, higher concentrations of 

the dissolved gas in the liquid phase may affect the quality of estimated parameters (Rasmussen 

and Civan, 2008). 

(g) Diffusivity concentration dependency 

There are many real systems for which the diffusivity depends upon concentration. Such 

concentration-dependence exists in most systems, but often, for example in dilute solutions, the 

dependence is slight and the diffusion coefficient can be assumed constant for practical purposes. 

A number of methods have been used to obtain numerical solutions, some applicable to any type 

of concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, and others restricted to particular types, such as 

exponential or linear dependence. (Crank, 1975) 

16 
 



 

As stated by Guerrero-Aconcha (2009), for the diffusion coefficient to be considered 

constant there are three key factors that have to be achieved:  

• diffusing components should have analogous molecular diameters and molecular 

shape; 

• molecular interactions between the diffusion components should be negligible; 

• non-reacting components may be part of the system. 

(h) Interface boundary condition 

After the differential Eq. 2.14 has been integrated, constants of integration appear, and 

these have to be determined by the use of boundary conditions.  

In the beginning of the diffusion test, the concentration of gas in the oil phase is equal to 

zero. So, the initial condition is assumed to be:  

c(z, t)|t=0 = 0     0 ? z ? L 2.15 

At the bottom of the diffusion cell, the condition satisfying the impermeable boundary is 

the one which the mass transfer flux at any time is equal to zero (Neumann Boundary Condition): 

?c
?z
?
t=0

= 0    t &gt; 0 2.16 

 

Concerning the interface gas-oil, accordingly to Tharanivasan (2006), three boundary 

conditions have been established for the interface mass transfer model. 

The equilibrium boundary condition states that once the system is pressurized at the initial 

pressure, the interface becomes saturated with gas under the equilibrium pressure (Dirichlet 

Boundary Condition): 

c(z, t)|z=L = csat?Peq?    t &gt; 0 2.17 

 

This constant boundary condition is satisfactory only if the pressure decay is small. 

17 
 



 

For the quasi –equilibrium boundary condition instead of the interface be saturated with 

gas at equilibrium pressure, it is saturated under the existing pressure. Now the Dirichlet 

boundary condition is stated in function of time as: 

c(z, t)|z=L = csat[P(t)]   t &gt; 0 2.18 

The third type of boundary condition, the non-equilibrium one specifies that the gas mass 

flux across the interface is proportional to the difference between the gas concentration at the 

equilibrium pressure and the gas concentration at the interface. This proportionality in the so-

called Robin boundary condition is the mass transfer coefficient at the gas-oil interface. Usually 

as described by Rasmussen and Civan (2008) most methods ignore film-mass-transfer-

coefficient. 

D

Another Robin boundary condition, now time dependent, covers the whole range of 

equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviors. cint(t) is the concentration in equilibrium with the 

vapor pressure in the gas cap remote from the surface.

2.5.1. Models Based on Pressure Decay Experiments 

As described before, pressure decay is the most used method to obtain data that will be 

employed in diffusion models. A brief overview of ten models based on pressure decay data will 

be presented in this segment, followed by a summary in table 2.1. It is important to notice here 

that most of the discussed models involve solvents in heavy oils, except the ones from Riazi 

(1996) and Haugen and Firoozabadi (2009). 

(a) Riazi (1996) 

Riazi was the first in 1996 to present the pressure decay method. His model had as major 

assumption that equilibrium exists between liquid and gas phases at their interface. Boundary 

composition changes as pressure changes, so the Dirichlet time dependent boundary condition 

18 
 



 

type was applied (Table 2.1). Once n-pentane was the component used to diffuse methane, 

swelling effect was considered. The objective of this model was to forecast gas-liquid interface 

and pressure during diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient was considered dependent on 

concentration as time elapsed. Another important consideration was the equimolar counter-

diffusion, which means that when there is concentration gradient in the gas and liquid phases, 

diffusion will take place in both phases. In summary, Riazi’s model worked into time steps where 

diffusion coefficient and liquid height inside the cell were constant. For each period, interface 

concentration was obtained through PR-EoS using the data updated from pressure decay and 

height of liquid. The final numerical solution of his model provides changes of the average 

concentration and diffusion coefficient versus time. (Etminan et at., 2013) 

(b) Zhang et al. (2000) 

Few years after Riazi, Zhang et al. (2000) developed a simplified model. His study was 

based on gas diffusion in heavy oils, therefore interface position was considered fixed assuming 

that there was no swelling effect. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient was also considered 

constant and diffusion process was considered unidirectional. The compressibility factor was also 

assumed to be constant since pressure change during the test was small. Zhang considered for 

their analytical solution a Dirichlet interface boundary condition as constant saturation 

concentration at interface. To obtain diffusion coefficient, Zhang divided diffusion process in two 

stages, the first one, the incubation period, where pressure drops expressively and the second one 

where a straight line is obtained when experimental data is plotted on a semi-logarithm graph. 

Thus Zhang studied only this second stage and obtained from it the diffusion coefficient.  

(c) Upreti and Mehrotra (2000) 

After Zhang, Upreti and Mehrotra in 2000 also studied diffusion in heavy oils using 

pressure decay method with CO2. They first determined CO2 experimental concentration in 

bitumen using a PVT relationship of the gas and the density of oil after diffusion started. To 

obtain the density, a correlation was proposed in this work. After experimental concentration is 

obtained, a numerical minimization of an objective function between experimental concentration 

and calculated one is used to find gas diffusivity. The calculated data is acquired by means of a 

mass transfer model, where diffusion coefficient is considered to be a function of gas 

19 
 



 

concentration in oil. Here the heavy oil is also assumed to be non-diffusing, volume change is 

taken in consideration and concentration at interface varies according to time. 

(d) Sheika et al. (2005) 

The same experimental data from Upretti and Mehrotra (2000) is used and two different 

models are developed involving an analogous approach to pressure diffusion behavior in 

petroleum reservoirs under single-phase flow conditions. So, from the infinite-acting model 

where diffusion coefficient is achieved, the gas penetration depth never reaches the bottom of the 

pressure cell, establishing the boundary condition at the bottom. For the interface, the equilibrium 

between gas and oil is represented by Henry’s law and a mass balance of the diffused gas is 

performed to reach the interface boundary condition that is designated in Table 2.1.. Although, 

infinite-acting model is valid only for early times, beyond this the model is not valid anymore. To 

determine this time, finite-acting model is carried out and the boundary condition at the bottom of 

the cell establishes that there is no mass flux anymore.  

Two graphical methods are employed to obtain the relationship between diffusion 

coefficient and Henry’s constant, called combination factor. Those graphical methods are similar 

to well-testing reservoir permeability determination. After the combination factor is found, the 

Henry’s constant is calculated through a correlation for the volume-basis gas solubility and then 

diffusion coefficient can be acquired. 

The main assumptions of this model are: a constant diffusion coefficient, swelling is 

negligible, non-volatile oil and a constant gas compressibility factor. Based on those assumptions, 

the error in estimating diffusion coefficient without swelling and with a constant compressibility 

factor are also described in this work. An important remark that should be mentioned here is that 

for CO2-heavy oil test the combined relative error in predicting pressures due to neglecting oil 

swelling and the constant gas compressibility factor was the greatest one (13% - 14%). 

(e) Civan and Rasmussen (2001, 2006, 2008) 

Since 2001, Civan and Rasmussen developed a mathematically robust diffusion model 

from Zhang. In 2006, they presented a diffusion model that considered resistance in gas/liquid 

interface, and had several assumptions such as no swelling effect, incompressible gas/liquid 

solution and constant diffusion coefficient. With those assumptions, two analytical solutions of 

20 
 



 

mass accumulation of gas dissolved in liquid phase are proposed. They are based on two types of 

bottom conditions, namely the semi-infinite (short time) and finite length (long time) approaches. 

An interpretation methodology is used with experimental data to obtain diffusion coefficient and 

interface mass transfer coefficient. In 2008, they improved their model interpretation by 

considering only time-limited data which was independent of equilibrium conditions, being able 

also to estimate equilibrium pressure and gas solubility. Both long-time and short-time 

approximations were used to evaluate parameters.  

(f) Tharanivasan et al. (2006) 

In this work, Zhang experimental data was investigated. The experimental data and 

theoretically one were compared through a minimum objective function that was used to find the 

diffusion coefficient. The main focus here was to investigate three kinds of interface boundary 

conditions that better adjust to each type of solvent interface diffusion conditions (CO2, CH4 and 

propane). Those boundaries conditions were previously studied by other authors: equilibrium 

(Zhang), quasi equilibrium (Riazi and Upretti and Mehrotra) and non-equilibrium (Civan and 

Rasmussen).  

Accordingly to Tharanivasan, the assumption of constant diffusion coefficient in the 

solvent-saturated heavy oil was reasonable, because the solvent concentration in heavy oil is 

generally low under the test conditions. Furthermore both natural convection and swelling efect 

were not considered, while unidirectional diffusion was applied. 

For each boundary condition, Tharanivasan noticed in reported literature the 

correspondent solution for solvent concentration distribution in the oil. To obtain diffusion 

coefficient, a history matching technique between experimental pressures and calculated ones 

were used. The calculated pressure was established through an EoS for real gas.  Lee-Kesler 

correlation was then used to obtain compressibility factor. The number of moles of solvent 

dissolved into oil was obtained at any time by numerically integrating the transient solution for 

each boundary condition found by Tharanivasan. 

Before diffusion coefficient determination, equilibrium pressure should be established as 

it will be used in the boundary conditions. In this work, equilibrium pressure was determined as a 

result of a vapor-liquid equilibrium apparatus used to measure solubility and hence applying the 

EoS for the solvent phase at the equilibrium state. 

21 
 



 

To conclude, Tharanivasan noticed that for CO2-heavy oil system, the interfacial 

resistance varies with diffusion time. At early times of diffusion process, interface resistance is 

significant and non-equilibrium boundary condition can be considered. At large diffusion times, 

quasi equilibrium conditions are observed when history matching presents the best values.  

(g) Haugen and Firoozabadi (2009) 

Haugen and Firoozabadi showed with their diffusion numerical model that a purely 

diffusive model overestimates the liquid diffusion coefficient. Once, no natural convection 

occurs, the rate of mixing is governed by diffusion. On the other hand, after diffusion induces 

bulk velocity, convective mass transfer may still be important. This convective mass transport, 

which results in a local density change, is due to compressibility (dominates gas phase) and non-

ideality (dominates liquid phase, once the volume in mixing changes). Thus the two phases 

exchange mass as they equilibrate and consequently the pressure and liquid level in the PVT cell 

vary with time. The fact that the interface is moving was also taken in account. 

The interface conditions are considered to be in local chemical equilibrium and because 

there is a jump in composition, fugacity of a component in both phases should be same. 

They also reported that to identify the influence from bulk mass transport, it was 

necessary to use only a constant value of diffusion coefficient. By using variable diffusion 

coefficients it was difficult to identify bulk mass transport contributions. To complement, they 

also concluded that non-ideality and gas solubility have a great importance in liquid bulk mass 

transport. And when a liquid component is nonvolatile there is hardly any diffusion in the gas 

phase. 

(h) Etminan et al. (2013) 

In 2013, Etminan et al. published in a review a diffusion model that also considered an 

interface resistance as Civan and Rasmussen proposed. But instead of having a third type Robin 

boundary condition based on equilibrium pressure, the present boundary condition was third type 

Robin time dependent. This time dependence shelters the entire change of equilibrium and non-

equilibrium behaviors. 

Despite the several assumptions adopted on Etminan et al. (2013) model, this method was 

the one chosen here as a startup model based on the time-dependent Robin type boundary 

22 
 



 

condition. The mathematical treatment as well as the assumptions will be described and discussed 

in details in the upcoming sections.

2.5.2. Models Based on CT scan Experiments 

Once CT-scan studies were run in parallel to pressure decay, a few of CT-scan models 

will be described below.   

(a) Wen and Kantzas, 2005 

In 2005, Wen and Kantzas studied diffusion process using both NMR and CAT 

techniques. For CAT technique, the change in CT number observed during process delivers the 

density of the mixture within the oil column as described earlier in Eq. 2.4.  

They assumed that the diffusion coefficient of solvent was equal to the diffusion 

coefficient of the oil, and then called it the overall diffusion coefficient. This overall diffusion 

coefficient was studied as a constant and as a function of concentration. For constant coefficient 

study, they realized that it depends on concentration. On the other hand, for a diffusion 

coefficient dependent on concentration, they used equation of continuity with Fick’s law (Eq. 

2.14) through the same methodology followed by Oballa and Butler using Boltzmann 

transformation. This transformation is valid for infinite and semi-infinite boundary conditions, 

with interface boundary kept at constant concentration. With this transformation, the following 

equation is obtained as a particular solution of Eq. 2.14.

 2.21 

(b) Guerrero-Aconcha et al., 2008 

In this work, the Matano-Boltzmann method is questioned due to the anomalous trend 

observed for concentration dependent diffusion coefficient. In order to replace this method, they 

used the “slopes and intercepts” analytical method developed by Sarafianos (1986) to obtain the 

diffusion coefficient of a liquid solvent (nC6, nC7 and nC8) in heavy oil. They assumed a 

constant concentration at the interface along a semi-infinite system. 

They proceeded also with a calibration test to obtain a curve (Eq. 2.4) where the densities 

of the scanned samples can be recalculated.  

26 
 



 

Despite the “slopes and intercepts” method being appropriately adjusted to liquid solvents 

diffusion in heavy oil, this analytical method needs the concentration profile information in 

advance. For diffusion of gas solvents in oil, the acquisition of the solvent concentration data in 

oil is not an easy task as mentioned by Guerrero-Aconcha, 2009. None of the two Eq. 2.7 and Eq. 

2.8 can be used because Eq. 2.6 is not valid to obtain density mixture of gas in oil. 

Thus, Guerrero-Aconcha chose to follow a non-iterative finite volume method developed 

by Chang et al. (2006) which was used by the later one to inverse estimate thermal conductivity 

in one-dimensional domain. In the case of Guerrero-Aconcha, instead of the thermal 

conductivity, they wanted to obtain the diffusion coefficient. The differential equation is 

therefore transformed into a system of linear equations and solved using matrices. To solve these 

matrices, the density data at discrete points was used.  

The choice here to employ density data instead of concentration was justified by the 

limitations mentioned on the previous paragraph. In order to be able to use density as a 

replacement for concentration, the equation of continuity with Fick’s law was converted in the 

following form (Eq. 2.22) after the assumption of a lineal approach dependency between 

concentration and density. This assumption is based on Upreti and Mehrotra (2000) work where 

the gas-bitumen mixture density was correlated from the experimental data into a linear equation.

2.6. Swelling 
The swelling effect of crude oil with CO2 increases the oil formation volume factor so 

that residual oil after waterflooding is smaller in volume at surface conditions. Also, oil swelling 

within the pore spaces displaces water out of the pores, resulting in a decrease in the wetting 

phase saturation (drainage process). For water-wet porous media, relative permeabilities of the 

drainage oil are higher than imbibition values, thus favoring additional oil recovery (Carcoana, 

1992). 

The extent of the expansion or swelling is measured by the “swelling factor”, and this is 

used to calculate other properties of interest in enhanced oil recovery. There are few methods in 

literature to predict CO2 solubility and swelling factors of crude. In 1965, Simon and Graue 
27 

 



 

developed empirical correlations in graphical form to obtain CO2 solubility, fluid swelling, and 

viscosity data for pure CO2-oil mixtures. These correlations have some disadvantages 

considering the inconvenience for computer calculations and extrapolations out of the range of 

experiments as they were empirical. 

During seventies, Katz and Firoozabadi and other authors treated CO2-oil system as a 

mixture of 10 to 40 recognizable components with known properties and compositions. Despite 

using a simple equation of state to represent the system, they were able to acquire a complete 

description of vapor-liquid equilibrium. This multicomponent mixture nevertheless demands a 

huge amount of computer time becoming quite costly (Teja and Sandler, 1980).  

In 1980, Teja proposed an extended corresponding stated method for saturated liquid 

densities that was later applied to predict oil swelling factor in CO2-crude oil systems. In this 

subsequent work, Teja and Sandler (1980) predicted the swelling factor of CO2-crude oil 

mixtures given the average boiling point or Watson K-factor and specific gravity of the crude and 

the known properties of two references substances. By now treating the oil as a single pseudo-

component, they predicted solubility and swelling factors by using the Peng-Robinson equation 

of state.  

2.6.1. Experimental Methods 

Swelling test is a special PVT laboratory test and is the most common multi-contact PVT 

test (Aljarwan, 2012). During this test, a gas with known composition is injected into the oil at 

varying proportions (quantified in terms of molar percentage). Then the following data is 

acquired:  

• the relationship between saturation pressures and volume of gas injected; 

• the saturation pressure changes after a volume of gas is injected; 

• the volume change of the saturated fluid mixture in relation to the volume of the 

original saturated reservoir oil. 

In the present work, the experimental method to measure swelling factor did not use a 

windowed PVT cell and thus not all the data mentioned above was collected. The only 

information that was collected was the volume changes after the injection agent was added and 

measured through CT scan diagnosis. The current adopted methodology will be described in the 

Methods section. 

28 
 



 

2.7. Models Optimization 
This section will give a brief introduction about the two minimization methods that were 

applied to obtain the parameters from the chosen model described in Methods section.  

As stated in Silva Neto et al. (2010), the problem of parameter identification characterizes 

a typical inverse problem in engineering. This happens because sometimes developing theoretical 

models based on physical phenomena and real operating conditions are quite challenging. Thus 

an inverse mass transfer problem needs to be treated by using different methodologies, such as 

deterministic, stochastic and hybrid methods. So the inverse problem comprises the determination 

of the desired parameters through the use of experimental data for minimizing the residue 

between experimental and calculated values. 

Below, two methods that were used in the Results and Discussion section will be quickly 

described. 

2.7.1. Simulated Annealing Method (SA) 

The essence of this method is an analogy with thermodynamics from freezing and 

crystallization of liquids or cooling and annealing of metals. Mainly, the cooling procedure needs 

to be slow enough in order to reach the minimum energy level. For each iteration of this method, 

a new point is randomly generated. The extend of the search is based on the so-called Boltzmann 

probability distribution. As this algorithm admits additional points that raise the objective 

function, it avoids being stuck in local minima in early iterations and is also capable of exploring 

globally for better solutions. 

2.7.2. Levenberg-Marquardt Method (LM) 

This method is used to solve non-linear least square problems, especially in least squares 

curve fitting. LM method is basically a combination between the Gauss-Newton algorithm and 

the method of gradient descent, but it finds only a local minimum, not a global minimum. 

 

In order to keep the best features of each method, Silva Neto et al. (2010) proposed a 

combination of different methods, using SA as the global optimizer. In the case of LM and SA 

combination, once LM reached a point of minimum, SA was placed to run. If the same solution 

was found, it means that a global minimum has been reached and the iterative procedure was 

29 
 



 

finished. Although if a different solution was obtained from SA, it meant that the solution found 

in LM was not a global but rather a local minimum. Consequently, both methods were run again 

until the global minimum was reached.

3. MATERIALS AND METHOD

tests as well as the experimental methods from the two selected techniques.

Experiments were conducted in an apparatus mounted according to the setup shown in 

Figure 3.1. 

 
Figure 3.1 - Experimental Setup 

The pressure cell used in both experiments was properly designed to be used inside the 

CT scanner and to hold high-pressure levels. Once it needed to be used inside a CT scanner, it 

was constructed with x-ray transparent material, such as aluminum, and had a cylindrical shape to 

minimize CT reconstruction errors.  

As detailed in Figure 3.2 the aluminum diffusion cell was designed with the specifications 

found in Table 3.2.

As depicted in Figure 3.3, the diffusion cell was mounted over an acrylic base and then 

the whole assembly was installed on a fixed position over a wood table attached to CT bed. This 

entire installation allowed each CT image taken to be positioned in the same cross-sectional 

region of interest (ROI) inside the diffusion cell.

3.1. Experimental methods 
As depicted in experimental setup, the diffusion process was monitored using both 

pressure transducer and Siemens CT scanner. The pressure decay technique registered the 

pressure drop inside the cell at a constant temperature as gas diffused and dissolved into the oil 

column until the system reached the equilibrium. A diffusion cell was connected at the top and at 

the bottom to two pressure bottles, from where the fluids were admitted. The pressure transducer 

apparatus was calibrated and tested by manufacturer, so that no further calibration of the pressure 

sensor was performed. This pressure sensor has a 103.42 MPa or 15000 psi pressure module. 

With this model, accuracy of operational range is illustrated in Table 3.3 (Online Crystal 

Engineering data sheet source). Once, this equipment was not appropriate to the present pressure 

operational range, there was a significant chance that measurement results could be affected by 

this level of error.

31.13 to 103.52 MPa / 4515 to 15015 psi ± 0.1% of reading 

 
Simultaneously to pressure decay measurement, CT-scan techniques were used to 

generate 2D images of the CO2-oil mixture. As CO2 diffuses into oil, the concentration gradient 

distribution with distance can be acquired because the CT number varies during the process and 

relates to the concentration of CO2 in the mixture. To directly relate CT with concentration, 

firstly a relationship between CT number and densities need to be established, with this relation 

being defined by building a calibration curve with known densities. Afterward CT profile was 

related to density values, the next step was to obtain the correspondent CO2 concentration 

relationship based on CO2-oil mixture density. Thenceforth, the concentration variation is 

obtained over the length of the oil column. This was made possible through CT scan image taken 

at each fixed interval during diffusion process. A region of interest (ROI) close to the CO2-oil 

interface was designated inside the CT scan (See Figure 3.4). An average of horizontal CT 

numbers generates a vertical profile that represents CT numbers change throughout the ROI at X-

ray image.

Figure 3.4 - Diffusion cell with ROI 

As the used CT scanner was a medical one, there was no protocol available to be used in 

the present work conditions. It was necessary to develop a special CT scan protocol to scan this 

aluminum cell and enhance image quality as much as possible. The following table summarizes 

the CT scan protocol parameters employed for the current measurements at 130 kV.

The calibration curve, CO2 concentration relationship with mixture density and CT-scan 

data treatment will be subject of further discussion in the Results and Discussion subsection for 

CT scan method investigation. 

Before starting all the experiments, the diffusion cell assembly was pressured tested with 

nitrogen at 1.38 MPa (2000 psi) and at room temperature 293.15 K (20oC) inside a water bath. 

And before each experiment, the diffusion cell and lines were cleaned with kerosene, with 

alcohol and vented with compressed air. Later, CO2 was vented from top to the bottom of the cell 

and a small amount of pressure (0.013 – 0.027 MPa / 2 – 4 psi) was left inside the cell chamber. 

After this “atmosphere” of CO2 was left inside the cell, crude oil was injected from the bottom 

cell entrance until it reaches around 60 mL of pumped oil, rigorously checked through a beaker 

before and after oil injection started. A rate of 5mL/min oil injection was chosen to minimize 

CO2 convective forced mass transfer into oil due to fluid movement. CT scans were taken during 

oil pumping to check for any modification in oil CT numbers. 

Immediately after the column of oil was pumped inside the cell, the CO2 was injected 

from the top entrance until it reached the desired initial pressure. Here, the CO2 pump injection 

rate was controlled to be around 0.023 MPa/s (200 psi/min) remaining with the same purpose to 

prevent forced convection mentioned in the paragraph above. Right after the CO2 injection was 

finished, the first scan was taken and this image represented the CT number at the initial pressure 

(pi) and initial time (t=0). The end of the diffusion process was here defined as when a variation 

of no more than 0.007 MPa (1 psi) could be observed every 30 minutes during the following 

three hours. The entire process of filling the cell is short compared with the duration of the 

experiment, and hence it is assumed that mass transfer between the phases during the injection of 

both fluids is negligible. 

3.1.1. Experiments at 293.15 K (20oC) 

Almost all the tests were performed at the room temperature of 293.15 K (20oC). A 

thermocouple was attached close to the cell to be able to verify the stability of room temperature 

(see Figure 3.3). Only the last test was executed at 338.15 K (65oC), where thermal blankets were 

used to maintain temperature in the diffusion cell and in the pressure bottle where the CO2 was 

pressurized. 

36 
 



 

The first two tests at 293.15 K (20oC) were done with dead oil in its original composition. 

The initial pressures applied to each test were 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 6.89 MPa (1000 psi). In the 

former, CO2 was still in its gas phase while in the latter test CO2 was already in the liquid phase 

(see Attachment A for isothermal properties for CO2 from NIST). Although in both experiments, 

the diffusion process end up in equilibrium pressure, CT attenuation values were not able to 

identify the CO2 concentration in oil.  

(a) Using original oil 

Thus, for the next steps the crude dead oil was doped with iododecane (4% in volume) to 

enhance CT attenuation in order to detect the CO2 dissolution in oil. Other amounts of 

iododecane were tested (1% and 10%), but the one with 4% showed to be the optimal 

concentration of dopant that on one hand will not significantly change the oil composition 

(density = 0.893 g/cm3 @ 20oC and atmospheric pressure) and on the other hand will still enable 

CT attenuation identification along the diffusion process.  

(b) Using doped oil 

So, after oil was doped, experiments were performed at 3.03, 5.31, 9.65 and 28.96 MPa 

(440, 770, 1400 and 4200 psi). For the first three pressure levels, CO2 is lighter than the oil and 

therefore it was injected through the top after the oil was pumped through the bottom, and 

pressure was also monitored in the upper cell connection. As for the 28.96 MPa (4200 psi) level, 

CO2 is heavier than the oil so that, at this pressure level, the fluid was firstly injected and then the 

system was filled with oil from the top. The pressure in this case was monitored in the lower cell 

connection. The doped oil experiments presented a limitation that will be further subject of 

discussion in section 5. The last goal was to perform diffusion test under a similar reservoir 

conditions. 

3.1.2. Experiments at 338.15 K (65oC) 

The pressure chosen a close to reservoir condition was 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and the 

temperature was 338.15 K (65oC). In such levels, CO2 was on its supercritical condition. The 

dead oil used was from the same original samples taken for experiments performed at 293.15 K 

before the doped oil was used.

4. THEORETICAL MODELING 

4.1. Pressure Decay  
As stated earlier, the pressure-decay technique used in the present work follows Etminan 

et al. (2013) procedure. The next theoretical model presented was a short-term summary, for 

supplementary information address to Etminan et al. (2013) and Etminan (2012).  

For the diffusion model with interface resistance in isothermal conditions throughout the 

pressure-decay experiment, the use of Fick’s law is reasonable just after some assumptions are 

applied, as presented in the work from Etminan et al. (2013): 

(i) No chemical reaction between the oil and the gas; 

(ii) No natural convection; 

(iii) Swelling is negligible; 

(iv) Gas diffusion is unidirectional; 

(v) Diffusion coefficient is constant; 

(vi) Gas compressibility factor is constant; 

(vii) Solution density remains constant. 

Considering the geometry of the cell depicted in Figure 4.1 and the mentioned hypothesis, 

diffusion was modeled as:

39 
 



 

 

Figure 4.1 - Diffusion cell 

The boundary condition at the interface represents the non-instantaneous thermodynamic 

equilibrium. As the gas concentration in vapor pressure equilibrium (Cg?int(t)) is not the same as 

the gas concentration below the interface (Cg(z = 0, t)), a resistance to the mass transfer is 

represented by the film mass transfer resistance coefficient (1/k). 

The gas concentration in equilibrium above the interface is given by Henry’s law: 

Cg?int(t) =  
p(t)

H
 4.5 

The boundary condition at interface presented in Eq. 4.4 is modified into Eq. 4.6 to be 

used in the next diffusion equation solution (Etminan et al., 2013).

Where M and N are identified as:

 4.8 

By connecting the rate of mass transfer from the gas cap to the pressure decay with the 

rate of gas dissolution into the oil system, it is possible to obtain the solution of the diffusion 

equation in Laplace domain: 

40 
 



 

C?g(z, s) =  
M?i[e

?(z?2h)?s D? ? + e??z?s D? ?]

H[?Ms + (1 + Ns)?s D? ? + e??2h?s D? ?(Ms ? (1 + Ns)?s D? )]
 4.9 

Afterwards by using Henry’s law constant to replace concentration by pressure it is also 

possible to have the pressure calculated with the equation in Laplace space (Etminan et al., 2013): 

p?computed(s) =  
M?i[?e

??2h?s D? ? + 1? ?  D K? ??s D? e??2h?s D? ? ? ?s D? ?]

[?Ms + (1 + Ns)?s D? ? + e??2h?s D? ?(Ms ? (1 + Ns)?s D? )]
 4.10 

Pressure variation with time can be calculated from Eq. 4.10 by using numerical methods 

such as Stehfest algorithm to invert the Laplace transform. The results are the theoretical values 

rendered by the diffusion model. Results are affected by the parameters of mass transfer 

coefficient (k), Henry constant (H) and diffusion coefficient (D). 

An objective function was used to obtain the best values of parameters: 

Squared Error = ?(pexp(t) ? pcomputed(t))2
n

i=1

 4.1 

An elaborated method of fitting is necessary to render the optimum set of parameters for 

the large amount of data collected. The minimization method used to obtain the global minimum 

was the simulated annealing. This method was used to define the following three unknown 

values: mass transfer coefficient (k), Henry constant (H) and diffusion coefficient (D). The 

combination of two minimization methods will be later elucidated during Result and Discussion 

for Pressure Decay subsection.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

At this chapter, the results from pressure decay and CT scan are presented. The obtained 

data in both experiments is analyzed in order to evaluate its accuracy to be adjusted to a 

theoretical model to generate diffusion parameters. CT scan is also used to collect data from 

swelling effect. By the end of this chapter, a brief GC analysis is performed with the aim to detect 

mass transfer process in the opposite path of CO2 diffusion. 

5.1. Pressure Decay  
In a first step here, the pressure decay data quality is examined during Preliminary 

Analysis. Afterwards the diffusion coefficient and other parameters are obtained from model 

adjustment with these records and are illustrated in Data Analysis. Later, a sensitivity analysis is 

also developed considering the model. Finally, from those parameters, a CO2 concentration study 

inside the oil column is performed using also concentration solution for the chosen model. 

5.1.1. Preliminary Analysis 

The table in the next page summarizes all tests accomplished in the sequence they were 

performed. Such order was in fact established during the CT scan investigation and the 

differences between them were oil type, the way oil was added inside the diffusion cell and the 

initial conditions of each experiment (temperature and pressure).

With the purpose of understanding the pressure decay behavior according to the different 

scenarios enumerated above, pressure curves versus time are plotted in the next figure. In a first 

step, experimental data obtained with an initial pressure of 5.31 MPa (770 psi) is analyzed, as 

depicted in the next figure.

Figure 5.1 - Pressure decay profiles for 5.31 MPa initial pressure scenarios 

Some of the pressure decay experiments presented in Figure 5.1 may not have reached the 

equilibrium pressure, namely experiments 1, 7 and 9. Once the saturation pressure was not 

attained, experimental results were probably affected as well as parameters modeling reliability. 

Other experiments may not present the same pressure decay trend profile, like experiments 4 and 

5, where a different profile is noticed after each curve is plotted. This different profile may 

represent a leak. 

It is noticed that oil on its original composition has the highest pressure drop since it has the 

lower density value. So doped oil has lower pressure decay if compared to non-doped oil. So the 

denser the oil is, like experiments 5 and 7, the smallest is the pressure drop, with less diffusion of 

CO2 into oil. 

The conditions under which oil was added inside the cell were also checked, with oil being 

added in two different ways inside the diffusion cell. The first one consists of pumping oil into 

one of cell’s entries and the other by pouring oil with a beaker. The aim here was to analyze if 

pumping oil inside the cell with a CO2 atmosphere changed the oil composition.  It is detected 

45 
 



 

that without pumping the oil, the pressure drop was less than the expected (experiments 2, 6 and 

7). 

Repeatability was only checked for experiments with doped oil at 5 MPa range 

(experiments 9, 10 and 11) where pressure profiles observed during diffusion process follow the 

same qualitative trend.  

For pressures where CO2 is already on its liquid phase (CO2 pressure @ 293.15 K or 20oC 

&gt; 5.73 MPa or 831 psi), pressure profiles are extremely sensitive to temperature variations (see 

Figure 5.2). At this temperature and higher pressures, CO2 is closer to its critical point (Tc = 

304.1 K and pc = 7.38 MPa – See Attachment A). Consequently, minor temperature variations 

may lead here to major pressure changes. It is important to mention here that the thermocouple 

used in the temperature measurement was attached to external diffusion cell wall. 

 
Figure 5.2 - Pressure decay profiles instabilities for high pressures 

With the aim of reducing temperature variations during 293.15 K (20oC) tests, the whole 

system was placed inside a heating thermal blanket, while the room temperature was set to lower 

value and monitored with the thermocouple. Such conditions were valid for the test performed at 

46 
 



 

10.34 MPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC). Thus as seen in Figure 5.3, if experiment 12 at 

293.15 K (20oC) is compared with the one at 338.15 K (65oC), it is clear that the latter one 

produces more reliable and stable data. 

 

Figure 5.3 - Pressure decay profiles for experiments 12 and 14 scenarios 

Another observation that can be extracted from Figure 5.3 is that the pressure drop in 10.34 

MPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC) test is smaller than that one with 9.95 MPa (1443 psi), 

293.15 K (20oC). This may have happened because of high temperature 338.15 K (65oC) and also 

because during the experiment, oil was left 24h inside the diffusion cell to stabilize temperature.  

5.1.2. Data Analysis 

It is worthwhile to mention that Etminan et al. (2013) diffusion model, chosen to be applied 

here, has several limitations concerning the here presented experimental conditions, such as high 

pressures and light crude oils. 

With pressure data presented in the previous section, experimental profiles were adjusted to 

the model for obtaining the desired parameters using a routine implemented in Matlab® (see code 
47 

 



 

in Appendix A). Firstly Levenberg-Maquardt (LM) was utilized as an initial minimization 

method to find local minimum. For experiments with higher pressure, the convergence of the 

three parameters could nevertheless not be achieved. Besides this, as LM method has no 

boundary restrictions, during some 5.31 MPa experiments, the obtained mass transfer coefficient 

values were out of the expected range. In regard to this last issue, a sensitivity analysis is 

performed by the end of this section. 

The present minimization method choice was the Simulated Annealing, which requires 

setting a range of initial parameters to start the algorithm. Once it randomly investigates the 

values inside the selected range to identify the global minimum; it attempts to improve the global 

minimum obtained earlier, by narrowing the range. 

Besides the experimental pressure profile, other experimental information is demanded as 

input values in order to the calculate diffusion coefficient, mass transfer coefficient and Henry 

constant. Such inputs are the gas cap volume, height of oil column and compressibility factor. 

Once the diffusion cell was not windowed, the first two input factors were obtained using CT-

scan, with details presented in the upcoming swelling subsection. On the other hand the 

compressibility factor is considered constant and was found using PR-EoS with initial pressure 

and constant temperature as EoS entry variables. 

Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5 illustrate experimental data adjustment, through simulated 

annealing, using Etminan et al. (2013) model. Figure 5.4 is better suited for experimental data 

once after equilibrium pressure was reached; it was also maintained for a while. The other 

experiments adjustment figures is listed in Appendix B.

Even though the experimental conditions used in the present work have never been tested 

before in literature, the estimated diffusion coefficients have the same order of magnitude of 

those presented in Table 5.3 and are similar to those ones from Riazi (1996) and Haugen and 

Firoozabadi (2009) once both experiments also used lighter components than heavy oil, as 

employed by Etminan et al. (2013). 

Almost all the adjustments presented in Table 5.2 are quite accurate as illustrated by the 

squared errors oscillation in the range of 1x10-2. 

For experimental conditions with 2.81 MPa (440 psi) and 5.31 MPa (770 psi) initial 

pressures, Etminan Model is well suited as those pressures fall in a similar pressure range of 

Etminan analysis. Consequently, they are still at VLE and then Henry law can be employed if 

mixture is considered sufficiently diluted. But since the swelling effect is noticed, in some way it 

may affect the adjustment with experimental data.  

Once the diffusion coefficient represents how smoothly the solvent can diffuse into oil 

body; it is noticed, according to Table 5.2, that heavier oils (experiments 4, 5 and 7) are the only 

ones with diffusion coefficients in the order of magnitude of 1x10-9 which means that for denser 

oils CO2 propagates in the oil column slowly than in lighter oils. 

Regarding the mass transfer coefficient (k), 1/k is defined as the interfacial resistance 

against the gas molecular diffusion. Half of them have an order of magnitude of 1 x 10-4, and 

almost all doped oil experiments presented in the range of 1 x 10-5 and 1 x 10-6. Relating these 

orders of magnitude to those ones obtained by Etminan et al. (2013), the resistance at the 

interface may be neglected for all practical purposes when larger than 1 x 10-4. Thus including 

mass transfer coefficient into the model for such values may not necessarily and physically 

represent interface resistance. 

For relatively low pressures and dilute solutions, ideal gas phase behavior can be assumed 

and then Henry constant is inversely proportional to the equilibrium concentration at a given 

pressure. Consequently, as Henry’s constant increases (solubility decreases), the gas pressure 

drops at a lower rate. For pressures up to 5 MPa, the effects of pressure on Henry’s constant are 

quite small and it can be considered that it is solely a function of temperature. For higher values 

of Henry’s law constant, it is expected that solubility decreases and then the predicted gas cap 

pressure decay is shorter, as demonstrated in the Table 5.4.

As mentioned previously, Henry’s Law can just be satisfactorily used to express solubility 

for dilute solutions, and then it is limited by the thermodynamics of the system. On the other 

hand, for mixtures that largely deviate from the ideal behavior, EoS models are used to represent 

phase equilibria and then are applied for solubility calculations. In this sense, rather than have 

Henry’s constant as a third parameter in the diffusion model, it  would be better to estimate it  by 

using an EoS. Under these circumstances, the other two missing parameters from the model, D 

and k, could be evaluated more precisely. 

An acceptable adjustment to Etminan Model requires pressure saturation to be well 

established. If the theoretical curve for each experiment is extrapolated and the final pressure is 

far from the one at theoretical equilibrium, those experiments have their parameters reliability 

affected. In Table 5.5, next page, the difference between the final pressure reached at each 

experiment and the expected one from Etminan model are illustrated.

The effect of such adjustment can be noticed when comparing in next page the following 

Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7, as for the first one the adjustment is not precise given the fact that the 

equilibrium pressure is not reached; while this is corrected for the second one.

Another study using the present model can be performed using Eq. 4.9 and the three 

obtained parameters from Table 5.2. This study determines CO2 concentration variation along oil 

column either at a fixed time or in a fixed position with varying time. In Figure 5.8 and Figure 

5.9, the CO2 concentration distribution during time and along oil column is illustrated for 

experiment 1 with original oil at 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 293.15 K (20oC). 

 
Figure 5.8 – CO2 concentration at a fixed position in oil column during time 

55 
 



 

 

Figure 5.9 – CO2 concentration at a fixed time varying along oil column 

Accordingly to Figure 5.8, at early times, it seems that the CO2 concentration close to the 

interface is higher than the equilibrium concentration. As diffusion progresses, pressure 

decreases, and this concentration tends to equilibrium. At Figure 5.9, it is clear that CO2 reached 

the cell bottom. In both studies (Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9), concentration values higher than 

saturation may happen due to the absence of swelling in the model, meaning that the transition 

zone, where the amount of CO2 should be dissolved, is underestimated in its size. All the other 

experiments have similar curves, only concentration values change, as showed in next page in 

Table 5.6.

5.1.3. Sensitivity analysis 

The sensitivity analysis of parameters is motivated by the fact that the obtained mass 

transfer coefficients (1 x 10-4 m/s &amp;lt;k ) are out of the expected range  (1 x 10-4 m/s &gt; k &gt; 1 x 10-8 

m/s) of values using the LM method for experiment 1 data. 

To better comprehend what was noticed above, a sensitivity analysis of the effect from 

those three parameters (k, H and D) on the behavior of the analytical solution is examined. All 

data obtained for the predicted gas cap pressure versus time for each case is compared to the base 

case parameters obtained for experiment 1. 

In Table 5.7 , the base case parameters and value of each case are listed. 

Table 5.7 – Base case for experiment 1 and values for each case for sensitive analysis

5 1.00 x 102 1.00 x 10-6 4.00 x 10-1 

 

As it was mentioned earlier, when mass transfer coefficient is larger, resistance at the 

interface becomes insignificant. For mass transfer coefficients higher than the one from the base 

case, it can be noticed that the squared error is very close to the best case and will remain the 

same for values higher than the base case (see Figure 5.10). Physically, it is possible to say that 

diffusion is dominant over interface resistance, so that CO2 diffuses into oil almost 

instantaneously.  

58 
 



 

 
Figure 5.10 – Effect of mass transfer coefficient on predicted gas cap pressure 

Performing an analogy to heat transfer, diffusion coefficient can be compared to the 

conductance resistance of oil column towards CO2 molecules’ diffusion. So for reduced values of 

diffusion coefficient, concentration saturation takes longer to be reached along the oil column and 

then equilibrium time will become also longer, as seen by magenta profile in Figure 5.11.  

59 
 



 

 
Figure 5.11 - Effect of diffusion coefficient on predicted gas cap pressure 

The results in Figure 5.12 illustrate that the gas pressure drop is lower as Henry’s constant 

increases. So for smaller values of Henry’s constant, a larger amount of CO2 is dissolved into oil.

5.2. CT scan 

5.2.1. Data treatment 

After a special protocol was created to scan the diffusion cell with oil inside, each image 

exported from CT scan software was opened in Matlab as a 512 x 512 matrix. Figure 5.13 

describes the area inside the cell where CT scan acquires the image and how the image is 

visualized in Matlab?.  

 

Figure 5.13 – Image scanned from CT to Matlab 

First a conversion of the original file from the CT-scan software in DICOM (Digital 

Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format was performed. A couple of pixel 

transformations were required to convert pixel value in the file to Hounsfield units (H.U).  

As previously explained, after a ROI area close to the CO2-oil interface was selected, a 

vertical profile was generated to be compared to other images profiles as is demonstrated in the 

next picture. 

61 
 



 

 

Figure 5.14 – Diffusion cell zones and CT number vertical profile 

When focusing the analysis only on the oil column, it is possible to observe significant 

artifact effects on image quality. One possible assumption here is that this error was mainly 

induced by aluminum walls thickness and by the vertical positioning of the cell. Further data 

treatment is therefore required to minimize such error.  

In a first step, the optimal area of the ROI inside the cell is selected in order to be narrow 

enough to reduce aluminum wall effect and sufficiently large to increase the data range used in 

each horizontal average. Below is depicted the delimitation of such area.   

 

Figure 5.15 – ROI selection 
62 

 



 

Due to observed artifacts near the bottom of the cell, an additional error compensation is 

performed, namely subtracting the original obtained matrix from a correction matrix. Such 

correction matrix in turn is calculated by subtracting the matrix result with the cell filled with air 

from the CT values from the air alone. In Figure 5.16, the green line represents the original 

measured profile while the green blue one illustrates the result of the data treatment.     

 

Figure 5.16 – Error removal of CT profile in oil column experiment 1 

Finally, all images exported from CT-scan software are treated using a code to generate the 

desired profile. This process is detailed in a Matlab? code described in Appendix C. 

5.2.2. Data Analysis 

The first two experiments were performed with dead oil at initial pressure of 5.31 MPa (770 

psi) (with CO2 in gas phase) and  6.94 MPa (1006 psi) (with CO2 in liquid phase), both  at  

293.15 K.  

In Figure 5.17, the plot represents each scan vertical profile of the CO2 gas and oil phases 

during diffusion process. It is possible to observe at each profile the interface displacement 
63 

 



 

caused by swelling effect. Once all interfaces are aligned, Figure 5.18 is plotted. There the 

increase of the CT-number of CO2 phase can be clearly observed due to the increase of pressure.    

 
Figure 5.17 – Profiles of gas cap, interface and oil column of experiment 1 

 
Figure 5.18 – Experiment 1 with interfaces aligned 

64 
 



 

Zooming in the area inside oil column, without interface alignment, Figure 5.19 is 

generated. Those CT peaks represent when two components density values are very distinct.  

 

Figure 5.19 – Experiment 1 profiles with original oil at initial pressure of 5.31 MPa. 

From Figure 5.19, it is not possible to notice a representative CT variance that shows 

density decay due to CO2 dissolution in oil. Each profile above also presents a different value for 

its random error. For this experiment the average error was around 18 H.U without considering 

the peak at top of the oil column and the CT numbers decrease at the bottom of the cell.  

In the case of the experiment with 6.94 MPa (1006 psi), as depicted next, the random error 

was higher at around 10 H.U. At the beginning of this experiment when cell was pressurized at 

initial pressure, the peaks observed in the previous figure were reduced. Additionally, in Figure 

5.20, it is possible to observe a slight increment in CT number profiles as the process takes place. 

This last observation is the opposite from what was expected, while the diffusion process is

Figure 5.20 - Experiment 3 profiles with original oil at initial pressure of 6.94 MPa. 

While the interface movement in both experiments can be clearly noticed, the expected CT 

profile decrease during diffusion process caused by density reduction is not noticed in both 

experiments with original oil.  

Before moving to another alternative to detect a reasonable CT number variation, it is 

necessary to investigate the relationship between the expected CT variation due to density 

decrease and the random error. Thus, in the next figure, a calibration curve at an energy level of 

130 kV is plotted with the present Siemens Spirit Somaton scanner in use. 

66

Afterwards, using a multiphase equilibrium package called MULTIFLASH? from 

Infochem software, it is possible to detect the expected CO2-oil mixture density variation as CO2 

dissolves according to different concentrations (see Figure 5.22), considering the present oil 

characteristics (Attachment B). 

67 
 



 

 

Figure 5.22 - Expected oil mixture density %CO2 variation at 293.15 K 

For an exemplary situation at 293.15 K (20oC), if the initial pressure were 6.89 MPa            

(1000 psi) (?oil = 873.5 kg/m3), the final pressure would be at most 3.45 MPa (500 psi) and the 

amount of CO2 dissolved would correspond to 40% (?mix = 866.0 kg/m3). Under such conditions 

representing a best case scenario for detection, the expected CT number variation would be only 

7 H.U. 

In reality, the expected pressure variation is much smaller and hence also the level of CT 

number variation to be measured. From the observed random errors presented in Figure 5.23 and 

Figure 5.24, it is possible to conclude under those conditions (oil 5.31 MPa or 770 psi and 6.94 

MPa or 1006 psi at 293.15 K or 20oC) that the level of precision required to perform the analysis 

is not attainable.

A feasible alternative to increase the difference in attenuation coefficients (CT number) 

between fluids (CO2 and oil) above the referred error levels was adding dopant to crude oil. 

Three diffusion tests were performed for each dopant concentration (1%, 4% and 10%) with 

initial pressure at the range of 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 293.15 K (20oC). From the obtained 

results, it is possible to identify that the optimum dopant concentration that allowed a substantial 

CT number variation was 4% volume in oil.  

Afterwards, four experiments were performed with doped oil (4% iododecane) at the 

following initial pressures: 2.81 MPa, 5.26 MPa, 9.95 MPa and 28.96 MPa (407 psi, 757 psi, 

1406 psi and 4185 psi); all at 293.15 K (20oC). 

In Figure 5.25, Figure 5.26 and Figure 5.27, it is possible to observe a certain CT profile 

decrease during diffusion process, though the random error makes the analysis of CT values 

deviation for each profile a challenging task.

During experiment 13, CO2 was heavier than oil. That is why it is noticed in Figure 5.28, 

that oil is placed in the top of the diffusion cell. 

 

Figure 5.28 - Experiment 13 profiles with doped oil at initial pressure of 28.96 MPa. 

Once it is possible to perceive CT profile difference during diffusion process, the 

forthcoming step is to obtain the density value for each CT number through a calibration curve. 

As mentioned in previous subsection, for materials with atomic numbers that contributes to 

both Compton scattering and photoelectric attenuation of X-rays such as the doped oil, a dual 

energy measurement shall be taken in order to have a correct relationship between CT numbers 

and densities. In Coles et al. (1991), it was explained that two series of measurements of material 

with known densities should be performed in two levels of CT-scan energy. The present CT-scan 

in use has only 130 kV and 80 kV levels of energy. At this lower energy level of 80 kV and due 

to care dose limitations, it was not possible to increase output of the tube (mA.s) in order to 

improve image quality. Thus, at 80 kV level a very poor image quality was attained, making it 

impossible to obtain a relationship between CT number and densities with an acceptable standard 

deviation. 

72 
 



 

This limitation with doped oil in obtaining a calibration curve at lower energy level 

hindered all possible attempts to detect a reasonable CT number variation during diffusion 

experiments at the temperature of 293.15 K. The last resort was to perform diffusion test under a 

similar reservoir conditions. The initial pressure chosen was 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and 

temperature was 338.15 K (65oC). In such conditions, CO2 was on its supercritical phase. The 

next figure shows CO2-oil mixture density variation according to CO2 dissolution in the mixture 

at 338.15 K (65oC) (MULTIFLASH?). 

 
Figure 5.29- Expected oil mixture density %CO2 variation at 338.15 K 

As depicted in Figure 5.30, the major difference on the CT number profile happens after the 

cell was heated for 24 hours at 338.15 K (65oC), with such oil density decrease happening 

because of temperature increase. When the diffusion process takes place, a minor difference 

between the profiles can only be observed near the interface. The random error is still noticeable 

as depicted in Figure 5.31.

5.2.3. Swelling 

As previously stated, the pressure diffusion cell employed in this work was not windowed. 

Thus to obtain swelling factor, CT scan was used to acquire CO2-oil interface height variation.  

To measure CO2-oil interface height variation for each experiment, CT profiles are plotted 

accordingly to Figure 5.32 where interfaces are highlighted inside a dashed red box.  

The cell height values depicted in the next figures represent the matrix’s lines. Thus each 

line has the length of 0.011719 cm. 

 

Figure 5.32 – CT profiles for experiment 1 

After zooming in (see Figure 5.33), the interface variation is measured in the dashed 

vertical line, and from now on it is possible to measure the difference between the height where 

system was not pressurized and system with saturation pressure. 

75 
 



 

 

Figure 5.33 – Interface position variation indicating swelling 

The Simon and Graue (1965) definition of a dimensionless swelling factor is used to 

calculate a value from the experimental data: 

SF =  
oil volume at Psat and T

oil volume at 1 atm and T
 

5.1 

According to the description above, consistent values for SF can be obtained only after 

saturation pressure of each experiment was reached. This was nevertheless not the case for some 

experiments, where equilibrium time was not attained. 

In Table 5.8, SFs are obtained for each experiment. In terms of accuracy, those ones that 

have the final pressure closer to the equilibrium one have more reliable factor.

For almost all 5 MPa experiments, SF range is between 1.14 and 1.17; except for those 

ones that have their light components removed: experiments 4 and 5. A reason for this may be 

due to light components extraction during CO2 pressurization. Thus, once light components have 

been already removed previously to CO2 pressurization, there was no volume reduction after 

CO2 pumping and consequently oil volume immediately started to swell from its height at 

atmospheric pressure. 

77 
 



 

This light components extraction during CO2 pressurization is observed during three 

experiments (2, 7 and 8), while few scans were taken during CO2 pumping. This phenomenon of 

light component extraction is very quick, occurring just in the beginning of the experiment and 

may not be detectable in all of them. 

As depicted in Figure 5.34, it is possible to see the interface height position slight reduction 

during CO2 pumping due to oil light components extraction. 

 

Figure 5.34 – Volume reduction in the beginning of 2.81MPa test, test 8 

Once initial pressure of the experiment increased, as observed in experiments 8 to 9, SF 

correspondently increased. In contrast, when CO2 changes from gas to liquid phase, SF decreases 

as noticed in experiments 2 to 3 and experiments 11 to 12.  

For experiments 3 and 12, the interface position during CO2 injection changed when CO2 

started changing into liquid phase. As depicted in Figure 5.35, when CO2  injection is still taking 

place, two interfaces can be clearly noticeable at 5.47 MPa, 5.54 MPa and 5.71 MPa (793 psi, 

804 psi and 827 psi) profiles, The first interface is between CO2 gas phase and CO2 liquid phase 

and the other one is between CO2 liquid phase and oil. After CO2 injection continued until initial 

78 
 



 

pressure was reached, CO2 became solely liquid and just one interface is seen (6.92 MPa or 1004 

psi profile). 

 

Figure 5.35 – Interface position during CO2 injection for test 3 

 

As also noticed in Figure 5.36, in a moment during diffusion process (after 6.46 MPa or 

937 psi), the interface height starts reducing until system reaches equilibrium, from 6.17 MPa 

(895 psi) until 5.54 MPa (804 psi). This phenomenon is also noticed for experiments 1, 3 and 12.

5.3. GC analysis 
At the end of 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC) experiment, a collection device 

was connected to the top entry of the diffusion cell. The fluid was then collected inside a gas 

sampling bag (Tedlar?) at room temperature of 293.15 K (20oC) and GC (gas chromatography) 

was performed with this fluid. Figure 5.37 shows the results of the two GC analyses 

accomplished: thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame-ionization detectors (FID). 

80 
 



 

 

 
Figure 5.37- TCD and FID GC analysis from gas sample at the end of test 14 

As noticed from GC analysis, a very small amount of light oil components is found inside 

the fluid zone where only CO2 were supposed to be placed. Those light oil components 

extraction from oil may be caused by the CO2 supercritical extraction. This assumption as well as 

counter diffusion hypothesis need to be further investigated and better quantified in order to 

determine if diffusion model needs to be adjusted to this new observation.

6. FINAL REMARKS 

The original focus of this work was to identify the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor 

for CO2 in light oils through CT scans. Such method was preferred as the density concentration 

profile could be directly obtained through measurements, instead of indirect calculations using 

pressure values. Consequently all measurements were accordantly planned, including doping the 

oil. On the course of the measurements, it was nevertheless observed that random error at both 

measurements with original and doped oil (respectively at energy levels of 130 kV and 80 kV) 

was far higher than the required precision to detect the expected density reduction as CO2 

diffused.  

One possible solution to decrease such random error would be reducing the aluminum cell 

wall thickness, though this could directly lead to lower working pressure levels. Another 

alternative would be using a CT scan capable of operating with higher energy levels and without 

the observed limitations from the employed medical model.  

Despite the above referred problematic, CT investigation could offer an important insight 

on CO2 diffusion inside the oil column. Not only could a significant swelling effect could be 

measured, but also CO2 displacement down to the bottom of the cell was identified. Those two 

conditions were not reported in the literature so far, as the diffusion of CO2 in light oil is not yet 

well documented and might be taken into account for further diffusion models boundary 

conditions. 

In contrast the swelling effect could be clearly observed and characterized with such a 

precision level that even volume reduction during both CO2 injection and at the end of some tests 

could be identified.  

Simultaneously to the CT approach, the pressure decay technique was also employed, 

directly leading to the selection of the diffusion model. The choice of the model from Etminan et 

al., (2013) was justified by its interface boundary condition that considered both equilibrium and 

non-equilibrium conditions. Nevertheless, this model was valid for some assumptions (Henry’s 

law, non-volatile oil, neglected swelling, constant gas compressibility factor) that did not partially 

match the present experimental conditions (higher pressure and light oil). In addition to this, such 

model was better suited for experimental data obtained after equilibrium pressure was reached 

83 
 



 

and then maintained for a while. However, the non-insolation of diffusion cell during tests at 

293.15 K (20oC) and near to supercritical conditions generated experimental data that 

compromised model adjustment.  

Despite such limitations, the obtained diffusion coefficients were within the ranges 

previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, another parameter obtained with the model, 

namely the mass transfer coefficient, allowed identifying that there was almost no mass transfer 

resistance in the interface for original oil. 

For further studies, the choice of a model that represents more closely the noticed 

phenomena will help obtaining more reliable parameters, such as a diffusion model considering a 

diffusion coefficient dependent on concentration. It is also recommended to compare obtained 

experimental swelling factor to existing correlations in such conditions. About CT scan, once 

almost all tests were performed at 293.15 K (20oC), it is highly suggested to perform additional 

tests at experimental settings as near as possible to reservoir conditions, namely at higher 

pressure and temperature, in order to obtain information more suitable for CO2-EOR projects.
